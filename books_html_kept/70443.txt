Governor Bradfordâs First Dialogue.

A DIALOGUE, OR THE SUM OF A CONFERENCE BETWEEN SOME YOUNG MEN
BORN IN NEW ENGLAND AND SUNDRY ANCIENT MEN THAT CAME OUT OF
HOLLAND AND OLD ENGLAND, ANNO DOMINI 1648.
[1]

Young men.
âGentlemen, you were pleased to appoint us this
time to confer with you, and to propound such questions as might give
us satisfaction in some things wherein we are ignorant, or at least
further light to some things that are more obscure unto us. Our first
request therefore is, to know your minds concerning the true and simple
meaning of those of
The Separation
, as they are termed, when
they say the Church of England is no Church, or no true Church.

Ancient men.
âFor answer hereunto, first, you must know that
they speak of it as it then was under the hierarchical prelacy, which
since have been put down by the State, and not as it is now unsettled.

2. They nowhere say, that we remember, that they are no Church. At
least, they are not so to be understood; for they often say the
contrary.

3. When they say it is no true Church of Christ, they do not at all
mean as they are the elect of God, or a part of the Catholic Church, or
of the mystical body of Christ, or visible Christians professing faith
and holiness (as most men understand the church); for which purpose
hear what Mr. Robinson in his Apology, page 53. âIf by the Church,â
saith he, âbe understood the Catholic Church, dispersed upon the face
of the whole earth, we do willingly acknowledge that a singular part
thereof, and the same visible and conspicuous, is to be found in the
land, and with it do profess and practise, what in us lies,
[Pg 2]
communion
in all things in themselves lawful, and done in right order.â

4. Therefore they mean it is not a true church as it is a National
Church, combined together of all in the land promiscuously under the
hierarchical government of archbishops, their courts and canons, so far
differing from the primitive pattern in the Gospel.

Young men.
âWherein do they differ then from the judgment or
practice of our churches here in New England?

Ancient men.
âTruly, for matter of practice, nothing at all that
is in any thing material; these being rather more strict and rigid
in some proceedings about admission of members, and things of such
nature, than the other; and for matter of judgment, it is more, as we
conceive, in words and terms, than matter of any great substance; for
the churches and chief of the ministers here hold that the National
Church, so constituted and governed as before is said, is not allowable
according to the primitive order of the Gospel; but that there are
some parish assemblies that are true churches by virtue of an implicit
covenant amongst themselves, in which regard the Church of England may
be held and called a true church.

Where any such are evident, we suppose the other will not disagree
about an implicit covenant, if they mean by an implicit covenant that
which hath the substance of a covenant in it some way discernible,
though it be not so formal or orderly as it should be. But such an
implicit [covenant] as is no way explicit is no better than a Popish
implicit faith (as some of us conceive) and a mere fiction, or as that
which should be a marriage covenant which is no way explicit.

Young men.
âWherein standeth the difference between the rigid
Brownists and Separatists and others, as we observe our ministers in
their writings and sermons to distinguish them?

Ancient men.
âThe name of Brownists is but a nickname, as
Puritan and Huguenot, &c., and therefore they do not amiss to decline
the odium of it in what they may. But by the rigidness of Separation
they do not so much mean the difference, for our churches here in New
England do the same thing under the name of
secession
from the
corruptions found amongst them, as the other did under the name or
term of
separation
from them. Only this declines the odium the
better. See Reverend Mr. Cottonâs Answer to Mr. Baylie, page the 14th.

That some which were termed Separatists, out of some mistake and heat
of zeal, forbore communion in lawful things with other godly persons,
as prayer and hearing of the word, may be
[Pg 3]
seen in what that worthy
man, Mr. Robinson, hath published in dislike thereof.

Young men.
âWe are well satisfied in what you have said. But
they differ also about synods.

Ancient men.
âIt is true we do not know that ever they had any
solemn Synodical Assembly. And the reason may be, that those in England
living dispersed and
[2]
could not meet in their ordinary meetings
without danger, much less in synods. Neither in Holland, where they
might have more liberty, were they of any considerable number, being
but those two churches, that of Amsterdam and that of Leyden. Yet some
of us know that the church [of Leyden] sent messengers to those of
Amsterdam, at the request of some of the chief of them, both elders
and brethren, when in their dissensions they had deposed Mr. Ainsworth
and some other both of their elders and brethren, Mr. Robinson being
the chief of the messengers sent; which had that good effect, as that
they revoked the said deposition, and confessed their rashness and
error, and lived together in peace some good time after. But when the
churches want neither peace nor light to exercise the power which
the Lord hath given them, Christ doth not direct them to gather into
synods or classical meetings, for removing of known offences either in
doctrine or manners; but only sendeth to the pastors or presbyters of
each church to reform within themselves what is amongst them. âA plain
pattern,â saith Mr. Cotton in his Answer to Mr. Baylie, page 95, âin
case of public offences tolerated in neighbour churches, not forthwith
to gather into a synod or classical meeting, for redress thereof,
but by letters and messengers to admonish one another of what is
behooveful; unless upon such admonition they refuse to hearken to the
wholesome counsel of their brethren.â And of this matter Mr. Robinson
thus writeth in his book,
Just.
page 200, âThe officers of one
or many churches may meet together to discuss and consider of matters
for the good of the church or churches, and so be called a Church
Synod, or the like, so they infringe no order of Christ or liberty
of the brethren;â not differing herein from Mr. Davenport and the
principal of our ministers.

Young men.
âBut they seem to differ about the exercise of
prophecy, that is, that men out of office, having gifts, may upon
occasion edify the church publicly and openly, and applying the
Scriptures; which seems to be a new practice.

Ancient men.
âIt doth but seem so; as many things else do that
have by usurpation grown out of use. But that it hath
[Pg 4]
been an ancient
practice of the people of God, besides the grounds of Scripture, we
will give an instance or two. We find in the ancient Ecclesiastical
History of Eusebius, lib. vi. cap. 19, how Demetrius, bishop of
Alexandria, being pricked with envy against Origen, complaineth in
his letters that there was never such a practice heard of, nor no
precedent to be found, that laymen in presence of bishops have taught
in the church; but is thus answered by the bishop of Jerusalem and
the bishop of Cesarea: âWe know not,â say they, âwhy he reporteth a
manifest untruth, whenas there may be found such as in open assemblies
have taught the people; yea, whenas there were present learned men that
could profit the people, and moreover holy bishops, who at that time
exhorted them to preach. For example, at Laranda Euelpis was requested
of Neon, at Iconium Paulinus was requested by Celsus, at Synada
Theodorus was requested by Atticus, who were godly brethren, &c.â

The second instance is out of Speedâs Cloud of Witnesses, page 71.
Saith he, âRambam or Maymon records, that in the synagogues, first,
only a Levite must offer sacrifice; secondly, but any in Israel might
expound the law; thirdly, the expounder must be an eminent man, and
must have leave from the master of the synagogue; and so contends that
Christ, Luke iv. 16, taught as any of Israel might have done as well as
the Levites; and the like did Paul and Barnabas, Acts xiii. 15.â

If any out of weakness have abused at any time their liberty, it is
their personal faulting, as sometimes weak ministers may their office,
and yet the ordinance good and lawful.

And the chief of our ministers in New England agree therein. See Mr.
Cottonâs Answer to Baylie, page the 27th, 2d part. âThough neither
all,â saith he, ânor most of the brethren of a church have ordinarily
received a gift of public prophesying, or preaching, yet in defect
of public ministry, it is not an unheard of novelty that God should
enlarge private men with public gifts, and
[3]
to dispense them to
edification; for we read that when the church at Jerusalem were all
scattered abroad, except the Apostles, yet they that were scattered
went every where preaching the word.â

Mr. Robinson also, in his Apology, page 45, chapter 8, to take off
the aspersion charged on them, as if all the members of a church were
to prophesy publicly, answers, âIt comes within the compass but of a
few of the multitude, haply two or three in a church, so to do; and
touching prophecy,â saith he, âwe think the very same that the Synod
held at Embden, 1571,
[Pg 5]
hath decreed in these words: âFirst, in all
churches, whether but springing up, or grown to some ripeness, let
the order of prophecy be observed, according to Paulâs institution.
Secondly, into the fellowship of this work are to be admitted not only
the ministers, but the teachers too, as also of the elders and deacons,
yea, even of the multitude, which are willing to confer their gift
received of God to the common utility of the church; but so as they
first be allowed by the judgment of the ministers and others.â So we
believe and practise with the Belgic churches, &c.â See more in the
immediate following page.

Young men.
âWe cannot but marvel that in so few years there
should be so great a change, that they who were so hotly persecuted by
the prelates, and also opposed by the better sort of ministers, not
only Mr. Gifford, Mr. Bernard, and other such like, but many of the
most eminent both for learning and godliness, and yet now not only
these famous men and churches in New England so fully to close with
them in practice, but all the godly party in the land to stand for the
same way, under the new name of Independents, put upon them.

Ancient men.
âIt is the Lordâs doing, and it ought to be
marvellous in our eyes; and the rather, because Mr. Bernard, in his
book, made their small increase in a few years one and the chief
argument against the way itself. To which Mr. Robinson answered, that
âReligion is not always sown and reaped in one age; and that John Huss
and Jerome of Prague finished their testimony a hundred years before
Luther, and Wickliff well nigh as long before them, and yet neither the
one nor the other with the like success as Luther. And yet,â saith he,
âmany are already gathered into the kingdom of Christ; and the nearness
of many more throughout the whole land (for the regions are white unto
the harvest) doth promise within less than a hundred years, if our
sins and theirs make not us and them unworthy of this mercy, a very
plenteous harvestâ (
Justif.
folio 62); as if he had prophesied
of these times. Yea, some of us have often heard him say that âeven
those ministers and other godly persons that did then most sharply
oppose them, if they might come to be from under the bishops, and live
in a place of rest and peace, where they might comfortably subsist,
they would practise the same things which they now did.â And truly,
many of us have seen this abundantly verified, not only in these latter
times, but formerly.

Doctor Ames was estranged from and opposed Mr. Robinson; and yet
afterwards there was loving compliance and near agreement
[Pg 6]
between
them; and, which is more strange, Mr. Johnson himself, who was
afterwards pastor of the church of God at Amsterdam, was a preacher to
the company of English of the Staple at Middleburg, in Zealand, and
had great and certain maintenance allowed him by them, and was highly
respected of them, and so zealous against this way as that [when] Mr.
Barrowâs and Mr. Greenwoodâs Refutation of Gifford was privately in
printing in this city, he not only was a means to discover it, but was
made the ambassadorâs instrument to intercept them at the press, and
see them burnt; the which charge he did so well perform, as he let them
go on until they were wholly finished, and then surprised the whole
impression, not suffering any to escape; and then, by the magistratesâ
authority, caused them all to be openly burnt, himself standing by
until they were all consumed to ashes. Only he took up two of them, one
to keep in his own study, that he might see their errors, and the other
to bestow on a special friend for the like use. But mark the sequel.
When he had done this work, he went home, and being set down in his
study, he began to turn over some pages of this book, and superficially
to read some things here and there, as his fancy led him. At length
he met with something that began to work upon his spirit, which so
wrought with him as drew him to this resolution, seriously to read
over the whole book: the which he did once and again. In the end he
was so taken, and his conscience was troubled so, as he could have no
rest in himself until he crossed the seas and came to London to confer
with the authors, who were then in prison, and shortly after executed.
After which conference he was so satisfied and confirmed in the truth,
as he never returned to his place any more at Middleburg, but adjoined
himself to their society at London, and was afterwards committed
to prison, and then banished; and in conclusion coming to live at
Amsterdam, he caused the same books, which he had been an instrument to
burn, to be new printed and set out at his own charge. And some of us
here present testify this to be a true relation, which we heard from
his own mouth before many witnesses.

Young men.
âWe have seen a book of Mr. Robert Baylieâs, a
Scotchman, wherein he seemeth to take notice of the spreading of the
truth under the notion of error, and casts all the disgraces he can
on it, and ranks it with others the foulest errors of the time, and
endeavours to show how like a small spark it revived out of the ashes,
and was brought from Leyden over the seas into New England, and there
nourished with much
[Pg 7]
silence until it spread to other places in the
country, and by eminent hands from thence into Old England.

Ancient men.
âAs we dare say Mr. Baylie intends no honor to
the persons by what he says, either to those here or from whence they
came, so are they far from seeking any to themselves, but rather are
ashamed that their weak working hath brought no more glory to God; and
if in any thing God hath made any of them instruments for the good of
his people in any measure, they desire he only may have the glory. And
whereas Mr. Baylie affirmeth that, however it was, in a few years the
most who settled in the land did agree to model themselves after Mr.
Robinsonâs pattern, we agree with reverend Mr. Cotton, that âthere was
no agreement by any solemn or common consultation; but that it is true
they did, as if they had agreed, by the same spirit of truth and unity,
set up, by the help of Christ, the same model of churches, one like to
another; and if they of Plymouth have helped any of the first comers in
their theory, by hearing and discerning their practices, therein the
Scripture is fulfilled that the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven
which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until all was
leavened.â Answer to Mr. Baylie, page 17.

Young men.
âWe desire to know how many have been put to death
for this cause, and what manner of persons they were, and what
occasions were taken against them by bringing them to their end.

Ancient men.
âWe know certainly of six that were publicly
executed, besides such as died in prisons; Mr. Henry Barrow, Mr.
Greenwood (these suffered at Tyburn); Mr. Penry at St. Thomas
Waterings, by London; Mr. William Dennis, at Thetford, in Norfolk;
two others at St. Edmundâs, in Suffolk, whose names were Copping and
Elias [Thacker]. These two last mentioned were condemned by cruel Judge
Popham, whose countenance and carriage was very rough and severe toward
them, with many sharp menaces. But God gave them courage to bear it,
and to make this answer:

âMy Lord, your face we fear not,

And for your threats we care not,

And to come to your read service, we dare not.â

These two last named were put to death for dispersing of books.

For Mr. Dennis, he was a godly man, and faithful in his
[Pg 8]
place; but
what occasion was taken against him, we know not, more than the common
cause.

For Mr. Penry, how unjustly he was charged, himself hath made manifest
to the world in his books, and that Declaration which he made a little
before his suffering; all which are extant in print, with some of his
godly letters.

As for Mr. Barrow and Mr. Greenwood, it also appears by their own
writings how those statutes formerly made against the Papists were
wrested against them, and they condemned thereupon; as may be seen by
their Examinations.

Young men.
âBut these were rigid Brownists, and lie under much
aspersion, and their names much blemished and beclouded, not only by
enemies, but even by godly and very reverend men.

Ancient men.
âThey can no more justly be called Brownists, than
the disciples might have been called Judasites; for they did as much
abhor Brownâs apostasy, and profane course, and his defection, as the
disciples and other Christians did Judasâs treachery.

And for their rigid and roughness of spirit, as some of them,
especially Mr. Barrow, is taxed, it may be considered they were very
rigidly and roughly dealt with, not only by the Lordâs enemies and
their enemies, but by some godly persons of those times, differing in
opinions from them; which makes some of us call to mind what one Doctor
Taylor hath written in a late book in these stirring times. âSuch an
eminent man,â saith he, âhath had the good hap to be reputed orthodox
by posterity, and did condemn such a man of such an opinion, and yet
himself erred in as considerable matters; but meeting with better
neighbours in his life-time, and a more charitable posterity after his
death, hath his memory preserved in honor; and the otherâs name suffers
without cause.â Of which he gives instances in his book entitled The
Liberty of Prophesying, page 33 and following.

We refer you to Mr. Robinsonâs Answer to Mr. Bernard, where he charges
him with blasphemy, railing, scoffing, &c. âFor Mr. Barrow,â saith
Mr. Robinson, âas I say with Mr. Ainsworth, that I will not justify
all the words of another man, nor yet mine own, so say I also with
Mr. Smith, that because I know not by what particular motion of the
Spirit he was guided to write in those phrases, I dare not censure him
as you do; especially considering with what fiery zeal the Lord hath
furnished such his servants at all times, as he hath stirred up for
special reformation. Let the example of Luther alone
[Pg 9]
suffice, whom
into what terms his zeal carried, his writings testify; and yet both in
him and in Mr. Barrow there might be with true spiritual zeal fleshly
indignation mingled.â Answer to Mr. Bernard, folio 84.

And further in page 86 he saith, that âsuch harsh terms wherewith he
entertains such persons and things in the church as carry with them
most appearance of holiness, they are to be interpreted according to
his meaning, with this distinction, that Mr. Barrow speaks not of these
persons and things simply, but in a respect, and so and so considered;
and so no one term given by Mr. Barrow but may, at the least, be
tolerated.â

Young men.
âBut divers reverend men have expressed concerning
this matter that God is not wont to make choice of men infamous for
gross sins and vices before their calling, to make them any instruments
of reformation after their calling, and proceed to declare that Mr.
Barrow was a great gamester and a dicer when he lived in court, and
getting much by play, would boast of loose spending it with courtesans,
&c.

Ancient men.
âTruly, with due respect to such reverend men be
it spoken, those things might well have been spared from putting in
print, especially so long after his death, when not only he, but all
his friends are taken out of the world, that might vindicate his name.
That he was tainted with vices at the court before his conversion and
calling, it is not very strange; and if he had lived and died in that
condition, it is like he might have gone out of the world without any
public brand on his name, and have passed for a tolerable Christian and
member of the church. He had hurt enough done him, whilst he lived, by
evil and cruel enemies; why should godly men be prejudicated to him
after his death in his name? Was not the Apostle Paul a persecutor of
Godâs saints unto death? And doth not the same Apostle, speaking of
scandalous and lascivious persons, say, âAnd such were some of you; but
ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name
of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God.â

And if histories deceive us not, was not Cyprian a magician before his
conversion, and Augustine a ManichÃ¦an? And when it was said unto him
in the voice he heard,
Tolle et lege
, he was directed to that
place of Scripture, âNot in gluttony and drunkenness, nor in chambering
and wantonness, nor in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and take no thought for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts of it.â
By which it may seem that if God do not make choice of such men as have
been infamous for gross vices before their calling,
[Pg 10]
yet sometimes he
is wont to do it, and is free to choose whom he pleaseth for notable
instruments for his own work. As for other things that have been spoken
of him and Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Penry, we leave them as they are.
But some of us have reason to think there are some mistakes in the
relations of those things. Only we shall add other public testimonies
concerning them from witnesses of very worthy credit, which are also in
print.

First, from Mr. Phillips. A famous and godly preacher, having heard
and seen Mr. Barrowâs holy speeches and preparations for death, said,
âBarrow, Barrow, my soul be with thine!â The same author also reports,
that Queen Elizabeth asked learned Doctor Reynolds what he thought
of those two men, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Greenwood; and he answered
her Majesty that it could not avail any thing to show his judgment
concerning them, seeing they were put to death; and being loath to
speak his mind further, her Majesty charged him upon his allegiance
to speak. Whereupon he answered, that he was persuaded, if they had
lived, they would have been two as worthy instruments for the church
of God, as have been raised up in this age. Her Majesty sighed, and
said no more. But after that, riding to a park by the place where they
were executed, and being willing to take further information concerning
them, demanded of the right honorable the Earl of Cumberland, that was
present when they suffered, what end they made. He answered, âa very
godly end, and prayed for your Majesty, and the State,â &c. We may also
add what some of us have heard by credible information, that the Queen
demanded of the Archbishop what he thought of them in his conscience.
He answered âhe thought they were the servants of God, but dangerous
to the State.â âAlas!â said she, âshall we put the servants of God to
death?â And this was the true cause why no more of them were put to
death in her days.

Young men.
âDid any of you know Mr. Barrow? if we may be so
bold to ask, for we would willingly know what [was] his life and
conversation; because some, we perceive, have him in precious esteem,
and others can scarce name him without some note of obloquy and dislike.

Ancient men.
âWe have not seen his person; but some of us have
been well acquainted with those that knew him familiarly both before
and after his conversion; and one of us hath had conference with one
that was his domestic servant, and tended upon him both before and some
while after the same.

He was a gentleman of good worth, and a flourishing courtier
[Pg 11]
in his
time, and, as appears in his own answers to the Archbishop and Doctor
Cousens, he was some time a student at Cambridge and the Inns of Court,
and accomplished with strong parts.

We have heard his conversion to be on this wise. Walking in London
one Lordâs day with one of his companions, he heard a preacher at his
sermon very loud, as they passed by the church. Upon which Mr. Barrow
said unto his consort, âLet us go in and hear what this man saith that
is thus earnest.â âTush,â said the other, âwhat! shall we go to hear
a man talk?â &c. But in he went and sat down. And the minister was
vehement in reproving sin, and sharply applied the judgments of God
against the same; and, it should seem, touched him to the quick in
such things as he was guilty of, so as God set it home to his soul,
and began to work his repentance and conversion thereby. For he was so
stricken as he could not be quiet, until by conference with godly men
and further hearing of the word, with diligent reading and meditation,
God brought peace to his soul and conscience, after much humiliation
of heart and reformation of life; so as he left the court, and retired
himself to a private life, some time in the country and some time in
the city, giving himself to study and reading of the Scriptures and
other good works very diligently. And being missed at court by his
consorts and acquaintance, it was quickly bruited abroad that Barrow
was turned Puritan. What his course was afterwards, his writings show,
as also his sufferings and conference with men of all sorts do declare,
until his life was taken from him.

And thus much we can further affirm, from those that well knew him,
that he was very comfortable to the poor and those in distress in
their sufferings; and when he saw he must die, he gave a stock for
the relief of the poor of the church, which was a good help to them
in their banished condition afterwards. Yea, and that which some will
hardly believe, he did much persuade them to peace, and composed
many differences that were grown amongst them whilst he lived, and
would have, it is like, prevented more that after fell out, if he had
continued.

Young men.
âWe thank you for your pains. We hope it will extend
further than our satisfaction. We cannot but marvel that such a man
should be by so many aspersed.

Ancient men.
âIt is not much to be marvelled at; for he was
most plain in discovering the cruelty, fraud, and hypocrisy of the
enemies of the truth, and searching into the corruptions of the time,
which made him abhorred of them; and peradventure
[Pg 12]
something too harsh
against the haltings of divers of the preachers and professors that
he had to deal with in those times, who out of fear or weakness did
not come so close up to the truth in their practice as their doctrines
and grounds seemed to hold forth. Which makes us remember what was the
answer of Erasmus to the Duke of Saxony, when he asked his opinion
whether Luther had erred. He answered, âhis opinions were good, but
wished he would moderate his style, which stirred him up the more
enemies, no doubt.â

Young men.
âWe find in the writings of some such who were
very eminent in their times for piety and learning, that those of
the Separation found more favor in our native country than those who
were reproached by the name of Puritans; and after much discourse
thereabouts, come to this conclusion, that no comparison will hold from
the Separatists to them in their sufferings but
a minori
; and
then they go on and say, what a compulsory banishment has been put upon
those blessed and glorious lights, Mr. Cartwright, Mr. Parker, Doctor
Ames, &c.

Ancient men.
âFar be it from any of us to detract from or to
extenuate the sufferings of any of the servants of God, much less from
those worthies forenamed, or any others afterwards mentioned. Yet,
under favor, we crave pardon if we cannot consent to the judgment of
such eminent ones for piety and learning above hinted. We doubt not,
but do easily grant, that the sufferings of those reproached by the
name of Puritans were great, especially some of them, and were better
known to those pious and learned [men] first above intimated, than the
sufferings of those that are reproached by the name of Brownists and
Separatists. But we shall give you some instances, and leave it to you
and some others to consider of.

1. Though no more were publicly executed, yet sundry more were
condemned, and brought to the gallows, and ascended the ladder, not
knowing but they should die, and have been reprieved, and after
banished; some of which we have known and often spoken with.

2. Others have not only been forced into voluntary banishment, by great
numbers, to avoid further cruelty, but divers, after long and sore
imprisonment, have been forced to abjure the land by oath, never to
return without leave. In anno 1604 four persons at once were forced to
do so at a public Sessions in London, or else upon refusal they were to
be hanged. This their abjuration was done on the statute of the 35 of
Queen Elizabeth. Some of these we have also known.

3. We find mention in a printed book of seventeen or eighteen
[Pg 13]
that
have died in several prisons in London in six yearsâ time before the
year 1592, besides what have been in other parts of the land, and since
that time, perishing by cold, hunger, or noisomeness of the prison.

4. In the same year we find a lamentable petition, now in print, of
sixty persons committed unbailable to several prisons in London,
as Newgate, the Gatehouse, Clink, &c., being made close prisoners,
allowing them neither meat, drink, nor lodging, nor suffering any whose
hearts the Lord would stir up for their relief, to have any access
unto them; so as they complain that no felons, traitors, nor murderers
in the land were thus dealt with; and so after many other grievous
complaints conclude with these words: âWe crave for all of us but the
liberty either to die openly, or to live openly in the land of our
nativity. If we deserve death, it beseemeth the majesty of justice not
to see us closely murdered, yea starved to death with hunger and cold,
and stifled in loathsome dungeons. If we be guiltless, we crave but the
benefit of our innocence, viz. that we may have peace to serve our God
and our Prince in the place of the sepulchres of our fathers.â

And what numbers since those, who have been put unto compulsory
banishment and other hard sufferings, as loss of goods, friends, and
long and hard imprisonments, under which many have died,âit is so well
known, that it would make up a volume to rehearse them, and would not
only equalize but far exceed the number of those godly called Puritans
that have suffered. Suppose they were but few of them ministers that
suffered, as above expressed; yet their sorrows might be as great,
and their wants more, and their souls as much afflicted, because more
contemned and neglected of men.

But some have said
they
were excommunicated; and that was
no great matter as excommunications went in those days. So were

these
, not only while they were living, but some of them many
times after they were dead; and as some of the other were imprisoned,
so were more of these. But it is further said, all of them were
deprived of their ministry; and so were these of their livelihood and
maintenance, although they had no offices to lose. But those remained
still in the land, and were succoured and sheltered by good people in
a competent wise, the most of them, and sundry of them lived as well,
as may easily be proved, if not better, than if they had enjoyed their
benefices; whereas the other were, a great number of them, forced
to fly into foreign lands for shelter, or else might have perished
in prisons; and these poor creatures endured,
[Pg 14]
many of them, such
hardships (as is well known to some of us) as makes our hearts still
ache to remember.

We some of us knew Mr. Parker, Dr. Ames, and Mr. Jacob in Holland, when
they sojourned for a time in Leyden; and all three boarded together
and had their victuals dressed by some of our acquaintance, and then
they lived comfortable, and then they were provided for as became their
persons. And after Mr. Jacob returned, and Mr. Parker was at Amsterdam,
where he printed some of his books, and Mr. Ames disposed of himself
to other places, it was not worse with him; and some of us well know
how it fared then with many precious Christians in divers times and
places. To speak the truth, the professors in England, though many of
them suffered much at the hands of the prelates, yet they had a great
advantage of the Separatists; for the Separatists had not only the
prelates and their faction to encounter with (and what hard measure
they met with at their hands, above the other, doth sufficiently appear
by what is before declared), but also they must endure the frowns,
and many times the sharp invectives, of the forward ministers against
them, both in public and private; and what influence they had upon the
spirits of the people, is well enough known also; by reason hereof the
ministers in foreign countries did look awry at them when they would
give help and countenance to the other.

Young men.
âIndeed, it seems they have sometimes suffered much
hardness in the Low Countries, if that be true that is reported of such
a man as Mr. Ainsworth, that he should live for some time with nine
pence a week. To which is replied by another, that if people suffered
him to live on nine pence a week, with roots boiled, either the people
were grown extreme low in estate, or the growth of their godliness was
come to a very low ebb.

Ancient men.
âThe truth is, their condition for the most part
was for some time very low and hard. It was with them as, if it should
be related, would hardly be believed. And no marvel. For many of them
had lain long in prisons, and then were banished into Newfoundland,
where they were abused, and at last came into the Low Countries, and
wanting money, trades, friends or acquaintances, and languages to help
themselves, how could it be otherwise? The report of Mr. Ainsworth was
near those times, when he was newly come out of Ireland with others
poor, and being a single young man and very studious, was content
with a little. And yet, to take off the aspersion from the people in
that particular, the chief and true reason
[Pg 15]
thereof is mistaken; for
he was a very modest and bashful man, and concealed his wants from
others, until some suspected how it was with him, and pressed him to
see how it was; and after it was known, such as were able mended his
condition; and when he was married afterwards, he and his family were
comfortably provided for. But we have said enough of these things.
They had few friends to comfort them, nor any arm of flesh to support
them; and if in some things they were too rigid, they are rather to be
pitied, considering their times and sufferings, than to be blasted with
reproach to posterity.

Young men.
âWas that Brown that fell away and made apostasy, the
first inventor and beginner of this way?

Ancient men.
âNo, verily; for, as one answers this question very
well in a printed book, almost forty years ago, that the prophets,
apostles, and evangelists have in their authentic writings laid down
the ground thereof; and upon that ground is their building reared up
and surely settled. Moreover, many of the martyrs, both former and
latter, have maintained it, as is to be seen in The Acts and Monuments
of the Church. Also, in the days of Queen Elizabeth there was a
separated church, whereof Mr. Fitts was pastor, and another before that
in the time of Queen Mary, of which Mr. Rough was pastor or teacher,
and Cudbert Simpson a deacon, who exercised amongst themselves, as
other ordinances, so church censures, as excommunication, etc., and
professed and practised that cause before Mr. Brown wrote for it. But
he being one that afterwards wrote for it, they that first hatched
the name of Puritans and bestowed it on the godly professors that
desired reformation, they likewise out of the same storehouse would
needs bestow this new livery upon others that never would own it,
nor had reason so to do. Mr. Cotton, likewise, in his Answer to Mr.
Baylie, page fourth, shows how in the year 1567 there were a hundred
persons who refused the common liturgy, and the congregations attending
thereunto, and used prayers and preaching and the sacraments amongst
themselves, whereof fourteen or fifteen were sent to prison, of
whom the chiefest were Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon, James Ireland, Robert
Hawkins, Thomas Rowland, and Richard Morecroft; and these pleaded their
separation before the Lord Mayor, Bishop Sands, and other commissioners
on June 20, 1567, about eighty years ago, being many years before
Brown. Divers other instances might be given.

Young men.
âBut if we mistake not, Mr. Brown is accounted by
some of good note to be the inventor of that way which is
[Pg 16]
called
Brownism, from whom the sect took its name. Moreover, it is said by
such of note as aforesaid, that it is not Godâs usual manner of dealing
to leave any of the first publishers or restorers of any truth of his
to such fearful apostasy.

Ancient men.
âPossibly this speech might arise from a common
received opinion. But reverend Mr. Cotton, in his Answer to Mr. Baylie,
saith âthe backsliding of Brown from that way of Separation is a
just reason why the Separatists may disclaim denomination from him,
and refuse to be called Brownists, after his name; and to speak with
reason,â saith he, âif any be justly to be called Brownists, it is
only such as revolt from Separation to formality, and from thence to
profaneness.â Page 5.

To which we may add, that it is very injurious to call those after
his name, whose person they never knew, and whose writings few if
any of them ever saw, and whose errors and back-slidings they have
constantly borne witness against; and what truths they have received
have been from the light of Godâs sacred word, conveyed by other godly
instruments unto them; though Brown may sometimes have professed some
of the same things, and now fallen from the same, as many others have
done.

Young men.
âSeeing we have presumed thus far to inquire into
these ancienter times of you, and of the sufferings of the aforesaid
persons, we would likewise entreat you, though never so briefly, to
tell us something of the persons and carriages of other eminent men
about those times, or immediately after, as Mr. Francis Johnson, Mr.
Henry Ainsworth, Mr. John Smith, Mr. John Robinson, Mr. Richard Clifton.

Ancient men.
âHere are some in the company that knew them all
familiarly, whom we shall desire to satisfy your request.

Those answered, We shall do it most willingly; for we cannot but honor
the memory of the men for the good that not only many others but we
ourselves have received by them and their ministry; for we have heard
them all, and lived under the ministry of divers of them for some
years. We shall therefore speak of them in order briefly.

Mr.
Johnson
, of whom something was spoken before, was pastor
of the church of God at Amsterdam. A very grave man he was, and an
able teacher, and was the most solemn in all his administrations
that we have seen any, and especially in dispensing the seals of the
covenant, both baptism and the Lordâs supper. And a good disputant he
was. We heard Mr.
[Pg 17]
Smith upon occasion say, that he was persuaded no
men living were able to maintain a cause against those two men, meaning
Mr. Johnson and Mr. Ainsworth, if they had not the truth on their side.
He, by reason of many dissensions that fell out in the church, and the
subtilty of one of the elders of the same, came after many years to
alter his judgment about the government of the church, and his practice
thereupon, which caused a division amongst them. But he lived not many
years after, and died at Amsterdam after his return from Embden.

Young men.
âBut he is much spoken against for excommunicating
his brother and his own father, and maintaining his wifeâs cause, who
was by his brother and others reproved for her pride in apparel.

Ancient men.
âHimself hath often made his own defence, and
others for him. The church did, after long patience towards them and
much pains taken with them, excommunicate them for their unreasonable
and endless opposition, and such things as did accompany the same; and
such was the justice thereof, as he could not but consent thereto.
In our time his wife was a grave matron, and very modest both in her
apparel and all her demeanour, ready to any good works in her place,
and helpful to many, especially the poor, and an ornament to his
calling. She was a young widow when he married her, and had been a
merchantâs wife, by whom he had a good estate, and was a godly woman;
and because she wore such apparel as she had been formerly used
to, which were neither excessive nor immodest, for their chiefest
exceptions were against her wearing of some whalebone in the bodice
and sleeves of her gown, corked shoes, and other such like things as
the citizens of her rank then used to wear. And although, for offence
sake, she and he were willing to reform the fashions of them so far as
might be without spoiling of their garments, yet it would not content
them except they came full up to their size. Such was the strictness or
rigidness (as now the term goes) of some in those times, as we can by
experience and of our own knowledge show in other instances. We shall
for brevity sake only show one.

We were in the company of a godly man that had been a long time
prisoner at Norwich for this cause, and was by Judge Cooke set at
liberty. After going into the country he visited his friends, and
returning that way again to go into the Low Countries by ship at
Yarmouth, and so desired some of us to turn in with him to the house
of an ancient woman in the city, who had been very kind and helpful to
him in his sufferings. She knowing his voice made him very welcome,
and those with
[Pg 18]
him. But after some time of their entertainment, being
ready to depart, she came up to him and felt of his band (for her eyes
were dim with age), and perceiving it was something stiffened with
starch, she was much displeased, and reproved him very sharply, fearing
God would not prosper his journey. Yet the man was a plain countryman,
clad in gray russet, without either welt or guard (as the proverb
is), and the band he wore scarce worth threepence, made of their own
homespinning; and he was godly and humble as he was plain. What would
such professors, if they were now living, say to the excess of our
times?

Mr.
Henry Ainsworth
, a man of a thousand, was teacher of this
church at Amsterdam at the same time when Mr. Johnson was pastor. Two
worthy men they were and of excellent parts. He continued constant
in his judgment and practice unto his end in those things about the
church government, from which Mr. Johnson swerved and fell. He ever
maintained good correspondence with Mr. Robinson at Leyden, and would
consult with him in all matters of weight, both in their differences
and afterwards. A very learned man he was, and a close student, which
much impaired his health. We have heard some, eminent in the knowledge
of the tongues, of the university of Leyden, say that they thought he
had not his better for the Hebrew tongue in the university, nor scarce
in Europe. He was a man very modest, amiable, and sociable in his
ordinary course and carriage, of an innocent and unblamable life and
conversation, of a meek spirit, and a calm temper, void of passion and
not easily provoked. And yet he would be something smart in his style
to his opposers in his public writings; at which we that have seen his
constant carriage, both in public disputes and the managing of all
church affairs, and such like occurrences, have sometimes marvelled.
He had an excellent gift of teaching and opening the Scriptures; and
things did flow from him with that facility, plainness, and sweetness,
as did much affect the hearers. He was powerful and profound in
doctrine, although his voice was not strong; and had this excellency
above many, that he was most ready and pregnant in the Scriptures, as
if the book of God had been written in his heart; being as ready in
his quotations, without tossing and turning his book, as if they had
lain open before his eyes, and seldom missing a word in the citing of
any place, teaching not only the word and doctrine of God, but in the
words of God, and for the most part in a continued phrase and words
of Scripture. He used great dexterity, and was ready in comparing
Scripture with Scripture, one with another. In a word, the
[Pg 19]
times and
place in which he lived were not worthy of such a man.

Young men.
âBut we find that he is taxed, in a book writ by
George Johnson, with apostasy and to be a man-pleaser, etc.

Ancient men.
âWho can escape the scourge of tongues? Christ
himself could not do it when he was here upon earth, although there was
no guile found in his mouth; nor Moses, although he was the meekest
man in the earth. For man-pleasing, they that tax him [do it] because
he concurred against their violent and endless dissensions about the
former matters. And for his apostasy, this was all the matter. When he
was a young man, before he came out of England, he at the persuasion of
some of his godly friends went once or twice to hear a godly minister
preach; and this was the great matter of apostasy, for which those
violent men thought him worthy to be deposed from his place, and for
which they thus charge him. And truly herein they may worthily bear the
name of rigid, etc.

Mr.
John Smith
was an eminent man in his time, and a good
preacher, and of other good parts; but his inconstancy, and unstable
judgment, and being so suddenly carried away with things, did soon
overthrow him. Yet we have some of us heard him use this speech:
âTruly,â said he, âwe being now come into a place of liberty, are in
great danger, if we look not well to our ways; for we are like men set
upon the ice, and therefore may easily slide and fall.â But in this
example it appears it is an easier matter to give good counsel than to
follow it, to foresee danger than to prevent it: which made the prophet
to say, âO Lord, the way of man is not in himself, neither is it in man
to walk and to direct his steps.â He was some time pastor to a company
of honest and godly men which came with him out of England, and pitched
at Amsterdam. He first fell into some errors about the Scriptures,
and so into some opposition with Mr. Johnson, who had been his tutor,
and the church there. But he was convinced of them by the pains and
faithfulness of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Ainsworth, and revoked them; but
afterwards was drawn away by some of the Dutch Anabaptists, who finding
him to be a good scholar and unsettled, they easily misled the most of
his people, and other of them scattered away. He lived not many years
after, but died there of a consumption, to which he was inclined before
he came out of England. His and his peopleâs condition may be an object
of pity for after times.

Mr.
John Robinson
was pastor of that famous church of Leyden,
in Holland; a man not easily to be paralleled for all
[Pg 20]
things, whose
singular virtues we shall not take upon us here to describe. Neither
need we, for they so well are known both by friends and enemies. As
he was a man learned and of solid judgment, and of a quick and sharp
wit, so was he also of a tender conscience, and very sincere in all his
ways, a hater of hypocrisy and dissimulation, and would be very plain
with his best friends. He was very courteous, affable, and sociable
in his conversation, and towards his own people especially. He was
an acute and expert disputant, very quick and ready, and had much
bickering with the Arminians, who stood more in fear of him than any of
the university. He was never satisfied in himself until he had searched
any cause or argument he had to deal in thoroughly and to the bottom;
and we have heard him sometimes say to his familiars that many times,
both in writing and disputation, he knew he had sufficiently answered
others, but many times not himself; and was ever desirous of any light,
and the more able, learned, and holy the persons were, the more he
desired to confer and reason with them. He was very profitable in his
ministry and comfortable to his people. He was much beloved of them,
and as loving was he unto them, and entirely sought their good for soul
and body. In a word, he was much esteemed and reverenced of all that
knew him, and his abilities [were acknowledged] both of friends and
strangers. But we resolved to be brief in this matter, leaving you to
better and more large information herein from others.

Mr.
Richard Clifton
was a grave and fatherly old man when he
came first into Holland, having a great white beard; and pity it was
that such a reverend old man should be forced to leave his country,
and at those years to go into exile. But it was his lot; and he bore
it patiently. Much good had he done in the country where he lived, and
converted many to God by his faithful and painful ministry, both in
preaching and catechizing. Sound and orthodox he always was, and so
continued to his end. He belonged to the church at Leyden; but being
settled at Amsterdam, and thus aged, he was loath to remove any more;
and so when they removed, he was dismissed to them there, and there
remained until he died. Thus have we briefly satisfied your desire.

Young men.
âWe are very thankful to you for your pains. We
perceive God raiseth up excellent instruments in all ages to carry on
his own work; and the best of men have their failings sometimes, as we
see in these our times, and that there is no new thing under the sun.
But before we end this matter, we
[Pg 21]
desire you would say something of
those two churches that were so long in exile, of whose guides we have
already heard.

Ancient men.
âTruly there were in them many worthy men; and if
you had seen them in their beauty and order, as we have done, you would
have been much affected therewith, we dare say. At Amsterdam, before
their division and breach, they were about three hundred communicants,
and they had for their pastor and teacher those two eminent men before
named, and in our time four grave men for ruling elders, and three able
and godly men for deacons, one ancient widow for a deaconess, who did
them service many years, though she was sixty years of age when she was
chosen. She honored her place and was an ornament to the congregation.
She usually sat in a convenient place in the congregation, with a
little birchen rod in her hand, and kept little children in great awe
from disturbing the congregation. She did frequently visit the sick and
weak, especially women, and, as there was need, called out maids and
young women to watch and do them other helps as their necessity did
require; and if they were poor, she would gather relief for them of
those that were able, or acquaint the deacons; and she was obeyed as a
mother in Israel and an officer of Christ.

And for the church of Leyden, they were sometimes not much fewer in
number, nor at all inferior in able men, though they had not so many
officers as the other; for they had but one ruling elder with their
pastor, a man well approved and of great integrity; also they had three
able men for deacons. And that which was a crown unto them, they lived
together in love and peace all their days, without any considerable
differences or any disturbance that grew thereby, but such as was
easily healed in love; and so they continued until with mutual consent
they removed into New England. And what their condition hath been
since, some of you that are of their children do see and can tell. Many
worthy and able men there were in both places, who lived and died in
obscurity in respect of the world, as private Christians, yet were they
precious in the eyes of the Lord, and also in the eyes of such as knew
them, whose virtues we with such of you as are their children do follow
and imitate.

Young men.
âIf we may not be tedious, we would request to know
one thing more. It is commonly said that those of the Separation hold
none to be true churches but their own, and condemn all the churches in
the world besides; which lieth as a foul blot upon them, yea even on
some here in New England, except they can remove it.

[Pg 22]

Ancient men.
âIt is a manifest slander laid upon them; for they
hold all the Reformed Churches to be true churches, and even the most
rigid of them have ever done so, as appears by their Apologies and
other writings; and we ourselves some of us know of much intercommunion
that divers have held with them reciprocally, not only with the Dutch
and French, but even with the Scotch, who are not of the best mould,
yea and with the Lutherans also; and we believe they have gone as far
herein, both in judgment and practice, as any of the churches in New
England do or can do, to deal faithfully and bear witness against their
corruptions.

Having thus far satisfied all your demands, we shall here break off
this conference for this time, desiring the Lord to make you to grow up
in grace and wisdom and the true fear of God, that in all faithfulness
and humility you may serve him in your generations.

Young men.
âGentlemen, we humbly thank you for your pains
with us and respect unto us, and do further crave that upon any fit
occasions we may have access unto you for any further information, and
herewith do humbly take our leave.

The Pilgrimsâ Arrival at Cape Cod.

From Bradfordâs History.

Being thus arived in a good harbor and brought safe to land, they
fell upon their knees & blessed y
e
God of heaven, who had brought
them over y
e
vast & furious ocean, and delivered them from all y
e

periles & miseries thereof, againe to set their feete on y
e
firme and
stable earth, their proper elemente. And no marvell if they were thus
joyefull, seeing wise Seneca was so affected with sailing a few miles
on y
e
coast of his owne Italy; as he affirmed, that he had rather
remaine twentie years on his way by land, then pass by sea to any place
in a short time; so tedious & dreadfull was y
e
same unto him.

But hear I cannot but stay and make a pause, and stand half amased
at this poore peoples presente condition; and so I thinke will the
reader too, when he well considers y
e
same. Being thus passed y
e

vast ocean, and a sea of troubles before in their preparation (as may
be remembered by y
t
which wente before), they had now no freinds to
wellcome them, nor inns to entertaine or refresh their weatherbeaten
bodys, no houses or much less townes to repaire too, to seeke for

[Pg 23]
succoure. It is recorded in scripture as a mercie to y
e
apostle & his
shipwraked company, y
t
the barbarians shewed them no smale kindnes in
refreshing them, but these savage barbarians, when they mette with them
(as after will appeare) were readier to fill their sids full of arrows
then otherwise. And for y
e
season it was winter, and they that know
y
e
winters of y
t
cuntrie know them to be sharp & violent, & subjecte
to cruell & feirce stormes, deangerous to travill to known places,
much more to serch an unknown coast. Besids, what could they see but a
hidious & desolate wildernes, full of wild beasts & willd men? and what
multituds ther might be of them they knew not. Nether could they, as it
were, goe up to y
e
tope of Pisgah, to vew from this willdernes a more
goodly cuntrie to feed their hops; for which way soever they turned
their eys (save upward to y
e
heavens) they could have litle solace
or content in respecte of any outward objects. For sumer being done,
all things stand upon them with a wetherbeaten face; and y
e
whole
countrie, full of woods & thickets, represented a wild & savage heiw.
If they looked behind them, ther was y
e
mighty ocean which they had
passed, and was now as a maine barr & goulfe to seperate them from all
y
e
civill parts of y
e
world. If it be said they had a ship to sucour
them, it is trew; but what heard they daly from y
e
m
r
. & company?
but y
t
with speede they should looke out a place with their shallop,
wher they would be at some near distance; for ye season was shuch as he
would not stirr from thence till a safe harbor was discovered by them
wher they would be, and he might goe without danger; and that victells
consumed apace, but he must & would keepe sufficient for them selves
& their returne. Yea, it was muttered by some, that if they gott not
a place in time, they would turne them & their goods ashore & leave
them. Let it also be considred what weake hopes of supply & succoure
they left behinde them, y
t
might bear up their minds in this sade
condition and trialls they were under; and they could not but be very
smale. It is true, indeed, y
e
affections & love of their brethren at
Leyden was cordiall & entire towards them, but they had litle power to
help them, or them selves; and how y
e
case stode betweene them & y
e

marchants at their coming away, hath allready been declared. What could
now sustaine them but y
e
spirite of God & his grace? May not & ought
not the children of these fathers rightly say:
Our faithers were
Englishmen which came over this great ocean, and were ready to perish
in this willdernes; but they cried unto y
e
Lord, and he heard their
voyce, and looked on their adversitie, &c. Let them
[Pg 24]
therefore praise
y
e
Lord, because he is good, & his mercies endure for ever. Yea, let
them which have been redeemed of y
e
Lord, shew how he hath delivered
them from y
e
hand of y
e
oppressour. When they wandered in y
e
deserte
wildernes out of y
e
way, and found no citie to dwell in, both hungrie,
& thirstie, their sowle was overwhelmed in them. Let them confess
before y
e
Lord his loving kindnes, and his wonderfull works before y
e

sons of men.

William Bradford, the great governor of the Plymouth colony,
was born at Austerfield, a little village in Yorkshire, in

1588, the same year (the year of the Spanish Armada) that John
Winthrop, the great governor of the Massachusetts colony, was
born at Groton, in Suffolk. While yet a youth, he became a
member of Brewsterâs little congregation at Scrooby, near by;
and in 1608 he escaped with the others to Holland, and became a
leading member of the church at Leyden, taking an active part
in the removal to New England in 1620. Upon Carverâs death,
in 1621, he was elected to succeed him as governor; and he
continued to hold this office, with two slight breaks, to the
time of his death, in 1657.

No other person understood so well the history of the Plymouth
colony. It is therefore singularly fortunate that he became
the colonyâs historian,âas, similarly, Gov. Winthrop became
the historian of the Massachusetts colony. His âHistory of the
Plymouth Plantationâ may properly be called our New England
Old Testament,âthe Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, and Judges of the
Plymouth settlement. The remarkable story of the loss of the
MS. from the Old South Meeting-house, where it was preserved
in the Prince Library, at the time of the British Evacuation
of Boston, and its discovery in the Bishop of Londonâs library
at Fulham in 1855, has been told by Charles Deane in his
introduction to the volume, published by the Massachusetts
Historical Society, and in the
Proceedings
of the
Society, 1855 and 1882; also, more fully, by Justin Winsor, in
the
Proceedings
for 1882. It is an interesting fact that
the third volume of Winthropâs History, long lost, was found,
in 1816, in the tower of the Old South Meeting-house, where,
like Bradfordâs History, it had been kept in Princeâs New
England Library.

Bradfordâs Letter Book, containing copies of important letters
addressed to him, was lost, like his History. Fragments were
rescued in a grocerâs shop in Halifax, and printed in the
Mass. Hist. Soc.
Collections
, iii., and in Youngâs
Chronicles. In vol. iii. of the

Bradfordâs First Dialogue, given in the present leaflet, was
first printed in 1648. It was copied by Morton in the records
of the Plymouth Church, and thence reprinted by Young in his
âChronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,â in 1841. It is of the
highest historical value, giving fuller accounts than we have
elsewhere of many of the first English Independents. Bradfordâs
Second Dialogue is lost. Deane says, âI have never seen it,
nor any reference to it.â The Third Dialogue, âConcerning
the Church and the Government thereof,â was published in the

Proceedings
of the Mass. Hist. Soc. for 1870, with an
important historical introduction by Charles Deane.

Mather included a biography of Bradford in his
Magnalia
.
This was reprinted in the first series of Old South Leaflets.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

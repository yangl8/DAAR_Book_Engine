Corrections

Preface to the Project Gutenberg Edition of Beowulf

This text is a corrected version of the fourth edition of Harrison and
Sharp in its entirety. It comes in two basic versions. The base version
(available in 8-bit (Latin-1) text and HTML) presents the original text as
printed.
This file contains the original version
. It preserves the
source-text's idiosyncratic use of accented vowels with the exception of
y-circumflex (ŷ), which is replaced by y-acute (ý) to fit
within the Latin-1 character set. Manifestly unintentional errors in the
text have been corrected. In general, this has only been done when the text
is internally inconsistent (e.g., a quotation in the glossary does not
match the main text). Forms that represent deliberate editorial choice have
not been altered, even where they appear wrong. (For example, some of the
markings of vowel length do not reflect current scholarly consensus.) Where
an uncorrected problem may confuse the reader, I have inserted a note
explaining the difficulty, signed KTH. A complete list of the changes made
is appended at the end of the file. In order to make the text more useful
to modern readers, I have also produced a revised edition, available in
Unicode (UTF-8) and HTML. Notes from the source text that indicate changes
adopted in later editions have been incorporated directly into the text and
apparatus. Further, long vowels are indicated with macrons, as is the
common practice of most modern editions. Finally, the quantity of some words
has been altered to the values currently accepted as correct. Quantities
have not been changed when the difference is a matter of editorial
interpretation (e.g., gÃ¤st vs. gÃ¦st in l. 102, etc.) A list of these
altered quantities appears at the end of the list of corrections. Your
browser must support the Unicode character set to use this file. To tell if
your browser supports the necessary characters, check the table of vowel
equivalents below. If you see any empty boxes or question marks in the
"revised" columns, you should use the basic version.

Explanation of the Vowel Accenting

In general, Harrison and Sharp use circumflex accents over vowels to mark
long vowels. For ash, however, the actual character 'æ' represents the long
vowel. Short ash is rendered with a-umlaut (ä). The long diphthongs (ēo,
ēa, etc.) are indicated with an acute accent over the

second
vowel (eó, eá, etc.).

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

The favor with which the successive editions of "BeÃ³wulf" have been
received during the past thirteen years emboldens the editors to
continue the work of revision in a fourth issue, the most noticeable
feature of which is a considerable body of explanatory Notes, now for
the first time added. These Notes mainly concern themselves with new
textual readings, with here and there grammatical, geographical, and
archÃ¦ological points that seemed worthy of explanation. Parallelisms
and parallel passages are constantly compared, with the view of making
the poem illustrate and explain itself. A few emendations and textual
changes are suggested by the editors with all possible diffidence;
numerous corrections have been made in the Glossary and List of Names;
and the valuable parts of former Appendices have been embodied in the
Notes.

For the Notes, the editors are much indebted to the various German
periodicals mentioned on page 116, to the recent publications of
Professors Earle and J. L. Hall, to Mr. S. A. Brooke, and to the
Heyne-Socin edition of "BeÃ³wulf." No change has been made in the
system of accentuation, though a few errors in quantity have been
corrected. The editors are looking forward to an eventual fifth
edition, in which an entirely new text will be presented.

October, 1893.

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION.

This third edition of the American issue of BeÃ³wulf will, the editors
hope, be found more accurate and useful than either of the preceding
editions. Further corrections in text and glossary have been made, and
some additional new readings and suggestions will be found in two
brief appendices at the back of the book. Students of the metrical
system of BeÃ³wulf will find ample material for their studies in
Sievers' exhaustive essay on that subject (BeitrÃ¤ge, X. 209-314).

Socin's edition of Heyne's BeÃ³wulf (called the fifth edition) has been
utilized to some extent in this edition, though it unfortunately came
too late to be freely used. While it repeats many of the omissions and
inaccuracies of Heyne's fourth edition, it contains much that is
valuable to the student, particularly in the notes and commentary.
Students of the poem, which has been subjected to much searching
criticism during the last decade, will also derive especial help from
the contributions of Sievers and Kluge on difficult questions
appertaining to it. WÃ¼lker's new edition (in the Grein

Bibliothek
) is of the highest value, however one may dissent
from particular textual views laid down in the 'Berichtigter Text.'
Paul and Braune's BeitrÃ¤ge contain a varied miscellany of hints,
corrections, and suggestions principally embodying the views of Kluge,
Cosijn, Sievers, and Bugge, some of the more important of which are
found in the appendices to the present and the preceding edition.
Holder and Zupitza, Sarrazin and Hermann MÃ¶ller (Kiel, 1883), Heinzel
(Anzeiger f.d. Alterthum, X.), Gering (Zacher's Zeitschrift, XII.),
Brenner (Eng. Studien, IX.), and the contributors to Anglia, have
assisted materially in the textual and metrical interpretation of the
poem.

The subject of Anglo-Saxon quantity has been discussed in several able
essays by Sievers, Sweet, Ten Brink (Anzeiger, f.d. Alterthum, V.),
Kluge (BeitrÃ¤ge, XI.), and others; but so much is uncertain in this
field that the editors have left undisturbed the marking of vowels
found in the text of their original edition, while indicating in the
appendices the now accepted views of scholars on the quantity of the
personal pronouns (
mÃª, wÃª, þÃ», þÃª, gÃª, hÃª
); the adverb

nÃ»
, etc. Perhaps it would be best to banish absolutely all
attempts at marking quantities except in cases where the Ms. has them
marked.

An approximately complete Bibliography of BeÃ³wulf literature will be
found in WÃ¼lker's
Grundriss
and in Garnett's translation of the
poem.

NOTE TO THE SECOND REVISED EDITION.

The editors feel so encouraged at the kind reception accorded their
edition of BeÃ³wulf (1883), that, in spite of its many shortcomings,
they have determined to prepare a second revised edition of the book,
and thus endeavor to extend its sphere of usefulness. About twenty
errors had, notwithstanding a vigilant proof-reading, crept into the
text,—errors in single letters, accents, and punctuation. These have
been corrected, and it is hoped that the text has been rendered
generally accurate and trustworthy. In the List of Names one or two
corrections have been made, and in the Glossary numerous mistakes in
gender, classification, and translation, apparently unavoidable in a
first edition, have been rectified. Wherever these mistakes concern

single
letters, or occupy very small space, they have been
corrected in the plates; where they are longer, and the expense of
correcting them in the plates would have been very great, the editors
have thought it best to include them in an Appendix of Corrections and
Additions, which will be found at the back of the book. Students are
accordingly referred to this Appendix for important longer corrections
and additions. It is believed that the value of the book has been much
enhanced by an Appendix of Recent Readings, based on late criticisms
and essays from the pens of Sievers, Kluge, Cosijn, Holder, WÃ¼lker,
and Sweet. A perplexed student, in turning to these suggested
readings, will often find great help in unravelling obscure or corrupt
passages.

The objectionable ä and æ, for the short and the long diphthong, have
been retained in the revised edition, owing to the impossibility of
removing them without entirely recasting the plates.

In conclusion, the editors would acknowledge their great indebtedness
to the friends and critics whose remarks and criticisms have
materially aided in the correction of the text,—particularly to
Profs. C.P.G. Scott, Baskervill, Price, and J.M. Hart; to Prof. J.W.
Bright; and to the authorities of Cornell University, for the loan of
periodicals necessary to the completeness of the revision. While the
second revised edition still contains much that might be improved, the
editors cannot but hope that it is an advance on its predecessor, and
that it will continue its work of extending the study of Old English
throughout the land.

JUNE, 1885.

NOTE I.

The present work, carefully edited from Heyne's fourth edition,
(Paderborn, 1879), is designed primarily for college classes in
Anglo-Saxon, rather than for independent investigators or for seekers
after a restored or ideal text. The need of an American edition of
"BeÃ³wulf" has long been felt, as, hitherto, students have had either
to send to Germany for a text, or secure, with great trouble, one of
the scarce and expensive English editions. Heyne's first edition came
out in 1863, and was followed in 1867 and 1873 by a second and a third
edition, all three having essentially the same text.

So many important contributions to the "BeÃ³wulf" literature were,
however, made between 1873 and 1879 that Heyne found it necessary to
put forth a new edition (1879). In this new, last edition, the text
was subjected to a careful revision, and was fortified by the views,
contributions, and criticisms of other zealous scholars. In it the
collation of the unique "BeÃ³wulf" Ms. (Vitellius A. 15: Cottonian Mss.
of the British Museum), as made by E. KÃ¶lbing in Herrig's

Archiv
(Bd. 56; 1876), was followed wherever the present
condition of the Ms. had to be discussed; and the researches of Bugge,
Bieger, and others, on single passages, were made use of. The
discussion of the metrical structure of the poem, as occurring in the
second and third editions, was omitted in the fourth, owing to the
many controversies in which the subject is still involved. The present
editor has thought it best to do the same, though, happily, the
subject of Old English
Metrik
is undergoing a steady
illumination through the labors of Schipper and others.

Some errors and misplaced accents in Heyne's text have been corrected
in the present edition, in which, as in the general revision of the
text, the editor has been most kindly aided by Prof. J.M. Garnett,
late Principal of St. John's College, Maryland.

In the preparation of the present school edition it has been thought
best to omit Heyne's notes, as they concern themselves principally
with conjectural emendations, substitutions of one reading for
another, and discussions of the condition of the Ms. Until WÃ¼lker's
text and the photographic fac-simile of the original Ms. are in the
hands of all scholars, it will be better not to introduce such matters
in the school room, where they would puzzle without instructing.

For convenience of reference, the editor has added a head-line to each
"fit" of the poem, with a view to facilitate a knowledge of its
episodes.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY,
LEXINGTON, VA., June, 1882.

NOTE II.

The editors now have the pleasure of presenting to the public a
complete text and a tolerably complete glossary of "BeÃ³wulf." The
edition is the first published in America, and the first of its
special kind presented to the English public, and it is the initial
volume of a "Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry," to be edited under the
same auspices and with the coÃ¶peration of distinguished scholars in
this country. Among these scholars may be mentioned Professors F.A.
March of Lafayette College, T.K. Price of Columbia College, and W.M.
Baskervill of Vanderbilt University.

In the preparation of the Glossary the editors found it necessary to
abandon a literal and exact translation of Heyne for several reasons,
and among others from the fact that Heyne seems to be wrong in the
translation of some of his illustrative quotations, and even
translates the same passage in two or three different ways under
different headings. The orthography of his glossary differs
considerably from the orthography of his text. He fails to
discriminate with due nicety the meanings of many of the words in his
vocabulary, while criticism more recent than his latest edition (1879)
has illustrated or overthrown several of his renderings. The
references were found to be incorrect in innumerable instances, and
had to be verified in every individual case so far as this was
possible, a few only, which resisted all efforts at verification,
having to be indicated by an interrogation point (?). The references
are exceedingly numerous, and the labor of verifying them was
naturally great. To many passages in the Glossary, where Heyne's
translation could not be trusted with entire certainty, the editors
have added other translations of phrases and sentences or of special
words; and in this they have been aided by a careful study of the text
and a comparison and utilization of the views of Kemble and Professor
J.M. Garnett (who takes Grein for his foundation). Many new references
have been added; and the various passages in which Heyne fails to
indicate whether a given verb is weak or strong, or fails to point out
the number, etc., of the illustrative form, have been corrected and
made to harmonize with the general plan of the work. Numerous
misprints in the glossary have also been corrected, and a brief
glossary to the Finnsburh-fragment, prepared by Dr. Wm. Hand Browne,
and supplemented and adapted by the editor-in-chief, has been added.

The editors think that they may without immodesty put forth for
themselves something more than the claim of being re-translators of a
translation: the present edition is, so far as they were able to make
it so, an adaptation, correction, and extension of the work of the
great German scholar to whose loving appreciation of the Anglo-Saxon
epic all students of Old English owe a debt of gratitude. While
following his usually sure and cautious guidance, and in the main
appropriating his results, they have thought it best to deviate from
him in the manner above indicated, whenever it seemed that he was
wrong. The careful reader will notice at once the marks of
interrogation which point out these deviations, or which introduce a
point of view illustrative of, or supplementary to, the one given by
the German editor. No doubt the editors are wrong themselves in many
places,—"BeÃ³wulf" is a most difficult poem,—but their view may at
least be defended by a reference to the original text, which they have
faithfully and constantly consulted.

A good many cognate Modern English words have been introduced here and
there in the Glossary with a view to illustration, and other addenda
will be found between brackets and parenthetical marks.

It is hoped that the present edition of the most famous of Old English
poems will do something to promote a valuable and interesting study.

ARGUMENT.

The only national [Anglo-Saxon] epic which has been preserved entire
is BeÃ³wulf. Its argument is briefly as follows:—The poem opens with a
few verses in praise of the Danish Kings, especially Scild, the son of
Sceaf. His death is related, and his descendants briefly traced down
to Hroðgar. Hroðgar, elated with his prosperity and success in war,
builds a magnificent hall, which he calls Heorot. In this hall Hroðgar
and his retainers live in joy and festivity, until a malignant fiend,
called Grendel, jealous of their happiness, carries off by night
thirty of Hroðgar's men, and devours them in his moorland retreat.
These ravages go on for twelve years. BeÃ³wulf, a thane of Hygelac,
King of the Goths, hearing of Hroðgar's calamities, sails from Sweden
with fourteen warriors—to help him. They reach the Danish coast in
safety; and, after an animated parley with Hroðgar's coastguard, who
at first takes them for pirates, they are allowed to proceed to the
royal hall, where they are well received by Hroðgar. A banquet ensues,
during which BeÃ³wulf is taunted by the envious Hunferhð about his
swimming-match with Breca, King of the Brondings. BeÃ³wulf gives the
true account of the contest, and silences Hunferhð. At night-fall the
King departs, leaving BeÃ³wulf in charge of the hall. Grendel soon
breaks in, seizes and devours one of BeÃ³wulf's companions; is attacked
by BeÃ³wulf, and, after losing an arm, which is torn off by BeÃ³wulf,
escapes to the fens. The joy of Hroðgar and the Danes, and their
festivities, are described, various episodes are introduced, and
BeÃ³wulf and his companions receive splendid gifts. The next night
Grendel's mother revenges her son by carrying off Ãschere, the friend
and councillor of Hroðgar, during the absence of BeÃ³wulf. Hroðgar
appeals to BeÃ³wulf for vengeance, and describes the haunts of Grendel
and his mother. They all proceed thither; the scenery of the lake, and
the monsters that dwell in it, are described. BeÃ³wulf plunges into the
water, and attacks Grendel's mother in her dwelling at the bottom of
the lake. He at length overcomes her, and cuts off her head, together
with that of Grendel, and brings the heads to Hroðgar. He then takes
leave of Hroðgar, sails back to Sweden, and relates his adventures to
Hygelac. Here the first half of the poem ends. The second begins with
the accession of BeÃ³wulf to the throne, after the fall of Hygelac and
his son Heardred. He rules prosperously for fifty years, till a
dragon, brooding over a hidden treasure, begins to ravage the country,
and destroys BeÃ³wulf's palace with fire. BeÃ³wulf sets out in quest of
its hiding-place, with twelve men. Having a presentiment of his
approaching end, he pauses and recalls to mind his past life and
exploits. He then takes leave of his followers, one by one, and
advances alone to attack the dragon. Unable, from the heat, to enter
the cavern, he shouts aloud, and the dragon comes forth. The dragon's
scaly hide is proof against BeÃ³wulf's sword, and he is reduced to
great straits. Then Wiglaf, one of his followers, advances to help
him. Wiglaf's shield is consumed by the dragon's fiery breath, and he
is compelled to seek shelter under BeÃ³wulf's shield of iron. BeÃ³wulf's
sword snaps asunder, and he is seized by the dragon. Wiglaf stabs the
dragon from underneath, and BeÃ³wulf cuts it in two with his dagger.
Feeling that his end is near, he bids Wiglaf bring out the treasures
from the cavern, that he may see them before he dies. Wiglaf enters
the dragon's den, which is described, returns to BeÃ³wulf, and receives
his last commands. BeÃ³wulf dies, and Wiglaf bitterly reproaches his
companions for their cowardice. The disastrous consequences of
BeÃ³wulf's death are then foretold, and the poem ends with his
funeral.—H. Sweet, in Warton's

II. (ed. 1871). Cf. also Ten Brink's

The sons of Ãhthere, EÃ¡nmund and EÃ¡dgils, have rebelled against their
father (
2382
), and must, in consequence, depart with their followers from
SwiÃ³rÃ®ce,
2205-6
,
2380
. They come into the country of the GeÃ¡tas to
HeardrÃªd (
2380
), but whether with friendly or hostile intent is not stated;
but, according to
2203
f., we are to presume that they came against
HeardrÃªd with designs of conquest. At a banquet (on feorme; or feorme, MS.)
HeardrÃªd falls, probably through treachery, by the hand of one of the
brothers,
2386
,
2207
. The murderer must have been EÃ¡nmund, to whom,
according to
2613
, "in battle the revenge of WeohstÃ¢n brings death."
WeohstÃ¢n takes revenge for his murdered king, and exercises upon EÃ¡nmund's
body the booty-right, and robs it of helm, breastplate, and sword
(
2616-17
), which the slain man had received as gifts from his uncle, Onela,

2617-18
. But WeohstÃ¢n does not speak willingly of this fight, although he
has slain Onela's brother's son,
2619-20
.—After HeardrÃªd's and EÃ¡nmund's
death, the descendant of OngenþeÃ³w, EÃ¡dgils, returns to his home,
2388
. He
must give way before BeÃ³wulf, who has, since HeardrÃªd's death, ascended the
throne of the GeÃ¡tas,
2390
. But BeÃ³wulf remembers it against him in after
days, and the old feud breaks out anew,
2392-94
. EÃ¡dgils makes an invasion
into the land of the GeÃ¡tas (
2394-95
), during which he falls at the hands
of BeÃ³wulf,
2397
. The latter must have then obtained the sovereignty over
the Sweonas (
3005-6
, where only the version, Scylfingas, can give a
satisfactory sense).

Eofor
(gen. Eofores,
2487
,
2965
; dat. Jofore,
2994

), one of
the GeÃ¡tas, son of WonrÃªd and brother of Wulf (

(
1090
), king of the North Frisians, i.e. of the Eotenas, husband of
Hildeburg, a daughter of HÃ´c,
1072
,
1077
. He is the hero of the inserted
poem on the Attack in Finnsburg, the obscure incidents of which are,
perhaps, as follows: In Finn's castle, Finnsburg, situated in Jutland
(
1126-28
), the HÃ´cing, HnÃ¤f, a relative—perhaps a brother—of Hildeburg is
spending some time as guest. HnÃ¤f, who is a liegeman of the Danish king,
Healfdene, has sixty men with him (Finnsburg,
38
). These are treacherously
attacked one night by Finn's men,
1073
. For five days they hold the doors
of their lodging-place without losing one of their number (Finnsburg,
41
,

42
). Then, however, HnÃ¤f is slain (
1071
), and the Dane, Hengest, who was
among HnÃ¤f's followers, assumes the command of the beleaguered band. But on
the attacking side the fight has brought terrible losses to Finn's men.
Their numbers are diminished (
1081
f.), and Hildeburg bemoans a son and a
brother among the fallen (
1074
f., cf.
1116
,
1119
). Therefore the Frisians
offer the Danes peace (
1086
) under the conditions mentioned (
1087-1095
),
and it is confirmed with oaths (
1097
), and money is given by Finn in
propitiation (
1108
). Now all who have survived the battle go together to
Friesland, the homo proper of Finn, and here Hengest remains during the
winter, prevented by ice and storms from returning home (Grein). But in
spring the feud breaks out anew. GÃ»ðlÃ¢f and OslÃ¢f avenge HnÃ¤f's fall,
probably after they have brought help from home (
1150
). In the battle, the
hall is filled with the corpses of the enemy. Finn himself is killed, and
the queen is captured and carried away, along with the booty, to the land
of the Danes,

.

1182
) that, in case of
the early death of HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r, HrÃ´ð-ulf would prove a good guardian to
HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r's young son, who would succeed to the government; a hope which
seems not to have been accomplished, since it appears from
1165
,
1166
that
HrÃ´ð-ulf has abused his trust towards HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r.

Hrones-nÃ¤s

Hrunting, to BeÃ³wulf for his battle with Grendel's mother,
1456
f.
According to
588
,
1168
, he slew his brothers. Since his name is always
alliterated with vowels, it is probable that the original form was, as
Rieger (Zachers Ztschr.,

After his brother, HÃ¦ðcyn, is killed by OngenþeÃ³w, he undertakes the
government (
2992
in connection with the preceding from
2937
on). To Eofor
he gives, as reward for slaying OngenþeÃ³w, his only daughter in marriage,

2998
. But much later, at the time of the return of BeÃ³wulf from his
expedition to HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r, we see him married to the very young Hygd, the
daughter of HÃ¤reð,
1930
. The latter seems, then, to have been his second
wife. Their son is HeardrÃªd,

ff. in order to end the war, Ingeld
is married to FreÃ¡waru, daughter of the Danish king, HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r,
2025-30
. Yet
his love for his young wife can make him forget only for a short while his
desire to avenge his father. He finally carries it out, excited thereto by
the repeated admonitions of an old warrior,
2042-70
(WÃ®dsÃ®ð, 45-59).

Ing-wine
(gen. Ingwina,

NOTES.

l. 1.
hwÃ¤t
: for this interjectional formula opening a poem, cf.

Andreas, Daniel, Juliana, Exodus, Fata Apost., Dream of the Rood
,
and the "Listenith lordinges!" of mediaeval lays.—E. Cf. Chaucer,
Prologue, ed. Morris, l. 853:

"Sin I shal beginne the game,

What
, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name!"

we ... gefrunon
is a variant on the usual epic formulÃ¦
ic
gefrÃ¤gn
(
l. 74
) and
mÃ®ne gefrÃ¦ge
(
l. 777
).
Exodus, Daniel,
Phoenix
, etc., open with the same formula.

l. 1. "
GÃ¢r
was the javelin, armed with two of which the warrior went
into battle, and which he threw over the 'shield-wall.' It was
barbed."—Br. 124. Cf.
Maldon
, l. 296;
Judith
, l. 224;

Gnom. Verses
, l. 22; etc.

l. 4. "Scild of the Sheaf, not 'Scyld the son of Scaf'; for it is too
inconsistent, even in myth, to give a patronymic to a foundling. According
to the original form of the story, SceÃ¡f was the foundling; he had come
ashore with a sheaf of corn, and from that was named. This form of the
story is preserved in Ethelwerd and in William of Malmesbury. But here the
foundling is Scyld, and we must suppose he was picked up with the sheaf,
and hence his cognomen."—E., p. 105. Cf. the accounts of Romulus and
Remus, of Moses, of Cyrus, etc.

l. 6.
egsian
is also used in an active sense (not in the Gloss.), =

to terrify
.

l. 15. S. suggests
þÃ¢
(
which
) for
þÃ¤t
, as object of

dreÃ³gan
; and for
aldor-leÃ¡se
, Gr. suggested

aldor-ceare
.—
Beit.
ix. 136.

S. translates: "For God had seen the dire need which the rulerless ones
before endured."

l. 18. "Beowulf (that is, Beaw of the Anglo-Saxon genealogists, not our
Beowulf, who was a Geat, not a Dane), 'the son of Scyld in Scedeland.' This
is our ancestral myth,—the story of the first culture-hero of the North;
'the patriarch,' as Rydberg calls him, 'of the royal families of Sweden,
Denmark, Angeln, Saxland, and England.'"—Br., p. 78. Cf.
A.-S.
Chron.
an. 855.

H.-So. omits parenthetic marks, and reads (after S.,
Beit.
ix. 135)

eaferan
; cf.
Fata Apost.
:
lof wÃ®de sprang þeÃ³dnes þegna
.

"The name
Bēowulf
means literally 'Bee-wolf,' wolf or
ravager of the bees, = bear. Cf.
beorn
, 'hero,' originally 'bear,'
and
bēohata
, 'warrior,' in CÃ¦dmon, literally 'bee-hater' or
'persecutor,' and hence identical in meaning with
bēowulf
."—Sw.

Cf.

"Arcite and Palamon,

That foughten

, as it were bores two."

: cf.

"
In elde

l. 26. Reflexive objects often pleonastically accompany verbs of motion;
cf.
ll. 234

, etc.

l. 28.
faroð
=
shore, strand, edge.
Add these to the meanings
in the Gloss.

l. 31. The object of
Ã¢hte
is probably
geweald
, to be supplied
from
wordum weÃ³ld
of
l. 30
.—H.-So.

R., Kl., and B. all hold conflicting views of this passage:
Beit.

xii. 80, ix. 188;
Zachers Zeitschr.
iii. 382, etc. Kl. suggests

lÃ¦ndagas
for
lange
.

l. 32. "
hringed-stefna
is sometimes translated 'with curved prow,'
but it means, I think, that in the prow were fastened rings through which
the cables were passed that tied it to the shore."—Br., p. 26. Cf.
ll.
1132
,
1898
.
Hring-horni
was the mythic ship of the Edda. See
Toller-Bosworth for three different views; and cf.
wunden-stefna
(
l.
220
),
hring-naca
(
l. 1863
).

ll. 34-52. Cf. the burial of Haki on a funeral-pyre ship,
Inglinga
Saga;
the burial of Balder, SinfiÃ¶tli, Arthur, etc.

l. 35. "And this [their joy in the sea] is all the plainer from the number
of names given to the ship-names which speak their pride and affection. It
is the Ãtheling's vessel, the Floater, the Wave-swimmer, the Ring-sterned,
the Keel, the Well-bound wood, the Sea-wood, the Sea-ganger, the Sea-broad
ship, the Wide-bosomed, the Prow-curved, the Wood of the curved neck, the
Foam-throated floater that flew like a bird."—Br., p. 168.

l. 49. "We know from Scandinavian graves ... that the illustrious dead were
buried ... in ships, with their bows to sea-ward; that they were however
not sent to sea, but were either burnt in that position, or mounded over
with earth."—E. See Du Chaillu,
The Viking Age
, xix.

(H.);
(3)
sele-rÃ¦dende
(H.-So.). Cf.

; and see Ha.

l. 51. E. compares with this canto Tennyson's "Passing of Arthur" and the
legendary burial-journey of St. James of Campostella, an. 800.

l. 53. The poem proper begins with this, "There was once upon a time," the
first 52 lines being a prelude. Eleven of the "fitts," or cantos, begin
with the monosyllable
þÃ¢
, four with the verb
gewÃ®tan
, nine
with the formula
HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r
(BeÃ³wulf, Unferð)
maðelode
,
twenty-four with monosyllables in general (
him, swÃ¢, sÃª, hwÃ¤t, þÃ¢, hÃªht,
wÃ¤s, mÃ¤g, cwÃ´m, strÃ¦t
).

l. 58.
gamel.
"The ... characteristics of the poetry are the use of
archaic forms and words, such as
mec
for
mÃ©
, the possessive

sÃ­n, gamol, dÃ³gor, swÃ¡t
for
eald, dÃ¦g, blÃ³d
, etc., after they
had become obsolete in the prose language, and the use of special compounds
and phrases, such as
hildenÃ¦dre
(
war-adder
) for 'arrow,'
gold-gifa (
gold-giver
) for 'king,' ...
goldwine gumena

(
goldfriend of men, distributor of gold to men
) for 'king,'"
etc.—Sw. Other poetic words are
ides, ielde
(
men
), etc.

l. 60. H.-So. reads
rÃ¦swa
(referring to
HeorogÃ¢r
alone),
and places a point (with the Ms.) after
HeorogÃ¢r
instead of after

rÃ¦swa.
Cf. l. 469; see B.,
Zachers Zeitschr.
iv. 193.

l. 62.
Elan
here (OHG.
Elana, Ellena, Elena, Elina, Alyan
) is
thought by B. (
Tidskr.
viii. 43) to be a remnant of the masc. name

Onela
, and he reads:
[On-]elan ewÃªn, Heaðoscilfingas(=es)
healsgebedda.

l. 68. For
hÃª
, omitted here, cf.
l. 300
. Pronouns are occasionally
thus omitted in subord. clauses.—Sw.

l. 70.
þone
, here =
þonne
,
than
, and
micel =
mÃ¢re?
The passage, by a slight change, might be made to read,

medo-Ã¤rn micle      mÃ¢ gewyrcean,—þone
=
by much larger than
,—in
which
þone (þonne)
would come in naturally.

l. 73.
folc-scare.
Add
folk-share
to the meanings in the
Gloss.; and cf. gÃ»ð-scearu.

l. 74.
ic wide gefrÃ¤gn:
an epic formula very frequent in poetry, =

Cf.
Judith

,
1956
, etc.

ll. 78-83. "The hall was a rectangular, high-roofed, wooden building, its
long sides facing north and south. The two gables, at either end, had
stag-horns on their points, curving forwards, and these, as well as the
ridge of the roof, were probably covered with shining metal, and glittered
bravely in the sun."—Br., p. 32.

l. 84.
Son-in-law and father-in-law;
B., a so-called
dvanda

compound. Cf.
l. 1164
, where a similar compound means
uncle and
nephew;
and
WÃ®dsÃ®ð's suhtorfÃ¦dran
, used of the same persons.

l. 88. "The word
dreÃ¡m
conveys the buzz and hum of social happiness,
and more particularly the sound of music and singing."—E. Cf.
l. 3021
; and

Judith
, l. 350;
Wanderer
, l. 79, etc.

ll. 90-99. There is a suspicious similarity between this passage and the
lines attributed by Bede to CÃ¦dmon:

NÃ» wÃª sculan herian heofonrices Weard
, etc.

—Sw., p. 47.

ll. 90-98 are probably the interpolation of a Christian scribe.

ll. 92-97. "The first of these Christian elements [in
BeÃ³wulf
] is
the sense of a fairer, softer world than that in which the Northern
warriors lived.... Another Christian passage (
ll. 107
,
1262
) derives all
the demons, eotens, elves, and dreadful sea-beasts from the race of Cain.
The folly of sacrificing to the heathen gods is spoken of (
l. 175
).... The
other point is the belief in immortality (
ll. 1202
,
1761
)."—Br. 71.

l. 100. Cf.
l. 2211
, where the third dragon of the poem is introduced in
the same words. Beowulf is the forerunner of that other national
dragon-slayer, St. George.

l. 100.

ll. 101-151. "Grimm connects [
Grendel
] with the Anglo-Saxon

grindel
(
a bolt
or
bar
).... It carries with it the
notion of the bolts and bars of hell, and hence
a fiend.
...
EttmÃ¼ller was the first ... to connect the name with

grind, to crush to pieces, to utterly destroy.

Grendel

Deofol
(
devil
; cf.
l. 2089

military brotherhood, when HÃ»n laid upon his breast

(the sword)
LÃ¢fing
. There is a sword
Laufi, LÃ¶vi

ll. 1160, 1161.
leÃ³ð
(

here appear synonyms.

ll. 1162-1165. "Behind the wars and tribal wanderings, behind the
contentions of the great, we watch in this poem the steady, continuous life
of home, the passions and thoughts of men, the way they talked and moved
and sang and drank and lived and loved among one another and for one
another."—Br., p. 18.

, etc.).

l. 1196. This necklace was afterwards given by Beowulf to Hygd,
ll. 2173
,

2174
.

ll. 1199-1215. From the obscure hints in the passage, a part of the poem
may be approximately dated,—if HygelÃ¢c is the
Chochi-laicus
of
Gregory of Tours,
Hist. Francorum
, iii. 3,—about A.D. 512-20.

l. 1200. The
Breosinga men
(Icel.
Brisinga men
) is the
necklace of the goddess Freya; cf.
Elder Edda, Hamarshemt.
HÃ¢ma
stole the necklace from the Gothic King EormenrÃ®c; cf.
Traveller's
Song
, ll. 8, 18, 88, 111. The comparison of the two necklaces leads the
poet to anticipate HygelÃ¢c's history,—a suggestion of the poem's mosaic
construction.

l. 1200. For
BrÃ´singa mene
, cf. B.,
Beit.

, for
fealh
, placing semicolon

subject of
fleÃ¡h
and

geceÃ¡s
.

l. 1202. B. conjectures
geceÃ¡s Ãªcne rÃ¦d
to mean
he became a pious
man and at death went to heaven
. Heime (HÃ¢ma) in the

Thidrekssaga
goes into a cloister = to choose the better part (?).
Cf. H.-So., p. 98. But cf. HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r's language to Beowulf,

parallelism of word and phrase characteristic of A.-S. poetry, and is
quoted by Sw. The changes are rung on
ende
and
swylt
, on

gesÃ½ne
and
wÃ®dcÃ»ð
, etc.

l. 1259. "That this story of Grendel's mother was originally a separate lay
from the first seems to be suggested by the fact that the monsters are
described over again, and many new details added, such as would be inserted
by a new singer who wished to enhance and adorn the original tale."—Br.,
p. 41.

l. 1259. Cf.
l. 107
, which also points to the ancestry of murderers and
monsters and their descent from "Cain."

double gender (m., n. in the case of
mÃ´dgeþ

l. 1741. The doctrine of nemesis following close on
ὓβρις
, or
overweening pride, is here very clearly enunciated. The only protector
against the things that "assault and hurt" the soul is the "Bishop and
Shepherd of our souls" (
l. 1743
).

l. 1745 appears dimly to fore-shadow the office of the evil archer Loki,
who in the Scandinavian mythology shoots Balder with a mistletoe twig. The
language closely resembles that of Psalm 64.

l. 1748. Kl. regards
wom = wÃ´(u)m
; cf.
wÃ´h-bogen

translates
boastfully
; G.,

; Gr.,
to incite to

l. 1767. E. thinks this an allusion to the widespread superstition of the
evil eye (

). Cf. Vergil,

is
plainly seen in this line; cf.
ll. 1826

1830
,
1763

l. 1794. Some impers. vbs. take acc. (as here,
Geat
) of the person
affected; others (as
þyncan
) take the dat. of the person, as at ll.

688
,
1749
, etc. Cf. verbs of dreaming, being ashamed, desiring,
etc.—March, A.-S. Gram., p. 145.

l. 1802. E. remarks that the
blaca hrefn
here is a bird of good
omen, as opposed to
se wonna hrefn
of
l. 3025
. The raven, wolf, and
eagle are the regular epic accompaniments of battle and carnage. Cf. ll.

3025-3028
;
Maldon
, 106;
Judith
, 205-210, etc.

l. 1803. S. emends to read: "then came the light, going bright after
darkness: the warriors," etc. Cf. Ho., p. 41, l. 23. G. puts period before
"the warriors." For
onettan
, cf. Sw.'s Gloss, and Bright's Read.,
Gloss.

ll. 1808-1810. MÃ¼llenh. and Grundt. refer

=
warriors
(cf.
l. 1804
) has been proposed by
C.; but cf.
l. 253
.

l. 1897. The boat had been left, at
ll. 294-302
, in the keeping of
HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r's men; at
l. 1901
the
bÃ¢t-weard
is specially honored by
Beowulf with a sword and becomes a "sworded squire."—E. This circumstance
appears to weld the poem together. Cf. also the speed of the journey home
with
ymb Ã¢n-tÃ®d Ã´þres dÃ´gores
of
l. 219
, and the similarity of
language in both passages (
fÃ¢mig-heals
,
clifu
,
nÃ¤ssas
,

sÃ¦lde
,
brim
, etc.).—The nautical terms in Beowulf would form
an interesting study.

l. 1904. R. proposes,
gewÃ¢t him on naca
, =
the vessel set
out
,
on
alliterating as at
l. 2524
(
Zachers Zeitschr.

for the dear men ready at the coast
(
Beit.
xii. 97).

l. 1924. Gr., W., and Ho. propose
wunade

but cf.

l. 1929
. S. conceives
ll. 1924

1925
as "direct speech" (

l. 1927
seq.
"The women of Beowulf are of the fine northern type;
trusted and loved by their husbands and by the nobles and people; generous,
gentle, and holding their place with dignity."—Br., p. 67. Thrytho is the
exception,
l. 1932

seq.

l. 1933. C. suggests
frÃªcnu
, =
dangerous, bold
, for Thrytho
could not be called "excellent." G. writes "Modthrytho" as her name. The
womanly Hygd seems purposely here contrasted with the terrible Thrytho,
just as, at
l. 902

seq.
, Sigemund and HeremÃ´d are contrasted. For
Thrytho, etc., cf. Gr.,

Offa, King of Mercia, and his wife Cwendrida, and the Offa and Þryðo (Gr.'s

Drida
of the
Vita OffÃ¦ Secundi
) of the present passage. The
tale is told of her, not of Hygd.

l. 1936. Suchier proposes

l. 2022. Food of specific sorts is rarely, if at all, mentioned in the poem.
Drink, on the other hand, occurs in its primitive varieties,—

),
mead, beer, wine, lÃ®ð

l. 2188. The "slack" Beowulf, like the sluggish Brutus, ultimately
reveals his true character, and is presented with a historic sword of honor.
It is "laid on his breast" (
l. 2195
) as Hun laid LÃ¢fing on Hengest's
breast,
l. 1145
.

l. 2188. "The boy was at first slothful, and the Geats thought him an
unwarlike prince, and long despised him. Then, like many a lazy third
son in the folk tales, a change came, he suddenly showed wonderful daring
and was passionate for adventure."—Br., p. 22.

l. 2196. "Seven of thousands, manor and lordship" (Ha.). Kl.,
Beit.

ix. 191, thinks with Ettm. that
þÃ»sendo
means a hide of land (see

EÃ¡dgils, Ãhthere's son, driven from Sweden, returns later, supported by
Beowulf, takes the life of his uncle Onela, and probably becomes himself
O.'s successor and king of Sweden. For another view see H.-So., p. 115.

hand, answers to the Jutish king HygelÃ¢c, who rewards his liegeman, for
the slaying of OngentheÃ³w, with jewels, enormous estates, and
his

l. 3006. H.-So. suggests
Scilfingas

,
Beowulf kills the Scylfing EÃ¡dgils and probably acquires his lands. Thus

ll. 3002
,
3005
,
3006
, would indicate that, after Beowulf's death, the Swedes
desired to shake off his hated yoke. MÃ¼llenh., however, regards

: "the valiant earl wondereth then
through what he shall attain his life's end, when he no longer may live.
... So BeÃ³wulf knew not (wondered how) through what

heofon rÃªce swealg
=

geÃ³meowle
)
was probably Hygd; cf.
ll. 2370

NOTES TO THE FIGHT AT FINNSBURG.

The original MS. of this fragment has vanished, but a copy had been made
and printed by Hickes in his
Thesaurus Linguarum Septentrionalium
,
i. 192. The original was written on a single sheet attached to a codex of
homilies in the Lambeth Library. MÃ¶ller,
Alteng. Epos
, p. 65, places
the fragment in the Finn episode, between
ll. 1146
and
1147
. Bugge
(
Beit.
xii. 20) makes it illustrate the conflict in which HnÃ¤f fell,

i.e.
as described in
BeÃ³wulf
as antecedent to the events
there given. Heinzel (
Anzeiger f. d. Altert.
), however, calls
attention to the fact that Hengest in the fragment is called
cyning
,
whereas in
BeÃ³wulf
,
l. 1086
, he is called
þegn
. See H.-So.,
p. 125.

"The
Fight at Finnsburg
and the lays from which our
BeÃ³wulf

was composed were, as it seems to me, sung among the English who dwelt in
the north of Denmark and the south of Sweden, and whose tribal name was the
Jutes or Goths."—Br., p. 101.

l. 1. R. supposes [
hor
]
nas
, and conjectures such an
introductory conversation as follows: "Is it dawning in the east, or is a
fiery dragon flying about, or are the turrets of some castle burning?"
questions which the king negatives in the same order. Then comes the
positive declaration, "rather they are warriors marching whose armor gleams
in the moonlight." —
Alt- und Angels. Lesebuch
, 1861. Heinzel and B.
conjecture, [
beorhtor hor
]
nas byrnað nÃ¦fre
. So.
G.—
Beit.
xii. 22;
Anzeiger f. d. Altert.
x. 229.

l. 5. B. conjectures
fugelas
to mean
arrows
, and supplies:

ac hÃªr forð berað      [fyrdsearu rincas,

flacre flÃ¢nbogan],      fugelas singað.

He compares Saxo, p. 95,
cristatis galeis hastisque sonantibus
instant
, as explanatory of
l. 6
.—
Beit.
xii. 22. But see Brooke,

Early Eng. Literature
, who supposes
fugelas
=
raven

and
eagle
, while
grÃ¦g-hama
is =
wulf
(the "grey-coated
one"), the ordinary accompaniers of battle.

l. 11.
hicgeað
, etc.: cf.
Maldon
, l. 5;
Exod.
l. 218.

l. 15. Cf. B. (
Beit.
xii. 25), etc., and Saxo, p. 101, for l. 13.

ll. 18-21. H.-So. remarks: "If, according to MÃ¶ller and Bugge, GÃ¢rulf is
one of the attackers, one of Finn's men, this does not harmonize with his
character as GÃ»ðlÃ¢f's son (
l. 33
), who (
l. 16
, and
BeÃ³wulf
,
l. 1149
)
is a Dane, therefore one of Finn's antagonists." B. (
Beit.
xii. 25)
conjectures:

þÃ¢ gyt GÃ»ðdene      GÃ¢rulf styrode,

þÃ¤t hÃª swÃ¢ freÃ³lÃ®c feorh      forman sÃ®ðe

tÃ´ þÃ¦re healle durum      hyrsta ne bÃ¦re,

in which
GÃ»ðdene
is the same as Sigeferð,
l. 24
;
hÃª
(
l. 22
)
refers to
GÃ¢rulf
; and
hÃ®e
(
l. 21
) to
hyrsta
.

l. 27.
swÃ¤ðer
=
either
(bad or good, life or death).—H.-So.

l. 29.
cÃªlod
: meaning doubtful; cf.
Maldon
, l. 283. G.
renders "curved board"; Sw. suggests "round"? "hollow"?

l. 30. B. suggests
bÃ¢r-helm
, =
boar-helm.
Cf. Saxo, p.
96.—
Beit.
xii. 26.

l. 34. B. conjectures: (1)
hwearf flacra hrÃ¦w hrÃ¤fen, wandrode
; (2)

hwearf flacra hrÃ¦w hrÃ¤fen fram Ã´ðrum
=
flew from one corpse to
another
.—
Beit.
xii. 27.

l. 43. B. supposes
wund hÃ¤leð
to be a Dane,
folces hyrde
to
be HnÃ¤f, in opposition to Holtzmann (
Germania
, viii. 494), who
supposes the wounded man to be a Frisian, and
folces hyrde
to be
their king, Finn.—
Beit.
xii. 28.

l. 45. B. adopts Th.'s reading
heresceorp unhrÃ´r
=
equipments
useless
.—
Beit.
xii. 28.

l. 47. "Though wounded, they had retained their strength and activity in
battle."—B.,

þÃ¤t hine nÃ´ brond ne beadomÃªcas bÃ®tan ne meahton,
1455
, brond has been
translated
sword, brand
(after the O.N. brand-r). The meaning

fire
may be justified as well, if we consider that the old
helmets were generally made of leather, and only the principal parts
were mounted with bronze. The poet wishes here to emphasize the fact
that the helmet was made entirely of metal, a thing which was very
unusual.—3) in the passage, forgeaf þÃ¢ BeÃ³wulfe brand Healfdenes
segen gyldenne,
1021
, our text, with other editions, has emendated,
bearn, since brand, if it be intended as a designation of HrÃ´ðgÃ¢r
(perhaps
son
), has not up to this time been found in this sense
in A.-S.

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
works.

any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

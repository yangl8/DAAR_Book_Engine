THE CAMPFIRE GIRLS ON STATION ISLAND

CHAPTER IââO-BE-JOYFULâ HENRIETTA

Jessie Norwood, gaily excited, came
bounding into her sitting room waving a slit
envelope over her sunny head, her face alight.
She wore a pretty silk slip-on, a sports skirt, and
silk hose and oxfords that her chum, Amy Drew,
pronounced âthe very swellest of the swell.â

Beside Amy in the sitting room was Nell Stanley,
busy with sewing in her lap. The two visitors
looked up in some surprise at Jessieâs boisterous
entrance, for usually she was the demurest of
creatures.

âWhatâs happened to the family now, Jess?â
asked Amy, tossing back her hair. âWho has
written you a billet-doux?â

âNobody has written to me,â confessed Jessie.
âBut just think, girls! Here is another five dollars
by mail for the hospital fund.â

Jessie had been acting as her motherâs

2

secretary of late, and Mrs. Norwood was at the head
of the committee that had in charge the raising
of the foundation fund for the New Melford
Womenâs and Childrenâs Hospital.

âThat radio concert panned out wonderfully,â
Amy said. âIf Iâd done it all myself it could
have been no better,â and she grinned elfishly.

âWe did a lot to help,â said Nell seriously.
âAnd I think it was just wonderful, our singing
into the broadcasting horns.â

âThis five dollars,â said Jessie, soberly, âwas
contributed by girls who earned the money themselves
for the hospital. That is why I am saving
the envelope and letter. I am going to write
them and congratulate them for mother, when I
get time.â

âNever was such a success as that radio concert,â
Amy said proudly. âI have received no
public resolution of thanks for suggesting itâââ

âI am not sure that you suggested it any more
than the rest of us,â laughed Jessie.

âI like that!â

âI feel that I had a share in it. The Reverend
says it was the most successful money-raising affair
he ever had anything to do with,â laughed
Nell. âAnd he, as a minister, has had a broad
experience.â The motherless Nell Stanley, young
as she was, was the very efficient head of the
household in the parsonage. She always spoke

3

affectionately of her father as âthe Reverend.â

âYes. It is a week now, and the money continues
to come in,â Jessie agreed. âBut now that
the excitement is overâââ

âWe should look for more excitement,â said
Amy promptly. âExcitement is the breath of
Life. Peace is stagnation. The world moves,
and all that. If we get into a rut we are soon
ready for the Old Ladyâs Home over beyond
Chester.â

âIâm sure,â returned Jessie, a little hotly, âwe
are always doing something, Amy. We do not
stagnate.â

âSure!â scoffed her chum, in continued vigor of
speech. âWe go swizzing along like a snail!
âFastâ is the name for usâtied
fast
to a post.
Molasses running up hill in January is about our
natural pace here in Roselawn.â

Nell burst into gay laughter. âGo on! Keep
it up! Your metaphors are wonderfully apt, Miss
Drew. Do tell us what we are to do to get into
high and show a little speed?â

âWell, now, for instance,â said Amy promptly,
her face glowing suddenly with excitement, âI
have been waiting for somebody to suggest what
we are going to do the rest of the summer. But
thus far nobody has said a thing about it.â

âWell, Reverend has his vacation next month.
You know that,â said Nell slowly and quite

4

seriously. âIt is a problem how we can all go away.
And I am not sure that it is right that we should
all tag after him. He ought to have a rest from
Fred and Bob and Sally and me.â

Jessie smiled at the ministerâs daughter appreciatively.
âI wonder if
you
ought not to have a
rest away from the family, Nell?â

âHear! Hear!â cried Amy Drew.

âDonât be foolish,â laughed Nell Stanley. âI
should worry my head off if I did not have Sally
with me, anyway. I think weâd better go up to
the farm where we went last year.â

ââFarmâ doesnât spell anything for me,â said
Amy, tossing her head. âCows and crickets, horses
and grasshoppers, haystacks and hicks!â

âBut we could have our radio along,â Jessie
said quietly. âI could disconnect this oneââpointing
to her receiving set by the windowââand
we might carry it along. It is easy enough to
string the antenna.â

âO-oh!â groaned her chum. âShe calls it easy!
And I pretty nearly strained my back in two distinct
places helping fix those wires after Mark
Stratfordâs old aeroplane tore them down.â

âWell, you want some excitement, you say,â
said Jessie composedly. She went to the radio
instrument, sat down before it, adjusted a set of
the earphones, and opened the switch. âI wonder
what is going on at this time,â she murmured.

5

Amy suddenly cocked her head to listen, although
it could not be that she heard what came
through the ether.

âListen!â she cried.

âWhat under the sun is that?â demanded the
clergymanâs daughter, in amazement.

Jessie murmured at the radio receiver:

âDonât make so much noise, girls. I canât hear
myself think, let alone what might come over the
air-waves.â

âHear that!â shrieked Amy, jumping up.
âThat is no radio message, believe me! It comes
from no broadcasting station. Listen, girls!â

She raised the screen at a window and leaned
out. Jessie, removing the tabs from her ears,
likewise gained some understanding of what was
going on outside. A shrill voice was shrieking:

âMiss Jessie! Miss Jessie! I got the most
wonderful thing to tell you. Oh, Miss Jessie!â

âFor pityâs sake!â murmured Jessie.

âIsnât that little Hen from Dogtown?â asked
Nell Stanley.

âThat is exactly who it is,â agreed Amy, starting
for the door. âLittle Hen is one live wire.
âO-Be-Joyfulâ Henrietta is never lukewarm. There
is always something doing with that child.â

âDo you suppose she can be in trouble?â asked
Jessie, worriedly.

âIf she is, I guarantee it will be something

6

funny,â replied Amy, whisking out of the room.

âMiss Jessie! Miss Jessie! I want to tell
you!â repeated the shrill voice from the front of
the Norwood house.

âCome on, Jessie,â said Nell, dropping her
work and starting, too. âThe child evidently
wants you.â

The others followed Amy Drew down to the
porch. The Norwood house where Jessie, an
only child, lived with her mother and her father,
a lawyer who had his office in New York, was a
large dwelling even for Roselawn, which was a
district of fine houses forming a part of the town
of New Melford. The house was set in the
middle of large grounds. Roses were everywhereâbeds
and beds of them. At one side was the
boathouse and landing at the head of Lake
Mononset. At the foot of the front lawn was
Bonwit Boulevard, across which stood the house
where Amy Drew lived with her father, Wilbur
Drew, also a New York lawyer, and her mother
and her brother Darrington.

But it was that which stood directly before the
gateway of the Norwood place which attracted
the gaze of the three girls. A little old basket
phaeton, drawn by a fat and sleepy looking brown-and-white
pony, and driven by a grinning boy in
overalls and with bare feet, made an object quite
odd enough to stare at. The little girl sitting so

7

very straight in the phaeton, and holding a green
parasol over her head, was bound to attract the
amused attention of any on-looker.

âOh, look at little Hen!â gasped Amy, who
was ahead.

âAnd Montmorency Shannon,â agreed Jessie.
âDonât laugh, girls! Youâll hurt their feelings.â

âThen Iâll have to shut my eyes,â declared
Amy. âThat parasol! And those freckles! They
look green under it. Dear me, Nell, did you ever
see such funny children in your life as those Dogtown
kids?â

Jessie ran down the steps and the path to the
street. When the freckled child saw her coming
she stood up and waved the parasol at the Roselawn
girl.

Henrietta Haney was a child in whom the two
Roselawn girls had become much interested while
she had lived in the Dogtown district of New
Melford with Mrs. Foley and her family. Montmorency
Shannon was a red-haired urchin from
the same poor quarters, and he and Henrietta
were the best of friends.

âOh, Miss Jessie! Miss Jessie! What dâyou
think? Iâm rich!â

âShe certainly is rich,â choked Amy, following
her chum with Nell Stanley. âSheâs a scream.â

âWhat do you meanâthat you are rich, Henrietta?â
Jessie asked, smiling at her little protÃ©gÃ©.

8

âI tell you, I am rich. Or, I am goinâ to be.
I own an island and everything. And thereâs
bungleloos on it, and fishing, and a golf course,
and everything. I am rich.â

âWhat can the child mean?â asked Jessie Norwood,
looking back at her friends. âShe sounds
as though she believed it was actually so.â

9
CHAPTER IIâA PUZZLING QUESTION

Little Henrietta Haney, with her green
parasol and her freckles, came stumbling
out of the low phaeton, so eager to tell
Jessie the news that excited her that she could
scarcely make herself understood at all. She fairly
stuttered.

âIâm rich! I got an island and everything!â
she crowed, over and over again. Then she saw
Amy Drewâs delighted countenance and she
added: âDonât you laugh, Miss Amy, or I wonât
let you go to my island at all. And thereâs radio
there.â

âFor pityâs sake, Henrietta!â cried Jessie.
âWhere is this island?â

âWhere would it be? Out in the water, of
course. Thereâs water all around it,â declared
the freckle-faced child in vigorous language.
âDonât you sâpose I know where an island ought
to be?â

At that Amy Drew burst into laughter. In
fact, Jessie Norwoodâs chum found it very

10

difficult on most occasions to be sober when there
was any possibility of seeing an occasion for
laughter. She found amusement in almost everything
that happened.

But that made her no less helpful to Jessie
when the latter had gained her first interest in
radio telephony. Whatever these two Roselawn
girls did, they did together. If Jessie planned to
establish a radio set, Amy Drew was bound to
assist in the actual stringing of the antenna and
in the other work connected therewith. They always
worked hand in hand.

In the first volume of this series, entitled âThe
Radio Girls of Roselawn,â the chums and their
friends fell in with a wealth of adventures, and
one of the most interesting of those adventures
was connected with little Henrietta Haney, whom
Amy had just now called âO-Be-Joyfulâ Henrietta.

The more fortunate girls had been able to assist
Henrietta, and finally had found her cousin,
Bertha Blair, with whom little Henrietta now
lived. By the aid of radio telephony, too, Jessie
and Amy and their friends were able to help in
several charitable causes, including that of the
building of the new hospital.

In the second volume, âThe Radio Girls on the
Program,â the friends had the chance to speak
and sing at the Stratfordtown broadcasting

11

station. It was an opportunity toward which they
had long looked forward, and that exciting day
they were not likely soon to forget.

A week had passed, and during that time Jessie
knew that little Henrietta had been taken to Stratfordtown
by her Cousin Bertha, where they were
to live with Berthaâs uncle, who was the superintendent
of the Stratford Electric Companyâs sending
station. The appearance of the wildly excited
little girl here in Roselawn on this occasion was,
therefore, a surprise.

Jessie Norwood seized hold of Henrietta by
the shoulders and halted her wild career of dancing.
She looked at Montmorency Shannon accusingly
and asked:

âDo you know what she is talking about?â

âSure, I do.â

âWell, what does she mean?â

âSheâs been talking like that ever since I picked
her up. This is Cabbage-head Tonyâs pony. You
know, he sells vegetables down on the edge of
town. Spotted Snakeâââ

âDonât call Henrietta that!â cried Jessie, reprovingly.

âWell, she gave the name to herself when she
played being a witch,â declared the Shannon boy
defensively. âAnyway, Hen came down to Dogtown
last evening and hired me to drive her over
here this morning.â

12

âAnd when I get some of my money thatâs
coming to me with that island,â broke in Henrietta,
âIâll buy Montmorency an automobile to
drive me around in. This old pony is too slowâa
lot too slow!â

âListen to that!â crowed Amy, in delight.

âBut do tell us about the island, child,â urged
Nell Stanley, likewise interested.

âA man came to Cousin Berthaâs house, where
we live with her uncle.
His
name is Blair, too;
it isnât Haney. Well, this man said: âAre you
Padriac Haneyâs little girl?â And I told him yes,
that I wasnât grown up yet like Bertha. And so
he asked a lot of questions of Mr. Blair. They
was questions about my father and where he was
married to my mother, and where I was born, and
all that.â

âBut where does the island come in?â demanded
Amy.

âNow, donât you fuss me all up, Miss Amy,â
admonished the child. âWhere was I at!â

âYou was at the Norwood place. I brought
you,â said young Shannon.

âDonât you think I know
that
?â demanded the
little girl scornfully. âWell, itâs about Padriac
Haneyâs great uncle,â she hastened to say.
âPadriac was my fatherâs name and his great
uncleâI suppose that means that he was awful
bigâpârâaps like that fat man in the circus we

13

saw. But his name was Padriac too, and he left
all his money and islands and golf courses to my
father. So it is coming to me.â

âGoodness!â exclaimed Nell Stanley. âDid
you ever hear such a jumbled-up affair?â

But Montmorency Shannon nodded solemnly.
âGuess itâs so. Mrs. Foley was telling my mother
something about it. And SpotâI mean, Hen,
must have fallen heiress to money, for she give
me a whole half dollar to drive her over here,â
and his grin appeared again.

âWhat I want to know is the name of the
island, child?â demanded Amy, recovering from
her laughter.

âWell, itâs got a name all right,â said Henrietta.
âIt is Station Island. And thereâs a hotel
on it. But that hotel donât belong to me. And
the radio station donât belong to me.â

âO-oh! A radio station!â repeated Jessie.
âThat sounds awfully interesting. I wonder
where it is!â

âBut the golf course belongs to me, and some
bungleloos,â added the child, mispronouncing the
word with her usual emphasis. âAnd we are
going out to this island to spend the summerâBertha
and me. Mrs. Blair says we can. And
she will go, too. The man that knows about it
has told the Blairs how to get there andâandâI
invite you, Miss Jessie, and you, Miss Amy, to

14

come out on Station Island and visit us. Oh, weâll
have fun!â

âThat sounds better than any old farm,â cried
Amy, gaily. âI accept, Hen, on the spot. You
can count on me.â

âIf it is all right so that we can go, I will promise
to visit you, dear,â Jessie agreed. âBut, you
know, we really will have to learn more about
it.â

âCousin Bertha will tell you,â said the freckle-faced
child, eagerly. âI run away to come down
here to the Foleys, so as to tell you first. You
are the very first folks I have ever invited to come
to live on my island.â

âAinât you going to let me come, SpotâI mean,
Hen?â asked Monty Shannon, who sat sidewise
on the seat and was paying very little attention
to the pony.

As a matter of fact, the pony belonging to the
vegetable vender was so old and sedate that one
would scarcely think it necessary to watch him.
But at this very moment a red car, traveling at
a pace much over the legal speed on a public
highway, came dashing around the turn just below
the Norwood house. It took the turn on
two wheels, and as it swerved dangerously toward
the curb where the pony stood, its rear wheels
skidded.

15

âLook out!â shrieked Amy. âThat car is out
of control! Look, Jess!â

Her chum, by looking at it, nor the observation
of any other bystander, could scarcely avert the
disaster that Amy Drew feared. But she was so
excited that she scarcely knew what she shouted.
And her mad gestures and actions utterly amazed
Jessie.

âHave you got Saint Vitusâs dance, Amy
Drew?â Jessie demanded.

The red, low-hung car wabbled several times
back and forth across the oiled driveway. They
saw a hatless young fellow in front behind the
wheel. In the narrow tonneau were two girls,
and if they were not exactly frightened they did
not look happy.

Nell Stanley cried: âItâs Bill Brewsterâs racing
car; and heâs got Belle and Sally with him.â

âBelle and Sally!â shrieked Amy.

Belle Ringold and her follower, Sally Moon,
were not much older than Amy and Jessie, but
they were overbearing and insolent and had made
themselves obnoxious to many of their schoolmates.
Wishing to appear grown up, and wishing,
above all things, to attract Amyâs brother
Darry and Darryâs chum, Burd Alling, and feeling
that in some way the two Roselawn chums
interfered in this design, they were especially unpleasant
in their behavior toward them.

16

Sometimes Belle and Sally had been able to
make the Roselawn girls feel unhappy by their
haughty speech and what Amy called their âsnippy
ways.â Just now, however, circumstances forbade
the two unpleasant girls annoying anybody.

The others had identified the reckless driver
and his passengers. At least, all had recognized
the party save Montmorency Shannon. He just
managed to jump out of the phaeton in time. The
pony was still asleep when the rear of the skidding
red car crashed against the phaeton and crushed
it into a wreck across the curbstone.

17
CHAPTER IIIâA FLARE-UP

The red car stopped before it completely
overturned. Then, when the exhaust was
shut off, the screams of the two girls in
the back seat could be heard. But nobody shouted
any louder than Montmorency Shannon.

The red-haired boy had leaped from the phaeton
and had seized the pony by the bit. Otherwise
the surprised animal might have set off for home,
Amy said, âon a perfectly apoplectic run.â

The little animal stood shaking and pawing,
nothing but the shafts and whiffle-tree remaining
attached to it by the harness. The rear wheels of
the racing car were entangled in the phaeton and
it was slewed across the road.

âNow see what youâve done! Now see what
youâve done!â one of the girls in the car was saying,
over and over.

âWell, I couldnât help it, Belle,â whined the
reckless young Brewster. âYou and Sally Moon
arenât hurt. And you asked to ride with me, anyway.â

âOh, I donât mean you, Bill!â exclaimed the

18

girl behind him. âBut that horrid boy with his
pony carriage! What business had he to get in the
way?â

âHey! âTainât my carriage, you Ringold girl,â
declared Monty Shannon. âItâs Cabbage-head
Tonyâs. Heâll sue your father for this, Bill Brewster.
And you come near killing me and the pony.â

âI donât see how you came to be standing just
there,â complained the driver of the red car. âYou
might have been on the other side of the drive.â

âHe ought to have been!â declared Belle Ringold
promptly. âHe was headed the wrong way.
Iâll testify for you, Bill. Of course he was headed
wrong.â

âWhy, youâre another!â cried Monty. âIf Iâd
been headed the wrong way youâd have smashed
the pony instead of the carriage.â

âNever mind what they say, Monty,â Jessie
Norwood put in quietly. âThere are three of us
here who saw the collision, and we can testify to
the truth.â

âAnd me. I seen it,â added Henrietta eagerly.
âDonât forget that Spotted Snake, the Witch, seen
it all. If you big girls tell stories about Monty
and that pony, youâll wish you hadnâtânow you
see!â and she began making funny gestures with
her hands and writhing her features into perfectly
frightful contortions.

âHenrietta!â commanded Jessie Norwood, yet

19

having hard work, like Nell and Amy, to keep
from laughing at the freckle-faced child. âHenrietta,
stop that! Donât you know that is not a
polite wayânor a nice wayâto act?â

âWhy, Miss Jessie, they wonât know that,â
complained little Henrietta. âThey are never nice
or polite.â

At this statement Monty Shannon burst out
laughing, too. The red-haired boy could not be
long of serious mind.

âNever you mind, Brewster,â he said to the unfortunate
driver of the red car, who was notorious
for getting into trouble. âNever mind; we ainât
killed. And your father can pay Cabbage-head
Tony all right. It wonât break him.â

âYou impudent thing!â exclaimed Belle Ringold,
who was a very proud and unpleasant girl.
âYou are always making trouble for people,
Montmorency Shannon. It was you who would
not finish stringing our radio antenna at the Carter
place and so helped spoil our picnic.â

âHe didnât! He didnât!â ejaculated Henrietta,
dancing up and down in her excitement. âIt was
meâSpotted Snake! I brought down the curse of
bad weather on your old picnicâthe witchâs curse.
Iâm the one that brought thunder and lightning
and rain to spoil your fun. And Iâll do it again.â

She was so excited that Jessie could not silence
her. Sally Moon burst into a scornful laugh, but

20

her chum, Belle, said, fanning herself as she sat in
the stalled car:

âDonât give them any attention. These Roselawn
girls are just as low as the Dogtown kids.
Thank goodness, Sally, we will get away from
them all for the rest of the summer.â

âYour satisfaction will only be equaled by
ours,â laughed Amy Drew.

âI donât know whether you will get rid of me or
not, Belle,â said Nell Stanley composedly. âIf
you mean to go to Hackle Islandââ

âFather has engaged the handsomest suite at
the hotel there,â Belle broke in. âI fancy Doctor
Stanley will not feel like taking you all there,
Nellie. It is very expensive.â

âOh, no, if we go we shaânât be able to live at
the hotel,â confessed the clergymanâs daughter.
âBut the children will get the benefit of the sea
air.â

âOh!â murmured Amy. âHackle Island is a
nice place.â

âBut it ainât as nice as mine!â Henrietta suddenly
broke in. âMy island is the best. And I
wouldnât let those girls on itânot on my part
of it.â

âWhat is that ridiculous child talking about?â
demanded Belle scornfully, while Bill Brewster
continued to crawl about under his car to discover
if possible what had happened to it. âWhat does
she mean?â

21

âI got an island, and everything,â announced
Henrietta. âIâm going to be just as rich as you
are, but I wonât be so mean.â

âThen you would better begin by not talking
meanly,â advised Jessie, admonishingly.

âWell,â sniffed Henrietta, âI havenât got to let
âem on my island if I donât want to, have I?â

âYou neednât fret,â laughed Sally Moon. âYour
island is like your witchâs curse. All in your mind.â

âIs that so?â flared out little Henrietta. âYour
old picnic was just spoiled by my bad weather,
wasnât it? Well, then, wait till you try to get on
my island,â and she shook a threatening head, and
even her green parasol, in her earnestness.

Sally laughed again scornfully. But Belle
flounced out of the automobile.

âCome on!â she exclaimed. âBill will never get
this car fixed.â

âOh, yes, I will, Belle,â came Billâs muffled voice
from under the car. âI always do.â

âWell, who wants to wait all day for you to
repair it, and then ride home with a fellow all
smeared up with oil and soot? Come on, Sally.â

Sally Moon meekly followed. That was how she
kept in Belle Ringoldâs good graces. You had
to do everything Belle said, and do just as she did,
or you could not be friends with her.

âWell,â Monty Shannon drawled, âas far as I
think, you both can go. I wonât weep none. But

22

Billâs going to weep when he tells his father about
this busted carriage.â

âAll Bill has to do is to deny it,â snapped Belle
Ringold. âNobody would believe you against our
testimony.â

âNobody but the judge,â laughed Amy. âDonât
be such a goose, Belle. We will all testify for
Mr. Cabbage-head Tony.â

Bill crawled out from under his automobile as
the two girls who had been passengers walked
away. He was just as much smutted as Belle said
he would be. But he looked after her and her
friend without betraying any dissatisfaction.

âItâs all right,â he said to Monty. âI guess you
couldnât help being in the way. This car does go
wrong once in a while. You can jump in the car
and Iâll take you home and tell the chap that owns
the pony how it happened. He can come to my
father and get paid.â

âNot much,â said the Dogtown boy. âIâll have
to lead the pony. But you can take Hen back to
Dogtown.â

âIs it safe?â asked Jessie, for Henrietta had
started for the red car at once. She was crazy
about automobiles.

âIf it goes bad again I can get out,â said the
child importantly. âI wonât wait for it to turn
topsy-turvy.â

âShe will be all right,â said Bill Brewster

23

gloomily. âFather will make me pay for this carriage
out of my own money. Iâm rather glad we
are going where I canât use the machine for the
rest of the summer. It eats up all my pocket
money.â

âWhere are your folks going, Billy?â asked
Jessie politely.

âOh, we always go to Hackle Island.â

âEverybody is going to an island,â laughed
Amy. âI guess weâll have to accept Henâs invitation
and go to her island, Jess.â

âItâs a lot better island than that one those girls
are going to,â repeated Henrietta, with confidence,
climbing into the red car.

When the latter was gone, and Monty Shannon
was out of sight, leading the brown and white
pony, the three Roselawn girls discussed little
Henriettaâs story of her sudden wealth, and particularly
of her possession of Station Island, wherever
that was.

âOf course, we wonât understand the rights of
the matter till we see Bertha,â said Jessie. âShe
must know all about it.â

âI wonder where Station Island is situated?â
Amy observed. âLetâs hunt an atlasââ Oh, no,
we wonât! Here is something better.â

âSomething better than an atlas?â laughed
Nell. âA walking geography?â

âYou said it,â rejoined Amy. âPapa knows all

24

about such things. I canât even remember how
New Melford is bounded; but youâd think he had
been all around the world, and walked every step
of the way.â

âAnd you never will know, Amy Drew, if you
ask somebody every time you want to know anything
and never stop to work the thing out yourself,â
admonished Jessie.

âOh, piffle!â exclaimed the careless Amy.
âWhatâs the use?â

Mr. Drew was just coming out of his own
grounds across the boulevard, and his daughter
hailed him.

âWant to ask you an important question, papa,â
cried Amy, running to meet him and hanging to
his arm.

âAhem! If you expect advice, I expect a retainer,â
said the lawyer soberly.

âNothing like that! I know you lawyers. I am
going to wait to see if your advice is worth anything,â
declared his gay daughter. âNow, listen!
Did you ever hear of Station Island?â

âI have just heard of it,â responded the gentleman
promptly.

âOh! Donât be so dreadfully smart,â said
Amy. âI know I am telling youâââ

âWrong. I had just heard of it to-dayâbefore
you mentioned it,â returned her father. âBut I

25

have known of it for a good many years, under
another name.â

âThen you do know where Station Island is,
Mr. Drew?â cried Jessie, eagerly. âWe do so
want to know.â

âThat is the new name they have given the place
since the big radio station was established there.
It is really Hackle Island, girls, and has been
known by that name since our great-grandparentsâ
days.â

26
CHAPTER IVâUNCERTAINTIES

âIt is lucky Henrietta went away before
papa came,â observed Amy, after they
had discussed the strange matter at some
length. âShe certainly would have been mad to
learn that Belle and Sally were likely to visit what
she calls her island, without any invitation from
her.â

âWhat do you suppose it all means?â asked
Jessie.

âShe must have heard some mixed-up account
of an island that belonged to her family,â Nell
said, âand got it twisted. I canât see it any other
way. But I must go home now, girls. The Reverend
and the children need looking after by this
time. Good-bye.â

Mr. Drew did not explain until evening about
his previous knowledge of the island in question.
Then he came over to smoke his after-dinner cigar
on the Norwoodâs porch, and he and Jessieâs
father discussed the matter within the hearing of
their two very much interested daughters. When
their fathers did not object, Jessie and Amy often

27

âlistened inâ on business conversations, and this
one was certainly important to the minds of the
two chums.

âDid Blair telephone you to-day again about
that matter?â Mr. Norwood asked his neighbor.

âNo. It was Mr. Stratford himself. Takes an
interest in Blairâs affairs, you know.â

âIt really concerns that Bertha Blair who was
of so much value to me in the Ellison will case.
You remember?â observed Mr. Norwood.

âAnd it concerns this little freckle-faced child
the girls have had around here so much. Actually,
if the thing pans out the way it looks, Norwood,
that child has got something coming to her.â

âShe has a good deal coming to her if she can
prove she is the daughter of Padriac Haney,â said
Jessieâs father, with vigor.

âYou are inclined to take the matter up?â

âI am. Iâll do all I can. Blair has no money
to riskâââ

âHe wonât need any,â said Mr. Drew, quite as
decisively. âIf you can spend your time on it,
so can I. It wonât break us, Norwood, to help the
child.â

âNot at all,â agreed Mr. Norwood, generously.

âBut is it really true, Daddy, that Hackle Island
belongs to little Henrietta and Bertha?â
asked Jessie.

âA good part of it, apparently. All of the

28

middle of the island,â he returned. âThe Government
owns Sable Point where the old lighthouse
stands and where the radio station is now established.
That has been a government reservation
for years. At the other end is the Hackle Island
Hotel, always popular with a certain class of
moneyed people.â

âI have been there,â said Mr. Drew, nodding.
âBut there is a bunch of bungalows in betweenâââ

âBy the way,â interposed Mr. Norwood, âmy
wife said something about taking one of those for
a month or two. I have the tentative offer of
one.â

âO-oh!â gasped Amy, clasping her hands.

Her father laughed outright. âSee,â he said
to the other lawyer. âYou are going to have a
guest, if you go there. I can see that.â

âThe bungalow is big enough for the girls and
their friends,â admitted Jessieâs father.

âThat beats the farm!â cried Amy to Jessie.

âIt will be nice. And we can take Henrietta
and Bertha along.â

âThey are going in any case, I hear from Blair,â
said Mr. Norwood briskly. âHis wife will take
them. There is an old farmhouse that belongs to
the Haney estate. You see, a part of the bungalow
colony and the Club golf course are included in
the old Haney place. The real estate men who

29

exploited the island a few years ago did not trouble
themselves to get clear title to the land. They
made their bit and got out. Now there are two
parties laying claim to the middle of the island.â

âOh, dear!â cried Jessie. âThen it isnât sure
that little Henrietta will get her island? Too
bad!â

âPersonally I am pretty sure that she will,â said
Mr. Norwood, with conviction. âBut it will cause
a court fight. There is another claimant, as I
say.â

âYou are right,â agreed Mr. Drew. âAnd he
is a fighter. Ringold never gives up a thing until
he has to.â

âGoodness!â breathed Amy. âNot Belleâs
father?â

âIt is the New Melford Ringold,â said Mr.
Drew. âHis claim is based upon an old note that
the original Padriac Haney gave some money-lender.
Ringold bought the paper along with a
lot of other fishy documents. You know, he has
always been a note shaver.â

âI know something about that,â said Mr. Norwood,
grimly. âDonât worry too much about it.
Ringold may have a lot of money, but he wonât
spend too much to try to make good a bad claim.
He doesnât throw a sprat to catch a herring; he
would only risk a sprat for whale bait,â and he
laughed.

30

However, the two girls had heard quite enough
to yield food for chatter for some time to come.
Jessie had kept close watch of the time by her
wrist-watch. She now beckoned her chum, and
they ran indoors and up the stairs to Jessieâs
sitting-room.

âIt is almost time for the concert from Stratfordtown,â
Jessie said. âAnd Bertha telephoned
me yesterday that she hoped to sing to-night.â

âLucky girl!â said Amy, sighing. âItâs nice to
have an uncle who bosses a broadcasting station.
But, never mind, Jess, we had fun the time we were
on the program. Say! the boys will be home to-morrow.â

âNo! Do you mean it?â

âPapa got a wireless. The
Marigold
now has
a real radio telegraph sending and receiving set.
Darry says it is great. But, of course, you and I
canât get anything from them because we do not
know Morse.â

âLetâs learn!â exclaimed Jessie, excitedly.

âSometimes when you get your set tuned wrong
you hear some of the code. But the telegraph
wave-length is much, much longer than the phone
lengths. Guess youâd have a job listening in for
anything Darry and Burd Ailing would send from
that old yacht.â

âWe can learn the Morse alphabet, just the
same, canât we?â demanded her chum.

31

âNow, there you go again!â complained Amy.
âAlways suggesting something that is work. I
donât want to have to learn a single thing until we
go back to school in the fall. Believe me!â

Her emphasis only made Jessie laugh. She adjusted
the crystal detector, or catâs whisker, as the
girls called it, and then began to tune the coil until,
with the tabs at her ears, she could hear a voice
rising out of the void, nearer and nearer, until it
seemed speaking directly in her ear:

âWith which announcement we begin our eveningâs
entertainment from the Stratfordtown Station.
The first number on the program beingâââ

âDo you hear that? It is Mr. Blair himself,â
whispered Amy eagerly. âAnd he saysâââ

Jessie held up her hand for silence as the superintendent
of the broadcasting station at Stratfordtown
went on to announce, âMiss Bertha Blair,
who will sing âWill oâ the Wisp,â Mr. Angler being
at the piano. I thank you.â

The piano prelude came to the ears of the Roselawn
girls almost instantly. Jessie and Amy
smiled at each other. They were proud to think
that they had something to do with Berthaâs becoming
a favorite on the Stratfordtown programs,
and likewise that their interest in the girl first
served to call the superintendentâs attention to
her. In âThe Roselawn Girls on the Programâ

32

is told of Berthaâs first meeting with her uncle who
had never before seen her.

They listened to the hourâs program and then
tuned the receiver to get what was being broadcasted
from a city stationâa talk on economics
that interested to a degree even the two high-school
girls. For frivolous as Amy usually appeared
to be, she was a good scholar and, like
Jessie, stood well in her classes.

There was not much but a desire for fun in
Amyâs mind the next morning, however, when she
ran across the boulevard to the Norwood place.
It was right after breakfast, and she wore her
middy blouse and short skirt, with canvas ties on
her feet. She trilled for Jessie under the radio-room
windows:

âYou-oo! You-oo! âMary Ann! My Mary
Ann! Iâll meet you on the corner!â Come-on-out!â

Jessie appeared from the breakfast room, and
Momsy, as Jessie always called her mother, looked
out, too.

âWhat have you girls on your minds for this
morning?â she asked.

âOur new canoe, Mrs. Norwood. You know,
we gave the old one to those Dogtown youngsters,
and our new one has never been christened yet.â

âShall I bring a hat?â asked Jessie, hesitatingly.

âWhat for? To bail out the canoe? Bill says
it is perfectly sound and safe,â laughed Amy.

33

âYou are getting wee freckles on your nose, Jessie,â
said Mrs. Norwood.

âWhy worry?â demanded Amy. âYou can
never get as many as Hen wearsâand her nose
isnât as big as yours.â

âIt is by good luck, not good management, that
you do not freckle, Amy Drew,â declared her
chum. âIâll take the shade hat.â

âWhy not a sunbonnet?â scoffed Amy.

But Jessie laughed and ran out with her hat. It
floated behind her, held by the two strings, as she
raced her chum down to the boat landing. The
Norwood boathouse sheltered several different
craft, among others a motor-boat that Amyâs
brother, Darrington Drew, owned. But Darry
and his chum, Burd Alling, had lost their interest
in the
Water Thrush
since they had been allowed
to put into commission, and navigate themselves,
the steam-yacht
Marigold
, which was a legacy to
Darry from an uncle now deceased.

The girls got the new canoe out without assistance
from the gardener or his helper. They were
thoroughly capable out-of-door girls. They had
erected the antenna for Jessieâs radio set without
any help. Both were good boatmenââif a girl
can be a man,â to quote Amyâand they could
handle the
Water Thrush
as well as the canoe.

They launched and paddled out from the shore
in perfect form. The sun was scorching, but there

34

was a tempering breeze. It was therefore cooler
out toward the middle of the lake than inshore.
The glare of the sun on the water troubled even
the thoughtless Amy.

âOh, arenât you the wise little owl, Jess Norwood!â
she cried. âTo think of wearing a sun-hat!
And here am I with nothing to shelter me
from the torrid rays. I am going to burn and peel
and look horridâI know I shall! Iâll not be fit
to go to Hackle Islandâif we go.â

âOh, weâre going, all right!â

âYouâre mighty certain, from the way you talk.
Has it been really settled? âThereâs many a slipâ
and all that, you know.â

âFather asked Momsy about it at breakfast before
he went to town, and she said she had quite
made up her mind,â Jessie said. âHe will make
the arrangements with the owner of the house.â

âOh, goody! A bungalow?â cried Amy.

âYes.â

âHow big, dear? Can the boys come?â

âOf course. There are fourteen rooms. It is
a big place. We will shut up the house here and
send down most of the serving people ahead. We
shall have at least one good month of salt air.â

âHooray!â cried Amy, swinging her paddle
recklessly. âAnd Iâve got just the most scrumptious
idea, Jess. Iâll tell youâââ

But something unexpected happened just then

35

that quite drove out of Amy Drewâs mind the idea
she had to impart to her chum. She brought the
paddle she had waved down with an awful smack
on the water. The spray spattered all about.
Jessie flung herself back to escape some of the inwash,
and by so doing her gaze struck upon something
on the surface of the lake, far ahead.

âOh! Oh!â she shrieked. âWhat is that,
Amy? Somebody is drowning!â

36
CHAPTER VâINTO TROUBLE AND OUT

Amy Drew sat up in the canoe as high as
she could and stared ahead. Jessieâs observation
suggested trouble; but Amy
almost immediately burst out laughing.

ââDrowning!ââ she repeated. âWhy, Jess
Norwood, you know that you couldnât drown those
Dogtown kids. And if that isnât some of themâMonty
Shannon, and the Costello twins, and the
rest of themâIâm much mistaken.â

âBut see those barrels and tubs and what-all!â
gasped her more serious friend. âLook there!
Itâs Henrietta!â

The fleet of strange barges that Jessie had first
spied included, it seemed, almost every sort of
craft that could be improvised. A rainwater barrel
led the procession of âboats,â and Montmorency
Shannon was in that, paddling with some
kind of paddle that he wielded with no little skill.

There were two wooden washtubs in which the
Costello twins voyaged. One was much lower in
the water than the other, giving evidence of having
shipped more water than its mate. In a water-trough
that had been filched from somebodyâs
barnyard was little Henrietta and Charlie Foley.

37

âThey will be overboard!â exclaimed Jessie,
anxiously. âDrive ahead, Amyâdo!â

The wind was blowing directly in their faces
and from the direction of the Dogtown landing,
where the flotilla had evidently embarked. The
tubs spun around and around, the half-barrel in
which Monty Shannon sat tried to perform the
same gyrations, but Henrietta and the Foley boy
blundered ahead. It was plain to Jessieâs mind
that the reckless children could not have sailed in
the other direction had they wished to do so.

âWhat do you come out here for?â she shrieked
when the canoe drew near.

âOh, Miss Jessie, we are going to the Carter
place,â sang out Henrietta.

âBut the Carter place is down the lake, not up!â
exclaimed the exasperated Jessie.

âYes. But the wind shifted,â said Henrietta.

âWhere is your big canoe?â demanded Amy,
who could scarcely paddle from laughter, in spite
of the evident danger the children were in.

âThat is what we started after,â said Montmorency
Shannon, his red head sticking out of the
barrel like a full-blown hollyhock. âIt got away in
the night, or somebody let it go, and we saw it
away down by the Carter place. Soâso we
thought weâd go after it.â

âAnd I warrant your mothers donât know what
you are doing,â Jessie said sternly.

38

âOh, they will!â cried Henrietta, virtuously.

âWhen they miss the washtubs,â put in Amy,
with laughter.

âWhen we tell âem,â corrected little Henrietta.
âAnd we always tell âem everything we do.â

âI see. After it is all over,â Jessie commented.

âWe-ell,â said Henrietta, pouting, âwe canât tell
âem what we have done before we do it, can we?
For we never know ourselves.â

âYou certainly cannot beat that for logic,â declared
Amy. She drove the head of the canoe to
the tub of the nearest Costello twin. âGet in here
carefully, Micky. You are going down.â

âThatâs âcause Aloysius always gets the best
tub.
He
ainât sinking none,â said Michael Costello,
scowling at his twin.

âQuick!â commanded Amy, and the disgruntled
Costello swarmed over the side of the canoe. âWe
can take in one more. Who is the nearest
drowned?â

âIâm sitting in half a foot of water,â confessed
the red-haired Shannon, grinning.

âA little soaking will do
you
good. I can guess
who suggested this crazy venture,â Jessie said.
âCome, Henrietta.â

âI need her to trim ship!â cried Charlie Foley.

âWhat do you want to trim your ship withâred,
white and blue?â demanded Amy. âIf that
trough sinks I know you can swim, Charlie.â

39

The crowd would have had some difficulty in
getting back to shore with the wind blowing as
freshly as it did if the girls had not come along
and, in relays, helped them all back.

âWhat Mrs. Shannon will say when she sees her
two washtubs floating off like that, I donât know,â
sighed Henrietta, after they were all ashore.

âOne of âemâs sunk, so she canât see it,â Micky
Costello said calmly. âMaybe the other will go
down. Donât you big girls say anything and maybe
she wonât find it out.â

Jessie and Amy had headed for Dogtown in the
first place without any expectation of playing a life-saving
part. Jessie thought they ought to see
Mrs. Foley, who was fleshy and easy of disposition,
and ask her about Henriettaâs visit. So they
accompanied the freckle-faced little girl to the
Foley house.

âI ainât telling âem all they can come to visit my
island, Miss Jessie,â said the little girl. âBut of
course, the Foleys could come. Mrs. Blair and
Bertha wouldnât mind just them, of course.
Thereâs only Mrs. Foley and Charlie and Billy
and the baby and three more boys andâandâwell,
thatâs all, only Mr. Foley. He wouldnât
want to come.â

âYou would better be sure of your island, and
just how much you own of it, Hen,â advised Amy

40

Drew. âIt may not be big enough to hold everybody
you want to invite.â

âWhy, Miss Amy, itâs a awful big island,â declared
little Henrietta. âItâs got a whole golf link
on it. I heard Mr. Blair say so.â

The âbulgyâ Mrs. Foley welcomed the Roselawn
girls with her usual copiousness. Of course,
she had the youngest Foley in her lap, and the
housework was âat sixes and sevens,â since little
Henrietta had been at Stratfordtown for a week.

âHow Iâm going to git used, young ladies, to
havinâ that child away is more than I can say.
âTis a great mistake I have all boys for childers.
There is nothing like a smart girl around the
house.â

Jessie, very curious, asked the woman what she
knew about Henriettaâs wonderful story of wealth.

âSure, Iâve always expected it would come to
her some day,â declared Mrs. Foley. âHer
mother, who was a good neighbor of mine before
we moved out here to the lake, said Henâs father
come of rich folks. They used to drive their own
carriage. That was before automobiles come in
so plenteous.â

âDid Bertha ever say anything about it, Mrs.
Foley?â

âNot much. âTis Hen will be the rich wan.
Oh, yes. And glad I am if the child is about to
come into her own. Sheâs no business to be

41

running down here every chance she gets. I had himself
telephone to Bertha when he went to town
this morning, and it is likely she will be here after
the child. Henâs as wild as a hawk.â

Bertha Blair, in fact, appeared in a hired car
before Jessie and Amy were ready to return in
their canoe to Roselawn. She was quite as excited
as Henrietta had been about the strange fortune
that promised to come into their lives. Bertha
could tell the chums from Roselawn many
more particulars of the Padriac Haney property.

âIf little Henrietta will only be good and not
be so wild and learn her lessons and mind what
sheâs told,â Bertha said seriously, âmaybe she will
have money and an islandâor part of one, anyway.
But she does not behave very well. She is
as wild as a March hare.â

Little Henrietta looked serious for her; but
Mrs. Foley took her part at once.

âSure donât be expectinâ too much of the child
at wance, Bertha. Sheâs run as wild as the wind
itself here. Sheâs fought and played with these
Dogtown kids since she was able to toddle around.
What would ye expect?â

âBut she must learn,â declared the older girl.
âMrs. Blair wonât take us to the island this summer
if she is not good.â

âThen Iâll go myself,â announced Henrietta.

42

âItâs my island, ainât it? Who has a better right
there?â

Jessie took a hand at this point, shaking her
head gravely at the freckled little girl.

âDo you suppose, Henrietta Haney, that your
friendsâlike Mrs. Foley or Mrs. Blair, or even
Amy and Iâwill want to come to your island to
see you if you are not a good girl?â

âSay, if I get rich canât I do like I want toâlike
other rich folks?â

âYou most certainly cannot. Rich people, if
they are to be loved, must be even more careful in
their conduct than poor folks.â

âWe-ell,â confessed the freckled little girl
frankly, âIâd rather be rich than be loved. If I
canât be both
easy
, Iâll be rich.â

âSuch amazing worldliness!â sighed Amy, raising
her hands in mock horror.

But Jessie Norwood truly wished the little girl
to be nice. Poor little Henrietta, however, had
much to unlearn. She chattered continually about
the island she owned and the riches she was to
enjoy. The smaller children of Dogtown followed
herâand the green parasolâabout as though
they were enchanted.

ââTis a witch she certainly is,â declared Mrs.
Foley. âSheâs bewitched them all, so she has.
But Iâm lost widout her, meself. When a woman

43

has sixâand them all boysâand a man that
drinksâââ

This statement of her personal affairs had been
so often heard by the three girls that they all tried
to sidetrack Mrs. Foleyâs complaint. It was Jessie,
however, who advanced a really good reason
for getting out of the Foley house.

âI promised Monty Shannon I would look at
his radio set,â she said, jumping up. âYou will
excuse us for a little, Mrs. Foley? You are not
going back to Stratfordtown at once, Bertha?â

âBefore long. I have only hired the car for the
forenoon. The man has another job this afternoon.
And I must find that Henrietta again,â for
the freckle-faced little girl was as lively, so Amy
said, as a water-bugââone of those skimmery
things with long legs that dart along the surface
of the water.â

The trio went out and across the cinder-covered
yard to the Shannon house. The immediate surroundings
of Dogtown were squalid, although its
site upon the edge of Lake Mononset might have
been made very pleasant indeed.

âIf these boys like Monty Shannon and some of
the girls stay at home when they grow up they
surely will improve the looks of the village,â Jessie
had said. âFor Monty and his kind are altogether
too smart not to want to live as other people do.â

âYouâve said it,â agreed Amy, with enthusiasm.

44

âHe is smart. He has a better radio receiver than
you have. Wait till you see.â

âHow do you know?â asked the surprised Jessie.

âHe was telling me about it. You know how
often some âsqueak box,â or other amateur operator,
breaks in on our concerts.â

âWe-ell, not so often now,â Jessie said. âI
have learned more about tuning and wave-lengths.
But, of course, I have only a single circuit crystal
receiving set. I have been talking to Dad about
getting a better one.â

âMonty will show you,â Amy said with confidence,
as they knocked at the Shannon door.

The little cottage was small. Downstairs there
were but two rooms. The door gave access to the
kitchen, and beyond was the âsitting-room,â of
which Montyâs mother was inordinately proud.
She was a widow, and helped herself and her children
by doing fine laundry work for the wealthy
people of New Melford.

From the front room when the girls entered
came sounds that they recognizedâradio sounds
which held their instant attention, although they
were merely market reports at that hour in the
forenoon.

âIsnât it wonderful?â Bertha Blair said, clasping
her hands. âI never can get over the wonder
of it.â

45

âSame here,â Amy declared. âWhen Jess and
I listened to you singing the âWill oâ the Wispâ last
night it seemed almost shivery that we should
recognize the very tones of your voice out of the
air.â

âHuh!â exclaimed Montmorency, grinning.
âI got so I know the announcers, too. When that
Mr. Blair speaks I know him. Of course, I know
Mr. Mark Stratfordâs voice, for Iâve talked with
him. I wouldnât have such a fine machine here,
only he advised me.â

âTell me,â Jessie said, âwhat is the difference
between my receiving set and yours, Monty?â

âIf you want to hear clearly and keep outside
radio out of your machine, use a regenerative radio
set with an audion detector. The whole business,
Miss Jessie, is in the detector, after all. A
regenerative set of this kind is selective enoughâthatâs
the expression Mr. Mark usedâto enable
any one to tune out all but a few commercial stations.
And they donât often butt in to annoy you.
For sure, youâll kill all the amateur squeak-boxes
and other transmission stations of that class.

âNow, Iâm going to tune in for Stratfordtown.
They are sending the Government weather reports
and mother wants to know should she water her
tomatoes or depend on a thunderstorm,â and he
grinned at Mrs. Shannon, who stood, an awkward

46

but smiling figure, in the doorway between the two
rooms.

ââTis too wonderful a thing for me to understand,
at all, at all,â admitted the widow. âHowever
can they tell you out of that machine there
is a thunderstorm coming?â

âListen!â exclaimed the boy eagerly. There
was a horn on the set and no need for earphones.
He had tuned the market reports out. From the
horn came a different voice. But the words the
visitors heard had nothing to do with the report
on the weather. âWhatâs the matter?â demanded
Monty Shannon. âListen to this, will you?â

â... she will come home at once. This is
seriousâa serious call for Bertha Blair.â

âDo you hear that?â almost shrieked Amy
Drew. âWhy, it must mean you, Bertha!â

47
CHAPTER VIâCHANGED PLANS

âHow ridiculous!â Jessie cried. âThat
surely cannot mean you, Bertha.â

âHush!â begged Amy. âItâs uncanny.â

Again the slow voice enunciated: âBertha Blair
will come home at once. This is seriousâa serious
call for Bertha Blair.â

âCriminy!â shouted Monty Shannon. âI know
who that is. Itâs Mr. Mark Stratford.â

âHe is calling for you, Bertha,â said Jessie.
âCan it be possible?â

âSomething has happened!â gasped Bertha,
starting for the door of the cottage. âWhere is
that child?â

âNever mind Henrietta. We will take care of
her,â Jessie called after the worried girl, wishing
to relieve her anxiety.

Bertha ran out of the house, and the next moment
the Roselawn girls heard the car start. Bertha
was being whisked away to Stratfordtown.
The voice of Mark Stratford continued to repeat
the call several times. Then he read the weather
report, as expected.

48

âI can tell you one thing,â Jessie said eagerly
to her chum and the Shannons. âMark Stratford
does not usually give out the announcements from
that station. Now, does he, Monty?â

âNo, maâam, Miss Jessie. Only once in a
while.â

âThen something has happened at the Blair
house, or to Mr. Blair himself. That is why they
send out this call, hoping that somebody down
here would get it and tell Bertha.â

âThink! How funny it must feel to hear your
name called out of the air in that way,â Amy remarked.

âWhy, we had that experience ourselves,â Jessie
said. âDonât you remember? Mark thanked
us publicly for finding his watch.â

âBut that was not just like this,â replied Amy.
âAnyway, there is something unsatisfactory about
radioâand always will beâuntil we can âtalk
backâ as well as receive. See! If Monty had a
sending set as well as a receiving, he could have
answered Mark Stratford, and told him Bertha
had heard the call and was starting home without
any delay.â

âI am afraid something really serious has happened,â
Jessie said. âLetâs go back home and
call up Stratfordtown on the telephone.â

âWeâll take Hen along with us,â agreed Amy.
âYou said weâd take care of her.â

49

This the Roselawn girls did. When they set
out from Dogtown in their canoe, Henrietta sat
amidships. She was delighted to visit the Norwoods.
She had stayed over night with Jessie
before.

They passed the flotilla of tubs and barrels that
the Dogtown children had set afloat. Mrs. Shannon
would never see her washtubs again. Meanwhile
the Costello twins and Charlie Foley had set
out to walk around the lake and recover the big
canoe from the place where it had drifted ashore
on the other side.

âThey certainly are the worst young ones,â
commented Amy Drew. âAlways in mischief of
some kind.â

âThere ainât much else to get into at Dogtown,â
said little Henrietta soberly. âWe donât have any
boy scouts or girl scouts or anything like that.
They have
them
at Stratfordtown. Mrs. Blair
told me about âem. I guess Iâll join the girl scouts
and take âem all out on my island.â

Little Henrietta was still intensely excited about
âher island.â What the Roselawn girls heard
over the telephone when they got home again was
not encouraging. It seemed at first that Henrietta
must be disappointed.

Jessie ran in to the telephone as soon as they
arrived. She did not know the number of Mr.
Blairâs private telephoneâif he had one. But she

50

knew how to get in touch with Mark Stratford
whether he was at his home or at the offices of the
Stratford Electric Company. She was able to
speak with the young man almost at once, and
questioned him excitedly.

âYes. I know that Bertha has got home. I
took a chance to reach her at Dogtown when I
heard where she had gone,â Mark Stratford said.
âYou know Monty Shannon is a protÃ©gÃ© of mine,
and I have an idea he is listening in most of the
time at that set he has built.â

âBut what is the matter? Has Mr. Blair been
hurt?â

âIt is Mrs. Blair. She fell downstairs and has
hurt herself severely. Did it not ten minutes after
Bertha went out. Broke her leg. She will be in
bed for weeks. I understand that they were planning
to go away for the summer,â said Mark, sympathetically.
âBut that cannot be now. At least,
I suppose Bertha will have to remain to take care
of her aunt.â

âSh! Donât tell little Hen,â begged Amy
Drew, when she heard this. âThe child will be
heartbroken. Without Bertha and Mrs. Blair
Hennie canât go to her island.â

Jessie made no audible reply to this. And she
certainly had no intention of telling Henrietta the
very worst. She discussed the situation with
Momsy, and before Daddy Norwood returned

51

from town that afternoon mother and daughter
had just about perfected a very nice plan for little
Henrietta.

âWell, you are to go to Hackle Island, Momsy,â
Mr. Norwood said, when he first came in.
âI have signed the agreement. You can send the
people down to make the house ready to-morrow,
if you like. I understand there will not be much
to do about the place. We can all go by the end
of the week.â

âYou take my breath awayâas usual,â laughed
Jessieâs mother. âYou are always so prompt,
Robert.â

âAnd you will have a house full of company, I
suppose?â he rejoined, but looking at Jessie with
a smile.

âWe are going to have one guest you didnât expect,
Daddy,â rejoined his daughter. She told
him swiftly of what had happened at the Blair
home in Stratfordtown. âSo that spoils it all for
little Henrietta, you see, Daddy, if we donât take
her. And you know she is crazy to see what she
calls her island.â

âSure that she wonât make you and Momsy
crazy, Jess?â he asked, his eyes twinkling. âThat
child is as lively as an eel and as noisy as a steam-roller.â

âHow can you say such things, Daddy?â cried
Jessie, shaking a reproving head. âWe have

52

agreed to take her if you and the Blairs are willing.
And Momsy and I will try to teach her the things
sheâll need to know.â

âM-mm. Well, perhaps you will have success.
You have done pretty well with me,â laughed Mr.
Norwood, who made believe that his wife and
daughter had âbrought him up by hand.â âBeing
guided in any way will be a novel experience for
little Hen, that is sure.â

He agreed so well with his wifeâs and Jessieâs
plans, however, that he called Mr. Blair up that
evening and proposed to keep little Henrietta and
take her to Hackle, or Station, Island, while Mrs.
Blair was confined to her house. As Jessieâs father,
along with Mr. Drew, had taken legal charge of
Henriettaâs affairs for the time being, it was right
that the orphan child should be in Mrs. Norwoodâs
care.

âThere is an almost certain chance the child is
going to be very wealthy,â Mr. Norwood said
seriously, to Jessieâs mother. âHer education and
improvement cannot begin too soon. She is as
wild as a hawk and she needs encouragement and
government both.â

Henrietta took quite as a matter of course every
change that came to her. She had no particular
affection for Mrs. Blair, for she had not known
her long enough. She was delighted to go to âher
islandâ with Jessie and her parents. As long as

53

she got there and could survey her domain, little
Henrietta was bound to be satisfied. But Jessie
knew she would have to restrain the child in her
desire to invite everybody she knew and liked to
come to the island while she was there.

The Norwood family had not even discussed
how they were to travel to the islandâby what
routeâwhen Amy Drew bounded in. Jessie and
Henrietta were upstairs in Jessieâs room listening
to the bedtime story. A little girl not much older
than Henrietta was telling the story, and Henrietta
thought that was quite wonderful.

âI know that Bertha and you other big girls
sing into the radio,â the freckle-faced child said,
when it was over. âDo you suppose Mr. Blair
would let me recite into it like that?â

âWhat would you say?â asked Amy, laughing
as her chum and the smaller girl removed their
earphones.

âWhyâwhy,â said Henrietta eagerly, âI would
tell stories, too. Spotted Snake, the Witch, used
to tell stories to Billy Foley and the other Dogtown
kids to keep them quiet. And they liked
âem.â

âWeâll see about that when we come back from
your island, Henrietta,â said Jessie, smiling.

âAnd listen!â exclaimed Amy. âYou remember
I said I had a great idea about our going to
Hackle Island. I didnât finish telling you, Jess.â

54

âThat is right,â her chum rejoined. âAnd no
wonder, when we spied that crew of crazy ones
venturing to sea in tubs!â and Jessie laughed.

âListen here,â Amy said more seriously. âThe
boys have come home. I told you they were due.
The
Marigold
is all right now. Her engines and
everything are working fine. So, why donât we
take this opportunity to see what she is like.
Darry has promised us long enough.â

âOh, but we are going to Hackle Island!â cried
Jessie.

âStation Island,â put in Henrietta. âMy
island.â

âOf course. That is what I mean,â Amy hastened
to say. âInstead of taking the train and then
the regular boat, why not get the boys to take us
all the way from the yacht club moorings to Station
Island, or whatever it is called?â

âWhy, Amy, that would be fine!â cried Jessie.
âWill Darry do it?â

âHe will or I shall disown him as a brother,â
declared her chum, with vigor.

âLetâs run and see what Momsy says!â exclaimed
the eager Jessie.

âWeâd better go and
hear
what she says,â
laughed the irrepressible Amy. âCome on, Hen! You
want to be in it. Wouldnât you like a boat ride
to your island?â

âWhy, how do you suppose I was going to get

55

there?â demanded the little maid. âAutomobiles
donât run to islandsânor yet steam trains. But
I hope the boat wonât leak as bad as that trough
me and Charlie Foley sailed in this morning,â she
added thoughtfully.

56
CHAPTER VIIâFORECASTS

The plan Amy had originated for going to
Station Island on her brotherâs yacht was
approved by Jessieâs mother and father,
and in the end the Drew family agreed to make
the voyage, too. Mrs. Norwood sent down her
housekeeper and a staff of servants in advance so
that everything would be in readiness for the
yachting party.

A few articles of clothing had been bought for
Henrietta when she had gone to the Blairs. But,
besides being few, they were hardly suitable for
an outing on Station Island. So Jessie and Amy
were allowed to use their own taste in selecting
the childâs outfit for the island adventure. And
how they did revel in this novel undertaking!

Being down town on these errands so much during
the following two days, the Roselawn girls
were bound to fall in with Belle Ringold and
Sally Moon, as well as with other members of
their class in the high school. Jessie, at least,
would never have noticed Belle and her chum
could she have avoided it.

57

Amy had an overpowering fondness for a concoction
called a George Washington sundae which
was to be found only at the New Melford Dainties
Shop. So, of course, each shopping âspreeâ must
end with a visit to the confectionary shop in question.

âCome on,â Amy said, on the second day. âI
told Darry and Burd weâd wait for them, and we
might as well ride home as walk. They have our
second car. Cyprian is driving mamma to a round
of afternoon teas and other junkets. But the
boys wonât forget us. Come on.â

ââCome onâ means only one place to come to,â
laughed Jessie. âI know you. What shall we do
on that island, Amy, without any George Washington
sundaes?â

âSay not so!â begged the other girl. âThere
is a fancy hotel there, they say, and perhaps it has
a soda fountain.â

âHi! Amy Drew!â called a voice behind
them, as they descended the two steps into the
Dainties Shop.

âWell, would you ever?â demanded Amy, looking
around with no eagerness. âIf it isnât Sally
Moon and, of course, Belle.â

âHi, Amy!â repeated Sally. âLet me ask you
something.â

âGo ahead,â returned Amy, but in no encouraging
tone. âItâs free to ask.â

58

Sally, however, was not easily discouraged.
Evidently Belle had put her up to ask whatever
the question was, and to keep friendly with Belle
Ringold Sally had to perform a good many unpleasant
tasks.

âYour brother and Burd Alling have got back
with that yacht, havenât they?â she demanded.

âYou are correctly informed,â answered Amy
lightly.

âWe want to see them. I suppose the boat is
all right? That is, it is safe, isnât it?â

âSo far it hasnât sunk with them,â returned
Amy scornfully.

âYou neednât be so snippy, Amy Drew,â broke
in Belle. âWe want to see your brother about
the use of the
Marigold
. I suppose he will let
it to a partyâfor a price?â

âI donât know,â said Amy, staring.

âWhy, thatâs absurd!â Jessie declared, without
thinking. âIt is a pleasure boat, not a cargo
boat.â

Amy began to laugh when she saw Belleâs face.

âThey donât even take passengers for hire,â
she said. âIs that what you want to know?â

âWe want to hire a yacht to take us to Station
Island,â Sally hastened to say. âAnd Belle remembered
Darringtonâs boatâââ

âI donât suppose it is fit to take such a party
as ours will be,â interposed Belle.

59

âI guess Darry wonât want to let it,â said Amy,
seeing that the two girls were in earnest. âBesides,
we are going down ourselves this week.â

âWho are going where?â demanded Belle,
sharply.

âItâs the Norwoodsâ party, you know,â Amy
said, for Jessie had âshut up as tight as a clam.â
âMrs. Norwood has taken a bungalow there.â

âOn Station IslandâHackle Island it used to
be called?â Sally cried.

âThat is the place. And Darry will take us
all on the
Marigold
. So, I guessâââ

âWe might have known it!â exclaimed Belle,
angrily. âThe Norwoods or some of that Roselawn
crowd would tag along if we planned something
exclusive.â

But Amy only laughed at this. âYou donât own
that island, do you? Remember what little Hen
Haney said about owning an island? Well,
Hackle, or Station Island, is the one she meant.
She owns a big slice of it.â

âI donât believe it!â cried Belle.

âShe does. My father says so. And he and
Mr. Norwood are going to get it for her.â

âThey will have a fine time doing that,â sneered
Belle. âWhy,
my
father has a claim upon all the
middle of the island, and he is going to make his
claim good. That nasty little freckle-faced young

60

one from Dogtown will never get a foot of Hackle
Islandâyouâll see!â

Amy shrugged her shoulders as she and Jessie
took seats at a table. She knew how to aggravate
Belle Ringold, and she sometimes rather impishly
enjoyed bothering the proud girl.

âAnd thereâs one thing,â went on Belle, with
emphasis, so exasperated that she did not see
Nick, the clerk, who was waiting for her order,
âI wouldnât go away for the summer unless we
went to a really fashionable hotel. No, indeed!
Cottagers at seaside places are always of such a
common sort!â

Amy only laughed. Jessie remained silent. It
really did trouble her to have these controversies
with Belle. It was not nice and she did not feel
right after they were over.

âThere is something wrong with us, as well as
with Belle,â Jessie said once to Amy, on this topic.

âIâd like to know whatâs wrong with us?â her
chum demanded. âI like that!â

âWhen we squabble with Belle and Sally we
make ourselves just as common as they are.â

âTut, tut! Likewise âgo to,â whatever that
means,â laughed Amy Drew. âWhy, child, if we
did not keep up our end of any controversy that
those girls start they would walk all over us.â

However, on this occasion, and at Jessieâs earnest
desire, Amy hastened the eating of her George

61

Washington sundae and the two friends got out
of the shop before Darry and Burd Alling appeared
in the car.

âWhatâs the matter?â asked Amyâs brother,
when the car stopped before the Dainties Shop
and he saw his sister and Jessie waiting. âSpent
all your money and waiting for us to take you in
and treat you?â

âWe had ours,â Jessie replied promptly, getting
into the tonneau.

âYes, indeed. âHome, James!ââ Amy added,
following her chum.

âAnd so we are to be deprived of our needed
nourishment because you piggy-wiggies have had
enough?â demanded Burd Alling, with serious objection.
âIâguessânot! Come along, Darry,â
and he hopped out of the car.

âYouâd better look ahead before you leap,â
giggled Amy.

âWhatâs that?â asked Darry, hesitating and
looking at his sister curiously.

âWhatâs up her sleeve?â demanded Burd, with
suspicion.

âYou can treat Belle and Sally instead of Jessie
and me, if you go in,â said Amy.

âOh, my aunt!â exclaimed Burd, and sprang
into the automobile again. âDrive on, Darrington!
If you love me take me away before those
girls get their hooks in me.â

62

âDonât mind about you,â growled Darrington,
starting the car. âI will look out for myself, if
you please. I hope I never meet up with those
two girls again.â

At that his sister went off into uncontrollable
laughter.

âTo think!â she cried. âAnd Belle and Sally
are going to be all summer on Station Island!â

âThat settles it,â announced Darry. âBurd
and I will spend our time aboard the
Marigold
.
How about it, Burd?â

âSurest thing you know. At least we can
escape those two on the yacht.â

And this amused Amy immensely, too. For
was not Belle desirous of chartering the
Marigold
?

63
CHAPTER VIIIâABOARD THE âMARIGOLDâ

Before she was ready to go to Station
Island Jessie Norwood had a few purchases
to make that had nothing to do with
little Henrietta Haney. She had decided to disconnect
her radio set and send the instrument
down with the rest of the baggage. In addition,
she was determined to take Monty Shannonâs advice
and buy the additional parts which made the
Dogtown boyâs set so much more successful than
her own.

âWeâll buy wire for the antenna, of course,â
Jessie said to Amy. âLet our old aerial stand
till we return. All we shall have to do will be to
hook it up again when we set up the set in my
room.â

So they bought the wire, the lightning switch,
and the other small parts in New Melford and
sent them all on the truck with the trunks to the
dock where the
Marigold
waited. The next day
the two families, the Norwoods and the Drews,
as well as Burd Alling and little Henrietta, were
whisked to the yacht club dock in several automobiles.

64

The girls had heard from Bertha over the telephone.
And considering the state of mind and
body that Mrs. Blair was in, the poor woman
was probably very well content that Henrietta
should be in Mrs. Norwoodâs care for a while.

The freckle-faced little girl was wild with excitement
when she got aboard Darryâs yacht. She
had never been on such a craft before.

âI declare,â said Amy, âweâll have to put a ball
and chain on this kid, or she will be overboard.â

Henrietta stared at her. âIs that one of those
locket and chain things you wear around your
neck? Iâm going to buy me one when I get my
island. I never did own any joolry.â

This set Amy off into a breeze of laughter, but
Jessie realized that Henrietta was perfectly fearless
and would need watching while they were on
the yacht.

The
Marigold
was by no means a new vessel,
but it was roomy and seaworthy. That it was a
coal-burner rather than a modern oil-burner, or
with gasoline engines, did not at all decrease its
value in the eyes of its young owner. Darry Drew
was inordinately proud of the yacht.

He ran it with a small crew, and he and Burd,
or whoever of his boy friends he had aboard, did
a share of the work.

âI declare!â sniffed Amy, âI suppose you will
expect Jess and me to go down and stoke the

65

furnaces for you if you get short handed. Why
not? You expect Mrs. Norwood and mamma to
do the cooking.â

âOh, thatâs only for this voyage. When we
have only fellows aboard we all take turns cooking
and get along all right.â

âDoes Burd cook?â demanded Amy, in mock
horror.

âWell, he is pretty bad,â admitted Darry, with
a grin. âBut we let him cook only on days when
the sea is rough.â

âAnd why?â demanded his sister, with wide-open
eyes.

âWe never feel much like eating on rough
days,â explained Darry. âYou see, the
Marigold

kicks up quite a shindy when the sea is choppy.â

âLet us hope it will be calm all the way to
Station Island,â Jessie cried.

She had her wish. At least, the wind was fair,
the sea âkicked up no combobberation,â to quote
her chum, and every one enjoyed the sail. If the

Marigold
was not a racing boat, her speed was
sufficient. They had no desire to get to the island
until the following day.

Darryâs sailing master was a seasoned old
mariner named Pandrick. They called him Skipper.
At noon the yacht crossed one of the many
âbanksâ to which New York fishing boats sail and

66

the skipper pronounced the time opportune for
fishing.

âThereâs blackfish and flounders on the bottom
and yellow-fin and maybe bass higher up. You
wonât find a better chance, Mr. Darry,â observed
the sailing master.

Every one grew excited over this prospect, and
the boys got out the tackle and bait. Even Henrietta
must fish. Jessie had been about to suggest
a cushioned seat in the cabin for the little girl,
with a pillow and a rug, for she had seen Henrietta
nodding after lunch. The child would not
hear of anything like that.

The anchor was dropped quietly and the
Marigold

swung at that mooring while the fishermen
took their stations. Darry gave his personal attention
to Henriettaâs bait and showed her how
to cast her line. The little girl had been fishing
many times, if only for fresh water fish, and she
was not awkward.

âDonât you bother âbout me, Miss Jessie,â she
said to her mentor impatiently. âI bet I get a
fish before you do. I ainât so slow.â

Amy had fixed a station for her chum beside her
own in the shade of the awning. Mr. Norwood
and Mr. Drew had brought their rods. Everybody
was soon engaged in an occupation which
really calls for the undivided attention of the

67

fisherman. The boys ordered all of them to keep
quiet.

âYou know,â observed Burd sternly, âalthough
these fish out here may be dumb, they are not deaf.
You chatterboxes keep quiet.â

Jessie was greatly excited. She had a nibble
on her hook, then a positive strike.

âOh! O-ohâ she squealed under her breath.
âThereâsâthereâs something!â

âIs it a wolf or a bear?â demanded Amy,
giggling.

âCan you get it aboard, Jess?â asked Darry,
from the other side of the deck.

Jessie was not awkward. She had pulled in a
good-sized fish before. This one splashed about
a great deal and, when she raised it to the surface,
it looked so much like a big rubber boot
that Jessie squealed and almost dropped it.

âHey! What did I say about that stuff?â
called out Burd. âYouâll give all the fish nervous
prostration. My goodness! What is that?â

He hurried to give Jessie a hand in hauling up
the heavy, slowly flapping fish. It was half as
broad as a dining table, with one side grayish-white
and the other slate color. The skipper gave
it a glance and laughed.

âVirgin,â he said. âWe donât eat that kind oâ
fish.â

68

âOh, dear! isnât it a flounder?â wailed Jessie,
disconsolately.

âNo, no. âTainât worth anything,â said the
skipper, unhooking the heavy and ugly-looking
fish.

They joked Jessie about the worthless flat-fish,
but she laughed, too. Baiting again, she threw
in, and just at that moment there was a heavy
splash from the other side of the yacht.

âSomebody else has got a strike,â cried Amy.
âWho is it?â

Nobody answered. There seemed to be nobody
excited over a bite. The two lawyers were forward.
Darry and Burd were aft. Jessie suddenly
dropped her line and shot across the deck
to the other rail.

âOh, Amy!â she shrieked. âWhere is little
Hen?â

âYou donât mean sheâs gone overboard?â
gasped her chum, excitedly, and she came running
in the wake of Jessie.

Henriettaâs fish line was attached to a cleat on
the yachtâs rail. She had been standing on a coil
of rope so as to be high enough to look over into
the sea. The fear that clamped itself upon Jessie
Norwoodâs mind was that the little girl had dived
headlong over the rail.

âOh, Henrietta!â she cried. âSheâsheâs gone!
Sheâs gone overboard, Amy.â

69

Her chum was quite as fearful as Jessie was,
but she tried to soothe her chum.

âIt canât be, Jess! Sheâshe wouldnât do that!
She just wouldnât!â

âBut you heard that big splash, didnât you?â
cried the frightened Jessie. Then she began to
shout as loud as she could: âHelp! Help! Henriettaâs
overboard! Sheâs gone overboard, I am
sure!â

70
CHAPTER IXâGOSSIP OUT OF THE ETHER

Jessieâs cry startled everybody on deck and
Darry and Burd came running from the
stern.

âWhere is she? Do you see her? Throw out
a buoy!â exclaimed the young owner of the yacht.
âHey, Skipper Pandrick! Lower the boat.â

âMan overboard!â shouted Burd Alling.

âGet out!â exclaimed Darry. âItâs not a man
at all. Itâs little Hen. Is that right, Jessie? Did
you see her fall?â

âNo-o,â replied Jessie. âBut sheâs not here.
Where else could she have gone?â

Burd stared up and all about. Amy said
promptly:

âYou neednât look into the air, Burd. Hen
certainly didnât fly away.â

The skipper arrived, but he was not excited.
âWho did you say had gone overboard, Mr.
Darry?â he asked.

âWhat does it matter? Canât we save her
without so much red tape?â snapped Darry.
âCome on, Skipper! Get out the boat.â

âYou mean the little girl who stood right

71

here?â asked the man. âWell, now, I saw how
she was playing her line. She didnât have it
fastened to a cleat. And she sure didnât just now
fasten it when she went overboard. No, I guess
not.â

âOh! Maybe he is right,â cried Jessie, with
much relief.

âWell, I declare!â grumbled Darry. âIt takes
you girls to stir up excitement.â

âBut where is little Hen?â Amy asked, whirling
around to face her brother.

They all stared at one another. The skipper
wagged his head.

âYouâd better look around, alow and aloft, and
see if she ainât to be found. If she did go down,
she ainât come up again, thatâs sure.â

âBut that splash!â cried Jessie, anxiously.

âWasnât any splash except when I threw that
big flatfish overboard,â said the skipper. âAnd
the little girl didnât scream. I guess sheâs inboard
rather than overboardâyes, maâam!â

The four young people separated and scoured
the yacht, both on deck and below. At least, the
girls looked through the cabin and the staterooms
and the boys went into the tiny forecastle. They
met again in five minutes or so and stared wonderingly
at each other. Little Henrietta had as utterly
disappeared as though she had melted into
thin air.

72

âWhat can have happened to the poor little
thing?â cried Amy, now almost in tears.

âOf course, she must be on the boat if she
hasnât fallen overboard,â Jessie replied hesitatingly.

âThat is wisdom,â remarked Burd Alling,
dryly. âShe hasnât flown away, thatâs sure.â

The two mothers were on the afterdeck in comfortable
chairs; Jessie hated to disturb them, for
Mrs. Norwood and Mrs. Drew had not heard
the first outcry regarding Henrietta. Mr. Norwood
and Mr. Drew were busy with their fishing-lines.
Neither of the four adult passengers had
seen the child.

âIâll be hanged, but that is the greatest kid I
ever saw!â exclaimed Darry Drew with vigor.
âSheâs always in some mischief or other.â

âI am so afraid she is in trouble,â confessed
Jessie. âYou know, we are responsible to her
cousin Bertha Blair for her safety.â

âIf the kid wants to dive overboard, are we to
be held responsible?â demanded Burd, somewhat
crossly.

âYou hard-hearted boy!â exclaimed Amy. âOf
course it is your fault if anything happens to
Hennie.â

âI told you, Drew, that you were making a big
mistake to let this crowd of girls aboard the

Marigold
,â complained the stocky youth, sighing

73

deeply. âWhile this was strictly a bachelor
barque we were all right.â

Jessie, however, was really too much worried
to enter into any repartee of this character. She
ran off again to the cabin to have a second look
for Henrietta. She found no trace of her except
the doll she had brought aboard and the green
parasol.

She went back on deck. The fishermen were
beginning to haul in weakfish and an occasional
tautog, or blackfish. Amy, with a shout, hauled
in Henriettaâs line and got inboard a fine flounder.

âAnyway, weâll have a big fish-fry for supper.
The men will clean the fish and Darry and Burd
will fry them. Your mother and mine, Jess, say
that they have got through with the galley for
the day.â

âOh!â ejaculated Jessie and, whirling suddenly
around, started for the galley slide.

âWhere are you going?â cried Amy. âDo help
me with this flopping fish. I canât get the hook
out.â

Her chum did not halt. She knew that nobody
had thought to look into the cookâs galley that
had been shut up after lunch. She forced back the
slide and peered in.

There on the deck of the little compartment,
with her back against the wall, or bulkhead, was
Henrietta. On one side was a jar of strawberry

74

jam only half full. Much of the sticky sweet
was smeared upon the cracker clutched in the
childâs hand and upon her face and the front of
her frock. Henrietta was asleep!

âWhat is it?â demanded Amy, who had followed
her more excited chum. âWhatâs happened
to her?â

âLook at that!â exclaimed Jessie, dramatically.

Darry and Burd drew near. Amy burst into
stifled laughter.

âWhat do you know about that kid? She
asked me if she could have a bite between meals
and I told her of course she could. But I never
thought she would take me so at my word.â Amyâs
laughter was no longer stifled.

âFishing in the jam jar is more to Henâs taste
than fishing in the ocean,â observed Darry.

âNervy kid!â exclaimed Burd. âIâd like some
of that jam myself.â

âBring him away,â commanded Jessie, pushing
to the slide. âShe might as well sleep. We will
know where she is, anyway.â

This little scare rather broke up the fishing for
the Roselawn girls and the college boys. They
went to the wireless room which had been built
on deck behind the wheelhouse, and Darry put
on the head harness and opened the key by which
he took the messages he was able to obtain out
of the air.

75

The girls were particularly interested in this
form of radio telegraphy at this time. Darry had
bought and was establishing a regular radio telephone
receiving set, too. He could give Jessie
and Amy a deal of information about the Morse
alphabet as used in the commercial wireless
service.

âPractice makes perfect,â he told them. âYou
can buy an ordinary key and sounder and practice
until you can send fast. While you are learning
that you automatically learn to read Morse. But
Iâll have the radio set all right shortly and then
we can get the station concerts.â

âHow near weâll be to that station on the
island!â Amy cried. âIt ought to sound as though
it were right in our ears.â

âNot through your radiophone,â said her
brother. âThat station is a great brute of a commercial
and signal station. It sends clear to the
European shore. No concerts broadcasted from
there. Now, letâs see if we can get some gossip
out of the air.â

The girls took turns listening in, even though
they could not understand more than a letter or
two of Morse. Darry translated for their benefit
certain general messages he caught. They learned
that operators on the trans-Atlantic liners and on
the cargo boats often talked back and forth,
swapping yarns, news, and personal information.

76

Occasionally a navy operator âcrashed inâ with a
few words.

Calls came for vessels all up and down the
North Atlantic. Information as to weather indications
were broadcasted from Arlington. The
air seemed full of voices, each to be caught at a
certain wave-length.

âIt is wonderful!â Jessie exclaimed. ââGossip
out of the airâ is the right name for it. Just think
of it, Amy! When we were born there was very
little known about all this wonderful wireless.â

âSh!â commanded her chum. âDonât remind
folks how frightfully young we are.â

77
CHAPTER XâISLAND ADVENTURES

The
Marigold
loafed along within sight
of the beaches that evening and the girls
and their friends reclined in the deck-chairs
and watched the parti-colored electric
lights that wreathed the shore-front. Jessie was
careful to keep Henrietta near by. She began to
realize that looking after the freckle-faced little
girl was going to be something of a trial.

Henrietta finally grew sleepy and Jessie and
Amy took her below, helped her undress, and
tucked her into a berth. The Roselawn girlsâ
mothers were much amused by this. Their daughters
had taken a task upon themselves that would,
as Mrs. Norwood said, teach them something.

âAnd it will not hurt them,â Mrs. Drew agreed,
with an answering smile. âAmy, especially, needs
to know what âdutyâ means.â

âAnyway, weâll know where she is while she is
asleep,â Jessie said to her chum, as they left the
little girl.

âIf she isnât a somnambulist,â chuckled Amy.
âWe forgot to ask Mrs. Foley or Bertha that.â

78

The ground swell lulled the girls to sleep that
night, and even Henrietta did not awake until
the first breakfast call in the morning. Through
the port-light Jessie and Amy saw Burd Alling
âbursting his cheeks with soundâ as he essayed the
changes on the key-bugle.

The
Marigold
was slipping along the coast
easily, with the northern end of Station Island
already in sight. The castle-like hotel sprawled
all over the headland, but the widest bathing
beach was just below it. Next were the premises
of the Hackle Island Gold Club, with its pastures,
shrubberies, and several water-holes. It was to a
part of these enclosed premises that Mr. Norwood
said little Henrietta Haney was laying
claim.

âAnd I believe she will get it in time. Most
of the land on which those summer houses beyond
the golf course stand is also within the lines of the
Padriac Haney place.â

He explained this to them while they all paced
the deck after breakfast. The yacht was headed
in toward the dock near the bungalows, some of
which were very cheaply built and stood upon
stilts near the shore.

The tall gray staff of the abandoned lighthouse
was the landmark at the extreme southern end
of the island. The sending and receiving station
of the commercial wireless company was at the

79

lighthouse, and the party aboard the
Marigold

could see the very tall antenna connected therewith.

The yacht landed the party and their baggage
about ten oâclock. Mrs. Norwoodâs servants
were at hand to help, and a decrepit express
wagon belonging to a ânativeâ aided in the transportation
of the goods to the big bungalow which
was some rods back from the shore. There were
no automobiles on the island.

âIs this my house?â Henrietta demanded the
moment she learned which dwelling the party of
vacationists would occupy.

âIt may prove to be your house in the end,â
Jessie told her.

âWhenâs the end?â was the blunt query. âHow
long do I have to wait?â

âWe canât tell that. My mother has the house
for the summer. She has hired it for us all to
live in.â

âWho does she pay? Do I get any of the
money?â continued the little girl. âIf this island
is going to be mine some time, why not now? Why
wait for something that is mine?â

It was very difficult for Jessie and Amy to make
her understand the situation. In fact, she began
to feel and express doubts about the attempt that
was being made to discover and settle the legal
phases of the Padriac Haney estate.

80

âIf I donât get my money and my island pretty
soon somebody else will get it instead,â was the
little girlâs confident statement.

âOh, Jess!â exclaimed Amy under her breath,
âsuppose that should be so. You know Belle Ringoldâs
father is trying to prove his title to the
same property.â

âHush!â said Jessie. âDonât let little Hen
hear about that. She is getting hard to manage
as it is. Henrietta! Where are you going now?â
she called after the little girl.

âIâm going out to take a look at some of my
island,â declared the child, as she banged the
screen door.

âSheâs sure to get into trouble,â Jessie observed,
sighing.

âOh, let her go,â Amy declared. âWhy worry?
You canât watch her every minute we are here.
She canât very well fall overboard from this
island.â

âI donât know. She manages to do the most
unexpected things,â said Jessie.

But there was so much to do in helping settle
things and make the sparsely furnished bungalow
comfortable that Jessie did not think for a while
about Henrietta. Besides, she was desirous of
setting up the radio instruments at once and stringing
the antenna.

Darry and Burd helped the girls do this last.

81

They worked hard, for they had first of all to
plant in the sands some distance from the house
an old mast that Mr. Norwood bought so as to
erect the wires at least thirty feet above the
ground.

The antenna were not completed at nightfall.
Then, of a sudden, everybody began to wonder
about Henrietta. Where was she? It was remembered
that she had not been seen during most
of the afternoon.

âOh, dear!â worried Jessie. âIt is my fault.
I should not have let her go out alone that time,
Amy.â

âShe said she wanted to see her island, I remember,â
admitted her chum, with some gravity.
âAnd this island is a pretty big place, and it is
growing dark.â

âShe could not get into any trouble if she
stayed on Hackle Island,â declared Darry. âWhat
a kid!â

âAnd she certainly couldnât have got off it,â
suggested Burd.

âWe must look around for her,â said Jessie,
with conviction. âDonât tell Momsy. She will
worry. She thinks I have had my eye on the child
all the time.â

âYou certainly would have what they call a
roving eye if you managed to keep it on

82

Henrietta,â giggled Burd Alling. âShe darts about like
a swallow.â

Jessie felt it to be no joking matter. The four
young people separated and went in different directions
to hunt for the missing child. Station,
or Hackle, Island at this end was mostly sand
dunes or open flats. A little sparse grass grew in
bunches, and there were clumps of beach plum
bushes. Towards the golf course the land was
higher and there real lawn and trees of some
size were growing.

The low sand dunes stretched in gray windrows
right across the island. Jessie tried to think what
might have first attracted Henrietta at this end
of the island. She did not believe that she would
go far from the bungalow, although Amy wanted
to start at once for the hotel. That was the object
that attracted her first of all.

Jessie ran toward the far side of the island. It
was growing dark and everything on both sea and
shore looked gray and misty. The seabirds swept
overhead and whistled mournfully. Jessie shouted
Henriettaâs name as she ran.

But she began to labor up and down the sand
dunes with difficulty. It frightened Jessie Norwood
very much whenever Henrietta got into mischief
or into danger. No knowing what harm
might come to her on this lonely part of Station
Island.

83

Nor was this fear in Jessieâs mind bred entirely
by the feeling that it was her duty to look out for
Henrietta. The child was an appealing little creature,
though she had had little chance in the world
thus far to develop her better and worthier qualities.
The pity that Jessie Norwood had felt for
the untamed girl at first was now blossoming into
love.

âWhat would I ever say to Bertha and Mrs.
Foley if anything happened to the child!â Jessie
murmured.

84
CHAPTER XIâTROUBLE

Jessie was beginning to learn that to guard
the welfare of a lively youngster like Henrietta
was no small task. The worst of it was,
she was so fond of the little girl that she worried
about her much of the time. And Henrietta
seemed to have a penchant for getting into trouble.

Jessie called, and she called again and again,
as she ploughed through the sand, and heard in
reply only the shrieks of the gulls and peewees.
Gray clouds had rolled up from the Western horizon
and covered completely the glow of sunset.
It was going to be a drab evening, and all the
hollows were already filled with shadow.

Jessie toiled up the slope of one sand-hill after
another, calling and listening, calling and listening,
but all to no avail. What
could
have become of
Henrietta Haney?

Suddenly Jessie fairly tumbled into an excavation
in the sand. Although she could not see the
place, her hands told her that the hole was deep
and the sand somewhat moist. The hole had been
dug recently, for the surface of the dunes was
still warm from the rays of the sun.

85

She stumbled down the slope of the sand dune
and found another hole, then another. Dark as
it was in the hollow, when she kicked something
that rattled, she knew what it was.

âHenriettaâs pail and shovel!â Jessie exclaimed
aloud. âShe has been here.â

She picked up the articles. Before leaving New
Melford she had herself bought the pail and
shovel for the freckle-faced little girl.

Where had the child gone from here? Already
Jessie was some distance from the group of bungalows.
As Henrietta insisted upon believing that
most of the island belonged to her âby good
rights,â there was no telling what part of it she
might have aimed for after playing in the sand.

Jessie shouted again, her voice wailing over the
sands almost as mournfully as the cries of the
sea-fowl. Again and again she shouted, but without
hearing a human sound in reply. She labored
on, and it grew so dark that she began to wish
one of the others had come with her. Even Amyâs
presence would have been a comfort.

She came to the brink of a yawning sand-pit,
the bottom of which was so dark she could not
see it. She began skirting this hollow, crying out
as she went, and almost in tears.

Suddenly Darryâs voice answered her. She
was fond of Darryâthought him a most wonderful

86

fellow, in fact. But there was just one thing
Jessie wanted of him now.

âHave you seen her?â she cried.

âNot a bit. I have been away down to the
lighthouse. Nobody has seen her there.â

âOh! Who you lookinâ for?â suddenly asked
a voice out of the darkness.

âHenrietta!â shrieked Jessie, and plunged
down into the dark sand-pit.

âWhoâs lost?â asked the little girl again.
âOw-ow! IâI guess I been asleep, Miss Jessie.â

âHas that kid shown up at last?â grumbled
Darry, climbing to the sand ridge.

âIs it night?â demanded Henrietta, as Jessie
clasped her with an energy that betrayed her relief.
âWhy, it wasnât dark when I came down
here.â

âHow did you get down there?â demanded
Darry from above.

âI rolled down. I guess I was tired. I dug
so much sandâââ

âDid you dig all those holes I found, Henrietta?â
demanded the relieved Jessie.

âWhy, no, Miss Jessie. I didnât dig holes. I
dug sand and let the holes be,â declared the
freckle-faced little girl scornfully.

Darry sat down and laughed, but while he
laughed Jessie toiled up the yielding sand hill with
her hand clasping Henriettaâs. âOw-ow!â yawned

87

the child again. âWhen do we eat, Miss Jessie?
Or is eating all over?â

âListen to the kid!â ejaculated Darry. âHere!
Give her to me. Iâll carry her. Want to go
pickaback, Hen?â

âWell, itâs dark and nobody can see us. I
donât mind,â said Henrietta soberly. âBut I
guess Iâm too big to be lugged around that way
in common. âSpecially now that I own this islandâor,
most of itâand am going to have money of
my own.â

âSheâs harping on that idea too much,â observed
Darry to Jessie, in a low tone.

The latter thought so too. Funny as little
Henrietta was, the stressing of her expected fortune
was going to do her no good. Jessie began
to see that this fault had to be corrected.

âGoodness!â she thought, stumbling along after
the young collegian and his burden, âI might as
well have a younger sister to take care of. Children,
as Mrs. Foley says, are a sight of trouble.â

They heard Amy and Burd shouting back of
the bungalow, and they responded to their cries.

âDid you find that young Indian?â cried Burd.

âYouâve hit it. This little squaw should be
named âPlenty Troubleâ rather than âSpotted
Snake, the Witch.ââ

âWhy,â said Henrietta, sleepily, â
I
never have
any troubleâof course I donât.â

88

It was about as Jessie said, however: They
were never confident that the freckled little girl
was all right save when she was asleep. She had
bread and milk and went right to bed when they
got home with her. Then the evening was a busy
one for the quartette of older young folks.

The radio set was put into place in the library
of the bungalow. They had brought the two-step
amplifier and proposed to use that for most of
their listening in, rather than the headphones.
Although Darry and Burd helped in this preliminary
work, the girls really knew more about the
adjustment of the various parts than the college
youths.

But in the morning Darry and Burd strung the
wires and completed the antenna. The house connection
was made and the ground connection. By
noon all was complete and after lunch Jessie
opened the switch and they got the wave-length
of a New York broadcasting station and heard a
brief concert and a lecture on advertising methods
that did not, in truth, greatly interest the girls.

After that they tuned in and caught the Stratfordtown
broadcasting. They recognized Mr.
Blairâs voice announcing the numbers of the afternoon
concert program.

But radio did not hold the attention of these
young people all the time, although they had all
become enthusiasts. They were at the seashore,

89

and there were a hundred things to do that they
could not do at home in Roselawn. The sands
were smooth, the surf rolled in white ruffles, and
the cool green and blue of the sea was most attractive.
One of the safest bathing beaches bordering
Station Island was directly in front of the bungalow
colony.

At four oâclock they were all in their bathing
suits and joined the company already in the surf
or along the sands. In any summer colony acquaintanceships
are formed rapidly. Jessie and
Amy had already seen some girls of about their
own age whom they liked the looks of, and they
were glad to see them again at the bathing hour.

âIs it a perfectly safe beach?â Mrs. Norwood
asked, and was assured by her husband that so it
was rated. There were no strong currents or
undertows along this shore. And, in any case,
there was a lifeguard in a boat just off shore and
another patrolling the sands.

âI ainât afraid!â proclaimed Henrietta, dashing
into the water immediately. âCome on, Miss
Jessie! Come on, Miss Amy, you wonât get
drowned at my island.â

âWhat a funny little thing she is,â said one of
the friendly girls who overheard Henrietta.
âDoes she think she owns Station Island?â

âThat is exactly what she does think,â said
Amy, grimly.

90

âI never!â drawled the girl. âAnd there is a
girl up at the hotel who talks the same way. At
least, when she was down here yesterday she said
her father owns all this part of Station Island
and is going to have the bungalows torn down.â

Jessie and Amy looked at each other with understanding.

âI guess I know who that girl is,â said Amy
quickly. âItâs Belle Ringold.â

âYes. Her name is Ringold,â said their new
acquaintance. âDo you suppose it is soâthat her
father can drive us all out of the cottages? You
know, we have already paid rent for the season.â

91
CHAPTER XIIâA DOUBLE RACE

Amy Drew scoffed at the thought of Belle
Ringoldâs tale of trouble for the âbungalowitesâ
being true.

âShe is always hatching up something unpleasant,â
she told the neighbor who had spoken
of Mr. Ringoldâs claim to a part of Station Island.
âWe know her. She comes from our town.â

But little Henrietta continued to tell anybody
who would listen that
she
owned a part of the
island and expected to take possession of the golf
links almost any day. The funny little thing, however,
was very generous in inviting people to remain
on âher island,â no matter what happened.

âSomething has got to be done about that
child,â said Jessie, sighing. âI canât control her.
She does say the most awful things. She has no
manners at all!â

âHe, he,â chuckled Amy. âHen was built without
any controller. I wouldnât worry about her,
Jess. Sheâll come out all right.â

âI hope she comes out of the water all right,â
murmured her chum, starting again after the very

92

lively little girl who occasionally made dashes for
the surf as though she proposed to go right out to
sea.

But for one person Henrietta had some concern.
That was Mrs. Norwood. She thought Jessieâs
mother was a most wonderful person. And when
Mrs. Norwood had a chair and umbrella brought
to the sands and sat down within sight of Henrietta,
the older girls had some opportunity of having
a little amusement with the college boys.

âCome on,â Darry Drew said. âThis staying
inshore is no fun. Beat you to the raft, girls,
and give you ten yards start.â

âO-oh! You canât!â cried his sister, dashing
at once for the sea.

âHold on! Hold on!â commanded Darry. âI
donât believe you even know how long ten yards
is. Both you girls go in and stand even with that
pile yonder. You are headed for the raft. You
see the life saver beyond it, I hope?â

Amy made a face at him, settled her bathing
cap more firmly, and looked at Jessie.

âReady, Jess?â she asked.

âWeâll just beat them good,â declared her
chum. âThey always think they can do things so
much better than us girls.â

ââWeâ girls,â corrected Amy, giggling.

ââWeâ or âusââit doesnât so much matter, as
long as we win the race,â said Jessie.

93

âAll ready out there?â demanded Darry.

âTheyâre edging out farther,â observed Burd
Alling. âIt wouldnât matter if you gave them a
mile start; theyâd take more if they could. Give
âem an inch and theyâll take an ell,â he quoted.

âYou donât know what an ell is,â scoffed his
friend.

âItâs something you put on a house after you
think youâve got all the rooms youâll ever need.
I know,â declared Burd, grinning.

âCome on out!â retorted Darry. âCut the
repartee. You have got to swim your little best,
for those two girls are no slow-pokes.â

âYouâve said something,â agreed Burd. âShoot!
I am ready, Gridley.â

âHuh!â exclaimed his chum. âYou have even
forgotten your Spanish War history.â

âShucks! They change history so fast now
you donât more than learn one phase than you have
to forget it and learn some other fellowâs âhindsightâ
of important events. The only way to get
history straight,â declared the philosophical Burd,
âis to be Johnny-on-the-spot and see things happen.â

âNow!â shouted Darry to the girls.

The four splashed in, the girls starting with a
breast stroke and the boys having to run for some
distance until the sea was deep enough to enable
them to swim. The water beyond the ruffle of

94

surf was almost calm. At least, the waves did not
break, but heaved in, in smooth rollers. As Amy
had said: The sea was taking deep-breathing
exercises.

Just now, however, she was not making jokes.
The two girls were doing their best to win the
race. Darry was a long, rangy fellow, and his
over-hand stroke was wonderful. Burd Allingââtubbyâ
as he wasâwas an excellent swimmer.
The girls started with a dash, however, and they
kept up their speed for some rods before either
felt any fatigue.

The diving raft was a long distance out from
the beach, because the sandy bottom here sloped
very gradually. This part of the island was ideal
for swimming and bathing. If it was finally
proved that the old Padriac Haney estate belonged
to little Henrietta, she would control the
longest strip of beach on the island.

Amy flashed a glance over her shoulder to see
how close they were pursued, and almost lost
stroke.

âCome on!â panted Jessie. âDonât let them
beat you.â

âAinâtâgo-ingâto,â gasped her chum, in four
short breaths.

They were more than half way to the raft, and
it really seemed as though the strongerâand
longerâarms of the two college boys were not

95

aiding them to overtake the Roselawn girls. The
latter began to congratulate each other upon thisâwith
glances. They did not waste any more
breath in speech.

Rising high to change stroke, Jessie turned on
her side and did the over-hand. It heaved her
ahead of her chum for a yard or so; and it likewise
enabled her to see over the raft. The raft
chanced to be deserted, nor were there any swimmers
between her and the boat of the lifeguard
beyond the raft.

The man in the boat suddenly stood up. He
began waving his arms and shouting. As he was
looking shoreward Jessie thought he must be
cheering her and her chum on. She forged still
farther ahead of Amy, and the lifeguard became
more energetic in his motions.

Suddenly he dropped upon the seat of his boat,
grabbed the oars, and pulled the bow of the craft
around, heading it seemed, for the raft. He did
act peculiarly.

From behind her Jessie heard faintly a cry
from her chum:

âOh, Jess! Whatâs that? What is it?â

âWhy, it is the lifeguard,â rejoined Jessie
Norwood, flashing another glance over her
shoulder, but continuing to thrash forward at her
very best speed.

âNo, no! That thing! In the water!â At

96

first Jessie saw nothing ahead but the raft. She
thought the lifeguard was hurrying to the raft
to meet Amy and herself if they won the race.
Another glance that she flashed back swept the
smooth, rolling sea as far as Darry and Burd,
endeavoring to overcome the handicap they had
given the two girl chums.

It was only then that Jessie realized that something
must be happeningâsome threatening thing
that she did not understand. From the rear
Darryâs hail reached Jessieâs ear:

âTurn back! Come back, Jess!â

âWhy! what does he think?â considered Jessie,
amazed. âThat I am going to stop and let him
and Burd beat us? Iâguessânot!â

Then she heard the voice of the lifeguard. He
was driving his boat inshore with mighty strokes;
but he sat facing shoreward, too, using his oars
back-handed. He shouted:

âShark! Shark! Look out for the shark!â

And behind Jessie Norwood her chum took up
the cry:

âShark! Oh, Jess! Shark!â

The word, which had never meant much to Jessie
Norwood in her life before, being merely the
name of a quite unknown fish, suddenly became
the most important of words! She whirled over
and took up the breast stroke. She rose high in
the water again to look.

97

Off at one side and seemingly swimming toward
them from a tangent, came a gray, sail-like thing,
the like of which the Roselawn girl had never
seen before. She accepted as true however the
identification of the lifeguard. He should know.

The race to the raft became suddenly a double
race. More than ever did Jessie Norwood wish
to win it! She desired to outswim the dangerous
fish of which she had heard such terrible stories.

98
CHAPTER XIIIâMORE THAN ONE ADVENTURE

Jessie was badly frightened, but she was not
too scared to swim as hard as she could for
the diving raft. The lifeguard drove his
boat around the end of the raft toward the gray,
sail-like object which had so startled them all.
Jessie remembered of reading that the dorsal fin
of a shark shows above water when it swims at
the surface. This odd looking thing must be itâit
must be!

She measured the distance between it and herself
with some calculation. It came on in a halting,
undecided way. Perhaps the shark had not
yet caught sight of any of the swimmers. Jessie
flung up her arm and shouted at the top of her
voice to her chum:

âCome on! Come on! Donât let him get
you!â

Amy was struggling so hard to reach the raft
now that she had no breath left for speech. Jessie
saw her splashing on in her wake. Behind, the
boys were making a great splashing too, and Jessie
realized that it was for an object. The shark

99

might be frightened away if they made disturbance
enough in the water.

Jessie was now very near the raft and the other
three were bunching up not far behind her. The
lifeguard shot by in his boat, yelling like mad.
Darry shouted:

âGet aboard the raft, girls! Burd and I will
beat him off till you are landed!â

âYou come right on here, Darrington Drew!â
sputtered his sister. âWhat good will you ever
be if you get your leg bit off?â

Jessie reached the raft and seized a loop of
rope hanging from it. If it had not been for this
assistance she doubted if she could have hauled
herself out of the water. When Amy arrived,
her chum was lying over the edge of the refuge,
and reached one arm out for her.

âQuick! Quick!â cried Jessie.

âDoâdonât scare me so!â gasped Amy. âIâI
feel just as though he was nibbling at my toes
right now!â

But it seemed no laughing matter to Jessie Norwood.
Her chum, however, would find a joke in
even the most serious circumstance. And the
moment she lay on the raft beside Jessie she began
to laugh, gaspingly.

âThis is no laughing matter!â Jessie declared.
âHow can you, Amy? Darry and Burdâââ

At that instant a wild shout rose from the two

100

collegians and from the lifeguard who had rowed
so energetically to their rescue. Amy broke off
suddenly in her nervous laughter.

âHeâs got âem!â she shrieked. âOh! Oh!â

But, strange though it seemed to her, Jessie
realized that Darry and Burd were laughing. And
the astonished expletives that the guard emitted
did not seem to show fear.

âWhat is the matter?â Jessie demanded, standing
up.

âAnd where is the shark?â asked Amy, likewise
scrambling to her feet.

The boys were hanging to the side of the
guardâs boat. He was fishing for something in
the water with an oar. He finally got the object
and raised it aloft.

âWhat is it?â repeated Jessie.

âThe shark!â shrieked her chum.

It actually was all the shark there wasâa pair
of partly deflated swimming wings which, carried
here and there by the wind, had looked like a
sharkâs dorsal fin at a distance.

âGood thing you girls saw it,â declared Darry,
when the boys lumbered along to the raft. âIf
you hadnât been so scared you never would have
beat us. Would they, Burd?â

âOf course not,â agreed his friend. âAnd how
Jess can swimâwhen there is a man-eating shark
after her!â

101

âDonât make fun,â Jessie said, somewhat exasperated.
âIt might have been a shark. Then
where would you have been?â

âEither here or inside the shark,â said Darry.
âOne thing sure, he never could have caught you
girls.â

âWell,â Amy sighed, âwe had all the excitement
of racing with a shark, even if the shark
was only in our minds. Iâll never be so scared by
one again.â

âGoodness!â exclaimed Jessie. âI know I shall
always be nervous in the water here after this.
Iâll always be looking for one. What an awful
feeling it is to try to swim when one is being
pursued byâââ

âBy a pair of swimming wings,â chuckled
Burd. âSome imagination youâve got, my dear
Jess.â

There was a serious side to the matter, however.
Although the shark scare had proved to be
groundless, the quartette decided to say nothing
about it to those ashore.

âEspecially to Momsy,â Jessie Norwood said.
âI donât want to make her nervous. Little things
annoy her.â

âSheâll be some annoyed by little Hen, then,â
chuckled Amy. âHen is worse than any shark
you ever saw.â

102

âHow terrible!â cried Jessie. âShe is not a
bad child at all, but she is wild enough.â

When they swam ashore later they found Henrietta
on her good behavior with Momsy. Nobody
on the sands had chanced to see the excitement
out by the raft. Or, if they had, it was
merely supposed that the four young people from
Roselawn were playing in the water.

Jessie, however, felt rather serious about it.
And she knew she would never go into the sea
again at Station Island without thinking about
sharks.

While they were playing hand-ball on the beach,
still in their bathing suits, a low-wheeled pony
carriage came along the drive from the upper end
of the island, and Amyâs sharp eyes spied and
recognized the two girls seated on the back seat
of the vehicle.

âAnd thatâs Bill Brewster driving!â cried Amy.
âSome difference between the speed of that quadruped
and his sports car.â

âOne thing sure,â chuckled Burd. âHe canât
do so much damage with that old Dobbin as he
did with the car he drives about New Melford.â

âBelle and Sally have got a hen on,â said the
slangy Amy to Jessie. âSee them whispering together?â

âI can see what they are up to from right where
I stand,â announced Darry, dropping the ball.

103

âCome on, Burd! Letâs beat it for the raft again.
Thatâs one place those two girls canât follow us
without bathing suits.â

âHe, he!â giggled his sister. âI hope they sit
right down here and wait for you to come ashore.â

âSend out our supper by the lifeguard,â called
Burd, as he followed his chum into the surf. âWe
fear sharks less than we do a certain brand of
featherless biped.â

âI suppose it would be too pointed for us to
run away,â said Amy to Jessie, as Bill Brewster
drove the pony carriage out on to the beach.

âBelle has got her eye on us, that is a fact,â
agreed Jessie.

She was curious, especially after what their
new friend had told them an hour before about the
story that Belle Ringold was circulating. Belle
was eager to talkâas she always was.

âSo your folks got one of these bungalows, did
they, after all, Jess Norwood?â she began. âI
suppose you know there is no surety that you can
keep it a month?â

âI donât know about that. I guess father attended
to the lease. And he is a lawyer, you
know,â said Jessie, quietly.

âPooh! Yes,â said Belle, tossing her head.
âBut there are lawyers and lawyers! My father
has the smartest lawyer in New York working

104

for him. And I suppose you know about the claim
he has against all the middle of this island?â

âWe have heard that
you
have a claim on the
islandâor think you have,â said Amy slyly. âBut,
then, Belle, you always did think you owned the
earth.â

âNow, Miss Smartie, donât be too funny!
Father is going to prove his right to the golf
course and all these bungalows. Donât you fearâ Why!
Thereâs that terrible Henrietta Haney!
How did she come here?â

âShe is with us,â said Jessie shortly.

âOh, indeed! One of your week-end guests,
I suppose?â scoffed Belle. âWe are entertaining
General OâBigger and Mrs. OâBigger at the hotel.
Of course, we would not live in one of these small
bungalowsânot even if we needed a vacation.â

âYou wouldnât,â said Henrietta promptly, âbecause
I wouldnât let you.â

âOh! Oh! Hear that child!â cried Sally Moon.

âNor you, neither,â declared Henrietta. âAll
them houses are mineâor they are going to be.â

âHush, Henrietta,â commanded Jessie, in a low
voice.

âDidnât the funny little thing say something
before about owning an island?â asked Belle,
somewhat puzzled.

âAnd this is it,â said Henrietta. âYou just
try to come into any of them bungleloos! Iâd get

105

a policeman and have him take you out. So
now!â

â
Will
you behave?â said Jessie, feeling like
shaking the child, and in reality leading her away.

Amy came running after them in the midst of
Jessieâs berating of the freckle-faced girl.

âDid you ever hear such nonsense?â Jessieâs
chum demanded. âBelle declares the case is coming
up in court next week and that her father is
going to win. Did you ever?â

Mr. Norwood was sitting with his wife when
they came near to that ladyâs beach chair. Jessie
was anxious enough to ask about Belleâs statement
regarding the imminent court investigation of the
controversy over Station Island.

âWhy, yes, Ringoldâs lawyers claim they have
found new evidence entitling him to be heard as
a claimant to the Padriac Haney estate,â the
lawyer acknowledged. âBut there may not be anything
in it.â

âBut is there a possibility, Robert?â Momsy
asked, seeing how anxious both Jessie and the little
girl looked.

âThere is nothing sure in any case that comes
into court,â declared her husband. âBesides,
those attorneys of Ringoldâs are sharp fellows.
He may make his claim good.â

âOh, dear! Oh, dear!â burst out Henrietta.
âAnd then I wonât have nuthinâ? No island, nor

106

golf link, norânor nuthinâ? Oh, dear me!â

âNever mind, honey,â Jessie begged. âYou
have friends. You have
me
.â And she sat down
on the sands and took the freckle-faced little girl
in her arms.

âYe-es, Miss Jessie. I know I got you,â sobbed
Henrietta. âButâbut you ainât a golf link, nor
you ainât a bungleloo. Andâand I want to turn
that Ringold girl off my island, I do!â

107
CHAPTER XIVâSOMETHING NEW IN RADIO

The Stanleys arrived at Station Island the
next day, the doctor having arranged for a
substitute preacher at the Roselawn
Church for two Sundays. The bungalow they had
arranged to occupy was one of the colony not far
from the big house the Norwoods and their party
were staying in.

Darry and Burd began to spend a good deal of
their time on the yacht after that first day. Amy
accused her brother of being afraid of a flank attack
by Belle Ringold and Sally Moon, and he
admitted that he had hoped to escape those two
âtroublesome kidsâ when he came to the island.

âI came here as the guest of little Hen Haney,â
he declared soberly. âAnd I donât wish to be
annoyed by any girls older than she is.â

But he did not say this within Henriettaâs hearing.
The little girl went around with a very long
face indeed. She seemed to think that she was
going to lose her island. Even Nell Stanley, who
was a general comforter at most times, could not
alleviate little Henriettaâs woe.

With the coming of the Stanleys, however,

108

Henrietta became less of a trial to Jessie. For
Sally Stanley was just about Henriettaâs age and
the two children got along splendidly together.

Bob and Fred, those lively and ingenious
youngsters, made their own friends among the
boys of the bungalow colony. The three girls
from RoselawnâJessie, Amy, and Nellâfound
plenty to do and enjoyed themselves thoroughly
during the next few days. Being all interested in
radio they naturally spent some time at Jessieâs
set. But unfortunately it did not work as well
here as it had at home.

âAnd I do not know why,â Jessie ruminated.
âI have been studying up about it and the more
I read the less I seem to know. There are so many
different opinions about how an amateur set should
be built. Do you know, sometimes I feel as though
I should have an entirely different kind of outfit.
There is a new super-regenerative circuit that is
being talked about.â

âBut some people say it is not practicable for
amateurs,â broke in Nell. âIâve read so, anyway.â

âI should like to talk with some professionalâsome
radio expertâabout that,â Jessie confessed.
âIf I had thought before we left home I would
have spoken to Mr. Blair.â

âYouâll have to wait until you get back, then,â
said Amy promptly.

109

âWhy?â cried Nell suddenly. âThere must be
experts over at that Government station.â

âThat is so,â agreed Jessie, thoughtfully. âDo
you suppose they wouldâââ

âLetâs go and see,â urged Nell. âIâm crazy to
see the inside of that station, anyway.â

âItâs wirelessâlike the little outfit aboard the

Marigold
,â Amy suggested.

âBut so much bigger,â Jessie chimed in eagerly.
âIf they admit visitors, letâs go.â

Mr. Norwood found out about that particular
point for the girls and reported that if they went
over to the station in the late afternoon the operator
on duty would be glad to show them âthe
worksâ and give them all the information in his
power.

The three friends went alone, for the collegians
were off fishing that day on the
Marigold
. They
left the little girls in Mrs. Norwoodâs care and
slipped away about four oâclock and walked to the
station, which was some distance from the bungalow
colony. They had to climb the stairs in the
old shaft of the lighthouse to the wireless room.
The room was half darkened and they heard the
snapping of the spark, and even saw the faint blue
flash of it when they came to the door.

The operator, with his head harness on, was
busy at his set. Jessie, at least, had spent some
time trying to learn the Morse code since talking

110

the matter over with Darry on the yacht. But
although the signals the operator received were
in dots and dashes, she could not understand a
single thing.

âI am afraid it will take us a long time to
learn,â she said to Amy, sighing. âWe shall have
to buy a regular telegraph set and learn in that
way.â

âI wish you wouldnât talk about learning anything!â
cried her chum. âVacation is slipping
right away from us.â

After a few moments the spark stopped snapping,
the operator closed his switch and removed
his harness. He wheeled around on the bench and
welcomed them. He was really a very pleasant
young man, and he explained many things about
both the radio-telegraph and radio-telephone that
the girls had not known before.

He was so friendly that Jessie ventured to ask
him about the new super-regenerative circuit in
which she was interested.

âYes. Iâm strong for that new thing,â said the
wireless operator, enthusiastically. âIn the first
place, it was invented by the man who originated
the ordinary regenerative circuit so much in use
at present, and also of the super-heterodyne circuit.
I understand this new circuit permits a current
amplification up to a million times, and all
with three tubes. You know, to reach such a high

111

mark with your ordinary regenerative circuit,
many more tubes would be necessary.â

âI understand that,â said Jessie. âBut can an
amateur build and practically work this new circuit?â

âWhy not? If you follow directions carefully.
And with the new outfit a loop is just as effective
an antenna as an outside aerial. They say, too,
that to catch broadcasting for not more than
twenty-five miles, not even a loop is needed, the
circuits themselves acting as the absorbers of
energy.â

âIâm going to try it,â declared Jessie, with more
confidence. âBut I feel that I understand so little
about the various forms of radio, after all.â

âYou have nothing on me there,â laughed the
operator. âI am learning something new all the
time. And sometimes I am astonished to find out
how, after five years of work with it, I am really
so ignorant.â

The girls had a very interesting visit at the
station; and from the operator Jessie and Amy
gained some particular instruction about sending
and receiving messages in the telegraph code. He
received several messages from ships at sea while
the girls remained in the station, and likewise relayed
other messages received from inland stations
both up and down the coast and to vessels far out
at sea.

112

âIt is a wonderful thing,â said Nell, as the girls
walked homeward. âI never realized before how
great an influence wireless already was in commercial
life. Why, how did the world ever get along
without it before Marconi first thought of it?â

âHow did the world ever get along without
any other great invention?â demanded Amy.
âThe sewing machine, for instance. Iâve got to
run up a seam in one of my sports skirts, for there
is no tailor, they say, nearer than the hotel. I do
wish a sewing machine had been included in the
furnishings of your bungalow, Jess. I hate to sew
by hand.â

The boys had come in before the Roselawn girls
returned for dinner, and they were very enthusiastic
over a plan for taking a part of the bungalow
crowd on an extended sailing trip. They had met
Dr. Stanley walking the beaches, and he had expressed
a desire to go to sea for a day or two, and
at once Darry and Burd had conceived a plan for
the young folks to be included.

âThe doctor is a good enough chaperon,â said
Darry, with a laugh. âNell shall come. Her
Aunt Freda will be down to look after the
children.â

âAnd Henrietta?â asked Jessie, hesitatingly.

âFor pityâs sake!â cried Darry, in some impatience.
âDonât be tied down to that kid all the
time. Youâd think you were a grandmother.â

113

âWell, I like that!â exclaimed Jessie. âIâm not
sure that I want to go on your old yacht, Darry
Drew.â

âAw, Jessâââ

âWell, Iâll think about it,â murmured Jessie,
relenting.

114
CHAPTER XVâHENRIETTA IN DISGRACE

Darry and Burd seemed to have little time
to spend ashore these days. They said
that they had a lot to do to fix up the

Marigold
for the proposed trip seaward. But
Amy accused them of being afraid of Belle Ringold
and Sally Moon.

âBelle is determined that she shall get an invitation
to sail aboard your yacht, Darry,â teased his
sister. âDonât forget that.â

âNot if we see her first,â responded Burd,
promptly. âAnd donât you ring her in on us, for
if you do weâll not let you aboard the
Marigold

either. How about it, Darry?â

âGood enough,â agreed Amyâs brother.
âOh, I promise not to ring Belle Ringold in on
you,â giggled Amy.

âIt is perfectly disgraceful how you boys teach
these girls slang,â Mrs. Drew remarked with a
sigh.

âWhy, Mother!â cried Darry, his eyes twinkling,
âthey teach it to us. You accuse Burd and
me wrongfully. We couldnât tell these girls a
single thing.â

115

This was at breakfast at the Norwood bungalow.
After breakfast the young folks separated.
But Jessie and Amy had no complaint to make
about the boys. They had their own interests.
This day they had agreed to explore the island
with Nell Stanley as far as the hotel grounds.

They took Henrietta and Sally Stanley along,
and carried a picnic lunch. The older girls were
rather curious to see the extent of âHenriettaâs
domain,â as Amy called it. The pastures included
in the Hackle Island Golf Club grounds covered
all the middle of the island, and consisted of hills
and dells, all âup-and-down-dilly,â Amy observed,
and from a distance, at least, seemed very attractive.

Of course, they could not go fast with the two
smaller girls along, although Henrietta seemed
tireless.

âBut Sally ainât a tough one, like me,â declared
the little girl who thought she was going to own
an island. She approved of Sally Stanley very
much because the ministerâs little girl was dainty,
and kept her dresses clean, and was soft-spoken.
âI got to run and holler once in a while or I thinks
Iâm choking,â confessed Henrietta. âBut your
mamma, Miss Jessie, says Iâll get over that after
a while. She says Iâll go to school and learn a lot
and that
maybe
Iâll be as nice as Sally some day.â

âI hope you will,â said Jessie warmly.

116

âThatâs hardly to be expected,â Henrietta rejoined
in her old-fashioned way. âSally was born
that way. But I always was a tough one.â

âThere is a good deal in that,â sighed Jessie
to the other Roselawn girls. âThe poor little
thing! She never did have a chance. But Momsy
is already talking about sending her away to school
to have her toned down andâââ
âSuppose the Blairs wonât hear to it?â suggested
Amy.
âLeave it to Momsy to work things out her
way,â said Jessie, more gaily.

They soon left the sand dunes behind them and
marched up over what the natives of the island
called âthe downsâ to a scrubby pasture at the
edge of the golf links. Crossing the links watchfully
they only had to dodge a couple of times
when the players called âFore!â and so got safely
past the various greens and reached the patch of
wood between the club premises and the hotel
grounds.

There was a spring here which they had been
told about, and it was near enough noon for lunch
to occupy an important place in their minds. They
spent an hour here; but after that, much as she
had eaten, Henrietta began to run around again.
She could not keep still.

Her voice was suddenly stilled and she halted
in the path and stood like a pointer flushing a

117

covey of birds. The older girls were surprised.
Amy drawled:

âWhatâs the matter, Hen? You donât feel sick,
do you?â

âI hear something,â declared Henrietta, her
freckled face clouding. âI hear somebody talk
that I donât like.â

âWho is that?â asked Nell.

âShe makes me feel sick, all right,â grumbled
the little girl. âOh, yes! Itâs her. And if she
says again that she owns my island, IâllâIâllâââ

âBelle Ringold!â exclaimed Amy, much amused.
âCanât we go anywhere without Belle and Sally
showing up?â

The two girls whom they all considered so unpleasant
appeared at the top of the small hill and
came down the path. They were rather absurdly
dressed for an outing. Certainly their frocks
would have looked better at dinner or at a dance
than in the woods. And they strutted along as
though they quite well knew they had on their very
best furbelows.

âOh, dear me! thereâs that awful child again,â
drawled Belle, before she saw the older girls sitting
at the spring.

âShe must be lost away up here,â said Sally
Moon, idly. âSay, kid, run get this folding cup
filled at the spring.â

âWhat for?â demanded Henrietta.

118

âWhy, so I can drink from it, foolish!â

âYou bring me a drink first,â said the freckle-faced
girl stoutly. âNobody didnât make me your
servant to run your errandsâso now!â

âListen to her!â laughed Belle. âShe waits on
Jess Norwood and Amy Drew hand and foot. Of
course she is a servant.â

âYou ainât a servant when you wait on folks for

love
,â declared Henrietta, quickly.

Amy clapped her hands together softly at this
bit of philosophy. Jessie stood up so that the girls
from the hotel could see her.

âOh! Hereâs Jess Norwood now,â cried Sally.
âYou might know!â

Little Henrietta was backing away from the
two newcomers, but eyeing them with great disfavor.
She suddenly demanded of Jessie:

âIs this spring on a part of my land, Miss
Jessie?â

âIt may be,â said Amy, quickly answering before
Jessie could do so. âLike enough all this
grove is yours, Hen.â

âWhy,â gasped Belle Ringold, âmy father is
just about to take possession of this place. He is
going to have surveyors come on the island and
survey it.â

âThis is my woods!â cried Henrietta. âItâs my
spring! You shaânât even have a drink out of itâneither
of you girls!â

119

âWhat nonsense!â drawled Belle. âWho will
stop us, please?â and she came on down the path
toward the spring.

The other girls had now got up. Jessie tried to
reach out and seize Henrietta; but the latter was
so angry that she jerked away. She stood before
Belle and Sally with flashing eyes and her hands
clenched tight.

âYou go away! This is my woods and my
spring! You shaânât have a drink!â

âThe child is crazy,â said Belle, harshly. âLet
me pass, you mean little thing!â

At that Henrietta stooped and caught up dirt
in each grubby hand. It was a little damp where
she stood, and the muck stuck to her palms. She
shrieked hatred and defiance at Belle and, running
forward, smeared the dirt all up and down the
front of the rich girlâs fine dress.

Belle shrieked quite as loudly as the angry Henrietta
and threatened all manner of punishment.
But she could not catch the freckled girl, who was
as wriggly as an eel.

âIâllâIâll have you whipped! You ought to be
spanked hard!â panted Belle Ringold. âAnd it is
your fault, Jess Norwood. You egged her on.â

âI did not,â said Jessie, angrily.

But she was vexed with Henrietta, too. She ran
after and caught the panting, sobbing little thing.
She really was tempted to shake her.

120

âWhat do you mean, Henrietta Haney, by acting
this way and talking so? Do you want to disgrace
us all? For shame!â

âI donât talk no worse than the Ringold one,â
declared Henrietta.

Jessie tried a new tack. She said more quietly:
âBut
you
know better, Henrietta.â

âYes, maâam.â

âAnd perhaps she doesnât,â ventured Jessie.

âWellâerâsheâs got money,â pouted Henrietta.
âWhy doesnât she hire somebody to teach
her better? You know I never did have any
chance, Miss Jessie.â

She felt she was in disgrace, however, and the
older girls let her feel this without compunction.
Belle was frightfully angry about her frock. She
sputtered and threatened and called names that
were not polite. Finally Jessie said:

âIf you feel that way about it, Belle, send the
dress to the cleanerâs and then send the bill to my
mother. That is all I can say about it. But I
think you brought it on yourself by teasing Henrietta.â

In spite of this speech to Belle, Henrietta felt
that she was in disgrace as Jessie marched her
away from the spring. Little Sally Stanley came
to her other side and squeezed Henriettaâs dirty
hand in sympathy.

âHuh!â snuffled Henrietta. âItâs too bad youâve

121

got the same name as that Moon girl, Sally. Why
donât you ask the minister to change it for you?
He christens folks, doesnât he?â

âWhy, yes,â murmured Sally, uncertainly. âBut
I was christened, you know, oh, years and years
ago.â

âThat donât cut no ice,â replied Henrietta, unconscious
that her language was not all it ought to
be. âYou just have him do it over again. And
donât be no âSally,â nor no more âBelle.ââ

122
CHAPTER XVIââRADIO CONTROLâ

Jessie Norwood had talked over the matter
of the new super-regenerative circuit with
her father and had got him interested in the
idea of using one to improve their own radio receiving.
It was not difficult to interest Mr. Norwood
in it, for he had become a radio enthusiast
like his daughter since the Roselawn girls had
broken into the wireless game.

With the large party now in the Norwoodâs
bungalow in Station Island, it was not convenient
to use only the head-phones when the radio concerts
were to be received out of the ether. The
two-step amplifier Mr. Norwood had formerly
bought did not always work well, especially, for
some unknown reason, since they had come to the
seashore.

In addition, the sounds through the horn seemed
to be scratchy and harsh, a good deal like the
sounds from a poor talking machine. From what
Jessie had read, she understood that these harsh
noises would be obviated if the super-regenerative
circuit was put in. Her father had telegraphed

123

for the material to build the super-regenerative
and amplifier circuit, and the material came by express
the morning after the picnic on which Henrietta
had disgraced herself.

âWe will try the thing here on the island,â
Mr. Norwood said to Jessie. âIf it works here it
will surely work back at Roselawn, for the temperature,
or humidity, or something, is different there
from what it is here. At least, so it seems to me,
and the state of the air surely influences radio.â

âStatic,â said Jessie, briefly, reading the instructions
in the book.

Amy, of course, was quite as interested in the
new invention as her chum; and Nell, too. But
they were not so clear in their minds as was Jessie
about what should be done in building the new set.
Jessie was glad to have her father show so much
interest, for he was eminently practical, and when
the girls were uncertain how to proceed it was nice
to have somebody like the lawyer to turn to.

He even let Mr. Drew and the two mothers go
off to the golf course that day without him, while
he gave his aid to the girls. The boys were cleaning
up the yacht in preparation for the voyage they
expected to make in a short time.

Nellâs Aunt Freda had arrived that morning, so
the ministerâs daughter did not have to worry at
all about Bob and Fred and Sally.

âAnd to help out,â Amy said, with a giggle,

124

âHenrietta is invited over to the Stanley bungalow
to play with little Sally.â

âI guess Aunt Freda will get along all right with
them,â observed Nell, with some amusement.
âBut Fred pretty nearly floored her at the start.
She says it takes her several hours to get âacclimatedâ
when she comes to our house.â

âWhat did Fred sayâor do?â asked Jessie,
interested.

âThere was something Aunt Freda advised him
to do and he said he wouldââto-morrow.â

ââDonât you know,â she asked him, âthat âto-morrow
never comesâ?â

ââGee! and to-morrowâs my birthday,â grumbled
Fred. âNow I suppose I wonât have any.ââ

âWhat kids they are!â gasped Amy, when she
had recovered from her laughter. âI donât know
whether a younger brother is worse than an older
brother or not. Iâve had my troubles with Darrington,â
and she sighed with mock seriousness.

âHa!â exclaimed Jessie. âI guess heâs had his
troubles with you. Do you remember when you
smeared your hands all up with chocolate cake and
tried to wipe them clean on Darryâs new trousers?â

Nell shouted with laughter at this revelation,
but it did not trouble Amy Drew in the least.

âYes,â she admitted. âMy taste in the art of
dressing, you see, was well developed even at that

125

early age. Those trousers, I remember, were of
an atrocious pattern.â

âNonsense!â cried Jessie. âThey were Darryâs
first long pants, and you were mad to think he was
so much older than you that he could put on menâs
clothes.â

âDear me!â sighed Amy. âYou make me out
an awful creature, Jess Norwood. But, never
mind. Darry has paid me up and to spare for
that unladylike trick. He
has
been a trialâand
is so yet. He doesnât know how to pick a decent
necktie. His shirtsâsome of themâare so loud
that you can see him coming clear across The
Green. Why! they tell me that his shirts are as
well known in New Haven, and almost as prominently
mentioned by the natives, as the Hartley
Memorial Hall; and almost
nobody
gets away
from the City of Elms without being obliged to
see that.â

âWhat a reckless talker you are, Amy!â Jessie
said, smiling. âAnd I will not hear you run Darry
down. I think too much of him myself.â

âDonât let him guess it,â said the absent Darryâs
sister, with a grin. âIt will spoil himâmake him
proud and hard to hold.â

âThatâs a good one!â laughed Nell. âYou
think Darry can be as easily spoiled by praise as
the Chinese servant Reverend tells about that he
had in California. This was before I was born.

126

Father and mother got a Coolie right at the dock.
You could do that in those days. And John
scarcely knew a word of English, not even the
pidgin variety.

âBut Reverend says that when John acquired a
few English words he was so proud that there was
no holding him. He asked the name of every new
object he saw and mispronounced it usually in the
most absurd manner. Once John found a sparrowâs
nest in the grapevine and shuffled into Reverendâs
study to tell him about it.

ââIs there anything in the nest yet, John?â Reverend
asked him.

ââYes,â the Chinaman declared, puffed up with
his knowledge of the new language, âSpallow alle
samme got pups.ââ

While they chattered and laughed the three
girls were as busy as bees with the new radio arrangement.
Amy said that Jessie kept them so
hard at work that it did not seem at all as though
they were âvacationing.â It was good, healthy
work for all.

âIt does seem awfully quiet here without Hen,â
went on Amy, hammering on a board with a heavy
hammer and making the big room where the radio
set was, ring. âShe keeps the place almost as
tomb-like as a boiler shopâwhat?â

âYou can make a little noise yourself,â Jessie
told her. âWhatâs all the hammering for?â

127

âSo things wonât sound too tame. How are we
getting on with the new circuit?â

âWhy, Amy Drew! you just helped me place
this vario-coupler. Didnât you know what you
were doing?â

âNot a bit,â confessed Amy. âYou are away
out of my depth, Jess. And donât try to tell me
what it all means, thatâs a dear. I never can remember
scientific terms.â

âPut up the hammer,â said Nell, laughing.
âYou are a confirmed knocker, anyway, Amy. But
I admit I do not understand this tangle of wires.â

They did not seek to disconnect the old regenerative
set that day, for there was much of interest
expected out of the ether before the day was over.
One particular thing Jessie looked for, but she had
said nothing about it to anybody save her very
dearest chum, Amy, and the clergymanâs daughter,
Nell.

Two days before she had done some telephoning
over the long-distance wire. Of course there
was a cable to the mainland from Station Island,
and Jessie had called up and interviewed Mark
Stratford at Stratfordtown.

Mark was a college friend of Darry and Burd,
but he was likewise a very good friend of the Roselawn
girlsâand he had reason for being. As related
in a previous volume, âThe Radio Girls on
the Program,â Jessie and Amy had found a watch

128

Mark had lost, and as it was a valuable watch and
had been given him by his grandmother, Mark was
very grateful.

Through his influenceâto a degreeâJessie and
Amy had got on the program at the Stratfordtown
broadcasting station. And now Jessie had talked
with the young man and arranged for a surprise by
radio that was to come off that very evening at
âbedtime story hour.â

Henrietta and little Sally and Bob and Fred
Stanley, as well as some of the other children of
the bungalow colony, crowded into the house at
that time to âlisten inâ on the Roselawn girlsâ instrument.

The amplifier worked all right that evening,
and Jessie was very glad. The little folks arranged
themselves on the chairs and settees with some
little confusion while Jessie tuned the set to the
Stratfordtown length of wave. There was some
static, but after a little that disappeared and they
waited for the announcement from the faraway
station.

By and by, as Henrietta whispered, the radio
began to âbuzz.â âNow weâll get it!â cried the
little Dogtown girl. âI hope it is about the little
boy with the rabbit ears that he could wiggle.â

âS-sh!â commanded Jessie, making a gesture
for silence.

129

And then out of the air came a deep voice:

âWe have with us this evening, children, the
Radio Man, who, just like Santa Claus, knows all
our little shortcomings, as well as our virtues.
Have you all been good boys and girls to-day?
Donât all say âYesâ at once. Better stop and think
about it before you speak.

âBefore the bedtime story,â went on the voice
out of the horn, âthe Radio Man must tell some of
you that you must take care, or you will get on the
black list. Here is a little girl, for instance, who
may be rich when she grows up. But she must
have a care. People who grow up rich and own
islands must be very nice.â

âOh! Oh! Thatâs me!â gasped Henrietta.
âHowâd he know me?â

âSo I have to warn Henrietta, the little girl I
speak of, that there is a lot she must do if she
wishes in time to enjoy the wealth which she expects.â

At that the other children began to exclaim.
It was Henrietta. They almost drowned out the
first of the bedtime story with their excited voices.

âWell,â exclaimed Henrietta, âI guess everybody
knows about my owning this island, so that
Ringold one neednât talk! But Miss Jessieâs
mother told me what I had got to do to deserve
my island.â

130

âWhat have you got to do?â asked Amy, curiously.
âThe Radio Man says you must be good.â

âMiss Jessieâs mother says Iâve got to make
folks love me or I wonât enjoy my island at allâso
now. But,â she added confidentially, âI donât
believe I ever shall want that Ringold one and
Sally Moon to love me. Do you sâpose thatâs
nec-sary?â

After the children had gone the older girls discussed
a point that Amy brought up regarding the
incident. Of course, Amy was in fun, for she
said:

âListen! Didnât I read something about âradio
controlâ in one of our books, Jess? Well, there is
an example of radio controlâcontrol of children.
Henrietta is going to remember that she is on the
Radio Manâs list. Sheâll be good, all right!â

Mr. Norwood laughed. âHow do we know
what great developments may come within the
next few years in the line of radio control? Already
the control of an aeroplane has been tried,
and proved successful. A submarine may be governed
from the shore. The drive of a torpedo
has already been successfully handled by wireless.

âIn time, perhaps a farmer may sit before a keyboard
in his office and manage tractors plowing
and cultivating his fields. Ships of all descriptions
will be managed by compass control. And automobilesâââ

131

âI hope Bill Brewster learns to handle his red
car by wireless,â chuckled Amy. âIt will then be
less dangerous to himself and to his friends, if not
to pedestrians,â and this quaint idea amused all the
Roselawn girls.

132
CHAPTER XVIIâTHE TEMPEST

Jessie, Amy, and Nell had spied, on their hike
and picnic, an inlet in the shore of the island
facing the mainland, on the sands of which
were several fish houses and several rowboats and
small sailboats that the girls were sure might be
had for hire.

âWe might have shipped our new canoe down
here and had some fun,â Amy said. âThat bay is
a wonderful place to sail in. Why, you can scarcely
see the port on the other side of it. And the
island defends it from the sea. It is as smooth as
can be.â

Nell was very fond of rowing, and she expressed
a wish that they might go out in one of
the open boats. She would row. So the three
chums escaped the younger children the next afternoon
and slipped over to the other side of the
island, across the sand dunes.

They found an old fisherman who was perfectly
willing to hire them a boat, and, really, it was not
a bad boat, either. At least, it had been washed
out and the seats were clean. The oars were
rather heavier than Nell Stanley was used to.

133

âYou need heavy oars on this bay, young lady,â
declared the boat-owner. âNothing fancy does
here. When a squall comes upâââ

âOh, but you donât think it looks like a squall
this afternoon, do you?â Jessie interrupted.

âDunno. Canât tell. Ainât nothing sartain
about it,â said the pessimistic old fellow. âSometimes
you get what you donât most expect on this
bay. I been here, man and boy, all my life, and I
give you my word I donât know nothing about the
weather.â

âOh, come on!â exclaimed Amy, under her
breath. âWhat a Jobâs comforter he is! Who
ever heard of a fisherman before who didnât know
all about the weather?â

âMaybe we had better not go far,â Jessie, who
was easily troubled, said hesitatingly.

âCome on,â said Nell. âHe just wants to keep
us from going out far. He is afraid for his old
tub of a boat.â

She said this rather savagely, and Jessie thought
it better to say nothing more of a doubtful nature,
having two against her. Besides, the sky seemed
quite clear and the bay was scarcely ruffled by the
wind.

The old man sat and smoked and watched them
push off from the landing without offering to help.
He did not even offer to ship the rudder for them,
although that was a clumsy operation. When

134

Jessie and Amy had managed to secure it in place,
while Nell settled herself at the oars, the old man
shouted:

âThat other thing in the bow is a anchor. You
donât use that unless you want to stay hitched
somewhere. Understand?â

âHe must think we are very poor sailors,â said
Jessie.

âI feel like making a face at himâas Henrietta
does,â declared Amy. âI never saw such a cantankerous
old man.â

Nell braced her feet and set to work. She was
an athletic girl and she loved exercise of all kind.
But rowing, she admitted, was more to her taste
than sweeping and scrubbing.

Amy steered. At least, she lounged in the stern
with the lines across her lap. Jessie had taken her
place in the bow, to balance the boat. They
moved out from shore at a fine pace, and even
Amy soon forgot the grouchy old fisherman.

There were not many boats on the bay that
afternoonânot small boats, at least. The steamer
that plied between the port and the hotel landing
at the north of the island at regular hours passed
in the distance. A catboat swooped near the girls
after a time, and a flaxen-haired boy in itâa boy
of about Darry Drewâs ageâshouted something
to them.

âI suppose it is something saucy,â declared

135

Amy. âBut I didnât hear what he said and shaânât
reply. I donât feel just like fighting with strange
boys to-day.â

Jessie was the first to see the voluminous clouds
rising from the horizon; but she thought little of
them. The descending sun began to wallow in
them, and first the girls were in a patch of shadow,
and then in the sunlight.

âDonât you want me to row some, Nell?â Jessie
asked.

âIâm doing fine,â declared the clergymanâs
daughter. âButâbut I guess I am getting a blister.
These old oars are heavy.â

âWe ought to have made him give us two
pairs,â complained Amy. âThen the two of you
could row.â

âListen to her!â cried Jessie. âShe would never
think of taking a turn at them. Not Miss Drew!â

âOh, I am the captain,â declared Amy. âAnd
the captain never does anything but steer.â

They had rowed by this time well up toward the
northerly end of the island. Hackle Island Hotel
sprawled upon the bluff over their heads. It was
a big place, and the grounds about it were attractive.

âI donât see Belle or Sally anywhere,â drawled
Amy. âAnd see! There arenât many bathers
down on this beach.â

âThis is the still-water beach,â explained Jessie.

136

âI guess most of them like the surf bathing on the
other side.â

There were winding steps leading up the bluff to
the hotel. Not many people were on these steps,
but the seabirds were flying wildly about the steps
and over the brow of the bluff.

âWonder what is going on over there?â
drawled Amy, who faced the island just then.

Nell stopped rowing to look at the incipient blister
on her left palm. Jessie bent near to see it,
too. Nobody was looking across the bay toward
the mainland.

âYouâd better let me take the oars,â Jessie said.
âYouâll have all the skin off your hand.â

âWhy should you skin yours?â demanded Nell.
âThese old oars are heavy.â

âHow dark it is getting!â drawled Amy. âEven
the daylight saving time ought not to be blamed
for this.â

Jessie looked up, startled. Over the mainland
a black cloud billowed, and as she looked lightning
whipped out of it and flashed for a moment like a
searchlight.

âA thunderstorm is coming!â she cried. âWeâd
better turn back.â

But when Nell looked up and saw the coming
tempest she knew she could never row back to the
inlet before the wind, at least, reached them.

137

âWeâll go right ashore,â she said with confidence.

âWhat do you say, Amy?â Jessie asked.

âFar be it from me to interfere,â said the other
Roselawn girl, carelessly, and without even turning
around to look. âIâm in the boat and will go
wherever the boat goes.â

Nell, settling to the oars again with vigor, remarked:

âOne thing sure, we donât want the boat overturned
and have to follow it to the bottom. Oh!
Hear that thunder, will you?â

Amy woke up at last. She twitched about in
the stern and stared at the storm cloud. It was
already raining over the port, and long streamers
of rain were being driven by the rising wind out
over the bay.

âWonderful!â she murmured.

âWhere are you going, Nell?â suddenly
shrieked Jessie. âThe boat is actually turning
clear around!â

âDonât blame me!â gasped Nell. âI am pulling
straight on, but that girl has twisted the rudder
lines. Do see what you are about, Amy, and please
be careful!â

âMy goodness!â gasped the girl in the stern.
âItâs going to storm out here, too.â

She frantically tried to untangle the rudder
lines; but while she had been lying idly there, she

138

had twisted them together in a rope, and she was
unable to untwist them immediately. Meanwhile
the thunder rolled nearer, the lightning flashed
more sharply, and they heard the rain drumming
on the surface of the water. Little froth-streaked
waves leaped up about the boat and all three of
the girls realized that they were in peril.

139
CHAPTER XVIIIâFROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER

âLet âem alone, Amy!â begged Jessie,
from the bow. âYou are only twisting
the boatâs head around and making it
harder for Nell to row.â

âIâcouldâdo betterâif the rudder was unshipped,â
declared Nell, pantingly.

Immediately Amy jerked the heavy rudder out
of its sockets. Fortunately she had got the lines
over her head before doing this, or she might have
been carried overboard.

For the rudder was too much for Amy. The
rising waves tore it out of her hands the instant
it was loose, and away it went on a voyage of its
own.

âThere!â exclaimed Jessie, with exasperation.
âWhat do you suppose that grouchy old man will
say when we bring him back his boat without the
rudder?â

âHe wonât say so much as he would if we didnât
bring him back his boat at all,â declared Amy.
âIâll pay for the rudder.â

Jessie felt that the situation was far too serious
for Amy to speak so carelessly. She urged Nell to

140

let her help with the oars; and, in truth, the other
found handling the two oars with the rising waves
cuffing them to and fro rather more than she had
bargained for.

Jessie shipped the starboard oar in the bow and
together she and Nell did their very best. But the
wind swooped down upon them, tearing the tops
from the waves and saturating the three girls with
spray.

âI guess I know what that white-haired boy
tried to tell us,â gasped Amy, from the stern. âHe
must have seen this thunderstorm coming.â

âAll the other boats got ashore,â panted Nell.
âWe were foolish not to see.â

âNobody on lookoutâthatâs it!â groaned Amy.
âOh!â

A streak of lightning seemed to cross the sky,
and the thunder followed almost instantly. Down
came the rainâtempestuously. It drove over the
water, flattening the waves for a little, then making
the sea boil.

âHurry up, girls!â wailed Amy. âGet ashoreâdo!
Iâm sopping wet.â

Jessie and Nell had no breath with which to
reply to her. They were pulling at the top of their
strength. The shore was not far away in reality.
But it seemed a long way to pull with those heavy
oars.

The rain swept landward and drove everybody,

141

even the few bathers, to cover. The shallow water
was torn again into whitecaps and a lot of spray
came inboard as Jessie and Nell tried their very
best to reach the strand.

Amy could do nothing but encourage them.
There was no way by which she might aid their
escape from the tempest. One thing, she did nothing
to hinder! Even she was in no mood for
âmaking fun.â

In fact, this tempest was an experience such as
none of the three girls had seen before. Jessie
and Nell were well-nigh breathless and their arms
and shoulders began to ache.

âLet me exchange with one of you, Nell! Jess!â
cried Amy, her voice half drowned by the noise of
wind and rain.

âStay where you are!â commanded Jessie, from
the bow, as her chum started to come forward.
âYou might tip us over!â

âSit down!â sang the cheerful Nell. âSit down,
youâre rocking the boat!â

âBut I want to help!â complained Amy.

âYou did your helping when you got rid of that
rudder,â returned Nell, comfortingly. âDo be
still, Amy Drew!â

âHow can one be still in such a jerky, pitching
boat?â gasped the other girl. âDoâdo you
think you can reach land, Jessie Norwood?â

142

âIâve hopes of it,â responded her chum. âIt
isnât very far.â

âI wonder how far it is toâto land underneath
the keel?â sputtered Amy.

âFor pityâs sake stop that!â cried Nell Stanley.
âDonât suggest such gloomy and gruesome things.â

âWell,â grumbled Amy, âI believe itâs the nearest
land.â

âI shouldnât be surprised,â panted Jessie. âBut
donât talk about it, Amy.â

The rain swept over and past the small boat in
such heavy sheets that finally the girls could
scarcely see the shore at all. Amy found something
to doâand something of importance. Although
not much water slopped into the boat over
the sides, the rain itself began to fill the bottom.
The water was soon ankle deep.

âBail it! Bail it!â shouted Nell.

âOh! is that what the tin dipper is for?â gasped
Amy. âIâI thought it was to drink out of.â

Afterward âAmyâs drinking cupâ made a joke,
but just then nobody laughed at the girlâs mistake.
She set to work with vigor to bail out the boat,
and kept it up âfor hours and hoursâ she declared,
though the others insisted it was âminutes and
minutes.â

At last they reached the strand.

One of the bathing house men ran out to help
pull the bow of the boat up on the sands.

143

âRun along up to the hotel!â he cried. âThere
is no good shelter down here for you.â

The moment they could do so the three girls
leaped ashore. Thus relieved of their weight, the
boat was the more easily dragged out of the reach
of the waves, which now began to roll in madly.
The lightning increased in its intensity, the thunder
reverberated from the bluff. The tempest
was at its height when they hastened to mount the
winding wooden stair.

âOh, my blister! Oh, my blister!â moaned
Nell, as she climbed upward.

âEverything Iâve got on sticks to me like a twin
sister,â declared Amy Drew. âOh, dear! How
shall we ever get home in these soaked rags?â

âWe must go to the hotel,â cried Jessie. âCome
on.â

She was the first to reach the top of the stairs.
There was a garden and lawn to cross to reach the
veranda. As the rain was beating in from this
direction none of the hotel guests was on this side
of the house. The three wet girls ran as hard as
they could for shelter.

Just as Jessie, leading the trio, came up the
veranda steps, she heard a loud and harsh voice
exclaim:

âWell, of all things! Iâd like to know what you
girls think you are doing here? You have no
business at this hotel. Go away!â

144

Jessie almost stopped, and Amy and Nell ran
into her.

âOh, do go on!â cried Amy. âLet us get inside
somewhereâââ

âWell, I should say
not
!â broke out the harsh
voice again, and the three Roselawn girls beheld
Belle Ringold and Sally Moon confronting them
on the piazza. âJust look at what wants to get
into the hotel, Sally! Did you ever?â

âThey look like beggars,â laughed Sally. âThe
manager would give them marching orders in a
hurry, I guess.â

âDo let us in out of the rain,â Jessie said
faintly. She did not know but perhaps the hotel
people would object to strangers coming inside.
But Amy demanded:

âWhat do you think you have to say about it,
Belle Ringold? Is this something more that you
or your folks own? Do go along, Belle, and let
us pass.â

âNot much; you wonât come in here!â declared
Belle, setting herself squarely in their way. âNo,
you donât! That doorâs locked, anyway. It belongs
to Mrs. Olliverâs private suiteâMrs. Purdy
Olliver, of New York. I am sure she wonât want
you bedrabbled objects hanging around her windows.â

âGo around to the kitchen door,â said Sally

145

Moon, laughing. âThat is where you look as
though you belonged.â

âOh, thatâs good, Sally!â cried Belle. âEx-act-ly!
The kitchen door!â

At that moment another flash of lightning and
burst of thunder made the two unpleasant girls
from New Melford cringe and shriek aloud. They
backed against the closed door Belle had mentioned
as being the wealthy Mrs. Olliverâs private
entrance.

Amy and Nell screamed, too, and the three wet
girls clung together for a moment. The rain came
with a rush into the open porch, and if they could
be more saturated than they were, this blast of rain
would have done it.

âWe have got to get under shelter!â shouted
Jessie, and dragged her two friends farther into
the veranda. Belle and Sally might have been
mean enough to try to drive them back, but at
this point somebody interfered.

A long window, like a door, opened and a lady
looked out, shielding herself from the wind by
holding the glass door.

âGirls! Girls!â she cried. âYou will be
drowned out there. Come right in.â

âFine!â gasped Amy, not at all under her
breath. âBelle doesnât own the hotel, after all!â

âItâs Mrs. Olliver!â exclaimed Sally Moon in
a shrill voice, as she and Belle came out of

146

retirement and likewise approached the open window.

âCome right in here,â said the lady, cheerfully,
as Jessie and her friends approached. âYou are
three very plucky girls. I saw you out in your
boat when the storm struck you. Come in and
Iâll have my maid find you something dry to put
on.â

âOh, fine!â sighed Amy again.

The trio of storm-beaten girls hastened in out
of the wind and rain; but when Belle and Sally
would have followed, Mrs. Olliver stopped them
firmly.

âDonât you belong in the hotel?â she asked.
âThen go around to the main entrance if you
wish to come in. You are at home.â

She actually closed the French windowâbut
gentlyâin the faces of the bold duo. Amy, at
least, was vastly amused. She winked wickedly
at Jessie and Nell Stanley.

âThis will break Belleâs heart,â she whispered.

147
CHAPTER XIXâBOUND OUT

Jessie thought that the very wealthy Mrs.
Purdy Olliver was no different from Momsy
or Mrs. Drew or Nellâs Aunt Freda. She
was just polite and kind. Secretly the girls from
Roselawn thought the lady was very different
from Belleâs mother and Mrs. Moon. Perhaps
that fact was one reason why the unpleasant Belle
Ringold had spoken in some awe of the New York
woman.

She had a really wonderful suite at the Hackle
Island Hotel, for she had furnished it herself and
came here every year, she told her young visitors.
There was a lovely big bath room with both a tub
and a Roman shower.

âThough, you can believe me,â said Amy, âI
donât have any idea that many of the old Romans
had baths like this. It was âthe great unwashedâ
that supported CÃ¦sar. âRoman bathâ is only a
name.â

âWrong! Not about CÃ¦sarâs crowd, but about
the Romans in general as bathers,â answered Jessie.
âRead your Roman history, girl. Or if not

148

thatâand you wonâtâsome historical novels.â

âHumph!â sniffed Amy, but made no further
reply.

The girls laughingly disrobed and tried the
shower, while the maid dried their outer clothing,
furnishing each of the guests with kimono or
negligee. Then they came out into Mrs. Olliverâs
living room and took tea with her.

They did not get their own clothes back until
nearly six oâclock, and saw nothing of Belle and
Sally when they came out of the hotel. Perhaps
that was because they left by Mrs. Olliverâs private
door and ran right down the steps to the
beach where they had left the boat.

The kind woman had asked them to come and
see her again, and was especially cordial when
she knew that Jessie was the daughter of the Mrs.
Norwood who had been chairman of the foundation
fund committee of the Womenâs and Childrenâs
Hospital of New Melford.

âI think that idea of having a radio concert by
which to raise funds for the hospital was unusually
good,â the New York woman said. âIt was the
first thing that interested me in radio-telephony.
I mean to have a set put in here soon. There is
a big one in the hotel foyer, but it does not work
perfectly at all times.â

âDear me,â said Nell, as the girls descended to

149

the beach, âyou run into radio fans everywhere,
donât you? How interesting!â

The boat was all right, only half filled with
water. The bathhouse man came and turned the
craft over for them and emptied it. Jessie
thanked and tipped him and he pushed them off.
Jessie and Amy each took an oar and made Nell
sit in the stern and nurse her blister.

âIt really is something of a blister,â Amy remarked,
looking at it carefully.

âThereâs water in it already, and it hurts!â
wailed the clergymanâs daughter.

âI see the water,â declared Amy. âIt may be
an ever-living spring there. You know, people
have water on the brain and water on the knee;
but seems to me a spring in your hand must be
lots worse.â

âYou never will be serious,â said Nell, half
laughing. âIf the blister was on your handâââ

âDonât say a word! I think I shall have one
before we reach the landing,â declared Amy.
âAnd, girls, what do you suppose that grouchy
old fisherman will say when he sees we lost his
rudder?â

âHe wonât see that,â replied Jessie.

âWhat! Why, listen to her!â gasped Amy.
âIs she going to try to get away before he misses
the rudder?â

âNot at all,â returned her chum calmly, while

150

Nell began to laugh. âIt was
you
who lost the
rudder, Amy Drew. Nell and I had nothing to
do with that crime.â

âOuch!â cried Amy. âI wouldnât have lost it
if it hadnât been for the thunderstorm coming
down on us so suddenly. And that old fellow
didnât warn us of any squall.â

âHe warned us that squalls were prevalent on
the bay,â replied Nell. âHe said he knew nothing
about the weather. And I guess he told the
truth.â

âThere is a great lack of unaminity in this
trio,â complained Amy. âIf I lost the rudder,
didnât we all lose it?â

When they reached the inlet, however, the old
fisherman was just as surprising as he had been in
the first place.

âDonât blame me,â he said when the girls came
ashore. âI told you I didnât know anything about
the weather. I wouldnât have been surprised if
youâd lost the boat.â

âWe only lost a part of it,â said Amy quickly.
âThe rudder.â

âWell, it wasnât much good. I can find another
around somewhere. Lucky to get the hull of the
boat back, I am.â

âYou didnât get the whole of it back, I tell you,â
said Amy, soberly.

151

He blinked at her, and without even a smile,
said:

âOh! You mean that for a joke, do you?
Well, I donât understand jokes any more than I
do the weather. No, you neednât pay me for the
rudder. âTainât nothing.â

The trio had a good deal to talk about when
they got home, but Darry and Burd came in at
dinner with the news that the
Marigold
was all
ready for sea and that they would get under way
right after breakfast the next morning.

Dr. Stanley and his daughter and Jessie and
Amy were to be the boysâ guests on this trip, and
the idea was to go along the coast as far as Boston
and return. Mrs. Norwood had become used by
this time to the boys going back and forth in the
yacht and after her own voyage down to the island
had forgotten her fears for the young folks.

âI am sure Darry will not expose the girls to
danger,â she said to her husband. âBut I am
glad Dr. Stanley is going with them. He has such
good sense.â

Henrietta wanted to go along. She did not
see why she could not go on the yacht if âMiss
Jessie and Miss Amyâ were going. She might
have whined a bit about it, if it had not been that
she was reminded of the Radio Man.

âYou want to look out,â Amy advised her.
âYou know the Radio Man is watching you and

152

like enough heâll tell everybody just how bad you
are.â

âGee!â sighed Henrietta. âItâs awful to be
responsible for owning an island, ainât it?â

The girls were eager to be off in the morning,
and they scurried around and packed their overnight
bags and discussed what they should wear
for two hours before breakfast. Burd was not
to be hurried at his morning meal.

âNo knowing what we may get aboard ship,â
he grumbled. âIf it comes up rough there may
be no chance at all to eat properly.â

âNow, Burd Alling!â exclaimed Amy. âHow
can you?â

âHow can I eat? Perfectly. Got teeth and a
palate for that enjoyment.â

âBut donât suggest that we may have bad
weather. After that tempest yesterdayâââ

âYouâll have no hotel to run to if we get squally
weather,â laughed her brother. âI think, however,
that after that shower we should have clear
weather for some time. Donât let the âBurd Alling
Bluesâ bother you.â

âAnyway,â said Jessie, scooping out her iced
melon with some gusto, âwe have a radio on board
and we can send an S O S if we get into trouble,
canât we?â

âCome to think of it,â said Darry, âthat old
radio hasnât been working any too well. You will

153

have to give it the once over, Jess, when you get
aboard.â

This made Jessie all the more eager to embark
on the yacht. She was so much interested in radio
that she wanted, as Amy said, to be âfooling with
it all of the time!â

But when they got under way and the
Marigold

steamed out to sea there were so many other
things to see and to be interested in that the girls
forgot all about the radio for the time being, in
the mere joy of being alive.

Darry had shipped a cook; but the boys had to
do a good deal of the deck work to relieve the
forecastle hands. Stoking the furnace to keep up
steam was no small job. The engines of the
Marigold

were old and, as Skipper Pandrick said, âwere
hogs for steam.â To tell the truth the boilers
leaked and so did the cylinders. The boys had
had trouble with the machinery ever since Darry
had put the
Marigold
into commission. But the
young owner did not want to go to the expense
of getting new driving gear for the yacht. And,
after all, the trouble did not seem to be serious.

The speed of the boat, however, was all the
girls and other guests expected. The sea was
smooth and blue, the wind was fair, the sun shone
warmly, and altogether it was a charming day.
Nobody expected trouble when everything was so
calm and blissful.

154

But some time before evening haze gathered
along the sealine and hid the main shore and
Hackle Island, too. Nobody expected a sea spell,
however, from this mild warningânot even Skipper
Pandrick.

âThis is a time of light airs, if unsettled,â he
said. âThunderstorms ashore donât often bother
ships at sea. Thereâs lightning in them clouds
without a doubt, but like enough we wonât know
anything about it.â

It was true the
Marigoldâs
company was not
disturbed in the least during the evening. After
dinner the heavy mist drove them below and they
played games, turned on the talking machine, and
sang songs until bedtime. Sometime in the night
Jessie woke up enough to realize that there was
an unfamiliar noise near.

âDo you hear it?â she demanded, poking Amy
in the berth over her head.

âHear what?â snapped Amy. âI do wish you
would let me sleep. I was a thousand miles deep
in it. Whatâs the noise?â

âWhy,â explained Jessie, puzzled, âit sounds
like a cow.â

âCow? Huh! I hope itâs a contented cow, I
do, or else the milk may not be good for your
coffee.â

âShe doesnât sound contented,â murmured Jessie.
âListen!â

155

The silence outside the portlight was shattered
by a mournful, stuttering sound. Nell Stanley sat
up suddenly on the couch across the stateroom and
blinked her eyes.

âOh, mercy!â she gasped. âThere must be a
terrible fog.â

âFog?â squealed Amy. âAnd Jessie was telling
me there was a cow aboard. Is that the fog-horn?
Well, make up your mind, Jess, youâll get
no milk from that animal.â

156
CHAPTER XXâSOMETHING SERIOUS

The three girls did not sleep much after
that. The grumbling, stuttering notes of
the foot-power horn seemed to fill all the
air about the
Marigold
. Darry told them at
breakfast that he used this old-fashioned horn on
the yacht because it took too much steam if they
used the regular horn.

âThis is a great old tub,â complained Burd, who
had spent the previous hour at the device. âShe
makes only steam enough to blow the horn when
you stop the engines. Great! Great!â

âYouâd kick if you were going to be hung,â
observed his chum.

âMight as well be hung as sentenced to the
treadmill. I suppose I have to go back and step
on the tail of that horn after breakfast?â

âYouâll take your turn if the fog does not lift.â

âWhat could be sweeter!â grumbled Burd, and
fell to on the viands before him with a just appreciation
of the time vouchsafed him for the meal.
Burdâs appetite never failed.

The fog, however, lifted. But it was a gray

157

day and the girls looked upon the vessels which
appeared out of the mist about them with an interest
which was half fearful.

âSuppose one of those
had
run into us?â suggested
Jessie. âAnd there is a great liner off
yonder. Why, if that had bumped us we must
have been sunkâââ

âWithout trace,â finished Amy, briskly. âThe
old cowâs mooing did some good, I guess, Jess,â
and she chuckled.

She had told the boys about her chum thinking
there must be a cow aboard in the night, and of
course they all teased Jessie a good deal about it.
She laughed with them at herself, however. Jessie
Norwood was no spoil-sport.

The
Marigold
steamed into the east all that
afternoon. But the weather did not improve.
The hopes of a fair trip were gradually dissipated,
and even the skipper looked about the horizon and
shook his head.

âSeems as though there was plenty of wind
coming, Mr. Darrington,â he said to the owner
of the yacht. âIf these friends of yours are easily
made sea-sick, weâd better get into shelter somewhere.â

âWhereâll we go?â demanded Darry. âHere
we are off Montauk.â

âWith the direction the wind is going to blow
when she gets going, weâd better run for the New

158

Harbor at Block Island and get in through the
breech there. Itâll be calm as a millpond, once
weâre inside.â

When Darry asked the others, however, the
consensus of opinion was that they keep on for
Boston.

âCanât we take the inside passageâgo through
the Cape Cod Canal?â asked Dr. Stanley. âThat
should eliminate all danger.â

âOh, thereâs no danger,â Darry said. âThe
yacht is as seaworthy as can be. But I donât want
any of you to be uncomfortable.â

âIâm a good sailor,â declared Nell.

âYou know Jess and I are used to the water,â
Amy hastened to say. âLet us go on, Darry.â

But the wind sprang up a little later and began
to blow fitfully. The skipper considered it safer
to keep well out to sea. Inshore waters are often
dangerous even for a craft of as light draught as
the
Marigold
.

The crowd sat on deck, keeping as much as possible
in the shelter of the deckhouse, and were
just as jolly as though there was no such thing
on the whole ocean as a storm. Dr. Stanley told
them several of his funny stories, and amused the
young folks immensely.

In the midst of the general hilarity Nell went
below for something. She was gone for some
minutes and Jessie, at least, began to wonder

159

where she was when she saw Nellâs hand beckoning
to her from an open stateroom window. Jessie
got up and moved toward the place, wondering
what the doctorâs daughter had discovered that so
excited her.

âWhat is it, Nell?â Jess whispered.

âCome down hereâdo!â exclaimed the other
girl, her tone half muffled.

âWhat is the matter?â Jessie exclaimed, in
wonder.

But she slipped around to the other side of the
cabin, faced the gale, and reached the companionway.
She darted down, being careful to shut tight
the slide behind her. Already the waves were
buffeting the small yacht and spray was dashing
in over the weather rail.

Jessie found some difficulty in keeping her feet
in the close cabin. It was so dark outside that the
interior of the yacht was gloomy. She groped her
way to their stateroom, which was the biggest
aboard.

âWhat is the matter, Nell?â demanded Jessie,
pushing open the door and peering in.

Nell Stanleyâs face was white. She stood by
the open window. At Jessieâs appearance she began
to sob and tremble.

âIâIâm so frightened, Jess!â she gasped.

âWhy, you silly! I thought you said you were
a good sailor?â

160

âIt isnât that,â Nell told her. âDonâtâdonât
you smell it?â

âDonât I smell what?â

âCome in and shut the door. Now smellâsmell

hard
!â

Jessie began to giggle. âWhat do you mean?
Why! I see a little haze of smoke by the window.
Do I, or donât I?â

âI opened the window to let it out. Butâbut
it comes more and more, Jessie,â stammered the
clergymanâs daughter. âI believe the yacht is on
fire, Jessie!â

âOh! Donât say that!â murmured Jessie Norwood,
suddenly frightened herself.

âWhen I came in the room was full of smoke
andâdonât you smell it?â

âIt doesnât smell very nice,â admitted her
friend. âWhere does the smoke come from?
Where
can
it come from?â

âIt must come from belowâfrom the hold
under us.â

âBut what can be burning? This is not a cargo
boat,â said the puzzled Jessie. âWe donât want
to frighten them all, especially if it amounts to
nothing.â

âI know. That is why I called you first,â Nell
declared, anxiously. âIâI wasnât sure.â

âWell, I am sure of one thing,â said Jessie
confidently.

161

âWhat is that?â

âThis is a very serious thing if it is serious.
We must tell Skipper Pandrick at once. Let him
decide what is to be done.â

âYou wouldnât tell Darry?â

âThe skipper is responsible. We wonât frighten
the boys if we donât need to,â and Jessie tried to
open the door again. âCome on. Donât stay here
and get asphyxiated.â

âIt is all right with the window open,â said
Nell.

She turned to follow her chum and saw Jessie
tugging at the door-knob and stopped, amazed.
The other girl used both hands, but could not turn
the knob. She tugged with all her strength.

âWhy, Jessie Norwood! what is the matter with
it?â whispered Nell, anxiously.

âThe mean old thing wonât open! Itâs a spring
lock. How did it get locked this way, do you suppose?â

âYou slammed it when you came in, Jess,â Nell
said. âBut I had no idea that it could be locked
that way. Especially from the outside. Oh, dear!
Shall I shout for one of the boys? Shall I?â

âDonât!â gasped Jessie, still struggling with the
door-knob. âDonât you know if one of them
comes here and sees this smoke, everybody will
know it?â

âTheyâll have to know it pretty soon,â said

162

Nell. âThe smoke is coming in all the time, Jess.â

Jessie could see that well enough. She shrank
from creating a panic aboard the yacht, realizing
fully what a terrible thing a fire at sea can be. If
this hovering fog of smoke meant nothing serious,
their outcry for help at the stateroom window
would create troubleâmaybe serious trouble.
Jessie had the right idea, if she could but carry it
outâto tell the sailing master of the yacht, and
only him.

The brass knob seemed as firmly fixed in place
as though it had never been moved since it came
from the shop. Jessie, at last, came away from it.
She peered out of the small window. If she could
only catch the skipperâs eye!

But she could not. At that moment there was
not a soul in sight from the window. She saw sea
and sky, and that was all.

âOh dear, Jess!â murmured Nell Stanley, at
last giving way to fear. âWhat shall we do?
Weâll be burned up in here!â

âDonât talk so, Nell!â commanded Jessie. âDo
you want to scare me to death?â

âItâs enough to scare anybody to death,â proclaimed
the ministerâs daughter. âIâm going to
scream for father.â

âYouâll do nothing of the kind!â her friend
declared. âShrieking about this will do no good,
and may do harm. Canât you seeâââ

163

âNot much, with all this smoke in my eyes,â
grumbled Nell.

âDonât be a goose! If we yell, everybody will
come running, and will get excited when they see
the smoke.â

âBut, Jess,â Nell said very sensibly, âall the
time we delay the fire is gathering headway.â

âIf it
is
a fire.â

âGoodness me! Where thereâs so much smoke
there must be fire. How you talk!â

âI donât want to be shown up as a âfraid cat and
a killjoy,â cried Jessie. âThe boys are always
laughing at us, anyway, because we get scared at
little things: mice, and falling overboard, and a
puff of wind. I am deadly sick of hearing: âIsnât
that just like a girl?â So there!â

âWell, for pityâs sake!â gasped the clergymanâs
daughter. âThat is just like a girl! Afraid of
what boys will say of one! Not me!â

âGirls ought to be just as fearless as boys, and
have as much initiative. Now, Nell Stanley, suppose
Darry and Burd were shut up in this stateroom
under these circumstances. What do you
suppose they would do?â

Nell laughed aloud, serious as the situation was.
âI guess Burd would put his head out of that window
and bawl for help.â

âDarry wouldnât,â declared Jessie, firmly. âHe

164

would know what to do. He would realize that it
would not do to start a panic.â

âBut if the door has been locked on us?â

âDarry would know what to do with that old
lock. Heâdâheâd find a way. Find out what the
matter with it was.â

Jessie sprang at the door again. She stooped
down and looked at the under side of the brass
lock. Then she uttered a shrill squeal of delight.

âWhat is it now?â gasped Nell.

âIâve got it! There is a snap here that holds
the knob so you canât turn it! I must have snapped
it when I came in!â She jerked the door open and
ran. âCome on, Nell!â

âWell, of all things!â gasped her friend.

But she followed her friend out of the stateroom.
They ran as well as they could through
the cabin and got out upon the open deck. Skipper
Pandrick, in glistening oilskins and souâwester
was far aft with his glasses to his eyes. He was
watching a dark spot upon the stormy horizon
that might have been steamer smoke, or a gathering
storm cloud.

The girls ran up to him, but Jessie pulled Nellâs
sleeve to admonish her to say nothing that might
be overheard by the other passengers.

âWhatâs doing, young ladies?â asked the skipper,
curiously, seeing their flushed and excited
faces.

165

âWillâwill you come belowâto our stateroomâfor
a moment, Mr. Pandrick?â stammered
Jessie. âThere is something we want to show
you. It is really something serious. Please come
below at once.â

166
CHAPTER XXIâWORK FOR ALL

The skipper looked rather queerly at the
two excited girls, but he went below with
them without further objection. In fact,
Skipper Pandrick was a man of very few words;
he proved this when Nell opened the stateroom
door and he saw the smoke swirling about the
apartment.

âI reckon you girls ainât been smoking in here,â
he said grimly. âThen I reckon that smoke
comes from below.â

âIs the ship really on fire?â gasped Jessie.

âSomethingâs afire, sure as youâre a foot high,â
said the skipper vigorously, and stormed out of
the stateroom and out of the cabin.

There was a hatch in the main deck amidships.
He called two of the men and had it raised. The
passengers as yet had no idea that anything was
wrong, for Jessie and Nell kept away from them.

But they watched what the skipper did. He
had brought an electric pocket torch from below
and he flashed this before him as he descended
the iron ladder into the hold. Almost at once,

167

however, a whiff of smoke rose through the open
hatchway.

âGlory be, Tom!â said one sailor to his mate.
âWhat do you make of that?â

âYou canât make nothing of smoke,
but
smoke,â
returned the other man. âItâs just as useless as
a pigâs squeal is to the butcher.â

But Jessie believed that the incident called for
no humor. If there was a fire belowââ

âHi, you boys!â came the muffled voice of Skipper
Pandrick from below, âcouple on the pump-line
and send the nozzle end below. Thereâs
something here, sure enough.â

As he said this another balloon of smoke floated
up through the open hatch. It was seen from the
station of the passengers. Darry jumped up and
ran to the hatchway.

âWhatâs he doing? Smoking down there?â
he demanded.

âItâs sure a bad cigar, boss, if heâs smoking it,â
said one of the men, grinning.

âOh, Darry!â gasped Jessie. âThe yacht is
on fire!â

âNonsense!â exclaimed the young man, rather
impolitely it must be confessed.

He started to descend into the hold. The skipperâs
voice rose out of it:

âGet away from there! This ainât any place
for you, Mr. Darry. Hustle that pipe-line.â

168

âIs it serious, Skipper?â demanded the young
collegian, anxiously.

âI donât know how bad it is yet. Tell the helmsman
to head norâeast. Maybe weâd better make
for some anchorage, after all.â

Darry ran to the wheelhouse. The other passengers
began to get excited. Nell ran to her
father and told him what she had first discovered.

âWell, having discovered the fire in time, undoubtedly
they will be able to put it out,â said
Dr. Stanley, comfortingly.

But this did not prove to be easy. Skipper
Pandrick had to come up after a while for a breath
of cool air and to remove his oilskins. Darry and
Burd got into overalls and helped in handling the
hose. The steam needed to work the pump, however,
brought the engines down to a very slow
movement. The
Marigold
scarcely kept her headway.

The fire, which had undoubtedly been smouldering
a long time, was obstinate. The water the
skipper and his helpers poured upon it raised the
level of water in the bilge until Darry declared
he feared the yacht would be water-logged.

Meanwhile the wind grew in savageness. Instead
of being gusty, it blew more and more
violently out of the northeast. When the helmsman
tried to head into it, under the skipperâs relayed
instructions by Darry, the lack of steam

169

kept the old
Marigold
marking time instead of
forging ahead.

âIf we have to put the steam to the pump to
clear the bilge after this,â grumbled the pessimistic
Burd, âweâll never reach any shelter. Might
as well run for the Bermudas.â

âWonât that be fine!â cried Amy. âI have
always wanted to go to the Bermudas, and weâve
never gone.â

âFine girl, you,â retorted Burd. âYou donât
know when you are in danger.â

âFireâs out!â announced Amy. âThe skipper
says so. And I am not afraid of a capful of
wind.â

There was more danger, however, than the
girls imagined. The water that had been poured
into the yachtâs hold did not make her any more
seaworthy. It was necessary to start the pump
to try to clear the hold.

The clapperty-clap; clapperty-clap! of the
pump and the water swishing across the deck to be
vomited out of the hawse holes was nothing to
add to the passengersâ feelings of confidence. Besides,
the water came very clear, and at its appearance
the skipper looked doleful.

âWhatâs the matter, Skipper?â asked Darry,
seeing quickly that something was still troubling
the old man.

170

âWhy, Mr. Darry, that donât look good to me,
and thatâs a fact,â the sailing master said.

âWhy not? The pump is clearing her fast.â

âIs it?â grumbled Pandrick, shaking his head.

âOf course it is!â exclaimed Darry, with some
exasperation. âDonât be an Old Man of the
Sea.â

âThatâs exactly what I am, Mr. Darry,â said
the skipper. âIâm so old a hand at sea that Iâm
always looking for trouble. I confess it. And I
see troubleâand work for all handsâright here.â

âWhat do you mean?â asked Jessie, who
chanced to be by. âThe pump works all right just
as Darry says, doesnât it?â

âBut, by gorry!â ejaculated the skipper, âit
looks as though we were just pumping the whole
Atlantic through her seams.â

âGoodness! What do you mean?â Jessie demanded.

âYou think she is leaking?â asked Darry, in
some trouble.

âBilge ainât clean water like that,â answered
Pandrick. âThatâs as clear as the sea itself.
Mind you! I donât say she leaks moreân enough
to keep her sweet. But if those pumps donât suck
purtâ soon, I shall have my suspicions.â

âDarry!â ejaculated Jessie, âyour yacht is falling
apart. What are we going to do?â

âI donât believe it,â muttered Darry.

171

He had, however, to admit it after a time. It
seemed as though the
Marigold
were suffering
one misfortune after another. The fire, which
might have been very serious, was extinguished;
but the yacht lay deep in the troubled sea, rolling
heavily, and the water pumped through the pipe
was plainly seeping in through the seams of her
hull.

âGoodness me! shall we have to take to the
boat and the life raft?â demanded Amy.

It was scarcely possible to joke much about the
situation. Even Amy Drewâs âfamous line of
light conversationâ could not keep up their spirits.

The wind continued to blow harder and harder.
The yacht could no longer head into it. Dr. Stanley
looked grave. Nell, first frightened by her
discovery of the fire in the hold, was now in tears.

To add to the seriousness of the situation, there
was not another vessel in sight.

172
CHAPTER XXIIâA RADIO CALL THAT FAILED

âOf course,â Amy said composedly, âif
worse comes to worst, we can send the
news by radio that the yacht is sinking
and bring to our rescue somebodyâsomebodyâââ

âYes, we can!â exclaimed Burd Alling. âA
revenue cutter, I suppose? Donât you suppose
the United States Government has anything better
to do than to look out for people who donât
know enough to look out for themselves?â

âThat seems to be the Governmentâs mission
a good deal of the time,â replied Dr. Stanley,
with a smile. âBut you donât think it will be
necessary to call for help, do you, Darrington?â
he asked the sober-looking owner of the yacht.

âWell, the fireâs out, thatâs sureâââ

âYou bet it is!â growled Burd. âIt had to be
out, thereâs so much water in the hold.â

âBut we are not sinking!â cried Amy.

âLucky weâre not,â said Burd. âThe radio
doesnât work.â

âWhy, how you talk,â Nell said admonishingly.

173

âYou would scare us if we did not know you so
well, Burd.â

âYou donât know the half of it!â exclaimed
the young fellow. âFuel is getting low, too.
Skipper wants us to work the pump by hand. That
means Darry and me to âman the pumps.ââ

âAnd we can help,â said Jessie, cheerfully. âIf
the skipper thinks he needs to make more steam
for the engines, why canât we all take turns at
the pump?â

âSounds like a real shipwreck story,â her chum
observed, but doubtfully.

âIt will cause a mutiny,â declared Burd. âI
didnât ship on the
Marigold
to work like Old
Bowser on the treadmill. And that is about how
I feel.â

âYou can get out and walk if you donât like it,â
Darry reminded him.

âAnd I suppose you think I wouldnât. For two
centsâââ

Just then the yacht pitched sharply and Burd
almost lost his footing. The waves were really
boisterous and occasionally a squall of rain
swooped down and, with the spray, wet the entire
deck and those upon it.

Jessie was not greatly afraid of the elements
or of what they could do to the yacht. But she
was made anxious by the repetition of the statement
that the radio was out of order. Originally

174

the
Marigold
had had a small wireless plant, with
storage batteries. Signals by Morse could be exchanged
with other ships and with stations ashore
within a limited distance.

But when Darry had bought the radio receiving
set he had disconnected the broadcasting machine
and linked up the regenerative circuit with the
stationary batteries. As he had explained to Jessie,
both systems could not be used at once.

They had found that neither the receiving set
nor the old wireless set worked well. It looked
as though the boys had overlooked something in
rigging the new set and the radio girls quite
realized that in this emergency a general and perhaps
a thorough overhauling of the wires and
connections would be necessary to discover just
where the fault lay.

Jessie called Amy, and they went up into the
little wireless room behind the wheelhouse where
everything about the plant but the batteries were
in place. This was a very different outfit from
that in the great station at the old lighthouse on
Station Island, which they had visited several
days before.

âIf we only knew as much as that operator does
about wireless,â sighed Jessie to her chum, âthere
might be some hope of our untangling all this and
finding out the trouble.â

âHe said he had been five years at it and didnât

175

know so very much,â Amy reminded her dryly.

âOh, there will always be something new to
learn about radio, of course,â her chum agreed.
âBut if we had his training in the fundamentals
of radio, we would be equipped to handle such a
mess as this. To tell you the truth, Amy, I think
these two boys have made a catâs cradle of this
thing.â

âAnd Darry spent more than a year aboard a
destroyer and was trained to âlisten inâ for submarines
and all that!â

âAn entirely different thing from knowing how
to rig wireless,â commented Jessie, getting down
on her knees to look under the shelf to which the
posts were screwed. âOh, dear!â she added, as
she bumped her head. âI wish this boat wouldnât
pitch so.â

âSo say we all of us. What can I do, Jess?â

âNot a thingâfor a moment. Let me see:
The general rules of radio are easily remembered.
The incoming oscillations that have been intercepted
by the antenna above the roof of the house
are applied across the grid and filament of the
detector tubeâââ

âThatâs this jigger here,â put in Amy, as Jessie
struggled up again.

âYes. That is the tube. Through the relay
action of the tube, an amplified current flows
through the plate circuitâ
here
. Now,â added

176

Jessie thoughtfully, âif we couple this plate circuit
backâNo! This is a simple circuit. It is like
our old one, Amy. We canât get much action out
of this set. It is not like the new one we are
putting in the bungalow.â

âWell, the thing is, can we use it?â Amy demanded.
âCan you link the power, or whatever
you call it, up with the sending paraphernalia and
get an S O S over the water?â

âGoodness, Amy! Donât talk as though you
thought we were really in danger.â

âHumph! I see the Reverend, as Nell calls him,
out there with his coat off, in his shirt-sleeves,
taking a turn with Burd at the pumps. They
have rigged it for man power and are saving
steam for the engines.â

âLet me see!â cried Jessie, peering out of the
clouded window too. âYouâd never think he was
a minister. Isnât he nice?â

Amy began to laugh. âAre all ministers supposed
to be such terrible people?â

âNo-o,â admitted Jessie, going back to the
radio set. âBut good as they usually are, we
have the very best minister at the Roselawn
Church, of any.â

âYep. So we must plan to save him if anything
happens,â giggled Amy.

âLetâs open the switch and see if we can get

177

anything,â her chum said reflectively, picking up
the head harness.

âYou mean
hear
if we can get anything,â corrected
Amy.

âNever mind splitting hairs, my dear. Is that
the switch? Yes. Now!â

She put on the rigging, but all she got out of
the air, as she sadly confessed, were sounds like
an angry cat spitting at a puppydog.

âIt isnât just static,â she told Amy. âYou try
it. There is something absolutely wrong with
this thing. See! We donât get a spark.â

âIf we did we couldnât read the letters.â

âI believe I could read some Morse if it came
slowly enough,â said Jessie, nodding. âBut it is
sending, not receiving, I am thinking of, Amy
Drew.â

Amy began to look more serious. Jessie was
harping on a possibility she did not wish to admit
was probable. She went out and, hunting up
Darry, demanded to know just how bad he thought
they were off, anyway.

âWell, Sis, there is no use making a wry face
about it,â the collegian said. âBut you see how
hard the Reverend and Burd are working, and
they canât keep ahead of the water. The poor old

Marigold
really is leaking.â

âIs she going to sink? Canât we get to landâsomewhere?
Canât we go back to the island?â

178

âShucks, Sis! You know we are miles from
Station Island. We are off Montaukâor we were
this morning. But we are heading out to sea nowâsouâ-souâeast.
Canât head into this gale. She
pitches too much.â

âAndâand isnât there any help for us, Darry
Drew?â

âWe donât need any help yet, do we?â he demanded
pluckily. âShe is making good weather
of itâââ

Just then the yacht rolled so that he had to
grab the rail with one hand and Amy with the
other, and both of them were well shaken up.

âWoof!â gasped Darry, as they came out of
the smother of spray.

âOh!â exploded Amy. âI swallowed a pail of
water that time. Ugh! How bitter the sea is.
Now, Darry, I guess weâll have to send out signals,
shaânât we?â

âHow can we? Iâve tried the old radio already.
She is as dumb as the proverbial oyster
with the lockjaw.â

âJessie is going to fix it,â said Amy, with some
confidence.

âYes she is! Sheâs some smart girl, I admit,â
her brother observed. âBut I guess that is a job
that will take an expert.â

âYou just see!â cried Amy. âYou think she
canât do anything because sheâs a girl.â

179

âBless you! Girls equal the men nowadays.
I hold Jessie as little less than a wonder. But if
a thing canât be doneâââ

âThat is what you think because you tried it
and failed.â

âHuh!â

âWe radio girls will show you!â declared Amy,
her head up and preparing to march back to her
chum the next time the deck became steady.

But when she started so proudly the yacht
rolled unexpectedly and Amy, screaming for help,
went sliding along the deck to where Dr. Stanley
and Burd were pumping away to clear the bilge.
She was saturatedâand much meeker in deportmentâwhen
Burd fished her out of the scuppers.

180
CHAPTER XXIIIâONLY HOPE

The condition of the
Marigold
was actually
much more serious than the Roselawn girls
at first supposed. Jessie and Amy were
so busy in the radio house for a couple of hours
and were so interested in what they were doing
that they failed to observe that the hull of the
yacht was slowly sinking.

Fortunately the wind decreased after a while;
but by that time it was scarcely safe to head the
yacht into the windâs eye, as the skipper called it.
She wallowed in the big seas in a most unpleasant
way and it was fortunate indeed that all the passengers
were good sailors.

Nell came and looked into the radio room once
or twice; then she felt so bad that she went below
to lie down. The doctor worked as hard as any
man aboard. And his cheerfulness was always
infectious.

The minister knew that they were in peril. He
would have been glad to see a rescuing vessel
heave into sight. But he gave no sign that he considered
the situation at all uncertain or perilous in
the least.

181

The afternoon was passing. Another night on
the open sea without knowing if the yacht would
weather the conditions, was a matter for grave
consideration. The doctor and Darry conferred
with Skipper Pandrick.

ââTis hard to say,â the sailing master observed.
âThere is no knowing what may happen. If the
yacht was not so water-logged we might get in
under our own steamâââ

âBut we canât make steam enough!â cried
Darry.

âWell, no, we donât seem to,â admitted the
skipper.

âAnd to what port would you sail?â asked Dr.
Stanley.

âWell, now, thereâs not any handy just now,
I admit. If we head back for the land we may be
thrown on our beam-ends, I will say. The waves
are big ones, as you see.â

âYou are not very encouraging, Skipper,â said
the minister.

âI wouldnât be raising any false hopes in your
mind, sir,â said Pandrick.

âYouâre a jolly old wet blanket, you are,â declared
Darry to the sailing master. âWhat shall
we do?â

âWeâll have to take what comes to us,â declared
the skipper.

âYou are a fatalist, Mr. Pandrick,â said the

182

minister, and Darry was glad to hear him laugh
cheerily.

âNo, sir. Iâm a Universalist,â declared the
seaman. âAnd Iâve all the hope in the world that
weâll come out of this all right.â

âBut canât we do something to help ourselves?â
demanded the exasperated Darry.

âNot much that I know of. Hereâs hoping the
wind goes down and we have calm weather and
see the sun again.â

âHope all you like,â growled the young fellow.
âI am going to see if the girls arenât able to bring
something to pass with that radio.â

He found his sister and Jessie rearranging a
part of the circuit on the set-board. They were
very much in earnest. Thus far, however, they
had been unable to get a clear signal out of the
air, nor could they send one.

âIf we could reach another vessel, or a shore
station, and tell them where the yacht is and that
she is leaking, weâd be all right, shouldnât we,
Darry?â Jessie asked earnestly.

âBut I am not at all sure we need help,â he
said, in doubt.

âWe may need it!â exclaimed his sister.

âWhyâyes, we may,â he admitted, though
rather grudgingly.

âThen we want to get this fixed,â Jessie declared.
âBut there is something wrong here. Do

183

you see this Darry? It seems to me that there
must be a part missing. When you and Burd set
this up are you sure you followed the instructions
of the book in every particular?â

âOf course we did,â Darry said.

âOf course we didnât!â exclaimed Burdâs voice
from the doorway.

âWhat are you saying?â demanded his friend,
promptly.

âWhat I know. Donât you remember that you
lost the instruction book overboard sometime
there, when we were getting the bothersome thing
fixed?â

âSo I did,â confessed Darry. âBut, say! she
was all right then.â

âShe hasnât ever been all right,â accused his
chum, âand you know it.â

âWe sent code signals by the old machine, all
right.â

âBut weâve never been able to since we linked
it up with this receiving set, and you know it,â
said Burd.

âIt sounds to me,â said Amy, âas though
neither one of you boys knew so awfully much
about it.â

âI know one thing,â said Jessie, with determination.
âAll the parts are not here. These connections
are not like any I ever saw before. It
is a mystery to meâââ

184

âHold on!â exclaimed Darry Drew suddenly.
âWhat did we do with all those little cardboard
boxes and paper tubes the parts came in? Couldnât
be we overlooked anything, Burd?â

âDonât try to hang it on me!â exclaimed his
chum. âI never claimed to know a thing about
radio. You were the Big Noise when we put the
contraption together.â

âAw, you! Where did we put the things left
over?â

âThere he goes!â exclaimed the confirmed
joker. âHeâs like the fellow who took the automobile
apart to fix it and had a bushel of parts
left over when he was done. He doesnât
knowâââ

âBeat it out of here,â roared Darry, âand find
that box we put the stuff into.
You
know.â

Dr. Stanley came up to the radio room while
Burd was searching for the rubbish box. The
clergyman spoke cheerfully, but he looked very
grave.

âIs there any likelihood of our being able to
send out a call for assistance, Jessie?â he asked,
quietly.

âI donât see how we can, Doctor Stanley, until
we fix this radio set. We canât get any spark.
We have to be able to get a spark to send a
message. The message will be stumbling enough,
I am afraid, even if we fix the thing, for none of us

185

understands Morse very well. Unless Darryâââ

âDonât look to me for help,â declared the collegian.
âI havenât sent a message since we put
the yacht in commission. We had a fellow aboard
here until the other day who knew something
about wireless and he was the operator. Not
me.â

âAmy and I have a code book with the alphabet
in it,â said Jessie slowly. âI think if somebody
read the dots and dashes to me I could send a
short message. But there is something wrong
with this circuit.â

Just then Burd Alling came back. He brought
with him a big corrugated cardboard container.
In that the various parts of the radio outfit had
been packed.

âWhat do you think about it?â he asked.
âThere
is
something here that I never saw before.
See this jigamarig, Jess? Think it belongs on
the contraption?â

âOh!â cried Jessie, eagerly, pouncing on the
small object that Burd held out to her. âI know
what that is.â

âThen you beat me. I donât,â declared Burd.

âLetâs see what else there is,â said Darry, diving
into the box. âI left you to get out the parts,
Burd; you know I did.â

âOh, splash!â exclaimed his friend. âWe
might as well admit that we donât know as much

186

about radio as these girls. They leave us lashed
to the post.â

But Jessie and Amy did not even feel what at
another time Amy would have called âaugmented
ego.â The occasion was too serious.

The day was passing into evening, and a very
solemn evening it was. The wind whined through
the strands of the wire rigging. The waves
knocked the yacht about. The passengers all felt
weary and forlorn.

The two girl chums felt the situation less acutely
than anybody else, perhaps, because they were so
busy. That radio had to be repaired. That is
what Jessie told Amy, and Amy agreed. The
safety of the whole yachtâs company seemed dependent
upon what the two radio girls could do.

âAnd we must not fall down on it, Jess,â Amy
said vigorously. âHow goes it now?â

âThis thing that Burd found goes right in here.
We have got to reset a good part of the circuit to
do it. I donât see how the boys could have made
such a mistake.â

âProves what I have always maintained,â declared
Amy Drew. âWe girls are smarter than
those boys, even if the said boys do go to college.
Bah! What is college, anyway?â

âJust a prison,â said Burd sepulchrally from
the doorway.

187

âClose that door!â exclaimed Jessie. âDonât
let that spray drift in here.â

âYes. Do go away, Burd, and see if the yacht
is sinking any more. Donât bother us,â commanded
Amy.

The men were keeping the pumps at work, but
it was an anxious time. It was long dark and the
lamps were lighted when Jessie pronounced the
set complete. Darry and Burd came in again
and asked what they could do?

âRoot for us. Nothing more,â said Amy.
âJessie has fixed this thing and she is going to have
the honor of sending the messageâif a message
can be sent.â

âWell,â remarked Burd Alling, âI guess it is
up to you girls to save the situation. I have just
found out that there isnât as much provender as
I was given reason to believe when we started.
We ought to be in Boston right now. And see
where we are!â

âThat is exactly what we canât see,â said Jessie.
âBut we must know. Did you get the latitude and
longitude from the skipper, Darry?â

âYes. Here it is, approximately. He got a
chance to shoot the sun this noon.â

âThe cruel thing!â gibed his sister. âBut anyway,
I hope he has got the situation near enough
so some vessel can find us.â

âLet us see, first, if we can send a message

188

intelligibly,â said Jessie, putting on the head harness,
and speaking seriously. âIt will be awful,
perhaps, if we canât. I know that the yacht is
almost unmanageable.â

âYouâve said something,â returned Burd. âThe
fuel is low, as well as the supplies in the galley.
We havenât got much leftâââ

âBut hope,â said Jessie, softly.

189
CHAPTER XXIVâTHE MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE

Henrietta Haney was a very lonely
little girl after the yacht sailed from
Station Island. Not that she had nobody
to play with, for she had. There were other
children besides Sally Stanley of her own age,
or thereabout, in the bungalow colony. And as
she had been in Dogtown, Henrietta soon became
the leading spirit of her crowd.

She even taught them some of her games, and
once more became âSpotted Snake, the Witch,â
and scared some of the children almost as much
as she had scared the Dogtown youngsters with
her supposed occult powers.

She was running and screaming and tearing her
clothes most of the time when she was away from
Mrs. Norwood, but in the company of Jessieâs
mother she truly tried to âbe a little lady.â

âBe it ever so painful, little Hen is going to
learn to be worthy of you and Jessie, Mary,â
laughed Mrs. Drew, who was like her daughter
in being able always to see the fun in things.
âWhat do you really expect will come of the
child?â

190

âI think she will make quite a woman in time.
And before that time arrives,â added Mrs. Norwood,
âshe has much to learn, as you say. In
some ways Henrietta has had an unhappy childhoodâalthough
she doesnât know it. I hope she
will have better times from now on.â

âYou are sure to make her have good times,
Mary,â said Mrs. Drew. âI hope she will appreciate
all that Jessie and you do for her.â

âShe is rather young for one to expect appreciation
from her,â Mrs. Norwood said, smiling.
âBut the little thing is grateful.â

Without Jessie and Amy, however, Henrietta
confessed she was very lonely. Sometimes she
listened to the radio all alone, sitting quietly and
hearing even lectures and business talks out of the
air that ordinarily could not have interested the
child. But she said it reminded her of âMiss
Jessieâ just to sit with the ear-tabs on.

She had heard about the older girls going to
the lighthouse station to interview the wireless
operator there, and although Henrietta knew
that the government reservation at that end of
the island was no part of the old Padriac Haney
estate, she wandered down there alone on the
second day of the yachtâs absence and climbed up
into the tower.

The storm had blown itself out on shore, and
the sun was going down in golden glory. Out at

191

sea, although the waves still rolled high and the
clouds were tumultuous in appearance, there was
nothing to threaten a continuation of the unsettled
weather.

Henrietta had no idea how long it would be
before the yacht reached Boston, although she had
heard a good deal of talk about it. She had
watched the
Marigold
steam out of sight into the
east, and it seemed to the little girl that her friends
were just there, beyond the horizon line, where she
had seen the last patch of the
Marigoldâs
smoke
disappear.

The wireless operator had seen Henrietta before,
cavorting about the beach and leading the
other children in their play, and he was prepared
for some of her oddities. But she surprised him
by her very first speech.

âYouâre the man that can send words out over
the ocean, arenât you?â

âI can send signals,â he admitted, but rather
puzzled.

âCan folks like Miss Jessie and Miss Amy hear
âem?â demanded Henrietta.

âOnly if they are on a boat that has a wireless
outfit.â

âThey got it on that
Marigold
,â announced
Henrietta.

âOh! The yacht that sailed yesterday! Yes,
she carried antenna.â

192

âAnd she carried Doctor Stanley and Miss Nell
Stanley, too, besides the boys, Mr. Darry and
Mr. Burd,â said Henrietta. âThen they can hear
you?â

âIf they know how to use the wireless they
could catch a signal from this station.â

âMiss Jessie knows all about radio,â said Henrietta.
âShe made it.â

âOh, she did?â

âYes. She made it all up. She and Miss Amy
built them one at Roselawn. That was before
Montmorency Shannon built his. Well, Miss Jessie
is out there on the
Marigold
.â

âSo I understand,â said the much amused operator.

âI wish you wouldâpleaseâsend her word
that Iâd like to have her come back to my island.â

âAre you the little girl who owns this island?
Iâve heard about you.â

âYes. But there ainât much fun on an island
if your friends arenât on it, too. And Miss Jessie
is one of my very dearest friends.â

âI understand,â said the operator gravely, seeing
the little girlâs lip trembling. âYou would
like to have me reach your friend, Miss Jessieâââ

âHer nameâs Norwood, too,â put in Henrietta,
to make sure.

193

âOh, indeed? She is the lawyer, Mr. Norwoodâs
daughter. I have met her.â

âYes, sir. She came here once.â

âAnd you wish to send her a message if it is
possible?â

âYes, sir. I want you should ask her to get
to Boston as quick as she can and come back
again. We would all like to have her come,â said
the little girl, gravely.

âI am going to be on duty myself this evening
and I will try to get your message through,â said
the operator kindly. âThe
Marigold
, is it?â and
he drew the code book toward him in which the
signal for every vessel sailing from American
ports, even pleasure craft, that carries wireless,
is listed.

He turned around to his instrument right then
and began to rap out the call for the yacht. He
kept it up, off and on, between his other work, all
the evening. But no answer was returned.

The operator began to be somewhat puzzled by
this fact. Knowing how much interested in radio
the girls were who had visited him, he could not
understand why they would not be listening in
at some time or other on the yacht.

He kept throwing into the ether the signal
meant for the
Marigoldâs
call until almost midnight,
when he expected to be relieved by his partner.
Towards ten oâclock there was some bothersome

194

signals in the ether that annoyed him whenever
he took a message or relayed one in the course
of the eveningâs business.

âSome amateur op. is interfering,â was his expression.
âBut, I declare! it does sound something
like this station call. Can it beââ?â

He lengthened his spark and sent thundering
out on the air-waves his usual reply:
âI, I, OKW. I, I, OKW.â

Then he held his hand and waited for any return.
The same mysterious, scraping sounds continued.
A slow hand, he believed, was trying to
spell out some message in Morse. But it was
being done in a very fumbling manner.

Of course, half a dozen shore stations and perhaps
half a hundred vessels might have caught the
clumsy message, as well. But the operator at
Station Island, interested by little Henrietta in
the
Marigold
and her company, felt more than
puzzlement over this strange communication out
of the air.

âListen in here, Sammy,â he said to his mate,
when the latter came in. âIs it just somebodyâs
squeak-box making trouble to-night or am I hearing
a sure-enough S O S? I wonder if there is a
storm at sea?â

âThere is,â said his mate, sitting down on the
bench and taking up the secondary head harness.

195

âThe evening papers are full of it. Northeast
gale, and blowing like kildee right now.â

âArlington gave no particulars at last announcement.â

âDonât make any difference. The boats outside
know it. Hullo! Whatâs this? âS-t-a-t-i-o-n
I-s-l-a-n-d.â Whatâs the joke? Somebody calling
us without using the code letters?â

âDonât know âem, maybe,â said the chief operator.
âSet down what you get and see if it is like
mine.â

The other did so. They compared notes. That
strange message set both operators actively to
work. One began swiftly to distribute over the
Eastern Atlantic the news that a craft needed help
in such and such a latitude and longitude. The
other operator, without his hat, ran all the way to
the bungalows to give Mr. Norwood and Mr.
Drew some very serious news.

196
CHAPTER XXVâSAVED BY RADIO

Jessie Norwood was not tireless. It
seemed to her as though her right arm would
drop off, she pressed the key of the wireless
instrument so frequently. They had written out
a brief call of distress, and finally she got it by
heart so that Amy did not have to read her the
dots and dashes.

But it was a slow process and they had no way
of learning if the message was caught and understood
by any operator, either ashore or on board
a vessel. Hour after hour went slowly by. The

Marigold
was sinking. The pumps could not
keep up with the incoming water; the fuel was
almost exhausted and the engines scarcely turned
over; the buffeting seas threatened the craft every
minute.

Dr. Stanley remained outwardly cheerful.
Darry and the others took heart from the clergymanâs
words.

âTell you what,â said Burd. âIf we are wrecked
on a desert island I shall be glad to have the doctor
along. Heâd have cheered up old Robinson
Crusoe.â

197

As the evening waned and the sea continued to
pound the hull of the laboring yacht the older
people aboard, at least, grew more anxious. The
young folks in the radio room chattered briskly,
although Jessie called them to account once in a
while because they made so much noise she could
not be sure that she was sending correctly.

Darry tried to relieve her at the key, but he
confessed that he âmade a mess of it.â The radio
girls had spent more time and effort in learning
to handle the wireless than the collegiansâboth
Darry and Burd acknowledged it.

âThese are some girls!â Darry said, admiringly.

âYou spoil âem,â complained Burd Ailing.
âWant to be careful what you say to them.â

âOh, if anybody can stand a little praise it is
Jess and I,â declared Amy, sighing with weariness.

Nobody cared to turn in. The situation was
too uncertain. The boys could be with the girls
only occasionally, for they had to take their turn
at the pumps. It had come to pass that nothing
but steady pumping kept the yacht from sinking.
They were all thankful that the wind decreased
and the waves grew less boisterous.

Towards midnight it was quite calm, only the
swells lifted the water-logged yacht in a rhythmic
motion that finally became unpleasant. Nell was

198

ill, below; but the others remained on deck and
managed to weather the nauseating effects of the
heaving sea.

Meanwhile, as often as she could, Jessie Norwood
sent out into the air the cry for assistance.
She sent it addressed to âStation Island,â for she
did not know that each wireless station had a code
signalâa combination of letters. But she knew
there was but one Station Island off the coast.

The clapperty-clap, clapperty-clap of the pumps
rasped their nerves at last until, as Amy declared,
they needed to scream! When the sound stopped
for the minute while pump-crews were changed,
it was a relief.

And finally the spark of the wireless began to
skip and fall dead. Good reason! The storage
batteries, although very good ones, were beginning
to fail. Before daybreak it was impossible to use
the sender any more.

Somehow this fact was more depressing than
anything that had previously happened. They
could only hope, in any event, that their message
had been heard and understood; but now even
this sad attempt was halted.

Jessie was really too tired to sleep. She and
Amy did not go below for long. They changed
their clothes and came on deck again and were
very glad of the hot cup of coffee Dr. Stanley
brought them from the galley. The cook had

199

been set to work on one of the pump crews.

The girls sat in the deck chairs and stared off
across the rolling gray waters. There was no
sign of any other vessel just then, but a dim rose
color at the sea line showed where the sun would
come up after a time.

âBut a fog is blowing up from the south, too,â
said Amy. âSee that cloud, Jess? My dear!
Did you ever expect that we would be sitting here
on Darryâs yacht waiting for it to sink under us?â

âHow can you!â exclaimed Jessie, aghast.

âWell, that is practically what we are doing,â
replied her chum. âThank goodness I have had
this cup of coffee, anyway. It braces meâââ

âEven for drowning?â asked Jessie. âOh!
What is that, Amy?â

âItâs a boat! Itâs a boat! Ship ahoy!â
shrieked Amy, jumping up and dancing about,
dropping the cup and saucer to smash upon the
deck.

âItâs a steamboat!â cried Darry Drew, from
the deck above.

âHead for it if you can, Bob!â commanded
Skipper Pandrick to the helmsman.

But before they could see what kind of craft
the other was, the fog surrounded them. It
wrapped the
Marigold
around in a thick mantle.
They could not see ten yards from her rail.

âWe donât even know if she is looking for us!â

200

exclaimed Dr. Stanley. âThat is too badâtoo
bad.â

âWhistle for it,â urged Amy. âCanât we?â

âIf we use the little steam left for the whistle,
we will have to shut down the engines,â declared
Darry.

âThis is a fine yachtâI donât think!â scoffed
Burd Alling. âAnd none of you knows a thing
about rescuing this boat and crew but me. Watch
me save the yacht.â

He marched forward and began to work the
foot-power foghorn vigorously. Its mournful
note (not unlike a cowâs lowing, as Jessie had
said) reverberated through the fog. The sound
must have carried miles upon miles.

But it was nearly an hour before they heard any
reply. Then the hoarse, brief blast of a tug
whistle came to their ears.

â
Marigold
, ahoy!â shouted a well-known voice
across the heaving sea.

âDaddy!â screamed Jessie, springing up and
dropping
her
cup and saucer, likewise to utter
ruin. âItâs Daddy Norwood!â

The big tug wallowed nearer. She carried
wireless, too, and the
Marigoldâs
company believed,
at once, that Jessieâs message had been
received aboard the
Pocahontas
.

âButâthenâhow did Daddy Norwood come
aboard of her?â Jessie demanded.

201

This was not explained until later when the
six passengers were taken aboard the tug and
hawsers were passed from the sinking yacht to
the very efficient
Pocahontas
.

âAnd a pretty penny it will cost, so the skipper
says, to get her towed to port,â Darry complained.

âSay!â ejaculated Burd, âsuppose she didnât
find us at all and we were paddling around in that
boat and on the life raft?
That
would take the
permanent wave out of your hair, old grouch!â

The girls, however, and Dr. Stanley as well,
begged Mr. Norwood to explain how he had come
in search of the
Marigold
and had arrived so opportunely.

âNothing easier,â said the lawyer. âWhen the
operator at the lighthouse station got your
messageâââ

âOh, bully, Jess! You did it!â cried Amy,
breaking in.

âDid you send that message, Jessie?â asked
her father. âWell, I am proud of you. The
operator came to the house and told me. Although
his partner was sending the news of your
predicament broadcast over the sea, he told me of
the tug lying behind the island, and that it could be
chartered.

âSo,â explained Mr. Norwood, âI left Drew to
fortify the womenâand little Henriettaâand
went right over and was rowed out to the

202

Pocahontas
by an old fisherman who said he knew you
girls. I believe he pronounced you âcleaners,â if
you know what that means,â laughed the lawyer.

âHenrietta, by the way, was doing incantations
of some sort over the wind and weather when I
left the bungalow. She said âSpotted Snakeâ could
bring you all safe home.â

âBless her heart!â exclaimed Jessie.

That afternoon when the tug worked her way
carefully into the dock near the bungalow colony
on Station Island, Henrietta was the first person
the returned wanderers saw on the shore to greet
them. She was dancing up and down and screaming
something that Jessie and Amy did not catch
until they came off the gangplank. Then they
made the incantation out to be:

âThat Ringold one canât have my islandâso
now! The court says so, and Mr. Drew says so,
too. He just got it off the telephone and he told
me. Itâs my islandâso there!â

âWhy, how glad I am for you, dear!â cried
Jessie, running to hug the excited little girl.

âCome ashore! Come ashore! All of you!â
cried Henrietta, with a wide gesture. âI invite
all of you. This is my island, not that Ringoldâs.
You can come on it and do anything you like!â

âWhy, Henrietta!â murmured Jessie, as the
other listeners broke into laughter. âYou must
not talk like that. I am glad the courts have given

203

you your fatherâs property. But remember, there
are other people who have rights, too.â

âSay! That Ringold oneâand that Moon oneâhavenât
any propâty on this island, have they?â
Henrietta demanded.

âNo.â

âThen thatâs all right,â said the little girl with
satisfaction. âIâll be good, Miss Jessie; oh, Iâll
be good!â and she hugged her friend again.

âAnd donât call them âthat Ringold oneâ and
âthat Moon one,â Henrietta. That is not pretty
nor polite,â admonished Jessie.

âAll right, if you say so, Miss Jessie. What
you say goes with me. See?â

It took some time, after they were at home, for
everything to be talked over and all the mystery
of the radio message to be cleared up. The interested
operator from the lighthouse came over to
congratulate Jessie on what she had done. After
all, aside from the girlâs addressing the station by
name, the message had not been hard to understand.
And considering the faulty construction of
the yachtâs wireless and the weakness of her batteries,
Jessie had done very well indeed.

The young people, of course, would have much
to talk about regarding the adventure for days to
come. Especially Darry. When he learned what
he would have to pay for the towing in of the yacht
and what it would cost to put in proper engines

204

and calk and paint the hull, he was aghast and
began to figure industriously.

âLearning something, arenât you, Son?â chuckled
Mr. Drew. âYour Uncle Will pretty near
went broke keeping up the
Marigold
. But I will
help you, for I am getting rather fond of the old
craft, too.â

âWe all ought to help,â said Mr. Norwood.
âI shaânât want you to scrap the boat, Darry, my
boy. I like to think that it was my Jessie saved
her from sinkingâand saved you all. To my
mind radio is a great thingâsomething more than
a toy even for these boys and girls.â

âQuite true,â Mr. Drew agreed. âWhen your
Jessie and my Amy first strung those wires at
Roselawn I thought they were well over it if they
didnât break their limbs before they got it finished.
When we get back home I think Darry and I would
better put up aerials and have a house-set, too.
What say, Darry?â

âIâm with you, Father,â agreed the young collegian.
âBut I wonât agree to rival Jess and Amy
as radio experts. For those two girls take the
palm.â

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

(Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

From the cover

Voices from the Past:

In
Voices from the Past
, a daring group of five
independent novels, acclaimed author Paul Alexander Bartlett accomplishes a
tour
de force
of historical fiction, allowing the reader to enter for the first
time into the private worlds of five remarkable people: Sappho of Lesbos, the
famous Greek poet; Jesus; Leonardo da Vinci; Shakespeare; and Abraham Lincoln.
Each novel appears here in its entirety within a single unique volume of 644
pages beautifully illustrated by the author-artist.

Bartlettâs writing has
been praised by many leading authors, reviewers, and critics, among them:

V

oices from the Past
is a
quintet of novels that deÂ­scribe the inner lives of five extraordinary people.
Progressing through time from the most distant to the most recent they are:
Sappho of Lesbos, the famous Greek poet; Jesus; Leonardo da Vinci; ShakesÂ­peare;
and Abraham Lincoln. For the most part, little is known about the inward
realities of these people, about their personal thoughts, reflections, and the
qualÂ­ity and nature of their feelings. For this reason they have become no more
than voices from the past: The contributions they have left us remain, but
little reÂ­mains of each person, of his or her personality, of the loves, fears,
pleasures, hatreds, beliefs, and thoughts each had.

Voices from the Past
was written by Paul Alexander
Bartlett over a period of several decades. After his death in an automobile
accident in 1990, the manuÂ­scripts of the five novels were discovered among his
as yet unpublished papers. He had been at work adding the finishing touches to
the manuscripts. Now, more than a decade and a half after his death, the
publication of
Voices from the Past
is overdue.

Bartlett is known for his fiction, including
When the Owl
Cries
and
AdiÃ³s Mi MÃ©xico
, historical novels set during the Mexican
Revolution of 1910 and descripÂ­tive of hacienda life,
Forward, Children!
,
a powerful antiwar novel, and numerous short stories. He was also the author of
books of poetry, including
Spokes for Memory
and
Wherehill
, the
nonfiction work,
The Haciendas of Mexico: An Artistâs Record
,

the
first extensive artistic and photographic study of haciendas throughÂ­out
Mexico, and numerous articles about the Mexican haciendas. Bartlett was also an
artist whose paintings, illustrations, and drawings have been exhibited in more
than 40 one-man shows in leading museums in the U.S. and Mexico. Archives of
his work and literary correspondence have now been established at the American
Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming, the Nettie Lee Benson Latin
American Collection of the University of Texas, and the Rare Books Collection
of the University of California, Los Angeles.

Paul Alexander Bartlettâs life was lived with a single value
always central: a sustained dedication to beauty, which he believed was the
most vital value of living and his reason for his life as a writer and an
artist.
Voices from the Past
reÂ­flects this commitment, for he believed
that these five voices, in their different ways, express a passion for life,
for the creative spirit, and ultimately for beauty in a variety of its
formsâpoetic and natural (Sappho), spiritual (Jesus), scientific and artistic
(da Vinci), literary (Shakespeare), and humanitarian (Lincoln). In this work,
he has sought, as faithfully as possible, to relay across time a renewed lyriÂ­cal
meaning of these remarkable individuals, lending them his own voice, with a
mood, simplicity, depth of feeling, and love of beauty that were his, and, he
beÂ­lieved, also theirs.

The journal form has been used only rarely in works of
fiction. Bartlett beÂ­lieved that as a form of literature the journal offers the
most effective way to bring back to life the life-worlds of significant,
unique, highly individual, and important creators. In each of the novels that
make up
Voices from the Past,
his interest is to portray the inner
experience of exceptional and special people, about whom there is scant
knowledge on this level. During the many years of research he devoted to a
study of the lives and thoughts of Sappho, Jesus, LeoÂ­nardo, Shakespeare, and
Lincoln, he sought to base the journals on what is known and what can be
surmised about the person behind each voice, and he wove into each journal
passages from their writings and the substance of the testimony of others. Yet
the five novels are fiction: They re-express in an authorâs creation lives now
buried by the passage of centuries.

I am deeply grateful to my wife, Karen Bartlett, for her
faithful, patient, and perceptive help with this long project.

For
my father,

Â Paul
Alexander Bartlett,

whose
kindness, love of beauty and of place

will
always be greatly missed.

Sapphoâs Journal

âViolet-haired, pure

honey-smiling Sapphoâ

â Alcaeus

FOREWORD

Willis Barnstone

Distinguished Professor
Emeritus of Comparative Literature

P

aul Alexander Bartlettâs journal of
Sappho is a masterful work. I had recently completed a translation of the
extant lines of Sappho and am familiar with his problems. He was faced with the
almost impossible task of reconstructing the personality of Sappho and her
background in ancient Lesbos. To my happy surprise he did so, in a work which
is at once poetic, dramatic and powerful. In
Sapphoâs

Journal
he
does more than create a vague illusion of the past. He conveys the character of
real people, their interior life and outer world. A mature artist, he writes
with ease and taste.

Sapphoâs poetry, quoted
in this novel, is included with the translatorâs permission. The poems appeared
in
Sappho, Lyrics in the Original Greek
, with translations by Willis
Barnstone, Anchor Books, Doubleday, 1965.

For clarity, the
calendar used by Sappho has been translated into our modern calendar.

Sapphoâs Journal

Sappho, walking on her island beach,

pauses by a broken amphora:

With one foot, she nudges the terra cotta and black jar,

its painted chariot, charioteer and horses:

The charioteer wears a laurel wreath.

Sappho, about 30 years old,

her hair braided around her head,

naked, sandaled, saunters along the Mediterranean,

gulls and pelicans flying, surf and gull sounds in early morning
yellow.

Villa
Poseidon, Mytilene

642 B.C.

T

he great storm beats across the
island, rattling the olive and the cypress, piling the surf on the beach,
hissing the rain across my roof. It is cold and the light of my terra cotta
lamp is cold. Some say that a storm will wash away our island, but I do not
believe it. Our island will be here long after I have gone, and so will our
town, my dear Mytilene, so wrong, so right.

Alcaeus would revel in this gale and go out in it and let
the rain lash him and then he would come and take me in his arms.

The storm will rage all night and the gutters spew, and I
will rage at my soliÂ­tude, a solitude that grows and grows.

Growl on, spew on, beat and trampâtomorrowâs sun will return
and the seaâs eye will glitter and I will gaze across the bayâand Alcaeus will
not be here.

My feet are cold and the lamp is weak and the wax hard, and
I must go to bed.

P

Yesterday, the wine workers gathered at a nearby vineyard,
old men and girls, in tattered clothes, some lazy, some hard-working, pressing
the grapes, many of them my friends. Spade-bearded Niko directed the pressing,
sitting at the base of an oak, wearing a stained robe, his voice low. Women carried
hampers of grapes loaded with purple clusters, the womenâs skirts wet with dew,
the grapes mottled with damp. Clouds made the day cool. Someone toyed with a
flute, the men treading, emptying husks over sandy soil, now and then pausing
to talk under the oak, the circular press letting out its red, everyone
tasting. Many amphorae were broken, before they were finally filled and capped.

I wanted to help. How sweet the smell flooding my nose.

P

Atthis has been my girl-child today and we have strolled
together up the long, long path to the outcrop, beyond the temple. Atthis and
tall white marble colÂ­umns, with their busy apricot-breasted swallows, have
assuaged my loneliness. How lonely we become, as we grow older, even when there
is someone to share. The key to self gets lost; self-assurance diminishes.
Once, it was only necessary to dash around the garden or throw back oneâs head
and laugh...

Yellow-headed Atthis, lazy-eyed, sitting on the steps of the
temple ruin, wove a flower wreath for me and I wove one for her. Then,
returning home, we bathed at our fountain, splashing each other, the sun on us
and the slippery marÂ­ble. Afterwards, we lay down and slept, and I dreamed of a
ship at sea, her mast broken, her tangled sail and rigging dragging.

Will the war never end?

P

Fog, as grey as a shepherdâs cloak, ruffled the bay for a day
and a night. Then, stabbing us, came clarity, and inside that clarity, centered
in it, a brown intaglio, a small wooden carving, first one ship and then
another. Our fleet had sailed back to us! I watched from the terrace, unable to
speak. Atthis ran up to me. AnakÂ­toria came. Gyrinno came. Boys yelled. Old men
rushed past the house. Dogs barked. Someone banged a drum. Such clamoring!

But was it joyous news, I asked myself? Why were the women
in a knot at the corner? Why hadnât fast rowers raced to tell us? Had the fog
tricked the fleet?

Changing my clothes, putting on new sandals, I walked to the
pier and the seagulls screamed and we waited and waited. People surged all
about, saying wild things, shriekingâthen, ominously, fell silent. Their shouts
were better than their silence. The ocean seemed too calm, as if it had been
smothered by the fog or dreaded the arrival of our fleet.

I had pictured the ships as fast moving, bright on bright
water.

As the first one approached, I saw no happy faces, no lifted
hands, no raised shields, no plumed helmets at the rail, no flags.

I heard an oar drag and in that sound I heard the rasp of
death. If Alcaeus is dead, I will take poisonâand I saw myself going to Xerxes,
our Persian chemist, and asking for the powder. We had agreed, years back,
during another crisis, that he would allow me this gift to free myself, if I
must. His yellow face vanished, as I watched an anchor plunge slowly and saw the
sail topple into the water and heard a man cry some name.

Shouts went up.

A chorus began.

Voices caught our song, way out at sea, assuring us that
these were not phantoms.

Alcaeus?

Ten years ago, almost tenâten years ago, he had left
Mytilene, the wars sweeping him away. Ten years we had lived with fear creeping
about our island. Ten yearsâhow my fingers trembled. I saw those years, there
on the wharf, saw them in the gullsâ wings, in the distraught faces about me,
my girlsâ, my friendsâ, my neighborsâ. We had all waited for this homecoming.
And now, now our fleet was gliding toward us, grey-hulked, no flags raised,
oars shuffling like sick crabs.

Was it defeat or half-victory? Who, among our men, was lost,
dead, or wounded? Gull on the masthead, apple at the end of the bough, what can
you tell us at such crucial times? For an infinitude, the oars paced, a boat
swung, another boat anchoring alongside, the armor on deck flashing, the waves
gulping at the gulls.

I turned away, moved back.

And then I saw someone helping Alcaeus ashoreâwounded or
illâand old, old, I thought.

Beauty said to me: This is only change.

And I said: But what is change?

And I slipped away, not daring to meet him, hoping someone
would shout a name and confirm that this was another, not Alcaeus. But no, I
knew. A woman knows a man she has loved, however battered he may be. I turned
to watch his blundering progress.

The chorus had dwindledâonly those at sea, the far off
crews, still carried the hymn. I could not remain any longer. I hurried home, past
his house to mine, wondering what kind of haven it could be, wondering what
people would say at my flight. Yet this was not flight; it was merely a
postponement, waiting for a sign, a chance to prepare myself. Alcaeus...must I
send someone to him? What must I do? Go to his home? Shall I be there for him
when he arrives?

At my door I turned and retraced my steps to his house, the
laces of my sanÂ­dals making a sound I had never heard before, the gulls
wailing, the sounds from the wharf intermingling and incomprehensible.

And I was there when he came with his servant, an ugly
Parthian, helping him. Yes, I was there and put out my hand to touch him,
hearing his troubled breathing, seeing his torn and disheveled clothes, his
rank beard, and knowing he was ill. I remembered the dream, the ship with its
broken sail. And I rememÂ­bered our love and I said to him:

âAlcaeus...it is I, Sappho...â

He squared his shoulders, his cloak slipping away. His arms
went out to me, then dropped to his side.

His eyes had the marble core of nothingness in them.

Appalled, I could scarcely stand. O God, what is this that
can happen to a man? Why has it happened? His arms in bandages, his eyes
forever bandaged by the dark.

âAlcaeus...â

He heard my whisper and shuffled backwards, bumping his
servant; he moved forward then and gripped me hard, twisting my flesh, his
great muscles rising in his hands.

âTake me to my room... You havenât forgotten the way, have
you?â

I took his arm and the Parthian opened the door and servants
bowed about us; yes, I took his arm and silently we climbed the stairs to his
room, his clothes rough against me, his sea smell around me. We passed his
library that held the books he had loved. We passed his motherâs room, where
she had died. We passed where light fell around us, though no light entered his
eyes.

âYou are in your room,â I said.

âWhere?â

âBeside your Egyptian chair.â

âCan I sit down on it?â

âYes, itâs ready for you.â

Grasping the heavy frame, he lowered himself and the taut
leather squeaked. I placed a pillow behind him and drew a fur across his knees,
then sat next to him. The door had shut itself and we were alone. We listened
to each otherâs breathing and his hand sought mine and climbed my robe to my
face and the coarse fingers felt my cheek and I felt them reach my heart, with
the past roaring around me like the recent storm.

I couldnât speak. I felt that the war was forever between us
and I hated those years, those battles, the lines on his face. My hate was
there, between us. Then, then, tears came to his eyes. Silently, he wept. And I
drew him to me.

I heard the wind cross over his house.

Voices shuffled below us in the courtyard, the excited
voices of the caretakers, the idle, the hangers-on. I could imagine their
leers, their whispers. I lifted his face toward mine and kissed him, his heavy
beard sticking my mouth.

There was a sobâa broken gasp. How ill he looked, how
tired...

âYou must lie down, Alcaeus. Come, Iâll help you.â

And when he was settled, I brought him water.

âWater...there hasnât been much water these last few days at
sea...â

P

So he had come home, âhomeward from earthâs far end,â on the
shield of blindness. I saw him next day and the next, but he seemed strange,
withdrawn. I found two of his servants but he wasnât interested.

I thought of him as old. But was he old? Age was in his
scars, in his streaked hair and beard, the hands lifting and settling
awkwardly.

Warm under the stars, the daphne fragrant, his sea terrace
tiles smooth unÂ­derneath our feet, we sat alone, some rooster vaguely saluting
the night, the movement of the surf faint, almost lost. I crushed some daphne
in my palm, remembering their four-pronged flowers, rememberingâremembering
Alcaeus after his field games, his javelin and discus throwing, his flushed
face, his eyes lit, his mouth hungry for mine. Rememberingâwas he remembering,
too?

âThere was no daphne where I was,â he said, his voice
sullen. âIt would have been better to have died there, than come home like
this.â

âItâs spring, Alcaeus, donât talk like that,â I said, and
wondered what spring might signify to him.

He did not speak for a while, then quietly, as though to
himself, or from anÂ­other world, he repeated lines we had loved:

âThe gods held me in Egypt, longing to sail for home, for I
had failed to seek their blessing with an offering...â

His voice had not changed, I realized with a start.
Surcharged with new meaning, it entered my being, as he went on about the
galleys and the old men âdeep in the seaâs abyss.â

The phrase haunted me because it was he who lived in an
abyss.

As days passed, defeat was all that we heard in our town,
not outright defeat, but capitulationâretreat combined with truce, truce
necessitated by deception. Or was it confusion? The soldiers I met, after their
drunken reunions, spoke of the war with bitterness. Ten years, they said. Ten
years, for what? And how many of us came back? Those who had been away longest
considered themselves outÂ­casts and those who had returned during the war
complained, unable to recogÂ­nize their families.

Standing on the wharf, I familiarized myself with the fleet,
its remnants, anÂ­chored forlornly in the bay, boys swimming around the hulls,
the decks bone dry, hawsers trailing, a door off its hinges, the cordage so
rotten a gull might topple a spar. Disgust in my mouth, I tasted the waste of
life, Alcaeusâ, my own, my friendsâ.

What is life for, but love?

And love sent Atthis and me along the beach, stretching our
legs, running, dashing in and out of shallows, finding periwinkles, the day
even-tempered, goats nibbling at wild celery, their bells lazy, a fisherman
waving at us as he cast his net, clouds over the mountain. I noticed Atthis
against the luminous water, her fragile face trusting life. Her yellow ringlets
in my lap, she sang to me and then, eyes shut, fingers in the sand, she seemed
to steal away.

âWhat are you thinking about, darling?â

âYou...â

âWhat about?â

âYou and Alcaeusâyou are so troubled for him.â

âThen you have seen him?â

âYesterday. And Iâm afraid.â

âWhy?â

âBecause what is there left for himâand you?â

âI canât answer you, Atthis. Time answers such questions.â

I sense my old loneliness, a loneliness that was distorted
like a shipâs rib, tossed on the beach, warped because of bad luck.

âHis arms have been injured, too,â Atthis said.

âThey will get better, in time...â And I heard time in the
receding wave and felt it in her ringlets and in her hands.

âYouâre so sweet,â she said and I saw myself mirrored in her
eyes. And it ocÂ­curred to me that Alcaeus and I would never again be able to
exchange notes, those hasty, affectionate scribbles. Would he ever again
dictate his bawdy poems, lampoon dictators and brag about war? Had pen and desk
become his enemies?

Many things occurred to me, there on the sand, as Atthis and
I talked softly.

Sapphoâs garden, terraces of roses, shrubbery and cypress,

has the ocean below: moonlit, she stands white-robed

close to marble statuary:

a nude Hermes, a bust of Aphrodite,

a niobe, an athlete from Delphi.

Sappho sits down on a bench and fingers a lyre.

Mytilene

T

onight, I have returned to my
poetry, for the solace and sound of my pen. Here in my library, time will be
defeated for a moment, at least. The sunâs last rays stream in, so yellow, they
might be made of acacia. The cooling light covers my desk and bookshelves and
relinquishes its hold of my vase. A fragment clings to the amphora Alcaeus gave
me long ago. Its dancing, singing men seem somehow out of focus; yet it seems I
hear the flute and lyre of the ceramic players.

I dreamed I talked with Cyprus-born...

No, that is a poor line.

Maybe this is a better theme for tonight:

But I, I love delicate living, and for me,

richness and beauty belong to the sun...

P

There was a symposium and Gyrinno danced for the guests and
afterwards brought me news about Alcaeus, how he left the party and wandered to
the beach. There he quarreled with Charaxos, both armed with sticks and
staggering drunk. At first, Gyrinno garbled the news, mixing it with the
symposiumâs talk of war, the defeat, the hatreds of many kinds, including
punishment and forfeit. It must have been a sorry meeting, this reunion of our
warriors. Gyrinno reached me drenched with wine the men hard thrown on her.
Other girls had been treated the same.

Welcome homeâmen!

When I had soothed Gyrinno and bathed and perfumed and
powdered her, I went to the beach, thinking I might find them. Yes, they were
there, quarreling on the sand, my lover and my brother, kicking their naked
shins on driftwood, their servants standing by, only half interested and half
awake.

âCharaxos,â I began.

âAh...I rather expected you.â

âSappho?â called Alcaeus.

âGet up, both of you.â I moved past the servants
indignantly.

âJust leave us alone,â growled Charaxos.

âLeave a blind man with you, when it is you who is really
blind?â

âLetâs not resume our quarrel,â said Charaxos.

âWhen have we stopped?â

âPlease go away,â said Alcaeus, âI can take care of him,
myself.â

âIâll not go! I intend to see you home!â And I ordered the
servants to sepaÂ­rate them and leave me with Alcaeus.

Mumbling, he followed along the shore, walking uncertainly,
but keeping out of the way of the inrushing water. Where rocks littered the
beach, he allowed me to help him, and was soon apologizing.

âI havenât been home a month and already I act the fool.
What right have I to criticize anybody? So he brought home a slave woman.
Havenât I had my share?â

I did not interrupt, preoccupied as I was with guiding him.
Besides, my anger with Charaxos was too old, too deep-seated, too complex. It
was not a subject to pursue on the beach, with the wind carrying our words and
the breakers drownÂ­ing them. This was, I preferred, a private quarrel.

With Charaxos and his men following a distance apart, we
made a pretty picture, hiccoughing through Mytilene! Its silent streets were
topped by a new moon; Venus seemed swallowed by a single window. Why were we in
such conÂ­trast?

Laughter and outworn songs...swaying and shuffling...until
the shutting of my door.

Alone, I sit beside my lamp to consider its flame, the why
and wherefore of its integrity, fragility. Shadows are commonplace when we
ignite a lamp. Yet, without a light, there are profounder shadows.

P

I hear that Alcaeus goes out alone, forbidding his servants
to follow. EveryÂ­one has become uneasy.

Today, he dismissed his secretary. So poor Gogu has sought
me out to exÂ­plain what happened.

âSomeday he will do me in. He has threatened this often
enough!â He was trembling so hard, he could hardly speak. It is no wonder
Alcaeus calls him a âstick of driftwood.â He has an abandoned air that begs to
be found and picked up.

âThe least word, the least word upsets him. And you know how
Alcaeus can rant!â

âYes, well...â

âHe says our great fight at Sigeum was lost through sheer
carelessness. Of course, he blames the other officers...â

But then, Gogu has never held anyoneâs interest or respect
for long. Who but Alcaeus would have hired an epileptic, in the first place?
Almost everyone has rescued Gogu, at one time or another, from the surf, the
wine shop, the brothel or the forum. How does this knobby skeleton manage to
survive and endure?

âYou will speak to Alcaeus? You promise?â

I promised. The dread of having Gogu permanently abandoned
is worse than imploring Alcaeus to take him back. Besides, his scholarship is
often surprising, and Alcaeus can use his help.

So later, I invited Alcaeus and some friends to supper. We
sat around the courtyard fountain and listened to the harpists playing under
the burning lamps. Libus, Nanno, Suidasâthey are good company for Alcaeus. He
seemed more like himself again, joking and talking. Again he lampooned
Mimnermos and mimicked âthat strange-smelling country poet from Smyrna.â But I
detected a morbid note, a self-hostility that cut him more than it did those he
scorned.

Will he ever write again?

He left early, insisting he would find his way home by
himself. A soldier, reÂ­duced to being treated like an irresponsible infantâof
course he resented it. But I know he did not return home. Instead, he has
rambled into the hills again.

Now the others are gone. And I wonder, looking towards the
slope, what it is that Alcaeus hopes to find, a new life?

I shall not be able to sleep indoors tonight. My bed will
have to be under the trees. Perhaps the wind can bring me some special message.

P

The banquet honoring the warriors was held last night.

Alcaeus had his collection of war shields displayed on his
dining room walls. Of hide and metal, in various shapes, they united the room
and its glazing lamps and candles. I felt myself the focal point of a painted
eye on a circular hide, as I sat by him. I could not recall such an assembly in
years: Scythian, Etruscan, Turkish, Negro. Bowls of incense sent threads to the
ceiling. Wisps floated in front of me where a man in Egyptian clothes, headband
studded with rubies, sat beside his courtesan.

Alcaeus made his way to the dais, when everyone was seated,
about fifty of us. Hands resting on a table, arms healed and ringed with copper
bands, he leaned forward, waiting for silence. His hair had been freshly
curled, and his beard trimmed and brushed with oil. I was troubled, thinking he
might be impuÂ­dent or truculent. Instead he spoke gravely and it was difficult
to believe he could not see us. I thought he glanced straight at me.

âTonight, friends, there will be no tirade, no poetry. I
wish to pay my reÂ­spects, and offer my thanks for our return to our island. I
know how beautiful it is...â

There was a murmur of appreciation.

âSoldiers have a way of talking out of turn,â he went on,
reminding them of the gossip that had come to his ears, shameful talk that made
faces blush with guilt and anger.

âItâs time for me, as their commander, to speak. Very well,
I will!â And his voice thundered across the room, to make sure that none would
miss or mistake its message. Was this the Alcaeus who had joked and sported and
sung ribald songs, as the popular friend of young men who were proud, rich,
playful and naive? Here was someone speaking out of experience...

âI assure you the truce was an honorable truceâand will be
respected.â An older, solemn Alcaeus...who reviewed the war with wisdom.

âAnd now let us forget fear and enjoy life and see that our
people prosper.â It was an impressive speech, one they would long remember.

Our personal servants, assisted by the usual naked boys,
waited on us, pourÂ­ing the Chian wine. Gradually, people began to move about,
to talk and drink together. Men long absent from such gatherings moved
nervously or waited glumlyâalone or in knots of two or three, feeling separate.
How does one forget the battlefield? I heard the burr of ancient Egyptian.
Persian was spoken by men from Ablas. Women gathered about the newly returned;
some were excited, some were beautifully dressed, their hair piled in curls,
their shoulders bare, wearing gold sandals.

As the evening wore on, the old familiar sense of freedom
returned. Restraint dropped away. Voices and laughter increased. Then applause
broke out as a NeÂ­gro entertainer entered, carrying a smoking torch.

Under the edge of the portico, he freed a basket of birds
and juggled several wicker balls. I had never seen this gaunt, ribbed giant,
beautifully naked; some said he had come on a wine ship as a crewman. He spun
the cages higher and higher and as they whirled in the torch light, he tore
open first one and then anther, to liberate the birds. A magnificent
performance.

The suggestion worried Pittakos and he pushed through the
crowd to take the floor. Pittakos, with his rasping tongue and fish eyesâwas
there a more dishonest ruler? How ironical that he should represent us! As he
kept folding and unfolding his robe, he spoke about our fleet, how he would
have the ships repaired and converted into fishing boats for the use of the
community...never mentioning that our fleet was rotted!

Presently, the musicians and dancers wandered among us and
the party went on. After many songs and a lot of wine, Alcaeus slipped his arm
through mine and suggested we go upstairs. It was all very obvious, of
courseâthat he was drunk and I unwilling, that times had changed and everything
with it. When was it we had dashed, hand in hand, up his staircase, giggling
and pushing one anÂ­other? How many years ago?

Ah, deception and illusion, do we dare recreate the past and
its former hapÂ­piness? Only in memory is it done successfully. Yet, here we
were in his room.

Life
is for love!

In the old days, when we had made love, we had closed our
eyes, to intensify sensations. Now he would not need to shut his eyes. And his
arms, hands, finÂ­gersâonce young and sureâwhat could they remember?

I could not keep back tears, tears he would never know, as
he stumbled, laughed, then sprawled over the fur covÂ­ering of his bed. While
the music filtered in to us, I cushioned him in my lap and wiped the
perspiration from his face, hating the war and the years behind us. After
mumbling a few words, he turned over and fell into profound sleep.

So, that was the resumption of our love...and, as I leaned
against a hillside olive, the salt air fresh about me, I accepted defeat, aware
that my loneliness would appear again and again. There, on the hill, gazing
seaward, where fishing smacks moved, I rubbed the horny bark, envying the
treeâs longevity and its years ahead. Would I trade places, to brood over
Mytilene, for centuries?

Alone?

Then Atthis circled me in her arms, creeping up behind me and
cupping my eyes. I recognized her by her laughter and perfume.

âAtthis...â

P

Alcaeusâ home is much older than mine, with patina walls,
Parian marble floors, and a collection of rare Athenian busts. His library has
a Corinthian copy of Homer and a collection of Perianderâs maxims, while I have
been contented with some papyri, of choral lyrics and dithyrambs.

As I stretch out in a leather chair in his library and read
to him, the honeyÂ­suckle makes its fragrance outside, surely a womanâs flower,
so fecund. I try to keep my voice and thoughts within the room, beyond the
reach of its fragrance. The honeysuckle does not suit us or the room. And
Alcaeus knows this, too. His impassive features grow stern, as though to
reprimand me. Insatiable Sappho! Yet how can I help it? I must love and be
loved.

Laying down the book, I kneel and place my cheek against his
knee. His hands, gliding over my hair and neck, are dead. His voice, out of its
black, reÂ­proaches me.

I want to cry: but I didnât blind you!

The other day in the library, he said:

âI wanted to write something great... During the war, I
conceived of a series of island poems, bucolic, legendary, praise of this
life.â And he motioned toward the ocean and our island.

âDictate to me,â I said, hoping to rouse his impulse.

His silence, at first natural enough, went on, and I became
embarrassed by his stare at the bookshelves.

âI want to help you, Alcaeus.â

Again the silence. How was I to get through it?

Taking a volume of his poems, I read aloud several of his
favorites. Slowly, his face relaxed and he settled deeper in his chair. After a
while, he said:

âRead some of yours, Sappho.â

I opened a book, one of my earliest ones, and read several
passages. But I could not continue; I felt my mind wrapped in fog; my hands became
icy. I shut my eyes and said to myself: See, this is what itâs like to be
blind. Youâre blind, blind to love and life...

As I kissed him good-bye, I longed for our youth, its
freedom, its daring, its quarrels and fun.

Walking home, I told myself I should never return to his
house.

P

In looking back over the pages of my journal, I am alarmed
by the passage of time. When I was young, I thought time was a philanthropist.

I remember so well that day mama took me to the ocean, and
the rain fell unexpectedly, lashing and soaking us. We finally discovered a
shepherdâs hut, but I got colder and colder in its windowless gloom. Lying on
the floor, among stiff hides, with the rain sounding loud and the hides
smelling strong, I thought the storm would never end. Toward dusk, a shepherd
and his boy came, dripping with wet and shivering, and my mother dried the boy
and made him lie down with me under the hides. Were we seven or eight?
Together, our bodies grew warm and we lay still, listening to the wind and the
rain thud across the green roof, while the shepherd went about building a fire
and preparing supper. I have forgotten the boyâs name, but not his face.
Forever after, I thought of him as my first lover. I doubt whether we spoke a
word all that delicious evening.

Now I find it hard to renew ties with the past. Not only
Alcaeus...but DioÂ­scurides...Pylades...Milo...the very names make me unhappy.
All destroyed by war. What special stupidity do men possess that they must
involve themselves in such a gamble, with loss inevitable, anyhow?

T

he masks I have on my bedroom
walls seem less clever than they appeared years ago. Our theatre, too, has
changed through the years, become more mediocre.

Yesterday, at the play, I sat closer than usual and was
delighted by the comic faces, so new and frightful that children screamed and
squealed. Good, I thought. Perhaps the play may take on life.

...A man with a tambourine strutted about...an old beggar,
pack on back, pulled at his beard and mimicked words sung by the chorus. He
seemed to be one of us or a Chian, maybe. It was pleasant enough to soak myself
in comedy for a while, for right after the play, Charaxos found me and
suggested we stroll in private. Obviously, he had something on his mind!

He began by offering me an exquisite scarab, saying he had
purchased it for me, from a sailor who had touched port.

âFor me?â I became suspicious! I fingered the beetle-shaped
oval, unlike any I had seen. An amethyst was set in the center with characters
engraved around it.

âAn Etruscan scarab should make a pretty keepsake,â he said.

âThen I think you should keep it.â

âWhy? Are you afraid?â he asked.

âOf what?â

âThat it might bring bad luck.â

He laughed ironically, as he flipped and caught the scarab,
with a flick of his wrist.

âWhat is it you want?â I asked, coming directly to the
point.

âTo be treated with respect, Rhodopis and Iânot criticized.â

âDo I say too much?â

âI donât like your tongue.â He was scowling now.

âNor I your womanâs!â

âLeave her out! I warn youâsheâs no longer a slave!â

âIt wasnât that she was a slave that bothered me.â

âA courtesan, then!â

âNo, you should know better than that. Oh, no...it was your
assumption that our family funds could be lifted, without my consent and
without my knowledge. Taken to buy Rhodopis. You sold three or four wine ships
to pay her price, along with the money taken from me.â

âCanât you forget...â

âNot conveniently. Nobody enjoys being robbed.â

âI have said I would repay you.â

âBut that was nearly two years ago. And you go right on
selling wine and buying equipment. I have heard that you added a ship last
month. Wasnât it conÂ­venient to pay me then?â

His fist tightened over the scarab, and he bowed and turned
away, rejoining his wife who was strolling behind us with her friends and
servants.

Theatre!

Villa Poseidon

Atthis, Gyrinno, Anaktoria and I went swimming in the bay by
the driftwood tree. It was late, the sun misty, its eye sleepy, pelicans
roosting, a dolphin or two frolicking close to shore. I had been unable to
forget my meeting with Charaxos, until Anaktoria, who is the best swimmer among
us, grabbed me by the heels as I floated by, and towed me to the bottom. That
ended my anger and irritation. I lit after her, snatching for her long hair.
Arms around her, I forced her to tow me toward shore, making myself as heavy as
possible.

As the four of us played on the beach, I thought: When will
this happen again? Something about the late afternoonâits hammered out sun, its
tempered air, its windlessness, its smell of springâseemed unreal even as it
happened. We tossed our blankets on the sand, dashed back and forth to the
waterâs edge, splashed each other, then arranged ourselves in a circle and
began combing each otherâs hair. We sang and laughed, comparing, whose was
finest, whose was thickest.

Atthis, whose hair was shortest, bragged she could swim the
farthest. That started an argument.

âWho swam halfway round the island last year?â demanded
Gyrinno.

âWho was born at sea?â said Anaktoria.

âYou can tell the best swimmer by the shape of her
buttocks,â said Atthis. âLook at mine, how flat they are.â She jumped up, to
show us.

âA boyâs buttocks,â laughed Gyrinno.

âHere. Measure. Mine are smaller,â said Anaktoria.

So we measured, laughing, fussing, pushing, our hair
streaming around usâa gull on the shore padding back and forth, scolding.
Atthis won, but Anaktoria had the loveliest breasts, so round, almost
transparent in that evening light. I have rarely seen a girl of such grace, not
the childish grace of some, but the acÂ­complished grace of true femininity. As
the others became aware of my admiraÂ­tion, they became jealous and peevish, and
tried to shift the praise.

They talked about my smallness, my violet hair... âyour deep
blue eyesâ... âyour melodious voice...â

But this was Anaktoriaâs hour. She had been away, visiting
in Samnos, staying with her family, and I was eager to hear the news.

âI thought I was homesick... But it is Mytilene I love
best... My brother has a girl now. He goes to her house whenever he is not
working. I saw very little of him... Life there was very dull. Family visits
from door to door. The same cup of wine, the same paste of nuts and fruit, the
same questions, answers, family anecÂ­dotes and jokes... How lonesome I was!â

Growing quiet, all of us responded to the evening, the
lingering sea-light, the arrival of the stars, the whispering shingle, the
breeze, carrying the scents and sounds from Mytilene.

Anaktoria and I walked home together, feeling our bond
closer, stronger than before. I had missed her more than I thought: I had
missed her a dozen times a day.

P

I have been sick today and to amuse myself I have made some
jottings about my girls:

Atthisâlover of yellow ribbons, scared of the dark. To avoid
going out, will invent a headache, a toothache or a stomachache. An orphan, she
gets homesick for the home she never had. Prefers women to men. Tells amusing
jokes and stories. Loves laughter. Mimics. Is made jealous easily. Speaks
slowly...ivory-skinned.

Gyrinnoâthe daughter of a wine merchant, can outdrink most
men. Worries about her figure, eats next to nothing. Uses violet perfume. Our
best dancer. Otherwise, is lazy, careless of dress and makeup. Never reads.
Wants to marry someone wealthy and entertain lavishly. Snores.

Anaktoriaâhair yellower than torchlight, soft-girl, dabbler
in poetry, dreamer, lovely singer. Plays lyre and flute equally well. Adores
games, trees, flowers, swimming, archery. Wants to travel, be a priestess.

Then there are the new girls: Heptha, with copper hair...
Myra, who is Turkish... Helen, a scatterbrained darling... Ah, but each is
exquisite in her own way. No two are alike. I love them all.

And yet, I am grieved, since my own daughter is jealous of
them. Dear, foolÂ­ish Kleis, who pretends she has never been a child and is yet
so far from being a woman.

P

I have spent weeks over a poem, revising, revising.

I do my best writing in the morning, when the sea light is
sparking my room. How important the harmony is to me: harmony in my house, on
the island, in my heart.

Sometimes, I call my girls to let them hear what I have
written. Sometimes, in the evenings, I recite my poems for friends. Sometimes,
I go days, unable to write a word. They are cold days.

Shall I use eleven syllables?

A poem does not grow like a leaf, but has to be shaped. I
often think of a lyric as an amphora; little by little I must mold its lines on
the wheel of my mind. It is the structure, containing the song. It must be
graceful, strong, so that the words and the music can flow...

The wings of the swans have drawn you toward the dark ground,

with yoke chariot bearing down from heaven...

Come to me...free me from trouble...

P

Today I received a letter from Aesop, written at Adelphi. It
is a joy to hear from him. I thought he had forgotten me. What a good companion
he was, all those days in Corinth... Companion? He was more like a father!

His handwriting is the most perfect I have ever seen. Each
letter formed so patiently, each thought expressed so beautifully. Does he
strive for perfection because be cannot forget his deformity?

I remember his eyes used to transfix me with their brown
hypnosis.

He must be fifty, I think.

He had his beard trimmed and his hair curled, every morning.
His robes, so elegant, so clean, were always perfumed. I seldom saw him without
his doll, that bull-leaping doll of Cretan ivory, brightly painted! But his
apartment was simple, tastefully furnished, elegant as his clothes. Each bath
towel, I recall, bore a brilÂ­liant red octopus.

When he looked after Alcaeus and me, we ate with him every
day at least one meal. Through all the years of our exile, he remained our most
faithful friend. His friends were our friends. His house was ours. His
servants. He treated eveÂ­ryone with equal respect.

âI never forget that I was a slave,â he often said.

He was much sought after, not only for his humor, but for
his wisdom. His reddish whiskers and black brows gave him a comic look. But he
sensed his proÂ­fundity, as he guided me about Corinth and sat beside me at the
temple of Apollo, watching the people and the boats and the sea birds, and
hearing the choral virgins sing.

Evenings, he would lay aside his doll and tell me fables. He
had learned many from his father, a Persian, and he was constantly visiting
orientals to pick up their stories and jokes. I hear his smooth, somnolent
voice...an effortless story- teller!

âI will certainly come and visit you,â he writes. âI am
tired of Adelphi. The people make me uncomfortable. I want to roam over Lesbos,
to be with you and Alcaeus. I want to see your home.â

Will he come? I hope he can. His letter has taken weeks to
reach me. I supÂ­pose he could be on his way, by this time.

P

It must have been almost dawn, when Alcaeus and a group of
revelers came banging at my door, shouting, laughing. We let them in and they
demanded breakfast, some of the more intoxicated trying to seduce my girls, who
were quite amused.

When the others were gone, Alcaeus drew me aside to speak in
earnest.

âDo you know that Kleis goes to Charaxosâ house?â

âWhat do you mean by that?â

âThat she visits your brotherâs house frequently.â

âDo you know this...or is it gossip?â

âWe just went by his place. Sheâs there now. I would know
her voice anywhere.â

âYes, of course...â

âI donât like his slaves, as you know, and I donât think
they are fit company for Kleis.â

âNo, no, certainly, I shall speak to her...â

âIt will take more than that, Iâm afraid.â

âWhy, Alcaeus, sheâs a mere child...â

âOh come now, Kleis must be fourteen or more. If she were my
daughter, a pretty girl...â He held up a warning finger, then left.

P

Fourteen? No doubt he meant well, was sincere, but I
resented the implicaÂ­tion.

Have I really been lax? Is my little girl in need of
direction? It seems she was ten or eleven only yesterday. Fourteen, indeed!

Kleis never knew her father. He is one of a thousand dead,
because of the wars. If he were here, she would not think of slipping off at
night. She looks much like him. I remember his face, the candid eyes and lips.

I remember the ivory gleam of his body. Ah, if he were
here...

How am I to forbid Kleis?

Where is my frivolity? Where is my enthusiasm?

The sunâs color whitened my shutters and I threw them open
on the sea and the light burnished the tiles and splashed the masks and my bed
and I stared into its eye, to surprise its oracle.

P

I am criticized for my simple dress, my tastes. The
townspeople say I should not be aloof. They say I am too aristocratic. They say
my parties are too gay and exclusive. They say my wealth is insufficient. They
say...Yes, I could go on with this pettiness. But why should I?

I have my work and I must live to see beyond the moment, below
the surÂ­face; I must interpret the whole heart. For I know too well the
inexorability of time, the disappointments that nibble oneâs heels. I must
offset the pain, the loss. There is no one to take my arm, there is no one to
lean on. There is only my workâand my girls.

P

All day in the fragrant lemon forest, fallen fruit
underneath the trees...all day alone. I have hated loneliness and yet I must be
able to rest and get away from responsibilities, to welcome the gods of trees
and ocean and those long dead, whose marble shrines dot a corner of this wood.
There are so many dead. HowÂ­ever, life must be better than death or the gods
would have chosen to die. Life must be day-by-day and hour-by-hour. And I talk
to myself and totally convince myself and then the mew of a gull shatters my
conviction.

P

Our spring revel saw us high on the mountain, the ocean
misty blue, our erotic flutes wailing the dawn. Kleis and I danced together, my
girls joining us one by one, the deepest notes growing in volume, the slight notes
dropping away. How the wet grass slid our feet!

I closed my
eyes, remembering nothing, letting the song have me; then, eyes open, I went on
forgetting, forgetÂ­ting where I was, what this was: I was simply dancing,
flashing with someone, alone, dancing for myself and the onÂ­coming sun, dancing
because I love to dance, dancing because I love life and time is dead. Yes, time
is dead at our spring festival and the flowers never spill from our hair.

Girls bared their breasts and arms to the light. Men clapped
in unison. The music sped up and the faster pace widened our circle of dancers.
Our bare feet kicked blossoms thrown by boys. We ate and danced, drank and
danced again. Kleis, it seemed to me, danced more beautifully than anyone.

Beauty, I said: We are here again, help us to find lifeâs
meaning.

Beauty said: There is always meaning, look for it.

The step and re-step, circle and re-circle, gulp of air,
ache of chest, ache of legs and arms, sullen eyes, eyes longing for
embrace...longing... longing...isnât that what life is?

Our tumbled-down temple rose behind us, whitish pillars,
roofless phalli, our gowns, arms and faces, circling.

Through my blur of happiness, I saw Anaktoria, Libus, Gorgo,
Nano, old friends, fishermen, villagers. Old women went about hawking oranges.
Old men drank and talked.

In the afternoon, resting under trees, I became aware that
the crowd had scattered into small groups. How hungry we were! How thirsty!
Then more dancing and, with tiny fires in the twilight, food cooking, pots bubbling,
love-making, songs. It was the dusk I love. And it was easy to grow
sentimental, to talk of Alcaeus and miss him, to remember our fun at other
festivals. Crickets bubbled like little pots. Frogs burped. A bat fluttered
over our fires. Below, somewhere on the bay, a ship winked and made me feel
that the sky had gotten below us.

A warm wind and some scarves, that was all I needed to
sleep, a sleep someÂ­what troubled because Kleis was not with me. But during the
night she appeared and slipped into my arms, where she began to cry. I
comforted her and slept and thought no more about her girlish tears till
morning, when she whispered about Charaxos, his heavy drinking, then the
darkness and torches, the wild games and dances higher up the mountain...

âI shouldnât have gone with him! I should have stayed with
the other boys and girls right here. This time, he has changed me. Iâll never
be the same! And I canât bear the sight of him!â

...A journal is for solace, for strength.

I write in my library, the rain falling, Kleis in her room,
asleep. How sad when youth is tricked! One speaks of treachery, stupidity, ugliness.
One thinks of family honor. And then I realize that Charaxos has no sense of
honor, that my code is incomprehensible to him. So, Iâll not show my distressâour
distress.

Life is for the strong, they say.

How strong must a person be?

P

I feel like dry smoke. And smoke twists and turns inside,
not knowing which way to go. Nothing is hotter than the heat of anger.

Charaxosâhow the name burns my tongue, sears my tablet. It
is impossible to concentrate!

It wasnât enough for us to quarrel over money! You, with
your scarab, your Egyptian clothes, your obelisks, your slaves, your woman!

Perhaps Kleis is mistaken. Children are given to
exaggeration.

I donât know what to believe.

P

Today, an earthquake shook our island, sloshing water from
our courtyard fountain, making birds cry out. As the walls of the house
trembled, I shut my eyes, thinking: No, not yet...thereâs still so much.

And I made up my mind to go out more, to get about more.
With Kleis. We need more time together.

P

How tall she is! With golden hair and mint eyes, she grows
more like her faÂ­ther each day. I detect a restlessness in her nature. Is it
because of what hapÂ­pened, or because she is with me? Or do I imagine it?

Her shoulders stoop, her face is sad. When I speak to her
about it, she straightens and gazes far off, her eyes worried. Perhaps we make
a strange pair.

P

Gems:

A horseman on a gold agate,

a Nike on chalcedony,

a nude girl on jasper,

a fighting lion on rock crystal...

Sappho is enjoying her collection:

the sun, in her bedroom, is all white.

She is all white.

The gems flash:

We see Sapphoâs face in her hand mirror,

the faces of her girls around her,

girls singing.

Mytilene

O

ne of my girls has had a birthday.
It should have been a happy day. There were garlands, songs, dances... Then,
someone came to me, brimming with the amusing story: Kleis has been heard to
say that she doesnât know how old she is!

âIâve had so many double birthdays, Iâve lost count,â were
the words reÂ­peated to me.

Why do we wish to be older, younger, always in protest? Why
are we never satisfied?

I wish there were no birthdays.

P

For several days, Kleis and I have sailed, our boat a good
fishing boat, capÂ­tained by a young man named Phaon.

It was our first excursion around the whole island, in
years. We sailed past Malea Point to Eresos, to Antiss, then Methymn, and round
our island, back to Mytilene. I have never seen the water so calm. Probably
because of the recent hot spell, the captain said.

What a peaceful island, our Lesbos... We saw Mt. Ida, olive
groves, cypress, temples, bouldered shores, goatherds, date palms, sailboats,
dolphins... We thought of Odysseus, trying to identify ourselves with that
heroic past, weâonly islanders enjoying a holiday!

A striped awning sheltered us during the hot hours of the
day. Nights were cool and comfortable. Our handsome captain was attentive. I
thought he was particularly agreeable. Our food was tasty. How time drifted
along.

Of course it was our being together, lulled by the sea, that
made the trip so happy for Kleis and me. It was our shared regrets, our resolve
for the future, that brought us close. It was the little things we did for one
another, the sleeping together...the voiceless communication.

P

How wonderful it is to get out of bed and stand by the
window and take in the sea and breathe deeply.

How good it is to dream a little.

Phaeon...it is such a beautiful name.

P

There are days when my girls seem utterly listless. Their
activities have no meaning to them. Nothing pleases them. I hear them arguing
among themselves, apart. It is as though a stranger had come to be with them.

And Kleis seems more withdrawn. Does she resent the others
or do they reÂ­sent her? A curious unease creeps about the place.

Sometimes, I wonder whether it is I who lacks.

P

I do not feel well.

Time is slipping by...

I donât know what to do about Kleis: she goes off by
herself, and does not tell me where she goes. I canât very well send someone to
check on her. Thatâs an ugly thing to do.

I think she isnât visiting Charaxosâ house, because he has
sailed for Egypt on one of his wine ships. Of course she could be seeing
someone else.

Is it possible that she is interested in Phaon...how shall I
find out?

P

I met him on the pier, the wind blowing, the water choppy
under grey skies. He left off caulking his boat with a cheery âHelloâ and
climbed onto the pier. How pleased he was to see me! Was I planning another
trip?

Sitting on piles of rope, he told me of an underwater city
he had seen, with a great bronze statue of Poseidon by a temple...

âThe water was like glass, not a seaweed moving, not a
current...â His hand swept sideways, spread flat. âOh yes, coral...and plenty
of fish, big ones. I swam halfway down to the city, but there was no air in me
to swim deeper. A fish watched me, from one side of Poseidon, its body curving
behind the statue. Poseidonâs eyes were made of jewels...â

Phaon is a handsome young man: I think a man is a man when
he is handsome all over. I measured him with my eyes, as he talked to me. I
measured his feet, hands, thighs, shouldersâthe symmetry is unusual. His skin
is the color of oakum and his muscles glide perceptibly under his skin. He smells
of the sea.

I stayed a long while, talking on the piles of rope,
exciting talk. What would it be like to swim with him? To dive deep with him?

We talked and talked. He never mentioned Kleis. And I forgot
why I came.

P

I went to Alcaeus, to tell him about the submerged city.

âYou mean Helike?â he asked. âA quake tore apart the coast
and it went unÂ­der,â he said, and described something of what I had heard.

âPhaon says the city is visible when the waterâs clear, and
still,â I said.

âPhaon?â

âYes, you remember, the captain who took me on a trip around
the island...â

âHe fixed his sightless eyes on me and I felt stunned, as
one hypnotized. I trembled. Then his expression altered and he changed the
subject as quickly as a man might draw a sword during battle.

âI never thought Iâd be blind. I never memorized any faces.
My home, our bay, the shipsâI canât recall things at will, with certainty.
Thereâs so little differÂ­ence now between sleeping and waking. Anything may
come to mind.

âA soldier stares at his hand, slashed by a spear. He canât
believe heâs wounded. Itâs not his blood spattering the rocks...

âA man lies beside his shield, a hole in his side. He canât
believe he sees what he sees...â

P

Mytilene

For several days, I have been working with Alcaeus in his library.
He has taken heart, at last, and is pouring out words, political invective. I
sit, amazed. Even his dead eyes have gathered light. He jabs out phrase after
phrase, juggling his agate paperweight from hand to hand, steadily, slowly. I
barely have time to write. He breathes deeply, his voice sonorous.

Facing the sea, afternoon light on his face, he could be my
old Alcaeus.

Thasos brought us wine.

And we worked still late, our lamps guttering in the wind,
the air rough from the mainland, tasting of salt. Shutters groaned.

âTo strike a balance between common sense and law, this is
the cause to which we must pledge ourselves. Our local tyrants must go. They
realize there isnât enough corn. Poverty, we must grind against poverty. If our
established life and prosperity canât be made to serve, they, too, will go...â

Walking home, I was hardly aware that a gale had sprung up.
Exekias, carryÂ­ing my cloak, seemed surprised at my singing.

P

A note from Rhodopisânaturally, I was astonished. Her note
concerned Kleis: could we talk together?

It was hard to order my thoughts. Rhodopis writing to me,
especially with Charaxos gone...

I fixed an hour and we met at a discreet distance from the
square, a bench in the rear of a small temple.

Despite the extravagant clothes, the careful makeup, how
hard the eyes, the mouth. And I wondered how I looked to her, in my simple
dress. But Rhodopis knows the sister of Charaxos is not naive.

It was a brief meeting, cold, the matter quickly attended
to.

After waving her servants to stand apart, she faced me with
unveiled scorn:

âYou daughterâs visits are making my household a difficult
one,â she said.

I flushed.

âSo the plaintiff has become the accused? An interesting
reversal,â I murÂ­mured.

âI will expect thanks,â she said, with a mocking smile,
twisting her parasol into the sand, âfor sparing you public embarrassment.â

I knew she was sharpening her wits, and paused. She lifted a
scented handÂ­kerchief to her mouth and took a slow breath.

âI have waited a long time for this, but Iâm more charitable
than you think. I wonât keep you waiting. It is Malliaâa servant boy, who has
caught Kleisâ fancy...â

Vaguely, I had the flash of an image: a fair, slim, country
boy, not one of the slaves.

âAnd what is it you want?â I said, in the same level voice.

The parasol twirled.

âOh, things could be arranged...â

I did not doubt this. But not knowing the relationship
between Kleis and Mallia, remained silent. My silence seemed to exasperate
Rhodopis.

âOf course, you could send Kleis to a
thiase
in
Andros,â she exclaimed. I reÂ­fused to flinch. Sending oneâs daughter to school
elsewhere was to admit oneâs own school had failed. Rhodopis knew this, as well
as I.

âOr, I could dismiss Mallia, but then, where would the
lovers meet? And if he took her home with him...â

I still waited. Somewhere there was a trap. Rhodopis had not
written, then met me, without a purpose.

âPerhaps you have given too much thought to family honor,
Sappho. So critical of Charaxos...of me.â Her voice had grown confidential.

âIf Kleis has done anything foolish, I am willing to accept
the responsibility,â I said.

âAnd the consequence, too...with my husband?â

I stood up, brushing off the bench dust.

The interview was over: obviously, further discussion was
useless. Why let Rhodopis press her advantage? I nodded and left, with the
sound of her laughter behind me.

P

Why?

It is a question I must answer: it is a multiple question.

Has Rhodopis done this to spite me, wound me, shame me?

Is Kleis doing this to assert herself, to prove that she is not
a child? In proÂ­test, against me, my house? To estrange us farther?

Did Kleis tell the whole truth about that day at the
spring-revel? If I knew what happened...

She seemed so happy on our ocean trip. Or was it I who was
happy? Perhaps I teased her too much before Phaon. Did she think I had no right
to be attracted to him? Do I make her out to be more sensitive than she really
is?

Love is a jealous companion.

Right now, all I can see clearly is that perfumed
handkerchief and twirling parasol.

P

I have never been afraid of consequences attached to my own
actions. Must one learn to be braver than that? Or is this a matter of
impersonal wisdom?

P

I have sent for Kleis...

It is true she is fond of Mallia, the boy acting as guardian
to her in the house of Charaxos, protecting her from Charaxos.

It was Mallia who served as wine boy at the spring festival.

Curiously, it is Rhodopis who has sided with them in
opposing and blocking Charaxos. Yet, that is not so curious, either.

âYouâre wrong to distrust Rhodopis,â says Kleis.

But my doubts persist and I consider her a foolish child.
For why would she make a confidante of Rhodopis?

âI wish you could be happier with me,â I said.

Our talk seemed to unlock her heart and she burst into tears
and I learned how much of a child she is. For it is still filial jealousy that
makes her difficult. She cannot bear to share me with my girls, my friends,
even my work.

Poor, darling Kleis, how hard it is for some of us to grow
up, to learn to walk gracefully alone. I kissed and comforted her as best I
could, assuring her of my love.

âThereâs a place for you here, Kleis. Please try to find it.
I know the girls are eager to help you, if youâll let them.â

She promised, but the far-away look remained in her eyes.

A
thiase
in Androsâthe thought saddens me, for then
she would be far away.

P

I have hurled myself into work. During long silences, while
I am thinking, composing, I hear the water clock outside my door. Drop after
drop, it fastens itself to my memory.

The wind has continued for days on end, the sun hazy, the
surf magnificent in its wildness, all craft beached, no gulls anywhere, a sense
of abandonment throughout our town, people scurrying to get indoors.

Only in the garden is there shelter, near the fountain. An
angle of the house shuts off the strongest blasts.

I have ordered everyone to work. At least they appear busy.

While the wind howled, a tempest rose in me.

I woke during the night to fight it. Yet, there it was, that
perfect symmetry, stripped to the waist, brown caulking material in his hands.
I did not need to light a lamp. I had memorized his body. We were moving toward
the submerged city; I saw myself swimming beside him; in the water, he was
above me, then below me; then we were one, diving together.

I have fought other storms in my blood, and yet this one,
with the wind howling, the surf beating, threatens to overcome me. I have never
felt more deserted. Death and blindness have made my bed sterile.

Beauty, stay with me! I said.

Beauty said: Donât be afraid.

How shall I cope with this whirlwind? What does it know of
surfeit, satiety?

Iâm too old, compared to his twenty or twenty-two. He may
have a woman of his own, a country girl, a young, simple, laughing slip of a
thing who satisfies him.

In my dream I saw him at the prow of his boat, talking with
Kleis.

I should send her to Andros.

I need to go to Andros, myself!

I must seek Alcaeus...he must help me...

I see Phaon in his bed, his young arms, his young legs, his
close-cropped hair, blue eyes, smooth face.

Like a storm punishing the olives, love shakes me.

I must go to sleep.

Forget!

P

Another letter has reached me from Aesop. Still in Adelphi,
he writes he has been sick with fever.

âMy consolation is that I am sick for good reasons. I am
sick of men being mistreated. I am sick of injustice.

âAs you know, I have been more than a fly on a chariot
wheel. I have spoken out publicly and this has raised dust and stones. People
stare at me on the streets.

âI am sick of the aristocrats. I am sick of prejudice and
ignorance. There must be a better life.

âA free society...this is the most fabulous joke of all
time. The ones who rant loudest about it would run the farthest, were it to
happen.

âI may have to flee soon, back to Corinth, it seems. These
rulers here have friends. They know how to apply pressure.

âWrite me, Sappho. I need your sense of the gracious. Beauty
foremostâI wish I could think as you think.

âTell Alcaeus I send him my best, that I miss him...â

I took my letter to Alcaeus and read it aloud in his
library.

âIâm afraid it is serious this time,â I said.

âIt is always serious, when we speak out,â said Alcaeus,
laying his palms flat on the desk.

âHe says it is dangerous for him to come here.â

âHe must learn restraint!â

âAnd you, Alcaeus, do you think you have learned restraint?â

There was silence and then he said:

âThose of us who are free must speak, or there will be no
freedom, no free men left to restrain those who think in terms of chains.â

P

Sitting in the square the other day, I listened to Alcaeus
speaking, excited beÂ­cause he had taken cudgel in hand. Blind though he is, he
strikes an imposing figure, even majestic. Leaning on his cane, staring over
the townsmen who crowd the forum, he looks a pillar, his head shaggy, beard
glistening with oil, clothes immaculate.

Something about the day had a timeless quality, as though
none of it was old, the exorbitant taxes, the stringent laws, the situation of
the veteranâand the sea rolling, the gulls crying, the sun shining.

Pittakos has not shown any noticeable objection. Perhaps he
remembers the youthful champion, before the exile. Then, it was not easy to
ignore the charges against those in office, the outcries against âdrunkards,
thieves, bastards!â Now Pittakos nods and walks on his way, aware that a blind
man may be an excellent orator but no longer a soldier.

P

And recalling the years in exile, I knew how bitter Alcaeus
was. If there is less vehemence in his voice than before, there is also greater
conviction.

P

Aegean shells, beach shells,

shells in a womanâs hands,

shells in a childâs hands.

Underwater, fish glide

through a sunken ship,

passing huge wine jars,

a young Hermes,

sponges...coral...kelp...sharks.

A

lcaeus has taken back his former
secretary. I am glad for all our sakes: Alcaeusâ, Goguâs, mine. I hear they are
working hard. Now, when Thasos inquires at my door, I make excuses. They can
get along without me.

I keep hoping and waiting someone else will come to inquire,
will bring a message. Since he never looks for me, I must not look for him.

I will walk by the sea until I am too tired to move.

P

My pretty Gyrinno is sick with too much sun and too much
swimming so I go about pampering her and nothing pleases her more.

It has been some time since I brought her a tray, one I
fixed especially for her. I combed her hair tonight, cooled her skin with
ointment, and teased her till she made me promise a gift, a silver mirror from
Serfoâs shop, one with suitably naughty figures on the back and handle: âthe
convivialists,â Serfo has named it.

To help pamper Gyrinno, we had musicians in the courtyard.
The air was so warm, so languid, nobody wished to go to sleep. These were
wandering musiÂ­cians, from neighboring islands, and their songs were mostly new
to us. They repeated the ones we liked best, tender mountain airs.

Kleis, who has a phenomenal memory, was able to join them
the second or third time, harpist and flutist accompany. It was an intimate
evening, ending with a tale by one of the wanderers, of Pegasus winging over
the ocean on an errand of mercy for a lost lover.

Toward dawn, I woke to find Atthis with me, her cheek
against mine. More aware of my inner needs than others, she had come to comfort
me, alleviate my longing. Her perfume, kisses and caresses were not the crude,
male love I wanted. However, I was half in my dreams and I remembered the music
and the tale and the moonlight, our songs and voices, and everything blended
into a pattern of peace and goodness.

There are times when our hearts are particularly open to
beauty: this was one of those times. Everything, at this moment, assumed
perfection. And because we recognize its illusory quality it is the more
precious.

Out of the night comes the word someone has tried to
communicate, that we are plural, not single...not forgotten. Here, in this
comparison, are strength and courage.

Yes, there are times when our hearts open.

P

There is more to life than wandering over an island. There
is more to life than happiness. There is more to life than work. There is more
to life than hope. What is it?

Under a cypress, above the sea, facing the sea, I asked
myself this question and found this answer:

Certainly, the living is all: there is no life after death:
and since there is no other chance than this chance, it must be enough to have
beauty and kindness and time to enjoy them.

Here, on this slope, earthâs form assures me this is true.
And at home, among my girls, I can find it so, each girl an affirmation.

P

Why is Kleis involved in spats with Gyrinno, Helen, Myra?
Why are the girls put out with her? Why canât they agree to do the same thing
at the same time?

Why is there so much unrest and dissatisfaction everywhere?
Corinth, Sparta, Argos, Sicyon...the news reaches us by boat.

Why is Phaon far at sea, headed for Byzantium?

It seems to be a world of questions.

P

When I think how many gods exist, I am shocked by manâs
confusion and gullibility.

âMan is like a cricket. He sees the cricketâs limitations
but not his own. The cricket canât read or write or think scientifically. He
canât sail a boat or build a house. He potters away in his clod or field. What
can a cricket know about god?â

Thatâs what man says, unable to see beyond his own clod. He
scoffs and sneers but what is he but a two-legged cricket, brown, yellow or
black? Iâm sure the cricket has his illusions, some of them as pat as ours.

P

Charaxos has returned to Mytilene.

Our meeting was unavoidable, of course. He had on the
commonplace mask of the man in the street and talked about his trip, the
grinding poverty in Egypt, the bad state of our mercenaries there...

No mention of settling his debts! Not a word about Rhodopis!
Evidently Kleis does not exist.

âAll of us are well, thank you,â I said. âNothing has
changed for us here.â

What is there between us? It is something deeper than
ourselves. When I walked away, my eyes burned and my cheeks felt hot.

Here is a passage from my first journal, written in childish
hand:

Today is my birthday and mother gave me earrings and papa
gave me a brooch with a carnelian stone. We had a party on the beach and papa
burnt his fingers in the fire as we cooked the mutton meat. I donât like mutton
meat. I donât like smoky fires. Papa sings badly. My dog got sick.

I suppose all that was very important to me.

Is our life important to anyone else?

P

No word from Aesop.

P

Sometimes I have to get away from everything and everyone,
myself as well.

I went to a nearby fishing village. Necessity can be
ingenious. The fishermen have managed to build good boats out of the battered
wrecks that littered our shores. They tell me that the exporting of sponges has
become extensive.

I wish I could sail with a sponge crew. I went with a crew
once. Glued inside my decorum, I canât believe I was
free...wild...bold...headstrong...long ago.

Yes, I would like to cruise into deep blue water and stare
down, then to the sponge shallows and swim down, down.

P

My new book is ready.

It was interesting to visit the Kamen house and check the
copies.

I stopped for a moment in the alley to gaze at the sun
symbol painted over the house door. More and more, geometric designs are giving
way to more plasÂ­tic ideas in decorating. Polychrome painting seems to grow
more imaginative. Our ceramics are becoming more forceful. I thought of these
things as I looked at the sun symbol, done in blue and gold.

The Kamen brothers were, as always, mysterious, stiff, like
Egyptian clay long dried by the sun. It is too bad they canât apply some of
their art to themselves. They are such emaciated creatures, I wonder what they
eat?

Each waits for the other to speak; each scrapes, bows, tries
to efface himself. Tall, nut brown, with hair tied behind their necks, deer
skin aprons over faded clothes, they make me feel like an intruder.

As for my book, it is excellently made. The brothers are
perfectionists in their craft. To them, poetry is nothing. Do they read it at
all? However, the libraries will be pleased to receive these copies.

I am sure this is my best work.

P

Thousands of white herons flew over our island this morning,
making the sky a sky of motion. They flew almost all morning, flying toward the
mainland. I watched them from a bridge in town, leaning against the cool stone
rail, AnakÂ­toria watching with me, perplexed. Not a bird faltered. What
directed them? Not a sound, as they flew. Some of the townsmen gathered to stare,
dead silent. In tens and twenties, they flew over and onward, apparently at the
same speed. Twice the flocks covered the sun and our town darkened, tiled roofs
turning grey.

There were murmurs...

I remembered the herons as I tried to rest, wings and more
wings, bearing me away.

P

Sometimes, we troop to our old theatre, lost in its bowl of
cypress and overÂ­grown with grass and weeds, seats and benches crumbled. Laying
aside our clothes, we toss rover reeds, have a try at archery, play catch. Or
we race or go in for leap-frog or tug-of-war.

Little boys like to pester us and poke fun. Little boysâhow
delightful they can be.

If the day is sultry, we loll. Usually, the complaint is
âtoo much sun.â I used to think we needed lots of sun and exercise but now Iâm not
sure.

Lying on a moss-topped stone, time seemed to pause: I think
there is trouble brewing. I donât put it past Rhodopis to concoct something.
Even Kleis has been too alarmed to return to Charaxosâ house. Mallia has told
her to wait.

There has been a to-do because the ârightâ people did not
attend the homeÂ­coming party for Charaxos. What a pity! I know of no changes in
the life of Mytilene that required a unanimous celebration.

âWhy must there be bad feelings between their house and
ours?â Kleis has asked. âOf course I hate him for what he did to me.â

My knees trembled.

How explain life to one who has not lived it!

âYou could help me, if you wanted to,â she said.

Just like that!

I believe we only know what life gives us: can sound be
described to the deaf?

âAfter all, Charaxos is your brother,â she reminded me.

I wanted to say: He was, before all, not after all.

I can barely check my anger, angers, one on top the other,
too many for me to consider and come through sane.

As I went home, I saw a man beating his slave. The slave,
who has had eveÂ­rything taken from him, is being punished publicly for an
insignificant theft!

P

The situation is becoming impossible: Why has Charaxos
dragged Alcaeus into our quarrel?

I found them hurling insults at one another, Alcaeusâ house
and servants in an uproar. I hurried into the library and had to pound on the
door.

âI can thank you for this!â shouted Charaxos, the moment he
saw me.

âLeave, Sappho. I asked him to come and now Iâll have him
thrown out,â AlÂ­caeus bawled, lunging across the table.

âOur hero!â snorted Charaxos.

âEnough. Get out!â

âSuppose you and I have a private word elsewhere,â said
Charaxos to me, bitterly. âAs for you, old battle ax, Iâll settle with you
another time. Iâm sick of your trouble-making. Maybe one exile was not
enough...â

Quick as a flash, I slapped him. He eyed me grimly, then
turned and left.

Naturally, Alcaeus refused to tell me what the visit was
about.

All this is contemptible.

I can not forget the scene of the angry men, the threat.

Perhaps the next move had better be mine? Before my opponent
makes it a âcheckâ from which I canât escape...as they say in the new Persian
game.

P

My girls sense that I am troubled and try to distract me.

âNo work today!â cries Gyrinno.

âLetâs hunt flowers in the woods.â

Heptha bothers the cook to prepare me special delights.

Anaktoria dresses up a song, Helen and Gyrinno dance, Atthis
tries a musty joke.

It is a healing tempo...I am grateful...

These are lazy, summer days, the hammocks full, doves cooing
in the olives. I send my thoughts on a long trip: may they find Phaon and bring
him back to me.

P

This is theatre season and the talk is of actors and acting.
I like to familiarize myself with a play before attending its performance
because I can appreciate it much more. I never miss a play if I can help it,
whether comedy or tragedy, though I prefer comedy. But I think the âoffstageâ
is interesting, tooâthat is, if one can remain a spectator there. It is when we
become involved that we lose our theatre perspective.

Neglates, who used to be a leading actor in Athens, likes to
sit with me. He is our best critic. He is always urging me to write a play,
âsomething about us,â he says.

âThe theatre needs you. Why donât you try? We need new
blood.â

I suppose he is right. If we rely on the old writers
altogether, the stage will become stale. Perhaps I can think of something for
the religious festivals next year.

Theatre means meeting people I seldom see anywhere else. I
like the conÂ­tacts.

People feel sorry for Scandia because he is the father of
such a charming, marriageable daughter. White-faced, pinch-eyed, his neck
twisted by a boyhood accident, one arm danglingâwould they feel less sorry for
him, if his daughter were ugly?

Andros is the next thing to a dwarf in size. He has the face
of a twenty-year-old, although he must be well over fifty. He needs no oneâs
pityâonly some money! He is the best mask-maker our theatre has ever had.

P

Moonlight: Hand in hand,

Sappho and her daughter, Kleis,

walk along a path through hillside

olive groves, the ocean white below,

the murmur of waves part of their leisure and

sad conversation about Aesop.

Mytilene

642 B.C.

M

y heart is heavy... Aesop, my
friend, is dead.

He could have had a kinder messengerâit was Pittakos who
brought me the news.

âThe mob killed him for causing trouble in Adelphi,â he
said, his eyes cruelly cold. He had met me on the street, after a performance
of âThe Martyrs.â

Did he think this the right time to let me know? Was it a
warning?

I stared at him, as he shambled beside me. Then, before my
face could reveal too much, I lowered my veil and walked away, trembling, my
eyes unseeing.

I did not go home for a long time. I walked by the shore
until the ball of fire sank wearily into the dark water. The hills had a beaten
look, the sea an oppresÂ­sive flatness. A gullâs cry wept in me.
Alone...alone... I was much more alone.

Alone in my library, I opened the box Aesop had given me and
removed his fox, lion, donkey, raven and frog. He had moulded them for me. Two
were made of light-colored clay, others of dark. They were as highly glazed as
scarabs. I arranged them on a shelf above my desk and could feel my friendâs
presence, as though he were beside me.

But there would be no more letters.

No visit!

Lighting my lamp, I began my ode to âThe Friend of Man.â

P

I knew Alcaeus would be as disturbed as I.

I expected him to roar, âThe mob!â Instead, he bowed his
head, his hands on his lap, and remained silent. Slowly, he clenched his fists
and gouged them into his thighs. Muscles corded his arms and swelled as he
stood.

âHe should have come here, to us!â

âHe was sick, Alcaeus.â

âThen I should have gone to him! Why was I doubly blind? I
knew he was under attack for opposing the aristocrats.â

Round and round, back and forth, we talked: what might have
been, what should have been:

âIf he had gone to Athens, he would have been safe with
Solon.â

âIf only he could have stayed in Corinth...â

And remembering what a friend Aesop had been to us, he said:

âHe knew I liked bread from that oven of Stexos... He was
always bringing me my favorite wine.â

âHe couldnât do enough, that time I got so sick. The best
doctors, he...â

âWild boar, to help you get strong.â

We recounted the fables, their Persian origin, the
circumstances of their tellÂ­ing. How he loved travelers, especially from the
East.

I see Aesop on his balcony, the wind making him blink his
eyes; he has on dark blue trousers, yellow sash and gold blouse and carries his
doll and is smiling and nodding.

Was it his profound understanding of life that made such a
difference? He showed breadth of mind at all times. Revealing human character
through animal traits, he taught us the comedy of our faults and aspirations.

Alcaeus has begun writing letters, to protest against this
outrage in Adelphi, to alert friends, to cry out.

P

High on a hill, I sit and stare at my bare feet and try to
guess how many steps they have taken.

I peer at my legs and consider the color and texture of my
skin. I rub my hands over my knees and ankles.

What of Phaonâs feet, the rigging they have climbed and the
decks they have walked?

Storms have crashed over him. He has held his ship to sun
and stars, legs spread wide, feet on the planking.

Does the sea mean so much to him? Is it his woman?

As I watch the arrival of boats in the bay, the unloading at
the dock, I keep remembering his brown face.

P

The rains have begun.

They flood across the mosaic floor of the courtyard,
draining noisily.

I am weaving a scarf, very white, light in weight, my seat a
strip of rawhide on four pegs.

Around me the girls sit and chatter. Heptha and Myra weave
together, workÂ­ing at one loom, whispering. The rain and wind come together
over the house. Laughing secretly, Atthis and Gyrinno dash off, padding through
the rain, across the court.

Kleis unwinds my ball of thread and keeps paying it out
slowly, rhythmically, her hands in time to a song she is humming to herself.

The white wool is restful. I can weave nothingness or I can
weave in my whole past, the sea, my house, the cliffs, the trees.

My fingers are Phaonâs.

P

I have not changed my motherâs house since she died because
change is no friend of mine. Occasionally, I have had to repair or refinish a
table, and a chair or picture, but were mama to return tomorrow she would feel
at home.

I often think that I will meet her, as I go from one room to
another, mama gliding softly, smiling, holding out her warm hands to me...we
would sit and weave by the window, the sea beyond, our voices low. With our
terra-cotta lamps gleaming, we would talk until late, too sleepy to chat any
longer.

I canât remember my father, he died so young. His lineage,
extending to Agamemnon, frightens me: That inheritance must carry into these
thick walls and the glazed tilesâa strong house.

Mama gave me his royal flute, said to be carved from a
bullâs leg, but it has been years since I have taken it from its silk-lined
box. Its sickly color never pleased me.

Its music comes to me sometimes: mountain vagaries, war
music, sea songs, fragments of a day I can never know.

A bat coasts through my open windows.

Is there a better hour than dusk?

I feel that life is infinitely precious at such an hour,
that sordidness and decay are lies. It is the hour when we cross the threshold
of starlight.

Sometimes, before dropping asleep, I long to see Olympus, as
part of this general dream:

Never is it swept by the winds nor touched by snow,

a purer air surrounds it, a white clarity envelops it,

and the gods there taste of happiness that lasts forever...

P

It has been a dreadful ordeal. I can hardly describe the
events of this past fortnight.

I had barely recovered from the shock of Aesopâs death, when
word came that Alcaeus had been attacked.

I had gone to a friendâs home and we had been chatting on
the sea-terrace, when children burst in with the alarming news. I hurried with
them to Alcaeus, the boys distressing me with their fantasies.

I found Alcaeus in bed, severely bruised and cut, with
Thasos in attendance.

âIt was Charaxos,â Thasos said, quietly.

I must have gasped. I could not speak.

âI was alone...wandering,â Alcaeus explained, then turned
his face to the wall.

And I dared to hope that Charaxos would come to his senses!
I pressed my lips to Alcaeusâ hand.

âIâll get Libus,â I said.

âSomeone has already gone for him,â said Thasos.

Libus, too, was shocked: he ordered the servants to bring
Theodorus, another doctor.

As the news spread through town, people gathered in the
street in front of Alcaeusâ house, angry townsmen, yelling about Charaxos,
calling on Pittakos for justice.

During the night, a mob threatened Charaxosâ home, and in
the morning, they stoned the place, battering shutters, screaming and demanding
justice.

Pittakos sent soldiers to maintain order but the soldiers
sided with the mob, forcing the doors, smashing furniture and chasing away the
servants.

Sometime during the day, Charaxos and Rhodopis fled in one
of their wine boats, heading for the mainland. I understand there was a fracas
in the square, some wanting to overtake the ship.

For two days, I did not leave Alcaeusâ home, taking turns at
his side. In that circle of close friends, death pushed us hard, trying to
break through.

Finally, Libus, more lean-faced and pallid than usual, from
his sleepless nights and responsibility, drew me aside:

âHeâs going to pull through. You can go home and rest. Trust
me...â

I slept and dreamed and came back and the days went like
that before AlÂ­caeus was out of danger, and we cheered him on the road to
recovery.

Pittakos and some of his officials visited him, expressing
their regrets, saying a committee had called, demanding Charaxosâ punishment. I
kept out of the room, leaving Alcaeus and Libus to handle the situation.

âOur tyrant sides with me!â Alcaeus chortled after they had
gone. âIâve won!â

It is a poor victory: we have not won back our years of
exile. But, for the citiÂ­zenry, this is something on the side of justice and
worth talking about.

For my part, I suspect that Charaxos will return presently,
unmolested. He is too important to our local welfare, employing too many, to be
brushed aside. When his boat anchors, Pittakos will fine him lightly. By then,
sentiment will have cooled.

Justice is rightly placed among the stars.

P

On my next visit to Alcaeus, I took my clay animals and
placed them in his hands, describing each, one by one. He felt them
carefullyâtoo slowlyâa sad expression on his face.

âSo Aesop made them?â he said. âItâs good you have
them...proof that his world is still here. I wish I could remember his...his
faith...â

Taking the figures from Alcaeus, I put them on a table
between us: we three had sat at a table like this, in exile, planning,
planning: those worries swept back again, distorted. Confused, I could feel
myself trapped. I knew that in those eyes opposite me, death sat there, at
least a part of death, the same death that was in those clay animals.

Our hands met across the table.

P

Villa Poseidon

It is useless to cross-examine Alcaeus. He will not discuss
Charaxos.

âHere, do me a favor, read me something from Hesiod,â he
says, and hands me the poetâs advice to his brother.

How history repeats itself! Family problems havenât changed:
this is an earlier Charaxos, who bribed judges to deprive Hesiod of his
inheritance.

If I did not know better, I could almost believe Charaxos
had used this story for his model.

As time goes on, I feel the stigma of our relationship more
and more. How can I be his sister?

Despite the liberality of our views, I am astonished that
Alcaeus respects and trusts me. I canât shake my guilt: the fact that Charaxos
has cheated and betrayed me does not exonerate me of blame. I am tired of all
this. It is a confusion I canât accept indefinitely.

P

Phaonâs ship has anchored in the harbor.

I have remained in my room throughout the day.

I have enjoyed the detail from my frescoâEtruscan girl
strewing flowers, hair streaming over her shoulders, face filled with joy, arms
outspread.

I am like that girl.

P

I took Exekias. As oldest member of my household, I feel she
is the best chaperone. In her crumpled face there is more than Assyrian placidity:
she has known me longest and is sympathetic and discreet: she says things the
way my mother said them, so warmly I canât forget.

We left the house early, our scarves about our heads, women
sweeping doorways and steps, sprinkling the dusty street, cleaning where horses
and cattle had passed. Birds sickled from the eaves, dogs and horses drank at a
watering trough, nuzzling moss, rubbing gnats, their hairy comradeship obvious
in roll of eyes.

We had not been in the market long when I saw him, alongside
a stall with a sailor, both drinking coconuts, shaking them, holding them up,
tipping them, draining the juice, laughing. They had on shorts and were brown,
incredible ocean brown.

Then Phaon saw me. Hurriedly, he set down the coconut and
left the stall and came toward me, smiling, wiping his fingers on his shorts.
In the way he spoke, in the way he stood, I sensed how he had missed me, other
tell-tales in his voice and hands. And I knew, as we talked, that he sensed my
longing as well: it brought us closer that we made no secret of our feelings.

A parrot jabbered atop its cage and a monkey squealed and
battered at its bronze ring, until its owner brought bananas. People crowded
us, elbowing with baskets of fruit and shrimp. Phaon and I walked under
palm-ceilinged aisles, dust sifting around us, light finning through stalls,
over herbs, nuts, wines and cheeses...the smells made me hungry. Together we
ate Cappian cheese, tangy to tongue and nose.

âIt never tasted better out at sea,â he said.

âI hope everything tastes better now.â

âIt does...yes, Iâm home again!â

Exekias ghosted behind me, face alert, her hands pushing me
along; so we moved, past the pottery lads, one of them glazing a bowl between
his calloused knees, the color as bright as the sliced oranges beside him ready
for eating.

âDo you suppose you and I can sail again?â he asked, as we
watched, seeing ourselves instead of the pottery boys. âThere should be
time...soon...when Iâm unloaded.â

I caught his half question, half statement.

âIf I were invited, Iâd consider.â

My teasing brought a flash from him and laughter and he
moved back a little, nodding agreeably.

As I walked home, I felt that my mind had been invaded by
everything around me. I tried to hurry, thinking Iâd remember all, the prices
of the traders, the baskets of starfish, the white parrot; Iâll remember his
voice, his feet in the dust, his smiles.

Exekias babbled dully about food and flagrant cheating, her
basket bumping my hip. I wondered how I could wait, through the days ahead, how
could I ocÂ­cupy myself, until Phaon and I sailed? It was a question for water
clocks and gulls, spindrift and wind, thought unfolding in my room, scudding
across the floor to the window, stopping there, leaping out, to other lands,
other times, backlashing with the net that contains yesterday...flames in a
cruse...Atthis, slipÂ­ping her perfumed hands over my eyes...

P

My lips burn, my hands are moist, I feel faint... Is that my
voice, the sound of my laughter? Am I walking over these tiles?

Did I have supper last night? Drink? Rehearse a song?

My girls realize I am lostâwandering. I canât look into
their eyes for long. When I see Kleis cross the room a trickle of ice slips
down my back.

What if he finds me too old, what if my love doesnât please
him...if he mocks me, or stands in awe, or wants to amuse himself?

Phaon...

I see you against every wall, against the sky, in the dark,
in the sun under the trees. My flesh aches, my arms melt. Never has passion
fermented so strongly in me.

Yet no messenger comes.

I canât bear the nights, to lie alone, to feel my breath on
my pillow, feel the cool sheet.

In the morning, I ask Exekias questions, just to hear her
voice, not listening, for how can she know whether he has forgotten me or is
afraid or sick?

He is busy with his boat and port affairs. He has gone to
visit his sister, with no thought of returning soon. He has sailed. He talks
with his menâcoarse talks. He eats, drinks, works, sleeps, snores.

Noâhe is fixing our boat for our trip.

No, he has many sweethearts, dark, tall, frivolous, lusty,
daringâall young.

Why do I punish myself?

I hurt with weariness and desire. I will simply face the
bedroom wall and shut out the light. No, I will concentrate on my work. What
shall I write about?

P

Where is the sea that we sailed?

Was it a long trip?

Was our sail grey or brown?

Was the water rough?

The answers mean so little. Born of the sea, where is love
more beautiful than on the sea? Like water, light, warm, swaying, the
indispensable ingredient, the transformations, the necessities, the luxury,
with the whites of the waves whiter than salt, with gulls flashing in the sun,
with the bow of the boat swingÂ­ing.

We swam, dove, played, laughed. There was bread soaked in
honey and nuts dipped in wine and fruit, whose peelings we tossed to the birds.
There was the creaking of the sail for our silences, the long brown tiller arm
reaching to the sun, his hands on my shoulders.

He padded the bottom of the boat and we lay there, the wind
heeling us briefly, the water sucking and his mouth sucking mine and the hunger
of his bodyâthe hunger I knew no sea could satisfy. Cradled, we talked softly:

âWas your trip good?â

âWe had good weather for several days, then storms... Itâs
like that, you know, most every trip. I try to keep far away from the coast, to
avoid shifting winds. I keep farther away than most sailors. It shortens the
trip...â

âYouâre not afraid?â

âNo.â

âWhen will you be leaving?â

âI have no cargo.â

âStay...Phaon...â

We had supper and I hated the food that kept us from our
love-making.

A sponge lay on the floor and he dipped water over me as the
sun washed over us, sinking rapidly. Why couldnât it stay for us? I saw him as
Cretan, as Babylonian, as Persian, inventing his lineage. His atavistic hands
moved certainly, oarsmanâs hands, netmanâs hands, the seaâs...mine.

Nothingâs more rhythmic than love with waves for bed,
rocking, sucking, soothing. I lay there in his arms, thinking of the plants
below, the glassy window of the water, the fish, coral, ruined cities...the
lovers of other days, the mother of us all, love, pulsing in the rigging, in
the pull of his legs, the hasp of his fingers. The rollers were kind to us,
never too violent yet tingling the blood. The backs of waves looked at us. The
spray spilled salt on our skin, gulls screaming.

We made love again, better than before, this time under the
moon, our bodÂ­ies wet from swimming, the summer night blowing over us, bringing
us closer to shore where the surf boomed. Moonlight ignited inside the water
and phosphoÂ­rescence added to the brilliance. Flying fish sprang free. His body
was so dark, mine so white...la, the rough of him!

Were any other lovers as happy that day?

As we stretched side by side, he said, with sleepy tongue:

âI remember an evening like this, a night of
phosphorescence. I was lying on the deck, almost asleep. A flash tore the sky,
silver light...it came streaking nearer and nearer. I woke some of my sailors.
My helmsman shouted. We pointed and argued. The light hit the water and sent up
boiling steam. We smelled something. Stripping, I swam where the light had hit
the water. We were becalmed and I thought I had seen something white but found
only dead fish, their bellies shinÂ­ing. The largest one filled my arms and I
swam back to the boat and hauled it aboard. It had a brand across one side. We
argued, and threw it back.â

âWhat was it that fell?â I asked.

âSome said it was a star,â he said.

P

Â âI was born in Pyrgos,â Phaon tells me, his head on my lap.
âI was born in a terrible thunderstorm, in my fatherâs hut. He was a very
clever fisherman but there were times when we got very hungry and on one of
those times we waded out to sea, he and I, to throw a net...we were hungry. I
wasnât helping much but I was there, small, perhaps learning something. Ah,
that little island was barren and poor. And there I was in the water, the sun
coming out of the sea, blinding me. And then my father screamed and I saw him
fall. I tried to reach him. I splashed. I ran. I fell. I shouted. We were
alone, we two. My father was thrashing about. It seems he had fallen into a
pool, a rock pool, you know what they are. Maybe he forgot it was there, or
didnât know. I canât say. But he had been hit by a shark and was bleeding. So I
helped him, as best I could, both of us splashing, falling, the surf rising
around us, big. He fell on the beach and I ran for help but before I could find
help and come to him he had bled to death, on the sand, his hands on his wound,
the wound from the shark.â

P

We went up the mountain, to the outcrop and the temple,
spent all day alone, the sheep tinkling their bells, the heat steady. He knew
of a spring unknown to me and a hollow olive where bees had a hive. Only deep
in the olive grove was it cooler and we buried ourselves under the trees.

The watery brown of his body was mine. I found his voice
deeper than I had thought. I found his mouth. Discoveries went on, nothing
repetitive, the wind, no, the olive shade, or the moss and mushrooms. Crushing
a mushroom he rubbed it against his thighs. The smell of mushroom in the cool, dark
place! His smell and mine; the smell of earth: life was a vortex of fragrances,
peace on the fringes, then a shepherdâs bell!

âIâve wanted to be a shepherd,â I said.

âIt would be too lonely for me,â he said. âItâs lonely
enough at sea. I look for a sign of land, a strip of floating bark, land bird
or turtle. I look...there at the bow Iâm always looking...now it will be you,
ahead, in the sea. At sea I have my crew...no, I couldnât be a shepherd. But
you?â

âFor me, Iâd have more time to think, to write, to gather
the world of stillÂ­ness. I could weave it into a pattern weâd recognize as
important: succor, inspiÂ­ration, hope. There is a cliff...you know it... the
Leucadian cliff... Iâd go there with my flock and dream as they fed about me,
the sea below us, the murmur of antiquity around us.

P

It wasnât easy to visit Alcaeus and hear him talk, as he
reclined at supper, his hands close to a lighted lamp, restless fingers,
perturbed in a blunted way: the tensility of the battlefield gone from them:
moving, they move in on themselves.

âSometimes, I want to see a face...your face, Sappho. I want
to see many faces, the faces of my men. Iâd like to see a helmet and plume, the
scarlet horseÂ­hair plume...color...what a great thing...

âMy house has no window or door. Who wants a house that way?

âWhat of other blind men and their darkness! What good can
that darkness do them?

âWhen my father was small he was scared of the dark. I never
was. But this dark has become fear...words canât break it. Only sleep breaks
it. When Iâm lying in bed, on the verge of waking, I think, remembering the old
light, I think, the sunâs up. But whereâs the sun!â

Someone had dusted his shields and spears on the wall: I
noticed the black point of an Egyptian lance, the cold grey pennons on a Persian
hide: perhaps they had decorated the sand outside his tent.

This contrast troubled me and yet I longed to share my
happiness: the child in me wanted to discountenance reason: the brown shoulders
and rolling sea never left me as we talked and I tried to comfort, reminding
him of days when it was fun to climb the hills and explore the beaches, fun all
day: he admitted there had been time without pain and wondered why we were
eventually cheated?

Fog leaned against the house and I described it and he asked
me to walk with him. As we followed the shore, he talked of warriors he had
know, âstrategists,â he called them; he boomed his words, excited by memories
and the walk and the fog, which he could feel on his face and hands. His cane
cracked against driftÂ­wood and I restrained him, to find his hands trembling.

P

The blue of the Aegean is reflected

in the faces of the 50 rowers of the trireme

as they chant and pull;

the blue is reflected on the shipâs hull

Â and the banks of oars.

P

haon and I were offshore in his
rowboat, the small sail furled, the surf near by, doubling into smooth green,
sunset brazing the horiÂ­zon. We had been gay, drifting, oar dragging, taking
chances with the surf. Upright at the stern, Phaon looked about idly: we had
been talking about going for a swim. Suddenly, he faced me and shouted:

âOver there...see them...pirate boats!â

âWhat?â

âOver there, the other way...those three boats...see the red
shields at the bow...Turkish pirates...theyâre attacking Mytilene. Iâll row for
the beach. Hang on.â

His oar splashed and the boat pitched; pulling with all his
strength, he drove us toward the shore, the surf rising, the bow high. I
thought we would capsize but before I could make out the pirate ships he
beached us and we scrambled ashore, drenched and shoeless. Together, we raced
for the square, shouting at everyone we met. Together, we dashed for Alcaeusâ
house, and threw open his door.

Men in gold, red and blue uniforms stormed our dock and
invaded the town. I hung on, behind shutters, unable to tear myself away as the
armed gang rushed past the house, forty or more, most of them yelling, one of
them, in silver turÂ­ban, whistling through his fingers, brandishing a scimitar.
My mother had deÂ­scribed such an attack...I could hear her and see her pained
face...a terrible story I had never quite believed.

Phaon yanked shields and spears off the wall and armed
Thasos and another man I scarcely knew, a visitor. Women and children hollered
and scuttled inside, making for the rear of the house. Something crashed
against our street door and men bellowed wildly at us. I saw wood rip the door.
Thasos moved in front of me, urging me to hide. Phaon, with shield and sword,
his clothes still sopping, threw open the door and beat off a Turkish spear.
Catching two men by surprise, he wounded one in the neck and both fled, the
uninjured man, a youngster, helping the other one, his shoulder turning red,
their short swords rapping their legs as they ran. The injured man lost his
turban as they rounded a corner...

âWhat happened...Whatâs going on?â bellowed Alcaeus, behind
Thasos.

âTurks,â Phaon shouted, checking the damage to the door,
swinging it on its hinges, his hairy shield high on his arm.

Long after dusk, men scouted the streets, all the Turkish
boats at sea: the town buzzed with shouts and whistles: a drum throbbed: the
raiders had killed two and injured several and plundered a winery and mill,
removing flour and filling goat skins with fresh water at several fountains. I
piloted Alcaeus about for a while, until my girls discovered me and begged me
home, dreading a repetition, though by now armed soldiers had set up guards.

Stars shone brilliantly.

The bay, mirror-smooth, seemed utterly innocent of piracy
and death. It acÂ­cused us of our own folly.

Alone in my room, I reviewed the raid, our floundering
ashore, our dash to Alcaeusâ house, the brilliant uniforms, wild faces, wild
cries, Phaon at the door, Thasos wanting me to hide, children whimpering.

The drummers were signaling each other, the surf sullen, the
wind rising.

In a room near me, someone was sobbing. Peace would not
return to my house or Mytilene for a while: how long, I wondered? Peace, how
frail it is, how carefully it must be protected.

I realized I should comfort my girls and not sit and watch
the ocean. It was hard to go to them, harder still to listen to their fears and
accusations. When they questioned me I felt that what I described had never
happened or happened to someone else. Atthis, holding a puppy in her arms, said
she wanted someone to protect her and burst into tears, realizing how
unprotected she had been.

Why hadnât I come with Phaon? What if the Turks had climbed
the hill?

âYou forgot all about us, you just left us here! Oh,
Sappho!â

P

Next day, with my house quieted, I had time to write:

Accomplishments require sacrifice of mind and body; for
some, accomplishÂ­ment will be slow as the sea eating sand. I prefer the swift
attainmentâit is most inspiring. Death, because it is an incessant threat,
retards progress, inhibiting our will to succeed, seeping under us at
unexpected moments.

Surely, if we are to conspire against death, if we are to
get the most of life, we must be clever, relying on intuition and knowledge, to
reach any goal. Surely, the most important element in life is the humane, the
kindly, the uncorrupted, tying together little things into something worth
while, that will have significance now and later.

Then, what is love? Isnât it sharing a personality never
encountered before? I think it is this kind of interchange and it is exploring
someoneâs thinking, with and without words. With Phaon, it is sharing the sea,
the oarsmanâs hands, the swimmerâs legs, yarns on the beach in the firelight.
With Alcaeus, it has been our friends, our families, our town, our writing, our
exileâyears of knowing each other. The differences between Phaon and Alcaeus
are so many it would be foolish to try to list them. Comparison gets me
nowhere.

I suspect that love is too subtle for any analysis: love is
so subtle it escapes while we look. Being in love is rather like being someone
else, laughing someÂ­oneâs laughter, tasting someoneâs wine, dreaming someoneâs
dreams. I feel that close to Phaon. Together, we share the fire, the fire that
wakes us in the night, that flies into our eyes, the fire that makes my mouth
tremble, that makes me laugh in my mirror, that makes me test my perfume
bottles and sends my girls for new powder.

I steal to himâwith dignity. I crush him to me, dignity
gone. I lose, I gain. I cringe, I lunge. Phaon, you are my body, in me, wanting
you, wanting... We are the wanters, haters of nights that keep us apart, haters
of time.

Its roaring deafens me: I, I didnât hear you. I, I was
wrapped in thought. I was making love...I was reliving the sea, I was in the
boat. I was planning our next meeting...I was singing... Darling, I was saying.

P

Riding donkeys, Phaon and I set out across the island, to
visit his sister, riding all day in slow stages, to reach her hut and sleep
there. I thought we would never find it, but that was my thinking. Phaon led us
through a jumble of hillside rocks, through little valleys, right to her door,
a hut of rocks and straw, her shepherdâs crook beside the door.

Kleis is so unlike my Kleis.

She seems able to speak without words, perhaps because words
are not very useful to her since she lives alone. She nods and smiles, her
smile serene. Small, dark, light-boned, she appears out of the past, no sister
of Phaon, unrelated to our island. I had not expected her to be so unlike us.
Using her particular mysÂ­tery, she made us comfortable, made us feel at home, a
gesture now and then, a word, some roasted seeds, another word, as we talked.
Her delight in having us was obvious, coming from deep inside. She has
wonderful wind-swept sight, from the rapture of lonely skies, her communions.
She is priestess of self-contained youth. She shared her food and we shared
things we had brought. Phaon talked of his sea trip, the Mytilene raid, his
voice in accord with her qualÂ­ity.

As our relationship deepens, I am more and more aware of his
quality. It is best seen in his slow, slow gesture. Or in a spontaneous grin
ending in a chuckle. It is in his carriageâhis calculating look. His qualities
are older than mine, seaÂ­soned by the primordial: his speech is older, in
vocabulary, accent, intonation.

Kleis and I sang after supper, the supper fire burning.

Her sheep were near us, muffled, shuffling contentedly.

Venus hung over us.

How unlike my Kleis, in her singing and her songs: her songs
are songs mother knew: they made me tremble and I wanted to clasp her to me:
Phaon had forgotten most of them but joined us sometimes. We sang of lovers and
wanderers.

She, the daily wanderer, was less a wanderer than any of us:
her natural reÂ­sources were always at her spiritual command.

Kissing me good night, she said:

âI love you for coming.â

Going back home, we poked along, talking and resting at
likely places. We stopped in an orange grove to eat, water rippling by us in an
irrigation ditch. Cross-legged we ate cheese and dates and drank wine Kleis had
given us, the summer smells around us, flowers, so many kinds of flowers in
this place. Lying beside me, Phaon told me more about his life:

â...We met a storm off the Egyptian coast, the wind rushing
us, tearing our sail. I was at the rudder when the sail split. I ordered my men
to huddle in the lee and mend the sail. How we shipped water. The bow crashed.
All of us thought weâd go down but they kept on with the mending, folding the
fabric, squeezing out the water, wiping rain and spray from their faces. Iâve
never heard a fiercer wind, raging off starboard...

âWhen we had the sail mended I had someone take the rudder
and helped hoist. A wave bowled us over. It was nearly dark and the rain
slanted toward me. Out of the side of my eyes, I thought I saw something on the
sea, a man, a tall man. I said nothing but worked hard: I couldnât talk or yell
in that sea. Part way up the mast, I looked down. Nothing. In spite of wind and
rain, we hung our sail and swung out of the troughs. Back at the rudder, I saw
him, saw him moving, white, tall, through the whipped tops of the rollers.â

P

Villa Poseidon

641 B.C.

My girls still carry on about the pirate raid.

Gyrinno found a short sword and brought it to me.

âLook, I showed it to Archidemus and he says itâs from the
Turks. Those are rubies on the hilt, he says. Feel them. See...see...â

Her fingers tremble with excitement.

Her breath catches:

âWhat if theyâd broken into our house? It would have been
awful. Arenât you proud of Phaon?â

The whole misadventure leaves me cold. I think of the burial
of our dead. I see the blood rushing down the neck of the wounded man. There
was blood on Phaonâs sword. He and Alcaeus had bellowed over their victory.
Victory?

I pushed away the pirateâs sword, and said: âIt would be
better if there were no pirates.â

Gyrinno is disgusted.

What is wrong with man? Is manâs piratical weakness an
instinct? Women donât go in for piracy. We know the value of living and
appreciate lifeâs perilousÂ­ness. We give birth to kindness...each baby is
kindness itself.

I
have forbidden Gyrinno to keep the sword: she must get rid of it, give it away,
throw it away, I donât care.

P

Rain, rain, rain.

The girls appreciate my happiness since a sense of grace
envelops me.

We weave and the rain falls, so gently, our looms fronting
the windows and sea. I am weaving a white scarf, quite blemishless.

Weaving has always been the most delightful pastime: I sit
and weave and the wool goes in and out: I can see nothing in front of me or I
can see my whole past, or tomorrow, or Phaon, the ocean, my house, the faces of
my girls...

I work silently sometimes, planning, composing. The art of
weaving thoughts must have begun with the loom. The rain falls, and weaves its
sounds. Atthis and Anaktoria sit on either side of me, Anaktoria singing to
herself. She is dressed in white and Atthis wears blue.

Across the sea a wedge of rain scuds, slowly approaching our
island. ShepÂ­herds are in their huts. Seamen are ashore. It is a time for all
to rest.

P

At the bridge in town where I had watched the migratory
flight of herons, I met Alcaeus. He was perched on the rail, cane crossed over
his legs, waiting for Thasos. Glad to see me, he pulled his beard, fragrant and
carefully oiled. I found him cheerful. He talked about a Carthaginian ship, in
harbor because of broken oars, after sideswiping another boat in a thick fog.
As I listened his face altered: it was as if he were in pain or remembered
something tragic. Interrupting my comment, he asked:

âWhatâs he like? Is he tall, this Phaon?â

I described him, touching his arm to lessen his resentment.

âSo...heâs not the soldier type!â

âMust he be?â

âNo...a sailor, then!â

âAlcaeus!â

âI know...I know...the changes that have overcome me. I know
them better than you.â

âAnd I know my changes.â

âMust our friendship end?â

âAlcaeus, letâs not go on like this. We understand each
other.â

âYes...yes...of course. I apologize... I should have scorned
the war. Why was I bellicose?

âI could have kept to my books. I understand it takes
infinite time to probe, time to evaluate, time to mature. I have always wanted
skillâlike yours, working, as you work, through intuition and knowledge of the
past. By probing I could have come closer to freedom.â

âYou have found your freedom,â I said.

âWhere?â

âAttacking Pittakos, and his sort.â

âThatâs another kind.â

âI realize that.â

As we strolled home, Thasos with us, he kept thinking,
elaborating. SomeÂ­thing hurt in me. Wasnât I deluding him? Was there freedom?
When he stumÂ­bled, I stumbled.

He had been my Phaon. I thought of his encouragement, years
ago, when each of us was desperate. That encouragement, that will to help,
buoyed me and, talking swiftly, I promised him help, promised closer
friendship.

Standing at his door, leaning on his cane, eyelids closed,
he recited something heroic and it was my turn to change: my expression must
have altered as quickly as his: his sincerity was an answer to mine: I knew he
could not see and yet hid my face in my arm. Walking on, I felt he was still in
his doorway, trying to see me, trying to understand.

A boy, with a yo-yo, asked me to stop and watch him perform
tricks:

âSappho...I can make it do things,â he cried, dangling his
yo-yo over my sanÂ­dal, climbing it up my robe.

Sparkling eyes laughed and I bent and kissed him.

P

Yesterday, Anaktoria and I walked to a vineyard above the
bay, a yard of crumbling walls, twisted, neglected vines, where bees hummed and
swallows flicked apricot bellies. It was unduly warm and we threw off our
clothes and lay on old leaves, in the shadow of a wall, the waves grumbling
behind the stones, coming up, as it were, through masonry and ground.

I noticed her hand in the grass. I noticed my own. It seemed
anotherâs hand. The grass altered its identity. I felt my naked knee, pressing
a stone: it seemed another knee although I felt the stone. I thought: nature
tries to claim us before we are aware, before we are willing to let her. Swift,
she likes to confuse, preÂ­paratory to that eternal grasp of hers.

Crickets piped under the wall, asking for cooler weather.
Abruptly, they stopped, perhaps to listen to Anaktoriaâs singing. She sang
until I fell asleep, to wake and find her sleeping, hands cupped over her
breasts, afraid the bees might sting them. The wallâs shadow had lengthened and
birds were quarreling. SumÂ­merâs integrity stretched from vineyard to horizon.

I thought about the two of us, our fragility, neither of us
marred: sometimes, when someone is loving me, I am especially glad I have an
unblemished body: I know my lover will have something to remember.

The ring Libus gave her glistens on her little finger.

P

Deeper, deeperâour love goes deeper, taking us completely;
the early lamps sputter out; the stars gleam in the windows; there is talk of
leaving, another trip to sea. But we shake off impending loss with each otherâs
hunger; he says, your perfume stays on me; I say, the smell of you stays on me.
He says, come closer, farther under. I say, I canât, Iâm stifled, Iâm
submerged. Oh, impetuous lips. The depth of having someone your own, the depth
of being the heart for someone. Phaon...the name, the body, the breath on my
neck, special ways, his weight underneath me, supporting me, the sea coming
through the windows.

There is nothing better than love.

O Beauty, you know I love him because he is the way I want
him to be, you know he is kind...care for him!

P

A man speaks before the Acropolis in the moonlight:

âStranger, you have come to the most beautiful place on earth,

the land of swift horses, where the nightingale sings

its melodies among the sacred foliage,

sheltered from the sunâs fire and the winterâs cold.

Here Bacchus wanders with his nymphs, his divine maidens;

and under the heavenly dew forever flourishes the narcissus,

the crown of great goddesses...â

Mytilene

I

Â have not seen Phaon for days and
I feel eaten by rust, the rust that consumes bronze. I feel myself flake
between my own fingers. Nothing distracts me. I tell myself I have no right to
such feelings; it is wrong: be aware of the beauty around you, I say.

I have always believed that those who live beside the ocean
should know more about beauty than others. Their minds should be richer, their
faces kinder, their stride freer. Rhythm should be their secret.

I know this is false but I must evoke beauty. I must capture
the magnificence of the sea and use its power. I must trap changes and
repetitions, the stormâs core and summerâs laziness. There is superiority in
these things, to help us through life.

But, with Phaon away, few things come alive: I am seaweed
after the gale. Husk, why trouble others? So, I sulk. Or, when my girls insist,
I revive briefly.

When will the atavistic fingers come and when will I smell
the cabinâs wick and the nets? Oh, drown me, Egyptian lion, Etruscan
charioteer, lunge and shield: yours is the tyranny.

Surely feminine love is kinder, less responsible, graced
with evasions. MascuÂ­line love is a beginning, an intensity that goes on.
Masculine love pushes into the future, asking roots, a thread of continuity.

. . .

Last night, Phaon took me among terra-cotta lamps, their
wicks flaming coldly. Perspiration glowed on our bodies. A cat jumped on our
bed and Phaon pushed it away: wind rustled: leaves shook: flames swayed: this
was the love I had wanted and I accepted it and made it live: no little girlâs
love, mine was gloÂ­rious, damning all loneliness, knowing he would be gone
again.

P

A dried flying fish revolved on a string above Phaonâs cabin
door. His boat rose on a gradual swell, seemed unwilling to glide down.

âLet me sail with you when you sail next time,â I said.

âHow could I take care of you?â

âRight in this cabin.â

âWould you sleep on the floor?â

âWhy not?â

âWhat about food? Food goes bad...our cheese spoils...our
meat...our water. Sometimes we canât land a fish.â

A smile wrinkled his face, as he hulked against the cabin
wall, his smile vaguely reassuring.

âWhat about the heat and cold?â he went on.

âI was hungry and cold in exile.â

âThat was...years ago.â

The flying fish spun, and I thought about time. Had so many
years lapsed? I said no more. He had silenced me effectively for I could not
endure those proÂ­longed trials and no doubt the sea voyage was impossible:
luxury had softened me. The spinning fish would have horrified Atthis. And was
I very different?

But we sailed along our coast, hugging it, unloading fruit,
getting away from the windless heat of Mytilene, selling dates, lemons and
limes. As we sailed in a faint wind, the crew sang. Lolling under an awning, I
heard stories of catches at the deeps just beyond us, deeps where the water
shimmered flatly, as if of rock. One crewman, not much bigger than a monkey,
dove for shells while we crept through shallows. Pink shell in hand, treading a
wave nakedly, he offered me his prize, as I leaned over the side. Kelp floated
around him and tiny blue fish darted in and out, under his legs and arms, angel
fish lower down, perhaps frightened.

While the monkey-man dove for shells, youngsters swam from
small boats, hailing us, boarding us, some bringing fish as gifts. A blond, husky
body, his shoulders thickly oiled, shared an orange with a girl who had his
oval face and fair skin: twins, I thought, and went to the stern to talk to
them, comparing their arms and legs, their features and hair. The flock of
youngsters cluttering our desk found us amusing and laughed at us.

The twins talked about a wrecked ship, âfrom a strange
land...you can see her at dawn, when the waterâs quiet...she has a sunken deck,
a huge rudder turned by chains. A great red and gold beast is carved over the stern...â

As we shared our oranges, juice trickled between her
breasts.

Someone shouted and there was more laughter, and, as if
prearranged, the youngsters abandoned us, dove overboard and swam shoreward,
splashing, callÂ­ing, wishing us luck.

I wish I were that young, I told myself.

That night, heat lightning brushed the sky, forming
kelp-shaped ropes of yellow. Huge clouds massed about a thin moon and Phaon
prophesied rain.

My head on his lap, we drifted, watching, listening to a
singer, invisible man at the bow. His words made me uneasy as he sang of lovers
lost at sea. Our sail had enough wind to fill it and yet we appeared immobile.

I drew Phaonâs face to mine and his mouth tasted of oranges.

Above us, behind us, his flying fish rocked.

The lightning played among the stars and wet the sail and
our helmsman bent sleepily over the rudder: it was a night for love and when
the cabin had cooled, Phaon and I sought each other: he placed an orange in my
hand, the singing went on, the sea sobbed, the orange fell.

âPhaon?â

âWhat is it?â

Keep me, wait, go on, love me, donât...I wanted to say so
much.

I caressed him, breathed him in, the sanctity, the favor,
the graciousness, the ephemeral. I wandered through caves. I dove to the wreck
of the red-gold ship. I...

Later, we divided the orange and its sweet dribbled over us
and he pressed his mouth there and we laughed, thinking with body.

I woke to see the moon sink below the ocean, to see how
beautiful he was, his ship and fish swaying as a fresh wind clattered the sail.

Noon found us back in Mytilene.

P

Phaon

He is god in my eyes...

my tongue is broken;

a thin flame runs under

my skin; seeing nothing,

hearing only my own ears

drumming, I drip with sweat;

trembling shakes my body

and I turn paler than

dry grass. At such times

death isnât far off.

P

Anaktoriaâs flesh seems almost transparentâa sensuous
softness coming from inside. When my girls are dancing on the terrace or in the
garden, I wonder who is most beautiful.

Kleis spins. Atthis bends, arms upflung. I see a
grape-tinted breast, fragile ankles. Yellow hair flies over shoulders.
Gyrinnoâs throat is perfect. Malvaâs thighs. Look, Atthis and Anaktoria are
dancing together. For an instant, their lips meet.

Tiles are blue underfoot.

Our wonderful harpist, an old woman, watches with burning,
lidless eyes, remembering her naked days, playing them back again.

Cypress are drenched with sun.

P

Winter has come and Alcaeus has changed.

WinterâLibus and Alcaeus sit in my cold room, waiting. They
have been waiting a long time for me; they were here when I returned from my
birthday trip.

Alcaeusâ face is deeper lined: it has been lined for years
but something has happened abruptly, pain has pinched the flesh into new, tiny,
angry wrinkles.

Friends have reported that he is drinking again and yet this
is more than drink because I realize it is inner debauchery: the eyes cannot
confess: instead, the voice tells.

We huddle in our warm robes, the wind howling, and he says,
in this new voice:

âWhat has kept you? Weâve been waiting a long time.â

Libus says:

âWe havenât forgotten.â

âOr isnât this the day?â Alcaeus asks peevishly.

âOf course itâs her day,â Libus says.

Alcaeus chuckles.

When was it, I kissed that face, admiring its masculinity?
His hands never trembled.

Wind shakes the house.

Mind travels to other days when we struggled in exile, when Alcaeus,
badly dressed, kept us in food, stealing, conniving. Often there seemed no way
to get by. I sat, waiting, blind to life. That sort of blindness was weakness
on my part, or acceptance or hope. Listening, while we drank, I asked what hope
he had? He was deriving some satisfaction from his relationship with Libus.
There seemed nothing else. Little by little, he forgot why he had come to see
me: happy birthÂ­day became grimaces, guffawing, vituperations over battles. He
and Libus grew excited, enacting scenes with their hands, shuffling their feet.

âThis is how I beat off his genitals...â

Alcaeus roared, hand on his beard.

âI beat open his helmet...â

Yes, the war...

And in my room, I found relief listening to the wind, remembering
the boatâs passage to Limnos, my friends there, the festival in the vineyard, flute
and drum, carom of bodies, laughter: Was it Felerian who laughed that low
pitched melodiÂ­ous laugh? Was it Marcus who hurled his spear through the
target? I erased AlÂ­caeus: so much of life demands voluntary forgetfulness!

My girls had clambered about me at the dock, detaining me.
Why does their love soften me? So often there are petty squabbles but, at
reunions, they disÂ­solve: the moment becomes a moment of accord, making life
worthier: Gyrinno insists on carrying my basket, another smooths my scarf,
another offers flowers. Kisses. They buzz into a flurry of plans.

âTomorrow, weâll go up the mountain...â

âTomorrow, weâll...â

Ah-hah-who, ah hah-who, the quails cry, as night comes.

I light mamaâs lamp, so smooth to the fingers after all
these years, like alaÂ­baster. The wick struggles into flame, as if reluctant to
leave the past.

My Etruscan wall girl comes alive.

âAh-hah-who.â

I take off my chain and pearl cluster and lay them in their
scented box, pausÂ­ing, sensing, dreaming.

Perhaps Phaon will be back soonâunexpectedly. I could not
remain longer in Limnos, thinking he might returnâtonight. I long for his
mouth, the jerk of his legs, his
obeliskoâs
tyranny.

Hungerâlet me sleep tonight, tired after the voyage.

P

No sooner have I returned than I am upset. Life is
constricted... I stand among Charaxosâ Egyptian treasures, confronting him: a
twisted, gilded serpent god sneers at me: fragments of gold leaf blink: mellow
gold is underfoot: I sway, as I talk, my parasol clenched across my belly.

âNow, I know,â I say to him.

âYou know what?â

âThat you schemed with Pittakos, to have me exiled, with
Alcaeus.â

âWhat?â

âAfter all these years Iâve found out. Stop lying. You tried
to get our home, thatâs why you wanted me exiled. What a brother youâve been!
What a fool Iâve been!â

For once he shut his mouth.

âDuring the war years you made many trips, to sell your
wines...refusing to help me financially...yours is a debt you wonât pay...and
you donât care. Iâve dediÂ­cated my life to writing...I live no lie. I work to
make life significant.

âAnd now, why have I come? To quarrel? No, to tell you the
truth. Iâve nothing more to say. I want you to know that I know. Itâs a
satisfaction...â

I could have talked on, but I left, snapping open my
parasol, clutching EzeÂ­kiasâ arm, walking swiftly, curbing my pulse, hearing a
seagull, the wind icy at the corners of the town, dogs sleeping in the sun,
carts passing.

I tried to believe something was settled, that life was
worth more for having told the truth. Yet, I wanted to return to Charaxos,
demand apologies and restiÂ­tution, apologies for impertinent, biased
criticisms, as if apology, like a brand, could stamp out wrong, as if there
were restitution for my cheated years.

Somehow, as I walked, as Ezekias chattered, Aesop
commiserated: his hunchback shoulders squared my shoulders: his doll had the
dignity of a scepter to prod my spirit.

A tow-headed youth greeted us and I thought: I wish I could
have a son. Yes, to give birth again. That glory cancels many defeats.

In Libusâ house, I turned to him and said:

âI told Charaxos what you told me weeks ago.â

âBut I shouldnât have told you, Sappho.â

âIt was time I knew the truth.â

âAnd now you have an enemy,â he said.

âHe has been my enemy all the time, Libus.â

We sat on his veranda, an agnus-castus sheltering us from the
wind. His boy brought us drinks.

âAre we better friends?â he asked.

âI trust you more.â

Tree shadows moved across his mouth and chin.

âTrust is not always friendship. I shouldnât have informed.
How shallow we are, the best of us. We bungle. Friendship, yours and mine, itâs
hard to measure, perhaps we shouldnât try: isnât it better left alone? Friendship,
thatâs what weâve had all these years...I overstepped propriety.â

How pale Libus was, in his grey robe, shadows ridging the fabric,
chalking his face, thickening his lips, greying his hair. His sandals moved
nervously yet he never moved his hands: they remained weighted to his lap.

I ate supper there, lingering with the ancientness of his
rooms, dark mosaics, the crowning of a king behind him, Libusâ chair of white
leather, the king in the mosaic studying his crown, his jewels flashing red, a
hint of Corinth and a hint of Crete.

P

Remembering my shepherd visit, I wrote this:

Evening
Star

Hesperus, you bring

Homeward all that

Dawnâs light disperses,

Bring home sheep,

Bring home goats,

Bring children home

To their mothers.

P

What is it urges the mind to seek beauty? What is the
challenge? Why go where there are no charts?

Beauty says it is a kind of love.

So, I make love, in my quiet room, the word symbolic of man,
life
â
s continuÂ­ity, my paper taken from reeds and trees. I write of
birth, love, marriage and death, sensing that the unrecorded is vaster than the
recorded. I sense the stumÂ­bling: the past could be a gigantic storm, fog
obliterating at moment of revelaÂ­tion, fog fumbling from man to man, saying
come, saying stop. The past is a wave through which no swimmer passes. As surf
it inundates, then vanishes. On windy nights, it moans at my window, beautiful
and hideous. I struggle on.

P

I quote from my journal kept in exile:

For three days we have had little to eat, days of
quarrels, bitterness and savagery.

I gave myself to a merchant and he has returned the favor
by feeding Alcaeus and me. We ate in the kitchen, glad to find considerate
slaves. We can remain long enough to recover our strength, if not our hopes.

How I long for home and my servants, fish as Exekias can
prepare it, onions in Chian wine, olives from Patmos. It helps to list the good
things. Surely they are not lost.

How wretched to cheat myself to keep alive, to cheat the
face, the mooning eyes, the stupid mouth, the odor of flagrancy, the
disbelief...chattel, cringe, lie still, perform.

Copying those lines I remembered things I have never
recorded, our filthy clothes, windowless room, flies, thirst,
sickness...Alcaeus in jail... I was fined...authorities jeered at us...no
sympathy, no luck until Aesop, his fox, raven and rooster.

I never thought him brilliant but he was always
entertaining, agreeable about the smallest problem. Nuances come to me, as he
told of a turtle that ferried a small turtle and then, at the end of the pleasant
ride, said:

âLittle turtle, you must pay.â

âHow can I pay?â asked the little turtle.

âBy doing me a favor.â

âWell, what can I do?â

âHump along the beach and snatch me a fly.â

âI
â
ll do my best,â said the little turtle.

After humping and snapping till almost noon, the little
turtle brought a fly to the big turtle. Finding the big fellow asleep, the
little one had to cuff him.

âHere,â said the turtle, between closed lips.

âAh,â exclaimed the big turtle, swallowing the fly, tasting
it with care. âUmm, thatâs the first fly I ever ate! You see a little fellow
like you can do things a big fellow canât.â

P

During the night an earthquake woke me and I wandered
through the bedÂ­rooms, to see about my girls. Atthis needed covering and as I
arranged her covÂ­ers she murmured, âMama, mama.â Before I could slip away, she
grasped my hand.

âAre you homesick, darling?â

When I kissed her, I found her face wet with tears. âWhy
donât you go home for a few weeks?â I whispered. âYou were calling your mama in
your sleep. If youâre homesick, you must go home. Letâs talk about it tomorrow.
Do you want me to sleep with you?â

So we cuddled together and almost at once she relaxed and,
after a few enÂ­dearments, slept with her head on my shoulder, her violet
fragrance around me. I held her fingers a long time. Drowsily, I asked: where
do we go...why canât we remain young...happy? The last thing I recalled was the
sweetness of her perÂ­fume.

The earthquake had been forgotten.

P

Alcaeus sat on his leather stool, his dog at his feet,
sunlight behind him; elÂ­bows on his knees, he said:

â...I prefer that hymn. Thereâs really no finer. In spite of
time itâs full of force, springâs arrival, the brevity of summer, the dying
year. It has the shepherdâs power, the forestâsâpassion tamed and sanctified.
Another one I like is...

The woods decay, the woods decay and fall...

Libus, sitting near Alcaeus, quoted his favorite, huddling
in his robe, his face averted:

Alone, in sea-circled Delos, while round on beach and cove,

before the piping sea wind the dark blue storm waves drove...

Â

âWhy do you break off?â I asked.

He did not answer but said:

âThey knew, those ancients, how to supplicate the
lowliest...they preferred the virginal...snowy peaks...whispering groves...the
hunting cry...â

Warming my feet on a warming stone, I said I preferred the
golden hymn and repeated fragments...

Long are their ways of living, honey in their bread,

and in their dances their footsteps twirl, twirling light...

P

Fragment of talk:

âWe canât marry, unless we have a child...youâll be
twenty-three soon...it must be like that...my house is a house of women...â

I thought of those words as I passed Phaonâs house, beyond
the wharf, isoÂ­lated. As I passed, waves climbed its base, licking at boulders.
Its walls are thicker than most, cracked and mottled. I used to be afraid of
that house as a girl and as I passed these thoughts brought back some of that
apprehension. I glanced at the seaward balcony, tottering on wasted beams,
painted years ago. Seagulls squatted on the flat roof, as they have day in and
day out. There are five rooms underneath those tiles and his mother and uncle
lived and died there, a harsh struggle in rooms of simple furnishings, coils of
rope, nets, brass fittings and bronze anchors.

Phaon lives there with two men, their servants and a
hanger-on. Kleis visits occasionally. A parrot, some say nearly two hundred
years old, gabbles sayings and fills the sea-sopped silences.

Yes,
his house troubles meâits darkness, its evocation of poverty and my own exile.

P

While I was ill, Libus cared for me, the mastery of his
hands relieving pain. By my bed, talking soothing talk, he brought gradual
relief, just as two years ago. His hands are more than hands, it seems. Magical
masseur, he explores yet never gropes: his fingers, padded at the tips, press,
release, wait. Our friendship, with all its confidences, in spite of
differences, weathers the years and is stronger at such a time, under his
mastery. As he obliterates pain, he blinks absently or smiles his pale smile,
withdrawn yet assuring. He learned his art from a young Alexandrian, a man he
met while studying in Athens, who spoke many desert languages.

âIâd like to see him again. Iâve learned something through
my own experiÂ­ments; we would share. Of course, heâs a great man.â

And when I asked Libus about my illness, he said:

âToo much work, too much rich food, too much concern. You
havenât been using common sense.â

I didnât care for this and said:

âI know from what Alcaeus says, you help him more than
anyone. You can help me.â

âIâm not able to help him all the time.â

âYou mean his drinking?â

He shrugged.

âLetâs call it something else. He does nothing so much of
the time. Thatâs where the trouble lies. Heâs not thinking...doesnât care.â

âHe wouldnât let me in when I went last. Thasos had to turn
me away.â

âThe great soldier...drunk.â

âWhat can I do?â

âTry again, Sappho. You and I know what he isâand was. You
used to unÂ­derstand him better than anyone. Now, well, I do what I can. Heâs
growing worse...have you heard him bellow at me or Thasos, as if he were
commanding officer? No doubt you have...and more...â

Libusâ hands pushed and then, feather-weight, stroked
upward, over and over, inducing me to breathe steadily: his hands brought
warmth, my thinking became clearer. As he pressed, the weight on my heart
lessened; as his fingers covered my stomach, rotating their tips, I felt bitter
anguish might not come again.

Lecturing me, he cautioned me about food and advised less
exercise: rest, let the days flow by.

So, I sail with my girls, lie in the sun, walk, poke along
lazy trails, fuss in my garden. Winter is hard on me. Chills come, leaving my
stomach knotted, my eyes afire.

P

Phaon has returned.

P

Phaon and Sappho kneel in a grove,

a cithara beside them:

age-old trees shade the lovers:

the age of a ruined temple is part of

the timelessness of the grove:

bronze Phaon and white Sappho,

dusk takes over their whispers,

their motions, the wind in the olives.

Mytilene

U

nder the olive trees we faced
each other, alone, the sun coloring the ground, patching yellow and brown. A
butterfly circled, as if considering us. Tenderly, Phaon fitted his hands over
my breasts and I held him in my arms; swaying, we kissed: we had not talked
much and we knew talk could come later: his legs crowded mine: his hand undid
my hair, spilling it over my shoulders: confirmation was in that unÂ­disturbed
place and accord burned our mouths and throats. Encystment was the slipping
down of robes, our knees touching, the feeling, self, and underneath self, the
ground, our earth: yet we were not aware, only before and later: the
consummation dragged at the trees: I forced him to me, forcing back his face,
his mouth: how warm his stamina: tenderly, we rose, to fall back: tenderness,
how it becomes ash, taking us by surprise: I couldnât stop quivering till his
hands stopped me: his voice was real so all was real: then, he was home and
this was not a lie: I knew it on the slope of hills sloping to the ocean: I
knew it in the boat, far at sea.

P

When we learned of a terrible earthquake at Chios, we loaded
Libusâ boat with food, wine and water and set out, before dawn, across choppy
water, Phaon and I at the stern, under blankets, Libus managing the sail. We
were part of a small fleet but I couldnât discern another boat. Spray swished
overhead and fog, ahead and astern, seemed ready to pincer us. Under our hull
the water flooded ominously; the sky, without its stars, might have been the
ocean.

Our hard trip brought us into Chios tired and hungry; we had
been unable to look after ourselves but, without eating, we began to distribute
food and wine.

Chiosâhappy townâlay broken. I walked about, remembering,
stopping here and there: all the central part, shops and temple, were
dismembered, had windy dust blowing across it, greyish dust that seemed
mortuary. Yet, I saw no dead, only the injured: Libus helped them, bandaging,
talking: I gave wine and water, afraid: he was annoyed by my fear: I could not
find Phaon and that worÂ­ried me. Wine, and water, dribbling them, my hamper
shaking, the wind icy and dust in my mouth, I felt sick again. A child raced to
me, wailing: crouching down, I mothered her, fed her a little bread: as we
crouched, a slab of building fell, tottered forward and disappeared in a wave
of dust.

âThe quake came and came and then came again,â an injured
woman said, accepting dates and cheese.

By now, I saw others from Mytilene and their hearty faces
cheered me. But how the gulls screamed. Flocks wheeled and screamed.

On the beach we lit fires and cooked our suppers, wind and
dust still bothÂ­ering us: Phaon and I ate with people from home, our fire put
together from the prow of an old boat, the talk about Chios and the injured,
their lack of food and care. We slept in beached boats, the surf snarling,
stars breaking through fast clouds: I remembered the big dipper and frightened
people... Libus woke us early and we did our best to help, using splints,
caring for a head wound, bandaging a boyâs chest... Libus scarcely allowed
himself time to eat.

The wind had subsided, and I felt less fear and went about
with my basket of food and wine. In the afternoon, we welcomed other boats from
Lesbos and after a second night on the beachâthis one calm, all the stars
awakeâwe sailed for home, three of us leaving at the same time, our boats so
many grey corks on a line.

As I stared back at the stricken town, I heard the gulls.
âPhaon, it was bad,â I said.

âYes, very bad, though Iâve seen worse.â

âI hope I never do.â

âThese people had help...sometimes there is nobody to help.â

âWeâre in the lead,â Libus cried. âWeâll be the first ones
home. Now for some sleep.â

P

Today, I had a letter from Solon: he discussed politics and
his immediate inÂ­tentions and then went on to consider my poetry, praising it
for its lyrical quality, refreshing themes, compassion and sense of beauty.

I respect his judgment and his quotations sent me to my
books, to reconsider and evaluate. For a while, I sat at my desk, thinking over
passages, contemplating the ocean, serenely blue as usual. Life, for the
moment, was balanced: it had acquired profundity and calm: here was my reward
since I believed his assessÂ­ments just: for once, I needed no one to share: I
needed nothing.

But I picked up Aesopâs clay fox and recognized my need: the
bite of yesterÂ­day cornered me.

P

Kleis has fallen in loveâthis time with a cousin of
Pittakos. I am amused, and have done all I dare to make the pair happy,
picnicking and boating.

I have seen him at play on the field, built well, long of
leg, with a homely, genial face and grin that consistently makes up for
mediocrity. Like his cousin, I could add. But thatâs unfair. When I see him
screw up his mouth in front of Kleis, I sag. The next moment he brightens and
seems about to say something intelligent. Then, the cycle resumes. Love, I
remind myself, with inward nod, can be curious.

Well, I am playing the gameâif it is a gameâcircumspectly,
knowing winds can be fickle. I gather news from my girls who too often babble.

âSee, how she conducts herself! Sheâs grown up!â

âMy, theyâre serious!â

I am aware of her airs.

Am I to forget her clandestine meetings of a few months ago
and expect her golden head to settle down?

She confides in me and I conceal my smiles.

However, doubts from deep inside prompt me to accept and not
go in for ridicule: where is another daughter, where is the boy suited to your
taste? Is she to fall in love your way? Deeper, I discern the sacredness of
life, elements of faith and love.

Thinking these things, I go where the hills plunge to the bay:
I listen, under my parasol: there is much more than sound or silence: I am
confronted by yesÂ­terday, in the gulls: I squint, and there, on milky horizon,
I glimpse the spirit of man, blundering, a plant in his hand, a rope dragging
behind him, a dog by his side: what is the rope for?

I think of my school and how taxing it is to teach kindness,
moderation and beauty: yet, I am confident, teaching is worth while and living
worth while: good meals, laughter, music, dancing, love: they are there with
him and his dog and the rope, in sound or silence.

Kleis, may you find a good way, all the way.

For my part, my relationship with Phaon affords discovery,
Sumerian lassiÂ­tude, great rivers and forests, prowling sand, the bay and its
currents, the hull dipping, the rower heaving his arms, groaning.

Illusion, deceit, whatever it is, this is the happiest
period of my life.

As I walked by the columns of my garden, I recognized that
never have I acÂ­complished so much. I have unlocked doors. I see my esthetic
way: my personal recollections have pulled out of ruts. I have uncovered
uniqueness, sensibility... I have seen what it has cost man to survive: dunes
against dunes, lack of water, perilous heat: I have weighed his potential, his
grace, his beauty. I have sensed that appalling black that existed before the
coming of books. I have heard torn sail and smashed rudder. I have felt the
foundering.

That darkness must not come again!

We must see to that!

I walked among my statuary and benches, absorbing the
difference in roses: home and happiness were secure in me: my writing must be a
part of this place: marble benches, a face augustly seaward, lichened with
green: another face turned toward the sun, his enigma personal, his serpentâs
head prowling through a disc.

P

I found this in my journal, written more than fifteen years
ago:

Yesterday, Cercolas and I spent
the day in an olive grove where men were knocking olives off the trees...we
walked far.

That is all I wrote and yet that was one of the most joyous
days. What kept me from describing our happiness? Was I too close to it? Or was
the next day one of those hurried days and I thought I would write about our
day later on? Later?

A year later Cercolas was dead at war.

And what made those hours precious? It was our accord, the
day itself and everything we saw and did. I realize this now. His arms were
around me, or mine curled about his waist. His mouth went to mine, many times.
Mine to his. I wish I could remember what we said but I remember his smiles and
I remember his coarse brown Andrian robe and I remember how we looked at this
and that, making each thing ours.

Cercolas...your name is euphonious...your fingers reach out
of death...I glimpse your smile.

But is this all that remains when we are gone?

Is this the answer?

P

I have often relived the experience of giving birth. Had
Cercolas lived, there would have been other children. Kleis was born on a
summerâs day, the ocean lapping after a windy night, a dragonfly in my room,
clicking its wings over my bed. Mama saw it and murmured:

âThere...see it above you. Now, I know youâll have a girl!â

Shortly afterward, Kleis was born, the dragonfly still there:
how blurred, it seemed, and how the ocean faded and reappeared as I fought. I
felt I would drown in sweat, drops pouring down my neck. Mama wiped my face and
hands, her voice soothing, as she cooled me. I wasnât afraid: no, a new
happiness surged through me, even while my wrists were breaking and my knees
afire. Even while the pain tore me, I was aware of this happiness: I was bringing
life, defeating death, adding to our world. My heart sang, though sweat
drenched me, and the dragonfly, clicking its green wings, seemed a ragged dot
or great bird.

I was glad Cercolas wasnât there: I tried to remember his
love-making but all I could remember was pain and motherâs voice and the
chatter of Exekias and the sound of the sea. When Kleis had come, I thought: my
wrists are broken and my knees burn but Iâm glad, glad...and mother kissed me
and said: Go to sleep, darling.

When I woke, the top of the ocean had become pink and pink
webbed the sky: it seemed I was staring through woven stuff, skeins in rows,
with wool dropped and tumbled between: the pink darkened nearest the water and
stars were visibleâa sunset like many others and yet different because Kleis
was here: this was her first sunset.

P

During exile, when Alcaeus and I had the same room and bed,
he tried to make me feel our bad luck couldnât last. He would roar against it.
He might beÂ­gin the bleakest day with a song.

âHungryâletâs go beg!

âThirstyâletâs find a fountain. Thereâs cool water in the
shade of a carob.â

Our feet grew blistered. Days I lay on my mat, too sick to
move, he brought me bread or a flower. Kneeling by me, smelling of the streets,
heâd rub my hands...

âWeâll find a way.â

When we shared the big bed at Aesopâs, its sides painted
with flowers, AlÂ­caeus cheered, reminding me of our luck.

âRemember those candle stubs I found?â he laughed. âRemember
the roast lamb I stoleâhow the guy rushed after me, jabbing the air with a knife.
ReÂ­member...â

I remember my gratitude to Alcaeus and Aesop must not end.
Without their help I would have died.

I dreamed the other night that Alcaeus and I were exiled
again, that Alcaeus came to me, as I lay between heaps of dung: he crawled
toward me, clothes in rags, exhausted, blind. I opened my cloak and offered my
breastâwanting to suckle him.

Waking, I realized how late it was.

P

Four of us, with Libus as guest, had supper at a table on
the porch, a recepÂ­tion to honor Anaktoriaâs return...
bourekakia
and
stuffed grape leaves, Anaktoria serving, maturer with that overnight bloom,
that overnight assurance.

âDo
you like
bourekakia
?â she asked Libus, too obviously thinking of him,
offering him stuffed leaves instead of
bourekakia
, offering herself, at
least for the night, something in that spirit, making fun of TeleÂ­sippa, her
newcomer rival, who was also interested in Libus, diverted, momentarily by
someoneâs comment about my harp, a point to bandy for effect: how charming they
were, bathed and perfumed, Telesippa in her city clothes, Anaktoria in her
Cretan style, Gyrinnoâs jewels amusing us, the topaz swallowing her throat.

âYou see Sapphoâs harp has twenty strings and is for
Mixolydian songs.â

The topaz tinkled and a smile went round, coaxing us to feel
better.

I told them about the harp I had invented, admiring them as
I talked, hair, shoulders, arms...enjoying each girl. I realized they were
especially mine. No one else would have such an opportunity to influence them.

We listened while Anaktoria described her visit, her baby
sister, the sailor who died on the wharf, the arrival of an Ethiopian girl,
slave for a merchant. She talked as I had taught her, gestures well timed, head
poised. She has lost her island mannerisms, such as gulping impulsively and
biting off chunks of food.

Brushing aside her shoulder-length hair, blue eyes a little
wild, Telesippa gosÂ­siped about her dressmaker, âthe best in Athens,â whose
âtattling is incessant.â

Libus steered the conversation to something sound and Atthis
carried on: yes, no doubt, teaching helps.

Later, we sat on our terrace and passed around sweets and
nuts and Libus joked, sultry jokes of the last generation, wanting to impress
the girls.

Old tiles underfoot...youth around me...the thick walls of
my house above the sea... I relaxed until someone mentioned Phaon and I saw him
working on his boat, hands stained with oakum, knees rough from the planking.

âPhaonâI say good night to my girls. Youâll be with me,
soon. Soon, Iâll be buried under your mouth.â

Tomorrow, we meet after the games on the field.

Iâll see him there, legs flashing, discus flying, his spear
digging its hole. Iâll see him rock with laughter and splash himself clean.

P

Alone, I rubbed my hands over my body, thighs, breasts,
ankles, wrists and shoulders: my flesh is firm: I know, as I sense my own
integrity, that before long I must lie in death.

No waking touch on my belly and knees, no chance to comb and
dress my hair at leisure, no mirror for dawdling, no winging of gulls.

P

Poseidon

Of the poems I have written recently, I like these most:

Love, bittersweet, irrepressible,

Loosens my legs and I tremble.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .

I could not hope

To touch the sky

With my two arms...

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .

The sun sprays the earth

With straight-falling flames...

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .

O, Gongyla, my darling rose,

Put on your milkwhite gown...

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .

When seastorms scream across the water,

The sailor, fearing these wild blasts,

Spills his cargo overboard...

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .

The night closed their eyes,

And then night poured down

Black sleep upon their lids.

Alcaeus prefers the last two.

P

In a vase, on my table, a white rose opens and I see the
face of Anaktoria. The rose is the most perfect flower, some say. Of the two
kinds, the garden and the rambler, I prefer the rambler, climbing through the
night, bringing its fraÂ­grance into my room, white in the starlight, ivory in
the moonlight.

P

The sea and its waves are something we never forget yet
never remember: how the surf leaps and splits into foam, how the foam cascades
into white and divides into blue. From shore to sky there is blue, in patches
like marble, areas like grey and porous granite, ribbons of blue that submerge
in whorls.

How quiet the blue, how serene where afternoon sun polishes
a path aimed for the shore, Cretan, Ethiopian, Etruscan, where men and ships
have sailedâtheir hieroglyphs ruddered by chance. The ocean is always chance,
yet it is subdued, finally modulated by place and time. Wherever we travel,
there is the element of chance, rain, storm, heat, cold, before us, deceptive,
feminine, wrapÂ­ping us in fog, cities, deserts, islands, birds, starry decks
and windless watches.

We never remember the sea because it alters momentarily,
making rainbows, spreading colonies of butterflies, floating celery stalks,
turtles, heaving shells and driftwoodâbeaching itself with footprints that fill
with seepage or disappear underneath the wave.

P

Cercolas and I had such fun, when we were newly married and
rode our white mares, across the island and along the shore, sometimes swimming
them. When the oldest became sick, I put a pillow under her head and tended her
until she died, on the beach, beneath the thatch of her stable.

Cercolas took the other mare, to die with him at war, I
suppose it was. How can I know?

Our horses have gone, six or seven at a time, until there
are only colts and old onesâI see them on deck and in holds, their white faces
peering, yellow manes shining: white, in memory of our mares, white as gulls. I
wish I could hear their whinnying across the fields, as they race toward me.

Warriors brag about their fearless horses but I prefer mares
that nip my hands and tug my clothes.

P

Music is a tree, a cave with sea water sloshing, a shell to
the ear, a babyâs laughter, the loverâs âyes.â I suppose it came from the
flint, the arrow. Cercolas was music. Mother was music. The loom and harp are
music. I have heard music in my dreams. I dream many kinds of music when I play
the harp.

I like music best at night, under the stars; I like it when
I lie down in the afÂ­ternoon, aware, yet not truly aware; I like it when I am
up the mountain, the wind harsh; I like it when I am on the shore, the beach
fire low, sparks rising, the sea almost at rest.

I
like music when I eat, when I am at the theatre, or alone. Lonely music is
marrow-wise, aware of secrets, revelatory in surprising ways, prying,
blurringâaltogether deceitful. I like the harp better than the horns. Drums
frighten. The voice is best: its story is manâs, the seaâs, the mountainâs, and
the skyâs.

P

How I used to laugh at rimes Alcaeus wrote against Pittakos:

Old Pitt, we found your cloak

Among the fish and fisherfolk;

We saw your mouth gape and perk

Whenever a blouse made something jerk.

I suppose Pittakos paid many a visit to the fisherfolkâhe
was young enough then. And Alcaeus was clever enough to wring every drop of
satire out of Pâs doings. His foolery endangered many of us. What a disgrace
Pittakos remains in office. How fine it would be if Libus were empowered.

Libus says:

âThere arenât enough of us to overthrow this man...heâs
entrenched till he dies. Itâs better to wait. Look at Alcaeus, what has his
fight gotten him? Part of his tragedy comes from his inability to overthrow
this man.â

Yesterday, when I visited Alcaeus, I shivered and pulled
back. Alcaeus stepped forward and grabbed my hand.

âCome, darling, weâre having a drink. Join us.â

Libus signaled me to sit down: their dining room was full of
phantoms; shields glared; pennons dragged at me. With an apish grin, Alcaeus
reeled across the room to bump against a table and chirp a drunken song.

It was rainy and dark and the melancholy afternoon and room
closed in. You must pretend, I said to myself. Pretend he can see. Pretend
thereâs nothing wrong...imagine...

As the three of us drank together, a scrawny, red-fleshed
boy served us, downcast, looking as if recently beaten.

As we drank, the melancholy of Alcaeusâ soul spread, seeping
through taut throat muscles: intelligent things said with difficulty, good
things said badly, reminiscences slightly distorted. What is more dismal than a
damaged life, damÂ­aged beyond alteration, no matter how much we care? What more
futile than communication at such a time?

I could not look at him but looked at Libus instead, his
ephemeral face growing more ephemeral as he continued drinking, wrestling with
his dogged silence.

Drink could not help... I fled home.

Mytilene

641

Three soldiers have been washed up on a raft, scarcely
alive: all of them were taken to Alcaeusâ house to recover, if that is
possible. Libus wanted them there, to care for them. They are islanders and had
been imprisoned over a year. For days they had been adrift, paddling, foodless
except for fish and birds. I hear from Thasos that one of them, not much older
than Phaon, throws himself against walls and stalks about babbling to himself,
begging for water.

Alcaeus is in his element, determined to help these
derelicts: heâs captain again, in command: heâs kinder and more resolute with
this trio, which he beÂ­lieves he understands: oh, I sympathize with these
sun-blackened wanderers, these lovers of freedom who defied jailers. I, too,
know what it is to defy, and what it costs.

I sent them food but I could not go to them.

Later, I changed my mind; I wanted to see them, to see what
their failure had done to them, what their fight had cost. I decided I might be
able to encourage them, so I brought Atthis and we asked Libus to let us in and
we talked to two of them, giving them food and helping them eat and drink, and
everything went well till the mad fellow heard us and hurled himself against the
bedroom door and burst in, to collapse in a heap, jabbering, writhing, eyes
rolled back.

Atthis jumped from her chair and cried:

âUh...how terrible...like a worm!â

Libus knelt by the young man and his hands quieted him. Not
a word was said: then he turned to Atthis:

âHeâs been through a lot. Exposure...heat...no food... We
can help him. Heâll be all right, in time.â

With a few reassuring words, he got the fellow up and led
him away.

Later, I learned that one of the older men is a cousin of
Phaonâs. Phaon has heard the details of their days on the raft, and I am
pleased by his kindness, the hours he gives to stay with the pair.

He and Libus are restoring them: food and encouragement are
cancelling horror. Even the mad fellow is mending, eating and drinking
normally, talking rationally much of the time. Phaonâs cousin claims he fought
with Alcaeus, but Alcaeus canât identify his bearded soldier: is it lapse of
memory?

Or was it, as the cousin says, the period when Alcaeus lay
injured, the spear wound in his skull healing, those weeks of pain that brought
about his blindness?

P

Sappho and Phaon, in a small boat,

drift seaward, oars dragging:

shimmering light seems to tow the boat seaward.

Stripping, bronze, Phaon dives

expertly and brings Sappho a handsome conch:

listening to the shell they lie in the boat

and begin to make love,

a bronze gull sculptured on the sky,

the sound of waves.

P

haonâs crew is loading his ship with
pottery for Byzantium, a cargo that has to be delivered soon. This realization
sharpens our love, though he thinks too little of distant voyages and I trouble
him too much with warnings.

Summer is upon us and I accept the lethargy of eating,
sleeping, dreaming. He likes summer heat, our damp bodies, my sticky perfume
and sticky fingers... cool drinks. He enjoys fruit mixed with coconut and has
had my girl preÂ­pare mixed salads...

âFruit. In hot weather, nothingâs so good. And thereâs never
any fruit at sea.â

âNot for long.â

âYou know...when I come back, Kleis may be married. Your
family will be bigger, you know.â He talked languidly, with his cheek against
mine, as we sat on the beach.

âI hadnât thought of that.â

The thought troubled meâfixing time around me: Kleis could
not be this old!

Baskets and dishes cluttered the sand around us, wind
puffing, light ebbing to lavender, fog on the water, floating above the
surface, a boat creeping, its mast slicing misty layers, moving between floors.

What shall I give him for luckâa charm? A coin?

Why not my motherâs drachma? She was lucky: there was no war
in her time: she had lovers and then a husband to whom she was faithful. She
did not have to endure an island without young men and know what it was to live
among women for ten years.

Yes, the old initialed drachma of hers...

The loading of the amphorae was delayed and we sailed in his
smaller boat, with a crew of three, to the bay where the wreck lies, our
sailing so smooth the hem of my skirt hardly swayed. Phaon equipped us for
diving and since the ocean lay incredibly calm, we located the wreck easily by
tacking in circles. Kelp had snared the mastsâgiant legs of brown. Her masts
struck fists against us, as greenish fish crossed and recrossed her deck.
Splinters of light sank straws, fidgÂ­eting straws that reached the dragonâs
gold and red.

I worried, afraid of kelp and fish.

Phaon disappeared beyond our bow: his brown arms yanked at
the kelp; he bobbed and swam toward me, treading water, puffing.

âLet me help you.â

âNo. Itâs too deep,â I refused.

He and his crewmen dove by holding rocks meshed in pieces of
net; they coaxed me until I had to try, sliding down rapidly, too fast for me:
I knew I could let go of the rock or jerk the line attached to it and be towed
upward; I wanted to be brave and gulped and oozed out bubbles, peering up. I
wanted to put my feet on the wreck but I never reached her. Lungs bursting, I
swam upÂ­ward, soared, unable to see clearly. My lungs hurt a long time
afterward, as I lay on deck, amazed at the crewâs folly and strength: there was
no end to their enÂ­thusiasm, their plunges from deck and rigging: by sunset,
they had hacked through the wreck, entering the dead cabin: when we raised
anchor and swung for shore I was glad, and hungry.

That night, I dreamed of gaping fish that carried coral
fans: our sail became a net that filled with fish of reddish hue, then sank, to
be towed to sea: all night a gentle sea rocked us, the dipper above our rocky
shore.

In the morning, while the bay lay limpid, before I could
finish eating, our men dove and chopped. As I lazed, birds spiraling, someone
hollered and flounÂ­dered toward our boat and I rushed to the side to see a
sailor with a green cup, treading water, offering me his prize.

So the men had not been excited for nothing.

Phaon was as pleased as his men. Hunkered on the deck beside
me, he nicked the green of the cupâs rim and uncovered gold, the gold gleaming.
Iâll remember his hands as he passed the cup to me.

Who made it, how old is it, how long was it below? we asked
each other, as I held the cup, our deck swaying.

The crewâs crazy conjectures and laughter went on, as they
went on diving.

It was hard for them to give up and sail for home: stars
pegged our rigging and flipped over glassy combers: fish leaped: we watched as
great white crests rose: we slept and woke, our deck slanting, boom groaning.

Phaon woke and we talked, of our separation and reunion.

âYou will be gone a long time!â

âPerhaps my trip wonât be so long.â

âLetâs come back to the old wreck.â

âWill you dive?â

âI tried...â

We whispered and saw the dawn, a dawn that had streamers of
rain splotchÂ­ing the horizon, pelicans one after the other in long files, our
island in the offing, quite black.

P

I was sleepless most of the night, getting out of bed,
restless because of the warmth, standing by my window, waiting for a breeze,
the stars out, Mercury but no moon, the stars and the crickets and a
nightingale and the sea, and someone, somewhere in the house, moving, then
silence. I was thinking of him, wanting him, and I began a poem, changed it,
rephrased it, thinking, my body needing his body:

Slick with slime to satiety he shoots forward

playing such music upon those strings,

wearing a phallus of leather,

such a thing as this enviously,

twirls, quivering masterfully,

and has for odor the hollow mysteries,

orgies for leaving, orgies for coming;

the oracle comes, comes with companions,

comes with mysteries, lover of mine,

displays this randy madness I joyfully proclaim.

I started the poem once more...such a thing as this
enviously, thatâs suitable... twirls, quivering masterfully...hollow
mysteries...there are good things...

Dawn came and there were the sounds of pigeons, gulls,
servants coming and going, girls whispering...the laughter of girls.

P

The bay lay almost black and Phaonâs ship was quiet, its mahogany
rails shining, someone leaning over, utterly motionless. I looked about for a
moving bird or a boat. Huddled on the wharf near me, a man slept, toothless
mouth open, nets over his legs and thighs. A similar mesh covered the water, as
far as I could see.

Wanting to say good-bye, I stood to one side beside Atthis
and Gyrinno, chilled, afraid. The slow unwrapping of the clouds irked me: a
number of men arrived and carried bundles aboard, their motions slow, their laughter
irritating. Was man always oblivious?

Then, from at sea, voices came, shifting uneasily, an oar
creaking between unintelligible words, a dog whining, a girl coughing.
Loneliness filtered from the sky and depths.

The man still leaned over the rail...

âOff with the ropes.â

âEveryoneâs aboard.â

âLetâs sail.â

It was Phaonâs voice: âletâs sailâ: and he called to me,
called to all of us: I heard Libus and Alcaeus: I heard the oars: as the ship
headed seaward, Atthis hugged me and my loss was in that receding figure at the
stern, sail climbing the mast behind him: had I shouted good-bye?

Bitterness struck me: again I knew I had no right to such a
mood. Better to have a fling at Charaxos, there on the wharf, in his white
clothes, sullen, belliÂ­cose, his friends snubbing me as we walked past.

Home seemed meaningless.

Had Alcaeus felt this way, on his return?

I knew he had and knew he had had ample reason and threw
back my head, as I opened my door, and walked to my room alone, determined to
think clearly: but it was no more than a resolve and the loneliness of those
sea voices came and that voice, saying: âLetâs sail.â

My ocean window called me.

Was that his ship, that mere dot, that point of wood under
banks of cloud?

I couldnât keep back my tears: what was it, his spirit, his
dignity, his thorÂ­oughbred body? No, it was the conjunction of these and the
very thought, this summary, increased my sense of loss. He was warmth, impulse,
reason for living. Words! And he was more than words!

By now the dot had disappeared and against the clouds, birds
wheeled and drifted and scattered raindrops fell, scenting the air. I went out
and let them wet my face and take away the sting and then closed the shutters
of my room and lay down.

Rain has such music.

I let it lull me to sleep, sleep, in the morning, warm, in
my bed, a day or a year...sleep...was it from the depth of the sea?

That night a storm engulfed us, ransacking our trees,
banging our shutters, moaning over the roof until Atthis got into bed with me,
thoroughly scared.

âDonât be afraid, darling.â

âI am...I am...Arenât you?â

âNo...maybe a little.â

âWhat about Phaon?â

âHeâs far at sea by this time.â

âBut isnât that bad, to be far at sea?â

âI donât know...hush.â

I resented her pliant body and scented arms and hair: yes,
at sea, Phaon must be battling gigantic combers: his cargo might shift...his
sail might... When Atthis hugged me, I felt stifled and yet, as she quieted and
the storm continued, I was grateful I could comfort her. If I could not have
Phaon, I, at least, had someone who loved and needed me.

Rain and wind knocked open the shutters and I rose and
closed them and dried my feet and got into bed again.

Floor tiles had chilled me.

Rain cuffed roof and sides of the house... I heard the surf
growing wilder, sloshing over rocks, climbing the lower cliffs, rising and
falling onto itself with a hiss.

I straightened my hair on my pillow, knowing I had hours to
wait: I said, youâve seen a lot of storms, sleep. Your island isnât in danger.
But, nothing could keep me from thinking of his boat and its struggle. I named
off members of his crew. I named their families.

Phaonâs cousin was with himâa wretched re-initiation, after
those hideous days on the raft.

I heard Anaktoria and Gyrinno talking in the next room.

I thought of the madman, living with Alcaeus, walking about
with him: Iâll make something of him, Alcaeus had said to me, the face
revealing that his madÂ­ness had not left him.

Joy and exaltation are the triumphs...

today is the imminence...

even shadows have their fire...

the stars burn...

O, sea rover, fight...

P

The
storm split roofs and hurled boats ashore, uprooting trees, damaging walls.

Slowly, the old town pulls itself together.

Old townâyou have seen many storms during your centuries. Is
it true, you let this one slip past you and sent it to sea? You should have
kept it! You can withstand battering better than a small ship! Is it true, what
the fishermen say, that many were drowned?

Men and boys go about town, picking up tiles to load their
baskets.

Driftwood clutters the beach.

P

Men were hurling stones, grabbing them off the beach and
throwing them. I heard them hit Pittakos and saw him stagger, his flapping rags
jerking, his arm flung over his eyes. Silent, feet wide apart, he stayed his
ground.

Alcaeus, facing the sea, lidless-eyed, roared and lunged
about, arms extended, yelling:

âKill him...kill him...let me wring his neck!â

Beside him, the madman off the raft, howled and hurled
stones.

About a dozen men were circling Pittakos, most of them
blabbing defiance, closing in.

I rushed to Alcaeus and squeezed past him, to cry out... I
told them to stop, asking them to stop in the name of our island, our town.

âGet back,â Alcaeus warned.

I faced them, feeling their hate: it bubbled through me,
seemed to ooze from the sand, from the sea, from antiquity: the hates of my
ancestors, hatred of tyrÂ­anny and unfairness.

No one threw: they watched me, as I walked toward Pittakos:
maybe they thought I had a stone.

âYou get back,â I cried. âGo home, before they kill you,
Pittakos. Get back everyone...go home.â

Nervously folding and unfolding his robe, Pittakos backed
away. A hand went to a spot where a stone must have struck. I felt no pity but
stepped closer.

âI donât know what caused these men to turn on you... I
donât want to know...go home, before itâs too late.â

Without replying, he shuffled away, a sandal off.

âIs he going?â asked Alcaeus, finding me, hand on my
shoulder.

âLet him go,â I said, facing the others.

Grasping Alcaeus, I forced him to walk with me, muttering to
him, seeing Thasos, dropping his stones with a guilty grin.

I wanted to forget the faces but I knew most of the men:
young, bearded faces, most of them friends of Alcaeus, some of them his
soldiers.

âDonât lead me,â Alcaeus protested.

âYou need to be led.â

âYou came at the wrong time.â

âWhatâs to become of you?â

âLet me go,â he said.

âIâll see you home. Here, Thasos, take his arm. Thasos, were
you mad?â

âWe should have stoned him.â

âWhy?â

âHe quarreled with Alcaeusâspat on him.â

P

Alcaeus leaned on me and I sensed his weariness as if it were
mine: he was breathing hard and had to rest, stopping again and again. Behind
us, his madman wandered, his Pamphilus.

âIâm too old for this kind of horseplay, it seems.â

Thasos and I were saddened by his tragic features; we
frowned; minute wrinÂ­kles had enlarged and deepened; his hands trembled; his
mouth was open. He seemed in the past, with his men, galled, waiting: What is
memory for, I asked myself, to crucify? Shut off from the day, is this the best
memory can do?

When I sat with him at home, I said:

âWhat was the quarrel about?â

âFirst, some water.â

Thasos brought us water. The cool of his gourd helped.

âPittakos has stolen from the city...again...I came at him
with the facts...I know the truth...many of us know.â

We remained silent a while, my hand in his.

âItâs an old truthâfor us,â I said.

âVery old,â he said.

Presently, the madman entered, carrying himself stiffly, chalk
faced, chastised. Oblivious of us, appearing more normal than any time I had
seen him, he talked with Thasos, regretting the incident.

Soft-talking men, inside an inner room, brought home to me
the
.
innocence of our own lives, how based on impulse, how like
kelp, twisting, sinking, headed for shore, dragged to sea: we are mad, we are
sane, or between: we exert ourÂ­selves and the world seeks revenge; we accept
and earn ridicule and belittlement: we affirm ourselves and alter our lives and
the lives of others: war is such an affirmation.

Innocence? Why not call all life innocent because
dependability can not be assured. And, if life is innocent, then what is there
but compassion and patience and kindness and beauty and love?

âIt would have been better if they had killed him,â Alcaeus
said, rubbing his hands over his face.

I said nothing.

âI could have him murdered,â he said.

âAlcaeus...wait...â

âWait?
How much longer must we wait?â

âHeâs old.â

âAre we children?â

âHe knows whatâs happening.â

âNoânot even yet.â

âThat couldnât be.â

I saw Pittakos by the sea, spray dampening his clothes, his
mouth to the gulls: I saw him, hand over eyes, legs spread; I heard stones
hitting him... I could take no more and saying good-bye to Alcaeus, I walked
home, eager to be alone, for now the town seemed withdrawn, callous,
incomplete, a failure. I touched a hollow in a wall and picked a leaf and,
where a street opened on the bay, looked and looked: the seaâs salty taste
acted as a philter and years of contentment and ease surged about me, trying to
reinstate themselves: my girls met me and we went home together, sharing our
innocence.

P

Just the other day, I dreamed of Serfoâs place, his fabrics
around me, things from Assyria, Egypt and Persia. Some of the cloth blew
against me, light as a Sudanese veil. Atthis had a length of it in her hands, a
twisted flowered piece yards long.

âIâll make ribbons for your hair,â she said.

Alone, I sank into patterns, colors and textures. Something
brushed my cheek, a winged bull in gold on blue cotton... I saw an imperial
snake in green on white silk, a mighty roc in black on grey wool... I heard
friends asking prices, Anaktoria, Libus.

I heard mother say:

âThis is the best, this one, darling, with temples and
shields on it, this blue, soft blue! Donât you love it? Here, take it in your
hands, press it to your face.â

I saw ships and listened to their keels...sailors unloading
bales...wasnât that a remnant on the water?

P

A suffusion of light envelopes the Venus de Milo,

revealing the contours and texture of her hair,

face, breasts, belly, and drapery.

Voices sing Homeric hymns.

A woman, as lovely as the Milo,

disappears in the golden light

beneath the Mediterranean.

Villa Mytilene

W

as it three years ago I met
Atthisâfive years ago Anaktoria? Was that another dream? I am not sure.

Awake, I thought about my girls and now much they love me
and make my house a house of grace. I must have beauty: I must have peace: and
they are peace and beauty. I recalled how and when I had met each and loved
each one for her special qualities. Each had a place in my heart, gold on cotton,
green on white...the sea was at each meeting and at each good-bye... I count my
years but the sea has no calendar.

Sometimes I feel the sea thinks for us, its pensiveness communicates
at dawn, its meditation at night, its probity sifting through the day. A stormy
emotionâthe sea. A period of tranquilityâthe sea. Ficklenessâthe sea. I could
not be happy without its communication. For all its pervasiveness it seems on
the verge of a secret: looking down through the waves I sense it, I sense it at
night, when phosphorescence steals shoreward or when rain obliterates and there
is no visiÂ­ble ocean, then, still, still it communes, insinuating mystery,
legends from caves, legends stronger than any coral, barracuda and stingrays
roiled under, sinking farther and farther.

P

As we eat, in the dining room, Atthis prattles about her new
parrot, mimickÂ­ing it.

Her glances, charming, rounded, sensual, inconclusive, ask
for love.

Her mimicry, spoken somewhat under her breath, takes in the
townspeople, theatre folk, the Athenian star, Alcaeus, Gogu, the girls. But,
because it is kindly and feminine, the fun carries far.

Her eyebrows have grown to meet over her nose and the fuzzy
little bridge gives her added years. Her breasts are larger, shoulders fuller.
She could be a priestess: the face solemn, the lips pert; then laughter ruins
everything and she is simply girl, joyous life, asking for love.

Dressed in thin summer best, she pokes her neighbor with her
sharp sandal and before I can say a word a scrap follows.

P

As I went downstairs, I put my hand between the lionâs jaws,
stubby, mossy stone, oldest part of the house. Lingering, I watched leaves puff
down the steps. By the fountain, I absorbed water shadows, warmth around me, an
insect swimÂ­ming toward a spot of sun.

P

A village girl brought me a bouquet of white roses, saying:

âYou must let me join your
hetaerae
.â

She wore a twisted blue wool skirt, of darkest color, and no
blouse. Standing erect, she offered her flowers and then spun around and fled:
I could scarcely take in the clean-cut features, pointed chin, red mouth and
new breasts.

I canât imagine who she is or where she lives but I must
find her.

P

My working hours are longer and as I review my work I find
it good: that is a sign of maturity: maturity is the seal I strive for and yet
as I work I fear a loss of spirit: maturity is seldom daring and to be daring
is to open doors: maturity, then, is balance: is it also the decorum people
accuse me of? Parasol, tilted at just the proper angle? Mask, worn at the right
moments? As I came home yesterday from the play, I remembered a winking mask,
rather like one in my room: was that derision?

P

I saw a young man on the street who startled me. Though he
didnât glance at me, I thought I had seen him in Samnos: ax beard and sullen
mouth were the same; he had the same slouch, the same filthy clothes. Watching
him, I recalled that Samnian fellow, his pleas and questions:

â...tell nobody Iâm here...but I want to know about
home...tell me the news! You see Iâve been here for three years...to escape the
war...there are three of us...we came here on a raft...tell us...â

The frenzied talk was vivid as this derelict walked down our
street.

In Samnos, I had sympathized with my countryman for his
voluntary exile was no easier than an enforced exile: I drew him out and later
met his friends, all hungry for news, all in rags, living from hand to mouth,
scared. It was their fear that worried me and I urged them to make friends and
forget the past, to marry and begin life in Samnos. I arranged contacts for
them...

But, was this one of them sneaking along, hoping for luck?
Pittakos, the wise, the clement, would have him lashed to death by nightfall,
if someone discovered him. My pledge of secrecy is a pledge Iâll keep. As I
sailed home from Samnos, I thought of these men and was proud of their folly.

P

Roses are in bloom on the hills and violets are in flower
around my house. Kleis will be married soon, so I am doing things wrong. I try
to tell myself this is her happiest time and struggle to write a poem for her
wedding. Her natural gaiety is infectious and yet, and yet...

We will have quite a ceremony, Libus, Alcaeus, Gogu, Nanno,
Helen, my girls, sailors, half the town, Pittakos and rogues...Rhodopis and
Charaxos...no, harshness is not in keeping with a wedding.

I can hear the male chorus.

I hear the surf...

Below us, the ocean eats at its rocks, above us lie the
hills, around us stir the branches of the olives.

Peace: sacred grove, we dedicate these two: give them luck:
a light will fall: the chorus will resume: a wreath will be hung.

Shall I play my harp?

Who is the god of illusion? Love? How is he to be kept alive
through many years and many disappointments?

I shall try to help. Song has that gift, a gift nothing else
has: to give the lost or hold it in suspension.

P

I feel utterly ridiculous, the greatest hypocrite: that is
how it seems as I urge Alcaeus to curb his resentment for Pittakos.

I have tried reason but it isnât reason that moves Alcaeus.
When he feels my sympathy, he listens: if he conceives of us as he used to be,
his hatred subsides. Let him feel alone, he thunders, bends toward me, drags
his fingers through his beard and sputters:

âTo hear you talk, Iâd think you were never mistreated by
this man!â

âBut you know better.â

âYouâre a traitor to yourself!â

âThatâs not true. You want to have him killed and I say we
lose through vioÂ­lence. Iâm no traitor to myselfâor you. You can be traitor to
justice.â

âLetâs not say anything about justice, when weâre fighting
tyranny.â

I recalled days with Aesop and said:

âI wish he was here, to advise us or hear our problems. I
think I know what heâd say.â

âWhat?â

âThereâs a way out of slavery... I didnât kill my master.â

Slaveryâthere are all kinds.

It is a kind of slavery to long for Phaon and another kind
to remember Aesop and another to hope. Perhaps Aesop would rebuke such thinking
and say: SlavÂ­ery is not in ourselves but in the misused power of others.
Surely that is the commoner kind but I find slavery in myself and my girls and
my island and my books.

Well, here is a story Phaon told me:

âYears ago, a slave broke into a temple on a deserted island
and found lamps burning. On a rug lay a naked man, asleep. Heâd been lying
there for centuries, guarded by someone, the lamps filled and the wicks new.

âThe
King of Freedom, were the words on a shield beside him. His yellow hair
streamed across the rug. Above him, a mask, fastened on the wall, spoke:

â
âS
hut the temple...let the lamps
burn...make no noise...take a hair from his head...go.â

âThe
slave shut the temple, carefully.

âYears later, in prison, he bent over to examine the golden
hair he had kept and it burst into flame and became a torch which he used to
light his way to freedom.â

P

His flames and heat are fuel

For seamanâs muscles, his sea eyes,

Devil of laughter and devil moods,

His sinking-rising delicacy.

The initial union is relief

Of olives and cypress, breasts, birds,

Stinging and perspirationâs siege,

Roots climbing out of centuries.

P

Beauty, the wedding is over and I am alone with my lighted
lamps and moonlight across the sea, nightâs indifference.

Beauty, Kleis was happy...many of us were happy.

After the ceremony, Pittakos approached me, shuffling,
dressed as I had never seen him dressed, in fine white clothes. His hate was
gone, that was something I saw at once: I was seeing another man. Speaking
guardedly, hands folding and unfolding his robe, he said:

â...They would have stoned me. What can I say...to make
amends? You stopped them from killing me... You...you helped me...â

I grew confused. Remembering Alcaeusâ threat, my hatred
surged and I thought: Can he expect me to rub out the past because of an
accident on my part? Can he ask such a thing?

Do you think that I have changedâthat I went out of my way
to save you?

My own harshness pained me. I had seen him at a distance,
during the cereÂ­mony, and had resented his presence; as I played my harp and
sang he remained near, boggling his head.

Our sacred grove, filled with people, trees streaked with
fog, was still in my mind. I could see Kleis smiling and hear the wedding
chorus, the flutists, the barking dogs, the cries of gulls.

Glancing overhead, I noticed them, passing, gliding, saying
with their grace things I tried to say in my writing.

Pittakos turned away.

I could not say a word but stepped forward.

â...Pittakos.â

He regarded me doubtfully.

âYes.â

Then I started to walk away.

âWhat can I say? Iâm old... I canât erase errors. Sappho,
I... Last night I stayed up all night...it was more than thinking: I looked at
the past. Iâve been mistaken. Though weâve lived here, in this town, we know
only lies about each other...â

Shuffling, he made off.

All were there in the grove: Alcaeus, baffled; Libus, pale
and aloof; Anaktoria, gay; Atthis, dreaming; Kleis, my herder... We ate
together, drank, sang... The sun drank the fog and sunset ribboned the ocean.

I shall remember goats wandering through our grove, tinkling
their bells...the mask-maker carrying my harp for me...trying to sing in
toothless ecstasy...I shall remember the altar fire and wreaths of flowers,
their incense and coloring... remember, too, the farewell of my pair, their
backs and shoulders as they headed for their house on the headland, a small
place among figs and tall white poppies, their worldânot mine. I must remember
it is their world. When Kleis flings her arms around me I will rejoice. At the
same time, I must accept the fact that their marriage is their particular
freedom.

May it be a satisfying freedom.

Motherâs lamp, as I write, is nearly empty: she would have
liked the wedding ceremony, the chorus singing my poem: terra-cotta lamp, do
you remember her wedding? Did you burn for her ecstasy or were you snuffed out
before the groom carried her to bed?

It wasnât long ago I was married: how I walked, my head
high, the embodiÂ­ment of innocence and grace: I thought life would be easy!

The wind puffs through my room.

The ocean whispers.

P

Charaxos and Rhodopis attended the wedding, staying apart
with a group of their friends, no one dressed for the occasion. Since the man
who had forcibly made love to her was there, I was disconcerted. I was ashamed.
My face burned. What could I do? Would they interfere? But they seemed
preoccupied, merely onlookers, most of them young men and women.

When they sauntered away, I enjoyed the wedding.

Someone among them, a stranger perhaps, gazed back at me,
reminding me of Cercolas.

Cercolas, my mother, Aesopâeach summons a series of images.
When each one died, I thought: How can I go on? Now my thought is: What has
replaced them? Husband, mother, friend... I am forever altered by their
absence, emptier, lonelier. I seek them in others and yet never find them.

It matters to me how they died.

I am still troubled that Cercolas died on the battlefield.
And it is tragic that Aesop died, beaten by a mob. At least, mother died beside
me, comforted as much as human comfort is possible.

Death should not catch us unaware for then it cheats us
doubly. Surely, it is hard enough to die without dying in some tragic way. Each
of us deserves a last dignity.

P

Shall I tell Alcaeus that Pittakos came to me after the
wedding?

I may never tell him because he will suffer more for
knowing. It seems to me telling him could accomplish little. Hard as it is,
unfair as it is, I must keep this to myself. Of course, some would disbelieve.
And if Pittakos sees fit to remain silent, he and I will be better off. Lives
will be less complicated.

Even unmolested, he has not much time ahead. We must be
far-sighted and choose a leader...

P

Homosexual lovers in bed,

making love in the moonlight.

The light falls on their flesh,

faces, hands, legs, their passion:

laughter and soft moans and

the ocean below the villa.

Sappho rises and ponders her body,

stands by a window, facing the Aegean.

I took my lyre and said:

Here, now, my heavenly

Tortoise shell, become

A speaking instrument.

O

ne by one, the poems have fitted
into my book, so slowly time seems to have had nothing to do with its
completion. Yet, my ninth book is done. When I had finished my sixth, I
thought: this is all. When I finished my eighth, I felt I need go no farther.
Will there be a tenth? What will make it distinctive?

Phaon lives in this book, insatiability floods everywhere:
lyric by lyric, our smoldering hearts reveal our happiness.

When I shared lines with him, he laughed at their frankness,
eyes dancing. He remembered some of them, and shot them back at me, to tease.

I have sent selections to Solon: what will he write me? Will
their crudeness be too much for him? I think not. He has savored love.

My Egyptians are copying the bookâconspirators, no doubt,
mumbling lines to each other, shaking heads. Iâd like to slip into their shop
as they work, to overhear them: would I laugh or recoil? Probably Iâd be
annoyed. Well, tomorÂ­row I must go to the shop and see how they are doing.

I have not thought of a title.

P

Villa Poseidon

I sought Anaktoria and together we spent the night.

In spite of her comfort, I could not get to sleep. Her arms
around me, she lay motionless.

During the afternoon, we arranged flowers, taking them from the
garden. A rainbow appeared over the bay and arm in arm we watched it, its arc
faintly reÂ­flected on the water. Her myrrh was everywhere, her spirit too: the
things she said were right: family traditions are a part of her and she adds
just enough fanÂ­tasy.

For a while, we practiced archery, her shooting more
accurate than mine. A lost arrow sent us near the sea. Then
games...games...what would life be without games and laughter!

Watch the dice in her fingers!

Sheâs a magician of tricks and youth, my Anaktoria and,
oddly enough, I can never bring it all together; it is too effervescent, too
delightful: the moment swells over us: then, another moment, even while we are
eating together, growÂ­ing sleepy together: ours is a gift that has come from
our island without men, years of femininity.

P

Someone sent me the doll Aesop had when he died, his Cretan
doll. It came from Adelphi; badly wrapped, I opened it in my library, laid it
on my desk, amazed to see it, startled, fingers fumbling. Someone had wanted to
be kind, but it wasnât kindness to send it. What faded colors, what worn cloth,
how had the doll gotten this old? It had suffered another kind of death.

With the doll in my arms, I smelled the incense of his
house, dinner on the table, fresh fruit piled before us: the broad bracelet he
wore bothered him and he shoved it higher on his arm: silent tonight, he
listened to what we had been doÂ­ing during the day: he had such heart for
Alcaeus and me.

I could not keep the figure but packed it away. Its
evocative intimacy, its forlorn quality...they would serve no purpose I could
think of. I was glad Alcaeus could not see it. Yet, I felt I had rejected
Aesop.

P

A sweltering day was made worse when Gogu had a seizure near
Serfoâs shop. Serfo and Libus carried him inside and I found them working over
Gogu, kneeling beside him, Serfoâs slave fanning the sick man, swaying his palm
frond low, Libusâ face tense and canvas-colored. Serfo turned his barbaric
features, square-cut beard and blazing green eyes, on me, resentful when I
placed a damp sponge on Goguâs head, when I suggested we pull him farther away
from the wall. He growled and backed off, to care for some customers.

âIs it Goguâs old trouble?â I asked.

Libus nodded, his hands comforting the man. When Goguâs
teeth chattered and his head and shoulders shook, Libus restrained him, hands
on his shoulders. When he spoke to Gogu, I could detect an immediate response.
The slave brought water and poured it for Gogu and Libus got him to drink: the
frond dipping closer, rising and falling. âLibusâLibus,â he said, and sighed,
thin lashes over upturned eyes. The black hitched his broadcloth and sighed
too.

The room was windowless and cool, lit from overhead. A
pigeon cooed on the roof. For a while I sat near Libus but when Serfo offered
drinks, we went into his shop where he displayed ivory figurines on his dusty
counter, Amazons, ibis, Etruscan warriors and sacred cats, none bigger than myÂ
hand.

âThe cats are from Luxor,â Serfo said.

âWill Gogu be all right?â I asked, hearing his rapid
breathing.

âHeâll be all right by evening,â Libus said.

So we examined the collection, Libus questioning their
antiquity: I pointed out the yellowing and flaking: he held an Amazon in the
doorway, dust cracks mottling her face and armor, the texture of his hands
obvious as well.

He seems to be holding me in his fingers, as small. I felt
the flakes of timeâmy life flaking, like Goguâs, less lasting than the ivory.

P

The hours I spend with Libus and his sister are hours of
talk and wine, at his small house, in its garden of figs and olives, poppies in
bloom along the paths. Their place, nearer the bay than mine, absorbs the bayâs
placidity. The furniture stresses comfort. His mosaics reflect his regard for
ease...scenes of old days and old creatures.

I was glad when Libus gave up staying with Alcaeus; I had
missed those visits to his home where Helen has taught me designs for my loom
and reaffirmed what patience really is. She has read to me, acquainting me with
books I would never have found...

Libus talks and toys with a loop of beads, in a thoughtful
mood, his hands, as they move, remind me of their healing quality and his voice
has that same beÂ­neficence, distinctly personal, meanings having extra meaning
most of the time.

Helenâs face has none of his ephemerality but has, instead,
a country wholeÂ­someness I love. She chats about flowers she has grown, seeds
she keeps in jars, promising me a selection.

Their poppies, grey-leafed, sea-bitten, have large centers
and bees loll on the petals and the sea lolls beyond them.

Why is it the hours loll here? I have seen whales from their
garden, sporting near beds of kelp, their blue backs like so many watery hills.
I think something lures them offshore...another something makes Libusâ servants
sing more than my servants.

P

A gigantic sea-rock assumes the face of a crying woman when
the fog comes: some say she cries for our dead in the wars, some say itâs for
those lost at sea: I have often seen her, head bowed: she faces the town,
staring: the sea sound is her weeping; perhaps it is the weeping of many women:
if I walk by that deserted spot at night, with the fog about me, I cling to
Atthis or Exekias. No woman goes alone there, when the fog is about.

P

The moon has set and

The Pleiades have gone;

The night is half gone

And life speeds by.

I lie in bed, alone.

P

Going to see Alcaeus, I met Kleis and she threw her arms
around me and kissed me, saying:

âMama, dear, itâs good to see you! How I miss you!â

I tried to hide my pleasure but my heart sang and I held her
close, my body remembering hers, fingers slipping around the back of her neck,
staying in her hair.

Pushing me aside, she exclaimed:

âMama, letâs go to your house and be together, like old
times. Shall we?â

How easy to consentâand we walked home, arms around each
other, gulls over us, shadows skimming roofs, dusty cobbles asking for rain: I
wanted to remember her chatter, each inflection...

I would see Alcaeus tomorrow. I needed time with my own...

Pittakos stoned...Aesop stoned...the mobâs disgrace...

Year after year, is there greater calumny than our own
communal perfidy? Is there greater stupidity? One man starts it, then five,
then ten, manacled together.

For our islandâs sake, Iâm glad I cheated death.

Like old times, we sat at our looms and Kleis showed me a
periwinkle design, whispering confidences, saying he was good, saying the house
was good, the sea...she put her faith on the loom, the thread of it going
beyond life. Mother must have heard me say such things, reflecting the same
hope. Finches gathered in the olive trees as we worked. I asked time to stop
and let us have the day last, at least longer than evening and the shepherdâs
bells.

P

Charaxos brought him to my house, a castaway, I thought,
dreg of the worst sea. Charaxos stood behind him in Cairo red, the sun blazing
over the town, as the castaway bowed, holding together his rags, eyes
wandering, skin and bones, nose snuffing at his hand, his mouth lower on one
side, a canine look on his face.

Muttering, he fished in a sack tied about his waist and
offered me something.

I hesitated to take it, feeling Charaxosâ curiosityâor was
it gloating? I grew afraid as the castaway insisted, wagging head and hand,
Charaxos silent; forcing myself, I bent and peered at his hand...seeing a
drachma.

I saw it had been pierced for a chain...taking it, I made
out the letters my mother had gouged...in the metal...yes, it was her drachma.

I wanted to run, throw down the coin, send Charaxos away,
turn aside the castaway. I wanted to crumble on the steps and bury my head in
my arms and deny existence.

âCome in,â I managed.

And the men entered.

Together, we sat down and I asked:

âWhere did you get the coin?â

âAt Cos...â

âYou are from Cos?â

âYes, I came from Cos.â

âHe came on one of my ships,â Charaxos said.

I could not look at either man.

âHe came from Cos,â I said.

âPhaon died on the island...he and others...thrown on the
beach...we have rocky shores...he was injured in the big storm...you see, we
found him, my wife and son and I. He gave us the coin and sent me to you...he...â

So, he died after that storm, I told myself, and I got up,
wondering where I could go: I saw the castawayâs blazing eyes and torn clothing
and the greedy face of my brother:

âStay at my house...as long as you like,â I said. âI will
send servants to look after you. I will...â

What will I do? I asked myself.

Will I take the coin and sleep with it? Will it burn my bed?
Will I place it on my desk or hurl it out my window? And I opened my fingers to
see if the bronze was on fire.

Now, you have seen me grief-stricken, I thought, as I gazed
at Charaxos. You may go and tell your friends. Tell them, Sappho is beaten.
Tell them...

I excused myself and retreated to my room.

Far at sea, I saw a dot: Phaonâs ship, and I opened my hand
and laid his drachma on the windowsill.

Beauty, is he dead?

What has been gained by taking him from me?

Shall I go to Xerxes, and hold him to his promise? Couldnât
there be a misÂ­take? Better to find Xerxes and say to him, âRemember your
promise,â and take his powder. This is my inheritance, from parents, Cercolas,
friends, this degree of misfortune, final degradation. Was love a mirage, or
this?

P

Libus sat beside my bed, his hands alleviating the pain that
dragged at every nerve: his hands warmed me, crossing my back and shoulders,
assuaging with their mirage the storm that seemed everywhere inside me,
bursting my throat, my brain, my chest, shattering my reason.

Yet, as he helped me, he reasoned:

âI hoped he would be back early enough for Kleisâ
wedding...he said someÂ­thing to me about getting back early... I hoped you two
would go on...you know all of us watched you...our hearts were yours...it was
like that.

âIâve always thought your pride deserved love, Phaonâs kind,
free of politics. Yes, I know Alcaeus was sufficient, years ago; then our
island women adopted you; then Phaon. It was his luck to give you what you
needed...â

âMy coin didnât bring luck to him,â I said.

âA coin means what? Metal canât tell us about life...only we
can tell...to one another...â

âWhat have I told you through the years?â

He paused a while, hands motionless.

âBeauty...â

âAnd now?â

âAnother kind...in the making. I know your ancestral
line...losses become gain...I recognize bravery.â

His hands and thoughts continued their palliative, now the
fingers, now the voice, as servants replaced lamps and closed windows, moving
as slowly as if below the sea, finally to leave us alone again, the oceanâs
voice mixing with the crickets.

âKleis will bring Phaon back to me,â I said.

âTheirs is a curious resemblance...I agree.â

âWhat will happen to his house?â

âIt will be hers,â he said.

âBut sheâll never live in town.â

âNo...she wonât change her ways.â

âHave you ever liked his house? I havenât.â

âNo,â he said.

âLibus, why doesnât Alcaeus come to me?â

âHeâs not thinking of your problem.â

âHe doesnât know about Phaon?â

âHe knows...but canât come.â

âShall I go to him?â

âWait...for a while,â he said.

P

My girls seldom leave me: Atthis, Gyrinno, Anaktoria, each
brings flowers and gifts, bringing them surreptitiously or with a hint of
jollityâsometimes compassion. Old Exekias pats my hands, kisses my skirt or
turns away, tears unchecked.

Atthis, cheek against mine, murmurs her love. As we walk
through our garÂ­den she says:

âI miss him too... I loved him too... We placed a wreath for
him... We three have made a shrine in the woods...â

Gyrinno appears in the night, as I lie sleepless. Unable to
mention the tragÂ­edy, she whispers hoarsely that she loves me and wants to
help: Is there anything she can do for me?

Anaktoria has probed deeper:

âYou must take care, Sappho. You must do nothing strange,
that would harm us. We canât have you obsessed by melancholy. Let us look after
you.â

Eyes streaked with tears dim and I see him, imagine his body
sprawled beÂ­tween the rocks of Cos and I hear his voice speak my name: I see
our Leucadian cliff and know I could throw myself down, die as he died among
the rocks, far below.

Then, I find Kleis as I work at my loom, and her voice, revealing
her sorrow, eradicates the drama of self: the curse of death needs soft hands
and blonde hair and blue eyes and tender mouth... âMama, darling...â

Sometimes I try to brush aside feminine ties, but there they
are, tightening about me: snatches of song come to me: I see women with babies
at the founÂ­tain; vineyards creep over the hills, ascending through fog, under
the wings of gulls, moving toward me, closer and closer: they are my fatherâs
vineyards, the vineyards of Alcaeus, Phaonâs vineyards, Libusâ, Anaktoriaâs;
the bone flute, the whole island is in them, in the spring leaves and autumn leaves,
in the stark vines of winter: the weeping rock moves through them, the defeated
fleet, the red rooftops of home, the bare hills, olive trees: I see a woman,
called Sappho, leadÂ­ing a child, named Kleis: I hear shepherdâs bells, and the
silence of dawn spills up from the oceanâs shore: a porpoise and a whale,
beyond a belt of kelp, churn points of light and shadow: home, home is the red
tiles and my motherâs lamps and the view where the vineyards snuggle to sleep
for the night: this is my inÂ­heritance, to keep as long as possible, that is
what I tell myself, compel myself to feel.

Kleis has the grape leaf woven in her loom and as she weaves
she faces me and smiles and I know how much love is in that smile.

P

Sappho stands by the seaward window in her library...

carved ivory racks hold books, ancient papyri,

Egyptian clay tablets, copies of hymns.

Blue from the bay inundates the library, her face,

obliterates the books.

Alcaeus, an old man,

holds a tattered manuscript.

Mytilene, Lesbos

S

uddenly, he stood in front of me, in
my library, dressed in black, beard soiled, deep wrinkles underneath his eyes.

âAlcaeus, I didnât hear you and Thasos.â

âExekias let us in. Are you working?â

âNo...sit down.â

âAre you alone?â

âYes.â

He leaned on Thasos: I felt that he hadnât been sober very
long; he leaned forward, almost stumbling.

âCan I sit down?â

âHere, here,â said Thasos, helping him, laying aside a
package.

Silence troubled us.

I watched Thasos go and then Alcaeus said:

âI understand your loss. I understand what has happened to
you. Phaonâs death has overpowered you. I put it badly...but we have
shared...be patient...I understand...Sappho; I have brought you my Homer.
Remember, when I got it years ago? Remember? I want to share. I should have
given you this beÂ­fore...What good is it to me?â

âAlcaeus.â

âWhere is the book?â

âThe package Thasos left?â

âYes...take it...open it...â

I opened it, remembering how we had thrilled long ago, and,
after a while, reaching out to him, grateful, hoping I could make him sense my
gratitude, I kissed his forehead and his hands, his hands motionless, the
sightless eyes conÂ­fusing me.

He went on slowly:

âIâve come to share my strength...itâs a poor strength,
drunk, blind, but it does go on. You, my dear, are blinded by grief. Let me
tell you your grief canât be as bad as mine. Or, if it is, letâs
share...share...weâve shared before... Iâll take your dark away...hide it in
mine...lose some of your burden at least.

âSappho, let me help.

âAccept the old book, find hope in it... I have kicked aside
death on the field...look at my eyes and then look at yours...you need no
mirror.

âHeâs dead...dead by the sea...you have your love of beauty
to uphold you. Let it live! Give it new life! Soon enough death will claim both
of us, but, till then, letâs find comradeship...come to my house tomorrow, read
to me...

âWill you?â

I nodded, then remembered he could not see and remembered
his gift and his grace and knelt by him and put my head in his hands and
pressed between his knees, as he patted me, chuckling a little.

âIâll come tomorrow, Alcaeus,â I promised.

âGood.â

âI know your lot is worse than mine... I must find courage.â

Beauty, I thought, beauty, what can I say to help this man?

âYes, tomorrow; then Iâll tell you, Sappho... Iâll tell you
what Iâve learned, living in my black sea. How my ship drags anchor. What Iâve
heard. Iâve heard some strange things. I can sense someone moving, almost
before he moves, a shift of air, letâs say.

âWatch me play jacks with Libus, old soldiers at their fun.
I could cheat you...if you gave me half a chance.â

Again that chuckle.

The book lay open and his great arms lay across his lap,
fingers up. My father had owned that book. With age it had come unsewed and
hung in tatters: the smell of age was there: I rubbed my fingers over pages...

Quickly, he said:

âI like to feel those pages... I wanted to write a book as
full of life...give back the thunder of the storm...look how the bugs have
eaten the book...see that ripped page...well, where will you keep your Homer?â

And he smiled.

âShall I read something?â

âYes...now!â

Turning the pages so he could hear them I searched for a
favorite passage.

I read as slowly and as distinctly as possible, allowing
each word time.

P

Cercolas, mother, Aesop, Phaon...gone. When shall I go?

P

I have been unable to write for days. I have nothing to
say...there is only emptiness.

P

Yesterday a nightingale sang, a song of tattered leaves,
scraps of Nile, bits of Euphrates, papyrus against night, against impending
doom, against depression. Tender notes whispered insanity. Other notes urged
self-pity. Others shatteredâwith sheerest delicacyâany hope of contrition.

A feather drops...a pause. One could die during such a
pause.

All of us waitâlife waits!

A bubbling deceives the spirit, a trill alienates the heart.
Something summons the past, other songs on other nights, other songs of other
people, the bone flute, of course.

This was not a bird, not a beak, not a feather but sail and
spar, rigged to go at dawn, course along many shores.

âBeauty, youâre frail. Your bones are able to carry next to
nothing and yet your song travels, spreading as if a pebble had dropped on
water...â

P

I walked under olive trees along the coast, following grassy
paths, the breeze with me until I met Gogu, carrying a piece of kelp and a
shell. At first, he did not seem to recognize me. How thin, how sick he is!
Shadows of the olives shadÂ­owed him. When he spoke, I hardly listened. Each of
us is going the same way, I thought, and so we parted and stillness put its
loneliness about me. The words he had said mixed me because I had not listened,
mixed with my love-memories, adding incoherence.

Why was Gogu carrying kelp and a shell? Why was I walking
where I had ofÂ­ten walked?

In a hundred years, this path has changed little: the trees
have become more gnarled, the shadows darker, the air quieter.

The marble shrine at the end of the path crumbles year by
year and yet reÂ­mains about the same: I can remember it when another brought
me: Phaon reÂ­membered it: and now, memories are re-dedicated and burned, their
ashes under my sandals, under my fingers and heart.

P

The best of life is illusion, I do not doubt. The best of
Phaon may have been illusion.

Ah, the nettles of desire, the sleeplessness, the gnawing of
regrets in my skull. These are emotions we can not share but must suffer alone
till dawn, the dipper proving we are children.

I believe that we, as human beings, prove nothing: there is
really nothing to prove except kindness and decency: all else is more illusion.

I take my harp but there are no words to accompany the
notes. I urge Atthis to sing: play, darling, help me forget...let me see your
face as I love to see it. Move your head with that fragile alacrity. Stretch
your bare legs under your dress.

As I open the shutters in the morning, I miss him...the
ocean has grown much, much wider.

My favorite olive tree says nothing to me.

P

Alcaeus wrote me:

âI know I can help you. Come over for the day. Courage,
friend.â

The note repulsed me. What could he know of Phaon, of manâs
cleanliness and beauty!

I did not answer. Instead, I climbed the hills with Atthis
and Anaktoria, to lay a wreath at an altar that has been our shrine for a
while.

The sea was rough and the wind was rough.

Tears overcame me at the altar and I made them leave me: I hoped
to die there: I wanted my bitterness to kill me: Why couldnât it happen? Why
couldnât there be this finality?

I pulled flowers from the wreath and wrote his name on the
ground. A thrush hopped close by. The wind, gusting from the bay, scattered
blossoms and I found Atthis beside me, kneeling to comfort me. We had shared so
much, the three of us, days and weeks, grief and joy. She and Anaktoria got me
to eat, unÂ­der pines sheltered from the wind; she and Anaktoria fixed my hair.

Their sad faces made me long for happiness for their sake,
and I tried to see beyond myself. There must be a trick that I can use to
deceive others.

The placid sea carries a few boats,

small clouds on the horizon,

a series of silver catâs-paws;

and as though through a sheet

of green glass the faces of

Sappho, Atthis and Anaktoria:

a laurel wreath whirls above the Aegean:

herons fly, dolphins leap.

K

leis left her shepherdâs hut and
came here and we have talked far into the night:

âHe liked a gold cup...he liked the mountains...he liked the
cove...yes, he went farther out to sea than anyone...his sailors liked
him...he...â

Kleis stayed several days and each day was a mirror of his
personality. Her beauty brought out his quality, imaging it in various ways,
her nature shaken from its customary silence to talk of him. I recognized the
effort and appreciated the communication. I wanted to write her notes but she
could not read. I wanted to thank her in some special way but it was she who
thanked me, before slipping away.

Afterward I counted other friends: Alcaeus, Libus, Helen,
Exekias, Atthis, Anaktoria, Gyrinno, Heptha, Gogu... I also counted those who
have died. Dreaming, I counted our island, our town, our trees, mountains and
sea. I added my home. However childish to enumerate like this, I went to sleep
easily.

P

Perhaps, as I grow older, I may find an idea, a seed.
Perhaps it can grow in someoneâs mind: compassion, courage, grace, loveâit
could become one of these.

I shall continue to put down my thoughts, the handprint of
my days.

Could it be that the greatest thing in life is perseverance?

P

Somebody, I tell you,

Someone in future time

Will remember us.

We are oppressed by

oblivion, by the idea

Of nothing at all,

Yet are saved by the

Judgment of good men.

T

he sun is setting. The evening is
very warm. Across the fields I hear childrenâs voices as they play.

This evening I have been reading the
Psalms
and their
beauty fills my mind. I have decided to write my thoughts, not because I am a
psalmist, but because I hope to get closer to the meaning of life. Of course I
should have started writing long ago. When I was in the wilderness I had an
opportunity. Now, it is hard for me to find the time, and writing is not a
habit of mine and does not come easily.

However, like a shepherd, I shall gather together my
thoughts, watching for strays. In spite of vigilance my thoughts may wander.

It is pleasant sitting here at this table, the night air
blowing in; a star is caught in a tree. Peter is talking to a friend; Peterâs
voice has always pleased me, so deep.

Elul 20

Yesterday, when I was in Naim, someone pointed out a sick
man huddled in rags at a street corner. It was one of those windy days and dust
spun around us. The man reached up his arms and mumbled; I remembered seeing
him before and maybe he remembered me. I felt his hope; I felt I could help,
and I said:

âPick up your mat, get up...walk... God will help you.â

The fellow trembled. He seemed to shrink inside himself as
if afraid of me. He closed his eyes and doubled his hands. I waited and then
repeated my comÂ­mand slowly. Like someone in a dream he untangled his rags and
knelt. As he rolled his mat I encouraged him. Glancing about furtively, he
stood, tottered. I thought he would fall but he kept his eyes on mine and I
urged him to walk.

âMaster...master,â he muttered, staring about uncertainly.
âMaster...where... how can I?â

Limping, carrying his mat under one arm, he headed for the
synagogue and as I watched he began to walk easily. He threw down his mat and
began to run. Dust swirled around us and he disappeared from sight.

Later, someone told me he
had been bedridden, crippled for almost forty years. Forty yearsâhe had been
crippled longer than I had lived! Now he was walking...running... I felt such
joy, such joy, all day. I couldnât eat when I sat at the table at Peterâs; his
mother scolded me. To please her I nibbled a little fruit. I couldnât find
anyone who could share my joy so I walked alone, roamed the countryside. As I
walked I could see his tortured face, dirty beard, beggarâs clothes. Forty
years...

His name is Simeon.

Probably I will see Simeon soon. And what shall I say when
he thanks me? What can he say? I will see a changed man and that will be
enough.

Ã¿

Tishri 2

I

t seems only yesterday I was in
Nazareth yet that yesterday was years ago. Regardless of the passage of time I
feel the summer heat and hear flies buzzing. Father is at work in his shop.
Whitey comes to me and meows; sheâs scared of the thunder rumbling in the disÂ­tance;
sheâs hungry too. Mama is cooking and the smell of beef is everywhere.

Father begins to saw and sawdust spills over his feet. I
lean against a wall and sunshine spreads and I feel everything impregnate me,
the stucco, earth floor, the bench, the broken handle of the saw, Father
batting flies that try to settle on his beard. This will last forever. Caught
in the web of time we will eat supper together, before lamp lighting, and
Whitey will sit on my lap.

I recall another afternoon years agoâthe same place. But
Father is upset, talking volubly, denouncing Herod and his tyranny, an old, old
story for all of us. I have tried to deny the truth of that story but there it
is, Herodâs soldiers slaughtering innocent children, hoping to kill me. Surely
I hate the man and yet I have learned to pity his blundering.

As a boy I wandered, praying, asking understanding. The dry
hills were unÂ­communicative. If it is impossible to forgive it is possible to
look ahead. I felt too that my guilt might become a disease. I saw that the
past can have too powÂ­erful an influence.

Peterâs Home

Tishri 6

Tomorrow I am to preach on a hill... Peter says the weather
will be fine. I hope so, after windy days. For weeks we have had wind and cold.

Here, in my room at Peterâs, I am discontented. The windows
try to send me outdoors. They face cornfields and the corn is waist high, brown
and roughly swaying. I wish I could stretch out in the middle of a field, lie
there and watch the clouds and listen to the wind. I am happiest when outdoors.

The sun is down but I wonât light my candle; instead, Iâll
watch the coming night and perhaps I can summon thoughts for tomorrow; perhaps
something will talk to me in the cornfields, something I can impart. Friends
and strangers will arrive tomorrow...

Darkness has taken over and I can barely see to write...a
cricket speaks...may profound thoughts come.

Ã¿

I spoke to them on a little hill, a rocky place. It wasnât
windy or hot and we were not troubled by flies and as I stood before them,
fishermen, villagers, friends and strangers, sitting on rocks and on the
ground, on shawls and blanÂ­kets, I was deeply moved. I was specially moved by
an old woman near me who never took her eyes off me. Dressed in blue, her
clothes in tatters, her face gleamed. Wrinkled cheeks were kind. There was
kindness in her folded hands, but, most of all, it was the compassion in her
eyes, soft, tearful, blue eyes, that had searched for so long and hoped for so
long. Hers was the patience of the poor. Her spirit became my spirit as I
talked.

âBlessed are the poor...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
You are the salt of the earthâyou are the light of the world. Let your light so
shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in
heaven.

âBlessed are the meek,â I said, âfor they shall inherit the
earth. Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted...blessed are
those who hunger after justice...blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain
mercy.â

The old woman had buried her face in her hands: she was my
mother and every mother, sincerity and love, the symbol of integrity.

A breeze came and white clouds piled along the horizon. The
crowd inÂ­creased and the hill was covered with people. Shepherds approached and
held their flocks in check, listening.

â...Rejoice and be exceedingly glad,â I said to them,
â...yours is the strength of thousands...yours is the strength of the chosen,
the humble and the contrite, the pure and lowly...blessed are the lowly. Be ye
perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven...â

I tried to express my sincerity, the sincerity that began in
the desert, that has been accumulating, that is, for me, the essence of living.
I tried to speak slowly, measuring each word. By the time I was finished I was
very tired. I was glad to feel Peterâs hand on my arm and hear him ask:

âArenât you hungry?â

A lamb blundered against my legs and I stooped and picked it
up and held it in my arms, thinking of my humble birth. There was such comfort,
holding it; I felt my strength return. I thought of the stable in Bethlehem.
When I went to see it years ago nothing remained but a watering trough and a
fence. Time had also swept away the star and the Magi.

Men, women and children pressed around me, talking,
praising, asking quesÂ­tions. When I put down the lamb it dashed away.
Questionsâthere is no end to questions. I am glad and yet I am world-weary.
World thoughts oppressed me. The moon was well up before I could get away and
walk to Peterâs; as we bowed our heads at the table someone knocked on the
door.

Ã¿

Tishri 21

Sometimes people say I am an unhappy man.

That is not true.

For one thing, I like to remember happy experiences, and one
of them was the wedding at Cana. What a pleasant stroll it was, the day
temperate, the path climbing gradually above palm trees of the valley, up to
the vineyards. Birds were gossiping in the vineyards. The blue of the Jordan
flashed through oleanders. The snowy top of Hermon sent out a string of
flamingos.

At Cana, Mother greeted me. There were old friends among the
guests. Miriam was beautiful, more beautiful than I remembered. I thought of
SoloÂ­monâs song as I watched her, âThou art in the clefts of the rock; let me
see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice and thy
countenance is comely...â

After we had eaten Mother came to me and said âthere is no
more wine... Miriam is distressed...a wedding without wine!â she exclaimed,
gesturing toward the guests at their outdoor tables. Certainly it was Miriamâs
day. I thought of our friendship through the years and I decided to change
water into wine, a token to their youth and their happiness.

I called two of the servants.

âFill the water pots with water...now empty them into the
wine pitchers. There will be wine for everyone.â

âItâs good wine,â I heard someone remark.

Miriam thanked me and I hoped for acceptance on the part of
everyone. A beginning has been made, perhaps a seal or symbol had been placed
on my minÂ­istry. I tasted the wine on my lips as I walked to Peterâs. Before I
had gone any distance Andrew and Phillip criticized the miracle. They said I
could change a manâs soul as easily. They were afraid. Mother, walking with us,
defended me and ridiculed them.

Alone, I struck out across a grain field where men were
dismantling a tent; behind a stick fence donkeys brayed; day was closing behind
its fence of clouds; I felt that the men dismantling their tent were also
dismantling time.

Alone, the happiness of the wedding returned.

I tasted the wine.

Ã¿

Heshvan 3

F

ather is too old to work and I want
him to sell one of the Magi gifts, help himself and Mother. This has been a
poor carpentry season for him and for others. No use has been made of the gifts
these years but he wonât listen. He will not so much as hint where they are
stored. Where else but the synagogue? He is afraid of the wealth, of robbers...

It is easy to get him started about the Magi. His eyebrow
cocks, his head tilts, he pulls his beard and settles himself, legs crossed. He
describes camels, accoutreÂ­ments, attendants, a long, long story, growing
longer with the years. The star and the angels are always there. He beÂ­comes
eloquent like someone who had dabbled in divination.

âCasper...Melchior...Balthasar...â

Mother is pronouncing their names. She is fondest of the
Babylonian king.

â
He was tall and stately and wore a dark blue
robe. His hair and beard were snowy white...â

It was a harsh journey into Egypt, some of the time without
water, the heat so overpowering they walked at night. At an encampment,
Egyptian soldiers provided food while Mother rested a few days. A sergeant
repaired her sandals. They followed an ancient caravan route, asking for help.
They lived with Gabra nomadsâborrowing a white camel, a day or two. Father says
âshe was a real princess on that camel!â They hid in a hutment from Herodâs
men, his troops passing on maneuvers. A lone traveler gave them dates and
bread. They begged eggs at a caravanserai...a little goatâs milk...a little
meat.

Mother praised her donkey. He never refused to carry her.
For a while they stopped under sycamores where it was cool, a pond nearby. But
they were very hungry. There, under the trees, the donkey died. They thought
they would never get back to Israel. Father had the Magi gifts sewn to the
donkeyâs pad but when the animal died he had to carry everything. Utterly
disheartened, they trudged on. They got lost. There were sand storms.

Mother begged him to sell the gold cup. âItâs not mine to
sell,â he objected. But he traded Melchiorâs coins, âfor the sake of our boy.â
So they survived. Herodâs men continued to haunt them; then they learned that
he was dead.

âDespicable men do despicable things,â Father said. âRome is
the great instiÂ­gator of crimes. The
Kittim
! Political schemes are
hatched in the Forum with the wild beasts. Rome appoints a governor for
Jerusalem; the man is in exile so he devours us, his subjects.â

Last night I lay awake most of the night, haunted by these
ghosts. The past can be a simoom. Maybe it is a good thing when todayâs
problems wipe out yesÂ­terdayâs problems. When the oil in the lamp burned out I
tried to find oil in the storage shed. There was no more. At dawn I read my
favorite psalms.

Ã¿

A thousand hoplites marched through our town. Drums. Horns.
Thud of spears.

Many people fled.

Last month the hoplites caused a riot in Naim.

I am unable to countenance such hirelings. I am unable to
countenance miliÂ­tary death.

Ã¿

Friends are still troubled by my miracle at Cana. As a group
of us walked to Jerusalem their annoyance went on and on.

In Jerusalem I was annoyed by the bellowing of cattle, the
bleating of sacrifiÂ­cial sheep. An ox screamed. Dust rose from underfoot as I
jostled turbaned men... A woman in a striped veil blocked my way.

Passing Herodâs temple I searched for sky. Men had worked
for years to build that templeâwas it for dust and smoke?

At the temple I stood among money exchange tables and
listened to men haggle. A strange, dark, bestial man lorded over everyone. At
an ivory-topped table men quarreled and spat. A sacrificial trumpet shrilled. I
grabbed my
taliss
, the one Father gave me. Knotting it into a whip I
struck the money from a table. Coins spun. An exchanger howled. I lashed
another table, upset it, then another. A crowd jeered as I demanded that they
honor the temple.

âThis is manâs place of worship. You offend God. Look, what
youâre doing... take your money away...you know our temple is sacred. Godâs
temple is a temple of peace.â

Later, when a judge demanded an explanation, I saw my own
disrespect, my own violence. He was a lanky, stone-like figure, grey-haired,
grey-faced, palsied. He understood my rebellion, the rankling perturbations of
my life.

âIâm a Greek,â he said. âI realize your alienation. Iâm new
here. I have much to learn. When a man revolts there is usually well-grounded
reason. But be careÂ­ful! The next time there may be fines or punishment;
another man may not be lenient.â

Ã¿

Heshvan 9

That night, after scourging the temple, I dreamed of home: I
was working at the carpenterâs bench, making a three-legged stool. I finished
smoothing the legs and sat on the floor, Whitey beside me. She was playing with
a heap of shavings.

Again I had that illusion that time was mine, that the
sunshine and flies and smell of olive oil and earth would never leave me. And I
thought, as I worked on the stool, how pleased Mother would be when I finished
it for her birthday. I glanced at a mark on the wall and wondered if I had
grown taller.

Ã¿

Galilee

A storm. The lake. Two fishermen drowned. Tents blown over.
Next day as I bury the dead a little girl comes and throws herself at my feet,
a flower clutched in her hand. What does death mean to her?

Ã¿

Heshvan 11

Wearing dirty work clothes I was readily admitted into the
prison at Machaerus, a citadel high above the countryside. Guards shrugged as I
entered. A door clanged with a terrible crash: I was in Johnâs cell. Kissing
me, hugging me, we embraced: as always I felt he was part of me.

âHow are you, cousin? I thought we would never get to see
each other again...in all those rags they didnât know you. You chose a good
time; there has been an ugly quarrel going on...we have new guards. Here, here,
sit by me.â

John has been imprisoned five months and is chained to the
wall, a loop around one leg, letting him move a few feet. Rattling the chain,
he nodded and grinned at me. I did not understand what he whispered. When he
was certain we were alone he grasped his chain and forced it open, first one
link and then anÂ­other. Though he had been a wrestler and farmer I was amazed.
Free, he clasped me in his arms.

âItâs a great trick...nobody knows...I can get up at night
and walk around... maybe thereâs a way to get out of here.â

How often we have been taken for brothers because of our red
hair; we trim our beards the same way; our faces are much alike except that
mine is leaner. We were brothers as we talked, sitting on the stone floor, the
chain between us.

John urged me to leave Capernaum.

âYou canât go on preaching there. Antipas has men on the
lookout for you. Heâs as cruel as Herod, you know that! Go in hiding for a
while, Jesus. Thereâs no good in it if both of us end up in chains. Our
ministry will fail.â

I had concealed bread and fruit in my clothes but John would
not eat while I was there. I gave him a comb and he combed his beard and head,
grimacing, laughing. I asked him to change clothes with me: âYou can put me in
chains,â I said.

An empty cell, stone walls, chains, the Dead Sea glistening
dozens of feet below, a cold floor, a little food...what could I do?

âAre there other prisoners on this floor, John?â

âI never see them... Iâm not allowed outside.â

âYou know that we are trying to free you.â

âDonât run any risks.â

âWe arenât afraid.â

âI have enough to eat...time to pray.â

âWe need you.â

He bowed in prayer.

To be born anew
...that is our hope for mankind.

I went away embittered. Think of it, I left a comb and some
bread and fruit for a great man, a man of God. As I walked through the night I
heard and re-heard those words:

âMay the Lord bless thee and keep thee, the Lord make His
face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up His
countenance and give thee peace.â

Peace inside stone walls.

When shall John and I meet again?

Ã¿

Peterâs

Heshvan 19

I have preached in the synagogues at Cana and Capernaum
during the last few days. I do not like preaching indoors. The sky is best and
weeds and grass make the best floor. Old laws become new laws outdoors. I
stress repentance and faithâthe time is now at hand. I try to speak with
authority and yet avoid rigid precepts.

Usually I walk alone. Being alone, from time to time, is
essential: there is a peace in the company of oneâs own shadow. After every
meeting I am again surrounded by questioners, most of them respectful, some are
quite idle and oblivious of anything but themselves.

At Capernaum, as I spoke, swallows flew in and out, swooping
low. I wonÂ­dered, as I watched them, are we the interlopers, have we usurped
their place? For me birds epitomize the highest form of beauty.

Near Capernaum I met an officer as I rested under trees
along the road. His horse was lathered with sweat and the man was tired; he
leaned forward in the saddle and eyed me critically, in silence. I asked him to
dismount and rest.

Joining me he said he had heard of my miracle at the wedding
and my cure of the street beggar. He brushed dust off his immaculate uniform.
Wiping his face he scrutinized me, then pled with me to come and heal his son
who was, acÂ­cording to his doctor, dying of fever. I shared fruit and he
introduced himself; he admitted he had sought me as a last resort. I pitied the
young father, fond of his only child, yet so skeptical. Rising nervously,
catching his horseâs bridle, he urged me to go to his home.

âI canât wait any longer... You donât seem to understand
that my son is dying. Ride to Capernaum. Take my horse. Ride...help my boy.
Master, cure him...he has been ill with a terrible fever...for days... I must
find help if you canât help...â

âRide home,â I said. âYour son will live; from this very
hour he will improve. Ride home in peace...do not hurry... God has answered
your plea, our prayers.â

I felt my faith attend the boy as he lay in bed. For a
little while he became my sonâthe son I would never have. I blessed him. My
faith, Godâs grace, would renew the child. My power was adequate. I did not
need to travel to Capernaum.

Never looking back, the officer rode off, dubious, angry. A
breeze clattered dry leaves above me.

I knelt in prayer.

Ã¿

I am troubled because there are so many sick in the world.

Capernaum...Capernaum...the village might be all mankind.

Here I healed the mother of my host, a woman gravely ill of
seizures. I had hardly helped her and finished my dinner when people clamored
at the door, the demented as well as the sick.

Still riding his bay, the officer found me and assured me
his son was recovÂ­eringâhis ardent gratitude was so bewildering, so nervous. As
we talked in the courtyard of my hostâs home people jostled him. He tried to
send them away, to establish a sense of intimacy with me.

Walking through the town at dusk I touched this one, spoke
to another. A sense of anonymity troubled me: it was everywhere. The exultant
friends, the overjoyed crowd, forced me to retreat. As I closed the door of the
house I obÂ­served Roman soldiers. I asked to be left alone. I ate supper alone.
Early in the morning, shortly after dawn, I slipped away to the hills.

Ã¿

Peterâs

Simeon came. We sat on stools and he thanked me, tears in
his eyes. Clean, wearing new clothes, a little shawl around him, he related how
thrilling it was to be able to move about, to âreally walk.â He explained what
it had been to be âa stone in the street, a stone to spit on.â Eyes burning, he
made me know what it was to be forsaken, abused, hungry.

He says he has told others of his cure. Only a few mockers
doubt. Friends and strangers visit his house, to touch him. He imitated poking
hands. Simeon is a pathetically handsome man, still frail, his frailty
accenting his features. âMy cousin Ephriam has promised me a job,â he said.

âIâm fifty-three but youâve made me young. My memory is
coming back. Everything tastes good...â

Ã¿

I believe my faith will help people because it is a faith of
hope, a faith that conquers obstacles; it is a faith based on patience and
kindness. We have no right to kill, no right to inflict pain. Ours is the gift
of understanding, contentment. Ours is the honoring of simplicity and honesty.

Sun on the hills is a kind of faith...the vineyard that
endures is another...the wounded heron struggling on...childbirth
pain...fishermen drying their nets on the beach...

Our Father Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name...

He is our guide, Father of us all, brother of us all, master
of all. Seek and you will find. Our kingdom is at hand.

Ã¿

Kislev 2

I

Â have been reading a scroll, an
ancient one.

I write outdoors, on a table, under olives.

As I speak in public I become more and more a master of
words. I detect the difference in just a month or so. I am encourÂ­aged. I no
longer have to think what I do with my hands and arms, how I stand. Thoughts
flow.

Going from place to place I see the same heads. The sun
streams over us at the benediction. The passion of living is obvious, touching
each of us, offering kinship and peace.

Salt of the earth...

Ã¿

John is the salt of the earth and yet he writes me that he
has been beaten by his guards. Several times I have returned to Capernaum to
visit Joseph, the young officer. He has promised to use his influence to free
John. How wary he is of becoming involved with the prison authorities. In
Jerusalem my intercessions are ridiculed: John is branded treasonous.

Authorities are evasive or antagonistic. They ridicule our
wish to uplift the world. I am told to take care.

Guards at the citadel refused to allow me to visit John.

Written requests go unanswered.

Peter, James and Matthew are no luckier than I.

Ã¿

A finch is watching me as I write under the olives.

Rain is threatening.

Conception. Birth. Death. Each is a mystery.

In my fatherâs house I grew up among mysteries. I heard them
talked, argued over, curtly dismissed. I have resented the unknowns, yet to
plumb them is still beyond me. Each child is a mystery. The temple is a
mystery. The shell that I pick up on the beach has its mystery. Some say I am a
man of mysteries. Does the turtle have its mysteries?

Ã¿

Kislev 5

For days I have been too busy and preoccupied to
writeâpreaching often, healing often. I am writing in a borrowed tent; James
and Mark are asleep inside.

Yesterday, on the lake shore, I was circled by a crowd. I
talked to them till late. I wish to record the promises I made them:

Verily, I say unto you, he that
believeth in me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers
ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead. I am living bread. If any man eat of
this bread he shall live forever.

In keeping with my promise I passed out bread and fish in
baskets. I blessed the food and there was an abundance for everyone, many of
them hungry chilÂ­dren.

Mark and James and Phillip passed the baskets till each was
fed, the fish and bread always sufficient. At parting I reminded the people of
the deeper meaning but some were overwhelmed by the miracle. A youngster ran
about shouting: âHe made the bread...he made the fish...with his own hands.
Jesus made...â

A strange restlessness troubled almost everyone.

Phillip, Andrew and I strolled along a white path, as white,
in the moonlight, as if made of crushed shells. Galilee was flat and silvery.
Andrew continued to comment about the âbread and fishâ at almost every turn of
the path. His youthÂ­ful, enthusiastic face warned me, warned me that youth is
irresponsible. What is the proper age for wisdom? As for miracles is there a
miracle surpassing the miracle of faith?

Ã¿

Peter has made me a tent. It is dark green, and big enough
for two. The tent pole is an antique shepherdâs staff. A charioteer and a
number of untranslatable characters have been carved on the wood.

âPapa gave me that staff long ago. He said it is Assyrian.â

I can carry the tent comfortably and the staff is never out
of my hands.

Last night I dreamed I was a treeâa cedar tree.

âDonât cut me down,â I begged. âI am shade...I am the home
of birds.â

I sat underneath the tree and fell asleep. I slept inside a
dream.

John is dead. Murdered.

He has been beheaded.

The world has lost a voice of reason. I have lost my best
friend. He was beÂ­headed at a drunken orgyâhis head was displayed like a trophy
at the palace. What desecration, abuse, folly, horror. I can barely
write...sorrow...resentment... my mind whirls to the days we passed together in
the desert, our wilderness comradeship. His faith was my faith. Our bonds were
those of true brotherhood.

I should have been able to free him. Instead I gave him
dried fruit and a comb. The letters I wrote did nothing. My petitions were
disregarded. I was too patient. I have sat in this room all day...nothing has
come of my sorrow but more sorrow. Peter and James and Mark have had their say.

Late in the evening friends arrived, wanting to plan his
burial. Permission has been granted: we are to be permitted to claim his body.
It is best to have the sacred privilege of farewell. We tell each other that we
must succeed for his sake, man of poverty, prison and death.

For his sake we can burn our lamps and candles and share
late communion, get up early, walk many leagues and extol his faith. We will
tell it on the hills and in the towns and in the villages. I feel his
wrestlerâs hand tighten on my shoulder.

Ã¿

Kislev 12

We brought John to the ancient rocky crypts, a dozen of us.
Some of us wound scarves around our faces. Mother suspected that we were
followed. She insisted on two to act as guards.

Simon was there... Matthew, Peter, Luke, Mark...they helped
us lay John outÂ­side his crypt, helped us cut stone. A torch burned Markâs arm;
someone smashed our hammer. âWork fast,â someone was constantly urging. Peter
got defiant: âLet the Romans come,â he shouted. âWe have a right to bury our
dead.â Luke had to calm him. It was dawn before we had the crypt sealed; we
were cut and bruised. No torches.

As I sat among the cliff rocks I tried to obliterate the
tragedy, tried to refute his death. Hard to breathe. Hard to utter the final
prayer. Think of it...we had buried a headless man, friend, friend...

As we stole into town we met the
Kittim
officer,
riding for Capernaum; he did not recognize me of course. What a stark figure! I
wanted to talk to him about his son but Mother begged me: we must not trust
him.

She railed against wickedness and power.

Luke left us, to care for a sick man.

As we walked, Mother leaned on a stick. Her wrinkled face
made me aware that the star of long ago was not around.

At Matthewâs home we talked of Johnâs betrayal.

Perhaps we should be somewhat mad to combat manâs madness:
we must chop up the two thousand crucifixes, chop them into pieces for firewood
and with that firewood we shall bake our breadâour
pita
. Crucified bread
is the bread of the poor, the waiting, waiting poor. God must help them; we
must help them; we must help them as we must help God. Heal. Lift up our eyes.

Ã¿

Nazarethâhome

Kislev 20

When I picked corn in a field with my disciples I was
reproved because it was Sunday. When I healed the withered arm of a man I was
rebuked because it was Sunday. I am threatened by various authorities for such
âmisdemeanors.â Men spy on me and plot against me for acts of kindness.
Kindness has reached the level of a crime. Officials remind me, rather
discreetly, that John met a tragic death. The Sadducees hate me.

At the pool of Bethseda I helped a man who could not get
into the water: I brought him health. He had been a paralytic for years. A cry
went up because this was on a feast day. I explained that I intended to carry
out my work regardless of the day.

âThe son of man is lord even on the Sabbath,â I said. âThe
world of kindÂ­ness must be a part of our world.â

At Nazareth, as I preached on a hill, the crowd turned on
me. They insisted I perform miracles for them. Angered that I would not respond
willy-nilly, men attempted to throw me off the cliffside of the hill. James,
Mark and Phillip proÂ­tected me; the four of us climbed down the cliff to a
wadi.

Disgusted, Father feels I have gone out of my mind. He longs
for the peace of my boyhood days. Mother understands: her feeling is intuitive.
Though I disÂ­appoint and worry her she hides her concern, offering
encouragement. She visits those I have healed and tells me how they have
changed. Not all are like Simeon, grateful. Some do not want to have anything
to do with me.

Ã¿

Peterâs

Kislev 22

As I write Peter leans over my shoulder, reading this record
that is such a poor record. In the midst of my writing I see Johnâs face; I
hear him. We talk about him.

âThe Romans are going to take you, one of these days! What
can I do to look after you? All of us...what can we do? Look at that madman the
other day. He rushed at you... I thought he would kill you...he had a knife.
And you cured his madness. There...there, he became one of us...or so it seems.
Luke wants to help me look after you. You canât go on without any thought for
yourself!â

Peterâs voice expresses sincerity, warmth, education. Speech
is manâs finest quality. More than the eyes, the smile. Its powers are almost
limitless. Its tenderÂ­ness, the child, the babe. My mother consoles with a word
perhaps. Out of the past it goes on and on with its revelations, its mirages.

Peter crumples leaves in his hands and reminisces as we sit
around a table, the door open, his dog lying outside, flumping his tail
agreeably.

â...No, Papa wasnât a clever fisherman. When Mama died he
didnât look after our house; it didnât much matter to him what we had to eat.
He seemed to be looking for her. I tried to light his lamp but it didnât work.
He got very thin, weak; he coughed. I did all the fishing for us. I provided
but I didnât do a very good job... I miss him...it was good to have him there,
even when he was sick...â

Peterâs

Tevet 4

I

n this little, comfortable house
I try to find time in the evenings to study Greek or write in my journal. I
prefer my journal. Doors wide open, the lamp bright, I read or write. My legs
get restless, my eyes blink and the next thing I know the lamp has burned out
and my room is dark.

The other night, after tossing on my pallet, I dreamed that
a woman came and brought an antique alabaster box and knelt beside meâto anoint
my feet. I tried to say something to her but I couldnât speak. The woman was
beautiful.

Suddenly I was standing on a hill. A man was near me; there
was nobody else. The man began repeating a parable, imitating me, each word
curiously vivid. He said:

âThere was a creditor who had two debtors. One owed his
master five hunÂ­dred but the other owed fifty.â The speaker stopped, adjusted
his purple robe. âWhen their master forgave them their debts who was the most
grateful? The one who owed the most or the one who owed less?â

Someone laughed uproariously.

Ã¿

Ah, the strictures of the mind: without discipline
we
are weak. As a boy I learned values. I
learned how to accept and how to refute. I remember holding a scroll against
the light in the doorway of the synagogue: I noted how carefully each word was
written. Pen strokes. Such a frail thing, this wisdom.

I found other kinds of wisdom on a dune, at a desert pool,
in an oasis.

Ã¿

Tevet 5

For days I have been trying to compose a meaningful prayer.
I have trudged along the shore at Galilee; I have listened to the waves and
gulls. I have tried to find words suitable for fisherfolk, villagers,
countrymen. I walked the wadis, climbed the cliffs. I have lain in my tent and
peered at the stars. I have repeated scriptures. Talked.

Last
night, after supper, the words came to me:

Our Father Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name,

Thy will be done,

on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread, forgive us our trespasses,

lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil

for Thine is the kingdom,

the power and the glory, forever.

When I repeated the prayer to Luke and Peter they were
pleased.

Ã¿

Galilee

Tevet 11

A storm woke me as I lay in my tent. The wind was churning
leaves and I walked to the lake to watch the waves. I felt cold but pulled my
cloak around me and continued walking. Clouds were traveling fast. When the
rain started I reÂ­traced my steps. I heard voices and men at their oars. Waves
were piling against rocks. The voices in the boat sounded familiar. Again the
thud of oars. Yells. Wasnât that Phillip? It was Peter. Through rain and spray
I made out the hull of the boat; then I recalled someone saying they had to
land a catch before dawn. Someone shouted:

âWeâre sinking...weâre sinking!â

I walked over the water toward the boat; it was difficult to
see through the rain and spray. I recognized the boat. As I walked the waves
calmed; the water was black underfoot. Two of our men had slumped over their
oars. I shouted. Nobody responded: they were frightened at seeing me. Peter
cowered. I called again.

âPeter,â I cried. â Donât you know me?â

âIs it you, Jesus?â

âYes.â

âLet me come to you.â

âCome,â I said.

He sank as he walked toward me and I caught his arm and
steadied him and helped him climb into his boat. Luke welcomed me. The boat
swung toward me and I got in and sat at the stern with Phillip. Everyone began
bailing. The rain was letting up and I pointed to the shore. We soon beached
her and everyone began to talk, telling his panic, that they had been unable to
see; they crowded around me; they thought I had saved their lives.

Luke built a fire of beachwood and as the sun came up we had
breakfast toÂ­getherâsome of them singing, everyone hungry, the fish tasting
marvelous.

âMark broke his oar,â Luke said and laughed. He was drying
by the fire, his clothes steaming. He explained that they had been blown first
one way and then another.

Ã¿

Nain

Tevet 18

This has been a beautiful week because I raised a man from
the dead and made a blind man see.

At Nain, a small village, my disciples and I met a burial
procession headed for tombs cut in the side of a nearby hill. A young man lay
on a flower-covered bier. I learned his name from a man in the procession: it
was David. He and his mother had been my friends for years. I recognized
Athalia walking behind the bier, weeping. Aaron, her husband, had died
recently.

It was a warm, still afternoon. The warbling of a bulbul
seemed out of place as the procession passed. As the bier scraped against a
rock, as the bearers stopped, I approached one of them and asked them to wait.

âDavid...David...this is Jesus...arise...â

The disciples, astonished, bunched around the bier. I
touched David, spoke loudly, shook him.

âDavid, you are all right. Your mother is here. Get up...â
He sat up among his flowers and his mother rushed to his side. He recognized my
voice and asked for me. I talked gently with him.

A happy procession. The bier was abandoned; someone threw
flowers into the air as David walked...

I am overjoyed as I write. I see David and his mother
kissing each other. Someone is singing.

From Nain I went on to see the daughter of Jairus as she lay
in bed in her home. The curtains were drawn; the air was sick room air; flowers
had wilted on her bed table; her dog cringed under her bed. I asked everyone to
leave us alone.

â
Talitha cumi
,â I said. âDaughter, I say arise...you
are no longer ill. The fever has left you.â As I prayed I also thought of John
and his death. This little girl was not to fill a grave. I bent over her and
took her hand. I could see her rolling a hoop, laughing.

â
Talitha cumi
,â I repeated, and sat beside her,
pressed my hand over her foreÂ­head, touched her eyelids. âRise, my
daughter...you must sleep no longer...â

Her eyes flashed; she was afraid because she had never seen
me; smiling, I said:

âYour mother is outside your room...shall I call her?â She
nodded.

When I came to the blind man in his home I pressed my
fingers over his eyes and spoke to him. I wet clay and placed it over his eyes.
I allowed the cool clay to comfort him as I spoke; his wife watched with an
expression of doubt; as I removed the clay she stepped aside.

He made a curious noise, pushed me aside, stood.

Walking, he asked:

âIs this my home...is that my garden out there? Are you the
man called Jesus of Nazareth? That must be a tree out there...â He was walking
into the garden of his home. âIs that...is that a bird...who are the people
watching me...and that, is that a flower?â

I write and the evening sun shines on my table and on my
hands and it seems to me that I have lived many years in a short span; it seems
to me I am very much alone; it seems to me I hear voices: Deuteronomy voices,
Jeremiah voices. I hear and yet I am alone. Today is my birthday. I am
thirty-three.

Ã¿

Shevat 8

A

s a boy I respected Greekâsuch a
rich vocabulary, I found; I thought the language overly concise. Hebrew is the
city manâs tongue, best suited to argument. I prefer my Aramaic. It is more
gracious and agreeable for public speaking.

Haran believed in learning three languages: he was the most
intelligent rabbi I have met. To him I owe my background; his years of tutoring
gave me freedom to think. Morning after morning we sat facing each other at his
home.

âWe have to think, not memorize...you memorize and then
force memories to evolve into patterns of original thought. Yes, memory and
thought are brothÂ­ers. But, make no mistake, thousands repeat the law and the
scriptures and only a handful think.â

I see his sparsely bearded, wan face. He was a man who ate
sparingly yet lived to be eighty. A great walker, he was as restless in body as
in mind.

Haran was proud of two ancient scrollsâone of them on
copper. The library at Qumran had greater rarities of course.

Haran said:

âSomething lives in you...your mother has called my
attention to it, an inner voice. When I heard you declaim in the synagogue I
perceived it.â

So, it is my privilege to help, merge dream and fulfillment:
I believe it is a privilege no other man has had: I am the husbandman.

Come unto me ye who labor and are
heavy laden and I will give you rest...suffer the little children to come...

Tonight I see the world shining in their eyes; I hear hope
in their prattle.

Ã¿

Tent

Shevat 12

Years ago I experienced the greatness of the Sinai desert,
its crags and dunes, the heat and cold. I came to understand its desolation,
its loneliness, its calm and fury. Now, during these troubled times, I long to
return to the Sinai...have a lizard sit beside me, my straw-covered basket
filled with golden dates.

In the Sinai I perfected my Greek to a greater extent and
studied the classical Hebrew until it came easily. The history of man became an
important part of my meditations. Silence and the simoom became part of those devotions.

A tiny plant sprouted outside my tent and withstood the
heat, cold and winds. It was my companion and incentive, a little calendar in
leaves.

I found the same plant growing at Qumran, behind the
monastery. While I studied there it survived several sand storms.

Ã¿

Locusts, dates, bread, honeyâthe wilderness taught me the
true taste of food. During the months since the wilderness I have eaten well,
too well, but the taste is lacking.

I have not thought as clearly as I thought when unencumbered
by men. There, each morning was mine, each evening was mine. Worship was as
natural as breathing.

My tent flaps billowed. They were pinned back every night by
the stars. Heat and thirst were often there yet a sense of praise was foremost.
Wonderment was on top of a dune. As I slept a mirage might come and bathe me in
its cool water.

I slept on my boyhood blanket, one woven by my mother. She
wove it when I was ten.

Ã¿

Nazareth

Shevat 15

I am leaving Nazarethâleaving home.

It is farewell to friends and places, all I have loved. Only
in memory will I walk along the orchard creek and hunt for crayfish, think and
stare as a boy thinks and stares. I had several pals... We had niches in cliffs
where we often hid. We had an old fig we liked to climb; there was a cave where
we lit fires. We found menhirs and dolmenâstrange, strange things! In Galilee
we had a stout little boat and weâd drift, drop anchor, fish for chromis and
watch the pelicans.

Thereâs a feeling to my Nazareth: the stars are brighter
there, the sun seems a little bigger, the wind a little cooler. How good it was
to turn a corner and think: Mamaâs home...supper is almost ready...Papaâs
working in his shop.

Ã¿

Nazareth

Shevat 20

Today was cool and windy.

I visited Simeon. I visited Mark. I visited Jude. I called
on the captain, who has been transferred to Nazareth. His son sat in my lap a
while. I did not say good-bye although I lingered at each place. I wanted to
feel the peace of each place and keep it with me. I did not need to talk much.
Being with friends was all I asked.

Oh, how the wind blew me along, flapping my cloak, flapping
the olive branches, the weeds and the papyrus.

How hard it is to write.

Ã¿

Nazareth

Before I left home Father displayed the gifts of the Magi on
his work bench, first removing his tools and shavings. He locked the door and
lit two candles. Motherâso excitedâseemed to be seeing the star as she handled
the gifts.

âThey havenât changed... Joseph, youâve taken good care of
them! Oh, theyâre so beautiful!â

And she knelt in the sawdust, the gold cup in her hands, its
jewels redder than I had remembered. I had forgotten the gifts were so
beautiful.

âWhere have you kept them...in the synagogue? The geniza?â I
asked.

Father nodded, frowning.

âWe have decided to present them to the elders...tomorrow...at
the meeting. Theyâll become the temple possessions. Itâs different with you
going away... Mother and I have decided...â

But I wasnât listening; I was absorbed in Motherâs
appreciation as she hanÂ­dled the gifts, kneeling or half-kneeling, smiling; her
shoulders lost some of their age. The myrrh box interested me, its aroma still
evident, its chased lid yet untarÂ­nished. Mother lifted the clasp. The clasp
was set with green stones. She called my attention to the ornamented hinges.
She held out the gold cup to my father...

âI wish you hadnât worried about the gifts,â she said with a
sigh. âWe ought to have enjoyed them...now we can see them at the temple...
Look, Jesus, at this handle...ah, those were strange days in Bethlehem... God
was with us...â

I loved her for her dreams and sacrifices.

I loved the hints of youth and beauty in her face.

Ã¿

Nazareth

Shevat 25

Tomorrow is my last day here.

As I lay on my pallet I heard rain lash our roof; I heard
the wind in the trees. Then my mind dropped back and I remembered Mother
singing, crooning to me, as I lay sick as a boy. I remembered songs in the
evening. I heard her laughÂ­ter as we played jacks. I smelled her barley
bread... I smelled roasting lamb.... Father was in his workshop, his plane
sliding; he was singing. As a child I loved his singing.

Now, silent, worried, he works in a preoccupied state,
bothered by frequent visitors, concerned about my future. âIt is wrong of you
to go to Jerusalem, wrong to throw yourself into the hands of your enemies.â

There will be no more Festivals of Light.

Ã¿

At Nazareth I used to have a pet goat.

Memories... I can not tolerate juvenile memories any longer.
I am not an old man. Memories must not impede my ministry.

There must be beauty. Life must have beauty.

Ã¿

Jerusalem

Shevat 29

Thy rod and Thy staff will comfort
me...yeah, though I walk through the valley of death yet will I be with Thee.

As I walked into Jerusalem I heard those words. It was dusk.
An immense caravan choked the air, camels, drivers, gapers. Again I thought of
Herod and the innocents: city life brings Herod to mind. The
Kittim
are
evident on the main streets: helmets, standards, shields.

A camel sank to the ground beside me, eying me, begging
for kindness. Trumpets blared.

Crowds circled the temple, some chanting, some bearing
fruit, some waving palm fronds. Flares burned. On two giant candelabra, perhaps
eighty feet high, torches smoked, guttered.

Shall I be able to help the people of Jerusalem? Shall I
remain? My loneliness here was so unlike the loneliness of the desert.

I was to meet Judas who was to take me to friends. When he
did not come I bedded down in a booth of branches, with cattle nearby.

I slept and woke to their animal sounds, without dread.
Someone roused the oxen, then the sheep; the beasts wanted to be fed and
watered. Nobody disÂ­turbed me. Probably I was considered a herdsman. I dreamed
until a child brought me a cup of water: holding it out prettily she asked:
âAre you thirsty?â

âYes,â I said.

âMy papa is taking care of the oxen.â

Opening my pouch I offered sugared dates to the girl.

Ã¿

I found Judas at the home of a mutual friend. I had never
seen him so well dressed. He drew me aside and gave me money from our treasury.
He seemed forlorn. I am told he is having a love affair with the daughter of
Pilate. Marcus, the son of a senator, has described Pilateâs daughter as a
beautiful, talented, ruthless woman. Marcus and I sat on a garden bench and he
enÂ­thused about Jerusalem: âSo unlike Rome, so much more orientalâcan it be we
are free of our penates here?â

That evening I stayed in the house of Leonidas Clibus. My
windows were olive tree windows. Garden paths circled a tiny fountain where
someone had tossed fresh oleander blossoms, red blossoms.

A copy of Horace lay on a circular table by my bed; lamps
and rugs, hangings and x-shaped Roman chairs, cushions and inlaid boxes
brightened the room. Propped on a cushion I read Horace for hours; when my
candles dimmed a slave brought me fresh candles and volumes by Lucretiusârecent
translations.

...Whatâs this wanton lust for life

To make us tremble in dangers and in doubt?

All men must die and no man can escape.

We turn and turn in the same atmosphere...

I went to sleep preferring the thoughts of Horace: his love
of nature, his fondness for rustic surroundings, his boating on the river
Aufidus, his fishing. He liked to play ball. I could visualize him, as a boy,
when wood pigeons covered him with leaves as he slept on a hillside.

Ã¿

Clibusâ Home

Adar 6

T

here are children here. What priceless
looks they give. I love their delight in simple things, their warmth, their
trust, so obvious, so quick. Truly, theirs is a special kingdom. I am happiest
when they are around me, as they were yesterÂ­day in Clibusâ garden. It was a
birthday party for his daughter who is six. I told stories as they sat around
me. What laughter, giggles. A little boy brought me a toad and put it in my
hand, saying:

âItâs for you, Atta.â

Ã¿

Clibus

Of course I miss the great library at Qumran. The beautiful
library in his home is a fraction of that monastic collection but bearded
Clibus has invited meâwith widespread arms.

A delicate bronze of Minerva stands on a plinth at the
window end of the narrow room.

A book on my lap, I watched a golden Persian cat steal
about, stiffly indeÂ­pendent.

Though I can not read Latin I can understand titles and the
names of authors and I appreciate handsome volumes, ancient volumes, family
treasures.

Minerva
âI used to think of visiting Rome and Athens.

Ã¿

Adar 15

I spoke to a group near the city gate. I was aware that
officials were present, Sadducees.

I saw men dragging a woman, kicking her, letting her fall.
She had been caught in adultery. When she was brought to me I suspected a
trick. Why should I pass judgment when officials were in the crowd? Authorities
wanted me to break the law by passing judgment.

I was shocked by the womanâs fear, her beseeching face. As
she stood by me a soldier hit her with a chain. Men yelled: âStone her, stone
her!â When a man shoved her to her knees she hid her face in her armsâpretty, a
country girl, I thought.

To give myself time to think I wrote on the ground with a
stick. I wrote and obliterated words, watching the crowd and the woman. I
smelled death. It was in the smoke of sacrifices burning in the city. It was in
the crowd around me. I had never smelled the death of a person.

Taking in the street ruffians and the officials I said, in a
loud voice:

âLook
at her, at her torn clothes. Do any of you know her? Think. Go deep inside.
Think. Let the man who has not sinned throw the first stone. You accuse
her...where is the man? Go home, all of you. Have you no pity? Remember the
commandment: Thou shalt not kill. We are not animals! Let her go... I repeat,
let her go. Go homeâall of you!â

I helped the woman to stand. Someone had thrown ashes on her
face and I bought water at a shop and washed her face and hands and bought oil
for her cuts and bruises. Matthew found us and brought her food.

âWhere can I hide?â she asked us. âWhat is to become of me?
They will catch me...beat me... Master, master...what shall I do?â Her words
mixed with sobs.

Matthew and I helped her out of town, beyond the gates. We
sent her to the home of Talus where Luke cares for the sick.

Ã¿

I returned to Clibusâ library but I was too disturbed to read.
While I sat there, the
Sayings of Moses
spread before me, Affti, Clibusâ
Egyptian wife, brought a pillow and sat by me. She is as beautiful as Miriam;
to have her there was a comÂ­fort but her words were not comforting:

âIt isnât safe for you to preach in Jerusalem... Your faith
is for the little towns and villages where the Romans have less influence or
none at all...

âWhen James was here a month or so ago he mentioned going to
Rome. Do you wish him to preach your gospel there?â

She went on to urge me to send apostles to Egypt.

âThere are more than seventy of you now... I hope you can
send two or more to my country...to preach in the villages...you are needed
there.â

That evening, after dinner, she rapped on my door: she is
very tall, very eleÂ­gant; dressed in an Egyptian gown, she made a little bow,
and presented me with a bronze stylus.

âIt will be better than your wooden one,â she said.

While enjoying my stylus someone brought me a dish of lemon
paste.

Ã¿

Sadly, more than twenty years have passed since our Nazareth
synagogue acÂ­quired a scroll. Our scrolls are in tatters and all are asked to
refrain from using them. Learning this, Clibus has offered several scrolls.

âIâll send two of my men...one to carry the scrolls, the
other to see that the first man doesnât wander off.â

Perhaps little Nazareth may have a worthwhile collection
someday.

Ã¿

Jerusalem

Adar 20

My enemies come closer.

Verily, I say unto you, the man
who climbs the sheepfold wall is a thief. He who enters by the gate is the
shepherd. To him the porter opens and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his
sheep by name and leads them...

My parable is realistic but people do not listen. They push
one another, talk.

When I encountered a blind man, a man who had never seen
during his lifeÂ­time, I sent him to the Siloam pool. He bathed there and at my
touch his sight became normal. He stumbled, fell, rushed about, shouted.
Trembling he raced for home. He brought friends and there was great rejoicing.
Then, stunning everyone, authorities questioned me rudely. Because he defended
me and called me his healer he was put in jail.

I had to go before the local magistrate, affirm his honesty;
then he was freed. I said to the magistrate:

âI came into this world to help men see...â

Ã¿

Last week I cured lepers on the Jericho road, men and women,
all in rags. All were afraid of me, afraid of themselves. I thought I could
change their minds but their minds were in tatters like their clothes. One man
thanked me, a young man from Tyre; the others, quarrelling, pushing one
another, tearing at their rags, left the road to crawl into a cave.

I asked the man from Tyre what he knew about the others but
he could not concentrate on what I said: he was so moved, so pleased, so
enraptured over his health he stood in front of me, smiling, laughing. He kept
holding up his arms and handsâshowing me. I asked him about people I knew in
Tyre. He shook his head, laughed, kissed my hands, rushed off. A caravan was
passing, camels, drivers, onlookers; he disappeared among the camels, the dust.

Ã¿

Jerusalem

Adar 25

Today I received a message: the
mebakker
at Qumran
has invited me to return to the monastery for a second residency. He wants me
to instruct others in the Messianic Rule.

I am no longer in accord with Qumranâs rigid communal life:
such sharing would be difficult for me; certainly none of my disciples would
understand.

But I think of the Qumran desert; I think of the cliffs and
caves near the monastery. Morning and evening shadows! What great fogs used to
engulf us!

Ã¿

Urusalim

Adar 28

I spoke outside the temple and, as I spoke, men and boys
picked up stones to throw at me.

Sadducees want me excluded from the temple; others want me
excommuniÂ­cated. They stamp me an untouchable. Such intrigue! How am I to help
manÂ­kind? My disciples urge me to leave Jerusalem. The world is beautiful, they
remind me: Go to Cana, go to Bethlehem, to Galilee, to Jericho. Date groves.
Olive groves. Roses. As if I needed a reminder.

This afternoon I walked about Solomonâs city to an
impressive ruin, a series of roofless rooms, fallen columns, weeds growing
through marble floors, lizards on walls. Birds dotted the sky. I tried to
imagine the regal furnishings of Ptolemyâs time. Underfoot were hieroglyphic
slabs, a cartouche among them. I climbed old stone walls, were they Nehemiahâs
walls when he fortified the city? I found a broken scarab and remembered
Egyptian words my mother taught me as a boy. In the street below the vast ruins
a Roman soldier talked with another Roman soldier. Herodâs workmen were capping
stone pillars. Tall men in dark red robes, red turbans on their heads, prodded
camels, heavily laden animals. Were they Syrians?

Somewhere along the way I met a blind man led by a boy. The sun
sent sweat down the boyâs face. Tired, they sat by a spring where women and
girls were filling jars. People recognized me and soon a crowd formed, as I
rested. The blind man, wearing a sash woven with gold, white-bearded, tall,
erect and proud, asked about me. The boy whispered desperately to him.

âItâs Bartimaeus and his son, from Jericho,â a woman said.

âSon of David, have mercy on me,â Bartimaeus pled, speaking
softly. Then he cried:

âLord, have mercy, that I may receive my sight. Are you
Jesus of Nazareth? Will you help me? Will you touch my eyes? I must see again.â

I sat close to him and talked to him, the aura of his faith
evident. As we talked I realized he could see: his expressions were so
startling. He embraced his son. Erect, silent, he stared about him. Everyone
was silent. Fumbling a little, he walked away; then, he returned and knelt by
me and kissed my hands.

âMaster...let me follow you... I believe...let me be one of
your chosen...let me tell others what you have done for me. I know about your
ministry.â He kissed my robe. âWhen I heard you speak yesterday I tried to
reach you.â

He urged me to stay at his home; perhaps he had heard me say
that fox have holes and birds have nests but the man of God has no home. I
warned BartiÂ­maeus not to look back if he put his hand to the plough.

Lately I have not seen much of Judas. He refuses to visit me
at Clibusâ home. I hear that Judas has quarrelled with the daughter of Pilate.
Faithful to our group, he collects and disperses funds. Our group is increasing
in numberâcommitted to everyone. Some of us provide food, clothing and shelter.

A nomad group is famine stricken. The babies need sugar and
salt and we have provided packets by way of a caravan.

Ã¿

Clibusâ

Through Clibus I have written a letter home. Mother will
find someone to read it aloud. I donât want Mother and Father to come here.
They dislike the city. Father has been unable to work and needs to husband his
strength. He must avoid danger.

Getting up at dawn I have been able to memorize lines from
Horace, lines that help. The tiny garden helps. The children help. But when
Johnâs cousin, Elihu, came, distortion returned as we talked of Johnâs
imprisonment, torture, death. Elihu is a frail soul, so unlike John. He is so
in need of encouragement. He tells me that a storm flooded homes in Nazareth.
They did the best they could with shovels and baskets.

Ã¿

Jerusalem

Nisan 8

I

look forward to resurrection. The
promise of resurrecÂ­tion sustains me although I am, at times, conÂ­fused,
confused because resurÂ­rection means a blurring of the future, perhaps a
cessation of the future. I can not plan a sabbath. I can not say âWe shall meet
together at Samaria.â Since the beyond is truly incomprehensible today is
distorted as well.

I must warn myself of the onslaught of pain that will crush
me during the crucifixion. How to bear it? Gird my loins, perhaps. It will not
be easy to die for my fellowmen. Will my ascension help others rise from their
tragic lives?

Dread eats away at me.

Hate undermines me.

Broken covenants...Golgotha, place of skulls...rocky
Judea... Caesar Augustus, your crimes are everywhere...imperator...killer!

I need to be baptized with love.

With wisdom.

Yesterday, in this city of rocks, I noticed straw in a
stable, yellow straw, fresh, clean, glistening in the sun. I took a few. Straw is
simplicity. Simplicity points to a balanced way.

Ã¿

Bethany

Nisan 12

Yesterday I walked to Bethany. Martha and Mary said that
Lazarus had died. Among graves and stunted trees, in a stinging wind, I became
keenly aware of the days I spent at their home, with the three of them. How
often Lazarus and I had done carpentering under his thatched shed.

Here, with his sisters, friends and relatives, here at the tombs,
I knew death was not the answer. I walked to the crypt where Lazarus lay. Loose
rocks tumÂ­bled underfoot. Wind whipped. A boulder blocked the crypt and I asked
Martha to have her friends help me drag it aside. Men consulted and argued that
it was useless; they glared at me savagely as they pushed and dragged the
stone.

At the opening I bent over and cried:

âLazarus...come... I am the resurrection and the
life...come...this is Jesus!â

I needed him. His family needed him. Mary and Martha. Death
did not need him, surely.

Men jeered and howled. But I knelt and shouted as the wind
spat on all of us.

Ah, sorrowing women, yellow rocks, death, a man in his
crypt, cold stone, a hawk screaming...

I called again and again.

âLazarus, this is Jesus. Arise! Come with us! Remember us,
remember I am the resurrection and the life. Come unto me...believe...God is
here...â

It was late afternoon: the sun was behind the yellow cliff.

Martha clutched my arm and said:

âLord, let us leave. Lazarus has been dead four days. He
stinks.â

A funeral procession passed byâmen and womenâthe men
carrying a childâs coffin.

âGod, our Father, help us. Give this man life again!â I
beseeched with pasÂ­sion. I knew, as I prayed, that Lazarus would respond.

Swaying, wrapped in burial clothes, Lazarus appeared, a
scarf across his face. He could not see or move his hands. I went to him and
Martha uncovered his eyes. Mary ran to help. We unwrapped his legs and arms.

âJesus has given you life,â Martha said. âYou are going home
with us...you are one of us again.â

Stumbling over rocks, Mary guiding him, Lazarus found a
place to sit down. We unbound him and someone gave him a robe. Someone offered
him a piece of bread. He shook his head, stared at us, turned from one to the
other, his face birdlike, hawklike, white. He peered at his crypt. Martha
hugged him, laughing. People gathered. Some knelt around us.

âMary, what happened?â Lazarus began, speaking his first
words.

âWhy am I here in this place? Why am I wearing a robe? And
these people... and Jesus! Was I sick? Where are my clothes?â

I longed to leave this place of death: it was closing in on
me. The wind blew harder and a hawk leaped upward.

With Martha I walked away, listening to her happiness, her
praise.

âWe must have supper. What shall we eat? Will he be hungry,
able to eat? JeÂ­sus, you have saved him. I love you. Itâs wonderful! Heâs
back...think of it, after four days. Then, then there is no death for us who
believe...â

At supper Lazarus was unable to talk; he drank a little and
soon had bread wet with olive oil. No one had much to say. Lazarus sat next to me.
Bending over his plate he gave me a few boyish grinsâlike old times. He had
gotten into his work clothes. Putting his hand into a pocket he pulled out a
small chisel and laid it on the table. But he said nothing. I urged him to eat
Marthaâs fish or lamb, delicately prepared. Every face at the table expressed a
wonderment and rapture. The candles burned down. The women ate. Suddenly there
was chatter and then laughterârejoicing.

It was difficult to return to Jerusalem, leave my friends. I
lingered a day for the fields of barley, the paths that were peaceful paths. I
had to have time to be with Lazarus, be with Mary and Martha, write my journal.
Alongside the carpenÂ­try bench I have a table. I prefer writing outdoors. There
is a vine on the thatched shed and it is in flower. As I write Lazarus is
sleeping on the ground, in the sun.

Caretakers at the graveyard claim that one of the crypts has
been robbed.

Ã¿

Jerusalem

I keep hearing the words of an old hymn as I go about; it
was Johnâs favorite, one we learned while at Qumran. Was it solace while he was
imprisoned? I hope it was. It is a comfort to meâso gracious.

I give thanks unto Thee, O Lord,

For Thou has wrought a wonder with dust.

Thou hast made me know Thy deep, deep truth,

Thou hast given me a voice;

I continually bless Thy name.

I seem to hear Johnâs commanding voice, his loving
benediction as I left his prison:

The Lord bless thee and keep thee,

the Lord make His face to shine upon thee

and be gracious unto thee...

Ã¿

Ephraim

Nisan 14

I am staying at a beautiful old stone house in nearby Ephraim.
I have allowed myself a respite, among pomegranate, olives, roses. Herons fly
at dawn and eveÂ­ning. Children run in and out. A boy with shaggy head has a pet
dove. A girl with almond eyes is learning to weave. My disciples are here, the
new and the old. We have met in a low room, plain and bearded men, clothes new
and disheveled; Ezra shows me his injured leg; Luke works over it; Lamech (a strong
youth) is from Casarea, an expert swimmer, he said.

âI will walk to Jerusalem tomorrow. Iâll remain there. The
high priests will accost me. They may mock and scourge me, as they have many others...but
I will return.â I tried to speak calmly. I could not be forthright...

Calling me âRabboni,â a pretty girl knelt in the jammed room
and anointed me with fragrant oil. It was a moment of calm, a moment of beauty.

Ã¿

Nisan 15

Holy Week has begun.

I walk accompanied by my disciples.

As we pass a tall wooden cross I remembered that the Romans
have crucified as many as two thousand men at one time because of religious
dedication. AlÂ­most every single one of us has witnessed a crucifixion.

Hail Caesar!

Ours was a solemn path on a clear morning, larks singing,
the air brisk.

Carrying fronds, waving, hoping to speak to us, hundreds
filled the paths and streets, wanting the miracle of love and life.

Our path crooked upward to the âHouse of the Figs,â where I
was given a donkey, a tall, white one. Children shouted joyously. For me, he
was my donkey of peace. I waved as I rode along. Some women cut branches and
tossed them in front of me. Others threw flowers and shouted âHosanna.â

Jerusalem spread around me, blocks of stone, yellow walls,
piles of ancient masonry, new porticos, towers, shops... It was my city, my
hated city; I esteemed the meaning it has for my forefathers, men who slept in
the valley, with peaked cypresses above their graves.

Dust fanned over us as we followed a narrow way. Romans turned
on me and turned on the crowd but I warned them to desist.

At the temple I found more money changers. The courtyard was
cattleyard; waiting rooms were storerooms. Animals bellowed. I struck again at
the vendors, toppling tables, hurling money trays. The crowd screamed, cheered.
In the midst of this bedlam strangers, travelers, stopped Philip and Andrew.
They insisted upon being presented to me. The four men offered me sanctuary in
the kingdom of Edessa.

Priests, soldiers, young and old crammed around me as I
explained the life eternal, the image of redemption, eternal salvation and the
price we must pay.

God is our Father...the world of nature proclaims His
goodness...men must share His divine harmony...you reach God from
within...reborn, you recognize the light.

Children sang.

My love went to them.

Astride my donkey I preached to them in simple words.

As the sun slipped behind the city towers there were scores
listening and we lingered on the terrace:

âThere is light for you for a little while longer...walk
while there is light... darkness will come...he who walks in darkness cannot
tell where he is going... believe in the light...â

The evening air was becoming chilly; a wind was blowing in
from the desert.

With my twelve I walked through the Golden Gate, passing
great herds of sheep and goats, grey pastoral sheep and black mountain goats. I
was proud of my men, proud of their courage and love, proud of their humility.

Ã¿

Jerusalem

Nisan 29

We met in an upper roomâa white-walled room. Centering it
was a long taÂ­ble and we sat around it, sharing bread and wine...below us roses
were in flower.

God was with me as I told them, my legatees, that I must die.

âTonight you are entrusted with the keys of the kingdom. Two
at a time you are to go about the world, preaching the gospel. Faith is our
church.â

I loved each man. Such faces! Bartholomew, Matthew, Luke,
James, Simon, Peter, Thaddeus, Judas, John, Phillip. I gazed at one and then
the other, fisherÂ­man, cobbler, farmer, physician, lawyer...brothers.

âYour task is to save mankind!â

The lamps on our table shaped shadows on the walls, on the
floor, far more than shadows. The white walls enshrined each of us. When the
wind puffed our lamps blinked. Ours was an aura that may never recur.

âSoon my enemies will crucify me...one of you will betray
me...â

What consternation! What hysterical exclamations! What
accusations! Then the pleas began: you must escape! Let us help you! We can!
Listen...flee...tonight.

âFaith is the miracle for everyone,â I said. âHeal the sick.
Remember Cana... Galilee...Lazarus...the lepers on the roadway...â

I reminded them that we are samaritans. Mercy is ours, ours
to give. We are to help the heavy laden. Love our children. We are to teach by
example.

Israel, I told myself, you are to nurture goodwill,
tolerance, peace, hope.

So it was in that white room, at that hour.

Ã¿

Clibusâ

By the light of candles I write, to shepherd words, to commune
once more. There is little time for writing, little time for thinking. I feel
that I must endure. By the flickering lights I commune with Father, Mother,
earth.

I would like to go on healing the sick, alleviating pain,
the bodyâs pain, the soulâs. To be a good shepherd, yes. Will my disciples
persevere?

I can write no more tonight.

Ã¿

Peterâs

Iyyar 2

O

h, Jerusalem, you killer of prophets,
stoner of those sent to help you! How I have wanted to care for your children
as a hen cares for her chicks under her wings. You would not have me!

Plotters have attempted to trap me. A group cornered me near
the temple. Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar? they asked. I asked for a
coin. I called their attention to the face on the coin, the face of Caesar
Augustus.

âRender to Caesar the things that are Caesarâs and unto God
the things that are Godâs.â

Not to be defeated, men queried me, as I sat in the court of
the temple, old, old questions. It seemed to me they were stunned when I
reminded them that God is not the god of the dead but of the living. Other
interrogators appeared at noon. A huge grey-bearded priest demanded:

âMaster, which is the greatest commandment of the law?â

I deliberated, wanting to impose on his arrogance.

âYou shall love the Lord will all your heart and with your
soul and with your mind...this is the first and greatest commandment,â I said.
âThe second commandment is similar,â I pointed out. âYou shall love your
neighbor as yourself.â

By now I was angry and left these idlers and when I was
alone with my disciÂ­ples I shamed the trouble-makers who clean the outside of
the cup and leave the inside dirty... I called them a generation of
vipers...they are the ones who will persecute the faithful from town to
town...crucify them...

Grief overcame me. I could talk no longer.

Disgusted with the day, Matthew asked if the world would
come to an end soon. That question had to be left unanswered. Inventors of
questions are everyÂ­where. I wanted to add, watch, be on guard, pray ceaselessly,
work... Donât be careless while your master is away. You canât tell when he may
return.

Mother came to visit me, she arrived in the night, afraid.
Rumors had reached her that I was ill. She was ill. It is a long, long walk, from
Nazareth. Peter gave us melon and though it was long past midnight we sat at a
little table under the stars and ate.

Ã¿

It is impossible to go on writing.

I see what is to take place. I am frightened. I must wait
until I have risen from the dead to continue writing. I have spoken to Matthew.
I will entrust my journal to him.

Judas, in a drunken rage, has gone to the authorities and
has promised to deÂ­liver me to them for a sum. He ridiculed me when I refused
to ask Godâs proÂ­tection.

Ã¿

Here are my final thoughts:

I beg You, dear Lord, hear me. Be attentive to my last
supplications.

I wait, my soul waits. My soul waits for You more than any
who wait for the morning. I say, more than those who watch for the morning.

Ã¿

Peterâs

Iyyar 10

I am alive.

A tremor roused me and I slowly unwound my grave clothes, noticing
how beautiful they were. I looked at my left hand. I looked at my right hand.
They had healed. The stone that blocked my crypt had been rolled aside. It was
dawn when I went out. Outside I found a discarded robe.

The sky was grey but sun slanted across spring hills. I
walked toward the sun on a path that led away from the tombs. Perhaps no one
can grasp my bewilÂ­derment and my happiness. I tasted the air. My brain rushed
about, rebounded from a bush, crashed against rocks. Light was splintering around
me; inside that light was the realization that my suffering is over. I need not
die. Life was living in me like a seed, but a perpetual seed.

Following a path across flowering fields I picked flowers;
then, across the field, I saw Mary Magdalene. She was sobbing, crying. I called
her and she ran to me, saying âRabboniâ over and over. âDearest...â

Mary and Martha appeared. The women surrounded me, laughing,
touching me, kissing my robe, my hands. Later in the day we set out for Nazareth,
for my home, Mother and Father. Halfway Mother met us and threw her arms around
meâno words were necessary.

That evening, as we ate together, Mother described Fatherâs
imprisonment. He had sold the gifts of the Magi to obtain bribe money: he
planned to bribe the soldiers to free me. The merchant who bought the gifts
summoned officials. By lying he got Father jailed for theft.

It required four days to free him, our Nazarene priests
testifying...

Liberated from death I see life as a singular continuity, a
continuity embodyÂ­ing my imperfections, many hopes. I find a new calm in all
that I experience: as I project into tomorrow I sense this serenity. Simplicity
itself wears an aura of riches.

Tonight, living in this composure, I write freely. Time, as
a force, has dropped away. Pressures are comprehensible such as the stress at
our last supper, the betrayal of Judas. Though I held my emotions in check I
feltÂ  confused by many doubts: above all I felt that my ministry would fail.
Ah, that white room, those shadows, our courage as we sipped salt water in
memory of the Egyptian exodus. Those faces as we sang. Now those memories are
glassed inside a mirÂ­ror, unblemished. And I may open that mirror and
experience a memory or I may close the surface.

Ã¿

I stand alone. It is a beautiful feeling. I stand here
without past and without future. I am a naked man, a man of the wilderness.
This is the miracle of self. The mind owns itself. It does not ask. Acceptance
blocks out intrusion. Each of us should experience the wilderness of mind.

Ã¿

Iyyar 18

This is how it was:

As I knelt in the garden I thought of John and his prison
bars, for around me were bars of shrubbery, blacker than any I had seen.
Immobile bars.

Death was in the bars and in the air around me, imagined but
none the less real, as real as death had been in the street that day men wanted
to stone the woman taken in adultery. This was my deathâI listened for
approaching solÂ­diers, for the voice of Judas.

âIf it is possible,â I prayed, âlet this cup pass from me
quickly.â

I heard the brook below: it had a place to go. I had this,
this waiting, this exÂ­pectancy, my disciples asleep on the ground.

Death...death is the ransom for manâs sin, I reminded
myself.

Cries of sentinels rang out.

Judas knew that I was here, that I had come here to pray;
presently I heard the unmistakable clank of side arms and menâs voices, foreign
speech. I could wait no longer. I stood up and waited for Judas to identify me.

Stumbling over shrubbery, Judas called.

I answered.

âWho are you looking for?â I asked a soldier carrying a
torch.

âJesus of Nazareth,â he said.

âI am Jesus.â

Lanterns and torches appeared. Peter saw and heard the
soldiers and snatchÂ­ing a sword from one of the guards he slashed a manâs ear.
I rebuked him and cared for the guard, an Arabian named Malchus, who was
singularly afraid of me, afraid of the garden, his task.

âWe shouldnât have come...you were praying...this is the
garden where you come to pray,â Malchus said.

âIs Judas with you?â I asked.

âHe has gone... Iâm captain here...you must come with us. We
have been commanded to take you to the high priest, Ananias.â

âYou take me with swords and shieldsâlike a thief. I taught
in the temple... I prayed daily for you...â

Malchus, his face in torchlight, mumbled in Arabian and
turned away.

âLeave him alone...get out of here,â Peter shouted; I saw
the guards struggle with him.

Malchus led me along the narrow streets, dark. People lay
asleep in corners and doorways. Donkeys were hobbled together. We walked over
piles of garÂ­bage. As we filed toward the house of Ananias wind smoked our
torches. At the door of the house we were kept waiting. Two of my guards fell
asleep.

Amid bickering I was led into a small room and left there;
then, late in the morning, I was brought before Caiaphas, before scribes and
elders, in an open courtyard. There I heard someone say that it is expedient
for us that he die for his people.

Caiaphas asked me about my teachings and I responded:

âI have spoken openly. I have taught in the synagogues of
Nazareth and Cana and Capernaum and in this city... I have said nothing in
secret. Ask those who have heard me what I have said.â I spoke tersely because
I realized this was a false trial.

One of the scribes struck me across my face and hurled me to
the floor.

Witnesses were broughtâcitizens. One testified that I had
vowed to destroy the temple within three days and rebuild it without hands.
Other witnesses disÂ­agreed. A woman said I faked miracles. A man testified I
had threatened to deÂ­pose the governor. Others disagreed.

âAre you Christ...are you the man the people call Christ?â
Caiaphas asked.

âI am.â

A priest gestured; he seemed to tear his robe. Caiaphas
smiled.

âYou have heard this blasphemy,â he said. âWe need no more
witnesses. I condemn this man to death.â I knew nothing more could be said in
my defense.

As I sit at my table, underneath the trees, at Peterâs home,
I write as if I were writing about someone else, a friend perhaps. I write
without prejudice. I am shaken by manâs corruption and yet my lack of faith in
man does not influence my writing.

I was left in the hands of guards and palace servants and
then I was led into a room where my hands were roped behind me. I was thrown on
the floor and beaten and kicked and spat on. Men placed me in a chair and
covered my eyes and asked me to guess who struck me, everyone laughing.

I fell asleep on the floor and was wakened for a trial
before priests, elders, scribes, in a marble-floored room, Roman insignia on
the wall, the room icy, airless, officers and soldiers at one end, one of them
in battle gearâto impress me, I thought. But I was scarcely able to stand,
scarcely able to think. My hands on the back of a chair, I put my mind to work:
I singled out my home, its doors, its windows, the grass growing in the street.
I forced myself to visualize my mother and father. Though I was in pain I
remembered my little friend, Amos: we were kneeling in the dust before my house,
playing marbles: dust flipped as we shot.

I was asked if I was the son of God.

The trial was not a trial. There were no witnesses.

Temple officials conferred.

Roman authority was not involved.

A judge or priest condemned me to death.

Such authority had been denied forty years ago by the
Romans. Being aware of this added to my resentment; I tried to speak out but
was silenced. From the courtyard I was marched to the paved square called
Babbatha; troops lined the square, spectators gathered. The sunâs warmth
lessened my pain. One of the guards, secretly, gave me bread. I saw Judas with
Pontius Pilate; Pilate was acÂ­companied by councilors, guards. I felt I had
been hurled into a wholly alien worldâenemy world.

Pilate, stepping forward in his robe, asked Caiaphas the
nature of my crime. I will remember that scarlet robe.

Caiaphas, annoyed, said:

âIf he were not a malefactor we would not bring him before
you.â Pilate unÂ­derstood the evasion. He responded:

âTake him, judge him according to your law.â

A priest declared:

âWe found this man saying he was Christ the King.â

Perhaps Pilate was remembering his troubled past, the servitude
of his anÂ­cestors, some problem, for he hesitated, suspecting a ruse, that the
priests were deceiving him. He must have known that I had not preached revolt.

âAre you king of the Jews?â he asked, motioning me to come
closer. âYour people have brought you here. What have you done?â

âMy kingdom is not of this world.â

âAre you a king?â

âI was born to bear witness to the truth.â

Pilate shrugged.

âWhat is truth?â He resumed his seat.

I did not respond.

âWhat is truth?â he repeated. He waited a little while and
then said, looking at me closely: âI find no fault in this man.â

Spectators and priests protested. Someone shouted:

âHe stirs up the people from here to Galilee. Heâs a
troublemaker. He drove us out of our temple market.
â

At that moment Pilate may have become aware of my accent or
remembered I was born in Nazareth for he ordered me brought to trial before
Herod, the local governor. Herod, I thought, the name stunning me as I recalled
his crime.

We crossed a bridge, a hostile crowd following; young Herod
welcomed me because he had heard of my miracles and wanted me to perform for
his benefit. Was I wizard, necromancer, fakir?

I could not speak to this murderer: I envisioned John in
prison, waiting, waiting for the liberty that never came. I saw his decapitated
head on a tray, disÂ­played for a dancing girl.

Because I could not speak Herod had his men throw a purple
robe over my shoulders and place me on a chair. They mocked me, spat on me, and
demanded I save myself.

Herod refused to try me and ordered guards to return me to
Pontius Pilate. It was then, as we recrossed the bridge where the populace
jeered, it was then I attempted to think of home. Something like an actual wall
blocked me. All the emptiness of life, the savageness of the wilderness, the enmity
of mankind, came into being. I prayed but prayer was useless. A man held my arm
or I would have fallen: his sword hit my side.

Ã¿

Peterâs

Iyyar 25

Pilate resented a jeering mob and tried to establish order.

He commanded men to assume positions in the Babbatha yard.
Calling sevÂ­eral priests, he said, shouting at them:

âYou have brought this man before me. You say he perverts
the people. I find no fault in him. I will punish him and release him.â

He sat on his tribunal chair, his wife beside him. Raising his
hand he reÂ­sumed:

âI will free a man. Who will it be? Barabbas? Do you want
Barabbas free or Christ? Choose your man.â

âBarabbas...Barabbas,â the priests shouted, and the crowd
repeated his name, a man known for his crimes.

âWhat shall I do with Jesus?â

âCrucify him...crucify him.â

âWhat has he done?â

The crowd answered: âCrucify him.â

Shall I continue this journal? Will others accept my
account? Shall I simply destroy these words? As days pass I am able to re-live
the sadness. There is a chance to diminish manâs cruelty. I take that chance.
We are here in this world to make life worthy. We are here to teach others.
Teaching is no easier than learnÂ­ing. No one has ever had my vantage point:
this permits me to continue.

I searched for a friendly face among the
mob...Peter...Mother...Matthew... Clibus...

Barabbas was
brought before the judges and liberated with jeers and laughter. He passed by
me, a great, tall man. As he walked away I was led to a whipping post, bound,
and lashed with thongs; I was lashed until unconscious. Courage, where was my
courage to bear the cruÂ­cifixion.

I tried to think...

In a barren hall soldiers stripped me and put a filthy robe
around me and forced a crown of thorns on my head. Six or eight men confronted
me. They mocked me.

âHail, king of the Jews,â they holÂ­lered.

Priests appeared and cried: âCrucify him...he calls himself
the Son of God. Kill him.â Pilate appeared and asked: âWho are you?â I could
not speak beÂ­cause of pain.

âSpeak to me...donât you realize I have the power to set you
free.â

I was thinking of Judas.

A Roman officer spoke out: âHeâs an enemy of Rome...he
defies Caesar.â âOur emperor is Caesar,â a priest shouted.

âTake him away,â Pilate said. âHe is yours.â He took water
and washed his hands before the crowd. âI am innocent of the blood of this
man,â he said.

Again I looked for my disciples but now a centurion in
cuirass and armed soldiers, carrying shields, grabbed me and forced me outside.
âTo the cross,â someone said. âTo the cross,â another repeated.

I was amazed to find myself walking. It isnât far, it isnât
far, I told myself.

We descended a stepped path. The bridge lay ahead. People
jammed the bridge. We climbed a steep bank, passed houses, trees, rocks. The
centurion ordered me to carry the crossbeam. As he compelled me to take the
beam he gave me water.

It was nearly noon.

I shouldered the beam, fell, tried again. The officer
ordered an onlooker to carry the beam. I heard a priest shout: âIf any man
wishes to prove the innoÂ­cence of Jesus, let him speak.â His voice, his robe,
the beam, the crowd... I canât remember. Yet I remember men selling dates,
hawking fruit. I wanted the food of earth, life itself.

My mother broke through the crowd and embraced me. A little
farther on I heard Lazarus call. I saw Martha. She was kneeling, reaching
toward me. Peter, Luke, Clibus, Mark. I saw. I loved them, their faces like old
graven coins.

I saw them all the way to the spot where they laid the cross
on the ground. I prayed for courage, strength to endure, as they stripped off
my clothes.

Then men pounded a nail through my hand and I was blinded,
torn with pain. Then I felt greater pain as they pounded a nail through my legs
and then I felt no more pain until I hung on the cross.

I looked and looked but could make out nothing; then I saw
two men hangÂ­ing on crosses beside me. I looked at them and they looked at me.
I saw people below me; I heard women and children crying. I tried to speak to
them. But as I hung there everything began to move away from me: a great
distance swam around me. I thought of a mirage. Someone put a sponge to my
mouth. Then I saw my mother, I saw Martha, Lazarus, people I had cured. A
soldier shoved his spear into me. I tried to say something... That is all that
I remember.

Ã¿

Joseph of Arimathea obtained permission to remove my body
from the cross. He and my disciples placed it in his family crypt. He provided
a robe and cloth to cover my face. I lay in his tomb, myrrh and aloe about me;
there I lay for three days.

Peterâs Home

Sivan 2

P

eter is a descendant of a nomadic
tribe. Euodia, his mother, is a gnarled woman, dark, serious. She and Peter
built this house after her husband died. She had had enough of desert
privation. Last night she spread a special table for my homecoming: pomegranate
juice, melon, cheese, bread, nuts, chromis and another fish, clarias, my
favorite. Euodia is an expert with olive oilâperhaps some are nomad recipes. At
supper time she accepted me easily; Matthew and Peter were wary, afraid, shy.

While we were eating, Peter said:

âMaster, how can it be you were crucified eight days ago...
Can you say that you are well?â He brushed his hand over his yellow beard. âI
couldnât forget the terror...will you help us understand? When all of us meet
will you explain? Is it faith?...â

We were eating at a makeshift table under Peterâs olives; it
was well after sunset and we felt the quiet of the extensive fields that make
Peterâs home a retreat.

Matthew, picking at his supper, nervous, kept watching my
handsâI knew he was studying the scars.

âI hope you never return to Jerusalem,â he exclaimed.

I agreed: I agreed for several reasons: one reason was my
desire to send my disciples to remote places, villages, towns.

âOur work is to be carried out among our countrymen while
governments interfere.â

âWe love you...we had nothing to do with the crucifixion,â
Euodia blurted out.

Love, love after crucifixion is a brilliant but black
enigma: it proffers and deÂ­nies. We know that love helps us forget pain;
however I ask myself whether it is evil to forget evil. But I can think of
resurrection as a form of love, a love beÂ­yond supplication. I take that step
and realize that immortality is another form of love.

Desert air pushed in as we finished our meal and we soon
felt chilled. I wanted to shed my fatigue by reading but we discussed visiting
the spring at Neby. I suggested we leave early if it did not rain during the
night and bog the paths. At Neby I wanted to work out a plan for James, Peter
and Matthew, if James joined us. When government cruelty diminishes I want
Peter to preach in Rome.

In my bedroom I read
Ecclesiastes
âdrowsing at times,
aware of my familiar pallet, the good pillow, the candles. I was able to
dismiss the imminence of deÂ­parture. I put it away like a shell under sea
grass.

Ecclesiastes
meant more to me than weeks ago as I
read and re-read passages.

Rain woke me during the nightâa pleasant shower smelling
like spring. So, we would walk to Neby another day. Here I would be able to go
on reading
EcÂ­clesiastes
and Peterâs copy of the
Psalms
. When I
told Peter that Clibus had found the
Ecclesiastes
scroll on a trip to
the upper Nile they were astonished. They had never seen so ancient a scroll.

Sivan 5

Judas is dead. He took his own life. His body was found by
the daughter of Pontius Pilate. Since he was one of us we have buried him; at
his grave a downÂ­pour struck us and drove us to a shelter. In a few moments the
earth was flooded. I canât recall such rain and thunder.

Judas, born in Gamala, vineyard proprietor, dead at twenty-eight
years. As
EcÂ­clesiastes
says: âWoe unto him who is alone when he falls.â

Ã¿

Startling, on a hillside, on a hilltop, a contingent of
Roman soldiers, a new encampment, white tents in rows, banners, standards,
smoke. Shields flash as men drill. Camels are hobbled behind the tent town. We
can make out men in half armor, men wearing helmets, men at work shoveling, men
erecting a large striped tent.

Is this always glory, power and death?

Ã¿

Peterâsâearly morning

Sivan 8

Shall we be like trees planted by rivers of water? Shall we
mature slowly like the olive? Shall we endure two hundred years? Shall these
men replant? They are humble men. Are humble men more or less successful with
their lives? These men know ambition and is ambition the safe route? Verily, verily
âall is vanity and vexation of spirit,â if we listen to
Ecclesiastes
.
What will evolve when the silÂ­ver chord is broken? I have answered these
questions in the past but I wish to answer them once more.

Ã¿

Peterâs

Sivan 10

Sivan is a beautiful month, a month of subtle changes.

I lay in deep grass yesterday. While I lay in the grass I
remembered the fields around Nazareth and I remembered climbing olive trees at
harvest timeâhow we sang and shook down the ripe fruit onto nets.

Mama made the finest olive oil in Papaâs oil press, the
finest in Nazareth some Nazarenes said. I hurried to fill our baskets... I
wanted to gather more than anyone. I never did.

Tomorrow I go to villages and will heal the sick...it is a
joy, a joy rather kinÂ­dred to lying in deep grass in the warm sun.

I have read my journal. I will return it to Matthewâs care.
Among our disciÂ­ples he is the most reliable.

Ã¿

Sivan 12

So, as I write with my bronze stylus, I listen to the
evening, familiar sounds; through my window I see the Milky Way and the great
constellations and I am aware God is affirming his handiwork.

I write very slowly, lingering over each letter, the square
letters superior to the old script. I go on listening. The lamp burns steadily.
There is no wind. There is gratitude.

Ã¿

Nazareth

Sivan 17

Father has suffered from his imprisonment. His hands
tremble. After seeing me on the cross he is unable to believe that I am alive.

I held out my arms to him as we stood in front of our home.
He backed away.

â...Father, remember how we visited together at Qumran?
Remember that old long-bladed saw, how I repaired its handle three times?

âMama gave you that shirt at the Feast of Lights...â

He turned and walked away, trembling.

Ã¿

When I was staying at the home of Gehazi, after preaching in
the synagogue, after healing, Barabbas appeared. Jamnia is his village and he
entered the house of Gehazi without knocking. A great tall hulk, he loomed over
me; then he knelt and begged me to accept him.

Dressed in goatâs skin, his face and beard wild, he seemed
ill, perhaps deÂ­ranged. I tried to calm him, to reason with him.

âI should have been crucified,â he repeated in a hoarse
voice.

For a long while we remained together, talking, praying,
hoping.

Ã¿

Peterâs

Sivan 24

Patienceâwe need patience.

Going from village to village, town to town, means walking
five days, four days, two. It is a five day walk to Nazareth. It is a two day
walk to the village of Gehazi. Most walks are pleasant. It can be cold, windy,
hot; and when it rains there is seldom any shelter.

Sometimes we travel together; sometimes we walk alone; these
days I prefer my solitary walks. I am aware of close communion when alone.
Patience, paÂ­tience...but the calendar moves on: Shevat, Adar, Nisan, Iyyar,
Sivan...

Ã¿

Peterâs

Tammuz 3

I

will miss Peterâs little house, its
rough walls, its crooked windows, its clumsy thatched roof. The floors have
interested me. He found pieces in some Babylonian structure; he hauled them
here in an ox cart. I have come to love this isolation, its olive trees.

Today is a summerâs day.

Great clouds, great sky.

Peter sought me out as I sat in the bedroom reading. Again
he asked for forÂ­giveness. Kneeling by me he promised he would carry the
word... âto Rome, if you wish. Teach me courage, teach me strength, teach me to
be wise...â

He and I have worked at the carpenterâs bench lately, in
Lazarusâ shed. It took the three of us to line up a door. Of course it was very
old. Laughing, we had to admit our clumsy workmanship.

We are proud that there are more than seventy of us now. I
send them out in pairs.

Ã¿

The home of Lazarus

Tammuz 8

It seems to me I view mankind with a sense of compassionâa
constant perÂ­ception. Mine is a brief, swift looking back: I heal the sick, I
renew lives... I reÂ­member the hart and the brook...manâs insatiable thirst.

Children come and animals come...the ox and the donkey have
been friends. A shepherd, I still follow hills, hills of resurrection they may
be. Perhaps history may call me a man of righteousness. Perhaps history may not
stop. I speak to history. I say, once again:

âGo and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost...â

Teach as I have taught...remind them of grace.

Ã¿

Tammuz 11

I leave no tomb, no crypt, no marker.

Finality may not be a friend...

When I leave shall I carry a handful of earth with me?

James, Peter, Matthew, Mark...Mother and
Father...Lazarus...Miriam... each one is mine but for how long?

Peter will pick up my sandals and say:

âThese were his.â

Father will say:

âHe helped me make this box.â

The Godhead is before me and I struggle with delight and
with astonishment.

Ã¿

Tammuz 12

I am entrusting my journal to Matthew. Since we have friends
at the synaÂ­gogue in Capernaum he will leave my journal there.

Verily, verily I say: Fear God and keep His commandments.
This is the duty of man.

Ã¿

Farewell Thoughts

I

hope these thoughts may be helpful.
It is very late and lamplight flickers...

Inside a man of light there is light
and with this light he lights the world.

The angels and the prophets will come
to you and give you strength.

Blessed are the ones who have heard the
Fatherâs word and kept it in truth.

Have you then discovered the beginning
so that you ask the end? Where the beginning is, there the end will be.

The kingdom is inside you. When you
really understand you will know that you are the son of the living Father. If
you do not underÂ­stand yourself you will be in poverty.

Split wood and I am there. Pick up a
stone; there you will find me.

Come to me because my yoke is easy, my
lordship gentle. You will find rest.

The kingdom of the Father is spread
over the earth and men do not see it.

Blessed are the solitary and the elect;
you shall find the kingdom because you have come from it and you shall go there
again.

I
say, whenever one is one he will be filled with light, but whenever he is
divided he will be filled with darkness.

Love your brother as your own soul. Guard him as the apple
of your eye.

There will be days when you seek and you will not find me.

This journal was kept by Leonardo da Vinci during the years 1516 to
1519 while he lived in France as the guest of King Francis I; there, he lived
in the small residence of Cloux, near the Kingâs summer palace at Amboise on
the Loire River. Leonardo writes of his boyhood, his mother, his friends, his
easel and mural paintings, his dissections, his colossal bronze horse.

He tells of
his attempts at flying, his inventions... This is a codex of his mind as he
divulges his art and the scope of his interests.

To the end of
his life he was painting, map-making, carrying out architectural commissions,
arranging his treatises on perspective, anatomy, horses, flight, and the arts.
His patron, King Francis, called him âMon PÃ¨re.â Da Vinciâs last years, at
Cloux, near Paris, were friendly years.

Â Â Â Â Â Â  MEMORY . . .

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  MEMORY. . .

I

Â remember that hot, dusty afternoon in
Florence. I ordered everyÂ­body out of my studio. I got up from my workbench and
deÂ­manded that they leave: the tattlers, the oafs, the bores, the faithful. I
packed them off. Yelled at them. Stormed. I had work to do, work that would
keep me until dawn. I had to have serenity, no ribaldry, no disgrunÂ­tled siÂ­lence,
no questions, no interruptions of any sort.

I slammed the doors, bolted them.

A mouse scuttled across the room.

Until I resolved the perfect angles, sheet after sheet went
into the making of that pelvic drawing.

Queer how memory is: I can see that messy workshop, easels,
clay figures on stands, rags, canvases, frames, chisels, pigments, brushes... I
can see the mouse watching me from beneath a basket. Again I sense that long
afternoon, that long night... I had dried bread, cheese, and port. I remember
the church bells. At dawn I slid my work into a special portfolio, then

concealed
it. I was often hidÂ­ing things in those days, hiding sketches, hiding
determination, hiding frustraÂ­tions, goals.

Memory...it gives you what you want and supplies absurdities
as well, like the dream that I had in Florence, recurrent: I was lying on my
cot... I was dead... I was carried to a morgue and dumped there, among
cadavers...blood and mould satuÂ­rated my drawings and my writings...my canvases
were being eaten by termites... how well I remember that dream.

I remember a fat Milanese who used to haunt me while I was
decorating the walls and ceiling of the Sala delle Asse: he was a pompous
member of the Sforza household, a great nose-picker, who had done nothing at
all through his long life. While I worked, he sat, hunched in a princely
brocade chair, in elegant clothes, sometimes asleep in spite of my assistants,
ladders, and scaffolding.

That Sala delle Asse work was boring. Like many a commission
it was comÂ­pulsory. To arrange masses of foliage on walls and ceiling seemed absurd.
Designs were refused, at the outset. The employment of immense tree trunks
satisfied. As I painted, I mingled knotted cords with the foliage, intermingled
branches, established a rhythm. I kept my greens from becoming monotonous. I
achieved a kind of helmeted bark on the tree trunks. Before I finished, the
Salaâs canopy, the forest umbrella, became more meaningful.

My fat friend slept on and on.

How much did I earn? I have forgotten. Was I ever paid?

I would like to return to the castle and walk through that
Sala; I would like to be alone; I would like to try to think as I thought in
those days; I would like to sense my aspirations; I would sit on a bench under
that deluge of foliage: I would list geology, hydraulics, painting, sculpture,
geometry, anatomy, mediÂ­cine...

Cloux

When Michelangelo showed me his cartoon for his mural in the
Consejo, I complained that a scene of idling nude bathers was not the best way
to depict war. He was critical of my cartoon, saying âyou are more concerned
with horses than men.â

My objective was to show warâs anguish: pain was to be sixty
feet long by twenty feet wide. Twelve hundred square feet of pain. All of my
draughtsÂ­manÂ­ship went into this
Anghiari
conflict: I painted rage, rage
against war, the rage of dying men, the rage of the wounded, my hate, my
affirmation.

All of 1503 and 1504 went into my preliminary sketches. I
often rode about the countryside to sketch horses, sketch riders; I sketched in
the Sforza stables; the stablemen posed for me; my apprentices posed. Friends
had their chance to exhibit their horses in action. Gamin posed. The militia.

So, I did not paint a wall: I painted the smash of steel
against steel, the plunge of steel into flesh, the grunting of frightened horse
against frightened horse, men stumbling, men falling, dying, their helmets of
fear, helmets of pain...yellows, blues, greys, reds.

On Friday, June 6, 1505, I began to paint the Anghiari
battle. It was my greatest challenge. Here I could render something more
meaningÂ­ful than the madonnas. Not Christ on the cross, but man on the cross.
Pigment and light were to come together in harmony. The day that I began to
paint was beautiful but the weather changed quickly for the worst. Some of my
assistants were called awayâthey were ordered to attend a trial.

The wind caught me unprepared and ripped the cartoon. In a
few minutes the storm took over in earnest. I laid aside my brushes and
pigments and disÂ­missed the remaining apprentices. Half of Florence was
inundated that night.

PAZZIA BESTIALISSIMA!

That is manâs disease: he can not refrain from political
madness. Again and again he is willing to be duped.

The central group in my
Anghiari
mural is the
struggle for a military flag: I painted life-size horses, life-size men,
life-size hatred: the central struggle fans out across the mural, expressing
this futility.

I seldom eat at the Kingâs table although I am always
welcome. Sometimes it seems like a long walk to the chÃ¢teau, sometimes it is
raining. In the evening fifÂ­teen courses are certainly gourmet adventures, but
a little late at night.

The King often sends me three or four traysâa retinue of
pages brings them to my studio, laughter and ribaldry, and then decorum as they
file into the studio. SoufflÃ©s, artichokes in cream and butter sauce, crÃªpes,
pastries, glacÃ©s, Vouvray. I am partial to grapes and someone on the royal
staff hunts them up for me.

Sometimes I find five or six silver dishes with as many
kinds of nuts. Francis claims that he could not survive for a month on my vegetarian
diet.

Maturina fusses over almost everything the King sends:

âNow, let me see, let me see,â she mutters. âYou should eat
this first...itâs better for you that way...and these pastries, why theyâre
much too rich for you!â

She arranges the dishes on the dining table (you must not eat
in the studio); she places my chair, lights the candles, unfolds my napkin and
spreads it across my lap. What a splendid old ragamuffin she is! Too bad she
has lost most of her teeth; her features are leaden, her hair is twisted under
a net in lumps, her arms dangle crookedly. She is bones hooked together with
shrunken gut. She has been working as a servant for thirty-five years, she
tells me. Iâve had her for fifteen years.

Cloux

The French call this place Le Clos-Luce, and it is a bright

enclosure. I think of the royalty who have lived here

through the
years, the many mistresses who came and went. As I look across the lawn of the
manor house I can see the little chapel of St. Hubert and the rooftops of the
chÃ¢teau; it often seems to me that I have been here before! With Francesco,
Salai and Giovanni busy in the adjoining studio, I try to believe I am a young
man...time is of no importance!

Salai rushed in as I worked at my easel.

âLook, look at this...â

He had found a sketch among my sketches, a sketch he

made
in Florence long ago, when he was about ten. It shows a bicycle. There

it
is on a scrap of paper, among pornographic scribbles

and graffiti.

âYou did pretty well, riding that thing...at first,â I
reminded.

âThere werenât any brakes, remember?â

âWell, when I connected the chain drive to the pedals and
adjusted the hanÂ­dlebars you rode it into the Arno.â

âSome splash!â said Francesco, coming in with Giovanni. âYou
could have gotten the bicycle out of the river...it floated,â reminded
Giovanni.

âI couldnât get hold of it...the current was too fast!â

âIt should have been made of steel, to last.â I said.

âLetâs make a bicycle for the King,â suggested Salai. âIâll
show him my drawing...no, you make one for him. I can see the courtiers riding
about...we can improve on the one we made in Florence.â

Cloux

Certainly a bird is an instrument performing according to
mathematical laws which are within the capacity of man to understand. How does
it climb, dive, spiral, hover? I asked these questions yesterday as I watched a
flock of ducks along the Loire; I asked the same questions in Florence, in
Milan, in Rome. If we ask questions we can eventually achieve some kind of
answer. Persistence then!

Why does the heart pump a certain beat? What starts it pumping?
Just when? Why, at that given moment? Does a nerve trigger it? Heart beats in
the womb must be automatic.

If we understand the mechanism of the heart we may be able
to help when it is damaged.

What are the essential differences between the heart of a
squirrel and the heart of a man? Between the heart of a cat and a man? Between
the heart of a cow and the heart of a man? Knowing the differences should help.

I must check through my anatomical drawings and compare
notes and anaÂ­lyze the

results. There is so much to be learned. And it
is all there, ready to be apprehended.

Amore sol la mi fa remirare
... love only makes me
remember; love gives me pleasure...

So it was, long ago, when I loved, when I composed a rebus
every day. There was so much to sing about. I played my lira da braccio. Made
notations. As a boy, I thought seriously of becoming a musician. Perhaps a
troubadour. At Andreaâs shop I created a silver harp, in the shape of a horseâs
skull. The fame of that harp took me to Milanâchanged my life.

âThe song of men is the remedy to pain...â

I almost believed that.

I designed drums, multiple beaters; I could change the pitch
of my drums through holes in the sides...I built three portable organs... I
designed glissando recorders...I made a lute for Nicolaio del Turco...I made a
wind-chest
con gomito
for the prioress...

Perhaps I should compose some rebuses for the King.

No.

The music I hear now is not that music.

I might have spent my life in the world of music; yet,
often, even as I played, I puzzled over the enigmas of ocean and mountain,

the
enigmas of the body, of sound: why was one sound more resonant than another;
why were there echoes; why was a womanâs voice unlike a manâs; why were there
changes in the songs of birds?

Ah, those apprentice years!

Those apprentice years!

Getting up at dawn, working before breakfast, working till
late, forgetting to eat, going for a swim in the Arno, rushing back to work,
forgetting to sleep; work, work, it was a beautiful thing.

I was forever gathering plants, drying them, mounting them,
identifying them. I roamed alone. Good to get away from the studio. I was
forever dissectÂ­ing animals and birds. With every bird I asked: how does it
propel itself? How can man go aloft? Those birds, those caged birds...it was
right to hoard money, to buy them, to liberate them. I followed them, I sat
with them, I ran with them, studying every possible angle.

I filled sketchbooks with sketches of the hawk in flight,
the raven, another with the sparrow.

My glider, based on the studies of the hawk, flew around our
workshop. Again and again we tested it, wondering why it flew.

Andrea had me working bronze...there was so much, so much. He
was always encouraging. What a fine master. What a fine artist. Now with gold leaf,
now with new pigments, now something in the way of a discovery with
silverpoint.

He had so little money. Sometimes he went hungry. Sometimes
we had to find money for him and his family. Little Lila, little Lila had to
have a toy. Tony had to have crayons. Bread, milk.

Writing this journal I am attempting to indicate the
important things in my life. However, I am perplexed: I canât decide what has
been significant, I am trapped by small things...little things crowd the
important. If life is a mural then every detail is important. As I write I am
learning who I was. And the omissions, are they carelessness or are they
deliberate? As for important lapses I must make an effort to fill them in, if
there is time. If weariness does not overcome.

Looking back at Milan, at my first year there, I remember:
no,
remember
is not the word: I have never forgotten that meeting at the
Dukeâs
festa
: I was playing a lute; she was introduced to me; she wanted
me to repeat the song; we talked. Love? That is not the right word. But is
there better?

Caterina had my motherâs name; that meant something to me.

I wish I could describe her as I saw her at the
festa
but
she has become unreal through the years. I see her in the sunlight, I see her
as I sketched her, I see her as she lay dead. There is no easy way to describe
our love. I am unable to sepaÂ­rate beauty from tragedy. I wish I could.

Caterina
was nineteen. She was my blonde, my Leda. Was our love unique? Maybe it was
rather ordinary. That does not matter. It matters that there were long brush
strokes in the mind. There is no need to retouch our emotions. CerÂ­tainly her
death and our daughterâs death need no retouching.

I hear her singing one of my songs, a song I composed for
her... I hear her laughing and I hear our daughter laughing, as they play
together. Laughterâin memoryâdoes not blur as words and faces blur.

Nineteen,
twenty, twenty-one...we had three years together: there was money enough: there
was time enough: then Milan was besieged. Both were killed by the bombardment.
But before they died, Mother visited us and for a while I had two Caterinas,
two loving women, two gentlewomen. Our child was learning to walk. Not many
people know of those three years.

Cloux

Today, Maturina has served me her special pasta, several
kinds of bread, dried figs, camembert, her three-layered pastry, and Moselle
wine. She appreciates my fondness for sweets.

I asked her to sit down with me. As usual, she declined.

âI want your company...everyoneâs away.â

Boltraffio, Francesco, Salai and others had gone for the
day. Another holiday!

âAre you homesick?â

Her sad face became a little sadder. She sat down and
clasped her hands in her lap and stared at them.

âI think you should visit your people.â

She nodded.

â...But I couldnât leave you.â

âFor a month or two?â

âItâs a long, long way to Vinci...and alone!â

âSalai is returning to Florence soon...â

âBut I canât...â

âYou should see your family. People in Vinci would like to
hear about us, how weâre getting along. We have money enough.â

Abruptly, hands to her face, she got up, and shuffled away.
âIâm too old,â she said.

Cloux

As we rode along the Loire, following the river road,
Francesco and I talked:

âSo you received a letter from your mother yesterday? How
are things at Vaprio?â

âQuiet...everyone is well. Papa has fully recovered. Mama
says that conditions are very bad in Milan...fighting in the streets...hungry
mobs...looting.â

âVaprio continues to escape...I hope nothing changes that!â

âYou asked me about the pigments I bought in Paris. We have
a good asÂ­sortment. Iâve been grinding them. Weâll have a beautiful green, that
laurel green youâre fond of.â

âIâm still partial to green. I suppose you bought the Dutch
pigments...â

Our horses, side by side, kept an even pace: both from the
same stable, they liked walking together: the road was familiar to them: the
afternoon was sunny; shafts of light rebounded from the Loire; a pair of
squirrels chittered at us; huntÂ­ers and their dogs passedâsomeone saluted us
with a playful toot of his horn.

âMama insists that we stay away from Milan...she warns
us...she said that Iâm to tell you.â

âI understand. Weâre lucky to be here; Cloux is like Vaprio;
beautiful counÂ­tryside; a sketch here, a sketch there.â

âWe should ride to Chambord.â

âI prefer the river trip...â

âShall we go on the river?â

âAll right, Cecchino. You arrange the trip. Certainly,
thereâs no finer chÃ¢teau than Chambord. Letâs spend a few days there. We can
find new paintings, new marbles and bronzes...from Milan...Athens...Rome...the
greatness of stolen art...â

As we left our horses at the stable, Francesco asked:

âDid I mention that the Princess de Lamballe has a son? Heâs
my age. He wants to study painting. Do you want a Prince for a pupil?â

Cloux

The King and I talked far into the night.

Youth can be so sincere: youth can evaluate and assess: last
night, on the part of others, he apologized: the Gascon archers were much on
his mind...

âI have thought of them many, many times...those Gascon
fools...nothing else to do...made a target of your
cavello
...our
archers...â

Bronze for cannons...he knew about that...he searched about
for a solution, as if it might be possible to cast the horse. As he saw it, he
felt he had rescued me. Had he? I turned over that thought. Recompense? Was
Cloux recompense? He did not say so. I think we both wished to believe it was
respect, admiration. His talk made us feel awkward at times.

I had not complained: I had not mentioned the monument.
Divulging his sincerity got Francis beyond his scope.

He
referred to Amboise and Cloux as my home. Haven, of course. Retreat? Voluntary
exile. Those thoughts could be brought in. I tried my best to avoid any
embarrassing approach. Presently, he was excusing the battle of man against
man. Again we were faltering. His innate shrewdness came to our rescue, and we
discussed architectural changes at Amboise...

âWe must do everything we can to improve it...it can never
be like Chambord ...help me give it a manorial feeling...walk about with me
tomorrow...letâs write down some of your ideas...that stairway...the entry...we
have to make it less grim...harmony...â

IL CAVELLO...the words haunted us as we said good night.

I lay down under my canopy. The bed seemed to grow immense.
On one side I saw a child, a bend in a river, a hill...the bed drifted...the
room changed... I saw men pouring bronze into a mould... I saw a great horse in
a city square...

SALAIâHe
is either in studio rags or elegant, foppish; he bursts with energy (has a
brisk, haughty walk); he is quick with his pigments; he is as lean-featured as
a fox; he is yellow-headed, tall. He has a wonderful laugh, a tooth-spread
grin. His brown eyes are spoked with yellow. A girl-chaser. My Salai will never
beÂ­come an accomplished artist. I still have to remind him to wash himself. Ai,
Salaino! And will he ever quit that foreign habit, the habit of smoking?

Almost everywhere I travel I am troubled by poverty: I talk
with the workers and some of them say they are hungry all of the time: I talk
with them about their tools, and try to improve them. Shovels. Spades. Rakes.
Forks. I have sugÂ­gested a more efficient roasting spitâI have made detailed
drawings. I have imÂ­proved a wood-planer and a file-maker. I have designed a
textile machine, a betÂ­ter barrow, a good water-lamp.

For most field laborers, theirs is an ox-life.

Horse, mule, donkey, ox, man...they are inextricable.

Landlord and tenant, the struggle goes on and on: they are
as much at logÂ­gerheads as pope and duke. Serfs, beggars, greed, knights,
foolsâpathos.

At Vaprio, I sometimes ate with a farmer and his wife, in
their tiny stone farmhouse. They did not complain, yet they slept on mats, ate
meat now and then, worked from dawn to sundown, shivered through the winters,
saved floÂ­rins in a clay pot. Their hands at mealtime were the hands of old
people and yet they were not old.

In the Vaprio region the people have to pay exorbitant
milling fees, pay to use a common oven or wine press. Fishing rights have been
stolen. For a few gentlemen there may be no wood for winter; for many others there
may be no wood at all. Some want a civil war to put them on their feet.

At Vaprio, I recall a child of nine or ten: I saw her often
on my visits there: she reminded me of that
festa
, in May, in Florence,
when I fell in love with my own Beatrice, when I was eleven or twelve years
old. My Beatrice was beautiful, her features delicately formed, her behavior
gentle and agreeable, full of candid loveliness... I thought of her as my
angel.

In those days, in Firenze, I often passed Danteâs home: his
wooden door had a bronze knocker, a simple braided ring. I used to imagine
knocking and saying:

âIs Dante Alighieri at home?â

I expected a housekeeper to reply:

âHeâs been dead a hundred and fifty years, you fool!â

I would have dashed off, laughing.

Cloux

I suppose I must admit it: I am a parasite of royalty.

During forty years I have had nine royal patrons.

Each one has hindered me; each one has helped.

I could not have survived in my vineyard at San Vittore: I
need artists, sculptors, apprentices, courtiers, women, princes, jousting,
masques, jewelry, perfume... I need great art. I need antique art. Libraries.

Last night, at Amboise, in the garden, at the pergola, I
explained some of my observations of the moon. Courtiers crowded around. A duke
was there. A prinÂ­cess. There was an earnest exchange as I passed around lunar
drawings, in the lamplight and torchlight.

âThe details are as accurate as I could draw them...notice
the craters, pits, the rills...you see, if you keep the moon under careful
observation over a period of time, youâll become aware of fixed landmarks. I
made those drawings from the Coliseum...in Rome...â

Francesco has copied this. It was written in Florence, in
1508. I thought it rather interesting, so I have included it here:

For
several days I have forgotten to hang my notebooks on my belt. I must see to it
that I remember. Tomorrow I must write down exactly what I observed when I
dissected the pigeon I found dead in front of the church.

Se sarai solo, sarai tutto tuo
...

NOTE:
when you sever the manâs legs tomorrow afternoon, lay them on the floor beside
him: measure length, diameter, muscle curvatures. Dissect each foot, and record
differences. Since the man was very fat, try to discover ways of overÂ­coming
this problem.

Remember to borrow the lancet from Tomas.

I warned my new assistant: Cosimo, squeal on me and I will
see to it that you never become a member of the guild.

He has threatened to write the Pope (or one of the
Cardinals), and expose me. He could. He knows how to write. Now I pay him more
soldi

than any of the others. Blackmailer!

Ah, you Florentines, look, look! I render a skullâyours! You
tremble. You are afraid of learning! For centuries you have been afraid. Afraid
of yourselves, of others, of God. You are trapped in stupidity and lassitude.

Bloodâhow it scares you: You whimper at the sight of blood.
I remove a manâs guts. You are horrified. But you will batter a man to shreds
on the battleÂ­field, and show your gory sword. You will dump boiling oil on
him...you will blast him with gunpowder...but you wonât dissect him...you wonât
learn how we are made!

Sometimes kids overran my studio; maybe because I never
could yell at them. They would sneak in from the street; they had to poke, to
see, to talk, to giggle. One afternoon (I remember it was such a fine day, a
day to chuck everything and walk out of town), five or six boys and girls came
in and before I could figure out what they were up to, they rushed out with two
of my models. Two or three ran toward the Arno; others ran off into the
countryside. I couldnât follow both. Whooping and hollering, the kids flew
their model over the river. I watched it soar away, dip, glide, plunge into the
water.

When I found the other kids, in the country, they had my Red
Hawk: they had it launched on a cord, and kite-like, it was climbing,
spiraling, staying aloft.

KidsâI miss their laughter, their enthusiasm!

There was a time when I had dirty waifs sleeping on the
studio floor. We took in two or three; then others came. Their parents had died
in the plague at Santa Maria; I guess it was at Santa Maria. Those were hungry
weeks for all of us; yet we somehow managed, managed to feed them, get clothes
for them, find homes for themâand kept on working.

Cloux

Copied from my 1504 Florentine notebook:

As soon as we met in the Town Hall there was a big wrangle.
Ten or twelve of us, bearded patriarchs and upstarts, were at odds. We must
decide where Michelangeloâs
David
was to be placed. We must situate it
where it had shade part of the day, where it was protected from the weather; we
must have it mounted on travertine; we must move it carefully; we must see to
it...

It was lucky for us that Michelangelo was not around. He
would have exÂ­plodedâand told us off.

We walked around Florence for several hours, fighting the
heat (and each other); then, we reached our one and only mutual agreementâto go
somewhere and eat.

Later, I went with Francesco to Michelangeloâs studio, and
we sat there, the two of us, and talked about his
David
, sitting on a
bench facing his work. We agreed that it equaled any classical masterpiece. It
was a little difficult to accept such beauty coming from such a troublemaker.

It required four days for men to move it, by windlass and
rollers, to a site alongside the Town Hall: how carefully we worked, the statue
suspended in a sling. Sometimes there were thirty of us at the job. A downpour
drenched us. As we moved forward over slippery cobbles I thought the figure
would topple.
CarÂ­gadores
bellowed. Michelangelo was on hand and beat one
of the
cargadores
with his fists, screaming at the top of his voice.

When we had
David
in place we arranged a party. All
the Florentine artists. Michelangelo was absent.

A while ago NiccolÃ² Machiavelli wrote me from his Tuscan
farm, where he is still exiled from Florence. His disturbing thoughts linger:

âMornings, weather permitting, I hunt or snare thrushes,
reading Dante or Ovid to make the hunts more agreeable. After lunch, I visit an
inn and throw dice with the yokels, to taste my malign destiny in their brutish
company.

âWhen evening arrives I go to my library, after I have shed
my muddy, everyÂ­day clothes. Now I am dressed as if about to appear at court,
as an envoy from Florence. Elegantly attired I enjoy the presence of great men
of the past. They receive me cordially. I talk with them, speaking confidently;
they are at ease. For a few hours I lose myself: I am not afraid of poverty and
death.â

Familiar...the thoughts of the exile.

Yesterday, I wrote NiccolÃ² and invited him to Cloux.

âWe will be a pair of exiles. Stay with me a month or two.
Amboise wonât bore you. Thereâs a superb library. The King has welcomed you.
There will be no expense on your part. I will see to that.â

How he helped in Florence: I remember that I owe my
Anghiari

commission to him. And that night Cesare strangled my friend...it was NiccolÃ²
who provided the horse.

A library.

A library can erase problems.

A library is a kind of stained glass.

Francesco and I enjoy the Cloux library. Handsome room. A
fine Mantegnaâin an old style frameâhangs on the far wall. Its mythological
scene is pleasantly antique. The shelves hold parchments, vellums, velvet-bound
books, illuminated manuscripts, scores. Francesco has turned up a score I wrote
for the Medici, one I used to play.

There is a white marble table with alabaster legs where I
spread out the manuscripts and books.

The librarian, keys at his waspish gut, is a defrocked
Jesuit, ashen-headed, ashen-faced; he admits that he has never lifted down half
of the books.

A lovely
prie dieu
holds a Latin volume, its pages ornamented
with pastel waterÂ­color and gold leaf. The carpet is a mouse-chewed Turkish
weave, red on red on red, with colorless, limp fringes.

The unchained books are in Spanish, Latin, French, Greek,
Dutch, and HunÂ­garianâcollected by King Francisâ father. He loved this room. He
died there.

Sitting under the green pergola at Amboise, King Francis and
I sipped
apÃ©riÂ­tifs
, the afternoon warm, a lazy hunting dog at his feet.

âI
donât understand how your army crossed the Alps in six or seven days.â

âFive days,â he corrected me.

âBy the Col dâArgentiÃ¨re?

âYes...do you know that Pass?â

âI have camped there. I have seen some of it when I was
collecting fossils. But for an army to get through, it seems imÂ­possible. You
had cannons, horses, mules...â

âWe were determined to surprise the Milanese.â

We watched dragonflies circle above lily pads in a small
rock-rimmed founÂ­tain, their orange wings on fire in the afternoon light. Near
the fountain men were planting young columnar cypress. Other gardeners were
spading paths beÂ­cause the King was re-landscaping. Someone, pushing a barrow,
with an enorÂ­mous red wheel, asked the King if he could plant the roses in the
circular beds already prepared.

âWe had good weather,â Francis said.

âThink of it...it took me almost a month to reach here.â

âBut you were in no hurry, Mon PÃ¨re.â

âSnow...mud...ice...â

âI realize.â

âDid you think of Hannibal?â

âI did.â

âWhat Pass did he use to invade Italy?â

âSome say the Mount Genevre.â

âHe was a great tactical genius.â

âOur army was well led...but there were times when I wished
we had some of Hannibalâs elephants...but fog was our worst problem...morning
fog, thick as an elephantâs hide...maybe that fog helped us...our scouts
encountered shepherds in the fog...stopped them from informing others...â

Most men fail to come to grips with natureâs intricacies. When
they find a fossil they are satisfied with a cursory look. As for flowers,
insects, animals, birds, they turn away from them if they serve no practical
purpose. And because men do not care to probe, they resent or fear my studies.
I have been made to feel this through the years.

They accuse me of wizardry...alchemy...vile practices.

My studio door is banged open.

âHelp me, Maestro...oh, God, help me!â

And I try... I draw out pus... I patch a hole in a rogueâs
leg... I sew up flesh...but the same man, when he is well, whispers lies about
me :

âHe steals bodies from the morgue! He steals dead menâs
legs...he slices menâs skulls in half!â

The bodyâs secrets, the mindâs secrets...we must unlock
them!

In his Amboise armory, facing the Loire, Francis showed me
his trophies and gear: his new armor from Cadiz, engraved with floral patterns;
his fatherâs armor inlaid with gold and silver (from Milan); a plumed helmet
with the regal salaÂ­mander in brass and copper inlay; a circular shield
inscribed AFTER DEFEAT VICTORY.

We spent a morning among spears, pikes, swords, scabbards,
helmets, bows and arrows, arquebuses...standards...saddlery. The King admired a
Toledo sword and a pair of antique Hungarian spurs. I was taken by an engraved
dagger from GreeceâHomeric lines along its shaft.

Leaning on a pike staff, Francis spoke excitedly about his
conquest of Milan:

â...How we fought! Was it for twenty-eight hours or longer?
I thought our cavalry would mow down the Swiss...the Swiss kept rushing toward
us...it was our artillery that destroyed them...I fought on my great Conde, the
chestnut you admired...he was wounded, badly wounded...I had to leave him...I
had my visor smashed...my shoulder was sliced open...it was like your
Anghiari
...
horses...men...smoke and dust...at times I couldnât see...everybody
yelling...drums beating...the Venetian troops saved us...

âBy God, it was terrible...sometimes I felt
alone...sometimes I thought my own men would kill me.â

âIs it true that 15,000 men died?â

âYes...yes...15,000...12,000...who can count the dead? Some
wounded crawl away to die...peasants began pilfering, killing...maiming...our
wounded filled the Maggiore Hospital...you must have heard...the halls and
loggias were filled...

âMilan was
poorly defended,â I said.

âThe walled area of the city? Few tried to stop our entry.
News of defeat had spread throughout Milan...little resistance...futile...â

I returned to my studio thoroughly disheartened: it is this
repetition: city against city: pope against duke: the stupidity seems endless:
what shields protect us against the fools of the world!

Yesterday, I enjoyed the Kingâs dinnerâanother hundred or
more guests: Cardinal Mercier, De Brosse, Ambassador to Holland, military,
priests, courtiers, beautiful women. I sat opposite Francis and enjoyed his
scarlet-gold suit, sewn with diamond chips. I believe he was wearing five or
six rings; one of them is rather like the stone I gave Mona long ago. Francis
personifies youth, hedonism, and royalty. Watching him, listening to him, I
forget the tedious round of courses.

Princesse de Lamballe, sitting beside me, a lovely woman in
her forties, dressed in blue and nakedness, praised the banquet:

âFrancis has such wonderful chefs...the food is fresher here
than in Paris...Iâm so glad to get away.â

âTomorrow,â the King said, leaning toward me, âall of us are
leaving AmÂ­boise...weâre going to Chambord.â He waved his hand, and smiled.
âAll of us!â

All of us meant about a thousand people, as the King headed
for Chambord. I watched his retinue (I declined the invitation): I estimate
that there were four hundred horsemen, two hundred mules, mounted archers,
stablemen, the Chamberlain, musicians, clergy, wizards, cooks, doctors...the
archers wore black and red, the musicians wore yellow and green; the King wore
a hat with a yellow plume and a yellow cloak flecked with white fleur-de-lys.
The musicians played oboes, trumpets, tambourines, and drums. Such discord.
Away they went, penÂ­nants, banners, oriflammes.

Suddenly, it was quiet at Amboise.

In my studio I sat at my desk and looked down on the
peacocks and some pheasants: Francesco came: we began to work: I dictated pages
from my treatise regarding horses.

Francesco Melzi
is
a proper, thoughtful villa-man, handsome, slight, midÂ­dle-tall, grey-eyed,
blond. He is my patient friend, my gracious friend (graÂ­cious to everyone): he
has his fatherâs agreeable manners. He is horseman and archer. Flutist. A
painter for fifteen years, he handles chiaroscuro like a master: he is best as
portraitist. No woman-chaser, he is dedicated to Latin, Greek, HeÂ­brew,
French...and all of the arts. When he trims my hair and beard he likes to
flatter me.

I am searching for a glass that reflects a Florentine
faceânot a wrinkled, bearded patriarch.

Giovanni
Boltraffioâ
Tonyâhas always had wealth
behind him (like Francesco); here, at Amboise, he wears satins and silks,
claims that the Kingâs tailor is âthe best in the world.â Tony is so enormous,
so muscular, his satins often split. Blue-eyed, genial, bowing, a little too
obsequious, he sometimes dabs perfume on his paint-messed hands. He has big
hands, big feet, big skullâtopped by curly brown hair. With him decorum comes
first. He is always aware of his sedate heritage. He sings beautifully, and is
an accomplished lutenist. At home he is devoted to his cathedral choir. In
Amboise, he is considered a notaÂ­ble fencer. Heâd rather fence than paint. Heâd
rather eat than paint. He will have nothing to do with dissection. Right now,
he is involved with a red-headed hussy who champions sex.

Andrea del Verrochio
âtall,
with not an ounce of extra meat on him...it seems to me he is still a young
man, that we are at work together in his studio. But no, no, the Arno roared
throughout that night, as we mourned his death. Many of us. Corpses lodged
against supports of the Puente Vecchio. Plagues. Madness. Work. We cherished
him, his frailty. Guild-member at twenty. Such kindness, such classic renderings
in stone and bronze. We revered his
Saint John
, his serenity in stone.

We exhibited his sculpture in every corner of his workshop
and yard. People. His
Dolphin Boy
. His
Christ
. Ghosts from his
metal and chisel.

We learned how to use the abacus together; we learned about
mixing oils; he taught me silverpoint and charcoal; we worked with pastels,
with gold leaf.

Ai, Andreaâwhat a scalding rain on the night you died. We
sat about, we drank wine; then, next week, we returned to our casting, our
horses, busts, anÂ­gels.

Most of the years in his studio were tranquil. There were
wonderful days, when, like John in the Desert, we detected our own worthâin the
mastery of his work. His home was mine. His garden was mine. His florins.

I see him painting a madonnaâs drapery...weeks of work,
painting delicate, gilded folds...he gave me books...

He said: genius is dedication.

He also said: art and friendship.

1517

Cloux

January 6, 1517

A

fter walking along the Loire, the
water grey, swallows passing unÂ­derneath the grey arches of the chÃ¢teau bridge,
I sat where I could study the supports, estimating their bulk and weight. No
notebook. Too many unfinished sketches and treatises. An ancient bridge and my
faceâravaged by time.

At the little chapel of Saint Hubert, which I admire so
much, so complete in itself, pigeons were flying about. Wings again. What are
the correct angles for flying? Which wing structure can lift the most weight?
How to estimate the camÂ­ber?

Rain splattered me as I walked about. A drum roll reminded
me of the thunÂ­der at Vinci. I climbed the Tour Hurtault and was a boy again,
as I watched the rain, as I had watched it at my motherâs house. Then I used to
try to estimate the number of drops, measure them, weigh them.

What a superb chÃ¢teauâthis Amboise! I admire its bulk, its
age. It is no wonder that kings have lived here! Amplitude. Privacy. Gardens.
The gardens tempt me to walk on and on. Yesterday, I sketched the Tour des
Minimesâemphasizing its massive base line, the skillful masonry; as I sketched
a playful squirrel climbed a birch, flipped from branch to branch, nibbled. I
must rememÂ­ber to sketch the bronze doors of the chapel. The sculptor stresses
texture in his composition. Somehow Florentine!

Wander...

I wander...

I wander alone or with Francesco.

Inside the chÃ¢teau, if it is raining or cold or misty, we
prowl through the halls and public rooms. Halls, rooms, people. A door opens
and there is someone. A door shuts, and you are alone with a dozen doors. Cold
windows merge into cold mirrors, a door opens. Here are tapestries from Bruges.
Someone coughs. Feminine laughter sounds.

As I walked toward Cloux, lights blinked in window after
window; a light apÂ­peared in my studio; someone passed carrying a torch.
Maturina has a fire in my fireplace. She has the table set for Francesco and
me. Glaring at me she scolds me for my damp clothes. âYour cough...you know!
You never think of yourself. Your supper has been ready a long time. Iâve asked
Francesco to look after you but he forgets. Only yesterday I said to him...â

Whenever the Egyptian sultan presented the Florentines with
a new animal, I made sketches. At one time, there were several lions in the
townâs menagerie. An old lion had a stubby grey mane and a black splotch across
his face. Since one of his paws was crippled, he limped badly. As he walked or
stretched out in the summer sun, a friendly ibis often pecked about in his fur.
Old and wise, he ate only two or three times a week...and outlived younger
lions. Bruno, a keeper, let me measure him. Skull. Neck. Spine. Shoulders.
Rump. Paws.

I suggested large cages for the menagerie animals but no one
listened. When I designed a cage for a lion on two levels, with a tree in a
corner, nothing came of it.

One night, in winter, a friar opened a cage and let a sick
lion go; for days the young man had tried to cure the female. Running amok
through town, she creÂ­ated quite a scare until she was trapped in a cul-de-sac
by some of my apprenÂ­tices. Muzzled, growling, she was returned to her cage
where she died.

It was only a few blocks from my studio to the menagerie and
I often heard the animals roar while I worked.

Cloux.

Cage.

Our incessant feuds, wars, brutalities, our pettiness, have
rotted our minds.

For years I have heard men describe roads frozen with sleet
and dead, bloody ambuscades, military gear trapped in mud, mules and horses
floundering, desoÂ­lated villages. I have seen victory and defeat...Milan...
Pisa...Bologna... Perugia...

Surrounded by death, I have known many men who want more and
more of it. I have remembered that as I painted my mural, my
Anghiari
.
Some of my war sketches have been aberrations. It would have been wiser had I
confined myself to my atelier. Among my drawings, sketches, cartoons, models,
among my plants and fossils, I should have gone on and on painting. Who, better
than I, through my anatomical studies, know the marvels of life! Now, I shun
crossbows, guns, chariots. I have asked Francesco to destroy those sketches.

Once again, as in Florence, as in my youth, I am putting art
foremost. I am painting.

Tomorrow,
Francesco and I will go along the Loire, sketching. If tomorrow is a rainy day
we will try the next day. I think he is overly concerned with the problems of
perspective. We will talk about the elimination of detail.

Painter and friend, I am lucky to have Francesco, my
Cecchino!

These days, I sleep longer, but, through the years, in
Florence, in Milan, I never slept more than three or four hours a night. There
were too many plans, sketches, paintings, bronzes, portraits, models,
commissions...three or four hours...that was enough...

Lie down, sleep...catch the dawn, the window shutters open.
Mist on the Arno. Plunge face in icy water in that old white wash basin. Tie
sketch pad onto belt. The town is sleeping; the birds are waking up. Careful,
open the door quiÂ­etly. Donât disturb Andrea. Is that the moon, still hanging
in the sky?

I made my way to the Boboli Gardens...passed the
David
...rows
of crooked cypress...marble satyr...pool of frogs...a beggar whined...

A town sleeps a thousand years every night.

Cloux

Occasionally, while playing chess, I imagine there are no
pawns; I imagine there are no knights; the good bishop has vanished; the castle
has gone; there is no stalemate; instead, we are walking across checkered
fields, Caterina and I. Soon, weâll sit down to supper; then, when candles have
burned low and lamps are dying down, weâll lie in each otherâs arms.

I have never been a clever chess player: I have spoiled
games by envisioning a spiral staircase, by designing a parachute or estimating
the cost of draining a marsh instead of planning my next move. I can cast
bronze better than tackle chess strategy.

When King Francis and I play, I know the rulesâthose
unwritten rulesâand abide by them: the king must win.

Checkmate...what are the rules in life...checkmate...how to
play the final move?

Someday our earth may be burdened with people (but I will
not be there).

Numbers cheapen us.

Collective folly weakens us.

Man and art drift apart.

However, who can create man? For that matter, who can create
a common pigeon? Or the mangiest dog? Or a horse?

And there is such mystery in this arm, this wrist, these
fingers as I write. I would like to be able to trace these impulses: the
thought, as it takes place in the brain, the thought as it becomes the letter
L, as it becomes da Vinci, as that word connects with another word.

A dot becomes a sketch. A sketch becomes a tree (a tree
becomes a sketch). Must there be limitations to the mindâs probings? Experience
can shackle us. I resent shackles. I still believe in flying.

I love the horse more than all the animals because he gives
me a sense of flying. Racing across a field, half-naked, bareback, I was free
as a boy. I was above the earth. Galloping along a road, my cape fluttering, I
was outside myself. Trotting underneath the stars I sensed another kind of
freedom. The clopping of the horse was a drumbeat for liberty. I was often
carried away.

Nuzzling my hand, I stroked his head, thanking him for this
ecstasy.

March 2, 1517

Yesterday, a traveler, a Spaniard, a navy officer, a guest
of the King, claimed at dinner that a Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n, had
discovered a land, and named it Florida. He said that Ponce de Leon discovered
it four or five years ago.

âWhere is Florida? Is it an island?â

I had a page bring my maps but the Spaniard could not locate
Florida. He was ill at ease as if he had divulged a state secret. The arrogant
officerâs face still bothers me, like the face of a diseased rat. Florida? A
Spanish name: does it have a special meaning?

âMon Capitan was hunting for Bimini...the fountain, the
great fountain, that cures all diseases,â the officer said, pushing aside my
maps, less like a traveler than a spoiled child.

Travel...

Francesco has never read the
Travels of Marco Polo
,
but he is reading the book to me; he reads in the afternoons, maybe when the
warm sun is in our western windows, maybe at the pergola, if it is pleasant.
Sometimes, when I am tired, he reads to me by candlelight, beside my ducal bed.

I respect Marco Polo. I believe what he wrote. He was no
millioni
.
He was fortunate to find a Rustichello to record his story. Perhaps Francesco
is mine. When I visited Poloâs prison cell in Genoa someone showed me the
painstaking calendar he had chiseled into the wall beside his cot...Chinese
characters along the top section of the calendarâa dragon underneath.

In Florence, in Andreaâs home, I read Poloâs book and
dreamed of crossing the Lop Desert on camelback; I imagined visiting the Khanâs
great cities; I dreamed of sketching palaces, temples, courtiers. I wanted to
climb lofty mounÂ­tains; I thought of mapping rivers.

I told this to Francesco; he smiled and nodded. India?
China? Tibet? For him they are words. He thinks only of his Italy, his Vaprio. I
am afraid he considers that I have stolen years from his homeland by keeping
him here. He writes his mother and father faithfully; when there are lapses in
their correspondence he is troubled.

AlasâSalai and Tony have left me!

At Cloux they have spent less and less time at their
painting on their own or under my tutelage. They have become infatuated by the
Kingâs womenâthe prostitutes. Finally, in desperation, I urged them to return
to Florence. Tony has serious family problems and is needed. Salai plans to
build a house for himself, on my vineyard property. I will miss them... I will
miss them! They have been an important part of my life! Francesco is pleased
there will be no more rivalry and friction. Yet, apart from that, ours was a
sad farewell, lingering, the wind blowing about us harshly. It was our last
good-bye, I know. I know. They promise to write to me. When are letters alive!

NOTEâBaron Sabran visited me last week. We strolled about
the chÃ¢teau, and he related another of his wild boar stories as he glanced over
some of my paintings. I enjoyed his visit, his chattiness, his effort to be
friendly.

Today,
I hear that he has passed away: Time...todayâs friend, tomorrowâs enemy.

Cloux

How well I remember:

I was riding with other horsemen, perhaps a dozen of us,
Duke Lorenzo on his favorite mare, both of us a little to the front of the
Medici pennants, flags, and jousting gear. As we approached the Dukeâs stables
at a canter, he leaned toward me, and said:

âHeâs yours, Leonardo... I know you like him! Tell the
stable boys where you want to have him kept.â

A smile, no more.

Cheppo was a three-year-old, four-gaited, almost as
distinguished in bone and muscle as Cermonino, yet wider across the withers. I
sketched him, studied him, studied him as I had studied Cermonino. Cheppo had a
way of shaking his mane, flopping out his upper lipânuzzling. He was a
competent beggar: if I failed to remember a treat he would squeeze me against
the stable wall and regard me sadly. Once I was in the saddle he was obedient,
alert.

Cheppo had been Lorenzoâs favorite. Certainly no one else
could have given him more competent training than the Duke. I was so pleased to
have him and spoiled him, until I left for Milanânever to find another his
equal.

My mirror writing came naturally; it began as a boy; I have
always been ambiÂ­dextrous; yet my left handâs skill surpasses that of the
right. There were reasons for my mirror writing: for abbreviations and symbols,
the prying of idle apprenÂ­tices, the intrusion of rivals, the circumvention of
blabbers. It also satisfied me personallyâesthetically.

Tonight, I am alone, writing: the manor house is still.

It is raining hard, and has been raining hard throughout the
day. The fire in the fireplace is comfortable. The lamps are well trimmed.

As I sat at my desk, continuing the journal, someone tried
to pry open the door lock. Metal on metal. I waited. Again I heard the
intruder. The rain beat on the door; the door shook. I heard the lock give.
Picking up a broken easel leg I waited, in case the lock gave way. The man
outside coughed. He shuffled about, then left.

Perhaps I should get a dog.

Devotion is the
best quality, human devotion and devotion to oneâs art. CerÂ­tainly my devotion
to Francescoâtrust and affectionâhas been reciprocated.

And,
when I am dead, he will remember me. That is what artists needâmen who care. If
there are those who care, it is as if oneâs atelier continues on and on. And,
if the apprentices think along the guidelines already laid down, that is anÂ­other
continuation, another defiance.

One of these days, Francesco will return to his Vaprio, to
paint. He may set up a studio in Milan. Perhaps there will come a time when he
places a canvas and sits on his stool and paints my beard, thinning hair,
protruding eyebrows, strange nose and strange eyes.

He will say to himself:

âThatâs how the old man looked, at Cloux.

âShall I paint on open window behind him...shall I paint
some rock formaÂ­tions in the distance?â

Although the King and his court go out of their way to
befriend me I could not tolerate this voluntary exile, this foreignness, this
remoteness, were it not for Francesco. When he is away, at the chÃ¢teau, in the
village, in Paris, traveling somewhere, I am at a loss. I glance about: where
is he? When will he return?

Often, when Cecchino comes back from one of his rambles, he
has a gift or two, a plant, a seed, a leaf, a rock...he tells me what happened,
details. Heâs good at verbal paintings. Excited sometimes. No matter. He may
have sketches to show me, charcoal, pencil, chalk.

âThis
is something you must take a look at, Maestro...here, this face? Isnât it
Greek, the nose, the forehead? And this gypsy woman, what about her? And this
fellow...ever see anyone dressed like that? And this fountain...â

He sits on a bench beside my easel.

âWe
must ride to Paris...we must visit Cluny...the churches...thereâs a great Van
Eyck...and Chambord...now is the time to visit Chambord, when the courtâs
away...we ought to see how your canal and irrigation jobs are coming
along...remember, Sr. Migliarotti is pretty lazy...â

Francesco hopes to make me feel like I am thirty years old.

It is May and I am in the Amboise garden, soaking up the
noon sun, courtiers milling about on the many paths; yet I am alone, with my
sketchbook, to write, to think. And I am thinking about Francesco, how he
arrived at my studio in the pouring rain. Drenched. He had ridden from Vaprio.
I donât forget that rain, that stormy Florentine afternoon, that eager, wet
face of his, his mud-spattered horse, his servantsâ horses, how they looked in
the street, as Francesco spoke to me. Cold, very cold, even for April. Tiled
roofs were choked with rain. Drowned cobbles. Leaves and mud.

But there he was at my door, bowing, smiling.

âMaestro da Vinci...I want to be your pupil.â

That was seventeen years ago. Was he only fifteen? It
doesnât seem possible he was so young. He was my favorite from the start. I
love Salai as a son, but this young man, this gracious young man, is friend and
ardent disciple. Painter! When I have been his guest at Vaprio, I am honored.
Francescoâs father and mother make their villa a place of rest. I know. I have
fled there, from the
condottieri
. I am always protected by the Melzis.

His
illness upset the studio.

âMelziâs sick! Francescoâs sick!â

Fever day after day, hands like ice, coma. Shivering though
his apartment was sunny. I thought he might have malaria. The plague. I called
in the best doctors; I sent for Francescoâs father. His uncle came instead.
Other doctors came. And in his delirium, Francesco painted a large canvas, with
a flock of white birds in the sky, carrying a blue tree. October, Novemberâbad
months for sickness. But by December he was up, skinny, hungry, forever hungry.

And there was his fatherâs gratitude to me, his uncleâs
gratitude, as if I had been the physician. That summer, as Francesco
convalesced at Vaprio, I vacaÂ­tioned there. The family purchased my portrait of

A Boy
. That rolling land, the swift Adda, those canals, the villa
gardens with their Roman statues and roses...roses...the women in the gardens,
picking roses. But I have written about this before? ...I am getting forgetful.

We sketched and painted.

I remember a puppy lying in my lap as I dozed in one of the
gardens, the one with the apple trees. Good food, good wine, summer, that was
Villa Vaprio. I learned about summer thereâwhat summer really means.

Cloux

The King wants me to move to a spacious studio in the
chÃ¢teau. I prefer a smaller room. Small rooms sometimes discipline the mind. I
have explained that my studio, in the manor house, has everything essential to
my work: cupboards, cabinets, tables, shelves.

âDo you need pigment...oils...turpentine...brushes?â He is
impatient... you must want something!

We
have space for our paintings. We have the right amount of light. We have quiet.
And on our mantelpiece we have a place for my Greek and Roman antiqÂ­uitiesâthings
I collected in Campania (along with malaria): iridescent vases, bronze and
alabaster lamps, household figurines, a few coins. I have one with a porpoise
leaping. The Greeks were master minters-designers. Francesco says he knows a
place in Paris that sells Greek antiquities. If I can ever get there I want to
purchase an ivory Venus for my desk. We have not surpassed those ancient
artisans.

Such things make a bright enclosure.

I am fortunate...I have had many friends.

I had many friends in Florence, Milan, Rome, Genoa, and
Venice. I shall name a few: Marco dâOggiono, Vitelli, Tomaso Masini, Amalia,
Father Pacioli, Ferrera, Machiavelli, Francesco, Mona, Cristofer, Andrea...and
now King Francis.

I see them in
my sketches as I leaf through them now and then: Benci, in pen and ink, beside
a juniper tree; Andrea, at work on a bronze figurine; here is a pastel of
Ambrogia, puttering over his careful palette; here is red-headed Filippo Lippi
finishing the background for a madonna; here is Cecelia, sipping wine, asking
for sweets...Madonna Lisa and her graceful beauty, her soft voice, paÂ­tience...

She and I had many hours for the
gamboa
...we ate
together...played cards, talked about my
Anghiari
...when she posed I had
singers for her... I loaned her little sums; she lent me money; she sent me
baskets of fruit; I gave her sketches and drawings.

If all these friends could be with me, at Cloux, to walk
with me, visit the chÃ¢teau and its gardens, prowl the mirror hallways, enjoy my
studio, my latest paintings...talk...talk...

As an apprentice I longed to fix in my mind every detail: I
must look and look, a second and a third time and a fourth. I must fill a
notebook. Quickly. I must follow that bearded Corsican and draw his face.

All of us apprentices respected Andrea del Verrochio, as
artisan, as teacher. We were at home in his workshop. We were proud of his
accomplishments, proud of our own accomplishments; at the same time we were
eager, pushy, ready to challenge other artists. Ready to consider a commission,
evaluate it, carry it through to perfection.

And what were my best years, the best of my mature years, I
ask myself? Those dedicated to my mural, my outcry against war, years that
included many paintings? Or was it the time dedicated to the creation of the
Sforza horseâIL COLOSSO? If I could have had the metal and cast the statue it
would have been that success above others. And the years that went into
The
Last Supper
: Three years. There were also the years of dissection and
anatomical studies. Best years? There were the easel paintings. I suppose there
have never been any best years. There were discoveries and discovery made
another discovery possible...and so the years went along.

Last night, Francesco burst into my bedroom.

âI canât find them,â he exclaimed.

âWhat?â

âI have looked everywhere...your letters are missing.â

âWhat letters, Francesco?â

âI have your list...letters from King Francis...from Duke
Lorenzo...from Christopher Columbus...Machiavelli...Father Pacioli...Beatrice
dâEste...
CesÂ­are Bor
Â­gia...Salai...â

âDid you open the trunk in the storeroom? They may be in
there. Look careÂ­fully. I want to destroy some of them...letâs go over
everything together.â

âWe had them in Milan...â

âLook again... Iâm sure youâll find them.â

(Yesterday,
in the chÃ¢teauâs hall of mirrors I saw Caterina: she was talking with a young
man, a man her age: she had on a summer gown, with one breast almost bare: she
smiled at her companion who was dressed in grey.)

Cloux

June 1, 1517

After I completed my silverpoint of Francis, he ordered his
tailor to cut an elegant velvet smock for me. In carnelian. Two pockets. Belt
of silver lozenges hooked together on braided silver wires.

Francesco is framing the portrait and it will hang in the
chÃ¢teau library, along with a Rafael, a de Predis, a Bosch, a DÃ¼rer. Francis
has his eyes on Francescoâs new canvas, his
Columbine
, but I tell the
King it is not finished.

âNot finished? Of course it is finished, Mon PÃ¨re.â But
Francesco listens to me.

I continue with my drawings of the deluge: I go on with the
terror, the falling of buildings, the erosion of life, the force of wind, the
weight of torrents... I go on with this feeling... I must express it.

The gloomy air must be beaten by the wind and perpetual
hail...there must be ancient trees, uprooted trees, torn to pieces by the
fury...the fragments of mountains must spill into valleys...immensity must
burst the barrier of rivers.

It is my last judgment...certainly there is nothing that
does not have an ending ...twisted forms...fear...puny man...

I hear the resounding air, the lamentations.

Mountains
are to be torn open for their minerals...all animals will languish...all will
be pursued or destroyed...trees will be laid level...due to manâs malice there
will be great losses...how much better for man to go back to hell.

Cloux

It is late.

A fire burned all evening in my studio, and King Francis has
sat by the fire with me, talking. He was depressed because bankers have been
demanding exorÂ­bitant sums: he plans to sell royal titles to recoup funds.

âAll this will take months...there are many hazards...â

Abruptly:

âDo you see something in my face, something ominous?â

âI donât understand...â

âIt seems to me...I feel that the future has something
tragic... Iâm worried... Do you believe in foretelling?â

He had been jousting: I blamed fatigue. But he would not be
put aside by a few casual words.

âMon PÃ¨re...tell me...some say that you can foretell? Is that
true?â

âI can not.â

âWho can?â

âNobody.â

âNobody?â

âDivinations...those occult doings...forget them. You must
think clearly, your Majesty. Donât let men hoodwink you. Nobody knows
tomorrow.â

âTonight, as I walked through the tunnel from the
chÃ¢teau...tonight I had three guards... I was afraid...like a
Borgia...assassinations...pretty bad...â

He laughed at himself.

It has been sunny and cool for several days: I have gone on
pleasant walks, along the river, through the chÃ¢teau gardens, through the grove
that leads into the Kingâs forest: paths are becoming familiar: I shake hands
with old trees. At the chÃ¢teau I have watched the King play tennis: they are
having a tournament. Francis plays with ugly ferocity. His partners play
warily. I see that diplomacy begins on the tennis courts.

Studio

September 3, 1517

My lamp is guttering. Candle stubs are smoking.

Was it thirty years ago, in Milan, that I understood?
Windows were open and heat-lightning was flickering beyond my studio. My
anatomy drawings were spread on the corner table. Then I saw. Saw clearly.
Knew. Saw that manâs blood resembles the tides of the sea; from the seat of the
heart it circulated throughout the body. Let an artery or vein burst or suffer
injury and blood raced to the inÂ­jured spot. Incessant currents of the blood,
passing through the arteries and veins, caused them to thicken and become
callous. So, I had additional proof of circulation. Each dissection revealed
further confirmation of the system. Why was I slow in grasping the obvious?

I have explained my theory to some but was often rebuffed
and yet when I told herâusing my drawingsâshe grasped the significance. She
understood many things. And when she lay dying there seemed little left for
me... I held her hand. Her eyes were closed. Grey eyes. She never spoke. God,
how I stumbled down those rat infested stairs, stairs with a cross gouged in
each step. Ah, those flooded streets!

Some men of science and art have copies of my first
treatise. Some. They hesitate. Resent. Last year I explained circulation to
King Francis. He was not interested; he fondled his diamond-studded belt and
stared stupidly at me. I must tell Francesco that the treatise is packed in the
third trunkâthe one with the smashed lock.

I must sequence my drawings:

1 - Skin

2 - Muscles

3 - Tendons

4 - Bones

Indicate effect of emotions, labor, illness, age.

Cloux

October 15, 1517

Francesco is copying this:

I have been unable to write or work for several days. These
days she is in my mind all of the time. Maturina begs me to eat...my appetite
has gone. The weather is perfect but I can not go outside. Here, in my studio,
I have her porÂ­trait to console me; sometimes I have to turn away from it. I
thought that she would live for many years. I thought that she was contented.
Her family loved her.

The letter, written by her brother, says nothing about how
Mona died. Was she ill a long while? I canât remember when she wrote me last
time...was it as much as a year ago? Why am I confused? Did the plague kill
her? Was she with her family? How they will miss her! The letter took four
months to reach meâa hundred and twenty days! She died in Genoa, on the 2nd or
3rd of July. I canât make out the date.

The King knows of her death. Francesco told him, because I
can not ride with the hunters... I can not ride... Francis has presented me
with a small jeweled hourglass. A note accompanied it.

Life and death...old friends, old enemies.

My face is a cemetery.

Gossips said that Mona was my mistress.

We were friends.

In those days, when I was beginning her portrait, I had
Gorgio play for her: she liked his viola da gamba skill. He would usually
appear a little late, but always with a smile, a bow. Sometimes a choir boy
sang motets; it seems to me he reÂ­cited poetry too. Did he always wear a brown
cloak?

Our sittings were often far apart: there was illness in her
family: she was away from Florence for months at a time: on her return it was
hard to recapture our mood. She was patient with me but I have often stood
before her picture quite perplexed...especially if the light had changed...my
colors had changed.

I was late for one of our sittings and she put on an apron
and scrubbed brushes and mortars, made my apprentices scurry; then laughed at
my objecÂ­tions.

âNext time youâre late, Iâll clean your leggio,â she said,
and smiled teasingly.

Her smile...I used to think of it as hiding family secrets,
feminine secrets, her own loneliness (âYes, Leonardo...yes...there are
times...â)

I could not always arrange for a musician; when she posed
during those silences I felt the bonds of our friendship...when we ate
together, when she described her travels, it was another aspect of our
friendship.

I was welcome at her home. Her distinguished husband bought
fine pieces of art. They were happy to share.

At her home and in my studio we often talked about my
Anghiari

and she was eager to follow its progression.

October 29th

Masculine skies...feminine skies...at this season of the
year they are mostly masculine, with snow falling, wind blowing. My feet are
cold because of the weather, or is it because my fireplace chimney needs
cleaning? Cold, I have moved to the library.

As I mull over my papers I observe the great books around
me. I must conÂ­centrate. I must push on. There is so much to be done with the
organization of my treatises. So much.

Maturina rouses me.

âYou are cold, Maestro...it is chilly in this room.â

So, I am cold!

Perhaps I have cathedral sickness!

It is good to be writing again. My journal suffers when my
hand is unsteady.

Francesco is away; that troubles me.

I wish I were young and could bend horseshoes instead of two
sheets of paper.

Maturina has found a bird stricken by the cold; we hover
over it. A dove. A flyer. Where are my sketches for the glider? The one
Francesco and I tested. He must find it for me when he returns.

Interruptions...interruptions...

Francesco has adopted a stray cat, from among the dozens
that haunt the chÃ¢teau. The cat beds under his easel, among cleaning rags. He
always stinks of turpentine and oil.

I
have never seen a cat so eager to sleep; perhaps half of his life has gone into
carousing. He is bone white, has one orange ear, a twisted nose, one orange
foot, and a black-tipped tail. His greenish eyes glare out of skinniness.

Crabby.

Maturina hates him.

Francesco calls him âMichelangelo.â

My four-poster must have been made for a cardinal or bishop,
or someoneâs mistress. I am tempted to remove the garnet canopy and drapes. But
itâs a snug bed when itâs cold. I often lie there and watch the fire playing
about. Itâs a chance to weigh the pastâand plan ahead.

Sometimes, when I am very tired and have turned in early,
Francesco rolls his easel into the room, and sits on the side of the bed and we
talk brush strokes or ways of grinding the new pigments, how much overpainting is
feasible, the danÂ­gers of black as an under pigment. Shop talk.

Cloux

Andrea Salainoâ
Why
did I adopt him in the first place?

Thatâs an easy answer: because I loved him!

What a waif Salai was! I took him into my household, my
studio, twenty-some years ago. It canât be possible that so much time has
lapsed.

He
stole...stole shirts, shoes, brushes, gold leaf. He stole gold leaf and sold
it. He took money. I was right to christen him âSalai.â It took months to
straighten him out...if I really did. Yellow-headed, curly-headed, tall,
foolish, loveable... when he puts his arm around me...

He is a capable artist, incapable of continuous effort;
perhaps time can change him but I doubt it.

Now that he is gone...I often think I hear his voice... I
think, ah, he has come back for a while...

The King and Queen have asked me how I had hoped to cast
Il
Cavallo
, so I placed my drawings on tables in the salon, and we walked from
one to another and I explained them.

âMon
PÃ¨re,â Francis mumbled, as he examines drawings and sketches, âMon PÃ¨re...these
are workable.â

I am silent.

âWhen did you begin actual casting?â the Queen asks. I try
to disregard her obvious skepticism.

She is dressed in white and gold; he has on one of his dark
cloaks lined with down; he has rings set with emeralds; she reeks of cologne
and sweat. Her pinched face is regally uglyâsomehow provincial.

âI began casting the horse in December...â93...casting it on
its side. I placed the mould in a shallow cavity. I opened it on the left side.
I could have comÂ­pleted the casting if there had been sufficient bronze. I am
sure you know that cannons had priority at that time.â

They knew, too, about the Gascon bowmen.

I understand they had watched the archers, as they used my
clay model for target. Watched my
Cavallo
disintegrate.

I watched, hating, hating those bowmen. How they cheered as
arrows pierced the model.

Now
I watched the King and Queen.

âIn Milan, in those days, the Sforza stables were at my
disposal. I chose a magnificent horseâCermoninoâas my model. Alone, or with a
groom, I would ride into the country, where it was pleasant and we were free of
gapers. I would dismount and sketch my horse. Or the groom would lead him back
and forth, while I sketched, to record a sense of motion.

âOther times I would ride Cermonino, race him, sweat him;
then Iâd draw his distended mouth, his swollen nostrils, his wild mane...

âLeaning
forward in the saddle, baton in hand, the Duke was to symbolize leadership and
power...he was pleased...his baton would have been more than thirty feet above
the ground.â

Visitors and courtiers annoy me, though I do not show my
annoyance. I have learned how to patronize. I pretend I have nothing to do...my
life is one of leiÂ­sure. Then, at night, through most of the night, lamps and
candles burning, Francesco and I work with my drawings and texts.

Francesco realizes that I am homesick but he does not quite
realize that I am homesick for a Florence that does not exist. I donât admit it
but I am also reÂ­membering Vinci, the only home I ever had. I would like to
walk into the ramÂ­bling stone house and sit by a front window. I would
like...but why go on?

Botteghe
or ateliers have their points but they are
never home. Guilds, with their rivalries, their rascalities, are continually
broiling. Greedy apprentices. Raw apprentices. Rowdiness. So many crowns for
this piece of work, so many
soldi
for this job. Dissension over models.
Spats about religion. Muddy sex.

Perhaps I should have lived out my life in my vineyard. Much
sun. Quietude. Animals. Olive trees in the sunset. The mistral. Peasants.
Fidelity.

What delusions.

Tomorrow I look forward to working again on my
Saint John
.
I have decided to darken the background.

I knew Sandro Botticelli well. Now that he is dead and I am
far away, leaving this personal journal to a mere boy, I can write about him.
We called Sandro âOur Little Barrel.â He was fat enough, to be sure. Success
favored his belly. Drink gave him a pleasant stupor.

I thought his
Primavera
a piece of ostentation: the
picture flaunts showmanÂ­ship in many ways. The background is especially weak. I
have shied away from gigantic canvases. A painting should not pretend to be a
mural or a fresco.

However, Sandroâs illustrations for Dante have a lightness:
his lines are right.

Maybe I am not respectful of Sandro. Michelangelo dislikes
my work. Who is right?

When my fellow Florentines legally murdered Savonarola I was
repelled. Savonarola was reformer, dictator, fanatic. His bigotry alarmed me;
all bigotry alarms me. I prefer the Alpine heights and passes to heavenly
promises; I prefer rivers and lakes to the Dantesque. Savonarolaâs ashes were
thrown into the Arno... I anticipate further degradations...ashes... whose
ashes were thrown into the river? Ours? No matter what we say in defense of religion
there seems to be another road. Some things surpass religion. My motherâs
gentleness, for one thing. I say, let us worship beauty. Now, in my old age, I
say let us worship beauty.

Thinking of beauty, I hoped for many years to do a bronze of
Hercules, HerÂ­cules firing his arrow at the Stymphalian birds, head back, eyes
upward, his right arm tensing the cord, fingers ready to let the arrow go:
Hercules in the nude, among rocks, one knee cocked at the same angle as his bow
arm.

February 1, 1518

I

t is snowing again.

The ground is white. Trees are white. About two years ago,
on our long ride from Milan, we stayed at the Pericord Monastery; snow was
falling. Outside my one-eyed cell lay a deep drift. A path led nowhere through
the snow.

While
at Pericord, most of us ate in the refectory or the kitchen. Were there thirty
monks at the monastery? All of them were dirty and resentful. This herÂ­mitage
wanted no outsiders. Although we paid, we were gross intruders. This order had
the Biblical fish engraved on its coat-of-arms but these men no longer
remembered what that symbol meant.

Bread, cheese, dried fruit, sunflower seeds, eggs, wine,
herbal teaâthey ofÂ­fered us these and we tried to express our thanks.

Each enormous deal table had IHS chiseled in its center.
IHS...smoke from cheap table candles mixed with kitchen smoke as we ate with
shutters closed against the snow and cold.

Painted black, a large wooden cross leaned against a corner
of the refectory.

Fealty far from any hamletâwhat is this monastic fealty?

As I stayed there, recovering, troubled, I compared those
thirty faces with the faces of the disciples in my
Last Supper
: I
understand more about human nature now than I did twenty years ago. So did the
artist who had painted a primitive fresco of demons in the Pericord Library.
His demons are Borgian nightmares.

We have more snow this winter than in many winters, I am
told. The Loire has frail ice edges and some of that ice traps leaves and twigs
and resembles torÂ­tured stained glass. I like to walk alone, along the
riverâsnow tracking: fox, rabÂ­bit, deer, raccoon, and boar.

Snow crystals in my hand, on my glove, I analyze their
geometry.

In
the comfort of my studio I sketch from memory: I am able to reproduce plants,
birds, people, machines. Years ago I lost an important sketchbook and was able
to reproduce more than fifty drawings. Any capable artist should be able to do
this.

As the snowfall continues, I shall go on tonight, red chalk
and charcoal.

Rome proved to be a harsh experience.

Living
in the Vatican was an impoverishment: the roof of my apartment leaked with
every rain; the light was bad; sewage odors were frequent. Gaminsâso many
gamins! Threatened. While others hunted rabbits in the Coliseum, I sought
libraries and worked in my own laboratory. But work was difficult beÂ­cause my
old kidney complaint afflicted me. For a time I was at the Hospital Spirito. I
became as desolate as Hadrianâs Tomb. I ate only fruit and nuts, but fruit is
often scarce in Rome at certain seasons.

Rafael was friendly; Paciola was faithful; Bramante was
friendly. I blame the city, its somber tufa buildings. Cities, like mistresses,
betray. Fleeing Rome, I visited my vineyard; then, again lured by the wrong
magnet, I returned for more Roman punishment.

Tibullus and Ovid were there. I opened their pages and read.
But my optical experiments were thwarted: a violent quarrel with my optical
expert undid the work of months. He smashed all the equipment in my laboratory.
As soon as possible, half-recovered, I joined Salai and Francesco in Milan.
They had located an apartment for me, Salai lauding its grand style, its
perfect studio. But the stuÂ­dio was not for me. Milan was not for me. At
Vaprio, I began to recover in the bracing air. My friends helped deceive me: I
was not growing old; so, I began a little fresco for the Melzis.

Throughout my life I have been willing to attempt various
disciplines. I am alien to most men because they limit their interests. Almost
all of my friends thought in terms of a single field of endeavor. Ambrogio
cared nothing for geolÂ­ogy. De Predis shunned mathematics. Boltraffio scorns
cartography. Fra Luca shrugs off all but church music. Luini favors frescos.
Who is interested in oceanÂ­ography? Or flying?

I think men should reach out. A rut can lead to a dead end.
The portrait artist need not paint portraits all his life. Andrea was one of
those rarities (an inspiraÂ­tion!): his world was brush, pastel, oil...marble,
bronze, porphyry...cenotaph, altar, sarcophagus...portrait.

Cloux

March 12, 1518

Sleep comes hard: there is frequent pain in my back and
legs: insomnia exhausts me: I think of stairways, dikes, weaving machines,
cylindrical sails, cadavers, faces...

Many times I have seen Christâs faceâas I painted him in my
fresco. I remember him, lying in his ghetto... I remember him so ill he could
scarcely walk... I remember taking food to him...there, over there, on the
wall, is his face in the candlelight.

Sleepless, I have gotten up and sketched those who have been
dead for years. Friends, neighbors, filthy seamen on the coast, mountaineers,
shepherds, brigÂ­ands at the Borgia castle.

Here, at Cloux, I have found a girl whose profile is
perfect: I have asked her to pose for a silverpoint.

Here, in the heart of France, when I am listening to
Francesco talk French I am listening to a clever Frenchman. He could speak the
language fairly well before comingâhe has perfected his pronunciation, his
pauses. He says he learned from a boyhood tutor. I ask him to correct me but he
never does. Most of our chÃ¢teau friends speak several languages. When I am
explaining technical drawings to the King or members of his court I have to
have help when it comes to the vocabulary relating to hydraulics, gears,
fossils, and such.

March 18, 1518

My journal is in danger.

Time is leaving me.

I go weeks without adding a thought.

If I see a horse riddled with arrows, a mural that is
scaling offâwhere is the joy? Where the beauty?

Letâs go to that valley along the Adda River, in May. We
were laughing then: being alive pleased us. Letâs go to Piombino where I
sketched the little ships in the harbor, ships and pounding waves. Letâs walk
in the castle garden, among the senatorial statues; I played the lute and both
of us sang. And Rusticiâs! What about Rusticiâs and that pet porcupine of his?

In Pavia, I lost my way among narrow lanes; it was dusk; it
was summer; it became dark; a lantern appeared, another; I found myself at a
house of prostituÂ­tion: the loveliness of that meeting, those unexpected
caresses, that girl... O, sleeper, what is sleep? Sleep resembles death. Yet,
there are happy dreams. And actual dreams, such as rolling the
Colossus

into the square and seeing the Milan populace mill around it. And another...my
mother, Caterina, embracing me when last we met.

There have been other dreams: working with wood and silk, to
perfect a wing...there was that brief moment of flight...my wing...being
aloft...lifted above trees and town... I feel that lift as I write. Joy.
Beauty.

There were rows of candles and water-lamps shining in front
of my
Last Supper
; I stepped back to contemplate my work; I looked
around; I realized that the fresco was finished. I felt tears of joy, tears
that never fell, yet existed. I felt another overÂ­whelming satisfaction in my
Anghiari
:
the horses were alive and came to me as I looked at them... I remembered their
names.

Andrea Verrochio came through the refectory door and shook
my hand. When I write to him I will remind him...but he is dead.

I have always thought the penis handsome during copulation,
otherwise pitiÂ­ful. I have never worshipped it as have some menâand women! As a
boy it was tantalizing, always there, always a reminder of sex, most often a
mystery. I saw copulation enjoyed before I enjoyed it with a girl. It seemed to
me that it wasnât much fun. I had to mature. It seems to me that the penis
often has a life of its own, as during the night when it rouses a man, a
sentiency of its own perhaps. I note that women like the size of the penis as
large as possible, but a man wants the opposite in a womanâs organ.

The Greeks and Romans were
penis worshippers. As a fertilityÂ  symbol it
amuses me. I wonder how the
Egyptians regarded the penis? They have had centuries to think about it. Young
women enjoy disÂ­playing their breasts; some men want to show their masculinity.
There is something quite amusing about these sex thoughts. Juvenile! Life has
so many serious problems: hunger, plague, crime. The ecclesiastics laud the
cross and crucifixion; I suspect that some of their fervor is part of the penis
contemplation. With the penis there can be a kind of holy ecstasy, for certain.
I had an ivory penis in my studio in Florence: was it African? Some thought it
Babylonian. It does not matter.

Men will always fight among themselves, sexually,
politically, socially. I have realized this for years. Can it be that this
realization urged me to fly, to escape perversion and mediocrity? Flying can be
a celebration of the mind.

Well, sex means little to me now. Silence means more.
Friendship. Calm. Hope. Ai, those workshops of my youth were so noisy. On
crowded streets. Near alleys. Vendors howling their wares. Mule teams.
Horsemen. One of my workshops was close to a smithy. Steel on steel mixed with
palavering.

Amboise is my silent
bottega
, walkways, garden,
flowers. Here I have so many of my favorites: nasturtiums, ranunculas, roses,
poppies, violets, iris, pansies.

Maturina keeps flowers in my studio and my bedroom.

Writing in the sun along the Loire, remembering,
remembering
:

I
recall details of my dissections of pigeons... Sketching, measuring, I conÂ­centrated
on bone structure of the wings, then the tail, the balancing properties of the
entire bird. Using those dimensions I calculated wing lengths and wing widths
for my glider. I laid out a narrow area for a man to lie on, exactly between
the wings.

I constructed the glider with the aid of my apprentices. I
launched it at Mount Ceceri. Ceceri seemed the likeliest hill since wind
currents had to be strong, and constant. Men lifted, pushed, yelled.

âNow...now!â

I dipped into the wind, slid with the wind, lifted. It
seemed to me that I hovÂ­ered for a while above a big willow. Rooftops. Then, in
spite of my attempts at balancing, the wing swung down, dropped, spun... I
crashed.

That wing measured 15' x 3' x 9'.

I can visualize Milanâs pink and red buildings, its fortress
Castello between moats, its drawbridges, the fumbling city walls, the filthy
streets. Though not as old as Rome, I often felt Milanâs shabby antiquity. It
was a lesson in futility. So many sieges: 1497, 1500, 1512...military
engagements that disrupted every fiber of living. (There is nothing like the
filth of a city under siege.)

During the last siege, in 1515, the cannonades drove me out
of the city. In my absence my apartmentâwith its view of the Alpsâwas looted by
riffraff.

The city gates...I remember them: Porta Comasina, Porta
Romana, Porta OriÂ­entale. Near the Orientale I found a bronze figurine, on one
of my walks. Its small head had been uncovered by a recent rain. A priest, carrying
a rice bowl.

How
I worked during those Milanese years: apses, loggias, transepts, winÂ­dows,
frescos! Survival jobs. âThis door needs immediate repair...place that
medallion lower...no red marble here...â I could not equal Donato Bramanteâs
architectural skill. Friend, I wished him well.

Did I spend almost three years in the Castello, in those
maddening salas, those perfumed rooms? The only place to avoid the stench of
sewage. I urged the Duke to plan a city with upper and lower thoroughfares, a
city where there was air space to lessen the danger of plague. Fifty thousand
dead in â09.

Sieges...death...

Milan...all focused on my
cenasolo
...my
Maria
delle Grazie
...that refectory...that was my world...those faces, those
outspread hands, that table...there is more than one way to break bread...more
than one cup.

Cloux

It is satisfying to return to my study of curvilateral
stars: evenings, after I have had supper, I beginâif there are no royal
interruptions. The cat now curls at my feet, as I sit at my desk among my
lamps.

Perhaps Michelangelo and I can become friends.

To amuse him I roll balls of paper and snap them across the
floor. He respondsâwith an obvious effort.

I
work to reduce a segment of a circle proportionally so I can make any number of
identical segments which in sum are equal to a segment subtended by a side of a
hexagon inscribed in the circle. I can make any number of curvilateral stars of
which the sum of the triangles is equal to the sum of the segments subÂ­tended
by the side of a hexagon inscribed in a given circle.

I much prefer doing this to working on the plans for the
chÃ¢teau at RomoÂ­rantin.

The point of the center, where there is no movement,
suggests peace.

April 9th

Today, I had a brief letter from Salai.

I remember the Arno at sunset, the yellow and the gold, the
yellow underÂ­neath the gold, the gold identical to gold leaf, a metallic sunset
overlaid with misty hues, the bridges silhouetted, the darkest spans cut out of
charred steel. The force of sunlight lay between each bridge and turned the
river banks violet, the violet merging into cobalt.

Ai, to walk there, to think there, again!

As a boy I used to fish there, but never had much luck. Papa
insisted that the tastiest fish came from the Arno. He was a good fisherman and
should have known. Maybe fishing was better in his day. I wonder if there are
any fish in the Arno now?

Fishing or wading or splashing in the riverâthat was a half
century ago.

IL CAVALLO

I solved all the construction problems
in 1493. Bronze horse. Bronze rider. Weight of horse: 185,000 pounds. Horse to
measure 23 feet from hoof to mane. Total height: 34 feet from hoof to helmet of
rider. Total weight of horse and rider: 205,000 pounds.

The Horse:

We began to pour the metal at night, a team of sixteen men.
We had metal from salvage. Our caldrons blazed as the metals combined. We had
our supply of wood stacked under a thatch, another supply in a shed. As we
worked the shed ignited and burned. Shouts. Orders. Warnings.

Shortly before dawn some militiamen arrivedâdrums, not
sunrise. The
comÂ­mandante
of the city fortressesâon the Dukeâs
ordersârequisitioned all bronze for armament. I read the Dukeâs order... I
read, and stepped aside.

And the Duke lost his city, and his life. His horse.

Albiera Amadoriâ
My
friend Albiera was as beautiful as her name, beautiÂ­ful to me, beautiful to her
family, her friendsâall who knew her. In my sketches she appears as an angelic
one, an ideal woman. She was delicate. Always. Busy with her large family, her
housework, yet stealing time for her lute. There in her garden, among her
irises. There in her garden, by her fountain. Singing as she played. Dark hair,
dark tint under her eyes. Her voice a little frail. Perhaps she was too good
for us, although we loved her dearly.

After she died I used to visit her grave and bring or
arrange flowers. Her little bronze bust had a special place in my studio.

âAlbiera,â I hear Florentine voices calling.

Somewhere perhaps in the chÃ¢teau gardenâa bird sings and
seems to say: âAl - bi - era.â

Tomorrow evening, Pietro Papini will play his lira da
braccio for us, music I composed in Milan, when friend Atalante and I played
and sang. Papini is Court maestro and master of the lira. Heâll be playing his
amusing instrumentâmousÂ­tached
mascherone
on the sound box.

Good Francesco has searched through my manuscripts for
rebuses and notaÂ­tions, and he and Papini have put together a song that begins:

Amore sol la mi fa remirare, la sol mi fa sollecita
.

Tomorrow is my birthday.

Princess dâArezzo will wear a gold mask I designed for her.
Pity to hide beauty behind a mask. The King is wearing my skeleton cloak. Three
dwarfs will appear as miniature elephants. I will wear a replica of a camelâs
head. Francesco is to impersonate a Hindu seer. Countess Benciâsixteen years
oldâwill be naÂ­ked except for silver slippers and an Etruscan helmet of silver
foil.

It
will be gala!

Cloux

I did not know it was raining until one of the Kingâs pages
brought me a rain-spattered note, ink and coat-of-arms smudged.

âWhat is it?â Francesco asked, standing by me protectively,
holding the door.

The page grinned and wiped rain off his face. Probably he
was perplexed since he could not understand Italian.

âThe King is sick,â I said, reading the note. âHe wants me
to come to the chÃ¢teau and talk to him.â

âIn this awful rain!â

Water was sluicing off the pageâs cap.

âI wonât let you go out...in this cold rain,â protested
Maturina. âYou have no umbrella...itâs being fixed.â

Francesco tugged my sleeve.

âThe tunnel,â he said. âWeâll walk through the tunnel, to
the chÃ¢teau. Itâs been worked on...weâll keep dry... Shall we?â

So, with torches, the page, and a couple of my servants, we
entered the old shaft. Almost at once our torches died out; there was a brisk
draft; some of our torches were wet. Somebody went back to the manor house for
candles. The passage was difficult for a tall man. I had forgotten there were
several curves. Bats annoyed us. We had to wade across rain pools where water was
oozing in. I stumbled over bricks and stumbled over a rusty cuirass someone had
leaned against the wall.

Holding up my torch I made out crude foreign names and
initials and dates... VITELLI...was it really VITELLI? I thought I saw 1502 on
the wall. Latin names. Gascon. 1601. 1502 again. Cesare Borgia, that Papal
bastard had had Vitelli strangled on December 1, 1502. His name went on and on,
as we tramped through the tunnel.

My hatred was everywhere.

The page opened the chÃ¢teau door, and we ascended several
flights of stairs, walked along halls, were stopped by guards at the Kingâs
suite.

âHis Majesty is asleep now,â a guard said.

Borrowing umbrellas and raincoats, we returned to the manor,
preferring the paths and the road to the tunnel route.

How fitfully I slept while in Cesare Borgiaâs camp...like
Alexander the Great I slept with the
Iliad
and a dagger under my pillow.

It
was NiccolÃ² Machiavelli who stole horses for usâmade our escape possiÂ­ble...horses...rain...all
night the two of us rode through the rain.

Fibonacciâs dog-eared book,
Liber Abaci
, still
interests me: what tattered covÂ­ers, foxed pages, and scribbled margins! Too
many fingers have flipped through this book. No matter... I have tried his
famous rabbit problem once more and then once more. I see that each number is
the sum of the two preceding numÂ­bers, continuing
ad infinitum
. And it
is true I can divide Fibonacciâs number (after the fourteenth in his sequence)
by the next highest in number: it is precisely .618034 to 1.

.618034 is natureâs proportionâher golden mean: it exists in
sunflower seeds, shell spirals, spider webs, ferns, the perfect rectangle, in
playing cards, the Parthenonâs faÃ§ade.

Another night of memories, a night for murder. Incessant
wind, rain...

Vitelli
...

But
there was more than this young manâs death. There was Giamina Andres da
Ferrara. GAF.

The officials of Milan murdered GAF...the officials!: They
had him hung, drawn, and quartered, in the Public Square.

GAF.

I fled to Mantua, as if I could forget in Mantua!

So much of life is fleeing.

So much is trying to forget.

Rain...

Those youthful faces...Vitelli, 24 years old...Ferrara, 33
years old...artists... good men...friends.

Perhaps there is something to be said about this remote
chÃ¢teau, this little manor house, these woodlands, paths, fields, this Loire; I
should be able to put these things together and say something; when I am alone
here, or alone with Francesco and Maturina, when I sit in my studio or in the
library or walk in the fields or along the Loire, I hear something like wisdom:
it seems to suggest greater dedication, calm, calmness, like a stag in a
clearing, alert, watching.

August 15, 1518

Another summer at Cloux.

(I have not written my journal for months).

Birdsâorioles and finchesâare singing along the river.
Willows and birds for miles. Old trees, some of them half-drowned by a heavy
rain, seem deterÂ­mined to flourish. Where the Loire widens, meadows of water
form islands.

Yesterday or the day before, Francesco and I spent most of a
morning searching for a species of frog that interests me. We crossed and
recrossed the river at shallow points.

Close to the chÃ¢teau, by the tenth century bridge, I waded
over slippery rock. There I fell. Old shanks!

Iâll just lie here...the pain wonât last...

âMaestro, your sketchbook is ruined...let me help you!â

I was overcome by my own weakness, by the ugliness of my
bony legs. Itâs true Iâm an old man!

August 20, â18

Sometimes France becomes aliveânot in the geographic sense:
it comes alive as a fresco of bogged willows, a row of pencil-pointed cypress,
a field of yellow rye, a woodland village, a pagan altar, a tired bridge, a
flock of charcoal ravens ...these are the enchantment, along with August
cicadas and August storms.

Swans and cygnets are also there, and a knight in armor!

I stand at my studio window: there, below me, stretches the
garden and the garden leads to the woodland and just inside the first fringe of
trees is a stag.

From the chÃ¢teau I watch the blue water of the Loire flowing
by; the blue water changes to grey: the Seine.

I taste the antique taste of time and illusion: my telescope
focuses on wayfarÂ­ers: I see them in mirrors: years of princes, priests,
soldiers, artists.

Maturina is Italy: toothless, sickly, yet eager to carry-on!
Smiling, smelling of grease and herbs, she offers me her famous soup, her
haricot beans, her red jam, her Vinci cheese.

Behind her, as she sets my table for supper, gawks a young
Midi apprentice (a possum-faced individual). The Midian is talking about
Brussels sprouts, how her mother used to prepare them. When she takes
Maturinaâs place and her teeth fall out, she will be ready to impart her
culinary skills to someone else.

Cloux

September 14

Suddenly, Francis appeared in my studio.

He was dressed entirely in black, his suit sewn with pin
stripes of diamonds and pearls. We embraced warmly. We had not seen each other
for several weeks...

ââWhat has happened to you?â I asked, shocked by his
appearance, for his hair had been scorched and trimmed; his forehead was livid;
his cheek was scarred by burns; his chin had been gashed.

âIt happened at Romorantin,â he said, laughing loudly at me.
âDidnât you hear about the accident?â

âI heard something about an accident but I didnât know it
was serious. Iâve been in Paris, with Francesco. What happened to you at the
chÃ¢teau?â

âCome, donât take it so seriously, Mon PÃ¨re. Iâm all right.
The scars will disÂ­appear. My hair will grow back. I came to talk with you, to
get away from the roisterers at the chÃ¢teau... I need a little peace and
quiet.â

âBut what happened to you at Romorantin?â

âGames...we were playing games in the field alongside the
chÃ¢teau. It was dark. I shoved a wicker basket over my head and one of my
cronies set fire to it with his torch... I couldnât yank off the basket.â
Francis showed me his burned fingers. âThis is what I get for playing the fool.

âCome...letâs go into the studio, where you keep your
fossils from the Alps. I want you to explain again how you have estimated the
age of the earth from your shells and ferns. I canât seem to grasp that the
earth is as old as you say it is.

âLook at this rock, Maestro, with the snail imbedded in it.
Where did you find it? Did you find it in the ArgentiÃ¨re Pass?â

âNo, I found it when I climbed Monte Rosa, when I was making
notes on the quality of light among the glaciers and snowfields. You see that
snail came from the ocean...itâs an ocean snail...â

Today the new barber trimmed my hair and beard.

He is chief barber for the King, a Corsican, red-faced,
rotund, about forty; he seems in the prime of life. As he trimmed my beard he
ranted about autonomies, puny city against puny city.

âWar is a sewer,â he kept repeating. âMan is crap...he is
great. But he must stop fighting.â All very private, in his red-carpeted shop,
mirrored, hung with dirks. One of many small rooms along a chÃ¢teau corridor.

As I was about to leave, he said:

âI sing...you like music, I know... I sing for you... I am
an exile too, but I sing.â

His tenor voice was at its prime. He poured out song after
song, as others gathered in the corridor and room to hear him.

(Tomorrow, he will extract a molar for Francesco.)

As I write in my studio, rain splashes across leaded glass
and sputters on my autumn fire. I dictate. Francesco nods at his desk; it is
late, well after midnight.

Fame, in the figure of
a bird, should be depicted as covered with little tongues instead of feathers.

Pleasure and pain are
best shown as twins, back to back, since they are inseparable.

âNo, no,â Francesco objects. âI think we should write down
important things.â

I agree.

I pick up a paper and read about
heat...fire...vapors...water sucked from the ocean.

Yes, I must discriminate. I have over a hundred treatises to
work on...the days are passing quickly.

âLetâs stop for now... I know itâs late. Tomorrow I will
arrange fifteen figures, fifteen nudes, in sequence. On the basis of those
drawings I will make various comparisons, the horse with man, the legs of frogs
with the legs of men.â

Cloux

October 6, 1518

This is my second autumn at the chÃ¢teauâcold, cold! Windy.
Bundled up, I walk. Maple, oak, chestnut, pine...lightning-scarred oak,
crippled pine, friends... I walk alone or with Francesco or the King, paths for
every direction. Alone, or with Francesco, I am aware of the past.

Tonight, at supper, by our studio fire, talking with
Francesco, I talked about my maestro, Andrea.

âI was twenty, like you, Francesco. And I was always
hungryâlike you. AnÂ­drea was thirty-five then, maybe
thirty-six...twenty...thirty-six. I was lucky to have him for maestro.â

His skill with jewelry was something to remember. I remember
his setting a fire opal in a gold brooch... Iâd been his apprentice for several
months, maybe a year. Not a word was said while he worked, an entire afternoon.
A smile, a nod...

The opal was rectangular and its blob of fire was at its
baseâresembling a setting sunâthe gem surrounded by finely woven wires.

And there was a day when Andreaâs famous sphere was polished
and ready. How it glistened! How proud he was, how proud all of us artists
were! We crowded around; we left the workshop to sing a
te deum
and
drink wine as it was hoisted aloft, to embellish the dome of the cathedral.

âVerrochio...Andrea Verrochio,â we yelped.

And the copper sphere is still there, above the red tiles,
unharmed by lightÂ­ning.

He was a flawless craftsman with the porphyry and marble
walls of the Medici sarcophagus. And his beautiful
putto
, boy and
dolphin, are loved by everyone.

Fâs drawings of Andreaâs
David
, and his silverpoint
study of Andreaâs great bronze horse are treasures of mine.

Well, his
bottega
was a place of magic...subtleties
in metal and wood.

Again
itâs late. Francesco is playing cards at the chÃ¢teauâParisian girls. The cat
has disappeared. Lamps need fixing on my table. Will I every finish revising
these treatises, re-arranging them?

Di me se mai fu fatta alcuna cosa.

Andrea dead at fifty-three!

Di me se mai
...four words...scattered among my
mathematical papers, among my drawings:
Is anything ever done!

I was twenty...he was thirty-six...genial.

He believed art was the zenith. He asked: What do men
respect most? Laws? Writings? They respect the bronze horse, the jeweled
necklace...the alabaster vase...the cameo...the bas-relief...great
murals...antiquities!

Old thoughts now, but new then, important then.

Andrea often praised such accomplishments. How often we
talked in his small garden, trellised with wisteria and grape, his sister,
Margharita, looking after us. He had a scar across his right cheek, a special
smile because of it. What an aura there was at his homeâlike nowhere else.
Simple, family accord, everyone doing his part.

I remember something Andrea said:

âWhen I shivered as a child, I knew an angel had passed by.â

Cloux

Manor House

Early morning. Good light. Francesco and I worked at our easels
until lunch. Cold.

At lunch, F said:

âI lost again at cards last night... I canât speak French
well enough to win. Itâs lucky for me that everyoneâs leaving here this
weekend...off for Paris.â

We talked about Paris and the Kingâs departure (how desolate
he would leave the chÃ¢teau!): we talked about the Alps. I mentioned my climbs
and the fossils I found...the caves...with shells on the floor... I showed F my
memory-sketch of huge male bison painted on the granite walls of a cave,
painted there before any Florentine painted. I tried to find a primitive
carving on a piece of bone but couldnât locate it: I wanted him to realize how
clever those ancient artists were.

F was interested in the avalanches, and asked me the best
season for a climb. He will ask his father to accompany him on an Alpine
trip...heâs eager to return to his beautiful Vaprio. I certainly understand.
Last month the Melzis renewed their inÂ­vitation but I lack the strength to make
another move; perhaps, in a year or two, I might leave here without offending
the Kingâperhaps I can obtain a commission in Milan; then I could use the Villa
Vaprio for my base.

In the afternoon, because it was sunny and inviting, we had
our horses sadÂ­dled and rode through the
bois
...a fox plumed his tail in
front of us... I tried to sketch on horseback but my sorrel was very restless.
What fascinating shadows in the woodlandâwhen the sun is low! How to blend
them.

I am confused, cold.

I wrote in my journal a day or two ago, it seems; yet,
tonight, I canât recall the date; I seem to be in an unknown country, not
France, not Switzerland. This place is not my place. I am somewhere by a warm
fireplace fire. What confusion. The fire stares at me.

Through the open doorway I see my canvas of
St. John
...the
painting assures me. Ah, the King has gone. F has gone. It is as if I had been
asleep.

An assistant and I are making and repairing brushes; we are
also grinding pigments (how hard it is to find someone who cares to do quality
work); having discovered that my scale is inaccurate I am checking the
grinding. It is no wonÂ­der my
Saint John
colors blend poorly. A faulty
scale is a great hindrance.

I am troubled by the shading in Johnâs face: underneath his
eyesâso imporÂ­tant.

âPatience,â I say to myself.

I have heard that admonition through the years, hollow,
utterly sadistic.

The pleasure in painting is perfection!

I have heard that.

Pleasure and perfection are illusions, friend!

An artist frames his illusions and gilds the frames and
people gape at the illuÂ­sions and then foster more illusions.

Years ago, as a youngster, I liked to sit in front of the
marble faÃ§ade of Santa Maria Novella.

In the wintertime it could be a balmy spot.

Girls...but I would sit there and imagine that the twin
obelisks in front of the church were being lugged off on the backs of their
immense bronze turtles, four turtles for each obelisk. (What mad sculptor
designed turtles to hold up obeÂ­lisks!) Ai, the marble columns tottered across
the piazza; the monks and priests, with penises dangling, dashed out of church
and monastery, shrieking to heaven for help.

Maybe it was helpful to think such ridiculous thoughts;
maybe it erased problems; there were always problems...on Sunday no hawkers
were permitted in the piazza...pigeons took over, kids, wings, laughter.

Francis, so young, so arrogant, showers me with praise at
every opportunity. He introduces me to his friends: âMy Leonard!â He introduces
me as âMon PÃ¨re.â He calls me âMaestro...architect...engineer...heâs designing
the main stairÂ­case at Chambord...this is Count de Senlis, a connoisseur of
art.â The Count, an old man, is one of Francisâ âoldest friends.â Monsignor
Marais admires my paintings. Lingers. Cardinal Chambiges compliments my work
with sincerity, makes an offer on behalf of his church in Rheims. There are
artisans from Suresnes. There is an Italian group, enroute to Paris. However,
it is not so much the visitors, the guests, as the King himselfâhis fondness
for me.

Surely Cloux is everything I need.

Old paths, old benches, newly pollarded trees, beds of
flowers, autumn leaves, moonlight...at night I hear the owls talking.

Cloux

Studio

Winter evenings, cold evenings, before a roaring fire in my
walk-in fireplace, my lamps lit, I sometimes read aloud two or three of my
fables. Guests applaud. We enjoy
hors dâoeuvres
, sip claret. What lavish
trays arrive from the Kingâs kitchÂ­ens!

The King has a poet in residence who likes to recite female
poetryâfor the pomades and perfumes! He is a hunchback, with a sharp tongue and
tragic grey eyes in his young blond face. Courtiers tell me he has completed an
epic poem about my
Battle of the Anghieri
...

A
couple of weeks ago, Galeazzo, a local hunter, dragged a bear cub into my
studio. He was quite docile for a while and then became too frisky, and had to
be led away. Galeazzo promises to bring him again, and I will sketch him.

Francesco found this fable of mine in an old notebook, one
of those I used to keep in Italy:

A
stone lay on a mound where an attractive woodland shaded it. Herbs and flowers
of many colors grew around. As the stone looked about, at the stones in the
road winding below, it wanted to drop down onto the road.

The stone said to itself: âWhat am I doing, sitting here,
among these plants all day long? I want to be with the other stones, my sisters
and brothers.â

So, during a heavy rain, it managed to roll down and stop
among the rocks of the road. In a short while it began to feel the weight of
the cart wheels, the crack of horse and mule hooves, the tramp of cattle, the
kick of travelersâ shoes. A man knocked the stone to one side, another spilled
trash on it. A cart wheel chipped it. The dung of a cow splattered it. The
roadway became very hot.

The stone gazed back at the place
it had leftâits place of solitude.

This is what happens to those who think they can live
tranquilly in cities.

Francesco feels this is my best fable, although he does not
think much of any of them:

âRemember, Maestro, you are not Aesop.â

A nut, carried by a raven to the top of a tall campanile,
fell into a chink. As it lay there, it asked the wall, by the grace of God and
the fine bells in the tower, to help it survive since it had fallen into a
chink without any soil. The wall was sympathetic and was glad to help the nut
roll into a place where there was soil. After a time, the nut began to split
and send out roots. Soon the roots worked their way between the stones of the
tower. As it grew stronger it began to destroy the campanile.

The old tower bewailed its destruction, but it
was too late!

Tonight, Francesco and I have been working for hours: he
sits at his big desk with two water-lamps close to his bearded face, his
silhouette on the wall. He is only twenty-two, but appears to be older in the
lamplight.

He will be a great painter, when he is free of my influence.
He should set up an atelier of his own in Florence or Milan. He comes alive in
Milan. He endures this exile out of respect for me: for him I am both maestro
and father (in his own fatherâs eyes the world of art is unimportant). In his
patient, almost ecclesiÂ­astical voice, Francesco repeated the outline we have
prepared; here are items we have sorted out for further evaluation:

1 - The inequality in the concavity of a ship.

2 - Inequalities in the curves of the sides of ships.

3 - Investigations as to the best positions of the tiller.

4 - The meetings and unions of water coming from different
directions.

5 - A study of shoals formed under river sluices.

6 - The configuration of the shores of rivers and their
permanency.

These studies should be of value to mariners.

Francesco finds that much of the information I had recorded
is spotty.

Tomorrow we will begin with item 1.

October 28, â18

A lavish autumn!

Gold leaves float on the river, and, as I walk along,
admiring them, a handÂ­some riderless horse crosses, shakes his mane vigorously,
plunges wherever the water is deep, then stands on the shore for a few moments,
regarding me.

Again and again the fog becomes total master here: blanketed
by this Loire curtain, we are obliterated almost nightly: a visitor would have
a hard time locating the chÃ¢teau. King Francis, and his retinue and parasites,
have fled to Paris for the winter.

I have hours to contemplate his Italian plunder: in his
salons, his superb colÂ­lection of Mazzoni marblesâtwenty-one major pieces.

I study and admire the Kingâs Bataille tapestries. My
private gallery. My autumn sun, as well. Sometimes Francesco makes the gallery
a gallery for two. With autumn rain or wind. He sketches a Mazzoni bust; I
sketch a Mazzoni figÂ­ure. I am learning to appreciate the manâs skill: it helps
my exile.

Yesterday, as I left the chÃ¢teau, the handsome horse
re-appeared, trotting along a path that leads into the forest. Bobbing his head
as if in recognition, he walked toward the manor house with me. Heâs a grey,
with mixed mane. It was growing dark and his color blurred into the dusk.

I came to Amboise three, or was it four years ago?

The easel of time totters against invisible walls.

I grow thinner.

Maturina urges me to eat more.

âGive up your vegetarian food. Let me fix you a strong beef
soup...let me casserole a chicken!â

A letter from Salai.

He is completing his house on the vineyard property. As
usual, his letter is briefâpainfully brief. Where is the love we once shared? I
know that friendships are like old clothes, they wear out. But we were more
than friends.

If we live long enough we may achieve maturity: we will have
the past to guide us: we will confront the future more wisely: I write this,
wondering about myself: is this something, this saying, that applies to someone
else? I know that blind courage sustains me. I know that somehow we must
circumvent the Cesares and Savonarolas.

December 2nd

At Vinci, winter, spring, summer, we used to attend early
Mass: Mother had her favorite seat, near the altar, close to her Jesus: I
remember her somber clothes, her yellow hair in a spiral. Her face was the face
of a madonna, and the way she looked at me lit up my face; so, we walked, hand
in hand, or with her hand on my shoulder. Through the years I have seen us
walking there, at Vinci, a hundred times: were we always alone together? It
seems that way. Was the church beautiful? It seems so.

She disapproved of the sermons:

âLatin rote...I can teach you...listen to me.â

I listened.

âThere are three things for you to remember. One is
gentleness. The other: honesty. The third: beauty. Look...look at this sky, the
clouds, the birds, our cypress trees, our church.â

I looked.

December 4th

Alone, walking in the fog along the Loire, in the early
morning, I saw him. Magnifico. Crossing. Splashing. Approaching.

That
night he appeared in a dream: the Christ of my mural was walking along beside
him, His hand buried in Magnificoâs thick mane. Christ was saying something
about feeding him: plenty of grain in your stall, we must see to that.

A week or so ago, Judas visited me. In the dream he seemed
to be standing at the foot of my bed: he complained about the cold, the falling
snow: his face had become scarred; he appeared much older. Feeble.

Alone...I have learned there is something sacred about being
alone. I was...

Visiting here, the Parisian architect, Pierre Arconati,
admires my canvas of Saint John and my Mona. What a genial man, a student of
the masters, devoted to all of the arts, dapper, young, fluent in Italian, he
brought a portfolio of exquiÂ­site architectural renderings of Parisian
commissions.

I showed him my drawings for the Chambord and Romorantin
chÃ¢teaux. We went over them in detail and he was especially interested in my
spiral staircase. He, too, is a vegetarian. We had lunch together and swapped
dietary ideas. Of course he can find unique foods in Parisâthings we canât
obtain at Amboise.

As I showed him around the chÃ¢teau and manor house, he was
enthusiastic about living in the country...when the gardenersâ pet fawn ate out
of his hand, he turned to me:

âI find the city difficult... I hope Amboise is right for
you,â he said. âHow did you like Rome?â

It was my intention to compile an encyclopedia of machines of all kinds.

I

Â am very tired
after a long horseback ride. Francesco and I rode miles along the
riverâexploring. Where the ground became swampy we road through forest (the
Kingâs Forest), following vague roads and paths. Somewhere, in the thick of the
woods, we roused an elk. The animal crashed into a ravine, and disappeared. We
saw fox and squirrel, ravens, an owl. The bird was dumbwitted on a stump, too
sleepy, too careless to fly. At a clearing we alarmed poachers who raced off,
leaving their slaughtered buck, their bows and quivers beside it.

Tired of the thick shade and the
monotony of old trees, we headed for Amboise, but soon found out that we were
lost. It was a tedious ride before Francesco detected the sound of water; it
was good to dismount and drink at the Loire.

Back in our saddles, we trotted
along a sandy road, wide enough for a carÂ­riage. Cecchino began to sing and
whistle. There was sunlight. Evening clouds built up a sunset. Presently we saw
the hulk of Amboise in the distance.

So we began the new year!

â
Bonne AnnÃ©e
!â Francesco
yelled at the chÃ¢teau walls.

January 7, 1519

Beatrice
dâEste
âPainting Beatrice dâEste was troublesome because she seldom kept
her sittings. She was moody, flighty. Her sallow features defied changes in light
and shade. I wanted to impart a special quality to her portrait, a sense of
youth, interest beyond the face itself. I tried animals in her arms, birds,
flowers.

âYouâre too fussy, Leonard...all
this bother...letâs get the ugly thing finished! You donât remember that Iâm
busy. When Iâm late, you fuss at me. Scowl. ToÂ­morrow is the Spring Ball, yes,
yes, itâs tomorrow!â And she would babble on, in French, in Italian, stamp her
foot, gesture, swear. Child-wife, she was child-model.

She felt I should concentrate on her
favorite jewels, her rubies, her pearl snood, her diamond shoulder-pin!

âI insist,â she would storm.

It was Boltraffio who painted her
jewelryâwhen she was away from the stuÂ­dio.

âI hope the paint cracks on her
jewels,â he snorted, disliking her.

When she died, in â96, I tried to
visit the Duke, to present the finished porÂ­trait. He refused to see me.
Inconsolable, I was told.

Beatrice was twenty-two or
twenty-three when she died; she had been marÂ­ried to Ludovico for seven years.
Everyone said the Duke loved her profoundly. He also adored his mistress,
Lucrezia. He also adored Cecilia. Love, for Duke Ludovico, was living.

Inconsolable?
How long was he inconsolable?

Ginevra
de Benci
âI painted her in the autumn and painted autumn into her hair,
painted it into the juniper trees in the background, in the dress she wore, in
her eyes.

I was twenty-two!

She was a sickly person, cold;
yet I admired her: she posed with patience, understanding my tedious brush
strokes, praising my skill. A woman of scientific inclination, she had learned
much from my friend Amerigo, her geographer father.

When I studied geography with
Amerigo, at his home, she would appear from time to time, and I would try to
memorize the contours of her face, the coloring of her skin in different
lights, her bearing. I wanted to appreciate her personality.

Sometimes, in the studio, Ginevra
would preach her fatherâs ideas; I think she was trying to see how much I
respected his concepts as cartographer. She could be rude, blunt. She tried to
sail to the New World. She wanted to be the first woman to circumnavigate the
world. She thought I had no right to discourage her.

âYou are no sailor... I have sailed more
than you!â

In her boldness, she dictated
changes in her fatherâs maps. This was forty-five years ago, when some of us
believed
Virtutem Forma Decorat
.

January 10, 1519

Cecilia
Gallerani
âIt was totally different with Ceciliaâs portrait: the painting
and the sittings went well.

As Ludovicoâs fourth or fifth
mistress, she had learned artfulness: she was smiles, warm hands, long, slender
fingers, warm embraces, kisses. Always in agreement. Soft-voiced. Fond of
poetry. Music. Enjoyed eating, sipping wine, walking, flowers. When we were in
bed together, she knew how, when. Her breasts were small. Ivory. Her body was
compact, delightful. The shape of her skull was more to my liking than any
womanâs.

I like to think that all of my
models are still alive...

Here is Ceciliaâs ermine, eating
from his dish...heâs very much alive...here he comes, trotting across the
floor, jumping into her lap, cuddling, ready for another pose.

Tomorrow there is to be a
sumptuous banquet in the chÃ¢teau, again royalty. Three hundred guests, I hear:
Germans, Dutch, Austrian, Swiss, two or three British, a Greek potentate; the
majority will be Parisians and the chÃ¢teau people. I will have one of my
puppets, dressed as a hunter, in fur cap, etc., relate my fable about the great
elk of Scandinavia.

I have constructed a papier-mÃ¢chÃ©
lionâin yellow, black, and pink. He will walk a few steps down the center aisle
of the banquet room, growl at the guests, then open his mouth to reveal a
bouquet of white lilies.

Last week I was ill (my whole
body ached), and I could not attend the masque ball.

At the ball, boxers fought in an
arena, sawdust-floored; there were Swiss dancers and yodelers; sword swallowers
performed: they are the rage now.

Michelangelo sleeps on my lap.

February 11

Outside, as I write, a girl is
singing, in the chilly, windy afternoon:

ChÃ¢taignes
piquantes!

ChÃ¢taignes
chatouillantes!

Que
chatouillent la cuisse,

Mais
qui piquent la poche!

Now I hear another childâan Italian, a
boy of six or seven, way back in time, singing, as he runs an errand.

When I was a boy...itâs true...I
was happy: Mother made me happy: hand in hand we walked, at sunset time...she
liked to sing as she worked in her kitchen...we sometimes sang together, âbread
songs,â she called them.

I made drawings for her, little
gifts, on scraps of paper, a flowering geranium, a lizard, the figure of a clay
dog...

Vinci...its hills, its sun, the
trees, the caves, the rocks...they made me happy...grapes made me happy, the
clairette
,
pinkish and very sweet; the yellow-green muscats, so fat...grapes,
laughter...kindness...

I still taste those grapes on
Maturinaâs table.

In the afternoon heat, it was a
long drive to Plinyâs Villa, outside Rome. Enroute, I witnessed some of the
wretchedness of Romeâs slums; we were detained by waifs and by a number of
mentally retarded. My driverâs glib humor, levelled at the poor, gnawed at me
until we reached the villa among its cypress and olive. There I walked through
derelict rooms, some with views of the TyrÂ­rhenian Sea...summer rooms...winter
rooms...dining rooms...library. I saw swimÂ­ming pools, fountain, turrets,
Numidian columns, Luna marble. The sea boomed and Pliny, the upright Roman,
governor, senator, consul, killer of Christians, stood before me in his white
toga:

P - I respect your portico mural
but it must be finished by the New Year. Our banquet hall will be ready at that
time...we are preparing festivitiesâyou understand. Your unicorn motif is
overdone in color...several sea creatures are neglected, it seems to me.

LdV - Then you are dissatisfied?

P - I wouldnât say that, but
changes, changes might be made.

LdV - A matter of details,
perhaps?

P - Correct. A matter of details.
You are to consult with Valerius. He will...

LdV - And your payments? I must
remind you...theyâre in arrears.

P - You will speak to Antonius, my
secretary. This is a bad season...the harÂ­vests are poor... I have
obligations...charities. It was exceedingly hot in Rome today...good evening.

And those walls, mosaics,
turrets, frescoes, pillars, arches; what sort of luck had their artisans, fifteen
hundred years ago? The opulence of Pliny...the opulent sea...millions of
sesterces...banquets...Nero...Otho...Titus... Can Rome become an art center?

After exploring the villa, I ate
my bread and cheese by the shore, sitting on the sand. Sketchbook on my lap, I
sketched seabirds and a torn shoreline tree.

Kicking aside leaves from a
mosaic floor, I visioned a mosaic: in my mosaic of green, brown and white were
squared circles, spirals, nudes, sea horses.

A pretty girl passed by, selling
figs from a shoulder basket. I bought six, three for me, and three for the
driver.

Cloux

Was it ten years ago, at
Piombino, that green shadows sprawled across the walls of bayside houses, with
sun, hot sun, on the bay? Sun on the moat of the townâs doddering fortress, on
the plumed helmets of its entry guards.

I made sketches at the harborside
inn, made them on a long balcony table; I made harbor maps and drawings for a
windmill; I added sketches of a spool-winding machine; I remember I evolved my
machine for polishing crystals. My sketchbook filled...my ellipsograph, my new
perspectograph, a pair of improved compasses.

Yesterday, as I sorted these
sketches, memories came back.

And here at the chÃ¢teau, I must
see to it that the pale, long-legged, crooked-nosed Frog finishes my brass
compass. He has kept me waiting for more than a monthâthese dilatory French!
Can the artist live foreverâlike a Pope!

At Piombino, a fisherman helped
me locate fossils on the beach. A small lizÂ­ard, a multi-veined leaf. What was
the fishermanâs name? Giorgio? Paolo? Doesnât matter. We became friends.
Bearded rogue. Fat. In his rowboat, we sailed the harbor, weathering calms and
wild gusts, in and out of bays, eating cheese and bread, sipping port, catching
fish, his oars a pair of misshapen flipÂ­pers. With his tools, at his home,
above the bay, I designed oars, shaped them, edged them with thin copper. When
he tested them he found that he rowed with ease.

âFine...Maestro, fine!â

Blue rowboat, blue bay.

We rigged a sail, a drab hunk but
it worked. His name? Not Paolo, but Rimini. Obese fishmonger Rimini. Excellent
bread was baked by his young, mute wife. Bread, cheese, wine. Rimini often
sang, with his Piombino slurring, sang as we drifted, sang and rowed. We sailed
far away from the odious wars, from weaponry, forts, and death.

Riminiâs gulls, black-tipped
gulls, followed his boat, ate out of his handsâperched on my shoulders. Ah,
those wings! Those flights!

Occasionally, I slept at Riminiâs
thatch, where ducks always woke me. It was pleasant to wake to the quackings of
Riminiâs pets. His drake had been his pet for years, I wonât guess how many.
But I remember his glossy plumage and proud head, and how gluttonous he was.

When Riminiâs pretty wife (woman)
became bedridden I prescribed omitting meat. She agreed, through our sign
language. Within a week she was out of bed. Rimini had a
festa
, to honor
her recovery. Poor man, he thought me something of a wizard, an ogre, because I
could explain to him what the interior of the stomach was like.

February 13

Francesco and I have spent hours
at the ChÃ¢teau Romorantin, where remodÂ­eling of the old rambling building goes
badly. The weather is mean. Cough weather. Stormy. Romorantin is no place to
live in February. My drawing papers go limp there.

The King is seldom around; his
disreputable workers look as if they had come out of a tenth century nightmare.
Some have quit because of the weather; I am told that the head architect is
sick.

My supervision nets me nothing,
does not help the King.

Francesco groans as we make the
rounds of inspection.

Enroute to Cloux the carriage
breaks an axle as we near the chÃ¢teau and manor house. Rain. A few days later
we backtrack to Romorantin on horses. Carriages would not get through. The sun
comes out... Francesco and I work in the main salon.

As I work on my rendering of the
new staircase, an old pine tree crashes against a window, shattering it.
Workers snigger as I jump and drop my pad. The present stair may collapse at
any moment.

We eat lunch before a handsome
Gothic fireplace. A woodcutter tosses on chunks... I continue working...the
King appears...he is gone before I can speak to him.

Romorantin again: the Queen
occupies a wing that has been recently renoÂ­vatedâshe and her court. I have
learned that when the King is too preoccupied with his current mistress, the
Queen moves in. Up go her tapestries. Up go her pictures. In go her dogs, cats,
guards, maids, pagesâand favorite chef.

As Francesco and I strolled
through corridors, hunting for the illusive archiÂ­tect (now recovered), we find
doors open into the Queenâs suites; there is sun; the weather has improved; at
one of the open doorways, Francesco grabbed my arm, and exclaimed:

âMaestro...look...look in there!â

âWhere?â

âTo the right...through the
door...on that easel...thatâs your painting, your
Leda
and her swan!â

I canât believe what I see!

âYes...yes...â I mumble.

âItâs your painting, your missing
canvas. How did the Queen get it?â

âCome...weâll find out about
it...come away...donât go inside.â

âBut itâs yours.â

It was seven or eight years ago
that my
Leda
painting disÂ­appeared. We blamed this one and that one. We
offered a reward. The Duke promised to help...

Back at Cloux we have talked and
talked about
Leda
. What can I say to the King?

Why has he never mentioned the
picture? Had he purchased it from someÂ­one? Had his father purchased it? Was it
a gift? Or is it a copy? We could ascerÂ­tain that if we could inspect the
painting. There were too many questions for the moment. We needed to think. We
needed to concentrate on our work for a few days.

We will talk to people at
Romorantin...some of the Queenâs girls will talk...perhaps what Francesco saw
is an excellent copy.

The weather improves...but I am
depressed: I will not return to Romorantin.

In the sun (cold sun), Francesco
and I ride slowly along the Loire. I hope to see Magnifico.

Horses
...

Francis has some of the finest horses in
France. His stables are comparable to those of the Mediciâs.

Though I seldom ride now, except
to walk the horse or shake my depression, I still visit the stables: I can
spend hours there among their warm bodies: I note ears, nostrils, teeth, manes,
tails, rumps, shoulders, hides, colors.

Colts.

Mares.

Stallions.

Favorites!

Sickly animals become mine: I
feed them, pamper them, talk to them, comb and brush them...hostlers are
sometimes irritated... I do not care...in that stabled world I become one with
animal life.

I gather grain and fill a trough.

An old girl needs water: how
grateful she is! This beautiful pinto needs liniÂ­ment.

Horses
...

My drawings show their
illustrious qualities, their courage, their stamina.

Cloux

A young Parisian portrait artist
visited me; he was wearing a new grey velvet suit (in the Kingâs honor, he
pointed out). With arms crossed on his boyish chest he defended his dedication
to portraiture.

He examined my paintings with
friendly admiration but bristled when I said that it is not enough to paint one
thing well. I said that anyone studying a single aspect of art for a lifetime
can attain a measure of perfection! An accomplished artist must paint nudes,
seascapes, animals, birds, plants.

Spitting into my fireplace,
coughing, the fellow said:

âDo you call your
Mona Lisa
and
your
Saint John
landscapes?â

I could sense that he was annoyed by my
French.

So, his handsome, goateed,
disappointed face went out in the rainârain on his velvet suit.

And I began rethinking: why have
I painted few landscapes, seascapes (in the Dutch tradition); why have I
painted so many madonnas? I should paint deluge scenes, glaciers, Vinci.

Rain on his velvet suit.

How can I continue my journal
when it grows increasingly difficult to write? Left hand or right hand, I am
troubled. I am troubled in other ways: I walk into another room and canât
remember why I left my desk. Where is that sable brush Francesco brought me
from Paris? I am unable to recall names. And Fâsits there, perturbed, as I
attempt to remember. I also forget facts, and I am at a seriÂ­ous loss. What is
to be the outcome? As I review my treatises, I am aware that they are worthy;
it seems to me I have an adequate grasp of language; yet. WritÂ­ing is not my
mÃ©tier
:
I prefer a silverpoint or a chalk drawing or the infinite pleasÂ­ure of oil
colors. Sitting in the cold window sun, I sip Chablis...

Francesco, wearing his newly
tailored suit, continues his portrait of a young womanâprogressing nicely. He
hates to lay down his brushes. If I have a sugÂ­gestion it is a minor one; he
absorbs whatever I say with pleasure.

As I stand in his room, before
his easel, watching his brush, appreciating the light, I think:

âWe are moderns...we are
scientific artists. The face, a. b. c. d., responds to light on opaque pigment,
as we have determined. We realize that a shadow can distort; we must estimate
the value of each overlay...â

Then, sitting down, aware of the
pleasant viridian background in Francescoâs painting, my eyes blur: I feel like
I am falling asleep: then, the river horse, my Magnifico, appears inside the
pigment.

Yesterday, or the day before,
Francesco learned that my
Leda
is a copy, purÂ­chased by the Kingâs
father, five or six years ago.

I do not miss the dirt and stink of the
botteghe

or the sink holes of Florence, Milan, and Rome. Too often they smelled alike.
Botteghe

was spilled glue, dust, roaches, flies, antique casts (how quickly they got
broken), rusted pots, rags, gold leaf (always being stolen), sketches, frames,
saws, chalk, nails, rats. Someone was always leaving food around, wine bottles;
there were broken bottles, cracked pestles, chunks of clay, mineral samples, stools,
grease, brooms (that nobody wanted to use), mauled papers, waste
paper...brushes...brushes...brushes.

To paint, to write, to think.

Lifeâs chiaroscuro!

Under chestnut trees, in the
grove near the chÃ¢teau, I sat alone on a bench, aware of the eveningâs beauty;
as I sat there, the sun became a red ball behind a string of pines. I felt that
Caterina was beside me, she and Magnifico. I think I

stood and shoved my fingers into Magnificoâs tangled mane as Caterina whisÂ­pered
to both of us. It was almost dark but I could outline the oval of her faceâher
mouth and eyes smiling. Around us, in the grove, the wind was dropping leaves.
The night promised to be cold...

Cold.

I looked at the Milky Way, as
Caterina and I had in Italy, from our bench in our small garden, while the city
slept. She said something to me about our daughter.

âWho will...â

For some reason, a reason I can
not understand very well (a fumbling reaÂ­son), I have gone through some of my
luggage. I have come across some drawn work Mother made: flowers and angels, in
perfection:
punto en aria
. How white the threadsâafter all these years!
I see no lace like hers. She was first or second at every annual
festa
.

And my father left me a legacy
also: his is a literary legacy of four curt letters, notary letters: our home
life, under his coercion, slowly disintegrated. Coercion and promiscuity. Fatal
combinations. But why glance at ruins? I glance at them because they are a part
of me.

Francesco has repaired my
portable bathtub. Soon I will be able to luxuriate again.

I hope there are sunny days
ahead... I am reading Aesop... Confused, I feel I am repeating myself in my
journal; I must check through my pages. Weariness says I must stop writing and
yet as I write I think of the sun in the garden below and the peacocks below
and I think of the sun that has burned for me for many years and I think of the
shadows I have observed, the shadows of weeping wilÂ­lows, the shadow of a
lifted marble arm and hand, the shadows of birds... I think of spring foliage
coming...the first spring flowers and there is a wonderful haze in these
thoughts tied in with the sun...the haze makes me feel I am young; I am

able to climb hills, ride Magnifico; tomorrow I start a painting of Hercules
firing his arrows at the Stymphalian birds. As I put away my journal some of
that light blurs in perspective, and I think how light bends at night when
lamps are lit.

I seem...

Cloux

The date, does it matter?

My right arm has become
paralyzed. Gradually. It has happened gradually. Now I can not manipulate my
fingers. For a while I could manipulate one or two. I hoped they would recover.
I think this affliction began on the strenuous ride from Milan to Amboise. I
think it began in the monastery where I was stricken for a while.

The Kingâs physicians have tried
to help...they are trying to bring back musÂ­cular control. They have prescribed
herbs, poultices, hot concoctions. Strange, very strange, to have a hand that
hangs by my side, a hand that does nothing, that is already dead.

The greater one is, the greater
oneâs capacity for suffering. It should be that the greater one is, the greater
is oneâs capacity for courage and understanding. Why do we suffer?

Nec spe nec metu

March 5

Fifty years ago...fifty!

Whether it was
chiaroscuro
,

sfumoto
, encaustic, or other technique, I was sincere. Few days were
long enough.

Florence, fifty years ago...it
was my town. I fitted in. The place is no longer the same. The guilds are
different. The workshops are different. Most of my friends are dead or gone.
There is another kind of politics.

A half century ago life was
adventure: life was new: friends were new, work was new: there was love. When I
was accused of homosexuality some of that libel pervaded my thinking for years.
A personal plague. How easy it was to brand a man in those days: the âtelltaleâ
box hung on the church door. You wrote your accusation and dropped it in the
slot and scurried off.

So much of life is focused on
sex, is wasted on sex. I have been a masturbaÂ­tion man. For long my body has
nothing to share with any woman or man. I am immersed in thought. In my bed I
have loneliness as mate. I patronize no one.

One of the chÃ¢teau gardeners, a
Venetian, who has been very friendly with me, has presented me with a caged
oriole. In a woven reed cage, painted black.

Black!

I carried the cage outdoors, into
the morning mist; I set it down. The bird fluttered, trembled. How long had it
been captive? I knelt. I could see where he had chipped off black paint with his
beak.

Black!

I opened the door.

A male, he battered the reeds
with all his strength, found the opening, and hurtled into the sky.

I have forgotten more than I can
recall: perhaps this is true of most of us who have lived a long life. Many of
the things I have forgotten I have wished to forget. I find it hard to live and
harbor grudges, but it is also lack of wisdom to erase the mind; then it may be
necessary to experience our mistakes again: thatâs being trapped twice; a fox
avoids that.

As for survival, I have survived
because I found something to discover: disÂ­covery is the key: new sinew, new
mineral, new color, new face, new canal, new lamp.

In Andreaâs studio I discovered
perspective. There is so much about perÂ­spective that eludes oneâa continual challenge.

Perspective may be the most
important of all the art disÂ­ciplines. In this branch of science, the beam of
light is best explained by mathematics and physÂ­ics. Since the axioms are long
I will abridge them now:

There are three branches of
perspective: 1 - The first deals with the reasons for the diminution of objects
as they recede, and is known as diminishing perÂ­spective. 2 - The second deals
with the way colors vary as they recede. 3 - The third is concerned with the
way objects in a picture must be finished in relation to their proximity. I
amplify these three in my treatise on perspective.

I have admired hands, respected
them for their capabilities. As I dissected, I marveled at their intricacy and
perfection... I admire all classes: the feminine, the masculine, childrenâs
hands. I made drawings of my own hands, in the days I could squeeze the
crabprongs of a horseshoe with ease. I remember Motherâs loving hands,
Caterinaâs sensual hands, Andreaâs clever, slender fingers. There have been
clay and bronze and marble hands. The hands of beautiful women have appeared in
my dreams. I can perceive, as I write, the hands of Christ and those of His
disciples.

Perhaps there will be a few,
reading this journal, who may care to know some of my thoughts about painting:

a - All colors, when placed in
the shade, seem of equal degree of darkness. b - All colors, when placed in
full light, seldom vary from their essential hue. c - The eyes, out-of-doors,
in a illuminated atmosphere, perceive darkness behind the windows of houses
which nevertheless are light. d - The eyes perceive and recÂ­ognize objects with
greater intensity in proportion as the pupil is dilated.

Sleep is a curious
thingâresembling death.

Sometimes it is totally blank, as
death must be; sometimes we see destruction. Flames rise. Buildings collapse.
Sometimes we hear animals talk. Without movÂ­ing, they run away from us.
Sometimes we fall from great heightsâwithout harm. Sometimes we talk to those
who are unseen. Sometimes we meet those who canât speak. If we do not sense
death in our sleep we may sense confusion. Confusion in black and white. Or
grey. We dream of bucolic scenes in grey, a grey stream, a grey tree, grey
boulders. We stroll through grey air, grey birds in the sky.

Now, in color, a great hawk
threatens us. Angels appear. There is a cave with a ragged mouth. It wants to
swallow us. Now cadavers threaten. Enemies besiege us.

Now, a friend appearsâa childhood
friend, unchanged by time.

Christ descends from the
refectory wallâleaving a terrible hole.

Cloux

March 4, 1519

I am writing very slowly now.

While painting
The

Last
Supper
I lived at the Santa Maria delle Grazie some of the time, working
day after day, often sleeping on the floor, on a bench. I painted by day and at
night, with the help of lamps and candles, placing lights on benches, on
tables, on my scaffolding. I was altering forms, changing colors, imparting
greater age to a face, lessening the impact of a gesture.

I might stay an hour, or remain
for days: Ai, Matthewâs eyes might move; Luke might raise his arm; John might
turn his headâor so it seemed. I was always there when the light was good;
during inclement weather I might shove my key into the lock, and shut the door.
A few grapes, some nuts, bread and wine... I didnât need much food. With a
basket or a bowl beside me on the scafÂ­folding I would go on painting.

I was forty-three.

When Christâs model became ill
and finally died, I retouched His face, imparting what I had learned while
observing the dying man. I remember: to soften the shading I retouched with a
lamp in my hand, holding it close to His face.

As I painted there were two dead
men watching me.

I discovered Judas when he was
drunk. I found him in a
borghetto
, slumped at a table, a big table
sticky with spilled food and wine. Flies. Sipping wine at another table, I
sketched him. So it was: I would not have to hunt any longer. That night,
although he was drunk and unsteady, I got him to my studio and put a robe over
his rags. We talked, we ate. His name: Carlo Macchini.

Carlo came and went. He never
accepted a
soldi
.

Came and went, usually a little drunk.
Kindly.

He was an assistant baker. Hated
his boss, hated his job. Hated.

When I had completed his face in
the fresco, he contemplated it for a while, shrugged, patted me on the
shoulder, walked away...not a word... I never saw him again.

Before I finished the fresco,
Luke had died. The last I heard about Peter was the news that he had added
another child to his big family. Ninth. As for Mark...he was living with a prostitute.
Sick. No job.

I made many sketches of each man: filled
sketchbooks. I worked them into my cartoon...slowly, slowly. I wanted the faces
to express the gravity of life; the clothes that they wore must not distract;
the food on the table must not distract. I made the tableware similar to that
used by the monks as they ate in the room. It took me almost a month to arrange
the food and dishes. Twenty-six hands must tell their story but not
overdramatize.

I strove for simplicity: that
resolution haunted me. So many times, when rain drummed on the roof of the
refectory, as I sat alone, I heard that word: simplicÂ­ity, simplicity of color,
design, shadowed by the past.

And while I painted, the
beautiful refectory was flooded by a storm: I saw water two feet deep: pigments
were washed away, brushes were lost.

Ai, I see it now: at least one of
the disciples should have had a scarred face, should have been crippled
perhaps. Life, in those Galilean days, did not let one escape unscathed. Out of
the twelve, one would have suffered.

But there, there they are, with
their Lord.

I had a brief letter from Salai
today. If he had remained, we would have made our bicycle.

Tomorrow, I...

On my birthday, my friends,
Father Luco Pacioli, Phillip, Donato Bramante, Abbaco Alberti, Peter,
Francesco, John, Toscanelli, Andrea, Luini, Credi, friars, priests and many
artists, gathered at the Grazie, and we burned lamps and canÂ­dles for the first
showing of
The Last Supper
. Standing on a bench, Father Luco said:

âMilan is indebted to our
Leo...to him and Il Moro and the prior and his people. We have watched the
fresco come to life. For three years weâve seen it move along. It has meant
something special to each one of us. It is Leonardo da Vinciâs miracle. A
symbol of manâs desire for a better life.â

How well I remember those words!

In Milan, my
Salvator Mundi
attracted
crowds when it was exhibited in my studio. King Louis had expressed his public
approval of the painting and the curious had to be satisfied. Since General de
Galen had come to Milan to deliver the painting to the King, I asked his
protection. Onlookers came out of the alleys as well as the palace. Alley folk
jeered. They shouted âChrist the Juggler;â they called Him âEl Putoâ...âthe
glassy-eyed Gascon.â

Riffraff threw mud and garbage.

I had to cover the painting...but
that was yesterday...the jeers and criticism should remain in the past.

Here, at Amboise, at Cloux, all
is respect, a respect that originates with King Francis. Courtiers and guests
and workers often approach me in the gardens; we pass the time of day. I get
along best with the gardeners because there are new plants and flowers to
examine and sketch. Sit me on a bench and I am lost by a bed of flowers. An old
maestro, toothless, stooped, a man from Padua, knows how to please me with a
leaf, a flower, a seed.

âThese roses I grew in my own
garden...what colors!â

Thinking of
Jesus, here in repose, I realize the Savior lacks an aura of gentle mysticism,
the aura of my Jesus at the supper table. The globe He holds in His hand lacks
the obvious meaning of brotherhoodâthe great concern of the disÂ­ciples. My
Saviorâs eyes are not the eyes of a shepherd from the hills. He has a city
manâs face. He is younger than the Christ at the table. His benediction is for
all men and yet carries a sense of restraint, perhaps a sense of doubt. Perhaps
it is my own doubt, a doubt that I feel keenly at Amboise, a doubt that seems
based on my inability to bring together the meaning inherent in my studies, my
optics, my hydraulics, my engineering work.

Dreams...dreams...

It is evening, and the kite
comes. He grips me in his talons and helps me fly, over the Arno, over the
town; he becomes my black-brown-grey kite with wings 18 feet long, wings of
wood, cloth, wire. I hear the wind.

Francesco has been amused when I
describe my experience with the kite; however, it is too old a dream, or
experience, for me to dismiss. How many times it has encouraged me.

As I write, I hear someone
calling my name.

April 2, 1519

Again, my health is failing rapidly. I
can not continue my work with my treaÂ­tises. I can not write my journal.
Sometimes I can not speak. My vision is going. Francesco and I had begun to
bring ends together; I had hoped for days ahead because there is so much to
accomplish.

At night, in my room, the walls
become a mural of Amboise, the manor house, the Loire, old bridges, royalty,
paintings, rearing horses, Francesco, wings, rocks, caves, Galilean
faces...like maddened bees.

April 3

Yes, most of my years were years without
sexual intimacy. I experienced ecstasy but it was often bitter later on. So, I
comforted myself with sham comÂ­fort. I gained time through my solitary living
and lost time that could have made me more human.

Yes, I had a woman for three
years.

My own illegitimacy was often
slammed at me...bastard da Vinci...that stigma harms the mind.

Dedicate?

Of course, dedication...but I
have explained...art, music, sculpture, geology, mechanics...not one is
bastard.

DEDICATE:

A priest outlaws distractions.
What is an artist but a priest! Joyous children, sick children, they are part
of most married lives...that little girl on your lap, sucking her thumb,
kissing you, stroking your beard...she...she is dead.

Here, at the chÃ¢teau, there are
hall mirrors, mirrors in ornate frames: the artÂ­ist observes himself in those
mirrors: he also sees a rusty spatula and shredded brushes: sometimes, late
afternoons, I see in those mirrors, someone in Milan, I see her smiling, I see
the spiral of her yellow hair.

I hear her laughter.

I hear...but that is our
staircase creaking. Or is it Francesco working in his studio?

Food has become tasteless.

What is wrong with my chÃ¢teau
wine?

Maturina scolds.

I think of those hungry days as
apprentice, when eating was such a pleasure! I think of our kitchen, at Vinci.
Motherâs. Fresh bread. Milk from that blue pitcher.

Paix, paix, Satan, allez,
paix!

Machiavelli is here. Unexpected.

He is enroute to Paris to collect
a bad debt. A man owes him 600 livres. I have offered money. NiccolÃ² is proud,
too proud.

He has malaria and shuffles about
in a great coat though it is warm. Last night by a studio fire he huddled in
his coat. Perhaps Dr. Pedretti can help him. Weâll see tomorrow. As we sat by
the fire, sipping wine, he railed about politics at homeâ-wretched deceptions.
Scoundrels!

Most of his three days have been
spent in bed. In his elegant clothes he bowed before the King. The two got
along well. Lying and vying. Francis has offered one of his carriages for the
trip to Paris.

NiccolÃ² has lost weight. He was
always skinny but now he is a shadow of himself. He resents my paralyzed
arm...says it is God who is to blame. Then laughedâor was it a sneer?

He thinks Amboise is a true
haven.

He is wonderfully clever with his
tongue, Latin, French or Italian.

Sometimes loneliness has
embittered me.

Last night I asked Francesco to
come to my bedroom, though it was late. He came and sat by my bed. He
understands my sickness; and he also knows he is going back to his Vaprio.

It was a cold night. A fire burned
in my fireplace.

Francesco wore his grey wool
gown, stared at me sleepily, flames on his thin cheek bones, on his hands,
bringing out their veins.

Cloux was forgotten as I talked
of home and my mother and my first days in Florence, at the Verrochio, first
days so different from Francescoâs first days when Florence had more patina. I
rambled on about Milan and my paintings and the siege and Milanâs bombardment
and deathsâpell-mell thoughts. Francesco brought cups of wine. For us this was
a father/son relationship. We two had been father and son since we left Italy,
since Francesco cared for me during the big snow at the monastery. It pleases
him that King Francis often addresses me as âMon PÃ¨re.â

Ivory-faced madonnas...regal
pomp...commissions that failed, comÂ­missions that succeeded...my flying
wing...I was reliving my life! Francesco asked about the men who had posed for
The
Last Supper
. Faces, thoughts, words...flooded. We talked about Peter and
James and Matthew; we found drawings of Jesus and He seemed real in the
firelight.

Francesco added two or three logs
to the fire.

He brought in a wine bottle and
refilled our glasses.

Wind gusted smoke into the room.

We talked about Paris and our
trip there. I told him that Rome was far more interesting than Paris. I related
the story of the mirror-man, at the Vatican apartment: that story involved me
in anguish. I stopped talking, to listen to the wind.

We talked of fishing in the
Loire...when?

âTomorrow,â I suggested.

âItâs tomorrow now,â he said,
laughing.

âHow time gets away from us.â

âMaturina will be rattling the
breakfast dishes soon.â

âThen you had better get some
sleep.â

âGood night, Mon PÃ¨re,â Francesco
said, and laughed that good laugh of his.

So, you wonât paint again! Where
you are going you wonât hear the pestle grinding pigment. How insignificant my sketches,
my trees, faces, water...as a boy I thought every sketch would open up the
world a little more.

It was only a month ago I made
the four small bronze horses, moulded the graceful contours of Andreaâs
face...it was only a year ago that...

Â I hate the bodyâs frailty, that
dead arm! Work was life, but no, there were hours to prowl the hills, to climb
the Alps, to sit by the sea. Maturity came durÂ­ing those hours as well as
during the hours of work. I remember, while painting
The

Supper
...

I remember a little plant in the
evening light, that frail light that shadowed the corolla. I remember a sorrel
leaf, I remember a small fern. Small? What is small versus big? I should know.

A madonna in the evening
lightâher smile.

And the world shrugs.

Pigments reveal how I have
erred...tell me green, tell me saffron, tell me royÂ­alty, tell me death.

And you, red chalk, speak!

We think we are learning how to
live but we are only learning how to die.

I, Francesco Melzi, write:

Maestro Leonardo da Vinci is dead
.

He died at Cloux, in the manor house,

on May 2, 1619.

He was sixty-seven years old.

April 4, 1519

DURING THE LAST
WEEKS OF

LEONARDO DA
VINCIâS LIFE,

I, FRANCESCO
MELZI,

RECORDED THE
MAESTROâS THOUGHTS,

AS HE DICTATED
THEM:

âY

ou ask me what my
apartment was like in Milan? It was an apartment of tapestries and antique
furniture, paintings, mine and others. Sculptured pieces. I bought many things
at the Thievesâ Market. My Camjac tapestries covered three walls. Made the room
warmer. My paintings covered the fourth. This was my
sala
. A large
stained glass window faced the street. You remember that street, of course.
Lodi Street. Western exposure. Hot in summer. Dusty. But my apartment was on
the fourth floor, had a wide, shaded balcony. There was a small courtyard of
plants and a pair of little tiled fountains with squirting fish. Sometimes the
courtyard was a refuge. Cypress. Old ones.

âWith my big iron key, I stepped
into my rooms. Five. My studio had good light. Of course I painted the walls
black. You would have admired my Roman pieces, heads, busts. You, my friend,
were living in Vaprio then.â

We moved his bed into the sun,
and pulled open the drapes. He enjoyed lying there. âSpring is beautiful,â he
said.

Cloux

April 5, 1519

Da Vinci talks to me with
difficulty. However, I go on:

âPerhaps those years in Milan were the busiest years of my
life. Irrigation projects,
The Last Supper
mural, easel paintings, the
horse...yes, the horse... cartoons. I tried to interest the authorities in an
ideal city. I made models for them. Planned double-decked streets. Vehicles
would use the lower level, pedestrians the upper. There would be proper sewage.
I wanted to show men that the plague might be avoided through sanitation.â

He has eaten a little fruit, and sipped some wine.

âIn Milan, I went on with my anatomical studies, this time
working in a clean hospital, with proper light. I had adequate leisure. I
dissected male and female ...eight or ten cadavers...over the years. Made my
drawings in various media.

âIllness laid me low...

âI never trusted physicians. They know nothing of anatomy
and less about illnesses. I suffered aloneâwith my servants. They fed me,
administered my concoctions...my kidneys. Nature cured me. After about six or
seven months I was able to get about, to walk, stride along. There was kindness
then...but kindÂ­ness is your specialty...your kindness has never failed me.â

âRemember thisâI was forced to work for Cesare Borgia.
Remember, Vitelli and I tried to refuse him. Refusal was impossible. We were
like hostages in BorÂ­giaâs camps. Of course we wanted to escape...planned...we
were afraid. Pay was high. So...we continued ours jobs as cartographers. Close
friends, fellow artists, we looked to each other for support.

âAs I sketched Borgia I realized his animosity. Vitelli and
I were aware that his soldiers disliked us. They made it pretty obvious most of
the time. I talked to NiccolÃ² Machiavelli about this antagonism. He scoffed.
Laughed at me.

âYet Borgia, always demanding, arrogant, worried us. He went
out of his way to annoy Vitelli. I tried to play down his swaggering. I tried
to play down our apprehensions. Then...then, he had Vitelli strangled.
Strangled in Borgiaâs tent. Enraged, afraid, I left that night. NiccolÃ²
provided my horse. He rode with me. We escaped through the rain. Our horses
fast. Solitary roads...hoof beats... I remember. Vitelli murdered. In the tent.

âWe said little as we rode.

âAt an inn we dismounted, drank, warmed ourselves. NiccolÃ²
could not jusÂ­tify his Prince.

âAi, that murderous rain! His name, his face, that Borgia
face, assassination rain!â

It is late as I finish writing down his words. He is in
pain. Last night he slept very little.

April 7, 1519

âNo, not purgatory and not hell...

âI esteem the horse and the dog because they are free of
perversions...no
misa
, no confessional...

âAnimals exact little...make no covenants.

âI canât forget the Papal wars, the crusades, the Savonarola
fanaticisms.

âWhen did robe and aspergillum exorcise evil?

âIâm still searching...but, in this world of ambiguity, I
think there is no answer.â

Today...only these words, as I sat by his bed. Visitors
annoyed him. Several times he asked for his mother.

It is afternoon. The sun is low. Da Vinci speaks:

âWhen the old French King saw my
Last Supper
he was
determined to remove the entire wall of the refectory, and have it transported
to Paris. He discussed it with engineers and architects who said it was
impossible.

âWhat a study...the King is scarlet, pompous, in a very bad
humor, his syphiÂ­litic face grey. Flailing his arms, as he stood before my
mural, he roared at the men around him, kicked a dog that had wandered in.

â
âYour fresco
canât remain in this wretched refectory!â Everyone was amused.

âLater, when I painted his portrait, he was affable. I
painted him in profile, a good study, in good light. He insisted on having a
book on his lap. Ovid. I remember he said:

â Â
âIn Amboise, I
have a collection of fine books...Ovids.â

âHe
was willing to pay any price for my
Madonna
of the Yarn Winder
. So,
he paid...and carried it off to Paris.â

Stroking his beard, da Vinci watched rain streak his
windows. Lifting one arm, he said: âNo more today, Francesco, no more talk.â

âCome, letâs get on with it...I have something to say:

âMy deluge drawings express weight, gravity, power, fury,
terror. The overÂ­turned, whirling chunks of masonry, the enormous waves, defy.
This is the end of man. I believe such a cataclysm is going to overcome the
earth.

âThe drawings were inspired by my visits to the sea, by my
trips to the mountains where I saw avalanches. Sound...the crash of falling
boulders, the crash of a raging ocean...they warn. Finalityâin one form or
anotherâsurÂ­rounds. We canât escape.

âRage, rage...much of life is rage...desperate rage.

âHere, far inland, I can hear the tumultuous sea!â

Sometimes I can barely make out his words. I served his
supper. He ate very little. He remarked about the pigeons cooing on the roof.

Cloux

April 12, 1519

Royalty have visited us. Alone with me, da Vinci said:

âYesterday, I dreamed that the sun was coming through my
window at Vinci...there were bunches of grapes on our table...bare table, in
the sun. Caterina was sitting opposite me, her hands in the sun. I seemed to be
about thirty years old. She seemed to be about the same age. Our dog lay on the
floor, waiting for me to take him out.

âI felt imprisoned by the sunlight, happily imprisoned... I
was imprisoned by the beauty in Caterinaâs face. My eyes followed the grain of
the table, mixed with the bunches of grapes, went out into the street, returned
to her face, her smile.

â...You have asked me about
happiness. Does anyone know what happiness is? It is so often illusory. For
you, Francesco, itâs a woman...or a swim in the lake. For me it was always
work. If a great discipline haunts a man throughout his life...well, heâs
lucky. You have seen me happy. You didnât throw in your lot with a bitter man.

âWe see King Francis...we watch him...he is eaten up with
regrets...he is scheming, plotting...worrying...battlefields gnaw his guts...if
we want sanity there are Vaprios, little rivers, little hills.â

He asked me for another cover.

Cloux

This was our last conversationâon April 23rd.

Melzi - I heard that you created a mirror machine while you
were in Rome.

Da Vinci - I tried to amplify the starsâstudy them.

Melzi - Please explain.

Da Vinci - A series of mirrors and lens.

Melzi - To catch the light?

Da
Vinci - I could position the mirrors and the lens. You have to visualize them,
in a shallow cradle, some pieces one and two inches square, some pieces two and
three inches square, most of them concave, all specially ground, to fit together
like an eye, to focus like the eye. They could be raised or lowered, tilted,
under a lens which I could also focus.

Melzi - They brought the sky closer?

Da Vinci - All of the mirrors and lens were destroyed by the
man who had cut and polished them. He smashed them. Malice...fear...envy...

Melzi - A bitter experience, Maestro!

Da Vinci - Thatâs how it was...in Rome. The Pope learned of
these experiÂ­ments and ousted me from the Vatican.

He fell asleep.

A

s requested in Maestro Leonardo da
Vinciâs will, sixty men, each carrying a lighted taper, accompanied his coffin
to St. Hubertâs chapel, on the evening of May the 4th. Royalty, chÃ¢teau-pages,
soldiers, visitors, servants made up the procession from the manor house to the
Amboise chapel. It was a cloudy, threatening evening. The chapel bell tolled.

A bearded priest, in black vestments, performed the requiem.
Royalty crammed the chapel. The royal green flag, sewn with hundreds of white
salaÂ­manders, blanketed the casket. Wreathes of roses and carnations leaned
against wall cabinets where there were lighted candles. Men chanted a Gregorian
chant.

The Maestro was buried close to the chapel, under chestnut
and cypress, buried by torch and taper light. The chapel doors were wide open as
someone played the organ. Six men lowered the coffin.

Leonardoâs death was the saddest moment of my life.

When King Francis returned to Amboise, later in May, I
walked with him to the burial place and he laid flowers on âMon PÃ¨reâsâ grave.
Fog filtered the grove and dripped on us. A hard day for the monarch.

King Francis has retained all of da Vinciâs paintings.

I was willed his drawings, sketches, journal, treatises,
music, and corresponÂ­dence.

Soldiers accompanied me on my return to Vaprio.

My father and mother welcomed me home.

Father gave me a northlight room, on the third floor. I will
place my easel near the windows that face the Adda, face the little bridge
where the Maestro used to fish for temolo.

I have hung my copy of his
Mona Lisa
on the entry
wall and have laid his red velvet cloak over the back of a chair.

I am arranging some of his drawings on a center table.

There is ample space for his
Anghiari
cartoon on the
inside wall. I have ordered broad shelves for his books and his small bronzes,
his drawings and treatises, his brushes and pigments. I will purchase a leather
box for his correÂ­spondence.

I
will do what I can to bring order to his writings.

remains collected during

T

o invent can become an aberration, a
mystery, at times a queruÂ­lous searching to remedy an irremediable loss. Shall
we say there is a larger purpose? Must there always be a purpose and justificaÂ­tion?
I can not believe that. Then, there can be stumbling, burial, burial violets
around a grave, an absence. These thoughts must be weighed, re-assessed,
subtracted from physical ailment and sickness of mind. Surely the stage was not
intended for a single player.

Stratford

February 2nd, Candlemas â 1615

On Christmas last I sang carols with Ellen and her friends,
in her London apartment, candlelight on her frosted windows where trees, like
menhirs, lisÂ­tened. Some of her friends were drunk and raucous parasites; some
were manikins; some were overly friendly; some, Countess Bardolph, Lord Fenton,
Lady Page, were perfumed bores; the Irishmen were troublemakers...

The Captain of the Guard requested a dance, and musicians
appeared on a small wreathed stage, a candlelit tree at one side. Sprigs of
ribboned mistleÂ­toe decorated the window drapes and the frames of all Ellenâs
paintings; she wore a sprig and her Scot mouth met mine under the portrait of a
highlander. Caroling and wine went on and on:

Joseph and Mary walked

Through an orchard green,

Where were cherries and berries

As thick as might be seen...

Mummers paid Ellen a call, accompanied by a dancing jester
wearing furs. By now it was snowing and the storm sprinkled the jester and the
costumes of the torchlit merrymakers with him, as they trailed about, singing. A
glass of wine with Ellen... Egypt, it seemed an easy dive to the bottom of the
deep, to pluck drowned honor, but there was Ann, pinch-faced, wanting to scourge,
and sting with pismires.

Joseph and Mary walked through their orchard bewitched, and
Ellenâs thick tree burned with its candles; the Yule log burned and cat-spat;
thick-eyed musing came with scalding wassail; then more dancing and then sleep
at their side... Later, Iâll tell her about my play, my plans, secrets of the
stage, boyhood delights... Iâll reveal the wildness of the world, and beyond
this, the tranquility of poetry itself.

Sheâll share her Edinburgh, her theatre, her books, her home
by the lake, her work for the priory library.

She told me:

âLife is to hold warmly in our hands. It is to be made
better for our passing.â

Her intense face considered mine: the fine lines of her
mouth, those eyes, lochs, and then there were her dark, dark hair, her perfume,
the pressing of her fingers into my sex...necessities and no better...

Carols continued while snow stuck to her window panes and the
pine boughs put resin on the air...a day and then another, her hair on her
pillow like a fern...and nothing else was needed.

On the blue frozen Thames

skaters zip past people, booths, flags.

A giant ox roasts on a giant spit.

Arm in arm, Shakespeare and Ellen skate:

Over a glassy spot in the ice they peer down

where a blue cloak floats:

fish below.

Singing carolers pass on skates.

Henley Street

February 8, 1615

O

ne year the Thames froze and above
London Bridge it became a market, hobbled with ragged booths, stalls, flags and
streamers, peopled with courtiers, beggars, soldiers, priests, merchantmen and
their families. An ox was roastedâand as it steamed and smokedâwalkers
clustered around the carcass as if it were Holland. Skaters spun close,
stopping to chat or buy and eat, then spun away over the ice.

For days the surface was free of snow and one afternoon I
brought Ellen, and we skated arm in arm, the sky unblemished; we swished
between ice-bound frigates, toqued sailors leaning over, waving and jeering. It
was almost Christmas and carolers sang around bonfires. Royalty had set up
tents and we were welÂ­comed there, the tents and flags reflected in the ice,
purple, red, yellowâpenÂ­nants squares gayâmen and wenches tipplingâmusicians
trying to keep their feet warm, strumming bravely.

Ellen, in plaid scarf, yellow cloak and jeweled tam, stands
alongside a striped purple and gold tent, laughs alongside the scabby hulk of a
frigate, warms her hands before a fire. Ellen...your face is real... I can
reach out and take your hands...you smile and sway in the wind.

Singing with the carolers, your breath puffs its toadstool
alongside my mushÂ­room, and we laugh and hug each other. Inside a carpeted
tent, we toast âWasÂ­sail!â and glance at velvet cushions heaped in a corner.

Henley Street

Stratford

Mine was the wish to bind society together, expose the floor
of heaven, make immortal real, show manâs folly and labor, extol faith and
uphold beauty. Beauty, as I felt it at the outset of my career, is no longer
here: it is a long way from
VeÂ­nus and
Adonis
to
Henry

VIII:

there were grim diversions, rude and costly failures: my goal it seems is
beggared: if I had the capacity I would reach back to beauty and carry it
forward with greater maturity: I am thinking of poetic beauty.

Farewell! You were too dear for my possessing,

for such riches where is my deserving...?

I
lost sensibility and communion in pursuit of plot and character for the ricoÂ­chet
of horror and death, for the mockery of crime and subterfuge.

At times, I was in sleep a kingâbut on waking, no such man.

I have been awake to my losses a long while: there was no recouping
them in France and Italy, alone with hegemony of rocks, promontories, beaches,
hierarÂ­chy of seas assailing nakedness...here in Stratford, here I have illness
as exchange.

Sallow yellow:

Men, women and children dying in the streets:

Church bells tolling.

Three men drag a dead youth to the Avon River,

pitch him in.

Church steeple, reflected in the water, sways:

The church registry lists column after column of dead:

Not a sound.

I

n Stratford, the plague moved down
Mill Lane, Butt Lane, Rother Street, jumped to Henley and then Church Street.
Father and I worked on Mill Lane: finding Charles collapsed by the whipping
post, we lugged him out of the sun...shivering...sweating...vomitÂ­ing...and we
could not find anything to cover him, and he begged us for a cover.

âSomething to cover me, Will...just something?â

âBut thereâs nothing left for you.â

âEverything used up?â

âAll used, Charles.â

âSo
many of us sick?â

âLie still. Iâll bring you hot sack. Thatâll help you feel
better...thereâs a rug...â

âIâll see if I can find something to cover him.â

âNo, youâre tired. Iâll bring hot sack and a cover.â

Pigeons swooped low, then rose: were they afraid?

Six people had died that day.

During the week twenty-six died, men, women, and children.
Our town heard the bell toll morning and afternoon and evening. At times the
tolling seemed to be right in my ears; at times I forgot it, bringing water or
food, medicine or cover, anything to help. Father and I worked together as much
as possible...his word or nod kept me going.

The Avon seemed blotched and diseased for there, there was
the plagueâs mucous caulking the water and the water was grey and beaten and
unmoving, locked in its own foetidness, dead by the weir, dead by the church and
underÂ­neath the bridge.

Stratford

February 14, 1615

I remember the plague, how, with our theatre closed, I
worked to aid the sick and cart away the London dead. Appleton...I remember his
red beard, his cough, his scared grin. Meerie, talking Irish, blamed us, saying
âthereâs narra a plague in Irelandâitâs your filthy Londonâyou damn filthy
foreigners!â Miller cursed the altar and the saints behind his head, as he
struggled to breathe. And that garÂ­goyle-like fellow, Fackler, crawled off to
die or recover, we never learned: he said the open field was the proper place
to get well, or die.

The Cheney twins died right outside the Globe: they had been
working as stage hands: clever lads from Sussex, faithful, hard-working: they
got sick on Tuesday; as the bells tolled on Thursday evening they were dead,
dying a few minutes apart, their hands clasped, eighteen years old,
flax-headed, tall.

Why did that young woman, with hair to her waist, run about
laughing, eating handfuls of earth? Why did that Dorsetshire man stab himself
with a dirk? How did the graves of the Boothby children get left open, deserted
for days? Was God in the heavenly lectern those days...to save us of our sins!

For days the sun chewed us in Blackwell. It gave us a chance
to kill some of the rats. Caesar, donât let one bite you! Worms crawled out of
the earth. Caesar, beware! Whenever I passed our cemetery I smelled new, raw
earthâas terrifying as the death smell. âSblood, how many deaths does it take
to satisfy the earth?

Youthâ

What is this vomit, this black gunk pouring out of your
mouth? Are you only fourteen...with death on your face?

This is our boy, Slade, who walked to school last week and
fished where I fished.

âPapa, letâs carry him into the shade. Weâll cool his hot
face and give him water. Our medicine has to make him well. We need him, to
grow up and catch perch and pike, and marry Jenny.â

Papa is washing his face. Thereâs fruit. Thereâs sleep.
Thereâs tomorrow. Thereâs kindness. Thereâs forgetfulness.

Best to cover him.

Iâll cover him. There, that blanket may keep him from
shivering. His motherâs sick too. Iâll rub his hands and arms. Water, Papa,
give him some. There!

âPapa, you get some rest, while I stay with Slade. Youâd
better go home and turn in. You didnât sleep much last night. Things are better
now. No. Iâm not hungry. Iâll eat later.â

Iâll sit with you, boy, and weâll deny harsh fortune. Did
you ever see a play, boy? The playâs the thing: it takes you out of yourself.
Listen...Iâll recite some lines for you...

Farewell! a long farewell, to all this...

This is the state of man: today he puts forth

The tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms,

And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;

The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;

And, when he thinks, good easy man, fully surely

His greatness is a ripening, nips his root,

And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,

Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders

This many summers in a sea...

Farewell, heâs dead.

Papa, you and I have lost him. Heâll never race across the
fields or pack his creel or kiss a girl on the bridge. The plague has killed
him.

Was it you who wanted a new cap?

Now youâll have a cap of dirt.

I throw my heart against the flint of time. O sun, burn your
great spheres... I importune death a while. The passing of so small a thing
should make a crack at least. Stained with his own blood...

Grey yelping dogs chase a coach through London fog:

Fog drips from coach lamps, from trees, iron railings.

Someone in the fog screams and

a cloaked figure stabs Ellen

as she gets into her coach.

Ellenâs cloak, blood, fog,

Shakespeareâs anguished face.

Henley Street

February 20, 1615

F

og, that old-year-treachery, steals
round my house, thief at every window: renegade, despot, carrion-maker.

That night the fog mauled us after we left the theatre, Ellen
and I. I thought of throwing my cloak around both of us, as we walked along: dark
blue cloak in white fog. Instead of covering both of us I covÂ­ered her...

The play had been well played, Alleyn up to form, Marloweâs
lines appreciÂ­ated by a better than usual audience, some of them royalty.
Tambourlaine

usually appeals to royalty. This was Crown night, Christâs crown, hellâs crown,
fog on every thorn, thorns sticking through our laughter, to be remembered, in
that cloak, bastard thorns.

Like dogs they followed us as we left the theatre, late, our
arms around each other, the cloak flapping, fog leaving us inconspicuous. I saw
her carriage apÂ­proaching, inching the fog, fog through the spokes of her
wheels. And then outÂ­cries, and Ellen beside me, falling, and as she fell I
turned and saw my cloak slide with her, lantern and dagger on the road,
misericord.

Here it is now: yes, here it is: I have it, pricking thing
for future pricking, if need be: long, needle-pointed: Toledo steel: the right
length to kill herâor me.

Laughter and fog, spines and theatre, the royalty of crime
in a London gutter; time doesnât remove them, can not remove them.

When we could we located guardsâtrustworthy menâand with a
constable informed her servants and posted guards. Later, Jonson and I sat with
her docÂ­tors and learned a little more about pain. I went for Ellenâs brother
and he came, a cold young man who resembled Ellen, a slight fellow in handsome
black. Hand on sword, he drew himself up, face ashen, mouth trembling...

âIâll comb London for them...get them...â

Jonson often visited her, his words and thoughts the stuff
for those days, my brain run dry, bats coasting out, Enobarbus memories:

Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleases
their deities to take a manâs woman from him, it shows the tailors of the
earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to
make new...so grief is crowned with consolation.

Did I write that?

Henley Street

February 26, 1615

I
am not able to write poetry and yet I must write, must tell the teller, crush
the shards of illness. What is life, the undone and the done, the foolish and
the great? I hate drowning in real and invented apprehensions but mine is the
stumÂ­bling, after the play, after the comÂ­pliments and the celebration, a
mixture more brew than sanity admits.

My pen jerks and my hand wavers and my head aches, and I
watch faint light creep into the sky, exacting a promise from me to defy pain.

I hate sleeplessness on a foggy night like this, for there
is something in the fog that makes death come alive, that sears the sordid into
the mind...what was the cause: contorted memories? Am I afraid to die, be laid
in straw or committed to a sulfurous pit?

Give me my rope, put on my crown...

Memory is for me acting in a dissolve, cloud of rain,
concatenation of nothÂ­ings, performing yet recalcitrant, ambiguous and poor.
Here, in this town, this room smelling of spilled wine, the candles ugly, I see
a woman, the filaments of yesterdayâs straw tangled in her hairâselling love
for a price. Why is love obtuse, ruthless, rain-buried, eerie and demanding,
slinking one to the other?

Stratford

March 2, 1615

I write with rain across my oriel, and the fire almost out
in my fireplace, and my loneness sniveling in its pot. I am sick of self-pity.
I taste with wretched apÂ­petite, so be it! To be generous, hungry, guiltless,
and free...what would I give!

Pincers, pinch harder at the rushes, keep the light burning
as long as possible, for each of us.

At my age, I am guilty of longings that I can never realize:
dreams hawsered to nowhere. I have been guilty of this all my life. I copulated
with commas. I hunted dreams on paperâcheap privateer! I was priest, pharaoh,
general, slave, glutton. Paper is a sickness, a sweltering fever, clammy
forehead, thudding pulse, ague within ague: so I am a man of paper, elongated,
soggy, contorted, multiple of calligraphic speculation: paper bones, paper
heart, paper skull, paper blood, paper penis.

Listen, isnât that time rustling a sheath of paper?

Snow buffets Shakespeareâs cottage:

Snow enters a window.

There are varnished ceiling beams,

varnished furniture,

books and manuscripts.

A stunning woman appears, smiles, fades,

beckons seductively, disappears.

Henley Street

March 5, 1615

Y

esterday it snowed, and during the
afternoon I fell asleep and dreamed I saw King Henry and Shallow crossing the
fields beÂ­yond my windows.

âO God, that one might read the book of fate,â I heard King
Henry say, as I followed, hidden from view. âI wish to see the revolution of
the times make mountains level, and the continents, weary of solid firmness,
melt itself into the sea and, other times, to see the beach girdle the ocean...â

âThere is a history in all menâs lives, figuring the nature
of the times deÂ­ceased...â

Was it Shallow who said that?

Though I am confused, I recall the gaunt face of Alleyn as
he spoke those lines, that stormy night, when our theatre rattled. He was
infirm with fever and yet played on; he seldom let us down.

Winter is here again, to make our beds uneasy. Oh, for a
muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention, and return me
to my youth!

This is a document in madness because pain seldom leaves
me...

Oh, to be young and tumble a naked woman on a bed, quarrel
desperately and make up, burn the night learning and unlearning lines, defy the
elements, dally along the Thames, out-shout the gulls, see a mermaid behind a
rock.

Youth has such powers! Youthâs rule rules his own court by
championing a hundred causes, ordaining and cancelling, defying and
acknowledging, digging canals, raising temples.

Slave of every beautiful woman he meets, he presents her
with lasting riches and eternal potency. He conquers every country for her: his
grail, his fleet batÂ­tering an endless Armada to bring her into port, no gale
too wild.

Henley Street

Monday, â15

When I taught school at Snitterfield, Jonson came now and
then to prime my Greek and Latin. He used to say, âYou should have done a lot
less fishing in the Avon, boy! Why, these fellows will never learn, not the way
you teach. See, they grin at you. They love you. Call them churls, cane them;
make them scat when you appear!â

Away from school, Jonson would slip into theatre talk and
urge me to rejoin him: âYour poems are remembered. You have to come back, Will!
Iâll find you a patron. Nowâs the time to write plays... Iâll help you put them
on the stage.â

I told him I was afraid of the London plague. He scorched me
with a âhaw-haw.â âTeachingâs your plague, man!â

Henley Street

April 20, 1615

Teaching was forgotten at Fair time, good food, acrobats,
cockfights, gamÂ­blingâthere was something to keep us spellbound spelling
laughter! Games and dances went on at all hours. Cinquepace was the fast, new
step. How I liked it! There were plenty of pickpockets but I had nothing to
pick but my loneliness. When I danced with a red-cheeked girl there was sperm
in every movementâthose giddy curls and hot hands, the smoke of sizzling fish,
howls of the stinking bear baiters.

Stratford

Trumpets blared... I heard them days after the Fair.

I stayed on as long as possible in Snitterfield, to
contribute what I could to my familyâs upkeep in Stratford. Then came the day
when the school board asked me to find another job; so it was back to London
again, to Jonson and his half-ass promises, back to city trumpets, strumpets,
rattle of carriages, pismire poverty, paunched patrons and perfumed snowballs
for the Queenâs masque...

Stratford

While I was at Snitterfield, I had the companionship of a
girl whose fourteen years should have been double fourteen to equal her double
sight for fox, hawk, raven and snail: she was unreal because she could bring me
to the brink of fanÂ­tasy by gesture or word: âHush, there, over there, in the
grass by the stile.â Her flip-smile had the best of both pook and pagan. What
she wore seemed a part of her blondeness, a blondeness often eerie with an
eeriness that worried me, to be quickly saved by her smile or laughter. Her low
voice set the stage for confiÂ­dencesâthread between goldenrod, rabbit lying in
the entry of its burrow, lark rising.

Faith and I had lingering afternoons and saw the first of
fog before dark, heard the last of bird sounds before sleep: her house next
door to mine taught me, by window and door, the wretchedness of her life: her
fatherâs drunken beatings, kickings, savagery: so, to escape the village clod
we escaped together, to sit by a woodland stream and hear words by leaves as
they sifted down. Faith had her legs in the water, up to her knees, or lay on
the embankment, the color of her flesh gleaming. Her beauty was not a pair of
breasts but a pair of hazel eyes and a dimple in her chin. She was tall, a
cathedral figure in caenstone, the stone so alive yet ecclesiastical, erect,
her posture one of graceful expectation: repose flowed from her: her thin hands
lifted to her thin face: her hair straggled to her shoulders and down her back
or was combed into a flaxen haycock. I thought my teaching infinitely poorer
than hers and went with her whenever possible, helping her withstand the
disgrace at home.

I thought many times of going back to see Faith Stanton but
even the changeless changes and woodland jewels, claiming socketless eyes,
reflect only images of the mind. Drunkenness outlives beautyâthe clod burying
haycock, bog and girl.

Henley Street

Goddamn my hair!

My hair, with its copper and red, used to say: This is your
world, boy!

Damn my wrinkles! My gallows neck!

My face was once all right.

Now one cheek has begun to cave in under my eye, the wince
of lechery, no doubt, and meteors, no less. Lines around my mouth give the
impression that I have never had a good timeânever laughed. My eyes, when I
swivel them in a mirror, warn me that grave changes are taking place inside and
that denials will get me noÂ­where: grey hairs, wrinkles, poor viÂ­sion...they
are the roistering gift of time, markings on the stone, to remind myself that I
am here, that escape is never, that courage is all that counts, humor with its
leg lifted on the monument, peeing on vanity.

The sullen bell called me to school and I went reluctantly,
leaving my fishing pole behind the door, pike and trout lost to me. Early
morning was almost beyond endurÂ­ance; I rubbed my eyes and stumbled downstairs,
to eat amid yappings, survive, survive.

I did not resent school when Hunt read aloud in Latin,
reading masterfully, giving us Caesar, Antony, and Cleopatra. When he read, I
wandered beside the pyramids, the Nile dotted with boats, ibis, and heron; I
tramped battlefields, fought with black spears piercing the hot, dusty air. It
was along the Avon that I sensed manâs struggle. I saw. Heard. As the water
grew greener and greener and deeper and deeper, the air motionless, the past
was there, Huntâs past, Cleopatraâs...her barge, like a burnished throne, burnt
on the water; the poop beaten gold, purple the sails, so perfumed that the
winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, which to the time of
flutes kept stroke...

When I dared I got away early and went to fish or loafed at
the mill pool where I hung my feet in the Avon and counted dragonflies, my line
thrown as far as I could throw it. Sitting on a mossy mound, I heard the
warblers and lark spell morning into warm sun.

Thirty-five years ago!

Summer:

Naked swimmers, five boys, penis fun, laughter:

Naked girls in bushes along the same river bank:

Church bells in distance:

Behind a copse boy and girl kiss and squirm.

G

rowing up, our greatest fun was
swimming, our greatest anguish church. From church, as quickly possible, we got
into nakedness, rival of summer lightning. We swam the Avon in laughter and rowÂ­diness,
three, four or five of us, and if others were at our favorite pool we chased
them off, our penises flying, rocks and yells going everywhere. We scared them
half to death, or, if we were in proper mood, we adopted them, kids like us; we
swam and climbed on them and trampled the ooze of plants, and the ooze slicked
our bodies over their bodies: I can feel it almost like a lover getting ready
to make love: and thatâs about what we did: we made love to the day and we made
love to the water: we yelled and slapped it and cuffed it into obedience, and
orgasmed it, and tore our legs till blood pricked, and then we swam and I was
pretty good and I out-swam some though some out-swam me, and we swam until we
felt cool and easy, and then lay on the grass by the mill, to watch the
swallows and gape and groan, like lovers after their bout in bed: our spirits ebbing
for the nonce, then rising to dress and yell and pull and sing and chase each other
home.

How I reveled in summer haying.

Usually, I loaded a small wagon pulled by Burt, Burt eying
me, snuffling at me as I pitched the hay: he was getting old and the grey of
his wooly hide was shedding outrageously; he lifted each black hoof slowly,
often fetching a fart. He liked working the field alone but I preferred working
with others. Stripped to the waist, hatless, I forked and grunted and Burt
pulled and farted. Some of the time I had to sing, the smell of hay and sun
inspiring my songs: sometimes, when I worked with others, all of us sang,
horses perkier for our merriment.

Mildred was as good at the fork as I: working side by side,
we often bumped and her blue eyes would widen and light up: pretty, blonde,
barefooted, she wore a blouse, skirt and Dutch apron: our field ended at the
river, an apple grove along the other sides. Two or three of us, in teams,
harvested Papaâs hay each season: I still smell the timothy and the girl.

Wonderful, wonderful and most wonderful...and yet another.

Henley Street

Choir singing was boringâjust sucking melancholy out of
songâand whenÂ­ever I could, I skipped it and went off with Becky. No matter how
icy, there was fun, hands linked, our runny noses beatific: Becky, whose giggle
alerted every boy, was my girl whenever we could steal away and turtle
huntâthat was our joy: tirelessly, we combed the creeks and river, staying long
past staying time, scolded but not caring.

I see her giddy black eyes, brown mop, skinny legs, tiny
hands and tiny feetâbarefooted beside me, wetting herself to the legpits,
screeching or silent, often too silent, wading lustily. She loved to steal apples,
raspberries, strawberries, turnips, hungry from morning till night. I peeled
turnips for her and we munched them on a stile, then raced one another,
slithered downstream:

âThereâs one, see, on that log. Be quiet!â

âIâll get âim.â

âNo, let me. Itâs my turn. Heâs tiny. Heâs for me.â

âGo slowly.â

A few times Becky and I rang the church bells for the
sexton; together, we stole buns and cookies at home, but best of all we stole
happiness, books in running brooks.

She married a seaman and lives in London: I warrant you
there are eight chilÂ­dren, a happy familyâGod bless tâem! I would not change
the story.

Henley Street

Motherâmemories of you are mostly memories of songs you used
to sing when sleep was near, lovingly, patiently, sung in my room, close to the
varnished beams, curtains drawn, as you sat or lay beside me or rested in a
nearby chair.

Our favorite song was âHappy be thou, heavenly queen...manâs
comfort and angelâs bliss...of all women thou hast the prize...â

And I remember each word of Sanctusâand hear each word as
you sang it lingeringly; sometimes your hand kept time; sometimes your fingers
covered mine.

Stabat Mater Dolorosa...

So many years have lapsed that I have forgotten how you
looked, only your eyes and thin figure and voice remain: I hear you when you
called us in from play: âToo-lee-looly-loo,â you called, shepherding your six
for supper and bed.

I roam about, room to room, stooping for a bedroom doorway,
floors creaking, the varnished beams always the same, three floors of thinking
about me, windows you used to look out of, beds you used to makeâor was that anÂ­other
house, another time, another illusion? My house, your house, our houseâwho owns,
who makes traitorous gifts, decisions, contracts, to pile millions of acres of
dirt on top of us later?

At the Globe, when I was young, I received quite a visitor!
Ben Jonson brought Sir Francis Drake. Ben was a sharer of friends. I was
dumbfounded but âEl Draque,â contemptuously at ease, sat on my backstage table,
his plumed hat and red gloves flung on top of a litter of plays. He and Ben
discussed a masque Jonson was to produce.

Young as I was, it took courage to speak to âEl Draqueâ
because even his purple hat shocked me. But I managed to ask about his attack
on Cadiz. Lines warped his mouth, and he said, stroking his corn husk chin:

âIt was a matter of guns...we singed the Kingâs whiskers
through our superior armament. Ah, good winds too. We had great luck! Donât you
believe in luck? When you write a play, isnât it luck, lucky weather, luck with
your players, luck with your attendance, the right kind of royalty attending at
the right time?â

I saw him again after the defeat of the Armada, at a crowded
Thames anÂ­chorage. Wounded, he looked older, livid scar on his cheek, the fire
dead in his eyes, his expression one of cynicism and fatigue. He wore a squat,
official hat. No rings. Leaning against a spattered capstan, he seemed smaller
than I had remembered him; he did not recognize me.

âOur fire ships forced the Armada out of anchorage, broke up
their plan!â he said, talking to a group of officers.

âPut yourself on a fire ship,â he boomed. âYouâre at the
rudder. Sheâs aflameâflames are roaring aft! Your whole shipâs blazing but
somehow you bugger her against a Spanish hull. Youâre beaten off. Theyâre
afraid you have a powder mine in your hold. Thereâs cannon shot! You dive
overboard. Itâs a long, icy swim. Most men never make it out of that water...

âWhat we needed was more gun shot, more ammunition, kegs and
kegs of powder; then, by God, weâd have run them clean to Spain, run them, not
waited, our guns useless. We had to sit it out, waitâno powder. We didnât dare take
a chance. Think of it, everything to our advantage but we dared not move. We
had to bluff.â

I wrote down his wordsâbut I still hear them, it might be
five or six years ago, not thirty!

Deceptions of mind bother me: unrehearsed, the brain
bedevils and stacks lie on lie...in the lays of time. I turn my glass and am
alone, the cuckold of myself reflected in three hundred sixty-five mirrors. My
spirits, as in a dream, are bound up, and like the Armada, strewn on shores and
still more rocky shores...

Memoryâs snowfall rattles every door and window in my house.
Was it the once lost winter thirty years ago in London? From door to door, I
begged for work: my hands blue, legs quaking, face frost-galled. Belly empty,
pocket empty, I harried taverns, bakeries, homes. People mistrusted me, that
wild-haired kid, goat-beardedâdoors slammed in my face. Blinded by snow, I headed
for the Thames, for the bridgeâshelter there. On the way, I passed a tavern and
opened a door: a crowd of young men faced me: I asked for work and was given a
sculÂ­lery job, supper and a mat by the stove: Iâll never forget the warmth of
that mat by that stove: I wanted nothing more: cherry voices and warmth: it all
comes back!

A piece of bread in one hand, I fell contentedly asleep. An
elephantine man, with florid face and scraggly beard, wakened me roughly.

âNext time you go to sleep donât let the rats share your
bread,â Falstaff gufÂ­fawed.

Stratford

May 23

Falstaff helped me find an old cloak and helped me borrow
boots and gloves. He got me a stagehand job. Later, he showed me where I could
purchase stolen things, sharing his room with him: ribaldry, punning,
gargantuan laughter, thievÂ­ery, friends, foolishness, foppery, wit and wine.
Little did I think of using him in a play during the weeks I lived with him. In
those days, I had never written a line.

Like an umbrella, his character sheltered me from
depression: he introduced me to Marlowe, Kyd, Jonson. Years later, I introduced
him to Alleyn and BurÂ­bage; Burbage wanted him on stage but Falstaff had his
own stage where he could dupe and bedevil, unmolested by paid gapers. By then,
he was getting old and liked puttering and sleeping best.

Those were mad times, those days with Falstaff, and yet, behind
every laugh lay the threat of poverty, the knife blade of quarrels, reason gone
unreasonable. Night after night we went to sleep hungry. With glue and nail we
pieced our shoes together, for one more day. With needle and thread we patched
our clothes. Falstaff pulled my wisdom tooth to save the barberâs fee: âOpen
wide, yell! There, Iâve got it, Will, spit now. Spit, boy.â

In a few ways Falstaff resembled my father: both were
unassuming, generous, dilatory: their fat portraits hang side by side in my
mind: the last I heard from my friend was a brief word from Dover where he was
working for a shipbuilder and lived in a shanty by the sea.

He would have roared at his role in my plays: he would have
objected to his cowardice, upheld his zeal, begged me for a thousand pounds,
and tried to bribe me for the address of a pretty woman.

Friend...you were eel-fish, bullâs pizzle, dried neatâs
tongue and stockfish! When you were born the front of heaven was full of fiery
shapes and the goats ran from the mountains.

A cockroach creeps about my room, an X on its back, the only
roach branded in my roost. I see it in the morning, when I sit down to write.
It favors a corner, where there is a deep crack, in case of an intruder or
wrath on my part. It has a stiff carriageâmuch more so than any of the others.
Ruler, no doubt, with excessive responsibilities! So I have decided to call it
Bill. Certainly all other roaches seem afraid of this Conqueror. When I find it
on my table, I make a pass at it and it leaps with a scut. It eats paperâold
and new. It munches leftovers, liking cheese best, though I think the cheese is
pretty well divided between the roaches and the mice.

May 26, 1615

Why am I disliked in Stratford? Is it because I drive a hard
bargain? Is it beÂ­cause I have assumed, at least at times, an actorâs air? They
say I stand aloof but is it possible to cross the Avon to their side? My side
is Ptolemyâs, Priamâs, CleoÂ­patraâs, Coriolanusâ. We four are difficult to
appraise as we walk along Henley Street. The local folk have never heard the
creak of chariot wheels.

Lonely...I have been lonely and am lonelier now, but which is
lonelier, the pod with one pea or the pod with aliens? True, I have sued for
money; true, I have acquired property. And the city man and country man
mistrust one another: the writer fits in nowhere: yet, since this is home, I
try to accommodate myself, say âyesâ to Mr. Combe, and help if I can. âYes, M.â

I never could introduce Ann to Londoners and she has been
unable to introÂ­duce me to Stratford people. If I were well, if I could write,
I would spit on Avon.

Combe is the only person in S. who has seen any of my plays;
however, when I talk with him, he confuses scenes and characters; his
appreciation is based on pride that says âI can speak of Shakespeare.â A Puritan,
he patronizes incoming Puritans more than most, helping them infest this town,
making it a sawtooth of moral crud, chair and whip in line, summoning whispered
inquisitions.

Monday

What fools we mortals are, for I who wrote of shrews married
a shrew who is more shrewful than any Kate from Padua. I laugh at my own
defeat, a shrew beside a shrew, players nodding at my marital bewilderment, I,
the drunkard drunk on illusions. Shall we list her infidelitiesâcountry-man at
Fair, con-man, neighbor? Shall we name names?

Shakespeare and Ann, at ruins of Kenilworth castle,

copulating in the grass, happy in their bucolic lust.

The two trudge, hand in hand:

Ann ups her skirt and they flop again, giggling:

âTwins,â she says.

Henley Street

I

Â married a shrew and yet thirty
years ago, Ann and I knew hot jolÂ­lity at Kenilworth, the grass a hide under
us, pigeons reconnoitering castle walls, a falcon lawing the sun. Since Ann and
I had a few days for ourselves, we had ridden to K. She was Sweet Villain, and
when we pastured the horses and unstuffed our knapsacks, we stuffed ourselves,
and sacked ourselves, gorging in sun, the horses stomping and snuffling beyond
us. Sweet Villain pulled up her skirts after we had drunk more than we should
and I was glad I had not married another. She said âYour hairâs redder,â and I
said âYour hairâs yellower,â meaning where, and our laughter went bounding.

We sacked that old busky castle from wall to wall, writing
on scalded plaster, pushing over abutments, throwing rocks at a fox. From some
crater corner, we looked up, our heads dusty, holding each other sexround, our
fierceness there while falcons fought, clipping each other, beaking one
another, feathers falling. Kenilworth and kings: we smelled unsavory dungeons
but pushed our falconry over them, our naked seel better than intercourse of
power and time: among the marl, we viewed puffs of smoke from country homes,
saw water gleaming, a windmill turning, sheep among sheep, their woolly backs
humping toward a rainy sunset.

Soon, soon, time was to tear away our love, but we did not
suspect: we were the confidents, our jollity amusing because fastened to
laughter, no wrack or confusion: it was slap of hands on bare buttocks, âahâ
over breast, mouth suckÂ­ing, suckling, surprising, surfeiting, back again for
more: the taste of loveâs bite the waist around, the hand up, down, and the
grass its hide browner, browner than our flesh, her flesh ignited from within,
so burned for me.

Stratford-on-Avon

We ate off wooden plates, tulips blooming in the garden,
blue and white ChiÂ­nese plates hanging on the wall, and lilacs blooming in the
garden...in a dream I confronted him and he was monarch and he said to me: I am
Hamnet, come, weâll go to the guild chapel and hear the sermon...it was a cold
sermon but honÂ­eysuckle was blooming in the garden...orioles were singing above
the oriel. ColÂ­umbine, ferns, and lilies were on the cabinet: she said to me:
Come, Will, eat! I said to her: listen, I hear the pegs moving inside the
beams: that is for integrity. Ivy grew on the east wall of my house in those
days.

June 3, 1615

Alone, following the Roman wall, as it girdled London, I
used to speculate where the Roman gods had gone; thinking, as well, of those of
Egypt and Greece...time with a scroll on his back, asking alms. Smashed bricks,

memento

mori,
along that vast, yellow, unweeded garden, were
questions in their own right, broken, to be kicked aside, as are our own
questions concerning mortality.

Gazing at the Thames, I hoped for hope from the wide wall,
wider river and broader mystery. I went over my
plays...Ulysses...Cleopatra...Prospero... The wall, with its imperialism and
legion of whispers, said âno, master, no,â speaking in the voice of Learâs
fool.

Ellen and I climbed the castle where Caesar lived, the
tallest site in London, the Thames below, flowers and vines crawling over
ruins, the walls of yesterday saying âEt tu Brutus.â

Danger knows full well that hate is doubly dangerous: we are
two lions litÂ­tered in a day, and the litter of stones crumbles underfoot, but
Ellen cries out to me, and I catch her by the arm.

There is a white sail on the river...

Ay, me, how fine a thing the heart of woman! I thought it
then and think it still, the very best of her is gentle subtlety: it is this
that takes a man in.

A flock of blackbirds lit below us, covering the fallen
stones like black hail.

We went many times to that castle and walked along its
ancient yellow walls; she asked me for poetry and I repeated lines: what were
they, I wonder?

Now...most noble one...the gods stand friendly today, that
we may, lovers in peace, lead on our days to age:

I am constant as the northern star, of whose true-fixed and
resting Quality there is no fellow in the firmament...the skies are painted
with unnumbered sparks...they are all afire, and every one doth shine; but thereâs
but one in all doth hold his place: so in the world...

The stars came out, a summerâs night on Caesarâs place, and
we heard frogs and the tittering of lovers, ourselves loving that place, our
flesh, that empirical wisdom. We went so often we called it âour castle.â

June 5, 1615

At Christmas skirling bagpipers, piping a
waulking

song, greeted us at Dunira. Ellenâs room, in a squat tower, faced a narrow lake
with ragged shore pines and a small island, wild geese and ducks resting on the
water, cold, cold, moss blue water.

Sun crossed the bear rugs and tiles of her floor.

Her bed was canopied with green velvet
embroidered with golden shields and crossed spears, seen on her coat-of-arms.

She called my attention to the pulls on the heavy drapes,
each pull a carved ivory ball enclosing a ball inside another.

Hand in mine, she showed me her collection of silver, gold,
and ivory fans, fans from Egypt, Greece and India, arranged on her walls, some
open, some in cases, flabellum with bone handles, Venetian lace fans, tomb fans
with gold-encrusted ribs, a Greek fan like an acanthus leaf. I can see the
movement of her lips as she described them; I can see her hand, pointing.

We often walked around the lake and through the pollarded
garden, its cyÂ­presses like stone columns: we walked the moors until Christmas
cold sent us shivering to the big fireplaces where we talked and ate and sang
and drank.

Someone kept the fire blazing in her fireplace and we would
sink down on her bed or lie on the bear rug and make love, the firelight
skirling her ivory, her fans and the canopyâs yellow silk lining.

Hugh opened our door one morning very early, while we were
busy making love, and with a boisterous laugh he said:

âI just finished with my woman; when youâre done, weâll go
hunting. The horses are saddled. Better lock your door next time!â

Hughâhis huge body on a huge hunterâled us hunting along a
loch, where the ocean, squeezed as in a glass case, shuddered, as though
resentful of its trap, as though it considered everyone as intruder. I was awed
by the waterâs dark and the chasms menacing it. Deer eluded us and while we
followed the loch, I lost interest in the hunt for the quarry of sea and earth,
spirit and well-being.

Hunting, walking, eating, drinking, love-making, this was
the happiest time of my life. Her brotherâs acceptance amounted to adoption; he
often came to my room and talked at length, sharing intimacies; the only
misadventure during my stay was an attack of hungry peasants who swarmed the
castle court, shrilly deÂ­manding food, some in kilts with silent bagpipes.

Ellen and I visited the ruins of a sprawling Cistercian
abbey on her Dunira property; there, under the vaulted archway, where roses
climbed, I felt inspired, and, staying on I wrote
Cymbeline,
scenes and
words coming easily, happiness a constant companion: the sweetness of her
personality seemed altogether mine. Words and fleshâthey were mine, in that sun
and cloud world of Dunira.

The weather settled into a steady spell, my room overlooking
garden, lake and bluecap forest. London might have been at the bottom of the
sea: I could not have cared less. Its dirt and beautyâI never missed them.

Visiting the abbey frequently, we met several of the monks
who resided in a section of the refectory; their geniality contented us and we
lingered with them, in their herb garden, by a fountainâpigeons about. A marvelously
tiny man, spry though old, gave us a parchment book, one he had rubricated,
pleased to see us in love.

Hugh accompanied us occasionally to bring food for the
brothers, making the short trip with donkeys carrying loaded panniers. He, too,
would linger, sharing our mood.

Abbey garden, fountains, vegetables and herbs in rows:

O

n the Scottish coast the sunset
prowled the lowtide combers, rollÂ­ing cloud into cloud, wave into wave. The
clouds absorbed orange with yellow and the yellow took on red, the red brooming
low, sweeping shoreward, reaching the sand at our feet.

Is it true that we saw the sunset together, her arms around
me, the rocks beÂ­yond us red, the sunset extending for miles? The moon rose out
of a rust-colored sky?

âDarling, ours is a supreme happiness and we must cherish
it,â she wrote me long ago.

For years I kept her letters in my desk at Blackfriarâs
house, to lose them when the place burned: waxed, ribboned and perfumed
letters, from France, Italy, and Scotland. I could rewrite some of them from
memoryâsome.

At the time I received her letters I thought that a number
of them had been detained much too long and I thought several of them had been
tampered with. I put this aside as fancy for I was willing to be blind. As I
think back itâs odd I never suspected censorship. And why was it I never knew
till later that she and her family opposed the Queen?

The knife of oneâs own stupidity cuts deepest!

A year or two after the attack on her, when she was back in
Scotland, she wrote that Hugh was assassinated in Glasgowâan Elizabethan
courtesy, someÂ­one said. The shock was more of a shock coming from her: Hugh
dead, big Hugh, with his cleft beard, bushy eyebrows, and mop of greying hair:
the bigness of his Dunira castle comes to me, along with his hospitality.

For years I was driven half insane by a dream of an
enveloping cloak:Â Â  the cloak swallowed my house, trees, sun, and stars: I
heard a woman scream inside this luminous thing. Behind the folds was a bearded
face, coming closer and closer.

Henley Street

I was headed for home when I met Ellen and the autumn sun
favored us, potentates meeting by a river, our kingdom the leaves along the
shore, the ash red, our introduction friends, our hopes instantaneous. I saw
beneath her gloves to her veined hands; I saw her veined breasts beneath her
dress; I saw beneath her smiles the invitation, rebuffs, wiles...

Yet who dares to know royalty outside the theatre!

Home, I reminded myself, is Stratford; but, who among us
remembers home and fidelity?

I loved home once, my Ann, my children, and the sharing of
the things a man wants to share. I loved these in my groin and the raves of
sweetness summoned me, over and over, till I was worn out and imperious
insomnia stalked and kept me at my desk or sent me.

How can it be, in the midst of aged foolishness, Ellen
appears, to convince, to distractâthose devil eyes of hers and that black hair
and her white, white skin begging love. When she speaks, I listen: I turn and
listen: I turn and listen again for she is theatre, its hush, its compassion,
its folly.

Jonson was right to introduce us; he thought to kill my pen
and wit. It was his plot to make me plotlessâgreat jest! He was right, for
sleepless nights swept around and the pulsing indirection of sex carried me to
her for yet another renÂ­dezvous.

Did I ever come to my senses: was it a week, month, or year?
Was it she who nailed the fog over my soul? Ah, crucifix between her breasts, so
soft, so imÂ­paled! What graciousness!

London
was too small for us for everyone perceived the unperceivable, imÂ­paired our
pairing and yet...but all this is past and the last seat empty.

We thought to escape to Rome, that eternal place for eternal
mouths. She ofÂ­fered me money and I refused. At the theatre she begged me to
accept, for us, for time, for love...and I accepted. On stage I swore to
testify but I hugged my testament and my lines faltered.

We have played our parts too often, our thighs packed with
wax, our mouths with honey; we bring it to the hive; and, like the bees, are
murdered for our pains.

June 18, 1615

For months I kept at the writing of
Antony and Cleopatra
âEllen
seldom out of my mind. Yet the writing was an abatement of anguish, scenes
lifting me out of maelstroms, Antonyâs turbulence alleviating mine. Apartment
and theatre were all I allowed myself, sharing time with Jonson, dividing
mutual crusts.

Rainârainâwhen has it rained more! It was well I had the
Egyptian sun to keep my bones warm.

Some scenes evolved easily; others fought me, full of sound
and fury. I could not visualize certain scenes on the stage and sometimes
strange actors walked the boards and stole my lines, fixing them with their own
personalities. Alleyn stalked as Caesar, and I had to re-write again and again.

Baxter affronted me with his buffoonery and I had to cross
out his lines. Phipsâour cheerful homosexualâhad Cleopatra in his perfumed
arms, jeering at me. Kempe jigged.

On
top of all this, insomnia set in and never left me for weeks. March â April â
May, it was the warmth of May that unlocked its crossbow and shot me outÂ­doors,
to sit and sit for hours.

There, in the sun, my shirt open, shoes off, grass alive,
lilacs alive, birds twirping, I knew I could make
Antony

and

Cleopatra

successful. There in the sun people and river came alive. The sunâs gnomon wrote.
I bowed my head and waited. At my desk, I hurled my sentiency... alive, it must
come alive, to hurl aside lifeâs muddle: alive: these people from the past must
speak: nothing is more remote than yesterday: speak to them: make them
chroniclers: break their sleep.

The Thames with anchored and sailing ships:

leaning on the taffrail:

She settles her tam and quotes from
Two

They talk of Naples as sailors leer at them

E

llen and I sailed the Thames, the
water stippled with gulls; our hands locked, we stood at the stern and hoped
for a smooth voyÂ­age, with love, our rudderbar credulous to us, the wind mild
and lasting. In Venetian wine there would be happiness, we promised each
other...

But why are you lost to me and I alive?

Ellenâwhat is this, that reaches round us and never arrives;
what is this that promises return?

Ours was a proper departure, landing us on the Italian
shore, love in a town of disinterested people.

Perhaps I want the impossible: yes, yes, I want that time
when we were there in Naples, when we strolled the seaside; when we sailed the
waterlanes and walked Roman streets and her fountains watched us with sleepy
eyes, spray beaded on some bronze arm.

I dislike borrowing things and yet Iâm borrowing memories,
borrowing time, those bronzes, our return, our boat bucking seas, sending us
north, ice off the larboard, back to reality, debts, conniving. We said
good-bye but our good-bye was postponement. Our wheel became St. Catherineâs.
At a gypsy tellerâs tent there was a kind of double silence.

I lived for my work, starved for it.

With my pen I quartered the earth and green pastures and
made them live for her and the witchcraft of hope, to shake off sadness and
burst the anarchies of soul.

Incorrect to heaven, some say.

June 22, 1615

What a cocked up play, my
Coriolanus.
To fill my
pocket! To fob off bad for good, that was it. I leaned on one crutch and fought
with anotherâand fell. Too many of my plays were crutched. I borrowed too much
from Plutarch and othÂ­ers. I worshipped royalty. I was too conventional, too
romantic, borrowing plots, borrowing, borrowing, double sure, never sure,
cocksure.

Henley

Midsummer-day

And I must guess the identity of her attackersâor why they
wanted her life. Christ, we had our list of suspects. And what came of our grim
suppositions? Nothing. We said: was it robbery, I prithee? Jealousy? Hatred?
Politics? We said. We have said and I go on saying. Thrift, Horatio,
thrift...and I have not saved.

June 26, 1615

Hamnet...

Today is your death day.

After you died I went to the shore and the seaâs clods of
wood and detritus infused in me a loneliness that nothing has every wiped out:
a wrangle of foam goes on and on inside me; the grey that topped the abyss of
ocean finds a darker grey in me; the gulls are sleep-flying for you.

Hamnet, my son...

Prince of my house, I loved you. We had such fun. Good day,
sweet boy, how dost thou, good boy? May flights of angels sing you on your way.
When you died, Stratford teemed with monsters. Your hand in mine, such a cold
hand, you said adieu. What God was this to snuff you out at eleven. Grief
stiffened me: I feel it today, when there should have been a birthday party not
a remembrance. The sea rolls back on me as I sit here, my legs unable to move,
pain working in me.

The Queen and her killings...time and its murders...they are
alike! The unfairÂ­ness of life, O what angels sing the truth? What angels! Go,
fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast inât.

God took him from me...damn the God that steals your son.

King of grief they might have called me. Now, all is mended
by many years: ours be your patience, your gentle hand lead us, and take our
hearts.

I had thought to leave him something beside my fatherâs
coat-of-arms. I had thought to introduce him to the theatre, have him think
about my plays, have him know the better part of London. He would have been a
friend of Drakeâs; perhaps he might have sailed on Raleighâs Virginia voyages.
Perhaps Jonson might have taught him Latin. Perhaps is my treadmill, and I wear
it thin.

He went to a few plays with me and thrilled to them. He
respected me. Loved me. What were his thoughts, as he died? To be such a short,
short time on stage! Was he resentful, bewildered? I think he was confused
because of the great fever. Good God, what was the use of his flowering? It was
an error of the moon...it makes men mad.

To thine own self be true, they say, and I, still harping, I
ask your credent ear to listen: we shall not look upon his like again?

Speak... I go no further.

Stratford-on-Avon

Flowers in my hand, I thought to visit his grave, but as I
limped across the yard, thinking of the bone house and how each of us ends
there, remembering those underneath my shoes, under the tree, under the
threatening sky, I laid the flowers on anotherâs grave, and the dove carved on
that granite nodded, as it were, pecked me across the grass, among the weeds,
reminding me of other menâs grief.

That woman, over there on her knees, isnât that Nancy
Richards? I recognize her shoulders and the back of her head. Her father died
last month.

What stupidity, this crawling, mewing, kneeling, this
unresurrectable world, with weeds that smell of dust.

I remember a kingâs grave in Denmark, with falcons carved on
it, falcons of black marble, perched on top a branch, carved black centuries
ago.

I walked through the rain, moving as fast as my legs would
let me, my soul full of discord and dismay, wishing I had not gone, resolved to
confine myself to myself, incarcerate my grief in my writing, or, if I could
not write, be ennobled, not afflicted as other men are with contagion.

The fault, dear Brutus...

After
his death, the dissentious Judith and Ann used to side against me: âHeâs no
good, Judith,â Ann preached vehemently. âWhat does he care for any of us! Heâs
always away in London. Youâve heard him say that lifeâs but a walkinâ shadow.
Weâre just so many shadows to him!â

I would stare at Judith after one of Annâs outbursts; I
would look at her and through some sort of necromancy I would see Hamnetâs
faceâI would rememÂ­ber our fun, our fishing, our swimming in the Avon.

It was not the constant conspiracy of Ann and Judith that
drove the final nail; it was Judithâs resemblance, same color and texture of
hair, same blue eyes, same half smile, same propensity to giggles, same way of rubbing
her hands on her clothes. I had always favored Hamnet because he and I had
shared more. Now, now that Judith lived, I could not accept his death. Of
course I never wanted her to die. As long as the twins lived there was accord.
If death must steal one of them...but I couldnât, wouldnât choose. Yet, in
ugliest anger, I had shouted my preference. And she knew I often saw Hamnet
when I looked at her: Iâve seen her run when I stared at her: Iâve heard her
cry: âMama, heâs looking at me that way!â

âThese are my twins,â I used to say, showing them to people.

Twins
âfor how long!

I bought her a goonhilly pony, an excellent pacer, and taught
her to ride. I got her a lamb and a puppy, I brought her gifts from London. I
brought her things from France and Italy. There was little chance to get
through to her because of Ann. If I won Judith for a while, I lost her when at
work in London. She never wrote to me...or Ann destroyed those letters. During
my years in the theatre, in London and touring the provinces, all those years,
I reÂ­ceived no note. She never expressed a desire to see one of my plays,
seemed disinterested in my life in the cityâunless it was to suggest I bring
something when I came home.

Home?

July 1, 1615

I am that wanderer of night, full many a morning have I seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye...

Thereâs memory, thatâs for remembrance; pray, you, love,
remember...and there is pansies; thatâs for thought...thereâs fennel for you,
and columbine; thereâs rue...you must wear your rue with a difference.

Through the years they mangled those lines! How cold to hear
them backÂ­stage! How cold to hear them now, here, in my room, echoing from
varnished beams, off-stage in my oriel of yesterday.

But I should not have gotten sick: I should have stayed in
London to the end, fought the Puritans, fought the King, the tax collectors,
the players of the shrewâs men!

Pain shut me out: the body must have its moments of
solaceâthe mind its soothsayer!

I would give you violets...but they are planted around a
gravestone.

I was a young man when I wrote those lines; like Ophelia I
ride on bawdy repetitions, error on error.

The table of my memory is dusted with crumbs.

Off-stage, the wind gushes; on-stage, thereâs a frenzied
pitch of âno!â

Chorus, players!

This love, this royalty by jackanapes brought to earth, the
stage to my back: what can a man affirm in such a position: flight? I speak to
her and she puts her fingers on my lips and holds her beauty like a whip over
me. The curtain came down quickly: fie, the curtain often comes down swiftly,
manipulated by fury, a last sound snapped out, muffling resolution, covering
courage...

There is a curtain for love and one for hate: there is a
curtain for youth and another for age. And when we finally realize these things
we are dotards, and our realization laughs.

The executionerâs curtain is no doubt the swiftest. The jig
makerâs safest. The priestâs dullest. The marinerâs loneliest. The loverâs
saddest.

July 8, â15

These pages are so unlike my plays and sonnets and yet I
have to struggle to get anything down! Here is my mock dukedom; since I can not
write any longer I look back across time from the shelf of my memory, longing
to improve my existence: I am certain that the old word-chattels gladly
deserted me, looking for a young man, no doubt, an upstart from Snitterfield,
enroute to London, riding a brood mare, humming...hey, non nonny...

...Heaven mend all!

Henley Street

July 9, 1615

Elsinore has a tongue of land that licks at time, a place that
ends with defeat, its castle and its people falling into apparitions.

Usurping night, Elsinore made me face the northern ocean,
irresolution. There was no illusion to being there: rain cusped out of sky: the
snow fell: it was a bitter time to see the place, a blastment. I had shaken off
that incessant pain that stabbed the roof of my skull each time I leaned over,
that writhed through my eyes: I would rub my eyes and feel something click in
my brain as if it had fallen into place again. But I was still weak from this
ailment and tired from long journeys and longer thoughts. I was filled with new
dreads, especially here, under the rain. Irresolution: it is wrong to deny it
for there is no denying its power.

There is something like death, being alone in a foreign
land. With determinaÂ­tion grappling, the loneliness and death-sense grip
harder. So I felt that I was borrowing from everything around me.

It is a custom for some of us to think and yet I turn
against that custom. It is better to live, simply as simple people live. I
wanted to live without the paper-world, to shun its distortions, escape its
death head, the charnel house of yesterÂ­day.

As I stood on that tongue of land, I heard the slobber of
the sea: I heard old men whisper: I heard old passions. My blood was young and
yet I could not get away. The porches of my ears wanted friendship, I, the kind
hand, the kinder mouth.

âIf you were here there would be reason enough. Without you,
there is no more than walls and sky and food. To be sure, I eat. To be sure, I
move about. You understand what I mean. I find that there is so much in life
that never gets said. When I am with you I am unable to say it...old plaint. I
try to convey with my presenceâthat is help. You, too, have this desire, and
have expressed it. When we were in bed, mating, there was a beauty in that
union that sufÂ­ficed...until tomorrow. Then, caught up in time, I sensed the
old longing, to share the unshareable, to reach the unreachable. Here, in this
cold room, I am trying to make life a little more livable, for you, for me.â

So I wrote her.

Stratford

Years Ago

At Oxford, it is pleasant to recall, I stopped at Duvenantâs
inn frequently, the rooms and meals much to my taste. Madame Duvenant, dressing
like someone from an Inigo Jonesâ masque, her rosy sex refreshing, greeted me
with a favorÂ­able eye. Veal, shoulder of mutton, rabbit, green
fish...gingerbread...strawÂ­berÂ­ries...claret: she knew my favorites, sharing my
meals and bed. When I arrived, tired by travel, she had someone look after me,
prepare my meal; then, we enÂ­joyed each otherâs company in the dining room she
kept for private use. A LonÂ­doner and play-goer, she fixed her lusty eyes on
me, hand on my arm, and made me feel I had never been away. She asked no
promises, required no letter-writing, no payment. âItâs late. Will, shall we go
up to bed?â Why are there so few generous women?

Henley Street

July 13, 1615

Iâd like one more ferry trip across the Thames, in the
morning, the water dark, Sly at the oars, telling me about the latest girl, of
the girls he has ferried, girls he wanted to love but could never love, old,
old Sly.

âThereâs one, Will, you just canât beat. Sheâs about this
tall, tiny around the waist, and she makes you know, before you know it, that
she can be had for very little, very sweetly done too, thatâs the game of
it...thatâs the game of her, that little one, Portia, they call her. Portia,
the one with grey eyes and small mouth. When she stands up beside me in the
boat to pay her fare, I groan. Itâs terrible being old, Will, when you canât do
it any more. And I want to do it to her, to be young again. That Portia, she
comes mostly in the evenings, I guess you know why. But sheâs not always alone,
but when sheâs alone, we talk. That she, she is little around the waist but has
melon breasts, the kind, you know how they are. I will give you her address, if
you want. Shillings, now Will! But sheâs not one youâll forget, I warn ye. That
mouth of hers and them eyes of hers. Faggots for her, thatâs it, Will, faggots
for men who see her...â

The boat shifts, Slyâs oars are cracked, his old face crisped
from the sunny crossings, the winds and fogs. Heâs been boatman for forty-odd
years, he says. He has worn out a dozen boats, which he builds himself, to make
them stout enough. Sun on his boat, the water dark...

Iâd like to cross once more with him, though heâs been dead
a long time, cross with other boats around, small boats and schooners, some
with sails unÂ­furled, seaward bound.

St. Swithinâs Day

If I knew where I was going to die I wouldnât go near the
place.

Stratford

July 20, 1615

Today, warm sun and silence were mine and pain alleviated: I
hoped for reÂ­covery, hoped to write again, hoped that my memory might outlive
death half a year; so shall I progress, ant-wise, day by day: ants, as you
creep over the woodÂ­work, stumble against the grain, think of me and the words
I summon: convicÂ­tion me to another Rosalind: the Touchstone will unblacken and
reveal pure, pure gold: alchemy of ruffians and angels:

Tongues Iâll hang on every tree

For the souls of friend and friend...

The sword in my chimney corner has not been unsheathed for
years: when I bought it I thought I had the keenest blade in London, sharper
than my rapier: when I carried it I liked to give it a flick now and then, to
catch the eye of a woman: I kept it polished: it saved my life in a street
fracas: Hamnet liked it: he used to shoulder it and parade about: I thought it
would keep me young forever: I thought it would cut across time, loosen
parchment and paper, let flood a bevy of immortal words above a sea of faces...

...for Thomas Combe.

The
Roebuck
on the
Atlantic, bucking water,

sailors topmast, Raleigh in his cabin,

one eye on the compass, another on a manuscript:

Books line the walls; a monkey chitters:

the
Roebuck
pitches:

Raleighâs jewels flash on his hands:

âMermaid,â yells a bow sailor.

Henley Street

July 24, 1615

I

Â had thirty-five days at sea with
Raleigh:

How he commands, respected by his seamen, each crewman called
by name. There is adequate leisure aboard his frigate. I never saw anything
done âon the doubleâ as aboard an Essex ship where the captaincy seemed
insecure.

On board the
Roebuck
I kept at my writing, lolling
and writing on deck or passing hours in his cabin where I gave up to his booked
walls: volumes in French, English, Italian, Greek, manuscripts in Latin and
Hebrew, his literary world broader than mine.

In his cabin, under his table lantern during
bad weather, during squalls, I wrote an act and then, at Raleighâs urgÂ­ing,
read it aloud. Feet propped on a mother-of-pearl chest, he listened gravely,
smoking his clay pipe, brandy in reach, his comments as mellow as his drink,
Oxford accent to my liking.

Ere we were ten days old at sea I had written several
scenesâwriting in the sun and spray, sitting on coils of rope, a gun lashed in
front of me, gulls mewing.

âMermaid...mermaid,â a sailor yelled aloft, and we scuttled
to the starboard rail, to see something break water and then submerge, its
pearly back toward us.

She swam and dove, flipping in and out of swells, the
bubbles foaming around her, making off at a 40 degree angle from our stern,
pearl or green grey, though I never saw her distinctly.

The excited sailor who had spotted her claimed that he had seen
her face... âsuch a beautiful face!â

Raleigh appeared.

âTheyâre deep swimmers,â he said, as we leaned far over,
hoping she might reappear. âSheâll likely stay down a long time. Must have
powerful lungs, those mermaids.â

He told of other mermaids: he had heard one call through fog
and mist on the Orinoco river; he had seen one off the Cape, near a small
island; he said that seeing a mermaid spells luck.

He went on talking of a trip upriver, jungle river, heat,
crocodiles, green birds, monkeys with beards, butterflies, solid white
butterflies, bigger than your hands: his descriptions sent my brain going: I
too was the Queenâs favorite, Shepherd of the Ocean, sailing a
Golden

Hind:

I would find El Dorado in Manoa.

His
accent sometimes thickened to a brogue and it was difficult to follow. Talking
of his travels, his eyes grew nervous, searching, searching, seeing inside,
greying: his arms gestured.

We leaned against the taffrail, as the ship heeled under a
wind, white caps racing after.

His
Roebuck
is splendid, new, well-equipped, faster
than others of design. He and his navy draughtsmen spent months on her, and she
cost him a fortune.

On this run we fired new cannon, firing them to test their
recoil, trying a deÂ­vice designed by his chief gunner: for Mr. Ames the firing
took place after dawn, when the ocean was smooth; I was wakened five or six
mornings; the great ship rolled in protest and rigging and beams creaked. One
morning I was on deck to witness the testing.

Legs spread, soap on him, he rode the swells, while a sailor
threw water over him, a sexful man, proud, and that same pride was at dinner in
his cabin while being served among his officers and it was there while he read
to me at the same table, eatables cleared, read me from the Greek poets, Pindarâs
ode on boxing, Simonides and his Perseus imprisoned in a chest at sea,
Anakreon: reading the Greek and then translating as if it were his tongues.

It seemed to me he might be fit to govern the new world...a
great, wise coloÂ­nist...

On our trip we visited Madeira Island, disembarking at noon,
the cambers keeling us into warm, shallow water, the weather perfect. I had a
carcanet that I was determined to give a girl, in exchange. The priest, in the
town, was very deÂ­termined to detain me: to please him, I had to see the hairs
of the Virgin, treasÂ­ured in a box: the coil of hair kept the convent free of
famine, he insisted: with his gigantic paunch I felt he might cause a famine of
his own: he had a tree-filled, bird-filled cage he wanted me to see, strung
with brass wires, where hundreds of birds lived. Negro girls, naked except for
the cloth pad underneath the calabash shells they carried on their heads,
wandered past the cage to see the birds, and found me most amusing. Their
smooth, dark features, slick jet hair, round waists and small breasts were
delightful. The priest had to leaveâcalled by the convent bell. I gave the
youngest my carcanet: the bushes slid about us, our hands toÂ­gether, the leaves
cool, the cool stream cool beside us, giving us water in our hands: birds in
the aviary whistled and sang, while she fondled the carcanet and lay with me: I
had never had anyone so young, accomplished, kindly, wooing, mouth tasting of
fruit: she peeled fruit taken from a bush and we ate together: she filled her
calabash at the stream and left me, lying, dreaming of her smiles and stroking
hands...

Stay illusion.

I liked sprawling in my bunk, the ocean light illuminating
the ceiling, a book or two beside me.

From above came the pad-pad of barefoot sailors, shift of
rigging and cordÂ­age, yaw of boom, sough of wind and flap of canvas; from below
came the gurÂ­gle of seas and jab of crested rollers that sometimes held the
ship suspended for a moment and then permitted her to careen as she drove down
inclines steep enough to shake the reaches of the sails.

When I dozed I felt the vastness, ringed vastness, and I was
monarch through nearly closed lids: I was ruler of my inconsistencies: I
dreamed an island, chained by surf and reef, where life was incredibly carefree,
a warmth of flowers, fruitâwomen.

At night, in the bunk, oil lamp swinging, I imagined the
uncharted waters beÂ­neath us, porpoise and whale, creatures that pursued us as
we floated across a valley, across a hill where coral studded the top: I saw
monsters pass and re-pass, dark blue, grey, orange, fins fluted like fans close
to our keel. Streamers of kelp and seaweed tangled crab and shark and I fell
asleep, my play forgotten, the lamp burning, burning, burning...

Screaming, a seaman plunged from our topgallant, to die on
deck while we were outrunning a storm.

Raleigh had his body wrapped in canvas and tossed overboard.
No ceremony. Giant, wind-wracked combers.

âDo you know his name? Is there any record?â I asked.

âTimothy Parkes.â

âWhere was he from?â

âDover. He was wanted there for murdering two women.â

âWas he a good seaman?â

âNo. And he was eaten up with scurvy.â

And Raleighâs face said: âWhat kind of ship can an officer
command sailored by rogues?â But he was all man: I saw him, in his canvas sack,
as all men, falÂ­ling...falling.

There was never another voyage for me after Raleighâs...nor
was there ever another Sir Walter. I should have been his champion. He needed
me to fight for him. I have often shut my eyes and seen his books and sensed
the cradling lull of his ship and felt the grace and power of him standing
beside me: books, beams, a pointed beard, a swinging lamp, smell of oakum and
ocean.

To think that I witnessed his trial and made no attempt to defend
him...to think that I saw him in prison...to think...cold venison! Cry your
mercy!

Henley Street

July 28, 1615

At the Mermaid Tavern, Raleigh laughed over his ale, his
lanky body screwed on a rickety chair, the wind and rain howling, people coming
and going, their clothes soggy, the wind gusting inside with each arrival. Most
newcomers made for the fireplace, stamping and shaking out their coats; boots
and leggings steamed.

Grinning, Raleigh lit his pipe, a dozen men around our
table, elbowing Ben Jonson and me.

âCome on, Ben, smoke another, and you, too, Will.â

Raleighâs coat was ripped, where a sword or cutlass had
slashed; he pushed a tobacco pouch and pipe toward me.

âIâll drink with youâbut not smoke,â I said.

âTry again. Youâll learn to like it.â

âYou experiment,â I said. âOnce was enough.â

âBut Iâm not experimenting. Iâve smoked on the long watches.
It settles the blood and calms the mind. The Indians...â

âWe know about the Indians,â Jonson said. âJust remember,
weâre not IndiÂ­ans!â

âYou might better be! Here, lad, bring us more ale! Letâs
drink!â

âHereâs to your return! Londonâs London with you around.â

âHave you seen my new play?â

âWhat play is it?â

â
The Winterâs Tale
,â I said.

âWhatâa
chilly play on top of this miserable weather! Why a month ago I was basking in
the sun...you and your plays! Is this Denmark and another HamÂ­let? Tell me,
Will, was Hamlet named for your sonâare those lines in his honor?â

Jonson interrupted and answered for me:

âWhen my boy died I wrote something for him. I was in prison
then and the jailer grabbed my manuscript and spat on it. Bah, thatâs the kind
of crassness that shakes you. Iâve forfeited goods in payment of my stupidities
but I havenât forÂ­feited my hatred of injustice! Itâs another kind of injustice
when a boy, a stripling, dies. Will made Hamnet into
Hamlet,
an outcry
against this world.â

He drank his ale and I saw him examine his thumb, where they
had branded it when he was in prison; he nodded to himself; I suppose his
thoughts were of his boy, a victim of the plague...

Jonson eats poorly. Prison treatment has hurt him. His hair
is greying, parÂ­ticularly on one side, sweeping down, showing when he talks
with gusto. Teeth are missing. Today he wears a suit of black wool, his cuffs
clean, his collar clean. He hardly seems one of us.

Raleighâs sword scrapes against the table as he leans
forward, talking of his voyages. His is a perpetual struggle with storms and
mutinies and his flashing eyes convey a courage one has to take into account.
He has sent the idlers packÂ­ing and smokes with his pipe in the bowl of his
palm, its brown the color of his hands, the five or six rings on his fingers
blazing: opals and rubies, I am told.

I am also told that if he sold the jewels he wears he could
pay for the conÂ­struction of a ship-of-the-line.

Henley Street

July 30, 1615

I came across several old letters this morning. Raleighâs is
hard to decipher:

Portsmouth

March 9, 1608

Will Shakespearâ

We have taken an old carrack, the
Madre
de Dios
, and spoils clutter her deck as we lie at anchor in Portsmouth Bay,
spoils, things the Queen would grow sullen over, wanting them. Some of them
bloody and soaked with spray, they have a cheapness about them, a liarâs eye.
You and Ben would know how to laugh and knock them about. Hereâs a green gem in
a brooch a negro queen must have worn, its horseâs eye staring through a slash
of sail canvas. Hereâs a rope of skulls carved in brownish ivory; hereâs a
tiara ornamented with pale yellow gems I canât idenÂ­tify...a pile of brass
bracelets alongside a smashed cutlass. As for me, Iâll take the wind in the
rigging and a clear landfall.

How are your plays going this season?
Sometimes, when a sea rages, Macbeth howls in my ear, Othello lifts his hand as
stars dive below the washed horizon.

Shun the Queenâs condemnations. It is
usually her freeÂ­domâseldom ours. Stay clean!

But if I could write like you I would
try to destroy political chicanery, though meddling with the Crown may spell my
doom.

Well, I will make London late next
month, and see you at the Tavern.

Raleighâs pen dug into the paper, and the signature has
almost disappeared for lack of ink.

The Tower

Will Shakespearâ

When I scribbled verses on a window,
our Queen was pleased. I did not knowâmy crystal would not divulge that I would
become a chemist in the Tower, alchemist of solitude. I thought the compass
mine, shrewdly boxed...

April 9, 1593

Willâ

For years I have been planning an
expedition up the OriÂ­noco, to locate a gold mine. The fabled mine is near
Spanish settlements and these may present hazards to any English force. A
Spaniard, a Captain Berrio, is entrenched there, along the River. The
expedition will tax my resources but I am deterÂ­mined for the sake of the
Crown: to carry out my plans I will require several shallow draft frigates and
several small boats; there are no accurate maps and the mine is in fever
jungle. CerÂ­tes a month or two will go into exploration, hacking this way and
that. The roguish crew of prison perverts will contribute their share of comÂ­plications,
no doubt of that, my friend. ConÂ­sole yourself that you will never know such an
experience as dealing with deckloads of cutthroats. To be a voyageur you must
condone scapegoats, assassins, rapists, thieves...but you know our maritime
history. I have been accused of bad voyÂ­ages...who has not made bad voyages who
dared voyages? If this expedition can be materialed the victualing will be a
matter of months. Wish me well...wish me Godâs speed.

I am contributing Â£3,000, and it
seemeth to me this Empire is reserved for Her Majesty and the Nation. I can
find the gold King of Cundinamarca:
el hombre dorado
. Who knows, as in
Sergas de EsplandiÃ¡n, we may reach the Island of California, inÂ­habited by
Amazon women with passionate hearts and great strength, where there is abundant
gold.

There were other letters in this vein, about his future. As
explorer he was to the manner born. Thou canst not be false to any manâhis
letters seemed to say.

The
Tower

Like our ship
Revenge
I am
surrounded by an armada of enemies, all my pikes splintered. In the beginning
of the fight I had a hundred for me; volleys, boardings, and enterings have
done their damage...this composition and exile are the dullest and longest in
the history of our Tower; the book I am writing is for Prince Frederick, a
slow, slow tacking about; yet you, who respect writing, realize the salvation.
Tell me, friend, that I will fare well with my
History of the World
...

It is still my error that I never assisted him: it was my
error to have shut my mind: there are many I could have helped as I went along.
But to pass by someÂ­one greatâthat is great misfortune.

I hear him telling about how he burned the town of San JosÃ©;
I hear him telling about the treachery of the Tarawa Indians; his terrible
thirst when his ship ran out of water at sea; he is boarding a Spanish frigate,
raiding for guns...

âSblood, the Spanish are a cruel lot, chaining the caciques,
scorching their naked bodies with hot bacon, beating them, starving them,
decapitating them...

The
Tower

Write to me, lad, before thoughtâs
relicts utterly obsess me and the ghouls remove me in their stinking chains. I
have seen and heard them, ghouls and ghosts of this town and tower, seen and
heard them cringe and bully, nightlong. Stones multiply their menace. Thereâs
an old seadog from Dublin crumpled in a cell here, a grumbling bag: he claims
he used to sail with me; by his own confession he is the murderer of his
crippled father. He is to be freed in the Spring. Freed? Freeâare we ever free,
my lad? When I sniff the brined air I am hard put not to cast myself off the
TowerâI still hope to see the sails double-reefed and porpoises rising off the
bow...

Later he wrote breadâbreadâbread. âTime drives the flocks,â
he said: âI am reading the
Amoretti
... have you read Spenser recently?

â
None can call again the passed time
,â he wrote. I
repeated those seven words. I repeat his bread...bread...bread...it is not
bread we want. I did not care. Who cares now?

Henley Street

August 1, â15

What times we had, Raleigh, Marlowe, Jonson, and I, Marlowe
and his wit, Raleigh and his tales of the sea, Jonson and his satirical
pomposities in Latin or Greek. Then, then...Marloweâs murder crept through our
veins and left us dumb or feverish, our very gatherings viewed with
disapproval.

Hail
drubbed our windows, the chill of complicity and duplicity spread over cobbles,
the clatter of horsesâ hooves meant torture on the spit of tomorrow: these were
hitched to our beads of sweat.

We had seen our share of slings and arrows. Was it important
who killed Marlowe? We werenât sure. All threads of evidence were thin threads!
We praised Marlowe, shuffled through our worn pockets to bury himâRaleigh at
sea now. We excused, blamed, made our exodus.

Ann
said, with scorn:

âItâs the company you keep! London! Always London!â

As if our plays could be produced in Stratford!

âItâs men who blaspheme God who find the gutter! Listen to
what people say about Raleigh! Heâll have a bad end!â So they prophesied over
sour beer.

Chris Marlowe was squat, dark, tousle-headed, many-freckled,
with wretched teeth and poor eyes. He weighed far too much for a small manâhis
clothes were sacks at timesâhis body lost inside for all its bulk. He had
character and a voice that conveyed characterâhis speech superior to many
actors. He could memoÂ­rize lines quickly, and speak them sincerely,
interpreting with sound thinking behind them. When nervous he picked his teeth
and jogged his foot, when writÂ­ing or talking, not on the stage. He slumped in
his chair habitually, as if he had been on his feet for days. When he spoke,
there was Marlowe, bringing you to attention, his eyes serious, the warmth of
him coming to you, a piece of curÂ­rency.

Stratford

Marlowe and I worked throughout the night, troubled by reeky
candles, rain and chill. He kept us grinding by saying weâd soon see the sun
cross the roof tops.

The sun...where was it?

Our playwriting went badly as we worked at rephrasing,
changing, cutting, adding. I would write a scene and he would recompose it, or
he would start out and then I would revise. We had to have our three acts
finished by noon, for our players.

Red-eyed, Marlowe sipped ale, his quill chronicling,
squeaking, or head on his arms, he snatched a fragment of sleep.

Rain over the house, over the mansard, clicking against the
glass, sounding colder and colder, dampening our spirits and our paper, making
my knees and ankles ache...rain.

I wanted to toss myself on the cot and smother myself with
blankets and call it a day. Marlowe said weâd soon see the dawn. Godâs bodkins!

In that four-square room, cluttered with Greek and Roman
masks, posters, books, and dirt, we wrote
Titus
over and over. When the
manuscripts were ready for the theatre even the rain sounded tired.

In those days, for economyâs sake, we often cut each otherâs
hair, sitting in the doorway or on the steps, when the weather was good. Draped
in sheet or towel, I sat on a chair while Marlowe snipped. Scissors and comb
usually put him in a whistling mood. Gently puffing a tune, he scissored
awayâthe slowest barÂ­ber in London. He liked to complain about the color of my
hair, saying he wished it was as black as Othelloâs so he could see it easily.

âIâve cut so many bad lines from your plays this job should
be easy.â

Chris was better at barbering than I. He said I didnât keep
my mind on my work.

âIf I had the money, Iâd certainly excuse you. Come on, no
more time out for jotting down lines. Letâs get through this mess. Presently,
it will be dark. I never trust you by candlelight.â

In separate crimson frames:

Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, Ben Jonson, Shakespeare:

A mirage of Armada, sails rattling, guns roaring...

Â

At sea, Sir Francis tells yarn of brave seamanship:

a man stabs another in the eye with a dagger.

Â

Silence.

Stratford

August 5, 1615

S

pelling God backward gets dull after
a while: at the clandestine meetings where Raleigh, Greene, Marlowe, Drake,
Jonson and others crucified everyoneâs beliefs, they gradually dulled their arÂ­rows,
for me: I thought: Lucifer can smell too strongly of sulfur too often. âAm I
not a mighty man who bears a hundred souls on his back!ââtalk like this was to
little purpose, to my way of thinking. How much saner to keep convictions to
oneâs self: Yet some, surly as a butcherâs dog, paraded their beliefs. Gulled,
I never went too often: the suite, in the Dukeâs Thames house, had about it an
air of trouble brewing, trickery, and the abrupt appearance of men-at-arms. The
talkers walked or sat about, under brilliant chandeliers, shadÂ­owing their
shadows on the polished floors, starched cuffs thrown back over satin sofas.
Whiffs of cologne and perfume over-topped the whiff of garret. Rapiers
shimmered. The Queen, if she chose, could do away with each of us: a nod of her
wig. I seriously suspected all their pattery, branding it half-hearted
conspiracy, mistrust and defamation. The passage of time has confirmed, not
denied my feelings: perspective has brought out the folly of guffawings at
creeds.

St. Grouseâs Day

1615

For weeks, after Marloweâs murder, I avoided the Mermaid Tavern.
When a courtier from the Queenâs court came to me at my apartment and
suggested, with coughs behind his perfumed handkerchief, that I leave London
for a while, I agreed... I was rather unaccustomed to such visits!

Meeting Jonson, as I left the city, sensing evasion on his
part, I felt ill at ease, suspicion stepping in. Later, he visited me at
Stratford, brief visits, but he was aware of my doubts; my reserve must have
told him.

Jonson said:

âThe Queen has been spying...last week your London apartment
was searched...if youâre smart, stay away...sheâs making up her mind...â

I turned that over.

What could I pin on the Queen? What could she pin on me?
Which play? A broadside? A pamphlet? With Jonson back in London I sent out
feelers. When I was convinced that he was loyal I would remember that he had
killed two men. Queen? Pawn? Right? Wrong?

September first

1615

Months after Marloweâs murder, I learned that the Queen had
had hirelings kill him. I confided in Raleigh as we stood on a pier, near one
of his frigates...the Thames wind whipping our clothes.

How well I recall his expression when I told him. Mouth
tense, eyes afire, he grabbed at the hilt of his sword and exclaimed:

âI command nine ships. How many cutthroats do you think I
have at my beck and call? In a fortnight, Marloweâs murderers will be dead. Our
Queen will know that she has been out-maneuvered, that there are plotters
keener than she. She killed Marlowe because he was too rabid an atheist...â

Those were vain words on Raleighâs part: he did nothing: I
did nothing. How gutter-cheap we are in times of stress, how obliterative,
given to expediency, wedded to her and safety!

Next Day

Come live with me and be my love,

And we will all the pleasures prove

That hills and valleys, dales and fields

Woods or steepy mountain yields...

And I will make thee a bed of roses

And a thousand fragrant posies...

Chris never knew what it was to have a bed of roses, not
even for a fortnight.

He might have gone on to splendid heights. His verses mean
much to me. I liked him for his clowning, his patience, his kind words, his
persuasive pen. Gloverâs son and shoemakerâs boyâwe had many a boisterous time.
Of his plays I think best of
Tambourlaine
and
Faustus.

From jigging veins of riming mother wits

And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay

Weâll lead you to the stately tent of war...

As we collaborated on our plays, he was constantly fighting
debts, his misÂ­tress riding him hard. Our tankards full we worked in my place
or his. I shied away from his association with the School of Atheists, leaving
that to him and Raleigh.

No writer could have had a better guide for
Titus,

Henry

and
Richard.
M__ had learned to smoke and like R__ had to putter with
tobacco, pipe and flint.

One afternoon he used a scrap of poetry to light his pipe.
Letting the paper burn and then char on the floor, he said:

âThat was a poem well used.â

Was it another âShepherdâs Songâ?

I should have collected his works and seen them published.
Now I could not track down his pieces. Ah, the shoulds of life...

This is the anniversary of his death, another churlish
scruff of day with wretched rain...the rain it raineth every day...true, boy,
come bring us to this hovel...the tyranny of the world is too rough at
times...give me your hand.

Jonson received a letter from Ellen, Ellen in Edinburgh,
writing at home, exÂ­pressing her friendly concern for me:

âWill has written me but I am worried. Can you look after
him?â She was afraid after Marloweâs death. âWill you write and reassure me?â
she asked. âEdÂ­inburgh is far... Iâm sick with a cold...so much rain.â

And it was raining as Jonson read me her letter, in his
apartment. I opened a book of his and leafed through it, standing by his
window, the rain leaded on the pages, long, grey, thin lines, tracing problems
that threatened us, a bond tying in with her concern, lessening that distance
between us.

The wall felt damp to my shoulder and I smelled stale bread
and stale cheese on Jonsonâs desk.

âWhat came between us?â I asked.

âAre you talking to me...or to her?â

âTo you.â

âBad luck...the thing that comes between most lovers.â

âAnd what do I do to change it?â

âYou know Londonâs soothsayers...theyâre ready to help you.
Pay them.â

âHow much?â

âPay...oh, with your life, your work. Pay and sheâs yours.â

âItâs stupid to talk like that.â

âItâs stupid to fall in love. Just fuck and go.â

Stratford

September 9, 1615

When Raleigh was brought to trial by the Crown and condemned
to life imÂ­prisonment, I began a play, thinking to defend him, troubled by the
royal hatred leveled at him, for his loyalty to England was unquestionable.

His trial was pure sham.

SHEPHERD
OF THE OCEAN

Scene I: Courtroom, in winter

Raleigh: You claim me
guilty, but I am innocent. In no way, at no time, have I conspired against the
throne. At sea, I defended our country against all enemies. I supplied ships
for the Queen. In Virginia, my colony is dedicated to all that England stands
for. Sirs, I protest!

Judge: Damned you are,
damning our people with your stinking guilt. You have conspired! We have every
proof...thereâs not the slightest doubt of your perfidy! You defended Queen
Elizabeth against the Earl of Essex but he was the Kingâs friend, never his
adversary. You have every guilt upon you. You are grossly guilty of plotting
against our nation and our King. King James sees fit to sentence you...

Maybe the King had secret reasons for Raleighâs banishment
but I doubt it. Some call Sir Walter the âKing of Liars.â His letters from
prison no longer come and Tower over me, filling me with guilt.

Should I burn his letters: could there be family inÂ­volvement
at some unforeÂ­seen time? I should burn many thingsâmany memories!

Ocean Skimmer, you pilloried yourself. We were friends:
those were good days but not good enough to last. What lasts?

The oriel outlasts us! Its quarrels outlast ours!

September 11, 1615

In my mindâs eye we meet at the taproom of the Mermaidâs Tavern...

Raleigh: ...At sea, weeks away from port, alone on the deck,
rigging and sails creaking, Iâve felt it... Iâve felt it in the smash of waves
and moan of beams...felt it in the expanse of sky...that there must be a god.

Marlowe: Should be a god! Put it that way.

Raleigh: No...let it go as Iâve said it. As you ride at the
bow, as spray hurls on board, there are certain certainties, rebuffs of
personal fancy, declarations of a godhead.

Jonson: The Greek helmsman felt those same declarations, and
his god was Zeus.

Marlowe: I donât go for such thinking on my part, Sir
Walter. It shuts me inÂ­side a cage and the cage has a door with four heavy
bars: f-e-a-r.

Raleigh: You know that each country has had a godhead.

Marlowe: Each country has its diseases, debts...despots.

Shakespeare: Are you denying your âSchool of Nightâ?

Raleigh: Iâm not on trial here. I was speaking conÂ­fidentially,
no, intiÂ­mately...thatâs a better word. I was trying to share an emotion and I
ask you to respect it as an emotion.

Jonson: You ask for respect. God be at your table.
Everyoneâs highly reÂ­spected hereâeven the waiters. (Laughter)

Marlowe: Ah, shut up!

Shakespeare: We didnât come here to quarrel.

Raleigh: Maybe we can do better with politics...or is it too
hydra-headed toÂ­night? Letâs talk about Essex. Cautiously.

Marlowe: But why cautiously?

Shakespeare: Weâll do better trying something else, not so
risky. Supperâs ready. Here it comes.

Jonson: Pour the ale, boy.

Marlowe: Hugger-mugger, my cage lost its bars. The bird of
fear has flown ...hunger picked the lock.

Thatâs how I remember an evening at the Tavern, Raleigh in
his finest, wearÂ­ing green velvet cloak, red trousers, black boots, black hat,
sword; Jonson, MarÂ­lowe and me in our snuffbox suits, wearing our swords
because of recent street fracases.

The Tower of London...

A cracked stone stairway leads to an open door:

Inside, windowless, Raleigh sits at his prison desk,

with maps, letters, books around him.

He is writing; he coughs:

Frail, he seems to be listening:

An armed guard trudges by and looks in.

Stratford

September 15, 1615

I

n â10, sometime during the autumn I
think it was, I stopped outÂ­side Raleighâs prison, thinking to visit him: there
he was, at his deal table, books, globe, maps and papers piled about him. His
door was flung wide: his pen moved: perhaps he was writing his
History
.
Sun lay on the floor of his room. A wren sang. His hand stopped. I stepped forÂ­ward,
then faltered. His hands moved over the table: he leaned on his elbows now,
coughing. He had on a grubby red woolen cape, sleeves smudged with wax. He
coughed againâhis shoulders shaking.

He was the one who had dared the wild and secret lands,
who had sweated men and ships to reach a goal. Winds luned, storms crashed; yet
he had kept on. He had wanted to explore the world for himself, for mankind!
Books on board his ships, books in his brain: wind stirred parchment on his
table as I stood there and he read. What if he should turn and see me? What if
he should get up? Would he recognize me?

I thought: who are his friends? The thought cut me: the
Great Lucifer is forgotten. Look around you. The liar is captive, will die
behind these walls. They say he concocts an elixir, and gives it to his
friends. No, I was not included. He needed his elixir more than I.

His white head was dirty...where was his youth? No, he had
concocted hope. People said his rooms would be unÂ­guarded...so they were. But I
made no sound. The ugly Tower was still. What has happened to his Elizabeth: is
she memory?

I wanted to talk to him about Spenserâs
Faerie Queen
,
and say...Spenser...you know...no, Raleigh sailed to the Canaries, to Florida,
Manoa...Hispaniola...cloak-thrower...knight...names...and his map, a large
parchment, came out of the wall and stared at me, rebuking me:
cloak-thrower...patron...names...John White said that he admired him...John
White said...where was White now, now that heâs back from Roanoke?

Pushes hand through hair, coughs... I back away, wanting to
put the wall beÂ­tween us. I shuffled down a few steps, disgraced, down to the
street, cockÂ­roaches and rats scuttling, ivy blowing in the wind.

Let him finish his
History of the World
.

I had no right to disturb.

The blue cloak slips from Ellenâs shoulders and through the
stabbed hole I see moon, stars, and fog, each flecked with red. Fog soaks the
hole and then, then, thereâs the face of an attacker, scarred, piratical.
Something behind him fades into her face, so white. I see her smile her
dazzling loverâs smile and I hear her laughter and the sound of her bracelets.

In the funeral procession

a small black casket is accompanied by Ann, Shakespeare,

his daughter in black, and others.

A flower falls from the casket and Shakespeare

picks it up and puts it in his pocket:

A church bell tolls:

Blue cloak over a tombstone.

I

Â buried Hamnet, buried father,
buried myself... What is this death that eats our lives as if we were pieces of
bread on a dirt plate, sacrificed to whim and time? Our crosses top a hill, row
on row, a row for each generation, across fog hills, across sunny hills, ItalÂ­ian,
French, English, Scot.

Escape with me:

Now at the prow, now in the waist,

the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement:

sometimes Iâd divide and burn in many places,

on the topmast, the yards, the bowsprit...

Henley Street

September 23, 1615

Now, now thought is closer to death than love: I live in it,
longing for her, for intercourse, the ice of this winter-house aging me and the
wind, poor wind, scuttling nowhere, nowhere to go.

Go to the oriel, then.

Henley Street

September 24

God, the rain, the rain at its cobble-sop, common rain on
cobbles, rising out of them, climbing the ivy, moulding thatch, hurting places
of the mind, shivering our secrets, insinuating with lashes, coming again and
again, thieving.

The dropping of one drop can absorb a soul: its alchemy
traps a man: so, we, reduced, debased, encompassed, are carried to sea, to
finality, ourselves made useless, noiseless, like a million others.

I heard rain throughout the night, from lying down to
getting up, no sleep, only this endrenchment, intent on obliteration, transforming
life into a comedy of errors.

I was twenty-eight or so!

All morning I sawed wood for props; all afternoon I
practiced lines; all eveÂ­ning I rehearsed. My costume didnât fit: the crown was
badly torn. At four in the morning, there was no food for us. That was life at
the Globe, when I first tried London.

I estimate that I have earned less than a hundred pounds
from my thirty-seven plays. When I divide that by thirty years of work, I see
what it represents. At least I see that much.

Henley Street

1615

âSmall coals! Small coals!â

âHot peas!â

I wish I could hear those raucous London street hawkers! Iâd
like to see the Thames crowded with little boats. Iâd like to see the people
packed in front of St. Paulâs. Iâd like to be back at the Exchange, for the
armorers and booksellers and glovers. Iâd like to stare off-stage at a thousand
rapt faces.

I miss Burbage more than anyone. He and I worked
hand-in-glove for more than ten years, seeing each other almost every day. He
played Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and his was the finest Lear voice-transcending.
Lear was Burbage and Burbage was Lear. There were no weaknesses. Weaknesses?

I have mineâso many weaknesses.

Today I have been up and round but last week I was in bed
throughout the week. When I am up and about, I freeze. My sight fades. My heart
bangs. I must get to the composition of my will, the final act in my play...no
applause...no whistles...silence.

Burbage could take my lines and recite them for me, adding,
subtracting, modulating. If there must be rewriting I knew, through his skill,
what I must do to improve a scene.

What amusing letters he used to write home, when he was
traveling with the Company. He and Alleyn were as domesticated as tea.

âDear Jug,â he would address his wife. âDear Mouse,â Alleyn
wrote his.

âDear Jug, let my orange-tawny stockings be dyed a good
black, against my coming home in the winter,â Alleyn wrote.

He wanted his wife to sow spinach in his parsley bed at the
proper season.

â...Sweet Jug, farewell, till All Hallowâs tide, and brook
our long journey with patience.â

We brooked many a tedious journey with patience.

Gargoyles and ghosts: they are always a part of pain. Here
is a prescription: pulverize a gargoyle in a deep mortar, shred one carefully,
mix with ample wheat and milk, add salt, bake two hours, serve piping hot. Add
surfeit of prunes, against the inevitable her.

Globe Theatre:

Elegant and seedy theatregoers.

Evening â late

W

e players, playing in the provinces,
walked all day to reach our destination, our horse cart lumbering behind us,
stacked with costumes and gear. Sun blazed. Rains soaked. Chewets folÂ­lowed us.
We walked from inn to inn, town to town. At two oâclock we played
Tambourlaine,

and the soft verse of Marlowe. Then, packed again, we walked until another two
oâclock, somewhere along the way. Our comÂ­radeship on the road, sleeping in the
same rooms, sleeping on the floor as often as not, eating at the same
tableâthose were our bonds! Burbage, Alleyn, Kempe... I could name a dozen.
Week by week, we played our plays, our
Lord

Chamberlainâs

Men,

banished by edict and plague, protected from jail by contract, cheered by the
Puritans! We worried over money, badgered, confronted, schemed. We placated the
constabulary and loved the
annuncios
âthe children!

Sometimes we sickened of one another and quarreled, our
masculinity disÂ­tressing us:
men and
boys,
men and boys
âthat
was our disease! What women would have meant to us, in London especially, where
the theatre was spoiled. What it would have meant to have a girl strut across
the boards and smile a smutty smile. Chafing would have disappeared.

I longed to see Desdemona as a girl would play her; I wanted
to see CleoÂ­patra acted by a woman, Lady Macbeth by a skilled playerânot
castrated boys, our sexless wire-sounding temperamentalists.

Who wants boys primping, boys in womenâs hats, giggling over
skirts and bows? Scratching fleas in baboon areas? Crying for their mamas?

Our groundlings wanted women to go to bed with.

Lords, ladies, and soldiery wanted women.

Everyone is sick of boys!

Soldiers, in their half-armor, jeer at us!

It is afternoonâwarm and sunny!

Women, wearing eye masks, are chatting and taking seats at
the Globe. Hawkers, bright yellow bands around their waists, are selling books
and cakes and ale, passing among the theatre crowd. Dandies are getting settled
in an area close to the stage. Swords clatter as soldiers find seats; a captain
bows to a Jesuit priest. Someone strums a zither and croaks a bawdy ballad.
Workers shove their way past the gate, afraid to miss a word of the beginning.

Popping open the little door of the hut atop the theatre, a
trumpeter blows shrill blasts; the play is about to start:
Hamlet,

Prince
of Denmark.

Henley Street

Sunday afternoon

Theatrical voicesâcommanding, secretive, beseeching,
vituperativeâare not voices I want to recall. I prefer the normal and kindly,
an intimate Scot voice, a manâs educated speech, someone mouthing thoughtfully,
an older person whose words show profound mellowing.

Annâs voice was once full of witchery, stealing my guts and
senses, leaving me hot. Marloweâs was low and persuasive. Queen Elizabethâs
crisp. Raleighâs burly. Hamnetâs birdlike. Ellenâs warm.

Not the regal! Not dotards and thieves, but a voice
combining generosity, ease, and hope: is the voice I invent when insomnia takes
me: for a moment it speaks out of the past.

I never enjoyed the childrenâs theatreâalways wondering how
they produced even one creditable play a season since they whipped their boys
to force them to learn their parts. Clifton, I recall, was kidnapped and
compelled to act. They whaled him, fed him badly, did sexual malice to make him
performâhardly the way to create a star. Cliftonâs father had to appeal to the
authorities for his boyâs release. I went to see him, at his home, and the
tales he told me matched his tear-streaked face. His little hands trembled and
his mother had to reassure him he wouldnât be kidnapped again.

Whippings, threats, naggingâthey were the stuff that kept
the childrenâs theatre alive in London, while the council shrugged and patrons
furnished subsiÂ­dies for these odious and grossly amateurish entertainments. I
talked and fought. Marlowe talked and fought. Alleyn and Jonson used their
influence. The cruelty continued.

London was a place of whippings: the public whipping of
offenders through the city streets and post whippings repelled... Jim was one
of those I saw...and Hardyâs body hanging naked in chains...

Stratford-on-Avon

Wednesday

Damn them in Luddington and Walton, the groundlings who
pelted us with fruit and eggs, those smelly coxcombs! That day in Luddington
was blazing: the sweat ran down me as I stood on stage: then, the first egg
struck, then a rotten orange: I waited, hoping. The play went on, drowned by
laughter, and then, as if by prearrangement, a barrage of fruit and eggs hit
us: our tragedy was hounded off the boards.

Walton had a couple of hecklers who were supported by the
audience and broke up our play: we got eggs from many Waltonites: putrid,
smelling a dozen feet away, saved, undoubtedly for our arrival: it was two days
before we could play again since we had to wash and press our clothes. What a
jangling of nerves that bred.

Why not give up the acting and the writing? Why not go back
to Stratford and work with father? Why let these slovenly cruds, these barnyard
bastards ruin my life? Days later, humor came slanting through. When we were
well-reÂ­ceived and the money tinkled we forgot; we called ourselves ninnies and
threatened to arm ourselves with eggs for the next affront. We found goodness
and warmth in lines well-delivered. We saw our comradeship, our triumph over
slogging days: there was magic flowing through our blood: that fulsomeness,
that nothing could tarnish or remove.

Globe Theatre is on fire...bucket brigades,

smoke around men with pails,

smoke around boys with pails,

smoke in trees, smoke in the rain:

Jonson talking and gesturing to Shakespeare:

Burbage screaming orders...

A wall topples...

Inside the conflagration

books and manuscripts burning.

J

onson and I watched the Globe burnâthe afternoon cold, with
rain falling. People crowded around; there was mud and water underfoot.

âSomeone
must have set our theatre on fire, Will! Jesus, how it burns!â Jonson cried.

âNo. I was inside. I saw the thatch start burning.â

âWasnât there anything you could do to stop the blaze?â

âWe tried! We got ladders and buckets!â

âLord, look, now! A wallâs toppling. The hutâs gone. Why it
has fallen off. Will, our props are afire. Our scripts! The flames are
roaring...â

âStand back!â

âStand back or get burned!â

âHow long has it been burning?â

âMaybe an hour...â

The flames seemed to meet in a giant peak, a peak that had
at the top a great tree of smoke. It was raining harder now; the crowd had
moved back.

God, wasnât it enough to have to fight the plague? One month
our doors were closed, next month we were open, next month we were shut again.
That was bad enough, but no theatre meant no chance.

âKemp is sick...the Globe is gone,â I said.

âLetâs go and get drunk!â Jonson said.

Later, Burbage told me it was a cannon, fired during my own
play, that set fire to the Globe. We met in the street. Yanking his beard,
swearing, he spat on the cobbles, and turned away.

Henley Street

1615 All Soulsâ Day

Pain is gross companion, inducing lecherous thoughts,
destroying temperÂ­ance, stability, mercy, courage, fortitude. Craving release,
I fought all day to reÂ­member better times. At night, with candles lit,
blankets around me, I find ease... I remember...

I am in a lemon grove, naked stone pillars stabbing out of
the tops of the trees, Greek pilasters by the sea. We are eating on a terrace
overlooking the waÂ­ter, a lazy meal, with old wine. The moon rises, drunkenly,
fat, water-distorted, closing in on us, in rhythm to the waves below. We hold
hands. The moon spells urgency, urging us to the grove, where we lie side by
side.

âEllen...Ellen...â

The lemons are yellowish in the moonlight: there is
something stage-like about their motionlessness: it is rather as though we were
in a velvet box, facing the sea. Stars have something to do with the fragrance
drifting about us, the only movement apart from the waves and rising moon. I
suggest we go down to the beach, so inviting. Ellen says no and I forget
everything but her fragrance and the fragrance of the lemons, her whispers, her
kisses.

That Scot profile, so chiseled, that bluecap voice, so warm,
that hair of hers, softer than Julietâs... A great rock, a sea boulder, surrounded
by waves, glows in the moonlight...her skin is whitened: a ringlet glows on her
neck.

Marlowe, Jonson, Raleigh, Spenser have had their days in
jail; I have had mineâthose county sties where pigs and dust ate my manuscripts
and foetid odors ate my skull, jailed by the local thief who deemed each man a thief
who thought:

If all the world and love were young...

But Raleigh it never was except in fancy and during the dead
reckoning on paper: that is why the five of us stumbled backward in time,
learning and escapÂ­ing simultaneously.

We used to play chess, many of us, pawns, varlets, kings,
knights, evenings, one play bastinadoed on another, Caesar against Titus,
Hamlet against Lear, Portia against Cleopatraâalways a gamble, along the
stinking alleys, along the nocturnal slugtide Thames, along the turtle sea:
stonehenge of concupiscence, murder vs. philandering, octogenarian vs. boy, sex
vs. cuirass, check vs. cul-de-sac.

Everyman knows the exquisite desire for a woman; he also
knows the ravenÂ­ing need...when there is no woman.

With Ann opposite me at supper table, I peered outside at
the leaves, beyond the oriel, and denounced myself as I ate, enumerated my
festering faults. I tasted little, wishing for sensible words and tranquil
mind. But there was no shutting the door.

âEat, Will,â she said, and I nodded, but dared not glance at
her, to find the stranger and myself. I resented her as if her infidelities
were yesterdayâs, as if my side of life could be ruled out, as if we were
young...

Patience has not helped. Only forgiveness can.

Leaves drop from the trees and the kettle bubbles and we
feed ourselves, grieving. Our shields are in place but the lances were broken
years ago. Our viÂ­sors are down, our plumes awry. Our horses have been killed
in the field. WithÂ­out pennons, we move our gauntleted hands in rusty beÂ­wilderment,
slow-gaited with many, many abysmal hungers.

Henley Street â â15

I kept a stray in my London apartment: after feeding him
while on one of my strolls along the Thames I could not shake him: Pericles had
a soothsayerâs mug dripping with ignominious grey whiskers, a privateerâs
baleful eye, a silver-grey hide, a black tail, three white feet, a black-booted
foot, and a bark like a tin pot clipping the pavement. When it came to food,
Pericles was greedier than Shylock for a pound; piercing me with piratical
eyes, he sat up, wagged for pity, then slumped in grief, moaning better than
any stage madonna. Pericles and Jonson became the best of friends: pieces of
bread or cheese from Benâs pocket orÂ­dained him lord and master. Along the
Thames, Pericles flew after every bird, yapping incessantly; it seemed to me he
could run all day and never tire. When left to guard the apartment, he kept to
a mat inside the door, gradually sheathing it with a coat of silver-grey hair.

Shakespeare and Ashley meshed in fog:

They duel in a fog meadow.

Fog blows away before Julius Caesarâs ruined castle

among rocks and weeds.

Shakespeareâs dog tangles with Ashley,

caroms against Shakespeare:

Shakespeare falls.

November 7, 1615

F

og sopped the grass and weeds
when I fought my duel, by Caesarâs castle. I could barely make out Jonson,
Pericles, and friends, among the pines and bush below the castle ruins.
Phantasma? I asked myself.

Ashley and I had quarreled over money: as one of the Kingâs
Men he had cheated me roundly; now he faced me, privateer, poet, rich manâs bastard
who would defy immortal Caesar: on twelve-foot legs, bearded, cloak over
shoulder, rapier in hand, fog creaking against him, he closed in. On stage I
had dueled many times; today I must put fakery to test.

As Ashley and I fought I heard Pericles barking and heard
voices, saw AshÂ­leyâs men and my own, now in the fog, now out of it, shifting
distorts.

My rapier hilt felt icy; the whip of steel on steel had a
ring to it I had never heard. I hated the fog, telling myself I must make it
serve me: it was to my adÂ­vantage as well as his. Our blades spat fire. I drew
back. The ruins caught the inserting sun and stood distinctly above us: in my
inner sight Caesarâs legions were amused at us. Other watchers
appearedâgrinning. Death is always grinÂ­ning.

Ashley drove me back, steadily, steadily, forcing me toward
the base of the castle where blocks of stone menaced, strewn amidst thick
weeds. I fought to keep my footing and tried to beat him off. He was fighting
savagely: his blade had a whiteness about it I couldnât understand. I felt that
whiteness slice my white belly: so, stumbling over Caesarâs masonry I was to
die.

But I am âgainst self-slaughter and somehow drove him in
front of me and got yards away from the wall, deflecting blow after blow.
Ashley was fighting like a privateer with a cutlass, each blow shoulder-down.
My wrist felt beaten. I parÂ­ried a series of terrific blows and then staggered.

At that moment, Pericles hurled himself on Ashley, playing,
growling, jumpÂ­ing joyously; with a bound he leaped at me and before I could
call off the dog or beat him off, I fell. As I came to my knees, Ashley was
waiting and shoved his blade into my groin.

The fog and woods...they were there in that pain, and
Jonsonâs voice was there...my rapier, I kept thinking, where is it? Will they
pick it up? I felt that months had passed, that I had aged a multitude of
years, like the stone, like the battlement: age, that alchemy, filtered through
the fog and sun...

I remember them carrying me.

Henley Street

November 8, â15

Jonson took me to his apartment in his carriage and bragged
about his HolÂ­land duels and the men he had pinked. As I lay in bed, feverish,
during the days to come, father appeared, expressing pityâthe pity he had
shared with the plague-stricken. âYou there, you, boy, Iâve something for you.
This will help you.â I understood. I cared. I wanted to talk to him. I wanted
to sit with him underneath our apple tree and feel the summerâs sun.

âThe fault, father, is not in our stars, but in ourselves,â
I said to someone. âYours is a fair name, fairer than mine...

âI am singularly moved when the sway of earth shakes like a
thing infirm... this is not a dream, father.â

On Jonsonâs bed, I went through hellish daysâthirst, hunger,
the bungling doctor bungling me, cold, cold remembering, sweatful forgetting,
spouting deÂ­lirious lines from plays... I accused the world of every crime, and
managed to include my own.

I was afraid alone, yet distressed to have others overhear
my ranting. The bed boards gaped and between each board I sweated another
chill.

âWill, hereâs your supper,â Jonson said. âWill, hereâs
breakfast. Will, Iâve brought you a book.â

Pericles licked my hands. Lying under my bed, he thumped his
tail, saying: âGet up, master, there are birds to chase along the Thames.â

âSâ

Without asking me, Jonson wrote to Ellen, and she came from
Edinburgh. Was it her coming that pulled me through? Her care, beauty, her
hands, her smiles of reassurance? Love put on its Oberon and scrubbed the grey
out of the windows.

Quintessence.

She found a better doctor, brought me better food, got Bill
McFarland to look after me, an old friend of hers, agreeable yawning fatness,
eating half our food behind my back, gossiping with Jonsonâs neighbors,
bobbling and drooling his words, coddling me.

When I improved she took me to the park; later, we sailed
the Thames...on shore larks sang... I was grateful and tried to repay too
soon...on top of rolls of canvas at the stern.

At court there was a wedding celebration and a mock battle
and fireworks spilled across the river: how the fireworks turned water into
sky...the guns thunÂ­dered.

âFor us,â she said. âFor your recovery,â she said. How like
a paragon...

The diamond on her velvet blouse winked at me; I put my head
on her lap: pain melted: seagulls mewed as our boat rocked gently.

âSâ

So, Ashley and I settled our accounts. I saw him years later
and we turned our backs on one another. I suppose he was embittered at my
recovery.

The best of us is both participant and confusion, but I, I
am stranger because estrangements have put a lie to my living, making it
stranger still.

Stratford

Monday morning

While recovering from my wound, my brothers, Jim and Dick,
paid me a call.

They seemed quite uninclined to sit, skeptical of Ben, afraid
of Pericles, conÂ­temptuous of the apartment with its manuscripts and shelves of
books. Wearing their farm clothes, they smelled of dung, dirt, and rain-soaked
cloth.

Jonson, wanting to be friendly, told how Pericles acted
during the duel, winking at me, falsifying his ferocity. Brothersâwere those
men my brothers? Long ago, they had washed their hands of my life, Pilatewise.
Mother praised them when I visited our home, ah me.

âI had heard that ya killed that-tar man, in yer duel,â said
Dick, pawing his kneecaps.

Jonson clapped him on the shoulder.

âWish him better luck next time,â he guffawed.

Jim and Dick had brown, flat faces, flattened by hunger, by
defeat, lust, work, illness and sorrow. They had lost their children during the
plague. Their teeth were blackened, or missing. Their clothes...what is a
bundle of dirty clothes topped by a voice and a dead mind?

The afternoon sun poured through the open door. âYour hair
ainât red like it was,â said Jim.

âYouâre getting bald,â said Dick. âThe hairâs slipping down
your neck.â

Bells of London startled them and helped send them on their
way, and I went to sleep, amused by Jonsonâs mimicry and laughter, as he
sprawled in his chair, head thrown back, one hand on Periclesâ mane.

Stratford

My brothersâ visit reminded me of our hometown Ned.

Ned used to lie on the ground with pads underneath his
shoulders: an anvil, weighing two hundred weight, was lowered on his chest by
huskies, and three men with sledges bent a bar on it as he lay there. Ned
performed at every Fair, girls ogling. The picture of him and his admirers
delights me: hero with anvil and hammer. How I used to envy him. Ann thought he
was a wonder. He was. And now I wonder what became of him?

Henley Street

November 13, 1615

One night, Pericles and I got into a talk: he squatted by my
bed and we went over the business of writing for a living... He said the market
was poor. He said my plays were very wordy. He said he had it tough before I
took him on and suggested I see if I couldnât buy stock in a Company, one that
was really
enduring,
he said. âNo use getting in with one that is here
today and gone tomorrow. WisÂ­dom,â he snuffed, âis a thing you get when they
crowd you off the dock into deep water, or when you grab for a mutton bone and
it isnât there.â

Our talks were not long as a rule. Pericles could drop
asleep when I was in the midst of telling him something inÂ­teresting or trying
out a few lines on him. If I offered him a chunk of bread his interest
quickened, and there was tail action too. He could listen attentively to a
stanza, letâs say, if I held the bread (or piece of cheese, preferably cheddar)
above his head, just out of his reach. I sometimes did this to improve his
mind. However, a week or so later there seemed no sign of improvement. Perhaps
dogs, like some people, are impervious to poetry.

Shakespeare, Stratford sleepwalker, walks about his bedroom,

stumbles, tries door handle, raises window:

Ann, in clumsy breasty gown, wakes him angrily:

âWhat on earth were you trying to do?â

âI was listening to Burbage and Alleyn

recite lines from my plays.â

November 15, 1615

A

gain I sleepwalk, from room to
room, standing in doorways, waiting before windows: I wake and there I am,
unseeing, winÂ­dow, door or wall in front of me, the crime of myself, the
assassiÂ­nation of my past confronting me. All the perfumes...all the
words...all the concern defeat their purpose and I ask myself when will I get
up next time and walk the floor, to disturb and be disturbedâfor what reasons?
Reasons for the unreasonable, reasons for the sickness of a mindâhow can they
be called reasons?

I wake to remember a dream, or wake to find the moment as
bare as slate, or I feel that I am somewhere in the past, with my father,
bending over people stricken by the plague, the plague bell tolling, the rain
streaming over my face, someone weeping.

âWhere
is my new cap...whereâs my new cap?â The dying boy pleads, huddled against the
church wall.

Alleynâon the stage at the Globeâinforms me of the plague
and warns me in his stentorian voice to leave off helping people, let them die;
then, he carries away Puck.

Alleyn stalks across the stage, his voice cutting the dark,
my sleep, my sleepÂ­walkerâs darkness. Dressed for
Tambourlaine
, forked
beard over red cloak, he swings through lines, a torch gleaming, smoking behind
his shoulder.

Henley Street

November 18, 1615

When to the session of sweet silent thought

I summon up remembrance of things past...

It is not love-making I call to mind but an August
afternoon, the paths that led us on and on, underneath giant oaks and elms, the
ground wet with sun, our happiness as sure as the trees. We walked through
groves and across fields, the pathway winding past cattle and horses at
pasture, men at work scything grain. Sitting on a rock fence, we listened to
the swish of their scythes, their friendly calls to one another. Wandering, we
ate at a farm, the people happy to have us. Butterflies and children were part
of that farm: it was as simple as that, and since it was so simple I would like
to have that afternoon back again, a small favor to ask of time, just an
afternoon and a lunch at someoneâs farm, dogs lolling on the ground, a cat on
Ellenâs lap.

Like as the waves make toward the pebbled shore,

So do our minutes hasten to their end...

I have not found a way to cheat the end: my glass is broken
and the sand has sifted through. I am too much iâ the shadow, it seems.

Confidence diminished as my memory failed: this began in a
certain way: during one of my plays I could not speak: power of speech gone, I
forgot my lines: this double confusion occurred while I acted in a play by
Jonson, given in Bewick, when we were on a summerâs tour. How vividly I
remember that smoky innâthe crowd, the torches. In Chester, my lines once more
escaped me: utterly perturbed, I gaped at the audience standing and sitting in
the August sun: I wiped away sweat: how they stamped and jeered. Confidence
might have reÂ­turned, after later successful performances, except for another
lapse: memorizing lines for
Othello,
I began to speak them, alone in my
London apartment: again there was nothing, no sound, no memory: I had been
emptied, as a rapier can take care of a wine sack: only the sound of rainfall,
as I stood in my apartment: in my writing, too, lapses sweated me: there was no
one to help: I told no one: soon, I thought, Iâll suckle fools and chronicle
small beer.

How easily I memorized, as a youngster, swallowing the lines
of a play in a night or two. Now I know that impotence can assume many forms,
between the legs and between the eyes.

Henley Street

December 4, 1615

So the plays evolved, week by week, line by line, the
crabbed scrawl, poem and song, comedy and tragedy; so the characters came into
being: Agrippa, Iago, Ophelia, Troilus, Falstaff, King Henry, bearded and
beardless, slut and angel, lady and commoner: they gawked across my sheets of
paper: I see them here, about me, crowding my candleâs niggard flame.

But
look
, they have become phantoms!

Never again, king or coward, never Romeo and Juliet, never a
pair of lovers to kiss and die beside a tomb. It was the nightingale and not
the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of my ear...

Phantoms.

Let me be taken, let me be put to death, and not wait here,
await the hand of tyranny, the slow grasp of this townâs sod. I am to lie
inside the church. The bell will toll. They will carry me. On my grave theyâll
cut these words: I decree:

Good friend, for Jesusâ sake forbear

To dig the dust enclosed here:

Blessed be the man that spares these stones

And cursed be he that moves my bones.

Youth
â

Was there youth?

I sometimes think of the Avon that summer, thunderstorms
booming, the river very high. Cousin Will was trying to yank a calf out of the
water, when the river sucked him under. Kathlene Hamlett played at Opheliaâletting
defeat suck her down. That was a summer of defeats for most of us, the loss of
my fatherâs property, theatres closed because of official disapproval, weeks of
suffocating heat, the sun caught in the trees, frying our brains, flies
buzzing...

Cousin Will was a cheery, responsible boy, with a pitiful
limp. Good at lots of jobs, he was thinking of marrying. Fishing was his
love...poaching too. Kathlene was good and capable but tried making love before
she was old enough...

I miss their smiling faces.

Ben writes such an elegant hand: he has that Italian
influence to perfection: his scripts are damnatory of my provincial scrawl, I
who canât remember whether to write Willm, Will or William...thank God for
copyists, those drones, our skull-down, penny-quill calligraphists. Too bad
someone is not dotting this.

Stratford

Gossip hangs over me, leaving me naked as vulgar air: home
gossip, precipiÂ­tated by Ann, when Philip drops by, then Blanch, then
Longworth, then Melun, then Peter, then Elinor, then Pembroke: Elinor has had a
severe cold; LongÂ­worth has lost his mare; Melunâs wife is down with pleurisy.
Philipâs face is so emaciated he canât carry a rose over his ear; Elinor has to
be helped with a pick-up. âWhen is another doctor coming to practice here?â
Pembroke asks. Ann knowsâand tells. Ann thinks thereâs a possible rape of the
church, no less. Blanchâs face puckers in disgust. Longworth asks for a glass
of water. Peter talks genealogy. Their arrows are carefully wrapped in leaves:
all afternoon they talk in the shade, under the apple, trotting in and out of
the house, moodily conferring in knots or pairs, then sauntering back to leafy
conference. There is a consensus of opinion that the bridge over the Avon may
be too poorly built... âit canât last... Sheriff Grimes has been appropriating
tax money...he must go...â

Someone objects but when Ann objects he objects and she
objects to his objection and the objections because I object are more
objectionable and this objectionable quality leads to further objections...on a
summerâs afternoon.

Henley Street

December 7, 1615

Not long after Hamnetâs death, Ann removed Judith from
school, against my wishes. Though fond of school, Judith became slaved at home.
Laterâin a year or soâAnn needed Susanna, another home puppet. She further
alienated us by this decision. I still say that ignorance, like horse piss,
stinks, cankering the mind. Example: Ann.

I have had more visitors, five Stratford puritans, who
attacked my play writÂ­ing. I got very angry yet tried to conceal my anger;
remembering the smallness of my town I said little to the women; as if in the
wings I waited, remembering:

âHow unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play on me;
you would seem to know my stops; youâd pluck out the heart of my mystery; youâd
sound me from my lowest notes to the top of my compass...thereâs music in this
little organ and yet you canât make it speak. Why?â

I talked to them as best I could and then a fat wench
bleated, jerking at her gloves:

âYou talk in riddles, sir. Your plays ridicule us. You
disesteem our monarchs, King Richard for one. Your plays attract the vulgar.
You praise the rotten...â

By standing, I asked them to leave: perhaps they felt the
pain I felt; then my sickness grew worse after their visit.

An apple tree shakes out a boy:

The boy, Linnus, performs acrobatics in the branches:

Heâs fourteen.

Laughter:

Then King Learâs voice:

âNever, never, never, never...â

Henley Street

Stratford

L

innus, whose gypsy father is an
acrobat, visits me these days; with his father in jail he has to wait for his
release. Dumpy, leather-skinned and wild-eyed, Linnus is fourteen, and has a
four-year-old brother, Peter. Their mother is dead.

My old apple
tree is Linnusâ home, when he is here; I sit outside while he perÂ­forms tricks
he has learned from his father, tricks I have never seen. Peter yawns on the
grass or stands between my legs or pods my lap, thrilled by his brotherâs arm
and leg cleverness...the sun warms the three of us.

His tricks done, glad to rest, Linnus stretches on the
ground, to incline me a little of his wanderings, the hunger, always the hunger:
itâs as if he never had a full meal. They are scourged out of town, thrown into
jail, entertained at castles, fed on cakes and ale, left to starve on a farm.
Linnus points to Peter, asleep on my lap.

âWhy do you like him? Heâs ugly.â

âHeâs ugly but he may change and grow to be handsome,
perhaps become an explorer, like Drake.â And I talk to Linnus about Drake and
the Armada and as I talk it seems to me Iâm talking to Hamnet, or is this
Hamnet on my lap?

It doesnât matter.

Linnus and Peter matter, and after a while we rig fishing gear
and go to the river and fish, dawdle all afternoon, Linnus croaking gypsy songs,
Peter in and out of the water, dashing after magpies and crows, gabbling
berries, every probÂ­lem forgotten.

Home late, Linnus prepared supper for us (Ann away for a few
days): he was quick and clever in the kitchen, reminding me of an actor
familiar with his part.

Henley Street

Stratford

December 11, â15

Linnus described a play he saw last summer and I was
reminded of the first play I saw, as a boy, performed by gypsies who told a
tale of Scottish intrigue and murder that ended with the beautiful heroineâs
suicidal plunge into a loch. Those swarthy actors seldom left my mind for
weeks, waking me, haunting school and play. I can yet see the sheriff torturing
the girl accused of stealing: words have gone but not the actions.

That evening, Papa and I walked home together. He would not
talk about the play. Mama disliked plays and never attended, damning them as
âlucifers.â I suppose the gypsy play was a âlucifer.â

Henley Street

Stratford

December 12, 1615

One of my bitterest experiences was seeing Pericles killed
by a sheep herder. On the outskirts of London, Pericles burst into joyous
yappings and began to frolic and nip sheep, an immense herd, stretching for
blocks. I saw him tangle with a black ram. The herder, rushing at Pericles,
mistaking his fun, struck him with his crook and beat him to the street; then,
before I could shove my way through the herd, flailed him over the head with
the butt. Yelling, pushing, I knocked down the man but reached Pericles too
late... I wanted to leave the city; I wanted to spit on mankind. I wish I could
have my friend to talk to, eat meat from my hand: thereâs plenty of meat for
you now, boy.

Midnight

What is it that has embittered me?

I felt the bitterness long before someone tried to kill
Ellen. Did the bitterness come about through attempting the impossible in my acts
of creation, losing life in work? A tree is tree now. Once it was wonderful. My
spleen stems from the sleepwalkerâs for I am sleepwalker-without-taper, from
Romeo to Shylock, king to clown, hero to villain. I can see distinctly: thereâs
no mirage about cottage, family, friends, and Avon. Stratford is Act 5. I wait
my cue! Go to, what are your lines, Yorik?

Caesarâs battleground kept me from a sane life. Drinking
stronger than ale I kept company with the bloody horde...rape in my
heart...thief at hand...deceit as friend...murder as bed...

Someone beats on my door; thatâs Burbage: âLetâs go, Will,â
he yells. âItâs almost one oâclock; you have to be at the Globe in half an
hour.â

The hour, the play, the scene, the glass running out,
faster, faster, faster!

Henley Street

Stratford

December 20, 1615 Evening â late

Most of all I shall miss a beautiful woman, her smile, the
eyelids and features faintly powdered, the white of her hands and arms, the
sense of longing, her voiceâs mystery, the carefully rounded breasts, their
softness, her light gait, her voluptuary whispers making slave, the weight of
her at night, her softness unÂ­derneath in the morning...

So I never saw her again...writing was my coition...my fake
living...no, I never saw her again; that was fate, or...to never see the wanted
is that phenomenal blindness; to never have the beauty is pismire.

Our old friend sits on her throne, above marble steps,
wearing blazoned robe, her crown straightâand neck straight, too, the lidded
concern apt, antique scepter beside her: her awareness is aware of certainties,
watching earl and capÂ­tain, bawd and bugler.

We are to love her, do collective obeisance, beseech her
favors. And she, with her rufescence, shall free us of every plague, down to
smallest poverty, and, like Merlin, give us castles for cots, hope for despair,
money for thought.

Sleeve lifts pontifical hand and blesses with its kissing
ring. Rays of sun, through lozenged windows, fold leaded shadows over troubled
brows.

Ah, Queen, your majesty is unparalleled, you are our patron
of the arts, genÂ­erous in every particular, particular to manâs freedom,
eschewing stock, pillory and scaffold.

As she rises, sequins and braid tremble, every motion
capsuled in scarlet, the very velvet of confidenceâthe robe quite long, ruffs
and ruffles fresh, the jewels paying their worth: she walks, our Queen walks:
we remember her mother scafÂ­folded for adultery.

Henley Street

Shylock was less persistent than I to own, fief vs. chattel,
clown vs. crown, thoughts vs. dreams: with such a goal, a man stoops, a man
batters, a man asÂ­tonishes himself with crudities that some might call
vitality: this is the sighing, buying, signing: and when I began to own more
land and houses I owned less and less time: that was my mortgage, paid over and
over by less writing.

Philo

Noâit was the
day beforeâat night.

Thomas

When...when was
it?

Philo

Speak
lower...theyâll overhear us! Sssh!

Thomas

I didnât bury
her the day before. No man buries love at night, only hate. You saw me carry
her to her roomâlay her down tenderly. You share the secrets of our
lives...and now the secret of her death. âSblood, that is that remains for
each of us, hide carefully, forgetting intrigue, forgetting ScotÂ­land...

But I can no longer write!

Snow beats on the windows and winter chills me, cold hands
on my throat. Where are my faithful players? Where is Alleynâspeaking divinely?
If I could talk to him I might be able to write again. If this storm did not
batter this house so treacherously!

Green lozenges of light penetrate the oriel,

green drinking mugs,

green on table decanter,

Shakespeare and Jonson drinking.

Stratford streets in the late afternoon sun,

sounds of a carriage,

sounds of kids coming home from school.

January third, 1616

I

t does no good to rage at my
impotence and yet I rage...come bird, come...come, heart, perform your art.

Yesterday, I was carried out of my private madness by Ben
JonÂ­sonâs visit: we drank and laughed, his thick cloak thrown off, his broad
shoulders broader, voice kindly, eyes the eyes of one acting well-rememÂ­bered
lines, hands relaxed on his lap or gesturing easily.

âNow that the night begins with sable wings to overcloud the
brightness of the sun, and that in darkness pleasures may be done...let us to
the bower and pass a pleasant hour...â

He said those lines years ago, and that night Ellen came to
me, and waited backstage, there, with the dusty props and dirt. Ah, her beauty:
I saw it against the sticks and pricks of make-believe! I felt its warmth. I
asked her how she was but she wanted kisses, not civilities.

(Vapid lines out of the
Spanish

Tragedy
seemed
foolish there backstage and could not matter less as Ellen and I drove to her
apartmentâin her red carriage, swaying through the rain.

Her fireplace was stacked with flame. Her servants withdrew
and she leaned against her marble mantel, breast leaning forward, her dress
low, shoulders and neck bare, such ivory.

Her cousin had accompanied us in the carriage; now we could
talk:

âI hadnât expected you in London tonight,â I said.

âI came from Dover, yesterday, late yesterdayâ she said.

âFrom your brotherâs place at St. Cloud?â

âYes. A hard trip across the channel and hard to be away so
long from you... My dear, this playâs better than the last. How you make those
Venetians live! Theyâre like so many Iâve known... You must have known them
too...â

âDarling, I like your hair this way. French? Your
hairdresser really knows...â

âWill, tell me that you love me. I love you.â

âShould I?â

âYour letters tell me but now, you tell me.â

âWith hands and mouth...â

It was like thatâher gown letting meâbut it was also fear,
remembering that Ben had warned us that we had been followed by another
carriage as we left the theatre...twice now.

Ellen and I hoped our purse of hope would lose all
counterfeit coins...foreign exchange no...no cheating, no niggardly
luck...could I foresee with gypsy insight?

Our goblets touched.)

But I prolonged Benâs New Year visit: we sat on chairs in
the oriel, and talked and talked, and the talking of him brought out the
talking in me, and there was no bothersome time: I suppose we ate by
candlelight; I suppose we went to bed, but our talking was not bedded, and I
hear it now in the sound of his reÂ­treating horses: I hear hope retreating,
hoof on cobble, hoof on brain: for he will not come again. Or should I ask him,
being thought-sick?

Twelfth Day

In the fall I went across the fields to the poplar trees
under which Ann and I used to make love; I sat in the sun and let it drench me.
The trees were nobler though limbs had fallen off; one tree was rotted at the
top; another...but no matter.

I sat and remembered how it was before our twins were born,
sat with elÂ­bows on my knees, gaping. I tried to see that pair of lovers loving
on the grass. That love had never happened. No. The thing that was real was my
gaping loneÂ­liness...

I walked home and took up a packet of her letters; this one
was lying on top:

Dear Red,

I am glad that people like your play, that

Romeo and Juliet
play. That was the one we saw at the Globe, I think.
The CapuÂ­lets frightened me much. What is the name of your new play that you
are writing at? I canât remember. Is it the
Merchant
play?

You should write a play about your papa
and his glove-making. The twins are sick again. Hamnet is the worst, sick at
night, and all that. Judith has a flushed face and she coughs and coughs, and I
keep her in bed.

Write soon.

Love,

Ann

I try to forget the casualness and say it belongs to a
buried past and then I say to myself, if this is dead then all life is equally
dead, including myself.

I opened another letter and a dried flower fell out of the
yellowed paper. I had to hold the sheet to the window before I could read it,
meantime trying to harden myself, half remembering. My wits are diseased, I
thought.

Dear Red,

So you have made twenty-two pounds at
the theatre from all the good attendance. That will help take care of the
clothes we need, and winter right against us. What is this play they are
playing at the Globe, the Othella thing? I have heard Mama talk about a woman
like thatâsome foreign woman. Is Othella your leading person? Is she pretty? Is
it true you fought a duel? That will not help you get ahead in London. You said
that people talk.

You should see Hamnet. How well he does
with his school work, better than anyone at school, I hear. He takes after you,
his master tells me.

Our bedroom window was broken in the
storm last week, but Tom has put in new glass, and leaded and puttied it
nicely. It was the window by the good chair.

Love,

Ann

Like roses, red roses on a stalk, or was it, coral is far
more red than her lipsâ red...love is my sin...my love is longing still!

I put away her letters and closed the shutters and lit the candles
and the rush lamp, and, settling in my chair, I read of another past, to
palliate myself, Virgilâs.

Stratford

I have been thinking of Merlin and his magic ways, the
thrall of his immense dabbling: this island should have been named Clas
Myrddin: Merlinâs Enclosure. Perhaps Gawain and Lancelot would have enclosed us
and the grail might not have become the great illusion among illusions.

I am reading Spenserâs
Amoretti
now: now I read what
Raleigh read in prison; the coincidence is appropriate enough. There are not
too many coincidences in life but there are many kinds of prisons. Perhaps the
worst is the prison imprisÂ­oning the prisoner against his will; the other
prison, self-germinated, self-mainÂ­tained, can be as ascetic, as impassioned in
its tortures, and yet it has its rush lamp for the outcast state:

Pour soul, the center of my sinful earth,

Thrall to these rebel powers that thee array.

Why dost thou pine...such a mistaken canister

Of words that I would not put them down once more.

January 15, 1616

StratfordâHenley Street

Viola bows rasped and recorders piped and rain hit the door
and windows at Hallâs, the quartet playing before his fireplace, the men
sitting with their backs to the blaze, instruments fired.

âMore ale?â

âHow about canary?â

âCake, eh, Will?â

Cakes and rain perpetually, the strings for a throat,
garroting the night...the rain, it raineth every night. Admit no impediments,
listen:

Never say that I was false of heart...the poison left her
stunned, as if beneath an avalanche of men. Mad slanderers, no, Ann deserved
the slander but what could slander accomplish? Like incessant rain, or that
repeated low note on the fiddle, what good? A flooding melancholy, and Ann
unchanged.

Love was my sin but now my sin is breathing. And tonight it
is a multiple sin for I am listening, hoping these instruments and players have
a message for my soul. The shattered rain on windows is everymanâs storm, the
gutter thief, the pimp, the kingâall of us hunkered under pain.

The good Dr. Hall bends over me:

âFeeling better tonight, Will? I hope so.â

I chuckle and say I am.

Put on your cloak and hurry, Hall. Thereâs someone sicker
than I who needs you. Eat a crocodile. Iâll be going home soon. I should be
there now, going over my accounts.

Music has unstopped my ears but no grapple of sound holds
tonight, not with the scrofula of rain, the wink of time on cavernous faces
beefed by the fire.

See that wizened face, thatâs Hall, tall and thin, and next
to him my frump, belly puddinged, hair screwed at angles, lines and then more
lines lining the half-open mouth, the missing teeth... Ann, dear Ann, was it to
you I wrote the sonnet beginning? Ah, no, the errors snare us, bare us to the
quick of lime. The arithÂ­metic of memory multiplies fantasy.

Poetry, succor me in this hour of need, help me as you have:
I have given you my life; now, you must lend argument to my folly. Dry the rain
on my skull! Be youth: be Ellen, outcast, incast, what is your substance,
whereof you are made, that millions of strange shadows on you tend? Is this
my

memory? Or do the lines remember me?

The notes of the quartet confuse the shadows, the fireâs
instrument, the tankÂ­ards on the table, one for you, Marlowe...

I am to wait, though waiting be as hellâ

And we walked home together through the rain, she who has
never met Touchstone or Polonius or Othello...

And so to a cold bed.

âSâ

On some of Dr. Hallâs visits, he urged me to discontinue my
journal, wanting me to rest. I told him that the language I used was hardly
playwriting, requiring the barest effort on my part. I explained that I need
something. He huffed and rumbled, with professional sincerity, like the good
neighbor he is, and I underÂ­stand now that my resurrected fears may, like a
Greek chorus, pervade and anÂ­nul. But what do they pervade and annul, this
corner, precharnel, prepaid house in Hell? Am I to talk with trees? Am I to
forget manhood? Am I to cheer old age? Infirmity? Hall is such a knotted
creature I wonder my Susanna married him: such a sultry woman for such a
cadaver! His contorted body, pinched here, pinched there, sewed here, unsewed
there, his starvation face, with zealot eyes in bald skull, leaves me lacking
in confidence; yet, I listen and he prescribes and we talk and play chess. I am
his medical pawn, gulping doses for him, bleeding for him: is the final move
his or mine?

Home

January 18, 1616

Dr. Hall, when you found your woman in my Susanna, you found
bed-woman, kitchen wench and apothecary girl. Your shop, shelved, bottled, ointÂ­mented,
reeks of balm and poison. Long before you married my Susanna, I got to know
that smell when I came to you to help me battle pain. You were never too ill or
busy to help me check painâs unkindness.

But underneath your skin you are another Timon, another
hater of mankind, concocting health to make more health to make more pain to
make money. Pestel in hand, you measure alleviants, the richer your patient,
the cleverer your compound. How you worry on behalf of the young countess. How
you thumb your books for the Lord Chamberlainâs gout.

Drum bottlesâ

Beat shelvesâ

Smash glassâ

See, his shingle in the wind, JOHN HALL â PHYSICIAN, weeps
rain, and I sit waiting, with vapors, losses, pangs, venoms in my blood,
anticipating preÂ­scriptionsâor epitaph.

His face grimaces his thanks, his hand extended, his pox is
to ârob one another. Thereâs more gold! Cut throats...all that you meet are
thieves!â All this is patiently and subtly withheld by the good doctor since
frightening the patient frightens money. Only dear friends discover the true
Timon...

Oh, God, how pain strangles me today! It paves my skull! I
am on fire! Such useless misery! Pain is the greatest cheat. Pain, your
friendship is much too covÂ­etous! Painâyou old prostituteâswallow your own
hemlock for a change!

Henley Street, Stratford

January 20

I am too hard on friend Hall!

Iâve spent hours there, puttering, talking, laughing,
entertained by his curious, Indian cowâs tail, stones cut from menâs bladders,
uterine balls of hair, paw of a bear, and skeleton of a pigmy.

This year, he is publishing a treatise on the
Wounds of
the Abdomen
. Heâs as clever with his scalpel as his concoctions of
wormwood, rosarum and menthol. Around Stratford, he is best known for his
treatment of dropsy.

Stratford

January 23, 1616

Logs burn in my fireplace and I have a book on my lap: I
have a kingdom: a crown: crackling of wood becomes voices, stuff of dreams,
friends, stages, plays, quarrels, hopes, changes, beginnings, endings, the pen
scratching paper, pigeons chuckling, laughter, death, Hamnetâs face, fatherâs,
the cloak, the whisper, the plague, the rain, fog, losses, waves against rocks:
a log totters and the upended section spurts into a pennant...shake-scene!

I have no pictureâno drawingâto help me remember Hamnet.
Inago Jones could have done one. I should tear apart pieces of paper and fold
them until they become his face, or, with scissors, cut out his silhouette.
Damn the weak mind that makes such simple wishes impossible!

There was no artist in Stratford. Stratford had no skills to
offer except deathâs skill...death for all of us along with that triumvirate,
love, marriage, children; with fornication for pallbearer, adultery for sexton,
rape for choirmaster...

How
weary and stale and flat are the uses of this world. Bring hebenon for O...

Youthâs falcon on his glove, Hamnet stands with his friends
around him, most of them young, their well-groomed horses held by pages.

On the distant shore of a lake, a castle breaks through a
grove of beech.

Hamnet is laughing at his unhooded bird.

âHave you unseeled him?â someone asks.

âHe can fly,â Hamnet says. âNow.â

âSee...heâs looking for game!â

âHamnet, is it true your father writes plays for our Queen?
London plays?â

âYou should see his
Macbeth
! Thatâs a play for you!
Duel and all! Weâll go to London and see one of his plays. Thereâs one at the
Palace soon.â

How I would like to rearrange life, bring happiness, bestow
wealth, fix love, make well, foil crime, reverse ill luck. But only the stage
can accomplish miracles and there custom stales the plot and disharmonies garble
intention.

But, as evening galls, and candles go on, I hear Hamnetâs
footsteps...he wants new gloves, new hood, new leash...

Whatâs past is prologue:

At Blackfriars, the chandeliers of candles are hugely lit
and light streams upon Alleyn, who is speaking on stage; the boards are clean
and shine; all actors are in their places; the seats are almost filled; I see a
woman, in dark green velvet; acÂ­companied by her maid, she takes a seat; rows
of faces beseech the stage: oh kingdom, place of tempest and calm, engulf us
again!

Henley Street

Stratford

February 1

Suumânunânonny
, the wind said, as my father and I
worked in his gloverâs shop, quiet hours, among the many kinds of leather,
sheepskin, goat, kid, lamb, pigskin, coltskin, doeskin, buckskin. In his tiers
of drawers were the pontifical gloves, liturgical gloves, gloves for
dignitaries, ladiesâ gloves, wedding gloves...

A bird sang in its cage by the door.

Between the opening and closing of the shop we talked
pleasantly or waited on customers with consideration:

We talked of Rocco Bonetti, the great London fencing master,
and his fencÂ­ing school; we talked of the snail and how it shrinks in its house
when hit, or sits in the shade of its shell; we chatted about spears and
helmets and mottos like
Non
Sanz
Droict,
his favorite; we
talked of great castles, like Kenilworth, and their ghosts; we talked of kings
and how to catch larks with a mirror and scraps of red cloth...the buzz of our
talk was a good buzz.

So, another memory!

Candlemas

I wrote
The

Tempest
at Stratford, the only
play I wrote at home. For the first time I had leisure to write, in my garden,
the summer warm: this was an island for an island: time faded: I remembered
scenari

I had seen at the
commedia

dellâarte:
I remembered the wreck of
the
Sea Adventure
in Bermuda: a drunk sailor stopped me and described
that grievous storm, described the bewitched island, and I began:

On ship at sea:

Captain:

Boatswain!

Boatswain:

Here, Master,
what cheer?

Captain:

Good fellow,
talk to the sailors, warn them, fall to it quickly or weâll run aground!

Enter

sailors:

Boatswain:

Quickly, my
fellows! Take in the topsail speedily! Thatâs the captainâs warning whistle!

Then
the shipwreck followed.

It was pleasant to invent without pressure: I wanted a
lively yet serene play, with a mixture of philosophy, humor and fantasy: I
wanted a play to fit the new mode, free of symbolism.

I walked about my garden and my peace trees, and there, over
there was Caliban, a savage slave; I took another turn, and there was Ariel; I
heard the wind blow hollowly across an uninhabited island...

âSafely in harbor is the kingâs ship; in the deep nook where
once you called me at midnight... Go, make yourself a nymph of the sea... Where
should this music be? In the air, or the earth? Delicate Ariel, sea nymphs ring
the knell...in the dark backward and abysm of time...â

Discs of spinning yellow, pink, lavender:

A hundred Kemps are jigging,

each in yellow clown suit,

grinning, clowning, enroute to the Globe.

Kemp jigs onto the stage:

Applause.

Home

S

o it went...

As I left the Globe, near the end of a play, I found Will
Kemp, slumped on the steps, by the street, head on his arms, sobbing: he would
never clown for us again: he said he was too old, that he embarrassed us, that
times had changed: as I stood beside him, he glanced away.

I had watched him a hundred times and thought him better
than Summers, or any clown: Kemp was legend, for jig and bawdy tale, for the
laugh at the end of the play. Londoners flocked to see himâhad flocked to see
him for years.

His make-up streaked by the rain, his yellow suit soaked, he
tottered to his feet, as if drunk. Last summer he had danced his way across country,
from place to place, enthusiastically received by villagers and
townsmenâcarried aloft on their shoulders.

His wrinkled face was drunken-lined, shining in the rain. He
yanked his hat lower: was he remembering his fustian scenes, hard-drinking,
quarrelling? He was famous for his winnings at primeroâstubby, rock-muscled,
little, knottedâhe wavered, seemed about to collapse.

The play was over and the theatre crowd vomited out and milled
around Kemp, encircled him, caught him up, hoisted him and bore him, through
the streets, howling, cheering: KEMP...KEMP...KEMP!

Home

A number of years before we dismissed Kemp at the Globe, I
visited him at his Thames River homeâa home in the Sir Walter style. Kempâs
carriage brought me. I strolled about his extensive garden for a few luxurious
moments, viewing the river below, thinking how well it paid to invest in land
and play primero. His doormen showed me in, for I had been invited to dinner.

Mrs. Kemp, dressed in pale green, came toward me, to greet
me, a charming young woman: like a clap of thunder, Kemp came at her, caned
her, lashed her with fierce blows, and dragged her to her room. I didnât wait
for an explanation of his violence...

I do my best on the pot and think of my sex and think Iâll
be rotting soon, and I hear pegs moving in the beams, and I hear old time and
new timeâoutside the church bells strike. Outside of what?

Why do I write?

All day Ann has sat by the windows, embroidering, soakÂ­ing
sun, her rheuÂ­matic fingers paining her, her silence and disdain evident.

Her stooped shoulders anger me because they remind me of my
age, and I rant at timeâs disdain and irreparable devastations: a plague on
timeâs house, a plague on mineâsickly wife and sickly husband.

Egyptâit is well you arenât here, to be contorted, cheated,
frailed or paunched. To nourish an illusion is hard and grows harder through
the years. The only wisdom is the quiet heart, born of the smile of heaven,
seeking nature, not the wild sea of conscience.

But that is for the wise! Today, there is no Orpheus. The
trees are not our sanctuary. The seas donât hang their heads; I hang mine.
Whereâs the lute, the player? I travel round and round the dial, to Ellen and
the cloak, the fog and loneliest of men. Time should cure all, they say. But
timeâas I see timeâdoes not oblige.

My last will...my last walk...my last play. I never thought
of a last play.
Henry VIII
was to have another and yet
another...creeping on but creeping to be sure...other sonnets...other
songs...to sleep, to die, to sleep...

O shit on death.

February 10, â16

I used to wake with anticipation. I wake these mornings and
know that I may not wake in another twenty days. When I lie down to sleep I
think I may fall asleep and from that sleep never wake. I consider the worried
faces about me and realize they will not have to endure me for long. Jonson
visits me and I think this is his last visit.

Cheat, your door, as it swings open, opens onto a cave; no
shepherdâs note signals to watery star...cuckold...bastard...my tale will end
and my small cubicle will be filled. Have I put down manâs spirit with enough
spirit? Beauteous youth, have I recorded you? I never wanted to write loveâs
epitaph... Antony was my tongue in praise.

I am certain that love is the best, love that is closest to
beauty and the kindest of affections. Sensation surpasses thought. Imagination is
well enough but it is not love. Between earth and heaven, imagination compares
with no warm arms and legs.

Feb. 11, â16

Stunned by povertyâhow hard it was to write during those
early years. Belly gnawing, I kept at it: I lay down, I got up, sat at the big
table. Storms hunkered over the roof tops, the sun licked at the roofs, snow
bundled them, and I was cold, cold. Smoke puffed from chimneys, bent in the icy
mornings like hearse plumes. ChimneysâI never wanted to count them; broken,
dying chimneys, strewed the city below me. One brick stack leaned far over, yet
belched smoke.

Pimps lived on one side of me, prostitutes on the other; I
could not move without paying my rent. My place was never warm: my hands
cracked because of the cold. I kept my legs wound in rags, coughing.

Because of pleurisy I had to sell all of my books: Mary sold
them for me, one by one, maybe two or three at a time. How old was Mary?
Twenty? I was about twenty-five. It would take another twenty-five years to dim
her memory: the stalk of her body, her restless, weightless feet. She bent a little
to the left, as if injured, the arms also restless, the eyes inward. Did she ever
laugh? Her smile always seemed something pushed into being, only a little jolt
got it there.

She sold my books and bought my food and fed me, the hell of
pleurisy ridÂ­ing me: tears in my eyes I attempted to eat: tears of many kinds
crushed me. The roofs, the cold, the sorrow, how they come back to me! The anguish
in my side went on for weeks but Mary never failed or complained: she fucked
men at night and succored me during the day: sometimes she slept on the floor
beside my bed or lay across the foot of the bed, a blanket around her. Her
black hair might unpin itself and lie about her.

âLetâs keep a bird, when itâs Spring,â I suggested.

âHow can you feed it, w-w-w-without money?â she asked.

âMy father is sending money.â

âWhen? Soon?â

âHas someone written to him? You must see to it, Mary. Make
someone write.â

âI think s-s-s-so. Iâll try again, ton-n-n-night.â

I managed to eat more when the money came and Mary ate well:
I ate for those who were poor, I ate for my father, for the starving waifs, for
the sick, those in prison, fighting in wars. I ate because it would soon be
Spring. I ate because I must write.

Wrens built a nest above my window. Day after day, they
fluttered in and out; day after day it got warmer; I was able to take care of
myself; Mary and I were planning to picnic beside the river; she never came; I
waited and waited; I asked those who knew her; no one had seen her.

I asked for her many times. There was absolutely no trace of
her. She simply disappeared. Some criminal? Some man? Death? I never knew.

Ave Maria!

Home

Over the years I have read Ellenâs letters, hearing them
almost. Those lines of hers, when I was dismal and lonely, shook off the curse
of disillusionment. Even now, after these years, lines come to me:

Surely the greatness of a play lies in
its mystery: we are taken inside a private world that is tragic or amusing or
sentimental; things that are a part of this world must be judiciously hinted at.

Your plays take life apart because your
poetry is so proÂ­found. Itâs the finest poetry I know. Knowing you gives your
work added profundity...

The theatre gives man breadth: itâs his
second life. A country without a theatre is a poor, barren country.

Spring is the best part of the
year...we decided: our lochs take on a greenness that must originate in deep,
moss-covered rock. I think that water has a definite temperament, a personalÂ­ity,
if you like... I like to walk when the sting of spray mingles with fog and
underfoot, like a blanket, are the tiny flowers... I want you...

My brother is fond of you. He laughs
and asks what is it that makes me take to that man? You must come back to
Scotland, Will. Write me seriously about a possible visit... Love finds a
way...

I wish you could be here, the castle is
so beautiful, springÂ­time is so evident, so unlike Scotland, full of gay
things, white lilies and pansies along the paths, tulips and agnus-castus,
roses around our statues and ramblers on the arbors. Only the biggest roses are
in full flower: you should see the yellow ones. You know, I think yellow is my
favorite color, and itâs because the sun is yellow, for what would this earth
of ours be without the sun? We wouldnât even have love, would we? And I wouldnât
even be able to dream of your kisses and your arms about me. And thatâs what
the sun is for, for dreaming, springtime dreaming...and I wish for you, to walk
with me, and love me. I will pick a pansy and wear it for you. I will pick a
rose and put it in my room, for you. Will, when can we see each other? Canât
you come here?...

Her letters were like that...

Stratford

February â 1616

Queen Elizabeth came on our stage at the Palace as I played
the role of king, the afternoon stainglass bangling her jewels. I was shocked
at seeing her galled face and yet had the guts to continue my lines, adding
improvisations as well, to force her to wait. While she waited, she dropped her
glove (playing her part), and as I arranged my robe, talking as I stood there,
I picked up her glove and slowly faced the audience and said:

âYet we stoop to pick up our Cousinâs glove.â

How that amused her. âSuch propriety!â she said.

âSuch folly,â I wanted to say.

This is high class prostitution commonly called âpurse
penury,â our coldest-oldest art. The art is especially susceptible to jewels
and the brazenness of crowns. Men have been hung for their inability to kowtow,
with poverty in the wings, snivelling or prancing jubilantly.

King James
â

Now
that you are our new friend, sceptering this Brittic island with careful gaze,
ours is the homage! We see that your awareness is aware of considerations, a
King James version of Sleeves and Ruff duly pressed.
You surely press promÂ­ises without guilt
for gilt. Through narrow lozenged glass the sun administers your ceremonials.

Oh, king, your uniqueness Towers over us: you are our
stiller of war, our buffer of hate, our unbiased protestant.

You riseâand London rises.

You walkâand London walks, for we are your guardians.

If your latest diamond is somewhat small, speak to us and it
will be rememÂ­bered in moors, fens, and locks. If your crown, coming from a
womanâs head, needs adjusting our adjusters are sure hands, toward continuity.

When Susanna visited me in London we ate at the Swann: she
loved the rich and badly seasoned food, the purpled windows and painted
scripture walls. âOh, Papa, this is a wonderful Inn... Oh, Papa, isnât that a
beautiful house by the river? Think of living there! Those people must be awful
rich! Will we get that rich? ...Papa, Iâve never seen such beautiful books...
And look, look at the Thames in the sun; the sun seems squashed right into the
water. And can we really ride in a boat again, down toward the ocean?â

Enthusiasm was her best quality. And very little perturbed
her. Trash strewn in the street, a dead cat, brawling seamen...she drew back in
disgust but soon found something exciting or beautiful. When I sleepwalked and
stumbled against a table and broke the rush lamp, she was undisturbed. She
kissed me, and we talked about what weâd do tomorrow. She was fifteen, then.
Fifteenâwhat an age! She wanted to remain with me in London and I would have
permitted it if I could have looked after her. There was no budging Ann to the
city. Some thought Susanna a hussy.

Fun-loving, keen at games, she outplayed her friends. While
she played I would be at my writing. In the midst of her fun, she might pop up
and say: âPapa, youâre working too hard: you never have fun.â Her consideration
brought me to my senses and I remembered growing up with six kids: none of them
had her brightness. Of course the years changed her: her copper hair darkened:
her enthusiasm faded: marriage ruined her figure: marriage made her a business
woman: her hussiness became sexmate: Dr. Hall her all! How clearly I can reÂ­member
today...a warning. And why do I write?

Shakespeare discovers Ellenâs blue cloak

in a heap of theatre crud in his Stratford closet:

Puzzled, he sits on the floor, holds up the cloak,

checks the fabric, his face sickly:

Fog at the door of his house.

Henley Street

Stratford

February 24, 1616

R

ummaging in my storeroom, I found
forgotten things, things I had supposed lost or destroyed, a velvet jacket
faced with grubby ermine, a pair of crimson trousers, a leather breastplate and
brass helmet ornamented with a dragonâs crest. It annoyed me that none of these
things had deteriorated. For some unfathomable reasonâCaesaria egoâI put on the
breastplate and helmet and gaped at myself. How now, that sickly face and
stupidity: my stupid room, some of it visible in the same glass: the odious
German etchings Judith gave me, Papaâs cracked leather chest, the unÂ­polished
table, seamed plaster and varnished beams.

Tossing
breastplate and helmet into the storeroom, I noticed something. A cloak?
Lifting it out of a box, unfoldÂ­ing it, I thought it was her blue theatre
cloak. How could it be, after having disappeared years ago, in the street? But,
holding it higher, I searched for the slash and the blood stains. Of course it
had been cleverly cleaned and mended! I was too disturbed to go over it
carefully. No...no...I dropped it and put out the light and went to bed.

Lying there, I watched sky, clouds floating, white over
stars and then the stars dazzlingly near and then the cloud-cloak covering them
once more, drowning.

Fear sifts through my fingers and mind.

What am Iâa lie? Was she a lie? Was life? The cloak?

Why havenât I, if I am sure of myÂ­self, seen to it that my
plays have been published? I leave nothing. Nothing!
Antony
,
Hamlet
,

Macbeth
,
Winterâs

Tale
,
RoÂ­meo
...not one. I must
speak to Jonson and Alleyn. I must write to them at once!

Fog lay about in pieces like pieces of my life. Ground fog.

In the starlight I glared at my hands and saw that they were
swollen, as they have often been lately.

Wasnât that snow falling, flakes of morning?

I tried to remember Ellenâs face, tried to feel her
presence.

When Ann brought me breakfast I could not look at her though
she spoke to me kindly.

I write with costly effortâhands worse. I am cold. My mind
staggers.

To the orielâto look outside.

Thinking makes poverty.

Religion as we came to regard it in London was a glib and
soiled art.

Eclipses of our mental sun and moon betray us; so I beseech
you, brain, do not regress as time shows timeâs ending: old and reverend, think
straight.

Eater of broken meats I seem to be: knave, rascal, ruffian.
Reverence to self...

Perhaps this cold world will turn us all to fools and
madmen...

Stratford

Why is it I grimace so much? Alone I mug, pull my beard, rub
flat of hand over my eyes, crack knuckles, shrug, sigh. Is this my sane
monologue with self? Whatâs its purpose? Perhaps I must convince myself that I
am alive and battling: grimace at the window, grimace on the pot, grimace at
bed. Grimace is my hornÂ­book. For the best of self-conviction I prefer knuckle
crackingâsuch skeletal speech.

Stratford

February 26, 1616

So Iâll never know who attacked Ellen?

Is it because I am sick that I care?

Could it be that someone stepped from his stage of
bitterness and struck her that night the fog drowned her carriage? Did he
resent my luck? The harder poverty knocked the keener he felt my good luck: was
that how it was? Was hunger a knife in his belly? Did he run away from London
afterward? His hunÂ­gry, motherless kids asked him to kill for money? Was that
how it was?

âYour brother Fred is here, bending over you...â

âWas that Ann, who said that yesterday? Or was it Hall,
bending over me, who said that Fred had come by?â

Ellen, could you come? Or Hamlet? Othello? Marlowe?

Stratford

March 5, 1616

Years ago I wrote this:

Can honor set a leg? Or set an arm? Or take away the pain of
a wound? What is honor? A word? What is that word? Air? What has it? The fellow
who died on Wednesday, does he feel it? Does he hear it?

But I still hear it...honor lives for me, in my memories of
my father, for all those who have worked before I came into being, for the
cathedral spire, the ship, the cut gem, the book, the play, the figure standing
in sun and snow...

13th

Very sick for three days. Dr. Hall. Others.

Pain.

Canât get to the oriel.

Wouldnât know a hawk from a handsaw.

15th

I go before my darling,

I go before...

Follow to the bower in the close alley,

There we will together sweetly kiss

And like two wantons, dallyâdallyâdally...

Sing it againâsing to me before I dieâthe candles are
dyingâthe wind is dyingâI suffocate in my roomâI want to be with youâsing our
songâoh, to dally once moreâsingâ

March 18, 1616

Judith married early because I felt I could not last much
longer... Judith, will a hundred and fifty pounds help you, with that husband
who doesnât want to work? A fine son-in-law...but...ah, the trouble I have
caused. She could have waited...but, at that time...she thought... My will is
insufficient...

Illness is such folly

I still remember names

Alleyn was here to see me...

Burbage wonât come...the man you care most to see, cares less
for thee.

March 19

My affection remains, blazes as it were: there were winnings:
good things strive to help us: come unto the yellow sands for their
beneficence: hark: a pox against pain: who has pain! No. Defy the monsters,
prod the phoenix, bury pigÂ­nuts, come forward magical, fecundate freedom,
build, levy songs.

I need Raleighâs elixir! If men concoct an elixir of youth
it is too late for me.

Then, that elixir of elixir of elixirs, hebenon!

Sprinkle it.

March 21, 1616

Now that I am sick, it seems so rare a thing I once climbed
elms for rookâs nest and slashed all afternoon, in the August sun, to scythe
the timothy in rows. I was fifteen, I think it was. Larks flew and sang. I
liked the click-a-click of my scythe as it bladed. Crickets chirped. Magpies
and jackdaws took the air. There was a kingfisher diving.

I long to dive where I used to swim, at Grayâs pool,
alongside the burned mill; I used to strip and plunge off the sluice, after
working in the field. Or we used to swim thereâfive or six of usâand test who
could stay under longest, testâwhat was it I wanted to test?

Cowslips grew cap-a-pie on two sides of that pool and their
cinque-spotted faces got trampled underfoot as we dashed nakedly about, lewdly
knuckling each otherâs penis. Banks of violets were thick on the shady side of
the mill, thickest among heaps of smashed and rotting shingles...her favorite
flower! Hers!

Home

Suppertime

Getting ready to die is looking across a stage through
semi-darkness; it is muffing oneâs lines; it is listening to incomprehensible
promptings; it is taking the wrong exit. It is tampering with the plot,
eliminating the star from the best scenes, substituting a beginner. Getting
ready to die is watching the candle gutÂ­ter, hearing the rooster before dawn,
saying loveâs good-bye; it is the footstep on the stair, the reveled, sleeved
and broken sword.

Getting ready to die is no manâs business!

O, that this too, too solid flesh...

Home â Evening

March 27, 1616

For several days my eyesight has failed and I have been
unable to write. I have less pain but I can not eat. They talk to me and I lie
here, restless, hearing, hearing... I want to hear something like a promise, an
echo of things hoped for.

That knocking at the door!

Rain over the house.

To sleep, to sleep...

March 28, 1616

When I was twenty, splendid, strong, I thought it would be
noble to die in the Spring: ah, noble death I praised you childishly. This is
springtime, and I see no signs of nobility.

Tired with all these, for restful death I cryâ

how like a poem those lines read,
and lie! At that time, when I wrote that sonnet, I was never more in love with
life.

For days the rain has been falling over the town, fine rain,
grey rain that is determined to shatter the last of my courage...for days.

Ann stands by my bedside, a plate of food in her hands,
urging me to eat: âTake something...it will help you, Will.â

Susanna sits by my side and sighs, âPapa, Papa.â

Alleyn visits me, his voice warming my room, in the beaten
way of friendship.

March 30, â16

Again I am reminded I must complete my willâand so I must.

Tomorrow Iâll dictate...how will it go?

In the name of God, I, William Shakespeare, gentleman, in
perfect health and memory, make and ordain this last will and testament...

How can I say perfect health and memory?

I commend my soul into the hands of God, hoping and
believing to be made a partaker of life everlasting, and my body to the earth
thereof it is made... Custom...

Item: I bequeath to my daughter, Judith, a hundred and fifty
pounds (shall I make it more?); in addition, I grant her my estate in Warr
CountyâI like that place...

To JoanâI leave my clothes. Why?

To Elizabeth Hall, I leave my silverware...

To Thomas Combe, my sword. (I liked that sword...its inlaid
hilt!)

To Richard Burbage (good friend), money for a ring.

For daughter, Susanna Hall, my home, barns, stables,
orchards, gardens, lands, tenements...my new house in Blackfriars.

To Ben Jonsonâfifty pounds and this journal. Short-changed
again, Ben.

Item:
to my wife, my second best bed and our furniture. (It should be more. What
shall it be?)

To Dr. John Hall, all settlements after the payment of
debts...there is no more...

I must remember to speak in a clear voice.

In two sepia rectangles, the renowned Droeshout portrait of
Shakespeare and the famous Gerard bust...

Â

The bust revolves slowly as a voice intones Shakespeareâs last
will.

The talking portrait speaks from the Stratford church wall:
through the open door of the church a blue cloak half conceals the
Non Sanz Droict
coat-of-arms.

Executive Mansion

May 4, 1863

N

ot long after my inauguration I
made a resolution to write something about my life. Writing, late at night, I
hoped to escape the pressures of the war and go back into time.

April 12, 1861 â at 4:30 a.m., the war began.

Thirty-nine days after my inauguration!

When I called for 75,000 volunteers, I thought hostilities
would end soon. I thought of many things in those trying days. There was the
terrible summer of â82, when wheat fields were swept by gunfire, 20,000
Confederates died, the Union lost 16,000. Boys, mostly boys. Which General woke
me during the night? Dark days, dark nights. The Army of the Potomac had
100,000 soldiers. Their losses and gains are part of me. Deserters, absentees,
spiesâeach is part of me. The wounded, the sick, the dying, the deadâthey are
part of me.

Oh, Traveler, why did you bring this war?

And Wall Street remembers this war! Fears it!

There seemed to be panic in rooms of this building.

The two years I have been here have taught me a great deal
about men and self.

Yet, now, now I will record my life though life surges
around Washington, though each one of us is sorely tried; we have read anew
lifeâs âgreat tragic volÂ­ume,â as John Adams called it. The pages lie open as
drums thud along the PoÂ­tomac.

Executive Mansion

May 7, 1863

North versus South, we have a population of 18 million
fighting a populaÂ­tion of 5 million, folly vs. folly, brother vs. brother,
Commander Lee vs. General Lee, Major Crittenden vs. General Crittenden.

Europeans assure me that my cause is a lost cause. They say
I will never eradicate slavery. The South says I will never end slavery because
it is an honorÂ­able way of life. Our Indian brothers have sided with the South.
But it is the cause of the Union that gives us strength, gives us right.

Union forever...flags...they wave yet do not heal...they
acclaim patriotism. But patriotism can blind us. It is a âwhirlwind,â as
Emerson reminds us. For my part, it is my oath to preserve and protect this
government of freedom for all men.

My convictions do not wane as cabinet members fail me. I am
firmly conÂ­vinced that tact can win against men who oppose, who are selfish or
temporarily deaf. I believe the citizenry understands me as I understand them,
as they pour into my office and talk with me.

May 19, 1863

I reaffirm myself.

I wish to tell that I was a man of the wilderness; I wish to
write about my mother, about my village of New Salem, my home in Springfield
with its maple trees. I see the sunlight in my office windows and it is also
the sunlight of my boyhood and youth.

Tomorrow night, with my lamps lit and candles on my desk, I
will begin to find out who I am.

I will begin to go back twenty years, thirty years, forty
years. Snow storms will batter our log cabin. I will recall what it was to go
hungry. I will try to fit toÂ­gether hours, days, nights. Iâll open the prairie schooner
of my brain.

I had requested the telegraph office: NO TELEGRAMS between
one and 5 a.m.

To commence my diary I will use lines I wrote a few years
ago for an Illinois newspaper.

May 20, 1863

I am six feet four inches tall and weigh one hundred and
eighty pounds. I am lean, muscular, have dark skin, coarse black hair and grey
eyes. My legs and arms are long; my hands are large; I wear a size 12 shoe.

I was put to work when I was about eight or nineâfarmed
out for 13 cents a day. I cut wood, mended fences, herded cattle, dug ditches.
At home, I milked our cow, lugged pails of water, cleaned slop, fed the stove.
Weather meant alÂ­most nothing to my family; we lived exactly like Indians in
our 3-sided cabin. We ate like Indiansâwhen we could. At times we said nothing
to each other for days on end that could be in any way construed as
interesting.

Executive Mansion

May 22, 1863

I was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My
parents were born in Virginia, of undistinguished familiesâsecond families,
perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a family of
the name of Hanks...

My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from
Virginia to Kentucky about 1781, where a year or two later he was killed by Indians,
not in battle, but by stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the
forest.

My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of
age, and he grew up literally without education. When I was eight he removed
from Kentucky to Indiana; we reached our new home about the time the state came
into the UnÂ­ion. It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals
still in the woods...

My father settled in an unbroken forest, and the clearing
away of surplus wood was the great task ahead. Though very young I had an ax put
in my hands...and from that, till within my twenty-third year, I was constantly
handling that useful instrument.

...A few days before the completion of my eighth year, in my
fatherâs absence, a flock of wild turkey approached our new log cabin. Standing
inside, I shot through a crack and killed one of them. I have never since pulled
a trigger on larger game.

I think that the aggregate of all my schooling did not
amount to one year. I was never in a college or academy as a student, and never
inside of a college or academy building till I had a law license. After I was
twenty-three and had sepaÂ­rated from my father, I studied English grammar. I
have studied and nearly mastered the six books of Euclid since I became a
member of Congress.

Executive Mansion

June 1, 1863

In the wilderness there were some schools, so called, but no
qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond âreadinâ, writinâ and
cipherinâ â to the rule of three. If a straggler, supposed to understand Latin,
happened to sojourn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There
was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course, when I came
of age I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to
the rule of three... The little advance I now have upon this store of education
I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity.

My father lived in Knob Creek, Kentucky; from this place he
removed to Spencer County, Indiana, in the autumn of 1816; I was eight. The
removal was partly on account of his resentment of slavery, but chiefly on
account of the difÂ­ficulty in acquiring legal land titles.

I became a sort of clerk in New Salem; I served as
postmaster; then came the Black Hawk War; I was elected a Captain of
volunteers, a success which gave me more freedom than any I have had since.

I went on the campaign, a campaign that led nowhere, except
to the dead, that row of eleven men, lying in the sun, each head neatly
scalped. I ran for legÂ­islature the same year (1832), and was beaten. It is the
only time I ever have been beaten by the people. The next and three succeeding
biennial elections I was elected to the state legislature.

As I rode horseback along the county roads something rode
with me, an inÂ­ner person. Beside the road, my horse browsing, I read a book. I
remember sitÂ­ting by a creek, listening to the frogs in the chill spring air;
there was that person, that inner force.

I knew that there was little or no chance for advancement in
this rural comÂ­munity unless it came through politics. So, politics had to
shine my shoes and buy my trousers. I would prove that honesty was appreciated
here. I would fit it into the crown of my hat.

June 5, 1863

It is a great piece of folly to attempt to make anything out
of my early life. It can be all condensed into a simple sentence, and that
sentence you will find in Greyâs
Elegy:
âThe short and simple annals of
the poor.â

And I add Greyâs lines for myself :

Far from the madding crowdâs ignoble strife

Their sober wishes never learned to stray;

Along the cool sequestered vale of life

They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

One more thought:

My mother was the illegitimate daughter of Lucy Hawks, and a
well-bred VirÂ­ginia farmer. God bless her; all that I am or ever hope to be I
owe to her. I beÂ­lieve that I inÂ­herited extra drive from her unfortunate
background. That drive stands me in good stead.

Executive Mansion

June 10, 1863

I have experienced death many times. My aunt, my uncle, my
brotherâs death. Then my motherâs death of milk sickness. Such suffering. I
whittled the pegs for her coffin. I can see her grave outside our cabin. I
could see it each time we opened the door. In the spring and often during the
summer I placed flowers on her grave. She loved lilacs and roses. Her kindness
lingers on. Friends called her a woodland madonna.

Later, when my step-mother came, her love was felt by each
one of us.

âLet me help you, Abe. Let me strain the milk
tonight...youâre tired. What a big stack of wood youâve cut for us, son. That
should last a while!â

She could handle an ax. She could lug a sack of flour. When
wolves howled, sheâd lean over me and say a few words or kiss my forehead. When
my shoulders ached she rubbed them with bear grease.

âIf I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to
take,â is a prayer she taught me.

Sometimes we planted pumpkin seeds together, on a nearby
slope. She was faster than I. Again and again, she urged me to attend school.
Each time we moved, she located the nearest schoolhouse. âYouâve got to go,
Abe.â I used to read to her.

She liked
Aesopâs

Fables
best. Weâd sit in the
evening sun and lean against the side of the cabin and I would read. We learned
the fables quickly. Her favorite fable was âThe Wolf and the Crane.â In those
days, my favorite was âThe Snake and a File.â

Often, when I am alone and tired, I remember the hot sun of
the prairie summer, how it seems to hold down everything as far as the eye can
see. I reÂ­member how it climbed almost every morningâlike a wheel.

I remember the squeaking of leather as my horse pulled his
plow; there was small corn growing nearby, in field after field. There were
birds.

There is a biting sense of loss, looking into the past: we
know this is someÂ­thing that can never take place again. We know, too, that we
can resurrect ourÂ­selves, sometimes pleasurably. Today, I esteem those glimpses
that reassure me, in spite of their passing. Without them I think life would be
so overcome by the present it would be difficult to continue living.

The better life should be everymanâs goal, a life that is
not eaten up by toil, a life where there is freedom for thought, freedom for
action. Men should be able to draw from the past; men should be able to
construct for the present, a plan. Man should have time to evolve for himself
and posterityâa heritage evoking pride leading to achievement that makes life
worth living.

Some of my happy days were passed in East Salem, when I was
an Illinois postmaster. Since the mail arrived only twice a week, I could
peruse the
Louisville

Journal
and the
Intelligencer.
I
think there were about twenty-five families living in Salem in those days. I
enjoyed delivering the mail personally; there was ample time to be friendly.
So, I stuffed the letters inside my hat and walked from house to house. I got
to know everybody that way. Summers were easy times. RememÂ­bering those summers
they seem to stretch in a long line, with groves and fishing spots here and
there.

I remember a huge boulder where I used to sit. Probably I
had delivered my last letter. A rabbit liked to sit near me. I would shut my
eyes and appreciate the greatness of life in the rabbit, in the trees around
me, in the windâthe greatness that existed in my motherâs life.

June 24, 1863

At the Burkesâ home, not far from the post office, I rented
a room. The Burkes, who are Quakers, a family of two, put themselves out for
me, and gave me an upstairs room with a lamp. At night I got out needle and
thread and mended my clothes, or, sitting in a leather chair, I read. Charles
Burke and I fashioned that chair.

He lent me pen and ink, and I was able to practice
penmanshipâcopying from a spelling book; it seemed great fun to me to spell out
words, so much easier than working with an ax. Mrs. Burkeâs tabby, grey and
fat, liked to keep me company, flipping a paw at the Mâs and Lâs.

In Salem I fell into debt.

When my partner died, my partner in the grocery business, I
assumed his inÂ­debtednessâ$1,000. It took me years to wipe out that sum, as
huge as the naÂ­tional debt. I shucked corn, cradled wheat, chopped wood,
ferryboated, clerked...$2.00 here, $5.00 here, $7.00 here. My debit column
required all of my scheming. While I struggled to pay that thousand dollars I
resolved to lay aside something as a cushion, but it was many years before I
could carry out that resolution. Those were pinching times.

Executive Mansion

June 25, 1863

At Number 4, Hoffmanâs Row, we had our law office, second
floor, a narrow room with a pair of elegant brass spittoons, a Pennsylvania
wood burning stove. High on the wall, above my desk, hung an engraving of
Benjamin Franklin. Our rough center table was usually overloaded with
documentsâlike some outlandÂ­ish mule. Legal books and newspapers filled
shelves. A narrow window faced the street; another window let in sunlight. The
elements washed them. The floor was bare oak but we had a fine assortment of
chairs. There was a lounge near the sunny window and I liked to stretch out
there, on the shaggy buffalo hide.

Billy Herndon and I had that shingle, good natured Billy.
Here we talked business, cockfights, women, and horse races. For sixteen years
we kept at it, learning, unlearning. For every stick of wood we burned in that
Pennsylvania stove we had an ardent opinion.

Billy and I earned about $3,000 or $4,000, good for a town
that already had eleven lawyers. Springfield, in those days, offered better
legal services than sideÂ­walks. Pigs in the streets, mud on our bootsâso it
went. We offered our services at all hours of the day. Often I never walked
home for lunch. When I rode cirÂ­cuit, Billy kept house. The wren that lived in
a box outside our door had a neater establishment than ours, but, she was not a
member of the state legislature.

The White House

July 3rd, 1863

During my political career, I have striven to be astute
where slavery is conÂ­cerned. The issue of slavery has been a sensitive one,
always difficult. Anti-slavery sentiment has been in existence no matter where
I lived, usually undercover. The Baptist preacher I listened to as a boy was
anti-slavery. I beÂ­lieved him. I saw blacks in chains, men and women. I soon
learned about the cruelty that menaced their lives, destroyed their lives; I
felt that I could, if I lived long enough, thwart slavery, perhaps abolish it,
make our great nation a free naÂ­tion. Patience, I repeated again and again to
myself. I knew about Linda Mae. She was bound to William Wison for ninety-nine
years. She was nineteen when that legal document was signed. When she reached
118 years she would be free. Patience?

Slavery was an old institution in Illinois, winked at in the
30âs and 40âs. The first governor of the state possessed slaves. I have seen
human beings herded and treated like animals. Our family moved from Kentucky,
troubled by the ways of slavery. My black clients sometimes confided in me,
described, underlined, the devious trickeries of the whites. Billy, my
Springfield barber, had tales to tell. I have heard them as he shaved me or
trimmed my hair.

I am slow to learn, and slow to forget. My mind is like a
piece of steelâvery hard to scratch anything on it, and almost impossible after
you get it there to rub it out.

Memories...it wasnât so long ago I tramped at the head of
the ox team, as we moved from one place to another, one beginning that had not
really ended, to another beginning that might not end. The oxen were faithful.
They meant much to me. I will not forget. They ate from my hands, they blew
their breaths on my fingers, they regarded me intently. It rained on us. The
sun shone on us.

July 11, 1863

Was it twenty or thirty years ago, we drifted down the
Mississippi, three of us on a loaded flatboat? She was well overloaded because
all of us wanted to get rich quick. The second or third day on the river, a
tornado-like storm struck us; I thought we would lose more than our cargo. Down
went the stern, down went the bow. I thought lightning would strike us. My
friends, John H___ and John J___ , were experienced river men. With luck we
made it. In New Orleans, we sold both cargo and flatboat, and returned home by
sternwheeler.

Memoriesâone of the most vivid is the New Orleansâ slave
auction: men and women for the highest bidder. How much is my mother worth? I
asked myÂ­self. How much is my father? My Uncle James? Two women were sold while
I watched at the corner of a busy street. Two women, then three men were sold.
Were they friends, relatives? Did they speak our language? Where were they
taken? One of the men in New Orleans left the auction stand in handcuffs. The
women rode away in fancy buggiesâfaces haggard.

I have never had to summon a jury in defense of freedom. No
court can deÂ­fend slavery if men are honorable.

Tuesday evening

Late

As the months pass, as troubles increase, I hunt for moments
from yesterday, moments that may strengthen me, moments that may prove I was
once young. There is my Ann Rutledge. I see her auburn hair, blue eyes and
delicate faceâmore than ephemera. My love for her is real, apart, unrelated to
the man I am, yet rememberedâa contradiction. Although it is a lie I feel that Ann
is alive.

I allowed my burden of debts to turn me away from marriage.
I believed that frontier hardships were to remain my lot; I could not see
harnessing her to a life of animal drudgery. Debts...they were like bars in a
gate; I peered through those bars at her beautiful face.

We buried her among currant bushes, in the wind, in the sun.
I left the cemetery to wander through hungry woodlands, woodlands I never saw
again, that extended...I donât know how far they extended. Hunger and
sorrow...they were mine.

All that remains of our brief relationship is the memory of
her voice, as she spoke, as she sang. She loved to sing hymns and frontier
songsâher voice so feminine.

The touch of her hand, the touch of her voice...in the
midst of war, under desperate commitments.

Evening

We were to enroll. Ann was to enroll at Jacksonville
Academy. I was to enroll at Illinois College.

That year I called on her at the Rutledge farm, several
times. We worked toÂ­gether in the fields. When she worked at Jim Shortâs farm,
I rode over to be with her. I helped her with the chores. Swampy place.

August came, hot, dry August. Corn was stunted that year.
Few martins and swallows were around. But malaria was around and put me down, a
day, two days, three. I sipped Peruvian barkâjalap. Late that month, her father
sent for me.

Valued brother, come, Ann is very ill.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  D. H. Rutledge.

I still have that message.

She lay on her bed, feverish; the log house seemed to be
claiming her; she put her small hands in mine; her corn silk hair was around her
face. In two days she was gone. We buried her in Concord, seven miles away,
seven miles to walk beÂ­hind her coffin.

It was many weeks, many weeks and miles of walking, before I
recovered, out of that grey mystery.

I still write to her family. I want to know how the
Rutledges are faring.

White House

In wagons, on foot, on horseback, they stream west, for the
gold rush, for the promises. Ours is a migratory urge. Flux of men, women,
children, reapers, sowers, which comes first? Which the most important? We
Americans expropriÂ­ate, accomplish, destroy. The rough rock becomes polished by
time, but do we? Can such migrations achieve a true union?

I realize there is a power larger than self, more powerful
than leadership. It is this mysterious power that causes this human wave. It is
not destiny. It is an interchange of ideas, a wave or waves of emotion, a
desire for bettermentâand beyond that! The pioneer has this in his mind, as he
hacks at timber, removes stumps, sprouts corn. Deep inside me, like a blue pool,
I am in accord with these frontiersmen.

In Springfield, when problems got under my skin, I sometimes
woke at night, puzzled, thinking where am I? Iâd find myself sitting up in bed,
gesturing, talking to myself. Alarmed, I would dress and lay a fire and sit by
it the remainder of the night, sit by the stove or go out into the backyard, if
it was summer or autumn.

Melancholia has always dogged me. It seems to sit inside of
me and peer out. It catches me, involves me, at the most unexpected moments.
Melancholy influÂ­ences my decisions, legal decisions or those at home, even
while I am playing with the children. Like any physical handicap I try to live
with it, minimize it.

Springfield problems were largely legal problems, problems
for Billy and me, problems about horse thieves, mortgage foreclosures, defaults
in payment, land titles. I lost a manslaughter case but won my defense of the
nine women inÂ­volved in rioting. I had a bevy of widows trail after me when I
won the case of the man accused of robbing the mail of $15,000.

Such problems create a backwash over the years; I see now
that on my circuit I avoided home very frequently, staying away two or three
weeks at a time. Marital bliss and melancholia are known to be mates.

Executive Mansion

8/9/63

For years I was haunted by a great number of things. First,
it was essential to learn to read. Then to write. To find work that would
support me. I wished to help others. I felt that there was more to life than brute
labor. I found friends. Honesty appealed. I was not impressed by rowdies.
Serving as Captain in the Black Hawk War taught me that causes are not always
good causes. Scalped men are not helpful men.

I can not forget those men lying in the bush, lying in a
row, red sunlight on them.

My father was a slave to ignorance.

My mother was a slave to the wilderness.

I longed to abolish all kinds of slavery.

Some of my black friends were slaves; I wanted to abolish
their kind of slavÂ­ery. There is the slavery of poverty. Men and women eating
potatoes day after day.

So, I was haunted.

Could I become manâs benefactor?

Lying in my attic, on my bed of corn shocks, I confronted
log wallsâ- strong log walls.

August 9, 1863

On my circuit rides, when weather favored, when there was
enough time, I stopped at a grove, dismounted, walked to a tree deep in the
grove, a tree I had blazed when county surveying; I walked on to the second
blaze that marked a green pool. It was a small shallow pool rimmed with short
grass. Dragonflies came there. Crickets lived near there. Standing there,
sitting there, I found meaning, a meaning I still respect.

Tell me, ye winged winds

That round my pathway roar,

Do ye not know some spot

Where mortals weep no more?

The White House

August 12, 1863

I suppose I may as well confess: I have always envied my
partner his marital luck: Billy Herndon married Nancy Maxcy, back in â40, a
quiet beauty, a gentle beauty, blonde as corn silk, ready with dreamy smiles.
She gave Billy rare personal happiness, made it easier for him after annoying
legal squabbles, after long circuit rides. She gave him six healthy children.
She was a giver in so many waysâalms for all. Theirs has been a continual
romance.

The mind does tricks. I am back in my boyhood cabin. A prairie
schooner stands outside. A man and woman have unhitched their oxen team, their
little girl is made to feel at home by my mother. She is eight; I am eight or nine,
I canât remember. I remember that she was pretty. We played together all day.
Then, came sunup, the ox team hauled away the schooner...my love was gone. I
dreamed about her for weeks, happy dreams; in one of those repeated dreams we
eloped, we went to California, we built a beautiful home...

My love for her has never gone away.

August 14, 1863

Many times Jenny plodded my rural circuit.

Usually, I gave her the reins. Every stopping place, store,
tavern, church, saÂ­loon, school, was fixed in her brain. If I had to check her
it was for some washÂ­out, new ruts in the road, a downhill run, a flooded
creek. As we plodded along I read my law books or played the harmonica. June,
July, August...January and February, we rocked in that black buggy with its
scarlet spokes. I kept it in good shape but I never did eliminate the squeaks
in the right rear spring.

In those days prosperity was slow in arriving. I settled my
cases under trees, in churches, in schools and storesâfor barter and for cash.

Mary never neglected my food hamper; always something tasty,
with an apple or a carrot or two tossed in for Jenny. We would stop in a patch
of woods on a hot day; I would yank off my boots and rest my corns.
Thunderstorms often fell on us; at the nearest stable I would rub Jenny until
she was dry, and she would look and look at me as I rubbed her.

Willie liked to accompany me on our summer jaunts; he got to
know the lone dead pine; the maple grove at Dobsonâs Creek; he knew the
roosting place of the red hawk, the place of the squirrels. We often saw fox
and deer. I might read Fennimore Cooper to him as we rode along.

â...Papa, look at those pigeons...a whole cloud of them.â

Willieâs favorite topic was the railroad, the locomotives.
He knew every type of engine, their speed, their horsepower. âWonder horses,â
he called them.

âAll aboard,â he would shout, as we got into our buggy.
âLetâs go...the IndiÂ­ans are cominâ.â

Who owns Jenny now?

Where is she?

Sheâs about eleven years old.

Glancing through a Greek history, I found something
Euripides said in one of his plays:

Slavery, that thing of evil, by its nature evil,

forcing submission from man to what no man should yield to.

To set men freeâthat is the greatest goal any man could
achieve.

But slavery is part of our issue. This is essentially a
peopleâs contest. On the side of the Union is a struggle for maintaining in the
world that form and subÂ­stance of government whose leading object is to elevate
the condition of men; to lift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear
the paths of laudable pursuit for all; to afford all an unfettered start and a
fair chance in the race of life.

Tuesday

I like to forget East Salemâs juvenility, sparring, boxing,
wrestling. Pranks could be alarmingly stupid. There was Ike and his pony. He
was fool enough to try to ride his piebald through a bonfire of shavings and
cornstalksâto settle a bet. He raced across a field toward the blaze; just as
he reached it, the pony bucked and pitched Ike into the fire. The onlookers
stomped and roared and whistled. I was angry and took Ike to Dr. Samuelâs office,
where the doctor shaved his head and salved his scorched face and hands.

I saw no profit, no form of progress in Salemâs rowdies. I
preferred the simple things in life, a job, a long walk, hills, sun. As county
surveyor I commuÂ­nicated through transit and tapes, through timberland acreage.
They arranged life in useable proportions. This was a function beyond the
village. To measure land was to measure the future. Precision spelled
confidence.

September 1, 1863

To give the victory to the right, not through bloody bullets
but through peaceful ballotsâthis is essential. Our constitution proves that
the ballot can rule. Right-thinking men shall go to the polls, without fear or
prejudice.

I think these thoughts, I write these words, as men attack,
counterattack, reÂ­treat, die. Hate and bitterness are in control. I raise my
spyglass and look through my window. A small sailboat moves along the Potomac.
It is possible for a man to provision a boat, set sail, disÂ­appear. It is
possible for a man to work with other men and achieve.

September 2, 1863

A drum corps passes the White House.

I listen.

I must ask myself some questions this evening: must
civilization be influÂ­enced by greedy politicians, connivers, self-promoters,
toadies? Is there such a thing as common sense where the bulk of mankind is
concerned? Is Christianity a bulwark to be counted on, or is it cleverly
concocted pretension? Must tragedy dog manâs footsteps? Does a lie have a more
lasting influence than the truth? Do the echoes of John Brown end? Is the Dred
Scott case on trial, decade after decÂ­ade?

These and other questions flog my mind.

Men say I am moody, they say I am a man of mystery. If I am
mysterious at times it is because I seek answers. I demand answers. Only fools
accept the face of things. Men weary of my tales and my humor as I hunt for
enlightenment for this troubled country. It is my duty to care more than
anyone, and humor and satire have an influence not to be scorned.

The White House

September 15, 1863

If I were home my fat Filibuster would shove his whiskers
into my face and meow. He loved to be scratched...he was Robertâs pet but when
I lay on the floor of the parlor to read he would stretch out beside me. Iâd
scratch him and try to go on with my reading.

I would like to have supper tonight in my shirt sleeves, and
answer the doorÂ­bell in my carpet slippers.

I would like to hear Mary scolding the iceman, as he
tries, once more, to overÂ­charge her.

How well she managed our house, penny-wise always. How well
she attended the children. She found time to help the poor; was never too busy
to chat with a neighbor.

âLetâs see a play tonight. Thereâs that new one,
A ForÂ­tune
to Share
. Shall we go?â

I see myself puttering in the yard. There was time to prune
the trees, to cut wood, plant flowers. The horse and cow were part of our
lives. I was another man then.

I wonder what happened to my grey hat; it had a wide band
inside, fine for stuffing letters and checks. Maybe Billy has it, hanging on
the tree, at the back of our office.

The White House

Evening

Throughout that long, dry summer, Stephen Douglas and I
battled our verbal battles. There was a noble pertinacity in the âLittle
Giant.â I called him a âslanÂ­dererâ and a âsneak.â He dubbed me a âfraud,â and
alluded to pro-slavery conÂ­spiracies. He attacked my âhouse dividedâ stand... I
insisted that a nation could not endure half-free, half-slave.

Douglas had his private car, bannered and flagged. A
handsome brass cannon boomed from a flatcar coupled to his train, boomed his
entry into every town and city. Often our debates were veritable picnics,
fireworks, bands. I rode on a Conestoga drawn by six white horses...bunting...
flowers...pretty girls. Sometimes a secretary recorded our speeches.

As the summer wore on, I began to stress the moral issues
with great emphaÂ­sis. I had little hope that I would win the senate seat; my
voice, pitched higher than his, also lacked accomplished delivery. The silent
artillery of time was firing at us. I heard the countryâs slaves crying out. I
remembered that John Randolph said that slavery was âa volcano in full
eruption.â

Votes...but it is not altogether a matter of votes.

Yet the day of reckoning arrived.

Douglas â 54.Â Â Â Â  Lincoln â 46.

So I lost.

It will be hard to die and leave the country no better than if
I had never lived.

September 29th, 1863

My Desk

I may remark that having in my life heard many argumentsâor
strings of words meant to pass for argumentsâintended to show that the negro
ought to be a slaveâif he shall now fight in the Confederate Army to keep
himself a slave, it will be a far better argument why he should remain a slave
than I have ever heard before.

Perhaps he ought to be a slave if he desires it ardently
enough to fight for it. Or, if one out of four will, for his own freedom, fight
to keep the other three in slavery, he ought to be a slaver for his selfish
meanness.

I have always thought that all men should be free; but if
any should be slaves, it should be first those who desire it for themselves,
and secondly those who desire it for others. Whenever I hear anyone arguing for
slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.

Once again, we ask: what is freedom?

Individually, it is a chance to worship or not worship, it
is a chance to earn a living, to raise a family, examine the past, improve
oneâs intellect, guard oneâs health. It is also an opportunity to perfect
national and international law. CerÂ­tainly, freedom should not be a code but
should emphasize, in every respect, human values. Millions in our land lack
freedom. This condition must not conÂ­tinue. Education is the sure route toward
freedom.

Thursday

My Desk

If A can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right,
enslave B, why may not B snatch the same argument and prove equally, that he
may enslave A? You say A is white and B is black. It is
color
then; the
lighter, having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule you
are to be a slave to the first man you meet with a fairer skin than your own.

You do not mean
color
exactly? You mean the whites
are
intellectually
the supeÂ­riors of the blacks, and, therefore have the
right to enslave them? Take care again. By this rule you are to be the slave to
the first man you meet with an inÂ­tellect superior to your own. But, say you,
it is a question of
interest;
and if you can make it your
interest,

you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can make it his
interest, he has the right to enslave you.

I hear rifle fire in the night.

October 4, 1863

This rainy evening I take up my pen again.

There are no accidents in my philosophy. Every effect must
have its cause. The past is the cause of the present, and the present will be
the cause of the fuÂ­ture. All these are links in the endless chain stretching
from the infinite to the finite.

Probably it is to be my lot to go on in a twilight, feeling
and reasoning my way through life, as questioning, doubting Thomas did. But in
my poor, maimed, withered way bear with me as I go on seeking for a faith that
was with him of olden times, who exclaimed âHelp thou my unbelief.â

I do not see that I am more astrayâthough perhaps in a
different direcÂ­tionâthan others whose points of view differ widely from each
other in the sectarian denominations. They all claim to be Christians, and
interpret their sevÂ­eral creeds as infallible ones. I doubt the possibility, or
propriety, of settling the religion of Jesus Christ in the models of man-man
creeds and dogmas.

It was a spirit in the life that He laid stress on and
taught, if I read aright. I know I see it to be so with me... The fundamental
truths reported in the four Gospels as from the lips of Jesus, and that I first
heard from the lips of my mother, are settled and fixed moral precepts with me.
I have concluded to disÂ­miss from my mind the debatable wrangles that once
perplexed me with distracÂ­tions that stirred up but never absolutely settled
anything. I have tossed them aside with the doubtful differences which divide
denominations. I have ceased to follow such discussions or be interested in
them. I cannot without mental reserÂ­vations assent to long and complicated
creeds and catechisms.

The White House

I had a visitor this morning who needed to be reassured. He
is a trembling old man from Arkansas, a local politician. After spelling out
some good news for his benefit I told him this anecdote... I think it worked
very well...

An eccentric old bachelor lived in the Hoosier state and was
famous for seeÂ­ing big bugaboos in everything. He lived with an elder brother
and one day went out hunting. His brother heard him firing back in the
cornfield and went out to see what was the matter. He found him loading and
firing into the top of a tree. Not being able to disÂ­cover anything in the
tree, he asked his brother what he was firing at. âA squirrel,â the man said,
and kept on firing. His brother thought there was some humbug about the matter
and looked him over carefully and found a big louse crawling about on one of
his eyelashes.

Executive Mansion

October 12, 1863

After my nomination Springfield filled with ox carts, wagons,
buggies, horsemen, trainloads of folk. Fifty-thousand poured into my little
town. Hordes jammed the street in front of my house, yelling âSpeech...speech!â

I greeted them, said a few words, joked.

Reporters swarmed around me. Friends came and went. I forgot
to stable the horse, forgot to milk the cow. Mary scolded me for forgetting my
supper.

Tad got lost in the crowd.

Wind blew, dust blew.

It seems very amusing to me now. Unreal.

Streets were lit with burning tar barrels and torches.
People sang, paraded the streets.

â

Ole Abe
Lincoln came out of the wilderness,

Out of the wilderness, out of the wilderness...â

I turned in mighty late that night, yet singers were still
singing, singing âGenÂ­tle Annieâ and other favorites.

October 13, 1863

Before leaving for Washington, I went to my office to say
good-bye to Billy Herndon. It wasnât easy climbing that stair. It was difficult
to say good-bye to my old partner and friend. I gathered up some books and
papers and laid them on the big table. I stretched out on the old couch, with
the buffalo robe under me.

âHow long have we been working together, Billy?â

âOver sixteen years,â he replied.

âWeâve never had a cross word all that time, have we?â

He nodded.

âThatâs right.â

I asked him to retain our old shingle, on its rusty hinges.

âIf I live, Iâll be coming back, and then weâll go on as if
nothing had ever happened.â

At the bottom of the stairs, we shook hands.

In keeping with my philosophy I felt certain that I would
never return to Springfield.

October 21, 1863

White House

Library

The unfinished dome on the White House continues to trouble
me. The inÂ­completion has become a symbol. I peer through its maw and it seems
a war wound. When will it be finished? And when it has been completed will the
union of the North and South begin? A carpenter tips his hat: âGood morning,
Mr. President.â Throughout the morning I have heard hammers and saws. Patience,
I tell myself. A wise man invented patience. The emancipation of man will reÂ­quire
great patience.

It is pleasant writing in the library. I will return again.

Here is a book, on my desk, entitled
Sparta
. I beÂ­lieve
that the Spartans were often respected for their courage.

What is it men fear most? Death?

Ten men will have ten answers.

From the days of the Spartans men have floundered over
freedomâspelling it a hundred different ways! The Iroquois had their idea of
freedom. The Pilgrim had his. The blacks. The list can go on and on.

Freedom and death... I see they have an ugly affinity.

Nov 1st â 63

The Library

As far back as I can remember I have always watched over my
dollars. In Springfield I knew what each monthâs expenses amounted to. During
my sixteen-year partnership with Billy Herndon, our agreement was fifty-fifty.
There never were any problems. Though it is miles to Springfield, I can summon
figÂ­ures. Our last year together, Billy and I earned $2,300 each. We had 63 cases
at $10.00 each; we had 20 at $15.00 each, etc. Twenty or twenty-five brought in
$5.00. Apart from these combined earnings I added about $1,200 on my prairie circuits.
This is a singular improvement over 31Â¢ a day at farm labor. As farm hand I
earned about $100.00 a year, eliminating thunder and lightning, hail, sore
muscles, broken ax handles, corns, a chronic failure on the part of farmers to
pay their promised payments. City lamplighters do better.

Few in this capitol have ever enjoyed the intimacy old Jenny
and I shared, buggy-sharing, spelled out with faithful grunts, special ear
signals and soft nuzÂ­zlings. No, it wasnât always money-concern for me. Another
asset was Billyâs libraryâhis Kant, Locke, Spencer, Volney, and Emerson.

Another virtue, one that is very difficult to spell out,
Billy kept my inkwell full.

November 12, 1863

Evening

Today has been a day of war problems. Telegrams
contradict telegrams. In my bedroom I opened my Shakespeare to
Julius

Caesar:

There is a tide in the affairs of men

Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;

Omitted, all the voyage of their life

Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

On such a full sea are we now afloat,

And we must take the current when it serves,

Or lose our ventures.

Where is there finer counsel for me?

Foremost in my mind is the termination of this war, the
abolishing of black servitude, the welding of our statehood. A triple goal!

Saturday

I
used to wash in an iron keeler, scrubbing hard after plowing or splitting
rails. Saturday was scrub night.

Here, at the Executive Mansion, the pretentious bathrooms
trouble me. There are thousands of neglected, hungry folk. It is a presidentâs
obligation to assist those in need.

For
all concerned there have been more favored times; as a people we are trapped
between violence and the mending of that violence; in spite of our beÂ­wilderment
we reach out.

I can not say grace any longer. I have tried. I stumble. I
can not express my thanks for food when men are hungry. When whole communities
are hungry, when death stalks our nation. If I am fortunate I may be fortunate
at anotherâs expense, anotherâs disadvantage.

Tomorrow, I will saddle Old Abe. I will shove my new
Wordsworth book into my saddlebag and ride into the country, along the Potomac.
I will eat dry corn bread. I will lie in deep grass and read, all day.

Nov 20, â63

Early

I prefer art that pictures a Niagara or a lofty mountain
range at sunset or a tall vase full of flowers. I donât go for the painting of
facesâportraits. The painting done by Francis Carpenter troubles me; for one
thing I wish he would remove it from the dining room where he has excellent chandelier
light. Of course I can not find time to sit for him during the day. And all those
faces on his canvas are so dull, such solemn faces; seven dull men surround me
as I sign the EmancipaÂ­tion Proclamation. People, looking at those men, will
think ill of us. At dinner, if the painting is still in the dining room, I face
away from it. Carpenter says he will take the picture on a national tour. I
believe that is an error.

Monday evening

Fireplace fire

Where are sexual malpractices focused?

Let me indicate:

In 1850 there were 405,523 mulattoes. Very few of these are
the offspring of white and free blacks; nearly all have sprung from black
slaves and white masÂ­ters. In the same year, there were 56,649 mulattoes in the
free states; but for the most part they were not born thereâthey came from the slave
states. During this year, the slave states had 348,847 mulattoes, all of home
production.

The White House

Since no man is born president of his country, he must cross
a difficult bridge between home and capitol. Crossing it, he is involved in
national issues and problems he could not anticipate. About him is a sea of new
faces; he must remember each; he must remember names; he must define
personalities as quickly and as intelligently as possible.

Following my inauguration, Fort Sumter, at Charleston, was
bombarded; within six weeks state secession had begun. âSecession is
revolution,â I reminded my dissatisfied fellow countrymen. Grim cabinet
meetings took place; telegram followed telegram; I soon realized that months of
decision and indecision lay ahead. I saw it would be months before I could
control my own house.

Needing friends, I reached out and found a few; needing
wisdom, I made mistakes. My office window showed me an alien river; there were
more than thirty rooms in the White House, rooms and sounds. And the sounds
were more often drum beats, slow beats, suggesting caution, intimating death.

FORT SUMTER FALLEN.
Commander

Anderson

SurrenÂ­ders.
April 14, 1861, Fort
Sumter, located in the harbor of Charleston, S. C., surrendered yesterday,
after 34 hours of Confederate bombardment. The 100 survivors, without food and
ammunition... 75,000 Union men called up...

I have lost that newspaper clipping but I can repeat the
tragic news word-for-word, words that shocked our entire country! That left us
embattled! Now, I can not, will not, review in detail the warâs progress. Must
each battle fought on the battlefield be fought again here? I want this diary
more man than history. If that is possible.

W. H.

November 29, 1863

Last year, on May second, I began the banishment of
international slave trade. Congress appropriated the sum of $900,000 to aid in
its suppression. Five ships have been captured at sea and the slaves on board
those vessels have been returned to Liberia.

Now, an American ship, the
Erie
, out of Portland, has
been captured off the West African coast, and 893 slaves have been liberated.
Captain Gordon has been hung for his crime. To bring even greater pressure and
afford greater sucÂ­cess, my Secretary of State has negotiated a successful
Anti-Slave Treaty with England. On April 24th, 1862, this treaty was ratified
by the Senate. It was a disÂ­tinct pleasure to have the Secretary congratulate
me warmly. Our eradication of slave trade has been a marked success.

Henceforth, the blackbirders will find slave trade dangerous
and unprosperÂ­ous, with both the United States and England patrolling the seas.

If I accomplish nothing more than this, my White House term
will be worthwhile. Although it is 2 a.m. and chillyâI must celebrate. I have
rung the kitchen for a bowl of soup and some crackers.

November 30

Late

It has been difficult to find a few hours alone. To sit in
my chair by the fireplace...that privilege comes only now and then. I think I
will write an item for the papers, to increase morale, to lessen the influence
of detractors. I will begin it...

Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith
dare to do our duty...

White House

December 5

Tonight I wish I could eat an apple but there does not seem
to be one in the White House. Peaches and applesâthey are my favorites, eaten
in front of a fireplace. What an appetite I used to have. I used to think that
the best food in the world was bread and honeyâhoney in the comb on plain
bread.

I rang the kitchen for a bowl of popcorn.

Pretty soon that Greek goddess of the Potomac, little Miss
Rosie, who is the perfect mulatto, traipsed in, holding the green bowl she
loves, balancing it on a silver tray, the tray she thinks belonged to George
Washington.

âHeah you is, Mistaaaa President...popcohnnnn, wid plenty a
fresh-churned buttaaaah.â

Miss Rosie did a curtsy and smiled and that smile of hers
made me happier than the popcorn because it told me that before long the war
would be over and people like Rosie would be treated like any white woman.

Sunday

1863

A president is not permitted to have smallpox but I have a
mild case, nonetheless. Bed is a poor spot to keep up a diary. What can I say, this
Wednesday? That I have been reading Shakespeare? I have not. That I have read
the newspapers? I have not. During bouts of fever I let myself return to other
days; I see a woman in a log cabin bending over an open fire. I smell bacon
frying. Deep in the night I hear a hermit thrush. Its sorrowful sound assumes
great beauty. I have a feeling I am in the wilderness, that wilderness almost
Christ-like, benefiÂ­cent.

December 12, â63

Desk

Documents. My pigeonholes are bulging.

In a few days I will feel all right.

I miss our green-shuttered house in Springfield. It seems
much farther than 1700 miles away, and it seems more than nineteen years since
we bought itâback in â44. We Lincolns were proud of that home. I liked the
fireplace in the parlor on snowy nights. I liked the comfortable rockers and
the black hair settee. Mary worked hard to sew and tailor the drapes. Her
touches were everywhere. Yet, when we moved to Washington, she ruled out
everything that was personal.

âLeave things...till we return.â Then we rented our place.
What will it be when we do return?

And she threw away a pair of my old boots.

Willie, Bob and Ted packed their toys, kites, drums, bats.
How Willie stormed when he was told he could not take every single toy.

When Mary and I married, I had three words engraved on her
wedding rings:
Love is Eternal.

I
had not reckoned with death.

Evening

I would like to have opportunities for meditation. Surely
the bettering of life has to come from within. I would like to steal an hour or
two every day. The only time I can steal is at night, when the White House is
wrapped in memories. Then, candle or lamp beside, a fire in the fireplace, I
hunt for inner balance. PerÂ­haps the candles go out. Perhaps the fire goes out.
I wait for connections, maybe wilderness connections or connections with the
prairie, connections with perceptions that can become new. I may be able to use
those perceptions in my day-to-day.

Library

This evening I have re-read some Volney, that old French
scholar and travÂ­eler; this analysis strikes me forcibly:

Man in his blindness has riveted
his own chains, and surrendered himself forever, without defense, to the sport
of his ignorance and passions. To disÂ­solve such fatal chains, a miraculous
concurrence of happy circumstances would be necessary: a whole nation, cured of
the delirium of superÂ­stition, must be inaccessible to the impulse of
fanaticism...this people should be couÂ­rageous and prudent...

Sound advice for these times! When are we prudent? What,
beside the pasÂ­sage of time, years of peace, will evolve prudence? Is war a
kind of superstition? I have thought so. Certainly it is a delirium.

I see the Library has a copy of Volneyâs
Travels in Syria
and Egypt
. I have asked for a copy.

Evening

In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the
young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them unawares. The older
have learned to ever expect it.

The Anns and the boys with their Bibles.

The White House

As I study the office wall map of the war zones I am
afflicted by partial blindness. The name Fredericksburg blurs. I hear myself
saying: I have made a covent to free the slaves. I hear General McClellan say:
âWe must declare a truce to bury our dead.â Alexandria, Fairfax, Sharpsburg,
Harperâs Ferry, Spotsylvania. That peculiar blindness continues, focuses now on
faces I have loved, her face, the face of a friend in Springfield, the stairway
leading to my law office, my children playing on the street in front of my
home, riding in their little red wagon...

I am not a cartographer of war; however I surpass some of my
gallant miliÂ­tary officers. Their logistics have led to useless slaughter.
Hellish bungling, I call it. But that blindness intrudes: I am surveying a
piece of property near Salem, it seems.

What if this was a map of the entire world? What if I were
in command? What then?

I hear my mother speak to me:

âAbe, shall we go out now and plant those squash seeds?â

W.H.

How are we to establish labor relations in the North and in
the South? I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails under which
laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to work under
all circumstances, and are not tied down and obliged to labor whether you pay
them or not! I like the system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish
it might prevail everyÂ­where. In mill and cottonfield there has to be a leveling,
hours, pay, conditions. We have to regulate a work week.

The White House

December 16, 1863

Thomas Jefferson was a great man, but no great American
keeps slaves, and Jefferson had two hundred. Call it custom, excuse it as
custom; yet not every wealthy man kept slaves.

I admire the Adams family: their racial integrity stands
out, their intelligent diplomacy. The relationship with foreign nations is
often a delicate one; the Adams succeededâtheir statesmanship stands out.

Recently men have asked me to comment about George
Washington. I declined. I sympathize with his problems but I can not get deeper
into the man. History does not always afford us ample means for fair judgment.

Thirty-three states oppose eleven states in this conflict.
If I were to ask a citiÂ­zen of Europe which entity he might support I think the
answer would be the state group with the largest population and greatest
wealth, surmising that these advantages would bring about a definite resolution.
However, in this conflict, the gamble is also a moral gamble. With this moral
issue in mind we must pursue a sane course of action for everyone in this
country, a course of action that must embody prolonged patience.

The White House

December 29, â63

I met Harriet Beecher Stowe the other day, and liked her. We
sat in front of my white fireplace and she said she loved a fireplace, and I
said I liked one tooâthat we had a couple of them at home. She said she wrote a
lot of her
Uncle

Tom
in front of her fireplace; then she asked me
friendly questions about Springfield, the people, the town.

I shared my conviction that writing has a lasting influence.
I tried to make her realize what books have meant to me. I am afraid I
reminisced too much about what I had read. She nodded very pleasantly and did
not say much; wrapped in a blue shawl she seemed more like a tired housewife
than a person dedicated to writing and the rights of man.

I told her how I used to do my three râs before our cabin
fireplace. Silence came between us. In spite of myself I forgot my guest; I
could see a long road in summertime; I was walking along that road; I had
borrowed Weems and stopped to read; I sat down on a culvert; a frog appeared;
there were trees, fields of grass, yet I was in the midst of history.

When she rose to say âgood-byeâ I was startled.

January 4th, 1864

T

oday I visited the stables and talked to Old Abe. As
usual, he was pleased to see me. I offered him a handful of oats, and he bobbed
his head. The sun was warm in the stall. I stood by, as Abe munched. I could
believe that he knew I was thanking him for my escape yesterday.

My hat is lying on my bedâa bullet hole right through the
crown. A good hat. If Abe hadnât bolted someone might have shot again. We were
lucky it was growing dark, Abe and I.

I offered him more oats.

Stablemen were arriving. Bill Slade appeared.

âGood mawninâ, Mistah President. How is you this mawninâ?â

A fine person, Bill Sladeâfrom Kentucky.

I must give away that telltale hat. It cost me eight
dollars. Certainly, Mary must never find it; that would mean severe hysteria.

I have been considering the purchase of a taller horse. No,
Old Abe will serve me. I must shorten the stirrups. I appreciate his easy
gaits. Gentlenessâsomething hard to come by these days.

Desk

William SewardâI wanted to call him Will, wanted to bridge
the gap that exists between us, a gap some three years wide. As my Secretary of
State he has assisted the government through his foreign diplomacy; as an
ardent anti‑slave man he has successfully blocked the Confederacy through
foreign influence. As governor of New York he left an enviable record; as
senator he is above reÂ­proach. With his friendly Irish spirit, he has favored
Irish immigration. With his eye on the presidency he has not spared me.

As friend of Jefferson Davis and his wife, I have had to
work to allay suspiÂ­cions, suspicions that have proved ungrounded. Sewardâs eye
on the presidency will continue beyond my stay in the White House. He has an
intense desire to improve our nation, to push on; I admire his faith in tomorrow.
Unfortunately, he has not always manifested political balance. When he
suggested an all-out war with Europe, to force an amalgamation of North and
South, I was utterly nonÂ­plussed.

Trainer of Arabian horses, owner of Arabian horses, breeder
of Arabians, Seward is many things. He is sixty, has white hair, slouches,
swears, smokes ciÂ­gars. When asked by an hysterical officer, when Washington
was threatened with invasion at the time I took office, âWhat shall I fire
at?,â Seward responded coolly: âFire at the crisis!â

One winterâs afternoon, Louis Agassiz drove up to the White
House, with his brilliant wife, Elizabeth. A Swiss-American, he speaks English
with a marked but disÂ­tinguished accent. We three had a long walk through the
December garden and our conservatory, and he emphasized the value of studying
from nature. Bustling to his carriage, parked on the driveway, he returned with
his four-volume study,
Natural History of the United States.
He was
pleased to present it to meâand inscribed the first volume. Elizabeth did her
best to enlighten me on scientific points since I have never studied the
sciences, a brief elementary course, I might call it. I found the two
remarkable. When I can, I dip into his
History.

Later, he sent his
Recherches sur les poissons fossiles,

this study in French. I have bequeathed it to the Library.

The visit of this pair has shown me depths that lie in
Europeâdepths I must explore.

Executive Mansion

1/14/64

I reviewed my Emancipation Proclamation to the best of my
ability. Lights were on, the house quiet. Rain streaked the windows. I wanted
to re-test each word, wholly for myself. In these troubled times I must rescue
something for myself.

Thus:

...I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,
order and deÂ­clare that all persons held as slaves are forever free. The
Executive Government, including the military and naval authority, will
recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons...

I enjoin all people to abstain from violence. I evoke the
considerate judgment of mankind...

Forever

free.

Those words still ring in my mind.

As I signed, I remembered slaves, slaves in a slave depot,
slaves on a barge, slaves on a Kentucky plantation; I remembered the dead and
the dying, brother against brother; I thought about pillaged homes, families in
rags. I saw. I stared at the Proclamation and saw.

Now, as I sit at my desk, it seems to me that I have been
guided by experiÂ­ence. My presidency has been justified. It seems to me, in all
calmness, in objecÂ­tivity, I have placed a permanent seal on the ages.

Later

In Boston there have been two mammoth celebrations.
Longfellow, Whittier, Emerson and politicos attended. Harriet Beecher Stowe
came. Beethovenâs
Fifth

Symphony
was played.

Throughout the nation, in small towns and hamlets there were
schoolhouse ceremonies, church ceremonies, to honor the Proclamation. Hymns and
prayers.

In Norfolk, two thousand former slaves paraded.

I have gone through many newspapers to read of the
rejoicing.

A black is quoted:

âFreedom are an unbroke filly...but I gwine to mount her.â

Hundreds of thousands of copies of my Emancipation have been
printed and distributed.

To preserve the union.

Office

Surrounded by war I try to remember what Washington was like
when I first came here about eighteen years ago. What a bedraggled place it
was! I stayed at Brownâs Hotel. And Washington is again a bedraggled place, in
a different way now, with tents, troops, cavalry, guns, death.

In â47, I leased my house in Springfield for $90.00 a year.
This time I have leased it for double. My tenants were neglectful in â47; I
expect neglect again.

In the wilderness each Christmas was a day for sober
thoughts. Easter was a day of inner conflict. When was time both gentle and
kind? Underneath the stars on a summerâs night? Perhaps. Even then we might
hear a wildcat scream. WildÂ­cats were more numerous than books.

There was that winter when the cold and the snow killed many
of us, us and our livestock. Drifts hung lean-tos on our cabin. Papa shot a
deer. Wolves used the crust to raid cattle. We cut wood, lugged frozen water. A
fire burned day and night.

I lived ten years in that cabin.

One day, in town, I met a man who offered to sell me a barrel
for 50Â¢. I bought it. In the bottom, buried under straw, I found a book:
Blackstoneâs

ComÂ­mentaries.
1753. It was warm at the blacksmithâs and I began to
study the comÂ­mentaries there.

It is very late, perhaps two or three in the morning. I
forgot to wind my watch. I hear men on the street, men and horses; this city
never rests; there is weather here but I do not think of weather. The climate
of dread has assumed a reality beyond all else. When you control men and
control armies you lack inner core.

White House

January 15, 1864

In spite of myself, I recall the meals I had as a boy, the
meals when there was nothing to eat but potatoes. There were better times, when
we had perch or catÂ­fish, wild pig, grouse, or venison. But, eating potatoes,
here in the White House, brings to mind that struggle. Memory. How constant,
how untrustworthy, how valuable. Here, my Shakespearean-aside, will, like a
juggler, toss up thoughts, three or four at a time, potatoes.

In those Illinois days I was lucky when I earned 30 cents a
day, working on a farm. Walk to the farm, walk home. At dark I climbed my peg
ladder to the cabin loft and slept on corn husks, my grizzly bear rug not
always warm enough. Lying among the husks and the squeaky mice I puzzled,
knowing that soon I must leave. I determined I must get away. Living there I
lived like an Indian, an Illinois Indian, barefooted all summer, moccasined
during the winter. Like an Indian, I knew the meaning of silence, the dread of
silence and its comfort. My father taught me to work but he never taught me to
love drudgery.

Some of those pioneers used to say:

âDonât see all you see; donât hear all you hear.â

That is sound advice. It applies here in Washington. Many
aspects of my life have assumed ridiculous proportions among these people. The
fact that I was a wrestler affronts some; that I could plow with oxen annoys
others. My humor shocks many. My lizard joke, that I thought very amusing, is
now in bad taste. If I said: âSpit against the wind and you spit in your own
faceâ ...well, certain politiÂ­cians might understand and appreciate that.

I see people and more people. My office is often crowded. I
am criticized for the amount of time I devote to the public. My secretaries try
to restrain me.

Iâll do the very best I can, the very best I know how. And I
mean to keep doing so to the end. If the end brings me out all right what is
said against me wonât amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten
angels swearing I was right would make no difference.

People have asked me how it feels to be president, and I
sometimes say, if there is an appropriate moment:

You have heard about the man tarred and feathered and ridden
out of town on a rail? A man in the crowd asked him how he liked it, and his
reply was that if it wasnât for the honor of the thing, he would much rather
walk.

W. H.

January 20

The other night I had a dream and in that dream I observed
myself in a huge mirror; my face had two distinct images, one more or less
superimposed on the other, the underneath face much paler than the upper face.
The dream has perÂ­plexed me; something about it, its shadowiness maybe, seems
part of my wilderÂ­ness life, the shadowiness of those star-roofed nights. Mary
was disturbed by my dream. She interpreted it, saying that it meant that I
would be re-elected for a second term. The pale image meant I would not finish
that term. As she talked about the dream I remembered how emphatically I felt
that I would never return to Springfield, an emotion that nearly overwhelmed me
as I waved from the train.

W. H.

1864

It was only a few years ago that John Quincy Adams was
swimming in the Potomac with his son. Adams used to rise at five, to read the
Bible, CommenÂ­tary, and then read the newspapers. He was about fifty-seven when
he was President. I recall his vivid description of abolitionist Lovejoyâs
printing press tragedy, in Alton, in â37, how the mob destroyed the manâs press
and murdered him, such a fate for a truly conscientious man! A martyr to the
cause of freedom! Adams recounts preacher Joseph Cartwrightâs plea for money,
for $450 to buy the freedom of his own three grandchildren. What a meaningful
exemplification of slavery!

JQAâfine President!

White House

January 24, â64

Job seekers have besieged me. It must be the new year that
sends so many. They come from every part of our nation, even the deep South.
Some of the job seekers feel they have every right to storm my office; some are
pitifully humble. Some bring recommendations; some have prepared a little
speech; some have no credentials. Yesterday an elderly woman burst into tears
as she pled for a job. I helped her to sit down. I offered her a drink of
water. I did my best to console her. In her case there seemed to be no job available;
I asked her to return in a few days; I had to ask my secretary to show her out.
I am resolved to permit my countrymen access to my office. I can understand my
country through these seekers. If some are loath to leave, I can sit up later
over my important docuÂ­ments. Of course there are not enough oats for all these
hosses.

February 2, â64

The howitzers and the rifles and the bayonets and the
ammunition and the sandbags are gone from our public buildings. The invasion
crisis is forgotten. Some say that 10,000 men guard Washington, perhaps 8,000; I
am wary of staÂ­tistics today.

There is a hint of spring in the air today.

I stand on the steps of the White House and shout for a boy
to bring me the morning paper.

How do I obtain accurate information?

I learn that two million dollars have disappeared from our
national treasury.

I learn that General Grant is seriously ill.

I learn that the Confederate forces plan to invade
Wilmington tomorrow at noon.

I learn that I have assumed dictatorial powers.

I read that the Confederacy has 220,000 men under arms.

Tomorrow the Cabinet meets... I will point out some of these
items to my Secretary of War, my Secretary of State, my Secretary of the
Treasury.

February 5, 1864

I think that my strength as wrestler, ox driver, and rail
splitter helps me. I channel it into my cabinet meetings, office hours,
discussions, late hours. Chase, Sumner, Seward, Trumbul, Usherâeach receives
some of that energy. I repeat that the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate
for the stormy present. I re-affirm that we must act anew. We must continually
disenthrall ourselves.

Fellow citizens...we of this Congress...ours is a mutual
concern at this time...

And at all times there is someone who wishes to enter by the
back door, who has a special message or a letter of prime importance...

Some of my friends predict a final cataclysm; some believe
that by wheedling we can conquer; some voice the old voice of the abolitionists;
some offer a packet of new tricks; theirs is a jack-in-the-box credibility.

White House

February 8th, 1864

This morning, early, I heard a low rap-rap on my office
door.Â  S. O. S.

The Morse code... S. O. S.

Tad, still in his nightgown, climbed onto my lap.

Together, we figured out how many bales of hay we should
order for his pony, and Willieâs pony. How many bushels of grain. We decided
that the ponyâs halter should be re-adjusted, a new strap over the nose, or a
new buckle. We also puzzled over what should be done about the small hole in
the new red saddle.

If these were not matters of state, we made them as
importantâuntil I showed Tad my pile of correspondence; then, with a wild kiss,
he rushed off, banging the door.

February 18, 1864

I suppose that Willie and Tadâalthough strictly
forbiddenâwill rig another toy cannon on the roof of the White House. That flat
roof is an ideal playground for those scoundrels. With their cannon in place
the boys fire invisible bullets at invisible enemy ships and troops.

How I laughed when Tad gobbled all the fresh strawberries
intended for a state dinner last June. Pranks such as that annoy the kitchen
staffâand I am blamed. They cannot possibly understand that when my boys go
berserk I am relieved of war anxiety for the moment. When Willie and Tad ambush
me in some room or corridor, that tumbled mass of arms and legs and heads is my
medal for the day. As we tumble, Jip growls and barks and joins in.

Their doll, Jack, a long-legged, blue-jacketed Zouave, has
been put on trial reÂ­cently. Because he fell asleep while on picket duty the
boys sentenced him to death, and he was to be buried under a bush in the
garden.

âJack is pardoned. By order of the President,â I wrote, and
signed my name.

However, if I am away, Jack may be accused again and they
may destroy him.

Tadâs Birthday

Tad received a pair of snow-white kittens, toys, a wooden
box of stick candy, and then a boat ride on the Potomac. The spring afternoon
was calm and beautiÂ­ful. Tad loved every momentâespecially when the skipper
allowed him to steer the sloop. He dashed about the cabin, hung over the bow,
waved a flag at the stern. His grinning face is unforgettable.

Back in the White House, he became the devoted master of his
kittens. With them lying on his bed, he stuck each toy in front of a nose,
saying :

âIsnât that a nice one! Look at this little frog, kitty!â

Tad met a woman in the hall, a woman in homespun. She told
Tad that her girls and boys were hungry and sick, because their father was in
prison in Washington. Tad believed her; taking in every word she said he ran to
me. I was at my desk; I had been hearing bad news of deserters; deserters
present a grave problem; often there are complications that make judgment
difficult.

Tadâs tear-streaked face shocked me, and, little by little,
as he sat on my lap, as I cuddled him, we put together the womanâs story. He
kissed me and clasped me around the neck and begged me to intercede. I promised
I would.

Dashing into the hall, he knelt by the woman, and cried that
she was to have her husband back, that her children were going to have
something to eat.

âPapa promised,â I heard him say. âPapa promised.â

March 3rd

Many object to Tad, to his vivacity, his dashing into my
office, throwing his arms around me, staying or dashing off. There are those
who think I, in my ofÂ­fice, my high office, should be above love. Some of those
same people object to my rural humor.

I carry Tad to his bed. I tell him stories. I linger, linger
until he falls asleep. Young as he is he knows that death is around the city. I
ask his fate: shall he exÂ­perience an early death, live to be old and wise,
remembering some of these days in Washington, some of the war stories? A father
can ask questions.

Make a noise, Tad, dash into my office tomorrow, jump on me,
kiss me.

I remember the presidential chair vilified, pilloried. I see
the grim cartoons lampooning me. A child offsets those.

Tuesday evening

This morning I visited one of the hospitals, a tent hospital
by the river. Rain was everywhere. The wounded felt it, that was easy to see. I
went among them, shaking hands, enquiring; this was not my first visit; I knew
some of the men by name.

âAbraham,â I heard a man whisper to his cot mate.

Can a name influence a life?

Abrahamââfather of a multitude.â

Through the centuries, thousands of infants have been
christened Abraham. What has it meant? And what kind of father am I? In the
deep of the night, or during a cabinet meeting, or while playing with my sons,
I ask. Which of the wounded, which of the dead, was my responsibility?

Now and then the candle beside my bed does not want to go
out.

Mid-afternoon

Rain

In Springfield, Billy de Fleurvilleâs barbershop was my
favorite barbershop. We were friends, Billy and I. Billy is a Haitian. His
English is a remarkable mixÂ­ture of soft, sometimes incomprehensible sounds. A stable
person, he has raised a family and has been a civic influence for fifteen years
or more. He initiated a committee that brought about a school for blacks. He
loves his rabbit paws and his jokes; while he shaves you or trims your hair, he
entertains. Since Billy loves gumbo and fricasseed chicken I saw to it that he
had more than his share through the years.

At the depot, as the train pulled out for Washington, he was
there, handing me a farewell note, to read on the train.

He writes me that tenants are taking proper care of my house
and yard.

âFilibuster has kittens,â he adds, in a postscript. âOne
brown, two yellows.â

I treasure a letter from a child named Grace Bedell. Grace
wrote me :

âI have four brothers and part of them will vote for you
anyway, and if you let your whiskers grow, I will try and get the rest of them
to vote for you. You would look a great deal better, for your face is so thin.â

Graceâs suggestion amused me...and I might glean those two
votes! So, I let my beard grow, and Billy de Fleurville trimmed it for my inaugural.
In Westfield, at the depot, my train was on a siding. While it was there I
asked the crowd:

âIs Grace Bedell here?â

She came running to the train, and I was able to hug and
kiss her.

The White House

Sunday

They were good days in Springfield, our children growing,
bursting with enÂ­ergy, up to antics day in and day out. They helped and
hindered boisterously, helped pitch-fork the cowâs stall, water the horse,
carry in the wood for the stove; they hindered by being unreliable, off
somewhere when needed.

I
liked pulling the little ones in their red wagon, up and down our street, the
kids yelping or fussing happily. It would be pleasant to be in Springfield, but
not the same, with Robert away at school. But, I would stretch my legs onto a
footÂ­stool and lie back on the old horsehair sofa.

No, a thousand slaves are throwing up fortifications in
Richmond, in Charleston, in Atlanta....fortifications to enslave more
enslavement.

Someone, in the south, has written me:

âI warn you... I will kill you before long. You are
destroying the nation. You have no right to be President...â

March 24th, 1864

Here
is another anonymous letter:

âDear Mr. Presidentâ

âIn addressing you, I am prompted by the kindest
motives. I wish to warn you of the peril you are facing if you remain in
office. The South has strong motives for desiring your death and has resolved
to take your life in the event of your not relinquishing your office. The
blacks are disÂ­illusioned by your presidency. The whites can not, without
endangering more lives, allow you to remain in the seat of government...â

So another letter, with âkindest motives,â has reached me.
How many have, though both secretaries screen my mail. There is no doubt that
anonymity makes a man courageous.

April 2, 1864

Evening

The North commits atrocities. The South commits atrocities.
War is, without the shadow of a doubt, a form of insanity. As
Commander-in-Chief I can order troops to attack; with the cessation of military
activities I can not order 50,000 men to reconstruct a devastated area. The
legality of such an order has never been questioned, as far as I know, by any
victorious power. Perhaps, during my second term in office, I can weigh the
consequences of such an official directive.

Think of Libby Prison, consider Andersonville. They are
collective atrocities.

Was it two years ago a man handed me two red apples at a
depot in Ohio, bowing, and wishing me well?

I insist that the United States form a strictly federal
community, that the states are essential to its welfare as is the central
government, and North must never dominate the South or the South dominate the
North. I also insist that the Chief Executive remain as center of the
government. If the President uses his power justly, the people will justify
him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands to be dealt with by all the modes
they have reserved to themselves under the constituÂ­tion. This is essentially a
peopleâs contest, I repeat. On the side of the Union it is a struggle for
maintaining in the world that form and substance of government where the
leading object is to elevate the condition of man...can I repeat this too
often?

There is room enough for all of us to be free, and that it
not only does not wrong the white man that the negro should be free, but it
positively wrongs the mass of the white man that the negro should be enslaved.

Here among a heap of newspapers I pause...

April 6th

White House

(windows open)

When brought to my final reckoning, may I have to answer for
robbing no man of his goods; yet, more tolerable even this, than for robbing
one of himself and all that was his. When, a year or two ago, professedly holy
men of the South met in the semblance of prayer and devotion, and, in the name
of Him who said, âAs ye would all men should do unto you, do ye even so unto
them,â appealed to the Christian world to aid them in doing to a whole race of
men as they would have no man do unto themselves, to my thinking they contemned
and insulted God and His church...but let me forebear, remembering it is also
written, âJudge not lest ye be judged.â

My words, my record, this diary, seem obtuse at times; I
attempt to write down what I think and the writing evolves another way.

In pensive mood I realize that President Jefferson Davis
sits at his desk in his White House. I sit at my desk in my White House. He
orders his army to move across the chessboard of war. I order my army to move
across the same chessÂ­board. His men fight for their homeland. My men fight for
a nation. It seems to me that this is an ancient form of puppetry, a puppetry
that came into being in days before the time of Christ. It is obvious, then,
that we have gained nothing in the realm of diplomacy.

The cause of slavery has little to do with puppetry; it has
much to do with manâs future. The nation must have freedom as its base, a
living freedom, a workerâs freedom, a thinkerâs freedom.

Some folk still call me âOld Abe,â âHonest Abe,â âThe BackwoodsÂ­man,â
âRail Splitter.â I like those names; they come out of my wilderness; they can
be warm. They helped me through those stormy debate days and still help me in
this prolonged struggle to save our country.

Lincoln:Â  1,866,452 votes

Douglas: 1,376,957 votes

Those numbers are printed in my mindâs eye. I am proud that
I beat Stephen Douglas, a great man, who, often impartial, said good things
about me as we contested, as we debated. How was he able to carry on so valiantly?
A sick manâIâve seen him stagger from fatigue. Iâve seen him fall asleep, on
the platÂ­form, after final arguments. Yet, next day he was on his feet again:

1,866,452

I saw those figures as I walked along Pennsylvania Avenue
after the inauguration ceremony, as I walked through the White House garden.
That was my lucky number, my lottery number. Destiny, hard work, luck,
timeâthey dovetail.

I felt the loss keenly, when Douglas died in â61. He wore himself
out in his effort to save the union.

April 24, 1864

At the outset of this war, we had a military force of about
16,000 men. Few of these men could be classed as professionals. After the loss
of Fort Sumter, I called for 75,000 volunteers. Moving into combat, in those
early days, men fought with antiquated guns and poor equipment; however, our
artillery, at least, was superior.

Our soldiers were fortunate to have field tents. They
bivouacked in mule yards. Uniforms were issued willy-nilly. Hats had to be
stuffed with newspapers. Some men had to survive on desiccated vegetablesâcakes
of them. On the march their knapsacks fell apart.

I see that war is fought on folly. I half-believe there were
sane men who could have steered us without conflict. Day after day, hour after
hour, I walk through this tragedy. I question my judgment and the judgment of
others. I study a war map and realize I am studying a map of corpses, men,
women, and children.

I wake in the middle of the night. Thereâs a bell, a drum.

The White House

We have 3,200,000 slaves in our country.

What man would not want to set them free?

Among them there must be many a man and woman who is among
theÂ  finÂ­est. Among them there must be inventors, lawyers, doctors, preachers,
teachersâmen who never had a chance. It is my duty, my dedication, to liberate
them as soon as possible. The world can not be a better place until they are
freed.

Three million men and women and children, bound in irons,
what a world! I will do my best to strike those irons, take away every shackle,
so these people can look at the sun and say:
this is my
world to make
something of, it is my chance to get something out of life.

Three or four times I have hidden (incognito?), in the wings
of a theatre to hear an opera.
Tales of

Hoffman
was performed
last week, and I sat in a red leather chair behind the curtains. Back home I
used to watch magic lantern shows; they were fine antidotes to melancholy; the
Tales
of Hoffman
minimized the WashingÂ­ton volcano.

I escape some of our war tragedy by reading Spencer. In my
bedroom I read till sunup. Every man must skin his own skunk and I skin mine through
books. At sunup I can lay down my book and sleep, until someone wakes me.

Tonight
I would like to bowl at Caspariâs but bowling, because of the war, is
off-limits for me. Somebodyâs afraid a strike might make me laugh. I had a few
good strikes before the war.

The White House is asleep. Perhaps I should find a ruler and
compass and attempt to square the circle.

And so to bed...

My wife is one of the loneliest women in Washington. Her
hospitality, her lavish entertainments, have bred enemies and have engendered
no rewarding friendships. Because Mary exceeded her Congressional allotment for
essential White House expenditures, the press has attacked her. I have
volunteered to pay the bills out of my salary. I have cautioned her against
ostentation: âWar is no time for preening.â

Elizabeth Keckley, her seamstress, a former slave, is her
confidante. With three brothers fighting in the Confederate army there are
those who accuse Mary of treason. Injustice can strike. And the sad face, the
sad thoughts continue. Poor Mary. Sharing intimate emotions with Elizabeth
Keckley is a mistake. I do not dare reproach her.

Todayâs cabinet meeting was a bitter one.

Yes, it is true Mary has relatives fighting for the Southern
cause. So has GenÂ­eral Grant and other officers. Does this imply some form of
subterfuge? I am well aware of my wifeâs integrity. I respect her family
sympathies. To impugn the loyalty of my spouse is tantamount to accusing me of
treason.

When I learned
that a secret committee had been formed to investigate the loyalty of my wife I
made a point of appearing dramatically, by a seldom used door to the committee
room. I stepped inside without a wordâhat in hand.

A dozen men were sitting around a long table. Rain was
streaking the winÂ­dows. No one spoke. I waited. I stared at first one and then
the other, searching the faces. I knew most of the men well.

I said:

âI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, appear
of my own voliÂ­tion before this Senate Committee to say that I, of my own
knowledge, know that it is untrue that any member of my family holds
treasonable communication with the enemy.â

I walked out.

I have heard no more from that committee or any other;
however, my reÂ­sentment lingers, sticks in my craw. Who could forget such
calumny?

I have attended lectures at the Smithsonian Institute, where
Horace Greeley has been outspoken on the abuse of slavery in our nation. His
influence, through his lectures and his associates, through his editorials in
the
New

York

Tribune,
is an influence I intend to curry.

At the Smithsonian he drew me aside and thought it important
to inform me that he is a vegetarian, a teetotalerâthat he would never stoop to
smoking a ciÂ­gar. He seemed to be sounding me out by cataloging his qualities.
Grasping my arm, he grinned and said: âI want to share this one...since you
like stories. I have loaned considerable sums to the son of Commodore
Vanderbilt. Last week the Commodore burst into my office and rapped on my desk
with his cane. When I glanced up, he said: âI will not be responsible for my
sonâs borrowing money from you.â I said to the Commodore: âWho the Hell asked
you to.â â

At another Smithsonian lecture, I met George Bancroft, our
distinguished elder historian. Obviously disgruntled and tired, he wanted to
know: Why is General McClellan living in an aristocratic style in an
aristocratic mansion? Is it true that John Jacob Aster pays his salary?

When I introduced Bancroft to McClellan, he questioned Mac
about the condition of the cavalry: Is it true that half the horses purchased
for the army are unfit for service? Was it true that in the District of
Columbia, horses have been chained to trees, where they gnawed bark, leaves and
branches until they died?

McClellan was not happy with Bancroft. I was not happy with
Bancroft and McClellan. Since the General has become known in Washington as the
âgeneral most gifted at masterly inactivity,â I am seriously considering taking
to the field as Commander-in-Chief. My qualification: integrity.

I can not sleep.

In Chicago, one windy night, I attended my first symphony
concert. I was in the city working on the McCormick lawsuit. The concert was
all Italian. Verdi. I recognized, as I listened to the rich outpouring, how
much I had missed during my prairie years. There were no available seats in the
theatre, but that was unimÂ­portant; I leaned against a wall, in the foyer, hat
in hand. Mama would have rejoiced over such music! Why must so many die young
and deprived?

Drums passing.

De Tocqueville wrote that there are few calm spots in this
country for mediÂ­tation; yet, in this library, there is a spot. This afternoon
it seems to me that these ancient books, with their ancient wisdom, ask what is
freedom? Is it something nailed in pain against the morning sky? I think not.
Surely freedom is not to limit mankind; it is to share lifeâs values. I
remember these lines, learned as a boy, âWhat avail the plow or sail, or land
or life, if freedom fail?â It is our duty to know and analyze freedom, however
illusive. I hear it is a flame. Then, if that is true, we must keep it burning
in our minds. The altar of freedom is an expresÂ­sion that illustrates how
sacred freedom is. Freedom, if we can say it briefly, is the dignity of man.

Can a truly religious person support war, I query?

I am my brotherâs keeper, I am instructed.

In the core of night, knowing that my countrymen are waging
fratricidal carÂ­nage, I perceive that I have been nurtured on violence: I
countenance war.

As Commander of the military forces, whose intention is
victory, I am beginÂ­ning to see that war is a form of slavery. Generals Grant
and Sherman, Generals Johnson and Lee confirm this. So, we, the people, with
our armies, fight slavery with slavery.

No doubt others have mulled over these or similar tenets.
But I return to the cost, the human cost, the countless lives lost, the
shattered families, shattered homes. Our lintels are hung with crepe.

Surely, I should kneel in prayer each night, but for years I

Now, with the war pressing down on mind and country, prayer is needed. But this

Mary has taught Tad to pray. His little prayers, as he lies

It has been a couple of weeks since I have written here. No
matter. Some of the things I write are as thin as the homoeopathic soup that
was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had been starved to death.

Tonight the ticking of my watch is audibleâit is meaningful
following a long day listening to men and women express their desires. As I sit
in my bedroom, my watch my companion, I feel that time is not on my side. Time
is slow at bringing the war to an end. Time cares nothing for us. In the garden
I have studied the sundial on sunny and cloudy days. We are also time pieces.

For years I wished to own a watch and chain, a gold one with
a gold chain. It is time to pick up the key and wind my watch again.

Willieâs Birthday

In our dining room our dining table was festiveâfor Willie.
His friend, Charlie Mathers, was special guest, Charlie, so splendid in his
freckles and red hair. Both boys were dressed in their Sunday togs.

I gave Willie a Zeiss field glass, an antique shipâs compass
from Italy, I beÂ­lieve; also a red handkerchief and books.

Mary gave him a British belt buckle with lion and unicorn, a
set of brushes and tubes of pigment...

Charlie brought a box of candy.

Willie, at the head of the table, opened his gifts sedately,
barely commenting, shy, rather like a little prince, not a kid from Illinois.

Tad pleased him with a checker set, board and pieces handmade.

(Todayâs war casualties are shocking.)

June 21, â64

During the last year I have had several consultations with
White House and Washington physicians. They are encouraging about Tad. They
believe that he may be able to speak normally as he grows older, that he may be
able to learn to read and write, that his frenzied actions may diminish as he
matures. I had a White House doctor observe Tad for over a month; he is quite
optimistic.

Dear TadâMary and I love you.

When I hold him in my arms he has no defects. I think his
ponies and goats and dogs and cats have helped him. He is always kind to his
little friends. The soldiers love him. Heâs their Illinois Lieutenant. The
blacks, too, are fond of him.

Mary loves to cradle him in her arms, in the peace of her
bedroom. SomeÂ­times he sleeps with me. Of course we spoil him. We spoil Willie
too. When I am in conference and Tad dashes in it is amazing how intolerant
some people can be over his effusiveness.

Well...when I am with Tad I forget the war.

What does my old freckle-faced pastor think of me, now that
I am in WashÂ­ington? He never writes. Does he think I have forgotten
Springfield?

He forgave Tad for whittling on a pew; he tolerated my long
absences when I rode circuit; he preached directly, discreetly from the Bible,
eager to please his congregation. Today he is probably sermonizing from Job:
the war must weigh on him because he is a just and careful man. I imagine he
remembers that ThoÂ­mas Jefferson kept slaves. Does he know that there are some
200,000 blacks serving in our army? I would like to sound him out. How does he
feel about the importance of a country united? If I could drop by...listen...if
I could ride circuit for a fortnight I would learn much.

I notice that I have not written here for about a month.

I believe it was arson.

Someone set fire to the White House stables. I rushed out
when I saw the flames and heard men shouting. Our fire engine crew arrived too
late. Willieâs pony died. Tadâs pony died. Four horses died, three survived,
among them Old Abe. The fire occurred at night, while Willie and Tad slept. How
much more disastrous it would have been if they had been awake. A number of us
worked for five or six hours, to calm the surviving horses, to drag away the
ponies on a sledge, for later burial. In the morning it was a very hard task to
inform the boys.

With Tad sprawled on the bedroom floor, and Willie slumped
in a chair, Mary and I attempted to comfort them. They were not to be
comforted. We promised replacement ponies. They wailed and cringed at
âreplacements.â The day was lost.

Arson, yes, everyone thinks it was arson. Some of the stable
hands feel that the fire was set to bring me to the stables at nightâa possible
assassination atÂ­tempt.

The White House

The Library

I have sought sanctuary in the library.

Willie is dead.

He was thirteen, handsome, intelligent, gentle, fond of each
of us. For two weeks he battled for survival, his doctors helping little or not
at all. When his doctor left him, when I was alone with him, I felt his cold
face and held his cold hands. I thought, heâs not really dead. It must be an
error. He isnât dead because I feel his presence in the room, hear his voice.

Typhoid killed him.

Mary, hysterical, suffered grave headaches at his death. She
is unable to comÂ­fort Tad. She is unable to speak coherently. She sometimes
fancies that he is not dead: she wants to go into the bedroom and speak to him.
She says she hopes to communicate with him through a sÃ©ance. Only I have a
chance at comforting Tad. Sitting on my lap, his head against my shoulder, he
sleeps. Certainly he knows the sleeve of care, the worn sleeve.

Today we buried our Willie. Mary and Robert and Tad and I
stood side by side at the grave.

It was like burying a part of my own body... I felt the
earth strike my hands, my arms, my face, my mouth.

Cabinet members attended, military men, friends, White House
staff. Tad held Jip in his arms. It rained some.

Iâm a tired man. Sometimes Iâm the tiredest man on earth.

August â64

Mary has passed days in her darkened bedroom, wracked by
headaches, scarcely able to communicate, hardly able to eat. Her faithful Mrs.
Keckley looks after her. There is little or no response when I attempt to
comfort her. God, she claims, has deserted her.

I return to my office.

Now the war is my distraction. There is a hellish healing
power in the roll of drums, the rumble of caissons, the tramp of a regiment.
Washingtonâs armed camp is always on the move.

Willie...

Maybe he is fortunate. At least he has been spared the
confrontation of brother against brother.

I return to Maryâs bedroom.

I offer coffee. She declines.

Robert came and knelt by her. He will go back to Harvard
next week. Tad lay asleep at the foot of Maryâs bed. Sometimes, when the four
of us are in the bedÂ­room I feel that grief is fourfold.

I retreated.

Jip comes.

August

After Willieâs death I received a warm and understanding letter
from Billy Herndon, my Billy. Each word weighed carefully.

Through the years he was much more patient than I; when I
read aloud, back in the back of the office, he overlooked the nuisance. He
tolerated my kids when they burst in on me. They sometimes wrecked havoc. He
never brought his kids, never permitted them to come to the office...or if he
did, they were no problem.

Billy
could prepare his cases faster than I.

âAbe, are you still lingerinâ over that Moffit suit?â

When he stood before a jury he was accurate and his accuracy
taught me to prepare my cases with care.

Billy liked Willie. Well, he liked all my chilÂ­dren.

How often we spread ourselves in my parlor and talked. Billy
is like a cedar post, deeply imbedded.

Maybe he misses the buffalo stampede of my kids.

Summer

Personal tragedy strikes most of us. At this time personal
loss is the fabric of this country.

What does a man do, does he sit in his chair, in the middle
of a room, and wait?

I have not adjusted to Willieâs death.Â Â Â  Just a few days ago
he was alive, riding on his pony; then, then the four of us stood around his
grave.

The night he died I sat up all night; I worked with letters,
documents, senate papers, proposals for a rail west, telegrams reporting the
war. Someone brought me coffee.

Jip came in, and sat on my lap.

It is one thing to encounter personal loss in the theatre,
another to read a tragedy; certainly it is another emotion to face it yourself,
to realize that no power can reinstate.

The disciples had their hands full when their Lord and
Master was crucified. I do not measure my little boy as any kind of lord but he
was my son, a promise. The father in me does not go away.

I go, now, to curry Old Abe.

I would like to chop wood a while.

August 20th

I woke early. It is already hot. No breeze.

I look out of the windows at the tents of the wounded.
Behind the tents is the river, flattened by the heat. I have been inside of each
tent several times. I have seen inside some of those men; I listen; I wait and
listen. There are men with letters from home, men with Bibles beside them. Men
or boys. Perhaps there is no essential difference when one is wounded. Man or
boy is lost. There is no catching up for him. His trip home will show him a
different world; if he goes home in a coffinâhis homecoming makes that home
unreal forever. One boy shows me a
miniÃ©
ball extracted from his leg.
One man tells me how much we need a balloon corps. Another grasps my hand but
canât say a word. At the very back of the tent someone is playing a harmonica,
the âCamp Town Racesâ...or so it was yesterday.

Today I have been able to pardon two boys accused of
dereliction of duty, Company K, while on guard near Washington. Regardless of
reports I feel that they had carried the Union on their bayonets. Cramer and
Phillips will have a second chance.

The heat of the afternoon has been oppressive; to cool me
off, my mulatto brought me a cool drink on her famous tray; then a chaplain and
a private spun stories of regimental pets. Once again I heard of the eagle in
the 8th Wisconsin Volunteers. He is still alive after being in battles in seven
states. His six-and-a-half-foot wingspread has been crippled by bullets; they
say he screams when his Corps sees action.

A Minnesota unit manages to keep a half-grown bear; they
swear he is the best picket-duty man. A black and white dog, named Jacko, has
been dubbed a âbrave soldier dog,â because he has been wounded twice, while his
men were in action.

I have also learned that there are gamecocks, a coon, and
several badgers in the field. Mascots all.

Militiamen, who visit me, talk a language I understand:
jaggers, hardtack, barbed wire, pup tents, canteens, bivouacs, sutlers,
coffee...

There are stories about dysentery: one boy said, âI jusâ cut
out the bottom of my trousers!â

Maryâs kindness resumes. She visits the hospitals, the
injured, taking flowers, food. The men are delighted to have her. People bring
her newspapers and magazines, and she distributes them...she has made a little
friend of a one-armed boy; sitting beside him, she becomes his mother.

Last week she brought about the abolishment of a death
sentence. Due to her perseverance there will be no firing squad for Richard
Miller, a youngster who fell asleep on duty. My âLady Presidentâ obtained a
reprieve from General McClellan.

The
Press wars against Mary. Reporters ridicule her when she goes shopping in New
York or Philadelphia, in her attempts to refurbish the White Rouse. If she
visits Robert at Harvard, that too is criticized. Her letters to relatives are
sometimes confiscated. I am aware that there are spies in the White House, but
not Mary!

Is this why I assumed the Presidency! It is very difficult
to curb my resentÂ­ment.

Tonight, I will be spending a while with Frank Carpenter,
watching him paint his Emancipation scene. He is a quiet, serious fellow, and I
enjoy his company. I appreciate his skill, as he slowly brings his figures to
life. He is still working in the dining room. Heâll bring me a rocker and I
will stretch out.

âMy deskâ

I have little admiration for Napoleon; I have less for my
little Napoleons who believe or half-believe this is a war of conquest. Again
and again I remind them of emancipation. They nod. The negro? The slave? Can it
be that there is a moral issue? It is possible that our government can wipe out
slavery and free thousands of blacks? A few are astute enough to understand the
potential here. A few are astute enough to project themselves in time, asking
how are we to repair the devastation caused by General Grant and General
Sherman. How long did it take for our men to burn Atlanta? How long does a city
burn? Some say that Rome is still burning.

Andersonvilleâa prison... Libbyâa prison. Thousands of men
are incarcerÂ­ated. Who pays for these criminal acts? All of us pay. We pay as
though we were buying sugar at $12.00 a pound. A man weighs about 160 pounds.
If he loses weight while he is imprisoned do we pay less?

With my watch lying on the desk, the seconds seem to move
all too swiftly. Nine, ten, twelve...each second a life around
Washington...cabinet memÂ­bers...family...friends. Here at 9:58 is Willieâs
birth; here at 4:00 is Tadâs birth. A few more seconds pass and I am delivering
my inaugural address. The war is threatening, the war has overcome us.

I put away the watch.

When Billy Herndon presented me with that watch I thought I
would spend the rest of my life in Springfield. I thought our partnership would
go on and on. I was lying on the old sofa, tired after a circuit ride.

Billy handed me the watch; I opened its box; then he said :

âWeâve been working together for ten years.â

He brushed his fingers through his shaggy beard and sat down
at his desk.

âThis is a beautiful country,â said John Brown, as the
hangman hung him.

He was no black Christ: no gentle Uncle Tom; yet, he is
becoming a black Christ as we continue this civil war, as we become more and
more harassed by casualties. We will need black Christs if we are to free the
negro.

must add spaceâroom by room, year

All the powers of earth seem to be combining against the
chattel slave. Mammon is after him, ambition follows, philosophy follows, and
the theology of the day is joining the cry. They have him in his prison house;
they have searched his person, and left no prying instrument with him. One
after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him; and now they have
him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of every keyâthe keys in the hands of a
hundred different men, and they scattered to a hundred different and distance
places; and they stand musing as to what invention, in all the dominions of
mind and matter, can be produced to make the impossibility of his escape more
complete than it is.

This evening I heard negroes singing, as I worked at my
desk, the windows open. I heard that song in New Orleans on my first visit; I
heard it later when on the Mississippi, when we were on our cargo-raft, when we
tied up at a wharf. That was quite a scrap. The blacks almost threw us off our
raft.

Oh, was you ev â er in Mo â bile Bay,

Poverty...those days were poverty days.

And
after this war is over we will have greater poverty in the South. Poverty will
be a pestilence in the South. It will require years of work to wipe it out. PovÂ­erty
will breed treachery and crime. What police force will be able to contend with
it? I will urge Congress to pass an aid bill. I will propose groups of
citizenry who can advise.

Saturday evening

Here are some interesting figures I encountered:

Less than one-half a dayâs cost of this war could pay for
the slaves in the State of Delaware, at $400 per person.

All slaves by 1860 census:

1,798

Cost of these slaves:

$719,200

One dayâs cost of the war:

$2,000,000

Less than 87 daysâ cost of this war could, at the same $400
figure, pay for the slaves in the States of Delaware, Maryland, District of
Columbia, Kentucky, and Missouri:

Cost of the slaves:

$173,048,800

87 days of war:

$174,000,000

Would compensation to all the slave owners satisfy them? Of
course not. Their honor is at stake. If we do not make common cause to save the
good old ship of the Union on this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot
her on anÂ­other voyage.

Note:

Write General
Grant regarding the improveÂ­ment of all military telegraph service. Suggest a
military Telegraphic Corps.

The White House

September 8, 1864

When I reviewed the Army of the Potomac, when the greatest
cavalry in the world rode past, I felt no pride, only sorrow, for the military
pomp. To those of pensive turn, the military implies death, men in uniform are
death-men, dealers and receivers. They work in the counting house of death.

Tad rode with the cavalry, his little shoulders wrapped in a
grey cloak.

Dear Tad, what do you know of pain? You will sit on my lap
and babble and then ride horseback, and imagine yourself a great general.

There are no great generals, Tad.

I salute the officers but take off my hat to the men in the
ranks. They are the great men. There are no victorsânot if there is heart and
memory among men, consideration for the maimed, the widows, the orphans, the
deceased.

Some men war for glory. No...peace is the glory.

There is only one cause: the country, its flag, a united
people from coast to coast. I know that of thousands of men, chosen from the
ranks, there would be a thousand reasons why they fought. Perhaps that is not
quite right.

The men in review, the thousands who rode and walked past,
were soon to retreat. Mishandled by General Hooker, 20,000 were killed, died in
a wilderness of trees and thickets.

Wilderness of trees and thickets...so is much of my concept
of this war, due largely to inadequate reports or reports that arrive too late
to be of any use.

My colored pins, on the fields of battle, designate more
than battle lines, regiments, infantry, artillery, cavalry,
fortifications...those pins are men, my men, my country.

I understand that some of the New Englanders dumped their
Bibles on their long marchesâtheir knapsacks too heavy. I can see those Bibles,
dropped beside a fence post, left underÂ­neath a tree, regretfully placed on the
side of a corncrib.

For my dear Son, Charlesâ

love, Mother

I read most of my motherâs Bible. It was a solace and a
threat; it was a puzÂ­zlement because I could not disentangle legend from fact.

Was there such a city as Zidon?

Was there a Goliath?

My motherâs Bible had a few mapsâthey led me to travel by
camelback, through Egypt and Assyria. At night, in my attic, I imagined the
sacred tabernaÂ­cle, the pyramids. I repeated some of the
Song of Songs.

To a great extent, this war is capitalism versus a kind of
feudalism. On one hand we have free labor and on the other slave labor. The
North boasts more millionaires than the South, in normal times. New York City
probably has more millionaires than the entire South. John J. Astor is an
example of an individual who has amassed wealth by canny manipulationsâhis kind
is unseen in the South. As I understand it, Northern labor practices are questionable
at times, shackling the workers; this must be leveled out in years to come.

Strange, seeing beggars on Northern streets; yet none in the
South.

As the war continues I learn that Southern railroad cars
lack windows for lack of factory labor. House glass can not be replaced;
conventional glassware for the table can not be replaced. If a man wishes a
prescription filled he must furnish his own bottle or packet. Needles, pins,
scissors, knives are smuggled in and sold on the black market. Drugs have vanished
from pharmacopoeia.

Tonight my watch lies on my chest of drawers. Ah yes, the
seconds are passÂ­ing, the minutes are passing. Jim Maitland is dead. Colonel
James Maitland, MasÂ­sachusetts man. His handsome face, his humor, leadership,
bravery, gone. I thought him my protÃ©gÃ© and friend. I was to grant him a
Majorâs commission.

The seconds, the minutes, ran out too quickly for Maitland.
As I stare down at the second hand, in its small circle, I see his face; I see
him dressed in his Zouave uniform.

Tad will miss him.

For a moment he held the enemy flag in his hands, then a
shotgun blast.

An officer has given me a war diary kept by a Southern
soldier, Fred Parker, corporal. Rain has soaked its pages; pages are missing.
Here are four entries, written during the Wilderness Campaign:

May 6, 1864. Face-to-face fighting all day. Rifles.
Pistols. No help from our cavalry or artillery. Pine woods surround. Trees
close together. Weather poor. Fred died beside me at midday. Jeffrey has had
his leg shot at the knee; knee shattered; men carried him away. We hide, shoot,
duck, lie down.

May 7. Not much to eat. Awful hungry. Rifle fire constant.

May 8. Grantâs forces surround us. 120,000 men.

May 9. Dead and wounded everywhere, behind trees, under
bushes. I see pieces of a sweater. Shoes. Boots. A hat. Bayonets. Broken
musket. A brass belt buckle.

The diary tells me that life must be more than a belt
buckle.

Hamletâs thoughts, his moods, fit the conflict that assails
our country.

...We defy augury; there is special providence in the fall of a
sparrow. If it be now, âtis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now;
if it be not now, yet it will come; the readiness is all; since no man has
aught of what he leaves what is it to leave betimes? Let be.

Let be. Do we?

Little Tad heard Mary speaking about Maitlandâs shotgun
death; he climbed onto Maryâs bed and talked about our friendâs funeralâtearful
details about the White House ceremony, details bitter for childish emphasis.

Perhaps it is repugnant to write here when men are dying.
Perhaps my diary should not have been written; perhaps I should have been
attending the wounded in the hospitals. But that confusion, that confusion of
pain and sorrow, would not, could not, carry me forward.

October 21st, â64

My desk

How vividly I summon up the hundreds of exhausted soldiers
in the streets of Washington.

I watched them from the White House, a stream of muddy,
rain-soaked men, walking through a downpour, going nowhere. Men without guns,
without knapÂ­sacks; some men covered with blankets. Some staggered. Some fell,
lay on the street. Women brought coffee. There were Michigan men, New York men,
Minnesota menâdefeated, defeated at Bull Run. The broken regiments strugÂ­gled
all along Pennsylvania Avenue. Victims of panicâdefeat. Not a drum sounded. All
took place in rain-washed silence. Men without shoes, men leaning on one
another.

I ordered the White House staff and military guard to
provide coffee, food, blankets, shelter.

Hundreds passed...all day long.

For a long while after this there were conferences, men
realizing that WashÂ­ington could be attacked. A long time before the city was
protected.

Defeat, I am told, is a particular kind of crucifixion. I
know. I have thoughtâ

October 24, â64

I wish I could go bowling, swap yarns.

When I bowl I really never care whether I win. When I make a
good score it is luck. It is talk I enjoy. It gives me an uplift. Itâs an
exchange, maybe, if I relate one of my circuit stories.

I can not go bowling when men are dying. There is no escape.
I should not look for an escape. I want cessation of conflict. Enduring peace.
I wish to comÂ­mand a strong nation, a great nation that can stand before the
world as an examÂ­ple of what men can achieve.

A sadness pervades our White House gardens, a more than
autumn sadness.

Mary and I tried to make a haven of our garden whenever
possible. Sunsets have been Potomac sunsets, wilderness and prairie sunsets.
Nevertheless, that great stillness intrudes as we walk and talk about our
family and obligations. Flowers lie in Maryâs lap, as we sit on a bench. She
smiles.

Now four years have come and gone.

We measure those years, wanting to understand. We no longer
speculate about the future, our future. Life, for the moment, is held in
balance like an upÂ­raised oar.

Was it yesterday, after the rain, with a faint rainbow, that
the sentries paced along the far side of the gardens, and a white duck waddled toward
us?

The White House

November 3rd, 1864

âWe have seen our courthouse in chains, two battalions of
dragoons, eight companies of artillery, twelve companies of infantry, the whole
constabulary force of the city police, the entire disposable marine of the
United States, with its artillery loaded for action, all marching in support of
a Praetorian band, consistÂ­ing of 120 friends and associates of the United
States Marshall, with loaded pisÂ­tols and drawn swords, and in military costume
and arrayâfor what purpose? To escort and conduct a poor trembling slave from a
Boston courthouse to the fetters and lash of his master! This display of
military force the mayor of this city officially declared to be necessary,â so
wrote our Harvard University friend, old Josiah Quincy. He also added, that
summer in â54, âSlaveholders have multiplied their black cattle by the million;
and are every day increasing their numbers, and extending their cattle field
into the wilderness...â

I respond to those impressive words with mine, since the
slave issue dies hard.

The ant who has toiled and dragged a crumb to his nest will
furiously defend the fruit of his labor against whatever robber assails him. So
plain that the most dumb and stupid slave that ever toiled for a master does
constantly know that he is wronged. So plain that no one, high or low, ever
does mistake it, except in a plainly selfish way; for although volume after
volume is written to prove slavery a very good thing, we never hear of the man
who wishes to take the good of it by being a slave himself.

Certainly, though a man may escape death and injury in the
front lines, changes brought about by the war may alienate him at home, after
he leaves the army, if he still has a home. The black who has fought for the
North may find his Southern neighbors have become enemies. The black who has
found a measÂ­ure of recognition while serving will find a lack of recognition
after the war.

We have made little or no provision for the wounded. Our
hospitals are inÂ­adequate. Southerners will return to their farms with little
more than the horse that saw combat. Custom dictates that he reject the negro.

As a nation, we are in a maelstrom of change. It is my hope
that the church may help democratize. As I study the Washington archive I learn
essential facts, but these facts are not disseminated. How are we to coordinate
these state laws? Missouri hardly comprehends the laws of Massachusetts.

Justiceâmany strive for justice. Efforts must be doubled. I
hope it may be said that I was just.

There are nights when I can not sleep. I get up and pace the
floor of my bedÂ­room or go into my office.

Many continue to threaten my life; so I do not walk the
streets of WashingÂ­ton. If I were home again I could walk freely. In
Springfield, it is pleasant to imagine, I would shake off the war trauma. I
think old skies would reassure me. But days in Springfield will not return. I
have lost more than half my life hereâbut it was not the ax that cut me down.
What was it, in all truth? Craving for glory? For power? I accept those
weaknesses but above them is my desire to help my country, to balance the
welfare of our people.

The White House

âcold, rainyâ

Very often my commanding officers prove to be inadequate and
I have to substitute one for another. Most officers, I find, shun advice or
suggestions. Grant and Sherman are the best listeners. Ours is a mutual
respect. Grant has the essential military skill to control the entire armed
force. He also has ample courÂ­age for his job (it takes courage to fling men
into battle; I also send men to death).

Sleep continues to be difficult to come by...peace is
difficult to come by we know by now...hope is hard to come by.

It is curious and amusing to look at life across time: man
knows his detours: it is incredible how he has fumbled his way through the
centuries. In spite of the fumbling, I believe in mankind.

Christmas

CHRISTMASâ1864.

Mary and Robert and I have exchanged gifts.

We have given many presents to Tad.

Late in the afternoon, we placed a wreath on Willieâs grave.

This evening I received this telegram from General Sherman:

âI beg to present you, as a Christmas gift, the City of
Savannah.

Â Â Â Â Â Â  â William T. Shermanâ

Rain beats on the White House, rain mixed with snow.

Old newspaper clippings remind me that six thousand soldiers
died in an hour at the battle of Cold Harbor.

Another clipping reminds me of Gettysburg.

Another...

I have been reading the fifth chapter of Isaiah. It does not
help. It seems there are days when nothing helps.

If re-elected, how shall I live through a second term? But I
must; there is work to be done; I am the best to carry out honesty for all. I
want no recriminaÂ­tions.

Perhaps I can find peace, someday, in Europe. My son,
Robert, is ill-disposed toward me. There is Tad, poor little wounded Tad.

Mary is ill, seriously ill.

Now, I shall open the Bible once more.

Late

S

ince many of our soldiers are fifteen or sixteen years
old, I am aware that discipline is wanting, both discipline and stamina. Yet
they fight furiously, build bridges, lay rails. They fight with their
muzzle-loaders, cannon, mortar, bayonet. Most of them had never heard a gun
fired except while out hunting. In a grim sense we are witnessing a youth crusade
against injustice. For $13.00 a month they are fighting a manâs war. And dying
is a manâs job. Poor children, crawling out of some entrenchÂ­ment, they
fraternize during a lullâswap tobacco for coffee. They soon learn that our
hospitals are dangerous places. Tents. Barns. Churches. Sheds.

We accepted this war for a worthy objective, and the war
will end when that goal has been attained. We must succeed. This war has taken
four years! It was begun or accepted to restore national authority over the
whole national domain. Yes, we must succeed.

The White House

Office

The pigeonholes of my desk contain reports of disgraced
militiamen, unforÂ­tunate prisoners of war, civilian and military spies, reports
that demand that ulÂ­timate yes or no. I study these reports, I weigh each one
carefully; some two thousand reach me every month. Across the Potomac River, as
I write, I hear gunfire, Virginia gunfire. Perhaps this is Butcher Dayâour men
are facing a Confederate firing squad.

I am reprimanded. Officers protest I weaken army morale when
I commute a death sentence. Yesterday I pardoned William Scott, Vermonter,
Company L, who fell asleep while on sentinel duty at a Potomac bridge. Nineteen
years old, a farm boy, he was undoubtedly accustomed to going to bed at dusk. I
rode to the Potomac River Camp and found Scott handcuffed in his tent.

âBoy,â I said, âIâm going to send you back to Company L.â

Boys can do us more good above ground. If a man had more
than one life to live, I believe a little hanging would not hurt him too
much...but he has one life.

Nothing exhausts me more than death sentences, death
warrants, death. Young life is priceless. There are thirty million people
involved in this war. Youth must be considered, if we are to survive.

I want to write something about my old friend, the
Virginian, Ward Hill Lamon, of Danville days. Hill is my volunteer guardian,
spy, Rabelaisian crony, scribe. Time and again he bundles up and sleeps all
night in the hall outside my bedroom door, a derringer at hand. He is constantly
alarmed I may be assassiÂ­nated. He upbraids me when I ride alone in the White
House carriage.

âThat stupid coachman canât look after you... I want a dozen
or half-dozen cavalrymen to attend you.â

Evenings, Hill may appear and size me up, and sing a sad
little song or a bobtail-nag melody, thrumming his banjo. Husky, courageous, he
befriends me every day. Breakfasting together, he has a kernel of advice for
me, Iâm sure.

I have borrowed his hat, borrowed his cloak, but not his
boots.

âAs President, it is incumbent on you to look after your own
boots and your own umbrellas,â he says.

As warden he has problems with both North and South; it
aggravates him when he has to confer with me; he wants to be the little eagle.
On our frequent visits to the hospitals he is always sympathetic. âSomebodyâs
Wallace,â he says, remembering one of my stories. Playing his banjo he will
sing âPicayune Butler,â his southern accent warm and beautiful, delighting the
sick and wounded.

Often, late at night, we talk of Danville, circuit friends, horses;
he is adept at driving off my melancholia.

âThe war is going to end soon,â he prophesizes. âIt has to
end soon...itâs hard to get hold of new banjo strings.â

The White House

January 5, 1865

So, another year has come into being.

âMany are the hearts that are weary tonight, waiting for the
war to cease...â

For days I have been remembering that song. Yesterday, as I
rode in the baÂ­rouche, the melody kept time to the trotting of the horses.

Wind and sun helped, as we rode.

Alone, I was able to commune with nature, able to consider
the Potomac, the trees along its banks, the finished dome of the capitol, the
monument to George Washington. For a while I was able to survey the property,
measure it, plan a city layout.

The barouche horses are bays, a young pair, well-trained,
handsomely harÂ­nessed. My driver is a stalwart from Rhode Island; he says he
used to work in a cotton mill; now, he looks forward to a job in a warmer
climate.

We talk about the chestnuts and the oaks; for a mill worker he
is well-informed about trees; suddenly, our drive is over.

Late

Nightmares occur.

I sit up in bed and recall in vivid detail scenes I have
never witnessed, men dying under artillery and rifle fire, tent amputations,
men struggling across a muddy, swollen river, a firing squad where men are shot
down as I sit in a rockÂ­ing chair.

I say nothing to anyone about these dreams but they are a
weight to my world.

Lately, it is difficult to eat; I forget or refuse my lunch
on its tray; coffee helps. I long to get away for a week or ten days.

Sunday

âwindy and coolâ

A heavy hog to hold, this war.

Sometimes people in Kentucky are loyal to the Union;
sometimes not; it deÂ­pends on whether General Lee has lost or won a battle.

Men find me lacking as the nationâs attorney. Some demand
that I plot the future. I remember that the pilots on our western rivers steer
from point to pointâas they call itâsetting the course of the boat no farther
than they can see. That is how I propose to handle some of the problems set before
me.

I seldom forget that it is a momentous thing to be the
instrument for the libÂ­eration of a race.

I look out of the window, at the statue of Thomas Jefferson
on the lawn; it puts me in mind of that lonely bronze figure atop the White
House dome, a woman, symbol of liberty, visible for milesâcast by slave labor.

Was Jeffersonâs statue cast by slaves?

Monday

âwindy and coolâ

There are something like a thousand deserters every month,
Northern men and Southern men. I see them being marched through the city, all
kinds, bareheaded, with caps, hats, with bandaged heads, with bandanas,
handsome fellows, sickly fellows, wounded men, dirty, most of them in worn-out
uniformsâmiles of men mixed with leather, steel, horses, guns, wagons, riders,
guards.

450,000 widows and mothers have lost their men.

White House

January 10, 1865

How well some officers understand one another, with a hem
and a haw, with a nod or lifted hand. They are masters of military deception,
just as politicians are masters of ambiguity. The colonels have their lingo;
the majors have theirs.

I confront them with a plan of action. They bow over a map. Immediately,
I sense that their secret codes are in operation. They guess that I am
suspicious; I see that when a lieutenant touches the generalâs knee. I decline
the generalâs offer of a cigar; he has forgotten I do not smoke. The men light
up. Smoke hovers over the map. Brady appears. He wants to take some
photographs. Some men sit, some stand. All the time the subtle deceptions
continue. It is my job, as Commander-in-Chief, to ferret out honesty and
promote it.

Troops are marching by.

Drums.

There is no room for humor.

The White House

January 12, 1865

Behind a hospital, the other day, I saw a wheelbarrow filled
with amputated hands, arms, and legs.

I walked up close to the barrow, uncertain what I saw there.
A hand reached out for my hand.

I held that hand. The stiff fingers were those of a farmerâa
man from TenÂ­nessee or Illinois, a corn-huskerâs hand.

I saw a boyâs hand next to the farmerâs.

I wanted to put those amputated pieces back in their proper
world. All those pieces, the hands, legs, feet, wanted to return to the woods,
the prairie, the barns, the canoes, the plantations.

As I write down these words my hands are not steady.

The White House

January 20, 1865

A month or so ago, I wrote General Grant on behalf of
Robert. Now that Robert has graduated from Harvard, he insists on joining the
army. I agree. Grant has replied and has given him a captainâs commission, and
he is to beÂ­come a member of Grantâs personal staff. Robert has not written me;
perhaps he had learned of his motherâs parental concern and has included me as
an obstrucÂ­tionist. Now he is less likely to be bayoneted or blown to shreds
while on the Generalâs staff.

Another of Maryâs brothers has been killed in action. Her fears
for Robert are understandable.

I must impress her that fewer White House levees are in
order. I realize it was proper to honor Prince Napoleon but there are few such
obligations. I shun osÂ­tentation. We have no right to ostentation these war
times. That money that goes into ostentation can go into blankets for the
soldiers.

A calm evening

Late

âDevoutly to be wishedâ...to have a woman, enjoy her
physically; yet preserve essential private values.

A helpmeet, yes, but it has been my misfortune to never
encounter such a woman who was also a woman.

Early in life, at East Salem, I learned about the
unhappiness of others.

Misguided lives are powerful guideposts.

In the wilderness I found something mystic, something out of
self for self. It taught me to be legally self.

In Springfield, I studied its citizens, its girls and women;
I found that being an outsider was wise.

My wisdom is indeed my misfortune.

The White House

2/15/65

Yesterday a woman came to me, crying, sobbing, pleading for
the release of one of her sons from service, since her husband and three sons
were in the army.

I wrote a discharge for one of her sons and gave her
instructions where to go and what to say, to get her lad released.

She found the military camp, regiment, company; she found
her son wounded, dying in a nearby hospital. After his death she begged:

âMr. President, will you give me the next one of my boys?â
Again she proÂ­duced official papers.

âI have just lost a son... I have another,â I managed to
say. As she stood beÂ­side my chair I wrote a release; as I wrote she placed her
hand on my head and smoothed my hair with a motherâs touch.

When I gave her the document she ran sobbing, crying her
thanks.

The White House

2/18/65

Again I admit that dreams have perplexed me. I also think
them significant if we can interpret them properly.

Last week I had a dream that has haunted me ever since.
After it occurred I opened the Bible. Strange as it may seem, it was at the
28th chapter of
Genesis,
which relates the wonderful dream of Jacob. I
turned to other passages... I seemed to encounter a vision wherever I looked.

I should not have related the dream to Mary but the thing
got possession of me, and, like Banquoâs ghost, it would not down.

As I told her I felt something grabbing at my throat.

About ten days ago I went to bed late. I had been waiting
for important disÂ­patches from the front. I was very weary and fell asleep as
soon as I lay down. Then I began to dream.

There seemed to be a death-like stillness about me; then I
heard subdued sobs, as if a number of people were weeping. I thought I left my
bed and wanÂ­dered downstairs. There the silence was broken by the same sobbing,
but any mourners were invisible. I walked from room to room; every object was
familiar. I was puzzled, alarmed. I kept on until I arrived at the East Room.
There I met a sickening surprise.

Before me was a catafalque, on which rested a corpse, in
funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers acting as guards. Beyond
the soldiers was a crowd.

âWho is dead in the White House?â I asked one of the
soldiers.

âThe President,â he replied. âHe was killed by an assassin.â

An outburst of grief came from the crowd.

I woke...

Mary was very disturbed by my dream; I gained nothing by
telling her; in tears she threw herself on her bed.

âDonât repeat your dream to anyone,â she said.

2/21/65

How blustery, more like December or January; it will be
raining soon.

This morning, when it was more
pleasant, I visited the Potomac Book Shop where Willie and I used to buy books.
Here and there were a few soldiers. I was pleased, especially when one of them
asked me if I would recommend a book of
poetry.

On my last visit I bought Popeâs
Essay

on
Man.

I noticed a British copy bound in morocco. At the Potomac I have acquired some
Emerson, Wordsworth, Longfellow. I picked up a copy of
Leaves of Grass
,
but it did not appeal to me. The shop reminds me of one in Boston; I told the
owner; he laughed: âThe shop you mention belongs to my brother... I furnished
this one with Boston pieces.â

I hope I can get Tad to take an interest in learning to
read. Willieâs enthusiÂ­asm did not rub off on him.

Returning to the White House, one of our horses threw a
shoe.

February 27, â65

Hill tells me we have imprisoned a Confederate citizen who
was delivering a Â£40,000 draft to the Southern forces. He also jailed a M.
Louis de Bedian, who had letters of credit ($39,000), for the Confederate army.
He has apprehended Charles Kopperl, Washington resident, who boasts that he
killed Union soldiers. Obviously, Washington has strange, determined men.

Some countrymen objected to Hillâs political imprisonments,
and I am critiÂ­cized, in turn. Again nepotism ghosts.

Billy Herndon has walked into my office. Our get-together
seemed as though we were in Springfield, in the old office. I threw out
questions about friends; he had the answers. The weather favored us as we
rambled around Washington, in the presidential coach. Together we explored the
White HouseâBillyâs highÂ­point. We had dinner, with Tad at our table.

Billy gave Tad a hand-carved pony express rider, in walnut.
My books interÂ­ested Billy. He thought my walnut bed a worldâs wonder. âIs it
really nine feet long!â The carvings on the headboard amused him, and the wooden
nest with its walnut eggs, under my side table. We parted reluctantly.

I wish I had ten men of his caliber to work with here. He
went away quite shaken by the cost of the war. âHow could it be...$2,000,000
every single day... Can our country recover such an outlay?â

March 9th

The Library

We can not escape history. We, of this administration, will
be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance
can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light
us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last generation.

The great books in this room confirm this. The sun in the
windows has promise.

Spring is with us along the Potomac. Through my open windows
I hear it.

I wish I could place a sprig of lilacs on my motherâs grave.

Tomorrow we will visit Willieâs grave, but we will leave Tad
with friends. His new pony is coming in a day or two; that will make him happy.
I bought a ShetÂ­land, brown and white.

Mallards mix with small craft. Thereâs not a breath of air moving;
life is making a turn.

Wednesday

After reviewing troops on Monday I had that dream. I was
staring at myself in a mirror, a full length mirror. I was seeing myself
doubleâdouble vision. This time I seemed to perceive myself as traitor. Traitor
to what?

Reviewing troops is an experience that shatters satisÂ­faction.
How can a man, a thoughtful man, watch men on parade and minimize the fact that
some or all of those men will soon be dead or wounded? Or will maim or kill
other men?

Last Monday the troops slogged past in heavy rain.

White House

Monday morning

The signs look better. Peace does not appear so distant as
it did. I hope it will come soon, and come to stay; and so come as to be worth
keeping in all future time. It will then have been proved that among free men
there can be no sucÂ­cessful appeal from the ballot to the bullet, and that they
who take such appeal are sure to lose their case to pay the cost.

And then there will be some black men who can remember that
with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised
bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation, while I fear
there will be some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and
deceitful speech they strove to hinder it.

The White House

Saturday

Again I have visited the Patent Office, this time in the
evening, after a tedious meeting. I was accompanied by my escort, cavalrymen
with rattling sabers, spirÂ­ited horses. At the Office I was struck by a vivid
recollection of how it used to be, before the war, the rows of cabinets and
cases, each containing models of inventions.

Now cases and cabinets have been pushed aside or removed.
Flush along the walls are row after row of wounded, as many as four rows deep,
the wounded and their beds and cots reflected in dull glass doors.

Lamps and candles gleamed and smoked among the soldiers. I
shook hands, passing from row to row. I talked, sat down. Here were signs of
resignation, flashes of courage and hope.

Patent Office, I thought, you have a patent on suffering and
death. As I stood, talking with doctors and nurses, they carried a man away.

âThereâs such a shortage of medical supplies,â a beautiful
nurse exclaimed. âIsnât there something you can do to help? Did you know there
are 12,000 wounded in and around the city?â

Noteâ

T. Office. See Seward and Blain.

The White House

March 20, â65

With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness
in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work
we are in; to bind up the nationâs wounds; to care for him who shall have borne
the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan...to do all which may achieve and
cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.

That is my prayer.

Something resembling peace came as I wrote.

7 a.m.

Office

A lieutenant visited my office one afternoon last week, a
thin ghost of a man. Sitting in a chair alongside my desk, he seemed to totter,
to lean toward the sun coming in the window.

He showed me pieces of bone that had been removed from a
shoulder wound, laying them on my desk, in the sun.

I talked with him for about an hour, questioning about his
army experiences, his home...he is mustered out. Back to Albany.

A soldier bumped into me on the White House grounds,
swearing because he had not been able to get his pay; his crutch poked at the
ground, his leg-stump jerked, as he talked to me.

âLet me see your papers? Remember, Iâve been a lawyer and
maybe I can help.â

Jip is dead.

March 28th, â65

Someone is singing outside my office, singing that old
favorite, âMassaâs in de cole, cole ground.â

Memories.

I see the newspaper heading:

5,000
COTTON BALES BURNED.

Baton
Rouge, last week bales were piled in the Commons, soaked with alcoÂ­hol, and
burned. At this date, bales are valued at $100.00 per bale.

Another item, by the same reporter:

Two
flatboats, loaded with cotton bales, were floated down the Mississippi, at New
Orleans. Soaked with alcohol, they were set afire...

My little mulatto brings me my lunch; she bows and says:

âGood day, mistaaaaa President...cawnbread...thais cawnbread
on my tray...â

March 29th

I have gone through my desk today, weeding out.

I have had a pigeonhole marked: A.

Thatâs for assassination.

I think there were about eighty ânonymous threats in that
pigeonhole. I have thrown them into the fireplace. I should have done this long
ago. Some of the threats were made by persons who had never been to Washington,
whose geoÂ­graphical knowledge would have led them to the stables rather than
the White House. Some seemed to think I resided in the Washington monument. One
perÂ­son proposed that he assassinate me on the Presidential yacht. No doubt he
felt that would please the press and general public.

It is uncommonly chilly this afternoon; I think I will have
a fire in the fireÂ­place. We can have some oak logs to burn up the ashes of the
assassins.

General Grant and I have been on friendly terms for a long
while. He likes to talk about his farming days in Missouri. He used to haul wood
ten or twelve miles into St. Louis. $10.00 a cord. He is proud of his log
cabin, which he deÂ­signed and built, a two-story.

At his HQ we sat under a tent flap and talked. He unfolded a
letter from his wife and showed me his babyâs smudge print. Wife and son are
two thousand miles away.

I talked about my courtship days, and Grant said:

â...Let me tell you how I got hitched. We were buggy riding
and had to cross a flooded creek. As the buggy sank into the water and the
water poured in, she yelled: âIâm gonna hold onto you no matter what happens.â
After we crossed I asked her: âWould you like to cling to me the rest of your
life?â Or something like that.â

We got to talking horses. I described some of my nags and
some of my faithÂ­fuls. He talked about his West Point horses, thoroughbreds...
Wilma could out-hurdle any other...six foot six inches...then he talked about
Mexican horses and Mexican saddles...you should see the one I got as
booty...silver ornaments...

It was good to get away from Washington.

When I reviewed Grantâs troops, I rode his Cincinnati, a
huge bay. The solÂ­diers are always pleased by my visits. I remove my hat and
bow. Men clamor around me, huzzahing. They stroke Cincinnati. They kiss my
hand: these are the blacks who are willing to fight for the union. Grant
singled out a corps: recently, they had captured six cannons, under fire all
the time.

Cincinnati whuffs and bobs his splendid head, as Grant and I
ride along, a woodland around us.

After lunch in his tent, he gave me a lieutenantâs diary,
written at Shiloh.

Our General Grant sat on his horse
and watched the enemy try to capture a hill. Men fought from tree to tree. A man
near me has been shot while aiming his rifle, one eye is closed, one eye is
still open. A corporal has been disemboweled by a cannon ball. Riderless horses
are running wild. Trees are plugged with lead bullets. I counted sixty bullets
in a small tree.

I plan to collect personal accounts of the war; men must know.

Mary Mitchell, a volunteer nurse, has written:

The wounded filled every building
and overflowed into the country around, into farm houses, barns, corncribs,
cabins. Six churches were full, the Odd Fellowsâ Hall, the Freemasonsâ, the
Town Council room, the school. I saw men with cloths about their heads, about
their feet, men with arms in slings, men without arms, men in ambulances,
carts, wheelbarrows.

At the center of this autumn
harvest stood the little white Dunker church, where the teaching on Sundays was
that war is a sin. There the dead lay in gray and blue. In the fields lay
thousands. Corn leaves over some of them were spattered with blood.

Grant and I ride. There is mud on the horses. His officers
crowd round. Grant helps me dismount. We talk. Grant speaks favorably of yesterdayâs
battle, speaks with a rasping voice, hand to his throat. Behind his chair lies
a muddy saddle. It is cloudy, cold. A private brings a dispatch. Grant reads it
and nods. I respect this man.

Cabinet members reveal their excitement. Rumors. But the
rumors may have solid foundations. Grant, they say. Sherman, he left to rejoin
his army. His army will move. My secretaries believe in the rumors. Seward is
optimistic. Hill waves his arms. Of course. At the telegraph office the men say
âyes.â It is a kind of yes that could mean almost anything. The newspapers are
reporting this same news.

Mary has spent $2,000 for a gown. She has spent $3,000 for
earrings. $5,000 for a lace shawl.

She thinks I do not know about these extravagances. My
previous efforts at control produce hysteria, hysteria that lasted for days.

I remember Ann Rutledge.

I order the brougham and drive.

The April weather is fine.

As the war draws to a close I remember that four million
people have been involved in this struggle.

I have heard from Robert but he reports that his motherâs
letters are unbalÂ­anced. He has offered to bring them to the White House when
he has leave. He says that her letters have been distraught for months. He is
deeply concerned over her condition.

Evening

Desk

Details are coming in.

General William T. Sherman, with his 60,000 men, has cut a
swath across inÂ­surgent territory, a swath twenty to forty miles wide, and
three hundred miles long.

All day the news comes.

All items confirm the success of his march.

Shermanâs men have foraged off the country; their
devastation of property has been extreme; miles of railroad track have been
ripped up; rolling stock has been captured; his forces advanced ten or twelve
miles a day. The Confederate press refers to his march as a scourge.

Savannahâthat was Shermanâs gift on Christmas.

Now, across the nation, a million and a half slaves have
been freed.

Wednesday we went to Richmond by boat, a party of us, the
day clear. Most of Richmond is gutted. Smoke is rising from burned buildings,
buildings burned by the retreating Southern army. I walked a main street,
holding Tadâs hand, our escort with us. Along both sides of the street were
derelict people, blacks and whites, hungry people, uncertain what our presence
meant to them.

I walked into the capitol building, sat hesitantly at the
desk of President JefÂ­ferson Davis. Sitting there, the escort nearby, I
remembered a pubic statement made by Davis, that blacks are children, that
slavery is their training school.

In the streets we were met by cheering blacks; they wished
to crowd around, realizing we meant no harm.

I sent men to that hellhole, Libby Prison, where thousands
of our men have died of starvation and disease and torture; they are to be
freed from that tobacco warehouse cesspool.

Riding in a carriage we saw the devastation of the city,
ashes and memories. Five years ago today there were three million slaves.

Palm Sunday

1865

In the salon of the
River
Q
ueen
I met with my
guests as we sailed up the PoÂ­tomac, the river calm and the air fresh. We
talked of the ruins of Richmond, the looters, the burned buildings, the wounded
in tent hospitals. I saw a general feeling of sympathy.

During
the afternoon, a military band played for usâthe âMarseillaiseâ for my special
guest, the Marquis de Chambrun; we had âDixieâ and Foster meloÂ­dies for the
congressmen and their wives.

As we sailed by Mount Vernon someone asked me about
Springfield: did I think of returning after my second term? I thought it proper
to say that my home was no Mount Vernon but I looked forward to returning.

The meals on our flagship were excellent. Tad was always
hungry. Mary did not relish the food, or enjoy some of the guests. All of us
know the war is windÂ­ing down. General Lee has lost 19,000 men, as prisoners to
Grant.

I canât remember when I have felt so encouraged.

As I lay in my bunk I could see in my mind a tree that
reminded me of great trees I saw as a boy, trees with great shadows. It is
worth a manâs time to hold communion with trees. The trunk of this tree, seen
on the river bank, supported layers of outgoing branches.

Next morning I read to guests in the salon. I read from
Macbeth.

I always find it relaxing to read aloud, though my glasses sometimes bother me.
I explained how Macbeth suffered mentally after becoming king. I helped my
listeners visuÂ­alize the murderer. I read from the quarto, graciously given me
by Dr. Bancroft.

With Tad sitting at my feet, I read:

...After lifeâs fitful fever he sleeps well;

Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,

Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing

Can touch him further.

The White House

Library

Here I attempt to find sanctuary, among the poets.

Now I realize that Mary is going insane.

Only imbalance could bring about such reactions; no one can
forget her inÂ­sults to Grant, to officers and friends at his headquarters. All
this distress cenÂ­tered on an innocent pretty woman.

For years I have detected imbalance in Mary. It has come
into focus followÂ­ing Willieâs death. Hysteria, illnesses, doctors.

I am puzzled why I have persisted in this diary. For a time
it seemed fitting to write it for my sons; for a while I considered Mary. As
President, I thought of posterity. However posterity should have a solid
record, objective, and this reÂ­cord, written at odd moments, emotional, leaves
much to be desired.

While with Grant at the front lines, seeing men dead in the
field, a man withÂ­out hands dying, after seeing lifeless boys in the woods, I
asked and I ask again, why do I add to these pages?

For a while it seemed to me I was learning about myself and
others through these jottings. With Maryâs decline I find more question marks
here, question marks beyond warâs great question marks; these question marks
began with Ann Rutledge, resumed in East Salem, continued along the Mississippi
and on my legal circuits. For years they lay dormant in Springfield, in the
Lincoln house with the green shutters.

Executive Mansion

April 4, 1865

The capitol is decorated from dome to portico.

Victory!

Flags are everywhere.

The weather is fine.

The
Treasury building has a huge bond picked out in lights. Cookeâs Bank has GLORY
TO GOD spelled out in golden stars. Hotels, shops, restaurants are festive, I
am told. Bands play âDixieâ and âYankee Doodle,â Irish tunes, FosÂ­terâs songs.
Fireworks and rockets explode over the Potomac. Cannon boom.

Horsemen, carriages, wagons, buggies, pedestrians...there
isnât a quiet corner in Washington!

This morning, General Grant shook my hand sadly, hardly a
victory gesture. I did not try to penetrate his mood.

Tomorrow I am to speak to a crowd in front of the White
House. I will try to envision a sane future. Rain is forecast. It will not
matter, nothing is going to diminish the enthusiasm.

Robert is due here tomorrow.

Mary remains in her bedroom.

General Lee has surrendered his forces at the McLean House,
at AppomatÂ­tox. Grant has permitted Lee and his men to return to their homes;
they may retain their mounts. Lee pointed out that his army was holding a
thousand Union prisoners, prisoners who have nothing to eat but parched corn.
His own men amply supplied, Grant has turned over 25,000 rations to Leeâs men
and fed the Union prisoners.

As I write, fire engines roar, whistles blow, church bells
ring.

This morning there was a salute of a hundred guns.

I spoke to a throng in front of the White House. The
newspapers will carry my words but I also add them here, thinking to improve
the text.

Mary is ill...all very unreal.

An end like a beginning can have a bitter edge.

Let us think as brothers. The great rebellion, which we have
endured toÂ­gether, must be forgotten. Now, starting at once, each state must be
granted full privileges of the Union as soon as state governments can organize
and as soon as 10% of its citizens have taken the oath of allegiance. It is our
national goal to offer clemency and pardon as we attain peace, peace for our
democracy. I will at once lift the naval blockade. I will urge Congress to
appropriate $400,000,000 to assist the South in its economic recovery. Ours is
no longer a nation within a nation; ours is a victory for all mankind.

April 10, 1865

Evening

Beautiful sunset

Now that the war is over, Grant thinks we can reduce army
expenditures by at least a half a million per day. We can reduce navy costs at
the same time; this will bring down our national debt to something like normal
proportions.

I am cheered by such prospects.

Peace is ahead and I will be exploring its possibilities
intensively. It will be a pleasure to convene a cabinet meeting, to discuss
economic changes, foreign relations, amnesty, rail expansion, and state laws. I
find a new amicability in senÂ­ate and house.

In another two or three months it may be possible to have a
week or so in the Adirondacks, the three of us.

The White House

Sundayâlate

Many have come to congratulate me on the cessation of the
war, warm praise now that the union is preserved. Telegrams flood the telegraph
office. Boys are always seeking me out, with their hands full of messages. I
read newspapers with pleasure. Letters are piling up on my desk; my secretaries
are complaining hapÂ­pily.

Everyone in Washington is celebrating. There are parties in
homes, in churches, schools, hospitals and public buildings. The White House
has schedÂ­uled a gala. I am happier than I have been in years.

I look forward to attending a play at Fordâs Theatre
.

I am told that it is a play full of puns. I am in a mood for something light.

I am also told that we are having corn bread at supper.

The White House

April 14, 1865

ârainâ

Mary invited Laura Keene, the British actress, to tea. She
is in her fortiesârather pretty. Dressed in dark green velvet she suggested
something of quality in the theatre. She has her own playhouse in New York
City. Her talk was mostly about her acting days in London where she produced
and acted in foreign and American plays.

She said that she is a friend of Taylor, the author of
Our

American

Cousin.
âHe has written over a hundred plays,â she told
us.

I spun a frontier story or two; she listened rather
absently, her hands in her lap; Mary queried her about forthcoming New York
productions; very abruptly Miss Keene exclaimed that she hated war; she said
that slavery could have been abolished without destroying lives.

When Tad bounced in she made over him. He took to her,
laughing hilariÂ­ously over her British accent as she asked him to solve a
riddle.

âSay it again, pretty lady,â he urged her.

âIâve heard good things about
Our

American

Cousin
,â
I said. âI guess you alÂ­ready know that weâll be seeing the play tomorrow
night.â

About the
Author

P

aul Alexander Bartlett (1909-1990) was a writer and
artist, born in Moberly, Missouri, and educated at Oberlin College, the
University of Arizona, the Academia de San Carlos in Mexico City, and the
Instituto de Bellas Artes in Guadalajara. His work can be divided into three
categories: He is the author of many novels, short stories, and poems; second,
as a fine artist, his drawings, illustrations, and paintings have been exÂ­hibited
in more than forty one-man shows in leading galleries, including the Los
Angeles County Museum, the Atlanta Art Museum, the Bancroft Library, the
Richmond Art Institute, the Brooks Museum, the
Instituto-Mexicano-Norteamericano in Mexico City, and many other galleries;
and, third, he devoted much of his life to the most comprehensive study of the
haciendas of Mexico that has been undertaken. More than 350 of his pen-and-ink
illustrations of the haciendas and more than one thousand hacienda photographs
make up the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection held by the Nettie Lee Benson
Latin American Collection of the University of Texas, and form part of a second
diversified colÂ­lection held by the American Heritage Center of the University
of Wyoming, which also includes an archive of Bartlettâs literary work, fine
art, and letters.

Paul Alexander Bartlettâs fiction has been commended by many
authors, among them Pearl Buck, Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, James
Michener, Upton Sinclair, Evelyn Eaton, and many others. He was the recipient
of many grants, awards, and fellowships, from such organizations as the Leopold
Schepp Foundation, the Edward MacDowell Association, the New School for Social
Research, the Huntington Hartford Foundation, the Montalvo Foundation, and the
Carnegie Foundation.

His wife, Elizabeth Bartlett, a widely published poet, is
the author of sevenÂ­teen published books of poetry, numerous poems, short
stories, and essays pubÂ­lished in leading literary quarterlies and anthologies,
and, as the founder of Literary Olympics, Inc., is the editor of a series of
multi-language volumes of international poetry that honor the work of
outstanding contemporary poets.

Paul and Elizabethâs son, Steven, edited and designed this
volume.

Voices from the Past

was set in Garamond type by Autograph Editions. The
typeface is
named after Claude Garamond
(c. 1480-1561), a French type designer and publisher and the worldâs first
commercial typefounder. Garamondâs contribution to the history of typesetting
was substantial. He perfected the design of Roman type: The fonts that he cut
beginning in 1531 were recognized as possessing a superior grace and clarity,
so much so that Garamondâs fonts influenced European printing for the next cenÂ­tury
and a half.

It
is interesting to note that Garamond type is the evolutionary ancestor of the
type used to print the first official copies of the Declaration of
Independence. In the 1730s, Englishman William Caslon refined Garamondâs
version of Aldine roman, the well-balanced typeface became popular, and was
introduced to the American colonies by Benjamin Franklin.

Despite
his considerable contribution to the evolution of typography, Garamond was not
a successful businessman and he died in poverty.

During
the past five centuries, so many variations of Garamondâs type designs have
been created that the phrase âGaramond typeâ has come to be used loosely, with
little memory remaining of its history.

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

HISTORY OF RUSSIA.

CHAPTER X.

ALEXANDER NEVSKIâMIKHAIL OF TVER.

We have seen that Mstislaf the Brave defied the tyranny
of AndreÃ¯ Bogoliubski, in his attempt to intimidate Novgorod
the Great.
[A]
When Vsevolod, surnamed Big Nest, by
reason of his large family, would force the city to his will,
Mstislaf again came to its rescue; and when Iaroslaf of the
Big Nest family, continuing the feud, betook himself to
Torjok near the Volga, where he obstructed the passage of
the merchants and brought famine upon the great city,
Mstislaf the Bold, of Smolensk, son of the Brave, left his
powerful capital, one of the strongest of Russiaâs fortified
cities, and went to the help of the distressed people. âTorjok
shall not hold herself higher than the Lord Novgorod,â
he swore in princely fashion, âI will deliver his lands, or
leave my bones for his people to bury.â Thus he became
champion and prince of the Republic. Between Iaroslaf
and his brothers Iuri of Vladimir, and Konstantin of Rostof
ensued one of the family wrangles common to the times,
that was settled on the field of Lipetsk (1216), where Konstantin
allied with Mstislaf won his cause, and Iaroslaf was
compelled to renounce both his claims and his captives.
When the bold Mstislaf had put the affairs of the principality
in order, he took formal leave of the
vetchÃ©
, assembled
in the court of Iaroslaf, and resisting their entreaties
to abide with them, went as we have seen to the aid of Daniel
of Galitsch.
[B]
But according to his wish he was buried
beside his father, the Brave, who, when at the height of his
greatness was borne down with disease, commanded that
he should be carried to Saint Sophia in Novgorod, received
there the eucharist amid the congregated citizens, crossed
his once mighty arms upon his breast, and closed his eyes
forever upon the scenes that had witnessed his achievements.
In the cathedral lie the two warriors in mute company,
with the consort of Iaroslaf the Great, his son Vladimir,
who laid its foundations, the archbishop Nikita, whose
prayers extinguished a conflagration, and a goodly company
of other illustrious dead.

In course of time the Iaroslaf who had renounced his
claim to the Republic after the defeat at Lipetsk, was elected
its prince, he being also Prince of Suzdal; but he was compelled
to make good his claim before the Grand Khan in
Asia, and perished in the desert journey. Of his two sons,
AndreÃ¯ succeeded him at Vladimir (Suzdal), and Alexander
at Novgorod.

The incoming of the Tatars had left the Russian realm a
prey to its northern neighbors,âthe Finnish tribes, the
Livonians and Swedes. In his early years Alexander proved
his capacity for leadership by a battle won against these
united forces near one of the affluents of the Nevaâan exploit
that gained him his surname Nevski, and that has been
commemorated in the historical ballads of his people. An
Ingrian, a newly Christianized chief in the Russian service,
on the eve of the engagement, beheld Boris and Gleb, the
martyred sons Saint Vladimir, the Castor and Pollux of
Russian tradition, standing in a phantom boat, rowed by
phantom oarsmen, toward the camp of their countrymenâgoing
to the help of their kinsman Alexander. âRow, my
men!â said one of the brothers, ârow, for the rescue of the
Russian land!â In the hour of conflict, one of the captains pursued
Burger, the Swedish general, through the water to his
ship, but swam back successfully and mixed again in the fray,
when he reached the firm land. The exploits of another
knight are sung who brought in three Swedish galleys.
Gabriel, Skuilaf of Novgorod, tore away Burgerâs tent and
hewed down its ashen post, amid the cheers of his men;
and Alexander with a stroke of his lance âimprinted his
seal on Burgerâs face.â Rough work was this, in rude times;
but thus was the national strength asserted, and the national
honor protected.

Novgorod, like all the republics of medieval times, recognized
the principle of caste distinctions, and hence was subject
to the dissensions consequent upon an enlarged freedom
in conflict with these class divisions. Its tendency was toward
oligarchy. As monarchies adjacent to it increased in
size and strength, it was constrained to form protective alliances
now with the one, now with the other; but to the
latest period of its independence it cautiously guarded its
civic rights and laws against the encroachments of princely
power. Some differences between the citizens and Alexander
led him to withdraw from the city; but the incursions
of the Sword-Bearers with their train of northern tribes,
made his presence again necessary at the head of the army.
He conducted a campaign characterized by extreme bitterness
on both sides, and ending in a conflict on Lake PeÃ¯pus,
the Battle of the Ice, in 1242, when a multitude of the
Tchudi were exterminated and the Livonian Knights were
seriously crippled. The Grand Master expected to see his
[428]

redoubtable foeman before the walls of Riga; but Alexander
contented himself with reprisals, and a recovery of the lands
wrested from the Republic.

Through a score or more of years, partly by reason of its
remote northern location, and its relations with the western
powers, Novgorod had evaded the imposition of the
Tatar yoke, put upon the rest of the realm. But the time
came when the khan at SaraÃ¯ determined to bring under his
sway the region of the lakes; and Alexander, with his
brother AndreÃ¯, was summoned to the Horde for confirmation
of their duties as vassal princes. Batui, the khan, received
the hero of the Neva with consideration, and added
to his domains large tracts of Southern Russia, including
the Principality of Kief; but with these largesses was imposed
the humiliating task of raising tribute for the Mongol
court. When the
posadnik
announced this hard command
to the
vetchÃ©
of Novgorod, the people, paying no heed to
his cautious and qualified phrasing, uttered a terrible cry,
and tore him limb from limb. A rebellion, headed by Alexanderâs
son, Vasili, gathered force, till the rumor spread that
the Asiatics were moving toward the city. Yielding for a
time to the necessity imposed upon them, the people again
rallied, this time around Saint Sophia, and declared they
would meet their fate, be it what it might, rather than submit
to the unendurable subjugation. Alexander sent them
word that he must leave them to themselves, and go elsewhere.
The Mongol emissaries were at the gates: the people
in the acquiescence of despair admitted them to their streets.
During the days that the baskaks, census-takers and tax-gatherers,
went from house to houseâand the days were
many, for the city covered an area hardly less than that of
London in this centuryâits industries were suspended,
its stirring, joyous life extinguished in silence and gloom.
The priceless possession of the state, its freedom and
independence, was lost: and though the great lords and
wealthy burghers might still boast of their wealth, the simple
citizens had lost what they had believed to be an
enduring heritage, and what they had cherished as an
enduring hope.

Yet a restricted freedom still remained: nor till three centuries
later was this sacrificed to the power of the Muscovite
and the unity of the Russias. Even then the history
of the republic belonged to the Empire. The right of representation,
of government by laws, and by the free consent
of the governed, were matters of history not to be forgotten.
The most rigid of Russian despots could not utterly ignore
them, and they have produced an element of unrest that,
however painful in its immediate results, is yet inevitable
and healthful and hopeful. They have been one of the influences
at work, bringing to tens and hundreds of thousands
of lips the watch-word uttered since the reign of Nicholas,
on the rivers, on the mountain boundaries, in the mines, the
residence of the noble, the factory, and the hut of the
peasantâ
Svobodnaya Rossia:
Free Russia.

Everywhere the collection of the tribute was attended
with revolts. One in Suzdal, sure to bring terrible reprisals
upon the people, compelled Alexander to a second journey
to the Horde, where he had also to excuse himself for failure
to send his military contingent. The chronicles aver
that the men were defending their western frontiers at this
time. The khan detained his noble vassal for a year. On
his return journey the prince, whose bravery had endured
so sore a conflict with his sagacity and prudence, and whose
health had weakened, died at a town several daysâ journey
from Vladimir. When the tidings were brought to Novgorod,
the Metropolitan Kyrill, who was celebrating a religious
service, announced to the congregation: âLearn, my
dear children, that the sun of Russia is set.â âWe are lost,â
they answered, and sobs were heard from all parts of the
church.

Long will this Alexander, âhelper of men,â be revered
by his countrymen. Religion and patriotism with
them are one; hence it is not strange that he is enrolled
among the saints of the Church. As protector of the modern
capital, his name is given to its stateliest promenade.
The monastery dedicated to his memory is one of the three
Lauras, or seats of the Metropolitans, filled with treasures
and shrines of the illustrious dead. Thither repair the sovereigns
before the undertaking of momentous enterprises,
even as the Nevski bowed before the Divine Justice in Saint
Sophia, ere he went forth upon his expeditions and journeys.
His timely submission saved the realm from further
exhaustion, while his military successes preserved it from
sinking under the hardest subjection that has ever been imposed
upon a European people.

Daniel, a son of this renowned prince, received as part of
his appanage the devastated town of Moscow, which up to
this time had been an obscure place, unnoticed by the annalists,
beyond the mention of its origin. They record that
in 1043 the Grand Prince Iuri Dolgoruki,
[C]
while on a journey,
tarried at the domain of a boyar who for some reason
he caused to be put to death; that having his attention directed
to certain heights washed by the river Moskova, he
brought settlers thither, who built a village on the spot at
present covered by the Kreml. A little church, Our Savior
of the Pines, is still preserved, a relic of these early days.
Daniel and his sons increased their domains by the annexation
of several cities; and during the life of Iuri, the second
son, was initiated a feud with the house of Tver, that
endured through eighty years ere it was closed by the merging
of the principality into that of Moscow. The contests of
the two kinsmen at the court of the Horde, illustrate the subserviency
of the princes to their conquerors. With many of
them no deceptions or malice were too base for the forwarding
of their purposes. Iuri, by his representations, contrived
to obtain the arrest of the Prince of Tver. While
the khan was enjoying the chase in the region of the Caucasus,
Mikhail was pilloried in the market-place of a town
of Daghestan, an object of wondering comment to the populace.
Both there and when held a prisoner in his tent, he
bore his sufferings with fortitude, consoling himself with
prayer and with the Psalms of David. As his hands were
bound, an attendant held the open book before him. His
nobles would have contrived his escape, but he remonstrated:
âEscape and leave you to the anger of my foe? Leave
my principality to go down without its ruler and father?
If I can not save it, I can, at least, suffer with it.â Later,
when speaking with his young son, Konstantine, of their
far-off home, tears filled his eyes, and his soul was troubled.
He repeated the words of the Fifty-fifth Psalm: âFearfulness
and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
overwhelmed me.â An attendant priest endeavored to console
him with the words: âCast thy burden upon the Lord
and he shall sustain thee. He suffers not the righteous to
be moved.â The prince responded: âO, that I had wings
like a dove; then would I flee away and be at rest.â Iuri
had procured a death-warrant for his cousin, and attended
by hired ruffians approached the tent, from which the boyars
and attendants had been ordered away. âI know his
purpose,â said Mikhail, as they took his hand in parting.
When the murder was done, Kavgadi, a Tatar, beholding
the torn and naked body, exclaimed against the indignity,
and ordered it to be covered with a mantle. Long did the
Tverians bewail their martyred prince. His body, incorruptible,
it was averred, was recovered and laid to rest in
their cathedral, where the pictured record of his fate is still
vivid on its walls. He, too, is a saint, exalted by suffering,
as Alexander was exalted by heroism. Some years later,
[429]

when his son, Dmitri of the Terrible Eyes, met at SaraÃ¯ the
murderer of his father, âhis sword leaped from its scabbard,â
and laid him low. He rendered not unwillingly his
own life in its prime as atonement for this act of filial vengeance.
Then, as now, a quick, and, as they say, an uncontrollable
impulse moved many a Russ to similar, sometimes
to inexplicable acts.

A third Prince of Tver escaped from the plots of his
grasping Muscovite neighbor, Ivan Kalita, or Alms-bag,
(1328) so called from that article that hung ever at his girdle.
Yet as he acquired great wealth by his prudent management,
which increased the commerce and industries of his
realm, he had not repute for self-denying charity. He established
markets and fairs along the Volga, that added to his
revenues with many hundred pounds of silver: probably
in the
poltiras
, or half-pounds, current from the time of
Saint Vladimir to the fifteenth century. About the year
1389 coins of silver and copper were substituted for the
marten skins that had been used as a medium of barter. A
hundred and fifty years later were introduced the rouble
and copek,
[D]
the coins most in use of the modern currency.
Ivan also enriched the Kreml with several stately churches,
among them the Cathedral of the AssumptionâUspenski Soborâwhere
for above three hundred years the tsars have
crowned themselves,âthe most sacred of all the Russian
churches in the estimation of the people. From one of its
interior corners rises the shrine of the Metropolitan, Saint
Peter, who is said to have prophesied to his sovereign: âIf
thou wilt comfort my hoary years, wilt build here a temple
worthy of thy estate, and our religion; this thy city shall be
chief of all the cities of Russia. Through many centuries
shall thy race reign here in strength and glory. Their hands
shall prevail against their enemies, and the saints shall dwell
in their borders.â

Kalita is regarded as the first of the Muscovite princes.

A GLANCE AT THE HISTORY AND
LITERATURE OF SCANDINAVIA.

By L.A. SHERMAN,
Ph.D.

VII.âESAIAS TEGNÃR: JOHANN LUDVIG RUNEBERG.

Now that we have finished our Carolinian romance, shall
we hear something of the author? He is certainly a brilliant
poet, for his story which we have been reading is no deep-planned
and long worked-over effort, but was written in the
few days after a severe sickness when the author could not
yet leave his couch. He wrote it to occupy his mind, and
beguile the time. How is he esteemed in Sweden? Will
it be thought incredible when I say no old hero, not even
Charles XII., is reverenced there more deeply, no name is
cherished so fondly,âthat no man so nearly seems worthy
to be called the father of his country, as this same poet-bishop,
Esaias TegnÃ©r?

All this is hard to explain, so many-sided was the life he
led. We need to realize that he was more active as a bishop
and party-leader than a poet. Then to appreciate him in
the last capacity we must go among the Swedes themselves.
We shall find in him the bond of unity of a whole nation, in
that he has sung best the ancient glory of the race, and discovered
to the world the heroic integrity of the Northern
character. We shall note that it is he whose words are
most, next to the Bible, on the lips of every Swede. If we
go into a peasantâs cottage, far from railways and culture,
we shall be sure to find some one who has not only heard of
the great poet, but can even repeat for us whole cantos from
his âFrithiofâs Saga,ââperhaps all of âAxelâ itself. And nobody
even sets about learning these poems by heart: they
cling to the memory in spite of the reader.

But we must begin our history. Who were TegnÃ©râs parents?
What was their rank in life? C. W. BÃ¶ttiger,
TegnÃ©râs son-in-law, who wrote a short life of the poet, shall
answer for us:â

âA few years ago north of the church in Tegnaby, there
was seen a gray cottage fallen into ruins, with moss-grown
walls and two little windows of which one, according to the
ancient custom of the province, was in the roof. The people
regarded it with a kind of reverence; and if one asked the reason,
the hat was raised with the answer: âThe Bishopâs grandfather
once lived there.â His name was Lucas EsaiÂ´asson, his
wifeâs Ingeborg MÃ¤nsdotter. According to testimony handed
down traditionally in the parish, this Lucas Esaiasson was
a poor but exceedingly industrious and pious man. A peasant
during a greater part of the time when Charles XII. was
king, he continued yet twenty years after the âshot,â a
Carolinian at the plow. This and his Bible were his dearest
treasures, and all he had to leave to fourteen children, for
whom he procured bread with the plow after he had given
them names from the Scriptures. There was one called
Paul, another John, a third Enoch, and so on. A whole
temple-progeny was growing up under his lowly roof: the
Old and New Testaments were embracing each other in his
cottage. The youngest son, born on the day of King
Charlesâs death, was named Esaias. The older brothers inherited
their fatherâs plow, and became peasants; Esaias
inherited his fatherâs Bible and became a minister.â

We wish we could continue to quote Mr. BÃ¶ttiger, but
his story proceeds too slowly. This Esaias was the father
of our poet. Showing unusual aptitude for books, he was
taken from the farm where he had gone out to service, and
placed in the school of WexiÃ¶. Coming from the
by
or village
of Tegn, and having but one name, he was entered in
the school register, kept after the manner of the time in
Latin, as Esaias TegnÃ©rus. The latter, the Latin suffix
us

being omitted, became afterward the family name.

In due time this Esaias TegnÃ©r passed to the university,
and after graduation was ordained as we have seen, a minister.
He is remembered as a talented preacher, and merry
man of society. He married a pastorâs daughter whose
mother was celebrated for wit, force of character, and poetic
gifts. Like qualities reappear in a marked degree in our
poet, who was the fifth son of this marriage. He was born
in Kykerud [Chikerood], November 13, 1782, and took his
fatherâs name.

Ten years later the ministerâs family was broken up by
the death of the father. Two daughters and four sons were
thus left in a measure to the charity of the world. The
young Esaias was soon taken into the counting-room of one
Jacob Branting, a crown-bailiff of the province and friend
of the deceased pastor. Here he learned to keep accounts
and developed rapidly into a valuable clerk. All the leisure
he could command was given steadily to books. He read
everything he could find, particularly the old Norse sagas,
and amused himself by turning some of the driest themes
of history and biography into poetical form. The crisis in
his life came early. He had been in Brantingâs office four
years, and so won the respect and love of his employer as
to be thought of already as the future son-in-law and successor
to the office of bailiff. But Branting had observed
the ladâs genius for books, and was beginning to think him
fitted for something higher. One night, as they were riding
together, Esaias astonished him by rehearsing with some
minuteness the principles of astronomy, which he had gathered
from his reading. Brantingâs decision was at once
made. âYou shall study,â said he. âAs for the means,
[430]

God will supply the sacrifice, and
I
will not forget you.â

Young Esaias commenced at once to study Latin, Greek,
and French. So remarkable was his memory that he was
able, after glancing a few times over a list of fifty or sixty
words, to repeat them with their meanings. To his other
tasks he added later, the study of English, which he
learned by the aid of a translation of Ossian. A change
soon follows. Lars Gustaf, his oldest brother, not yet graduated
from the university, had been asked to serve as tutor
in the family of a rich manufacturer and owner of mines in
RÃ¤men. Lars consented on condition that he might bring
with him Esaias; for during his temporary absence from
the university he had undertaken to guide his brotherâs
work. The rich proprietor into whose house they were to
enter was Christopher Myhrman, a name prominent in the
history of Swedish manufactures. He had himself built up
the foundries and mills of RÃ¤men, turning the wilderness
into a large and flourishing town. Amid his multifold
business cares he always found time to read his favorite
Latin authors, and enjoy the society of his family, whose
circle at that time comprised eight vigorous sons and two
blooming daughters.

âTo this place, and to this circle it was,â says Mr. BÃ¶ttiger,
âthat Lars Gustaf and Esaias TegnÃ©r betook themselves
one beautiful summer afternoon in July, 1797. They had
traveled in a carriage over the road on which the owner of
the mills had been obliged, twenty years before, to bring his
wife home upon a pack-saddle; but they left the coach behind
them and now came on foot at their leisure through
the forest. Suddenly there burst upon their gaze the loveliest
prospect. On a point of land, extending out into the
water thickly set with islands, and encircled with birch and
fir, lay like a beautiful promise the pleasant garden sloping
in terraces to the sea, girded with the setting sun and covered
with shady trees. âWho knows what dwells under
their branches,â perhaps the poet-stripling was already asking,
with quickened pulses.
We
know what dwelt beneath
them. It was his good fortune he was coming here to meet;
it was amidst this smiling and magnificent nature that his
talents were destined to develop, his powers to be confirmed,
his wit to grow; it was over the threshold of this patriarchic
tabernacle that his knowledge was to be brought to
ripeness, and his heart find a companion for life.

âWhat here in the first room attracted his attention was
the big book-cases. He found them richly supplied not only
with Swedish, English, and French works, but also Greek
and Roman authors of every sort. With greedy eyes he
fixed himself especially by the side of a folio, on whose
leathern back he read:
Homerus
. It was Castalioâs edition,
printed in Basel in 1561. Here was an acquaintance
to make. He made it immediately, and in a manner of
which his own account is worthy of being told:â

ââSo without any grammatical foundation, I resolved to
attempt the task immediately. At the outset it naturally proceeded
slowly and tediously. The many dialectic forms of
which I had no idea at all, laid me under great difficulties,
which would probably have discouraged any less energetic
will. The Greek grammar I had used was adapted to prose
writers: of the poetic dialects nothing was said. I was
therefore compelled just here to devise a system for myself,
and further, to make notes from that time, which now show
that among many mistakes I sometimes was right. To
give way before any sort of difficulty was not at all my disposition;
and the farther I went, the easier my understanding
of the poet became. With the prose writers Xenophon
and Lucian, I also made at this time a flying acquaintance;
but they interested me little, and my principal work continued
to be with Homer, and also Horace in Latin, whom
I had not known before. French literature was richly represented
in this library; Rousseauâs, Voltaireâs, and Racineâs
works were complete, and were not neglected either.
Of Shakspere there was only Hamlet, which strangely
enough interested me very little. In German literature
there was not a single poet. That language I was compelled
to learn from the usual instruction books, and thus conceived
a repugnance to it which lasted for a long time.ââ

Thus in his first sojourn of seven months in RÃ¤men, the
future poet read the Iliad through three times, the Odyssey
twice, and from the same book-shelves Horace, Virgil, and
Ovidâs MetamÃ³rphoses. He was almost insane in his application
to study; yet his constitutional vigor, strange to
say, remained unimpaired. In 1799 he entered the university
of Lund, whither his father and two brothers had preceded
him. We will not linger for details of his industry
there. It will not surprise us to learn that on the âpromotionâ
(graduation) of his class in 1803, Esaias TegnÃ©r was
given the
primus
, or first place.

Immediately after the ceremony of graduation, TegnÃ©r
hastened to greet his friends and especially Jacob Branting
and Christopher Myhrman, whose liberality had in part
sustained him at the university. âAt RÃ¤men he was met
with open arms by the older members of the family, and
with secret trembling by a beating heart of sixteen years,
where his image stood concealed behind the memories of
childhood. His summer became an idyl,âthe first happiness
of love. . . . The traveler who approaches RÃ¤men
finds in the pine woods beside the way a narrow stone,
bearing the letters
E. T.
, and
A. M.
By this, one August
evening, two hearts swore to each other eternal fidelity.â

The university of Lund hastened to appropriate to itself
its brilliant alumnus, as private instructor in Ãsthetics.
Three years later occurred his marriage with Anna Myhrman.
For several years his lyre was silent. He believed
success for him lay in the line of scholarship, and only for
solace or merriment he tuned its chords. In 1808 appears
the first truly national and characteristic poem of this skald,
âTo the Defenders of Sweden.â âThis warlike dithyramb
sounded like an alarm-bell through every national breast.
Tones at once so defiant and so beautiful had not been heard
before. These double services as instructor and poet attracted
the attention of the throne. It was manifested by a
commission investing TegnÃ©r with the name, rank and
honor of professor.â

It was during this period that TegnÃ©râs literary reputation
neared its radiant meridian. Poems of various sort came
forth with strange rapidity,âas yet, however, none of much
extent. There were at this time two schools of poetry in
Sweden,âthe mystical, or âphosphoristic,â and the Gothic.
The former inclined toward foreign, especially German,
models, the latter maintained the sufficiency of national
models and subjects. TegnÃ©r, though an ardent disciple of the
Gothic school, disdained discussion, and maintained that
the best argument was example. Such example he was himself
destined soon to furnish. In 1820 appeared his âsacredly
sweet Whitsun Idyl,â âThe Children of the Lordâs
Supper,â which has been so well rendered into English by
Mr. Longfellow. Though clear and simple as the brooks
and sunshine this poem lacks the stir and vigor which it
was so easy for TegnÃ©r to impart. In the next year this
lack was supplied in the poem of âAxel,â and almost at the
same time by the publication of his âFrithiofâs Saga,âââthe
apples,â says Geijer [Yeiyer], âthrough which the
gods yet show their power to make immortal.â This is an
old Norse legend which TegnÃ©r has rewritten and modernized,
and at the same time charged full with the fervor of
his mighty soul. âIt would be superfluous to recount here
the applause with which this master poem of Northern
poetic genius was vociferously greeted by all the educated
world; how Goethe from his throne of poetical eminence
bowed his laurel-crowned gray locks in homage to it; how
[431]

all the languages of Europe, even the Russian, Polish and
modern Greek, hastened to appropriate to themselves greater
or less portions of the same; how in the poetâs own country
it soon became a living joy upon the lips of the people, a
treasure in the day-laborerâs cot as in the princeâs halls. Its
authorâs name has gone abroad together with that of LinnÃ¦us,
and wherever one goes one hears it mentioned with respect
and admiration.â

Of this âFrithiofâs Sagaâ our space forbids us to speak at
greater length. Mr. Longfellow has given an excellent analysis
of the poem (
North American Review
for July, 1837),
and it has been rendered into English, entirely or in part,
no less than nineteen times. We have but to record that
this example of the clear treatment of a Gothic or Northern
subject was the necessary and final argument against the
school of Phosphorists. From the day when the âFrithiofâ
appeared, we hear of no other model or standard of poetic
excellence in Sweden.

With the publication of these longer poems TegnÃ©râs
career as a poet virtually terminates. He never estimated
his gifts at their real value, and gave to the practice of his
art only leisure moments. To the end of his life the success
of his âFrithiofâ was a standing surprise to him. His chief
fondness was for Greek,âthe department in which twelve
years before he had been made a university professor. But
his life henceforth was to be little with his beloved Greek
authors, little with his muse. Not long after graduation he
had been ordained and placed for a time in charge of two
parishes in the neighborhood of Lund. Now, in January,
1824, came the intelligence that he had been elected to the
vacant bishopric of WexiÃ¶. The spirit which breathed from
his âNattvardsbarnenâ (Children of the Lordâs Supper) had
won the hearts of the clergy, and this was their tribute of
love and confidence. He accepted with reluctance, removing
to the scene of his future labors in May of the same year.
He threw himself into his new duties with all energy. The
various interests of his diocese, particularly the schools, received
his unremitting care. In the fourteen years that follow
he became the acknowledged head of the Swedish
Church. In the National Diet he was also an active member.
But now we approach the end of this remarkable career.
There was a trace of insanity in the family, and TegnÃ©r
had long feared he might become a victim. In his poetic
facility he saw only a mental intensity emanating from that
source; and he was doubtless right. Overwork had also
aggravated the danger. Ere long he grew full of great and
impossible schemes. He wrote to Mr. Longfellow that he
was about to issue a new edition of his writings in a
hundred
volumes!
Finally, in 1838, he was sent to the insane hospital
at Schleswig. After a short stay he seemed to mend,
and returned to his labors, as all thought, restored. But his
vital energy was slowly waning. In 1845 he was obliged to
seek release from public duty, and in the year following was
stricken with paralysis. It was not the first attack of this
kind that had come upon him, but it was the last. âHis
head now possessed its old-time soundness; his voice had
recovered its usual clearness. Only the evening before his
death he was attacked by a slight delirium, which was betrayed
by his speaking often of Goethe as his countryman.
Resigned and peaceful he neared his end. Water and light
were still his refreshments. When the autumn sun one day
shone brightly into his sick chamber, he broke forth with
the words, âI lift up my hands to Godâs house and mountain,â
which he often afterward repeated. They were his
last Sun-song. To his absent children he sent his farewell
greeting; to his oldest son a ring with Lutherâs picture,
which he had worn on his hand for thirty years. Shortly
before midnight on the second of November, 1846,âthe most
beautiful aurora borealis lighted up the skyâthe spirit of
the skald gently broke its fetters. Scarcely a sigh betrayed
the separation to his kneeling wife, who read upon his face,
lit up at once by the moon and death, âblessed peace and
heavenly rapture.ââ

TegnÃ©râs successor in Swedish belles-lettres was RÃºneberg,
of whom we shall now give a brief sketch. TegnÃ©r
belongs to the romantic era of European literature, and, as
we know, it would be hard to find a more purely romantic
poet. Runeberg was destined to found in Sweden the modern
or realistic school. He was the son of a âmerchant-captain,â
and born in 1804 in Finland. He was sent to college,
became professor of Latin, and finally of Greek. He
caught in some way the spirit of the coming change, unlearned
the old methods in which he had begun to write,
and in 1832 published his âElk Hunters.â This was the
beginning of nature-writing in Sweden. It was followed by
the delicate idyl of âHanna,â the brilliant âChristmas
Eve,â and finally âNadeschdaâ and âKing Fjalar.â These
bear favorable comparison with anything in modern literature.
In his shorter pieces, and notably the âEnsign Stalâs
Stories,â Runeberg has earned perhaps greater fame. His
death occurred in 1877. The school he founded is continued
by the living pens of WirsÃ©n, Carl Snoilsky, and Viktor
Rydberg.

We will translate, to close our sketch, a random morsel of
Runeberg, not as an example of his genius and skill, but
rather of his simplicity and love of nature. The meter is
already familiar to us in âHiawatha,â and was borrowed by
both Runeberg and Longfellow from the national epic of
Finland, the âKalevÃ¡la.â

Poor I hear they call thy mother,

Poor, my gentle child, they call thee.

Art
thou poor, thou little maiden,

Art thou poor as people think thee?

Out before thy motherâs cottage

Blossom meadows, flourish forests;

Every mead has brooks of silver,

Every wood its broad lake-mirror,

Over all the sun is smiling,

Pouring forth its golden glory.

Art thou poor, thou little maiden,

Art thou poor as people think thee?

When thou hearâst thy mother singing,

Softly close thy tender eyelids,â

Lids which hide thy soulâs pearl-treasures;

Straight thereafter cometh slumber,

Slumber followed by dreamâs angel,

Soft and still dreamâs angel takes thee,

Lifts thee on his wings so gently,

Bears thee forth among the meadows,

There to bloom among the flowers,

Bears thee to the birds and forests,

There to fill thy breast with singing,â

Leaves thy soul in purest waters,

Bathes thee in the joyous sunshine.

Art
thou poor, thou little maiden,

Art thou poor as people think thee?

When again thy eyelids open,

Thou art on thy motherâs bosom,

Feelest in thy tender senses,

Thinkest in thy darksome thinking:

Sweet it was upon the meadows,

Blithe it was with birds and woodlands,

Good beside the lakeâs clear waters,

Warm that bathing in the sunlight,â

Yet best is it on this bosom.

PICTURES FROM ENGLISH HISTORY.

By C. E. BISHOP.

VIII.âTHE LAST GREAT INVADER OF FRANCE.

You remember Franklinâs story of the speckled axe; how
he turned the grindstone to polish it up nice, and, tiring of
the revolutions, concluded he âliked a speckled axe best.â
There was a king of England who had a very speckled character
and the people of England (who turned the grindstone
for him) long liked their kingâs speckled character best of
all the kings that they had known.

When Prince of Wales he âcut upâ so that he got the
name of âMadcap Harry,â some of the most amusing of his
pranks being highway robbery and burglary, for all which
he was admired in his day and immortalized, along with
Jack Falstaff, by Shakspere. One of the light spots on this
character is his obedience to the commitment by Chief Justice
Gascoigne; and although it belongs to the realm of
tradition, it is so pleasant to believe and is so quaintly told
by Lord Campbell that weâll eâen accept it: One of the
Princeâs gang of cut purses had been captured and imprisoned
by Gascoigne, and the Prince came into court and demanded
his release, which was denied. The Prince, says
the chronicle, âbeing set all in a fury, all chafed and in a
terrible maner, came up to the place of jugement, men
thinking that he would have slain the juge, or have done to
him some damage; but the juge sitting still without
moving, declaring the majestie of the kingâs place of
jugement, and with an assured and bolde countenance, had
to the Prince these words following: âSir, remember yourself.
I kepe here the place of the kinge, your soveraine
lorde and father, to whom ye owe double obedience: wherefore
eftsoones in his name I charge you desiste of your wilfulness
and unlawfull enterprise, and from hensforth give
good example to those whiche hereafter shall be your propre
subjectes. And nowe, for your contempte and disobedience,
go you to the prison of the Kingeâs Benche, whereunto I
committe you, and remain ye there prisoner untill the
pleasure of the kinge, your father, be further knowen.ââ

The princeâs better nature, and a sense of his familyâs precarious
situation before the law perhaps, induced him to
accept the sentence and go to jail. On hearing this the
king is recorded as saying: âO merciful God, how much
am I bound to your infinite goodness, especially for that you
have given me a juge who feareth not to minister justice,
and also a sonne, who can suffre semblably and obeye justice.â

In keeping with this wonderful âspasm of good behaviorâ
is the sudden change that came over the Madcap as
soon as he became King Henry V. He became as remarkable
for his austere piety as he had been for his wickedness.
Unfortunately, his piety took the shape of burning Lollards
(the shouting Methodists of that day), and he signed the
warrant under which the brave and innocent Sir John Oldcastle,
his old friend and boon companion, was hung up in
chains over a slow fire.

There could be but two outlets in those days for such a degree
of piety as Henry had achieved: as whatever he undertook
must be bloody and cruel, the choice lay between a crusade
or an invasion of France. As the latter promised the
most booty and least risk he seemed to have a call in that
direction. The attempt seemed about equal to an able bodied
man attacking a paralytic patient in bed. The king of
France was insane: his heir was worthless and lazy; the
queen regent was an unfaithful wife and an unnatural
mother, who took sides with the faction that was trying to
dethrone the king and destroy his and her son. The kingdom
was torn to pieces by civil strife between the Orleanists
and the Burgundians, each vying with the other in cruelty,
treachery, violence and plundering the government and
outraging the people. There was an awful state of affairsâjust
the chance for a valiant English king.

Henry put up a demand for the French crown, under the
pseudo claim of Edward III., whose house his father had
deposed. A usurper claiming a neighborâs crown by virtue
of the usurped title of an overturned and disinherited dynasty;
as if one stealing a crown got all the reversions of
that crown by right. Henry would have made a good claim
agent in our day! And the English people, with the remembrance
of Cressy and Poictiers, of the Black Prince,
and the captive King of France, and all the booty and cheap
glory that made England so rich and vain sixty years before,
fell in with Henryâs amiable designs on France. It
was perfectly clear to the whole nation, from the chief justice
down to the clodhopper, that Henryâs claim to the
crown of France was a clear and indefeasible one; that the
war would be for a high and holy rightâand could not fail
to pay.

And this was the main object of Henry after all: to divert
the kingdomâs attention from his own usurped title by
a foreign war; to fortify usurpation at home by attempted
usurpation abroad. His father had enjoined upon him this
policy, in Shakspereâs wordsâ

âBe it thy course to busy giddy minds

With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,

May waste the memory of the former days.

How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;

And grant it may with thee in true peace live.â

So in July, 1415, Henry and 30,000 more patriots, sailed
across the channel on 1,500 ships and landed unopposed at
the mouth of the Seine. It took them six weeks and cost
half the army to reduce the Castle of Harfleur, surrounded
by a swamp, and then his generals advised him to abandon
the campaign. But he dare not go back to his insecure
throne with failure written on his very first attempt at
glory; the expedition had cost too much money and he
must have something to show for it. So boldly enough he
struck for the heart of France.

This whole campaign was a close copy after the invasion
by Edward III. in 1346. There was the same unopposed
march to the walls of Paris, almost over the same ground;
the retreat before a tardy French host; the lucky crossing
of the river Somme, over the identical Blanchetacque Ford,
and the bringing to bay of the English by many times their
own number of French, were all faithfully repeated; while
the battle of Agincourt took place only a short distance
from the field of Cressy, and in its main features was a
repetition of that engagement. But in one respect, honorable
to him, Henry did
not
copy after Edward and the Black
Prince. He forbade all plundering and destruction; a soldier
who stole the pix from a church at Corby was instantly
executed.

The description of the scenes before the battle, when,

âProud of their number and secure in soul,

The confident and over-lusty French

Do the low-rated English play at dice;â

the contrary despondency of the English, the lofty, heroic
tone of Henry with his men, when he declared gaily he was
glad there were no more of them to share the honor of whipping
ten to one of the French; and his proclamation that
any man who had no stomach for this fight might depart;
we âcould not die in that manâs company that fears his fellowship
to die with us.â But his humble prostration in the
solitude of his own tent when he prayed piteously,â
[433]

âO, God of battles! steel my soldiersâ hearts;

Possess them not with fear; take from them now

The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers

Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,

O, not to-day, think not upon the fault

My father made in compassing the crown!â

All this makes up one of Shakspereâs most moving scenes.
The action and the result of this battle are as inexplicable
as those of Cressy and Poictiers. We know that now, as
then, the sturdy English archers did their fearful execution
on the massed French. France had learned nothing in
seventy years of defeats and adversity; she had no infantry,
entrusted no peasantry with arms: still depended on gentlemen
alone to defend Franceâand again the gentlemen
failed her. Sixty thousand were packed in a narrow passage
between two dense forests. On this mass the bowmen
fired their shafts until these were exhausted. Then throwing
away their bows, swinging their axes and long knives,
and planting firmly in the earth in front of them their steel-pointed
pikes, they waited the charge of the French chivalry.
The mud was girth-deep. The horses stumbled under
their heavily-armored riders. Such as reached the English
line struck the horrid pikes and were hewn down by
the stalwart axmen. They break and retreat, carrying dismay
and confusion to the main body. The pikes are pulled
up, and the line advanced. A charge of English knights is
hurled upon the broken mass of French, and their return is
covered by the axmen, who advance and form another line
of pikes to meet the countercharge of French. So it goes
on, until the French host is a mob, and the English are
everywhere among them, hewing, stabbing, and thrusting.
âSo great grew the mass of the slain,â said an eye-witness,
âand of those who were overthrown among them, that our
people ascended the very heaps, which had increased higher
than a man, and butchered their adversaries below with
swords and other weapons.â It all lasted three hours before
the French could be called defeated, for they were so
numerous and were packed so closely that even retreat was
long impossible. Before the battle had been decided, every
Englishman had four or five prisoners on his hands, whom
he was holding for ransoms. This was the grand chance to
recoup all their losses and sufferings and grievous denial of
plunder. This was a predicament for a victorious army,
and if a small force of the French had made a rally they
might then have reversed their defeat on the scattered
English. Henry tried to avert such a catastrophe by sounding
the order for every man to put all his prisoners to death:
but cupidity saved many, nevertheless.

The flower of the chivalry of France perished on this field,
greatly to the relief and benefit of France. Seven of the
princes of the blood royal, the heads of one hundred and
twenty of the noble families of France, and eight thousand
gentlemen were counted among the 30,000 slain. The feudal
nobility never recovered from the blow,âbut France did,
all the sooner for lack of them.

The victorious army made its way to Calais, and Henry
returned to England, âcovered with glory and loaded with
debt.â But there was unlimited exultation when Henry
came marching home, into London, under fifteen grand triumphal
arches, insomuch that an eye-witness says, âA
greater assembly or a nobler spectacle was not recollected
to have been ever before in London.â

Campaign after campaign into France followed; she being
plunged deeper and deeper into civil war, anarchy, and
mob-rule. Rouen fell in 1419, and the two kings arranged
a peace and a marriage between Henry and the princess
Catherine. (The courtship in Shakspere is racy.) In 1420
the two kings, side by side, made a triumphant entry into
Paris, and Henry was acknowledged as successor to the
French crown after Charles VI. should die. Another great
demonstration was seen in London when the French Catherine
was crowned Queen of England (1421). Ah! there was
a fearful Nemesis awaiting this newly-married pair in the
insanity of their son, inherited from Catherineâs father.
And England was to pay dearly for her French glory in the
miseries of the reign of Henry VI. and the dreadful Wars
of the Roses. Indeed, she was already paying dearly in the
load of taxation and the loss of life those wars had entailed,
insomuch that even now there was a scarcity of âworthy
and sufficient personsâ to manage government affairs in the
boroughs and parishes.

The English army in France met with a sudden reverse,
the commandant, the Duke of Clarence, being slain. More
troops had to be raised and taken to France, and in the effort
to keep his grasp on the prostrate kingdom, Henry himself
was prostrated in the grasp of an enemy he could not
resist. So, on the 31st of August, 1422, in the midst of his
campaign, Henry died.

The priests came to his bedside and recited the penitential
psalm: when they came to âThou shalt build up the
walls of Jerusalem,â the dying man said: âAh, if I had
finished this war I would have gone to Palestine to restore
the Holy City.â He was the last of the crusade dreamers,
and the last of the great invaders of France among English
kings. In a few years all that he had won, and all that the
greatest English generals and the prowess of her archers
could avail were scattered by a mere girl creating and leading
to victory new French armies.

And this bauble of war was all there was of Henry Fifthâs
reign, the pride of the House of Lancaster. So we can
hardly join in the lamentation of the Duke of Bedford:

âHung be the heavens with black, yield day to night,

Comets, importing change of time and states,

Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,

And with them scourge the bad revolting stars

That have consented unto Henryâs death!

King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!

England neâer lost a king of so much worth.â

The historian, White, pretty well sums up this âspeckled
character:â

âHis personal ambition had been hurtful to his people.
In the first glare of his achievements, some parts of his
character were obscured which calm reflection has pointed
out for the reprobation of succeeding times. He was harsh
and cruel beyond even the limits of the harsh and cruel
code under which he professed to act. He bought over the
church by giving up innovators to its vengeance; he compelled
his prisoner, James I. of Scotland, to accompany
him in his last expedition to France to avenge a great defeat
his arms sustained at BeaugÃ© at the hands of the
Scotch auxiliaries, and availed himself of this royal sanction
to execute as traitors all the Scottish prisoners who fell
into his hands. His massacre of the French captives has
already been related, and we shall see how injuriously the
temporary glory of so atrocious a career acted on the moral
feelings of his people when it blunted their perception of
those great and manifest crimes and inspired the nobles
with a spirit of war and conquest which cost innumerable
lives and retarded the progress of the country in wealth and
freedom for many years.â

PHYSIOLOGY.
[E]

Our last article gave us a complete description of the human
organization. In the present number we will inquire
how we move this complex system of bones, nerves, flesh,
and tissues.

We will take a particular motion and see if we can understand
that. For instance, you bend your arm. You know
that when your arm is lying on the table you can bend the
forearm on the upper arm (or part above the elbow) until
your fingers touch your shoulder. How is this done?

Look at the arm in a skeleton; you will see that the upper
part is composed of one large bone, called the humerus, the
fore part of two bones, the radius and ulna. If you look
carefully you will see that the end of the humerus, at the
elbow, is curiously rounded, and the end of the ulna, at the
elbow, is scooped out in such a way that one fits loosely
into the other. If you try to move them about, one on the
other, you will find that you can easily double the ulna very
closely on the humerus, without their ends coming apart;
and as you move the ulna you will notice that its end and
the end of the humerus slide over each other. But they
will slide only one wayâup and down. If you try to slide
them from side to side they get locked. At the elbows, then,
we have two bones fitting into each other, so that they will
move in a certain direction; their ends are smoothed with
cartilage, kept moist with a fluid and held in place by ligaments,
and this is all called a joint.

In order that this arm may be bent some force must be
used. The radius and ulna (the two move together) must
be pushed or pulled toward the humerus, or the humerus
toward the radius and ulna. How is this done in your arm?
Imagine that a piece of string were fastened to either the
radius or ulna, near the top: let the string be carried
through a little groove, which there is at the upper end of
the humerus, and fastened to the shoulder-blade. Let the
string be just long enough to allow the arm to be straightened
out, so that when the arm is straight the string will be
just about tight. Now draw your string up into a loop and
you will bend the fore-arm on the humerus. If this string
could be so made that every time you willed it so, it would
shorten itself, it would pull the ulna up and would bend the
arm; every time it slackened the arm would fall back into
a straight position.

In the living body there is not a string, but a band of tissues
placed very much as our string is placed, and which has
the power of shortening itself when required. Every time
it shortens the arm is bent, every time it lengthens again
the arm falls back into its straight position. This body,
which can thus lengthen and shorten itself, is called a muscle.
If you put your hand on the front of your upper arm,
half way between your shoulder and elbow, and then bend
your arm, you will feel something rising up under your
hand: this is the muscle shortening or, as we shall now call
it, contracting.

But what makes the muscle contract? You willed to
move your arm, and moved it by making the muscle contract;
but how did your will accomplish this? If you should
examine, you would find running through the muscle soft
white threads, or cords, which you have already learned to
recognize as nerves. These nerves seem to grow into and
be lost in the muscle. If you trace them in the other direction
you would find that they soon join with other similar
nerves, and the several cords joining together form stouter
nerve-cords. These again join others, and so we should
proceed until we came to quite stout white nerve-trunks,
as they are called, which pass between the vertebrÃ¦ of the
neck into the vertebral column, where they mix in the
mass of the spinal cord. What have these nerves to do
with the bending of the arm? Simply this: If you should
cut through the delicate nerves entering the muscle, what
would happen? You would find that you had lost all power
of bending your arm. However much you willed it, the
muscle would not contract. What does this show? It proves
that when you will to move, something passes along the
nerves to the muscle, which something causes the muscle
to contract. The nerve, then, is a bridge between your will
and the muscleâso that when the bridge is broken the will
can not get to the muscle.

If, anywhere between the muscle and the spinal cord, you
cut the nerve, you destroy communication between the will
and the muscle. If you injure the spinal cord in your
neck you might live, but you would be paralyzed; you
might will to bend your arm, but could not.

In short, the whole process is this: by the exercise of
your will a something is started in your brain. That something
passes from the brain to the spinal cord, leaves the
spinal cord and travels along certain nerves, picking its way
along the bundles of nervous threads which run from the
upper part of the spinal cord, until it reaches the muscle.
The muscle immediately contracts and grows thick. The
tendon pulls at the radius, the radius with the ulna moves
on the fulcrum of the humerus at the elbow-joint, and the
arm is bent.

Why does the muscle contract when that something
reaches it? We must be content to say that it is the property
of the muscle. But it does not always possess this property.
Suppose you were to tie a cord very tightly around the top
of the arm close to the shoulder. If you tied it tight enough
the arm would become pale, and would very soon begin to
grow cold. It would get numb, and would seem to be
heavy and clumsy. Your feeling in it would be blunted,
and soon altogether lost. You would find great difficulty in
bending it, and soon it would lose all power. If you untied
the cord, little by little the cold and clumsiness would pass
away, the power and warmth would come back, and you
would be able to bend it as you did before. What did the
cord do to the arm? The chief thing was to press on the
blood-vessels, and so stop the blood from moving in them.
We have seen that all parts of the body are supplied with
blood-vessels, veins and arteries. In the arm there is a very
large artery, branches from which go into all parts of the
muscle. If, instead of tying the cord about the arm, these
branches alone were tied, the arm, as a whole, would not
grow cold or limp, but if you tried to bend it, you would find
it impossible. All this teaches that the power which a
muscle has of contracting may be lost and regained as the
blood is stopped in its circulation, or allowed to circulate
freely.

Our next question is, What is there in the blood that thus
gives to the muscle the power of contracting, or that keeps
the muscle alive? The answer is easy. What is the name
given to this power of a muscle to contract? We call it

strength
. Straighten out your arm upon the table and put
a heavy weight in your hand; then bend your arm. Find
the heaviest weight that you can raise in this way, and try
it some morning after your breakfast, when you are in good
condition. Go without dinner, and in the evening when
tired and hungry, try to raise the same weight in the same
way. You will not be able to do so. Your muscle is weaker
than it was in the morning, and you say that the want of
food makes you weak; and that is so, because the food becomes
blood. The things which we eat are changed into
other things which form part of the blood, and this blood
going to the muscle gives it strength. What is true of the
relations of the blood to the muscles is true of all other parts
of the body. The brain and nerves and spinal cord have a
more pressing need of pure blood. The faintness which we
[435]

feel from want of food is quite as much weakness of the
brain and of the nerves as of the muscles, perhaps even
more so.

The whole history of our daily life is, briefly told, this:
The food we eat becomes blood; the blood is carried all over
the body, round and round, in the torrent of the circulation;
as it sweeps past them or through them, the brain, nerves,
muscles and skin pick out new food for their work, and give
back the things they have used or no longer want; as they
all have different work, some pick up what others have
thrown away. There are also scavengers and cleansers to
take up things which are wanted no longer, and to throw
them out of the body.

Thus the blood is kept pure as well as fresh. Thus it is
through the blood brought to them, that each part does its
work.

But what is blood? It is a fluid. It runs about like
water, but while water is transparent, blood is opaque. Under
a microscope you will see a number of little round bodiesâthe
blood-discs, or blood-corpuscles. All the redness
there is in blood belongs to these. These red corpuscles are
not hard, solid things, but delicate and soft, yet made to
bear all the squeezing they get as they drive around the
body. Besides these red corpuscles, are other little bodies,
just a little larger than the red, not colored at all, and quite
round. These are all that one can see in blood, but it has a
strange property which we will study. Whenever blood is
shed from a living body, within a short time it becomes
solid. This change is called coagulation. If a dish be filled
with blood, and you were to take a bunch of twigs and keep
slowly stirring, you would naturally think it would soon begin
to coagulate; but it does not, and if you keep on stirring
you find that this never takes place. Take out your bundle
of twigs, and you will find it coated all over with a thick,
fleshy mass of soft substance. If you rinse this with water
you will soon have left nothing but a quantity of soft,
stringy material matted among the twigs. This stringy
material is, in reality, made up of fine, delicate, elastic
threads, and is called fibrin; by stirring you have taken it
out. If the blood had been left in the dish for a few hours, or a
day, you would find a firm mould of coagulated blood floating
in a colorless liquid. This jelly would continue shrinking,
and the fluid would remain; this fluid is called serum,
and it is the blood out of which the corpuscles have been
strained by the coagulation. All these various things, fibrin,
serum, corpuscles, etc., make up the blood. This blood
must move, and how does it move? You have had the different
organs which assist in its circulation described, but
let us illustrate.

All over the body there are, though you can not see them,
networks of capillaries. All the arteries end in capillaries,
and in them begin all veins. Supposing a little blood-corpuscle
be squeezed in the narrow pathway of a capillary in
the muscle of the arm. Let it start in motion backward.
Going along the narrow capillary it would hardly have
room to move. It will pass on the right and left other
capillary channels, as small as the one in which it moves;
advancing, it will soon find the passage widening and the
walls growing thicker. This continues until the corpuscle is
almost lost in the great artery of the arm; thence it will pass
but few openings, and these will be large, until it passes
into the aorta, or great artery, and then into the heart. Suppose
the corpuscle retrace its journey and go ahead instead
of backward. It will go through passages similar to the
other, and it would learn these passages to be veins. At
last the corpuscle would float into the vena cava, thence to
the right auricle, from there to the right ventricle, by the pulmonary
artery to the lungs; there it, with its attendant
white corpuscles, serum and other substances, would be
purified, then sent by pulmonary vein to the left auricle and
ventricle, and then pumped over the body again. Some one
may ask, What is the force that drives or pumps the blood?
Suppose you had a long, thin muscle fastened at one end to
something firm, and a weight attached to it. Every time
the muscle contracted it would pull on the weight and draw
it up. But instead of hanging a weight to the muscle, wrap
it around a bladder of water. If the muscle contract now,
evidently the water will be squeezed through any opening
in the bladder. This is just what takes place in the heart.
Each cavity there, each auricle and ventricle is, so to speak,
a thin bag with a number of muscles wrapped about it. In
an ordinary muscle of the body the fibers are placed regularly
side by side, but in the heart, the bundles are interlaced
in a very wonderful fashion, so that it is difficult to
make out the grain. They are so arranged that the muscular
fibers may squeeze all parts of each bag at the same
time. But here is the most wonderful fact of all. These
muscles of the auricles and ventricles are always at work
contracting and relaxing of their own accord as long as the
heart is alive. The muscle of your arm contracts only at
your will. But the heart is never quiet. Awake or asleep,
whatever you are doing or not doing, it keeps steadily on.

Each time the heart contracts what happens? Let us begin
with the right ventricle full of blood. It contracts; the
pressure comes on all sides, and were it not for the flaps
that close and shut the way, some of the blood would be
forced back into the right auricle. As it is, there is but one
way,âthrough the pulmonary artery. This is already full
of blood, but, because of its wonderful elasticity, it stretches
so that it holds the extra fluid. The valve at its mouth closes,
and the blood is safely shut in, but the artery so stretched
contracts and forces the blood along into the veins and capillaries
of the lungs, in turn stretching them so that they
must force ahead the blood which they already contain.
This blood is forced into the pulmonary vein, thence to the
left auricle; the auricle forces it into the ventricle, and the
latter pumps it into the aorta; the aorta overflows as the
pulmonary artery did, and the blood goes through every
capillary of the body into the great venÃ¦ cavÃ¦, which forces
it into the right auricle; thence to the ventricle where we
started. In this passage every fragment of the body has
been bathed in blood. This stream rushing through the
capillaries contains the material from which bone, muscle,
and brain are made, and carries away all the waste material
which must be thrown off.

The actual work of making bone or muscle is performed
outside of the blood in the tissues. You say, the capillaries
are closed, and how can the blood get to the tissues? It
will be necessary here to speak of a certain property of membranes
in order that you understand how the tissues are built
up by the blood apparently closed within the veins. If a solution
of sugar or salt be placed in a bladder with the neck tied
tightly, and this placed in a basin of pure water, you will find
that the water in the basin will soon taste of sugar or salt
and after a time will taste as strong as the water in the bladder.
If you substitute solid particles, or things that will
not dissolve, you will find no change. This property which
membranes, such as a bladder, have, is called osmosis. It
is by osmosis chiefly that the raw, nourishing material in
the blood gets into the flesh lying about the capillaries. It
is by osmosis chiefly that food gets out of the stomach into
the blood. It is by this property that the worn-out materials
are drained away from the blood, and so cast out of the
body. By osmosis the blood nourishes and purifies the flesh.
By osmosis the blood is itself nourished and kept pure.

We must now understand how we live on this food we
eat. Food passing into the alimentary canal is there digested.
The nourishing food-stuffs are dissolved out of the
innutritious and pass into the blood. The blood thus kept
supplied with combustible materials, draws oxygen from
[436]

the lungs, and thus carries to every part of the body stuff to
burn and oxygen to burn it with. Everywhere this oxidation
is going on, changing the arterial blood to venous.

From most places where there is oxidation, the venous
blood comes away hotter than the arterial, and all the hot
venous blood mingling, keeps the whole body warm. Much
heat is given up, however, to whatever is touching the skin,
and much is used in turning liquid perspiration into vapor.
Thus, as long as we are in health, we never get hotter than
a certain degree.

Everywhere this oxidation is going on. Little by little,
every part of the body is continually burning away and
continually being made anew by the blood. Though it is
the same blood, it makes very different things: in the nerves
it makes nerve; in the muscle, muscle. It gives different
qualities to different parts: out of one gland it makes saliva,
another gastric juice; out of it the bone gets strength and
the muscle power to contract. But the far greater part of
the power of the blood is spent in heat, or goes to keep us
warm.

One thing more we have to note before we answer the
question, why we move. We have seen that we move by
reason of our muscles contracting, and that, in a general
way, a muscle contracts because a something started in our
brain by our will, passes through the spinal cord, through
certain nerves, until it reaches the muscle, and this something
we may call a nervous impulse. But what starts this?

All the nerves do not end in the muscles, but many in the
skin. These nerves can not be used to carry nervous impulses
from the brain to the skin. By no effort of yours can
you make the skin contract. For what purpose then are
these nerves? If you prick your finger, you feel the touch,
or say that you have sensation in your finger. If you were
to cut the nerve leading to the finger you would lose this
power of feeling. These nerves, then, ending in the fingers
have a different use from those ending in the muscles. The
latter carry an impulse from the brain to the muscles, and
are called motor nerves. The former carry impulses from
the skin to the brain, and are called sensory nerves, or those
which bring about sensations. Motor nerves are of but one
kind, but there are several kinds of sensory nerves, each
kind having a special work to do. The several works which
these nerves do are called the senses. By means of these
sensory nerves we receive impressions from the external
world, sensations of heat, cold, roughness, good and bad
odors, taste, sound, and the color and form of things. Thus
impressions of the external world are made upon the brain,
and it is these impressions that stimulate the brain to action.
The brain worked on by them, through ways that we
know not of, governs the muscles, sends commands by the
motor nerves, and rules the body as a conscious, intelligent
will.

TO THE NIGHTINGALE.

By DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN.

Sweet bird, that singâst away the early hours,

Of winters past or coming void of care,

Well pleased with delights which present are,

Fair seasons, budding sprays, sweet-smelling flowers;

To rocks, to springs, to rills, from leafy bowers

Thou thy Creatorâs goodness dost declare,

And what dear gifts on thee he did not spare,

A stain to human sense in sin that lowers.

What soul can be so sick which by thy songs,

Attirâd in sweetness, sweetly is not driven

Quite to forget earthâs turmoils, spites, and wrongs,

And lift a reverent eye and thought to heaven?

Sweet artless songster, thou my mind dost raise

To airs of spheres, yes, and to angelsâ lays.

FILTHY LUCRE.
[F]

By
Rev.
WILLIAM ARNOT.

These âways,â as described by Solomon in the preceding
verses, are certainly some of the very worst. We have here
literally the picture of a robberâs den. The persons described
are of the baser sort: the crimes enumerated are gross and
rank: they would be outrageously disreputable in any society,
of any age. Yet when these apples of Sodom are
traced to their sustaining root, it turns out to be
greed of
gain
. The love of money can bear all these.

This scripture is not out of date in our day, or out of place
in our community. The word of God is not left behind obsolete
by the progress of events. âAll flesh is as grass, and
all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth,
and the flower thereof falleth away; but the word of
the Lord endureth for everâ (1 Peter, i: 24, 25). The Scripture
traces sin to its fountain, and deposits the sentence of
condemnation there,âa sentence that follows actual evil
through all its diverging paths. A spring of poisonous
water may in one part of its course run over a rough, rocky
bed, and in another glide silent and smooth through a verdant
meadow; but, alike when chafed into foam by obstructing
rocks, and when reflecting the flowers from its glassy
breast, it is the same lethal stream. So from greed of gainâfrom
covetousness which is idolatry, the issue is evil,
whether it run riot in murder and rapine in Solomonâs days,
or crawl sleek and slimy through cunning tricks of trade in
our own. God seeth not as man seeth. He judges by the
character of the life stream that flows from the fountain of
thought, and not by the form of the channel which accident
may have hollowed out to receive it.

When this greed of gain is generated, like a thirst in the
soul, it imperiously demands satisfaction: and it takes satisfaction
wherever it can be most readily found. In some
countries of the world still it retains the old-fashioned form
of iniquity which Solomon has described: it turns free-booter,
and leagues with a band of kindred spirits, for the
prosecution of the business on a larger scale. In our country,
though the same passion domineer in a manâs heart, it
will not adopt the same method, because it has cunning
enough to know that by this method it could not succeed.
Dishonesty is diluted, and colored, and moulded into shapes
of respectability, to suit the taste of the times. We are not
hazarding an estimate whether there be as much of dishonesty
under all our privileges as prevailed in a darker day:
we affirm only that wherever dishonesty is, its nature remains
the same, although its form may be more refined.
He who will judge both mean men and merchant princes
requires truth in the inward parts. There is no respect of
persons with him. Fashions do not change about the
throne of the Eternal. With him a thousand years are as
one day. The ancient and modern evil-doers are reckoned
brethren in iniquity, despite the difference in the costume
of their crimes. Two men are alike greedy of gain. One
of them being expert in accounts, defrauds his creditors,
and thereafter drives his carriage; the other, being robust
of limb, robs a traveler on the highway, and then holds
midnight revel on the spoil. Found fellow-sinners, they
will be left fellow-sufferers. Refined dishonesty is as displeasing
to God, as hurtful to society, and as unfit for heaven,
as the coarsest crime.

This greed, when full grown, is coarse and cruel. It is not
[437]

restrained by any delicate sense of what is right or seemly.
It has no bowels. It marches right to its mark, treading on
everything that lies in the way. If necessary, in order to
clutch the coveted gain, âit takes away the life of the owners
thereof.â Covetousness is idolatry. The idol delights in
blood. He demands and gets a hecatomb of human sacrifices.

Among the laborers employed in a certain district to construct
a railway, was one thick-necked, bushy, sensual, ignorant,
brutalized man, who lodged in the cottage of a lone
old woman. This woman was in the habit of laying up her
weekly earnings in a certain chest, of which she carefully
kept the key. The lodger observed where the money lay.
After the works were completed and the workmen dispersed,
this man was seen in the gray dawn of a Sabbath
morning stealthily approaching the cottage. That day, for
a wonder among the neighbors, the dame did not appear at
church. They went to her house, and learned the cause.
Her dead body lay on the cottage floor: the treasure-chest
was robbed of its few pounds and odd shillings, and the
murderer had fled. Afterward they caught and hanged
him.

Shocking crime!âto murder a helpless woman in her
own house in order to reach and rifle her little hoard, laid
up against the winter and the rent! The criminal is of a
low, gross, bestial nature. Be it so. He was a pest to society,
and society flung the troubler off the earth. But what
of those who are far above him in education and social position,
and as far beyond him in the measure of their guilt?
How many human lives is the greed of gain even now taking
away in the various processes of slavery? Men who
hold a high place, and bear a good name in the world, have
in this form taken away the life of thousands for filthy
lucreâs sake. Murder on a large scale has been and is done
upon the African tribes by civilized men for money.

The opium traffic, forced upon China by the military
power of Britain, and maintained by her merchants in India,
is murder done for money on a mighty scale. Opium
spreads immorality, imbecility, and death through the
teeming ranks of the Chinese populations. The quantity
of opium cultivated on their own soil is comparatively
small. The government prohibited the introduction of the
deadly drug until England compelled them to legalize the
traffic. British merchants brought it to their shores in ship-loads
notwithstanding, and the thunder of British cannon
opened a way for its entrance through the feeble ranks that
lined the shore. Every law of political economy, and every
sentiment of Christian charity, cries aloud against nurturing
on our soil, and letting loose among our neighbors, that
grim angel of death. The greed of gain alone suggests,
commands, compels it. How can we expect the Chinese to
accept the Bible from us while we bring opium to them in
return? British Christians might bear to China that life
for which the Chinese seem to be thirsting, were it not that
British merchants are bearing to China that death which
the best of her people loathe.

A bloated, filthy, half-naked laborer, hanging on at the
harbor, has gotten a shilling for a stray job. As soon as he
has wiped his brow, and fingered the coin, he walks into a
shop and asks for whisky. The shopkeeper knows the manâknows
that his mind and body are damaged by strong
drinkâknows that his family are starved by the fatherâs
drunkenness. The shopkeeper eyes the squalid wretch.
The shilling tinkles on the counter. With one hand the
dealer supplies the glass, and with the other mechanically
rakes the shilling into the till among the rest. It is the
price of blood. Life is taken there for money. The gain is
filthy. Feeling its stain eating like rust into his conscience,
the man who takes it reasons eagerly with himself thus:
âHe was determined to have it; and if I wonât, another
will.â So he settles the case that occurred in the market-place
on earth, but he has not done with it yet. How will
that argument sound as an answer to the question, âWhere
is thy brother?â when it comes in thunder from the judgment-seat
of God?

Oh that menâs eyes were opened to know this sin beneath
all its coverings, and loathe it in all its disguises!
Other people may do the same, and we may never have
thought seriously of the matter; but these reasons, and a
thousand others, will not cover sin. All men should think
of the character and consequences of their actions. God
will weigh our deeds; we should ourselves weigh them beforehand
in his balances. It is not what that man has said,
or this man has done; but what Christ is, and his members
should be. The question for every man through life is, not
what is the practice of earth, but what is preparation for
heaven. There would not be much difficulty in judging
what gain is right and what is wrong if we would take
Christ into our counsels. If people look unto Jesus when
they think of being saved, and look hard away from him
when they are planning how to make money, they will
miss their mark for both worlds. When a man gives his
heart to gain, he is an idolater. Money has become his
god. He would rather that the Omniscient should not be
the witness of his worship. While he is sacrificing in this
idolâs temple, he would prefer that Christ should reside high
in heaven, out of sight and out of mind. He would like
Christ to be in heaven, ready to open its gates to him, when
death at last drives him off the earth; but he will not open
for Christ now that other dwelling-place which he lovesâa
humble and contrite heart. â
Christ in you
, the hope of
glory;â there is the cure of covetousness! That blessed Indweller,
when he enters, will drive outâwith a scourge, if
need beâsuch buyers and sellers as defiled his temple. His
still small voice within would flow forth, and print itself on
all your traffic,ââLove one another, as I have loved you.â

On this point the Christian Church is very low. The living
child has lain so close to the worldâs bosom that she has
overlaid it in the night, and stifled its troublesome cry.
After all our familiarity with the Catechism, we need yet
to learn âwhat is the
chief
end of man,â and what should
be compelled to stand aside as a secondary thing. We need
from all who fear the Lord, a long, loud testimony against
the practice of heartlessly subordinating human bodies and
souls to the accumulation of material wealth.

A CHRISTIAN DESCRIBED.
[G]

By the REV. W. JAY.

Who are they that principally occupy the pen of biographers,
and allure the attention of readers? Travelers,
painters, poets, scholars, writers, philosophers, statesmen,
princes. All these have their respective and comparative
claims, which we by no means wish to undervalue. But,
my brethren, we are going to bring forward this evening a
character often, indeed, like the original, âdespised and rejected
of men,â but superior to them all, and great where
they are nothing,âgreat in the sight of the Lord,âgreat in
the desolation of the universe, great in the annals of eternity:
a Christian.

1. Let us consider the
commonness of the appellation
. We
may take
three
views of the commonness of this name.

In one respect
the commonness is astonishing and should
be convincing
. We may say to an infidel, Pray how came
this name to be so common as it now is? The founder (we
now refer to his humanity; and the argument requires such
a reference)âthe founder was a poor man, a mechanic in a
village. âFoxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
[438]

nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head.â
He had received no university education; he was trained
up at the feet of no Gamaliel; the people therefore said,
âHow knoweth this man letters, never having learned?â
It was said of him, not only that âthe common people heard
him gladly,â but that âmany of the rulers believed on him.â
The chief ministers in his new empire were a company of
fishermen in the Lake of Galilee; and the kingdom itself
was established on the overthrow of every worldly opinion
and fashion. When we consider the nature of the doctrines
they preachedâthe difficulties they had to overcome, in the
profligacy of the multitude, in the subtlety of philosophers,
in the covetousness of priests, in the opposition and
edicts of magistrates and emperors,âand when we consider
their natural resourcelessness in themselves, what can be
more astonishing than that this name should be spread so
rapidly from province to province, and from country to
country, till before the termination of three centuries it had
reached the boundaries of the unwieldy Roman empire. It
has since far surpassed them, and is now advancing toward
the ends of the earth. . . . âHis name shall endure forever:
his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and
men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him
blessed. Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who
only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be his holy name
for ever and ever, and let the whole earth be filled with his
glory!â Amen and amen!

In another view,
this commonness is reasonable:
we wish
it were more common; we wish it prevailed exclusively
above every other; we wish no other ever obtained in the
world; we wish that the Church could, even
now
, fling off
the world; and we hope that this
will
be the case by and by,
when the pristine glory of Christianity shall revive, and the
earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the
waters cover the sea; and we shall see eye to eye. They
pay an idolatrous homage to any man who name themselves
religiously after him; as Calvinists, after Calvin; Arminians,
after Arminius; Baxterians, from Baxter. If I
must

have a human appellation, I will go back at once to the
apostolic times; I will call myself a Johnite, after John, or
a Paulite, after Paul. But, no; âwho is Paul, and who is
Apollos? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptised
in the name of Paul?â No; I will be called by no human
name, not even if it be an inspired one: my name shall not be
derived from the servant, but from the Master himself. I
will remember his command: âCall no man Master, on
earth; for one is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are
brethren.â

In another view,
the commonness of the name is lamentable
.
Let me explain: The word
Christian
was once very
significant and distinguishing. But, alas! in numberless
instances now, it is not distinguishable at all. Whom does
it now comprehend? All the world, with the exception of
pagans, Turks, Jews, and infidels: all others it takes in: it
is now a kind of geographical distinction, rather than religious.
France is a
Christian
countryâPortugal is a
Christian

countryâSpain is a
Christian
countryâItaly is a
Christian

countryâEngland is a
Christian
country; and
this
, after
all,
is
a Christian country, comparatively. But a Christian
country is not a country of Christians; and, therefore,
the term, even amongst us, includes numbers who are
swearers, drunkards, and Sabbath-breakers, revilers, and
multitudes who, though not distinguished by any grossness
of life, yet are entirely opposite to the spirit and commands
of Christianity in their principles and tendencies. Often,
therefore, now it means nothingâyea, it is
worse
than nothingâit
is even
injurious
by its indiscrimination. Men are
easily deluded in their own opinions; they easily imagine
that they
are
what they are
called;
and having
the name
,
they imagine that they have
the thing
, especially when there
is no one to dispute their title. Multitudes of these would
be offended if you were to withhold from them the name of
a Christian; and yet if you were to call them
saints
, or
the
sanctified
, they would be still more surprised and mortified:
and yet
the saint
and
the Christian
are the same person, according
to the language of the New Testament; and the
apostle assures us that âwithout holiness, no man shall see
the Lord.â

Let us consider,

2.
The real import of this titleâa Christian.

A Christian is
one who has a relation to Christ;
not a professed,
but a
real
relationânot a nominal, but a
vital
relationâyea,
a very peculiar and pre-eminent relation, arising
above every other you can mention; spiritual in its nature,
and never-ending in its duration; and deriving the possession
and continuance of every enjoyment from Christ.
Beware
of a Christianity without Christ:
it is a stream without
a fountainâa branch without a living rootâa body without
a soul. âBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy
and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him
dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily. And ye are
complete in him which is the head of all principality and
power.â

A Christian is
a lover of Christâs doctrine
. In all systems
there are some common principles; but my receiving what is

common
in the system of a master does not entitle me to
be named after him. My believing with a Socinian that
there is a God, and that there will be a resurrection from the
dead, does not render me a Socinian; but my believing what
is
peculiar
in his creedâthat Christ was a mere man, that
he was born in the ordinary way of generation, that he died
only as a witness of the truth, and not as a sacrifice for sin.
Deism has
some
principles in common with our Christianity:
now my believing these will not constitute me a Christian,
but my holding those
peculiar
to Christianity. These
are to be found only in the Scriptures;
there
a Christian
searches for them;
there
he kneels before the oracle of divine
truth;
there
he takes up these principles, and says, these,
however mysterious they may be to my reason, however
humiliating they may be to the pride of my heartâthese I
take up on the authority of him who has revealed them. I
sit with Mary at Jesusâ feet; I pray to be led by his spirit
into all truth, and to be able to say with John, âWe have an
unction from the holy one, and we know all things.â

A Christian is
a lover of Christâs person
. This attachment
is deserved and demanded, by all that he has done and suffered
for us. Paul describes the subjects of divine grace as
those âwho love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity:â and so
far was he from supposing that a man can be a Christian
without this love to Christ, that he says, âIf any man love
not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema maranatha.â
Jesus himself was the essence of humility, and yet he had
such a consciousness of his dignity, and of his claims to the
supremacy of the human heart, that he made no scruple to
say, âHe that loveth father or mother more than me is not
worthy of me; and he that forsaketh not all that he hath
and followeth me can not be my disciple.â

The Christian is
a copier of Christâs example
. Without this
in vain you contend for his truth, and talk of your regard to
him. âHe that saith he abideth in him ought himself also
so to walk, even as he walked.â In all things, indeed, he
has the preÃ«minence. But Christians are said to be predestinated

to be conformed to his image
, that he may be the first-born
among many brethren. They are described now as
âBeholding in a glass his glory,â and as being âChanged
into the same image from glory to glory, as by the spirit of
the Lord.â He indeed had the spirit
without
measure; but
the Christian possesses the
same
spirit; for âIf any man
have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.â We must,
[439]

therefore, if we are Christians, resemble him who went
about doing good,âwho said, âThe zeal of thine house hath
eaten me up,ââwho pleased not himself,âwho, âThough a
man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,â in the midst of
the church sang praises to God. We are no further Christians
than as we are like him, and have the same mind in us
which was also in him.

A Christian is
a dependent on Christâs mediation
. He rejoices
in Christ Jesus, and has no confidence in the flesh.
He says with the Church, âIn the Lord have I righteousness
and strength.â

âThe best obedience of my hands

Dares not appear before thy throne;

But Faith can answer thy demands

By pleading what my Lord has done.â

He therefore comes to God only by
him;
and he looks for
acceptance as to his person and service
in
him; and while
he makes mention of
his
righteousness only, he also goes
forth in his strength. He feels that without him he can do
nothingâthat he can not stand longer than he holds him;
that he can not walk further than he leads him; but then
he sees that there is an all-sufficiency in him, and he believes
that while without him he can do
nothing
, he equally
believes that through his strengthening him he can do
all

things. As he begins his course in this way, so he carries
it on; and, however advanced he may be in the divine life,
yet he acknowledges himself an unprofitable servant, and
âlooks for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal
life.â

The Christian is
an expectant of Christâs coming
. Jesus
said to his disciples, when he was withdrawing from them,
âIf I go away, I will come again and receive you unto myself,
that where I am, there ye may be also.â This spake
he; therefore they are described as now looking for him;
âto them that look for him will he appear without sin unto
salvation.â This produces a marvelous difference between
him and all other men. Others are now
at home
âthe Christian
is now
from
home. The Christian views his present
possessions and enjoyments, whatever they may be, as only
the accommodation of the passing time; he feels and acknowledges
himself to be a stranger and a pilgrim upon
earth; all his treasure is in heaven; therefore he can not be
happy, unless he be there too. âWhere the treasure is,
there will the heart be also.â And Jesus knew this disposition;
therefore he said, âFather, I will that they whom
thou hast given me be with me, that they may behold my
glory.â

This, in brief, is
a Christian
; a
learner of Christâs doctrineâa
lover of Christâs personâa copier of Christâs exampleâa
dependent on Christâs mediation; and an expectant
of Christâs coming
.

THE UNITY OF THE DIVINE BEING.
[H]

By
Rev.
JOHN WESLEY.

And as there is one God, so there is one religion, and one
happiness for all men. God never intended there should be
any more; and it is not possible there should. Indeed, in
another sense, as the apostle observes, âThere are gods
many, and lords many.â All the heathen nations had their
gods, and many whole shoals of them. And generally, the
more polished they were, the more gods they heaped up to
themselves; but to us, to all that are favored with the Christian
revelation, âThere is but one God;â who declares of
himself, âIs there any God, beside me? There is none; I
know not any.â

But who can search out this God to perfection? None of
the creatures that he has made. Only some of his attributes
he hath been pleased to reveal to us in his Word. Hence
we learn that God is an eternal being. âHis goings forth
are from everlasting,â and will continue to everlasting.
As he ever was, so he ever will be; as there was no beginning
of his existence, so there will be no end. This is universally
allowed to be contained in his very name, Jehovah;
which the Apostle John accordingly renders, âHe that was,
and that is, and that is to come.â Perhaps it would be as
proper to say, âHe is from everlasting to everlasting.â

Nearly allied to the eternity of God is his omnipresence.
As he exists through infinite duration, so he can not but
exist through infinite space; according to his own question,
equivalent to the strongest assertion; âDo not I fill heaven
and earth? saith the Lordâ (heaven and earth, in the Hebrew
idiom, implying the whole universe) which, therefore,
according to his own declaration, is filled with his
presence.

This one, eternal, omnipresent being is likewise all perfect.
He has from eternity to eternity, all the perfections
and infinitely more than it ever did, or ever can enter into
the heart of man to conceive; yea, infinitely more than the
angels in heaven can conceive: these perfections we usually
term the attributes of God.

And he is omnipotent, as well as omnipresent: there can
be no more bounds to his power than to his presence. He
âhath a mighty arm: strong is his hand, and high is his
right hand.â He doeth whatsoever pleaseth him, in the
heavens, the earth, the sea, and in all deep places. With
men, we know, many things are impossible; âbut not with
God: with him all things are possible.â Whensoever he
willeth, to do is present with him.

The omniscience of God is a clear and necessary consequence
of his omnipresence. If he is present in every part
of the universe, he can not but know whatever is, or is done
there: according to the word of St. James, âKnown unto
God are all his works,â and the works of every creature,
âfrom the beginningâ of the world; or rather, as the phrase
literally implies, âfrom eternity.â His eyes are not only
âover all the earth, beholding the evil and the good,â but
likewise over the whole creation; yea, and the paths of uncreated
night. Is there any difference between his knowledge
and his wisdom? If there be, is not his knowledge
the more general term, (at least according to our weak conceptions),
and his wisdom a particular branch of it? namely,
the knowing the end of everything that exists, and the
means of applying it to that end?

Holiness is another of the attributes of the Almighty,
All-wise God. He is infinitely distant from every touch of
evil. He âis light; and in him is no darkness at all.â He
is a God of unblemished justice and truth: but above all is
his mercy. This we may easily learn from that beautiful
passage in the thirty-third and thirty-fourth chapters of
Exodus: âAnd Moses said, I beseech thee, show me thy
glory. And the Lord descended in the cloud, and proclaimed
the name of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord God, merciful
and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness
and truth; keeping mercy for thousands, and forgiving iniquity,
and transgression, and sin.â

This God is a spirit; not having such a body, such parts,
or passions, as men have. It was the opinion both of the
ancient Jews and the ancient Christians, that he alone is a
pure spirit, totally separate from all matter: whereas, they
supposed all other spirits, even the highest angels, even
cherubim and seraphim, to dwell in material vehicles,
though of an exceeding light and subtile substance. At that
point of duration, which the infinite wisdom of God saw to
be most proper, for reasons which lie hid in the abyss of his
own understanding, not to be fathomed by any finite mind,
God âcalled into being all that is;â created the heavens and
[440]

the earth, together with all that they contain. âAll things
were created by him, and without him was not anything
made that was made.â He created man, in particular, after
his own image, to be âa picture of his own eternity.â When
he had raised man from the dust of the earth, he breathed
into him an immortal spirit. Hence he is peculiarly called,
âThe Father of our spirits;â yea, âThe Father of the spirits
of all flesh.â

âHe made all things,â as the wise man observes, âfor himself.â
âFor his glory they were created.â Not âas if he
needed anything,â seeing âHe giveth to all life, and breath,
and all things.â He made all things to be happy. He
made man to be happy in himself. He is the proper center
of spirits; for whom every created spirit was made. So
true is that well-known saying of the ancient fathers:
fecisti
nos ad te: et irrequietum est cor nostrum, donec requiescat
in te
. âThou hast made us for thyself; and our heart can
not rest till it resteth in thee.â

This observation gives us a clear answer to that question
in the Assemblyâs catechism: âFor what end did God create
man?â The answer is, âto glorify God and to enjoy him
forever.â This is undoubtedly true: but is it quite clear,
especially to men of ordinary capacities? Do the generality
of common people understand that expression,ââto glorify
God?â No; no more than they understand Greek. And it
is altogether above the capacity of children; to whom we
can scarce ever speak plain enough. Now is not this the
very principle that should be inculcated upon every human
creature,ââyou are made to be happy in God,â as soon as
ever reason dawns? Should not every parent, as soon as a
child begins to talk, or to run alone, say something of this
kind; âsee! what is that which shines so over your head?
that we call the sun. See, how bright it is! feel how it
warms you! it makes the grass to spring, and everything to
grow. But God made the sun. The sun could not shine,
nor warm, nor do any good without him.â In this plain
and familiar way a wise parent might, many times in a day,
say something of God; particularly insisting, âhe made
you; and he made you to be happy in him; and nothing
else can make you happy.â We cannot press this too soon.
If you say, ânay, but they can not understand you when
they are so young,â I answer, no, nor when they are fifty
years old, unless God opens their understanding. And can
he not do this at any age?

Indeed this should be pressed on every human creature,
young and old, the more earnestly and diligently, because
so exceedingly few, even of those that are called Christians,
seem to know anything about it. Many indeed think of being
happy with God in heaven; but the being happy in
God on earth never entered into their thoughts.

Let all that desire to please God, condescend to be taught
of God, and take care to walk in that path which God hath
himself appointed. Beware of taking half of this religion
for the whole, but take both parts of it together. And see
that you begin where God himself begins: âThou shalt have
no other God before me.â Is not this the first, our Lord
himself being the judge, as well as the great commandment?
First, therefore, see that ye love God! next, your
neighbor, every child of man. From this fountain let
every temper, every affection, every passion flow. So shall
that âmind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.â
Let all your thoughts, words, and actions, spring from this!
So shall you âinherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the beginning of the world.â

READINGS FROM THOMAS Ã KEMPIS.

OF BEARING WITH THE DEFECTS OF OTHERS.

Those things that a man can not amend in himself, or in
others, he ought to suffer patiently until God orders things
otherwise.

Think that perhaps it is better so for thy trial and patience.

2. If one that is once or twice warned will not give over,
contend not with him; but commit all to God, that his will
may be done, and his name honored in all his servants, who
well knoweth how to turn evil into good.

Study to be patient in bearing with the defects and infirmities
of others, of what sort soever they be: for that thou
thyself also hast many, which must be suffered by others.

If thou canst not make thyself such a one as thou wouldst,
how canst thou expect to have another in all things to thy
liking?

We would willingly have others perfect, and yet we
amend not our own faults.

We would have others exactly corrected, and will not be
corrected ourselves.

The liberty of others displeaseth us, and yet we will not
have our desires denied.

Thus it appears how seldom we weigh our neighbors in
the same balance with ourselves.

3. If all men were perfect, what should we have to suffer
of our neighbor for God?

But now God hath thus ordained it, that we may learn to
bear one anotherâs burdens; for no man is without fault; no
man but hath his burden; no man is self-sufficient; no man
has wisdom enough for himself; but we ought to bear with
one another, comfort, help, instruct, and admonish one another.

Occasions of adversity best discover how great virtue each
one hath:

For occasions make not a man frail, but show what he is

OF AVOIDING RASH JUDGMENT.

Turn thine eyes unto thyself, and beware thou judge not
the deeds of other men.

In judging others a man laboreth in vain, often erreth, and
easily sinneth; but in judging and examining himself, he
always laboreth fruitfully.

We often judge of things according as we fancy them:
for affection bereaves us easily of a right judgment.

If God were always our desire, we should not be so much
troubled when our inclinations are opposed.

2. But oftentimes something lurks within, which draweth
us after it.

Many secretly seek themselves in their actions, but know
it not.

They live in peace of mind when things are done according
to their will: but if things succeed otherwise than they
desire, they are straightway troubled.

Diversity of inclinations and opinions often causes dissensions
between religious persons, between friends and
countrymen.

3. An old custom is hardly broken, and no man is willing
to be led farther than himself can see.

If thou dost more rely upon thine own reason, than upon
Jesus Christ, late, if ever, shalt thou become illuminated.

OF WORKS DONE OUT OF CHARITY.

The outward work, without charity, profiteth nothing;
but whatsoever is done out of charity, be it ever so little
and contemptible in the sight of the world, is wholly fruitful.

For God weigheth more with how much love one worketh,
than how much he doeth.

He doth much that loveth much.

2. He doth much that doth a thing well.

He doth well that serveth his neighbor, and not his own
will.

Often it seemeth to be charity, and it is rather carnality;
because natural inclinations, self-will, hope of reward, and
desire of our own interest, are motives that men are rarely
free from.
[441]

3. He that hath true and perfect charity seeketh himself
in nothing, but only desireth in all things that God should
be exalted.

He envieth none, because he seeketh not his own satisfaction:
neither rejoiceth in himself, but chooses God only
for his portion.

He attributes nothing that is good to any man, but wholly
referreth it unto God, from whom, as from the fountain, all
things proceed: in whom finally all the saints rest.

O that he had but one spark of true charity, he would
certainly discern that all earthly things are full of vanity!

THE ROMANCE OF ASTRONOMYâASTROLOGY.

By R. K. MILLER.

A very interesting portion in the study of planetary astronomy
is the mysterious influence which these bodies
were supposed to have had on the affairs of men. Astrology
comprehended the other heavenly bodies as well as the
planets, but the simple regularity of their movements rendered
them far less interesting than the âwanderers.â The
seemingly arbitrary and irregular course of these bodies
caused them to be selected to represent the varying turns
of fortuneâs wheel. The father of the written science of astrology
was Ptolemy, who seems to have studied astronomy
for astrological purposes. According to him, the planet in
the ascendant at the time of birth was the chief ruler of the
character and fortune of the ânative,â as the person was
technically called. Mercury presided over the mental faculties
and literary and scientific pursuits; he caused a desire
of change. Venus was called the Lesser Fortune. She
produced a mild disposition, with an inclination to pleasure,
and brought good fortune to the native in his or her relations
to the other sex. Mars was the Lesser Infortune:
his influence was decidedly risky, and needed to be well
aspected by the other planets to lead to good. He, of course,
presided over war and over trades connected with iron and
steel. Jupiter was regarded as by far the most propitious of
the heavenly orbs. He ruled all high offices. The mortal born
under him would be high-minded, liberal, just and devout.
Happy the kingdom ruled by a sovereign on whose birth he
shone. English astrologers tell with pride that Queen Victoria
was born when Jupiter rode high in the heavens.
Next to him we have the grim and ill-omened Saturn, the
Greater Infortune. Those born under him are gloomy and
reservedâfaithful in friendship but bitter toward an enemy.
Failure, disease, disgrace and death beset the steps of the
child of Saturn. Uranus causes abruptness of manners and
general eccentricity, while astrologers have not made up
their minds about Neptune. The signs of the Zodiac were
supposed to have a good deal to do with personal appearance.
Thus Pisces produced a short person, with round face
and slow gait; Taurus, a well-set person, with broad face
and thick neck. Different parts of the human life were
allotted to different luminaries, as infancy to the Moon,
youth to Venus, and so on. Lastly the visible firmament
was divided into twelve equal portions. The first was the
house of health; the second, that of wealth; the third,
brothers and sisters; the fourth, parents; the fifth, children
and amusements; the sixth, sickness; and so on up to the
twelfth. The connection is, of course, obvious, as Saturn in
the fifth house foretells misfortune with oneâs children.

Probably few persons have their horoscopes erected now-a-days,
but we have before us that of the Prince of Wales,
calculated at the time of his birth of Zadkiel, according to
the rules of Ptolemy. The sign in ascendant was Sagittarius,
which produces âa tall, upright body, an oval face,
ruddy complexion and chestnut hair, good eye, courteous,
just, a lover of horses, accomplished and deserving of respect.â
The Sun, being well aspected, foretold honors, and
as he was in Cancer, in sextile with Mars, the Prince was
to be partial to maritime affairs, and win naval glory. The
house of wealth was held by Jupiter, and this betokened
great wealth through inheritanceâa prognostication which,
in spite of republican shoemakers and baronets, is not unlikely
to come true. The house of marriage was inhabited
by Venus, Mars and Saturn, but fortunately the first was
to predominate, and the Prince, âafter some trouble in his
matrimonial speculations,â was to marry a princess of high
birth. A few particulars of history are given, but we are
overwhelmed with information about his character, over
fifty characteristics actually being enumerated, and the
horoscope ends, âAll things considered, though firm and
sometimes decided in opinion, this royal native, if he lives
to mount the throne, will sway the scepter of these realms
in moderation and justice, and be a pious and benevolent
man and a merciful sovereign.â

AMUSEMENTSâTENNIS.

By ROBERT MACGREGGOR.

It was in France that what its devotees call âthe king of
games,â tennis, was originated; but the ground-work is
found in the simple old hand ball play that figured so conspicuously
in the every-day life of the classical world. It is
of little use to speculate in which of the varieties of ball-play
mentioned by ancient writers is to be found the progenitor
of this pastime. At any rate, a game very like tennis,
in which the ball was driven to and fro by a racket,
was played in 1380, and soon after we find Richard II.
including this game among those unlawful for laboring
people. The name âtennisâ first occurs in Gowerâs âBalladeâ
in 1400. There is an old story of historical interest
told in connection with our game. When Henry V. was
meditating war against the King of France, the old âChronicleâ
tells us that âThe Dolphyn thynkyng Henry to be still
given to such plaies and follies as he exercised before the
tyme that he was exalted to the croune, sent hym a tunne
of tennis balles to plaie with, as he saied that he had
better skill of tennis than of warre.â Shakspere makes
Henry reply to the ambassador who brought the gift and
message:

âWe are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;

His present and your pains we thank you for;

When we have matched our rackets to these balls,

We will, in France, by Godâs grace, play a set

Shall strike his fatherâs crown into the hazard.â

While Henry received the ambassadors, James I. of Scotland
lost his life, it may be said, through his devotion to
tennis. While holding the Yuletide festival at Perth, conspirators
attacked the castle. The king tore up a plank in
the flooring of the room where he was, and dropped into a
vault below the apartment, where it was thought escape
would be easy. There had been an opening by which he
might have escaped, but this had, a few days earlier, been
closed by his own orders, because the balls by which he
played at tennis were apt to drop into it.

When we reach the reigns of the fourth and fifth Jameses
of Scotland, we find from the accounts of the lord high treasurer
many evidences of the kingsâ fondness for this game
and the considerable sums they lost at it.

Henry VII., as the register of his expenditures shows, was
a tennis player.

The fifth Scottish James was so devoted to pastimes of all
sorts that all his leisure was devoted to amusements, and
naturally his people followed his example, especially his
[442]

fondness for tennis: even the friars caught the fever, for
Lyndesay draws us a picture, probably common in that age:

âThough I preich nocht, I can play at the caiche [tennis].

I wat thair is nocht ane amang you all

Mair ferilie can play at the fute ball.â

The game is traced in English history to Henry VIII.,
who was very fond of it. It is said by a historian: âHis
propensity being perceived by certayne craftie persons, they
brought in Frenchmen and Lombards to make wagers with
hym; and so he lost muche money, but when he perceyved
theyr crafte he escheued their company and let them go.â
Though devoted to the game, the bluff old king passed a
stringent act against the keeping of any tennis-court, and
against the enjoyment of several games by apprentices,
mariners, artificers, and many others. This was only repealed
in 1863. The Reformation gave the game a shock,
especially in Scotland. During the Commonwealth the exiled
court played the game abroad. At the Restoration
Charles reintroduced the game, and probably the next few
years were the palmy days of tennis in England. In 1664,
we learn from Pepysâ diary, that the gossipy secretary had
been watching the king at tennis, but was disgusted with
the flattery bestowed upon him. He says: âI went to the
tennis-court and there saw the king play at tennis. To see
how the kingâs play was extolled, without any excuse at all,
was a loathsome sight, though sometimes he did indeed
play very well, but such open flattery is beastly.â

During the last century the records of tennis are meagre:
it seems to have been played in only one or two places.
Even in England it may be said that tennis as a popular
game went out with the Stuarts. Of course the pastime has
never actually died out, and in recent years it has had increased
attention paid to it, but even now the number of
courts does not appear to exceed a score. âTennis,â says
the
Edinburgh Review
, âthe most perfect of games, because
with the most continuous certainty it exercises and rewards
all the faculties of the player, has only been prevented hitherto
from becoming as popular as it deserves from its being,
under its original conditions, so expensive, so difficult
to learn, and so puzzling to count, as to discourage those
who are not âto the manner born,â from touching it.â The
first objection of expense seemed almost insuperable, the
cost of a tennis-court being from fifteen to twenty thousand
dollars, until the recent revival turned the game out to grass,
and introduced its rudiments to our lawns. Lawn-tennis,
however, like the croquet, which it drove off the lawn, is
not a new form of tennis. It is at least three centuries old.

CELIA SINGING.

By THOMAS STANLEY.

Roses in breathing forth their scent,

Or stars their borrowed ornament,

Nymphs in the watery sphere that move,

Or angels in their orbs above,

The wingÃ¨d chariot of the light,

Or the slow silent wheels of night,

The shade which from the swifter sun

Doth in a circular motion run,

Or souls that their eternal rest do keep,

Make far less noise than Celiaâs breath in sleep.

But if the Angel, which inspires

This subtle flame with active fires,

Should mould this breath to words, and those

Into a harmony dispose,

The music of this heavenly sphere

Would steal each soul out at the ear,

And into plants and stones infuse

A life that Cherubim would choose,

And with new powers invert the laws of fate,

Kill those that live, and dead things animate.

GERMAN-AMERICAN HOUSE-KEEPING.

By the Author of âHome Life in Germany,â etc.

I received a letter from Germany the other day, written
by a young American woman who was recently married to
a German officer. They live in a city with about the population
of Rochester, N. Y., only distinguished from other
places of its size in possessing an old cathedral, a water-cure
(
Bade Anstalt
), and being a military post. These distinguishing
features have nothing to do, however, with the
part of her letter which I desire to reflect upon. She
writes:

âI am so fortunately situated in domestic matters; I
have really no care, the
mÃ¤dchen
is so competent, and so
willing, it is a real pleasure to keep house.â

Just before the arrival of this letter I had patiently listened
for two hours to the just and lamentable complaints
of an American house-keeper about âthe impossibility of
procuring a good servant!â The latter resides in a university
town, and if a university is worse than a garrison, or students
than military men, in destroying the tone of the
laboring women and girls, then let the fact have its weight
against the statement that the relation between mistress
and maid in Europe is better regulated and understood than
in America. The two cases I have presented seem to me to
have about equal accessories, and it is a curious search to
find the reasons for the difference in them.

âSix years ago the Empress of Germany announced that she
would henceforth decorate with a golden cross every female servant
who had passed forty years of her life in the same family. The Empress
has been called upon to bestow this mark of her royal favor
893 times. Can any other country make such a remarkable showing?
In America house-maids are apt to reckon their terms of continuous
service by weeks and months instead of by years. The beginning
of reform in this matter is anxiously awaited by millions of
worried households. The heavy emigration from Germany to this
country ought to bring to our shores some of these steady-going
maids. Possibly there is something in the atmosphere of America,
in the restless movement of our people that puts the devil of change
into the heads of Gretchens and Bridgets.â

It is the âdevil of change,â as the writer expresses it,
which gets into the heads of the Gretchens and Katherinas
when they come to this country. I think I have discovered
a still better reason, which I shall timidly reveal later on,
for, in doing so, I must encroach upon national taste and
education.

First of all, we should consider that especially the uneducated
German man, or woman, girl, or boy, loves the
Vaterland
.
The
heimath
, with its low ceilings and plastered
walls, its sanded floors and wooden bench outside the door,
where the father smokes his pipe in the evening, while the
mother knits, is all enshrined in the hearts of the children,
and the recollection of the
festtage
, when the father and
mother put on their best clothes and take all the children
to the neighboring beer-garden to hear music, is always joyous.
It is only by rumors of âhigher wagesâ that such people
are ever induced to bundle up the feather beds, and lock
the wooden chest, and start as poor steerage passengers
across the great Atlantic. After the horrors of the voyage,
and the strange and confusing days of Castle Garden, what
do they find in place of the old home and the familiar ways
of the
Vaterland?
The daughters hire out probably for
cooks. First of all, they are expected to cook a heavy breakfast
by 8 oâclock, and nothing seems so hard to a foreigner
as this. Their traditions are at once set at naught. They
begin to grind on a differently constructed wheel. Just as
John Chinaman has to learn that we even turn the screw
the opposite way to the way in which he has been drilled,
so the poor Germans have to learn that if Americans offer
[443]

higher wages, they also expect things done in their own
way. The dull gray kitchen is perhaps a previous disappointment
to the heavy breakfast. No white tiles around
the oven; no brassware to see her face in! No open market
with benches where she can sit and talk with the market
women under their red umbrellas, and watch the lads go
by: covered, dull grey places are our American markets
compared with the bazar appearance of the meat and vegetable
markets of Europe. No concert in the evening for
five cents. Nothingâbut a long day and a longer evening
in an uninteresting kitchen, with different food and
different duties. Finding a young, fresh-looking girl with
her white cap on her head, in the kitchen of a friend of
mine, recently, where I chanced to be visiting, I asked her
in German if she was contented in this country, remarking
at the same time that she was fortunate to live with a lady
who could speak German, and who was so kind. âO yes,â
said she; âbut then I think I can do better. If I canât, it
were happier for me in the
Vaterland
.â

One of our distinguished politicians and scholars, who
served in Germany as United States minister, brought
back with him a German
diener
, or butler. Karl did well
for a season; maintained his respectful bearing toward the

herrschaften
and their guests until finally he announced he
was âdiscontented,â and the reason for his desire to change
places was that the
herrschaften
did not entertain as grandly
in this country as they did in Germany, and that the guests
were not such fine ladies and gentlemenâthey did not give

trink-gelt
(civility money). But the most heartfelt reason
was, he was lonely. He missed music, he missed beer, he
missed
gemÃ¼thlichkeit
, and fine and high titles by which
to call the ladies and gentlemen. And then the
festtage
âno
days in America for the poor working classes to be relieved
from care and have a good time. This did not please
Karl.

On these
festtage
in Germany a servant man or woman
has as good a chance to go to a picture gallery, or a pottery,
or a museum, or a concert, as gentlefolks; and does not the
knowledge and pleasure gained at such places make the servant
more cheerful, and intelligent, and competent to look at
work not as drudgery, but as something in which the whole
human family is engaged in one way or another? Said an
observing servant to me after an afternoon in a picture gallery:
âHow can those poor artists sit all day long with
their feet on the stone floor and copy pictures? They look
so tired I was glad I was not one of them!â After a visit to
the
KÃ¶nigliche Porzellan Manufactur
, in Charlottenburg, I
remember once having asked a servant if she knew how
much labor it required to manufacture a cup and saucer;
and I proceeded to tell her how the feldspar found in the
vicinity of Berlin was ground to powder, cleaned through
various tanks of water, each time running through a sieve,
then how they pass it between heavy weights so that it
came out in great sheets of pliable putty, which are laid
over moulds, just as a piece of dough is laid over a pie-pan.
When these forms are taken off, they are carefully finished
in every indentation by skilful workmen, who have delicate
tools for the purpose. Afterward they take these forms,
cups, saucers, plates, vegetable dishes, as they may be, and
bake them in ovens for sixteen hours the first time, and after
they are taken out they are glazed and baked again, and then
if the ware is to be painted it must be baked again; and if
gilded, still again. I ended this elaborate description all
out of breath, for it required as much command of the German
language as I at that time thought I had. The attentive
girl, however, relieved my excitement by saying: âYes;
I have been out there,
gnÃ¤dige frau
, and seen it all, and
this is why I try to be so careful with china.â In the five
years this good girl had lived with me she had rarely broken
a piece. I could but think how unlike the answer
âBiddyâ would have given, that âthe kitchen floor is very
hard on china.â I have known servant girls as much interested
in the collections of laces in the museums, especially
the specimens made by poor peasant women in different
centuries, as any high-born lady, and much more capable
of reproducing specimens of this industry. The costumes
of the peasants and the costumes of the kings and queens,
and the furniture used by the latter, will attract crowds of
ignorant people by the hour in European museums. But
who ever sees any but the intelligent and rich walking
about in the Metropolitan Museum of New York, or the
Academy in Boston. We do not care to interest the working
classes in this country; only care to see that they work
well and as many hours as possible. âThere remains,â
says a writer on duties of contract, âoutside of their actual
service, or of any assumption of authority on our side, really
limitless fields for the exercise of our natural influence as
their immediate superiors and friends.â I think, in the
matter of lodgingâthe rooms the Americans give their
servants to sleep inâthey fare infinitely better than in any
foreign country; but the food is not so well adapted to their
physical wants. Delicate dishes and highly seasoned food
are sent into the kitchen for the servants by our American
housekeepers, and you hear them say: âO, we would not
think of denying our servants all the dainties of our own
table.â Do they ever think that a working man or woman,
no matter of what nationality, prefers boiled beef and turnips,
or bacon and cabbage, to sweet breads and peas, or
venison and cauliflower. But this is an inexhaustible
theme, and one I must defer yet again before I venture to
say what I think about the genuine American table.

In the town of Delitzsch, in the province of Posen, resides
a manâHerr Schulze-Delitzschâwho has devoted himself
almost exclusively for years to the study of the labor question
and the elevation of the working classes. He is a great
reformer, but escapes being known as a revolutionist. More
practical and perhaps more methodical than Lasalle, he relies
not upon the state for aid, but upon the sympathy and
help of the working classes themselves. He organized workingmenâs
associations, union stores, etc. France, Belgium,
Italy, and even England, became awakened, and looked
with interest upon his work, and inquiries were made by
authority of the English government into the real manner
and methods adopted. As a writer on the subject remarks:
âSchulzeâs methods are economical and reformatory; Lasalleâs
were political and revolutionary.â The
Credit und
Vorschuss Verein
, which is a species of savings bank, was
practically his work. The members contributed of their
savings to this fund, and when old age, sickness, or misfortune
overtook them, and they were obliged to give up laboring
by the day, they were in turn helped. The
Vereins

were entirely under the management of the members. The
investment of the capital was entirely under their control,
the surplus being divided annually, and the âsick fundsâ
and âfuneral fundsâ were distributed by them. The first
institution was founded in 1850, and in 1869 the number
reached 1,750. The permanent capital was then 12,000,000
thalers. The hired laborers form a tenth of the membership
of the unions, and they are on the increase; the farmers
something more than a fifth; the tradesmen a tenth, and
the mechanics a third. The farmerâs aim is, in part, the
procuring, in common, seed, implements, etc.; in part, the
sale in common of milk, butter, cheese, hops, wine, and
other products. Thus, through moderate and just ideas and
management, much has been accomplished. Working people
must not be fed on incendiary ideas. Ruskinâs lectures
to working men savor of
dilettante
ideas. A man who has
never been poor rarely knows how to appeal to the poor or
guide them. Schulze-Delitzschâs philosophy has been
learned from actual experience. There is nothing of the
[444]

factious orator about him, but he is calm and persuasive.
He is not a social-democrat, but belongs to the progressive
party, which stands for the most advanced form of liberalism.
He organizes the poor to teach them to resist their
own worst faults. He was burgomaster of Delitzsch at one
time, after leaving political life in the capital, because of
differences which arose. He was assisted by his mother to
go on lecturing tours, and when this was no longer practicableâas
she had also small meansâthere was a purse
raised by the citizens, which reached the sum of 50,000
thalers; the greater part being given by the poor working
people in paltry sums. Thus he was saved for higher work,
and gave up the position of burgomaster. He accepted this
money only in trustâinvesting part in a home at Potsdam
and the rest in such a way that the interest only accrues to
him. If it was worth Englandâs time to inquire into the
economic methods of the
Credit und Vorschuss Verein
, perhaps
America could utilize some ideas on this subject. Germany
is finding out many of our ways and means, which
she considers superior to her own conservative methods.
Dr. Max Zering, of Berlin, was recently commissioned by
the government of Prussia to investigate and report upon the
agricultural and transportation interests and methods of the
United States. He will visit the different cities, make the
acquaintance of their boards of trade, chambers of commerce,
and railroad managers. It seems that the day has
come when nations are becoming very liberal toward one
another. The exclusive spirit which prevails in China, more
than in any other country, is fast being eradicated, and all
people are exclaiming, âIf you know anything better, or accomplish
anything in an easier way than we do, pray let us
have a lesson of you.â

Perhaps different nations show their identity more in regard
to preparing and eating food than in any other particular.
The roots from which their different languages spring
are more easily discerned by a philologist, than the common-sense
basis which has suggested to each people its
separate ideas on food and the preparation of it, is found out
by any scientific chemist. I have been asked so often how
the German markets and groceries compare with ours in
variety and price, that it occurs to me to insert here an extract
from an account book of my butcher and grocer of the
preis
courant
for the years 1876, 1877, 1878, etc.:

Some of these prices will show that Germany is no longer a
cheap country to live in, but the way in which articles of
food are used and managed is where the French and Germans
excel in economy. For instance, American housekeepers
say in the winter and fall and spring, âIt is so difficult
to keep a good table, because there is so little variety
in our markets.â And when they say this there will oftentimes
be ten different meats and as many vegetables to be
had. Now why does this complaint go on from year to year?
Men and women are both to blame for it, and to show how
they are is an easy task. If these ten meats and corresponding
number of vegetable are judiciously managed, both
health and economy can be forwarded. I will enumerate
the meats and vegetables, that no housekeeper may say this
is random talk: Beef (1), mutton (2), veal (3), pork (4),
ham (5), corn beef (6), turkey (7), chicken (8), fish (9), game
(10); kidneys, sweet-breads, and the like, not to be mentioned
here, for fear our American taste will falter. Vegetables: Potatoes,
sweet potatoes, turnips, carrots, onions, cabbage, beets,
beans, squash, celery. Here you have ten without all the
fine canned peas and tomatoes and corn on your shelves.
Now, I am laughing because every delicately-minded woman
in America exclaims at once, âBut you have enumerated
vegetables that our husbands and we ourselves would
not touch!â Well, neither would a Frenchman, if they
came on his table with the combinations of meat, etc., that
you serve them with. A Frenchman knows (and the highest
toned German has learned from him) that there are
chemical affinities in food, and he selects his meat to correspond
with his vegetable, or
vice versa
, as carefully as he
would combine chemical properties in a laboratory; or as
discreetly as he would choose guests for his drawing-room
or dinner-table; or as daintily as his wife would select gloves
to match her bonnet. Food assorted with bad taste and
judgment on his table is as distasteful as a delicate watercolor
framed in a moulding which belongs to a heavy old
historical oil painting is to his eye. The subject may seem
to many unworthy such attention. There are those who
boast that âthey do not care what they eat, so they get
enough! or how the table is set, or whether everything
comes on at once or not!â Well, this is the way Frederick
the Greatâs father felt; the ruder and rougher, the better for
his children; whether they took bread with a fork, or ate
with their knives, or mixed cabbage and eggs, it didnât matter
to him, so the exchequer was sound. But what effect
did all this boorish home-life have upon young Frederick?
It made him eschew every German custom, every Teutonic
idea, and give himself up entirely to the French, to be ruled
by his French cooks, and dressed by French tailors, and entertained
by French wits. Now the Germans have established
their own reputation for combinations which they
consider good, and it appears that the wife of our honored
poet, who died as United States Minister in Berlin (a German
woman by birth), is not ashamed to write on German
cookery, although a woman of high and unquestioned literary
attainments, who could help her husband in the arduous
task of translating Faust. We Americans do not
study this matter, or if we do, and make an effort to improve,
it is simply an imitation, and a poor one at that, of
some European ways. As health and happiness depend so
much upon whether our dinner âsets well,â the knowledge
of instituting such a mode of living as is best calculated to
preserve health, is a most desirable acquisition. And if
errors are committed in this respect, our injured system must
suffer the bad consequences.

Now let us make a practical rÃ©sumÃ© of the subject: There
are ten meats and ten vegetables in the market and twenty-one
meals in the week to provide for. Let us first think of
Sunday, for every man wants a good dinner on Sunday, especially
if he has done his duty at church, and contributed
his rightful portion to the Lordâs kingdom. If a woman has
but one girl, or servant, it seems only right for her to take
Sunday about with that servant, or propose to do so, that
the poor girl may also know occasionally the pleasure of
[445]

putting on her good clothes early Sunday morning and
walking with a quiet conscience to the house of God. And
then it gives the lady of the house a good two hours to reflect
upon the drudgery that the hired laborer does for the
householdâand if she be an inexperienced woman, she
should learn to cook one dinner a week. Perhaps these are
rigid rules, but they bring good results to a womanâs heart
and home. Suppose you have purchased some game for
Sunday dinner: see that it is prepared for cooking on Saturday,
so that the mere roasting of it will cause you little
trouble on Sunday; and if, in addition to this, you and your
husband have determined, instead of having six vegetables,
as most American tables present, to have but one and a
salad, let it be in this instance mashed Irish potatoes and
celery, or lettuce, or even fine-chopped cabbage, if no other
acid can be had. If you have not had soup, manage to compensate
by beautiful desserts, which are easily arranged on
Saturday also. Blanc mange or custards are better by being
cold. Then you can have fresh fruits, and after dinner coffee.
Does this seem a meagre and miserably arranged dinner,
or does the following combination, which I not long
ago found on an American table, seem better? Fish, beef,
onions, eggs, cabbage, dried peaches, and pickles, before
oneâs eyes all at once! There is as much difference to an
Ã¦sthetical taste between the simple but harmonious dinner,
described above, and the incongruous, distasteful dinner just
mentioned, as there is between a well-selected costume on a
pretty woman, and an ugly mixture of color and cut, covered
by laces and jewelry, on an ugly woman; or, between
a tastefully arranged drawing-room and a hodge-podge of
furniture and drapery, which have no one element of similitude.

As the legend goes, Monday is the âtug of warâ for housekeepers.
Admit that the dinner is the secondary thing and
that it must be late in starting. But if you have an understanding
with your butcher to send a piece of beef for boiling
and you put it on at 10 oâclock with a few carrots and an
onion to flavor it, you will have some deliciously tender stuff
at 12 oâclock, with enough
bouillon
to set away for to-morrow,
and if you have horse-radish to eat your beef with, and some
macaroni
a la creme
, or baked tomatoes or sweet potatoes
(one, not all three), with a good salad (an indispensable article),
your Monday dinner will not be so dreadful, although
it has cost little or no time in the preparation. See that
your husband makes the salad dressing if he is well disposed
to do his part, at the table. A woman has enough to look
after of such details. Dispense with the dessert on Monday,
but let fresh fruit never be absent from your table if you
can afford it. Oranges, bananas, apples, grapes, pears,
peaches; how lavish Nature is in this direction!

For our Tuesday dinner we have the
bouillon
set away
from yesterdayâso that a roast is essentialâalways alternating
between boiling and roasting, and never letting a dinner
be roasted throughout, or
vice versa
. A roast of lamb or
mutton with mint sauce, and turnips boiled, and apple jelly,
will perhaps answer, as we have had the soup to begin with.
A good plum pudding would taste well after this and some
acid fruit, with your coffee to finish with. Of course, Europeans
begin every dinner with soup, and their recipes are
innumerable. But we are here endeavoring to get up inexpensive
meals that almost any family can indulge in.

Wednesday: Chickens or squirrel fricasseed, or boiled
with rice and seasoned with East India curry, makes a very
inviting dish, if the rice is laid around the chicken and garnished
with parsley. Give us peas, or lima beans, or Saratoga
potatoes with this meat. Saratoga potatoes served
when the chicken is brought on, and later a course of tongue
and peasâif the gentleman of the house complains that
chicken is too delicate a fowl for him to make a dinner from.
Dessert, a lemon pie or pudding, etc., etc.

Thursday: To-day the washing and ironing are all through
with, and the best dinner of the week can be prepared. What
shall it be? An Englishman would say, roast beef; a German,
a goose; an Italian, veal, tomatoes, and macaroni;
a Frenchman, wild pigeons, or sweet-breads, or deviled
crabs, or some dainty combinations. What does the great
American heart cry out for? Turkey and oysters! turkey
and oysters! and six vegetables; everything the season affords,
reserving nothing for the morrow. Have your own
way about this Thursday dinner. I shall not interfere with
economic ideas or European combinations, but promise to
tell me when it is over if your purse is not lighter and your
stomach heavier than you anticipated? If so, Friday, I
shall take you under instruction again, and to restore your
over-taxed stomach we will have, first, a good beef soup,
and, to invigorate you mentally, after the soup, we will have
a beautiful salmon, or any large fish, stuffed and baked;
served with potatoes and barley bread, which will also give
phosphorus. Stewed cherries for dessert, and cheese and
crackers will supply other needs.

By Saturday you will have recovered from that heavy
dinner of Thursday, and from Fridayâs dinner the cook will
possibly have saved enough fish to make some nice little
fish patties to serve before the good, rare roast of beef, which
for our Saturday dinner is accompanied by spinach, made
very fine, mashed to the consistency of mashed potatoes,
and served with a plateful of bread-dice, (in form of cubes),
which have been fried as one fries doughnuts; roasted potatoes
and a fresh salad; a cardinal, or transparent, or cream
pudding, and your fresh fruit, and after dinner coffee.

You will feel, as Sunday approaches again, that you have
at least had variety from day to day, and not eaten something
of everything the market affords every day, until you
are utterly tired of everything! From the beef of Saturday
can be prepared for Sunday breakfast what the French call
a
rÃ¢gout
, which is more savory than hash, because the
pieces of meat are left about two inches in size, and flavored
with a bit of bacon, potatoes, carrots, and onions.

In this enumeration I have left beefsteak, liver, kidneys,
sweet-breads, and ham untouched. All of these I presumed
you would claim for your breakfasts and teas. Sardines,
and dried beef and tongue, and many other things the market
also gives you, and in exercising some ingenuity you
will not have to repeat the same dish day after day, nor
confine yourself to roasting and frying everything, when
things are often better boiled, or stewed, or smothered. And
now I will not intrude upon another Sunday dinner. I can
only hope, in parting from the subject and from you, that
the kitchen and dining-room have grown more interesting.

I think of but one other habit and one custom in which
the Germans differ from us. Instead of sitting in their bed-rooms,
as so many Americans do, they invariably have a
sitting-room attached to the bed-room, and the bed-room is
used merely as a place for repose.

They pay their physicians so much a year, whether there
be need for their services or not. Some years it happens
there will be many members of the household sick, but the
doctor is not expected to ask more that year than he did
the year before, when he was only called once or twice.
Fifty thalers is the usual amount for a small family, or
about forty dollars of our money. Professional nurses are
to be found even in small provincial towns, and neighbors
are not called upon, as among us, to serve this purpose.

âSlander,â says Saint Bernard, âis a poison which extinguishes
charity, both in the slanderer and in the person who
listens to it; so that a single calumny may prove fatal to an
infinite number of souls, since it kills not only those who
circulate it, but also all those who do not reject it.ââ
Pascal.

CHANGES IN FASHIONS.

From the French of M. A. CHALLAMEL.

Fashion is the expositor of our habits and our social relations,
from the standpoint of costume. It is a much more
serious subject than it may seem at first; far from serving
only as a source of frivolous talk, even when it is specially
concerned with our dress and ornamentation, the subject of
fashion, it has been wisely said, has its value as a moral
sign-post, and supplies the historian, the philosopher, and
the novelist with a guide to the prevailing ideas of the time.

It is of the French fashions we speak here; for in France,
the land of classic fancy, the empire of fashion, has assuredly
been more deeply felt than elsewhere. Even in primitive
Gaul were the fashions fixed, but their common sense
is to be commended. The Gallic woman was demanded by
fashion to follow a strict course of bathing. In every
locality baths were established, and they were to her a delight,
a duty, and a necessity. At Marseilles young girls
were forbidden by custom the use of wine, lest it should injure
the ivory whiteness of their complexion. To guard
against excess in dress, the law required that the highest
marriage portion of a woman should not exceed one hundred
golden crowns. The history of political events has
had more influence on fashion than may be generally supposed.
Upon the conquest of the country by CÃ¦sar, Roman
manners were introduced into primitive Gaul, and the Gallic
women, declining to be beaten in the art of pleasing, as
their husbands had in arms, adopted the fashions of Rome.
Extravagance in dress became boundless. We have in this
early period the beginning of two modern fashions. Some
ladies chose to wear garments which, on account of their
breadth, were called by Horace
palissades
. From these the
crinoline appears to have been derived. Ovid observes that
to equalize the shoulders, if one were slightly higher than
the other, it was customary to drape lightly the lower of the
two. Thus originated padding. These Gallo-Roman ladies
were elegant in all their surroundings, and the Frenchwoman
of to-day has not a better sorted wardrobe. Parasols,
mirrors, fans, perfumes, pomatums, and cosmeticsâall
these things were known to the Gallo-Roman period.

It was not until about the tenth century that dress in
France became original. The women of the provinces
adopted costumes of their own, and, at their will, added
details. Indeed, if the history of fashion is studied, it will
be seen that the original type of dress has not changed. It
is the subordinate parts that undergo continual alteration.
The skirt, the tunic (or overskirts), the mantle, the cap and
reticule have always existed since the time of our Gallic
mothers. One modification of the skirt produced a great
furore in religious circlesâit was the trail to the gown. A
disgusted prior said: âThe tail gives a woman the look of
a serpent,â and the council of Montpellier forbade the appendix
in question on penalty of excommunication. No
fashion ever brought down more anathemas on the fair sex
than the â
hennins
.â It was introduced, too, in a period
when it would naturally be supposed that the very terror of
the time would have destroyed all passion for dress and capricious
fashionsâthe melancholy time of the Hundred
Yearsâ War. This hennin was a kind of two-horned head-dress,
made of muslin, stiffly starched and kept in place by
fine wire, and of most exaggerated size. Paradin says: âIt
was peaked like a steeple, or with tall horns; from these
horns hang flags, capes, fringe and other material. Such
head-dresses were naturally very expensive, and husbands
were loud in complaint.â Confessors and monks added
their curses. They considered the hennin as an invention
of the evil one, and organized a deadly warfare against the
obnoxious article; but this uproar availed nothing, the women
only gave up their hennins from a caprice similar to
that which had invented them.

One strange fashion of the whole Middle Ages related to
the color of the hair. Fair hair alone was considered beautiful.
On this point the French and the Greeks were of one
mind. In Shakspereâs play of âAs You Like Itâ we find
Rosalind as she hoots at PhÅbe, laughing at her âblack
silk-hairâ as a mark of her plainness. The word âfashionâ
seems to convey an almost absolute sense of novelty, but
that which is new to-day may be but a revival of what is
old. âThere is nothing new under the sun,â applies with
special force to fashion. The pretty trifles worn by women
of to-day are nothing but the reproduction of similar ornaments
worn by the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, or
the Gauls, and all our novelties find their origin many centuries
in the past.

THE HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY
OF EDUCATION.

By W. T. HARRIS.

VI.âGREECE AND ITS RELATION TO THE EAST.

In previous chapters we have studied the nations of
Western Asia and Africa in regard to internal appliances
for education, but more especially in regard to external educational
influence upon other peoples.

At this important point in our discussions, when we are
passing into a new regionâthat of Europe, or âthe West,â
as contrasted with Asia as âthe Eastââwe may sum up
briefly the chief results before considering the special theme
of this chapter.

Education in Egypt consisted, on the part of the common
people, in learning to read and write the script alphabet derived
from the hieroglyphics, the elements of arithmetic, and
oneâs trade or vocation. A higher system of education was
reserved for the candidates for the priestly caste, including
the branches of language, mathematics, astronomy, natural
science, music and religion. There was also a secret doctrine
taught to the illuminated ones who entered on the
duties of the priestly caste.

In Egypt the State was as thoroughly subordinated to the
priestly class as in Persia to the military caste, or in PhÅnicia
and Carthage to the mercantile caste. The aim of
life was there to prepare for death, and the earthly hull of
the body was to be carefully preserved as the soul would
need its body again after 3,000 years; it was carefully embalmed
and laid to rest in the tombs of the hills, or if royal
was placed in a pyramid. The court in which the dead
were tried and judgment pronounced upon their lives, decreeing
the honors of burial or denying this privilege was
the great national educational institution.

With the old Persians education according to Herodotus
consisted chiefly in training its youth to bear arms and to
tell the truth. To use the bow and arrow skilfully and to
ride on horseback fitted him for duties in his warlike nation.

Theoretical education included the arts of reading, writing,
and polite behavior, and was in the hands of the eighty
thousand Magi, a carefully educated class, who divided their
members into three grades: (
a
) the apprentices, or first initiated;
(
b
) journeymen, those who had passed the second
degree, and (
c
) masters, those who had reached the highest
degree. The Persian mind set up the principles of light and
darkness, which he further defined as good and evil. It was
a point upon which great stress was laid by their teachers,
to inculcate a practice of good and an abhorrence of evil.
The public education lasted from the age of seven to that of
twenty-four. Before the fifth year the child was not to be
told âthis is bad,â or âthis is good,â but only told âdo not do
[447]

it again,â when he committed a fault. Before the age of
seven years he was never to be whipped. The virtues of
self-denial in matters of eating and drinking, of conquest
over oneâs appetites, and of obedience to what is prescribed,
were especially inculcated.

Of the PhÅnician education we know only that it laid
great stress upon what is useful in the arts and trades. The
Carthaginian colony taught their youth reading, writing,
arithmetic, and religious duties, besides a special trade and
the use of arms. Their moral instruction was of a questionable
character, useful in their commerce perhaps, but admitting
of deceit and violence. âPunic faithâ became a
by-word in surrounding nations for treachery. In PhÅnicia
we find a marked departure from the family training that
formed so large a part of the instruction in other Oriental
nations. Indifference toward family and oneâs native land,
and a passionate love for adventure and commercial gain
were fostered necessarily in its system of education, because
the State depended upon these qualities for its prosperity.

In Judea the education wore an oriental stamp. Religious
history perhaps was the foremost of the branches of
study. The arts of reading and writing were required in
order that the youth might learn to read the written law
which had been especially delivered to his nation from the
most high to Moses on Mount Sinai. The law was impressed
upon the memory of the child. Song and music
were taught but gymnastics was neglected. The girls
learned household employmentsâspinning, weaving, sewing,
painting, cooking, dancing, and cymbal-playing. They
were educated by their mothers in piety, cleanliness, and
morality. A school of prophets seems to have been established
by Samuel when music and religious poetry were
cultivated. After the Babylonian exile rabbinical lore was
prominent in the higher education.

The Mediterranean Sea is the center of all progressive civilization
in modern history. Upon its shores the Orient
and Occident have met and mingled. PhÅnicia, Judea,
Greece, Rome, Carthage,âthese have played their parts in
its history. The European states trace the first impulses of
their culture to Asia. But Europe borrowed nothing without
assimilating it to a new principle radically different
from the Oriental principle. It is the principle of individualityâof
personal development, of personal achievement,
of personal freedom,âthat we meet upon the shores of
Europe, and education assumes at once a new interest to us
when we come to Greece and Rome.

A wide chasm separates the European education from the
Asiatic. The East celebrates the infinite as something not
only without bounds and limits, but as something devoid of
all distinction, and hence devoid of conscious personality;
God is in his essence not revealable to man, is their doctrine.
Europe, on the other hand, celebrates the distinctions
within the personality. In Western Asia, and particularly
in Egypt, there was an approach toward the recognition
of personality in God, and in the Hebrew religion
there was the complete attainment of this idea. The Hebrew
idea finds its beginnings in Asia, but its development
looks to Europe, whose peoples find in the religion derived
from Judea their ideal.

Greece and Rome develop the idea of individuality in a
very different manner from Persia and Egypt, and do not
know anything of the Hebrew idea until their national
career has been run. Greece does not reach the idea of one
God as Jehovah, but it conceives the divine as beautiful individualityâthe
gods of Olympus, serene and graceful, but
having the special character of human beings.

It was a great step to recognize this human character in
the divine,âand the Greek mind rejoiced in the consciousness
that his gods were so nearly of his own nature that
they could and did dwell in human bodies.

This idea furnishes us the first phase of Greek educationâthe
education of the body by gymnastic games, so as to
make it perfectly beautiful and graceful. Cultivation of the
body was a religious exercise, for it was a celebration of the
divine by realizing it in the form of the beautiful. The
East Indian ascetic sought by all means to mortify and deform
the body. The Greek sought to perfect it.

There were games for all the Greek Statesâthe Olympian,
the Pythian, the NemÃ¦an, and Isthmianâinternational
expositions of strength and beauty.

When the ideal of beauty had been fixed, there came the
sculptor who conceived the forms and expressions of the
gods of Olympus, taking his hints from human models
that he saw all around him. The national culture in gymnastics
first, the plastic arts second, these conspired to produce
the ideals of beauty which educated the Greek people,
and furnish an essential element in the education of all subsequent
time. Preceding all plastic art was the poetry of
Homer, out of which the Greek civilization seems to have
been breathed.

The second book of the
Iliad
furnished the staple of school
education, giving the history and geography of ancient
Greece with the most wonderful of literary forms. The
Odyssey

extended the education in the same direction, and gave
under a thin veil of allegory, the Greek moral code.

The general character of Greek education may be said to
be Ã¦stheticâa cultivation of the sense of the beautiful, and a
training of the body into symmetry and grace. Gymnastics,
music, and grammatical art were the staples of their pedagogy.
By music they meant not only a sense of rhythm
and measure, but spiritual culture in generalâincluding the
several branches over which the Nine Muses presidedâwhence
its name âmusic.â Poetry and music and mathematics
were all included under this designation. Grammatical
training included reading, writing, and language
studies.

In the development of individuality, the mutual independence
of the Greek States and difference in their races or
stocks were both causes and results. The Ãolian, Dorian,
and Ionian stocks manifested different tendencies, the Ãolians
preferring ear-culture, or music; the Dorians, bodily
culture; the Ionians, poetry. The Dorians at Sparta educated
boys and girls in the same way, although in separate
institutions. There was, indeed, in Sparta, a tendency
toward the Persian form of education, with important differences
in regard to truth-speaking and honesty. The
child was educated solely for the needs of the State, being
trained to endure heat and cold and fatigue, and every year
being obliged to conform to a more severe discipline, until
at thirty years he had become a complete Spartan veteran
soldier. Nevertheless the Spartan preserved his Greek individuality
even under his Oriental forms of despotism.

The Spartans, though agreeing with the Athenians in certain
general characteristics, were in sharp contrast to the
latter in the spirit of their education. It was their aim to
produce able warriors that led them to train their youth
carefully in bodily strength and agility, capacity of endurance,
personal bravery, and patriotism. Up to the seventh
year the boy was educated in the family; after that time in
public, and fed at the common table, and trained with other
youth in the disciplines above mentioned, as well as in the
art of skillful theft. Every year there was a general public
flogging in order to test their strength of endurance and
sense of honor. He who bore all the pain without uttering
a cry was crowned with garlands. Spartan youth sometimes
died under these tortures without uttering a sound.
From year to year the discipline became more and more
severe. The Spartan girls were trained to be companions of
heroes, and had their own gymnasia wherein they learned
to run, to wrestle, to jump, and ride the chariot.
[448]

At Athens, the chief seat of the Ionian stock, we find the
purest type of Greek nationality.

The education of Spartans was designed, as has been said,
to fit youth for citizens that could defend the State. That
of Athens was for free individuality. The laws of Solon enjoined
upon each father in Athens to teach his son a trade,
whereby he could earn his living. If the father neglected
this the son was absolved from the duty of supporting him
in old age. The law of Solon decreed that the boy, before
all else, should learn how to read and how to swim. It was
a maritime State, and the Greek lived much upon the water.
The son of poor parents should be taught music, horsemanship,
and gymnastics, hunting and philosophy. It was left
to the father to decide whether these higher studies should
be undertaken or not. But public opinion was so strong
that no father dared to refuse a higher education to his son
if his means allowed it. For the first seven years the
Athenian boy was under the care of the women. During
this period he played with rattles, balls, wooden horses,
dice and tops, the skipping of stones in the water, etc. The
games and plays of Greek children are interesting, when
we study the development of his individuality,âinteresting
also in hints as to the modern experiment of the kindergarten.

At seven years began the school time of the Athenian boy.
An old superannuated slave was assigned to the work, and
called in the Greek language
pÃ¦dagogos
, pedagogue, (
boy-driver
)
who accompanied him everywhere as supervisor. In
the
pedagogium
the boy learned to read and write. Later
came the music teacher, who taught him to play the CithÃ¦ra
and sing. At last he took up gymnastics and continued
it till his eighteenth year. Then he took up his trade selected
by the father, and at the age of twenty his education
was considered complete.

In the famous funeral oration which Thucydides puts into
the mouth of Pericles he congratulates the Athenians on
the fact that their fatherland was a great educational center,
a sort of school for all Greece. Their temples and works
of art were objects of study to all enterprising strangers.
Their artists, and poets, and philosophers were sought for
the education of all who aspired to culture. The Sophists
formed a guild of professional teachers. After Plato and
Aristotle, Athens remained a university for many hundred
years, or until Justinian closed her schools because of their
hostility to the State religion.

The period of the Sophists is of great interest. As teachers
of dialectic and rhetoric, they endeavored to fit the
Athenian youth for skillful and effective pleas in the courts
or persuasive harangues before the people. They taught
how to debate and how to make the worse appear the better
reason. They pushed their speculations beyond rhetorical
forms into the realms of philosophy, and in the end questioned
all principles of conviction, and even the bases of
morality. All faith was undermined. At this juncture
rose Socrates, the greatest character of his age, who showed
up by a keener dialectic the firm foundations of virtue and
truth, under the shifting sands of opinion and prejudice.
Plato has preserved for us in his dialogues the beautiful picture
of Socrates in his knight-errant exploits against the
Sophists, and finally his tragic but heroic end. Platoâs
works have been for more than two thousand years a liberal
education into sound and deep philosophy, and, with the
works of Aristotle, his pupil and successor, form the canonical
books of philosophy. They have furnished the philosophical
forms used by the Christian fathers in building up
the great structure of Christian theology.

The Greek people have given to the world the two great
elements of art and scienceâthe Ã¦sthetic and theoretic forms
of culture. Their defect is found in their exclusive devotion
to those two phases. We must find in the Roman civilization
the forms of the will which civilization has needed in
order to form political and social institutionsâthe Greeks
were weak on this side.

Above all, the deep spirituality, the communion with God
as the one Infinite Person, creator of heaven and earth, is
not to be found in Greek education, although it is the most
important, nay, the all-essential point in our modern education.

After the time of Aristotle the Greek intellect dissipated
itself in Stoicism and skepticism, and a cloud of darkness
settled down gradually over the country, when Rome conquered
its last armies, and reduced it to obedience to an
alien principle. At a few centers like Alexandria and Athens,
art and science were cultivated to a very high degree,
but Greece had nothing new to contribute to the world, and
its labors henceforth were for Roman hire, or frequently the
work of bondmen. The wealthy Roman owned Greek slaves,
who acted as tutors to his children and producers of art for
his amusement. But as nurses and tutors the Greek soon
spread his Greek education over the mighty nation that had
conquered the world.

DAFFODILS AT SEA.

By J. S. HOWSON.

Fair daffodils I took across the western sea away,

To cheer my lonely cabin and to talk to me of home.

Not double daffodils I took, but singleâfreshly come

From wintry village fields. I hate the dowager display,

That spoils sweet natureâs manner, and with bold and stately stare

Arrays in artificial pomp the fashionable square.

Not for me only were those gifts. I marked where children clung,

Warm and close-pressed, around a mother seeking distant lands.

One flower I chose apart and placed in tiny baby hands,

When soon it lay in fragments, on the wet deck torn and flung.

Dear child! she only broke her latest toy. What should she know

Of hopes and memories that in those yellow petals grow?

Another to a woman lone, with sorrow worn and spent,

I gave: she took it tearfully; and when I next passed by,

She held it tenderly, and watched it with a serious eye,

As loth that it should fade. Perchance her quickened fancy went,

Where once her footsteps strayed, by mountain stream and copse and glen,

And neighbor-cottages, which now she will not see again.

Fair daffodils, what power lives for us in your gentle mood!

Sure promise of bright spring beyond the changeful stormy ways;

Lessons of quiet love, that bind our last and earliest days;

Of patience, and of humble hope to be not great but good.

Then let me learn what ye would calmly teach, here by my side,

In pensive dignity and grace and modest queenly pride.

There is no uprightness of intention that can justify calumny;
nor even though the question were the conversion
of the whole earth to the belief of revealed truth, would it be
allowable to blacken the innocent, because we must not do
the least evil even to bring about the greatest good, for âthe
truth of God requires not the assistance of our untruths,â as
the Scripture says (Job xiii:7).â
Pascal.

THE WORTH OF FRESH AIR.

[
Concluded.
]

A very large quantity of fresh air is spoiled and rendered
foul by the act of breathing. You, yourself, spoil not less
than a gallon every minute. In eight hoursâ breathing a
full-grown man spoils as much fresh air as seventeen three-bushel
sacks could hold! If you were shut up in a room
seven feet broad, seven feet long, and seven feet high, the
door and windows fitting so tightly that no air could pass
through, you would die, poisoned by your own breath, in a
very few hours; in twenty-four hours you would have spoiled
all the air contained in the room, and have converted it
into poison, provided you could have lived therein so long.

One hundred years ago the English were allowed by the
Great Mogul or Emperor of India, to build warehouses and
dwellings in certain parts of his Empire. One of these mercantile
settlements or factories, as they were called, was
planted on the bank of a large river just where Calcutta, the
capital city of Bengal, now stands.

In the year 1756, the nabob, or tributary king of the province
of Bengal died, and was succeeded by a very young
man, who bore the outlandish looking title of Surajah Dowlah.
This young barbarian cast a covetous eye on the neighboring
British factory, and one summer day attacked the
place suddenly with a large army. The small party of
English who were in the factory, despairing of their ability
to effect any successful defense, tried to make their escape
to some ships which were lying in the river.

Several of the fugitives reached the vessels in safety. But
in the confusion of the flight, one hundred and forty-six
individuals fell into the hands of the victorious nabob.
These, his officers thrust for the night into a small cell,
which was used as the prison of the fortress, and was known
under the dismal name of the Black Hole of Calcutta. This
cell had but two small square holes for windows, and was
only eighteen feet long and fourteen feet wide, so that the
last person of the one hundred and forty-six had to be
crushed in upon the rest with violence, as the door was
closed and locked. The anguish of the crowded captives
soon became so great, in this vile hole, that the neighborhood
resounded with the noise of their struggles and cries.
As the night wore on, these sounds, however, gradually sunk
into silence. When the morning came, and the door of the
prison was opened, the reason of this silence became sadly
apparent. In the place of the one hundred and forty-six
prisoners who were shut up on the previous day, they took
out one hundred and twenty-three corpses, and, twenty-three
miserable beings, who looked more like ghastly spectres
than men, and who could hardly be said to be alive.
This occurrence furnished one remarkable instance of the
deadly power of the poison vapors which are poured out
from the inside of living beings. Now I will tell you
about another case of a similar kind.

A few years ago, a vessel started from Cork in Ireland, to
take a large number of emigrants to a ship just about to sail
from Liverpool. A violent storm sprung up in the night, as
the vessel was crossing the Irish Channel, and the captain,
fearing that the alarmed passengers would interfere with
the sailors, and render it difficult to work the ship, sent
them all below into the hold, and covered them closely
down with the hatches. The imprisoned passengers soon
found that they were suffocating, and called and knocked
loudly for help, but their cries either were unheard or disregarded.
In the morning the hatches were removed, and
to the horror of the captain and his crew, the hold was found
half full of dead bodies and dying people, instead of containing
living men and women. Such are the fearful consequences
which follow, when human beings are forced to
breathe the same air over and over again.

You are very much shocked, both at the savage cruelty of
the Indian tyrant, and at the carelessness and ignorance of
the Irish captain. But what will you think of yourself if I
now show that you do, in a small degree, every night, what
they did on so large a scale? What was it that caused the
closeness of this room before we opened the window? It
was the presence of precisely the same kind of poison, as
that which killed the prisoners at Calcutta, and the passengers
in the hold of the ship. That poison did not destroy
you in a single night, only because it had not gathered in
sufficient strength to do so. Your room was not more than
half as large as the Black Hole of Calcutta, but there were
only two of you shut up in it instead of one hundred and
forty-six. The air of your room was merely hurtful instead
of being deadly. But the fact still remains.
When you
rose in the morning, that air was not fit for a human creature
to breathe.

When you rise to-morrow morning, just go out of doors
for five minutes, and observe carefully the freshness of the
air. That air is in the state in which God keeps it for
breathing. Then come back suddenly into your close room,
and your own senses will at once make you feel how very
far the air of your chamber is from being in the same
wholesome and serviceable condition.

This is one way, then, in which people produce derangement
in their bodies, and cause their works, or organs, to
get choked up and clogged. They are not careful always to
keep fresh air immediately around them. They suffocate
themselves slowly; taking, perhaps, a long time to complete
their task, but, nevertheless, accomplishing it none
the less surely. Individuals who dwell in crowded towns,
and, therefore, have to live by day as well as by night in
close, impure apartments, go down to their graves, even before
they have reached their prime; and their thin pale
faces, dull sunk eyes, and languid movements, tell they are
doing so, with painful clearness. It is well known that
people who dwell in towns and work in close rooms, as a
rule, die seventeen years earlier than men who dwell in the
country, and work in the fields by day.

Country folks escape this severe penalty, because even
when they half smother themselves by night, the thoroughly
fresh air in which they spend the day goes a great
way toward the removal of the mischief. Still they are by
no means free from all penalty. You yourself have suffered
from breathing bad air. Do you remember last autumn,
when I came to see you sick in bed with the fever? Do you
recollect how your limbs ached, and your skin burned then,
and how you tossed restlessly from side to side, without
being able to sleep, your mouth and tongue being brown
and parched with dryness which water could not moisten?
You could not raise your head from the pillow; and once
when I asked you how you felt, you answered me by telling
me something about the corn stacks and the last harvest,
being quite unconscious of what you were saying.
What do you think was the matter with you then? Your
body and blood were full of poisonous vapor. And what do
you think had made them so? Why, fresh air had not
done its work of purification as it ought. You had been
breathing a great deal of impure air, and were paying the
penalty for having done so. If you had seen the prisoners
in the Black Hole of Calcutta an hour or two before they
died, you would have found them exactly in the same state.

The term âfeverâ is taken from a Latin word which signifies
âto burn.â The skin and the body feel burning hot
in fever, because impure poisonous blood is flowing everywhere
through their vessels, in the place of pure blood, and
the blood is poisonous because it has not been freed from its
poison-vapors as fast as they have been bred in, or thrown
into its streams. In the worst forms of fever the blood gets
so impure that it steams out, through the breath, vapors
[450]

which are able to produce the same kind of disease in other
people, and which are, under these circumstances, termed

infection
. The infectious poison-vapors of fever get so strong
when they are received into close rooms, and are not allowed
to be blown away, that they often kill persons who breathe
them in that state, very quickly.

But you want me to explain how all the mischief, which
results from breathing foul air, may be prevented. Come
down with me into the garden, and creatures that you believe
to be of far inferior powers to yourself, shall give you
a lesson.

You keep bees. Here is a hive, I see, crowded with the
busy insects. By the numbers that I observe clustering
about the low arched door, and bustling out and in so incessantly,
I learn that the industrious little fellows must be
very closely packed together in their straw house. There
must be many thousands of them dwelling together in a
place that can not, at the most, equal more than a couple of
square feet; and there is not a single window in the straw
wall; no opening of any kind but the low, and half-choked
entrance. Really, if those bees need to breathe, you who
have furnished them with their dwelling must be nearly as
bad as the cruel nabob, who shut up his prisoners in the
Indian Black Hole!

Those bees certainly do need to breathe every bit as much
as men and women; and what is more, they manage to
breathe ten times better than you do at night. Notwithstanding
all the crowding there is within their close dwelling,
the air never gets there into the poisonous state in
which the air of your sleeping room is by the morning. The
bees take care that it shall not do so. Just bend down your
ear and listen near the hive for a minute. Do you hear that
incessant low humming? That is the bees hard at work,
making an artificial wind. It is the sound of a couple of
score of broad, stiff fans, flapping to and fro with great
rapidity. Look, I drop this piece of light thistle-down near
the door of the hive, and you see it is at once blown away
from it by a steady draught. If you could see through the
straw walls, you would notice twenty little sturdy fellows
holding on to the floor of the hive with their feet, just within
the door, and flapping their wings backwards and forwards
without a momentâs pause. Now and then one or two
tired insects drop out from the line of the fanners, but their
places are immediately filled by fresh recruits, who lay hold
of the floor and fall vigorously to work with their wings.
This is the appointed band of air-purifiers, plying their business
for the good of the entire community, and wafting a
fresh breeze continuously through the hive. The bees take
it by turns to carry on this necessary labor, and some of
them are always at it. The humming caused by the rapid
vibrations of their fans, scarcely ever ceases. It has been
ascertained that air taken from the inside of a hive, is quite
as pure as the fresh air that floats in the open space around;
so perfectly do these little earnest workmen perform their
purifying task.

The industrious bees, then, are an example to mankind.
If people dwell in close rooms, they must cause an artificial
breeze of fresh air to blow through them. Having shut out
the great wind, that it may not chill too much by its uncontrollable
currents, they must introduce such a little wind as
they can keep thoroughly under control, but which nevertheless
is sufficient to perform the office of purification as
far as it is required. This process of causing an artificial
wind to blow through the inside of a dwelling is called

ventilation
, from a Latin word which signifies âto blowâ or
fan with the wind.

In very hot climates where dwellings need to be ventilated
for the sake of coolness, as well as for purification, men
follow precisely the example set by the bees. They hang up
broad and stiff canvas fans, which they call
punkas
, near
the ceiling, and cause these to flap backwards and forwards
constantly, by pulling them to and fro with ropes. In more
temperate climates, it is rarely found necessary to take all
this trouble, for the air readily makes currents of its own
accord inside of rooms, if only allowed to do so. All that
is necessary is the furnishing of a free passage into the
room, and a free passage out, and it will then make a clear
march through. One opening will not do, when fans are
not kept going, because then the entering and departing air
would meet face to face and obstruct each other. There
must be âinâ and âoutâ doors, just as one sees in much frequented
offices and banks, in great towns.

A very effectual plan for securing the ventilation of a
dwelling room consists in carrying a pipe of perforated zinc
across the house, from outside wall to outside wall, just beneath
the ceiling, allowing the ends to pass through the
walls quite into the open air; then whichever end of the
pipe chances to be most towards the quarter of the heavens
from which the wind is blowing, should be closed with a
plug, a free passage being left for the escape of the heated
air through the opposite end. A number of holes should
also be made through the door, near its bottom, until altogether
they afford as much room to passing air as the inside
bore of the zinc pipe. If you cannot manage to fix such a
zinc pipe across the ceiling, why take out one or two of the
panes of the window, and put into their place, plates of
what is called
perforated zinc
(zinc plates pierced full of
holes), such as you may buy for a trifle at any ironmongers.
That is the next best thing you can do.

As soon as some arrangement of this kind has been completed,
you will find that the air begins to move gently
through the room, cold fresh air coming in through the holes
in the door, and warm impure air being pressed out before it
through the perforated zinc tubes or plates. This takes
place partly because the external wind rushes, in its hasty
way, against the openings through which the air is intended
to enter, and forces itself in; but also, and more particularly,
because the inside air gets warmer than the outside,
and is then compelled to shift its quarters on that account.

The air contained inside of inhabited rooms gets warmed
by the bodies and breaths of the persons living there. Then
it is lighter, bulk for bulk, than the colder air outside, for
warmth stretches and lightens everything. But as heavy
things fall or press down to the earth more strongly than
light ones, the cold air always squeezes into the room
through the lower openings, and pushes the warm impure
air out before it, through the upper ones.

When you light a fire in your room during cold weather,
it makes a quick and strong draught through the room, for
the same reason. Fires, indeed, are among the most powerful
ventilators that can be brought into play. Let your
fire out, and go on sitting in the room with two or three of
your neighbors, and you will find the air of the room will
be close and foul in half-an-hour, although it was quite fresh
before. While the fire is burning, the chimney takes upon
itself the office of the holes in the zinc tube or zinc plate
fixed in the window, and the heated air of the room is
pushed up through it by the fresh cold air which rushes in
through all other openings and crevices. It is only in
rooms where no fires are burningâas for instance, in your
sleeping roomâthat holes through the walls and windows
can serve as outlets for impure air.

But if you live with several companions, in small rooms,
as some workpeople are compelled to do by their occupation,
those rooms cannot get properly ventilated, even although
fires are burning. Some of the poison-vapors, poured
out from your living bodies with the breath, are so light
that they are at once driven up to the top of the room, and
collect there gradually, spreading lower and lower as they
become more abundant. They can not get out through holes
[451]

made in the walls or windows because, as we have seen, the
fire causes streams of cold air to press in there.

A plan has been contrived, however, to ensure perfect
ventilation even in small and crowded rooms, provided fires
be burning. This plan consists in making an opening into
the inside of the chimney, near to the ceiling, and fixing a
balanced valve in it in such a way that the valve-plate is
opened by outward draughts, but immediately closed by inward
ones. Then the impure vapors lurking near the ceiling
are continually being swept away, into the current of
the chimney, through this valve.

You are sure you have no money to spare to buy valves,
and zinc tubes and plates, or to pay to workmen for making
holes in your walls, and in your doors and windows. I admit
that properly these trifling things should be done at the
expense of the landlord to whom the house belongs. It
should be as much his duty to make a house fit to live in,
so far as due ventilation is concerned, as it is to keep it dry
by covering it with a roof of tiles or slate. As landlords,
however, are commonly themselves ignorant about these
matters, you must learn to look to the affair for yourself. You
will be the sufferer if the right thing be not done, therefore
it is alike your interest and your duty to see that it is done.

Suppose then that you have a hard landlord who will
do nothing for you, and that you are so poor you can not
spare a shilling or two for the purchase of metal tubes or
plates. Then I will tell you what I would do, if I were in
your shoes. I would borrow a large gimlet of the carpenter,
and I would bore a row of holes through the upper part of
the window frame in my bedroom, just above the glass, sloping
them downwards a little, so that the rain may not be
able to run in; next I would never quite shut the door of
the chamber, and I would bore other holes through the
frames of the windows down stairs, to act as channels of inlet.
A few rough pegs of wood would serve to close some of
the holes, if at any time too much air entered the room in
consequence of a strong wind blowing outside. This is what
I would do, rather than I would submit to be poisoned at
night because I was poor.

A single round hole, a little more than half an inch across,
would allow as much air to pass through it, as would be
sufficient to supply the breathing of one person, provided
the air were driven along by the movements of a fan, or by
other mechanical contrivance, with the force of a very gentle
breeze. Generally, however, it does not move so fast as
this through rooms, when only caused to do so by the
greater pressure of external colder air. It is, therefore, better
that the ventilating openings, both for inlet and departure,
should altogether make up much more than a hole
half an inch across.

It is not possible to have too much fresh air in a room,
provided only an uncomfortable and chilling draught is not
allowed to blow upon the body of the inhabitant. You may
easily prevent any discomfort or mischief from draught,
even where a great abundance of air is admitted, by hanging
a curtain to catch it and turn it aside. You will find,
however, that there is very little chance of any troublesome
draught when no fire is burning in the room, to make the
air rush in with increased power, for it is fires, as you will
remember, which cause quick and strong currents.

The warmer and stiller the external air is, the more difficult
it becomes to secure free ventilation through the inside
of rooms. In the calm hot nights of summer, the
windows of sleeping rooms should on this account be left
partly open all night long. It is better to breathe air moistened
with night dew than it is to breathe air laden with
poison vapors.

But if it be important when people are well that they
shall have an abundance of fresh air moving through their
dwellings, it is of far greater consequence that there shall
be a thorough ventilation kept up in rooms where there is
sickness. In all kinds of fevers the blood is overloaded
with poison vapors, and these can not get out of the body
unless they are blown away by pure air. The sick person
can not be freed from the poison vapors that are clogging up
his vital organs until fresh air is supplied abundantly. Do
you remember what it was that first made you better, when
you had the fever last year? Can you not recall to mind
how all the doors and windows of your room were kept
constantly open, and how angry I was whenever I came to
your chamber and found them fast closed! Have you forgotten
how delicious the fresh air felt to your parched and
poisoned frame, and what luxury there was in the clean
linen when supplied to your body and to the bed, and in the
cold water when it was sponged over your skin?

If ever you are called upon to attend a neighbor or a relation
who has to suffer from infectious fever, as you then
did, be sure you furnish to that sick person the same comfort
and alleviation which were provided for yourself.

Let this be your plan for nursing the sick: Open wide
the doors and windows of your chamber. Keep the body of
the patient and the room very clean. Change the linen both
of the person and the bed very often. Allow only the very
simplest kinds of food and drink to be given, and that in
small quantities at a time. Prevent all noise and confusion
around the bed. There are very few persons indeed who
will not recover speedily from attacks of even the worst
kinds of fever, if this simple and prudent plan of treatment
is steadily pursued.

The poison-vapors of fever and other infectious diseases
are very deadly when in their greatest strength, but remain
so for a very short time when left to the influences and operations
of nature. They can not bear the presence of fresh
air. If they are mixed with a great abundance of it as they
come out of the mouths of sick people, they directly cease
to be dangerous poisons. All that is necessary to prevent
infectious fevers from being communicated from person to
person, by means of the breath, is to take care that fresh air
is continually passing through the sick room. Attendants
and visitors may remain with perfect safety in rooms where
even the worst kinds of fever are prevailing, if they keep all
the doors and windows of the chamber open, and are careful
not to catch the breath of the patients until it has passed
through some two yards of space, where there is perfectly
pure air.

Such, then, is the âworth of fresh air.â It keeps the body
healthy and strong. It blows away and destroys the invisible
and dangerous poisons which are steamed forth from
putrid and decaying matters, and which are to the delicate
organs of the living frame much worse than dust and dirt are
to clock-work. In disease it is natureâs chief remedy; the best
medicine of the best Physician, furnished gratis, because
he is full of bounty, as well as of great skill. Never let it
any longer be a reproach to you, that you ungraciously turn
away such a precious gift and priceless boon from your doors.
Rather open wide your windows, as well as your doors, and
welcome it with all your heart. Go to the bee, consider its
ways, and be wise!

Flattering pleasures, fountain of delights, fertile in miseries,
what do you wish with me? Shameful lusts of the flesh
and of the world, why do you not quit me when I have
quitted you? Begone honors, pleasures, which war against
me; all your happiness, subject to change, falls to the ground
in a moment of time; and as it has the brilliancy of glass,
it has also its brittleness.â
Corneille.

But pleasures are like poppies spread,

You seize the flower, its bloom is shed;

Or, like the snow-fall in the river,

A moment white, then melts forever.â
Burns.

STREET MANNERS.

The knowledge of being able to do exactly what is done in
good society puts its possessor entirely at ease in whatever
sphere he may happen to move. Tact and innate refinement
do much to assist one unused to society, but do not
suffice; a thorough acquaintance with the social observances
in force is necessary. If the etiquette of walking and
driving contains few rules, they are none the less important;
indeed we are very prone to form our opinions of the breeding
of persons by their bearing and manners on the street.
One of the first rules for everyone in walking is quietness.
Loud talking and laughing are never less in good form than
on the street. When and where to walk must be decided
by the customs of the locality where one lives. In general
it may be said that ladies should not walk unattended after
nightfall in city or village, and it is not considered good
taste for a lady to appear alone, in daylight, in crowded
thoroughfares, fashionable promenades, or in parks and
other public resorts. In short, a public place is no place for
a lady if unaccompanied.

As regards the recognition of friends and acquaintances,
it is the privilege of a lady to take the initiative by being
the first to bow; a gentleman would not, as a rule, raise his
hat to a lady until she had accorded him this mark of recognition,
although the act of bowing is a simultaneous action
on the part of both lady and gentleman, as a lady would
hardly bestow a bow on a gentleman not prepared to return
it. It has lately become the fashion for ladies to nod rather
than bow to their male acquaintances; making a short decisive
movement of the head only, instead of bending the
neck. The nod is not in such good taste as the bow. To
bow well, cordially, yet with dignity, kindly yet quietly, is
a real accomplishment. Some one says, âThe salutation is
the touchstone of good breeding.â The bow which is perfect
in welcome, and bears just enough dignity and just
enough ease, is certainly effective. It is a compliment to
you. You feel happy at meeting the person so accomplished.

A not uncommon rudeness is the failing to speak to people
whom one has met, because they are lower in social position
or, perhaps, working people. It is well, then, for us to remember
the example of George Washington and George IV.,
who took off their hats to their servants. Bow to everyone
whom you know, is the rule.

A gentleman returning the bow of a lady with whom he
is but slightly acquainted, would do so with a deferential
air, but slightly raising his hat from his head; but if he
were an intimate acquaintance or friend, he would raise his
hat with far more freedom of action, thus consequently
raising his hat considerably higher; for a gentleman to bow
otherwise would appear too distant. In France and on the
Continent, the rule of bowing is reversed, and the gentleman
is the first to bow to the lady.

Between ladies but slightly acquainted, the lady of the
higher rank would bow first.

Gentlemen do not raise their hats in recognition of each
other, but simply nod. When a gentleman meets an acquaintance
walking with ladies, he would then, in compliment
to the ladies, raise his hat to his friend instead of
simply nodding. Introductions on the street are not imperative,
but rather a matter of inclination. For instance: a
lady walking with a friend whom she was visiting, would
introduce any person whom she might happen to meet, to her
hostess; and her hostess would do likewise to her guest, unless
there should be some reason for not making the introductionâif
so, explanations could be offered afterward.

In public promenades and watering places it is usual for
gentlemen to join ladies with whom they are acquainted,
and walk with them. If a lady stop a gentleman on the
street he should turn and walk with her. In no case should
they stand for any length of time. An important point, not
always observed, is keeping to the right hand of the passer.
It is never allowable to take the left unless a gentleman be
guiding a lady through a crowd, when, to save her from being
jostled, he may turn to the left, but under ordinary circumstances
this is not âgood form.â

Ladies and gentlemen, whether related or not, never walk
arm in arm in promenades or public places unless the lady
be an elderly one, or require support. In driving in an
open or close carriage, no particular place is reserved for
the owner of the carriage. When accompanied by friends,
guests always enter the carriage before the host or hostess.
Were there two guests, and one of them a young lady, she
would naturally seat herself with her back to the horses,
leaving the other seat for the married ladies. This, however,
is a matter of courtesy on her part. A gentleman takes
the forward seat, if two ladies are present, and a gentleman
should dismount first with a view of assisting the ladies out.
As a rule the hostess should descend after her guest and not
before her; if necessary to do so, she should make some polite
remark in excuse. If a lady were merely calling on an
acquaintance to take her for a drive she would not descend
from her carriage for the purpose of allowing her to enter it
before her.

These are the rules, but rules of etiquette, unless seasoned
with common sense, are dangerously stiff and unbecoming.
It is wrong to suppose that they form the basis of good
manners. Principles, not rules, do that, and the principles
of high breeding may be reduced to two: consideration for
othersâ feelings, and familiarity with the fitness and beauty
of things.

SATISFIED.

By J. C. A.

Day of softest, fairest beauty,

Summerâs breath oâer land and sea,

While the sunshineâs golden quiver,

Falls on hill, and wood, and river,

Far as the eye can see,

Every wandering breeze comes laden

With the scent of dewy flowers,

And all Natureâs heart rejoices,

With her sweet and heaven-taught voices,

Throughout the glowing hours.

In this grey old world not often

Such a day to us is sent,

Yet amidst its purest gladness

Comes a thrill of yearning sadness

To mar our sweet content.

And when lifeâs full cup oâerflowing

With the love which makes our gain,

And the rapture surely given

As a foretaste of Godâs heaven,â

âTis bliss akin to pain.

So in hours of love and sunshine,

As in days when storms beat high,

We have still a sure voice teaching,

Far beyond earthâs wisest preaching,

Our immortality.

Not until we reach that city

Where our loved and lost abide,

When Christ greets us at the portal,

And we taste the life immortal,

We shall be satisfied.

TALES FROM SHAKSPERE.

By CHARLES LAMB.

AS YOU LIKE IT.

During the time that France was divided into provinces
(or dukedoms, as they were called), there reigned in one of
these provinces an usurper, who had deposed and banished
his elder brother, the lawful duke.

The duke, who was thus driven from his dominions, retired
with a few faithful followers to the forest of Arden;
and here the good duke lived with his loving friends, who
had put themselves into a voluntary exile for his sake, while
their lands and revenues enriched the false usurper. And
custom soon made the life of careless ease they led here more
sweet to them than the pomp and uneasy splendor of a courtierâs
life. Here they lived like the old Robin Hood of England,
and to this forest many noble youths daily resorted
from the court, and did fleet the time carelessly, as they did
who lived in the golden age. In the summer they lay along
under the fine shade of the large forest trees, marking the
playful sports of the wild deer; and so fond were they of
these poor dappled fools, who seemed to be the native inhabitants
of the forest, that it grieved them to be forced to
kill them to supply themselves with venison for their food.
When the cold winds of winter made the duke feel the change
of his adverse fortune, he would endure it patiently, and
say, âThese chilling winds which blow upon my body, are
true counselors; they do not flatter, but represent truly to
me my condition; and though they bite sharply, their tooth
is nothing like so keen as that of unkindness and ingratitude.
I find that, however men speak against adversity,
yet some sweet uses are to be extracted from it, like the
jewel, precious for medicine, which is taken from the head
of the venomous and despised toad.â In this manner did
the patient duke draw an useful moral from everything that
he saw; and by the help of this moralizing turn in that life
of his, remote from public haunts, he could find tongues in
trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and
good in everything.

The banished duke had an only daughter, named Rosalind,
whom the usurper, Duke Frederick, when he banished
her father, still retained in his court as a companion for his
own daughter Celia. A strict friendship subsisted between
these ladies, which the disagreement between their fathers
did not in the least interrupt, Celia striving by every kindness
in her power to make amends to Rosalind for the injustice
of her own father in deposing the father of Rosalind;
and whenever the thoughts of her fatherâs banishment, and
her own dependence on the false usurper, made Rosalind
melancholy, Celiaâs whole care was to comfort and console
her.

One day when Celia was talking in her usual kind manner
to Rosalind, saying, âI pray you, Rosalind, my sweet cousin,
be merry,â a messenger entered from the duke, to tell them
that if they wished to see a wrestling match, which was just
going to begin, they must come instantly to the court before
the palace; and Celia, thinking it would amuse Rosalind,
agreed to go and see it. In those times wrestling was a favorite
sport even in the courts of princes, and before fair
ladies and princesses. To this wrestling match therefore
Celia and Rosalind went. They found that it was likely to
prove a very tragical sight; for a large and powerful man
who had long been practiced in the art of wrestling, and had
slain many men in contests of this kind, was just going to
wrestle with a very young man, who, from his extreme
youth and inexperience in the art, the beholders all thought
would certainly be killed.

When the duke saw Celia and Rosalind, he said, âHow
now, daughter and niece, are you crept hither to see the
wrestling? You will take little delight in it, there is such
odds in the men. In pity to this young man, I would wish
to persuade him from wrestling. Speak to him, ladies, and
see if you can move him.â The ladies were well pleased to
perform this humane office, and first Celia entreated the
young stranger that he would desist from the attempt; and
then Rosalind spoke so kindly to him, and with such feeling
consideration for the danger he was about to undergo,
that instead of being persuaded by her gentle words to
forego his purpose, all his thoughts were bent to distinguish
himself by his courage in this lovely ladyâs eyes. He refused
the request of Celia and Rosalind in such graceful and modest
words, that they felt still more concern for him; he concluding
his refusal with saying, âI am sorry to deny such
fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes
and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein, if I be
conquered, there is one shamed that was never gracious; if
I am killed, there is one dead who is willing to die. I shall
do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the
world no injury, for in it I have nothing; for I only fill up
a place in the world which may be better supplied when I
have made it empty.â

And now the wrestling match began. Celia wished the
young stranger might not be hurt; but Rosalind felt the
most for him. The friendless state that he said he was in,
and that he wished to die, made Rosalind think that he was,
like herself, unfortunate; and she pitied him so much, and
so deep an interest she took in his danger while he was
wrestling, that she might almost be said at that moment to
have fallen in love with him. The kindness shown this
unknown youth by these fair and noble ladies gave him
courage and strength, so that he performed wonders; and in
the end completely conquered his antagonist, who was so
much hurt, that for a while he was unable to speak or move.

The duke Frederick was much pleased with the courage
and skill shown by the young stranger; and desired to know
his name and parentage, meaning to take him under his
protection. The stranger said his name was Orlando, and
that he was the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. Sir
Roland de Boys, the father of Orlando, had been dead some
years; but, when he was living, he had been a true subject
and a dear friend of the banished duke: therefore when
Frederick heard Orlando was the son of his banished brotherâs
friend, all his liking for this brave young man changed
into displeasure, and he left the place in very ill humor.
Hating to hear the very name of any of his brotherâs friends,
and yet still admiring the valor of the youth, he said, as he
went out, that he wished Orlando had been the son of any
other man.

Rosalind was delighted to hear that her new favorite was
the son of her fatherâs old friend; and she said to Celia,
âMy father loved Sir Rowland de Boys, and if I had known
this young man was his son, I would have added tears to
my entreaties before he should have ventured.â The ladies
then went up to him, and seeing him abashed by the sudden
displeasure shown by the duke, they spoke kind and encouraging
words to him, and Rosalind, when they were
going away, turned back to speak some more civil things to
the brave young son of her fatherâs old friend; and taking
a chain off her neck, she said, âGentleman, wear this for
me. I am out of suits with fortune, or I would give you a
more valuable present.â When the ladies were alone, Rosalindâs
talk being still of Orlando, Celia began to perceive her
cousin had fallen in love with the handsome young wrestler,
and she said to Rosalind, âIs it possible you should
fall in love so suddenly?â Rosalind replied, âThe duke,
my father, loved his father dearly.â âBut,â said Celia,
âdoes it therefore follow that you should love his son dearly?
for then I ought to hate him, for my father hated his father;
yet I do not hate Orlando.â
[454]

Frederick being enraged at the sight of Sir Rowland de
Boysâ son, which reminded him of the many friends the
banished duke had among the nobility, and having been for
some time displeased with his niece, because the people
praised her for her virtues, and pitied her for her good fatherâs
sake, his malice suddenly broke out against her; and
while Celia and Rosalind were talking of Orlando, Frederick
entered the room, and with looks full of anger ordered
Rosalind instantly to leave the palace, and follow her father
into banishment; telling Celia, who in vain pleaded for her,
that he had only suffered Rosalind to stay upon her account.
âI did not then,â said Celia, âentreat you to let her stay, for
I was too young at that time to value her; but now that I
know her worth, and that we so long have slept together,
rose at the same instant, learned, played, and eat together,
I can not live out of her company.â Frederick replied,
âShe is too subtle for you; her smoothness, her very silence
and her patience, speak to the people, and they pity her.
You are a fool to plead for her, for you will seem more bright
and virtuous when she is gone; therefore open not your lips
in her favor, for the doom which I have passed upon her is
irrevocable.â

When Celia found she could not prevail upon her father
to let Rosalind remain with her, she generously resolved to
accompany her; and, leaving her fatherâs palace that night,
she went along with her friend to seek Rosalindâs father, the
banished duke, in the forest of Arden. Before they set out,
Celia considered that it would be unsafe for two young ladies
to travel in the rich clothes they then wore; she therefore
proposed that they should disguise their rank by dressing
themselves like country maids. Rosalind said it would be
a still greater protection if one of them was to be dressed
like a man; and so it was quickly agreed on between them,
that as Rosalind was the tallest, she should wear the dress
of a young countryman, and Celia should be habited like a
country lass, and that they should say they were brother
and sister, and Rosalind said she would be called Ganimed,
and Celia chose the name of Aliena. In this disguise, and
taking their money and jewels to defray their expenses,
these fair princesses set out on their long travel; for the forest
of Arden was a long way off, beyond the boundaries of
the dukeâs dominions.

The lady Rosalind (or Ganimed as she must now be called)
with her manly garb, seemed to have put on a manly courage.
The faithful friendship Celia had shown in accompanying
Rosalind so many weary miles, made the new brother,
in recompense for this true love, exert a cheerful spirit, as
if he were indeed Ganimed, the rustic and stout-hearted
brother of the gentle village maiden, Aliena. When at last
they came to the forest of Arden, they no longer found the
convenient inns and good accommodations they had met
with on the road; and, being in want of food and rest, Ganimed,
who had so merrily cheered his sister with pleasant
speeches and happy remarks all the way, now owned to
Aliena that he was so weary, he could find it in his heart
to disgrace his manâs apparel, and cry like a woman; and
Aliena declared she could go no further; and then again
Ganimed tried to recollect that it was a manâs duty to comfort
and console a woman, as the weaker vessel, and to seem
courageous to his new sister, he said, âCome, have a good
heart, my sister Aliena; we are now at the end of our travel,
in the forest of Arden.â But feigned manliness and forced
courage would no longer support them; for though they
were in the forest of Arden, they knew not where to find
the duke; and here the travel of these weary ladies might
have come to a sad conclusion, for they might have lost
themselves, and have perished for want of food; but, providentially,
as they were sitting on the grass, almost dying
of fatigue and hopeless of any relief, a countryman chanced
to pass that way, and Ganimed once more tried to speak
with a manly boldness, saying, âShepherd, if love of gold
in this desert place procure us entertainment, I pray you
bring us where we may rest ourselves; for this young maid,
my sister, is much fatigued with travelling, and faints for
want of food.â

The man replied that he was only a servant to a shepherd,
and that his masterâs house was just going to be sold,
and therefore they would find but poor entertainment; but
that if they would go with him, they should be welcome to
what there was. They followed the man, the near prospect
of relief giving them fresh strength; and bought the house
and sheep of the shepherd, and took the man who conducted
them to the shepherdâs house, to wait on them; and
being by this means so fortunately provided with a neat
cottage, and well supplied with provisions, they agreed to
stay here till they could learn in what part of the forest the
duke dwelt. When they were rested after the fatigue of
their journey, they began to like their new way of life, and
almost fancied themselves the shepherd and shepherdess
they feigned to be; yet sometimes Ganimed remembered he
had once been the same lady Rosalind who had so dearly
loved the brave Orlando, because he was the son of old Sir
Rowland, her fatherâs friend; and though Ganimed thought
that Orlando was many miles distant, even so many weary
miles as they had traveled, yet it soon appeared that Orlando
was also in the forest of Arden; and in this manner
this strange event came to pass.

Orlando was the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,
who, when he died left him (Orlando being then very young)
to the care of his eldest brother, Oliver, charging Oliver on
his blessing to give his brother a good education, and provide
for him as became the dignity of their ancient house.
Oliver proved an unworthy brother; and disregarding the
commands of his dying father, he never put his brother to
school, but kept him untaught and entirely neglected. But
in his nature and in the noble qualities of his mind Orlando
so much resembled his excellent father, that without any
advantages of education he seemed like a youth who had
been bred with the utmost care; and Oliver so envied the
fine person and dignified manners of his untutored brother,
that at last he wished to destroy him; and to effect this he
set on people to persuade him to wrestle with the famous
wrestler, who, as has been before related, had killed so many
men. Now it was this cruel brotherâs neglect of him which
made Orlando say he wished to die, being so friendless.

When, contrary to the wicked hopes he had formed, his
brother proved victorious, his envy and malice knew no
bounds, and he swore he would burn the chamber where
Orlando slept. He was overheard making this vow by one
that had been an old and faithful servant to their father,
and that loved Orlando because he resembled Sir Rowland.
This old man went out to meet him when he returned from
the Dukeâs palace, and when he saw Orlando, the peril his
dear young master was in made him break out with these
passionate exclamations: âO gentle master, my sweet master,
O you memory of old Sir Rowland! why are you virtuous?
why are you gentle, strong and valiant? and why
would you be so fond to overcome the famous wrestler?
Your praise has come too swiftly home before you.â Orlando,
wondering what all this meant, asked him what was
the matter? and then the old man told him how his wicked
brother, envying the love all people bore him, and now
hearing the fame he had gained by his victory in the dukeâs
palace, intended to destroy him, by setting fire to his chamber
that night; and in conclusion, advised him to escape
the danger he was in by instant flight: and knowing Orlando
had no money, Adam (for that was the good old manâs
name) had brought out with him his own little hoard, and
he said, âI have five hundred crowns, the thrifty hire I
saved under your father, and laid by to be provision for me
[455]

when my old limbs should become unfit for service; take
that, and he that doth the ravens feed be comfort to my age!
Here is the gold; all this I give to you: let me be your servant:
though I look old, I will do the service of a younger
man in all your business and necessities.â âO good old
man!â said Orlando, âhow well appears in you the constant
service of the old world? You are not for the fashion of
these times. We will go along together, and before your
youthful wages are spent, I shall light upon some means for
both our maintenance.â

Together then this faithful servant and his loved master
set out, and Orlando and Adam traveled on, uncertain what
course to pursue, till they came to the forest of Arden, and
there they found themselves in the same distress for want
of food that Ganimed and Aliena had been. They wandered
on, seeking some human habitation, till they were almost
spent with hunger and fatigue. Adam at last said, âO my
dear master, I die for want of food; I can go no farther!â
He then laid himself down, thinking to make that place his
grave, and bade his dear master farewell. Orlando, seeing
him in this weak state, took his old servant up in his arms,
and carried him under the shelter of some pleasant trees;
and he said to him, âCheerily, old Adam, rest your weary
limbs here awhile, and do not talk of dying.â Orlando then
searched about to find some food, and he happened to arrive
at that part of the forest where the duke was; and he and
his friends were just going to eat their dinner, this royal
duke being seated on the grass, under no other canopy than
the shady covert of some large trees. Orlando, whom hunger
had made desperate, drew his sword, intending to take
meat by force, and said, âForbear, and eat no more; I must
have your food!â The duke asked him if distress had made
him so bold, or if he were a rude despiser of good manners?
On this Orlando said he was dying with hunger: and then
the duke told him he was welcome to sit down and eat with
them. Orlando hearing him speak so gently, put up his
sword, and blushed with shame at the rude manner in
which he had demanded their food. âPardon me, I pray
you,â said he; âI thought that all things had been savage
here, and therefore I put on the countenance of stern command;
but whatever men you are, that in this desert, under
the shade of melancholy boughs, lose and neglect the creeping
hours of time; if ever you have looked on better days;
if ever you have been where bells have knolled to church;
if you have ever sat at any good manâs feast; if ever from
your eyelids you have wiped a tear, and know what it is to
pity or be pitied, may gentle speeches now move you to do
me human courtesy!â The duke replied, âTrue it is that
we are men (as you say) who have seen better days, and
though we have now our habitation in this wild forest, we
have lived in towns and cities, and have with holy bell been
knolled to church, have sat at good menâs feasts, and from
our eyes we have wiped the drops which sacred pity has engendered:
therefore sit you down, and take of our refreshment
as much as will minister to your wants.â âThere is
an old poor man,â answered Orlando, âwho has limped after
me many a weary step in pure love, oppressed at once with
two sad infirmities, age and hunger; till he be satisfied, I
must not touch a bit.â âGo, find him out, and bring him
hither,â said the duke; âwe will forbear to eat till you return.â
Then Orlando went like a doe to find its fawn and
give it food; and presently returned, bringing Adam in his
arms; and the duke said: âSet down your venerable burthen;
you are both welcome:â and they fed the old man,
and cheered his heart, and he revived, and recovered his
health and strength again.

The duke inquired who Orlando was, and when he found
that he was the son of his old friend, Sir Rowland de Boys,
he took him under his protection, and Orlando and his old
servant lived with the duke in the forest. Orlando arrived
in the forest not many days after Ganimed and Aliena came
there, and (as has been before related) bought the shepherdâs
cottage. Ganimed and Aliena were strangely surprised to
find the name of Rosalind carved on the trees, and love
sonnets fastened to them, all addressed to Rosalind; and
while they were wondering how this could be, they met Orlando,
and they perceived the chain which Rosalind had
given him about his neck.

Orlando little thought that Ganimed was the fair princess
Rosalind, who by her noble condescension and favor had so
won his heart that he passed his whole time in carving her
name upon the trees, and writing sonnets in praise of her
beauty; but being much pleased with the graceful air of
this pretty shepherd youth, he entered into conversation
with him, and he thought he saw a likeness in Ganimed to
his beloved Rosalind, but that he had none of the dignified
deportment of that noble lady; for Ganimed assumed the
forward manners often seen in youths when they are between
boys and men, and with much archness and humor talked
to Orlando of a certain lover, âwho,â said he, âhaunts our
forest, and spoils our young trees with carving Rosalind
upon their barks; and he hangs odes upon hawthorns, and
elegies upon brambles, all praising this same Rosalind. If
I could find this lover, I would give him some good counsel
that would soon cure him of his love.â

Orlando confessed that he was the fond lover of whom he
spoke, and asked Ganimed to give him the good counsel he
talked of. The remedy Ganimed proposed, and the counsel
he gave him, was that Orlando should come every day to the
cottage where he and his sister Aliena dwelt. âAnd then,â
said Ganimed, âI will feign myself to be Rosalind, and you
shall feign to court me in the same manner as you would do
if I was Rosalind, and then I will imitate the fantastic ways
of whimsical ladies to their lovers, till I make you ashamed
of your love; and this is the way I propose to cure you.â
Orlando had no great faith in the remedy, yet he agreed to
come every day to Ganimedâs cottage and feign a playful
courtship; and every day Orlando visited Ganimed and
Aliena, and Orlando called the shepherd Ganimed his Rosalind,
and every day talked over all the fine words and flattering
compliments which young men delight to use when
they court. It does not appear, however, that Ganimed
made any progress in curing Orlando of his love for Rosalind.
Though Orlando thought all this was but a sportive
play (not dreaming that Ganimed was his very Rosalind),
yet the opportunity it gave him of saying all the fond things
he had in his heart, pleased his fancy almost as well as it
did Ganimedâs, who enjoyed the secret jest in knowing these
fine love speeches were all addressed to the right person.

In this manner many days passed pleasantly on with these
young people; and the good-natured Aliena seeing it made
Ganimed happy, let him have his own way, and was diverted
at the mock courtship, and did not care to remind
Ganimed that the lady Rosalind had not yet made herself
known to the duke, her father, whose place of resort in the
forest they had learnt from Orlando. Ganimed met the
duke one day, and had some talk with him, and the duke
asked of what parentage he came; Ganimed answered that
he came of as good parentage as he did: which made the
duke smile, for he did not suspect the pretty shepherd boy
came of royal lineage. Then seeing the duke look well and
happy, Ganimed was content to put off all further explanation
for a few days longer.

One morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganimed, he
saw a man lying asleep on the ground, and a large green
snake had twisted itself about his neck. The snake, seeing
Orlando approach, glided away among the bushes. Orlando
went nearer, and then he discovered a lioness lie couching,
with her head on the ground, with a cat-like watch, waiting
till the sleeping man awaked (for it is said that lions will
[456]

prey on nothing that is dead or sleeping). It seemed as if
Orlando was sent by Providence to free the man from the
danger of the snake and lioness: but when Orlando looked
in the manâs face, he perceived that the sleeper, who was
exposed to this double peril, was his own brother Oliver,
who had so cruelly used him, and had threatened to destroy
him by fire; and he was almost tempted to leave him a prey
to the hungry lioness: but brotherly affection and the gentleness
of his nature soon overcame his first anger against
his brother; and he drew his sword, and attacked the lioness,
and slew her, and thus preserved his brotherâs life both
from the venomous snake and from the furious lioness; but
before Orlando could conquer the lioness, she had torn one
of his arms with her sharp claws.

While Orlando was engaged with the lioness, Oliver
awaked, and perceiving that his brother Orlando, whom he
had so cruelly treated, was saving him from the fury of a
wild beast at the risk of his own life, shame and remorse at
once seized him, and he repented of his unworthy conduct,
and besought with many tears his brotherâs pardon for the
injuries he had done him. Orlando rejoiced to see him so
penitent, and readily forgave him; they embraced each
other; and from that hour Oliver loved Orlando with a true
brotherly affection, though he had come to the forest bent
on his destruction.

The wound in Orlandoâs arm having bled very much, he
found himself too weak to go to visit Ganimed, and therefore
he desired his brother to go, and tell Ganimed, âwhom,â
said Orlando, âI in sport do call my Rosalind,â the accident
which had befallen him. Thither then Oliver went, and
told to Ganimed and Aliena how Orlando had saved his life;
and when he had finished the story of Orlandoâs bravery,
and his own providential escape, he owned to them that he
was Orlandoâs brother, who had so cruelly used him; and
then he told them of their reconciliation.

The sincere sorrow that Oliver expressed for his offenses,
made such a lively impression on the kind heart of Aliena,
that she instantly fell in love with him; and Oliver, observing
how much she pitied the distress he told her he felt for
his fault, as suddenly fell in love with her. But while
love was thus stealing into the hearts of Aliena and Oliver,
he was no less busy with Ganimed, who hearing of the danger
Orlando had been in, and that he was wounded by the
lioness, fainted; and when he recovered, he pretended that
he had counterfeited the swoon in the imaginary character
of Rosalind, and Ganimed said to Oliver, âTell your brother
Orlando how well I counterfeited a swoon.â But Oliver saw
by the paleness of his complexion that he really did faint,
and much wondering at the weakness of the young man, he
said, âWell, if you did counterfeit, take a good heart, and
counterfeit to be a man.â âSo I do,â replied Ganimed
(truly), âbut I should have been a woman by right.â

Oliver made this visit a very long one, and when at last
he returned back to his brother, he had much news to tell
him, for, besides the account of Ganimedâs fainting at the
hearing that Orlando was wounded, Oliver told him how he
had fallen in love with the fair shepherdess Aliena, and that
she had lent a favorable ear to his suit, even in this their
first interview; and he talked to his brother, as of a thing
almost settled that he should marry Aliena, saying, that he
so well loved her he would live here as a shepherd, and settle
his estate and house at home upon Orlando.

âYou have my consent,â said Orlando. âLet your wedding
be to-morrow, and I will invite the duke and his
friends. Go and persuade your shepherdess to agree to this;
she is now alone; for look, here comes her brother.â Oliver
went to Aliena; and Ganimed, whom Orlando had perceived
approaching, came to inquire after the health of his
wounded friend. When Orlando and Ganimed began to
talk over the sudden love which had taken place between
Oliver and Aliena, Orlando said he had advised his brother
to persuade his fair shepherdess to be married on the morrow,
and then he added how much he could wish to be married
on the same day to his Rosalind. Ganimed, who well
approved of this arrangement, said that if Orlando really
loved Rosalind as well as he professed to do, he should have
his wish; for on the morrow he would engage to make Rosalind
appear in her own person, and also that Rosalind
should be willing to marry Orlando.

This seemingly wonderful event, which, as Ganimed was
the lady Rosalind, he could so easily perform, he pretended
he would bring to pass by the aid of magic, which he said
he had learnt from an uncle who was a famous magician.
The fond lover, Orlando, half believing and half doubting
what he heard, asked Ganimed if he spoke in sober meaning.
âBy my life I do,â said Ganimed; âtherefore put on
your best clothes, and bid the duke and your friends to your
wedding; for, if you desire to be married to-morrow to Rosalind,
she shall be here.â The next morning, Oliver having
obtained the consent of Aliena, they came into the
presence of the duke, and with them also came Orlando.
They being all assembled to celebrate this double marriage,
and as yet only one of the brides appearing, there was much
of wondering and conjecture, but they mostly thought that
Ganimed was making a jest of Orlando.

The duke, hearing that it was his own daughter that was
to be brought in this strange way, asked Orlando if he believed
the shepherd boy could really do what he had promised;
and while Orlando was answering that he knew not
what to think, Ganimed entered, and asked the duke, if he
brought his daughter, whether he would consent to her
marriage with Orlando. âThat I would,â said the duke,
âIf I had kingdoms to give with her.â Ganimed then said
to Orlando, âAnd you say you will marry her if I bring her
here.â âThat I would,â said Orlando, âif I were king of
many kingdoms.â Ganimed and Aliena then went out together,
and Ganimed, throwing off his male attire, and being
once more dressed in womanâs apparel, quickly became
Rosalind, without the power of magic; and Aliena, changing
her country garb for her own rich clothes, was with as
little trouble transformed into the lady Celia.

While they were gone, the duke said to Orlando, that he
thought the shepherd Ganimed, very like his daughter Rosalind;
and Orlando said, he also had observed the resemblance.
They had no time to wonder how all this would
end, for Rosalind and Celia in their own clothes entered;
and no longer pretending that it was by the power of magic
that she came there, Rosalind threw herself on her knees
before her father, and begged his blessing. It seemed so
wonderful to all present that she should so suddenly appear
that it might well have passed for magic; but Rosalind
would no longer trifle with her father, and told him the
story of her banishment, and of her dwelling in the forest
as a shepherd boy, her cousin Celia passing as her sister.

The duke ratified the consent he had already given to the
marriage; and Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia,
were married at the same time. And though their wedding
could not be celebrated in this wild forest with any of the
parade or splendor usual on such occasions, yet a happier
wedding-day was never passed; and while they were eating
their venison under the cool shade of the pleasant trees, as
if nothing should be wanting to complete the felicity of this
good duke and the true lovers, an unexpected messenger
arrived to tell the duke the joyful news, that his dukedom
was restored to him.

The usurper, enraged at the flight of his daughter Celia,
and hearing every day that men of great worth resorted to
the forest of Arden to join the lawful duke in his exile,
much envying that his brother should be so highly respected
in his adversity, put himself at the head of a large force, and
[457]

advanced toward the forest, intending to seize his brother,
and put him, with all his faithful followers, to the sword;
but, by a wonderful interposition of Providence, this bad
brother was converted from his evil intention; for just as
he entered the skirts of the wild forest, he was met by an
old religious man, a hermit, with whom he had much talk,
and who in the end completely turned his heart from his
wicked design. Thenceforward he became a true penitent,
and resolved, (relinquishing his unjust dominion,) to spend
the remainder of his days in a religious house. The first act
of this newly-conceived penitence was to send a messenger
to his brother (as has been related), to offer to restore to him
his dukedom, which he had usurped so long, and with it
the lands and revenues of his friends, the faithful followers
of his adversity.

This joyful news, as unexpected as it was welcome, came
opportunely to heighten the festivity and rejoicings at the
wedding of the princesses. Celia complimented her cousin
on this good fortune which had happened to the duke, Rosalindâs
father, and wished her joy very sincerely, though
she herself was no longer heir to the dukedom, but by this
restoration which her father had made, Rosalind was now
the heir; so completely was the love of these two cousins
unmixed with anything of jealousy or envy.

The duke had now an opportunity of rewarding those true
friends who had stayed with him in his banishment; and
these worthy followers, though they had patiently shared
his adverse fortune, were very well pleased to return in peace
and prosperity to the palace of their lawful duke.

MEMORIAL BELL.

At a Round-Table last August it was suggested that the
class of â82 raise money to buy a bell which should be hung
permanently at Chautauqua. The idea was a good one and
was immediately adopted by the class, Mrs. M. Bailey, of
Jamestown, N. Y., being made treasurer. But the enterprise
is not growing as it deserves. The treasurer informs
us that she has only about $60. This is but a beginning toward
the completion of a project which the class has pledged
itself to carry out. Many of the â82âs have sent enthusiastic
notes with their contributions. We publish a few of these,
trusting that they may arouse others.

âI have been anxious to express in some way
my appreciation of the untold benefits received as a member
of the C. L. S. C., and I am glad to send you the enclosed

âI did hope to see Chautauqua last summer,
but my health did not permit, perhaps may never, yet I am
interested in the place, and very much interested in the literary
and scientific attainments of the great Circle. Enclosed

âMay I express the hope that while the
memorial bell may not be as large as some may desire, it
may be wonderfully sweet.

âAs I am possessed of but little of the âgold

am an enthusiastic Chautauquan, although I have never

the good deeds of the class of â82.

C. L. S. C. WORK.

By J. H. VINCENT, D. D.,
Superintendent of Instruction
, C. L. S. C.

The âChautauqua Universityâ bill has passed both houses
of the New York Legislature and has been signed by Governor
Cleveland. What may grow out of that bill in the
future I can not now say, but the graduates of the C. L. S.
C. are in the outer court of the âChautauqua University.â
The seal will soon be ready, and although our present course
may not entitle the graduates to any âdegree,â graduates
they are of the âC. L. S. C. of the Chautauqua University.â
Beyond these outer courts are other courts, and within these
are halls and temples into which, as the years go by, diligent
students may enter, and there by fidelity and thoroughness
win, in ways which no university faculty can impeach,
the honors that fairly belong to character, scholarship
and intellectual strength.

The members of â83 should aim to send in all reports and
memoranda as early as possible. Put in a little more time
if necessary each day, but make an early report to Miss
Kimball.

A pleasant feature of a program in a cozy little local circle
is thus reported by one of the members: âWe have personations,âthat
is, a person assumes the character of some
eminent individual, giving a sketch of his life and work,
the audience guessing who the character is. We find this
profitable in the study of biography, taking, of course, as
we do, the characters mentioned in the C. L. S. C. course.â

A member from California says: âI appreciate the odd
five minutes I pick up here and there. The text-book of
Greek history is intimately associated with the dough-nut
kettle and ironing-board, and also the Preparatory Greek
Course in English with my small nephewâs cradle.â

From Peoria I receive cheering words concerning the C.
L. S. C. at that place. Here is a postal card announcing as
follows: âThe C. L. S. C. will meet Tuesday evening, February
20, at 7:45, sharp. You will please be prepared to answer
in a few words, not occupying more than one minute,
the following question: [Here the question is inserted.] If
you can not be present, please hand your answer to the secretary
of the C. L. S. C., care of the Y. M. C. A. rooms.â
How much the Y. M. C. A. might do through the C. L. S. C.!

Come to Chautauqua if you can this season. If this is impracticable,
meet your fellows of the C. L. S. C. at Framingham,
Mass., Mountain Lake Park, Md., Round Lake, N.
Y., Lakeside, O., Island Park, Ind., Monteagle, Tenn., Lake
Bluff, Ill., or Monona, Wis. Take the
Assembly Daily
Herald
, and read with us if you can not be with us. And
if the Heavenly Father allows limitations, and hindrances,
and sickness, instead of freedom and recreation the coming
season, remember that in the loving fellowship of the great
C. L. S. C. you have hosts of sympathizing friends. Such
sympathy helps us to bear disappointments.

âIn the memoranda of last year is a question concerning
the nineteenth century. Does this mean
occurring
in the
nineteenth century, or affect it without regard to the day of
occurrence?â Answer: It means events that have occurred
in the nineteenth century, as discussed by Mackenzie in his
book.

Concerning another question, it is asked, âIn what period
certain events occur? Should the answer be in some schedule
of periods or divisions of time that have already appeared
in the reading?â Answer: The periods refer to the
twelve periods which are found in the little Chautauqua
Text-Book on âGeneral History.â
[458]

A correspondent sets forth the advantages
of the C. L. S. C. He says that he
has become acquainted with men and
things hitherto unknown; enjoyed the
pleasures of a foreign trip without its discomforts;
cultivated his memory until
now he is able to turn to good account
the regular walk to and from business
in the memorizing of choice passages;
fitted up in his house not only a âChautauqua
Corner,â but a whole room which
is, as he says, âour family gathering
room, and here the C. L. S. C. is well
advertised, our certificates from the
Bryant class, our membership cards,
and many photographs and engravings
of prominent literary men, and of historical
events, adorn the wall; books
and journals occupy various places
within easy reach. Often during a
transient call conversation has been
turned from light to serious things, and
thus we have been able to draw together
an interested class of nine members,
some of whom have already forwarded
their names, and probably others
will follow in due time.â

A member of the class of 1884 writes:
âIt is so pleasant to be learning something
all these years when I once supposed
I would be too old to learn. During
my married life I have had more
leisure for reading than before. The
privilege of enjoying a course of study
so carefully arranged and nicely adapted
to the needs of busy people, is highly appreciated.
I think I express the feelings
of many housekeepers when I say
that I receive a stimulus from the work
which more than compensates for
the time given, and makes all home
work and care seem lighter. The nicest nook of the sitting
room is my Chautauqua corner, and the hours spent
there are the very best ones. This year we have a circle of
eleven members. I find myself watching eagerly for the
coming of
The Chautauquan
, and the testimony and reports
from local circles seem like letters from friends.â

At the âChautauqua Teachersâ Retreatâ for 1883 a new
and delightful feature will be carried out:
An Ideal Summer
Trip beyond the Sea
. An imaginary party of tourists
(the âChautauqua Foreign Touristsâ) will pack the pleasures
and profit of three monthsâ travel into fifteen days, by
the aid of conversations, lecture-lessons, class-drills, blackboard
outlines, choice readings by gifted elocutionists, musical
contributions by superior singers, personal reminiscences
by travelers, a voluminous library of travel, a
multitude of card-photographs, and about one thousand of
the finest stereopticon illustrations by one of the most powerful
stereopticons in America. I can not here enter more
fully into the features of this unique and useful exercise.

It appears to me that the high opinion which a man has
of himself is the nursing-mother of all the false opinions
that prevail in the world, whether public or private. Those
people who perch themselves astride upon the epicycle of
Mercury, who can dive so far into the heavens, are more
annoying to me than a tooth-drawer.â
Montaigne.

Once more we stand, a joyous band,

Our songs to heaven upsending;

They freely rise,

A sacrifice

Of prayer and praises blending.

2 Our college halls are grand and free,

Her charter heaven granted;

Her roof the summer-crownÃ©d tree,

Where natureâs hymns are chanted;

And round her shall her children cling

With loyal love and duty,

And yearly all their offerings bring,

Of gathered wealth and beauty.â

3 From the vast ocean shore of thought,

We bring our earliest treasure,

With many a golden memory fraught,

And many a lofty pleasure;

We offer now our work to him

Whose loving light hath guided,

Throâ pathways to our knowledge dim,

From his great thought divided.â

DISCREPANCIES IN ASTRONOMY.

By BISHOP WARREN.

All have noticed that the tables of distances, magnitudes,
etc., as printed in âStudies of the Starsâ and âRecreations
in Astronomy,â do not in all cases agree. In the latest edition
of âStudies of the Stars,â the tables have been made to
correspond to those in the âRecreations.â The reason of
the discrepancy is the fact that we do not absolutely know
the distance of the earth from the sun, which distance is
the golden reed with which we measure the city of God.
We are seeking to determine this distance. To this end we
have fitted out expeditions to observe the transit of Venus,
and are now expending time and money most prodigally. The
difficulties are alluded to, page 61 of the âRecreationsâ: âTo
mistake the breadth of a hair, seen at the distance of 125 feet
would cause an error of 3,000,000 miles at the distance of the
sun, and immensely more at the distance of the stars.â
That accounts for the greater discrepancies in the tables as
the objects measured are farther off. It is better to commit
to memory the tables in the âRecreations,â as they are the
latest.

Love of reading enables a man to exchange the wearisome
hours of life which come to every one, for hours of delight.â
Montesquieu.

LONGFELLOWâS BIRTHDAY.

CELEBRATIONS BY THE LOCAL CIRCLES.

We have received many reports of the interesting celebrations
held in honor of Longfellow, on February 27âhis
birthday. These memorial services are an excellent feature of
the social work of the C. L. S. C., and circles would do well
to make an effort to observe them.

A public memorial service was held in Franklin, Mass.,
and the
Sentinel
, of that place, expresses hearty commendation
of its character.

A very neat, printed program has been sent us from Spencer,
Mass. The exercises, held at the home of one of the
members, consisted of essays, recitations, and music, and
were followed by supper.

The âLongfellowâ afternoon at Westfield, N. Y., must
have been very pleasant. The society spent the time reading
âEvangeline,â and talking of incidents in the life of
the author, completing the entertainment with a supper.

The Lockport, N. Y.,
Daily Journal
congratulates the C.
L. S. C. of that town upon the success which attended their
celebration, and expresses the wish that the society will
have many more such gatherings.

At Hiawatha, Kansas, the circle carried out an excellent
program of music, essays, and recitations.

At Media, Pa., an entertainment was given in honor of
the poet. A pretty feature was the response by a sentiment
from each of the guests, quotations having been written on
cards and presented with their invitations, so that all might
join in the exercises. A novel exercise was the reading of
character sketches, the audience being permitted to guess
who it was that was portrayed therein. The literary feast
was followed by refreshments.

The C. L. S. C. of Westminster, Minn., held a celebration
with appropriate exercises.

The Longfellow Memorial Day was observed by the St.
Louis, Missouri, local circle, in a meeting of unusual interest,
held Monday evening, February 26, in their regular
place of meeting, the pleasant parlors of Pilgrim Congregational
church. Though quite long, the program was heard
through to the end by a large and intelligent audience,
mainly friends of the members from without.

From Auburn, N. Y., we receive the following: âFebruary
27 we celebrated Longfellowâs birthday. It was the
first really premeditated entertainment we have had, and
we of the committee looked forward to it with fear and
trembling, only to be so pleasantly surprised at the willingness
to do, and the amount of stored-away talent, that now
we complacently think our local circle can do almost anything.
Prof. R. Holmes talked to us, and it was such a
delightful, encouraging talk, I wished for the magic art of
the stenographer, that I might send his pleasant words to
you all. Some of us had felt certain he would âtell us all
about Chautauqua,â but when he told us it was simply indescribable,
we gave a little sigh, and will try and wait until
1886, the year to which most of us belong; then we just
hope to go there, and behold and appropriate for
ourselves
.
Prof. Holmes explained to us the full significance of the
mystic C. L. S. C., and made us understand more fully than
ever how much we might make of it if we would.â

It is a proverbial expression that every man is the maker
of his own fortune, and we usually regard it as implying
that every man, by his folly or wisdom, prepares good or
evil for himself. But we may view it in another lightânamely,
that we may so accommodate ourselves to the dispensations
of Providence as to be happy in our lot, whatever
may be its privations.â
Wilhelm von Humboldt.

âThe Wilbur F. Berry Circle was started
January 1, 1882. No organization was formed, however,
until the next October. As we were three months behind
at the beginning, the work seemed somewhat hard, but the
interest did not flag, and the course for the second year was
entered upon with much zeal. We have a membership
of sixteen. Deep interest is manifested by the members.

Massachusetts (Magnolia).
âWe have received the sad
news of the death of Miss E. O. Tuck. Her mother writes:
âMy daughter died very happy; her Saviorâs presence
lighted the dark valley. She was much interested in the
C. L. S. C., having induced more than twenty to join it.
She would have graduated this year, having completed the
reading required for the White Crystal Seal Course.â

Massachusetts (Rockville).
âOur village is so small that
we try to be united in every good work; therefore when we
started our circle we found only six who thought they could
afford time and money for the full course. Seven others
subscribed for
The Chautauquan
, five of whom met with
our circle as often as convenient. We sold tickets for a
course of lectures, and all who bought them were made
local members, to give them an ownership feeling in the C.
L. S. C. One of our members lives at Norfolk, three miles
away. She must harness and drive over herself when she
comes, and she has not been absent a half dozen times since
we organized. One of our members, a young girl, has a
bed-ridden sister, and is unable to go from home for an education,
so the C. L. S. C. is a God-send for her. As we
have no minister here and can not call upon those in the
neighborhood, we are reading the sermons from
The Chautauquan
.
Thus the good seed reaches many hearts.

New York (Troy).
âThe Troy
Times
contains the following:
âThe âVincent Circleâ of the C. L. S. C. met at the
North Second Street Methodist Church last evening and had
a packed house, a fine program and a most spirited meeting.
The program was wholly astronomical in character. The
Round-Table conducted by the president was facetious, varied
and instructive. It is looked forward to by the circle
with keen relish. The
conversazione
on Copernicus, Galileo
and Kepler added interest, and showed how the members
were posting themselves on the subject of astronomy. It
was announced and received with great delight that Dr.
John H. Vincent would lecture in our city shortly before
the circles of this vicinity.â This circle numbers over two
hundred, and enthusiastically writes us: âWeâre alive.â

New York (Friendship).
âWe have a small circle of seven
ladies of the classes of 1883 and 1884. We follow the plan of
work given in
The Chautauquan
and find it a help, as all
know what is to be reviewed; our plan is to talk the lesson
over. While going through Greek history we had one or
two short essays each weekâsubject assigned by the president.
A lady nearly seventy years old gave us a beautiful
essay on Geology. She is a member of the class of 1883, and
expects to be at Chautauqua next fall to receive her diploma.
There are none of the class more enthusiastic than she. Her
reading has been a source of comfort, as well as profit; has
lightened her burdens, giving her little breathing spells in
the busy whirl of her life. Last year we had no organized
class and feel that much is gained by meeting and conversing
on the subjects.

[460]
New York (Jamestown).
âBy the March number of
The
Chautauquan
I see that the president of the Pittsburgh association,
Mr. Martin, did not know when he hopefully placed
that organization of C. L. S. C. as âfirst in paying homage to
our alma mater.â On the evening of September 30 the graduates
of Jamestown, the class numbering twenty-five, met
for a âjubilee reunion.â The secretary of all the years, Mrs.
D. W. Hatch, read a condensed history of the work and life
of the circle, and its diminishing size during the yearsâ siftings.
The president discussed the âChautauqua Idea,â
congratulating the members in this the overcoming of the
hindrances and discouragements, that he knew had attended
the years now ended. If there had been any lack of enthusiasm
it would have been supplied by the âreal presenceâ of
the C. L. S. C. flag and banner, that had been brought from
its secure storage for another purpose, and which, for the
first time, was hailed by a few who had not been able to
follow it through the Golden Gate; and that old flag told
such a story that it seemed almost sacred. Jamestown has
also an earnest circle of twelve girls from the Sunday-school
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, organized this year, and
doing good work, under the supervision of Mrs. M. Bailey.
Good idea.

Pennsylvania (Allegheny).
âA local circle was formed here
December 22. We are now advancing splendidly, and every
meeting shows an increased interest in the work.

Pennsylvania (Stroudsburg).
âOn Saturday evening, June
24, 1882, Mr. O. W. Deck, of Rehresburg, also a member of
the C. L. S. C., delivered a public lecture under the auspices
of the circle, his subject being one of the mottoes of the C.
L. S. C., âWe study the word and the works of God.â The
lecture has been very highly spoken of by all who attended.
Our circle is growing, and we believe a great amount of good
has been and is being done.

Pennsylvania (Media).
âA number of the ladies of Media,
feeling the need of higher culture, and the pleasure of seeking
that culture in connection with each other, met on the
evening of October 3, 1882, and organized a society, with
constitution and by-laws, the society to be called the âChautauqua
Local Circle of Media.â There are seven now in our
circle, with abundant promise of a larger circle next year.

Pennsylvania (McKeesport).
âWe have received a poem
read by Charles A. Pitts, of McKeesport, Pa., on board the
âVincentâ on the evening of August 16, 1882, at an excursion
tendered the class of â84 by Mr. Fairbanks, of Chicago.
We regret that we cannot publish the entire poem, but lack
of space prevents. We give the following stanzas:

The Fates revealed to me last night,

The honor held in store,

For those who keep their armor bright,

In the class of â84.

They bade me âwrite it in a book,â

âIn letters large and bold;â

That on our history all might look,

And laborâs fruits behold.

âTrue statesmanship shall bud and bloom,

Upon your classic tree;

Corruptionâs reign of crime and gloom

Shall by you banished be.

The church shall rise in majesty,

To plains she never trod;

And sweet zephyrs bear you minstrelsy,

To the Eternal God.â

Pennsylvania (Girard).
âAt Girard, Pa., a little town of
about one thousand inhabitants, the C. L. S. C. members of
the Class of â82 organized a local circle in 1878. The circle
was reorganized in October, 1882, and at present has a membership
of thirty-four, five of whom were graduated with
the Class of â82; four are of the Class of â83, twenty-one of the
Class of â86, and the other four are local members. The object
of our circle is to hold together and help the regular members
of the C. L. S. C.; hence we have not made our meetings
public, and admit local members only on condition that
they read at least one hour a week of the required reading.
Most of our work, aside from reading and study at home, is
done in sub-local circles, of three or four members each, who
meet about once a week, talk over their special work, and
bring difficulties and results to the regular monthly meeting.

Pennsylvania (Houtzdale).
âThis is a community of about
eight thousand people. The Philomathic Circle was organized
November 28, 1882. We now have succeeded in reading
up with the advance, and are taking a review. The membership
has been limited to twenty-five, because we are obliged
to meet at the houses of the members. We are looking forward
to the time when we can have a regular place of meeting
and increase the membership. There are many here who
would like to join us.

Pennsylvania (Bradford).
âThe Bryant branch of the C. L.
S.C. was organized in November. We have nine regular and
several local members. Thus far the meetings have been very
prosperous, and out of nine members we have had an average
attendance of eight. We have some hope of increasing
the numbers of our circle, as another circle here has
been broken up and several members have expressed a desire
to join us. At our last meeting we voted to have a critic
appointed at each meeting, who shall take notes, and at the
end of each exercise shall bring his criticisms before the
circle.

Pennsylvania (Erie).
âWe commend to local circles everywhere
the following excellent plan for studying the geography
of the heavens, sent us by Prof. H. A. Strong, of Erie:âAt
the beginning of the study of astronomy, the circle took
up the subject of celestial geography, and intend to pursue it
the entire two months until the map of the heavens becomes
as well outlined as that of the earth. We turned to the
chart of the heavens given on pages 201, etc., in Warrenâs
Astronomy, and entered on the study of these celestial maps
immediately. We had no trouble with the circumpolar
constellations as given in figure 67 of the text-book.
These were readily found in the heavens above, traced and
mastered. But further on we find the other constellations
are described and located in the heavens for September and
November, and such location only confused and led astray
for the present study. Our researches in the heavens were
well nigh blocked, when we had the good fortune to find a
chart of the entire heavens that removed all our difficulties
and made the study of the stars easy and delightful. This
chart is entitled a âMovable Planisphere of the Heavens,â the
work of Henry Whitall, 130 Grand St., New York, adapted
as an atlas to go with Burrittâs âGeography of the Heavens,â
and the chart was copyrighted in the year 1862. The
perfection of this atlas of the heavens is that it can be so
arranged by a simple adjustment as to show the visible
heavens, with the position of all the constellations, and the
names of all the principal stars, for any observer in any
hour or any night of the whole year. It is a key that unlocks
the heavens, and any layman can use it. The chart
consists of two circular boards about fifteen inches in diameter
attached to each other, with the upper one pivoted upon
and revolving about the lower one. The lower and immovable
board has painted upon it the geography of the starry
heavens as divided into constellations, and the upper board
being set for any night of the month shows what constellations
are rising, setting, on the meridian, or in any part
of the firmament. Actual trial has proved its use and success
[461]

as compass and guide book. Such a method in this
study gives a delight that only trial can reveal. Astronomy
thus studied illumines the page of inspiration; and the
works of God explain the Word of God. Such readings of
the heavens gem with added lustre the divine question,
âCanst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades or
loose the bands of Orion?â

District of Columbia (Washington).
âA few of us concluded
to push the Chautauqua movement here, and so we went to
work to ascertain how many circles had been formed, and
as a result representatives from Parker, Union, Foundry,
and Dumbarton circles met and organized a Chautauqua
Union, the object being for mutual interest and to endeavor
to organize other circles during the coming summer and
fall, to secure lectures upon the topics connected with the
readings, and to do anything that would bring to popular
attention the grand C. L. S. C. The first thing we did was
to go to the fountain-head, and on March 16, Dr. J. H. Vincent
lectured in the Foundry Methodist Episcopal Church,
before the Union and a very large audience, upon the Chautauqua
work, with marked success, and with his usual eloquence
and power to interest and instruct. The lecture was
free, as we wished those to come who could not well afford
to pay for admission. We wish to reach the very lowliest.
His lecture caused many to join circles, even at this late
day, and we expect to reap a grand harvest next October.
But this is not all. Our lines have fallen in pleasant places.
On the 20th Mrs. Spofford, a large-hearted lady, invited the
Union, through Foundry Circle, to meet in her parlors
Bishop H. W. Warren, a counselor of the C. L. S. C., and
author of âRecreations in Astronomy.â There was a large
gathering, and the bishop and his fair daughter were cordially
welcomed. Mrs. Lydia H. Tilton welcomed the
bishop with the following lines:

To you who talk with distant suns and stars;

Find proofs in light of undiscovered spheres;

Keep time with Vulcan or moons of Mars,

And balance cycles with eternal years,

Yet count as highest in Godâs universe,

And worthiest our study and our care,

One human soul, we bring in simple verse

A grateful welcome; counting it a rare

Good fortune, for one happy hour, to tread

Your larger orbit, sharing in your light,

And being by your inspiration led

To study truths that everywhere unite

To show us God, not as a dread unknown,

And far away, but
here
in watchful care,

Where every heart that yields to him a throne,

May, eâen as suns and stars, his praise declare.

Florida (Miccosukie).
âOur local circle was organized
March 14, with Rev. W. S. Richardson, president. I think
it is the first local circle in the State; there are several
members of the C. L. S. C., however, who are pursuing
their studies alone. We organized with five members, all
of whom seem deeply interested in the work.

Ohio (Plain City).
âAbout October 1 we organized a local
circle of fourteen members. Soon after, by the appointment
of conference, our pastorâs family was removed, which, with
the removal of another family, deprived us of five of our
most reliable members, and disspirited the remaining ones.
The consequence is that we have not attained a very sure
footing as yet. We have not succeeded in having enough
members present to accomplish anything at meetings more
than once or twice, although one or two of us have exerted
ourselves to secure an attendance, and have a program prepared.
Most, however, are doing the reading and enjoying
it. If some enthusiastic Chautauquan can suggest a plan
by which we may bring about a better state of affairs in
our circle, we shall be glad to hear from him or her.

Ohio (New Albany).
âWe are all very well pleased with
the course. We feel much stronger now than when we
commenced last October. The work commends itself to all,
old and young.

Ohio (Norwalk).
âOur circle is doing a grand work. All
of the graduates are members of the local circles, and are
reading the seal courses.

Indiana (Monticello).
âWe organized a local C. L. S. C.
January 24, 1883. Seven of us are taking the full course,
two of whom did last yearâs work. Besides those taking the
regular course, nine are taking
The Chautauquan
this
year with the intention of reading the full course next year.
It is impossible to tell you how much we love the work.
Many are becoming interested in the readings, and we hope
to have a better report next year.

Illinois (Chicago).
âOne of the most difficult things we
found was naming the circle. It was weeks before we could
find a suitable name, but our motto was â
nil desperandum
â
and at last we came off conquering, for we are now the
âVincent (conquering) Circle,â of Chicago.

Illinois (Hampshire).
âOur meetings are conducted wholly
on a conversational plan, led by our president and everyone
taking part. The members are all very much interested in
the work, and show a great deal of enthusiasm. Each book
is left with regret.

Illinois (Peoria).
âThe Y. M. C. A. of Peoria has been trying
to find the best method for putting their members in the
way of doing themselves a permanent good, and to get an interest
in their thoughts and hopes, tastes and inclinations, so
as to guide them to that which is higher and better. After
many efforts they believe they have found it: âWe have our
gymnasium for those who like it, some receptions with refreshments,
and some games, chess, checkers, etc., and a
library, and the periodicals, but such things do not take
a hold upon earnest natures so as to create a new life in them.
They are not exhilarating or inspiring. We finally have
concluded that the C. L. S. C. was just what we wanted,
and adopted it. There is certainly a very great benefit in
the knowledge that 30,000 people are taking the same course,
that our work is all laid out for us, a definite amount for
each week. It is a great advantage to the committee on
program; they are not compelled to spend any time in discussing
what they will take up next, and how much. The
members of the circle waste no time in suggesting this, that
and the other thing to the committee. Many a circle would
be disintegrated and broken up if they should attempt to
discuss what study they would take up next, and how much
and in what manner it should be studied; just as many persons
waste their lives vainly attempting to determine the
question what they shall do, and most people waste a large
part of their leisure moments because they have no plan
for using them systematically. I look upon the âChautauqua
Ideaâ as one of the greatest and best ideas of our wonderfully
rich and fruitful century, and I believe it is only in
its infancy, and anything I can do to help it along I desire
to do. It seems to me that the C. L. S. C., and the Book-a-month,
and the C. Y. F. R. U, are very proper departments
of Y. M. C. A. work, and that their introduction into Y. M. C.
A.âs would greatly strengthen the associations and greatly
benefit the members, and I can (now) see no objection to
the Y. M. C. A. being used to introduce the âChautauqua
Ideas,â and thus be made to do good and get good. Mr.
Hill, of Ohio, has succeeded in having the movement favorably
endorsed by the Y. M. C. A. State Conference of Ohio.
[462]

I think I will try to attend the International Y. M. C. A.
Conference at Milwaukee this spring, and bring the matter
up there; but in the meantime if it could be brought before
State and local organizations, it would be so much time
saved. It seems to me that small Y. M. C. A.âs would be
even more benefited than large ones by the C. L. S. C., and
that they might be maintained with a C. L. S. C. in country
neighborhoods and small hamlets where they could not
exist alone. The size of our C. L. S. C. puzzles me now,
and I hardly know what to do about it. Owing to the large
number of members we are compelled to limit each member
to answering one question, and to something like one
minute in which to do that. If the circle were smaller each
one would have more time. But I am afraid to try to divide
it, for fear some will thereby be discouraged. Still
there are new members who wish to join, and if size was no
detriment to a circle, I think we could commence the next
year with two hundred members. We have rather encouraged
the organization of a local circle in the R. E. Church,
of which Alex. G. Tryng is a member. I think they have
about fifteen (all local) members, no regular C. L. S. C. We
have not encouraged any but regular C. L. S. C. members
to join our circle, though we have seven local members.â
This circle sends in a report of fifty-seven regular members,
with an average attendance of forty-five.

Wisconsin (North Leeds).
âI have read much, but no course
of reading that Iâve ever undertaken has afforded me the
genuine satisfaction which I have received from the C. L.
S. C.

Michigan (Davison Station).
âWe organized a circle here in
December last, and now have a membership of fifteen.
Commencing so late in the year, we are still somewhat behind
in our reading, but we are trying to do extra work, and
hope to finish the yearâs work in time to begin with the class
next October.

Tennessee (Memphis).
âThe Memphis local circle was organized
on July 23, 1880, with eight members. Mr. J. R.
Pepper was elected president. The membership increased
to twenty-nine during the first few months following its organization,
and thirty-five joined the Class of 1885 formed
in October-December, 1881. During the winter of 1881-82
there were seventy-five persons engaged in reading the
course, although only fifty belonged to the local circle. The
Memphis local circle held monthly meetings from the date
of its organization until October last, when its members were
divided into three local circles, the smaller bodies proving
more beneficial in their results and more convenient, since
the members are scattered over the entire city. The three societies
now in existence are the Central, Chelsea, and the
South Memphis local circles. The Central circle consists of
sixty members, and meets on the first Friday evening of each
month. The Chelsea circle meets in the school room at the
brick church, on the evenings of the first and third Tuesdays
of each month. It contains thirty-two members. The
South Memphis circle, containing about twenty members,
meets in the Second Presbyterian church, on the second and
fourth Tuesday evenings of each month. All the circles are
in a prosperous condition, and the interest taken in them is
progressing steadily.

Minnesota (St. Paul).
âWe have received from Professor
Daniels, of the Academy of Science at St. Paul, some encouraging
words: âI came up here on account of some Geological
work in the Rocky Mountains last fall, and have remained
with my family to begin the organization of a campaign
for scientific and industrial education in these new
States. I have hunted up the scattered Chautauquans, and
endeavored to persuade them to enlarge their circle, and take
up the scientific part of the course with greater earnestness.
I see a mighty future for your work, and am stirred to enthusiastic
admiration of it, and it seems to me a grand opportunity
is opened to ally it with scientific development
and place it in the front rank of educational progress. Myself
and my whole family have joined the class, and we are
live Chautauquans, doing our class readings and drawing
others into it as we can. We meet to-morrow evening at the
house of Mrs. Emily Huntington Miller, well known to you
I presume.â

Iowa (Maquoketa).
âThis is the first year of a branch of
the C. L. S. C. in Maquoketa; although we did not organize
our local circle until late in November, we have thirty-eight
members, who seem to be in earnest and doing good work.
Rev. F. C. Wolf is our president. It was through his efforts
that the interest in the C. L. S. C. was awakened and a circle
organized. We have a committee of three, who arrange
a program for each meeting. We have essays and talks on
subjects assigned, written questions brought in by the members
to be answered by the circle, readings of selections
from
The Chautauquan
, or the books we have been reading,
and the last half-hour devoted to âRound-Table Talk.â
Our president had great difficulty at first to get the tongues
loosened, and we had numerous long pauses in the conversation,
but we know how to improve the time now, and all
enjoy it.

Iowa (Washington).
âOur local circle has a membership of
thirty-eight, six of whom have taken up the four yearsâ C. L.
S. C. work. We meet every Monday evening at the homes
of the different members, and our program consists in reading,
answering questions in
The Chautauquan
, and general
discussion of the subjects under consideration, after
which the secretary calls the roll, and each member responds
with a quotation from a favorite author.

Missouri (St. Louis).
âUnder the efficient leadership of its
president, Miss Helen Peabody, the circle here is doing good
work, and is one of the largest and best sustained literary
societies in the city.

Kansas (Leavenworth).
âThis circle was organized March
5, 1883, with eighteen members, which have since been increased
to twenty-nine. At the meeting, Mrs. Burrows, of
Ohio, a graduate of C. L. S. C., was present, and it was
largely through her influence and zeal (according to knowledge)
that the circle started so auspiciously. The membership
includes teachers, lawyers, merchants and others,
and all seem thoroughly alive to the benefits of the mental
and social culture which the course affords. We begin several
months behind the class of 1886, but we donât forget that
we live in a State whose motto is â
Ad astra per aspera
,â
(âTo the stars through difficulties.â)

Idaho Territory (Ketchum).
âWe are two. Only a Chautauquan
couple in this far-away little mining-camp, whose
natural location brings to mind with new beauty the words,
âAs the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord
is round about his people from henceforth even forever.â
We have had our books less than one month, and are still
in our first enthusiasm over the glad fact of each being one
of the 12,000 of the class of 1886. Beginning with the readings
for October, we have read up to dateâeverything on
English HistoryâAncient Greece, Preparatory Greek
Course, Scandinavian, and Sunday Readings, besides pouring
delightedly over every thing in
The Chautauquan

relating to the C. L. S. C. work, longing for the time when
the completion of the required reading will allow us to enjoy
all of the excellent things therein. With cordial greetings
for all Chautauquans, and especially warm ones for the
[463]

lonely ones scattered in solitary places, we hope to remain
unto the end.

Oregon (Portland).
âOn December 11, 1882, was organized
the first Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (within
our knowledge) in Oregon. We feel quite encouraged, as
we had so little difficulty in getting started, and all seem to
take a great interest, notwithstanding our class is composed
almost entirely of working people. By this I mean those
who have little or no leisure even, outside of daily labor, but
what should in a measure be devoted to the home circle;
still we are becoming (even within so short a time) so attached
to our class or circle, that we class it among one of
our household and family treasures that both old and young
can cherish and enjoy. Our class numbers sixteen. Now
we are prepared to go along with the lessons of
The Chautauquan
,
and feel that we are more united to the Class of
1886.

Southern California (Riverside).
âWe have a large circle,
meeting monthly in the Methodist Episcopal church, and
each two weeks at the residences of members.

Canada (Toronto).
âThe Toronto Central Circle has a membership
of about two hundred, and includes all Chautauquans
in Toronto and vicinity. About seventy-five of the
two hundred members are of the class of 1886, and have
therefore only just begun, while others are completing
their course. As yet we have only one alumnus, our enthusiastic
secretary, Mr. L. C. Peake. In connection with
the Central Circle are two or three strong local circles,
one at least of which meets regularly, and has very interesting
meetings. I think, if we may have a little space in

The Chautauquan
occasionally, we can furnish you with
an item now and then to let Chautauquans know that Toronto
is pushing ahead, and will soon have a band of Chautauquans
second to no city of its size in numbers and enthusiasm.
I may say we expect to have Dr. Vincent lecture
here in Shaftesbury Hall soonâsubject, âOn the Heights.â
We anticipate a rare treat. Dr. Vincent is perhaps the most
popular lecturer we have on the Toronto platform.

C. L. S. C. ROUND-TABLE.
[I]

Dr. Vincent
: All interrogations are in order in the way
of criticism, questions relating to blunders in speech overheard,
to infelicities on the platform, provincialisms, or to
any imperfections of speech, which we desire in the interest
of the English language and of a true culture to correct.

I receive a great many very sensible letters from members
of the Circle. I received one during the summer or
spring, to which I call your attention. I will read it. We
have not been able to carry out the idea here, but at some
time I trust will do so:

â
Dear Sir
:âAt Chautauqua last summer I remember Miss Washburn
referred to some of the practical scientific work they accomplished
at their California Assembly; and you expressed a wish to
bring more of this work into the Round-Table meeting. I have
thought of the matter often, and several plans presented themselves.
The chapters we had on geology in
The Chautauquan
suggested an
idea to me that might be carried out with little trouble. In some of
the local circles there are many who are able to classify and give interesting
particulars of the rocks they may pick up by the wayside,
but many are not so fortunate. I doubt not those few chapters in
geology led more than one to say, âI wish I could classify this and
this fragment of rock.â I do not mean rare and curious specimens,
but that rough and bare rock by the roadside. Many of the C. L. S.
C. members who will be at Chautauqua, must be familiar with these
things, and many will be ignorant. It seems to me it would be very
profitable for those who are ignorant, and not wholly unprofitable
for the enlightened ones, if we could have some rudimentary work in
reading sermons in stones.â

The letter closes:

âIf those who are qualified should be too modest to volunteer in
sufficient numbers, you would undoubtedly be enabled to select
proper ones to supply the deficiency. Enough specimens, probably,
might be picked up. I was talking to some of the C. L. S. C. friends
who thought they would take a basketful of stones. I have hesitated
about writing, but your note of May 15, acknowledging the former
letter, encourages me that you will not think this an intrusion.â

It is a very happy, practical letter, and it was in pursuance
of the suggestions made in that letter that Colonel
Daniels was invited to take the class which he organized in
geology. I have no doubt that many of you who attended
several sessions of this class in geology found great benefit,
and you have seen how the same kind of work may be continued
on a smaller scale at home. If you have any thoughts
in that direction, I shall be very grateful if you will write
them to me. I hope to do something a little more thorough
next year. We have in the history of Chautauqua had Prof.
Winchell, and Prof. Rice, of Middletown, for very able lectures
on geology. We shall do something in this line in the
future. I read the letter because it was practical, just such
as I like to receive.

A voice
: How would it do for all of us to send on forty
to fifty pounds of geological specimens to the museum from
the various localities?

Dr. Vincent
: Express prepaid. It might be well to
write in advance to let us know the localities you represent,
so that certain portions of Ohio, where the C. L. S. C. furore
prevails, may not send several tons from the same
neighborhood. [Applause.]

A voice
: A lady here proposes to send specimens from
Colorado.

Dr. Vincent
: We should be very glad of them. There
is no reason why, with our large organization through the
world, we should not have at Chautauqua one of the best geological
museums in the country.

A correspondent, a lady, writes from Colorado: âI think
a knowledge of hygiene and medicine very essential to
house-keepers, but it is one very little understood in the
[465]

majority of households. I wish to offer the suggestion that
a course should be founded in connection with the C. L. S.
C. I can not go away from my home and spend time and
money to take the course, but would be glad to take it up in
the C. L. S. C., if offered.â

Dr. Vincent
: Why may we not have a department, in
which mothers and house-keepers might be interested; a
department which would collect the various suggestions and
devices for promoting house-keeping, that we may have the
âhouse beautifulâ in every home. Wealth is not necessary
to such a result. Some of the most doleful places that I
visit are the richest homes, where they have bare walls, or
poor pictures on them, and carpets selected in the worst
taste, and furniture that cost enough, to be sure, but was not
selected wisely. When I go into a house, though it have
very low ceilings, very small windows, and is very old-fashionedâbuilt
years ago, and though the people who
built it did not have very much to build withâwhen I look
at a house like that, and see on the walls pictures, selected
for their real artistic value, even though inexpensive; when
I see flowers and vines growing about; when I see the

Atlantic
, or
Harperâs
, or the
Century
on the tableâand a
few well-chosen books on the shelvesâwhen I get into a
house of that kind, my heart always warms toward the
people who live there. We might have delightful homes
all over the land. Brick and boards, lath and plaster do
not make homes. It is not the large, costly house, I commend,
but the house, little or large, cheap or costly, with
evidences of taste here and there. Do you know that the
first movement of true taste in many a house would not be
the putting in of new pictures so much as the taking out of
the old. (Laughter.)

Mr. Martin
: Are the âHall in the Groveâ and the âOutline
Study of Manâ absolutely required for â83?

Dr. Vincent
: We put them on the list, but when asked
if it were absolutely necessary to read them I said âNo.â

Mr. Martin
: I think that the memoranda will show that
at least ninety per cent. of the class of â82 have read it.

Dr. Vincent
: I am glad to hear it; but you remember
when an objection was made two years ago to the ârequiringâ
of a local, modern book like the âHall in the Grove,â
I said in a general way we did not require it, but we preferred
it. I will tell you why the âHall in the Groveâ was
written. It is my old story of the
esprit du corps
. The college
provides for this by its surroundingsâthe old buildings,
the old elms, the old campus, the class songs, the
memorial days, the pleasant memories, the struggles and rivalries
in recitation, the sports, the diploma, the honor, the

prestige
in the world outside, the relative standing of âourâ
college and the other colleges. All these things create in
the student the
esprit du corps
which makes him glad to
say, âI belong to this or that college.â See the working of
this spirit in a college boat-race. Take these old dignified
and pious editors of religious papers, who have not been in
a boat, unless to cross to Europe, for twenty-five years. Let
old Wesleyan row with Cornell, and Harvard, and Yale,
and Brown, you will find the old Baptist editor, or the old
Methodist editor, who opposes all that sort of thing, close
up an editorial on the modern follies in college, âNevertheless,
we were somewhat glad when we read that Wesleyan
stood so well in that race.â [Laughter.] That is the
spirit which characterizes the college life. There is educating
power in it. It is a good thing for a boy to have it, and
for a man to keep it. Now, we of the C. L. S. C can have
nothing of this kind unless we construct it or grow it in our
own way. So we have âOur Hallââthe Hall of Philosophy.
Look at it by moon-light, or in the morning, or with its
eager crowds at the vesper hour. The other evening a lady
said, âThere is something very fascinating about this Hall.â
Then here are our St. Paulâs Grove; our path-way from the
gate to the steps. Do you remember on Commencement
Day the flowers strewn by those little darlings, who only
knew that they were doing a beautiful thing, and did not
see how far down it went into your hearts? Then there are
our Athenian Watch-fires and our songs that excel for poetry
and inspiration all the songs that were ever written for
any educational society on earth (I am proud of our Chautauqua
songs and our Chautauqua poetess, Miss Lathbury),âall
these things help to create the spirit of Chautauqua.
Pansy has given in her âFour Girls at Chautauqua,â and
especially in the story of âThe Hall in the Grove,â a true
interpretation of Chautauqua and in a delightful way has
shown the effects of the movement on society. All these
things tend to give an
esprit du corps
to the C. L. S. C., and
when you carry your diploma and remember your march
from gate to goal the other day, you say, âI was present at
the graduation of the class of â82, and I shall go there as
often as I can.â What the vision and the experience do for
us who come here âThe Hall in the Groveâ will to some
extent do for those who can not come. This enthusiasm
will do for our members what the similar element in four
years of college discipline and experience do for college
students. And that is why I said let us have âThe Hall
in the Groveâ written, so that people who never come to
Chautauqua shall feel that they are one of us, that they really
seem to have been there.

Questions concerning pronunciation of words were then
taken up. The words âwiseacre,â âhousewife,â âarea-râ (a
New England mispronunciation), âseptuagint,â âCharlotte
Yonge,â âkhedive,â âChautauqua,â âCeltic,â âtruths,â
were considered. The differences of opinion expressed justify
our readers in consulting Webster or Worcester.

Dr. Vincent
: I hope the Class of â83 will be here to-night,
according to the program, at nine oâclock for the Class
Vigil. I am very anxious to see every member of that
class. The Class of â84 will please meet here when this service
closes.

Written question
: Where is volume four of the âHistory
in Literature?â

Dr. Vincent
: That work on English Literature (Chautauqua
Library) was commenced by an accomplished lady
who has been ill ever since she wrote the first volume.

Written question
: Are we to use the same text-book
on Greece as the first year?

Dr. Vincent
: We are.

Written question
: What is the Bryant Bell? Did
Bryant give it?

Dr. Vincent
: He did not. We gave that name to the
bell we purchased. We own only one bell. The other bells
are furnished by the house of âClinton H. Meneely Bell
Company,â of Troy, N. Y.

Written question
: Will reading the White Seal Course
for the last two years give us the white seal?
Dr. Vincent
: Yes, sir.

I will now proceed to state the objects of the S. H. G.
âThe Society of the Hall in the Groveâ has for its object
the improvement of the graduates of the C. L. S. C. in all
things that tend to true life, physical, intellectual, social,
and spiritual; the permanence of the Chautauqua Idea and
spirit, the keeping of the place, and the protection of the
articles which have acquired a peculiar sacredness to all C.
L. S. C. Chautauquans. In furtherance of these objects the
Society of the Hall in the Grove shall select an executive
committee of twenty-five members, whose business it shall
be to appoint the working committees for each year. And
each year all the members who are elected in 1882 shall constitute
the nucleus or foundation of that committee. For
example, if you elect twenty-five ladies and gentlemen this
year, and next year ten of them are absent, the fifteen who
are present make the nucleus of that executive committee. In
[466]

that way we shall keep up a permanent element. It will be
your duty to elect twenty-five members. The âMessenger
of the Hall,â appointed by the Superintendent of Instruction,
shall be chairman of that executive committee.
We hope to retain this Messenger for years. The committee
shall be elected in 1882. Then there ought to be several
special committees. We had some annoyance on Saturday.
That banner was left standing in the Amphitheater. It is
a banner that no money could buy. It might be easily mutilated.
We need a committee to protect that banner from
one end of the year to the other. We need also a permanent
âGuard of the Gate.â It is only a conceit, and some
people may think it is ridiculous, but we do not mind that.
It is a pleasant conceit that no one pass under that arch
who has not a right to pass under it. It is the business of
the Guard to carry out this law. We had the gate photographed
to-day, but the gate was opened, and opened by the
Guard. There should be a committee on correspondence.
You see we have quite an amount of work to do as a âSociety
of the Hall in the Grove.â I make these announcements so
that you all who are interested may know, and that we may
become a formal âorderâ and duly elect our committees.

EDWIN AND CHARLES LANDSEER.

The writer of an obituary of Charles Landseer, who died
in July, 1879, records an interesting incident connected with
that artistâs picture, âThe Eve of the Battle of Edgehill.â
This, perhaps his best work, was painted in 1845. When it
was nearly finished, Edwin Landseer was asked by Charles
to come and look at it; and remarking that it was a very
good picture, but âHow nice a spaniel would look in that
corner!â Charles said, âWill you put it in, then?â At which
the master took up the brush, and at once painted in a fine
old English spaniel with some leather dispatch-bags lying
on the ground by him. The picture was duly exhibited and
admired, the spaniel especially; but the dealer who bought
it, being a simple man of business, bethought him that Sir
Edwinâs dog would be worth more than the whole picture.
So he coolly cut it out and sold it, filling the place by a common
dog copied from it. Several years afterwards the owner
of the picture showed Sir Edwin, with some pride, the picture
in which he had painted the dog; but the great master
declared âheâd be hanged if ever he did that dog.â The picture
was examined more closely, and then the trick was
found out. The identical picture, as cut out and put on another
canvas, was sold shortly before Charles Landseerâs
death at Christieâs, in the collection of the late Mr. White,
for the sum of Â£43!

THE SONNET.

By WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.

Nuns fret not at their conventâs narrow room;

And hermits are contented with their cells;

And students with their pensive citadels:

Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,

Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,

High as the highest peak of Furness-fells,

Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:

In truth, the prison unto which we doom

Ourselves, no prison is: and hence to me,

In sundry moods âtwas pastime to be bound

Within the Sonnetâs scanty plot of ground;

Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)

Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,

Should find brief solace there, as I have found.

A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD.

By
Mrs.
JOSEPH COOK.

Two months have passed since the journeyings of the
Chautauqua quartette were interrupted by the illness of
their beloved commander-in-chief, and now, under new
leadership, they are about to resume their travels with the
âlimited timeâ for which American tourists are famous.
Much must be omitted which was in the original program,
and piteous are the groans of these disappointed Chautauquans,
as one after another of their anticipated delights is
ruled out of the new plan. âWe can not go to Germany!â
âCan not go to Germany!â exclaim the four as with one
voice. And then one by one they utter their separate laments.
âNot see the Sistine Madonna!â âNor the Rhine!â
âNor Rauchâs lovely marble of Queen Louisa at Charlottenburg!â
âNor Heidelberg Castle!â âI feel for you from my
heart,â says the leader, âbut let me beg of you to reserve
some of your emotion, for I have other disappointments in
store for you. It is quite likely that you will visit the continent
of Europe again, but this may be our only opportunity
to go around the world. We do not want to make the
circuit of the globe after the fashion of Jules Verne. Be
prepared for another shock. We can not stop in Switzerland!â
The faces of the quartette grew positively pale at
this announcement. There were tears in the eyes of the
Ã¦sthetic member, who had been improving the two monthsâ
delay in practising sketching from nature, and confused murmurs
of âInterlakenâChamounixâthe ascent of the RigiâLucerne
and Thorwaldsenâs lionâthe Lake of Geneva, and
the Castle of Chillonâalas! alas!â came from the party.

âLet me tell you our best plan,â said the leader, who felt
herself in an awkward position in thus coming in to take
the place of another, and obliged at the outset to insist upon
slaying the cherished hopes of the Chautauqua quartette.
âI am sure none of you want to visit any of these famous
places simply to say that you have been there, or to âsee all
that you can in five minutes,â like the over-hurried traveler
Howells describes in his âVenetian Journeys.â We must
reach Italy by the shortest possible route. We can not stop
there half as long as we shall desire. Rome is inexhaustible,
and we want to see the Pyramids and be ready next month
to set sail from Suez for India.â The gloomy shadows
which had fallen on the faces of the eager Chautauquans
lifted a little at the mention of Rome and the Pyramids, and
a sweet reasonableness began to take possession of them.
The leader continued: âWe leave Paris at nine oâclock this
evening, and in twenty-four hours we shall be in Turin.
We shall cross the Alps by the Mont Cenis tunnel, and you
will have a glimpse of Switzerland, and be in the midst of
grand mountain scenery all day to-morrow. When we reach
Turin we will decide which route we will take to Rome, for
the City of the Seven Hills must be our chief objective
point.â

Packing to resume the journey was now the business of
the day. Our practical member made all necessary arrangements
for us. She visited the Gare de Lyons that afternoon
and had our tickets
visÃ¨d
, for we had been assured that,
disagreeable as it might be to join a superintended party
which moves according to an inexorable plan, it would save
us some annoyance to buy the tickets issued by any of the
responsible tourist organizations and then there would be
no awkward mistakes at small railway stations, where only
Italian was spoken, and we found that this arrangement
worked admirably. Our energetic little woman of business,
with her imperturbable good nature and winning smile,
which always melted the hearts of stern railway officials,
came back to the pension with the assurance that everything
was satisfactorily arranged, and by judiciously feeing the
[467]

guard we should be able to secure a railway carriage to ourselves.

Twenty-four hours of railway travel and we reach Turin,
fatigued enough for a good nightâs rest at the Hotel Trombetta.
We make an early visit the next morning to the
Royal Palace, the residence of Victor Emmanuel, while
Turin was the capital of Italy, which position she held from
1859 until 1865. The palace has the plainest possible exterior,
but the long suites of apartments are fitted up in a lavish
manner, and these rooms are reached by a magnificent
marble stair-case. Glass chandeliers, gilded and frescoed
ceilings, beautifully polished floors of inlaid woods, were
the main characteristics of the rooms. A marble bust of
the wife of Victor Emmanuel showed a sweet, womanly
face, with a queenly pose of the head. Here were many
interesting portraits and miniatures of the house of Savoyâamong
others one of the Princess de Lamballe, who suffered
such cruel indignities from the Paris mob for being the
friend of Marie Antoinette. Powdered hair, rolled back
from the forehead with a long curl each side of the neck,
gentle brown eyes and a refined face, with a touch of sadness
in it, which seemed to forebode her fate, made up the
picture.

In our drive about the city we talk over our future route.
âThere are two ways to Rome,â says the leader, âand we
should not long hesitate which of them to take if it were
not for this serious embarrassment in respect to time. Our
inclinations point to Milan, Venice and Florence, but it is not
safe to trust ourselves in those alluring places, so we will
proceed to-morrow to Genoa, and thence to Pisa, and so on to
Rome.â The Chautauquans are becoming philosophic.
âThe Continent of Europe another time!â saves them from
despair under these repeated disappointments.

Genoa, with its memories of Christopher Columbus, is
not a very attractive place except for those who have a fondness
for silver filigree jewelry. Our few hours here gave
us opportunity to visit several gaudily decorated churches;
to see the exteriors of palaces, cold and cheerless-looking
under a gray sky, though warmth and sunlight might have
made the courts pleasant, in which we caught glimpses of
fountains, statuary and colonnades. In the Andrea Doria
palace we saw a portrait of the old admiral with his favorite
cat, but most of the rooms were desolate and unadorned.

The journey from Genoa to Pisa is a succession of tunnels,
eighty in all, many of them of considerable length, so that
it seemed as though we were traveling by night instead of
day. The views of the Mediterranean were aggravatingly
beautiful as we emerged from the tunnels, but we had only
time to exclaim and spring forward toward the window
when our enthusiasm would receive a sudden check as we
plunged into darkness again. Now and then our unobstructed
vision permitted us to see these bold promontories,
through which our course lay, bordering the coast and pushing
their sharp tusks into the sea. At Massa the Marble
Mountains, rivalling those of Carrara, contrasted finely with
nearer green slopes.

The objects of chief interest at Pisa center in one square.
Here are the Cathedral, the Leaning Tower, the Baptistery
and the Campo Santo. These beautiful buildings, from four
to six hundred years old, have been wonderfully preserved
from the ravaging tooth of time. The interior of the
Cathedral is a basilica with nave, double aisles and elliptical
dome over the center. Its sixty-eight columns are ancient
Roman and Greek, and were captured by the Pisans in war.
The flat ceiling of the nave, though richly gilded, marred
the beauty of the otherwise noble interior, but the aisles
were vaulted. The swaying of the bronze lamp which
hangs in the nave is said to have suggested to Galileo the
idea of the pendulum.

A burial place in Italy, called a
Campo Santo
, is arranged
in the form of a square with covered arcades like the
cloisters of a cathedral, and a sunny, open central space.
The one at Pisa is particularly sacred because the earth in
the open court was brought from Jerusalem. We wandered
through these aisles filled with mortuary marbles and tablets
enjoying the reflection of the sunlight falling through the
beautiful tracing of the open, round-arched windows. The
frescoes by Orcagna representing Death and the Last Judgment,
were fascinating from their horrible realistic treatment.
The Baptistery, a circular, dome-crowned building, is
a perfect gem inside and out, exquisitely finished as an ivory
toy. There is a wonderful echo here which comes floating
down from the dome like music from an angelic choir.
Two hundred and ninety-four steps lead to the top of the
famous Leaning Tower, and one is repaid for the ascent by
a wide outlook on the Apennines; the city itself through
which the Arno winds; the cluster of fine buildings at the
base, and the flashing Mediterranean six miles distant.
And so, closing our eyes repeatedly to see if we could reproduce
in mental vision the picture before us, we bade
farewell to Pisa and are next to be found at Rome.

In order to begin acquaintance with a new city, it is a
good plan to take at the outset what the guide books call an
âorientation drive,â obtaining in this way a general idea of
the topography of the city, a first vivid glance at the buildings,
monuments, and ruins, closing the drive with an outlook
over the city from some commanding height. Starting
from the head of the Corso, the principal business street
of Rome, we paused at the column of Marcus Aurelius,
then on to the Piazza Venezia and Trajanâs Forum. At the
Roman Forum the nineteenth century grows dim as the imagination
calls up the orators, senators, warriors, and famous
men of old Rome, who once paced among these gray, broken
pillars. Jerusalem and her woes come before us as we
reach the Arch of Titus, and see in bas-relief the pictured
story of the capture of the golden candlestick, the sacred
vessels, and the treasures of the Temple. To this day pious
Jews will not pass under this arch. It is but a step from
here to the Colosseum, where again we are reminded of the
overthrow of the Holy City, for this huge amphitheater was
built by the enforced labor of sixty thousand captive Jews.
The best piece of descriptive literature to read here is found
in Richterâs Titan. Past St. John Lateran and S. Maria
Maggiore, we drive down the Via Nazionale, a broad, new
street lined with stately marble buildings, called palaces, in
one of which we find most agreeable and healthy quarters
during our stay in Rome. Arriving in front of St. Peterâs,
we can not resist the temptation of entering for a moment.
The fountains were shot through by the brilliant mid-day
sunlight as we walked up the magnificent piazza to the
largest and most imposing, if not the most beautiful, cathedral
in the world. One who regards Gothic architecture as
the best expression in stone of religious aspiration, is not
likely to be enthusiastic over St. Peterâs. The proportions
are so harmonious that the vastness of the interior fails to
impress the new comer. It is only by repeated visits, and
by studying St. Peterâs in sections, that one appreciates
the size, and comes to discover that modern places of worship
could easily find room in a single arm of this gigantic
cross. Colored glass, instead of these barn-like windows,
would be an improvement, although the broad shafts of
white light falling across the high altar made a fine effect.
Priests in black, priests in white, and rope-girdled monks
move noiselessly about. They kneel in the various chapels:
they kiss the well-worn, extended foot of the bronze statue
of St. Peter, and descend to the shrine where, according to
Church tradition, the apostle is actually buried.

Leaving the cathedral, we drive up a pleasant, winding
road, past terraces of century plants and curious cacti, to S.
Pietro, in Montorio, where from the piazza we obtain such
[468]

an outlook as would be hard to surpass, embracing the
tremendous sweep from St. Peterâs dome to the flats of the
Campagna. All Rome is at our feet. The Apennines from
Soracte to the Alban Mount are bathed in sunlight, shadow
and shower. Historic villages lie along the slopes, nestling
in the valleys, and crowning the hill-tops. The giants of
the past move through the spiritual sky and hover over this
ancient city where they lived, and suffered, and died. The
view from the terrace of the Pincian is justly celebrated,
but it does not equal the outlook from this height.

If one desires to use his time in Rome to the best advantage
let him have nothing to do with half-educated guides,
whose information is often untrustworthy. There are promenade
lectures given by well-informed English archÃ¦ologists,
who have spent years in Rome, making a special
study of the ruins and modern excavations. The Chautauqua
quartette were fortunate in securing the services of Mr.
S. Russell Forbes, whose recent book, entitled âRambles in
Rome,â gains for him the gratitude of all those who have
felt the need of just such a printed guide. Our first morning
was spent at the Roman Forum and Colosseum, under Mr.
Forbesâs delightful leadership. Starting from the temple of
Castor and Pollux we went over the whole ground of the
Forum, pausing before the mound which covers the ashes of
the great CÃ¦sar, seeing the rostrum from which Mark
Antony made his funeral oration, and also the rostrum where
Cicero delivered his famous speeches, and on which, after his
assassination, his head and hands were nailed, âthat everybody
might see them in the very place where he had formerly
harangued with so much vehemence.â We walked
over the identical pavement used in the days when Rome
was mistress of the world, and saw ruts in the stone made
by chariot wheels, when England was but a barbarous isle.
The Flavian Amphitheater, known to us as the Colosseum,
received this name from the colossal statue of Nero, that
stood near, and it was first spoken of in this way by Venerable
Bede, of England. Byron is responsible for the mis-spelling
of the word, which he writes
Coliseum
. Mr. Forbes
thinks there is no evidence that Christians suffered in this
arena, with the exception of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch.
The cross which formerly stood in the center is now
removed, and the excavations have revealed three parallel
curving walls, which were put up by the Emperor Commodus,
who boasted that he could kill an hundred lions with
as many javelins. Standing in safety on one of these high
walls the beasts were led out to meet the cruel, murderous
spears cast at them with unerring aim by this brutal emperor.
From the upper gallery one can look down on what
Richter calls âthe crater of this burnt out volcanoâ and
imagine the vast Amphitheater in the year of its dedication,
A. D. 80, when the games continued for one hundred days,
and 5,000 beasts were slain, while from 80,000 to 100,000 spectators
crowded these now deserted spaces. Visiting the Colosseum
by moonlight a solemn hush broods over the place
where was once such abounding, riotous life, the roar of
wounded and infuriated wild beasts, mingling with the
death-groans of gladiators and martyrs. The silence is
broken by the musical monotone of a tolling church bell,
suggesting the new light which had just risen on the world
when this amphitheater was in process of construction, and
which has been the chief force in extinguishing the desire
for such brutal and bestial exhibitions.

It is a brilliantly blue morning and the Chautauquans
are in high spirits, for at 10 oâclock they are to start in open
carriages, with Mr. Forbes as guide, for the Appian Way and
the Catacombs. They first visit the baths of Caracalla,
which even in ruins give one some conception of the magnificence
of Rome under the Empire. These sunken mosaic
pavements are still beautiful, the vacant niches suggest the
fine works of art that once adorned them, and the grass-grown
arches and walls, over which rooks and jackdaws
now fly, speak of the gay life that once assembled here. It
was a vast structure covering a mile square, and accommodating
1,600 bathers at once. Here were not only every conceivable
kind of bath known to us moderns, but rooms for
games, reading and conversation, each of these most elegantly
fitted up, and on top of all were the gardens. It was
a place of fashionable resort, where the pleasure-loving Romans
could spend their days. Built by the emperor, it was
then thrown open free to all, in order to curry favor with the
people.

The Appian Way is lined with temples, villas and tombs.
As it was against the law to bury inside the walls, the ancient
Romans were accustomed to place their dead on either
side of the principal roads leading from the city. At the
despoiled tomb of the Scipios we each of us took a lighted
candle and went down into gloomy, subterranean passages,
to see the niches which once held the sarcophagi of Scipio
Barbatus, Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, and other distinguished
members of the Scipio family.â

âThe Scipiosâ tomb contains no ashes now;

The very sepulchers lie tenantless

Of their heroic dwellers.â

The treasures of this tomb have been carried to the Vatican
Museum.

At the Columbaria we walked through blossoming hedges
of pink roses to the great sepulchers for those whose
bodies were burned as was customary during the first centuries
of the Christian era, although even then the distinguished
Patrician families followed the ancient mode of
interment. This early cremation did not consume the body
to powder as in our days, but the bones were left and
gathered into an urn. These funeral vases were placed in
little niches, resembling the nests in a modern pigeon-house,
and therefore called Columbaria. Here were placed
the remains of the officers of CÃ¦sarâs householdâwe read
one inscription to the barber of the mighty Julius, and other
names are familiar from St. Paulâs letters. Tryphena, Tryphosa,
Onesimusâare these the funeral urns of the persons
mentioned by the apostle? So our learned guide was inclined
to think, and we were well pleased to believe it possible.

The Catacombs of St. Callixtus was our next stopping
place, and here again we each received a lighted taper, and
forming a procession descended out of the gladsome light of
day into the gloomy bowels of the earthâthe burial place,
and, as many think, the hiding place of the first converts
to Christianity. We wind in and out a mazy labyrinth,
excavations on either side of us in the soft greenish brown tufa
for graves, one above another, and of irregular size. Many
of these graves were rifled by barbarians for the treasure
supposed to be contained therein. The sarcophagi and
slabs have been carried to museums, especially to the
Lateran, where, on another occasion, we studied the touching
inscriptions, some of which were evidently wrought by
affection and not by skilled workmen. Some frescoes
remain in the Catacombs which are interesting from their
very rudeness, showing that the Christians would not employ
pagan art for their sacred places. Coming to the
Chapel of the Bishops, we see engraved in beautiful characters
this inscription, put up by Pope Damasus: âHere, if
you would know, lie heaped together a number of the holy.
These honored sepulchers enclose the bodies of the saints,
their lofty souls the palace of heaven has received. . . .
Here lie youths and boys, old men and their chaste descendants,
who kept their virginity undefiled. Here I, Damasus,
wished to have laid my limbs, but feared to disturb
the holy ashes of the saints.â From the chapel a
gallery leads to the Crypt of St. Cecilia. When Paschal I.
had the body of this martyred virgin removed in 820, it was
[469]

found âfresh and perfect as when it was first laid in the
tomb, and clad in rich garments mixed with gold, with
linen cloths, stained with blood, rolled up at her feet.â
Although there are shafts for ventilation and light, how
good it seemed to reach once more the upper air and the
flood of sunlight, and to see the blue sky and green earth!

On our way to the Three Taverns we pass the tomb of
Seneca, the tombs of the Horatii and the Curatii, and the
circular tomb of Cecilia Metella, on which Paul himself must
have looked. We drive under the Arch of Drusus, which
spanned the road in the apostleâs day, and so came to the
Three Taverns, where the brethren met Paul, âwhom, when
he saw, he thanked God and took courage.â Crimson-tipped
daisies were blossoming on the site of this famous meeting-place;
the afternoon sun was shining on the Sabine hills
and Alban Mount, and a happy lark, thinking the spring had
come in this soft air, warbled to us his divine melody as our
thought took flight across the centuries to that day when
the apostle to the Gentiles paused here on his way to
imperial Rome, where he lost his earthly life, but the
message that he brought conquered CÃ¦sar, and will yet
conquer the world.

The festival of All Saints Day came while we were in
Rome, and we found shops and museums more generally
closed than on the Christian Sabbath. Driving to the Capitoline
Museum, with Merivale and Suetonius to read in
presence of the portrait busts of the Roman emperors, we
found the doors closed on account of the
festa
, and when
we reached St. Lukeâs Academy there was no admission;
so we concluded to go with the crowd, and in the dark, dull
and dismal November afternoon we drove to the Campo
Verano, one of the largest cemeteries of Rome. This is the
day that the rich and poor visit their dead, carrying flowers
to decorate the graves. For a mile or more the road was
lined with young men and maidens, old men and children
of the middle and poorer classes, who were walking to the
cemetery, carrying wreaths, while the occupants of elegant
private carriages were almost invisible under heaps of
choice flowers. We made slow progress, as the street was
blocked with vehicles and pedestrians, all moving in one
direction, while vociferous beggars, halt, lame, and blind,
stretched out their hands, crying lustily for charity. The
walls along the way were covered with wreaths of natural
and artificial flowers, with bead wreaths and wreaths of
immortelles for sale to those who had failed to supply themselves
at the outset of their journey. Leaving our cab at
the cemetery gates, we walked through the covered Campo
Santo, in which were many elaborate monuments, and on
most of these there was some likeness of the deceased, either
a portrait in oil, or a bust, or bas-relief in marble. A life-size
sitting figure of a young mother holding her little son
in her arms, who was reaching up to kiss her, was the work
of a distinguished Milanese sculptor in memory of his lost
wife and child, and these were both portraits. Another
very touching representation was of a lovely young woman
lying dead on a funeral bier, while her little child was
standing at one side on tip-toe, pulling the drapery of the
couch, as if trying to wake the sleeper. The graves of the
poor were simply marked by a black cross, on which was a
number, instead of a name, but even over these graves a
burning lamp was suspended. In the funeral chapel we
heard the distant chanting of invisible monks.

Excursions to Tivoli and to the Alban Mount; sunny
afternoons in the ornamental gardens and park-like enclosures
of the villas Borghese and Albani; drives to the
Pincian, where there is music and a gay moving throng of
vehicles and pedestrians; study of ancient art at the Capitoline
Museum and the Vatican; repeated visits to the Sistine
Chapel, where one comes under the spell of Michael
Angeloâs mighty genius; a dayâs wandering over the ruined
palaces of the CÃ¦sars on Palatine Hill; a search for the
masterpieces of art in churches and palaces; diligent reading
during the evenings of Merivale and Suetonius, Grimmâs
âMichael Angeloâ and Hareâs âWalks,â a re-reading of Hawthorneâs
âMarble Faun,â and a dozen lessons in Italianâsuch
were the absorbing and delightful occupations of the Chautauquans
during their stay in Rome. And now it was time
to start for Naples, in order to catch the next steamer to
Alexandria. The statues on St. John Lateran stood out
against the blue sky as we moved out of Rome. The desolate
Campagna; the long, solemn stretch of aqueduct
arches; the tombs on the Appian Way; the sun sinking as
a ball of fire; the dome of St. Peterâs, visible long after the
city had been blotted outâthese were our last views of the
Eternal City. We arrive in Naples at 11 oâclock, but there
is delay about luggage, and it is midnight when we reach
the Hotel Royal des Etrangers, after a long rattling drive
from the railway station. Stepping out on the balcony,
under the clear star-lit heavens, we see the matchless curve
of the Bay of Naples, and Vesuvius sending its dull, red
glare into the holy night. The next morning we take an
early train to Pompeii, and on the journey read Plinyâs description
of the three days of horror in the year 79, when
the great eruption of Vesuvius destroyed Herculaneum and
Pompeii. It is a short walk from the station to the gates of
the ruined town, and after escaping from the importunate
beggars, the desolation of these deserted streets is all the
more impressive. Everything seems on a diminutive scale
hereâthe streets narrow, houses small, and the sleeping
apartments no larger than those on an ocean steamer. The
people spent most of their time in the open courts, which
were surrounded by covered arcades and were a necessary
part of every dwelling. Comparatively few of the adornments
of these Pompeiian homes remain
in situ
, the choicest
specimens of art found here have been carried off to the
museums. A fountain in the court, a mutilated statue, a
broken pillar, a bit of mosaic pavement, a partially obliterated
fresco-painting are all that remain to tell of the
beauty of the city so suddenly buried, with 2,000 of its inhabitants,
under twenty feet of ashes and lava. One of the
most interesting spots was where the Roman soldier was
discovered, grasping his spear and remaining faithful to his
post, although he might well have supposed that the last
great day had come. In the museum at Pompeii the
most striking and interesting objects are casts of eight
human corpses, and one of the body of a dog, fearfully
twisted and contorted in the final death agony. The casts
were obtained in 1863, by an ingenious experiment made by
Signor Fiorelli, the present director of the excavations.
While the soft parts of the bodies had decayed, their forms
frequently remained imprinted on the ashes, which afterward
hardened. The bones of a body thus imbedded were
carefully removed and the cavity filled with plaster, and
thus the figures and attitudes of the poor creatures in the
death struggle have been preserved.

On the third day after our arrival in Naples we set sail
for Alexandria. The soft, bright skies of Southern Italy
smile on us as we stand on the rear deck of the French
steamer âMendoza,â looking back at Naples as we slowly
move down the bay, Vesuvius every now and then sending
out a solemn, thunderous boom. We read with delight and
amazement Richterâs marvelous word paintings in âTitanâ
of places which he never saw but with the mindâs eye. We
sail out of the two encircling arms which are thrust into the
blue waters, Ischia and Pozzuoli, the modern name for
Puteoli, on the one side, Castellamare and Sorrento on the
other. The rocky island of Capri is passed; we peer along
the shore of the Gulf of Salerno hoping to get a glimpse of
PÃ¦stum and its famous temple, and on we go, the white
gulls following us into the open sea.
[470]

As a preparation for Alexandria we read Ebersâs âEgyptian
Princess,â and like true Chautauquans re-read Charles
Kingsleyâs âHypatia.â We are so unfortunate as to arrive
at the end of our voyage just after dusk, and although the
lights of the city are in view, we are forced to cast anchor
and remain on shipboard another night. As the twilight
falls upon us, the great spirits of the past begin to loom up
in the skyâthe CÃ¦sars and Ptolemies; Pompey and Antonyâs
fascinator, Cleopatra; Euclid and Theocritus; Cyril
and Apollos; the early Christian Church struggling with
Greek learning and Jewish prejudice. Such is the atmosphere
of the early ages of this ancient city. Under the
Ptolemies and the CÃ¦sars, Alexandria was a world-renowned
city of 500,000 souls, adorned with the arts of
Greece and the wealth of Egypt, while its schools of learning
far outshone all those of the more ancient cities. At
the beginning of the third century it began to wane and
from the time it was taken by Omar in A. D. 641, its commerce
and importance sunk rapidly. The discovery of the
route to India by the Cape of Good Hope completed its ruin.

Anchoring outside the quay we were quickly surrounded
by a crowd of row-boats, with black-faced sailors in a picturesque
costume of white full trowsers, with red jackets and
sashes, and red and white turbans. These boats brought to
our ship several visitors, who came to meet their friends,
and it was amusing to see the Oriental salutations and effusiveness.
In our drive of two hours, strange sights met
us at every turn, and the street scenes were most curious
and interesting. The veiled women, with their black, flashing,
restless eyes; their flowing robes of black or blue or
white, and their stately gait, made one long to see their entire
countenance and to know what is their manner of life.
There is every variety of color here, from the intense black
of the Nubian to the delicate yellow tinge of the Octoroon.
Some of the childrenâs faces were attractive, but most of the
old faces were so haggard and evil that it was painful to
catch a glimpse of them. Groves of the date palm, the
luscious, freshly-picked fruit of which seemed to us far more
tempting than the leeks and onions after which the children
of Israel lusted; donkeys, carrying their riders far
back on their haunches, and pursued by runners who give
the poor animal a shove when he slackens speed; camels,
with their slow gait and quizzical expression, as much as to
say, âDonât you think Iâm handsome? Isnât life a great
joke?â; merchants, sitting calmly in their booths, smoking
their nargilehs with the utmost unconcern as to customâthese
were a few of a multitude of objects new and striking
that attracted our attention.

Pompeyâs Pillar is a solid shaft of polished red syenite,
which resembles Scotch granite, and placed on an eminence
lifts itself grandly against the deep blue of the sky. But it
was erected in Diocletianâs time, and that seems quite
modern here. The Pashaâs palace and harem are of stucco,
and far from being impressive or elegant. We drove through
the grounds, which have a fountain in the center, a few
sickly looking plants, and a fine view of the sea.

Shepheardâs hotel in Cairo has been for many years the
favorite stopping place of English travelers, and one finds
here a degree of comfort and cleanliness not often to be met
in this part of the world. Here the English language is
spoken by all the servants, and, although our method of
summoning a waiter is unknown, the Oriental fashion of
clapping the hands is quite as effective. Mounted on
donkeys we rode to the museum at Boulak, where are to be
found the best specimens of Egyptian ancient art. Massive
and grand are some of these sitting figures of kings who
reigned thousands of years ago. One, with the body of a
sphinx, is said to represent the Pharaoh under whom Joseph
attained power and position in Egypt. Exquisitely wrought
and polished are these black granite statues, but there is no
soul in the stone. The royal mummies recently found near
Thebes are here, and we saw these hoar monarchs as they
lay in their varnished and hieroglyph-inscribed coffins of
sycamore wood, wrapped in the shrouds of fine linen in
which their embalmers had enswathed them, wearing on
their faces their sharp-cut and life-like effigies, encircled
with the flowers and garlands which had been placed there by
the hands of mourners over three thousand years ago. Rameses
II., the Pharaoh of the Bondage lay, holding in his right
hand, appropriately and significantly, a scourge of four
cords. He was the only one of the royal group who bore this
emblem. Here, too, is Thothmes III., that Pharaoh who
ordered the construction of the obelisks, one of which stands
on the Thames embankment, and the other in our own New
York. In another case lies the second king of the nineteenth
dynasty, who occupied the throne during the grandest
era of Egyptian history. He was the builder of the âHall
of Columns,â at Karnac, the most magnificent temple in
all Egypt, and one of the ten or twelve architectural wonders
of the world. It is a significant fact that MenephtÃ¢h,
the son and successor of the Pharaoh of the Bondage, is not
in the group. The question which naturally rises to the
Biblical student is, âAre we to seek for him in the Red Sea?â

Starting one bright morning at 7 oâclock in an open
barouche, with JÅ«seph HakÃ¨ as dragoman, a tall stately
Egyptian as coachman, with the imperial buttons on his
coat, for he was formerly in the service of Ismail Pasha,
and an Arab runner to clear the passage through the narrow
and crowded Cairo streets, we drove in the fresh morning
air over the arched stone bridges of the Nile, with their
bronze lions, the gift of France, and on smooth, straight
avenues lined with lebeck trees, until we had accomplished
the ten miles which lie between Cairo and the Pyramids.
Barricades of corn-husks enclosing heaps of yellow corn,
and the busy, dark-skinned huskers were a noticeable feature
by the roadside. We could not look at a child without
his little hand was extended with the call for
backsheesh
,
and sometimes our carriage was followed by half a dozen
girls and boys whose cries, when they got short of breath
in running, would be simply ââsheesh, âsheesh.â Our first
view of the Pyramids of Gheezeh was over the lebeck trees
and corn-husks, and they seemed close at hand, although
then five miles away. Among the three pyramids of Gheezeh
the pyramid of Cheops, or the âGreat Pyramid,â is by
far the most important. It is
the
pyramid as the mysterious
Sphinx at its base is
the
sphinx. It is probably the
oldest, and certainly the largest building in the world.
Egyptologists differ widely in their chronology. Mariette
puts the building of Cheopsâs pyramid back to B. C. 4235,
Brugsch to B. C. 3733, while Piazzi Smyth places it in the
age of Abraham and Melchisedek, B. C. 2170.

As soon as we left our carriage we were approached by
the sheik of the village and a dozen swarthy Arabs, who,
with their usual vociferous volubility, tried to prove that
we, each of us, needed three men to help us up the pyramid.
One took hold of each hand, and the other pushed
and lifted us on the highest stones of this rough staircase.
Pausing frequently for breath, we consumed three-quarters
of an hour in the ascent, but the summit reached, one
speedily forgets the physical effort required in the grand,
solemn, far-reaching prospect over green plain and sandy
desertâthe living and the dead. Far away on the horizon
line of the desert appear the sharp outlines of ten or twelve
pyramids. Near us is a pyramid almost as large as the one
on which we stand, the smooth casing still remaining on
the top, and making that portion of it inaccessible. Clearly
defined is the line of verdure which marks the overflow of
the river. From June to October this broad plain is inundated
to the depth of from ten to fifteen feet. This remarkable
rise of the Nile waters is occasioned by the tropical
[471]

rains, and the melting of the snows on the high mountain
ranges at the equator. The rise and the retreat are equally
rapid. In May the volume of its waters is only one-twentieth
of that in October. The eternal youth of Nature, âas
fresh as on creationâs morn,â and the hoary past contrast
here most vividly. Where are they who planned and reared
these mighty monuments? Gone and forgotten as we too
shall be. The Arabs sat by themselves and chattered in
low tones when they saw we wanted to be alone, but now
and then they would gather around us like children, asking
in very good English all sorts of questions, some in regard
to America, its extent, climate, the cost of getting
there, and prices paid to a laboring man.

The dark, slippery, suffocating, steep slope which leads to
the Kingâs Chamber is a much more trying journey than
that to the summit, and yet one can hardly understand the
Pyramids without exploring this interior room, which contains
nothing but an empty stone sarcophagus. Over this
rifled coffin we repeated that portion of the fifteenth of 1st
Corinthians, which relates to the resurrection, while the
four Arabs held the candles in perfect silence, and looked
into our faces with a kind of wondering awe.

After a bountiful lunch in our carriage, we walked to the
Sphinx, and saw that face, sadly mutilated now, but still
with an expression of cheerful courage, which has looked
across these dreary wastes under the midnights and the
noons, while men have come and gone like shadows, and
kingdoms have been born and fallen to decay. The body of the
Sphinx is the natural rock, here and there adapted by a little
carving, or the addition of masonry, and is one hundred
and forty feet in length. The head is carved out of the solid
rock, and measures thirty feet from brow to chin, and fourteen
feet across. The Sphinx is merely a ruin of what he
was when sacrifices were offered on the altar between his
lion paws of fifty feet in length. And yet he makes an overpowering
impression of majestic repose, and is worthy of
the name given him by the Arabsâthe Father of Terror, or
Immensity.

APPLICATIONS OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

It is naturally impossible to give even an outline of all
the many and varied applications to which photography
can be and has been applied. In this article it is proposed
to give a few of them, more for the sake of informing the
student what has been done, than for teaching him the
practical method of working them. The method of securing
the automatic registration of barometers, thermometers,
and magnetometers should command our attention first.
It will be necessary to divide these into two classes which
require different treatment. A mercurial thermometer may
be taken as the representative of the first class.

Supposing we have a darkened chamber, in the side of
which is a slit of just sufficient dimensions to allow the bore
of the capillary tube to fill it, and that light can only have
access to that chamber after passing through that slit when
so closed, it is manifest that if a strip of sensitive paper be
caused to pass gradually behind such a thermometer tube
the different height of the mercury will be registered, owing
to the opacity of that fluid to light. If the supply of paper
be properly regulated it is also manifest that the height of
the mercury at any particular instant will be known. Since
daylight is not always available, resort must be had to artificial
light to impress the sensitive paper, and a suitable
process of development employed.

Such a method exists for registering the movements of
this class of instruments, the details of apparatus and manipulation
being altered to suit each individual case. There
are, however, other instruments to which such would be
totally inapplicable. As an example, we may take the
magnetometer. The oscillations of the suspended magnet
as used for measuring the horizontal or vertical components
of the earthâs magnetism are very minute, so minute indeed
that they can scarcely be perceived by the eye. If to one of
these magnetometers, however, we attach a very small and
light mirror, the plane of which is at right angles to the
axis of the magnet, and cause a beam, proceeding from a
source of light, to pass through a small aperture, thence to a
fixed lens on to the mirror, which reflects the beam of light
on to a screen so placed that the image of the aperture is in
the focus of the lens, any small deviation of the magnetometer
will cause the beam of light to deflect on the screen.
The amount of the deflection will be dependent on the focal
length of the lens, and the distance of the aperture and
screen from the mirror. Suppose the screen to be opaque,
and that a slit is cut in it in the direction that the deviation
of the beam would take, and lying in the same plane as the
deviation, and that a strip of sensitive paper moves behind
that slit in a direction at right angles to its length, then at
each instant the position of the beam of light will be registered
on the paper. On developing the image we shall have
a sinuous line corresponding to the deflections of the magnetometer
at every time of day and night, the reading of the
time being dependent on the rate at which the paper travels.

For meteorological purposes we may also hope that photography
will be more utilized than it has hitherto been.
Mr. A. Mallock, at the meeting of the British Association
at Plymouth, has shown a way in which it may be made
subservient to ascertaining the heights of clouds.

In military science it is only necessary to call to mind
the service that the pigeon post performed during the siege
of Paris. A large series of letters were printed on one sheet,
and then photographed to a very small scale on collodion
pellicle. Such pellicles, measuring about 6Ã2 centimeters,
were tied to pigeons, which when liberated carried the dispatch
to Paris, where they had been trained. On arrival
the collodion pellicle was detached from the pigeon, placed
in a lantern, and the letters transcribed and sent to the
various addresses. Of so much use was this pigeon post
that the German military authorities have established a
regular service of pigeons in the chief fortresses of the empire,
which would be used in case of investment or siege by
a hostile army.

During the investigation of the action of torpedoes the
use of photography was also largely brought into requisition
by the writer in order to ascertain the work that was
expended by different charges of gun cotton. The method
adopted was roughly this: A mine having been laid down
at a known depth and position in water, a scale was placed
over it, and photographed from the position the camera was
to occupy. On the explosion of the gun-cotton or powder
an instantaneous exposure was given to a specially sensitive
plate, and the height, breadth, and general form of the
resulting column of water was obtained from the photograph
after comparing it with the photographic scale.

At Shoeburyness, again, a regular staff of photographers
is kept in order to photograph all the experimental work
carried on by the artillery against iron shields, &c., and the
series of such pictures has been able to convey more to the
minds of committees than elaborate drawings could do.

We can not conclude these applications of photography
without recalling the fact that it has proved exceedingly
useful in the repression of crime. The portrait of every convict
is taken by an authorized photographer in each convict
establishment, and when necessity arises prints from such
negatives are produced by the hundred and distributed, in
order that the various police authorities may be enabled to
identify a criminal who may have happened previously to
be placed under their surveillance.

DANIEL WEBSTER versus STEPHEN
GIRARD.

The true relation of Christianity to education has seldom,
if ever but once, been before the Supreme Court of the United
States for adjustment. That time was when Daniel Webster
made his great argument to break the will by which
Mr. Girard founded his college in Philadelphia. Mr. Webster
rose to the demands of his opportunity, and made what
was at once a masterly argument for his cause, and a
splendid defense of Christian charity, Christianity, and the
Christian ministry. In the following article we have
abridged his speech, but we have tried to preserve the chain
of his argument. It is wholesome reading from the mind
of Americaâs greatest constitutional lawyer, in the times
when rhetoricians hurl flippant statements against the bulwarks
of divine truth, as though with these they would batter
them down.

Two millions of dollars were bequeathed by Mr. Girard
for the erection of a college; detailed plans were drawn
specifying where, how, and for whom it was to be built.
The validity of this will was contested by the heirs-at-law
in 1836. In 1841 the case was carried to the Supreme Court
of the United States. In course of the argument, Daniel
Webster made the speech of which we give a synopsis. We
follow the argument, giving only brief quotations. Mr.
Webster passes over the details of the will, taking up the
following clause, or restriction, which Mr. Girard prescribed
as among the conditions on which his bequest for the college
was to be enjoyed.

These are the words: âI enjoin and require that no ecclesiastic,
missionary, or any minister of any sect whatever,
shall ever hold or exercise any station whatever in the said
college; or shall any such person ever be admitted for any
purpose, or as a visitor, within the premises appropriated to
the purposes of the said college. In making these restrictions
I do not mean to cast any reflections upon any sect or
person whatsoever; but, as there is such a diversity of opinion
among them, I desire to keep the tender minds of the
orphans who are to derive advantage from this bequest free
from the excitement which clashing doctrines and sectarian
controversy are so apt to produce.â Upon these statements
Mr. Webster argues: âThe first question is whether this bequest
can be sustained otherwise than as a charity. The
bequest is void according to the general rules of the law,
on account of the uncertainty in the description of those
who are intended to receive its benefits, and must therefore
stand, if it stand at all, on the peculiar rules which equitable
jurisprudence applies to charities. This is clear. The
question is whether in the eye of equitable jurisprudence
the bequest be a charity at all. I deny that it is so.
It is no charity; because the plan of education proposed
by Mr. Girard is derogatory to the Christian religion,
tends to weaken menâs reverence for that religion, and their
conviction of its authority and importance; and, therefore,
in its general character, tends to mischievous and not
useful ends. This scheme begins by attempting to attach
reproach and odium upon the whole body of the clergy of
the country. It places a brand, a stigma upon every individual
member of the profession. No minister of the gospel
of any denomination is allowed to come within the
grounds of this college on any occasion, or for any purpose
whatever. They are excluded as if their presence might
cause a pestilence. When have they deserved it? Where
have they deserved it? How have they deserved it?

âI hope that our learned men have done something for
our literature abroad. I hope that our courts of justice have
done something to elevate the profession of law. I hope
that the discussions of Congress have done something to
ameliorate the condition of the human race. But I contend
that no literary efforts, no constitutional discussions, nothing
that has been done or said in favor of the great interests
of universal man has done this country more credit, at
home and abroad, than the establishment of our body of
clergymenâtheir support by voluntary contributions, and
the general excellence of their character for piety and learning;
and yet every one of these, the Christian ministers of
the United States, is denied the privileges which are opened
to the vilest of our race. Did a man ever live that had respect
for Christian religion and yet had no regard for any
one of its ministers? Did that system of instruction ever
exist which denied the whole body of Christian teachers,
and yet called itself a system of Christianity?

âI maintain that, in any institution for the instruction of
youth, where the authority of God is disowned, the duties
of Christianity derided, and its ministers shut out from its
proceedings, there can be no more charity found to exist
than evil can spring out of the Bible, error out of truth, or
hatred from love. If charity denies its birth and parentage,
turns infidel to the great doctrines of the Christian religion,
it is no longer charity. It is no longer charity either in a
Christian sense nor in the sense of jurisprudence, for it
separates itself from its own creation.

âNow let us look at the conditions and prospects of these
tender children who are to be submitted to the experiment
of instruction without Christianity. They are taken before
they know the alphabet, they are kept until the period of
early manhood, and then sent into the world. By this time
their characters will be stamped. If there is any truth in the
Bible, if there is anything established by the experience of
mankind, in this first third of life the character is stamped.
What sort of a character is likely to be made by this experimental
system of instruction? What will be the effect on
the minds of children left solely to its pernicious influences?
Morality without sentiment; benevolence toward man without
a sense of responsibility toward God; the duties of this
life performed with no reference to the life to come,âthis is
Mr. Girardâs theory of useful education. I do not intend to
leave this part of the cause without a still more distinct
statement of the objections to this scheme of instruction. I
deem it due to Christianity to take up this scheme of Mr.
Girard, and show how mistaken is the idea of calling it
a charity. In the first place, this scheme is derogatory to
Christianity, because it rejects Christianity from the education
of youth by rejecting its teachers, by rejecting the
ordinary methods of instilling religion into the minds of
youth. He who rejects the ordinary means of attaining an
end, means to defeat the end itself, or else he has no meaning.
And this is true, although the means originally be
means of human appointment, and resting on no higher
authority.

âThis scheme is derogatory to Christianity because it rejects
the ministry. Where was Christianity ever received,
where were its waters ever poured into the human heart,
except in the track of a Christian ministry? It is all idle
and a mockery to pretend that any man has respect for the
Christian religion who yet derides and stigmatizes all its
ministers and teachers. It is all idle, it is a mockery and
an insult to common sense to maintain that a school for the
instruction of youth from which Christian teachers and the
ministry is sedulously shut out, is not deistical and infidel,
both in its purpose and tendency.

âIn the next place, this plan is derogatory to Christianity
because it proceeds upon the presumption that the Christian
religion is not the only true foundation, or any necessary
foundation of morals.

âIn what age, by what sect, where, when, by whom has
religious truth been excluded from the education of youth?
Nowhere, never. Everywhere and at all times it has been
[473]

and is regarded as essential. It is the essence, the vitality
of useful instruction. From all this Mr. Girard dissents.
He dissents not only from all sentiments of Christian mankind,
from common conviction and the experience of all,
but from still higher authority, the Word of God itself.
When little children were brought into the presence of the
Son of God, he said, âSuffer little children to come unto
me.â Unto
me
. He did not send them first for lessons in
morals to the schools of the Pharisees or Sadducees, or to
the lessons and precepts phylactered on the garments of the
Jewish priesthood, but opened at once the everlasting fountain
of living waters. That injunction is of perpetual obligation.
It is of force everywhere and at all times. Not
only my heart, my judgment, my belief, and my conscience
instruct me that this great precept should be obeyed, but
the idea is so sacred,âthe solemn thoughts connected with
it so crowd upon me, it is so utterly at variance with the
system of philosophical morality advocated here, that I
stand and speak in fear of being influenced by my feelings
to exceed the proper line of my professional duties.

âAnother important point involved in this question is,
what becomes of the Christian Sabbath in a school thus established?
I say that in this institution, under Mr. Girardâs
scheme, the ordinary observance of the Sabbath could not
take place, because the means of observing it are excluded.
There can be no Sabbath in this college. It would be just
as much opposed to Mr. Girardâs whole scheme to allow
these children to go out and attend public places of worship
as it would be to have ministers of religion preach to them
within the walls; because, if they go out to hear preaching,
they will hear just as much about clashing doctrines, and
more, than if appointed teachers officiated in the college.

âI come now to the consideration of the second part of
this clause in the will; that is to say, the reasons assigned
by Mr. Girard for making these restrictions with regard to
the ministers of religion, and I say that these are much
more derogatory to Christianity than the main provision
itself, excluding them. He says that there are such a multitude
of sects and such diversity of opinion that he will exclude
all religion, and all its ministers, in order to keep the
minds of the children free from clashing controversy. Now,
does not this subvert all belief in the utility of teaching the
Christian religion to youth at all? Certainly it is a broad
and bold denial of such utility. To say that the evil resulting
from the differences of sects and creeds overbalances all
the benefits which the best education can give them, that
is but to say that the branches of the tree of religion are so
twisted and twined, and run so much over and into each
other that, therefore, there is no remedy but to lay the ax at
the root of the tree itself. It means that and nothing less.
But this objection to the multitude and differences of religious
sects is but the old story, the old infidel argument. It
is notorious that there are certain religious truths which are
admitted and believed by all Christians. All believe in the
existence of God, the immortality of the soul, the responsibility
in another world for our conduct in this, in the divine
authority of the New Testament; and can not all these
truths be taught to children without their minds being perplexed
by the clashing doctrines of controversy? Most certainly
they can. Apply the reasoning advanced by Mr.
Girard to human institutions and you will tear them all up
by the root, as you would inevitably tear all divine institutions
up by the root if such reasoning is to prevail. At the
opening of the first Congress there was a doubt as to the
propriety of opening with prayer, and the reason assigned
was, as here, the great diversity of opinions. At length
Mr. Samuel Adams, with an air of impressive venerableness,
rose in that assembly and, with the air of a perfect
puritan, said that it did not become men, professing to be
Christians, who had come together for solemn deliberation
in an hour of extremity to say that there was so wide a difference
in their religious beliefs that they could not bow the
knee in prayer to the Almighty, whose advice and assistance
they hoped to attain. Opposed to all prelacy as he was,
Mr. Adams moved that the Episcopalian clergyman should
address the throne of Grace in prayer. The minister read
the service and then, as if moved by the occasion, broke out
into extemporaneous prayer. Those men who were about
to resort to force to obtain their rights, were moved to tears.
Depend upon it, where there is a spirit of Christianity there
is a spirit which rises above forms, above ceremonies, independent
of sect or creed, and the controversies of clashing
doctrine.

âIt has been said by the other side that there was no teaching
against religion or Christianity in this system. I deny
it. The whole testament is one bold proclamation against
Christianity and religion of every creed. The children are
to be brought up in the principles declared in that testament.
They are to learn to be suspicious of Christianity
and religion; to keep clear of it, that their breasts may not
become susceptible of the influences of Christianity in the
slightest degree. They are to be taught that religion is not
a matter for the heart or conscience, but for the decision of
the cool judgment of mature years; that at the period when
the whole Christian world deems it most desirable to instil
the chastening influences of Christianity into the tender and
comparatively pure mind and heart of the child, ere the
cares and corruptions of the world have reached and seared
it: at that period the child, in this college, is to be carefully
excluded therefrom, and to be told that its influence is pernicious
and dangerous in the extreme. Why, the whole system
is a constant preaching against Christianity and against
religion, and I insist that there is no charity and can be no
charity in that system of instruction from which Christianity
is excluded. Before closing the argument I repeat again
the proposition that the proposed school in its true character,
objects and tendencies is derogatory to Christianity and
religion. If it be so, then I maintain that it can not be considered
a charity, and as such entitled to the just protection
and support of a court of equity. I consider this the great
question for the consideration of this court. I may be excused
for pressing it on the attention of your honors. It is
one which, in its decision, is to influence the happiness, the
temporal and spiritual welfare of one hundred millions of
human beings alive and to be born in this land. Its decision
will give a hue to the apparent character of our institutions.
It will be a comment on their spirit to the whole
Christian world. I again press the question to your honors:
Is a clear, plain, positive system for the instruction of children,
founded on clear and plain objects of infidelity,âa
charity in the eyes of the law and as such entitled to the
privileges awarded to charities in a court of equity?â

Touristsâ Conference,â as well as the stereopticon exhibitions.

The following letter, addressed to Dr. Vincent, explains
why Dr. Fairbairn, of England, will not be at Chautauqua
the coming season:

Airedale College, Bradford, Eng.
,}

26 February, 1883.}

My Dear Sir
âYour letter just received. I deeply regret that the
postponement of my lectures should so distress and inconvenience
you, but am pleased to find that you are so kind as to be willing to
comply with my request. It will be in every respect better and more
suitable for me to come in the summer of 1884, and this I at once and
frankly undertake to do. Please then to arrange according to letter
of the 13th ult., the postponement, and believe me,

Yours, very sincerely,
A. M. Fairbairn

[475]

THE CHAUTAUQUA SCHOOL OF
LANGUAGES.

The following excellent plan for the study of French at
home has been proposed by Prof. Lalande. It meets with the
hearty approval of Dr. Vincent, and will, we trust, find favor
with many. The prospectus speaks for itself.

CHAUTAUQUA SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES.

FRENCH CIRCLE.

President:

J. H. Vincent
, Superintendent of Instruction C. L. S. C.

Director:

A. Lalande
, Professor of French at the Chautauqua
School of Languages.

PROSPECTUS.

I. AIM.

This new organization aims to assist students of the French
language to overcome the idiomatic and other difficulties of
interpretation, as well as to acquire general facility in reading
and writing French.

To this end it is intended to organize a French circle for
regular and systematic home study, to be directed through
the mail by Prof. A. Lalande.

Every member of the French circle will receive certain
exercises, comprising a definite amount of reading, translating,
and idiomatic and grammatic expounding, to be performed
by the members and mailed to the Professor.

These exercises will be corrected by Prof. Lalande and returned
to the student with notes and suggestions adapted to
his individual needs. This series of graduated exercises
will carry the student over all important difficulties in the
language, and the required readings, etc., will insure to the
faithful student such attainments in the French language
as will fit him to profit fully thereafter by the most advanced
instruction in class, or under a living teacher.

II. COURSE OF STUDY.

The course of study prescribed by the French circle will
be divided into the following arrangement of classes:

FirstâPrimary.

SecondâIntermediate.

ThirdâAdvanced.

(1)
Primary.
âIn this department the students will have to
translate into French the exercises contained in Fasquelleâs
French course, and will also answer in French the easy
questions sent to them by the Professor.

(2)
Intermediate.
âPupils will be required to translate into
French exercises prepared by the Professor, and study under
his direction â
Causeries avec mes Ã©lÃ¨ves
,â by L. Sauveur, and
NoÃ«l & Chapsalâs French grammar.

(3)
Advanced.
âThis class will study the French grammar
and literature, and translate into French, under the direction
of the Professor, some selections from Irvingâs âSketch
Book.â

III. TIME OF STUDY.

Each pupil will receive twenty-five letters during the
term, which will begin the 1st of September and end the
1st of the following July.

Persons may enter at any time and back numbers will be
sent to them.

IV. APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP.

Persons desiring to enter the French circle should write
to Prof. Lalande, answering the following questions:

1. Give your name in full.

2. Your postoffice address, with county and State.

3. The proficiency of French already attained.

V. TERMS.

To defray the expenses of correspondence, etc., an annual
fee of seven dollars ($7.00) will be required. This amount
should be forwarded to Prof. A. Lalande, one-half at the beginning
of the term, and the balance after the twelfth exercise.

Note.
âAt the expiration of one term all students who
understand the course which they have been studying, will
be advanced into the one above it; and after having completed

the entire course
and passed a satisfactory examination,
they will receive a diploma signed by the president
and the professor.

SIX REASONS FOR THE STUDY OF GERMAN.

Ever since Carlyle began to study and translate the German
literature, the German language has been growing in
favor with English speaking people. For years past in the
United States, it has held a large place in the curricula of
colleges, academies, and even the public schools. Extremists,
in some cases, have gone so far as to propose the exclusion
of one or both of the old tongues and the substitution
of German. Whilst such practice would be extreme, it is but
just to say that all attention and study thus far have been
worthily bestowed. The following are a few of the many
valid reasons for the study of German:

1. This language possesses, in an unusual degree, those
qualities which give discipline to the mind. One of the
greatest linguists and comparative philologists of the age,
has ranked it not inferior, but superior to the Greek in
this regard. The German is an inflected language like the
Latin. This gives exercise to memory, and demands the
utmost exactitude in construction. At the same time it has
synthetic power, a capacity of word-building unsurpassed
by any other language; so that the nicest shades of meaning
can be expressed, thus giving the mind an exercise of the
highest disciplinary character.

2. German ought to be studied, if for no other reason,
for its wealth of literature. The student can not come into
full sympathy and appreciation with these mines of literary
riches except by the avenue of the language in which they
are found. Much and the best is lost in translations. It
ought to be borne in mind that as students for centuries
past have toiled over Greek and Latin for the sake of the old
masters in literature, that the same reason should incite to
the study of German. For one of the four Titans of literature
was a German, and besides Goethe, there is Schiller,
Lessing, Klopstock, Wieland, Herder, Richter, and others,
making a literary bloom comparable to that of the English
age of Elizabeth. It belongs in its fullness and beauty
only to the German scholar.

3. To the student of theology or science the German language
is of very great value and importance, especially to
the former. A scholar in divinity recently said, âHebrew,
Greek, and German are indispensable to the theological student.â
Joseph Cook discredits Mr. Herbert Spencer in
many things, because, as he says, he âdoesnât know German.â
Certain it is that whilst happily we are not obliged
to accept all the views and notions of German theologians,
yet not to be abreast with the results of German investigations
and discoveries in the various departments of theology
is to lag behind the advanced knowledge and thought of
the times. And here in many instances it is impossible to
rely on translations, for many of the best works are not
translated. Owing to the cost and difficulty of translation
they are not likely to be, and when they are the process is
slow, and the result often unsatisfactory.

4. The American student should study German with a
view to converse easily with his neighbor of that tongue and
nationality. Living, as we do, neighbor to two Germanies,
it is of no little commercial and social advantage to speak
their language. One of these Germanies is established on
our own soil, and we meet and mingle with it every day;
the other, with the facilities for travel and communication,
is as near to us as the remote parts of our own nation are to
each other. Not to be able to speak their tongue, but always
[476]

to compel them to speak ours, is to meet them on unequal
ground.

5. The large and growing demand for teachers of German
is a practical inducement to those who contemplate the
teaching profession. Not only in the college and university,
where broad courses of study in German, including the history
and literature, are provided, but in the graded schools
of the smaller towns, school boards are including German,
and are seeking teachers competent to give such instruction.

6. Last, though not the least of the reasons here given for
the study of German, is that which arises from its relationship
to our own English tongue. Both the German and the
Saxon are the descendants of the old Gothic, the language
of Ulfilas, in which he wrote the famous âCodex Argentens.â
It is estimated that thirty per cent. of our English
is of Saxon origin, enough to establish a strong connection,
making cousins, at least, between English and German.
Thus we observe that many of the commonest household
words are often the same in sound, and many times in orthography.
To the philologist such relations and correspondences
are of great interest and importance. They furnish
some explanation of the resemblances to be observed
between the race, types, usages, and domestic institutions.

HINTS TO BEGINNERS IN THE STUDY OF NEW
TESTAMENT GREEK.âII.

Moments Undervalued.
âA young collegiate of our acquaintance
during his four yearsâ course read every word in
Websterâs Unabridged Dictionary, correcting his spelling
and his pronunciation thereby, and acquired an almost inexhaustible
fund of information as to the derivation of
words. It was all done in odd moments; scraps of time useless
for regular work; time that
some
people spend in
gossip, yawns, plannings to vault to the moon, or in misanthropy.

A German critic memorized every line of Homerâs Iliad
while going from one medical patient to another.

Bishop Gilbert Haven dropped quills from a flying wing
as he flew across continents and seas, and the snowy
feathers fell in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and New
York.

Moments are gold dust. Sweep every one up. The assayer
washes his hands in water that is carefully saved.
His men at the benches save every filing of the precious ore.
His shop boy sweeps the very dirt into a safe. His workmen
clean their feet upon a mat as they
go home
from work.
All this to save a
little
gold. And yet that gold is worth, in
large establishments, more than one thousand dollars annually.

You can learn Greek by saving
minutes
. And the mental
discipline gained in the endeavor will in itself be worth
a fortune to you. You will learn to save moments on other
accounts.

Henry Clay, speaking about courtesies of a trivial character
as affording gratification to others, says, âIt is the
picayune compliments which are most appreciated.â He
does not give us the philosophy of the fact. Possibly it is
to be found in this, that we all have an abundance of this
small change, and fling it forth as being valueless. But
âpicayuneâ
moments
must be better treated.

Dr. Johnson is credited with the saying, âThe habit of
looking on the bright side of things is worth a thousand
pounds a year to any man.â

The habit of saving moments is worth more than thousands
of gold and silver.

EDITORâS OUTLOOK.

The C. L. S. C. on the Pacific Coast.

The following is a report of C. L. S. C. work on the Pacific
coast, sent us by Miss Norton, the Secretary of the Pacific
Branch. It contains so much information and inspiration
that we publish it as an editorial. The growth of which it
tells is marvelous; the enthusiasm it breathes is as sunny,
vigorous, and fruitful as the fair land from which it comes.
It is such broad views and high endeavor that are accomplishing
the great results in our work. To know that far
away ranches and lonely camps are finding growth, life,
happiness in this work, ought to inspire every earnest heart
to work, as our friends of the Pacific coast are doing, that
âits influence may go out to needy sections where even
school and church have failed.â

At the reunion held recently at the University of the
Pacific, the following report was read by Miss Norton:

As San Jose contains the largest local circle on this coast, with a
membership of about seventy-five, it seems fitting that our members
should be made acquainted with a few facts respecting the general
work of the society.

The Pacific Branch of the C. L. S. C. was organized under the name
of the California Branch, four years ago, while Dr. Vincent was on
this coast, and during these years about 1,500 members have been
enrolled. We have representatives of this branch in Oregon, Washington
Territory, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Mexico and the Island of
Jamaica, and hope soon for a local circle on the Hawaiian Islands.
During the present year 290 new members have been received thus
far, and it is hoped that the number will exceed 300 before the close
of the year. This is an excess of 100 over those received last year.
The active local circles have also increased, and now number twenty-six,
with two or three more to be heard from. Of these circles fifteen
have been formed the present year. The progress of the work in the
southern part of the State has been unusual, the largest circle of the
State except that of San Jose, being at Riverside, with an enrollment
of sixty members. The president of this circle, Dr. Whittier, is a
graduate of the C. L. S. C., and a nephew of John G. Whittier, the
poet. The secretary, Miss Alfaretta Wood, is an enthusiastic
worker, and Riverside proposes to have the âlargest circle in the
United States,â so that San Jose will have to look well to her laurels.

Oakland sustains three active local circles with an aggregate membership
of about sixty, and under the leadership of Dr. J. H. Wythe
is doing excellent work.

Sacramento stands next in numbers, and has a most energetic and
enthusiastic circle; Rev. I. H. Dwinell, D. D., Mrs. L. J. Nusbaum
and Mrs. Brewer being the officers.

The largest of three circles in San Francisco is the âMore Circle,â
numbering twenty members and composed of young people.

In its beautiful work as well as its name it does honor to its first
leader, Mrs Prof. More.

Ukiah has two local circles doing enthusiastic work.

In our smaller towns the C. L. S. C. often becomes the center of
literary interest, representing a large proportion of the population,
taking deeper root, and bearing better fruits than in our cities. But
the richest rewards of the Secretary and other officers for much unrecognized
toil, come from mining camps and lonely ranches, from
mountain tops and deserts, and sick-rooms, where solitary students
are cheered and uplifted by our C. L. S. C. To such it goes with
benedictions, inspiring new hopes and noble aspirations. If, amid
our crowding duties and interests, we of the San Jose Circle find but
little room for individual work, or for the rich, intellectual feasts
which are often spread for us at our monthly meetings, may we not
gather courage to persevere, from the thought that this influence has
gone forth to needy sections of our coast, where, in some instances,
even the church and the school have not been organized. During
the first year of its existence, the parent society received 8,000 members,
and of this number 1,700 graduated last summer. During the
first year of the Pacific Branch, under the wise and efficient leadership
of its secretary, Miss L. M. Washburn, ably seconded by President
Stratton and the executive committee, the first class numbered
700. Of this number about 100 are active members, or have paid
their annual fees and ought to graduate the coming summer, if they
have not fallen behind in their studies. All who hope to graduate
should promptly report to Miss L. M. Washburn, Chairman of the
Committee on Graduation. In closing, I would earnestly invite the
ex-members to once more join hands with us, and help forward the
work of the Pacific Branch, as it reaches out its helping hand to so
many earnest students. Especially let us urge upon the citizens of
San Jose, the duty of sustaining the work of this local circle, a work
which we believe would be an honor to the literary centers of our
Eastern States, or even to the âHub of the Universe.â We hope
that the coming assembly at Monterey will be the most interesting
and largely attended of any yet held upon this coast, and that San
Jose will be worthily represented on the occasion of the graduation
of our first C. L. S. C. Class of 1883.

Trial by Jury.

The constitution of the United States guarantees that
every American citizen shall have the privilege of having
his cause tried and decided before a jury of twelve of his
[477]

peers. For centuries this jury system has prevailed among
the English. The framers of our constitution modeling
their laws on the basis of English jurisprudence, incorporated
it into our judicial system. Its purpose is to secure in
every case a just and impartial verdict, and one that is in
accordance with the evidence adduced in the progress of the
trial.

It is the duty of every government to see that justice is
meted out to all its citizens, that their rights are duly respected,
and that the poor and weak among them are placed
on at least civil equality with the rich and the powerful.
Many centuries of trial has proven it to be the best means
of securing these desirable results. The juror is supposed
to take his place in the jury-box with his mind wholly unbiased
with reference to the case to be tried. In many instances
the jurors have never heard of the case which they
are summoned to try. The parties in the suit are entire
strangers to them, or at least are usually persons in whom
they have no especial interest. Under such circumstances
a jury of fair intelligence is pretty sure to bring in a righteous
verdict.

But the matter of ignorance in reference to the case to be
heard by the jurors may be, and of late in many instances
has been, carried to an unreasonable extent. In many cases
which are of public interest, and which are of sufficient importance
to be discussed by the press, familiarity with what
has been said is deemed sufficient to bar an individual from
sitting as a juror during their trial. As a result of this it is
often difficult to secure a jury in a case which has excited
much comment, and which has been the subject of discussion
by the press. The mere fact that a man has read
newspaper accounts of events that have transpired, or even
editorial comments upon them, does not necessarily disqualify
him for being an impartial juror.

All intelligent men are to a greater or less extent readers
of newspapers, and to hold that knowledge thus obtained
disqualifies one for sitting as juror when the case is brought
to trial, virtually excludes men of even ordinary intelligence
from the jury-box, and, too, in those very cases where
they are most needed in order to secure just and righteous
verdicts. The legitimate fruits of the exclusion of the reading
classes from sitting as jurors are such verdicts as that
rendered recently by a Fayette County (Pa.) jury, in the
Dukes trial, where, disregarding the charge of the judge,âthe
evidence set forth,âthe opinion of an entire community,âthe
jury brought in a verdict of not guilty. The
whole country was horrified and disheartened, that a man
clearly guilty could under this system be cleared. Such
outrages on right and justice are sure to result whenever
ignorance takes the place of intelligence in the jury-box, and
will sooner or later bring the whole matter of trial by jury
into disrepute. It is not
intelligence
, but ignorance, prejudice,
and partiality that should be excluded. The only
question in this regard which a jury when impaneled should
be expected to answer is whether, under their oaths, they
can take their place on the jury and render an honest and
impartial verdict.

There is another grave danger in this custom. Not only
are the non-reading and ignorant classes disqualified for
rendering a fair and intelligent verdict, but they are for the
most part sadly deficient in principle and integrity, and
hence are more readily corrupted, more easily bribed, and
more likely to be influenced by designing lawyers than men
of average intelligence and general information. The numerous
acquittals of individuals adjudged guilty by the
popular verdict, and in the very face of the evidence adduced,
is proof positive that in such instances the twelve
men in the jury-box are in no sense the custodians of the
law or the mouthpiece of justice. If, for any reason, intelligence
is ruled out of the jury-box, the jury system will cease
to be regarded as a reliable instrument for the administration
of justice.

Stevensâs Madame De StaÃ«l.

This book, the American edition of which was published
in two handsome volumes by the Harpers, some little time
ago, will perpetuate the fame of a woman of regal intellect
and immense influence upon her times. In Byronâs judgment
she was âthe greatest woman in literature;â Macaulay
called her âthe greatest woman of her times;â and many
others, whose opinions carry weight, could be quoted as
giving her a foremost place among the worlds gifted women.
The biography fills a want; for, while numerous pens have
written of this woman, there has been before no adequate
portrayal of her career. The author, Dr. Abel Stevens, whose
reputation as a writer in history and biography is high and
secure, has for some years been living in Switzerland, where
he has enjoyed excellent facilities for the preparation of the
work, âMadame De StaÃ«l, a Study of her Life and Times,
the first Revolution and the first Empire.â The work is
called, and in its completeness it will probably remain, the
standard biography of this illustrious woman, and will need
no successor. It shows great research and pains-taking, as
well as a skilled literary hand. A complete, much-needed
biography, it is more than this, it is a valuable history of
that marvelous epoch in the annals of France. It is of great
value for its sketches of other eminent persons, contemporaries
of its subject, and for its intelligent narration of
events as sensational as any ever witnessed upon the theater
of Europe.

Madame De StaÃ«l lived from 1766 to 1817. Her full maiden
name was Anne Louise Germaine Necker. Her father was
the great Necker, for a time Minister from Geneva at the
French court, and afterward the powerful French Minister
of Finance. Her mother was the daughter of a Swiss pastor,
and a woman of beautiful person and fine accomplishments,
with whom, while Mademoiselle Curchod, the
historian Gibbon fell in love, and for whom he always
cherished a tender regard. The love of Madame De StaÃ«l
for her father approached idolatry, but for her mother was
much less ardent. She was an only child, and received a
careful training and the highest advantages. She was born
and died in Paris, and this was the place always where she
loved best to live, though for many years, through the persecutions
of Napoleon, she was an exile from France. As
a child she was very precocious; a girl in her motherâs
salon
,
she astonished the people by the brilliancy of her conversation;
she very early tried her hand at writing, and showed
marked literary gifts; when fifteen years old, she had the
maturity which might be looked for in a young woman of
twenty-five. At the age of twenty she became the wife of
Baron De StaÃ«l. The baron was thirty-seven. It was a
marriage of
convenance
, such as in France were customary,
and on her part, at least, there was no love. For a number
of years they lived apart, but she went to the baron in his
last illness and remained with him until his death. When
she was forty-five years old, she made a second marriage,
with a young French officer, Rocca by name, twenty-two
years her junior. Strange as it may seem, this was a true
love-match, and the two, notwithstanding the disparity of
age, lived together in great devotion and happiness until
her death. The marriage was secret, and was known to but
few persons in the life-time of Madame De StaÃ«l. Of three
children, offspring of the first marriage, one was killed in a
duel while the mother lived, and the others survived her
and did her honor. A son was also born from the second
marriage.

What eventful years were those for France in which this
woman lived. If one with such a theme as our author can
not make an interesting story, the fault surely is not with
[478]

his subject-matter. Madame De StaÃ«l saw her father, whom
she idolized, the idol of the French people; she saw himâand
it was a proud time in her lifeâafter the jealousy of
rival ministers had brought about his retirement from the
office of finance minister, recalled by the king, and welcomed
back to his old position by such demonstrations of
popular homage and devotion as have been accorded to but
few; and later she saw him again seeking the retirement of
his Swiss home execrated by the same fickle populace of
France. She saw the downfall of Louis XVI. and deplored
this ill-starred monarchâs fate, whose head was one of the
trophies of the guillotine. She saw the First Revolution
with its horrors, and ardent champion as she was for human
freedom and popular rights, her heart was sickened at
the spectacle. She saw the hero of Corsica arise from nothingness
to be the terror of all Europe; the strides of his
ambition she witnessed until he stood the first monarch
of the world, with crowns in his hands as baubles to give
away. She saw his âvaulting ambition oâerleap itselfâ at
last, and the tide of his fortunes reversed; the exile of Elba
and that of St. Helena passed before her view, and while
she rejoiced to see Napoleon crushed, she sorrowed as a true
French woman over the humiliation of France. She saw
another Louis upon the French throne, and was his trusted
adviser and friend. Napoleon she hated with all her soul.
Acknowledging his consummate military genius, she
loathed him as a monster of selfishnessâa tyrant whose
god was self. The emperor feared her pen in the cause of
popular freedom, and after trying in vain to gain her support
he showed in various ways his malice toward her. He
banished her from France at length, and the story of her
years of exileâbravely borne with all its hardships, though
she could have escaped it by writing in praise of Napoleonâis
very affecting. Dr. Stevens uses as the appropriate
motto of his book the saying of Lamartine: âThis woman
was the last of the Romans under this CÃ¦sar, who dared
not destroy her, and could not abase her.â

And mighty was the influence of Madame De StaÃ«l upon
her age. To say that it was equaled by that of no other
woman is not to say enough. Kings and queens were her
personal friends. With chief men and women in different
landsâstatesmen and warriors, persons distinguished in
science and lettersâher relations were intimate. They admired
her, and bowed to her genius. In political affairs her
influence was great, and in the world of letters she made an
impression deep and abiding. As a writer, perhaps no
woman of any time will be accorded equal rank with her,
unless some would concede it to George Eliot and Mrs.
Browning. Her best known works are âDelphine,â âAllemagne,â
and âCorinne,â though others have had a wide
reading and been much admired. The âAllemagneâ produced
a profound impression. Great as this woman was as
a writer, some have freely said she was greater as a conversationalist.
With wonderful brilliancy she shone in the

salon
. Her own
salon
in Paris would be thronged by distinguished
men and women, and the great attraction was
herself. She would dazzle with her eloquence, as she discussed
various questions, some of them deep questions of
philosophy and religion. Her love of society was a passion.
Her power of affection was mighty, and her attachment to
her friends most strong. When the light of her life was
quenched at the comparatively early age of fifty-one, the
number was large who mourned, not simply for a rare
woman of genius lost to the world, but for a friend, true,
sympathetic, loving, whose place could not be filled. More
than one have said of her that she was a man in intellectâthough
we do not make the remark our ownâbut it is certain
she was a woman in heart. Let our readers turn to the
new and best record of her life, which Dr. Stevens has given
us, and find delight from its perusal.

The Educational Problem.

One of the gravest matters claiming the attention of the
American people to-day is indicated by the above heading.
It is a truism that popular education is a prerequisite to the
success of popular government. We may be said, as a nation,
to have done grand things already in the way of the
education of the people. Nearly fifty years ago there was a
wonderful awakening to the importance of this matter.
The people must be educated, was the thought which took
possession of the soul of Horace Mann, and his beneficent
work has lived and grown. Our common school system was
set in operation. It has become our pride and boast. In a
way very gratifying we have seen the cause of education
advancing in our land. Compulsory education in late years
has been introduced to some extent.

At the present time, however, we are confronted with facts
of a nature to excite alarm. The late census shows a condition
of things in popular education in America over which
it is impossible for citizens to feel self-complacent. These
facts have been set forth in a most impressive manner by
General Eaton, National Commissioner of Education, and
by Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, whose speech in the
United States Senate last summer on âAid to Common
Schoolsâ has attracted much attention. Some of the things
we have to consider are as follows: In a population of fifty
millions in the United States, five millions of people over
ten years of age can neither read nor write; six and a quarter
millions can not write. There are two million of illiterate
voters here, in a total of ten millions. The number of
illiterate voters in the last presidential election was large
enough to reverse the result in all of the States but five. In
illiteracy the North of course does not approach the States
of the South. In the latter there are, in round numbers,
five and a half millions of persons over ten years of age unable
to write, the number of white illiterates being to the
colored in the proportion of two to three. Nearly one-third
of all the voters in the South are illiterate, and more than
two-thirds of the colored voters. But with regard to the
States of the North, the showing is far from being what we
could desire. From a recent report to the Massachusetts
Legislature, by Hon. Carroll D. Wright, it appears that in
this State evenâthe State of Horace Mann, and the vanguard
always in the cause of educationâthere are nearly seventy-five
thousand persons more than ten years of age, in an entire
population of less than two millions, who can not read.
These are startling facts, and the alarming truth is, that
illiteracy in our land, instead of diminishing, is on the increase.
Ex-President Hayes, in his address at Cleveland in
October last, made this statement: âIn more than one-third
of the Union the ignorant voters are almost one-third
of the total number of voters.â And the number of the illiterate
voters is growing larger. It was swelled in the South,
in the decade from 1870 to 1880, by nearly two hundred
thousand. In the country at large the number of children
not attending school is increasing at a rate which, it is affirmed,
if it continues, will in ten years make the aggregate
of children of school age outside of school larger than of
those within.

Surely, in view of these things, one of the greatest problems
before this nation is the educational problem. As a
national safeguard the people must be educated. If this
mass of ignorance continues an element of our population,
and if it goes on increasing, how can we hope for the perpetuity
and prosperity of this âgovernment of the people,
for the people, and by the people?â There must be compulsory
education. The different States must adopt the
principle, and enforce it. It is not strange that our statesmen
are turning their thoughts to the great question of
national aid to education. Hitherto the national government
has done but little in providing ways and means for
[479]

the education of the people. It has been left for the several
States to look to the educating of their citizens. But it can
hardly be doubted that the time has fully come when the
nation on a grand scale should provide for this cause of such
vital momentâpopular education. We are very ready to
agree with General Eaton, when we consider the astounding
statistics he adduces, in the judgment that none of the
measures proposed by statesmen thus far are sufficiently
large and liberal in their devising. Enormous is the work
to be done, and vast is the expenditure of money needed.
But whatever the nation expends to elevate her people and
fit them for citizenship is an investment for her own safety,
and is well expended. Joseph Cook, in the prelude to one
of his lectures, dwells upon such facts as we have cited.
He affirms that America is doing less for the education of
her people, in proportion to her wealth, than certain European
nations. We fear that what he says is true: âInstead
of being, as a whole, at the front of the educational advance
of civilization, our proud nation is gradually dropping into
a laggard place.â Let us trust the time will come in the
near future when this can not be truthfully said; and while
we may regret the delay of needful national action, let us
honor individuals who are giving so nobly to make ignorance
less in our land. If the generous scheme of Mr. Slater
for the good of the benighted millions of the South were to
be duplicated by other millionaires, how grand the results
might be.

EDITORâS NOTE-BOOK.

The Chautauqua University is the latest development of
the Chautauqua Idea. It has been incubating for ten years,
and just as we come near the tenth session of the Chautauqua
Assembly the New York Legislature passes an act
granting a charter for the new University. Dr. Vincent
says that hereafter it will be the â
C. L. S. C. of the Chautauqua
University
.â

Dynamite has excited the fears of people in London. Dennis
Deasy, who carried a box containing explosives and infernal
machines, and a railway porter named Patrick Flanagan,
supposed to be his accomplice, were arrested in April
in Liverpool. At Flanaganâs lodgings were found a number
of explosives and a false beard, besides a revolver and
other equipments for doing mischief to life and property in
London. The most interesting evidence given during the
examination was that of expert scientific witnesses, who
testified that the explosive material in question was known
as âlignine dynamite,â an article that could not by any
possibility be connected with commercial or business transactions,
and which was not made for any legitimate purpose.

A number of gentlemen who have recently come here
from Europe, and most of them from England, have determined
to buy land for grazing purposes in Virginia. It
seems strange that Americans go to the far West to invest
in great farms, and thus locate their herds of cattle thousands
of miles from the sea coast, while in the Eastern States,
near to markets at home and abroad, may be found hundreds
of thousands of acres of lands good for nothing else
but grazing.

The first reunion of the Christian and Sanitary Commissions
was held at Chautauqua several years ago, amid a
blaze of enthusiasm. This year, from July 22 to 24, they
will meet at Ocean Grove, in New Jersey. The chaplains
of the Federal and Confederate armies will meet with them.
Mr. George H. Stuart, president, and the Rev. John O.
Foster, of Waterman, Ill., secretary, issue the call.

Joseph Cook has closed his Monday lectures in Boston for
the season.

The Postmaster General, Timothy O. Howe, died within
the past month. This is the first death of a Cabinet officer
since 1869. General Howe served as a judge, in Congress,
and in the Cabinet. He was a warm friend and admirer of
General Grant. He did not support civil service reform.
His name was never connected with frauds or scandals
during his public life. Judge Walter Q. Gresham, of Indiana,
has been appointed to fill the vacancy in the Cabinet.
His record as a soldier, citizen and judge has been of the
best, and those who know him say that he will be one of
the strongest among the Presidentâs secretaries.

Arrangements are being made to institute a Musical Reading
Circle, in connection with the Chautauqua movement,
which shall be to musical literature what the C. L. S. C. is
to general literature. The plan is being wrought out by
Prof. E. E. Ayres, of Richmond, Va., and when the details
are perfected they will be duly announced. Any inquiries
or suggestions concerning this matter may be addressed to
Prof. Ayres. Other musical attractions are in contemplation
which will be announced in the July number of
The
Assembly Herald
.

The Rev. D. H. Wheeler, D.D., LL.D., of New York, was
elected president of Allegheny College, at Meadville, Pa.,
on the 4th day of April. This action on the part of the
authorities will bring into this section a gentleman who has
reached a high position as an educator and a religious journalist.
In the Northwestern University, at Evanston, Ill.,
he distinguished himself by his abilities as a teacher, writer,
and preacher. He served for five years under President
Grantâs administration as United States Consul at Florence,
Italy. More recently he made a brilliant periodical
of
The Methodist
, in New York, which, though it
died, went down with its colors flying, and because no editor
could keep it alive. Dr. Wheeler is a local preacher,
and not in the regular order of the ministry. We congratulate
the friends of Allegheny College on his election, and
predict that under his administration the college will have
a new lease of life and be favored with renewed prosperity.

The Longfellow Memorial Association of Cambridge,
Mass., has received a letter from Mr. Bennock, in London,
which says that all the preliminaries for placing a bust in
Westminster Abbey are now arranged, sufficient capital
having been subscribed, the sculptor engaged, and the position
for the bust selected. The latter is a column standing
between the memorial niche of Chaucer and the Independent
bust of Dryden, with a full and uninterrupted stream
of light falling on the position, so that the bust will occupy
a central and conspicuous place in the poetâs corner.

The old school of statesmen are represented at Washington
by Senators John Sherman, of Ohio, Anthony, of Rhode
Island, and Bayard, of Delaware. Of the more recent and
vigorous school since President Garfieldâs death, are ex-Senators
Blaine, Windom, and Kirkwood, with ex-Senator
Conkling, who have retired to private life, while Senator
Edmunds is still recognized as a leader in the Senate. A
new generation of statesmen is gradually appearingâPresident
Arthur, Secretary W. E. Chandler, Robert Lincoln,
Frank Hatton, and others, no one of whom has been tried
except in routine duties. The new administration is one
of peace and quiet, but it is not vigorous on lines of reform.

President Arthur made a trip to Florida in April. This
is the first journey of any extent he has made from Washington
since his inauguration, and he is the first President
[480]

who has visited the Southern States so long and so extensively
since the war.

The trial of the PhÅnix Park murderers, in Dublin, commenced
April 9. The dynamite criminals in London will
be tried before a jury, perhaps before these lines go out from
the press, while in Washington the Star Route trial drags
its length along as a trial to patience, and for the humiliation
of every true American citizen.

The Committee on Public Education in the New York
Legislature, led by Mr. Abel Goddard, made a report on a
âDime Novel Bill,â recently, in these words: âAny person
who shall sell, loan, or give to any minor under sixteen
years of age, any dime novel or book of fiction, without first
obtaining the written consent of the parent or guardian of
such minor, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable
by imprisonment or by a fine not to exceed fifty
dollars.â Objection is made to this bill, that it is indefinite,
in that it fails to explain what a dime novel is, and
that we can not deal by legislation with the injurious influences
of any form of literature. In reply, it may be said,
there are more than forty thousand miles of railway in this
country from which the sale of certain pernicious publications
are excluded. Mr. Anthony Comstock and his co-laborers
have been explaining for several years what the âdime
novelâ is, and how injurious it has been to boy and girl
readers. This bill is a new ray of light on a dark subject.

Karl Marx, the father of modern socialism, has recently
died. He was a former correspondent of the New York

Tribune
, and the author of âCapital.â He has been expelled
from half the countries of Europe, and proscribed in
nearly all of them. The fruit of the seeds he has sown can
not now be told.

The motto of M. De Lesseps seems to beâexcavate. After
giving us the Suez Canal and beginning a scheme for linking
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, he tells us that Sahara
shall cease to be a burning waste, and be made to furnish
vapors and cooling winds; that the desert shall become a
sea. The project is not a new one, but has presented such
monstrous obstacles that no one but engineers of the wildest
imagination have contemplated it seriously. M. De Lesseps
announces that, let him have one hundred machines
of a power equal to one hundred thousand men, and the
work shall be accomplished. The scheme will be discouraged.
M. De Lessepsâs trip to Tunis has already been
called âa foolâs errand,â but when we see the mountain tunnelled,
the continents joined, the oceans about to join hands,
it is best to consider before we say that any project is impossible,
especially when M. De Lesseps is the engineer.

Apropos of the Panama Canal, the work is begun; ten
thousand men are there, and out of these but a few are sick,
thus largely disarming the statement that men can not
work there. It need not be feared that the international
squabbling will in any way interfere with the canal companyâs
work. The son of De Lesseps recently stated in an
interview that that canal company was simply a business
firm, and was there to dig the canalâall other questions
were for the nations to settle.

As wise and true a policy as has been advanced on the
Irish question, is contained in a remark by Lady Frederick
Cavendish, whose husband was murdered at Dublin. She
says: âI pray that neither the unspeakable greatness of my
sorrow nor the terrible wickedness of these men, may blind
either myself or any of the English people to the duty of
patience, justice, and sympathy, in thoughts, words, and
deeds, with regard to Ireland and its people at large.â

The greatest achievement of the telephone is talking over
the six hundred and fifty miles between New York and Cleveland.
To make the test complete, it was asked in New York
that something be read in Cleveland from the
Herald
of that
morning. Several items were read and written down at the
New York end of the line. A day or two following, on receipt
of the Cleveland paper, the items were compared and found
to correspond exactly. The wire used on this line is of recent
invention, composed of steel and copper, and remarkable for
its conductivity. This great enterprise has been accomplished
by the Postal Telegraph Company, who are finishing a line
from Cleveland to Chicago. By the time
The Chautauquan

for June is issued, New York will probably be able to
talk to Chicagoâone thousand miles distant.

The great statue of Liberty is affording the committee
some trouble. They have eighty thousand dollars with
which to commence the erection of the pedestal, but no engineer
has been found willing to undertake the work. The
statue weighs about eighty tons, and presents an enormous
surface to the wind, while its pedestal is not large.
How to secure it becomes a problem. The
American Architect

gives a method used in Japan for securing the light
pagoda towers. A pendulum is hung from the top of the
tower, and reaches nearly to the floor. This method was
used by Sir Christopher Wren in securing the spire of Salisbury
Cathedral, a heavy wooden framework being suspended,
free to swing in any direction. The
Architect
advises
a trial of this plan for the statue.

Julian Hawthorne has recently given us three inscriptions
for the modern novelists. They will be useful to many
others. Here they are: âBe cultured. Be cultured, ever
more be cultured. Be not too cultured.â

The Vanderbilt ball is said to have cost twice the amount
that the city of Moscow has devoted to the coronation of
the czar. It is not pleasant to reflect that the most prominent
feature in American social life is extravagance. âExtravaganceâ
and âfollyâ would have been proper words inscribed
over the Vanderbilt doorways that night.

In July the new postal order will take the place of the
expensive and inconvenient money order, while in September
we will be allowed to send a letter for two cents which
now costs us three.

Perhaps no recent story has caused more comment
among the young than Mrs. Burnettâs âThrough One Administration,â
recently finished in
The Century
. The story
follows the modern plan of leaving hero and heroine in a
hopeless, helpless state, and to all appearances perpetually
so. There can be no question about both the artistic and
moral value of such a
finale
. It is inartistic because unfinished;
immoral in influence because it leaves the impression
that the great end of life is human love, and that lost, all is
lost. We contend that the story is incomplete. The whole
plan of life, the teaching of individual and national history,
is that one thing taken from life another will be found to
fill the want. To teach through the medium of the novel,
and especially a novel so well written and captivating as
Mrs. Burnettâs always are, that the end is misery, is a wrong
to the young, and an argument against the school of novelists
to which this writer belongs.

Peter Cooper died in New York City on the 4th of April,
in his ninety-third year. Not since the death of Lincoln
has the city witnessed such general mourning. He has
been a man of great business ability, of mechanical skill,
of the broadest philanthropy. His business transactions
have been marked by the strictest integrity, his philanthropy
by unostentation. The greatest work of his life has
[481]

been the Cooper Union, where, free of cost, the poor may obtain
instruction in industrial arts. To this great institution
he gave $1,592,192, and quite as important, the best thought
and plans of his teeming brain. One can only appreciate
the wide-spread benefit of the Union when they know that
40,000 men and women have been fitted there for lives of
usefulness, and free of cost. His life and character were
above reproach, and present a type of what an American
man should be,âenergetic and successful, yet simple,
kindly, and noble.

The late Gustave DorÃ© frequently compared his head to
âa witchâs cauldron, always boiling and shooting up blue
flames.â Anybody who studies his illustrations of âDanteâs
Inferno,â and âThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,â will be
likely to agree with him, yet he was
the great genius
among
artists of his times.

John G. Whittier says that he is still one of those who
hope that the dreadful evil of intemperance may be checked,
and finally abolished, by legislative action. He believes in
the right and duty of the community to protect itself by
legal enactments, whenever there is a public sentiment
strong enough to enforce the prohibition of the liquor traffic.
âI despair of any direct assistance from politicians,â he
writes, âbut the great majority of the individuals composing
these parties have a moral sense that may be awakened into
action by precept and example.â Looking at the drinking
habits of New Englanders sixty years ago, and at the general
temperance among them at the present day, he sees
reason for the greatest encouragement.

The following items belong to Dr. Vincentâs page, C. L.

proper place:

âWe notice in the spelling of many Greek names of
our history,

EDITORâS TABLE.

Q. How long was the Long Parliament?

A. From October, 1640, to April, 1653.

Q. Which is the oldest town in the United States?

A. St. Augustine is said to be the oldest town. A fort
was built there in 1565. It is not known when Santa FÃ©
was settled by the Spaniards, though they visited it in 1542,
and the town was then a populous Indian pueblo; but the
actual settlement was not made until some time later.

Q. What is the exact area in square miles of Europe?

A. 3,733,008 square miles.

Q. Were the Kimmerian Kelts mentioned in History of
Russia for October the same as the Celts mentioned by Prof.
Sherman?

A. The latter tribe were of the Aryan race, and settled
England and parts of the continent. The origin of the Kimmerians
has never been decided. For further information
see the authority given by Mrs. Robinson.

Q. Who is the author of the German Reader and Grammar
used by Prof. Worman?

A. Prof. Worman is the author. Information concerning
text-books can be best obtained from himâAdelphi
Academy, Brooklyn, N. Y.

Q. What is the period of the moonâs revolution?

A. Her mean sidereal revolution is accomplished in
27.32 days; the synodical revolution, or lunar month, in
29.53 days.

Q. What legend or story has fastened the scallop, or
cockle-shell, as an accessory to the pilgrimâs dress, and
made it an emblem of St. James?

A. Pilgrims formerly went in great numbers to the tomb
of St. James, at Compostella, in Spain. They were often
poorly provided with utensils, and, as the adjacent sea shore
was covered with the scallop-shell, they gathered them to
use as spoons, cups, saucers, etc. Naturally, upon their return,
they carried the shell as a relic, often fastening it in
their hats; and thus it became part of a pilgrimâs outfit, and
the token of St. James.

Q. What is the best work on Florida?

A. A good work is âFlorida: Its History, Growth, Condition,
and Resources,â by S. A. Drake. Published by
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., Boston, Mass.

Q. What is the origin of St. Valentineâs Day?

A. It is said by some that St. Valentine was so lovable a
man that the custom of choosing valentines upon his festival
took its rise from his character. Others derive the custom
from a Roman fashion of placing the names of young
women in a box, from which they were taken by the youth,
by chance. This always was done during the festival of the
Lupercal, in February, and afterward the day fixed was the
14th of February. This account declares the connection of
the day with St. Valentine to be accidental.

Q. What is the meaning of the word fjord?

A. It is a Scandinavian word for arm of the seaâthe bays
or inlets extending into the land from the sea.

Q. Who was Froebel?

A. A German educator: born 1782, died 1852. The inventor
of the kindergarten.

Q. Pronounce CÅur-de-Lion; Hengist.

A. Kur-de-LÄ«Â´on; HÄngÂ´gÄ­st.

Q. Correct the sentence, âThe crafty king asked time to
consider of it.â

A. The crafty king asked time to consider the request.

Q. In the sentence, âIf it is time,â is the verb correct for
subjunctive mood?

A. It is not. If subjunctive, the sentence should read,
âIf it be time.â

Q. Are the âGolden Fleeceâ and âGideonâs Fleeceâ identical?

A. They are not. The Golden Fleece is said to have been
taken from a ram which Phryxos sacrificed to Zeus, in
Colchis. The fleece was given to the King of Colchis, and
afterward stolen by Jason.

Q. How came Greek to be the language of the New Testament?

A. At the time the New Testament was written, Hellenistic
Greek was used by most Jews, owing largely to the
number of Greek cities in Palestine. It was the language
of Christ and the disciples, and, naturally, the language of
the disciplesâ writings.

Q. What brought out the difference of the Greek language
that existed at the time of Christâs advent?

A. We suppose the question to mean what caused the difference
between the Greek of the New Testament and classic
Greek. As spoken by the Jews, Greek was modified by
Syro-Chaldaic, which had been spoken by them since the
Babylonish captivity. The changes were in orthography,
the spelling of words, introduction of new words, and in
rare and novel construction.

Q. Who are the Roumanian peasants?

A. The peasants of Roumaniaâa country consisting of
[482]

the Danubian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia.
The country contains about 200,000 gypsies who constitute
a large part of the peasantry.

A. Greece, âThe Iliad;â Rome, âThe Ãneid;â Italy,
Tassoâs âJerusalem;â England, âParadise Lost.â The
above are recognized as the chief epic poems.

Q. What is an agnostic?

A. One who professes to know nothing absolutely, neither
asserts nor denies; especially those who neither affirm nor
deny the existence of Deity.

Q. How much larger is the earth around the equator than
around the poles?

A. The equatorial diameter is 7,926 miles; the polar diameter
is 7,898 miles.

Sweden, but northeast of Lund, where TegnÃ©r attended the university.

P. 429, c. 2ââHaving but one name.â The use of fixed surnames
did not extend much farther back than the latter part of the tenth
century. They first came into use in France, and by the Normans
were introduced into England. The adoption of surnames by the
common people was much later than by the nobility, and similarly
the more remote and less highly cultivated districts were slower to
accept the fashion than more advanced nations; thus in some parts
of Wales it is said that surnames are not yet fully adopted. Prior to
the Reformation surnames were less fixed than now. Younger sons
particularly, dropped their patronymic and often, instead, adopted
the name of their estate or place of residence, as did TegnÃ©r.

P. 430, c. 1ââOssian,â oshÂ´yan. A Scottish poet, said to have lived
[483]

in the second or third century. The genuineness of his poetry is,
however, doubted. In the eighteenth century James MacPherson
claimed that he had translated fragments of Ossianâs poetry. He published
these, and soon afterward two long poems. These works
caused a fierce war between Scottish and English writers, the Highlanders
maintaining their authenticity, and the English disputing it.
The general opinion now is that they are to be classed with the literary
forgeries of the day, and MacPherson with Chatterton.

P. 430, c. 1ââRÃ¤men,â rayÂ´men. In the mountain region near
Filipstad.

P. 430, c. 1ââMyhrman,â mirÂ´man.

P. 430, c. 1ââMultifold.â A word derived from the Latin
multi
,
many, and the English fold; it signifies various, numerous.

P. 430, c. 1ââPatriarchic,â paÂ´tri-archÂ´ic. An adjective of the
same meaning as patriarchal,
i. e.
, belonging to a patriarch, or the
father of a family.

P. 430, c. 1ââHomerus,â Homer (Latin). The book was written
in Latin, still to a wide extent the language of learning.

P. 430, c. 1ââCastelio,â kÃ¤s-tÄlÂ´yo. A theologian, born 1515, died
1563. In 1540 he was invited by Calvin to Geneva, and became Professor
of Humanities. Unfortunately he afterward differed from
his patron in religious belief, and was expelled. He went to Basel,
where he lived in great poverty. Among his works is a translation
of the entire Bible into Latin.

P. 430, c. 1ââBasel,â baÂ´sel. A city of Switzerland lying in a canton
of the same name. Its history begins with the building of a fort
there by the Romans. In the middle ages it had become a flourishing
city, more populous than now, though it still numbers about
50,000 souls. Basel boasts many ancient works, among which is a
bridge built in 1226. It has a library of 50,000 volumes. The Council
of Basel was held there in 1431, and in 1795 two treaties were ratified
there between the quarreling European States.

P. 430, c. 1ââDialectic,â di
Â´
a-lectÂ´ic. The word dialect comes from
two Greek words signifying to pick out, to choose; hence it means
the form of speech chosen in a certain locality, or peculiar to limited
regions; in distinction from others nearly related.

P. 430, c. 1ââXenophon,â zÄnÂ´o-phon. A Grecian historian, general,
and philosopher, born about 445 B. C. He joined the expedition
which Cyrus the Younger undertook against his brother, the
King of Persia. Upon the defeat of Cyrus, the Greeks made their
famous retreat, Xenophon being their chief counselor. Upon his return
to Greece he began to write. His âAnabasis; or, Retreat of the
Ten Thousand,â is, perhaps, his best known work, though the âMemorabilia,â
or account of the acts and conversation of Socrates,
Xenophonâs former teacher, holds a high rank. Died about 355 B. C.

P. 430, c. 1ââLucian,â lÅ«Â´shan. A Roman satirist, living in the second
century. Born in Syria, he spent his life, until forty years of age,
wandering through Italy, Greece, and Gaul. In the latter country
he taught rhetoric with success. Returning to Syria he began his literary
work, which included histories, biographies, criticisms, poems,
satires, etc. As a satirical and humorous writer he ranks very high.

P. 430, c. 1ââHomer,â hÅÂ´mer. The greatest of all epic poets.
When he lived is unknown; critics have disputed his existence, but
the best authority of the times is opposed to this. Homer was probably
an Asiatic Greek, born at Smyrna about 850 B. C. His most

part of Italy was the birth place of the poet Horace. At eighteen
he was sent to Athens to study, as was the custom then. When the
civil wars, which followed the death of CÃ¦sar, broke out (44 B. C.)
Horace joined Brutus and Cassius. After their defeat he lost all
his property and was very poor until, through the influence of Varius
and Virgil, MÃ¦cenas became his friend. After this his wants
were provided for and he gave his time to his writing. His work
consists of two books of satires, one book of epodes, two of odes,
two of epistles, and a treatise on the art of poetry.

to leave the country. In 1743 the French Government sent him on
an embassy to Frederick the Great, with whom he became intimate;
but afterward, quarreling with his royal friend, he retired to Switzerland.
His belief was strongly infidel and his mind wonderfully
vigorous. The quantity and wide range of his writings are surprising.

famous of French dramatists. He began his career in Paris in 1662,

same meaning as phosphorescent, but not as yet accepted by lexicographers.

to seek its source entirely from within, or from the spiritâa kind of
transcendentalism.

P. 430, c. 2ââWhitsun Idyl.â A story of White-Sunday-tide, or,
contracted, Whitsuntide, the English name for the Pentecost. It is
so called from the white garments which were prescribed for those

P. 431, c. 1ââDiet.â An assembly or council. The etymology of
the word is probably the same as the word diet or food. Its peculiar

sense
is said to have risen from its being so similar to the Latin word
for day,
dies
. This word meant particularly a
set
day, so that diet
came to mean a day set for deliberation; or, an assembly.

P. 431, c. 1ââEmanating.â Flowing forth.

P. 431, c. 2ââRomantic era.â That period in the history of literature
in which the materials were drawn from the stories of the Middle
Ages, and from imagination. The ideal in distinction from the
real was treated, the beautiful and not the base, the fantastical and
wonderful rather than the practical and common. The name was
first used in Germany. Tieck and the Schlegels are considered the
founders of this school. An essay translated from Heine, and published
by Henry Holt & Co., gives a masterly analysis of the âromantic
school.â

P. 431, c. 2ââRealistic.â A school of literature holding principles
contrary to the romantic school. They contend that nature must be
followed in all cases and things represented exactly as they are.
Many of our first writers have followed these principles, though
many have treated life as though the only real part were the vice
and misery. The realistic school claims strength as its chief characteristic,
that is, a direct expression of facts and passions unchanged
by fancies or culture.

Franklin discovered the identity of electricity with lightning, and
proposed the plan of protecting buildings by pointed conductors.

P. 432, c. 1ââJack Falstaff.â A character in the first and second
parts of âHenry IV.â and in âMerry Wives of Windsor.â Many

Folstaffe, who is introduced into âHenry VI.,â but recent commentators
deny this. Others have said Sir J. Oldcastle to be the original.

the lives of the chief justices of England, and of the lord chancellors.

without male heirs, and Edward III., the son of Edward II., claimed
the throne through his mother, though the Salic law, by which
French succession was determined, denied the throne to women. In
no case could this claim revert to Henry, who belonged to another
family.

P. 433, c. 2ââBeaugÃ©,â bo-gÄ.

PHYSIOLOGY.

P. 434, c. 1âThe article on physiology needs few explanatory notes.
It is really a series of experiments, and if it be possible to use the illustrations
the subject will be found much more plain and interesting.
Much ingenuity is possible in arranging experiments. Any
specimen, large or small, may be made to contribute valuable information
in regard to the action of the muscles, the circulation of the
blood, and the process of digestion.

P. 435, c. 1ââCÄpÂ´il-la-ry,â or âca-pilÂ´la-ry.â The fine thread-like
end of a vein or artery.

the whole structure of heart, lungs and liver may be studied. By
cutting away the liver and spreading the lungs on the table with the
heart between them, you may soon understand the whole subject. A
beefâs heart will, of course, do as well; or a smaller subjectâs, as a
rabbit.

leaders of the Reformation; he was educated for the church, but becoming
convinced of its errors joined the Reformation. He was
driven from place to place by persecution. In 1536 was published
his âInstitutes of the Christian Religion,â in which he advanced the
doctrines of predestination, election, and reprobation. Afterward
he published a catechism and âConfession of Faith,â and in 1541 the
presbyterial system was introduced by him into the church at
Geneva. An important element of his work was teaching in the Geneva
Academy. Students flocked to him, and Calvinism spread

One public declaration of sentiments was made, but while
preparing for another conference Arminius died.

divine. At the time of the civil war he joined the parliamentary

a superior classical scholar. In 1727 he received the degree of Master
of Arts, and having become a priest of the Church of England, he
went, in 1835 as a missionary to Georgia, where he remained three
years. Upon his return, through the influence of certain Moravians,
he became convinced that a deeper religious experience was possible,
and after his conversion he became an evangelist. He organized the
first Methodist Society, in 1739, and for more than fifty years was its
leader. His energy and industry were perfect; he is said to have
traveled two hundred and fifty thousand miles in his itinerant ministry,
and preached forty-two thousand sermons. At his death
the society which he organized had five hundred and eleven ministers
and a membership of one hundred and twenty thousand.

P. 439, c. 2ââIdÂ´i-om.â Here signifies the mode of expression peculiar

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

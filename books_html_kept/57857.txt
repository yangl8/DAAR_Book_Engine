INTRODUCTION.

The Translator of âThe History of Antarâ
being out of England, it is not in the
Editorâs power to give to the reader much
preliminary information on the contents
or nature of the Epic Tale, which is now
for the first time in part submitted to the
European Public.

Antar is no imaginary personage. He
was the son of an Arab Prince of the
tribe of Abs, by a black woman, whom
his father had made captive in a predatory
excursion: and he raised himself by the
heroic qualities which he displayed from
his earliest youth, and by his extraordinary
[ii]

genius for poetry, from the state of
slavery in which he was born, to the confidence
of his king, and to a preeminence
above all the Chiefs of Arabia. He flourished
during the close of the sixth, and the
early part of the seventh century, of the
Christian Ã¦ra; there is, consequently, little
or no allusion to the customs or institutions
of Islamism throughout the work;
though the Hero is frequently designated
as âHe by whom God organized the
earth and the world for the appearance of
the Lord of slaves.â

The following Romance, as it may be
called, was first put together, probably
from traditionary tales current at the
time, by Osmay, one of the eminent scholars,
who adorned the courts of Haroun-al-Raschid,
and of his two learned successors,
Al-Amyn, and Al-Mamoun; and it
still continues to be the principal source
whence the story-tellers of the coffee-houses
[iii]

in Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, draw
their most interesting tales: but, notwithstanding,
its general circulation in the
Levant, the name of Antar is hitherto
only known to us in Europe, as that of
the Author of one of the seven poems, suspended
in the temple of Mecca, and from
that circumstance called,
The Moallakat
.

The Author of this poem, and the Hero
of our history, are identified, as well by the
similar names which occur; in both; as by
the insertion of the poem itself in the body
of the history, when, after much persecution
and opposition, Antar at length succeeds
in suspending the poem within the
Holy Sanctuary which surrounds the
Kaaba.

There is reason to believe that this is
the first attempt to transpose into an
European language, a real Arabian story,
depicting the original manners of the
Arabs of the desert, uncorrupted by the
[iv]

artificial and refined customs of the neighbouring
cities in Syria, Egypt, and Persia.

The characteristics of the real Arabs
or Bedowins are here presented in their
native simplicity. An eager desire for the
property of their neighbour; an unconquerable
fondness for strife and battle;
a singular combination of profuse hospitality,
with narrow economyâquick perceptionâdeep
cunningâgreat personal
courage, a keen sense of honour, respect
for their women, and a warm admiration
and ready use of the poetical beauties of
their unrivalled language.

The supposition of the learned orientalist
Mons. LanglÃ¨s, that the Thousand and
One Nights were originally composed in
the Pehlevi, or the old Persian, and from
that language translated into Arabic, appears
still more probable, when we observe
the rich and gorgeous descriptions of the
works of art and nature which abound
[v]

in them, their enchanted palacesâtheir
sultans and viziers, and all the attendant
magnificence of a court; their genii and magiciansâtheir
want of individual character
in the leading personages;âand when
we contrast with those details the simple
manners of the Kings and Chieftains of the
desert, pourtrayed in this Romance; their
rude tents; the familiarity with which they
live amongst each other, controuled only
by the rules of patriarchal authority;
the almost total absence of supernatural
agents; and above all, the striking distinctions
of character, which mark the
whole progress of the story. In this work
indeed, The Subordination of the warriors
and others, whether of high or low rank,
to the irresistible Antar; in undaunted
courage; in active prowess; in intellectual
acquirements; in public spirit; in the
ardour of his love; in the excellence of his
poetry; and in acts of private generosity
[vi]

and benevolence, is strictly consistent with
the best rules which the Critics have derived
from the Homeric writings, for the
conduct of the Heroic poem.

In an adherence to these rules indeed,
the early European writers of Romantic
Adventures, who followed the age of Charlemagne,
and to whom, perhaps, Antar was
better known than to their successors, did
not follow the steps of their prototype. But
whether he really deserve that appellation,
that is, whether from the frequent intercourse
between the Eastern and Western
kingdoms of the Roman world, in the
8th, 9th and 10th centuries, our Romance
writers imbibed their taste for the adventures
of Chivalry from this singular Tale,
is a question, to the solution of which we
may look forward, when the whole of it
shall be before the public. It may be observed,
however, that little more was wanting
in order to compose the Romances of
[vii]

the middle age, than to engraft on the
war, love, and courtesy of the Arabs, the
splendid and soft luxuries of the other
countries of the East, the witchcraft of
Africa, the religious fervour of the South
of Europe, and the gloomy superstitions of
the North.

The Editor abstains from adding any
further observations at present upon this
subject. It had been his intention to request
the indulgence of the reader for the oriental
phraseology which frequently occurs in
the following pages; but he prefers leaving
the public to form their own opinion, how
far the Translator has rightly judged, in
presenting a literal translation of his original,
by which the Arabic idioms might
be best preserved, rather than (by giving
to it a strictly English dress, and thereby
destroying its native freshness,) to have
been led into an indulgence of ornament,
which would have been equally remote
[viii]

from the nice refinement of the languages
of Europe, and from the copious simplicity
of that of the desert.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

ANTAR.

CHAPTER I.

Ishmael, son of Abraham, was the father of
Adnan, who had a son called Maad; and Maad
was the father of Nizar, whose four sons, Rebeeah,
Medher, Ayad, and Anmar, reigned over the Arabs
in great glory for many years, and their descendants
continued to flourish and multiply till they amounted
to twenty thousand horsemen, when disturbances
arising among them, they separated and migrated
from the valley of Mecca and the holy sanctuary,
and many of them settled in a spot called Ibreem-oob-mootemim,
which was the furthermost point of
Hijaz, and the first in the land of Yemen. And
they had a king called Rebeeah, a man much
respected and feared, and he was of the tribe of
[2]

Medher, a fair-raced people; and he had five sons,
the eldest was called Nayil, the second, Taweed,
the third, Mohelhil, the fourth, Medher, and the
fifth, Adee; and their father was a stout and intrepid
warrior, he conquered the whole country by his
bravery, and ruled over the wilds and the deserts.

Again the Arabs disagreed amongst themselves
and dispersed, and every division had its chief and
its leader. They carried away their property and
their camels, and among them was Harith, son of
Obad the Yashkirite, with the tribe of Yashkir,
and the chief Dibyan with the tribe of Dibyan, and
the chief Abd Shems with his tribe, and Jazeemah
with the tribe of Abs and Adnan, and Bahiej
with the tribe of Ghiftan; and it was Jazeemah,
King of the tribe of Abs and Adnan that attacked
Rebeeah, and having slain him, appointed Mohelhil
to succeed his father. But on the death of Mohelhil
all his cousins went away with their property and
camels, afraid of the surrounding Arabs, and settled
with the tribe of Abs and Adnan, and their chief
Jazeemah; and among all the Arabs there was no
government better regulated than his, for he was
experienced in all affairs, and had ten sons who were
all hardy lions, bold, endued with great bodily
strength, and in war they were unrivalled; they
courted battles and plunged into slaughter, and their
reputation was spread among the Arabs, and among
them were Amroo and Jancah, and Asyed and Zoheir,
[3]

and the rest of the ten brothers. But Amroo
was the eldest, and King Jazeemah hoped that
Amroo would reign at his death. But one day
Amroo went to the lake Zatool Irsad, early in the
morning, and with him was a slave called Nizah;
and Amroo had round his neck a chain of gold
studded with jewels and diamonds; and when he
came to the lake he stripped off his clothes, and
took off the string of jewels from his neck, and then
going down into the lake left them all with his slave.
When he sprang into the water and plunged in,
his body disappeared, and was borne away.

The slave perceiving that his master remained too
long under water, felt assured that his breath was
extinct; so he ran away to Jazeemah, and told him of
this dreadful catastrophe. He was in the deepest
grief, and he dashed his fist against his face for the
loss of his son Amroo. Over the whole tribe the
dismay was general, the affliction was universal,
and the lamentations deep. Many days and nights
they remained in this state, when at last King Jazeemah,
wishing to relieve his mind from his anguish,
went out to the chase, and whilst he was thus
occupied, lo! there appeared a fawn, which he
eagerly pursued; but as it launched into the waste
in full flight, he could not catch it. Still he hoped
to succeed; but at last it entered a forest abounding
in trees, and waters, and thickets, and Jazeemah
still pursued it. And whilst he was struggling
[4]

through the branches, behold a man quite naked
stood before him! He fled away in terror, fancying
that it was a dÃ¦mon; O King! exclaimed the man,
be not afraid, for I am thy son Amroo! If thou
art my son, cried the King, follow me and quit this
spot. Jazeemah issued from the forest, and the
man coming up with him, he gazed at him, and
lo! he was his son! He was greatly rejoiced, and
running up to him, O my son, said he, what has
happened to thee! who brought thee to this place?
and thou art naked! So he explained all that had
occurred to him, and the cause of his being snatched
away from the lake was a dÃ¦mon, who bore him to
this place. His father joyed in seeing him, and
clothed him in some of his own garments, and returned
with him to his tribe and companions, and
unbounded was the delight and satisfaction at the
return of Amroo. Acclamations were loud, and the
time passed happily away, and they forgot the evils
of fortune.

All the Arabs took refuge with King Jazeemah,
and paid him taxes and tribute, and there was not
one but obeyed him and submitted, save a single
Queen, who was called Robab. And this Queen
was very powerful, and had numerous armies and
slaves. She had subdued the heroes, and humbled
the bravest, and her tribe, was the most intrepid
of the Arabs, and they were called the tribe of
Reeyan. And when they heard that King Jazeemah
[5]

was become powerful and had extended his influence,
and that the Arabs gave him tribute in cattle
and camels; We, said they, will not give any one
even a ropeâs end, and whoever demand goods of
us, nothing will we give them but blows and battle.

Upon hearing this, Jazeemah assembled his
armies and warriors, and the Arabs came to him
from all the vallies and the waters, and he marched
away with them in quest of the tribe of Reeyan, and
their Queen Robab, that he might send down
destruction and torments upon them, and leave their
property to be pillaged by the Arabs. Now when
the tribe of Reeyan saw those armies that were advancing
upon them, they set up a loud shout, and
they thronged in haste from all quarters, and the
mountains trembled at the uproar. This tribe was
exceedingly numerous, and moreover, they had been
joined by a great multitude who came to them and
settled round them, to be under the protection of
that tribe and their Queen Robab; so great was her
reputation, and so far famed her name.

And when the armies arrived and were all
established about her, they waited in anxious
expectation of the event. So the Queen summoned
one of her tribe, a man of great consequence, and
said to himâI wish thou wouldst go to these advancing
people, and see what they are resolved to
do, what place they come from, and what they want.
The man went away; and when he came up with the
[6]

troops, they stopped. Whither in such haste? they
cried; speak ere thou art a lost man! Arabs, said
he, I am come as a messenger to ye; I want to see
your chief. Tell me what is your object; who are
you? how are you called? We are the noble tribe
of Abs, said they; and we are come to devastate
your lands, and plunder your property, and capture
your wives and families. Arab Chiefs, he replied,
shew me your King, lead me to him, that I speak
with him about the object of this expedition. They
accordingly introduced him to the King, and he
kissed the ground before him. Jazeemah asked
what he wanted, and what brought him there. So
he told him that Robab had sent him. O King!
he continued, what has brought thee forth from thy
country? What is the cause of thy departure from
home? He then informed him that he was come to
slay the people, and to plunder their property.
Mighty King! said the other, may God for ever
confirm thee in thy possessions! Why wouldst thou
act thus towards us? On account of your refractory
conduct towards me, said Jazeemah, and the language
I have heard; for all the Arabs have
submitted to my rule, and obeyed my call, and give
me tribute and taxes, all but you, ye cowards! and
I have heard of your base designs. But I must
assail you without further preparation, and I shall
command these armies, numerous as the locusts, to
assault you, and to grind you like grain, and to
[7]

ride you like lions. Return then to her who sent
thee, and tell her what I have said to thee.

So the messenger returned with this answer; and
when he reached Robab, he communicated all he
had heard to her. Away back to him, said she,
and tell him to-morrow morning to sally forth into
the plain, and to meet me in the field of battle
before these horsemen. If he subdues me, I will
submit to him and pay him tribute; but if I vanquish
him, I will grant him his life, and take his
ransom, and by this means we shall spare the lives of
the people, and be released from war and carnage,
and then return home to our country.

The messenger returned to King Jazeemah, and
informed him of the conditions Robab had proposed.
He agreed, and consented, and immediately he
came down to the field, and he was like a furious
lion; he galloped and charged before the warriors,
and rushed in to the scene of blows and thrusts.
Queen Robab dashed down on him, mounted on a
raven-coloured steed, strong-sinewed. She charged
with him over the plain till the horsemen were
amazed. Then they began the storm and bluster,
the sport and exertion, the give and take, the struggle
and the wrestle, and every eye gazed intently
on them, and every neck was stretched out at
them. Just then passed between them two matchless
spear-thrusts. King Jazeemahâs was the first,
so roused was he by the terrors and calamities that
[8]

threatened him. But when Robab beheld the spear-thrust
coming upon her, and that death was in it,
she bent herself forward till her breast touched the
horse, and the well-aimed thrust passed without
effect. She then replaced herself on her saddle, and
dashed furiously at him, and attacked him; she
struck him with horror, and drove the spear through
his chest, and forced out the point sparkling at his
back. He tottered from his horse, and his senses
were annihilated. Then the Arabs assailed one
another, and the earth shook beneath them. Blows
fell right and wrong, necks were hewn off, and
hoary beards were stained with blood. The struggle
was intense; and all the Arabs in those vallies
were in universal commotion, like so many Genii.

Soon fled the tribe of Abs and Adnan and all
their allies, and sought their homes and abodes in
fear of death and annihilation; neither did they
halt in their flight and rout till they reached their
own camp; and when they learnt the extent of their
misfortune, and how many kings and chiefs had
been slain, the lamentations were general. Calamities
struck them all; they threw down their tents
and pavilions; and thus they continued seven days
and nights, when King Amroo seated himself on the
throne of his father, and the Arabs came to condole
with him, and congratulated him on his kingdom.
But he lived only a short time, and when
he died his brother Zoheir succeeded him, and
[9]

reigned in glory and power. His authority was
universally acknowledged, and the Arabian tribes,
far and near, obeyed and feared him. His subjects
were happy under his dominion, on account of his
great influence, and chiefs hastened to testify their
allegiance. As soon as he was established on his
throne he resolved on taking his revenge, and for
this purpose he assembled his armies and auxiliaries,
and demanded the presence of all the Arabian
princes.

In a short time his troops were all prepared, and
immediately he set out on his expedition against
the hostile tribe of Reeyan and their Queen Robab.
He stopped not till he entered their country. As
soon as the Princess was informed of this invasion,
she called together her adherents, who came from
all parts and from the mountains; but they feared
for their families, and their wives, and their cattle
and camels. They marched eagerly to the conflict,
and delayed not a moment till they attacked the
tribe of Abs: they rushed forwards with the intention
to destroy them. The two tribes soon engaged.
Fierce was the combat and loud the clamour on all
sides. The battle raged; dreadful were the blows
of the sabre, and frequent the rush of darts and
javelins; numbers were wounded; every warrior
stood firm; but the cowards fled: patient were the
noble hearted, but the weak sought safety in flight.
Many drank the bitter poison of death. King
[10]

Zoheir encountered the queen of Reeyan on the
field of battle, whilst she was encouraging her
troops. The King furiously assaulted her, and
exclaimed, âRevenge for King Jazeemah.â He
then hurled his lance and struck her on the chest,
and forced out the weapon between her shoulders,
and again cried outâO by the noble Arabs! Their
only reply was a loud scream, and the battle still
continued. But when the tribe of Reeyan saw the
Princess dead, and perceived their attempts were
frustrated, they were alarmed. Then rushed forward
the tribe of Abs, and attacked them with
renewed violence. The Reeyanians were routed,
and fled towards their habitations;âthe Absians
pursued them, and spread desolation among them;
slew them with their swords, and dispersed them
amongst their wilds and deserts, until they reached
their country, where they took possession of their
tents and plundered their property. Zoheir returned
home and rejoiced in the execution of his
vengeance. He divided the wealth and lands of
all that belonged to his enemies among his own
people, and all the spoil was given to the rich and
poor, to his slaves and his chiefs. Many of the
hostile leaders were put to death: all the Arabs far
and near were terrified at the extent of his dominion,
and the power of his arm.

At this period the Caaba and the holy Mecca
were visited, as at this day. Numerous were the
[11]

pilgrims at the shrine of Abraham. Sacred were the
months of pilgrimage; and had a man even killed
his father at that period, his crime was never mentioned.
Zoheir, after he had accomplished these
glorious deeds, wished to make a pilgrimage;
which he executed, attended by all the chiefs of
his tribe. His admiration was great in performing
the ceremony of walking round the Caaba, and in
kissing the sacred stone. On his return home, he
was anxious to erect a building similar to the sacred
altar, whither pilgrims should resort, where travellers
might be entertained, and the hungry fed,
and the fearful be in security; in whose precincts
no beasts of prey should be chased; no blood
should be shed; and a transgressor of my law shall
be instantly put to death with this sword, he exclaimed.
These sentiments he expressed to his
tribe assembled in council. All were in dismay at
this resolution, but no one dared to disapprove or
make any answer. But an old Shiekh, who had
passed all his days in perusing ancient chronicles,
and was well acquainted with all the sayings of the
wise men, who acknowledged the unity of God, the
maker of the heavens and the earth, ventured forth,
and expostulated with Zoheir, telling him the Caaba
was the mansion of the blessed Abraham, and were
he to presume to imitate it, a cruel death would
avenge the insult; and thus he addressed him:â

âO great King, O Son of noble chiefs! hold and
[12]

listen to my words, and renounce the habits of
the ignobly born. Mount not the horse of
Outrage, for it will not rescue thee from the
messengers of Death: and soon mayest thou expect
him, shouldâst thou erect in the desert a
mansion like the sacred shrine of the Caaba
shouldst thou establish similar rites and ceremonies
and resemblances to Menah and Zengein and the
temple. Away, away, their land is the land of a
tribe superior to all mankind; and from them shall
appear a noted man, the prophet of God, the torch
of darkness, whose faith shall extend east and west
with the death bearing-sword of a noble warrior.
Away with what thou hast said, for thy God is swift
of vengeance.â

The King was not easily dissuaded, but at last
gave way to the argument of the Chief, and no
longer persisted in his resolution: he was moreover
induced to resign his plan in compliance with all his
Chiefs, who seconded the word of the Shiekh. In
this situation remained King Zoheir for some years;
when he became anxious to marry, and to take a
wife eminent for her beauty, and elegance of form,
and of a noble family. He made all enquiries on
the subject, and at last heard there was an Arab,
strong and mighty in arms, and a famous horseman,
called Amroo, son of Shedeed, and he had a daughter
whose name was Temadhur, whose equal was to
be found neither in the plains nor in the cities. Her
[13]

father was a severe man, and would let no one
address her, saying his daughter would not marry.
When Zoheir heard this, he longed for her as a
thirsty man wishes to have water. He pictured to
himself her perfections, before he had ascertained
her worth by enquiries. However, he did not send
to demand her in marriage, but made her father
some handsome presents, and evinced the greatest
fondness for him, making him one of his particular
companions, and thus gained his affections. He then
persuaded him to come and settle in his country
expressing his great love for him; and thus he
never ate or drank but in his society.

The excess of his passion increased daily, to such
a degree, that he resolved to assemble a party of his
followers called the tribe of Ghorab, and instruct
them to attack the family of Amroo, and plunder
his property, but not to kill any one, or do any
personal injury. So by this stratagem he expected
to discover Temadhur among his prisoners, and then
have an opportunity of speaking to her. The tribe of
Ghorab were accordingly ordered on this expedition,
and instantly they set out, in number five hundred.
Without difficulty they seized the property, took
Amroo prisoner with his wife and family, and
plundered his camels and cattle, but refrained from
slaying any one. When the King heard what had
happened, he mounted his horse in order to behold
what he anxiously desired. He found them in dismay,
[14]

expecting assistance from the tribe of Abs. The
family were looking at their flocks dispersed about,
but Temadhur was standing at the door of the tent,
blooming as the dawning sun, and her forehead bright
as its rays, and her cheeks were red as the piony,
her hair dishevelled, black as night. When Zoheir
saw this, his passion greatly increased; he cried
out, and instantly his people rushed forward and
furiously attacked the tribe of Ghorab: the women
fled, but Zoheir ordered Rebia, son of Jead, to hide
Temadhur under her veil, which was accordingly
done.

Thirty prisoners were secured belonging to the
tribe of Ghorab; they and their property were delivered
up; and when quiet was restored, the King
ordered a magnificent feast to be prepared, that he
might make merry with his tribe and followers. They
and the father of Temadhur soon assembled together,
and in less than an hour grief was converted into
joy; the wine was plentifully distributed, and the
uproar was great. The King soon became intoxicated,
and launched out into violent praise of Amroo
the son of Shedeed; and he ceased not to extol and
laud his deeds till the tears came into his eyes, and
the wine disordered his senses. Then Amroo got
on his legs and addressed Zoheir:âO mighty and
magnanimous King, I am your slave. My tongue
fails in description of your virtues. God has given
me nothing that I prize but my daughter Temadhur,
[15]

from whom I have kept all suitors. I request of ye,
assembled Chiefs, that he may accept her as his
handmaiden.

As soon as Zoheir heard this, he rejoiced and was
glad; and the Absians answered, and we too will
beg King Zoheir to accept her, and to cause the
daughters of noble chiefs to wait on her. As soon
as Zoheir heard these words, he leaped up, and
taking the old man by the hand, most earnestly
entreated him to consent. He richly clothed him,
and made him handsome presents, and then said,
She shall be, O Chief, equal to the most elevated
in rank, and highest in dignity. The marriage
canopy was instantly pitched, and there was no
further demur. The damsels advanced conducting
the concealed treasure. Her approach was at that
moment sweeter to him than sleep to the wearied
eyelids, and he beheld in her the stem of a tall reed,
and the rose of the soul. They were immediately
united; on the second day Zoheir arose and thanked
his fortune, irritated as he had been. He made
presents, and distributed the gold and silver, and he
made Amrooâs people remain with him, that he
might treat them for seven days, when he made the
marriage-feast, slaughtering camels and sheep.

The Kingâs surprise and delight made him so
vain and conceited, that at last he imparted to his
wife the stratagem by which he had obtained her
without a dower or settlement. When she heard
[16]

this, her soul revolted at the act. She was a shrewd
sensible woman, but she said nothing to him about it
all the next day; when intoxicated, he wished to caress
her, she repulsed him, and turning away from him,
saidâAre you not ashamed of what you have
done? Do you pretend to liberality and generosity,
and thus seize the daughters of brave men by force,
and refuse them a dower?

These words irritated the Chief greatly, and he
answered, I have not been so avaricious; I had
recourse to this violent act, because your father
yielded not to my proposals, and repulsed all suitors
from you. I had therefore no other means of
dealing with him but by this outrage; and you
know, that had your father accepted my proposals
for marriage at first, then you would have seen what
I would have given you, and the dower I would
have presented. You have confessed the deed, she
replied, and you have won me by force; this is the
work of violence; but we are indeed more cunning
than you.

As soon as Zoheir heard these words he was
greatly enraged, and his anger exceeded all bounds:
he rose from his bed and exclaimed, Where have
you seen any folly in me? and where, as you say,
are you more sagacious than I am? Be not angry,
O King, said she; know that he who speaks too
freely will often have a bitter reply, and he who
contemptuously treats women, will get into difficulties.
[17]

Know then that I am the sister of that woman
you beheld, so beautiful and fair; you have not
succeeded with her, and have not obtained possession
of her charms. She is more beautiful than the
sun and moon. I am not worthy to be her handmaid;
I do not possess a particle of her charms.
On the face of the earth there is not her equal:
amongst the daughters of Arabia there is not her
like. By your show of liberality you deceived my
father; he gave me to you; but my sisterâs name is
Temadhur, at the sight of whom every beholder is
amazed, and every heart is in raptures. But I am
called Khidaa; and between her and me there is a
vast distance, both in beauty and disposition; but
it is now too late: had you not done this, I would
not have informed you of what has passed.

The pleasing dream fled. How can I believe you?
said the King. If, said she, you wish to prove my
words, you have only to order some old woman to
go and look at my sister behind her veil, and then
the truth and mistake will be evident. No human
being can behold your sister, added he, but a merchant,
or a blacksmith, or an astrologer, or a
perfumer. You are right, she replied, for the
daughters of Arabia value the goods of a
merchant, a blacksmith, an astrologer, and a perfumer.
Then, said the King, there is no intelligence
like the eyes, and no sight like the hearing
of the ears. I am myself an Arab, and I must
[18]

undertake the business myself. I will execute all
that is necessary, and will go to your house in the
form of a perfumer.

He slept till the day dawned, when he said to his
attendants, If any one should demand admittance
to me to-morrow, say You cannot enter to day. He
undressed himself and took off his royal robes, and
habited himself as a poor man, and took with him
some perfumes and drugs; for he was greatly vexed
at what had passed. He departed from his tent, his
loins girt round, and his feet naked, and when he
was at some distance he quickened his pace.

But his wife Temadhur, as soon as the King was
gone, also rose, and threw off her veil, and putting
on the cloak of her husband, dressed herself as a
man, and leaving the tent, sought the tent of her
family. When she reached it she sent for her
mother, and her father, and her brothers, and told
them all she had heard from the King her husband.
When her father and brothers heard this, they were
greatly surprised at her cunning and her disguise.
She kissed her father, and said to him, Do you and
my brothers withdraw instantly and conceal yourselves
close at hand; and when King Zoheir
arrives and comes towards us, with his cloak-bag
over his shoulders, we will let him in and detain
him; do you also rush in, and instantly lay hold of
him, keep him fast, and do not let him go until
he makes good the marriage dower; or we shall
[19]

be a scandal among the Arabs. And if he abuses
you for this, tell him it is a return for his acts
towards us, and the disgraces his stratagem has
brought on your daughter. On this, they retired,
armed themselves with swords, and lay concealed.
Temadhur took off her manâs attire, and put on the
robes of a secluded female, and drew her veil over
her eyes, and blackened her eyelids with antimony,
and sat down, expecting Zoheir would arrive, conversing
in the mean time with her mother.

Zoheir soon appeared from amongst the tents,
and his eyes were like the eyes of a fox. Temadhurâs
mother cried out, Enter, merchant; have you
any perfumes that will suit my daughter? He
entered, and throwing down his cloak-bag off his
shoulders, and looking towards his wife, said, Are
the perfumes for this damsel? Yes, said she. He was
much confounded, but asked her name. She said,
Temadhur. He then asked, Have you any other
daughter? Yes, said she, her sister, whose name is
Khidaa; but when King Zoheir demanded her in
marriage, we did not consent to it, and so gave him
her sister. He knows nothing about it, but we
hope to marry her to one of the noblest chiefs.

The light became darkness in his eyes. He
thought within himself, verily I will carry off this
damsel, and her father and brothers shall die with
rage. And when he wished that they would choose
some of his drugs, that he might return, the father
[20]

and brothers rushed upon him like lions, seized
him, and bound him hand and foot. His wife stood
before him, and threw off her veil, and rejoicing in
her heart, O King, said she, what think you of your
situation and your artifices? Who of us is the most
cunning?

The King was in despair, and considered himself
as dead; but when he saw his wife, his life and
spirits revived. Well, said he, what do you intend
by this? Your disgrace for your acts towards us,
replied she, and your boast in having got possession
of me by fraud and deceit; and we swear by God
and Abraham, we will not let you go, neither shall
you see me yield to you, or listen to you, or obey
you, until you grant me a favour, and swear by the
Holy Zemzem that you will give to my father and
brethren your protection, and confirm my marriage
with a grant of camels and other beasts. Do this
immediately, or you shall for ever remain in durance.

When Zoheir heard what she said, he smiled at
what she had done, and was ashamed of his own
deeds. I will give you, said he, five hundred camels;
so now let me go. It is not enough for one hour
that I have been your wife, said she. I will moreover,
continued he, add five hundred high priced
camels. That, said she, will be even little for a
single day. If, O Temadhur, cried Zoheir, you
must reckon up every hour of each night, and each
day, and buy them as at a market, you will take
[21]

from me all my property, both my he-camels and
she-camels. Upon that she smiled, and let him loose,
and they settled the business between them,
viz.

that he should give them a thousand he and she-camels,
twenty horses, fifty male slaves, and fifty female.
To this he swore by the God of the holy
shrine of Zemzem and Mekam. They then went
to dinner, and he remained with them until dark,
when he returned with his wife, her father and
brothers in company until they came to his tent;
there they separated, King Zoheir retiring to his
wife; and as his love for her greatly increased by
reason of her conduct, he gave her vast possessions;
but no one knew what had happened to him, and
things remained in this state until she brought forth
ten sons, all like lions; of whom were Shas, Keseer,
Cais, Nakshel, Malik, Nooful, Harith, Khidash,
Warcah, Gandil, and afterwards one daughter,
who was Mootejeredah.

And it was a custom among the Arabs, that when
a woman brought forth ten male children, she
should be called Moonejeba, i.e. ennobled, and her
name be published amongst the Arabs; and they used
to say that the wife of such a one is ennobled. Now
Mootejeredah, the daughter of King Zoheir, was
the beauty of the age, and in wit and sense surpassed
all the daughters of Arabia. And Fatima, the
daughter of Hewseb, was also a Moonejeba, the
wife of Zeead, the son of Abdallah, and she also
[22]

brought forth ten sons; they were called Rebia,
Amarah, Ans, Hafiz, Talib, Ghalib, Dinrak,
Amroo, and Zitak. Thus the children of Zoheir,
and Carad, and Zeead, became the chiefs of the
tribe of Abs, and their noble leaders, particularly
the family of Carad, who consisted of Shedad,
Malek, and Zakmet-ool Jewad, who were all illustrious
warriors. King Zoheir was established in his
dominions, and all the Arabs and Kings of the age
obeyed him, and sent him presents from every
quarter. And the tribe of Abs passed their time
in plundering and killing the chieftains, till all
Arabia was overawed by their power, and all the
dwellers of the deserts feared them.

Now the narrators of this History, Asmael, and
Zoheinah, and Aboo Obeidah state, that ten horsemen
of the family of Carad quitted the country to
seek their fortunes, and among them was Shedad
the son of Carad, and he was called the Knight of
Jirwet, for his mare was called Jirwet, whose like
was unknown. Kings negotiated with him for her,
but he would not part with her, and would accept
of no offer or bribe for her; and thus he used to
talk of her in his verses:

âSeek not to purchase my horse, for Jirwet is not
to be bought or borrowed. I am a strong castle
on her back, and in her bounds is glory and greatness.
I would not part with her were strings of
camels to come to me with their shepherds following
[23]

them. She flies with the wind without wings,
and tears up the waste and the desert. I will keep
her for the day of calamities, and she will rescue
me when the battle-dust rises.â

The party set out from the land of Shuerebah;
the ten were all reputed warriors and famed horsemen;
they were all clothed in iron armour and
brilliant cuirasses; their object was to obtain horses
and camels. They continued their journey till
they entered the country of Cahtan: they lay concealed
all day, and only travelled by night. At
length they reached the mountains of Aja and
Selma; and there, between two hills, they discovered
a wealthy tribe, possessed of considerable property
and great riches; they were called the tribe of
Jezeela. Numerous were their tents, and their
dwellings, and their warlike weapons, &c., and the
camp was like the boisterous sea dashing its waves,
so numerous were their slaves, and attendants, and
their horses of various colours. It was a tribe under
no apprehension from the changes of fortune.

And when the Absians perceived their vast wealth
and prosperous situation, they feared to attack them,
so they accordingly quitted them and made for their
pasture ground, where they perceived a thousand
camels grazing, there being much grass in that spot,
and with them was a black woman, who was watching
them. She was uncommonly beautiful and well-shaped;
her appearance was elegant and striking;
[24]

and with her were two children, looking after the
camels and running about. As soon as the Absians
saw the camels, they attacked them, and hunted
them like hares with their spears, then drove them
away, together with the woman and children; yet
keeping in the rear, ready to attack whoever might
overtake them; and they had not gone far ere the
people came after them, crying out, Whither would
flight secure you, you wretches? here are we in
pursuit of you. Verily your feet have borne you to
your ruin and destruction. Upon this the Absians
fixed their spears, and gave the reins to their horses,
and met their assailants, pouncing down on them
like falcons. They stood firm of soul, and plied
their lances among them: blood flowed, and the
horsemen were stretched on the earth, where they
left them as carrion for the wild beasts of the desert.
The tribe of Jezeela fled, unable to resist the foe,
and retreated to their own country, their heroes
being slain and their property captured.

The Absians drove away the camels and cattle,
and returning home, they halted by the side of a
stream, in order to divide the property. But the
woman who was carried off with the camels had
made a great impression on the heart of Shedad,
and he longed for her in his soul; her form was
delicate, her eye inspired love, her smile was
enchanting, and her gestures graceful. As the poet
has said, âIn blackness there is some virtue, if you
[25]

observe its beauty well, thy eyes do not regard the
white or red. Were it not for the black of the mole
on a fair cheek, how would lovers feel the value
of its brilliancy. Were not musk black, it would
not be precious. Were it not for the black of
night, the dawn would not rise. Were it not for
the black of the eye, where would be its beauty?
and thus it is, that the black ambergris has the
purest fragrance.â He therefore took the woman,
and gave them the booty, that they might renounce
her. So he kept her to himself.

This womanâs name was Zebeeba, and the two
children were hers; the eldest was called Jereer,
and the youngest Shiboob. He remained with the
woman in the field, and the children tended the
flocks. Shedad visited her morning and evening;
and thus matters continued till she became pregnant;
and when her time came, she brought forth a boy, black
and swarthy like an elephant, flat nosed, blear eyed,
harsh featured, shaggy haired; the corners of his
lips hanging down, and the inner angles of his eyes
bloated; strong boned, long footed; he was like a
fragment of a cloud, his ears immensely long, and
with eyes whence flashed sparks of fire. His shape,
limbs, form, and make resembled Shedad; and Shedad
was overjoyed at seeing him, and called him
Antar, and for many days he continued to gaze on
him with delight. But when Zebeeba wished to
wean him, he grumbled and growled exceedingly,
[26]

and the corners of his eyes became fiery red, so that
he appeared like a mass of crimson blood; and this
was his condition till he was weaned. And he grew
up, and his name became known; but those who
had accompanied Shedad in the expedition, having
heard of him, all wanted to claim him as theirs.
So they all assembled and hastened to him, each
imagining he belonged to him, and gave him his
name; till at last they disputed about him, and
almost drew their swords, and would have fought,
had not respect for King Zoheir prevented them.
The circumstance soon reached the King, who
ordered them to his presence; and it happened on
that day that he had many guests with him at
dinner; and whilst they were sitting down, Shedad
and his companions came and kissed the ground
in the presence of the King. He asked them what
had happened, and what was the cause of the
quarrel. They then informed him, and related all
that had passed between Shedad and the woman in
their excursion; how he had taken her to himself,
and had given them the plunder; how she bare him
a son, whose shape and appearance resembled a
negro, and how they now all claimed the child as
their slave, because he was very stout and strong.

When Zoheir heard this adventure he was greatly
surprised, and he said to Shedad, I wish you would
produce the young slave that is the object of contention,
that I may see him. Upon that, Shedad
[27]

departed and brought Antar before him; and the
King beheld him, and lo! he was like a lion when
he roars. As soon as he saw him he gave a loud
scream, and threw a piece of meat at him; but a dog
that was there got before him, and snatched up the
meat like a hawk, and ran away. But Antar followed
him till he came up with him; he was greatly
enraged, and seized hold of him with all his
strength. He wrenched open his jaws, and tore
them in twain even to the shoulders, and snatched
the meat out of his mouth. When the King saw
this, he was astonished, and the Arab chiefs that
were present were amazed; and exclaimed, what ingenuity,
what power, strength, and ability! O my
friends, said King Zoheir, contend no more about
such a wretch as this! but if it is absolutely necessary
that this business should be decided, I must
refer you to the Cadi Bashar, son of Codhaâah the
Fazarean, let him give sentence on this point, and
settle to whom this slave belongs. Tell him the
story, for he is the Cadi of the Arabs.

When they heard King Zoheirâs remarks, they
instantly withdrew their hands from their swords,
and mounting their horses, went before the Cadi,
to whom they explained what had happened. In
fine, the Cadi decided that the child should be the
property of Shedad; for he was their leader, and
no one but him had any connexion with the woman.
You agreed to the partition, said he, and he affixed
[28]

his name to him; you have therefore resigned the
woman, and you took your share of the spoil and
plunder; besides, the child resembles Shedad.
Contend and be at variance no more, but return in
peace and quietness. Thus, as soon as the Arab
chiefs heard the Cadiâs sentence, they yielded; and
when they reached their homes, they passed their time
in friendship and comfort. Soon after, Shedad made a
separate house for Zebeeba and her children, and he
gave her whatever she wanted, and consigned over to
her charge her two children, and also gave her particular
injunction about her youngest son called Antar.

Now Antar was becoming a big boy, and grew
up, and used to accompany his mother to the pastures,
and he watched the cattle; and this he continued
to do till he increased in stature. He used to
walk and run about to harden himself, till at length
his muscles were strengthened, his frame altogether
more robust, and his bones more firm and solid, and
his speech correct. He then began to tyrannize
over boys of the same age, and beat his brothers;
and when he returned from the pastures he amused
himself with the servants and women, and he would
eat nothing but what he liked; and whoever
offended him he would thrash with a stick; till he
tortured him, and all the tribe were his enemies.
He used to employ himself in tending the flocks,
and as he conducted them, he wandered about the
deserts and plains, and loved solitude and retirement.
[29]

His days were passed in roaming about the mountains
sides, sometimes riding upon the dogs, by which
he acquired courage and intrepidity; and thus he
went on till he attained his tenth year. One day he
was wandering over the deserts with the flocks, and
when the sun was burning hot, he left his people
and climbed up a tree and took shelter from the
heat, whilst the flocks grazed, and he watched them;
when lo! a wolf started from behind the trees, and
dispersed them. But Antar seeing how the animal
had dispersed the herds, he descended and ran after
him till he overtook him, and struck him with his
staff between the eyes; he made the oil of his brains
fly out from between his ears, and slew him; he then
cut off his head and his legs, and returned growling
like an angry lion. And so thou wouldst devour
Antarâs flocks? cried he, addressing himself to the
dead wolf; but thou dost not know that he is a
savage lion. He put the head and legs into the scrip
he had with him; leaving the carcase, he returned
to the flocks, and thus spoke.â

âOh thou wolf, eager for death, I have left thee
wallowing in dust, and spoiled of life, thou wouldst
have the run of my flocks, but I have left thee
dyed with bloodâthou wouldst disperse my sheep,
and thou knowest I am a lion that never fears.
This is the way I treat thee, thou dog of the desert.
Hast ever before seen battle and wars?â

About evening Antar reached his dwelling; his
[30]

mother took the basket from him, and there she
saw the wolfâs head and legs. She was quite confounded,
but said nothing. She presented them to
Shedad, who only desired her not to let him stray
about. Do thou and he mind the cattle, and go not
far into the wilds, lest some foe meet thee. Zebeeba
promised obedience to the words of her lord, and
the next day she departed with her three children
to the pastures, whither they drove the herds to
graze among the plains and the hills. But Antar
rode about the country on the horses, and obtained
strength and agility by the exercise; he drove them
over the steeps, hurling his reed spear at the trunks
of the trees; and his mother concealed these circumstances
from his father, fearing he would beat him
or kill him. It was thus he became bold and hardy;
his limbs were robust, his bodily powers increased,
and his mind was improved by courage and intrepidity.
And when a camel would stray away, he
would cry out and make it stop, and he would
struggle with and subdue the mightiest of the herds;
and when he seized one by the tail, he tore it off;
and when they resisted him, he would strike them
on the back of the head, or tear open their mouths;
and, thus he continued his feats till all the servants
were afraid of him, and every one far and near
dreaded him.

Now King Zoheir had two hundred slaves that
tended his herds of he and she-camels, and all his
[31]

sons had the same. Shas was the eldest of his sons,
and heir to his possessions, and Shas had a slave
whose name was Daji, and he was a great bully.
Shas was very fond of him on account of his vast
bodily strength; and there was not a slave but
feared him and trembled before him: Antar however
made no account of him, and did not care for
him. One day the poor men, and widows, and
orphans met together and were driving their camels
and their flocks to drink, and were all standing by
the water side. Daji came up and stopped them all,
and took possession of the water for his masterâs
cattle. Just then an old woman belonging to
the tribe of Abs came up to him, and accosted
him in a suppliant manner, saying, Be so good,
master Daji, as to let my cattle drink; they are
all the property I possess, and I live by their
milk. Pity my flock and cover my nakedness; have
compassion on me and grant my request, and let
them drink. But he paid no attention to her demand,
and abused her. She was greatly distressed and
shrunk back. Then came another old woman and
addressed him, O master Daji, I am a poor weak
old woman, as you see; time has dealt hardly with
me, it has aimed its arrows at me; and its daily and
nightly calamities have destroyed all my men. I
have lost my children and my husband, and since
then I have been in great distress; these sheep are
all I possess; let them drink, for I live on the
[32]

milk they produce. Pity my forlorn state; I have
no one to tend them, therefore grant my request,
and be so kind as to let them drink.

As soon as Daji heard these words, and perceived
the crowd of women and men, his pride increased,
and his obstinacy was not to be moved, but he
struck the woman on the stomach, and threw her
down on her back, and uncovered her nakedness,
whilst all the slaves laughed at her. When Antar
perceived what had occurred, his pagan pride played
throughout all his limbs, and he could not endure
the sight. He ran up to the slave, and calling out
to him, You bastard, said he, what mean you by
this disgusting action? Do you dare to violate an
Arab woman? May God destroy your limbs, and
all that consented to this act.

When the slave heard what Antar said, he
almost fainted from indignation; he met him, and
struck him a blow over the face that nearly knocked
out his eyes. Antar waited till he had recovered from
the blow, and his senses returned; he then ran at
the slave, and seizing him by one of the legs, threw
him on his back. He thrust one hand under his
thighs, and with the other he grasped his neck, and
raising him by the force of his arm, he dashed him
against the ground. And his length and breadth
were all one mass. When the deed was done his
fury was unbounded, and he roared aloud even as
a lion. And when the slaves perceived the fate of
[33]

Daji, they shrieked out to Antar, saying, You have
slain the slave of Prince Shas! What man on earth
can now protect you? They attacked him with
staves and stones, but he resisted them all; he
rushed with a loud yell upon them, and proved himself
a hardy warrior, and dealt among them with his
stick as a hero with his sword.

Now among the sons of Zoheir there was one
whose name was Malik, and because he was of a
mild and gentle disposition, he was beloved of men
and women; and his father Zoheir adored him for
the sweetness of his temper, and gentleness of
his conduct. It so happened that on this day he
went out with a numerous train to hunt, and passing
that way he heard some confused cries, and
perceived a great dust. On approaching the place,
he observed a number of slaves surrounding one
man, whom he discovered to be Antar; the blood
streamed from all parts of his body from the blows
they struck him with sticks and stones; yet he was
determined to die sooner than give way. When the
Prince saw this, his eyes filled with tears, and in pity
he cried out, God prosper thee for a noble slave;
how hard are thy blows, how vast thy power! and
then, addressing the slaves, he said, Accursed be
your fathers, and your abandoned mothers! Do you
not fear the punishment and condemnation of every
one far and near? Why have you collected in such
numbers, and all conspired against one poor fellow,
[34]

and thus to vent your fury on one much younger than
yourselves? Away, or I will destroy you all, both high
and low, with this sword. He then went to Antar, to
learn what was the matter, and he heard him growling
like a furious lion, and repeating these verses.

âO my soul! strive not to fly, thou cansât not
escape when death seeks thee; death is predestined;
it will come in some shape or other. Endure then
with the patience of one nobly born. Fly not from
the fears of death, or thou wilt remain scorned
among the Arab chiefs.â

The Prince desired Antar to explain the business,
which he did, and told him all that had happened
between Daji and the old woman; how he had struck
her, and thrown her on her back; how he had
uncovered her person, and made the people laugh at
her. I then came up to prevent him; he struck me
in the eye and nearly killed me; but I seized him with
my hand, and dashed him against the ground. I
broke his bones, and then his slaves attacked me,
and wanted to seize me in revenge; but I thought
proper to defend myself: had you not arrived I
should have been killed.

When Prince Malik heard this, his admiration
of Antar increased, and he was convinced he was a
hero, and that there was not such another alive.
Walk by my side, said he, I will protect you against
every one that exists under the heavens, against all
who eat bread and drink water. Antar bowed down
[35]

before him and kissed his feet in his stirrup, and
walked on with the slaves. But when they came
nigh the tents, there appeared his brother Shas; in
his hand was a flaming sword, and under him
a steed swifter than a cloud when it rains, and his
bosom was charged with fury and indignation, and
he was about to slay Antar. When his brother
Malik saw him, he was aware if he did not keep him
away from Antar, he would injure him. How is it
I see thee so disturbed? said he. Know, said Shas,
this accursed Antar has killed my servant, and I
am come to cut his body in pieces with this sword.
You must not touch him, said Malik; he who dares
to oppose him is a dead man. I have given him my
protection; I will not be separated from him; sooner
will I forfeit my head.

Shas took no notice; but fixed his eyes on Antar,
who was walking by the side of his brother. He
no longer heeded his brother; but ran at Antar,
that he might put him to death with tortures.
Then too, Prince Malik was enraged; he drew
his sword from the scabbard; the two brothers
soon became so violent that their disputes would
have ended in a battle, had not King Zoheir, who
had been informed of what was passing, instantly
joined them. Malik was abashed in the presence
of his father, and Shas also quitted his brother.
O my son, said Zoheir, give this slave to me and
to your brother Malik, and I will in lieu of him
give you ten of mine. Upon that, Shas retreated
[36]

in shame from the presence of his father. Why did
you kill my sonâs servant, said Zoheir to Antar, and
thus disgrace him? and Antar wept at these words:
he related what had occurred, how the servant had
thrown the woman on her back, and rendered her
an object of derision among the servants. The King
assured him he approved of his conduct, and turning
towards the Chiefs about him, This valiant fellow,
said he, has defended the honour of women; he will
shine a noble warrior, and destroy his opponents; and
then looking at Shedad, your sonâs conduct reflects
credit on you; he added, his behaviour will remain
as a memorial to all generations; he has loathed
oppression and violence, and has followed the path of
propriety and virtue.

Shedad on that day, when in the presence of the
King, was much alarmed about his slave Antar,
because he was considered as compromising all
about him. Take away your son, said Zoheir to
him, I give him to you; take care of him until I
demand him of you again, and be not at all annoyed.
From that day both King Zoheir and his son Malik
conceived a great affection for Antar, and as Antar
returned home, the women and their daughters all
collected round him to ask him what had happened;
amongst them were his aunts, and his cousin, whose
name was Ibla.

Now Ibla was younger than Antar, and a merry
lass; she was lovely as the full moon, and perfectly
beautiful and elegant. She frequently joked with
[37]

Antar, and was very familiar with him, as he was
her servant. As soon as she came up to him on that
day, O you base-born, she cried, why didst thou kill
the slave of Prince Shas? who can now protect thee
from him? Indeed, my mistress, he replied, I did no
more than he deserved, for he had insulted a poor
woman; he threw her down, and made the servants
laugh at her. Thou hast acted most properly, said
Ibla, smiling, and we are rejoiced that thou art safe,
for thou knowest our mothers consider thee as their
son, and we look on thee as a brother, on account
of thy services. On this the women and girls
left him.

Now it was always Antarâs business to wait upon
all the women of the family of Carad, after he had
finished his duty towards Semeeah, his father Shedadâs
wife, whose attendant he was. It was a custom
among the Arab women at that period, to drink
camelâs milk both morning and evening; it was the
servantâs office to milk it, and cool it in the wind.
Now Antar always performed this office for Semeeah,
Shedadâs wife first, and then for his aunts,
the wives of his uncles Zakmet-ool Jewad and Malik,
and for Ibla, the daughter of the latter. He continued
to execute this service for a long time; but
one day he entered the house of his uncle Malik,
and found his aunt combing his cousin Iblaâs hair,
which flowed down her back, dark as the shades of
night. Antar was quite surprised, but Ibla ran
[38]

away as soon as Antar had entered and seen her, as
her sable locks waved to the ground behind her.
This increased Antarâs astonishment; he was greatly
agitated, and could pay no attention to any thing;
he was anxious and thoughtful, and when by himself
burst forth into the following strains,

âThat fair maid lets down her ringlets, and she is
completely hid in her hair, which appears like the
dark shades of night. It is as if she were the
brilliant day, and as if the night had enveloped her
in obscurity. It is as if the full moon was shining
in its splendour, and all the stars were concealed
by its lustre. Her charms bewitch all around her,
and all are anxious to offer their services; they
live in her beauties and loveliness, and they are
imbued with sweetness from her perfections, and
receive new spirit from her graces. Revile me not
for my love of her, for I am distracted for her,
and live but as the victim of my love. I will
conceal my affection in my soul till I can see
that I am sufficiently fortunate one day to serve
her.â

Antarâs anguish daily became more oppressive.
It now happened to be the time of the pilgrimage to
the holy shrine, and the worship of their idols; and
the women and children being left behind in the
camp, the warriors and chiefs came out for the feast
at a spot called Zatool Irsad, whence they departed
for the sacred place. Accordingly they all met, and
[39]

the children sung and danced. Ibla was amongst
them, richly dressed, playing and singing amongst
her companions. She was decorated with necklaces
and jewels, and her countenance was brilliant and
bloomingâmore dazzling than the rays of the sun.
When Antar saw her in all her beauty and loveliness,
he was overwhelmed with surprise, his tears
flowed, and he thus addressed her in verse:

âThe lovely virgin has struck my heart with the
arrow of a glance, for which there is no cure.
Sometimes she wishes for a feast in the sand-hills,
like a fawn whose eyes are full of magic. My
disease preys on me, it is in my entrails. I conceal
it; but its very concealment discloses it. She
moves; I should say it was the branch of the
Tamarisk that waves its branches to the southern
breeze. She approaches; I should say it was the
frightened fawn, when a calamity alarms it in the
waste. She walks awayâI should say her face
was truly the sun when its lustre dazzles the beholders.
She gazesâI should say it was the full
moon of the night when Orion girds it with its
stars. She smiles, and the pearls of her teeth sparkle,
in which there is the cure for the sickness of lovers.
She prostrates herself in reverence towards her
God; and the greatest of men bow down to her
beauties. O Ibla! when I most despair, love for
thee and all its weaknesses are my only hope.
Should fortune or my father assist me, I will
[40]

requite myself for its vicissitudes by my fearless
spirit.â

When Ibla heard from Antar this description of
her charms, she was in astonishment; yet she still
continued to amuse herself and converse with her
companions. Before the feast was over he was violently
in love with her, and his affection completely
overpowered him. On the next day he came as
usual with the milk; but his heart and soul were so
pre-occupied and troubled, that he offered it to
Ibla before Semeeah, his fatherâs wife; for his feet
went where his heart was interested. Ibla took the
cup from him and fascinated him by her charms.
Semeeah was very angry, and determined to complain
of him to his father; but Antar continued in
this state for days and nights, his love and anguish
ever increasing.

A short time after, a slave called Zajir, who belonged
to Rebia, the son of Zeead, came to Shedad;
O master, said he, your slave Antar does nothing
but injure your property: he ranges about the
country, and all day long he keeps the cattle away
from the water and the pastures, riding and driving
them about, and reducing their flesh by incessant
exercise, and injuring the trees by spearing them;
and when I order him not to do so, he abuses me
and beats me, and were I to go near him he would
kill me. This made Shedad very angry. You tell
me the truth, my boy, he replied, for from the
[41]

time I have directed him to tend my herds, they do
not get fat, but have ulcers in their feet; and this is a
proof that he rides them and drives them about the
rocky places, and thus they lose their flesh.

As soon as Semeeah heard this, she sought to
punish Antar, and told Shedad what had occurred;
and complained that Antar had offered the milk to
Ibla before her. This added to the anger which Shedad
already felt in his heart, but he waited patiently
till Antar returned from the pasture; he then seized
fast hold of him, tied him up, and beat him with a
stick till he took the skin off. His mother saw all
this, but did not dare to speak to her master, not
knowing the cause of this cruel treatment, but she
afterwards enquired of other women, who told her
that Zajir had complained of him, and that Semeeah
also had complained of his having served the milk
to Ibla before her. Zebeebah treasured up all this
in her mind till the morning, when she went to
Antar, and told him the whole matter, how Zajir
had complained of him, and that Semeeah had stated
that she had been served with milk after Ibla. O
my son, said she, henceforward take care not to
offend her, but execute the office properly; and
moreover, do not cast thine eyes on Ibla, for she
will be thy ruin. No sooner had Antar heard this
than he struggled with the cords that bound him,
and bursting them, started forward like a lion, and
in wrath exclaimed in verse:

[42]

âThis day will I slay Zajir, the accursed infamous
slave. I will leave him in the middle of the
waste, a prey for the devouring beasts. When he
is gone, my heart will be at rest, and my soul will
be appeased. Who told him to trouble himself
about this business, and to endanger me? If I do
not haste to the desert to slay him, my heart will
never be at rest, nor my eyes ever sleep.â

Then went he forth in search of Zajir; he found
him in the pastures. Thou base-born, he cried,
thou son of an uncircumcised mother thou instigated
my master to beat me. He said no more, but
seizing him by the small part of his belly, raised
him up, and dashing him on the ground, smashed
his bones to pieces. When he beheld him dead, he
recovered himself, and began to be alarmed; so he
went to the house of his friend Malik, the Prince
who relieved him when he slew the slave of his
brother Shas, and informed him of what had passed.
The prince was astonished, but quieted his fears,
promising to get him out of the scrape. He left
him sitting in the tent, and went to the habitation
of Rebia. On his arrival he only found the women
of the family; he enquired for Rebia; they answeredâHe
is gone by invitation to your fatherâs.
Immediately he repaired to his fatherâs house, and
the matter was just as he wished; for on his entering
he observed the Chiefs of the Absian tribe, all
seated, and the family of Zeead and Rebia standing
[43]

with their slaves and attendants close to King
Zoheir. He entered, and made his salutation; and
as no one was seated, but all standing, Rebia said
to him, sit down in your place, for we are all standing
up because you continue so. Do you wish I
should sit down? said Malik; and do you love me?
Yes, said Rebia, by the lives of all that are present.
Then, replied Malik, I will not sit down till you
have given me your slave Zajir. What makes you
so anxious, said Rebia, to have him? Because, said
Malik, I have observed him to be a good hard-working
slave, and very laborious in doing his duty. Sit
down then, said Rebia, I will give him to you, and
if you wish, two more with him. Let all these assembled
Chiefs be witnesses to what you say, said
Malik. Yes, said Rebia, let the God who raised
the vaulted heavens, and levelled the expanded
earth, witness my grant to you, and that I will
never tell you of the favour rendered. Be witness
to it, O ye that are present, said Malik. Know
then, O Rebia, that Antar has killed your slave, and
has sought my protection; do not therefore seek his
life.

When Rebia heard this, his affection was cooled,
and he was very indignant; he hid his head, and
felt ashamed before his assembled associates: great
was his wrath; and from that moment he cherished
in his heart a violent hatred against Antar. King
Zoheir then asked his son what had induced Antar
[44]

to kill the slave, and what was his intention and object?
Malik related all that had passed. The King
smiled, and soothing the heart of Rebia, gave him
two strong healthy slaves, and he was pacified.

When the slaves heard what Antar had done,
there was not one but feared him; and as soon as
the assembly had eaten and drank, they departed,
and in the evening Malik returned home rejoicing
in the good tidings that he brought. He filled the
heart of Antar with gladness, and placed victuals
before him; they slept the whole night together,
and Antar repeated the following lines in praise of
the Prince.

âO thou, on whose lofty spirit, my hope, to the
exclusion of all the universe, depends! My anxieties
have weighed on thee, and my troubles have
been a burthen to thy noble mind! Thou hast
granted me favoursâthou art my only refuge. O
thou who hast rescued me from my death, and my
perdition, all my life will I thank thee, till my
bones disappear in the earth.â

[45]

CHAPTER II.

Thus matters proceeded with Antar and Prince
Malik; but the anger of Shedad was only augmented;
at last he complained to his brothers
Malik, and Zakmet-ool Jewad, saying, O sons of my
father, and mother, my soul is greatly vexed, and
my anxiety is redoubled, and I know not what to
do, or what will be the consequence of the actions of
this black slave. I fear that to-morrow he will
destroy some one of rank and power, and some disturbance
arise throughout the whole tribe, and our
blood will be demanded and our persons pay the
forfeit. O my brother, said his brother Zakmet-ool
Jewad, thou hast hit the mark, and if thou dost
not take measures to put this slave to death,
he will certainly endanger our lives. However
wise a man may be, he is no match for him; but
after what has happened, we can never let him take
our camels and cattle to the pasture; we must,
waylay him and kill him, and thus let us relieve
ourselves from this misery. Let us wait
till he goes to the meadows, and there let us
destroy him in some secret spot; and when we
have effected our purpose, we will return. Shedad
approved his brotherâs advice, and resolved to
[46]

execute it. In the morning Prince Malik came to
the tent of Shedad, and interceded for Antar;
Shedad acquiesced, and let him tend the cattle in
the meadows; and forgot him for a time.

But one morning Antar went as usual with the cattle
to the pastures, and they followed his steps, seeking
to kill and destroy him. On that day Antar was
riding about in the wide plains and deserts, and
finding himself alone, he recited some verses in
praise of Ibla; he wandered far from the habitations,
and thought of his misfortunes; fast flowed his
tears, for the night before he had dreamt of Ibla,
and that he had kissed her within her veil. He then
addressed her in these verses:

âIblaâs spirit appeared to me in my sleep, and
thrice I kissed her within her veil. It bade me
adieu, but it deposited in me a flame that I feel
burning through my bones. Were I not left in solitude
alone, and could I not quench the fire of my
passion with tears, my heart would melt. But I
do not complain, though all my fears are on thy
account, O thou perfect full moon! O daughter
of Malik, how can I be consoled, since my love
for thee originated from the time I was weaned?
but how can I ever hope to approach thee, whilst
the lions of the forest guard thy tent! By the truth
of my love for thee, my heart can never be cured
but by patience. O thou noble maid! till I exalt
myself to the heights of glory with the thrusts of
[47]

my spear, and the blows of my sword, I will expose
myself to every peril wherever the spears
clash in the battle dustâthen I shall be either
tossed upon the spear heads, or be numbered
among the noble.â

He went galloping in different directions till he
came to a plain called the plain of lions, and here were
many ferocious animals and wild beasts. Here he let
the cattle graze, and Antar only came to this valley,
because he knew there was in it abundance of
grass of the height of a man. Now not a servant of
the whole tribe of Abs would ever enter or approach
this valley, because it was very extensive, and filled
with lions and tigers. As soon as Antar found himself
in it, he said to himself, perhaps I shall now find a
lion, and I will slay him. Thus, whilst the cattle were
feeding, and he from a mound was looking round on
all sides, behold, a lion appeared in the middle of the
valley; he stalked about, and roared aloud: wide
were his nostrils, and fire flashed from his eyes: the
whole valley trembled at every gnash of his fangsâhe
was a calamity, and his claws more terrific than the
deadliest catastropheâthunder pealed as he roaredâvast
was his strength, and his force dreadfulâbroad
were his paws, and his head immense. As
soon as he appeared in the valley, the cattle scented
him and fled away in terror, and the camels were
dispersed to the right and the left. No sooner did
Antar perceive this extraordinary movement, than
[48]

he descended into the valley that he might observe
what was the matter, brandishing his sword. He
there saw the lion, terrible in his strength, and
lashing his sides with his tail. Antar cried out to
him, and the mountains re-echoed to the cry.
Welcome, thou father of lionsâthou dog of the
plainsâthou foulest of the wild beasts of the deserts.
Now then, thou wilt exert thy power and thy might,
and thou wilt pride thyself in thy roar; for no doubt,
thou art the monarch and ruler of the brute creation,
and all obey thy commandsâbut, return to filth and
contempt, thou meetest now no ordinary man. I deal
death to the bravest, and render children orphans.
Dost thou think, foul-mouthed beast, now about
to die, that thou canst frighten me with thy roar
or alarm me with thy bellow? I will not condescend
to slay thee with an arrow or a sword, but I will
make thee drink of the cup of death from my single
arm; and as he rushed towards him, he addressed
him in verse.

âI am the far-famed lion, the warrior whose exploits
every one fears on the day of wars. I save, I
protect the property of my father Shedad, and I
punish the foe with the edge of my sword. When
my hand wields the scimitar on the day of battle,
every heart of the horsemen throbs with fear.
Now will I meet thee in the waste, and make thee
drink a cup of the vicissitudes of fortune. I heed
not death when I meet him, and I comprehend
[49]

what every tongue can express. Now then I
will throw my sword out of my handâaway then
with theeâand I will destroy thee, thou dog of
the desert, with my hands alone.â

Just at that moment Shedad and his brothers
came up to kill Antar. They saw him address
the lion, and heard what he repeated: he sprung
forward, and fell on him like a hail storm, and
hissed at him like a black serpentâhe met the
lion as he sprang, and outroared his bellow; then,
giving a dreadful shriek, he seized hold of his
mouth with his hand, and wrenched it open to his
shoulders, and he shouted aloudâthe valley and
the country round echoed back the war: he
stuck to him until he was dead, and then dragged
him by the legs without the valley; and having cut
down some wood, he took out his Zanad (wood to
make a light with), struck a light, and made a fire.
He waited until it blazed; he then ripped up the lion,
took out the entrails, and cut off his four legs, and
threw them into the fire; and when he perceived they
were roasted, he took them out and ate thereof till he
finished it; he then ran to a fountain and drank till
he was satisfied; and having washed his mouth and
hands, he went to a shady tree, where he put the
lionâs head under his own as a pillow, and wrapping
up his head in a part of his sleeve, he fell asleep.
His father and uncles were observing him and his
actions, and as they saw all he did, they were quite
[50]

terrified and scared. Verily this slave, said Zakmet-ool
Jewad, has not his equal; no one in his senses
would engage him. Malik also trembled. What
shall we do with this wretch? said he. Great indeed
has been the deed he has done; none of us can harm
him; he would soon destroy us and tear out our
entrails, or do as he has done with the lion. Let us
return home, said Shedad, our honour still remains
safe, we must find some other means to kill him and
accomplish our wishes.

Thus Shedad and his brothers returned home,
all in astonishment at Antar, and the wonders he
had performed. In the evening, when Antar came
with the flocks and the camels, Shedad smiled upon
him and gave him a cordial welcome, and made him
sit down with him at dinner, whilst the other slaves
stood up. And whilst they were all talking, there
came a messenger from King Zoheir to Shedad.
King Zoheir demands your presence, O Chief, he
cried; he has sent me to require you to take with
you your warlike weapons, and your brothers, for
he is engaged in a business of importance, and
wishes to attack the tribe of Temeem, and has resolved
on invading their country and destroying
their territory. Shedad on hearing this immediately
complied, and having assembled his brothers and all
their dependants he turned towards Antar. To-morrow,
said he, the warriors and horsemen are
going to march, and no troops will remain in our
[51]

habitations, therefore I consign over to you our
houses and our women; but take care when you
go to the pastures not to wander far in the mountains.
Be perfectly easy, my master, replied Antar,
about whatever you leave in my charge; should
the smallest thing be missing, let me, for the remainder
of my life, be kept in chains and bondage!
Shedad thanked him, and promised when he returned
from the expedition, to give him a fine horse
to ride. In the morning the warriors mounted and
prepared for the engagement, and slung on their
swords and their javelins; they departed from their
habitations, and among the first shone King Zoheir,
like a noble lion.

The horsemen being now absent, the children,
and women, and slaves, male and female, were left
behind. Semeeah, the wife of Shedad, gave a magnificent
entertainment at the lake of Zatool Irsad.
Sheep were slaughtered, and wine flowed, and the
girls carried their instruments. Antar stood amongst
the attendants, and was in transports on seeing Ibla
appear with the other women. She was indeed like
an amorous fawn; she was decorated with variegated
necklaces; and when Antar was attending her, he
was overwhelmed in the ocean of his love, and became
the slave of her sable tresses. They sat down
to eat, and the wine cups went merrily round. It
was the spring of the year, when the whole land
shone in all its glory; the vines hung luxuriantly in
[52]

the arbours; the flowers, shed around ambrosial fragrance;
every hillock sparkled in the beauty of its
colours; the birds in responsive melody sang sweetly
from each bush, and harmony issued from their
throats; every ear was enchanted; the ground was
covered with flowers and herbs; whilst the nightingales
filled the air with their softest notes. Then
the damsels beat the cymbal, and recited the following
verses:

âThe shades have spread their canopy, and the
flowers spread their pillows; the streams roll along
their shores of flowers, some white, some red, some
yellow, some sweet-scented. See the waters gliding
through the gardens, and the trees and their
fruits resemble bracelets and chaplets: the birds
sing melodiously upon them in every variety of
note, the nightingale and the dove pour their
plaintive strain, and make every lover weep; the
gentle zephyrs whisper along, and the branches
move in softest measure. The boughs dance in
the groves, among the trees, in the graceful movement;
the dew drops fall, and the flowers and the
trees are studded with its pearls. The season is
delightful; let it pass in enjoyment, and misfortunes
begone! the opportunity is delicious, let us
grasp in haste its sweets. Be merry, and wild
with joy, and let not a day pass without amusement.â

Then another set took the musical instruments,
[53]

and beating the cymbals with their hands, thus
sang:

âThe gardens sparkle with all they boast of
lovely damsels; every sportive virgin is possessed
of languishing glances, and enchanting movements;
their beauty is perfection, they are loveliness
itself; their elegant shapes glance like the
well-proportioned spears; their tresses float down
their backs, like branches of the grape-vine; they
are slayers and piercers with their arrows and
their darts; archers and strikers, the enchantresses
of men.â

They now formed a dance and took off their robes:
the damsels danced whilst the servants sang, and
carried round the goblets of wine. Roses were
spread over their cheeks, and their bosoms heaved.
And Ibla joined her associates in the dance, and exhibited
her charms, and laughed. Fire shot from
their eyes, and the cups of wine were united to the
honey of their mouths. The imagination of Antar
was inflamed and overpowered in the sea of anxiety;
he hesitated whether he should violate the modesty
of love by the fingers of passion, when lo! on a
sudden there appeared a cloud of dust; and a vast
clamour arose, and in a moment there came forth a
troop of horses and their riders, about seventy
in number, armed with cuirasses and coats of mail,
and Aadite helmets, crying out, O by Cahtan! and
rushed towards the women. At the instant joy was
[54]

converted into grief, and smiles into tears: in a moment
they seized the women and the virgins, made
them prisoners, and placed them on their horses
behind them.

But when Antar saw this disaster, and perceived
that a horseman had carried off Ibla, and observed
her weep, and her cheeks turn from red to a deadly
pale, the world seemed contracted about him, and
as he reflected that he had no arms with which to
fight, he was greatly alarmed, but trusted to his feet.
He overtook the horseman in a moment who had
seized Ibla, for he happened to be in the rear; he
sprung upon him like a wild beast in its utmost
fury, and clung to him, and overpowering him,
threw him upon his head and broke his neck. Silent
was the warriorâs heart, for Antar had annihilated
him, and he took possession of his armour and his
steed. He mounted, and pursued the horsemen,
rushing down upon them like a torrent, and assailing
them with the most abusive and contemptuous
language. Hear, ye dastards! I am Antar the son
of Shedadâabandon your prisoners and the children,
or I will attack and destroy you. Return to your
tribe of Cahtan in disgrace and despair, or by
the father of mankind, by him who made man
to speak with lips and tongue, I will make your
heads trunkless. He soon came up with those in
the rear, and slew twenty of them; and when the
remaining horsemen perceived what had happened,
[55]

fifty more returned at a full gallop, pouncing down
like eagles; they saw their companions stretched
upon the sand, and immediately attacked him, but
he met them, fierce as a devouring lion.

âHere am I in the boisterous battle, and my
power is well known; my sword and my deeds
testify to those that see me, that I pierce my antagonist,
watchful as he may be. My shield, and
then my spear, and my sword of Indian temper,
were with me in my cradle, my two bosom
friends; and the earth where I stand reddens like
crimson leather, and blood flows thereon, its colour
a deep scarlet. Give me pure wine to drink, or
let it be mixed; give it me old, that I may imagine
it was made before the world. She comes
and offers me to drink in mantles of Judas flower.
Give me to drink, and let me hear the song that
delights me. The sweetest of sounds to me is the
rattle of the Indian blades, and the clash of lances
in the battle, on the day of spear-thrusts, when
the parties shout, and warriors are adjudged to
death: but the dearest of all my projects, the
darling object of all my desires of fortune, is, that
I may behold Ibla at my disposal in happiness
and security.â

He rushed forwards to meet them, and harder
than flint was his heart, and in his attack was their
fate and destiny; he assailed the boldest of his
opponents, and his assault was the assault of the most
obstinate warrior. As soon as he distinguished the
[56]

chief of the party, he approached him, he plunged
at himâhe grappled with himâhis shout struck
him with horror. He pierced his bosom with his
spear, and forced it out through his back. When
his companions saw the effect produced, every heart
quaked with fear, and felt convinced that death and
destruction were at hand; and they said one to
another, it is a mere slave that has brought this
confusion upon us, a wretch, mean and worthless;
what will be our condition then if the warriors come
to his assistance? Let us fly, otherwise our ruin
and annihilation are certain. So they joined the
others, and fled away in disorder, abandoning the
women, and retreating in disgrace and despair.
Antar, as soon as they were dispersed, collected the
scattered horses, and a vast quantity of arms, &c.
He returned home, and the women and families
being all safe, thus he exclaimed.

âThese are my exploits when I stalk against the
foe, and they abuse me for my black complexion,
which is my glory. I drive away the troops and
the noble warriors, and my colt as he rushes on
plunges into the battle. As to those who envy
me like fools, every one knows that virtue is ever
the object of jealousy. I am the offspring of my
day, the sword is my father, in it is my glory, the
one may be denied, the other is a fact. Never
will I cease to hew down the troops in bodies, till
every opponent is annihilated.â

He returned home, taking with him twenty-five
[57]

horses and all the women and children. Now the
hatred of Semeeah was converted into love and
tenderness, and he became dearer to her than sleep.
They all came home, but Semeeah enjoined all the
women not to disclose this event to any one, lest
their husbands should blame them. Antar also
kept it all a profound secret. In a short time King
Zoheir returned from his victory over the tribe of
Temeen, and brought with him an immense booty;
and both those that went and those that staid were
greatly rejoiced.

The next day in the morning, Shedad went out
on horseback and sought his herds and flocks; he
perceived amongst his horses some strange ones,
and also saw Antar riding upon a black mare.
Whence, cried he, came these animals? and whence
got you this mare, that excites my wonder? Now
the mare Antar was riding belonged to the chief of
the Cahtanians, and the other horses were those the
horsemen rode whom he had slain; the spoil and all
he had collected were concealed at his motherâs. O
master, he replied, as I was tending the flocks
yesterday, there came some Cahtanians, and with
them an immense quantity of cattle; they were much
fatigued and moreover frightened at the Arab
horsemen. I followed them, and finding these
horses separated from the rest, I took them and
brought them back. Thou wicked slave, said Shedad,
these are no horses strayed from their owners,
[58]

thou hast carried them off from beneath their riders;
it is on this account thou wanderest alone in these
wilds and rocks, and every Arab thou canst meet
thou killest him, and thou carest not whether he is
of the tribe of Cahtan or Adnan. Never wilt thou
leave off this conduct till thou hast excited feuds
among the Arabs, and slain heroes and horsemen!

Now in that age the Arabs were of two classes;
from Yemen to India they were called the tribe of
Cahtan; and in Mecca and Hijaz they were called
the tribe of Adnan. Shedad laid hold of Antar, and
bound him with a rope. Here, said Shedad, thou
shalt remain tied up. Never again will I let thee
take my cattle to the pasture; and he beat him with
the whip he had in his hand; and as he continued
to lash and thrash him, no good will come of thee,
said he; evil and abominations are rooted in thee;
thou wilt breed dissensions among the Arab tribes,
and thou wilt make us a common tale among nations.
His father still beat him and abused him, and he
bore it all.

At last Semeeah came out, and seeing what was
going on, she wept bitterly. She sprang forwards
and threw herself on his breast, exclaiming, sooner
shalt thou beat me than him; he does not deserve
such ill treatment, O Shedad. But Shedad became
very angry with her, and shoving her away, threw
her down on her back. She rose up and cast herself
into Antarâs arms, uncovering her head, and
[59]

letting her hair flow down her shoulders. This
excited Shedadâs surprise. What has happened to
this wretch, he exclaimed, that you feel so much
affection and tenderness, after having expressed so
much anger and indignation? Loose his bands, said
Semeeah, and I will relate the whole story to you.
Tell me, said he, and I will release him. Then she
told Shedad all that Antar had done; how he alone
had attacked seventy horsemen, and had driven them
back in confusion and despair, and had secured in
safety all their families and children. Then Semeeah
repeated these verses:

âO Shedad, hadst thou seen me, my face uncovered,
and my person carried off behind the
warriors, and the women of Prince Cais in dismay,
no resource at hand, and their veils trailing on the
surface of the earth. Ibla too! they mounted her
behind a warrior, whilst her tears streamed down
her cheeks. The slaves whom I encouraged, fled;
every one fled, all trembling in affright. Our
families surrounded us weeping in anguish and in
misery. Our camels were driven away, and every
heart was distracted. Then Antar plunged into
the midst of them; into the black rolling dust;
the atmosphere was involved in darkness, and the
birds sunk motionless; their horsemen fled through
fear: this one was slain, that made captive; he
protected us. After he had comforted us all, he
pursued them, and the honour of them all was
[60]

destroyed. O it is right I should respect him;
protect him; my honour he protected, and he
preserved the honour of us all.â

Semeeahâs account of Antarâs actions astonished
Shedad, and he rejoiced and was glad. It is surprising,
said he to himself, he kept all this secret,
and his submission to be bound by me! âtis most
wonderful! Antar stood unconcerned, and listened
to Semeeahâs acknowledgments; he bore no resentment,
and praised her in these verses:

âOh! is it from Semeeah that these tears flow in
anguish, and from a heart in flames? Shall her
form shadow me? can blows harm me, and shall
tears burst in torrents from her eyelids? When
her tresses hang dishevelled; she is like the rising
full moon, veiled in the darkness of night. The
property is thy property, the slave thy slave:
and life, and every sense shall be exerted to save
thee. Oh! when the troopers start forth, harsh-countenanced,
and the black dust rolls over them;
then make use of me. If I do not disperse them
in the clash of contending spears, may I never be
permitted to drink! may the rain-drop never
moisten me! The sword is in my hand, whose
blows fetch blood; but the swords of others have
no power in their edge. Men are of two kinds;
one whose heart is of brittle glassâthe other whose
heart is of rock.â

When Antar had finished his verses, Shedad came
[61]

up to him, and released him, and begged his pardon,
for he was convinced that such wit expressed in
verse and prose, could not proceed but from an exalted
warrior. At that moment came a servant from
King Zoheir, who saluted Shedad. The King, O
Chief, said he, sends his salutation in to you, and
requests you will attend a feast he has prepared.
Shedad took Antar with him and went to the feast,
and the slave followed him till he reached Zoheirâs
tents, which he found resounding with cymbals, and
other musical instruments, and the victims were
slaughtered: and there were assembled the race of
Abs and Adnan, and all the valiant heroes attached
to them. Shedad seated himself amidst the noblest
chieftains, but Antar sat down among the slaves;
and when they had eaten meat, and drank wine,
they conversed, and related all the circumstances of
the late affair. Antar heard all they said, and Shedad
praised his son Antar, informing the king of all
he had done, and all he had composed in prose and
verse, and related the whole story. All this, cried
the King, greatly rejoiced at the courage and eloquence
of Antar, I anticipated at the time he slew
the slave of my son Shas; I knew he would be the
refuge of every petitioner. Who can execute such
deeds or perform such acts! doubtless he will rise
superior to all his contemporaries. And he called
out to him, and ordered him into his presence.
Antar kissed his hands, and presented him the cup,
[62]

and his heart was overpowered with joy and delight.
O Antar, exclaimed his friend Malik, the Kingâs
sonâat your commands, said Antar, thou moon of
this assembly. I wish, said Malik, thou wouldst
recite to us some of thy verses. Willingly, my
lord, said Antar; and he thus continued:

âGlory is bound to the back of the steeds; victory
on the day of horrors, lives in the sword; never
rises the battle dust on the day of fight, but my
pliant spear assists me. How many sand-clouds
have I penetrated, fearless of calamities, when the
faces of black and white swoon in terror! How
many horsemen fly from the encounter of arms
when the war-dust rises; they fly and are repulsed:
then rush I into the clanging war: my heart
and my chest are hewn out of the solid rock. O
thou lion-king, have thine eyes beheld the exploits
of the horsemen of the desert, when the foe
attacked us to spoil us of our cattle? then I cut
down their chief on the desert: I raised him
up on my nobly-serving sword: he was dashed
from his saddle, and his cheeks crushed on the
earth. I am thine, O thou King of all the earth, and
thy fame shall be spread over every land. Ye
are the Princes of Jezeemah, and whoever presumes
to resist ye, shall quickly be destroyed and be
dismissed from this world. Come on thenâit is
the lion who never drew his sword, but that every
hero dreaded its encounter. The lions fear, and
[63]

in their dens tremble at him; man also dreads
him, and the dÃ¦mons of the waste. He shrinks
not from the warriors, numerous as they are. I
plunge into the war-dust, and the warriors charge
against the combatants with swords that pierce
through the throats. I swerve not from my purpose
when I am resolved on it, till I accomplish
every wish of my heart. I am indeed your slave,
named Antar; to him the horrors of battle are
welcome; he never faulters. Mayest thou, O
King, live for ever! His like is not among the
kings of the earth or the desert. May God ever
preserve for me my father Shedad, for he is a support
for meânothing existing could recompense
me for his loss, for he is my lord and chief. His
glory is from the race of Abs, the seat of all
honour and liberality.â

When Antar had finished his verses, King Zoheir
and all present expressed the greatest pleasure.
The King called him to him, and giving him a robe,
thanked him. In the evening he returned with his
father Shedad, and his heart bounded with exultation
at the honours with which he had been favoured.
And his passion for Ibla increased.

One day Antar rode out on one of the horses, in
company with his brothers; they drove the herds till
they came to the pastures, and there Antar remained
to protect and tend them. Now Shiboob was an active
sagacious fellow, and had a persuasive tongue, but
[64]

he was the devil in the form of a man. In running
he would outstrip a deer, and when he ran after a
horse, he soon left it behind among the rocks.

Antar had great confidence in him at all times,
and feared him more than any human being. Now
it happened that the sons of Zoheir were assembled
together at the invitation of their uncle Asyed the
son of Zezimah, for in those days, people that loved
each other frequently met, and shunned those they
disliked. The Princes were riding out, and made
choice of an eminence, where they halted and pitched
their tents, and conversed till dinner was ready.
They ate, drank, and laughed and sung, and joked
away the time, whilst some of the damsels sang the
following strain:

âMix thy water in the cup of thy wine, and give
me to drink, for truly I have mixed my tears
with my blood. Let me drink of wine in the
flower gardens to drive away sorrow, and quicken
my joys. Every charm is combined in her form
that lives like the soul that flows through my limbs;
and whilst she bears the cup in her hand, she appears
kindling the flame of my love. In the
noon-tide sun she dances, and her face is spotted
like the full moon of night with the star of the
Gemini.â

They were seated and drinking: they were all
much amused and pleased, and the old wine had its
sway. Just then, Malik turned round his head and
[65]

saw Antar and his brothers feeding the flocks and
camels on a rising ground. Behold my friend Antar,
honoured amongst the inhabitants of deserts and
cities, said he to his brother, and he called to one
of his slaves. Go to Antar, said he, and invite him
to our party, that we may hear his discourse, and
our enjoyment be complete. âHow can you look
upon this savage? exclaimed Shas, and think of
such an ungracious wretch, and thus raise him
amongst the chieftains of the tribe? On account of
his verses, his consequence and power are extolled,
and you bestow on him the highest dignity. But
indeed, I feel inclined to rush at him, and tear his
life out of his body, were I not afraid of the reproaches
and reprimands of my tribe; and moreover,
I should be sorry to interrupt the amusement
of my brothers and companions. Indeed, my brother,
your repeated admiration of him augments my aversion
to him.â

Thus were they talking together, when on a sudden,
a dust like a cloud arose among them, and
there appeared three hundred valiant horsemen, like
lions of the forest; and under them were steeds
swifter than death. They were of the tribe of
Cahtan, on a marauding party, to plunder the tribe
of Adnan. And when they found these persons
seated and drinking among the hills, they said one
to another, Let us attack this party, that we may
capture them in an instant, and convey them away
[66]

to our country, for it is a wealthy tribe. Then
bending their heads over their saddle-bows, they
gallopped among them, shouting and hallooingâO
by Cahtan!

When the sons of Zoheir saw this, they were surprised;
they hastened to mount their horses and to
gird on their swords. The foe poured down from
the summit of the hill; they all at once shouted
aloudâthey rushed forward and plunged through
the dust, assailing the horsemen of Yemen, like the
ocean when it bursts and retreats. And when
Antar heard their yells and screams, he feared lest
the enemy would destroy them with their spears;
and greatly was he alarmed for Malik and his
brothers. He called out towards his own brothers,
and went towards the party, among whom was a
horseman whose name was Zatik, son of Maboob.
Antar pounced down upon him, and piercing him,
left him weltering in his gore. He then assailed his
companions, and gave a shout like thunder when it
roars. And there was not one that could see or
hear; fear and trembling seized them; they beheld
only Antar the lion! They fled, and the whole
troop was dispersed and routed, till they all disappeared
over the extended plains.

Antar returned to the princes, and shouted out
to the horsemen that still remained assailing them;
and as soon as they looked on Antar, an universal
terror shook their frames, and their colour instantly
[67]

changed; for they had seen him scatter heroes like
seeds of rue, and trample carcases under his feet,
leaving numbers dashed to the earth; and none
could oppose but those accustomed to plunge into
the battle dust. And as he engaged them he
roared out these verses.

âThe heights of glory are not attained but at
the point of the spear, and patience in the day of
battle through the heaviest difficulties, and the
challenge of every lion-hero, and long-bearded
warrior. Ask my horse of me, when flashes of
fire fly from his hoofs. I have a spear-thrust
that deals the most excruciating pain, and raises
me above all competitors; and my Indian blade
cuts through the nocturnal calamities whenever I
draw it. I am the son of the black faced Zebeebah
that tends the camels. I am a slave, but my
fury oâerwhelms the lordly chiefs in the battle.
As to death, should I meet him, I will not shrink
from him when he appears to meâit is a draught
I must inevitably take when the day of my dissolution
arrives.â

Then, diving through the dust, he overthrew
the horsemen singly, and in pairs, and infused the
most violent commotions into the hearts of the combatants.
Thus, having driven away by his assaults
the fury of war, from the sons of Zoheir, they felt
relieved from their distresses. In the mean time a slave
had informed the King, who instantly mounted and
[68]

departed with his horsemen and troops; but the
news did not reach him till Antar had completed
the business, and had put his enemies to flight to
the right and left; and many were the brave that
remained on the field. The princes returned to their
tents, Antar preceding them like a lion, repeating
these verses:

âI will not cease to exalt myself by my deeds,
till I reach Orion in my ambitious projects. Here
I care not for those who abuse me, fearful of death
and separation from life. But I will reduce my
foes and my railers by force, and I will be patient
under sufferings and in praise. I will strive to
attain what I desire, till death snatch me away.
I will arm my mind against worldly lusts, that I
may be considered noble-minded and faithful.
Whoever would check me, let him look to himself,
whereâer he may be concealed. My complexion
is no injury to me, nor the name of Zebeebah,
when I exercise my courage amongst the foe. I
will work wonders and marvels; and I will protect
myself from the tongues of the wicked.â

When Zoheir heard Antarâs verses, he thanked
him for his noble conduct, and joyed in the safety
of his sons and his people, expressing the warmest
attachment and affection for Antar. He then demanded
of the prisoners, of what country they were;
they replied that they belonged to the furthest lands
of Yemen.

[69]

King Zoheir soon after gave an entertainment in
his tents, rejoicing in the escape of his sons. He
sent for Antar and set him down by his side, and
gave him to drink of his most delicious wines, and
placed him high amongst all his comrades, investing
him with a superb robe, worked in gold, and girding
him on a trusty sword, and mounting him on one
of his finest Arab horses. He took pleasure in
seeing him, and called him the Champion of the
Absians. From this day forward, said he to Shedad,
I will not permit him to attend your flocks;
now that he has thus distinguished himself by such
glorious deeds; let him now run the career of victory
with the warriors of his country. He was thus
separated from the servants, and attacked the
tribes and made predatory excursions against them.
And his brother Shiboob pointed out to him the
hordes, and places of resort, and the fountains; and
he never went on any expedition but he succeeded,
and returned full of joy and content; so that his
father Shedad became enriched, and all the noblest
chieftains delighted in him.

He had now many friends, and many jealous
enemies; amongst the latter were prince Shas, and
Rebia. And when they saw what great things
Antar had done, their indignation against him
increased, and they resolved on his destruction. In
every society, the people, assembled round their
wine, repeated Antarâs verses, mentioned his actions,
[70]

and talked of his love for Ibla, and his discourses.
This continued some time, till at length it reached
the ears of Iblaâs father and mother, and when they
heard Antarâs amorous poetry repeated, they ridiculed
it, and would not receive him on friendly
terms; but shewed their aversion to him, in every
way, and made him perform every menial office;
for Antar, in their eyes, was only considered as a
slave. But when the talk about Ibla gained ground,
her mother ordered Ibla into the presence of her
father, and sent also for Antar. So, you love my
daughter Ibla, said she, and make verses upon her,
and cannot conceal your feelings. Ibla was standing
by her mother, and when she heard her speak
to Antar, she smiled. This increased Antarâs confusion,
and he was much disordered, as it called
forth all his love.

O mistress, said he, did you ever see any one who
hated his mistress, particularly when his life and
death were in her hands! verily, I do love her, and
my only wish in this world is to be near her: her
form is ever before me, her name is ever in my
heart and soul: and I exalt in my verses, all that
God has granted her of beauty and loveliness.

When Ibla heard Antar speak in her praise,
her surprise increased, and Antar made great
progress in her heart. If, said her mother to
Antar, you are in earnest in what you say, let
us hear some of your verses in praise of her
[71]

charms. Upon this, Antar hung down his head,
and thus spoke:

âI love thee with the love of a noble born hero;
and I am content with thy imaginary phantom.
Thou art my sovereign in my very blood; and my
mistress; and in thee is all my confidence. O Ibla,
my description cannot pourtray thee, for thou
comprehendest every perfection. Were I to say
thy face is like the full moon of heaven, where
in that full moon, is the eye of the antelope? Were
I to say thy shape is like the branch of the Erak
tree; O thou shamest it in the grace of thy form.
In thy forehead is my guide to truth; and in the
night of thy tresses I wander astray. Thy teeth
resemble stringed jewels; but how can I liken
them to lifeless pearls? Thy bosom is created as
an enchantment. O may God protect it ever in
that perfection! To be connected with thee, is to
be connected with every joy, but separated from
all my world is the bond of thy connexion. Under
thy veil is the rosebud of my life, and thine eyes
are guarded with a multitude of arrows; round
thy tent is a lion warrior, the swordâs edge, and
the spearâs point. O thy face is like the full moon
of heaven, allied to light, but far from my hopes.â

When Antar ceased, Ibla and her mother were
astonished, and their dislike towards him diminished;
and Ibla regarded him with affection. And Iblaâs
mother said to AntarâI had no idea that you could
[72]

talk after this style, and speak with so much elegance
and propriety: by the faith of a noble Arab, you
are endowed with high and noble qualities. I intend
to night to speak to my husband, that he may
marry you to Khemisa, Iblaâs servant; who is
the prettiest of all the girls of the place. Never,
said Antar, will I be united to a woman who is
a slave, and not free born; and never but with
her my soul adores. May God, said Ibla, accomplish
thy wishes; and may he grant thee the
woman thou lovest, and may thou live in peace and
happiness! Amen, Amen, Amen, replied Antar.

These verses were soon published amongst the
whole tribe, and men and women sang and repeated
them. It happened about this time that Rebia
gave an entertainment, to which he invited Shas,
and Malik, Iblaâs father and his son Amroo to come
and eat, and drink wine, and when they became
merry, the girls began to sing these verses. Do
you not see how that slave is talked of? exclaimed
Shas, how his name is renowned, and his character
and fame are celebrated?

Thus they went on talking till Amroo became
exceedingly angry. Death, O Chief, said he to
Rebia, would be more tolerable to us than such
proceedings. I have frequently spoken to my father
to cast off this slave; but he says, the fellow is a
slave, and the son of a slave, he is of no consequence;
and were we to drive him out of our tents, King
[73]

Zoheir would take him, and encourage him against
us, and then his avidity would only increase, and
we should injure ourselves; for how can we presume
to oppose King Zoheir? And then again, he enrages
us by his verses. I have longed to kill him from
the moment I heard that he mentioned my sister in
his rhymes, let happen what may.

We have not invited you, said Rebia, to do any
thing of this kind; who is this slave, that you should
stain your sword with his blood? Let us consult
on other means of killing him. I will to-morrow conceal
twenty of the stoutest of my slaves, and will
order them to kill him in the rocky precipices. My
slave Bazam is the brother of Zajir, and he has
long wished to kill him; but I would not let him do
it, for fear of the reproaches of King Zoheir; but
now that his son Shas is with us, and takes a part
in the affair, we shall be secure from blame. Then
said Shas, I will assist you in word or deed, were
even my father and brother and cousins to oppose
me; and I will persevere in this enterprize, even if
I were obliged to take a personal part in it; and I
too will engage twenty of my slaves in it, to kill him
by the cruellest death, and make an example of
him. They did not break up the entertainment
till Shas, Rebia, and Amroo had all three bound
themselves by oath; and they arranged the forty
slaves, all strong as lions, twenty from Shas, and
twenty from Rebia.

[74]

Now Shedad had a daughter, and her name was
Merweh, but not by Semeah; and she was married
to a man called Jahjah, one of the tribe of Ghiftan,
and he was a celebrated warrior. It happened that
Jahjah had married his sister to one Magid, son of
Leith, also one of the Ghiftan tribe; and when
the bridal festival was preparing amongst the
Ghiftanians, Merweh came to the tribe of Abs and
Adnan, with a party of women, to invite the females
belonging to her father, and her uncles Malik and
Zakmet-ool Jewad, and their relations amongst the
tribe of Carad, to the feast. They accordingly obtained
their husbandsâ permission to make the
visit, and their husbands went with them. In front
of the howdahs they sounded the cymbals, and the
servants brandished their swords; and Antar was
among them, in attendance on Ibla and Semeah, and
the wives of his uncles. And when he assisted her to
alight and mount the howdah, he used to gratify
himself in talking to her, and was mad in gazing on
her charms; and he was in hopes the journey would
be long. Iblaâs mother laughed at him, when she
saw him assiduously attending on her daughter.
Verily, said she, you love my daughter so much as
to compose verses on her, and in description of her
beauties. Yes, said Antar, by the God that has decorated
the heavens, and raised them on high, and
has adorned them with stars, were I able, I would
make my eye her resting-place. They journeyed
[75]

on, and Antar walked before the howdah of Ibla,
repeating these verses.

âMarch the way of security. O thou, all my
hope, proceed, for he who encompasses thee is an
intrepid warrior, that smites with his sword when
the battle clashes. O Ibla, one look from the veil
of thy eyelids is sufficient. Should I never attain
my object in this world, the extended
plains and mountains must press upon me.â

Thus they proceeded on their journey; singing
and playing, till the day was spent and darkness
came on, when they dismounted in a spacious plain
near a pool of water. They ate and drank, and remained
in that spot till it was day; and just as Antar
was ordering the slaves to raise the howdahs on the
camels backs, lo! a great dust arose, spreading rapidly
over the valleys and the mountains. In an
instant there came forth a hundred slaves on horseback,
and Arabs; at their head was a horseman
like an eagle, crying out,

âThis day will I be revenged; verily I am the
conqueror, and I will settle the business with my
sword and my spear, on a slave of a tribe whom
the Absians regard not, but who listens not to
one that chides him. How many men have I
trampled down in the dust. I am a valiant one,
like whom there is no hero.â

As was before stated, Shas and Rebia had sworn
to destroy Antar, and having placed their spies and
[76]

scouts for that purpose, they stationed the forty
slaves, putting Basam at their head, just at the time
that Merweh, the daughter of Shedad, happened to
come by, and was returning home. The slave, with
his comrades of the tribe of Ham, followed the party
until they came to the valley of Ghifal, where they
resolved to lie in ambush for Antar: when lo! the
sound of horsesâ hoofs alarmed them, and heroes
rushed upon them, crying outââStop where ye are,
or your sculls shall fly. Tell us who ye are, and of
what tribe of Arabs, before we pour down destruction
upon ye.â On hearing this, Basam prepared
his people for the attack; O Arabs, he replied, we
are of the tribe of Abs, inhabitants of this country;
but who are you, and why are ye halting in this
place? Slaves of a coward race, cried the chief, we
are in search of you, for amongst you is that accursed
slave Antar, the son of Shedad.

Now these were Arabs and horsemen of the tribe
of Moostalik, and their chief was called Vethab;
he happened to be out of the way when Antar
slew his brother, some time before; but when he
returned, they informed him of it. He went
forth to be revenged, exclaiming, Verily, a slave of
the tribe of Abs has slain my brother, but I will
destroy none but their King, and not return but
with Antarâs head. He thus met Basam, and all
this occurred. And after some explanation; know,
O noble Sir, said Basam, our masters have sent us
in search of you, that we may together hasten to kill
[77]

this slave, and waylay him: here he has halted this
night. If ye wish, we will slay him, said Vethab,
and we will give you his head; but if you please,
do you kill him, and give us his head. But swear
you will not betray us.

Upon that, they promised and swore, and took
engagements from one another. But Basam turned
towards his comrades. Let us hide ourselves here,
said he; but if ye perceive that they commit any
injury to the property and families, we must then
assail them too, till some people come to our aid,
and thus we obtain our end in the death of Antar.
However, we must in the attack remain in the rear,
so that the women may not distinguish us, and know
that we are amongst the enemy. Do what you
please, said the slaves, and when the shades of night
were dissolving, the party under Vethab poured
down upon Antar like a cloud of waves, shouting
out, To arms! to arms!

Then began the women to scream and weep.
Antar cast his eyes towards Ibla, and she was bathed
in tears: he looked at her mother, and her grief
was great. Antar smiled, and presented himself
before Iblaâs mother. O mistress, said he, what
think you of these our enemies? verily they are
eager for their prey. O Antar, said she, my force
and spirits are exhausted; in a moment we shall be
the prisoners of our enemies, and they will scatter
us over this desert. O my mistress, said Antar,
give Ibla to me in marriage, and I will disperse
[78]

your enemies at a single onset. I will reduce them
to annihilation; and I will give you their horses and
their armour as a dower. This is no time for
merriment, said she. No, cried Antar, By the God
of day, and the animator of souls: he that is God
the merciful, and the Lord of victory, if you promise
to marry her to me, I will make over to you
these horses, and slay their masters. Defend her,
said she, and she is yours. At the instant, he
turned round to ShiboobâProtect my rear, he cried,
this day. Be of good cheer, thou black-born, exclaimed
Shiboob, for I will bear two-thirds of thy
troubles. Antar rushed forward and assaulted them;
roaring and shouting aloud, and again he attacked
them, and roared out. He encountered the first
ranks, and met them with all-potent thrusts; he
struck them in their chests, and in their eyes. He
slew the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth; and
behold, a horseman came down upon Antar from
behind. As he was blustering over the plain, and
just as he was about to transfix Antar with his spear,
lo! an arrow pierced his heart, and threw him from
his horse. The terrible Shiboob dealt the deadly
blow. When the party saw the state of the battle,
they retreated from before him; but he marking
how the enemy were dispersed, came up to the
women, and said to Ibla, Check thy tears, thou light
of my eyes, the man lives not that has harmed thee!
and thus he spoke in verse:

âCheck thy tears, for if thy heart is distressed,
[79]

the noble lion of the den will protect thee. O
Ibla, fear not, indulge no alarms, for my whole
frame is labouring under the burden of its love;
and I am a lion to whom the warriors in the day
of contention bow in submission, and whom the
cowards dread. O Ibla, if persecution and absence
must kill me, O that the bonds of meeting were
loosened for ever. Verily, I will defend thee this
day, O thou my only hope, for I have a sword
whose blade cleaves the sculls. O Ibla, ariseâbehold
my actions, and my deeds under the battle
dust, when every man is cut to pieces. Behold
my exploits when they attack and come on, and
the supports of their tribe are destroyed. The
foe wishes to take thee captive, O thou my only
hope. O Ibla, palsied is the hand that would take
thee prisoner. I will steep my sword in their
blood, and I will glut the birds, and the wolves,
and the Ghuols, with their carcases. Here let all
the world know that every foe of mine shall be
overthrown under the dust of the battle.â

When Ibla heard Antar address her, she smiled
with teeth more brilliant, and whiter than pearls,
for she felt assured of his victory and conquest.
Again he returned towards the foe, like a lion, and
attacked them on the field of battle, scattering them
to the right and to the left. Shiboob assisted him
in the rear with his arrows, and the dust rose and
filled the plain on all sides. The women were
[80]

praying for Antar, and invoking the God of heaven.
He was eagerly assailing the foe, like a lion, and
slew thirty of their horsemen. His horse being
completely exhausted, he dismounted and vaulted
on another charger; and whilst all this was passing
the slaves of the tribe of Abs looked on and gazed
in wild dismay and astonishment; but the chief
Vethab, when he perceived his companions and
those that were overthrown, cried out to the survivors,
I alone am his match; and he rode away to the
field of battle, clothed in brilliant armour, a splendid
sword on his loins, and a spear in his hand, and he
thus exclaimed:

âThe vicissitudes of fortune, from the height of
their mutability are launched against me, and every
companion has abandoned me. The death of my
tribe is at hand, from the arm of a slave who disregards
his fate. It is no wonder when fortune
raises up a poor wretch, that she should leave him
in his infirmities a prey to the lions. O thou
vile slave, that hast outstepped thy sphere, a
warrior, one whom no words can describe, is come
against thee. Away then with thy blind follies,
thou son of Zebeebah; for how many heroes have
I destroyed at the moment of their attack.â

He had scarcely finished his verses when Antar
answered him:

âThou wouldst abuse me, vile wretch, for that
I am the colour of that night, whose dangers I
[81]

dare. If I am a slave, I have slain thy chiefs,
and I have overwhelmed them with the vicissitudes
of fortune. I am the assaulting lion: in
the field of battle I rush impetuously when the
coward turns away in flight. The firm-rooted
mountains are up-rooted at my vehemence, and
let every one who dares to resist me, be certain
of death. How many heroes are punished as soon
as the lustre of my horseâs front shines in the plain
of war! their hands instantly relinquish their
arms, and they tumble on the surface of the earth,
struggling with their limbs. How many warriors
have I left stretched dead, gored with the spear
thrusts! If thou art desirous to fight me, come on
boldly to the hero who will make thee taste the
food of death even from the tip of his fingers.â

He instantly assailed him, and struck him on the
breast, and driving out his spear between his shoulders,
he rushed among his comrades like unto a
valiant lion, and gored their sides and their bosoms:
and when they perceived that his assault was like a
vivid flame of fire, they fled over the plains and the
rocks. In the mean time, the slaves of Shas and
Rebia, seeing what Antar had done to the tribe of
Moostalik, and how he was coming down upon
them with a loud shout, and also Shiboob, quick as
the flash of lightning, in his rear; they turned their
backs and fled. Antar returned, the blood streaming
from his spear. The women joined him, thanking
[82]

and praising him: and Ibla also came up to him
and smiled upon him. God protect thee, said she,
thou black in face, but fair in deedsâthou ornament
of men. He expressed his gratitude, and having
replaced her on the howdah, and ordered the slaves
to collect the scattered horses and dispersed cattle,
and the spoils of the slain, he travelled on with the
women till they reached the tribe of Ghiftan, and
informed Shedad of all that had occurred with the
enemy. Shedad gave him thanks, and kissed him
between the eyes; he took him by the hand, and
his anger was soothed. And when they were at the
feast, Shedad wished to place him among the
chiefs; but Antar would not consent; and he went
away and joined the slaves; and all the chiefs were
astonished at his modesty. They stood in awe of
him, and raised his dignity; however, all the elders
and the youth came up to him, and made him sit
down with them to drink wine, and treated him with
all manner of kindness, and in return, he recited
various pieces of poetry, and they were greatly delighted;
and for seven days they continued this civility
and honour, and not a day passed but the
families made their acknowledgements to Antar.

And the feast being concluded, the tribe of Abs
sought their homes and their own habitations, and
travelled till they reached the land of Sheerebah and
Mount Saadi. When lo! loud cries and increasing
shouts, and shrill screams and clouds of dust, from
[83]

all directions assailed them. What misfortune,
cried Shedad, what disasters have befallen us? They
hastened away on their Arab steeds, and found their
wives prisoners, and their daughters dishonoured.
Loud and confused were their shrieks, and through
the dust glared the dazzling brightness of swords:
and the uproar of men was like the crash of
thunder: and there was no one in the tents but a
few men and the sons of King Zoheir, all covered
with wounds; and though they were still defending
the property, they felt certain of drinking the cup
of death.

Now the cause of this terrible event was, that
King Zoheir had gone forth, accompanied by his
warriors, against the land of Cahtan; for he was
informed that Mooteghetris was coming down upon
him with all his tribe; and it was Zoheirâs intention
to meet him at some distance, out of his
own territories, and thus to prevent him from invading
his country, and laying waste his lands. So
he left his brother Zembaa with a small body of men
and departed; but chancing to miss the enemy on
the road, Mooteghetris reached the country of Zoheir
in safety, where he found the tents unprotected by
warriors. He rushed against them, and the noble
Absians rose to arms; and violent was the contention
between them, and many brave men were left
dead upon the plain, and the brightness of the
day became black. Numbers thickened upon the
[84]

Absians; loud and piercing were the shrieks of the
women, and slavery seemed their undoubted fate.
Temadhur was taken prisoner, and also Modehilah
and Mekdada and Jemana, and they were overwhelmed
in misery and disgrace. At that hour
arrived Antar and Shedad, and the horsemen of
Carad; and they amounted in all to forty warriors.

Cousins, cried Shedad, come on to these dastards!
then those brave fellows rushed forward, leaving the
slaves with the women and children. O son of
Zebeebah, cried Shedad to Antar, I wish to day to
see thee fight, that I may express my gratitude for
thy noble deeds. O master, soon shalt thou observe
what I do: he replied, Doubtless the chief of the
tribe is here. Thou art right, said Shedad. They
sought the enemy, and the whole plain trembled at
their shouts: they shook their lances, and the
women and servants shouted aloud, when they knew
they were Absians coming to protect them. They
attacked the right, and drove their left, and Antar
assaulted the centre, plunging through confusion
and horrors; and thus he exclaimed:

âThis day will I raise a battle, that shall humble
the warriors of ages long past. I will make
the blood to stream from their joints, when the
sculls of the warriors leap from the blow of my
sword. How many chiefs, when they see me eager
in the fight, throw away their arms, and save
themselves by flight! I am the bold one. As to
[85]

the fire of war, I kindle it, and hurl the tribes into
punishments and death. Death, in the direful
combat, fears me, when the battle-dust rises; and
the sand-cloud is like a blazing fire. My joy is in
the encounter of heroes, when spears and swords
clash in my grasp. How many battle-dusts have I
dived into, fearless of calamities! The joy of contests
is my object; it is all my desire. Verily, deeds
will I perform unrivalled; deeds that shall be recorded
on leaves and books. I will raise the
tumultuous din, and seas of blood: âtis in their
crimson billows that my gladness abounds. I
will make the atmosphere like the sable night,
when the dust clouds roll over the regions like a
veil. No companion have I in battle but my horse
and my sword; and they complain of my fury;
they exalt me; they subject death to me; and I
am exalted above all mankind in my father. My
ambition soars above Pisces; and my determination
raises me above the Arab and the Persian.â

When Antar had ended, he shouted aloud to the
combatants, and rushed madly into the midst of the
enemy, and overthrew them; he drove them before
him over the plain; and the same did Shedad and
his brothers on the left, and made them retreat in a
shameful manner. After the flight, the Absians
returned, and among the first was Zembaa, the son
of Jazeemah; they raised their terrible shout, and
they gladdened in the destruction of souls; they
[86]

pointed their lances, they cried out to their noble
steedsâspears clashed against spears. Antar alone
broke through the right, whilst Shedad and the
Absians destroyed the left; then the horsemen again
retired in disgrace, and the plain seemed too confined
for them. Mooteghetris beheld his horsemen in
confusion and discomfited, and the left wing intermixed
with the right; that they were driven by
Antar like a herd of grazing camels, and that he was
roaring in their rear like the crash of thunder. Alarmed
at this state of affairs, he poured down from an
eminence with the people that remained with him,
assaulting Antar with his warriors; and they all
bore patiently this dreadful encounter.

Now Basam, the servant of Rebia, who had
followed Antar that he might destroy him on his
way to the tribe of Ghiftan, perceiving how he had
slain the tribe of Moostalik, and also their chief,
returned with his companions upon the day of this
battle; and as he marked Antarâs prowess on that
occasion, he envied him in his heart, and, secretly
designing to murder him, he assailed him, together
with the party of Mooteghetris.

Antar encountered the enemy, and flinched not;
and his assault was the assault of a ferocious lion.
The storm of dust thickened, so that a father could
not distinguish his son. Just then, Basam aimed
his spear, and violently attacked Antar; for his
accursed spirit was aware how much credit he should
[87]

gain by slaying him. He approached him, and was
eagerly watching his opportunity, when lo! an arrow
shot through the back of Basam, and passed out by
his chest; and he who slew Basam, and made him
drink the cup of death, was the dreadful Shiboob.
Now Antar had recommended Shiboob to protect
Ibla: nor did he ever quit her till he perceived
Basam issuing from the tents, followed by some
Absians, whilst his brother was labouring to attain
the standards. Shiboob was alarmed, and quitted
Ibla, and ran after him. But, Antar knew nothing
of all this, and when he saw Basam, he was just
about to do the deed, at the moment the arrow
struck him dead.

Now Antar was occupied in destroying the enemy,
and he stopped not till he came up to Mooteghetris
in the fury of the fight; and he saw him driving
back the troops, and beckoning with his lance to
those who were flying from Antar like a flock of
sheep. His soul would not submit to flight; but he
shouted, and rushed forward like the sea when it
roars. And Antar received him as the parched up
ground receives the first of the rain: he challenged
him in a tremendous voice, and addressed him in the
harshest terms; he pressed upon Mooteghetris, and
closed upon him, and blocking up all means of
escape, he thrust his spear through his bowels, and
tore out his entrails; and when the horsemen saw
that he was dead, they were disordered and took to
[88]

flight; and the spears of the Absians played upon
the fugitives till the evening, when they returned
and collected the spoil of the cattle. Every where
the victory was celebrated with triumph, and all
united in praising Antar, and describing his heroic
deeds; how he had slain Mooteghetris, and had
annihilated his troops.

[89]

CHAPTER III.

Now Shedad exceedingly gloried in Antar; aware
that he had acquired new lustre by his actions, and
not a person remained to complain of him or abuse
him. He ran up to Antar and kissed him between
the eyes. But Antar kissed his feet, and he appeared
like the flower of the Judas tree,
[1]
so completely
was he smeared with the blood of the combatants.
Shedadâs affection for him increased, and he said to
his brother Zakmet-ool Jewad, By the faith of an
Arab, our education has not been lost upon Antar.
How should he not be noble, he replied, you being
the cause of his existence? and the Arab Cadi decreed
him to you, and told you he was of your loins;
do not reject him, for he truly belongs to you.

Antar, as well as Shedad, heard these words, and
he kept them secret in his heart; and he said not a
word to any one; but in a short time, when they all
repaired to their own tents, and separated each to
his own family, and each collected his own party,
Antar also retired to the house of his mother, and
Shiboob was driving before him what came to his
share of the plunder. And when the time of rest
[90]

drew near, he became sad and sorrowful, and the
house being entirely empty of people and neighbours,
O my mother, said he, I have heard words to day,
the meaning of which I cannot comprehend; I wish
you would explain them to me, and tell me who is
my father, that I may know who brought me up. I
will inform you of all that, said she; so she then
told him how Shedad had met her in the desert,
and how all the ten had sought for her, and how he
had repulsed them, and made them agree to give her
to him, as his share: how they afterwards quarrelled
about him, and went before the Arab Cadi, who had
decided that he belonged to Shedad. Well then,
said he to her, O mother, if the Arab Cadi decided
that I was his son, and the ten have also agreed
that I was sprung from his loins; why does he not
call me his son, as every one else does? This would
cost him dear, said she, and he cannot resolve on
that, because he says you are a base-born; and he is
afraid of the disgrace he should incur by giving you
the rank and honours of a son; and the Arabs would
not consent to it.

âI would not permit that to be the case, he replied,
for whoever would bring shame upon him, I
would soon reduce to annihilation. But if Shedad
still denies me my right and rank, I will use my
sword and spear upon him; and should I perceive
that the tribe dare despise me, I will level my scimitar
at the whole of them, and I will go to another tribe,
[91]

who may better understand my value; for how often
have I rescued them from their dangers; and
liberated them from perils! I will begin by striking
off the head of Shedad, if he does not acknowledge
my rank and condition; and so will I treat also
my uncle, if he does not give me Ibla in marriage;
him too will I make to drink the wine of disgrace.â
For heavenâs sake, said his mother, do nothing of
the kind, for they will only hate you the more, and
you will gain nothing: but the men and women
love you, I perceive, on account of your noble
deeds, therefore proceed to no extremities, otherwise
you will increase their hatred and enmity against
you. But, my mother, added Antar, my aunt has
once promised to give Ibla to me in marriage, and
has engaged herself by contract to that purpose.
Hush! said Zebeebah, talk not of impossibilities;
this will never happen: how can a slave, without
connexion or rank, aspire to marriage with an Arab
woman? particularly as you were brought up tending
the sheep and the camels! O mother, said Antar,
Iâll shew thee wonders; my soul pants for honour
and dignity, and with my sword will I dishonour
the necks of the Arab chieftains.

Thus they continued to talk till morning dawned,
when King Zoheir returned. He could scarcely
believe that his family were preserved safe from
ignominy, for he had heard that Mooteghetris had
passed him on the road; and severe indeed was his
anxiety and affliction at having thus missed his foes.
[92]

He marched therefore day and night till he reached
his own country, and found all his people happy
and secure.

But when the tribe of Abs saw their king returning
with all his army and troops, the chiefs and
nobles went out to meet him, and having congratulated
him and prayed for his long life, they explained
to him the destruction of his enemies, and all the
heroic acts of Antar; how he had slain Mooteghetris,
and what noble feats he had performed. Verily,
said King Zoheir, we are ennobled in him above all
Arabs; we have not appreciated his worth, and
have not properly understood his greatness. Truly
he will become the champion of this whole nation, if
he live long, and all the horsemen will be under his
authority and command.

King Zoheir proceeded to his own tents, and
found his women exulting in the deeds of Antar;
he afterwards entered his wife Temadhurâs apartments,
and found her also praising Antar in heart
and speech, as she exclaimed, O King, it is not
Antar, but a noble warrior; for he has done the
deeds of a hero. Thus was Antarâs dignity raised
in the eyes of King Zoheir. Were we to decree to
him our lives and our property, said he, it would
still be a small return for such exalted acts. He
soon after ordered some sheep and fat cattle to be
killed, and having directed the meat to be served
up and the wine to flow, he went out into the middle
of the camp, and there erected a large tent of
[93]

velvet and silk, and placed in the centre a throne of
ivory inlaid with burnished gold. The horsemen then
presented themselves; Rebia and his brother attended,
and each seated himself according to his rank:
Shedad also came, and all his valiant dependants;
Antar too entered, and kissed the ground, and
made obeisance, and prayed for a continuance of
Zoheirâs glory. He was going to sit down amongst
the slaves, but King Zoheir said to him, By the
Mover of the heavens, no one shall be my companion
to day but you, and no one shall eat and drink but
I and you. And he made Antar come towards
him. O King, said Antar, as he kissed his hand,
I am but your slave. Then King Zoheir got up
from his throne, and seated him by his side, and
talked to him: and all present had their eyes upon
him, and all his friends rejoiced; but Rebia and
Shas, and his uncle Malik were bursting with rage,
when they saw Antar raised to such honour, never
conferred on any one before.

Now the cups of wine were handed round, and
the delicacies were eaten with joy and pleasure;
and they appeared secure from the vicissitudes of
fortune, whilst King Zoheir conversed familiarly
with Antar, and joked with him; he made him
drink, and kept him by him. And they continued
in this manner till the wine sported with the senses
of the guests, and all of them, and Antar too, stood
up, but the King prevented him; and when they
[94]

wished to depart, the King gave Antar a beautiful
robe, and mounted him on an Arab horse, and a
necklace of burnished gold, studded with pearls and
jewels; he presented him also with an excellent
sword; and Antar quitted the tents of King Zoheir
clothed in that superb robe and cloak, and mounted
on the Arab horse. But he soon dismounted, and
walked by the side of his father; and when they
entered the tent, Antar kissed his fatherâs feet, O
master, said he, why do you not grant me my due,
as others far and near have done? or bestow on me
what I so much desire? Tell me, said Shedad, what
you want, make known what you wish, that I may
be kind to you; I will not avariciously refuse you.
Now Shedad thought he wanted a camel to ride, or
a tent to live in; or a female slave to attend him.
But Antar replied, I request of you, O master, that
the rank and dignity of an Arab be appropriated to
me; and that you would acknowledge me as your
son, and yourself as my father, so that my rank may
be made known, and I become a chief; and in truth,
I will reward you as no one else can. I will reduce
the Arab princes themselves to your obedience,
through fear of my sword and my spear.

When Antar had finished speaking, Shedadâs
eyes started into the crown of his head, his affections
cooled, and his disorder of mind increased. Thou
base-born! he cried, hast thou forgotten that thou
hast tended the camels and the sheep, and collected
[95]

the ordure of beasts amongst the mountains? Thou
son of a slave, verily, the robe of King Zoheir plays
about thy loins, and his words float upon thine ears;
thou hast indeed made a demand, and hast raised
thyself on high; and thou wouldst make me a byword
with every one that should hear thee: nothing
have I for thee but a sword, and I will cut off thy
head. Upon this, Shedad drew his sword, as soon
as he had finished, and rushed at him, and all the
slaves ran away from him.

Now Semeeah, Shedadâs wife, overheard the dispute,
and came out of her tent, crying and lamenting.
She rushed instantly towards her husband, and
kissed his bosom, and took his sword out of his hand,
as she exclaimedâNever shall you slay him; me
shall you destroy before him. I have not forgotten
his virtues and noble deeds. Excess of wine must
have urged him to this fancy: therefore do not
punish him for what he has said. Semeeah did not
desist till she had soothed his anger, and he retired
to his tent.

But Antar was in the greatest agony; he was
ashamed that the day should dawn upon him, or
that he should remain any longer in the country;
or that he should again look his father in the face.
He accordingly went out, and sought the residence
of Malik, the Kingâs son: his clothes trailed upon
the ground through shame, and his tears flowed
from the excessive pain he endured, for intoxication
[96]

had overpowered his judgment. So he sought prince
Malik, who was just then returned from his fatherâs,
and quite rejoiced at what had passed with respect to
Antar, and the robes and presents he had received.
At this moment a slave came in, and said, Antar
wishes to be admitted into your presence. Let him
in, said Malik; and when he was introduced, Prince
Malik looked at him, and saw his tears flowing from
his tortured heart. He seated him by him, and
talked familiarly with him, and asked him what was
the matter, and what had happened to him. O my
lord, he replied, I demanded of my father the rank
and honour of an Arab; but he has abused me,
and beaten me, and wished to kill me, and has made
me a laughing stock among the Arab chiefs.

You have been wrong, said Malik to Antar, in
this sad affair; you have done that which would not,
at any rate, have induced him to acknowledge you.
âDo not, my lord, continued Antar, reprove my
ambition, which often robs me of my wits and discretion;
but had I not been intoxicated, this would not
have happened, and I should have concealed my
wishes, and submitted patiently to my misfortunes,
till death had overtaken me. But in all circumstances
thou art my master. Ah! my lord, continued he,
how often have I relieved them from their foes, and
no one ever assisted me! Know too, that I love Ibla,
the daughter of my uncle Malik; and she drives
away the sleep from my eyelids, and in my sleepless
[97]

nights I am united to her; but my father Shedad
has cut off all my hope, and misfortunes upon misfortunes
overpower me. I only demanded to be recognized
as his son, that I might be united to her;
but truly all hopes of her are completely destroyed.
No joy now remains for me, and the light of the day
is the darkness of night in my eyes. I have no home
but among the wild beasts and the reptiles.â His
agony increased, and he wept, and complained bitterly.
Sorrows and afflictions were multiplied upon
him, and the tears rushed into his eyes, as he expressed
his anguish and passion.

Had you informed me of your situation before,
said Malik, greatly distressed, and pitying him, I
would have sacrificed my person and property to
remedy it. But what was easy, has now become
difficult; Ibla will be concealed from you from this
day forward. I fear also that your father will contrive
to kill you, and that no one will be able to
relieve you. But stay here whilst I tell all this to
my father. O my lord, said Antar, the only place
of rest for me is on the highways; and I must roam
about the whole day and the live long night; for
men have conspired to destroy me, such as Rebia
and your brother Shas. He passed the whole night
with Malik, and at the dawn of day Antar mounted
his horse, and put on his armour and his cuirass.
He travelled on till he was far from the tents, and
he knew not whither he was going: sometimes he
[98]

took the left and sometimes the right, and again he
struck into the wilds and deserts, till it became
broad day. There he wandered about the rocks
and mountains, and accusing fate, he thus expressed
himself.

âI rail against fortune that relents to no upbraider,
and I demand security from the cruelties
of fortune. She one day promises fair and excites
my pride, but truly I know all her promises are
false. I have served man, and I have taken my
relations as protectors against fortune; but they
have acted like scorpions. Amongst themselves
they call me the son of Zebeebah, but in the tumultuous
rush of horsemen, I am the son of
nobles. Were it not for my love, one like me
would not humble himself to such as they; and
the lion of the waste would not fear the foxes.
Quickly my tribe will remember me, when the
horsemen come charging amongst the warriors
with their sword-blows. O that thy phantom
would visit me, O Ibla, it would see the torrents
of tears that stream from my eyelids. But I will
forbear, that my railers may have pity on me; and
that my patience may soften their hearts. Thy
station is a post in the centre of heaven, but my
hand fails in attaining the stars.â

Thus he roamed from the high road without
friend or companion. The next day the tribe heard
all that had passed between Antar and his father.
[99]

And early in the morning Prince Malik sent for
Antar; but he was not to be found: he supposed
he would return by the evening: still he came not.
Now Prince Malik was sincerely attached to Antar;
he was greatly distressed, and he did all he could to
find him. He then acquainted his father with what
had passed. As soon as the King heard the account
from his son, he was much vexed, and reproached
him. O my son, said he, why did you not immediately
tell me of this, that I might have arranged
the business? I concealed it, said he, in order not
to occasion any disturbance, and for fear of exciting
your indignation, for I have long seen my brother
Shas hates him as the vilest of men; and Rebia
will not raise his head towards him; and I see also
that many of their friends detest him. But you
love him and are interested about him; and I could
not possibly tell you an affair you would not have
approved. In the mean time Antar continued to
wander over the plains of the desert, until the day
shone, when behold! there arose, a great cloud of
dust, that darkened the country. Antar contemplated
it for some time, and then perceived forty
horsemen, each bearing a quivering spear, and a
dazzling scimitar. He directed his horse towards
them, and they proved to be of the noble tribe of
Abs, and Ghegadh the son of Nasshib was their
leader. When Antar saw them he saluted them,
and they returned the salutation; O thou son of
[100]

Zebeebah, said they, why art thou straying here?
I was hunting game, he replied, and when I saw
you, I made towards you in order to bear you company.
And we, said Ghegadh, have always distinguished
you from the other slaves, and have
always considered you in the light of a valiant
knight: and if you will join us, we will agree to
your sharing with us as a noble warrior. But how
can that be? said Antar. Know that a slave, said
Ghegadh, enjoys a half share with his masters. But,
said one of them, Antar truly deserves more than
two-thirds, and happen what will, he is a knight;
and indeed not every one that is called a knight is a
knight. They at length agreed that they would
surrender to the slave a fourth of whatever plunder
they might take.

In this manner they proceeded till they approached
the land of the tribe of Cahtan, where they saw
a great quantity of cattle, with some high-raised
tents and lofty pavilions; many horses running about
and camels grazing, and the people unsuspicious
of a reverse of fortune. Here, my cousins, said
Ghegadh, is a rich tribe, and the people few in
number; let us attack and despoil them whilst it is
dark, and we will quit their country in safety; before
morning we shall be far away among the
wastes. They instantly shook their lances in their
hands, and drew their brilliant faulchions; and as
they drove the camels and the horses from the tents
[101]

and the habitations, the men mounted to keep them
off from the women and families. But the sons of
Abs forced them back towards the tents and trampled
them down upon the ground, seizing their property
and spoil. Antar rushed down upon them, and
obliged them to fly. Do you, said Ghegadh to Antar,
drive away the cattle, and we will repulse all that
dare pursue them.

Antar drove away the cattle, and had proceeded
some way, when lo! a knight rushed out from the
ravines in the rocks, mounted on a dark coloured
colt, beautiful and compact, and it was of a race
much prized among the Arabs; his hoofs were as
flat as the beaten coin; when he neighed, he seemed
as if about to speak, and his ears like quills; his sire
was Wasil, and his dam Hemama. When Antar
cast his eyes upon the horse, and observed his speed
and his paces, and his uncommon beauty, he felt
that no horse could surpass them, so his whole
heart and soul longed for it. The Absians, indeed,
had plundered the horde and the country, but Antarâs
mind was occupied with the horse, so he galloped on
till he approached the horseman; and when the
knight perceived that Antar was making towards
him, he spurred his horse, and it fled beneath
him; for this was a renowned horseman called
Harith, the son of Obad, and he was a valiant hero.

Antar galloped after him till sunset, and he found
himself far separated from his party. Harith then
[102]

turned about to him; and when he was quite close,
said Antar to him, O young man, by the faith you
profess and believe, will you not wait for me awhile
and grant me a favour? for I see you are a noble
horseman. Hear what I have to say, and give me
an answer; I will be answerable for thy security.

O young man, said Harith, trusting to his promise,
what do you want? I see you also are a valiant
knight. Will you sell me this horse you are
riding, asked Antar, or will you give it me if you
are the owner of it? By heavens, young man,
said Harith smiling, had you accosted me thus at
first, I would have given him to you, with some
camels also, and you need not have acted thus;
but, Arab, did you ever see any one surrender his
horse and his armour in a plain like this, alone and
a stranger? and particularly a horse like this, whose
lineage is as well known as that of the noblest
warriors; for should his master be in difficulties, he
will liberate him; he moves and flies without wings;
and if you have not heard of his fame, I will tell
youâhe is called Abjer, whom Chosroe and the Grecian
Emperors and the princes of the tribe of Asfar
have anxiously wished to possess. I was angry with
my own people, and repaired to this noble tribe. I
ate with them, and remained with them a long time.
It costs me much to part with this horse, but my
heart is attached to this tribe, and is greatly distressed
about them. I am no coward in the assault
[103]

of heroes; but I was afraid lest this horse might receive
a blow that should injure him, and I therefore
only followed you, in order to draw off your
attention till the men of the tribe might overtake
you and pursue you over the hills and the wilds,
and that I might point out to them your course;
for you have invaded a tribe where there are only
women, and but a few men, unable to encounter so
fierce a foe; and I do not perceive there is a single
feeling heart among you all.

Harith having ceased speaking, I much wish you
would sell me this horse, said Antar; demand what
you please from me, for I must be the purchaser of
it. O young man, said Harith, if you are indeed
desirous of a horse, that is in this age quite invaluable,
I will not sell it but in restitution of all this
booty; and then do not imagine you will lose by your
bargain. I swear by the God who knows all secrets,
I do not avoid fighting you from the fear of death,
for I am a warrior, and can defend myself; but I
feared this horse would be injured. If you, young
man, wish to strike a bargain, and act like a man of
honour, as I am a guest of this tribe, and have eaten
with them, my wish is to ransom their property with
this horse; and had it not been for this misfortune,
I never would have parted with such an animal.

When Antar heard these words, he felt certain
that Harith was a liberal minded man, and therefore,
wishing to be on a par with him in respect to
[104]

his honourable and generous conduct: Well! said
he, I will purchase of you this horse for this booty;
and I shall be moreover exceedingly obliged: here is
my hand in faith and sincerity.

Harith dismounted from the back of his noble
steed, and gave him to Antar, who mounted him
like a king of the land far and wide; and he told
the slaves to conduct the cattle and women and
servants to their own country. Harith took them,
and went his way.

Now Antar upon Abjer watched them till they
had disappeared among the deserts; and just then
came up the Absian horsemen, and Ghegadh at
their head, who, seeing Antar standing alone in the
plain, without any of the booty, cried out, thou son
of a base slave woman, where is the plunder?
I bought with it this horse, he replied, and I have
established your honour and credit in the land of
the tribe; because I saw the owner was a man
of worth, and jealous of the honour of women,
gracious and liberal minded: I was therefore anxious
to equal him in propriety of conduct, and
would not leave behind us in this land, the remembrance
of a foul action, and be a scandal
amongst Arabs. It is the most ignominious of deeds
to take prisoners free born women; and besides
this, the spacious plain is open before us, and the
Lord God is the bestower of all things, and the
taker away; he is the distributor of every thing,
[105]

and God forbid he should send us back without a
reward.

Thou base born, cried Ghegadh, in reply to
Antar the lion-hero, We consigned them over to
your care, but you have been buying, bartering,
and selling, without asking our leave. What is
done is done, said Antar; I will make it good to
you elsewhere, if the Creator of all things pleases,
and you agree to the protection I have granted: but
if you wish to quarrel with me, I will protect my life
with the force of this sword, and this well proportioned
spear, and I will not live to forfeit my word.

Come on to this wretch, said Ghegadh inflamed
with rage, to his companions; cut him in pieces with
your cleaving scimitars, and make him drink of the
cup of death and annihilation.

Upon that, Antar went to a little distance from
them, and dismounting from Abjer, tightened his
girths, and then mounting again, galloped and charged
about, crying out to them, you base born
wretches, to day will I shew you how I fight and
thrust. Away, away, to shame and disgraceâthis
day you shall behold the furious lion. He thought
of his beloved, and thus exclaimed:

âI abuse fortune, that never softens at the voice
of the counsellor. I conceal my passion in my
heart, but my tears disclose it. My tribe is leagued
with fortune to seek my blood, and they assault
[106]

me with sword and spear. They have driven me
from the mistress I love, and I am plunged into
the well of the water of banishment. To expose my
cherished life is indifferent to me; and though I am
separated from her, my heart clings to her. O my
God, let not my life be a life of ignominy! let not
my death, O God, be among the weeping crowd!
but my corpse! let the birds hover over it, and
let the crows of the desert drink of my wounds.
God regards the man who is hospitable to his
tribe, and who becomes among them a chief in
authority. But when they see us invade their
dwellings, every warrior on a swift-paced steed,
they promise us riches, and high-bosomed damsels
with well formed hips, and beautifully-shaped
haunches. I will seize them on my horse, whose
like exists not; aye, and the youth sold it like a
man of honour. Whoever of ye, oh tribe of Abs,
wishes my death, I will appear before him in the
plain of battle, and I will charge among ye on my
stern-faced steed, and I will rush at ye as the
lion of the wilds.â

When the Absians heard Antarâs discourse, they
all shrunk from the conflict, and consulting with
each other, said, Ghegadh, what stops you? and
what occasions this fear and consternation at this
black slave? O Ghegadh, said they, you have
advised us to make the attack, and still you hold
[107]

back from the assault and the combat; you are our
superior and our adviser, so come on. O my cousin,
said Ghegadh, much troubled, wise is the man between
whom and Antar there is no contention. Explain
this, said they, ere we endanger our lives in
a contest with him. I observed, said he, when he
dismounted to tighten his girths, his gigantic mien,
his brawny arms, his full formed legs, and his cool
undaunted eye. And I, said another, saw something
more extraordinary than that. Whatâs that?
said they. One day King Zoheir gave him one of his
finest horses; he went up to it to put on the bridle;
the horse would not take it, but was riotous, and
reared at him. At the instant Antar lifted him off
the ground up to the top of his head, and dashed
him on the earth, and smashed his bones. When
they heard this account of Antar, they trembled, and
were afraid. Do you go up to him, said they,
addressing Ghegadh, give him the plunder, and do
not make it appear that we are afraid of him, that
his avidity may not increase to our detriment, and
he say, âI will not quit one of ye till I have slain
him and taken his spoil.â

So Ghegadh went up to him, O my cousin, said
he, are you not ashamed to engage in battle against
your cousins, when they were only joking and making
merry? O my cousins, said Antar, convinced
they were afraid of him, I would not do any thing
that could be thought wrong, but I have purchased
[108]

this horse, who will carry me against your enemies;
and you know that when a person seeks to destroy
another, it is necessary to defend oneâs self. Ghegadh
continued to speak flatteringly to Antar, till he
softened him and cajoled him. O Arab Chieftains,
said Antar, I have not forgotten your kindness, and
I am but your slave. I am grateful for all you
have done for me, and had it not been for you, I
should not be known among the Arabs.

It was not fear that dictated these words, but in
order to observe their sentiments towards him.

He has indeed purchased this horse, said Ghegadh
to his comrades, in order to destroy our enemies,
let us therefore grant it him. Be it so, said they
all. Thus Antar became possessed of Abjer, whose
equal no prince or emperor possessed. By way of
precaution, Antar kept away from Ghegadh and his
companions, who went on talking to each other.
How that base-born has succeeded to his wish, said
they, for verily that horse was worth his weight in
gold; we shall indeed be disgraced among the
Arabs! Antar proceeded on before them and heard
all they said.

Now they continued their march till evening,
when they reached a spot abounding in trees and
streams; wide and extensive were the surrounding
plains. They dismounted and let their horses graze,
and seated themselves whilst Antar stood watch over
them, for their and his own safety. They did not
[109]

move from this spot till morning dawned, when they
mounted their horses and marched till evening;
when suddenly from the upper part of the desert
a great dust appeared, and through it they distinguished
a lofty howdah, and on its top there was a
crescent of gold. The howdah was richly ornamented
with velvet; in front were damsels and slaves,
and they wore robes of divers colours, and behind
were horsemen mounted on steeds all of different
colours. No sooner saw they this procession and
these fine garments, than they were sure it was a
bride in the howdah; but they knew not her husband,
nor any one connected with her. This is
our plunder, said they; God has sent it to us in
recompense for what has befallen us. They instantly
bent their heads over their saddle-bows, and violently
assaulted the party, and got possession of the
howdah and all its accompaniments. But when the
horsemen that attended the howdah beheld them,
they attacked them, and man met man, and hero
assaulted hero; blood was shed and spilt, and the
horror was great: and in a moment the Absians
were assisted by the deeds of Antar, the devouring
lion, for his attack was the attack of an overpowering
warrior. And three score and ten were the
horsemen that accompanied the bride: he destroyed
sixty of them; and the rest fled, five to the right and
five to the left.

The Absians having taken possession of the howdah
[110]

and the property with the dispersed cattle, and a
vast quantity of articles besides, asked the slaves
about the bride, who was her husband, and who
her father? Arabs, said they, she is called Aminah,
the daughter of Yezid, the son of Handhalah, surnamed
the Blood-drinker, the chief of all the
princes of Tey; and her husband, to whom she is
going, is called Nakid, the son of Jellah, a warlike
and bold horseman, the protector of the race of
Marah; and you have executed this villainous act
of violence upon us, and have ventured on this hazardous
enterprize!!

They proceeded, and passed over the deserts and
the wilds, the lady weeping and lamenting at the
misfortune that had overwhelmed her. But when
Antar heard from the slave this account of her
father and her husband, he was convinced he would
come down on her account, and that a great battle
and slaughter would ensue between them, and he
wished the Absians should feel his power and weight,
for what he had heard them say about himself. So
he came toward them. God has granted you victory
and safety, said he: and thou too, they answered,
he has also given thee cause to rejoice. You
are aware, said Antar, that this plunder is much
more valuable and precious than the former; let us
put it out in lots and divide it, and let us give to
each his portion, that he may defend it with his soul
and body.

[111]

You, Antar, took the first plunder for yourself
alone, said one, and do you demand your share of
the second? With respect to the first plunder, O
my cousins, said Antar, did you not give it me?
and it is not customary with chiefs to take back
their donations. The fellow, said Ghegadh, is right
in what he says; divide the spoil, and give him half
of one of your shares. Arabs, treat me fairly, cried
Antar, and speak the truth. Ghegadh got into a
passion, What do you mean? said he. According
to our agreement, said Antar, which was settled between
you and me, of all the plunder we should
take, I was to have one half of the whole; and all
of you the other half.

Rage filled the heart of Ghegadh. Thou son of
Zebeebah, thy avarice demands impossibilities; thou
art indeed mad, and a villain. Verily thou hast
not kept thy word; and O, had the day never
come that we met thee in this road! No one, said
Antar, is mad, but he who keeps company with
you, and agrees to your demands; for ye are a set
of fellows of little justice, and great oppression and
violence; the fact is, I will not take a jot less than
one half of the plunder, even were my soul to drink
of the cup of death. Come on, on to this black
slave, cried Ghegadh to his friends, who rebels,
and outrages us. Upon this they all jumped up,
and cried out against Antar, resolved to kill him,
and make him drink of the cup of annihilation.
[112]

Antar went apart from them for a while into the
rocky plain, then galloped, and challenged them to
the contest, thus addressing them;â

âWhen my foe sues me for a debt, I settle the
debt with the Redeinian spear:
[2]
my scimitarâs
edge shall extirpate ye all, and shall justly
decide between you and me. I am exalted by
my sword and spear far above the minutest stars
and the two bears. Foul wretches! ye know not
my power, but the inhabitants of the two hemispheres
shall feel it. The grasp of fortune has
not destroyed my strength, and the fingers of
time have not been stretched out against me.
Many a horseman have I left sprawling, his
cheeks grovelling, his hands dyed in blood, whilst
the birds of death hover round him, and the magpies
assemble over his corpse.â

His verses finished, he was about to attack them,
when lo! a dust arose and covered the whole country.
In a short time the cloud opened and discovered
three hundred horsemen, all clad in steel, and
the father of the damsel, the Blood-drinker, appeared
in front of them. He roared like a lion; his sword
was an Indian blade. Whither would ye flee, O
ye base-born, he cried outâI am he, surnamed the
Blood-drinker, the Cahtanian.

Now the cause of the arrival of these men was
[113]

this: out of the ten that escaped by flight from the
combat, five went to the father of the damsel, the
lion of the land, and five went to Nakid the son of
Jellah; but the residence of her father happened to
be the nearest. So he set off with three hundred
men, all stern lions, and he galloped on till he overtook
the Absians, as we have mentioned; and it
was he who prevented the combat between the
Absians and Antar.

When Antar saw the father of the damsel coming
onâSee where the heroes advance, he cried; now
protect your plunder, if ye are men of valourâno
portion is mine, neither great nor small, not a camel
or a sheep. I will quit you, and will neither be with
you nor against you. He spurred away his Abjer
from them, and mounted to the top of a high hill;
he took his feet out of the stirrups, and sat
cross-legged upon the neck of his horse, resting on
his dreadful spear, and there he remained contemplating
the terrors of the approaching conflict.

The Blood-drinker cried aloud to his warriors; and
they rushed down upon the Absians, and men encountered
men, heroes heroes; and blood was spilt
and shed. In a moment swords clashed, every heart
and feeling were roused; heads flew off like balls,
and hands like leaves of trees. The Teyans rushed
upon the race of Abs; also the Blood-drinker
assailed them in his courage, and released his
daughter. The Absians quitted their plunder, for
[114]

their souls could not stand firm; and they fled over
the wilds.

Now when Antar perceived this defeat, he replaced
his feet in the stirrups, and raising his spear
from the ground, pounced down from the height
like an eagle, or a wild beast when it rushes from
its den; and he roared out to them in a loud voice
that made the mountains rebellow. O ye ignoble
dastards, I am Antar, the son of Shedad! And
he urged on Abjer, who started under him like
a flash of lightning, or a tearing arrow: his eye-balls
turned red, and foam issued from his lips: he
shrieked aloud in front of the horses, and immediately
they shrunk back on their haunches, and
hurled their riders from their backs: and the heroes
were scattered over the desert and the wilderness.
In less than an hour he drove them from the
plunder. As soon as the Absians heard the sound
of Antar from under the cloud of dust,âVerily,
Antar, the magnanimous warrior, will overcome
them, said they; may God assist him! This is indeed
true intrepidity, and he deserves half the spoil;
for if the heroes drink the cup of death, the greatest
share will fall to him, for verily the eye of the
sun cannot be concealed. Thus their hearts were
purified towards Antar, and they all returned to his
assistance.

When the Blood-drinker saw the Absians resume
the contest, he said to the people about him, The
[115]

horseman of Abs and Adnan are coming down, and
this day will they bring death and destruction upon
us; and he let the reins hang loose and fled. The
Teyans spread themselves over the plains and the
desert, following him in every direction, whilst
Antar, having already slain about eighty men, approached
the plunder; and when all were fled, the
Absian horsemen came up, and there was not one
but praised and thanked him. So they took up the
spoil, and the property, and the prisoners, and the
bride, and departed, seeking the land of the tribe of
Abs, and rejoicing in their victory and triumph;
every one in astonishment at Antarâs intrepidity.

But as soon as the other five that fled informed
Nakid, the husband of the bride, the light became
dark in his eyes, and he shouted out to the tribe of
MaanâTo horse! to horse! and ere an hour had
passed, five thousand valiant horsemen were ready,
and he marched at the head of them in hopes of
overtaking the race of Abs, and of overwhelming
them in perdition and death, and of rooting out
every vestige of them, so that not a record of them
should exist. For indeed he was a warrior ferocious
as a lion, one of the thousand heroes in those days
of darkness. He travelled on night and day that
he might overtake the tribe of Abs before they could
reach their own country. Meanwhile they pursued
their journey, seeking their own lands, when a dust
[116]

arose behind them, and darkened the whole region:
it opened, and discovered the Maanites headed by
Nakid. At this sight they were convinced of their
destruction and death, as they said one to another,
Verily the tribe of Maan have overtaken us! They
looked towards Antar, and they perceived him smiling
and rejoicing at the arrival of the warriors.
Verily, said they, O my cousin, the foe is come up
with us, and to day will our booty be torn away, and
our sculls will fly off. Know, my cousins, said Antar,
that death will not be wanting, neither will it increase;
but I have long wished for such a day as this,
for I have not given up the tribe of Abs; my heart
is fixed on returning home; and this fortuitous circumstance
has happened to us by the will of Him
who disposes life and death. Now is the flame of war
at hand, and sorrow and anguish are approaching.
Whoever among you is ready to fight, let him fight;
whoever wishes to fly, let him fly; but for me, I
will drink of their cups, I will contend with their
heroes; and thus he continued in verse:

âThis day the race of Abs shall behold my combat,
and my actions in the contest when I charge.
I will seize their property: aye, and the double of
it with my supple, quick-moving, death-bearing
spear. I will destroy the brave in war with my Indian
blade, and I will drive down among them like
a devouring lion. I will rave among their horsemen
[117]

with my determined courage, and I will
charge, and I will rush over them in the battle.
I am the Knight of Knights, the lion whom no
human being can withstand. The lions in their
dens tremble at me, and in the day of battle the
Ghuols fly from me.â

When Antar had finished, he encountered the
warriors with most penetrating thrusts and rending
blows. The Absians were obliged to endure it with
him, and to assist him in the horrors. The messengers
of death were distributed amongst the conquerors and
the conquered; the sharp-edged swords came in contact
with them, and the straight lances glided through
them. The Absians repented of their firmness and
fled over the plains, whilst alone Antar encountered
the whole calamity; and he stood firm, like one
resolved to avert shame and disgrace. He aimed at
the breasts of the heroes with overpowering assaults
and thrusts, that would have made the deep-rooted
mountains totter.

When Nakid saw the battle of Antar, and how
alone he stood against five thousand, and was making
them drink of the cup of death and perdition, he
was overwhelmed with astonishment at his deeds.
Thou valiant slave, he cried, how potent is thine
armâhow strong is thy wrist! And he rushed down
upon Antar, that his bride might behold a proof of
his courage: and Antar, seeing that he was making at
him, presented himself before him, for he was all
[118]

anxiety to meet him. O thou base-born, cried Nakid,
son of an uncircumcised mother! But Antar permitted
him not to finish his speech, before he assaulted him
with the assault of a lion, and roared at him: he was
horrified and paralyzed at the sight of Antar. Antar
attacked him thus scared and petrified, and struck
him with his sword on the head, and cleft him down
to the back, and he fell, cut in twain, from the horse,
and he was split in two as if by a scale; and as
Antar dealt the blow, he cried out âO by Abs!
O by Adnan! I am ever the lover of Ibla.â

No sooner did the tribe of Maan behold Antarâs
blow, than every one was seized with fear and dismay.
The whole five thousand made an attack like
the attack of a single man; but Antar received them
as the parched ground receives the first of the rain,
exhibiting to them his power and his courage. His
eye-balls were fiery red, and foam issued from the
corners of his lips; wherever he smote, he cleft the
head; every warrior he assailed he annihilated; and
as the warriors still pressed on him, he tore a rider
from the back of his horse, he heaved him on
high, and whirling him in the air, struck down a
second with him, and the two instantly expired.
âBy thine eyes, O Ibla,â he cried, âto-day will
I destroy all this race.â Thus he proceeded until
he terrified the warriors, and hurled them into woe
and disgrace, hewing off their arms and their joints.
At length the five thousand retreated from the
[119]

combat, for fear and terror had completely shaken
them, and more than nine hundred horsemen he had
slain, and gained an entire victory over them.

Just as Antar had nearly annihilated them, there
appeared a dust that darkened the whole land. In
an hour it was cleared, and there came forth a troop
of heroes; at their head was an horseman like an
eagle, mounted on an horse that moved like a cloud.
The rider was handsome, in the bloom of youth,
and every tongue cried out, O by Abs! O by
Adnan! Now this knight was Malik, King Zoheirâs
son. And he was coming in search of Antar,
in consequence of the affair that took place between
Antar and his father, who, when he demanded the
rank and consideration of a son, wished to put him
to death. Now Malik was expecting Antar the
next day, but as he came not, he went and acquainted
his father the King with all that had happened.
Zoheir instantly sent for Shedad, who kissed the
ground. Why do you not grant Antarâs request,
and call him your son, as every one else does? asked
King Zoheir: Think you, Shedad, that amongst
the tribes of Cahtan and Adnan there is a more intrepid
warrior than your son Antar, or a bolder heart
than his? O my Lord, answered Shedad, he is
indeed my son, and a part of my heart; but my
brother Malik said to me, if you acknowledge Antar
as your son, I will abandon myself to the Arab
tribes; therefore, on account of my brother Malik,
[120]

I have renounced him. Well, then, said Zoheir, I
will have him return to his country in spite of his
foes. And he dispatched a slave to gain information
and to follow him. He waited until the slave returned,
and told him that Antar had associated
himself with Ghegadh, the son of Nashid, and at
that moment he was, single handed, engaged with
five thousand horsemen, and Nakid the son of Jellah.
Malik wept. May God, said he, prosper him,
for he has devoted himself to death and destruction;
never will he fly or retreat; but by the life of my
father King Zoheir, I must aid him, and if he is
dead, never will I return till I have taken vengeance
on his foes, and made his murderers drink of the
loathsome cup. He set out, and appeared as we
have just mentioned, and rushed forward with his
troops as we have described.

But as soon as Malik and his people came forward,
and the men had recognized each other,
Antar felt his power expanded, for at that moment
the enemy had resolved to slay his heroes. But at
the sight of his friend Malik and his warriors, his
heart revived, and he exhibited the whole courage
of his soul; and he made a most desperate attack
upon his antagonists, and overwhelmed them in
total ruin.

When the tribe of Maan saw Antarâs destructive
force, and his sweeping blows, and that the Absians
were come to his assistance, their only resource was
[121]

flight, and retreat over the plains and wilds; for
they said to each other, When Antar was alone, we
could not resist him, What shall we do now, that the
tribe of Abs and Adnan are come to his aid? So
they took to flight and ran away in confusion, whilst
Antar and the tribe of Abs having pursued them for
three parasangs, returned for the scattered cattle and
dispersed horses. Antar dismounted from Abjer, and
running up to his friend Malik, wished to kiss his
feet in the stirrup, but Malik would not permit him,
and kissed him between the eyes, and rejoiced in his
safety. And there was not one of the Absians but
came up to Antar, and congratulated him on his
victory and triumph. Antar thanked them. They
halted there that night, and the next day they set
out seeking their own country: Antar riding by the
side of Malik, and relating to him all his adventures
with Ghegadh and his companions, and how he obtained
his horse Abjer. Malik informed him of all
that had passed between him and King Zoheir,
how he had sent after his father Shedad, and had
threatened him. Antar was glad, and foreboded
well, and felt convinced that his marriage might
take place as long as King Zoheir was on his side:
so that his love for Ibla increased. They thus proceeded
on their journey till they came near to their
homes; when Antarâs passion seizing him, he thus
exclaimed:

âWhen the breezes blow from Mount Saadi,
[122]

their freshness calms the fire of my love and
transports. Let my tribe remember I have preserved
their faith; but they feel not my worth,
and preserve not their engagements with me.
Were there not a maid settled in the tents, why
should I prefer their society to absence? Slimly
made is she, and the magic influence of her eye
preserves the bones of a corpse from entering
the tomb. The sun as it sets, turns towards her,
and says, Darkness obscures the land, do thou rise
in my absence; and the brilliant moon calls out
to her, Come forth, for thy face is like me when I
am at the full, and in all my glory! The Tamarisk
trees complain of her in the morn and the eve,
and say, Away, thou waning beauty, thou form of
the laurel! She turns away abashed and throws
aside her veil, and the roses are scattered from her
soft fresh cheeks. She draws her sword from
the glances of her eye-lashes, sharp and penetrating
as the blade of her forefathers, and with
it her eyes commit murder, though it be sheathed:
is it not surprising that a sheathed sword should
be so sharp against its victims! Graceful is every
limb, slender her waist, love-beaming are her
glances, waving is her form. The damsel passes
the night with musk under her veil, and its fragrance
is increased by the still fresher essence of
her breath. The lustre of day sparkles from
her forehead, and by the dark shades of her
[123]

curling ringlets, night itself is driven away. When
she smiles, between her teeth is a moisture composed
of wine, of rain, and of honey. Her throat
complains of the darkness of her necklaces. Alas!
alas! the effects of that throat and that necklace!
Will fortune ever, O daughter of Malik,
ever bless me with thy embrace, that would cure
my heart of the sorrows of love? If my eye could
see her baggage camels, and her family, I would
rub my cheeks on the hoofs of her camels. I will
kiss the earth where thou art; mayhap the fire of
my love and extacy may be quenched. Shall
thou and I ever meet as formerly on Mount
Saadi? or will the messenger come from thee to
announce thy meeting, or will he relate that thou
art in the land of Nejd? Shall we meet in the
land of Shureba and Hima, and shall we live in
joy and in happiness? I am the well known Antar,
the chief of his tribe, and I shall die: but when
I am gone, history shall tell of me.â

Antarâs eloquence and intrepidity made the
Princeâs heart bound with joy, for not an Arab
amongst the neighbouring or distant tribes could
equal him. Verily, said Malik, the spirit of God
animates you, and inspires your mind; for you
have attained the full expression of words, and are
perfect in rhymes. They went on, passing over the
wilds and the deserts, until they approached their
own country, when Malik sent forward one of his
[124]

men to give notice of his coming. The messenger
preceded them, and informed King Zoheir of the
approach of his son, and of Antar the bold warrior,
at which being greatly rejoiced, he went out with all
his noble comrades, except Rebia and Shas, to meet
them: for these two were not pleased at the return
of Antar; and Malik also, the father of Ibla, would
not congratulate him. But Shedad mounted with
King Zoheir, and went to meet Antar, for his entrails
yearned after him. They went out thus, and did not
stop till they met the Prince and Antar; and when
they came near, Antar dismounted, and hastening
towards him, kissed the hand of King Zoheir. But
the King bent down towards him and kissed him
between the eyes, and congratulated him on his
safety. Think you, O Antar, said he, that we have
forgotten you since you quitted us in anger?
Could our homes give us any pleasure when thou
wert absent, and hadst abandoned thy country?

O King, replied Antar, having kissed the Kingâs
feet, thou whose command is obeyed among the
whole nation of Arabs, O high minded Prince! I
swear by your unbounded generosity and your noble
mind, my departure was not the effect of passion;
I am but a lowly slave and dependant; I did indeed
depart the night I had been with your majesty, for
my tongue had swerved from the road of propriety
with my father; my ambition aimed at impossibilities,
and I demanded what in fact only a fool
[125]

would have demanded. As soon as I was safe
from his vengeance, and his kindness and favour
were withdrawn from me, I could not, after such a
fault, do otherwise than change my home; till at
last my lord Malik interested himself so much about
me, and delivered me from death and perdition; he
has also informed me what interest you have taken
in me: so that my situation is improved, and I am
reconciled to my master Shedad; and you have
loaded me with obligations, mountains could not
sustain. May you ever be under the protection of
God! Thus Antar went on talking with the King,
when, Shedad coming up to him, Antar ran towards
him and kissed his feet in the stirrup, thus saying;

âO my Lord, I am come begging forgiveness;
the slave is come like a criminal; the sword and
warhorse would fail, should presumption ever
bear sway.â

When Shedad heard these words, and saw his
humility, and considered all he had done, and his
wonderful intrepidity, and truly Arabian nobleness
of soul; all his affections were excited, and his eyes
almost shed tears as he said in his heart, may God
curse every one who from this day forward would
renounce him, and may the sword despoil his life!
He kissed him between the eyes, and Antar walked
before his father, after he had saluted his uncles,
and his relations. The whole tribe of Abs were
astonished at his noble conduct and courage, and
[126]

they said one to another, No one possesses what his
masters possess.

Now Antar felt no unworthy thought of fear
respecting his father or his uncles, and only the
passion that humbles warriors, humbled him.
Malik presented the plunder to his father, and
pressed him to accept it; and he divided the cuirasses,
and armour, and horses, and coats of mail among
the tribe of Abs who were with him at first. But
King Zoheir took Aminia to his own tent, saying,
This is a Princess, and the daughter of a King, it is
not proper that she should be bought and sold.
Thus they all departed home after the King had
made up matters between Antar and his family and
relations, and recommended him to their kindness.
The King soon after heard from Antar an account
of all his adventures, and how he had obtained his
horse Abjer. And when he looked at him he was
quite surprised at his qualities, and he said to his
son Malik, This horse has been made for no one
but Antar. And from that day he was surnamed
Aboolfawaris.

Now Iblaâs father addressed his son, saying; My
son, verily death would be preferable to this state
of things; how is it that this slave of ours, one
whom we employed in tending our flocks, is now
raised far in dignity above us with our King? And
this it is that makes him so presumptuous with us
and your sister Ibla, and thus will our honour be
[127]

debased. There is nothing else to be done, said
Amroo, but to marry my sister Ibla to one who can
protect her against him, and then let us depart from
this land; for King Zoheir and his sons are strong
in his favour. But, said his father, O my son, must
we leave this slave safe and well? No, by the faith
of an Arab we must contrive his death. So they
all retired to their tents, and were united to their
families.

Now Antar came to his mother Zebeeba. Why,
my son, said she, do you not by my side tend the
flocks and the camels? It would be more agreeable
to my heart than all this intrepidity and boldness,
which every day expose your life to perils and
dangers. Antar smiled at her sayings; O mother,
he replied, thou shalt see in thy son Antar what shall
be registered and recorded.

Antar gave away to his father and his uncles all
the plunder he had obtained; though this was not
his own idea, but at the instigation of Prince Malik.
This Prince, when they were all established
in their tents, related to his father and his brothers
all he had seen Antar perform, and his undaunted
conduct. The King took great pleasure in what he
told of Antar, and being very desirous of hearing
all he said both in verse and prose, ordered Antar
into his presence, and as soon as he arrived, he
made obeisance, and prayed for a continuance of
his power and beneficence. Zoheir and his sons
[128]

welcomed him, and the King made him sit down
by him, and supplied him with wine; and his kindness
for him increased. Aboolfawaris, said he,
I wish to hear from yourself, the account of your
expedition, and what happened to you, with your
comrades, for my son Malik has related some of
your hardy deeds, and has repeated some of your
poetry; but there is no reporter of words and acts
like the actor himself. Upon that, Antar commenced
and told them all that occurred with Ghegadh and
his comrades, how he happened to associate with
them, and how he agreed to their proposal of giving
him half of all they should gain, and how they
wished to kill him for buying the horse Abjer,
and how they gave up their design on hearing his
verses and discourse. Will you, said King Zoheir,
let us hear the verses you made on your mistress
Ibla, when you came nigh home?

âWhen the breezes blow from Mount Saadi,
their freshness cools the fire of my love and my
transport.â And he continued the repetition, till
he came to this part, âShe is elegantly formed,
and the soft magic of her eyes would arrest the
bones of a corpse from entering the tomb.â

When Antar had finished, the Kingâs astonishment
and delight were unbounded at his eloquence;
and he turned towards his brother Asyed, and said,
O my brother, I wish you would pay attention to
Antar, and write down all he says, that we may
[129]

be reckoned amongst the most eloquent Arabs for
poetry and propriety of conduct. They continued to
drink their wine, and the hours passed in mirth and
pleasure. But when Shas saw that his father became
so exceedingly kind to Antar, his agony and distress
of mind increased, and from the excess of his
indignation his heart was near bursting; however
he resisted till Antar accidentally left the tent for
a while. When Shas being alone, turned round to
his father; indeed, my father, said he, this black
slave, this base-born, has brought indelible shame
upon us, and it is all on account of his love of
Ibla, the daughter of Malik; and you also approve
his conduct; but verily the whole tribe will be
shocked with his wickedness when they hear his
verses.

The King was exceedingly angry, and wrath appeared
in his countenance. My son, said he, what
sayâst thou? Who is able to thwart the decrees of
Providence? Perhaps God has resolved to testify
in him his divine favours! And know, my son, the
most ignorant of men is an envious man. Now
Antar just then entered, and as he had overheard
all their conversation, he thus spoke:â

âThis flame is for Ibla, O my friend, her lustre
illumines the darkest night. She blazesâher
form is in my heart, and the fire of love is in my
soul. Her gently waving form has kindled it
like the branches whose motion refreshes the
[130]

breeze. Her breath diffuses a lively odour, and
in her perfumes I pass the night in paradise.
She is a maid whose breath is sweeter than
honey, whenever she sips the juice of the grape.
When I taste a coolness from her lips, she leaves
in my mouth a hot burning flame. The moon
has stolen her charms, and the antelope has borrowed
the magic of her eyes. O grant me thy
embrace, O light of my eyes, and save me from
thy absence, and mine own griefs. Be just, if thou
wishest, or persecute me; for in thee is my paradise,
and in thee is my hell. No happiness is
there for me in my troubles, but my lord, who is
called the generous Zoheir. Wherever he goes,
death anticipates him; and he destroys his foes before
he meets them. Let them not abuse him if he
aid a solitary creature, who spends the live-long
night without sleep, and in tears. He is my support
and stay against those who, when they see my
exaltation, would trouble me the more. He is a
King to whose name Princes shall bow, and shall
point at him to pay their homage. He is the
asylum of all who refer to him to dissipate their
sorrows, as he relieves my griefs. May fortune
never deprive me of my King! May he ever live
in the purest joy and felicity!â

The King was so pleased with Antar, that he said,
O Aboolfawaris, whatever I can give you for your
poetry will be an insufficient return; even were I
[131]

to give all I possess; for my property will pass away
as if it had never been, but thy praises will endure
for ever. So he presented him two virgin slaves,
beautiful as moons, and two rows of large jewels,
and some perfumes, saying, Aboolfawaris, you have
often mentioned me in your poetry; it would be
disgraceful in me to let you go away from me unrewarded,
so calm thy heart and cheer thine eye; for
by the faith of an Arab, I will not be separated
from you until you obtain every thing you wish,
and accomplish all your desires. Did you belong to
me, I would admit you to my rank and connections,
in spite of the blame the Arabs might heap
on me.

Shas could not endure this, and rose up and
quitted the place, but Antar remained drinking with
the King till the evening, when he arose, and his
hand was in the hand of Prince Malik; and they all
departed from the tents, and went their way each to
his own dwelling. Antar did not stop till he reached
the habitations of the family of Carad, where he
perceived a very strong light: he understood it not,
but he went towards it and entered his motherâs
tent, and asked what was the reason of this light at
such an hour. Know, my son, said she, the men of
the camp are absent; they are gone with your master
Shedad, and with him are also ten horsemen after
the cattle, in order that they may release them from
some Arabs; and the women are watching to this
[132]

hour in the expectation of seeing you, that you may
relate to them all that has happened to you in your
expeditions; and Ibla the daughter of Malik is more
delighted than any of them.

When Antar heard the words of his mother, he
joyed in his heart, and a smile lighted up his countenance.
So he immediately arose and sought the
dwellings of his uncles, and entered the womenâs
apartments. As soon as they saw him they arose
and received him, and saluted him. Semeeah kissed
him. O Antar, said she, you have been with the
King from the beginning of the day, and we are
sitting up on your account. O my mistress, said
Antar, I knew nothing of it, but had I known it, I
would not have tarried, had my legs been even tied
and fettered; and he thus addressed them:

âDarkness hovers over, and my tears stream down
in copious torrents. I conceal my love and complain
to no one. I pass the night, regarding the
stars of night in my distraction, and the tears rush
violently from my eyes like a hail storm. Ask
the night of me, and it will tell thee that I am
indeed the ally of sorrow and anguish. I live
desolate, there is no one like me; a lover without
friends or a companion! I am the friend of sorrow
and desire. I am oâerwhelmed by them, and
I am worn out with patience and trials in my
grief. I complain to God of my afflictions and my
love; and to no one else do I complain.â

[133]

Ibla heard these verses, and perceived his tears and
distress and his sorrow; she pitied him; and as she
remarked the violence of his tears, they interceded
greatly for him, for she loved him for his courage and
his eloquence; and as she noticed him with the flattering
soothing expressions,âWhere, said she, is my
share of the plunder; or am I now of no consequence
or value to thee? At these words the sight of her
beauty and loveliness overpowered him. O my mistress,
cried he, by the light of thine eyes and the black
of thine eyebrows, to me the most sacred of oaths,
thy slave Antar has obtained of plunder neither a
small nor a large portion, but the whole I have
given to thy father and thy uncles. So he presented
her the two slave girls and the two strings of jewels
that King Zoheir had given him; and he addedâthe
perfumes thou hast no occasion for; thy breath
is more delicious and more heavenly; thy perfume
is sweeter and more luscious. So he divided the
perfumes between the wives of his father and his
uncles. And to his questions about his father and
his uncles, whither they were gone?

âKnow, Antar, said Semeeah, that your master told
us that there is a horseman of Yemen, called Kais,
the son of Dibgan, and he is a horseman of the land
of Yemen, and under his subjection are the lands
of Senaa and Aden; he has at this time invaded the
land of Hejaz with forty horsemen: he is now on his
return, and with him an immense plunder, and he is
[134]

seeking his own country. Shedad enquired of the
peasants who gave him this information, where Kais
was to rest this night and sleep: they told him at
the lake of Jaree, in the country of Doom. Then said
Shedad, by the faith of an Arab, I will go against
him in the dark, and will attack him and take his
plunder from him, and will reduce him to shame and
disgrace; and if there should be a thousand horsemen,
I will not permit the tribe of Cahtan to escape
with plunder taken from the land of Abs and
Adnan. He accordingly mounted, and took with
him ten horsemen, and he set out to follow their
track.â

When Antar heard this, he got up without delay,
and kissing the mother of Ibla, and also Ibla between
the eyesâthis is the kiss of farewell, said he,
for I know not when we shall meet again: and having
eased his heart by gazing upon her, he returned to
his mother, and put on his armour and his cuirass:
he mounted his horse, and taking Shiboob with
him, he departed in quest of his father and his
uncles. And when they had advanced some way,
said Shiboob to himâO my brother, a female
slave of my master Shedad said to meââTell your
brother Antar to be on his guard against his father
Shedad and his uncles, for they have resolved on
putting him to death. This Ibla heard from her
brother Amroo and her father Malik, and told Semeeah,
and directed her to warn you of it: now I
[135]

have told you be or your guard.â Run on, father
of the winds! was Antarâs reply. He urged forward
Abjer and they went on for some time till it
became very hot, when a horseman met them
coming from the centre of the plain. Antar marked
him, and behold he was one of the men that had
accompanied Shedad, and he was covered with
wounds. When they came nearer to him, said
Antar, Where is the plunder? O Aboolfawaris,
he replied, I have got these wounds which you
see in my body on account of it, for truly we sallied
out with your master Shedad at night-fall, that we
might overtake Kais, the son of Dibgan, and when
we came up with him, we saw him carefully
guarding his spoil. As soon as he perceived us
he started up, he shouted out and assaulted us with
the vehemence of a lion; first he speared me, then
after me your father Shedad; I have returned to
seek you and bring you; so if you wish to overtake
them, make haste, and if you rescue them âtwill be
noble of you.

By the faith of an Arab, exclaimed Antar, never
will I return till I have destroyed the whole party
with my sword, and have liberated my father and
my uncles; and I will not return but with the
whole plunder before me; so away home, and I will
revenge you. Aboolfawaris, he replied, I am not
able to retain my seat on the back of my horse. So
Antar ordered Shiboob to place him by the side of
[136]

a pool of water. Shiboob came to him and placed
him by the side of the lake, and tied up his horse,
where they quitted him, and proceeded over the
plains and deserts until the day closed, when they
came up with Kais and his prisoners that were
marching before him, Kais following them with his
comrades. As soon as Antar saw his father and his
uncles tied across their horses, he indeed knew not
then the heavens from the earth, and he gave a
shout that made the mountains tremble. âYe
ignoble dastards! Quit your plunder. Come on!
Slaughter is the word!â

No sooner heard Kais the shout of Antar, than
he was alarmed and confounded; he pricked on his
horse, and turned round upon Antar; but Antar
cried out to himâSon of Dibgan, who hast urged
thee against the warriors of Abs and Adnan, whom
none shall attack but the eagles shall devour his
flesh? Thou vilest of Negroes, cried Kais, thou
shalt soon see that I am a man not to be wearied in
the contest of spears; and as he fell on Antar like the
fall of fate and destiny, he thus burst forthâ

âI am renowned in every nation for the thrust
of the spear and the blow of the sword. I am the
destroyer of horsemen with the lance, when the
spears are interwoven under the dust. How
many contests have I waged on the day of battle,
whose terrors would turn grey the head of
infants! Long-ago have I drunk the blood of
[137]

horsemen, with which they fed me before I was
weaned. This day will I prove my words when
the blood streams from my sword. This foul
wretch I will slay with the edge of my sword, that
cleaves through the flesh before the bones. His
dwellings shall this eve be found waste and desolate,
and I will not swerve from my word: his body
shall lie on the deserts, cut down, and his face
thou mayâst see grovelling in the dust.â

As soon as Antar heard this speech of Kais,
son of Dibgan, Silence, said he, may thy mother
bewail thee! and thus he replied to him.

âVerily, thy spirit has urged thee to abuse me,
and thou hast spoken the words of a vile dastard:
thou art ignorant of my exploits in every battle,
from the land of Irak to the sacred shrine: thou
shalt have no time to reply, no justice but the
sword; for ignorance among mankind is a trait
that conducts the ignorant to their death. This
is the scene of conflict, and in it doubtless will be
proved the skill of the coward and the base-born.
Let him repent who has only shewn his vanity,
and let him prefer flight to resistance. I am Antar,
and my name is far spread for the thrust of my
spear and the blow of my sword.â

When Antar had finished, equally impetuous was
his assault: he drew forth his scimitar, and struck
him between the eyes, and split his helmet and wadding,
and his sword worked down to his thighs,
[138]

down even to the back of the horse; and he cried
outâThou wretch, I will not be controuledâI am
still the lover of Ibla. Thus Kais and his horse fell
down, cut into four pieces!

When Shedad and Malik and his son Amroo
saw what Antar had done, they trembled and
were afraid, and from that day a dread of Antar
filled their hearts. But Antar rushed amongst the
remainder like a devouring lion. When the tribe
of Dibgan perceived the force of Antarâs blows, and
how he overthrew their chief, and split him and his
horse into four pieces, they wheeled about their
horses and fled. Antar pursued them, and having
slain twenty of their men, returned. He roared
even as a lion in his wrath;âhe took possession of
the plunder; he released his father, his uncles, and
the other horsemen, and they all rejoiced in their
delivery, except Malik and Amroo his son, who said:
âOh! that we had fallen by the sword, rather
than be rescued by Antar, the slave of Shedad!
But they concealed their anguish, and appeared to
be stout of heart, and thankful to Antar, though, in
fact, their galls burst with spite. They drove forward
the plunder, and returned seeking their own
country, whilst Antar embraced his father and
uncles, and thus spoke.

âAs I approach my friends, my transports increase,
and on their account my cheeks are
bedewed with tears. This day I march towards
[139]

them, and I am surrounded by the chiefs of my
tribe. I have slain the son of Dibgan, a lion in
battle, and with my Indian scimitar I have cured
my pains. I have engaged to cleanse their hearts
from sorrow. I have rescued my tribe, and that
is my dearest reward. My companion, whenever
I march by night, is my sword and my spear; and
the DÃ¦mons of the earth dread my vehemence.
O Ibla, how many horsemen have I raised up on
my double-edged cleaving scimitar in my strength!
O Ibla, how many horsemen, in the midst of the
war throng, as soon as I come, fling away their
arms in fear, of me! Ask every lion hero of my
exploits; they will tell thee every lion is terrified
at my violence. My tribe abuse me that I am
black; but my deeds in battle are fairer than the
dawn. If I wish, I will seize whole countries
and subjugate them, and all the princes of the
earth are within my grasp.â

Thus they travelled on till they came to the pool
near which Shiboob left the wounded man, and they
perceived that he was dead; they were exceedingly
vexed. Verily, said Shedad, we have lost horsemen
more valuable than the plunder!

Now that plain was very extensive, and as evening
was advancing, they halted till midnight, and
then departed, seeking their own country, where
they arrived in the morning: and they met King
Zoheir at the lake of Zatool-irsad, and with him
[140]

were his sons, and Rebia son of Zeead. As soon as
they saw the King, they hastened to him, and saluting
him, laid the plunder before him, and told him
what Antar had done, how he had joined them, and
liberated them from misery and destruction, and had
slain Kais, and dispersed part of the tribe of Cahtan.
Confer this great obligation then, on thy son,
he so longs for, said Zoheir to Shedad, that you may
be rewarded by his great actions, and be ennobled
by his sword to after generations.

Rebia, Shas, and Malik, Iblaâs father, and his son
Amroo, were greatly enraged at this; but Prince
Malik, the friend of Antar, rejoiced.

He then divided the spoil in equal portions, but
out of respect for Antar would not take even a
halter. And Antar immediately presented the
whole of it to his father and his uncles; and all the
tribe of Abs were astonished at his noble conduct
and filial love. Zoheir sacrificed camels and sheep,
and ordered a feast to be prepared, and as they ate
and drank, King Zoheir turned towards Antar and
said, recite, Aboolfawaris, some of thy verses; and
he thus complied.

âMay fortune bring thee every wish of thy heart,
live in peace, for every result will secure thy
comfort! This is the lake whose residence thou
hast sweetened; and were it not for thee, its
rain fraught with exhalations would not fall upon
us. Thou art present, and all its herbs are
[141]

green or yellow, and all their wonders and charms
are expanded before us. The breeze of musk
wafts the essence of its flowers, and it smiles from
east to west. O then, let us do it ample justice
with wine; let us mix it till its banks oâerflow.
Let us drink with thee out of cups of joy, and
let us hold up thy train, thou lord of honor!
Thy countenance is decked in smiles, laughter
lives in thy teeth, and there is a sword whose
blows draw the blood of thy foes. O do not
then reproach me if I weep for Hima, when I
call to mind the friends that dwell there, and its
neighbours. In my heart is an ever burning
flame, but I am ever in alarm about these dear
warriors and these tents. Over the extent of the
waste are marvellously rich canopies, and the
whole is ornamented with fine curtains of Grecian
velvet, painted with every surprising form, that I
am amazed at their starry brilliancy. My heart
was in agony the day they quitted Hima, but it
soon returned to hail its royal master. Should it
be said amongst the peopleâWho is the most
determined hero? What youth is ennobled high
oâer the rest? We will say it is Zoheir, illustrious
in his birth, towering above all men, who can
never attain his eminence. His exploits avert
from us the obscurity of night, and all is
luminous, so that his star is one mass of onyx.
May he ever succeed in every enterprize; may
death ever march wherever his armies march.â

[142]

These verses delighted the King. May God
never renounce thy mouth, or man do thee harm,
said he. By the faith of an Arab, thou art one of
the wonders of the world; and he continued to
praise and thank him; when lo! a great dust arose,
and there appeared a hundred horsemen, all clothed
in steel, headed by a Knight like a lofty date
tree on an elephant, on his head was a turban of
Kufian cloth, and over him a painted mantle of
Grecian fabric; beneath him was an Arabian steed;
they came down towards the lake, and when they
reached it, the foremost rank stopped short, and
their leader dismounted, and presented himself
before King Zoheir, bowing before him. His tears
began to flow, and with a heart rent with anguish
he thus addressed him.

âO thou, the defender and protector, be my
defence and support against mine enemies. Thou
art the defender of orphans, and thy beneficence
heals the wounded spirit. Fortune has overwhelmed
me, my bosom bursts, and my soul is
full of grief. A perfidious minded oppressor has
overpowered us with his strength, and has
violated our virgins. Wherever he goes, death
precedes him, so he destroys his foes before he
presents himself. Protect us from his violence
before all our women are dragged prisoners by
their hair.â

[143]

CHAPTER IV

The suppliant had not finished his intreaties, ere
Prince Malik sprung towards him, and throwing his
arms round his neck, O my brother, said he, may
God never permit thy eyes to weep! What is it
that has called forth thy grief? Now this suppliant
was Prince Malikâs foster-brother, and his name was
Hassan the Mazinite. The King had taken the
mother of this youth a prisoner from the tribe of
Mazin; he was an infant at her breast, and as his
father was slain in the affair, King Zoheir carried
her away, and as Temadhur had just then brought
forth Prince Malik, she consigned her child to
her, desiring her to suckle the infant with her own
child. So she remained with her a long time, and
suckled and weaned her son and Prince Malik
together, till her sister, who had heard of her, came
to her and pressed her exceedingly to return home.
She asked permission of Temadhur, who granted
it, and gave her and her sister many very valuable
presents. She then departed with her sister for her
native land, and employed herself in educating her
son Hassan, until he grew up and his limbs
strengthened, for in him was the essence of the
[144]

noble tribe of Mazin. And he became a blazing
flame, and a fiery thunderbolt, and the tribe of
Mazin loved him for his courage, and they made
him the protector of their land.

And Hassanâs sudden arrival at King Zoheirâs
tent was occasioned by the following circumstance.
Hassan had a maternal uncle, whose name was
Nedjem the Mazinite, and he had a daughter perfectly
beautiful and lovely, and her form was symmetry
itself. Hassan was in love with her, but he was
never able to address her, till a man of the name of
Awef the son of Alkem, of the tribe of Terjem, presented
himself one day to his uncle. He was also a
renowned horseman, and a valiant hero, rich in
property and cattle. And when he came, his uncle
invited him to a feast, and slew camels and sheep,
and poured out wine for him; and when the liquor
began to play about the head of Awef, he threw
himself at his feet, and demanded his daughter, and
won him by his wealth and riches. Hassan was
present, and when he perceived that if he remained
silent, his cousin would be betrothed to another, he
started up and eagerly exclaimed: O my uncle, do
not marry thy daughter to this man, for I am to be
preferred to him on account of my rank and consideration:
never will I permit the daughter of my
uncle to quit her tent for a strangerâs, were my limbs to
be torn asunder! Ignoble wretch, cried Awef, canst
thou presume to address, where I have already put
[145]

in a claim? for thou art numbered amongst the
herd of orphans.
[3]

Wert thou not in mine uncleâs tent, replied
Hassan, I would soon tear off thy head, and silence
thy existence. And if thou wouldst boast of thy
wealth, know, that all the property of the Arabs is
mine, and in the grasp of my hand; and if thou
wouldst domineer over me with thy courage, come,
let us to the field! that I may make an example of
thee amongst the horsemen.

At these words the light became dark in the eyes
of Awef; he instantly sprang on his horseâs back, and
Hassan did the same; and they both rushed to the
plain; and dashed at each other, and the earth
quivered under the feet of their horses, and all the
tribe of Mazin sallied out in order to see what might
be the result of the battle and contention. Naeema,
the daughter of Nedjim, was there with many other
women. And when Hassan observed his cousin,
and that she was viewing the engagement, he
instantly seized his antagonist and grappled him,
and pressing him hard, stopped all means of escape;
then catching hold of the rings of his coat of mail,
he made him his prisoner, dashed him on the
ground, and almost smashed him to atoms. He
instantly dismounted to cut off his head; but his
[146]

uncle sprang towards him, saying, O my son let
him go, accept of my intercession, for he has eaten
of my meat and been under my protection. So
Hassan admitted his uncleâs interference, and pardoned
him. Awef quitted the tribe of Mazin, for
shame and mortification overwhelmed him; and the
event was spread among the Arab tribes, and every
one stood in awe of Hassan.

About that time a female slave came to Hassan.
Your uncle, said she, has been just saying to his
wife, Verily Hassan is a valiant and a brave fellow,
but he has not wherewithal to keep up an establishment,
and I fear, should I give him my daughter,
she will be reduced to penury and difficulties with
him. As soon as Hassan heard this, he assembled
all the men in whom he could confide, and took
them away, and he went in search of plunder from
some of the Arab hordes.

Now, among the Arab tribes of Cahtan, there
was a King whose name was Oosak, and he was one
of the thousand warriors of that period of ignorance,
who could engage a thousand heroes at once. He
had at his command an intrepid army; but a famine
having wasted his lands, he departed with his troops
and his armies, and attacked the land of the tribe of
Mazin, amongst whom he settled. And it happened
that as he rode out one day, and was amusing himself
by the streams and the fountains, he rode on till
he came to a pool of water, when it happened by
[147]

fate and destiny, from which there is for man no
retreat or escape, that in that day Naeema, the
daughter of Hassanâs uncle (who with her friends
was gone to procure a dower for her) came also to
the lake. Oosak, as he looked at her and the
young girls employed in their games and amusements,
distinguished Naeema, for her face was brilliant
like the moon when it is full; and as she was
smiling, with her teeth like rows of pearls, and as
the weight of her haunches prevented her from
standing up, Oosak was quite surprised, and his
senses failed him. But the women turning towards
him perceived Oosak looking at them, so they all
surrounded Naeema. O brother Arab, they exclaimed,
are you not ashamed of this action, thus to
come and stare at the daughters of warriors?

Oosak smiled and laughed at what they said,
and called out to an old woman who was with them,
and asked her about the damsel. Whose daughter
is she? Whether she was a virgin or a married
woman? This is Naeema, the daughter of Nedjim,
said she, and is unmarried. When Oosak heard
this, his love and passion increased. He staid quiet
that night, but as soon as the day dawned, he sent
to Nedjim to demand his daughter in marriage.
But Nedjim refused him, saying;âVerily, I have
but one daughter, and have affianced her to my nephew
Hassan, who is now on an expedition, seeking
a dower for her. I cannot therefore dispose of her,
[148]

for he is a horseman that would not put up with
such an affront, and also a man of a harsh disposition.
The messenger reported this to Oosak, who swore
in his wrath that he would not take her but as a
captive, and that he would pour down death and
destruction on the whole tribe of Mazin.

About that time arrived Hassan, bringing with
him immense wealth; and as soon as he approached
the dwelling, he gave his uncle the marriage present
for his daughter. He also made a partition
amongst the warriors of the tribe, and put aside five
hundred camels for the marriage feast, and besought
his uncle to have the ceremony performed.
His uncle then informed him what Oosak had done,
how he had demanded his daughter, and how
he had refused him. On hearing this the light
became dark in the eyes of Hassan. If Oosak dares
to molest me, said he, I will tear out his lips
and crush him to pieces, and I will drive him out of
our land, even against his will. I will repair to
King Zoheir, and will relate the affair to him, and
then will I come upon him with the warriors of
the tribes of Abs and Adnan, who heed not even
Chosroe Nushirvan.

Thus Hassan calmed the mind of his uncle, and
they made ready the marriage ceremony, and sacrificed
the camels and the sheep, and poured out the
wine; and seven days they continued in mirth and
jollity; but on the eighth day, as they were adorning
[149]

the bride with jewels and robes, and were about to
wed her to Hassan, intelligence reached them that
Oosak had resolved to make all the women his
slaves, plunder their property, and slay the men.

On hearing this, Hassan stood in front of his
party, as they were consulting what was to be done.
Hassan, said they, we are not able to contend
with Oosak, for he has assembled all the tribe
of Cahtan, and there comes with him the tribe of
Zerker, and the tribe of Anka; and he has sent to
Masood, the son of Moosad the Kelbian, and with
him also is Awef, whom you made prisoner, and
whose hair you cut off; and we have not that confidence
in ourselves to suppose that our means can
resist such accumulated forces. Upon this Hassan
went to his uncle. Uncle, said he, have patience
with me for ten days, and I will shew you what I
will do with those haughty boasters.

So he took with him an hundred horsemen, and
went his way till he reached the lake of Zatool Irsad,
and on seeing King Zoheir, he told him what we
have now related as the cause of his coming. Antar
was present and heard all that had happened to
Hassan, and being much interested about him, he
instantly arose and kissing the Kingâs handâO my
lord, he cried, let me be deputed by you for
this service; let me go with Hassan, and I will destroy
his enemy. Go, my son, cried Zoheir to
Malik,âgo to the assistance of your brother, and
[150]

take with you whomever you please of our warriors,
and Antar among the rest, and return not till you
have blotted out every vestige of Oosak.

The King then ordered the dinner to be prepared
for Hassan and his companions, whilst Malik was
employed in getting ready for the expedition,
and chose from the tribe a thousand experienced
warriors; and in three days Hassan and his associates
all mounted their horses with Prince Malik,
and Antar the impetuous horseman, and Shiboob as
his attendant; and Hassan was the happiest of men
in the assistance of the tribe of Abs. Thus they
marched on, clad in steel, and their bright cuirasses
sparkled on their bodies. And as they rode, said
Malik to AntarâO Aboolfawaris, recite to us some
of thy verses. Willingly, my Lord, he replied; and
thus spoke:â

âI lust after the blows of the cleaving scimitars,
and I idolize the thrusts of the well made spears.
I long for the cups of death, when they are pure,
and they circle round the heads of the illustrious
brave. It is the blow and the thrust when the
horses stumble among the death-bearing lances,
and the armies are in confusion, that please me
under the shades of the dust, like the wings of
darkness, as the coursers storm over the earth,
the barbs of the lances plunge into obscurity, and
start from it like the sparkling stars. Faulchions,
gleam in it in every direction, like the flashes of
[151]

lightning in the darkness of night. O by thy life,
honour and glory, and eminence, and the accomplishment
of hopes, and exaltation of fame are for
him who rushes into the combat magnanimously,
where alone in the height of glory are the highest
honours. Let him thrust among the warriors and
the chiefs with a heart unmoved in the fall of sword
blows. Let him brandish furiously his sabre and
spear in the boldness of his spirit, undaunted
at calamities. Let him do justice to the lance of
Cahtan in the contest, and let him stretch forth
proudly his shoulders with the edge of the scimitar.
Otherwise, let him lead a contemptible
life in ignominy, and when he dies, his friends
will not mourn over him. The beauteous virgins
will not weep in anguish for any but the
horsemen noble in the hour of trial. I am the
hero well known in the field of battle, and I am
the eager knight amongst my relations. I am
the assaulting lion, and the hero who defends their
dwellings and habitations.â

O Aboolfawaris, said Hassan, verily you surpass
all the horsemen of the age in eloquence and courage,
and generosity and nobleness of mind. You
are in truth the jewel of the times. Antar thanked
him, and they travelled on for three days, and on
the fourth day (for the Lord of Heaven had decreed
the glory of Antar, and that no one should exceed
him in prosperity) Antar happening to stray a
[152]

little out of the way, descended into a deep
valley: and lo! there were two horsemen engaged
in desperate combat. Antar urged on his steed,
and coming up to them, Stop, ye Arabs, he cried,
and tell me the cause of your quarrel. At the instant
one of them stepped aside, and came up to
Antar. Noble horseman of the desert and the town,
said he, I refer myself to you, for you are able to
protect me. I will take your part, said Antar, I
will protect you, I pledge myself to you but acquaint
me with your story, and what has rendered
necessary this combat between you.

Know then, noblest knight of the age, said the
youth, that I and this horseman are brothers, of the
same father and the same mother; he is the eldest,
and I am the youngest; and our father was one of
the Arab chieftains, and he was called Amroo, the
son of Harith, the son of Teba, and Teba was our
ancestor; and one day as he was sitting down, his
flocks strayed away, and one of his camels was lost,
and as he was very partial to it, he questioned some
of the herdsmen about it. One of them said,
Know, my Lord, yesterday this camel strayed away
from the pasture; I followed behind it, and it still
continued to run away, and I after it, till I became
tired, and perceiving that it lagged behind, I
stretched out my hand and took up a stone, black
in appearance, like a hard rock, brilliant and sparkling.
I struck the camel with it, and it hit the
[153]

camel on the right side and issued out on the left,
and the camel fell to the ground dead. On coming
up to it I found the stone by its side, and the camel
was weltering in its blood.

On hearing this, my ancestor mounted his horse,
and taking the peasant with him, went to find out
the pasture. They passed on till they came to the
camel, which they found dead, and the stone lying
near it. My ancestor took it in his hand, and considered
it very attentively, and he knew it was a
thunderbolt; so he carried it away and returned
home. He gave it to a blacksmith, and ordered
him to make a sword of it. He obeyed, and took
it and went his way; and in three days he returned
to my ancestor with a sword two cubits long
and two spans wide. My ancestor received it, and
was greatly pleased when he saw it, and turned towards
the blacksmith and said, What name have you
given it? So the blacksmith repeated this distich:
âThe sword is sharp, O son of the tribe of Ghalib,
sharp indeed, but where is the striker for the
sword?â And my ancestor waved the sword with
his hand, and said, As to the smiter, I am the smiter;
and struck off the head of the blacksmith, and
separated it from his body. He then cased it with
gold, and called it Dhami, on account of its sharpness.
He laid it by amongst his treasures, and when he died
it came in succession to my father, with the rest of
the arms, and when my father perceived his death
[154]

was at hand, he called me to him privately. O my
son, said he, I know your brother is of a tyrannical
obstinate disposition, one that likes violence and
hates justice, and I am aware that at my death he
will usurp my property. What measures shall I
take? said I. He answered, take this sword and
conceal it, and let no one know any thing about it;
and when you see that he takes forcible possession
of all my property, cattle and wealth, do you be
content, my son, with this sword, for it will be of
great benefit to you, for if you present it to Nushirvan,
King of Persia, he will exalt you with his
liberality and favours, and if you present it to the
Emperor of Europe, he will enrich you with gold
and silver.

When I heard these words, I consented to what he
demanded, and took it out, in the darkness of the
night, and having buried it in this place, I returned
to my father and stayed with him till he died. We
buried him, and returned home; but my brother
took possession of all my father had, and gave me
nothing, not a ropeâs end; and when he searched for
the arms, and saw not the Dhami, he asked me for it.
I denied knowing any thing about it; he gave me
the lie, and abused me most violently; at last I
confessed, and told him I had buried it in such
a spot; so he came with me hither, and searched for
it, but could not find it. Again he asked me where
I had buried it; and when he saw me roaming about
[155]

from place to place, he rushed upon me, and cried
out, sayingâVile wretch! you know where the
sword is, and act thus to deceive me. He attacked
me, and sought to slay me, I defended myself until
you arrived, and now I demand your protection.

When Antar heard this, his heart pitied him;
he left the youth, and turning to his brother,
said, Why do you tyrannize over your brother?
and do not divide with him the property your
father left? Base slave, cried he, highly incensed,
look to yourself, and interfere not so arrogantly;
and he turned upon Antar, thinking him a common
man; but Antar gave him no time to wheel, or
direct his reins, ere he pierced him through the chest
with his spear, and thrust it ten spans through his
back, and threw him down dead. And now, young
man, said he, to the other, return to your family,
and assume the rank of your father, and should any
one molest you, send and inform me; I will come
and tear his life out of his sides. The youth thanked
him and expressed his gratitude. Now my brother
is no more, said he, I have no other enemy: and he
departed home. But Antar fixed his spear in the
ground, and dismounted from Abjer, and sat down
to rest himself; and as he was moving the sand
with his fingers, he touched a stone; on removing
what was about it, behold! the sword the youth
had been seeking. He still cleared away, and drew
it forth, and seized hold of it, and it was a sword
[156]

two cubits in length, and two spans wide, of the
metal of Amalec, like a thunderbolt. And Antar
was convinced of his good fortune, and that everything
began and ended in the most high God.

Antar mounted and pursued his comrades and
Prince Malik, bearing the sword in his hand. He
shewed it to Malik, and told him all about the youth
and his brother, and the sword; of his having buried
it, and all that passed between them; and Malik
was greatly astonished, saying, This is a gift sent
you by the Lord of Heaven.

They marched forward, passing over the wilds
and the deserts that day and night; and the next
day at dawn, behold there was great dust, and when
dispersed, five hundred horsemen appeared all
clothed in steel. Go and learn for us, said
Antar to Shiboob, what means this dust, and what
news there is beneath it. Shiboob quitted them,
and returned as quick as a bird on the wing, O son
of my mother, cried he, these are your enemies,
the army of Gheidac. But the circumstance that
occasioned the approach of this horseman was this:
it happened that Oosak had demanded assistance
of Gheidac, in his meditated attack on the tribe of
Mazin.

Now there was blood revenge between Gheidac
and Antar, because Antar had killed his father,
and he had been brought up an orphan, but when
he grew up he became a valiant horseman, and
[157]

destroyed his opponents; and he was a blazing
thunderbolt, and overthrew knights and slew warriors.
And when his name was spread abroad
among the tribes, they gave him supreme command,
and he sat in the place of his father. He became
proud, and behaved haughtily to his people.

Now there was a man in the tribe called CodhÃ ah,
and he hated Gheidac. O Gheidac, said he one
day, thou art a marked man; it does not become
thee to behave so haughtily towards the horsemen,
when thou hast not yet revenged the murder
of thy father: how canst thou presume to
boast over the brave and the valiant? And Gheidac
said, Who is the stout king on whom I am to be
avenged? Thy revenge is on Antar, son of Shedad,
said he. Then the light became darkness in his
eyes, and he cried out to the horsemen of his tribe,
and he ordered them to prepare for an expedition
to attack the tribe of Abs, and he swore he would
slay Antar, and make him drink the cup of perdition,
and destroy the whole tribe of Abs and Adnan.
The tribe assented to his directions, and took with
them all their warlike instruments for the expedition.

Just at that time arrived Oosakâs messenger to
request Gheidacâs assistance against the tribe of
Mazin. So Gheidac gave up his former intention,
and went with the messenger of Oosak to perform
what he required of him, and he was marching on
this object when he met Antar and the Absians, and
[158]

Antar dispatched Shiboob, as we before stated.
This day, said Antar, I will unite Gheidac to his
father; I will curse his family and his relations. As
soon as Gheidac saw the tribe of Abs, and Antar the
destroyer of horsemen, his heart was overjoyed,
and he cried out to his partyâThis is a glorious
morning; to day will I take my revenge, and wipe
out my disgrace. So he assailed the tribe of Abs
and Adnan, and his people attacked in his rear like
a cloud when it pours forth water and rains. And
the Knight of Abs, Antar, assaulted them likewise,
anxious to try his sword, the famous Dhami. They
all rushed forward, and horsemen encountered
horsemen. Cowards fled, and the weak-hearted
were disgraced; but the bold were firm in the
assault, and the equals in courage met each other in
the field. The earth trembled under trampling of the
horses,âthe heavens were obscured with the clouds
of dust,âthe warriors were covered with wounds,
and the swords laboured in the cause of death;
exertion was alive, and all jest was at an end. Thus
they continued fighting till mid-day; and the impetuosity
of Antar was the impetuosity of a resolute
hero. When Gheidac observed the deeds of Antar,
the bold warrior, he roared like a lion in his den,
and he rushed down upon the lion Antar, who met
him, his heart undaunted in the midst of terrors, and
occupied him in the contest, and continually drew
him on, as a lion draws on weaker cubs, until having
[159]

wearied him, he shouted at him and struck him with
horror; then assailed him so that stirrup grated
stirrup; and he struck him on the head with
Dhami. He cleft his vizor and wadding, and his
sword played away between the eyes, passing
through his shoulders down to the back of the
horse, even to the ground: and he and his horse
made four pieces; and to the strictest observer,
it would appear that he had divided them with
scales.

Gheidacâs companions beheld their chief, and that
he was dead; and they said one to anotherâNever
did we see such a blow; were not this slave endued
with the whole power of courage, he could not at
one blow have thus destroyed our chief. So they
took to flight and ran away, exclaimingâMay God
curse thy harlot mother! how fierce is thy blow!
how piercing is thy thrust!

Antar and the horsemen soon returned from the
pursuit, having filled the earth with the dead, and
having collected the scattered horses, and all the
booty and plunder from the plains and deserts; as
they prosecuted their journey towards the tribe of
Mazin, Antar preceded the troops of warriors like
a noble lion, and thus addressed them.

âI am he that makes the warriors drink of the
cups of death with the sharp-bladed glittering
Indian scimitar. I am the raiser of their dust,
and the atmosphere is thick and darkly turbid with
[160]

blows at which cowards are humbled and terrified.
I am the death that never rushes into
the fiery day of battle without a tongue to speak.
I have slain Gheidac, because he was oppressive
and insulted me, and soon will I send Oosak after
him. I charge right and left through their horsemen,
and dash through the midst of them. I cut
down to the ground the warriors in the fight,
whilst the horses stumble and slip over their
heads. O Ibla, though they abuse me for my
blackness, yet the fairness of my exploits shines
and flashes. O Ibla, the men of my tribe have
witnessed my spear-thrust and sword-blow raging
among the sculls. I destroy the heroes
of war with my scimitar, and whole armies are
extirpated at the edge of my sword. How many
horsemen throw away their arms in terror of me,
when they behold me robed in black gore. My
ambition is raised above the Pleiades, and the
fortune of my star is suspended from heaven.â

They marched forward without delay, until they
reached the tribe of Mazin, where they perceived
the glittering of spears, the glare of armour, the
flash of swords, and warriors engaged round the
tents whilst the women were earnestly encouraging
them to the contest and battle. Who is it that
fights with children and women? and who is it that
shrinks from his enemy and foes? cried the heroes.
When Antar saw and heard the cries of the women,
[161]

and the screams of the children from the crowd (for
he was particularly solicitous in the cause of women),
the light was darkened in his eyes, and he knew
not the right from the left. Do you take your
warriors towards the quarter of the women, cried he
to Malik, and I will attack these horsemen who have
taken their property, and have dispersed them in
the plains and wilds. And he shouted forth in his
well known voice when incensedâIgnoble dastards,
he roared, I am Antar, the son of Shedad! He
attacked, and at his assault the mountains tottered.
He rushed down upon the enemy, and at once
overpowered the warriors and destroyed the heroes,
driving away the enemy out of their tents; and at
his second attack all the scene of action was expanded;
he shouted in front of the horses and forced
them back upon their haunches; and when the
horsemen crowded about him, he snatched hold of
one from the back of his horse, and grasping him
by his feet, and whirling him round as a sling, with
him he struck down a second, and the two instantly
fell dead. Thus the battle was raging among them,
when Antar heard the voice of Prince Malik, crying
out, O son of Shedad, haste to my assistance.

Now the Prince was engaged with the party of
Moosad, the lord of the waters of Traeer; he had
dispersed them, and was about to repeat his attack,
when Moosad came upon him roaring like a lion.
He was an experienced horseman: he attacked Prince
[162]

Malik, and pressed him hard; and when Malik
saw that his life was in danger he cried for Antarâs
aid; who no sooner heard him than he turned
Abjer round, and like a ferocious lion rushed down
upon Moosad, who was about to gallop around and
charge at him; but Antar gave him no time. Come
on! he cried: and he terrified him, and struck him
with Dhami on the chest, and he divided him down
to the girdle of his back, and hurled him down,
hewn in two. He then assailed the army of Oosak,
his heart undaunted at death.

And when the tribe of Mazin saw Antarâs
prowess, the hearts of the heroes were encouraged,
and they hastened to the combat; men met men,
and heroes heroes; blood flowed and streamed,
scimitars glittered, and spears goaded; armour was
riven; lives were plundered; the ground was
discoloured with blood; the warriors were covered
with glory; the flames of war greatly raged;
innumerable were the blows and the thrusts, and
the easy became difficult: the battle field boiled like
the boiling of cauldrons; mighty was every act,
and fate descended amongst them. The eagles
and vultures hovered round; cowards were overthrown,
and the brave were overwhelmed: heroes
were slain on both sides. The horror of the scene
was tremendous, the universal cry among them,
was Death! Hands and arms were torn asunder.
Antar cut through the troops, and made heads fly
[163]

off like balls, and hands like leaves of trees. The
van cried out to the rear; they roared against Antar
from afar; but not one dared to approach the spot
where he fought.

Antar eagerly sought after the plume that floated
above the head of Oosak, and he stopped not in his
attack until he was beneath the standard where Oosak
was waiting for his people to bring him his beloved
Naeema: neither could he be roused till Antar came
before him and encountered him. Then ensued a
dreadful engagement. The combat lasted an hour;
when nerveless sunk the arm of Oosak. Antar
seeing the state he was in, clung to him and grappled
him; and drawing his sword from his scabbard,
he aimed a blow at his head, but Oosak
received it on his shield. The sword of Antar came
down upon it and shivered it in two, and split his
vizor in twain, and it penetrated even to his thighs,
down to the back of the horse; and the rider and
the horse fell in four parts; and he cried outâO
by Abs! I am the lover of Ibla; never will I be
controuled! I will not be restrained!

When the troops of Oosak saw this deed, they
were bewildered; they became confounded; and
they said to one another, this is no human being,âevery
one that comes before him drinks of the
cup of death. So they wheeled about their horses
and retreated into the rocky deserts, whilst Antar
and the tribe of Abs and Mazin pursued them, and
[164]

having driven them away out of that land, they returned
to the scattered cattle and dispersed horses;
and as they all came back to the tents, the tribe of
Mazin dismounted, and met Antar, and marched
by the side of his stirrup, celebrating his victory
and triumph till they reached their camp, where the
women and the men came out, and the tribe of Abs
were accommodated with the best spots. Hassan
was the happiest of them all with Antar and the
Absians. He prepared feasts and festivals and entertainments,
which lasted for seven days; and on
the eighth night Naeema was married to Hassan.

Early the next morning all the Arabs went to
their respective countries and homes, and the tribe
of Abs also departed; but all the tribe of Mazin, in
order to take leave of them, accompanied them a
whole dayâs journey, when Antar besought them to
return home, and he and Malik pursued their
journey towards their own country, over wilds and
plains. And when they were nigh, Prince Malik
sent on a messenger to announce their approach.
All the tribe of Abs were extremely anxious about
that expedition, particularly King Zoheir, with
respect to Antar; because his enemies, and those
that envied him, exceeded his friends and well-wishers.

Now Rebia the son of Zeead had a brother
whose name was Amarah: he was one of the nobles,
but a great coxcomb, was very particular in his
[165]

dress, fond of perfumes, and always keeping
company with the women and young girls. About
that period, happening to hear much said about
Ibla, and what Antar had reported of her, and
repeated of her in his verses, a passion was kindled
in his heart, and from hearsay, he conceived
a violent love for her; and as Poets term it, his
ears fell in love before his eyes. Amarah sent for
one of his female slaves, and said to her, Go to the
habitations of the tribe of Carad, and obtain some
account of Ibla for me, and, learn if what Antar
says of her be true, or disbelieved amongst the people,
for if she has all the beauty and charms that
are attributed to her, I shall demand her in marriage,
and will be lawfully wedded to her. She
promised to obey him, and departed. She came to
the habitations of the tribe of Carad, and presented
herself to Ibla, pretending to come on a visit; so
Ibla gave her a kind reception. Thus the slave girl
ascertained the point about Ibla, and found her a
perfect miracle of beauty and loveliness. She remained
about an hour, and returned to Amarah.
Blessed be God, how great is his power, and how
fair are his works, cried she, as she entered the
tents, and in Amarahâs hearing; and he asked her
what had occasioned her so much astonishment. O,
said she, it is that damsel, whose equal exists not; for
the most high God has granted to her such beauty,
[166]

and such charms, as he has never yet bestowed on
any one of the daughters of the greatest Kings.

At this his heart fluttered, he was agitated, he
instantly leaped up, and put on his best clothes, and
perfumed himself all over, and let his hair float
down his shoulders, and mounted a white-faced
horse, and set out for the habitations of the tribe of
Carad. He happened to meet Malik, Iblaâs father,
and his son Amroo, on the road. Amarah saluted
them, and said to MalikâCome along with me,
my uncle, for I have something particular to communicate.
If you have any business with me,
replied Malik, you might have sent a servant to me,
and I would have waited on you. What I want of
you, said Amarah, must be done personally between
us. I wish to be nearly related to you, and am
most anxious to be connected with you. I am
a suitor with you, and am desirous of wedding
your daughter; and I have only done this out of
my anxiety for her on account of her shepherd,
who has disgraced her among the Arabs of the
desert.

Thus Amarah continued his talk, till Malikâs
eyes wept tears of joy: his bosom was elated and
transported with delight. O chief, said he, my
daughter is your slave, and I and my son Amroo are
the most obedient of you servantsâand he stretched
out his hand to Amarah, and promised his daughter
[167]

to him; and when they all returned home,
Amarah informed his brother Rebia of all that had
passed between him and Malik, son of Carad, I
shall not permit thee thus to connect thyself, said
Rebia; have nothing to do with such fellows; for
if Antar hears it, he will not leave a single man
alive of all the tribe of Zeead. And pray whoâs
Antar? asked Amarahâhave I not a thousand
slaves like him? and if the foul wretch presume to
interfere with me, I will shew him the valour of
Amarah the munificent; Iâll shew him what Iâll do
with him. If you can effect the marriage to-morrow
morning early, said Rebia, give her father the
dower and marriage presents without delay, and introduce
yourself to her in the absence of Antar; for
he is an uncontroulable horseman, and a man rough
and harsh in his manners; but if you can gain her
whilst heâs away, there will be an end of it. Amarah
assented to the proposal of Rebia, and thought
his advice prudent; for he feared Antar would kill
him and make him drink of the cup of death and
dissolution.

So the next day Amarah mounted his horse and
went to Malik to give him the dower and marriage
presents; and just at that moment arrived a messenger
at the tents of the tribe of Abs, announcing
the approach of Prince Malik son of Zoheir, and
Antar son of Shedad, and all the noble warriors in
their suite. Every one mounted his steed to go
[168]

and meet them. And friends saluted friends.
Antar went home, and entered his auntâs apartments,
and staid till morning with his mother,
whom he questioned about Ibla, enquiring whether
she had mentioned him during his absence?
God be with thee, my son, said his mother; talk
no more about Ibla, and that lovely formâif thou
art asleep, awake! Antar upon this instantly
jumped upâWhat king or prince, exclaimed he,
has taken her away! The chief Amarah, said his
mother, has taken her. Every thing is completed
but the giving of the dower and marriage presents.
By the faith of a noble and faithful Arab,
cried Antar, to morrow will I slay that Amarah,
were he even concealed within the chambers of
Nushirvan, king of Persia; to-morrow will I tell
the whole affair to my friend Prince Malik, and ask
his counsel.

He remained at home that night, but early in
the morning, he repaired to the habitations of the
Prince; he entered his tent, and kissed his hand.
Malik received him kindly, seated him by his
side, sayingâhow hast thou passed the night,
Aboolfawaris? My night was the night of
thy most accursed foe, replied Antar. What
means this? said Malik, inform me whatâs the
matter, and be sure of success and triumph. Antar
told him what Malik had done, and how he had
betrothed his daughter to Amarah; but my lord,
[169]

I must indeed slay that Amarah, and the whole
race of Zeead, and I will depart from this land and
country. But why quit this land? said Malik,
greatly disturbed; I am a foe to those who are thy
foes, and a friend of those who are thy friends;
have patience until we go out to the chase, and then
will I speak to thy father Shedad, and will urge him
to acknowledge thee as his son, and that thou art a
part of his heart. Then take Ibla from her father;
and if he does not assent, I will put my name on
her; and will keep off any suitor or wooer till the
ceremony is performed, and thou art in possession
of thy wife.

At this, Antarâs grief and anguish were appeased.
So they mounted their horses and sought the habitation
of King Zoheir, whence they all went out
on a hunting party. And Amarah rode by the
side of Iblaâs father: he was dressed out in his
finest raiments, and his limbs were perfumed and
scented, and his hair flowed down his shoulders.
Go, Aboolfawaris, to my tent, said Malik to Antar,
that I may speak with thy father Shedad. Antar
departed, and Prince Malik riding up to Shedad,
saidâHow long will you reject your son Antar?
does not your heart lean towards him? and do you
not yearn after him? all the horde envies you on
his account. Grant me this request, Shedad, and
let me make a noble entertainment, and let me raise
his head above a state of servitude, and you will see
[170]

what he will do in return for such a favour. Who,
answered Shedad, whilst his wrath was evident in
his features, who is the Arab that ever did such a
deed before me? Do you wish that it should be
said of me that Shedad was captivated with a
Negro woman, even to desire to marry her, and she
bore him a son, and he acknowledged him as such
because he became a great warrior, and a destroying
hero. And who is he, said Malik, that having a son
that resembles your son Antar would deny him, even
were swords to cut his body in pieces?âAccording
to my opinion, you should glory in him. Let
the Arabs follow your example.âGood practices are
to be admired, even though they be new. My lord,
weâll consult about this, said Shedad; and he went
his way home; Prince Malik also returning unsuccessful,
found Antar in the greatest anxietyâhe
required what had passed with his fatherâMalik
told him.

Antar remained that night with Prince Malik,
but early next morning he mounted his horse and
went towards his motherâs tent, and as he was passing
along the road, he met Amarah in the quarter
of the tribe of Carad. He had been that night
consulting with Malik, Iblaâs father, about the
marriage, and in the morning he was returning home
followed by his attendants. He was riding in a
most affected, coxcomical manner; and as soon as
he saw Antar he trembled, and was in great dismay;
[171]

however, he plucked up courage, and let his tongue
run glibly on. Son of Shedad, said he, where wert
thou last night? thy masters were seeking thee; for
I was there with them, and having heard of thy
talent for eloquence, it was my intention to give
thee a robe suitable to such as thou art.

On hearing this, the light became dark in Antarâs
eyes; he came up to himâAmarah, he exclaimed,
I am not worthy of receiving a robe or present from
thee; but when thou enterest unto my mistress
Ibla, the daughter of Malik, verily, vile wretch, I
will wrench thy neck off thy shoulders; I will curse
thy family and thy parents, and I will make thine
the most fatal of marriages; and Antar ran close
up to Amarah, and seized him by the waist,
heaved him up in his hand till he had raised
him above his head, and then dashed him on the
ground, and almost smashed his bones. Amarah
fainted with fright, and gave unfeigned signs of
cowardice and alarm.

Immediately there arose an uproar among the
tribes of Abs and Zeead, and soon appeared Prince
Malik at full speed; for as soon as he heard the
news, he was afraid some mischief would befall his
friend. He came up with his drawn sword and
joined Antar, who stood firm, with his trusty Dhami
in his hand. By the faith of an Arab of Medder,
said Malik, verily Antar in the tribe of Carad, is
[172]

like a rare onyx amongst people who know not its
value or worth. Come on, Aboolfawaris, he continued,
now for the family of Zeead! and he plied
his sword among them. Were the tribe of Zeead
in any other place, cried Antar, hastening towards
him, and kissing his hand, I would shew thee what
I would do with them in battle and war; but I am
afraid of blame and reproaches; and least the noble
Arabs should say, that a slave of the tribe of Carad
put his cousins to the sword. Malik was amazed at
Antar, and his magnanimity; and just then Rebia
came up at full speed with the intention of killing
Antar the lion-hearted hero, for he too had heard of
the event: so he mounted his horse, and came
greatly alarmed lest his brother should be killed
and buried; for he had previously told his brother
that he did not wish him to interfere with Ibla, or
expose himself and family to danger with the slave
Antar. He rushed upon Antar, eager to destroy
him. Stop, Rebia, cried Malik, or by the faith of
an Arab I will not spare one of your people or
warriors. Matters were in this state, when lo! King
Zoheir arrived, with all his heroes of the tribe of
Abs and Adnan. The attendants cried out, hold!
stop! fight not! ye have put in motion King Zoheir,
the ruler of the age.

Now on that day King Zoheir had received intelligence
that the tribe of Tey were coming down
[173]

upon him on account of Aminah, the daughter of
the Blood-drinker, and with them were twelve thousand
horsemen. King Zoheir was therefore troubled
in his heart, and he kept it secret, for he
feared that death and ruin were coming upon the
tribe of Abs. At that moment also reached him
the account of Amarah and Antar; and he was
greatly alarmed that dissentions should arise amongst
the tribes: so he mounted his horse and came
to them. As soon as King Zoheir arrived, they
held back from the fray, and they presented themselves,
both Amarah and his brother, whilst all the
people cried out unanimouslyâO great King, there
is no security for us in your country unless you permit
us to slay this diabolical black slave, Antar; for
he rebels and revolts, and no one but you can restrain
him. O my cousins, said Zoheir, tell me what
is the matter, what has Antar done?

Rebia came forward and told him that Amarah
had demanded in marriage Ibla, the daughter of
Malik, and what Antar had done to him. So the
King knew that Antar had been ill-used, and that
what they had told him about the marriage of Ibla
was only to deceive him: but observing how many
complained of Antar, he said, tell me what is your
intention, or what shall I do to him. O King, said
they, either kill him, or banish him from our country,
or send him back to tend the sheep and the
camels. As to killing him, replied the King, I cannot
[174]

submit to you, because he has eaten of our meat,
and our protection is on him; and as to banishing
him or sending him back to tend the camels and
the sheep, that does not depend upon meâit is
Shedadâs affair.

So the King sent for Shedad; and when he
cameâthese people are much exasperated against
your son, said Zoheir, but you have the entire disposal
of him, therefore do with him what you please,
and I will be witness for you. I am quite bewildered
and distressed about this business, replied
Shedad, but my opinion is that he should return to
the care of the sheep and the camels, and repent of
his conduct. Call Antar here, cried Zoheir, and
make the compact with him in my presence. Shedad
called for Antar, and he came. Thou wicked slave,
said his master, it is my determination that thou return
to the care of the sheep and the camels, for I
will not irritate the whole tribe, and submit to thee.
I will not molest my brother Malik, and obey
thee.

When Antar heard his fatherâs orders, the tears
rushed from his eyes, and he regretted greatly what
had passed. Do, said Antar, what you please, for
I am one of your servants, and a slave has only to
obey his master, though he torment and afflict him
every day of his life: and from this day will I never
mount a horse, and will never be present in battle
nor go anywhere but by your permission. And
[175]

King Zoheir and others witnessed for Antar, and
for his promise; and this flame that had blazed was
extinguished; and they all returned to their tents;
and his enemies, and those that envied him, exulted
over Antar, particularly the family of Zeead.

And Now, my cousins, cried Zoheir, prepare your
warlike instruments this instant, to fight the tribe
of Tey, for they are coming down upon us with
twelve thousand horsemen, on account of Aminah,
the daughter of the Blood-drinker, in order to release
her from slavery and indignity. They all
assented, and separated to prepare immediately.
But Antar was rejoiced and glad at hearing this
intelligence, for he knew the tribe of Abs would
be beaten and routed, and that they would be in
want of him. So he went home and entered his
motherâs apartment, and asked about Ibla. Ibla
was with me just now, said she; and she said,
soothe the heart of my cousin Antar, and tell him
from me that if my father even makes my grave my
resting place, none but him do I desire, none but
him will I choose.

Antarâs heart rejoiced and gladdened when he
heard what Ibla had said of him. He staid at home
that night, and the next day he took his brothers
Jereer and Shiboob, and went to the pasture, driving
the cattle and the camels before him.

And King Zoheir mounted his horse with all
his warriors of the tribe of Abs, in number four
[176]

thousand, all armed and accoutered, and set out
to meet the tribe of Tey, leaving in the tents
for the protection of the property, three hundred
horsemen, with the sons of Shas and Cais, and
Rebia the son of Zeead. He traversed the deserts:
and the tribe of Abs remained in safety one
night; the next day Antar conducted the cattle and
camels to the pasture, and Shiboob and Jereer went
out also with the cattle and the sheep, seeking the
pastures. No sooner had they quitted the tents,
but a dust arose that darkened the whole country.
It was a party of the tribe of Tey, who had passed
King Zoheir on the road, and reached the land of
Sharebah like a blazing flame.

What is your counsel now? O Ebereah, said Antar
to Shiboob. If you listen to my advice, said his brother,
to-day you will obtain all you wish and desire,
and you will become the noblest of the tribe of Abs,
and be admitted to the rank and consideration of
an Arab, and be reckoned one of the horsemen of
Arabia. My opinion is, you should take the camels
and the cattle, and ascend this eminence towards
Mount Saadi; I will bring you your horse and your
armour: for I know that the tribe of Abs will be
routed, and will stand in need of you; and they will
come to you, and will intreat you: but do not mount
your horse, do not take part in the contest till your
father admits you to his own rank, and acknowledges
you as a son, and as a part of his heart, and
[181]

your uncle gives you his daughter in marriage, and
makes you a partner in his wealthâthen descend
and destroy your enemies and those that envy you;
and thus, my brother, you will attain the object of
your wishes.

Antar heard this advice of Shiboob; and he drove
away the cattle and the camels, and ascended the hill
of Mount Saadi; whilst Shiboob went and brought
him his horse and his armour, and they all three
sat down to watch the result of the contest between
the tribes of Abs and Tey: but the Teyans attacked
the pastures of the Absians, and carried off
their camels and their cattle, with their shepherds;
and the whole country and vicinity were filled with
them. Many of the herdsmen returned in flight,
and spread alarm among the tents, informing
the Absians of the arrival of the Teyans, and of
their attack upon them, and that their army was
like the tempestuous sea. They were amazed, and
confounded; for they knew that King Zoheir must
have missed them on the road.

Shas called out to the warriors, and assembled
the men. Come on, my cousins, cried he, behold the
enemy, let us fight for our women and our tents, and let
us infuse fear and terror into their hearts, or they will
cut in among ye, and nothing will secure us against
the cup of death, but the blows with the sword.
They all mounted, the men were encouraged, and
rushed on to the combat; man opposed man, and
[182]

hero encountered heroes; blood flowed and streamed,
limbs were hewn off, and horrors were spread among
them for an hour; when at length the noble Absians
were so hard pressed, that the Teyans overwhelmed
them, for there were twelve thousand of these, and
the Absians only three hundred. Shas and Rebia
and Amarah were wounded, and nearly dead. The
Absians abandoned their property and families, and
sought the wilds and the deserts, and the enemy
took possession of their country and lands.

Alas! said Iblaâs father to Shedad, O my brother,
where is thy son? Let him come to us in such a
dreadful day as this, and liberate us from death and
misery. We cannot raise our heads towards Antar,
said Shedad; but were he present, our condition
would indeed be the reverse of this. Shedad raised
his eyes towards the hill, and he saw Shiboob and
Jereer and Antar seated on the ground and contemplating
the tribe of Abs, and their defeat. So he ran
towards them, and his brother Malik followed himâCanst
thou, in an hour like this, said Shedad, employ
thyself in tending the cattle and the camels?
Behold! the enemy have succeeded in their attempts,
and have plundered our property and slain our horsemen,
and have threatened to capture our women
and our families.

What dost wish me to do? said Antar; I am indeed
grieved at thy distress. O that I could rescue
thee from destruction and defeat; but I am a slave,
[183]

and am not capable of doing any thing, and am not
worthy your consideration; I am indeed a poor slave,
and one who conducts cattle and camels to the pastures,
and one employed in milking, and picking up
wood, and tending cattle and sheepâam I not
for this contemptible and despised? And he quitted
his father and his uncle Malik where they stood,
and went away from them.

Shedad was vexed at his conduct. What means
this indifference about us, said he? What do you
want of me? Said AntarâHast ever heard of any
one asking protection and countenance from a slave?
And abandoning noble princes? Mount, descend,
and destroy the enemy, Antar! cried Shedad, and I
will grant thee all thy wishes and hopes, and I
will raise thee to the rank and honour of an Arab.
But what will be this rank and honour? said Antar.
I will, said Shedad, recognize you as my son, and
as a part of my heart. O my nephew, descend and
drive away the enemy from us! exclaimed Malik,
and I will acknowledge thee of our family.

Whilst all this was going on between Antar,
Shedad, and Malik, the Teyans attacked the tents,
and plundered the property and goods, and captured
the women and families, even the females of King
Zoheirâs family; and his daughter Mootejeredah
and his wife Temadhur were both taken prisoners;
and they seized Ibla, and Shereeah and Semeeah;
and dreadful was the wailing of Ibla when they
[184]

threw down their dwellings to their very foundations,
and they left nothing worth a halter; for
they were Arabs, and greedy of plunder, and only
conquered for spoil; and there were men among
them who loaded their horses, and loaded themselves
with a good horse load besides; and in a short
time they left the whole country a barren waste,
driving away with them the females and the
families, as they departed over the hills and the
deserts.

Malik, Iblaâs father, looked towards the women,
and seeing Ibla was a captive among the warriors,
O my nephew, cried he to Antar, dost thou not see
thy beloved Ibla, and wilt thou not defend and
protect her? If I mount this instant, Malik, said
Antar, and destroy this party, and release Ibla
from her affliction, wilt thou give her to me in
marriage? Yes, said Malik, by the God that
created her and beautified her. And he extended his
hand towards Antar, and swore by the God of
mankind, and said, If thou dost liberate Ibla, she
shall be thy wife for ever: and Shedad admitted his
pretentions to honour and rank, and swore he would
not deny him again, were the foe to tear his body
to pieces.

Shedad and Malik having finished speaking, and
Antar having made them confirm their oaths,
Shiboob brought him his horse Abjer. Now mount,
O my brother, said he, for thou hast no more to say
[185]

to thy father and thy uncleâPut to the rout these
hateful foes. Antar clad himself in armour, and
encased himself in arms âtill he was like a tower, or
a mass rent from the mountainâs side. He rushed
impetuously down from the height like a tremendous
lion, his heart harder than stone, and his soul more
buoyant than the waves of the sea when it roars.
He shouted with a voice so loud that the whole
country and vallies trembled at the shockâYe
ignoble dastards, I am Antar the son of Shedad!
and he thus spoke:

âSoon shall ye behold my deeds this day with
the foe in the field of spear-thrusts, and the battle
fire; and my furious courage amongst the tribes;
so that in my sublimity, I will mount above the
Pisces. I plunge into the flames of war with the
cleaving scimitar, and I extirpate them with the
goring lance. I drive back the horses on their
haunches from the lofty seat of my thin-flanked
Abjer, and with the blade of my sword Dhami,
at whose edge flow the waves of death over the
enemy. This day will I exhibit my ardent soul
with my Indian sword, and I will meet the chests
of the horse with my thrusts. I will establish the
market of war in its field on the top of my steed,
in the protection of my country. My sword is
my father, and the spear in my hand is my fatherâs
brother; and I am the son of my day in the
heights of the deserts.â

[186]

He bent his head over the saddle-bow, and made
his attack. First, he sought the horseman who had
captured Ibla; he was in the rear, and his assault
was the assault of fate and destiny. He wished to
pierce him through the chest, but he feared the
point might touch Ibla, and she be slain with him:
so he wheeled his horse on one side, and came upon
his right like a ferocious lion, and shouted out in a
voice like thunder when it bellows, and pierced
with his spear his right side; the point issued out
on his left, and he hurled him down dead, weltering
in his blood. Ibla was terrified at the
thrust of the spear, but she was unhurt. Antar
dismounted and came to Ibla. âFear not, thou
light of my eyes, said he, thou shalt behold thy
Antar perform to day, deeds that shall be narrated
and recorded.â

Again he rushed upon the enemy like an outrageous
lion; and Shiboob attended him shooting his
arrows, with which he transfixed the hearts of the
warriors. At the first attack he dispersed the
troops from the tents, and in the second he laid bare
the whole plain. He poured down upon them and
he destroyed them, and overwhelmed them with
shouts, and horror and death. He hewed off their
arms and their limbs, and put to flight both the
right and the left. And God prospered him in all
he did, so that he slew all he aimed at, and overthrew
all he touched. How numerous were the
[187]

heroes he terrified! and at his shouts all the land
trembled.

Now the tribe of Abs distinguished his voice
through the confusion and thick dust, and they said
to one another, âhe has indeed routed them.â They
returned from the mountains and ravines, and joined
the battle, and their hearts gained courage at the
sight of Antar, the lord of war. But when Shas
saw how Antar moved amongst the enemy, and
how he overwhelmed them in slaughter and destruction,
his gall burst, and his hatred increased. He
turned towards his brother Cais, and saidâdost not
behold the deeds of that foul Black, how he cuts
down the enemy with his sword? Verily, he has
discomfited them, and dispersed them among the
wilds and the plains, and his greatness will raise him
above us all. But I wish, my brother, to take him
unawares and kill him whilst he is engaged in the
conflict, and make him drink of the cup of perdition,
that we may be relieved from his foul influence; and
it will be said that the Teyans have slain him.

What meanâst thou, O Shas! replied Cais; does
Antar deserve this of us, after having defended our
wives and our families? How can we be guilty of
such an act? Had it not been for Antarâs sword, the
enemy would not have left one of us aliveânot one
to tell the tale. My advice is that we should aid
him in the conflict, and drive away from us these
warriors, or we shall become a common proverb.
[188]

Cais continued to make such representations to
Shas, till he dissuaded him from his project. The
whole tribe of Abs then collected together, and
made one united effort against the enemy; and
men encountered men, and heroes heroes, blood
flowed, limbs were hewn off, and the Absians
exerted all their powers to join the lion warrior;
but it was impossible at that time, for Antar had
plunged into the midst of the Teyans, on account
of their horseman whose name was Rebeeah,
who was the leader of the troops. He was eminent
for his bravery, and it was he who had wounded
Shas, and had destroyed many Absians, and had
dispersed them among the mountain sides. And
Antar continued slaughtering, and searching him
until he overtook him, and did not give him time to
turn or move his bridle, âere he struck him with
Dhami upon his breast, dividing him down to the
thong that encircled his back, and he tumbled over
cut in twain.

When the Blood-drinker saw Antar smite the
warrior, he was terrified and confounded, and said
to his troops about him, this is no mortal man; all
that have dared him, have drank of the cup of perdition.
And as soon as he had released his daughter,
he placed her behind him, and sought the wilds and
the deserts, followed by the tribe of Tey and all the
troops that had survived. And they fled to the
mountains and the rocks, their standards reversed.
[189]

But the tribe of Abs pursued and drove them
before them full three parasangs from their country,
and then returned for the dispersed horses and the
scattered property. And they went back to their
own tents, Antar at their head, like the flower of
the Judas tree, thus exclaiming:

âI have abused fortune, but how can she humiliate
such as me! I too that have a spirit would
cut down mountains. I am the warrior of whom
it is said, he tended the he and she camels of his
tribe. When I assaulted Kendeh and Tey, their
hands brandishing the long spears, with armies,
that when I thought of them I imagined the
whole earth filled with men; and as their hardy
steeds trampled our lands, whilst you might see
them talking and exulting, âtwas then their
steeds fled away horrified at me, and the redoubled
thrusts that gored them as they sought the fight.
The noble hero feels no fatigue; him no challenger
need call to the combat. It was the slave
alone that drove back the horsemen whilst the
flame of battle was blazing,âthen speeded away
their troops in terror of my arm,âlight they
fled, burthened though they had been. Crushing
were the stamps and tramplings on their necks,
and the horse shoes dashed and pounded their
skulls. How many warriors were laid low by my
sword, whilst they tore, in very rage, their hands
with their teeth. I rescued the maidens and
[190]

virgins, and not one did I leave but bereft of
sense. Mine is a spirit for every enterprize, high
is my fame, exalted is my glory.â

These verses excited surprize and admiration
among the chiefs, and they thanked him. But
Malik, Iblaâs father, and Shas and Rebia, and the
tribe of Zeead, cherished a flame in their hearts;
they thanked him in appearance, but in their soul
their gall was burst. When they approached the
tents the women came out to meet them, beating
the cymbals, and the slaves brandishing their
swords; and Ibla stood in front of them like a full
moon when it shines, as she cried outâMay I never
lose thee, O thou defender of women, and destroyer
of every foe and enemy. At these words, Antarâs
grief and anguish vanished, and he thought that
in her presence he could slay a host of enemies.
The warriors then went down to their tents, and
no one but talked of Antar, how he slew, and
fought with the invaders; and they passed a night
of joy, glorying in the deeds of Antar the invincible
hero.

The next day arrived in haste King Zoheir with
his companions, for he had heard that his foe had
passed him on the road: he feared his family might
be destroyed and cut off; and he could scarcely
believe he should find his family safe from the
treacheries of the times; and as he approached the
tents he saw dead bodies scattered about, broken
[191]

scimitars and shattered spears, and his heart misgave
him. But when he reached the tents, the
chiefs came out to meet him: they saluted him,
and related what Antar had done. And when
King Zoheir heard this of the great Antar, he
said to his surrounding heroesâVerily by the
faith of an Arab, we are glorified in Antar above
all that inhabit the wilds. And Antar came out
to meet him; the King approached him, and
kissed him between the eyesâO Aboolfawaris, said
he, we are unable to reward thee for this act, even
were we to give thee all we possess in dominions and
property.

Then the warriors went to their tents, and the
King to his own pavilion. And his wife, Temadhur,
came up to him, and kissing his handsâO King,
said she, if you are wise and good, be kind to
Antar; for it is he that has protected your wife and
children. Thus was his joy in the deeds of Antar
augmented, and he slept at ease until the morning
dawned, when he ordered the sheep and camels to
be slain, and a feast to be prepared, and a magnificent
entertainment to be made ready for all the
tribe of Abs and Adnan. The most highly honoured
were Antar and the horsemen of the tribe of
Carad. After dinner they began conversing, and
Shedad related to the King all his son Antar had
done: how he himself having acknowledged his
relationship and connexion, and his brother Malik
[192]

having promised him to Ibla, he mounted his horse
and routed the enemy, and dispersed them amongst
the wilds and the deserts.

This struck to the heart of Shas, and his soul
was filled with indignation and rage, and his whole
frame was ready to burst. Shedad, said he, how
could you take upon yourself to introduce Antar,
the son of a slave, to our tribe, and admit him to
our rank and our consequence? Now we shall
become a shame amongst the Arabs to the end of
time, and they will say the tribe of Abs has
associated itself with black slaves.

O Shas, said Cais, give up this envious disposition,
in which no one partakes with you. And King
Zoheir turned also towards his son Shas, and
rebuked him. O my lord, exclaimed Antar, standing
up, the heart of Prince Shas is not inclined
towards me, I will therefore retire from you to
another tribe. Tears flowed from the eyes of Antar,
and King Zoheir and the tribe of Carad gazed at
him in astonishment; when at length the King
arose, and having kissed Antar between the eyes,
he thanked and praised him. Then turning
towards the warriors of Abs, he cried outââO ye
tribes of Abs and Adnan, and all ye that are here
assembled, ye all know the purity of my connexion
and rank, and my father and my mother, yet let
Antar be called as I am called, for he is, by the
faith of an Arab, my cousin, the antidote to all my
[193]

sorrow and my grief, and he who honours him,
honours me; and he who despises him, despises
me,âand he cried outâWelcome, welcome to my
cousin, thou reliever of sorrow!â

Among the first who succeeded Zoheir was
Prince Malik; he sprang towards Antar, and
embraced him and kissed him between the eyes;
and he likewise cried outâWelcome, welcome to
my cousin, the reliever of sorrow! When the
horsemen saw what King Zoheir and his son had
done, they could not avoid following the example;
so they sprang towards Antar and embraced him,
and kissed him between the eyes, and admitted him
to the honour and rank of an Arab, and all cried
outâWelcome, welcome to my cousin! But Shas
was violently enraged; he was nearly bursting with
passion; he arose hastily and went to his tent. But
the warriors sat down and began talking and jesting,
anxiety and sorrow left them, and they were all joy
and merriment; they ate meat and drank wine till
night brought on the darkness; and at the termination
of the feast the King clothed Antar in a robe
worked with red gold, and girded on a trusty sword,
and gave him a pike of Khata, and mounted him
on an Arab horse, and called him the Champion of
the tribes of Abs and Adnan. And Antar returned
with his father and his uncles towards the tents, and
his glory and honour were exalted among all the
horsemen; the warriors of the tribe of Carad
[194]

rejoiced, but his enemies and the envious were
grieved, particularly the family of Zeead.

Amarah went home, and his regret and affliction
increased; he laid himself down at full length, and
a fever and trembling attacked him, and his knees
and legs pained him, and he was fearfully indisposed.
He sent for his brother Rebia, and wept
before him; O brother, said he, if Ibla escape
me, I shall die of grief, and no one will know of
my death. Amarah, said Rebia, verily you have
done a deed you ought not to have done. We
must now consider this slave as our equal. From
the first, I never wished you to interfere with
Ibla, or connect yourself with the tribe of Carad;
and now that this vile slave has liberated her from
slavery we can do nothing with her, and cannot
succeed, unless her father indeed be inclined
towards you. To morrow I will go and see about
your business, and if I find that he still wishes for
you, it may be accomplished: otherwise make your
heart easy, Amarah; for if he inclines towards
Antar on account of his courage, we will consult
how to destroy him, and annihilate his life ere he
actually obtain her.

Thus were his alarms and jealousies in part relieved.
He waited patiently till the next day, when he
dressed himself in fine clothes, and perfumed himself,
and sent for Malik and his son Amroo, who
attended him and complimented him; and instantly
[195]

Amarah arose and received them with all due
courtesy. And Malik said to Amarah, what do
you wish of us? Most noble and excellent sir, I
only invited you to day, he replied, that I might
see whether your heart was pleased in marrying
that guarded pearl and concealed jewel to that
black slave, that feeder of camels and sheep, whom
the horsemen have preferred to their rank and
condition. Thus will your daughter be disgraced
amongst the noble Arabs. If indeed you do such
a deed, it will be impossible for us to remain in
this land. We only promised so to Antar, and
only admitted him to our relationship and rank,
said Malik, when he assisted us in the battle and
conflict; but we never thought he could escape safe
out of those perils, and rout such armies.

Well, said Amarah, to morrow when we repair
to King Zoheir, and when we are in full assembly,
I will demand your daughter; do you assent and
settle the amount of the dower, and when once the
dower is decided on, neither King Zoheir or any one
else can say any thing to the contrary: and I promise
you that the dower shall be a thousand he and she
camels, and a thousand head of sheep, and twenty
Ooshareeyi camels, and twenty horses of the noblest
breed, and a hundred silk robes, and fifty satin
garments spangled rich in gold, and twenty strings
of the finest jewels, and a hundred skins of wine for
[196]

the marriage feast, and a hundred male, and as
many female slaves.

Malik overjoyed, agreed to this proposal;
Amarah too, flattered himself he should succeed
in his expectations; and soon after Malik and his
son went home and tarried there till the morning.
The next day King Zoheir was sitting in his tent,
surrounded by the nobles of the tribe of Abs, when
Amarah and the family of Zeead presented themselves
before him; they had greatly enlarged their
turbans, and seated themselves according to their
rank on the left of the King, and Antar and the
Carad tribe were on the right, and the horsemen
took their places. O Chief, said Amarah, turning
towards Malik, do you think my rank mean, or my
connexion low? Are you not, said Malik, one of
our illustrious horsemen? We are now in the presence
of King Zoheir, continued Amarah, and I
come to you as a suitor to your daughter, and I am
solicitous for your favour; therefore decide on the
marriage dower and donation, and demand even what
the princes of the universe would fail in giving.

All this passed, and Antar sat still and heard it
and observed; and he was convinced his uncle
Malik favoured the Zeead family, and he feared that
if his uncle should decide on fixing the marriage
donation with Amarah, and should confirm it, Ibla
would pass out of his hands, and he would have no
[197]

more to sayâin vain he would reproach and revile.
Thus roused by the urgency of the moment, he
started up, and turning towards Amarah, exclaimed,
âthou he goat of a manâthou refuse!âthou
villain! Dost thou at such a time as this demand Ibla
in marriage?âthou coward, did not I demand
her when she was in the midst of twelve thousand
warriors, waving their bone-cleaving swords, and
thou and thy brother were flying among the rocks
and the wilds? I then descendedâI exposed my life
in her dangers, and liberated her from the man that
had captured her; but, now that she is in the tent
of her father and mother, thou wouldst demand
her! By the faith of an illustrious Arab, thou,
dastard, if thou dost not give up thy pretentions to
Ibla, I will bring down perdition upon thee, and I
will curse thy relations and thy parents, and I will
make the hour of thy wedding, an hour of evil tiding
to thyself and thy posterity!â

O Antar, said Amroo, Ibla is our daughter, and
it is for us to command; no prince or chief is
empowered to oblige us to marry her to any one but
whom we choose and approve.

At these words the light became dark in his eyesâhis
hand hurried to his irresistible Dhamiâhe
sprang from the ground on the back of his
Abjer, resolved to put Malik and his son Amroo to
death, and Rebia and Amarah too, and the whole
family of Zeead; and to carry off Ibla, and live
[198]

with her in the mountains; but he thought of King
Zoheirâs kindness, and how he had transferred
him from servitude to honour and freedom; so he
immediately changed his mind, and thus addressed
the Absians:

âWhen the family of Carad are ungrateful, and
the family of Zeead are violent in their acts, then
there is no blame or reproach to me, if I protect
mine own honour and rights by arms or by stratagem.
Is not fire kindled from a Zanad when the
stone is rubbed against the Zanad? Enjoyment
is ever desired after absence, and approximation
is wished for after separation. I have been merciful
to those who are not aware of the value of
my mercy, and my friendship has not been properly
appreciated. But after this forbearance I
shall act in another manner, till the towns and
deserts shall flow with my blood, and my sword
shall complain of fatigue in my hand, and my
joints shall murmur at the burthen of my belt.
Ye observed me well the day of Tey, and my
deeds with my Indian spear; and had my lance
a tongue, it would tell ye of the splitting of ribs
in the battle. How many challengers called to
me on the day of conflict, and hailed me, and I
answered each antagonist. O family of Zeead,
ye have opposed a noble lion that never flinches
from the fightâartless in speech and deedsâwith
a sword that cleaves heads and arms. Be on thy
[199]

guard then, O Amroo, on thy guard against him.
Let not thine eyelids be weighed down with sleep.
But had I not a chief who commands me, liberal
in speech, and exalted in power, I would do
myself justice with my sword, and soon would I
shew the difference between virtue and outrage.â

When Antar had finished, the chiefs admired
his eloquence: King Zoheir went up to him, and
made him dismount. May God never renounce
thy mouth! said he: may no one ever harm thee,
O thou protector of the tribes! And then turning
towards Malik, Iblaâs father, he saidâHow is it that
you will not marry your daughter to a hero? You
engaged her to him when he liberated her from her
perilous situation! My lord, my daughter is in
my tent, said Malik, you may command her, and
marry her to whom you please; I will not oppose
your directions, and I will not swerve from your
orders. Then said King Zoheir, Ibla can belong
to no one but our defender, the brave Antar. So
they sat down and ate, and thus they remained till
dark, when they went home, each to his tent.

[200]

CHAPTER V.

Now then, said Amarah to Rebia, when they had
retired, now that Antar has vanquished me, and has
taken Ibla by force, I can no longer remain in this
country; I must go and roam about the wilds
and deserts. Cheer up, Amarah, said Rebia, let us
still contrive the means to overthrow him, and to
make him drink of the cup of destruction and
death. Rebia left Amarah and went home, and
sent for Malik and Amroo, and when they arrived
he said unto Malik, pretend to be good friends
with Antar; appear very kind to him, and do not
prevent his entering your tents. Sooth him with
gentle words, and when he comes to you, ask him
about the dower for Ibla; then he will sayâwhat
do you wish? tell him you only demand a thousand
Asafeer camels, that your daughter may pride
herself in them above the high and low.

Know then, Malik, that these camels are in the
possession of Monzar son of Massema, the King of
the Arabs, and the lieutenant of Nushirvan; and I
know that Antar in the greatness of his courage,
will go in search of them among the tribe of Shiban,
and he will expose his life to danger and death, and
[201]

you will never see him again. Malik eagerly listened
to his advice; and it happened on that day that Antar
was out hunting; and when he returned in the
evening, his uncle gave him the kindest reception,
and ordered a slave to take away what he had
brought in; he introduced him into his house, and
gave him meat to eat, and wine to drink, and he
spent part of the night in his company. Antar was
much pleased at this reception and kind treatment,
and thought that his wishes with respect to Ibla
would be accomplished, for he knew not the plot
conceived against him. So they continued to shew
these civilities to Antar, and he was in raptures
in the enjoyment of Iblaâs conversation for ten
whole days.

On the night of the eleventh, Malik was more
than usually kind to him, and when the noble warriors
had all separated for the night, and Shedad
had gone home, and also Zakhmetulgiwad and the
rest of the tribe of Carad: and no one remained
but Antar, his uncle Malik, Amroo, and Shereeah,
Malikâs wife, and Ibla, their daughter, Malik plied
Antar with wine till he made him drunk, when he
addressed him and said; Tell me, I pray you, what
you wish to be done for my daughter Ibla; you
have prohibited all suitors; and do you intend to
take her by force without any marriage gift or
dower, and will you bring disgrace upon us in
every part of the world? That can never be, said
[202]

Antar, were I even to drink of the cup of death and
condemnation. God forbid that this guarded pearl
and this concealed jewel should be thus sold to the
highest bidder. I am only waiting ordersâtell me
what you demand, ask whatever you choose, that
I may grant her what will give her reason to pride
herself above the chiefs of the earth. Nephew,
said Malik, I will not make you engage for what is
beyond your power, and I will not demand of you
but what an Arab would demand; such as he and
she camels. I ask of you then a thousand Asafeer
camels, that my daughter may boast of them; for
in our tribe there are none; nor are there any like
them in Cahtan. Then will you and I obtain all
our wishes and our desires, and we shall destroy our
enemies and those that envy us,âthis is all I ask
of you, and then will I make your marriage feast
out of my own property, and will give you whatever
may be required of my own he and she camels;
all our possessions shall be united, and we will live in
perpetual felicity. Malik continued talking with
Antar in this manner till he gave way and consented;
and he knew not that the camels were in the kingdom
of Monzar, the King of the Princes of the
Arabs, and the lieutenant of Chosroe Nushirvan,
whose armies were innumerable.

Uncle, said he, I will give you these camels
loaded with the treasures of their masters; but give
me your hand, and betroth me to your daughter,
[203]

and thus shew me the purity of your intentions. So
Malik gave him his hand, and a fire blazed in his
heart. Antarâs joy was excessive, his bosom heaved,
and he was all delightâhe started on his feetâhe
took off his clothes, and put them on his uncle; and
Ibla saw Antarâs arms, and smiled. What art thou
smiling at, fair damsel? said Antar. At those wounds,
she replied, for were they on the body of any other
person, he would have died, and drank the cup of
death and annihilation: but thou art unhurt by
them. Her words descended to his heart cooler
than the purest water, and he thus addressed her:

âThe pretty Ibla laughed when she saw that I
was black, and that my ribs were scratched with
the spears. Do not laugh nor be astonished when
the horsemen and armies surround me. The
spear barb is like death in my hand, and on it are
various figures traced in blood. I am indeed
surprised how any one can see my form in the day
of contests, and survive.â

He then departed to his motherâs tent, for he
was restless, and the words of Ibla were as
a blazing fire in his heart. He wakened his brother
Shiboob, and told him to get ready his horse
Abjerâhe did as he was bid; Antar clothed himself
in armour, and stood like a tower. Where art
thou going? said Shiboob, that I may shew thee
the nearest roads. Well, said Antar, tell me the
nearest road to the land of Irak, for there are many
[204]

Arabs in that country, and their property and
camels very abundant; with them is my object, and
what my uncle has demanded.

Shiboob trembled and was confounded at this
intelligence, for he knew the country. Why not
stop till morning, said he, that thou mayst acquaint
King Zoheir and Prince Malik? for they may perhaps
be able to assist thee in this affair. Return
my brother, and expose not thy life to difficulties
and dangers. Away! away! cried Antar; not a
word; none but the Creator of mankind can aid
me; I must destroy my accursed enemies. Mine
be the dark and nightly course, after the manner
of mighty heroes; for if I travel by day they
will lay plots against me. Shiboob was convinced
he was right, and conducted him to the land of
Irak. And they continued their way over the
wilds and the deserts till the third hour, when
on a sudden there arose a great dust, and there
appeared a troop of horsemen like eagles. As soon
as they saw Antar, they closed their vizors and
waved their lances, and slackened their bridles and
fixed their spears: and when they came near to him
they cried out, down, down, from that steed, thou
dastard, strip off those accoutrements of war and
armour, or we annihilate thee! whither art thou
going over the plain? Here we have remained in
expectation of thee. As soon as Antar heard these
words, he shook his spear in his hand, rushed on,
[205]

and roared like a lion, and darted towards them
with a heart fearless of death and danger,âthus
speaking:â

âFortune insults me as if I were day and night
her foe, the enemy seek me in every peril, and
imagine I am unable to fight; but were they to
present to me the form of death itself as an antagonist,
I would imbrue its hands in the blood
of its own wounds.â

He attacked them, and his assault was like the
assault of the most furious lion: he rushed upon
their chief, when lo! he let fall his vizor from his
face and cried out, check thine arm, O Knight of
the age! sufficient is the mischief and danger, for
I am thy friend Harith, son of King Zoheir. Antar
threw down his spear, dismounted, and ran towards
him, and kissed his hand.

Now Harith was an undaunted warrior, in the
prime of youth, and eloquent in speech; he loved
Antar, and was much interested about him, like
his brother Malik; and the cause of his meeting
Antar in the deserts was, that he had been invited
to a feast by the tribe of Ghiftan, and was returning.
He met Antar, and the above passed. And when
he saw that death was hurrying from the ends of
his fingers, and that destruction was stamped upon
his spear, he let down his vizor, and Antar recognized
him, and dismounted and saluted him.

Why, my lord, said he, why hast thou acted thus?
[206]

Thou hast endangered thine own life, and those
that were with thee. Harith smiled, and was surprised
at his humility, after such proof of his superiority
over him. God prosper thee, O Aboolfawaris, said
he, jewel of the multitude! whither art thou bound,
and what great expedition hast thou undertaken?
He who wishes, replied Antar, that his nuptial
ceremony should be performed, must expose his
life to danger. Thou knowest what dangers and
what disgraces I have submitted to on account of
my cousin Ibla, in order that her father might give
her to me. He has demanded of me a marriage
dower, and a settlement, and I must bring what he
requires from Irak.

Terrified at Antarâs words cried Harith, what
is it thou sayst, Aboolfawaris? For Godâs sake return
with me, trouble not thyself about such matters,
and do not banish thyself from amongst us; our
property is not so small; and verily I am astonished
how my father and brother could let thee depart
alone. I told no one of my departure, said Antar;
My lord my uncle demands of me camels that we
have not, and are not in our tribe, and I have engaged
to procure them, and I have said yes: and
he thus continued.

âSay not no, after thou hast said yes, for thou
wilt be clothed in shame, and repent. Truly, no,
after yes, is foul; and base is the word, no after
yes. When thou wouldst have a friend, associate
[207]

with a noble person, one who is chaste, modest,
and liberal; and when he says no to a thing, do
thou also say no, and when thou sayest yes, let
him also say yes.â

Harith was surprised at his eloquence and virtuous
mind, and his admiration of him increased. If such is
thy business, said he, I will accompany thee and
assist thee in all thy difficulties. I cannot possibly
consent to that, replied Antar; return with thy warriors
to thine own country. So Antar bade him
farewell and departed over the wilds and deserts, and
Harith and his people returned, praising Antarâs
intrepidity and eloquence. Antar and Shiboob
proceeded on their journey, Shiboob ever shewing
the way, till evening coming on, they sought a pool
of water where they might repose from their fatigues,
and at length they reached a tent pitched
near a spring; and behold there was an old Shiekh,
with his back bent. They made towards him.

âAn old man was walking along the ground,
and his face almost touched his knees. So I said
to him, why art thou thus stooping? He said, as
he waved his hands towards me, my youth is lost
somewhere on the ground, and I am stooping in
search of it.â

He welcomed them, and brought them a cup of
milk, cooled in the wind; Antar took the milk and
drank, and gave some to his brother, and came to
[208]

the door of the tent. The old Shiekh laid pillows
for them, and presented viands, receiving them in
the most hospitable manner. And when they had
finished eating, the Shiekh made bold to ask Antar
his adventures, and why he was travelling. So he
related to him all that had passed with his uncle
Malik, and what he had demanded as a marriage
dower.

May God disgrace and overthrow and destroy thy
uncle, and not save him! exclaimed the old man;
for his only object in making this demand of thee,
is to annihilate and ruin thee. How is that, said
Antar, how so? Know, Aboolfawaris, replied he,
that these Asafeer camels are only to be found
among a tribe called the tribe of Shiban, and their
chief is King Monzar, son of Massema, the lieutenant
of King Chosroe, whose armies are innumerable,
whose power is irresistible, and he rules all the
Arabs of the wilds and the deserts; and if thou
wert to carry off these camels, who is able to protect
thee from King Monzar, or shelter thee? My
advice is, that thou shouldest return home, and not
expose thy life to dangers and death.

Antar remained that night in the tent, and the
next day mounted his Abjer, bade the Shiekh farewell,
and thanked him. Shiboob attended him by
his side, and they sat out in quest of the land of
Hirah, and when they had advanced some distance,
[209]

Antar thought of Ibla, and his absence from
her, and what he had suffered for her, and thus
spoke:

âIn the land of Shurebah are defiles and valleys;
I have quitted them, and its inhabitants live in
my heart: fixed are they therein, and in my
eyes; and even when they are absent from me,
they dwell in the black of mine eye; and when the
lightning flashes from their land, I shed tears of
blood, and pass the night leagued with sleeplessness.
The breeze of the fragrant plants makes
me remember the luscious balmy airs of the
Zatool-irsad. O Ibla, let thy visionary phantom
appear to me, and infuse soft slumbers over my
distracted heart! O Ibla, were it not for my love
of thee, I would not be with so few friends and so
many enemies! I am departing, and the back of
my horse shall be my resting place; and my
sword and mail my pillow, till I trample down
the lands of Irak, and destroy their deserts and
their cities. When the market for the sale of
lives is established, and they cry out, and the
criers proclaim the goods, and I behold the troops
stirring up the war-dust with the thrusts of spear
and sharp scimitarsâthen will I disperse their
horsemen, and the foe shall be cut down deprived
of their hands. The eyes of the envious shall
watch; but the eyes of the pure and the faithful
shall sleep; and I will return with numerous
[210]

Asafeer camels that my love shall procure, and
Shiboob be my guide.â

As soon as he had finished, his tears flowed
abundantly. They travelled on till they reached
the land of Hirah, where they saw populous towns,
plains abounding in flowing streams, date trees and
warbling birds, and sweetly smelling flowers; and
the country appeared like a blessing to enliven the
sorrowing heart; and the camels were grazing, and
straying about the land: and they were of various
colours, like the flowers of a garden; and there
were she camels, and young camels, and slaves and
attendants. And as soon as he saw them he was all
anxiety, quite out of breath with eagerness. And
he felt that his uncle had sent him on this commission
to insure his death and destruction, unless
his intrepidity should guide him through.

Ebe Reeah, said he to Shiboob, I well know that
this is a land great in power, and in no region is
there one to be compared to it. We have nothing
for it but prudence and daring fortitude in danger,
and a timely submission to power, that we may obtain
what we are in search of, and return rejoicing
and successful. Hasten then, son of my mother, and
look after these Asafeer camels, and mark them,
whilst I let my horse Abjer rest himself. Shiboob
consented to what he directed, and leaving his
bow and quiver, disguised himself in the clothes of
a slave and feigned himself sick. Thus he went
[211]

towards the pastures, where he saw the camels like
young brides; and when the slaves marked Shiboob,
they sprang towards him, welcomed him, and made
him sit down, and took out some of their provisions,
and made him eat, asking him whence he came, and
what had happened to him.

I am a slave of the tribe of Zebeed, said he, and
Shedad is my masterâs name; and he is a stubborn
cruel man, and had no compassion for his slaves,
male or female. So I have run away and have left
him, and my wish is to meet some one who will
protect me from him. Remain with us as long as
thou pleasest then, my cousin, said the slaves
pitying him, and be welcome! and thy time shall
pass pleasantly enough.

Very thankful was he, and remained with them
the rest of the day, and he told them all manner of
lies and deceitful tales till he had marked out the
Asafeer camels, and he saw they were the miracles
of the age; and when evening came on, the slaves
and attendants drove away the camels, and sought
their habitations and homes, and Shiboob went with
them. But when they came nigh to the tents, it
being now dark, he separated from them and gave
his feet to the wind, seeking the plain till he
was in the presence of Antar, who sprang up to
meet him, exclaimingâTell me, O Ebe Reeah,
what news hast thou! Nothing, said Shiboob, but
that we are in a dangerous position, and under fate
[212]

and destiny, unless the Lord of Heaven is our
defender and protector.

O Shiboob, said Antar, is it not well known that
when a slave exposes his life to the abyss of danger,
he is exalted to the height of glory? They then
concealed themselves till morning dawned, when
Antar clad and incased himself in armour till he
appeared like a tower, or a fragment rent from a
mountain; and he went forward till he reached the
pastures, crouching along as a wolf after a sheep.

And when it was day, the Asafeer camels were
driven to graze, and behind every thousand she
camels were ten slaves to attend them, that the
males might not annoy them. The she camels
ranged about grazing, and the slaves began to amuse
themselves; for they were slaves of the King of
the Arab chiefs, and knew not what it was to be
attacked.

These are the Asafeer camels, said Shiboob, so
make thy plan, and act as it seems best to thee. Run
on, said Antar, and occupy the road to Hirah, so that
their cries be not raised against us, ere we be far
away out of this country. As thou pleasest, brother,
said Shiboob. And he moved along on tiptoe over
the plain, till he came in the rear of the slaves, when
he seated himself on his knees, and emptying his quiver
of arrows before him, waited their attack. As to
Antar, he urged on Abjer, and plunged amongst
the he and she camels, and cut off a thousand of the
[213]

Asafeer camels with his spear, crying out to the
slavesâYe base born, drive away these camels, and
on before me! or my sword will be stained with
your blood.

When the slaves heard Antar, they were terrified
at his enormous bulk and gigantic shape, and the
rolling of his eyes, and the weight of his arms.
They drove the camels before him, and goaded them
on with the points of their spears, and they fled
away before them like eagles. And thus they proceeded
till about the third hour, when behold a
great dust arose and darkened the land; and when
it dispersed there appeared a party of Arabs of the
tribe of Zakhim and Juzam, about twelve thousand
horsemen; all hardy warriors armed with sharp
swords and long spears, screaming outâWhither
are ye going, ye dastardsâhence is there no escape
out of this land!

Now the cause of the arrival of this troop of
horsemen was as followsâThe slaves that had escaped
from Antar and Shiboob sought their homes
and habitations, and it happened that they encountered
the train and equipage of Monzar on a hunting
party, attended by his warriors and his troops; who,
turning towards his son NumanâSpeed your horse
on a little, my son, said he, and bring me intelligence
of these shepherds. Now Numan was his eldest
son. So Numan directed his horse towards the
slaves, and enquired whither they came. O Prince,
[214]

said the shepherds, a black Knight, mounted on a
black steed, and whose voice is the roar of a lion,
darted down upon us and seized a thousand of the
Asafeer camels, and carried them off.

No sooner had Numan heard this account of the
shepherds, than he cried out to the men and the
warriors that accompanied him, and slackening his
horseâs bridle, galloped after Antar, and twelve
thousand in number were the lion heroes that followed
him. And they halted not till they overtook
Antar, as we mentioned, and cried out as we
described.

When Antar saw them, he smiled, for battle was
his joy and delight. O! thou black born, said
he to Shiboob, I want thee to guard the camels,
whilst I shew thee a day of horrors among these
miscreants. He then turned the camels into a
mountain cave, and received the warriors as the
parched-up earth receives the first of the rain; and
he penetrated through the thick dust with blows
irresistible and never failing. Whatever he struck,
he slew, and wherever he thrust, he hurled down;
and for one hour he overwhelmed them in death
and perdition; and the foremost shrunk back upon
the rear, crying out at him from a distance, for no
one dared to approach the spot where he was. As
to Shiboob, the slaves betrayed him, and refused to
drive on the camels.

But when Numan saw that his troops and men
[215]

fell back, and perceived how Antar was handling
them in the combat, his mind and senses were
greatly agitated, and he cried out to themâMay
God disgrace you among the Arabs!âare you
reduced to this by a single black slave, a mean,
paltry herdsman? The horsemen took courage, and
poured down upon Antar from all sides, but Antar
continually slaughtered them, always gaining upon
them, never flinching, though their numbers were
immense. Thus was he in the midst of dangers, when
lo! his horse stumbled, and throwing him on the
ground, rushed from out the thick dust and tumult,
his saddle unoccupied by his master Antar. Shiboob
thought he was killed and trampled to death!
the tears flowed from his eyes, he gave his feet to
the winds, and he sought the wide desert, whilst
the slaves and shepherds cried out to the horsemen
and warriors, who pursued Shiboob from all
quarters; and they were seventy in number, all
after Shiboob, who depended on the power of his
muscles. The horses were straining themselves to
catch him, but they could not pass him, or come
up with him, from the grey dawn of day till the
sun became tinged with yellow. But when evening
came on, woe and dismay fell upon him, and just
as he was convinced of his ruin and death, he
reached a cavern in the hollow of a mountain, and
near it stood a swarthy youth tending sheep; before
him was a fire blazing; and he was sitting down
[216]

preparing his dinner, and his sheep were grazing
in front of him. As soon as Shiboob saw him, he
made towards him, O young man, he cried, help
meâI put myself under thy protection, for I am
a stranger, and I am exposed to peril and danger
in this land. I am nearly dead, and my enemies
have already slain my brother. Yes, by thy father,
said the youth (for his heart had compassion on
him.) I will indeed protect thee, and I will not
deliver thee up till I am myself slain. Enter the
cavern, and consider thyself secure from the deceits
of the wicked.

Shiboob entered the cave, where he had scarcely
concealed himself, when the horsemen also arrived,
fleet as eagles, shouting aloudâBoy, son of a two
thousand horned cuckold, bring out to us that
devil who has slain our horsemen, and staggered
our senses, that we may tear his body in pieces
with the points of the spear, and hack him with the
blades of our scimitars. God curse him who gave
him birth! how strong are his muscles!

O Arabs, said the shepherd, grant him to me, I
pray ye, and accept of my guarantee for him, for I
have protected him, knowing nothing about you; he
is under my security and protection. Thine is not
and never shall be any protection, cried they, so
bring him out, or we will slay thee together with
him; for his brother has destroyed three thousand
of our famed horsemen; he is indeed a very devil,
[217]

and we have experienced from him what we never
even saw from the Genii.
[4]

When the peasant heard them he was fearfully
alarmed, for were he to oppose them, they would
soon destroy him. O Arabs, said he, do but remove
about seventy paces from the cavern door, that I
may enter and bring him out of my protection.
Do so, said they; and they retired from the cavern,
and the shepherd entered, and perceived Shiboob
trembling for his life. You have heard, young
man, said the shepherd, what has passed between
me and these men. My vows have been overruled,
and I have exposed myself to death and
annihilation. I can do nothing towards your
escape, but at the hazard of my own life; yet will
I not forfeit my protection. Had I but ten horsemen
of the tribe of Asad, they should not approach
you, no not one of them; but I am alone in this
wilderness and desert. So throw off your clothes,
and put on mine; take these provisions and this
wallet, sling it over your shoulder, and with my
staff in your hand, hasten out of the cavern, and
drive away the sheep, and when you come up to
them, sayâO Arabs, I went into the cave, in order to
bring him out, but he will not stir, so come along, and
I will shew him to youâthey will dismount and enter
the cavern, and then do you look after yourself.

[218]

Shiboob thanked him from his heart for his kind
assistance: he slung on the wallet, and took the staff in
his hand, and went out of the cavern, and the darkness
of night concealed him from the eyes of observers;
and when he came up to them he spoke to them as
the shepherd had directed him: they immediately
dismounted and went towards the cavern; but
Shiboob gave his feet to the wind, and traversed the
rocky crags until he was far off among the wilds and
the deserts: and thus he secured his life from death
and destruction, and sought relief from the contents
of the wallet.

In the mean time the Shibanians entered the
cave, and dragged out the shepherd, thinking it
was Shiboob; they looked at him by the light of
the fire, and they saw it was the shepherd dressed
in Shiboobâs clothes; for he had preferred to expose
his life to death and torture, rather than discredit
his protection. Why hast thou done this deed, cried
they, and given up thy life to death and perdition
for the sake of a stranger?

Arabs, replied the shepherd, he sought my protection,
and I protected him. You came in search
of him; you would not accept my proposal, and I
was not able to drive you away. But if I have
enraged you, kill me at once, and I shall have
rescued him by the sacrifice of my life and existence,
and shall not have forfeited my word, or broken my
faith. Moreover between you and me, there is no
[219]

blood or revenge. I have indeed fallen into your
power; but if you will have the kindness to release
me, I will thank you in every part of the world, otherwise
do as you list, and decide as you judge best.

The Shibanians were astonished, and they could
not find it in their hearts to kill him. He indeed rejoiced
in his friendly act, and the preservation of his
duty; so they let him go, and returned vexed and
dispirited. As to Shiboob, as soon as he was safe,
he travelled on till morning, passing over plains and
deserts; but what was most grievous to him was the
thought of returning to the tribe of Abs, and the triumph
of his foes, and the envious; particularly the
family of Zeead, and the ruffian Amarah, and Shas
and Rebia; then he wept for his brother Antar, in
these verses.

âO Knight of the Horse, why, alas, has the steed
to mourn thee? why, alas, has the barb of the
spear to announce thy death in wailings? O that
the day had never been, that I saw thee felled to
the earth, cut downâstretched outâand the
points of the lances aimed at thee! Could the
vicissitudes of fortune accept of any ransom, oh.
I would have redeemed thee from the calamities
of fortune! Thine uncle has in his wiles and
frauds made thee drink of the cup. But may
thy cup-bearer, O son of my mother, neâer taste
of the moisture of dew! and thy cousin will
mourn thee, and she belongs to thy foe, whose
[220]

slave thou wouldst never consent to be. O
Knight of the Horse, I have no strength of mindâI
have not a heart that can ever feel consolation
for thee in my sorrows! and the war-steed
amongst the troopers as he neighs will turn
towards thee, mourning for thee, like a childless
woman in despair.â

When Shiboob had finished these verses, he went
on passing over deserts and wilds, seeking the tribe
of Abs and Adnan, whilst his tears flowed in streams.
But as to Antar, when his horse stumbled beneath
him, he started on his legs, he brandished his
sword in his right, and supported his shield on his
left, and he made towards the warriorsâhe slew
them till he made mounds of dead, he overwhelmed
them with his shouts, bellowing outââO Ibla, by
thine eyes, will I slay this day these horsemen!â
and he rushed upon them like a furious lion, till the
blood flowed from all parts of his body. And in the
thickest of the battle he happened to step on a skull,
and his feet slipping from under him, he fell down
at his full length. And they gave him not time to rise
ere they bound fast his shoulders, his arms, and his
ribs and his feet, and brought him before Numan.

He was all astonishment at the horror of his
make, at the immensity of his stature, and the
agitation of his eyes. Numan ordered them to tie
him across the back of his horse and convey him to
the King; that he might do what he thought proper
[221]

with him. They obeyed his orders, and bound
him on the back of Abjer, and they all returned to
the land of Hirah. At the moment of their arrival,
King Monzar returned from hunting. When,
behold there appeared against them a lion of the
lions of Khifan. Now the wild beasts of Khifan
were proverbial; and he came upon them with a
loud roar, and the fierce warriors attacked him.
Numan presented Antar to his father and when he
looked at him, he was terrified and confounded.

What Arab art thou? said he. My lord, replied
Antar, I am of the tribe of the noble Abs. One of
its warriors, demanded Monzar, or one of its
slaves?ââNobility, my lord, said Antar, amongst
liberal men, is the thrust of the spear, the blow of
the sword, and patience beneath the battle dust. I
am the physician of the tribe of Abs when they are
in sickness, their protector in disgrace, the defender
of their wives when they are in trouble, and their
horseman when they are in glory, and their sword
when they rush to arms.â

Monzar was astonished at his fluency of speech,
his magnanimity and his intrepidity, for he was
then in the dishonourable state of a prisoner, and
force had overpowered him. What urged thee to
this violence on my property, added Monzar, and
seizure of my camels? My lord, said Antar, the
tyranny of my uncle obliged me to this act: for I
was brought up with his daughter, and I had
[222]

passed my life in her service. And when he saw
me demand her in marriage, he asked of me as a
marriage dower, a thousand Asafeer camels. I
was ignorant, and knew nothing about them; so
I consented to his demand, and set out in quest of
them; I have outraged you, and am consequently
reduced to this miserable state.

Hast thou then, said Monzar, with all this fortitude
and eloquence, and propriety of manners,
exposed thy life to the sea of death, and endangered
thine existence for the sake of an Arab girl? âYes,
my lord, said Antar; it is love that emboldens man
to encounter dangers and horrors; and no lover is
excusable but he who tastes the bitterness of absence
after the sweetness of enjoyment; and there is no
peril to be apprehended, but from a look from
beneath the corner of a veil: and what misfortune
can drive man to his destruction, but a woman who
is the root and branch of it!â Then tears filled his
eyes, and sighs burst from his sorrowing heart, as he
thus exclaimed:

âThe eye-lashes of the songstress from the
corner of the veil, are more cutting than the edge
of the cleaving scimitars; and when they wound
the brave are humbled, and the corners of their
eyes are flooded with tears. May God cause my
uncle to drink of the draught of death at my
hand! may his hand be withered, and his fingers
palsied! for how could he drive one like me to
[223]

destruction by his arts, and make my hopes
depend on the completion of his avaricious projects.
Truly Ibla, on the day of departure, bade
me adieu, and said I should never return. O
lightnings! waft my salutation to her, and to all
the places and pastures where she dwells. O ye
dwellers in the forests of Tamarisks, if I die,
mourn for me when my eyes are plucked out by
the hungry fowls of the air. O ye steeds,
mourn for a Knight who could engage the lions
of death in the field of battle. Alas, I am an
outcast, and in sorrow. I am humbled into
galling fetters, fetters that cut to my soul.â

When Antar had finished, Monzar was surprized
at his eloquence and fortitude, and strength of mind
and virtue. Now Monzar himself was one of the
most eloquent of Arabs, and he was convinced that
Antar was sincere in his grief; but he knew
not the story of his life. Whilst Antar and Monzar
were conversing, behold the people ran away from
their presence. On inquiring what was the matter,
O victorious and irresistible monarch, they
exclaimed, a savage lion has appeared among us,
is destroying the horsemen, and dispersing the
brave heroes. Spears make no impression on his
carcase, and no one dares to attack him. Assault
him, cried the King, before he takes refuge in the
forest, and cuts off the road of the travellers, and
renders the ways unsafe, and we therefore be dishonoured.
[224]

As soon as Antar heard this, his afflictions
were relieved. Tell your people to expose me
to this lion, said he to the King, and if he should
destroy me, you will be amply revenged, and your
dishonour be cleared up: for I have slaughtered
your troops, and destroyed your warriors; but
should I slay the lion, reward me as I deserve, and
do not refuse me justice. The King ordered the
cords to be loosened: the guards came up to him
and untied his hands, and were about to untie his
feet also; but he cried out, Loosen only my hands,
leave my feet bound as they are, that there may be
no retreat from the lion. He grasped his sword and
his shield, and jumping along in his fetters, he thus
exclaimed.

âCome on, thou dog of the forests and the hills!
this day at my hand will I make thee drink of
death. Soon wilt thou meet a Knight, a lion
warrior, a chief tried in battle. O then, attack
not one like me, for I am a chosen hero. Attack
the horsemen, thou dog of the waste, but whither
wilt thou escape from me this day? Take this
from my cleaving sword, that deals sorrows, deaths
and pestilence from the slave of a tribe, that braves
death and woe, and never fails.â

Monzar was much astonished at his address to the
lion, and he advanced with his attendants, to behold
what Antar might do. And when they came near
him, they perceived it was an immense lion, of the
[225]

size of a camel, with broad nostrils and long claws,
his face was wide, and ghastly was his form; his
strength swelling; he grinned with his teeth clenched
like a vice, and the corners of his jaws were like
grappling irons. When the lion beheld Antar in
his fetters, he crouched to the ground, and extended
himself out; his mane bristled up; he made a
spring at him: and as he approached, Antar met
him with his sword, which entered by his forehead,
and penetrated through him, issuing out at the extremity
of his back bone. O by Abs and Adnan!
cried Antar, I will ever be the lover of Ibla. And
the lion fell down, cut in twain, and cleft into two
equal portions; for the spring of the lion, and the
force of the arm of the glorious warrior, just met.
Then, wiping his sword on the lion, he thus spoke.

âWilt thou eâer know, O Ibla, the perils I
have encountered in the land of Irak? My uncle
has beguiled me with his hypocrisy and artifice,
and has acted barbarously towards me in demanding
the marriage dower. I plunged myself into a
sea of deaths, and repaired to Irak, without friends.
I drove away the camels and the shepherds
single handed; and I was returning home burning
with the flame of anxious love. I quitted them
not till there arose behind me the dust of the hoofs
of the high mettled steeds. I encountered on
every side the war dust, and illumined it with
my thin bladed faulchion, whilst the horsemen
[226]

clamoured beneath it, so that I thought the thunder
had let loose its uproars. As I retired, I
found that my uncle had deceived me with his
frauds and stratagems. But I did not fail till
my horse was exhausted, and faultered in the
charge, and the crush of combats. Then I dismounted
and drove away whole armies with my
sword, as I would have driven away the camels.
I rushed upon the horsemen that fiercely scoured
the plain, piercing chests and eye balls; but at
the close of the day I was wearied and made
captive; for my elbows and my legs were deprived
of all strength. They dragged me to a noble
prince, high and magnificentâMay his glory
endure! Then too, I engaged a lion, fierce in
the onset, and harsh of heart, with a face like
the circumference of a shield, whose eye balls
flashed fire like hot coals. I rushed at him with
my sword. I met him in my fetters, so that Monzar
might bestow on me what might gratify my
uncle, and favor me with the desired camels.â

Monzar heard him, and beheld his acts. This
is verily a miracle of the time, and the wonder of
the age and world, said he to his attendants; his
intrepidity and eloquence and perseverance are
enough to confound the universe; with him I will
effect with Chosroe what is the object of my wishes,
and I will establish the superiority of the Arabs
over the Persians.

[227]

Now Monzar was an intelligent man, and very
regular in the administration of justice, and prudent
in policy. For this reason Chosroe had appointed
him King over the Arabs; and when he was present
in the palace of Chosroe, he enjoyed superior dignities,
and he was never stiled but as King of the Arabs.
And Chosroe used to treat him as a friend, and to
eat and drink with him; and when they were busy
in conversation, Monzar used to describe to him the
peculiarities of Mecca and the sacred shrine, and
their glory over the Deelimites and the Persians,
and used to recite to him the verses of the eloquent
men. And Chosroe, in his impartiality, was pleased
with him, and enjoyed his society, and loved to dignify
him with presents of gold and silver, for the
Chosroes of Persia were renowned for their love of
justice and impartiality, and abhorred oppression and
violence, ruling mankind with liberality and generosity.
He had over his head a bell of red gold,
and a chain attached to it on the outside of the palace;
and whenever he touched the bell, the attendants
went out and complainants entered his
presence; and he decided such matters himself.

Now it happened that Monzar, previous to Antarâs
falling into his hands, had visited Modayin,
and presented himself to Chosroe, and staid with
him some days, and he was honored with a rich
robe and various presents. One of the officers
envied him, and when he was alone with the King,
[228]

he ventured to say, Why do you so honour, O King,
this wild Bedoween, this worshipper of stone, and
raise his dignity so high? Whether he is absent
or present, he is a poor despicable wretch; for all
the Arabs are but shepherds, and worshippers of
images; there is no religion and no faith among
them, and they are only ennobled by theft and
cunning, and robberies and rogueries.

This officer thus became jealous of the honours
enjoyed by Monzar, and his heart was estranged
from him. And he was one of the warriors of
Deelim, and was a leader of twenty thousand Persians,
and he was called Khosrewan, the son of Jorham.
He was always talking contemptuously of the
Arabs, repeating falsehoods of them, till at last he
effected a change in the heart of the just King.

If, O King, said he, as he ended the conversation,
thou art desirous of thoroughly understanding this
man whom thou hast appointed over the Arabs,
and of having a proof of his ignorance and ill-breeding,
ask him to come and eat meat and dates;
order the servants to give him dates from which
the stones are not extracted, and to place before
you dates ready stoned; and let there be instead
of stones, almonds, sugar plumbs, and skinned nuts,
and see what he will do. Chosroe complied, and
invited Monzar to eat meat and dates; and he
ordered the servants to do as Khosrewan had recommended.
So after dinner, the servants produced
[229]

the plates of dates. Chosroe and the Persians ate
away and swallowed them, for there were no stones
to throw aside. Monzar looked at them, and
thought within himselfâMost certainly to day
is a festival with them, for they are worshippers
of fire; so I must eat like them, and must fashion
my manners to theirs. So Monzar ate, and swallowed
the stones; but one sadly puzzled him, so the
attendants burst out into a loud laugh; and Chosroe
also laughed. And Monzar was abashed at their
pleasantry. May your glory last for ever, O King
of the world, said he. But the wrath and indignation
of Monzar increased. What makes your attendants
laugh? said he; You have eaten dates and
swallowed the stones, said Chosroe; âtis for that
we are laughing at you. I, O King, said Monzar,
imitated you and your companions, and I ate as you
ate, for I perceived you eating the dates and swallowing
the stones, and I wished to do as you had
done. Our dates, said Chosroe, are without stones;
and instead of stones there are almonds and sugar
plums and peeled nuts, so that we eat them
without trouble or annoyance. Why, said Monzar,
did you not give me some of what you eat yourself?
Still I am your guest. Yet this is a proof that I am
an object of ridicule to you, and you have only invited
me that you and your companions might
expose me. But I am still at all times your slave,
and indebted to your bounty for whatever you have
thought proper to do unto me.

[230]

He remained some time longer with Chosroe, and
then returned to the land of Hirah, having asked
permission to revisit his family and native country.
And when he reached his capital, he wrote letters
to the tribes of Wayil and Bekir and Jelhema, and
he said in the lettersâAttack Modayin, plunder
the people and the inhabitants, lay waste the villages,
and put to the sword the merchants of Persia, and
plunder the property of Deelem. Be afraid of no
man should any oppose you; but slaughter them
and seize their property, and plunder them.

When these letters, in which the whole circumstance
was described reached the different tribes,
they were greatly incensed, and sent Sewid the son
of Amil to plunder the inhabitants. And Handala
ransacked the stores and granaries, and seized the
property of the travellers; and Harith the son of
Joshem plundered the lands of Zilah, sparing
neither high nor low. After this, confusion and
rebellion rose up in the villages, and the whole
country dreaded the Arabs. Many of the Persians
were beheaded, and the Persian merchants cried
out from all quarters against Chosroe. The day of
judgment seemed to have come upon him, and he
was overwhelmed with shame. He desired his
minister Mubidan to write to Monzar an account
of all that had passed, and that he should punish
the Arab tribes, or he would disperse them among
the plains and the deserts.

So the minister wrote to Monzar a letter, in
[231]

which he said âTo him, whom we recognise as
King of the Arabs! Truly the heart of the just
King is greatly irritated against you, on account of
the depredations committed by the Arabs on his
subjects. You must slay the rebels and offenders,
and chastise those that have oppressed the weak, if
you are obedient to the Persian government, and
attend to the orders of the imperial monarch; and
peace be with you from the protecting fire!â He
folded up the letter and sealed it and sent it to
Monzar, and when it reached him he opened it and
read it, and wrote in answer to it these words:

âTo him whom we recognise as the just King!
Truly my character is despised amongst the Arabs,
my reputation is on the decline, my authority
amongst them is weakened, and my honour is
considerably discredited, since they heard what you
did to me about eating the dates. My power is at
an end, because they think I am an object of ridicule
with you; so they have therefore renounced their
allegiance to me, and have separated themselves
from my dominion. Such are the acts they have
committed, and they will not obey my commands.
You must look after your own country, and mind
your own administration.â

When Chosroe received this answer, he read it,
and understood its contents. Verily, said he, these
vagabond Arabs have a design upon me, and this
dog of dogs would trample upon me. But if I do
[232]

not degrade and humble him, I am not the King of
the age.

Who, O King of the age, said the satrap
Khosrewan, the original cause of all this trouble, is
this Monzar, that you should trouble yourself
about him? By your life, I am able to take him
prisoner, I will slay his horsemen, and will destroy
his allies. I will bring him and his children to you,
all bound with cords; and if you order me, I will
kill them all, and will bring you his sons and his
daughters, and most costly plunder.

Khosrewan, said Chosroe, you are the only
person for this expedition, for it is all your
doing; so prepare, and march with the troops
under your command; and if you conquer the King
of the Arabs, kill him not, but bring him to me a
prisoner, that I may disgrace him and punish him,
and let him feel his own situation; and afterwards
I will grant him his life. Khosrewan accordingly
made his preparations in three days, and set out
with twenty thousand horsemen, armed with
gilded shields and cleaving swords; and Khosrewan
was at their head, like a lion.

But King Monzar, as soon as he observed
Antarâs blow at the lion, and remarked his eloquence
and his poetry, felt assured that he was a
distinguished hero and warrior, and he thought it
wiser to spare his life, and not put him to death: but
for the ends of justice he determined to keep him a
[233]

prisoner. So he detained him in custody; saying, by
the faith of an Arab, I will not proceed to extremities
with respect to this black warrior, for his equal
is not to be found in the whole world. Guard this
horseman, said he to his sons, until an answer
reach us to our letter from the Persian King;
and we will then persuade him that it is this wretch
who has plundered the cities and killed his subjects,
and who has excited against us the Arab hordes.
This will give a strong colour to our excuses in all
points, and thus we shall gain our objects upon our
enemies. So Antar remained with the King imprisoned
and chained; and Monzar entered Hirah
and awaited the answer.

It was about the beginning of the day when
Monzar mounted his horse and rode out to inhale
the news; when lo! a dust from the direction of
Persia appeared, and the whole country was
blackened and darkened, and from beneath it came
forth Persian horsemen, and the armies of Deelem.
Take your implements of war, cried Monzar, ply
the blow and the thrust, and protect the families
and the women, or eternal will be your disgrace;
for truly the offences against propriety in conversation,
and the blunders of the tongue are the
calamities of man. And he sent for all the clans of
the tribe of Shiban, and all the Arab hordes; and
the Persian troops gave them no rest, but poised
their spears, and grasped their swords. The two
[234]

parties met, and attacked: blood abundantly
flowed, eyes were fixed, and were scared. Khosrewan
advanced: he assailed the tribes of Arabia
and his heart was overjoyed; he dashed towards
the standard of Monzar; he overset them, and he
destroyed the horsemen, and annihilated them.

Now Monzar had encountered the Persians with
only twelve thousand men; and the evening did not
close before four thousand of them were slaughtered,
and the remainder returned, seeking safety in
flight; the Persians pursuing them until the shades
of night surrounded them; when the Persians
dismounting to repose themselves, Khosrewan also
halted and shouted aloud; and when they had
pitched their tents and lighted their fires, he
ordered his satraps and generals to surround the
whole city of Hirah, and to guard the roads and
highways.

But Monzar, who entered Hirah routed and
discomfited, gnawed his hands from shame, and was
quite bewildered and beside himself. He sat down
attended by his three sons, Numan, Aswad, and
Amroo; and whilst they were consulting and
debating, in rushed a slaveâO my lord, cried he,
that Absian warrior who is in my custody, when he
heard the uproar in the morning, asked me what
was the matter? We informed him what had
happened; then, said he, Conduct me to your King,
that I may point out to him the means of destroying
[235]

his enemies, even were they as numerous as the
sand of the desert. Produce him, said Monzar, let
us hear what he has to say, and let us release him
from his fetters. But Antar was that day thinking
of his cousin, and of his expedition to procure her
dower, and to seize the Asafeer camels, and his
falling into captivity, and his failure. Then, as he
sighed from his overcharged heart, he thus
recited:

âTell Zoheir and Malik of me, tell Ibla of me
in unvarnished language, that I seized the
camels flaunting over the plains, and that I felled
down the armies on the day of terrors; say
that I was marching away with the property and
the beauteous camels, when the stern faced horsemen
of Sakim forced them from me. My steed
hurled me on the battle field, and betrayed me,
and subjected me to the thrusts of every shield-armed
hero. Then I retired as a hostage, in
chains: and I have merited them; and I moved
along in them, like one overwhelmed with confusion.
Had it not been for the assault of the
lion among them, and their cry to meâAid us,
O Antar! when I met him, fettered as I wasâthey
never would have acknowledged that I was
the slayer of armies. When the furious beast
flew at me, I feared not. My sword cleaved the
body of the lion, and I forced it out through his
thighs in an instant, and I wiped it on his skin.
[236]

They have cast me into a sea of deaths, anxious
for my destruction, but I tumbled him down like
one precipitated from a mountainâs height.â

We have told King Monzar, said the attendant
as he entered Antarâs prison; he now demands you,
in order to hear your proposal. Antar got up and
went with them into the presence of the King, who
ordered the fetters to be taken off from his feet, and
the cords to be cut that bound his hands. Then
he sighed, and thus spoke.

âMay God forgive me that my soul is hardened,
for my uncle beguiled me and exposed me to
perils, and in his vile artifices has cast me into an
abyss of fire, whose flames encompass me. I am
become tortured of heart, fettered, my fingers and
hands bound round my neck. Few are there like
me in the day of the wood-entangled spears, when
heroes contend in the fierce charge: O King of
the world, thy sea is expansive as the glittering
sword among men and dÃ¦mons. When the
warriors chargeâthen expose me to them and
try my assaultâmy battle among them. Be
thou victorious, with Antarâs aid, and convert, my
lord, thy fears into security. Protect but my rear
with a thousand lion heroes, and thou shalt view
the wonders of my sword and my spear. Thou
shalt see a lion driving away the horsemen with
a scimitar that surpasses the lightningâs flash in
brilliancy. Grant me the dower for my beloved
[237]

Ibla, of the thousand camels, that have excited
me to this enterprize. O Ibla, fear not the foe
on my account, when they crowd about me, and
the war horses charge: for death is but my own
formâmy own qualities, and there is no prosperity
but what is attached to my bridle. I am
the youth that fells the horsemen in my strengthâa
youth whose equal exists not on earth. O
breezes! I implore ye by the pillars at Mecca, by
Zemzemâby the sacred plains and Mesdelifa,âwhen
ye pass the land of Sheerebah, waft my
salutation to Zoheir and his royal sons, and say
to the sorrowing Shiboob, hast thou forgotten my
faithârenounced my vows? for thou art my
foster brother, my stay, my support when my
friends betray me and persecute meâO Shiboob,
haste then, my brother, haste that thou mayst see
what I have suffered, and what has befallen meâthat
thou mayst see a battle that will make
thee forget the past, and that thou mayst see, O
Shiboob, the boundless height of my glory;
For my ambition soars above the Pleiades, and
my fortunate star sparkles with brilliant rays.â

The King was exceedingly surprised at Antarâs
bursts of poetry and strength of mind; and he was
convinced of victory with his sword and spear. O
Absian, said he, what is this I have heard of you to
day, when you heard the shouts and the attack of
the enemy? Truly, my lord, replied Antar, my
[238]

gall was nearly bursting when I heard that you had
been obliged to fly from these cauldrons of dogs;
this disgrace can never be erased from the Arabs.
What can men do, said Monzar, when double their
numbers attack them? and they are overwhelmed
by those who do not fear their carnage? Man,
said Antar, must patiently resist, and drink of
the cup of death as he drinks the purest water, and
not fly or run away. I am now in your power, and
I demand of you the marriage dower of Ibla,
my uncleâs daughter; restore me my sword, my
cuirass, my arms, and my horse, and give me a
thousand men to defend my rear; and you shall see
what my courage and force will effect against your
foes.

By the virtue of the Kaaba, said Monzar, O
Absian, if you perform what you state, and destroy
this armyâall my property, my he and she camels
are all at your disposal. Not one of us shall
remain behind the tent wall, but we will exert our
utmost energies against the foe, and we will strike
with our swords, and thrust with our spears. And
he ordered his horse and his arms and his cuirass to
be restored. And early on the morrow, a loud shout
arose from amongst the Persians, eager to plunder
the property and capture the women and the children;
but the Arabs went forth against them, and at
their head was Antar, the hero of conquest; and he
cried outâYour hopes have failed, you cauldron
[239]

of dogs, you shall this day see Antar perform what
nations shall record. Then he cried, O by thy
eyes, O Ibla, and thus repeated:

âOn the day of battle exquisite is the carnage.âCome
forth then against me, ye men of abominationâin
me ye shall meet a Knight whose blow
strikes life dead. I am the Antar of horsemen in
the contest, that makes armies and warriors drink
of ignominy, a draught from his hand with the
polished sword that glides through the neck, in
the battle field. Soon will I plunge into the war
dust till I encounter Khosrewan, and make him
drink of the cup of death; I will make him taste
from my sword a draught, after which he shall
never taste of pure water. Ye shall see the horse
scattered oâer the wastesâthe Himyarite chiefs
shall be bound on their saddles. I am the lion,
foremost in war, and mine arm is the horror of
warriors. Mine is honour and good fortune and
glory, and my star is high above the brilliant
Arcturus.â

He then received the attack of the horse as the
parched up ground the first of the rain; and his
thrusts were the thrusts that blinded vision, and
equalled fate and destiny. He overthrew heroes
and destroyed warriors, and in an hour blood was
flowing and streaming, and bowels were ripped open.
When the Persians observed these dreadful deeds
they advanced from all quarters. The voice, of
[240]

Antar was like the thunderâs peal, and his thrusts
more rapid than the flash of the lightning; and the
Arab warriors, encouraged at his steadiness, felt
convinced of victory after defeat; but as soon as
the Persians saw these descending misfortunes, their
hearts regretted what had passed, and the land and
the region appeared too confined for them. The
whole country was blackened in their eyes, their
avidity was frustrated in the capture of the sons and
daughters.

Affairs continued in this position till mid-day,
and they toiled in the battle fiercer than a blaze of
fire. And when the heat oppressed the warriors,
the Persians gave way, and sought refuge in their
tents, and gave a loose to their despair. Many
were the horses deprived of their riders. Their
chief, Khosrewan, stood under the standards, and
the delay seemed tedious, for he was expecting that
his companions would return with the captives and
the spoil; when, lo! they indeed returned, but
in flight. O my lord, they cried in reply to his
questions, the Arabs have vanquished usâwe have
seen a prodigy among themâand if you do not
come down upon that chosen horseman, not a head
or tail of us will survive; for he fails not where he
aims; he succeeds in whatever he undertakes; and
if he attacks a whole troop, he disperses it; if he
assaults a horseman, he overthrows him, and his
voice is like a crash of thunder; the moment a man
[241]

hears it a universal ague seizes him; and he is like
a lion when he assaults, and he drives away the
warriors before him like a flock of sheep.

As Khosrewan heard this he was greatly enraged,
and fire flashed from his eyes. Whence comes this
horseman, he exclaimed, to this country? and to
what Arabs is he related? Then starting from
beneath the standards he sought the place of
slaughter, and the scene of attack. In his hand
he bore a long mace with which he assailed the
troops; he dived through the dust, and the
heroes trembled at his mace, as the dust rolled
over his horse.

Now Monzar was directing his sons to move beyond
the precincts of Hirah, when the form of
victory and triumph appeared to him in the odour
of that black lion. He sat down in his tent, and
seated Antar by him, for he was dearer to him than
all his family and relations; he congratulated him,
and gave him to eat, and there was no end to his
attentions and kindness; and as he engaged to him
every favour, he said, if I knew your heart would
be gratified by remaining with me, I would send a
messenger to your King, and would offer him my
friendship, and I would direct him to take Ibla
from her father and send her to us, whether he
will or not. But I fear you will not allow me to
do, what your heart would not sanction.

I cannot possibly remain here, replied Antar;
[242]

every day appears a thousand years to me; but I
swear by all your munificence towards me, were even
my heart to burst with the fierceness of my love
and passion, I will not quit this country till I
have accomplished your wishes in destroying your
foul enemies: to-morrow, by the grace of God, I
will rout their army. To-morrow I will go out to
the field of battle; I will challenge Khosrewan;
and I will invite him to terminate the affair, and if
he engages me, I will make him drink of the
cup of death; and afterwards I will put to flight
these troops of horse over the plains and the
deserts. When they had finished eating and
drinking, and their conversation about the battle
and the contest, they retired to rest and sleep. As
soon as the morning dawned with a smile, the
horsemen rushed on anxious for the fight and the
conflict; and as Khosrewan was preparing to
proceed to the field, lo! from the Arab army there
came forth a man between the two ranks, and stood
conspicuous amidst the two armies, and both parties
gazed at him. He was like a strong battlement,
quite immersed in steel; in his hand was a sparkling
blade, and he had a long spear slung over him, and
under him was a steed of the colour of gold,
indefatigable in labour, as an Arab poet has
described.

âPraise a yellow steed of the colour of gold, for
he is of the horses noblest in pedigree; his rider
[243]

shall outstrip every warrior in the beauty of his
shape and paces. He may be in the evening at
Tekmet, and in the morning at Aleppo.â

And he gallopped over the plain to and fro, and
he disclosed a countenance like that of a Ghoul;
the warriors and heroes marked him: and lo! it
was the illustrious chieftain and intrepid warrior,
Aboolfawaris, Antar the son of Shedad; and he
came forth to put an end to the Persian contest
and to slay their general; and thus return to his
family and country with wealth and riches. He
dashed into the centre of the army; he disdained
the common herd, and would not condescend to
challenge them. He burst on the right, and discomfited
it; and slew threescore and tenâhe
rushed on to the left, and forced it in confusion on
the right; he returned again to the centre, seeking
carnage and bloodshed. He was mounted on a
mare, for his horse Abjer, wounded the day before,
was still unfit for the day of encounter. And when
he was in the centre, between the two armiesâhe
thus spoke.

âRelieve my painsâease my sorrows. Sally
forth, aye, every lion warrior. Taste a draught
at the edge of my sword, more bitter than the
cups of Absynth. When death appears in the
crowded ranks, then challenge me to the meeting
of armies. Ye Persians, I heed ye not, I
heed ye not. Where is he who wishes to fight
[244]

me, and wants to make me drink the liquor of
death. Bring him forth, let him see what he
will meet from my spear under the shades of the
war-dust. I swear, O Ibla, he shall eat of death.
By thy teeth, luscious to the kiss, and by thine
eyes, and all the pangs of their enchantment, and
their beauty, were thy nightly visionary form
not to appear to me, never should I taste of
sleep. O thou my hope! O may the western
breeze tell thee of my ardent wish to return
home. May it waft thee my salutation, when
the sparkling dawn bursts the veil of night.
May God moisten thy nights, and bedew thee
with his rain-charged clouds. May peace dwell
with thee as long as the western and northern
breeze shall blow.â

When Antar had finishedâbehold Khosrewanâhe
appeared on the plain, and he was mounted on
a long tailed steed, marked with the new moon on
his forehead, and on his body was a strong coat of
mail well knit together, the workmanship of David;
and armed with an imperial casque and a glittering
sword; and under his thighs were four small darts,
each like a blazing flame. And when he came
forth on the field of battle he roared aloud, and contemptuously
of the Arabs. Antar assailed him: high
arose the dust about them, so that they were hid
from the sight. They exhibited most extraordinary
prowess; they separated, they clung to each other,
[245]

now they sported, now they were in earnest; they
gave and took, they were close, they were apart,
until it was mid-day, and both had severely toiled.
But whenever Khosrewan attempted to assail Antar
and strike him with his mace, he ever found him
vigilant and on his guard, and aware of his intent.
So he darted away from him in order to gallop over
the field, and would exhibit all his manÅuvres and
stratagems; but Antar kept him employed, and
wearied him, and prevented his executing his designs,
so that the chieftainâs wrath became intense.
He snatched up one of his darts, and shook it and
hurled it at himâit flew from his hand like the
blinding lightning, or descending fate. Antar stood
firm, and when it came near him, he met it, and
dexterously turning it off by his shield, it bounded
away, and fell upon the ground far off. Khosrewan
snatched out a second dart and levelled if at him;
but Antar sprang out of its way, and it passed
harmless. He aimed a third; but Antar rendered it
fruitless by his dexterity and his persevering activity.
He hurled the fourth, but it shared the same fate
as the others.

When Khosrewan saw how Antar had parried
the darts, his indignation was extreme. Again he
took up his mace, and he roared even as a lion roarsâthen
stretching himself out with it, he hurled it,
backing it with a howl that made the plains and
the air rebellow. Antar threw away his spear
[246]

and met the mace and caught it with his right
hand in the air; then, aiming it at Khosrewan, he
cried out, take that, thou son of a two thousand
horned cuckold! I am the lover of Ibla, and am
aloneâthe PhÅnix of the world. Khosrewan saw
him grasp the mace in the air, and was horrified,
for his strength and force were exhausted. He retreated,
and attempted to fly from his antagonist, for
he was now convinced of his destruction. He moved
round his shield between his shoulders; but he felt
that his fate was nigh at hand, for the mace fell
upon his shield more forcible than the stone of a
sling; furiously it rattled on the Persian chief, and
hurled him off his saddle to the distance of twelve
cubits, and broke his ribs and snapped his spine.

Every warrior was intensely agitated at this surprizing
deed; and when the Persians saw it they
were bewildered; they rushed upon Antar, agonized
as they were at this calamity, and exposed their
lives to certain death. The Arabs received them
with undaunted courage at the points of their
spears; and their spirit was exhilarated by the acts
of Antar. The two armies assailed, and the earth
was pounded under the trampling of the horses.
The horsemen and the clans encountered, clouds
of dust thickened over their heads. And their
fury increased, till they were like the waves of
the boisterous ocean. Spears penetrated through
hearts and waists, heads were flying off, blood was
[247]

boiling, cowards were scared, the courageous full of
fire; the King of Death circled round the cup of
mortality; and the commands of the Most High
were executed upon them.
[5]

Antar, the ferocious lion, felt his heart assuaged
in the midst of slaughter, and in the concussion of
heroes and warriors. He exhibited terrors amidst
the concourse of heroes, and scattered whole armies
over the plains and the mountains. King Monzar
cried out aloud to his troops, and they exposed
themselves to the enemy: roused afresh was
the flame of war; it fiercely raged, and its sparks
flashed; the dust blackened the whole land, so that
both earth and heaven were veiled. The ground
tottered under the hoofs of the noble steeds, until
the sweat even moistened their entrails. Blood
flowed from the throats of the chiefs. Antar strewed
the brave on the earth, and souls complained of
their sufferings to him who knows the secrets of the
world. Heads were hewn from the branches of their
bodies; and the Persians saw in the deeds of Antar
that day, what terrified them, and magnified their
horror. They fell back in flight upon the plains in
agony at their dispersion and discomfiture, and
complaining of what had befallen their nobles and
their chiefs. The Arabs in their rear drove them
on to their fate, and truly their desires and wishes
were accomplished. As they exulted in the realization
[248]

of their hopes and expectations, they crowded
round Antar to thank and praise him, and he
stood before them like one immersed in a sea of
blood. Then as he recollected the horrors he had
suffered, these verses boiled in his heart, and he
thus exclaimed:â

âAsk, O Absian maid, my spear and my sword
what they did on the day of the battle of the Persians.
I steeped them, whilst the spear gored
through the horse, in the blood of the foe mixed
with bitter Absynth. I dispersed the army that
bellowed out their thunders, and beneath it flashed
the lightning of their swords, mounted as I was
on a noble Arab charger, that flies when the
sword blades crash in the fight; he neighs for joy
whilst the spears are directed at him, that vibrate
like speckled serpents. I urged him into the sea
of deaths; he snorted, and plunged into the
tempestuously roaring waves. How many horsemen,
O Ibla, at the edge of my faulchion have torn
their hands with their teeth in repentance! but I
felled them down on the battle plain, that the wild
beasts and eagles and hovering vultures might
drink of their blood. I must love the tribe of
Abs, were they even to shed my blood unrevenged,âsuch
is my love for thee, thou daughter
of noble chiefs! I will endure the burthen of
grievances, and sorrows, and captivity, and shew
that I am a warrior and the son of a warrior
[249]

May the peace of God be with thee, O Iblaâsoon
will I come to thee with my trophies!â

Antar having finished these verses, the chiefs and
the warriors were astonished at his eloquence, and
they repaired with the spoil and plunder to the presence
of King Monzar, who started up to meet
Antar, kissed him between the eyes, and could only
congratulate him on his safety, for he was confounded
at such instances of his bravery. Horseman
of the day, he cried, protector of Abs and Adnan!
all that the Persians have left this day be thine, O
Knight of the time and age! for thou hast earned it
by thy sword and thy spear. Thou hast brought
peace and comfort to the Arabs. Let this plunder
be a grant from me to thee, together with the Asafeer
camels; and moreover, out of mine own will I
bestow immense wealth on thee; but I cannot permit
thee to wed the daughter of thy uncle any
where but here with me in this land, and I will fulfil
all thy wishes and thy desires; for I am resolved
to send letters to the tribes, and to assemble the
hordes from the waters and the springs, and make
ready for war against the just King.

O my lord, expel that thought from your mind,
cried Antar, for by the life of the eyes of Ibla, to
me the strongest of oaths, I alone will stand thee
in stead of the whole race of Arabsânever will I
cease from the blows of my Indian sword till I have
not left in your presence one of your enemies alive,
[250]

not a cuckold of them. Moreover, âtis my intention
to put you in possession of the throne of Nushirvan.
Monzar expressed his thanks, for he knew he could
perform what he promised, from what he had observed
of his intrepidity in the black rolling dust.

Thus they entered Hirah, and rejoiced in their
victory and triumph; and Antar went to the habitation
that was prepared for him. Monzar retired
to rest; but he was greatly disquieted, and feared
Chosroe and his stratagems.

[251]

CHAPTER VI.

On the next day when Monzar was seated on the
throne of his kingdom, and the horsemen of his clan
were around him, they consulted and deliberated,
and they were unanimous that the Arabs should be
written to, and precautions be taken against Nushirvan.
And when they had come to this resolution,
an attendant entered, and kissing the ground, saidâO
King, excellent tidings for you in the arrival
of your Vizier Amroo, the son of Neefeela! Now this
vizier was one of the oldest men of the age, for he
was four hundred years old; he was well versed in
history, and acquainted with every event, and he was
one of the wise men who had predicted the mission
of Mohammed the seal of Prophets and delegates;
and he generally resided at Mecca, expecting his
appearance, that he might be directed by his light.

When Monzar heard of his arrival, he was rejoiced
and delighted at the good news. In a short time he
presented himself, and saluted him. Monzar sprang
up to meet him, congratulated him, and saluted
him. O Chief, said he, you are come just at the
very moment you are required, for I am overwhelmed
with anxiety; and for its removal I depend
[252]

first on God, and then on you. I am quite disconsolate
at the state of my affairs, and I have repented
of what I have done, and I wish for you, O Vizier,
to bear some of my burthens.

And when he had informed him of all that had
passed between him and ChosroeâYou have indeed
acted wrong, O King, said Amroo, in this
business; verily as soon as I heard the news, I came
as fast as I could from the land of Mecca and the
sacred shrine, fearful lest your country should be
laid waste, and the Arab chiefs destroyed by the
hands of the worshippers of fire, and you would
be thus involved in disgrace and in misery. Indeed,
I have recommended to you a thousand times
not to make the fire-worshippers your enemies,
until you should hear that Mecca is illuminated
with the light and appearance of the chosen Prophet
to be sent from Adnan, for then will the temples of
fire be extinguished, and the palace be rent: but
now you have only to bend to error, and take care
to obey the orders of this monarch, even should he
outrage you. For you have slain his satrap and
cut up his horsemen; so beware of his deceits.
Moderation is now most advisable; renounce writing
to the Arabs, but have patience till I go to Modayin,
and observe its inhabitants, and mark the
state of affairs. I will visit their minister, Mubidan,
and request him to give up this point, and direct
him to avert from us the ill-will of Nushirvan.

[253]

Your advice is most judicious, said Monzar; act,
O Vizier, as it seems fit to you; I will oppose nothing
you say. So Amroo went to repose himself; and
then Monzar reported to him the deeds of Antar,
how he had slain Khosrewan, and destroyed an
army of twenty thousand horse, and had given victory
to the Arab warriors after their defeat and
flight; the Vizier was astonished at Antarâs acts,
and intrepidity, so superior were they to any thing
hitherto known in deserts or towns.

On the third day the Vizier Amroo mounted his
horse and repaired to Modayin, having first recommended
Monzar to treat Antar with attention and
kindness, and to prevent him from returning to his
own country. He traversed the deserts and cultivated
places till he reached Modayin, when he
presented himself to Mubidan, the Cazi of the
worshippers of fire, without ceremony and without
permission. Mubidan rose up in haste to meet him,
and received him with the highest honour and distinction;
he made him sit by him, and spoke to him in
the most friendly manner, saying,âWhat has
induced you to visit me? What has made you
trouble yourself about me? I was not at hand when
these events took place, said the Vizier, and I was
not present at these occurrences; I was at Mecca,
and in those parts; but as soon as the news reached
me, and I heard how King Monzar had eaten the
dates with the stones, I was convinced that troubles
[254]

would arise between them. I came at full speed,
for I feared some great disaster, and I wished to
settle the business ere I died. But I did not arrive
till all was over; so I have hurried to you, in order
to arrange matters, fearing that these human considerations
would bring about unnecessarily disagreeable
consequences. Therefore, O Chief, be benevolent
as long as kindness is in your power, and be not
revengeful on account of a difference in religion.

Mubidan was pleased from his heart, and the
flame of his anger was extinguished. O Amroo,
said he, before you arrived, I had resolved to arrange
this business: the army has returned routed, and
its chief has been slain; but I have not reported
this circumstance to the just King, fearful that blood
would be shed, and men be slaughtered. I have
also my anxiety about events which have lately occurred,
and I wish to relieve the heart of the King
of some of his burthens; for governments sicken
as men sicken, and they have no other physician
but their Viziers; and these are acquainted with the
evils and the remedies.

What is it, cried Amroo, that has troubled the
heart of the just King; for he is the ruler of all the
tribes! You know that the Emperor of Greece,
answered Mubidan, has always been accustomed to
send to Chosroe a vast quantity of goods, and precious
stones and metals and jewels, and male and female
European slaves, and other objects, in short, that the
[255]

tongue fails in describing. At this present time a Grecian
chief is come with the treasure, and in his suite
are five hundred horsemen of his nation, and ten
priests, and five monks; he presented himself before
Chosroe in his palace, and spoke to him by an interpreter
sayingâO mighty King, I am indeed come with
the wealth and jewels and rich presents, such as fire
cannot consume, and beautiful virgins and slaves;
but I must make one stipulation with you, viz. that
I will not deliver them to you, unless you have
a horseman that can vanquish me in the field of
battle.

Now the cause of the arrival of this Chief, continued
Mubidan, and of his appearance before Chosroe, was
this extraordinary circumstance.âHe had quitted
the Isles of the Sea, in order to visit the holy shrine
at Jerusalem, and the fountain of peace; and when
his pilgrimage was terminated, he heard a good report
of the cities of Syria, so he repaired thither,
and resided there some time; and one day being in
the presence of Harith, in the course, he exhibited
his horsemanship and intrepidity, far superior to
the other horsemen. Harith having remarked his
extraordinary prowess, sent for him and presented
him with a robe, and exalted him in rank above the
nobles of his court, accommodated him in a house
suitable to his station, and supplied him with provisions.

And Harith for a long time engaged him against
[256]

the warriors, and he overcame every antagonist in
force and ability, and in course of time he conquered
all the armies of Syria, who acknowledged his intrepidity
and superiority, and yielded to him the highest
honours, so that Harith greatly rejoiced in him; and
he said, this is indeed the sword of Jesus; and he
resolved to present him to the Roman Emperor.
So he wrote to the Emperor, and mentioned what
feats this Chief had performed. Keep him with
you, said he in his letter, and prevent his returning
to the Isles of the Sea, in order that you
may obtain, through him, what you wish and desire
from the Arabs and the worshippers of fire; and
he sent his letter by a messenger.

On the next day Harith dispatched the Chief with
a party of his attendants to wait on the Emperor.
The messenger travelled with the letter till he
reached Antioch, and being admitted to the presence,
he delivered him the letter, which he took
and read, and having understood its secret meaning,
was rejoiced in the Chief. He even went out to meet
him with all the nobles of his court, and ministers
of the kingdom. So when the Chief reached the
suburbs, he was greatly surprised, as were all his
companions, for he thought this meeting of the Emperor
was accidental, not being aware of the letter
Harith had sent forward. The Chief dismounted
and crossing his face before he spoke, kissed the
earth in the presence of the Emperor, who, much
[257]

surprised at the courtesy of his manners, desired
him to remount his horse, and taking him by his side,
they all returned together to Antioch, every one
gazing on the Chief, and astonished at his gigantic
shape and stature, till they arrived at the city,
when all their anxiety and trouble being at an end,
every one returned home. And there being no one
present, the Emperor sat down, and made the
Chief do so likewise by his side, and invited him
to tell his adventures, and offered him riches and
possessions.

O most beneficent monarch, said the Chief, I left
not my country in search of wealth, but the reason
of my departure was to seek the reward of virtue
and meritorious acts, I have reached your presence,
and my wish is to exhibit my prowess before
the inhabitants of this land, that I may attain the
object of my desires. The Emperor showed the
warrior every possible attention.

Now the name of this Chief was Badhramoot; he
remained three days as the Emperorâs guest, on the
third he appeared on the plain, and the horsemen
came out against him; but they retreated from before
him in shame and disgrace, and he remained galloping
about like a dÃ¦mon. For three days he continually
exhibited himself on the course, till he had marked
all the troops of the Emperor in the combat; and
when the Emperor perceived his superior skill, he
was much surprised, and wished to detain him with
him, that he might, through him, be victorious over
[258]

his enemies; and amongst other things he thought
of marrying him to his daughter, and of sharing with
him his dominions.

One day Badhramoot came to the Emperor
and found him sitting down, and all his treasures
before him; he was selecting the best metals and
jewels, and was putting them in cups, and was
sealing them up, and was packing them up in
boxes, and was preparing them for a long journey
by land. Badhramoot was much agitated and surprised
at this. To whom do you intend sending
this treasure? he asked. To Chosroe Nushirvan,
the lord of the crown and palace, replied the Emperor,
for he is the King of Persia and Deelem, and
the ruler of nations, O monarch, this King, is
he not of the religion of Jesus the son of Mary?
the chief asked. He is the great King, he replied,
and he worships fire; and he has armies and allies
whose numbers are incalculable, and on this account
I send him tribute, and keep him away from my
own country.

At these words the light became darkness in
Badhramootâs eyes. By your existence, O King,
said he, I cannot allow any one to adore aught but
the Messiah, in this world. We must wage a sacred
war, and have a crusade against the inhabitants
of that land and those cities. How can you submit
to this disgrace and indignity, and humble
yourself to a worshipper of fire; you who are the
Emperor of the religion of the Cross, and the Priestâs
[259]

gown? I swear by him who withdrew a dead body
from the earth, and breathed into clay, and there
came forth birds and beasts, I will not permit you to
send these goods and presents, unless I go also
against those people, and fight them with the swordâs
edge. I will engage the armies of Chosroe, and
exert my strength against them; if I am slain, then
you may stand to your covenant.

Rid us of this affair, exclaimed the Emperor;
avert and withdraw from us the supremacy of
Chosroe and his armies; but do not open upon us a
gate which we shall not be able to close: and if you
wish to make a journey to the land of the King, go
with these presents, and when you are in his presence,
tell him your own storyâexamine the extent
of his dominion, and his horsemen, and the number
of his troops, and his allies. Ask him to let you
fight his bold warriorsâwhatever you desire, he
will grant you; and when you have engaged the
horsemen and succeeded in your attempt, then inform
me, that I may shew you what I can do. But
if you find that his power is too great, conjure him
to spare this land and realm.

Badhramoot agreed to this proposal, and he departed
with the presents, and he arrived at Modayin,
his heart free from fear. He went to Chosroe and
presented his letter, and said through an interpreter,
O most glorious King, you know that Kings will
not submit to tribute until they have been vanquished
[260]

in battle. I am now come with all this
property as presents to you; but I wish to avert
this disgrace from the Christians, and I will engage
your warriors in your presence. If they slay me in
the combat, my blood is rightfully yourâs; but if I
am superior to all your heroes and combatants, then
relieve us from tribute, and do not expose mankind
to difficulties and hardships, for in all religions it is
tyranny and oppression to shed blood.

All this being interpreted to Chosroe, his anger
and indignation, though considerably excited, were
softened by the mildness of the Chieftainâs representations.
He pondered the subject some time, and
then, being convinced that he had only made a
reasonable demand, he turned towards his satraps
and saidâTake this Chieftain, and conduct him to
a mansion suitable to his rank, with his suite, and
provide them with every thing to eat and drink,
that we may comply with his requests; let the
property be left with him, that we may likewise
fulfil his intention: to-morrow we will go to the
plain to view the combat of the horsemen, and we
will not receive the presents but on your terms.

Accordingly the satraps conducted the Chief and
his suite to a spacious mansion, and left all the
property with them. The next day the armies
mounted and repaired to the plain, and all being
assembled, Chosroe mounted his horse, surrounded
by the standards and ensigns; and when the
[261]

two parties were drawn up, the Chief came forward
like a huge camel, his priests and monks attending
him; he urged on his horse into the field of contention,
and the brave heroes were rushing upon him
from all sides; but Chosroe issued orders to his
people that they should draw lots, and thus proceed
in rotation against him, and whoever should
conquer him should receive all the presents he
brought with him.

When the combatants heard this, they retired
from the scene of combat and drew lots, and the lot
fell upon the first of the generals named Shirkan,
son of Tirkan. He sallied out against the Chief;
but the Grecian warrior waiting till he came close
to him, drew his foot out of his stirrup, struck him
on the breast with his foot, and hurled him on the
ground. The whole body of horsemen were
confounded, and their limbs trembled within them.
Again they drew lots, and the lot fell upon a
sturdy warrior, one of the worshippers of fire: he
fought with various arms, and he was indefatigable
in the combat: he rushed at him armed with a
mace, roaring like a lion; he opened wide his arm
as he came near to him, and endeavoured to strike
him and knock him down; but the Chief struck
him with the but-end of his spear, and dashed him
to the earth; he had already drawn out the barb
from his spear; and there was not a combatant that
came forward but he stretched him on the ground:
[262]

and before the close of the day he had vanquished
a hundred valiant warriors. Then Chosroe sent
for him, and received him kindly, and gave him
a robe. By the burning of fire and its flames, said
he, you have earned all this property from these
vile miscreants.

Chosroe then returned, and he was greatly
enraged with his own troops; but the Chieftain
was rejoiced, and he reposed that night in security.
The next day he returned to the contest, and
Nushirvan also mounted his horse, and the combat
was the same as the first day; and the Grecian
quitted not the scene of action till he had overcome
more than a hundred warriors, many with their ribs
broken, suffering the pangs of death and perdition.
And Chosroe was exceedingly wrath with his troops.

Thus continued the Chief to engage the heroes
of Persia for fifteen days, and he excelled them all;
and the armies of Chosroe were disgraced. In
affliction he passed the night, and he rose up to
grief and gloom. Matters were in this situation,
when lo! Mubidan entered. O Vizier, cried Chosroe,
watch over us in this important affair; behold
what is befalling us with respect to this experienced
Greek, for verily, he will tear our empire in
pieces with his intrepidity; and we are unable to
rid ourselves of his power. I wish to write to
Khosrewan, to come to us with his horsemen
against this Grecian devil.

[263]

Refrain from such expressions, O King, said
Mubidan, for you may still accomplish your wish,
and degrade and hold in contempt this Chieftain,
and the affair terminate to your glory and success.
How can that be? said the King, and what do you
propose? My opinion is, said he, that you write
to your Lieutenant, King Monzar, the ruler of the
Arabs, under whose command are all the tribes, and
order him to send you a few of his slaves, and they
will subjugate for you this obstinate Chief, and will
accomplish what you covet and desire; for the
Arab horsemen are the horsemen of victory and
conquest; they only are brought up in plains and
rocks, in battle and slaughter; in such emergencies
the horsemen of Hijaz are most renowned; but our
horsemen, O King of the world, are only famed for
magnificent entertainments.

The King laughed, and saidâHow can this be
brought about, Mubidan? Monzar is irritated against
us by what has happened between me and him,
owing to the satrap Khosrewan, who is now gone
against him with his troops and forces, and I have
no intelligence of him. Live for ever, O King of
the world, said Mubidan; but for your Satrap, the
fire has received his soul, and its smoke and its
flames have consumed him. His army is returning
routed and beaten. I have kept this circumstance
a secret from you, but now the fire has made me
think it proper to disclose it to you.

[264]

O Vizier, said Chosroe, greatly distressedâIn this
extremity, what is your plan; how can I possibly
send to Monzar, now that he has rent in pieces my
honour, and slain a satrap of my government?

O King, said the Vizier, the honor of your Empire
is in his handsâhe alone can save it; for he
possesses a warrior of the race of Adnan, who would
encounter every horseman and hero you possess.
Then informing him of all that concerned Antar
from beginning to endâIt would, in my opinion,
be right, added he, to send to King Monzar a robe
and presents, and direct him to produce before you
this lion horseman, for he will surely destroy yon
Chief, and will remove this distress and affliction
from your heart. But, said Chosroe, I fear Monzar
will not obey my orders, and he will suppose that
dismay has stricken us.

Be assured, O great King, said Mubidan, that
Monzar is terrified at your wrath and your vengeance,
and just now his Vizier Amroo, the son of
Nefeelah, came to me, and asked me to intercede
with you, and request you would pass over what
he has done, and forgive his improper conduct.
Well, said Chosroe, do what you think proper;
perhaps the difficulty may be removed. Order this
horseman into our presence, and promise him on
our part all manner of riches. So Mubidan departed,
and having acquainted the Vizier Amroo
with what had occurred on this important point,
[265]

he desired him to write to Monzar, and tell him
what had passed, ordering him to bring Antar into
the presence of the King at Modayin.

The Vizier wrote the letter, as followsââTo
him whom we acknowledge as King Monzar, King
of the Arabs, Ruler of the tribes Lakhm and
Juzam and Shiban! Know, O King, that the business
on which I came has been effected, and all your
projects are accomplished. Moreover, I have promised
Chosroe, the monarch of the world, that
Antar shall overcome this Grecian Chief, and shall
relieve his heart from his present distress and affliction;
come therefore hither without delay, and be
there no other answer to this letter but placing your
foot in the stirrup.ââHe folded and sealed the letter,
and dispatched it under the wings of a bird, and
they remained expecting the result. But the Chief,
as soon as the day dawned, sent some of his people
and horsemen to demand of Chosroe permission
to go out to the plain that he might again engage
in his presence his armies and his warriors. So
Chosroe mounted, and all his people and horsemen
also came forth: and the Greek overpowered
the heroes of Persia, who combatted with him even
to the close of the day, when they returned; and
the glory and honour of the Persians were tarnished.

The next day the two parties mounted and were
[266]

drawn up in order; and the Grecian fought, and
galloped, and charged, and sought for the combatants
and antagonists, when lo! a horseman from
Deelem, Bahram by name, the son of Johram, engaged
him, and he was a warrior rapid as a burning
flame, and he fought with different sorts of arms,
indefatigable in war. He was the son of the uncle of
that Khosrewan whom Antar had slain, Antar, the
destroyer of horsemen! On that day he fought on
the plain, and he wore a Davidean cuirass, solid
and firm, that blunted the javelinâs point, and in
his hand he bore a pike with which he gave the
blow of death. He was also girt with a cleaving
faulchion, and under his thighs were four short
javelins. He assaulted the Chief with all his force,
and engaged with him in the combat.

Their engagement at first was sport and play,
but it ended in impetuosity and fury. They
continued their labours and exertions till mid-day,
and the Greek having experienced Bahramâs might
and strength, at length put forth all his powers and
energies in the contest; and the pike of the Chief
was without a barb, as he had agreed on in the
presence of Chosroe Nushirvan. But he stretched
his hand over the pommel of his saddle, and plucked
out a barb like the tongue of a serpent and
fastened it on the end of his pike, and rushed
upon Bahram in his rage; he extended the barb
[267]

towards his chest, and he gave a loud shout; but
Bahram struck it with his sword and clipped it
off. The Greek threw away his pike, and drew
forth his sword from the scabbard, and they
engaged with their sabres till both were near partaking
of the draught of death. Then the ranks
closed upon them, and the Deelemites rejoiced in
their warrior, and their expectations were raised
high. The warriors ceased not the battle and the
contest till the end of the day, when they separated
unhurt; and neither had marked his adversary.
So they retired, and each related to his companions
the circumstances of the conflict. Chosroe sent for
Bahram and gave him a robe.

Early next day Chosroe mounted, attended by
the Persians, and Turcomans, and Deelemites, drawn
up in ranks on the plain of battle. The Grecian
Chief came with all his suite, and charged and
galloped over the plain. Bahram came down upon
him, and they dashed at each other and charged to
and fro, and ranged over the plain, extending their
long spears till every eye was sickened: then they
commenced the battle, and continued till sunset,
when they again separated unhurt. But Chosroe
was greatly distressed, and he ordered the Magi to
make a circuit of the fire in his presence, and to
throw aloe of Comorin into it, praising the unity of
the adored King: so they did as he ordered. And
the Chief performed the same ceremony, and his
[268]

priests and monks recited the Gospel, and marked
themselves with the Cross, and both parties reposed
in blasphemy and heresy.

The next day at dawn the horsemen were ready
for the contest, when lo! a dust arose and obscured
the land; and there appeared coming forth a
hundred horsemen, all sturdy Arabs, armed with
long spears and sharp swords, mounted on noble
coursers. King Monzar headed them, and by his
side was Antar. The Vizier and Mubidan went
out to meet them with a party of satraps and
horsemen, and the troops on all sides crowded to
look at them. Mubidan related to Antar all that
had passed between the Grecian and Bahrain.

O Vizier, said the lion Antar, assure the just
King, whose beneficence and liberality are well
known, that I will encounter this Grecian, and
Bahram, and all the warriors of Persia, Turkistan
and Deelem, and will not leave a man in Modayin.
Mubidan smiled, for he was convinced he could
execute what he said, observing the immensity of
his bulk, and the horror of his form, and the rolling
of his eyes, and the muscular powers of his
arms.

O Horseman of the age, said he, should you not
execute your engagement, and not slay this hero of
the Cross?âIf I do not fulfil my agreement, cried
Antar, drag me by my feet through the temple of
fire, and make a sacrifice of me. Mubidan smiled,
[269]

and he introduced him to the officers of Government
who wore golden bracelets on their arms, and afterwards
to those who wore crowns on their heads.
King Monzar dismounted, and all his horsemen, and
then entered the apartments of the Nobles, and the
Viziers, and Satraps, and Grandees, and Dignitaries.
Antar was in amazement at what he saw, and the
people also stared and gazed at him; and this continued
till they came before Chosroe. Monzar
stepped forward and saluted him, and prayed
for a continuance of his glory and power. Then
Antar too paid his homage, and thus spoke:

âMay God avert from thee the evils of fortune,
and maysât thou live secure from calamities!
May thy star be ever brilliant in progressive
prosperity, and increase in glory! May thy
sword be ever sharp, and cleave the necks of
thy foes, O thou King of the age! May thy
renown be ever celebrated in every land, for thou
art just and beneficent. So mayst thou ever live
a Sovereign in glory, as long as the dove pours
forth its plaintive note.â

Chosroe was astonished at Antarâs eloquence, and
was confounded at the height of his person, and
his prodigious form, and the rolling of his eyes,
and the strength of his arms. O King of the
world, said Mubidan, this is he who has slain your
satrap Khosrewan, and destroyed his army of
twenty thousand bridles, and he is come now to
[270]

take away the life of this Greek, and to remove
every grief and sorrow from your heart, and no
doubt he wilt slay all that are with him. Should
this be the case, said the Monarch, we will pardon
his fault, and ennoble him with gifts. Let them
repose: treat them with all kindness and hospitality.
And he sent for King Monzar, and gave him a robe.
O King of the Arabs, said he, the error was mine
at first, and his who raised this rebellion amongst
you; but the fire has destroyed him in your presence.
The heart of Monzar was delighted at these
words, and his joy was great.

And when Mubidan wished to pitch tents for
them that they might repose till the next dayâBy
the Holy Shrine, exclaimed Antar, I will not
eat meat with you, or drink wine with you, until I
have slain this foul-raced Greek, and made him
drink the cup of death: for he has moved the heart
of the just King. So he prepared his arms and
his cuirass, and sprang from the ground on the
back of his horse. Mubidan informed Chosroe of
what Antar had said, and he went forth with all
his Viziers, Satraps, Princes and Deputies, to see the
result of the combat between the two warriors.

Mubidan also repaired to the Grecian Chief, and
saidâKnow that Chosroe has in his justice acted
towards you with the greatest impartiality, and he
has loaded you with favours, and he has only found
amongst his people, Bahram, that can contend with
[271]

you; and the King observes even his inferiority.
But as he does not wish that his reputation should
be lost, his Vicegerent over the Arabs is arrived
this day, and with him a warrior selected from
the heroes of Arabia, who says he will meet you
and make your companions and comrades groan for
you. So prepare; and if you kill him or overcome
him, return to your master with all the property
you have brought with you.

Badhramoot was overjoyed at this; his bosom
swelled, and he was in extasy, and he saidâLet
Chosroe order out this angry horsemanâthis day
will I haste against him, and make him drink the
cup of disgrace. And Mubidan addedâLet the
persons of your faith bear witness for you. Antar
understood not what they were sayingâPrepare for
battle, he cried; and immediately the Greek let go
the bridle, and assailed Antar the son of Shedad.
Antar was like a furious lion, as he thus spoke:

âThis day I will aid King Monzar, and I will
exhibit my powers and my prowess before
Chosroe; I will break down the support of Greece
from its foundations, and I will sever Badhramootâs
head with my scimitar. I will exterminate
every lion hero with my sword: let him vaunt,
let him boast, let him scoff. Is it not known
that my power is sublime on high!âIs it not
among the stars in the vicinity of Jupiter? I
am he whose might is uncontroulable in battle.
[272]

I am of the race of Abs, the valiant lion of
the cavern. If thou art Badhramoot, I am
called Antar among men. It was easy for me to
vanquish the armies of Chosroe in the contest;
and soon will I overthrow CÃ¦sarâs self with my
spear. Hear the words of an intrepid lion, resolute,
undaunted, all-conquering. I am he of
whom warriors can bear witness in the combat
under the turbid battle-dust. My sword is my
companion in the night-shades, as are also my
Abjer, and my lance and my spear in the conflicts.
Night is my complexion, but day is my emblem;
the sun is unquestionably the mirror of my deeds.
This day thou shalt feel the truth of what I
have said: and I will prove that I am the PhÅnix
of the age.â

Then Antar rushed down upon the Grecian like
a cloud, and the Greek met him like a blazing fire.
They engaged like two lions; they maddened at
each other like two camels, and they dashed
against each other like two mountains, so that they
frightened every eye with their deeds. A dust
rose over them that hid them from the sight for
two hours. The Greek perceived in Antar something
beyond his capacity, and a sea where there
was no rest: he was terrified and agitated, and exclaimedâby
the Messiah and his disciples! this
biscuit is not of the same leavenâthis is the hour
of contention; and now is the time for struggle and
[273]

exertion. So he shouted and roared at Antar and
attacked him with his spike-pointed spear, and dealt
him a furious thrust; but Antar eluded it by a
dexterous movement, and struck him with the heel
of his lance under the arm, and made him totter on
the back of his horse; and he almost hurled him on
the ground: but Badramoot with infinite intrepidity,
sat firm on his horseâs back, and gallopped to the
further part of the plain. Antar waited patiently till
he had recovered, and his spirit was renewed, when
he returned upon him like a ferocious lion, and
recommenced the conflict.

King Monzar was highly gratified at the deeds
of Antar and felt convinced that he was only sparing
him, and dallying with him, and that had he
wished to kill him, he would have done it. But
the Monarch was perfectly astonished at Antarâs
courage; and turning to his attendants, said to
themâBy the essence of fire, this is indeed horsemanship
and intrepidity. Never have I remarked
such but in an Arab! And he advanced towards
the field of battle that he might observe what passed
between these dreadful combatants, and that
he might see how the affair would terminate.

Now Bahram, when he perceived that Antar was
superior to himself in strength, and was mightier than
the Greek in the conflict, felt assured that he would
obtain the promised reward; so he was seized with
the disease of envy, which preyed in flames upon
[274]

his heart and his body, particularly when he heard
that Antar had slain the son of his uncle; then he
resolved to betray Antar, and make him drink of
the cup of perdition. So he waited till both were
involved in dust, when he drew from under his
thigh a dart more deadly than the misfortunes of
the age; and when he came near Antar, he raised
his arm and aimed at him the blow of a powerful
hero. It started from his hand like a spark of fire;
but Antar was quick of mind, and his eyes were
continually turning to the right and to the left, for
he was amongst a nation that were not of his own
race, and that put him on his guard, and he instantly
perceived Bahram as he aimed his dart at him; and
then casting away his spear out of his hand, he caught
the dart in the air with his heaven-endowed force
and strength, and rushing at the Greek, and shouting
at him with a paralysing voice, he struck him
with that very dart in the chest, and it issued out
quivering like a flame through his back; then wheeling
round Abjer, like a frightful lion he turned down
upon Bahram; but Chosroe, terrified lest Antar
should slay Bahram, cried out to his attendantsâKeep
off Antar from Bahram, or he will kill him,
and pour down annihilation upon him. So the
warriors and the satraps hastened after the dreadful
Antar, and conducted him to Chosroe, and as the
foam burst from his lips, and his eye-balls flashed
fire, he dismounted from Abjer, and thus spoke:

[275]

âMay God perpetuate thy glory and happiness,
and mayst thou ever live in eternal bliss! O
thou King mighty in power, and the source of
justice on every occasion! I have left Badramoot
prostrate on the sandsâwallowing in blood.
At the thrust of my spear he fell dead, and his
flesh is the prey of the fowls of the air. I left
the gore spouting out from him like the stream
on the day of the copious rain. I am the
terrible warrior; renowned is my name, and I
protect my friend from every peril. Should
CÃ¦sar himself oppose thee, O King, and come
against theeâwith his countless host, I will leave
him dead with his companions. True and unvarnished
is this promise. O King, sublime in
honoursâillustrious and happy, thou art now
firm refuge, and my stay in every crisis. Be
kind then, and grant me leave to go to my
family, and to prepare for my departure: for my
anxiety, and my passion for the noble-minded,
brilliant-faced Ibla are intense. Hail for everâbe
at peaceâlive in everlasting prosperity, surrounded
by joys and pleasures!â

Chosroe again marvelled at his eloquence, and
clothed him with an imperial robe, and presented
him five Arab horses, with saddles of burnished gold,
studded with pearls and jewels. He then addressed
Mubidan, and saidâDeliver to this warrior all
that came with the Greek, whether merchandize or
[276]

beautiful maidens; and he knew no bounds to his
generosity, addingâBring him to me to-morrow that
I may exalt him with favours, and that I may make
him one of our Viceroys of the age. Do ye want any
thing further? cried he to the companions of the
Greek? Does any one wish for the combat and the
conflict? If so, let him hasten to the field of battle.

No more talk we of war and contention, said
they all; we only came to this country with the
Chief to be witnesses of this event and conflict;
and verily, O King of the age, we have experienced
every justice from you. So they departed, and
turned away their steeds, and traversed the plains
and deserts, hardly crediting their escape.

Chosroe repaired to his palace, and Mubidan had
charge of Antarâs affairs: he conducted him and
Monzar to the house of the Greek Chief, where
were the treasures and the presents. He opened
all the trunks, and presented to Aboolfawaris all the
pearls and the jewels and the precious stones.
Antar rejoiced and smiled, and exclaimedâO what
joy! where are thine eyes, O Ibla? but by the
faith of an Arab there is not in all the treasures of the
King, one atom of her, no not one grain. And as
he regarded the maidens of Greece and of Europe
and the Cophtian slave girls, his joy was increased,
and he blessed the termination of his expedition;
and he kissed Mubidanâs breast and beard, and he
praised him in these words:

[277]

âThou hast granted me favours, and I must
publish my gratitude; thou hast accomplished
my every wish for happiness. I will thank thee
as long as I live, and if I die, my bones in their
grave shall praise thee.â

Mubidan was truly gratified at Antarâs praises.
Renowned hero, said he, we do not mean that you
should be content with this small gift, for this
is not our property. You shall soon behold our
beneficence; this is the wealth and these the
jewels, the blue-eyed Greek, whom you killed and
made to drink of the cup of death and disgrace,
brought with him. But we would not have
consigned this most precious property, and these
maidens who resemble the constellations, but to one
who should vanquish and debase him: and verily,
you are the irresistible one, that has done that, and
the property becomes your property, and you have
obtained it by your actions. He then ordered the
slaves to spread carpets in a splendid mansion, and
to arrange the vases and ewers; and they did as
they were ordered; they laid out the dinner tables
before Monzar and Antar and their companions.
And when Antar observed the variety of delicious
meats, of mutton and pigeons and thrushes, and
the quantity of doves, and the profusion of sweatmeats,
he turned towards Monzar, and saidâMy
lord, are these various viands their usual victuals?
are they at all times accustomed to such luscious
[278]

things? for I see here no camelâs flesh. What art
thou talking of? cried Monzar; think no more of
the inhabitants of the wilds and deserts, and those
that drink camels milk night and day; habituate
thyself to the inhabitants of towns and cities, for
thou must live in the vicinity of great Kings.
So Antar ate till he was satisfied; the glasses
passed round, and they killed the jovial hours in
mirth and merriment: and when the female slaves
knew they were the property of Antar, they came
to offer their service, and whenever he got up or
sat down, they surrounded him: but he would not
take the least notice of them, for no one but Ibla
was in his heart.

O Aboolfawaris, said Monzar, thou dost not
delight in, or seem to look on thy slaves with
pleasure; or feel sensible of thy high dignity. Remove
all painful reflections, or thoughts of thine
own country, for thou hast risen to the rank of
princes; and were the Chieftains of thy nation to
see thee, how they would envy thee! Antar heard
this; he sighed from his sorrowing heart, and tears
flowed from his eyes. O my lord, said he, I swear
by your existence, all this grandeur has no value,
no charm in my eyes; love of my native land
is the fixed passion of my soul, and he thus
continued:

âThe fresh breeze comes in the morn, and when
it blows on me with its refreshing essence, it is
[279]

more grateful to me than all which my power has
obtained in nightly depredationsâthan all my
property and wealth. The realms of Chosroe I
would not covet, were the phantom of my love to
vanish from my sight. May the showers of rain
ever bedew the lands and mounds of Sheerebah!
lands, where the brilliancy of the veiled full
moons may be seen in the obscurity of their sable
ringletsâwhere my heart chases among them, a
damsel whose eyes are painted with antimony,
more lovely than the Houri. Thou mayst see
in her teeth a liquor when she smiles, where the
wine cup is studded with pearls. The fawn has
borrowed the magic of her eye, and it is the lion
of the earth that chases its prey for her beauty.
Lovely maidâdelicately formedâbeauteousâenchanting!
and at her charms is the brightness of
the moon abashed. O Ibla, the anguish of
absence is in my heartâthou mayst see the shafts
of death driven through my soul. O Ibla, did
not thy visionary form visit me by night, I should
pass the night in sorrows and restlessness. O
Ibla, how many calamities have I endured and
have plunged into them with my highly tempered
faulchion, whilst the charging steeds and undaunted
warriors dive into the ever perilous
ocean of death.â

Monzar was greatly surprised at Antarâs fluency
of speech, and the force of his love and passion, and
[280]

he began conversing with him about what occupied
his mind; and thus they continued till it was
dark, and sleep came upon them. So they passed
the night there. In the morning came Mubidan to
them, accompanied by a troop of slaves. He complimented
them, and enquired about their nightâs
rest, and how they were pleased. Mount your
horses, he continued, to go and compliment Chosroe,
for he is prepared to go out hunting and amuse himself.
As to me, said Antar, I have no other desire
but speedily to return to my family and my country,
that my friends and companions may see me, and
the Asafeer camels I have with me as a marriage
dower for my uncleâs daughter.

Mubidan smiled at these words, and knew his
wish and object. O Aboolfawaris, said he, your expectations
shall be gratified with respect to the Asafeer
camels, all laden, and many others besides; and
you shall not return to your native land, âere you receive
them all piled up with burthens. Antar expressed
his thanks, and with Monzar mounted, and they
all accompanied Mubidan, till on perceiving Nushirvan,
they instantly dismounted. Antar presented himself,
and attempted to kiss Chosroeâs feet in the stirrup,
but the King not only prevented him, but stooped
towards him and kissed him between the eyes;
and never had Nushirvan conferred such a mark of
distinction on any one but Antar, the destroyer of
heroes, on account of his having vanquished the
[281]

Greek warrior, and having removed distress and
affliction from his mind. He ordered some noble
Arab horses to be brought before Antar; and the
satraps delivered to him some of the finest breed, all
glittering with housings of burnished gold. Antar
mounted, and Chosroe kept him by his side and
treated him as a companion, and conversed with
him, and enquired about his nightâs rest, and his
love for his tribe and friends. They continued
their ride till they reached the hunting spot; but
no one entered that place except Nushirvan, when
he wished to hunt and amuse himself; and guards
were stationed over it on all sides, fearful that any
one should enter; and as it was filled in all quarters
and directions, the wild beasts and deer ran
away from before them; and as the horsemen
advanced, the birds took to flight from every part;
the warriors gallopped and the heroes raced their
steeds, and they spread abroad in all directions.

When Antar observed this sport, he urged on his
horse with the other riders, and pursued a herd of
deer with great eagerness, and at length overtook
them; he gallopped among them, and stretched
many of them on the plain, and he was much amused
and pleased. But whilst he was thus occupied,
behold an horseman pounced down upon him like
an eagle, and as he came up to him, he opened wide
his arm, and stretching himself out, struck Antar a
violent blow; it fell between his shoulders; it staggered
[282]

him, and almost laid him prostrate; but he
recovered himself; he was however tottering from
the back of his horse, whenâTake that, thou Hedjaz
dog! cried the villain; and if thou hast any
breath of life in thee, come on and fight, for I must
slay thee, thou vile black, as thou slewest my cousin
Khosrewan, and the Greek, and made them drink
of the cup of death and disgrace; and thou hast
obtained possession of all that property and those
beauteous slaves, and thou art exalted in the presence
of Chosroe.

Now this horseman was Bohram, the Chief of
Deelem. He conceived against Antar a deadly hatred
and envy, which consumed his heart and his body;
and when Chosroe ordered him not to get into any
disputes with Antar, warning him against his superior
powers, Bohram went to his own people,
and said to themâIf this slave depart in safety with
all his spoil and plunder, our honour will be debased
among the tribes of the Cross and the Priestâs
gown, and no one will have any respect for us.
From that time he indulged to such a degree his
envy against Antar, that he watched him till he
thus caught him alone in the hunt, and traitorously
assailed him. But he knew not that Antar was a
warrior, fixed as the mountainâs roots; and as he
still saw him firmly seated on his horse, he grasped
his sword and advanced at him; but Antar, recovering
from the violence of the blow, wheeled round his
[283]

horse and waited till he recognised his foe: then he
sought him as a bird of prey the weakest dove, and
his assault was the assault of the fiercest lion! and
thus he addressed him:

âThe Almighty has exposed thee to a lion
warrior, that thou mayest fall subdued by my
sword, O thou, sprung from the worshippers of the
sunbeams, and from those who adore the blazing
flames. Fate will repay thee, for it has devoted
thee to the fight with me, and to the horrors of
my strength. Despair; all thy hopes are frustrated,
founded on the crush of thy mace and the
warrior-yell. Thou art indeed like the moth,
that when it sees the flame, imagines its safety is
in its destruction. Stand firm then to the spear-thrust
of him whose force thou hast sought.
Thou wouldst insult a lion, powerful in every
combat. Take then the spear-thrust from the
hand of one to whom the dÃ¦mons of the desert
have bowed in submission, and from whom they
implore the aid of God.â

Then he came down on him like a cloud, and he
aimed a slight thrust at him with the heel of
his spear, and broke his ribs, and threw him from
the back of his horse the distance of two spearâs
lengths. The warriors of Deelem beheld the deed,
and thought he was dead and in a state of annihilation;
and they all rushed down upon Antar, crying
at him in their various dialects. But he met them
[284]

like a flash of lightning, and he began driving at them
and repulsing themâhis eye-balls turned red, they
appeared like crimson bloodâhe grasped his never
failing Dhami in his hand, resolved not to leave a
Deelemite alive. Just then came up Chosroe with
his visiers and satraps, and they cried out to the
Deelemites in Persian, for they had heard what
Bohram had done: and the Deelemites withdrew
from the combat, saying, this black slave has
brought disgrace upon us, and has slain our Chief!
âTis false, said Mubidan, ye foul wretches of Deelem,
your Chief is the aggressor; but he ought in duty
to have treated him kindly, and have waited on
him himself, for he has done for us what no human
being could do, and if he has slain your Chief, he
is not to blame.

Mubidan then requested Antar to advance, who
related all that had passed between him and Bohram;
and Chosroe believed his words, for he was
aware of the folly of his servant. He then ordered
his satraps to seize the Deelemites, and bring them
before him to strike off their heads. They seized
them all, and pinioned their shoulders and bound
their arms. But Antar, seeing Bohramâs attendants
thus disgraced, dismounted from Abjer, and advanced
towards the great King, and kissing the
earth before him, begged him to pardon them,
saying, O my lord; pardon is becoming in you, and
most suitable for such as youâhere I kiss your
[285]

noble hands, praying you to forgive them this
crime, for to-morrow I intend to return home: my
objects and wishes with respect to you are accomplished,
and I do not wish to be mentioned after
my departure, but for virtuous deeds; and let it
not be said of me, I went unto a tribe, and left it
in disgrace, and clothed with shame.

Chosroe admired Antarâs benevolence and generosity
of soul; he granted his request, and released
the Deelemites. At mid-day he returned from the
hunt, and repaired to a garden unequalled in any
city of the world, and in it was collected all that
the lip or the tongue can covet. It was a superb
palace, like a fairy pavilionâninety cubits in
length, and seventy cubits wide, built of marble
and red cornelian; in the centre was a fountain
filled with rose water and purest musk, in the
middle of it was a column of emerald, and on its
summit a hawk of burnished gold; its eyes were
topazes and its beak jasper; round it were various
birds, scattering from their bills upon Chosroe and
all that were present, musk and ambergris. The
whole edifice was scented with perfumes, and the
ceilings of the palace glittered with gold and silver.
It was one of the wonders of the period, and the
miracle of the age. When Antar entered, his
mind was bewildered at the pictures and colours he
saw, and he thus expressed himself.

âA Palaceâgreetings and peace be on itâTime
[286]

has spread its beauties over it. A Palaceâthe
roofs of cities might stand beneath its roof. On
it are the directions for the paths of virtue.
Strong are its columns, gilded are its walls;
mankind may glory in its magnificence. Over
its gates have jewels and pure unalloyed gold
disposed their honours; there is nothing further
to be desired. On it are the wonders of every
species of miracle; the senses are bewildered in
describing it; beautifully perfect is every elegant
device: nothing can exceed its excellence. And the
King shines above all Kings in his acts and his
justiceâMay days and years endure for him!â

At the upper end of the gardens there was
raised for Chosroe, a throne of burnished gold and
pillars of green emerald, and pedestals of silver that
sent forth refulgent rays in the darkest night.
Round it were stools of ivory and ebony inlaid with
brilliant gold. Chosroe seated himself on the
throne, and ordered Monzar and Antar to sit by
him: thus exalting him high above all that were
present. The attendants and suite also sat down;
every one took his place; and they were no sooner
arranged than the dinner tables were served with
various dainties, and a profusion of fruits and
sweatmeats. Chosroe advanced, and all that were
present, and partook of the repast. But Antarâs
eyes were in confusion. He sat down on his knees,
and bared his arms, chucking the things into his
[287]

mouth, but never moved his jaws: he gorged himself
like an hungry Arab, and roared like a wild
beast, to the great amazement of Chosroe, who
supplied him with every variety that was before
him: and Antar devoured them, as he asked Monzar
the name of each. So they brought him meats
of all kinds till he had crammed his stomach; then
raising his head up he thus spoke:

âHail, O King, whose bounties, in his age, stand
in lieu of the rain. O thou, the Kiblah
[6]
of
petitionersâO crown of gloryâO full moon of
this periodâO thou planet Saturn. O thou
whose seat is raised above PiscesâO thou the
refuge of all that sorrowâthy station is on high
far above the worldâit is a rain-cloud that
bestows its showers on mankind. When he fights,
all the world fear his assaults, as if a lion
were by his side. He is the seat of justice in his
ageâliberality and equity reign in his realms.
O ye dwellers in the land of Abs, I have received
from Chosroe and his munificence, what cannot be
described or enumeratedâno day can suffice to
detail an account of such goodness. The King
has attained the heights of virtue by his glory;
and happiness dwells in his palace. With him I
am firmly established in honour, and in his
gardens I have beheld a fountain whose waters
abound like his favors, and the liberality of his
[288]

palm. His garden contains every flower of every
species, and brilliant are their charms. The birds
in every note sing as if they were praising his
bounties to us. He is a King! whenever he
charges in the day of battle, the lions of the war
are astonished at his greatness, Victory is among
his companions, and glory and honour are his
friends. Amongst nations then will I speak my
gratitude for his favours, and I will engage the
horsemen on his side.â

When Antar had delighted the King by his eloquence,
the slaves presented him the wine, and
they poured him out wine that was like fire, and resembled
the rosy cheeks of a mistress, till the liquor
played with his wits, and refreshed all the pleasures
he had enjoyed. Antar looked upon this jovial
feast as a dream: for his heart and soul were at
home, and all his desires centered in Ibla. After
some time Chosroe addressed him, and asked him
questions, and joked and laughed with him, enquiring
about his country and its habitations. Antar
related all that had passed with his uncle Malik and
the tribe of Abs and so forth; and when the King
was certain that his affection for Ibla was unshaken,
and that his love could not possibly admit of increase;âI
am truly surprised, O Absian, said he, at your
forbearance and your reserve, your grievances being
of such a nature. O my lord, said Antar, I swear
by the existence of your munificence, that is unbounded,
and the liberality of your hands, that can
[289]

never be forgotten. I am a dead man among the
living! O Aboolfawaris, added Monzar, abandon
the expressions of ignorant Arabs, and recollect that
you are in a place, where decorum and civility are expected.
Fill your glass and drink, and listen to the
voice of the songstress who would soothe the afflicted;
and enjoy the happy hours. Ah! said Antar, how
delightful would be all you say, were my heart at
ease, and thus he exclaimed.

âWine cannot calm my heart, sickness will not
quit my bodyâmy eyelids are ever soreâtears
ever stream in torrents from them. The songstress
would soothe my heart with her voice; but
my love-sick heart loathes it. The remembrances
of Ibla draw off my mind from her song, and I
would say to my friend, this is all a dream. In
the land of Hedjaz are the tents of my tribe, and
to meet them again is forbidden me. Amongst
the tents of that people is a plump-hipped damsel
that never removes her veil, and under her veil
are eyes that inspire sickness, and the pupils of
her eyes strike with disease. Between her lips is
the purest musk, and camphor diluted with wine.
My love and madness are dear to me, for to him
who loves, sweet is the pang of love. O daughter
of Malik, let my foes triumph in my absence;
let them watch or sleep. But in my journey I
have encountered events that would turn children
gray in their cradles. Pleasures have succeeded
[290]

to difficulties, and I have met a monarch whom
no words can describeâa King to whom all the
creation is a slave, and to whom fortune is a vassal,
whose hand distributes bounties, so that I
know not whether it is the sea or a cloud. The
sun has invested him with a crown, so that the
world need not fear darkness. The stars are his
jewels, in which there is a moon brilliant and luminous,
as at its full. Mankind is corporeal, and he
is spiritual. Let every joint and every member
laud his name. Live for ever, Prince of the
horsemen, long as the dove pours its plaintive
note, live for ever!â

Chosroe was greatly pleased and surprised at
these verses, for he was himself eloquent in the
Arabian dialect. Were I to give you my kingdom,
O Absian, said he, it would be a small gift in comparison
with your deserts, for what I can grant is
but transitory, like all other things; but your commendations
will endure for ages. Oblige me, and
demand of me what may gratify you, that I may at
any rate make you some compensation for your
praises. Indeed, said Antar, I have fallen by your
bounty into a sea that has neither length nor breadth,
and I shall not return but with what will raise my
glory amongst my countrymen; but I really do wish
my uncleâs daughter, Ibla, had on her head a tiara
like this, for it would set her off finely; but I know
it is very ill-bred in me to make such a request.

[291]

Chosroe laughed and smiled at Antarâs remark;
he spoke to one of his satraps, who rose up, and
in a short time returned, and with him were four
slaves bearing a canopy of silver; on the top of it
was a hawk formed of burnished gold, its eyes were
of topazes and its feet emeralds. This canopy,
Aboolfawaris, shall serve your uncleâs daughter to
sit in on the night of her marriage with you, and in
this tiara shall she be wedded to you; and he took
the tiara from his head, and untying his girdle and
mantle and his coronet, he laid them down in the
pavilion, desiring Antar to accept them all. Antar
advanced towards the King, kissed his hands, and
thus addressed him:

âO King of the universe, I thank thee for the
vast gifts thou hast bestowed upon me; thou hast
granted me favors I cannot bear; thou art the
most beneficent of all that tread the earth! thou
art the man to whom all Kings bow in the day of
battle; every Arab and every Persian. But thy
slave still lives in the agony he endures from his
love, his weakness, and his passion. He lives far
from his friends, for whom he thirsts; and languishing
for Ibla, he lives restless in torments.â

The Kingâs astonishment increased. Absian, said
he, oblige me by demanding what more you want;
I request of you, said Antar, the renewal of the appointment
of King Monzar. I will do it, Antar,
said Chosroe; and he directed it to be written
[292]

throughout the imperial dominions, that Monzar
should not be removed from his government of Massema,
and had he even a blind daughter, she should
be the ruler thereof. Have you any other want,
said he, delivering the letter to Antar. I have no
other wish, said Antar, but to return to my country
and home.

When those that envied and hated Antar among
the Persians, on account of the presents and honours
he had received, saw this, they conspired to destroy
him, and carry off his property. Now Chosroe
had a famous wrestler, called Rostam, and he was
celebrated for his pugilistic skill through various
realms and cities. Antarâs enemies went to him in
order to instigate him against Antar, sayingâKnow,
most expert of men, that this insignificant worthless
black slave has received Chosroeâs tiara, and immense
wealth, and is returning with it to his own
country. Rostam sprang up like a lion, and presenting
himself to the King without asking permission,
kissed the groundâO great King, said
he, if you have any consideration for me, let not a
slave of the desert be more dignified than I am. You
have made him one of your associates. I am the
pugilist of your throne, and therefore let not that
head be raised above me.

Antar heard and saw, but understood not what
was passing. Rostam, said Chosroe, abandon this
envious disposition, or thou wilt die of anguish. I
[293]

wish, said Rostam, he would present himself before
you, and then I will prove to you he is not worthy
your esteem. I will slay him with this mace, and
will unite him to the tribes of Aad and Themood.

On hearing this the King was greatly vexed.
Do you comprehend, said he to Antar, what he
says, Aboolfawaris? I have not understood what he
said, but I can perceive that he is very jealous, and
that his head is like the head of a camel, said Antar.
Let me hear what he wants, that I may comply with
his request. This man is my wrestler, said Chosroe,
and is come to try his strength with you in wrestling,
and prove your powers in the combat. Is he not
one of your warriors, asked Antar, and those with
him are they not your men? Yes, said Chosroe.
I forbade his interference with you, but he will not
be dissuaded. Well, said Antar, I cannot allow my
arm to be extended to his injury, and my heart
will not allow me to hurt him on account of your
bounty and favour, and great kindness towards me:
not that this unwillingness on my part originates
in fear, or in any inferiority to him; but that the
Arabs should hear of me, and accuse me of making
troubles and dissensions; nor that the noble
Arabs may say of me that Antar, the son of Shedad,
presented himself to Chosroe, and partook of his
food, and then slew his subjects in his presence.
Aboolfawaris, said the King, much agitated, if you
wrestle with him, will you kill him? Yes, said
[294]

Antar, for he only seeks to wrestle with me, that he
may destroy me; and you know, O King, that
wrestling is one species of warfare; and justice and
propriety are required in it! and if one antagonist
prevails over the other antagonist, he abuses and
reviles him, but should his antagonist be angry at
him, he kills him.

Listen to me, said Chosroe to Rostam; do not
provoke this man. I fear for you, lest he overcome
you, and if you do not behave properly to him, he
will tear out your life from between your ribs. I
must wrestle with him, said Rostam; if he kills me,
let my blood and property be his, and esteemed
duly won among these warriors. Strip off your
clothes then, said Chosroe, his countenance inflamed
with wrath, and prepare for the combat. I will tell
him that he may engage with you, and that your
blood will be fairly his. So Rostam took off his
garments, and was stripped from his shoulders, that
were harder than a rock, and his twisted arms were
like columns.

Arise Aboolfawaris, said the King, and wrestle
with him, and if he plays the fool with you, slay
him, and hasten his death, and mind not the consequences;
you are not answerable for his blood.

Antar sprang on his legs, and threw about his arms
and twisted his skirts about his waistband; and as
he was about to begin, Aboolfawaris, said Chosroe,
you have not stripped, or put on the short breeches,
as every pugilist does. By your existence, O King
[295]

of the age, replied Antar, I never in my life wrestled
with short breeches, and never will I wrestle but in
the clothes of a horseman. Chosroe was greatly
troubled. By the burning of fire, he exclaimed,
Never, in the course of my life, have I seen a man
wrestle as a horseman, without breeches. To day,
said Antar, you shall see what I will do with Rostam
in the presence of these warriors.

Antar went up to Rostam. Rostam bent himself
like an arch, and appeared like a burning flame. He
rushed upon Antar with all his force, for he looked
on him as a common man, and he did not know that
Antar, even in his youth, used to wrestle with he
and she camels in the plains and the rocks. They
grasped each other with their hands, they butted with
their heads, they assaulted with their whole might,
like two lions or two elephants. Then Rostam
stretched out his hand at Antarâs waistband, and
clung to it, and attempted to lift him up in his arms,
but he found him like a stone fixed in a tower, and
he tottered before him. Then he repented of what
he had done, and of having provoked Antar. He
slackened his hold, and he ran round him for an hour,
in the presence of Chosroe and his attendants. He
then sprang behind him, and thrust his head between
his legs, and attempted to raise him on the back of
his neck, and to dash him on the ground; but Antar
knew what were his intentions and his secret designs:
so he closed his knees on Rostamâs neck, and almost
[296]

made his eye-balls start from their sockets, and nearly
deprived him of life. Rostam was terrified, and
wished to escape from between his legs, but he could
not; every attempt failed; Antar was like a block
of stone growing on a desert or a mountain. Antar
siezed him by his breeches, and clung to him, and
raised him up in his hands like a sparrow in the
claws of a bird of prey, and walked away with him
among the multitude, wishing to wrestle quietly
before the King. But Rostam, when he saw his
life was in Antarâs hands, like a young child was
abashed and mortified before the warriors and satraps,
and the great King. He clenched his fist, and
struck Antar on the ear. Antar soon recovered
from the blowâhe returned to the threshold of the
palace, and dashed him on the ground, and smashed
him to atoms. Then presenting himself to Chosroe
he thus spoke.

âDeath has resolved he should die slain, and
should be subdued and disgraced by me. Curses
on his hands! It was his arrogant folly that
pointed out the road by which he should be
destroyed. Had thy eyes beheld my deeds in
the combat, where the spears tears the hands of
the lancers, thou wouldst have feared for the
extinction of his days when he outraged me in
this lengthened action. O King, who has enjoyed
every glory, listen to my story and the
account of my honours. He sought in every
[297]

way to increase his fame by his deeds; so I left
him after that reduced to infamy. Truly he
hastened the time of his own fate, and his destiny
was at my disposal. God ordained his death for
his acts, and determined it should be executed by
my hand. Hail, then, O King! live for ever in
protected happiness that may never fail thee.â

Then was Nushirvan quite confounded at his
powers. O King, said Antar, I swear by the two
eyes of Ibla (to me the most sacred of oaths), that
when I raised him on my Hands, my only intention
was to bring him before you and wrestle in your
presence: but as he transgressed the fair laws of
battle, there was nothing for him but death.
Chosroe believed what he said, and ordered Rostamâs
property to be confiscated, and to be transferred
to Antar, and he gave him a written
assignment of his possessions and fiefs.

And when the day was spent, Monzar hemmed
the signal for rising: Antar got up, and asked
Chosroeâs permission to commence his journey:
the order being given for his being supplied with
the finest steeds, and all their golden accoutrements
and rich housings. They went to the house that
was set apart for them; where Antar found treasures
of wealth, and horses and mules, and he and she
camels, and other goods no words can tell. Antar
asked whence they came: Aboolfawaris, said Monzar,
this is the property of Rostam: and they reposed
[298]

till morning; when Mubidan came and complimented
them, and as he was going with them to
Nushirvan, I wish, my lord, said Antar to the
Vizier, that you would introduce me to the temples
of fire.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

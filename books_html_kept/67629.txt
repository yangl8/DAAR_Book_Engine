PREFACE.

This Dictionary was commenced as an amended edition of that written
by M. Ernest Bosc, architect of Paris, and contains the 450 engravings published
in the French work, to which about 250 more have been added. Little
or nothing, however, of the text of M. Boscâs work has been left standing; his
definitions having, in the process of revision under reference to original works,
almost entirely disappeared. The whole work, as it now stands, has been
drawn from, or carefully corrected by, the best authorities in each of its special
branches. Considerable prominence has been given to
Architecture
, from
the French original corrected from English writers; to
Christian Antiquities

from
Martigny
, and the Dictionary of
Dr. Smith and Professor
Cheetham
, and other authorities; to
MediÃ¦val Armour
, and terms of

Chivalry
, chiefly from
Meyrickâs Ancient Armour
; to
Costume
from
PlanchÃ©

and
Fairholt
; to
Heraldry
from
Boutellâs
and
Mrs. Bury Palliserâs
works;
to
Pottery
, the substance of the articles on this subject being derived from

M. Jacquemartâs
work; to
Needlework
,
Ivories
,
Musical Instruments
,

Goldsmithsâ Work
,
Paintersâ Materials and Processes Ancient and
Modern
,
Colour
, &c., with references to the several authorities referred to.

The
Greek and Roman Antiquities
, which are the principal part of M.
Boscâs work, have been in this volume reduced to the smallest possible compass:
the Dictionaries of Dr. Smith and Rich must be referred to by those who
require fuller definitions upon this subject, which would of itself fill ten such
books as the present.

A few
Indian
,
Chinese
, and
Japanese Terms
, which have come into
ordinary use in art, have been sought out and inserted: in the first-mentioned

viii
Dr. Birdwoodâs Handbooks
have been a most useful guide. Finally, it is
necessary to state, that many words essential to the completeness of the work
would have been in danger of omission, if I had not had before me
Mr.
Fairholtâs
admirable
Dictionary of Art Terms
, which, occupying a more restricted
ground than this, is so thorough and accurate in dealing with all that it professes
to include, that the only
raison dâÃªtre
of this work is the very much wider and
different ground that it covers, and the greater condensation of its definitions.
Obviously the substance of every statement in the work is borrowed from some
previous writer on the subject, and it is evident that a Dictionary of Reference
is not a convenient vehicle for theory or invention.

The appended list of
Classified Catalogues
which have been prepared
by direction of the authorities of the South Kensington Museum, will have the
additional use of referring the reader to the fountain-head at which he can
verify and amplify the condensed information that this work supplies.

Aar
or
Aarou
, Egyp. A plain in a supra-terrestrial
region, which corresponded, with the
Egyptians, to the Elysian Fields of the Greeks
and the Asgard of Scandinavian mythology.

Fig. 1. Abaculi used as pavement.

Abaculus
, Gr. and R. (a diminutive of
abacus
,
q.v.). A small square or cube of glass, or some
vitreous composition made to imitate stone or
glass of various colours.
Abaculi
were employed
for the inlaid-work of pavements, or the incrustations
of mosaic.

Abacus
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î²Î±Î¾
, a slab or board).
1. In general a rectangular slab of stone, marble,
or terra-cotta. 2. A board or tray used in arithmetical
calculations, and constructed for reckoning
by tens. 3. A play-board divided into
compartments, a kind of backgammon in use in
antiquity. The same term was also applied to
a board used for another game of skill, the
ludus
latrunculorum
, which was more like our chess.
4. A side-board on which were displayed, in the

triclinium
, or dining-room, silver plate and other
table utensils. 5. A slab of marble, used for a
coating in the decoration of a room or apartment
of any kind. 6. A square slab of terra-cotta or
wood, placed by the earliest builders at the top
of wooden columns, in order to give them a
broader head, and so afford a better support to
the beams which rested on them. It was this
motive that gave rise to the formation of the

abacus of the capital of a column
.

Abaton
or
Abatos
, Gr. (
Î±, Î²á¾°Ïá½¸Ï
, inaccessible).
A term used generally to denote any inaccessible
place, such as the
cella
of a temple, an adytum
from which the profane were excluded. The
term
Abaton
denoted more particularly a building
in the city of Rhodes, which contained,
together with two statues in bronze, a trophy
commemorating a victory gained over the
Rhodians. This memorial had been placed in
the building by queen Artemisia, who had consecrated
it to a divinity. To destroy it would
have been a sacrilege, and as no one could be
allowed to penetrate into the interior of the

Abaton
, without the defeat of the Rhodians
becoming known, all access to it was forbidden.

Abezzo, Olio di
, It. Strasburg Turpentine
(q.v.).

Fig. 2. Ewer for ablutions (Persian).

Ablutions
, Chr. There were various ablutions:
that of the head (
capitilavium
), as a
preparation for unction in baptism; that of the
hands (
aquamanile
), during Mass, &c.; that of
the feet (
pedilavium
), including the ceremony
of washing the feet of the poor, performed on
Maundy Thursday, by the Pope. (Fig.
2
.)

Abococke
, Med. Cap of estate, worn by kings
on their helmets: âa huge cappe of estate, called
Abococke, garnished with two rich crownes;â
15th century.

Fig. 3. A Lictor with the fasces, wearing the
abolla
.

Abolla
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î½Î±Î²Î¿Î»á½´
, a throwing back
and around). A cloak made of a piece of cloth
folded double and fastened round the throat by a
brooch.
Abolla major
was the name given to
the ample blanket in which the Greek philosophers
were accustomed to wrap themselves.
This cloak was adopted by the philosophers as
an instance of their humility, because it was
mostly worn by the poorer classes at Rome. Fig.
3

is a representation of one of the lictors, with
his fasces on his shoulder, and wearing the
abolla
.

Abraxas
, Gr. (a mystical or cabalistic word
formed of the Greek letters
Î±, Î², Ï, Î±, Î¾, Î±, Ï
).
Cut stones or gems of very various shapes, upon
which are engraved the words Abraxas, Abrasax.
They are also known as
Basilidian
stones or
gems, because they constituted the symbols of
the gnostic sect of the Basilidians. Certain
peoples looked upon them as magic amulets
against particular maladies and demoniacal
influences. The impressions on these stones are
very varied; cabalistic figures, the signs
Î
and
Î©
,
and the word
ÎÎÎ©
, which designates the Supreme
Being. Numerous explanations have been
sought for this term
abraxas
; some philologists
assert that it comes from the Persian [or Pehlvi],
and that it signifies
Mithra
; others derive it from
the Hebrew, or the Coptic, while others again
recognize in it only a numerical sign, the letters
of which, added together, would give the number
365, or the number of days that make up the
year, and in this case
abraxas
would symbolize
the annual revolution of the sun. A figure
often found upon Abraxas stones is that of a
serpent with a radiated lionâs head (Chnouphis),
which rears itself amid seven stars. The reverse
of these stones often bears the inscription
Î¤Î©
Î§ÎÎÎ¥Î¦Î
, âTo Chnouphis.â

Absidiole.
Diminutive of
apse
, and thus used
to denote a small apse terminating a lateral nave,
while the apse closes the central or chief nave.
(See
Absis
.)

Absis
or
Apse
, R. (
á¼Ïá½¶Ï
, a bow or vault). Any
enclosure of semicircular form terminating a
room, hall, &c. There was an
absis
in the

Basilica
(q.v.), or court of justice, and it was in
the semicircular recess thus formed that the
judgesâ seats were placed. Many temples also
had an
absis
attached to them, and there is one
in particular of this description well known to all
archÃ¦ologists. This is the
absis
of the temple
of Venus at Rome, which was built by the
emperor architect Hadrian. (See
Apse
.)

Abutment
, Arch. called also
Impost
. The
solid part of a pier from which an arch immediately
springs.

Abydos, Tablets of
, Egyp. Under this term
are designated two hieroglyphic inscriptions containing
the names of Egyptian kings. These
tablets were graven upon the walls of a
cella
in
a small temple at Abydos, in Upper Egypt;
hence their name. The first tablet, the beginning
of which was destroyed at the time of its
discovery, contains the names of the kings of the
twelfth and eighteenth dynasties; this inscription
was discovered in 1817 or 1818 by J. W. Bankes,
and drawn by Caillund in 1832; it had been
taken down from the wall of the temple by
Mimaut, the French consul at Alexandria. It is
now at the British Museum. The second tablet,
which begins with Menes, who is generally supposed
to have been one of the first kings of Egypt,
contains a complete list of the two first dynasties,
as well as a great number of names belonging to
kings of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, ninth,
tenth, and eleventh dynasties. This tablet was
discovered in 1864 by M. Mariette. It is reproduced
in De RougÃ©âs treatise on the six first
dynasties.

Abyssus
, Egyp. A Coptic word, read by
some archÃ¦ologists as
Noun
(q.v.), and which
signifies the
abyss
, the immensity of the celestial
waters upon which sails the solar bark.

Acacia
, R. A term employed by some antiquaries
to denote an object held in the hand of
the statue of an emperor of the Lower Empire.
It usually consists of a piece of cloth, which
the emperor unfurled as a signal for the games to
commence.

Academies of Italy.
Literary societies established
during the middle ages. The principal
were the Accesi, Affidati, Amorevole of Verona,
Animosi of Milan, Arcadi of Rome, Ardenti of Pisa,
Ardenti of Naples, Ardenti of Viterbo, Catenati
of Macerata, Chiave of Pavia, Crusca of Florence,
Elevati of Ferrara, Eterea of Padua, Florimontana
of Annecy, Granelleschi of Venice, Infiammati
of Padua, Infocati, Insensati of Perugia,
Intronati of Siena, Lincei of Rome, Occulti,
Offuscati, Ostinati, Rinovati, Sonnachiosi of
Bologna, Trasformati of Milan, Travagliati,
Unanimi. Their devices are described under
the respective headings.

AcÃ¦na
, Gr. (
á¼ÎºÎ±á½·Î½Î·
), a measuring-rod; ten
Greek feet in length.

Fig. 4. Architectural acanthus.

Acanthus
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Îºá½´
a point, and

á¼Î½Î¸Î¿Ï
, a flower). A plant, the ornamental
foliage of which has been largely employed as
an architectural decoration by different peoples.
The acanthus has been applied to the ornamentation
of friezes, cornices, modillions, and
various other members
of architecture,
but in especial to
the decoration of modillions
(projecting
brackets) (Fig.
4
) and
of Corinthian and
composite capitals.
There are several
varieties of the acanthus;
those most in
use are the cultivated
acanthus, or Brankursine
(
Acanthus mollis
), and the spring acanthus
(
Acanthus spinosa
), the foliage of which is
much less beautiful, and furnished with small
spikes which make the plant resemble a thistle.
This last has also often been applied to decoration,
in the Romano-Byzantine and lanceolated
styles of architecture. An English name for
this ornament is the âbearâs claw.â

Fig. 5. Bracket decorated with acanthus.

Acapna
, Gr. (
Î±
, priv., and
ÎºÎ±ÏÎ½á½¸Ï
, i. e. without
smoke). Wood for fuel, which had undergone
several operations to hinder it from smoking
when put on the fire. One of the methods
employed consisted in stripping the bough of the
bark, immersing it in water for some days, and
then leaving it to dry. In a second method,
the surface was rubbed with oil or oil-lees, or
else the piece of wood was plunged into the oil
for a few moments. A third method consisted
in slightly charring the surface of the wood by
passing it through the flame. The wood prepared
by this last process was also called
cocta

and
coctilia
.

Acatium
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Îºá½±ÏÎ¹Î¿Î½
, dimin. of
á¼ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï
,
a light boat). A description of vessel belonging
to the class called
actuariÃ¦
, i. e. were propelled
either by sails or oars. The
acatium
was a fast-sailer
much employed by the Greek pirates.
The stern was of a rounded concave form (
inflexa
),
and the prow was adorned with a beak
(
rostrum
). (See also
ActuariÃ¦
.) The name

acatium
was also given to a drinking-vessel
which was in the form of a boat. The Roman

scapha
was a similar vessel.

Acca.
A word used in the 14th century for
a cloth of gold shot with coloured silk, figured
with animals: from Acre in Syria.

Accesi
, It. (
inflamed
). One of the Italian
Literary Academies. Their device was a fir-cone
placed over a fire, with the motto âhinc odor et
fructus.â

Accetta
, Med. Lat. A battle-axe, or hache-dâarmes.

Accidental
or
complementary colour
, the
prismatic complement of a ray of light: such are

orange
to
blue
,
green
to
red
, and
purple
to
yellow
.

Accidental light.
An effect of light in a
picture independent of the principal light, such
as that on the Holy Child in the
Notte
of Correggio,
or that of a candle, &c.

Acclamations
, Chr. Formulas employed by
the first Christians to express their grief on the
occurrence of some misfortune, or on the other
hand, to testify their joy at some piece of good
fortune. These acclamations were imitated from
the nations of antiquity [e. g. at
marriages
, âIo
Hymen, HymenÃ¦e, Talassio:â at
triumphs
,
âIo, triumphe,â &c.].

AccollÃ©e
, Her. (1) placed side by side: (2)
entwined about the neck.

Accosted
, Her. Side by side.

Accrued
, Her. Grown to maturity.

Accubitum
, R. (
ad
and
cubitum
, an elbow).
A bed or rather couch of a peculiar kind, upon
which the Romans reclined at meals, and which
replaced the
lectus triclinarius
. It was a kind
of sofa holding only a single person, while the

lectus triclinarius
held two or three. The act of
reclining on this sofa was called
accubitio
or

accubitus
, a term derived from
accubo
, to recline
at table.

Acerra
or
Acerna
, R. (prob. from
acer
, maple).
A small square box with a hinged lid; a coffer
used to hold the incense for sacrifices; whence
its Latin names
arca turalis
,
arcula turalis
,
acerra
turis custos
. The
acerra
appears on certain bas-reliefs
among the sacred utensils. It is to be
seen represented on the altar of the small temple
of Quirinus, at Pompeii, underneath a garland,
and above an augurâs wand. It is generally met
with, as being carried by the officiating priests,
at religious ceremonies. The attendant carried
the
acerra
in the left hand and employed the
right hand to sprinkle the incense on the flame
of the altar; whence the expression
libare acerra
.
The term
acerra
was also used to denote a small
portable altar placed before the dead, on
which incense was burnt during the time the
corpse was exposed to view (
collocatio
). The
altar was also named, from this circumstance,

ara turicrema
.

Acetabula
, R. A kind of bronze cymbals,
attached to the hands and feet, as also to the
knees. The same name was also given to silver
cymbals which were played by striking them
with a stick of hard wood.

Acetabulum
, R. (from
acetum
, vinegar). A
cup for vinegar used by the Romans at meals.

The
acetabulum
was also a goblet used by
jugglers among the Greeks and Romans to make
nutmegs disappear. By the latter these jugglers
were called
prÃ¦stigiatores
, by the former
ÏÎ·ÏÎ¿ÎºÎ»á½³ÏÏÎ±Î¹

or
ÏÎ·ÏÎ¿ÏÎ±á½·ÎºÏÎ±Î¹
. Lastly, we find in
Pliny the Elder that
acetabulum
was the name
given to a dry measure of capacity, equal to the
quarter of a
hemina
or the half of the
quartarius
,
and equivalent to .1238 of a pint. [The Greek

Oxybaphon
.]

Acha
,
Achia
,
Hachia
, Lat. A battle-axe.

Achelor
,
Achlere
or
Ashlar
. (Arch.) Hewn
stone.

Achromatic
, Gr. (
Î±
priv.
ÏÏÎ¿Î¼Î¿Ï
, colour).
The effect of an arrangement of lenses by which
a coloured ray of light is rendered colourless.

Acicula
, Gr. (dimin. of
acus
, a needle or
pin). In particular a bodkin used by the Roman
ladies to keep the hair in its place when curled
or plaited, and to keep on false hair. The words

acicula
and
acus
are however all but synonymous.
The former does not denote a bodkin of smaller
size than the
acus
, but an object made of an
inferior material; the
acus
being of silver, ivory
or gold, while the
acicula
was simply of bone or
some hard wood such as box, myrtle, olive, &c.

Fig. 6. Acinaces.

Acinaces
, Orient. (
á¼ÎºÎ¹Î½á½±ÎºÎ·Ï
; orig. a Persian
word). A straight poniard resembling a very
short Roman sword, used by the Eastern
nations of antiquity, especially, the Medes,
Persians and Scythians. It was worn by
soldiers suspended from a belt round the waist,
but the weapon hung either at the right or the
left side, according to the nationality and
accoutrements of the soldier. When, however,
he wore a sword, this was always placed at the
left, and the
acinaces
at the right side of the
body. The handles of these weapons are generally
extremely rich.

Acisculus
, R. (Diminutive of
ascia
, an adze
= a small adze). A small pick employed by
stone-cutters and masons in early times. Representations
of it may be seen pretty frequently
on medals, in especial those of the Valerian
family. [See
Ascia
.]

Acketon
, Fr. A quilted leathern jacket, worn
under the armour, introduced from the East by
the Crusaders.

Aclis
or
Aclyx
, R. A sort of harpoon, consisting
of a thick short stock set with spikes.
This massive weapon was chiefly employed by
foreign nations, but not by the Romans. It was
launched against the enemy, and drawn back by
means of a cord to which it was attached, to be
launched a second time. This weapon bears
some resemblance to a particular kind of
angon

(or trident). (See
Angones
.)

Acoustic Vases
, R. (Gr.
á¼ÎºÎ¿Ï
ÏÏÎ¹Îºá½¸Ï
, pertaining
to the sense of hearing). Vases of earthenware
or more often of bronze, which, in the theatres
of antiquity, served the purpose of strengthening
the voices of the actors. Vases of this kind
would also seem to have been employed for the
same purpose during the middle ages, for the
architect Oberlin, when repairing the vault of
the choir, in the ancient church of the Dominicans
at Strasburg, discovered some acoustic vases
there.

Fig. 7. Acratophorum, Roman.

Acratophorum
, Gr. and R. (
á¼ÎºÏÎ±ÏÎ¿-Ïá½¹ÏÎ¿Ï
,
holding unmixed wine). A table vessel for
holding pure wine, while the crater (
ÎºÏÎ±Ïá½´Ï
), on
the other hand, contained wine mixed with
water. These vessels were often dedicated to
Bacchus. They were made in earthenware and
metal, but those that were dedicated to the gods
were of gold and silver, and had their place
among the treasures of the temples. Fig.
7
represents
a silver acratophorum found at Hildesheim.

Acrolith
, Gr. (
á¼ÎºÏÎ¿Î½
, end, and
Î»á½·Î¸Î¿Ï
stone).
A statue covered with garments which in many
cases were gilded. The extremities of these
statues were of marble or stoneâwhence their
nameâmore rarely of gold and ivory. The
Minerva of Areia, at PlatÃ¦a in BÅotia, described
by Pausanius, was an
acrolith
. This
was by Pheidias. The
acrolith
period is the
infancy of the Greek plastic art.

Acropodium
, Gr. (
á¼ÎºÏÎ¿Î½
, end or point; and

Ïá½¹Î´Î¹Î¿Î½
, a foot). A low square plinth serving for
basement to a statue and often forming part of it.

Acropolis
, Gr. (
á¼ÎºÏá½¹-ÏÎ¿Î»Î¹Ï
, upper or higher
city). From its primary meaning the term came
to signify a fortified city. They were very
numerous, in ancient times, in Italy, Greece
and the colonies of Asia Minor. Most ancient
Greek cities were built upon hills, and the citadel
on the summit of the hill was called the
acropolis
.

Acrostic
, Chr. (
á¼ÎºÏÎ¿Î½
, end, and
ÏÏá½·ÏÎ¿Ï
, a row
or line). A combination of letters formed out of
some word, which is thus made to express a
thought differing from its own meaning. For
instance, the Greek word
ÎÎ§ÎÎ¥Î£
(ICHTHUS,
fish), symbolizes, in the primitive church, the
name of Christ. The following is the acrostic
of this word:
ÎÎ·ÏÎ¿Ï
Ï, Î§ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿Ï, ÎÎµÎ¿Ï
, Î¥á¼±Î¿Ï, Î£ÏÏÎ·Ï

I, CH, TH, U, S.

Fig. 8. Roman acrostolium.

Acrostolium
, Gr. and R. (
á¼ÎºÏÎ¿ÏÏá½¹Î»Î¹Î¿Î½
,
extremity of beak of a ship). An ornament
employed by the ancients to decorate the upper
extremity of the prows of ships. This ornament
often figured among trophies, since it was the
custom for the victor in a naval combat to take
the
acrostolia
from the captured ships. It is
frequently to be met with on the bas-reliefs of
triumphal monuments. Fig.
8
shows an
acrostolium

taken from a bas-relief in the Museum of
the Capitol. The object seen projecting from
the acrostolium is a sounding lead.

Acroterium
, Gr. and R. (
á¼ÎºÏÏÏá½µÏÎ¹Î¿Î½
, the
extremity of anything). In a signification more
restricted than the primary one, yet generally admitted,
the term
acroteria
is applied to the plain
socles and pedestals placed at the summit of
buildings to support statues, groups, or other
crownings.
Acroterium
was the common name
for the
acrostolium
, and the taking of it away as
a trophy was called
acroteriazein
.

Actia
, Gr., festivals held every fourth year,
at Actium, in Epirus, in honour of Apollo.

Actinic
(rays of light:) chemically active.

ActuariÃ¦
, R. (See
Naves
). Open boats, built
to attain a high degree of speed, propelled
by sails and sweeps, and never fitted with less
than eighteen oars. Pirates used this class of
vessel exclusively.

Actuarii
, R. The shorthand writers who took
down speeches in the senate. Also certain officials
who answered to our commissariat officers.

Acuminated
, Arch. Finishing in a point, like
a lofty Gothic roof.

Acus
, R. (Gr.
á¼Îºá½´
, a point). A bodkin,
needle, or pin. The
acus
denoted both a needle
for sewing and a pin for fastening anything.
When used for the hair it was called
acus
crinalis
or
comatoria
. In Christian archÃ¦ology
the word applies to the jewelled pins used as
fastenings to papal or archiepiscopal vestments.
The Roman
acus
is worn in the hair by the
Italian peasant woman of the present day.

Addorsed
, Her. (1) Back to back; (2) pointing
backwards.

Adespotoi

á¼-Î´á½³ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Î¹
, i. e. without
masters). A name given to a certain class of
freedmen at Sparta.

Fig. 9. Plan of a Roman temple, showing the adytum.

Adytum
or
Adyton
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î´Ï
ÏÎ¿Î½
,
from
Î±
, priv., and
Î´á½»Ï
, to enter). An obscure
and secret sanctuary in certain temples from
which the public was excluded, and into which
the priests alone might enter. The little temple
of Pompeii possessed an
adytum
, and it was here
that was discovered the Portici Diana now in
the Naples Museum. There was also an
adytum

in the temple of Delphi, which was burnt down
in the first year of the 58th Olym., and rebuilt
by the Corinthian Spintharus. The temple of
Paphos contained in its
adytum
a representation
of the goddess under the form of a column
pointed at the top and surrounded by candelabra.
The engraving shows the position of the adytum
of a small Doric temple, now destroyed, which
once stood near the theatre of Marcellus at
Rome. The
adytum
was the name given to the

cella
of a temple, in which oracles were given,
or the worship was connected with mysteries.
See
Abaton
and
Cella
.

Ãdicula
, R. (dimin. of
Ãdes
, q.v.). A small
house, temple, chapel, tabernacle, or even shrine.
Thus the name was given to a small wooden
shrine, constructed to imitate the front of a
temple, and in which were preserved the
ancestors of the family (
imagines majorum
),
together with the Lares and tutelar divinities.

Ãgicranes
, Gr. (
Î±á¼´Î³ÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï
, of a goat;
ÎºÏÎ±Î½á½·Î¿Î½
,
the skull). A goatâs [or ramâs] head employed
as a decoration by ancient sculptors. It was
used chiefly to adorn altars which were dedicated
to rural divinities.

Ãginetan marbles.
Two remarkable groups
of very early (archaic) Greek sculpture, in the
Glyptothek at Munichâdiscovered in the temple
of Pallas-Athene at Ãgina, and arranged by
Thorwaldsen. They illustrate âthe infancy of
art, which lingers round symbolic representation,
and has not yet grasped the full meaning and
truth of nature.â (
Butlerâs Imitative Art.
) The
anatomy of the bodies and limbs at this period
is greatly superior to the expression of the heads.

Ãgis
, Gr. In its primary meaning, a
goat-skin
.
The primitive inhabitants of Greece used
the skins of goats and other animals for clothing,
and defence. At a later period the
Ãgis
became
a protective mantle; the shield of Minerva, beneath
which the goddess sheltered those whom
she wished to protect from the enemyâs missiles.
Later still the
Ãgis
denoted the breastplate of a
divinity, in especial that of Jupiter or Minerva,
as opposed to the
lorica
, which was the breastplate
of a mere mortal. The Ã¦gis bore in its
centre the Gorgonâs head, of which the serpents
were arranged round the border. Minerva
is generally represented wearing it, either as a
cuirass or a scarf passed over the right shoulder.

AÃ«neator
(Lat.
aÃ«neus
, brazen). The name
given to any musician who played on an instrument
of brass (
aÃ«neum
); such as the
buccinatores
,

cornicines
,
liticines
,
tubicines
, &c. They
formed a college.

Fig. 10 Eolipyle.

ÃolipilÃ¦
or
ÃolipÈ³lÃ¦
,
Gr. (
Î±á¼´Î¿Î»Î¿Ï
, the
wind; and
Ïá½»Î»Î·
, an
orifice). A metal vase
with a narrow orifice,
which was filled with
water and placed upon
the fire, either to make
the chimney draw
better, or, according to
Vitruvius, to show
which way the wind
blew.

Ãolian Harp
, Gr.
A musical instrument
that is played on by the
wind passing over its
strings.

Ãrarium
, R. (
Ã¦s
,
money). The public
treasury as distinguished
from the private
treasury of the Emperors (
fiscus
). Under the Republic
the temple of Saturn served as the public
treasury, and here were preserved the produce
of the revenue, the public accounts and other
public records. The army had a separate
treasury of its own called
Ã¦rarium militare
,
entirely distinct from the
Ã¦rarium publicum
. It
was established by Augustus to provide for the
special expenditure of the army.

Aerial perspective.
The realization of the
effect of intervening atmosphere in the distances
of a landscape.

Ãro
, R. A basket made of rushes or broom,
but still more commonly of osier, and used for
conveying sand. It was employed by the Roman
soldiery when at work on intrenchments, excavations,
or fortifications, as may be seen from
bas-reliefs; more particularly some of those
which adorn the column of Trajan.

Ãruca
, R. (
Ã¦s
, bronze). A very brilliant
green colour artificially made to imitate
verdigris
.

Ãrugo
, R.
Verdigris
, the same colour as

Ã¦ruca
(q.v.), but obtained from oxide of bronze.
It is difficult to establish a real distinction between
the two terms, as Pliny gives the name
of
Ã¦rugo
(the rust of bronze) to what Vitruvius
calls
Ã¦ruca
. It is probable, however, that
Ã¦ruca

was a kind of verdigris obtained by artificial
means, while
Ã¦rugo
was the natural verdigris.
This has given rise to the two terms, which by
many archÃ¦ologists are confused together.

Ãruca
, the artificial copper rust, formed by
the action of wine refuse upon copper, is an
acetate of copper (verdigris): while the genuine
copper rust,
Ãrugo
, is a carbonate of copper.

Ãrumna
, R. A kind of fork by which
travellers carried their baggage over the shoulder.
2. An instrument of punishment for slaves.
(See
Furca
.)

Ãs.
A term used in antiquity to denote
brass, copper, bronze, or any alloy of these
metals. It also serves, in various connexions, to
denote a number of different objects. Such as

Ã¦s candidum
, a brass mixed with silver;
Ã¦s
Corinthum
, a brass mixed with gold;
Ã¦s Cyprium
,
the ancient name for copper. (See also

Bronze
.)

Ãs grave
, R. A general term current in
Rome to denote any bronze money at the period
when the
as
was equal to about a pound in value.

Ãs rude
, R. The name given to the bronze
ingots employed at Rome as ready money in
exchanges and other commercial transactions.

Ãs thermarum
, Gr. and R. A bronze gong
or metal bell hung up in the public baths, the
sound of which, when struck, gave notice to the
public that the baths were sufficiently warm to
be ready for use.

Ãs ustum.
Peroxide of copper, or calcined
copper.

Ãsthetics
, Gr. (
Î±á¼°ÏÎ¸á½±Î½Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹
, to comprehend).
The science of the instinctive apprehension of
the harmonies.

Aetos
, Gr. (
á¼ÎµÏá½¹Ï
). A Greek word signifying

eagle
, and by analogy, a gable, pediment, or
higher part of a building generally, so called
from the resemblance which these parts bear to
an eagle with outstretched wings. In the same
way the Greeks gave the name of
ÏÏÎµÏá½°
(wings),
to the outer rows of columns flanking each side
of a temple.

Affidati
, It. One of the Italian literary academies.
Their device was a nautilus, with the
motto âtutus per suprema per ima.â

AffrontÃ©e
, Her. Showing the full front.

Agalma
,
Agalmata
, Gr. (
á¼Î³Î±Î»Î¼Î±
, from
á¼Î³á½±Î»Î»Ï
,
to glorify). Any work of art dedicated to a god,
whether it were placed in his temple or not;
such as tripods; [braziers for incense], or other accessories
of a temple. The low pillar placed over
a tomb, or the statue of a god might be
agalmata
.

Agate.
A variety of quartz often employed
by the engravers of antiquity. The term is a
corruption of the word
Achates
, a river of Sicily,
on the banks of which numerous varieties of the
stone abound. Among these maybe mentioned
the
cerachates
, or white wax-like agate;
dendrachates
,
or arborescent agate;
hemachates
, or
blood-agate, so called from its blood-like spots;
and
leucachates
, or white agate. Agates were
often carved into scarabÃ¦i by the Egyptians,
and Babylonian cylinders have been found, made
of the same material. The oriental agate is
semi-transparent, the occidental is opaque, of
various tints, often
veined
with quartz and
jasper; hence its fitness for cutting cameos.

AgathodÃ¦mon, Cup of
, Gr. (
á¼Î³Î±Î¸Î¿-Î´Î±á½·Î¼ÏÎ½
).
A name given by the Greeks to a cup consecrated
to Bacchus, and meaning literally, the
âCup of the Good Genius.â It was sent round
after a feast, in order that each guest might
partake of the wine.

Agea
, R. A narrow passage or gangway in
a boat, by means of which the boatswain (
hortator
)
communicated with the rowers.

Agger
, R. A general term to denote a
mound of any materials, such as that formed
by a dyke, quay, roadway, or earthwork;
and particularly a rampart composed of trunks
of trees and employed in offensive or defensive
warfare. A celebrated
agger
was that of
Servius Tullius at Rome. The art of constructing

aggeres
and other fortifications, had
been learnt by the Romans from the Greeks,
who in their turn had derived it from the East.
It was after having penetrated into the heart of
Asia under Alexander the Great, that the Greeks
learned the use of siege works employed in
the attack or defence of strong places, and
became acquainted with various kinds of warlike
engines such as the
Acrobaticon
, &c.

Agnus Bell
, Chr. A sacring bell.

Agnus Dei
, Chr.
The Lamb of God
, or lamb
bearing the banner of the cross. The term is also
used to denote certain ornaments or medallions of
wax impressed with a figure of the lamb. They
represented the ancient custom of distributing to
worshippers, on the first Sunday after Easter, particles
of wax from the consecrated paschal taper.

Agolum, R.
A long sharp-pointed shepherdâs
stick used by the Roman herdsmen for driving
their cattle. The
agolum
was made out of a
straight shoot of the prickly pear; it is still in use
among the herdsmen of the Roman campagna
at the present day.

Agonalia
or
Agonia
, R. A Roman festival,
which derived its name from the word
agone

(shall I proceed?) the question asked of the

rex sacrificulus
by the attendant, before he
sacrificed the victim. The Quirinal was called

Mons agonus
, from a festival being held there on
the 17th or 18th of March, in honour of Mars.
The day itself was called
Agonium martiale
or
day of the Liberalia. Another explanation of
the etymology of the name is that the sacrifice
was offered on the Quirinal hill, which was originally
called
Agonus
. (Consult Ovid. Fasti, i.
319â332, he suggests several explanations.)

Agonistic
, (
á¼Î³ÏÎ½Î¹ÏÏÎ¹Îºá½´
, from
á¼Î³á½¼Î½
, a contest).
With the ancients, that part of gymnastics in
which athletes contended with arms.

Agora
, Gr. (
á¼Î³Î¿Ïá½°
, from
á¼Î³Îµá½·ÏÏ
, to assemble).
A place of assembly or public market. The

agora
was to the Greeks what the
forum
was
to the Romans. There were numerous agorÃ¦ in
Greece and Asia Minor. Fig.
11
, represents
the plan of the
agora
of Antiphellus; in which

a
and
b
indicate the sites of the corn-pits;

fasten the slashed dresses of
the middle ages; and sometimes
to fasten armour, when
they were made of leather
with metal points. In civilian
costume they were of silk.
The term Aiguillette is also
applied to the shoulder-knot
worn by soldiers and livery
servants.

worn on the shoulders
to protect the back of the neck; found in monumental
brasses of the 13th century.

Alabaster
or
Alabastrum
, (
á¼Î»á½±Î²Î±ÏÏÏÎ¿Î½
). A
small vase for holding precious perfumes; so called
from the alabaster of which it was generally
made. It was of various shapes, but chiefly
assumed an elongated form resembling a long
pear, a pearl-drop, &c. [Many of these perfume
vessels are made of stalactite.] (2) A calcareous
substance of white colour, translucent or semi-transparent,
and presenting, according to the
variety, undulating and continuous veins. The
various kinds of ancient alabaster are very
numerous; the following may be named;
flowered alabaster (
alabastro fiorito
); golden
(
dorato
); quince coloured (
cotognino
); eyed (
occini
);
tortoise-shell (
tartaruga
); foam-white
(
pecorella
); Busca de Palombara (
palombara
);
onyx (
onice
), &c. The Egyptians used alabaster
for making statues, phials, panegyric vases,
canopea, small figures, and even sarcophagi;
of which last that of Seti I., now in the British
Museum, is an example. Alabaster was at one
time frequently used for tombs and carved figures,
and is now used for pulpits and other ecclesiastical
purposes. False alabaster is the name
given to a gypseous variety of this substance,
of which there are rich quarries at Volterra, in
Tuscany. It is called âGesso Volterrano,â and
is much used in Italy for the
grounds
of pictures.

some, the marriage of Peleus and Thetis; and
according to others, that of Manlius and Julia.

Pompeii, which are also called
sectilia
.

Almond
, Chr. An aureole of elliptic
form, which is frequently met with encircling
representations of saints, or of

Virgin. A more common name, however,
for this aureole is
VESICA PISCIS

(q.v.). The term of
mystical almond

was applied to the symbol expressive
of the virginity of the Virgin Mary.
The mystical meaning attached to this
symbol is explained by reference to the
rod of Aaron, which consisted of the
bough of an almond-tree that had
flowered in a single night and produced
an almond on the morrow.

writers on art, it probably indicates
red ochre
,
the red hÃ¦matite of mineralogists. (Fairholt.)

Amber.
There are two varieties of this
substance, viz., the grey and the yellow amber,
of which the latter only need here be more
particularly noticed. Its use may be traced
back to a very early antiquity, the purposes to
which it was applied being the setting of jewels
and furniture. It was employed by the Jews
for making amulets. Amber was also used by
the Egyptians in the fabrication of necklaces
composed of pearls or other delicate materials.
By the Romans it was sculptured into vases or
statuettes. The name of
vasa electrina
was
given to amber vases set with silver, and that of

electrina patera
to paterÃ¦ made of amber alone.
Amber was largely used by early painters as a

varnish
, and also as a
vehicle
. It is harder than
copal, and is said to be the most durable of all
varnishes. It requires a long time to fit it for

polishing
. Amber is supposed to be a vegetable
fossil; it is washed up by the sea, especially on
the shores of the Baltic.

the name under which they then went being

Enfeus
(q.v.). During the same period the
term
ambitus
was also applied to the consecrated
ground by which a church was surrounded. It
served as a place of asylum as well as for burial.
The term is also applied to the process of canvassing
for votes.

Ambivium
, R. (
ambi
and

ancient Latin basilicas, a pulpit. Fig.
18
gives
a representation of the ambo in the church of
St. Lawrence without the walls at Rome.

regulÃ¦
) inserted
between the rafters and the tiles of a roof.

Ambry

ambulo
, to walk). Part of
a cloister, forming a kind of gallery for taking
exercise in.

Amenti
or
Amenthi
, Egyp. One of the names
given to the nether world of the Egyptians. It
means the
unseen region
. We learn from
Plutarchâs treatise on Osiris that, âthe subterranean
regions whither souls betake themselves
after death is called
Amenthes
.â Osiris is the
lord and god of Amenti, which was also called
by the Egyptians the
country of truth
.

Amentum
, R. A thong attached to the shaft
of a lance at the centre of gravity. The soldier
placed the fingers of his right hand between the
two ends of the thong, gave the weapon a rapid
turn, and then hurled it.
Amentum
was also
used to denote the leather strap by which certain
kinds of boots, such as the
crepidÃ¦
,
solÃ¦
, &c., were
fastened above the instep.

Amess.
(See
Almuce
.)

Amethyst
, (
á¼Î¼á½³Î¸Ï
ÏÏÎ¿Ï
, without intoxication.)
A precious stone of a more or less deep
violet colour. The engravers of antiquity
carved figures upon it, in especial those of
Bacchus, since the stone was also used, in preference
to any other, for making drinking-cups,
from a belief that it possessed the virtue of dispelling
intoxication. This was the origin of the
Greek term. Among the ancient Jews the
amethyst was one of the twelve stones composing
the breastplate of the high priest; it occupied
the eighth or ninth row. In Christian symbolism
the amethyst (or the colour violet) signifies
humility and modesty.

Amiantus
, (
á¼Î¼á½·Î±Î½ÏÎ¿Ï
[? undefiled]). A fibrous
uninflammable mineral substance. It was used
by the ancients for making fire-proof clothing.
It was known by the name of
asbestus

(
á¼ÏÎ²ÎµÏÏÎ¿Ï
, uninflammable).

Amice.
A piece of fine linen in the form of
an oblong square, suspended over the shoulders
of the clergy.
Pugin
says it is âa white linen
napkin or veil worn by all the clergy above the
four minor orders.â
Durand
says it is a proper
covering for the head, typical of the helmet of
salvation alluded to by the apostle; or of the
cloth with which the Jews covered the Saviourâs
face, when they asked him to prophecy who
struck him. Milton, in
Paradise Regained
,
alludes to it,â

âMorning fair

Came forth with pilgrim steps, in
amice
grey.â

Amma
, Egyp. (1) A measure of length in use
among the ancient Egyptians. It was about sixty
feet. (2) A kind of line used in land surveying.

,
woolly on both sides). A description of woollen
cloth more or less rough, and having a nap on
both sides.

Amphiprostylos
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î¼ÏÎ¹-ÏÏá½¹ÏÏÏ
Î»Î¿Ï
).
A temple or other building having two
open porticoes (
porticum
and
posticum
), both in
front and rear. They are so constructed as to
project beyond the
cella
, or main body of the
building.

Amphitapus
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î¼Ïá½·-ÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï
, hairy
on both sides). A particular kind of cloth,
made of some material resembling Vicuna wool,
and having, like the
amphimallum
, a nap on both
sides. It was probably of Eastern origin.

Fig. 19. Ground-plan of an amphitheatre.

Amphitheatre
, R. (
á¼Î¼ÏÎ¹-Î¸á½³Î±ÏÏÎ¿Î½
). A building
which was at first constructed for the
purpose of exhibiting gladiatorial shows to the
Roman populace; but later on any kind of
spectacle, even to a
naumachia
, or sea-fight, was
exhibited there. In the engraving, A shows the
ground-plan of an amphitheatre, and B the plan
of the seats.

Fig. 20. Greek AmphorÃ¦.

Amphora
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î¼Ïá½¶-ÏÎ¿Ïá½³Ï
). A large
earthenware vessel, having a handle on each side
of its neck (whence the name), and terminating in
a point. AmphorÃ¦ were used for holding various
kinds of produce, especially wine; they were
placed side by side in an upright position in the
cellar, the floor of which was covered with a deep
bed of sand. The engravings represent amphorÃ¦
from Cnidus, Chio, and Samos. AmphorÃ¦
were also made of glass; and a specimen is
mentioned by Nepos of one made of onyx.
Homer mentions them of gold and stone; and
the Egyptians had them of brass.

Amphotis
, Gr. and R. 1. A brass cap lined
with cloth inside. 2. A simple woollen cap worn
by athletes to protect their temples and ears from
the blows of the
cestus
, in a boxing match.
3. A wooden vessel in use among the ancient
Greek peasants, as a milking-pail. It derived its
name from having two handles or ears.

Ampulla
, Gr. and R. A phial or flask with
short and narrow neck and spherical body,
which was used to hold the oil requisite for
bathers (
ampulla oleria
); it could also be used
to hold vinegar, wine, and other beverages, and
was then called
ampulla potaria
. The ampulla
generally took the form of a globe or bladder,
but not invariably; a lentil-shaped variety with
rounded sides was very common.
Ampulla
rubida
was the name given to the leather-covered
flasks which were made use of by travellers or
sportsmen to carry wine, vinegar, or oil. The
vessel or cruet used in Christian churches for the
consecrated oil or wine was hence called the

Ampul
.

Ampyx
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î¼ÏÏ
Î¾
, from
á¼Î¼Ïá½³ÏÏ
,
to surround). Latin
frontale
. A general term
to denote any net composed of strings, bands, or
ribbons, which forms a head-band. It thus
denotes at once a womanâs head-dress, or the
ornamental strips of leather which serve as head-band
for a horse. The
ampyx
worn by women
was in some cases very costly, being made of
gold or silver, and adorned with precious stones.
The term was also applied, by analogy, to the
cover of a vase. Another word for it is
ampicter
.

Amulets.
Objects of a very heterogeneous
description, to which is superstitiously
attributed the power of healing certain diseases,
or averting them from men and animals. This
is the meaning which attaches, in its widest sense,
to the term amulet (
amuletum
). Amulets are
unquestionably of Eastern origin; by the Egyptians
they were looked upon as preservatives
against dangers, unlucky days, enemies, &c.
The varieties of them were very numerous;
among others, were scarabÃ¦i, small columns,
cartouches, symbolic eyes, interlacing fingers,
heads of urÃ¦us, &c. A large number of stones
were also employed as amulets; those of commonest
occurrence are hematite, jasper, lapis
lazuli, amethysts, diamonds, heliotropes, &c.
Each of these amulets had its special virtue;
for instance, the clear crystal worn during prayer
rendered the god propitious, and compelled him
to give ear to the suppliant. Coral kept every
evil influence away from a house; and in Italy
it is looked upon, even at the present day, as a
preservative against the evil eye. In Christian
archÃ¦ology, the name of amulets, or in some
instances,
Encolpia
(q.v.), was given to relics,
or objects of devotion, such as crosses, medals,
wood from the true cross, the bones of saints,
&c. Amulets were also called
periapta
(
ÏÎµÏá½·Î±ÏÏÎ±
),
i. e. suspended, because they were hung
round the neck, and also
pyctacium
, because
some amulets were folded in two. The Arabic
word amulet means the same as
periapta
, that
which is suspended.

Amussis
, R. The exact sense of this term is
not clearly defined by ancient authors, beyond
the fact that it denotes generally any kind of
instrument employed by buildersâespecially
masonsâfor testing the accuracy, regularity, and
evenness of their work. The term is used to
denote sometimes the plumb-line, rule, or square;
sometimes the level, measuring-line, &c.

Anabathra
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î½á½±-Î²Î±Î¸ÏÎ±
, steps
up). Steps or stairs; a raised step; a mounting
block. These last were often placed along the
high roads.

Anabologium
, Chr. Another name for the
Humerale or
Amice
(q.v.).

Anaceia
or
Anakeia
, Gr. (from
á¼Î½Î±Î¾
, a king).
A festival held at Athens in honour of Castor
and Pollux, who were also called
Anaktes
and

Anakestes
. (See
Anaceium
). Similar festivals
were held at Sparta, Argos, and other cities of
Greece.

Anaceium
, Gr. A temple of ancient Athens,
dedicated to Castor and Pollux. Slaves used to
be sold there.

Anaclinterium
, Gr. (
á¼Î½Î±ÎºÎ»Î¹Î½Ïá½µÏÎ¹Î¿Î½
). The
head-board of a sofa or bed, which served as a
support for the bolster and the pillow on which
the sleeperâs head rested.

Anadem
, Gr. (
á¼Î½á½±Î´Î·Î¼Î±
). In general a fillet
or head-band; but in a more restricted acceptation,
an ornamental band, such as was worn by
women and youths among the Greeks. It was
thus distinguished from the
diadema
and the

vitta
, which were also head-bands, but worn
solely as the insignia of honorary, regal, or
religious distinctions.

Anaglyph
, (
á¼Î½á½°
and
Î³Î»á½»ÏÎµÎ¹Î½
, to carve).
A general term to denote any work of art that
is sculptured, chased, carved, or embossed, such
as cameos, bas-reliefs, or other raised work,
whether in metal, marble, or ivory. When such
sculptures or chasings are incised or sunk, they
are called
Intaglios
or
Diaglyphs
(q.v.).
According to St. Clement of Alexandria, anaglyphs
were employed by the Egyptians when
they wished to hand down a panegyric of any
king under the form of a religious myth.
Although the words of St. Clement are very
obscure, and have furnished materials for countless
discussions, it is now admitted that the
anaglyphs in question belong to the group of
hieroglyphics which may be deciphered on the
cartouches of the Pharaohs, and in which we
have, in fact, panegyrics of the Egyptian kings
veiled in religious myths. The Egyptians also
gave the name of anaglyphs to a kind of secret
writing, understood only by the initiated; even
at the present day it remains undecipherable,
owing to our imperfect knowledge of Egyptian
mythology. (See
CÃ¦latura
.)

Anagogia.
A festival at Eryx, in Sicily, in
honour of Aphrodite.

Analemma
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î½á½±Î»Î·Î¼Î¼Î±
). Any
raised construction which serves for a support
or rest, and more particularly a pier, wall, or
buttress. (2) The pedestal of a sun-dial, and
so the sun-dial itself.

AnancÅum
, R. A drinking-cup of great
capacity, the form of which is unknown. If we
may credit Varro it was sometimes richly chased.

Anankaion
, Gr. (
á¼Î½Î±Î³ÎºÎ±á¿Î¿Î½
, from
á¼Î½á½±Î³ÎºÎ·
,
restraint). A kind of prison the purpose of
which is not exactly known. According to
some archÃ¦ologists it was a private prison for
slaves, or for freedmen, who, from some fault,
were reduced to servitude again; others assert
that it was a public prison.

Anapiesma
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î½Î±-Ïá½·ÎµÏÎ¼Î±
, that
which is pressed back). An appliance used in
ancient theatres. It was a kind of trap-door by
means of which deities were raised from beneath
the stage so as to make them visible to the
spectators. The
proscenium
contained a certain
number of these trap-doors; one of them, leading
from the orchestra to the front of the stage,
enabled the Furies to appear; by another,
marine deities made their appearance; while
that through which passed the shades who ascended
Charonâs staircase was called
Charonâs
anapiesma
.

Anastatic.
An ingenious modern process of
reproducing copies of printed matter, engravings,
ink drawings, &c., by transferring them to a
sheet of polished zinc.

AnathÄma
, Chr. (
á¼Î½á½±Î¸Î·Î¼Î±
, an offering).
Anything offered up in churches by the faithful;
as, for instance, vases and other utensils for
sacrifice, altar ornaments, &c.

AnathÄma

Anchor.
In Christian Art, the emblem of
Hope. The attribute of S. Clement, the Pope,
who was bound to an anchor, and thrown into
the sea. (See
Ancora
.)

Ancile
, R. A shield of the shape of a violin
case. It was the sacred shield which, according
to tradition, had fallen from heaven into the
palace of Numa. It occurs frequently on medals,
especially those of Augustus. The two incavations
of the shield were more or less deep, and
usually semicircular. But Ovid describes it as
of an entirely different shape, being cut evenly
all round;
Idque ancile vocat, quod ab omni parte
recisum est
(Ovid, Fast. iii. 377). The
Salii
,
or twelve priests of Mars Gradivus, had twelve
such shields. The form was oval, with the two
sides curving evenly inwards, so as to make it
broader at the ends than in the middle. They
used to beat their shields and dance.

Anclabris
, Gr. and R. A small table used
instead of an altar at sacrifices; it was slightly
concave, so as to adapt it to hold the entrails
of the victim for the inspection of the diviners.
(See
Altar
.)

Ancon
, Gr. and R. (
Î±Î³ÎºÏÎ½
). A term admitting
various meanings, (1) A small console on each
side of a door supporting an ornamental cornice.
(2) The arm of a chair or arm-chair.
(3) A cramp of wood or metal serving to connect
together courses of masonry or blocks of stone.
(4) The prongs or forks at the end of the props
employed by hunters to hang their nets upon.
(5) An earthenware vessel used in Roman
taverns for holding wine. According to the
etymology of the word which in Greek signifies
hollow or elbow, this bottle must have been
shaped like a retort. (6) The arms or branches
of the square used by carpenters and stone
masons, which form an angle similar to that
formed by the bent arm.

Fig. 21. Roman anchor, from a bas-relief.

Ancora
, Gr. and R. (
á¼Î³Îºá½»ÏÎ±
, from
á¼Î³ÎºÎ¿Ï
,
a bend). An anchor or piece of iron used to
stop a ship. Like those now in use, the ancient
anchors were generally furnished with two
flukes or arms, but sometimes they had only
one. In the latter case they were called
terostomos
,
a term corresponding
to our
modern blind
anchor. A bas-relief
on the
column of Trajan
represents an
anchor placed at
the bow of the
vessel. In Christian
archÃ¦ology
the anchor is a
symbol of hope;
an anchor is frequently
met with,
among Christian
symbols, associated
with a fish; the emblem of the Saviour
(See
Acrostic
).

Ancorale
, Gr. and R. Literally the cable of
an anchor, and then the buoy-rope, or even the
buoy itself. The ancient anchors had a ring at
the end of the shank to which the buoy-rope was
attached. The latter served not only to indicate
the place where the anchor lay, but also to drag
the flukes out of the ground when the anchor was
raised.

Andiron.
Iron standards with bars for supporting
logs of wood fires, frequently richly ornamented,
and sometimes made partly of silver.

Andriantes
, Gr. (
á¼Î½Î´ÏÎ¹á½±Î½ÏÎµÏ
, images of men).
Statues set up by the Greeks in honour of the
victors in the public games. This custom dated
from 50 Olym., or 584
B.C.

Androgeonia.
An Athenian annual festival,
in honour of Androgeus, the son of Minos.

Fig. 22. Plan of a Greek house, showing the andron.

Andron
,
Andronitis
, Gr. and Gr.-R. (
á¼Î½Î´Ïá½¼Î½
,
from
á¼Î½á½´Ï
, a man). That part of the Greek or
GrÃ¦co-Roman house exclusively set apart for
men. Fig.
22
represents the ground-plan of a
Greek house; the
andron
occupies all that part
of the building which surrounds the open court,
and consists of the apartments numbered 1 to 9.
The Romans applied
the term simply to a
passage separating a
house or part of a
house from another.

Anelace
, O. E. A
knife or dagger worn
at the girdle; broad,
two-edged and sharp.

âAn
anelace
and a gipciere all of silk,

Hung at his girdle, white as morwe milk.â

(
Chaucer
,
Canterbury Tales
.)

Fig. 23. Angel of the reign of Elizabeth.

Angel.
A gold coin
current in England
and France in the
15th and 16th centuries.
It derived its
name from the figure
of an angel stamped
upon it. A similar
coin, either of gold
or silver, was current
in France at various
periods. From the
time of Louis IX. to
that of Louis XI., the gold angel was equal in
value to a crown of fine gold, or a little more than
fourteen francs. It was stamped with a figure of
St. Michael, holding in his right hand a sword,
and in his left a shield with three fleur-de-lys.
Henry VI., king of England, when he was in
possession of Paris, had a gold angel struck
which was not above seven francs in value. It
was stamped with the figure of an angel holding
in his hand the shields of France and England.
The same king also had a silver angel struck
which was only worth about five and a half francs.

Fig. 24. Arms of France with Angels as supporters. XIV. century.

Angels
, (Gr.
á¼Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¿Ï
, a messenger) in Christian
Art are represented in nine degrees, which
are divided into three categories. The first consists
of Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; the
second of Dominations, Virtues, Powers; and
the third of Princedoms, Archangels, and Angels.
They are represented as young, to show their
continued strength; winged as messengers of
speed; barefooted and girt to show their readiness;
in robes of white indicative of purity, or
in cloth of gold for their glory; the cloth of gold
diapered with bands of precious stones; the
emerald, emblem of
unfading youth
; the crystal,
of
purity
; the sapphire, of
celestial contemplation
;
and the ruby, of
divine love
. During the renaissance,
Pugin complains, âthe edifying and
traditional representations of angelic spirits were
abandoned, and, in lieu of the albe of purity and
golden vests of glory, the artists indulged in
pretty cupids sporting in clouds, &c.â The
proper attributes of the angels are trumpets, for
the
voice of God
; flaming swords, for the
wrath
of God
; sceptres, for the
power of God
; thuribles
or censers for the
prayers of saints
, and musical
instruments to emblem their
felicity
.

Angiportus
or
Angiportum
, R. A narrow
road passing between two houses or rows of
houses, or an alley leading to a single house.

Fig. 25. Point dâAngleterre.

Angleterre, Point dâ.
Lace made by Flemish
makers who were invited to settle in England
in the reign of Charles II., the English Parliament
having passed an act prohibiting the importation
of all foreign lace. England, however,
could not produce the necessary flax, and
the lace was of inferior quality. The merchants
of the time remedied this by smuggling large
quantities of lace from the Brussels market, selling
it as English Point or Point dâAngleterre, by
which latter name it is still known, effacing the
old name âPoint de Bruxelles.â (Fig.
25
.)

Anglicanum Opus.
(See
Embroidery
.)

Angones.
French weapons of the Middle Ages
furnished with three blades, one of which was
straight, broad and keen, the remaining two
curving outwards. Some angons have a lozenge-shaped
head-blade. They were used as a kind of
pike, and sometimes hurled like javelins. The
latter kind somewhat resembled the
aclis
.

Anguilla
, R. A whip made use of by Roman
schoolmasters for punishing their scholars. It
was so called because made from the skin of an
eel (
anguis
).

Anguis
, R. A serpent which among the
Romans symbolized the local spirit (
genius loci
).
Serpents were painted upon a wall to deter the
public from defiling the spot thus indicated. At
Pompeii these representations of serpents are
found in the bakehouses, kitchens, and similar
places where cleanliness is peculiarly desirable.
The same term was applied to a military ensign
in the shape of a serpent.

Anime.
Gum anime is a resin, which is mixed
with copal in making varnish, causing it to dry
quickly and firmly.

Animosi of Milan.

, Gr. (See
Periscelis
.)

Annealing.
The process of tempering brittle
glass and metals by heat.

Annulet
, Her. A plain ring, or false roundle.

Annulets
, Arch. The rings or mouldings
about the lower part of the echinos or ovolo of
Doric capitals.

Annulus
or
Anulus
, Gr. and R. (dimin. of

anus
, a ring). A finger-ring. They were
originally made of iron, and used as a signet for
sealing. Later on they were made of gold.
Among the Greeks and Romans they were worn
on the fourth finger of the left hand, whence the
expression
sedere ad anulos alicui
, to be seated at
any oneâs left hand. The
anulus bigemmis
was a
ring set with two precious stones;
anulus velaris

was a curtain ring. A plait of hair arranged in
circles round the back of the head was also called

anulus
. In architecture the term was formerly
employed instead of
anulet
. The stone most
frequently used for rings was the onyx, upon
which devices were carved with wonderful skill.
The
bezel
, or part of the ring which contained the
gem, was called
Pala
. (See
Rings
.)

Ansa
, Gr. and R. A term signifying both
haft and handle, and even eyelet or hole. Any
vessel or vase which has large ears or circular
handles on the neck or body, is said to be furnished
with
ansÃ¦
.
Ansa ostii
was the term
applied to the handle by which a door is pulled
or shut to. The bronze or iron eyelet on the top
of a steelyard were also called
ansÃ¦ staterÃ¦
.
The holes or eyelets made in the side leathers of
a Greek or Roman shoe were called
ansÃ¦ crepidÃ¦
;
the handle of the rudder,
ansa gubernaculi
; lastly
an iron cramp was called
ansa ferrea
.

Fig. 26. Templum in antis.

AntÃ¦
, R. Square or rectangular pilasters
supporting the walls of a temple, which was
thence called
templum in antis
. (Fig.
26
.) The

antÃ¦
thus formed the end of the walls of the
cella
.
The capitals of
antÃ¦
and the friezes abutting on
them were sometimes richly ornamented, as
may be seen by referring to Fig.
27
, which represents,
in their restored state, the frieze and one
of the antÃ¦ in the temple of Augustus, at Ancyra,
in Galatia.

Fig. 27. Capital and frieze of one of the AntÃ¦ in the temple of Augustus.

Antarius
,
Antarii funes
, R. Ropes employed
for raising into the proper position any object
of considerable weight, such as a column, mast,
&c.

Fig. 29. Archaic Antefixa in terra-cotta.

Antefixa.
Ornaments of terra-cotta which
were placed above the cornice, at the end of each
row of tiles on a roof (Fig.
29
). They were also
used in ancient times for decorating the ridge
of a roof. We possess specimens of antefixa
remarkable for delicacy of design and execution;
such were the antefixa of the temple of Diana
PropylÃ¦a at Eleusis, and the various Etruscan
specimens to be found in our museums. They
were decorated with masks, leaves, and especially
palms painted to imitate nature or in different
colours. The Etruscans employed coloured antefixa
only; many specimens of these last may be
seen at the Louvre, and in the museums of
Perugia, Florence, and Naples. The Antefixa
of the Parthenon were of marble. (Fig.
30
.)

Fig. 30. Antefixa in marble from the Parthenon.

Fig. 31. Anterides of the Cloaca Maxima at Rome.

Anterides
, Gr. and R. (?
á¼Î½ÏÎµÏÎµá½·Î´Ï
, to stand
firm). A structure employed to strengthen a
weaker one. It consisted of a kind of buttress
placed against an outer wall, chiefly in subterranean
constructions, such as a sewer or aqueduct.
Fig.

of an
ascia
, has given rise to numerous interpretations.
It is supposed that this expression
signified: This tomb [never before used] has been
dedicated to the memory of the person in whose
honour it was erected; or possibly the formula
implied that the plot upon which the memorial
stood had been granted in perpetuity. After all
the discussion to which the formula has given
rise, these are the two hypotheses most generally
accepted. (See
Acisculus
.)

âall terms for

used by shoemakers for dyeing their leather,
another name for which was
chalcamentum

(q.v.); and
atramentum tectorium
, a kind of ink
used for writing inscriptions with a brush. In
ancient times, all descriptions of ink were made
with soot and gum, forming a kind of Indian
ink which was diluted with water. Vitruvius
(Book VII.) thus describes the process by which

),
round which were grouped the different apartments
of the house. In the centre of the roof
was an aperture with sloping sides called the

compluvium
, and in the court beneath, a basin
which collected the rain-water from the roof.
This was called the
impluvium
. There were
besides, the
atrium displuviatum
and the
atrium
testudinatum
. The atrium was unquestionably
the most essential and the most interesting part
of a Roman mansion; it was here that numbers
assembled daily to pay their respects to their
patron, to consult the legislator, to attract
the notice of the statesman, or to derive importance
in the eyes of the public from an
apparent intimacy with a man in power.â
Moule.

the
oracles
were
consulted; but in

Bands.
Originally the name given to the
collars which (in the 17th century) replaced the
ruff of Elizabethâs
reign. At first
they were made
of stitched linen
or cambric edged
with lace, stiffened
so as to stand
up round the neck.
Contemporary
with these were the
falling bands. The
engraving (by Hollar,
1640) shows a
merchantâs wife
with collar or falling
band of cambric
edged with lace.
The term bandbox
has descended
to us from those
days, when similar
boxes were made
expressly for keeping
bands and ruffs
in. (Fig.
58
.)

Bands
, Arch.,
are either small
strings round
shafts, or a horizontal
line of
square, round, or
other panels
used to ornament towers, spires, and other
works. (See
Balteus
.)

Bandum
,
Banderia
, Med. Lat. A small
banner. The French poets called it â

Meyrick.
)

, O. E. (Fr.
banquier
). A carpet
or cloth covering for a table, form, or bench.

Fig. 59. The Royal Standard, or Banner.

Banner.
In
heraldry, a
square, or narrow
oblong
flag, larger
than the pennon
(q.v.),
charged with
the coat of
arms of the
owner displayed
over its entire
surface,
precisely as it
is blazoned on
a shield, as in
the illustration
of the Royal
Standard,
which should properly be styled the Royal
Banner
.
(See
Standard
.) The Union Jack is also
a banner, in which the blazonry of the two
nations of England and Scotland are combined,
not by âquartering,â but by an earlier process
of âblendingâ the cross and the saltire in a
single composition. The profusion of banners
at tournaments, in feudal times, when each
noble planted his own in the lists, was an element
of picturesque effect. The term applies
to all kinds of flags, or colours, proper to
individuals, or corporations, &c., who display
them. It does not appear that
military
banners
were used by the ancients. The banners used
in Roman Catholic countries bear the representation
of patron saints, or symbols of religious
mysteries.

Banneret.
A knight entitled to display a
banner.

Baphium
, Gr. and R. (
Î²á½±ÏÏÏ
, to dye). A

Baptisterium
, R. (from
Î²á½±ÏÏÏ
, to dip). A
kind of cold plunging-bath, constructed in the

Frigidarium
(q.v.), or the room itself. In
Christian archÃ¦ology,
baptistery
was the name
given to a building adjoining a basilica, or
situated near it, in which baptism was administered.
Such is the baptistery of St. John
Lateran at Rome. One of the most ancient
baptisteries in France is that of St. Jean, at
Poitiers, represented in Fig.
60
. It dates from
the fourth century; that of St. Constance, at
Rome (Figs. 61, 62), belongs to the same
period.

Fig. 62. Interior of the Baptistery of St. Constance.

Bar
, Her. A horizontal line across a shield.

Barathron
or
Orugma
, Gr. (
Î²á½±ÏÎ±Î¸ÏÎ¿Î½
). A

which criminals were thrown, either under sentence
of death by this means, or after they had
been put to death by hemlock or other poisons.
It was situated near the temple of Diana AristobulÃª.

Barba
, Gen. The beard, whence the attributive

barbatus
, frequently employed to denote one
who wears a beard. Thus
bene barbatus
, a man
with a well-trimmed beard;
barbatulus
, a young
man whose youthful beard had never been
touched with the razor. Among many nations
of antiquity the custom prevailed of curling the
beard artificially, so as to obtain long curls or
ringlets,
cincinni
. (See
Cincinnus
.) The Assyrians,
Egyptians, Jews, Persians, Greeks, and
Romans may be particularly enumerated. Shaving
the beard was introduced into Rome about

B.C.
300, and became the regular practice. In
the later times of the republic many persons
began to wear it trimmed, and the terms
bene
barbati
and
barbatuli
were applied to them.
Under Hadrian the practice of wearing beards
was revived, and the emperors until Constantine
wore them. The Romans let the beard grow as
a sign of mourning; the Greeks shaved. The
beard is an attribute of the prophets, apostles,
and evangelists (excepting St. John); and, in
ancient art, of Jupiter, Serapis, Neptune, &c.
Neptune has a straight beard; Jupiter a curly
silky one. The early Britons shaved generally,
but always had long moustachios. The Anglo-Saxon
beard was neatly trimmed or parted into
double locks. The Normans originally shaved
clean, but when settled in England let all their
beard grow. Close shaving prevailed among
the young men in England in the 14th century;
older men wore a forked beard. After sundry
changes, clean shaving obtained in the reign of
Henry VI., and the beard was rarely cultivated
from then until the middle of the 16th century.
The most extravagant fashions arose in Elizabethâs
reign, and were succeeded by variations
too numerous to detail.

Barbatina
, It. A preparation of clay mixed
with the shavings of woollen cloth, used in the
manufacture of pottery to attach the handles and
other moulded ornaments. (

term also denotes
an outwork
placed
in front of a
fortified castle
or any other
military post. In the latter acceptation the
term
Antemural
(q.v.) is also used. The
illustration is taken from the arms of Antoine de
Burgundy. In this instance the barbican is a
small double tower, or out-post watch-house, and
the shutter-like pent-house protection of the unglazed
window openings bears a striking resemblance
to a modern sun-blind.

Barbitos
, Gr. and R. (
Î²á½±ÏÎ²Î¹ÏÎ¿Ï
). A stringed
instrument which dates from a very high antiquity;
it was much larger than the
Cithara

(q.v.). To strike the long thick strings of the

barbitos
, a
Plectrum
(q.v.) was used instead
of the fingers. The invention of this instrument
is attributed to Terpander; Horace, on the contrary,
says it was invented by AlcÃ¦us, and
AthenÃ¦us by Anacreon. It was a kind of lyre
with a large body.

formed part of the structure on which they
rested; they were, in fact, turrets. (Fig.
67

Fig. 71. Ground-plan of a Basilica.

Basilica
(sc. aula), Gr. and R. (
Î²Î±ÏÎ¹Î»Î¹Îºá½´
, sc.

ÏÏÎ¿á½°
, i. e. royal hall). This term owes its original
meaning to the fact
that in Macedonia the
kings, and in Greece the
archon Basileus dispensed
justice in buildings of this
description. The Romans,
who adopted the
basilica from the above-named
countries, used it
as a court of justice, but
besides this it became a
branch of the forum, and
even when it did not form
a part of the latter was
constructed near it, as
was the case at Pompeii.
Fig.
71
represents the
ground-plan of this basilica,
and Fig.
70
a view
of the same building
restored. The ground-plan
of the basilica is
rectangular, the width
not more than half nor
less than a third of the
length. It was divided
by two single rows of
columns into three naves, or aisles, and the
tribunal of the judge was at one end of the
centre aisle. In the centre of the tribunal
was the
curule chair
of the prÃ¦tor, and seats
for the judices and advocates. Over each of
the side aisles there was a gallery, from which
shorter columns supported the roofs; these were
connected by a parapet wall or balustrade. The
central nave was open to the air. Under Constantine
the basilicÃ¦ were adopted for Christian
churches. The early Norman churches were built
upon the same plan, and the circular apsis,
where the judges originally sat, used for the
central altar, was the origin of the apsidal termination
of the Gothic cathedrals. The first basilica was built at Rome,
B.C.
182. In the Middle
Ages structures resembling small churches erected
over tombs were called Basilica.

especially to the use of ladies, as the
Anthologia
Latina
says: âThe gilded basterna conceals
the chaste matrons.â It was carried by two

behind; the
Lectica
(q.v.), on the contrary, was
carried by men. During the Middle Ages the
same form of litter was a common means of
conveyance in England.

bedstead
means only âa
place for a bed.â
Tester beds
, or beds with a
roof, were introduced by the Normans. Early
in the 13th century beds were covered much as
now, with âquilte,â counterpane, bolster,
sheets, and coverlet; and stood behind curtains
which hung from the ceiling. In the 15th century
the beds became much more ornamental,
having canopy and curtains, and these, as well as

and the brittleness diminished.

Bronzes
(ancient Chinese) are rarely seen out
of the province of Fokien. The lines of metal
are small and delicate, and are made to represent
flowers, trees, animals of various kinds,
and sometimes Chinese characters. Some fine
bronzes, inlaid with gold, are met with in this
province. As a general rule, Chinese bronzes
are more remarkable for their peculiar and certainly
not very handsome form than for anything
else.

Bronzing.
The art of laying a coating of bronze
powder on wood, gypsum, or other material.
Another method is the electrotype process. (Consult
Walkerâs

consecrated to Typhon; in ancient times it was
the sign of mourning. Regarded as a compound
of red and black,
Bistre
, it is the symbol of all
evil deeds and treason. In a monastic costume
it signifies renunciation. With the Moors it was
emblematic of all evil. Christian symbolism
appropriates the colour of the dead leaf for the
type of âspiritual death,â &c. (Consult Portal,

Byssus
, Gr. and R. (
Î²á½»ÏÏÎ¿Ï
). The precise
meaning of this term is unknown; there is no
doubt it was a texture made of some very costly
material, since we learn from Pliny that the
byssus cloth which he calls
linum byssinum

exceedingly dear. Everything leads us to suppose
that it was a linen material of the finest

by Herodotus and Ãschylus. The word
comes from the Hebrew
butz
.

Byzantine Period.

Time, about
6th to 12th century

A. D.
(
Byzantium
,
the Latin
name of Constantinople.)
Byzantine
Architecture
is noteworthy
for a bold
development of
the plan of Christian
places of worship.
It introduced
the cupola,
or dome, which
was often surrounded
by semi-domes; an almost square ground-plan
in place of the long aisles of the Roman
church; and piers instead of columns. The
apse always formed part of Byzantine buildings,
which were richly decorated,
and contained
marble in great
profusion. St. Sophia,
Constantinople
(
A. D.
532â537), is
the finest example of
Byzantine architecture.
St. Markâs,
Venice (
A. D.
977), and
the Cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle
(
A. D.
796â804),
are also of
pure Byzantine style.
Byzantine Painting
was that which succeeded
the decline of
the early Christian
Art in the catacombs
and basilicas of Rome,
and which preceded
and foreshadowed the
Renaissance of Art in
Italy. In style it was
based on that of the
catacombs, but with a
reminiscence of the
excellence of ancient
Greece; it was, however,
restrained and
kept within narrow
limits by the conventionalities
which were
imposed upon it by
the Church, and which
almost reduced it to a mechanical art. The
mosaics of the 10th and 11th centuries in St.
Markâs, Venice, are perhaps the best existing
examples of the Byzantine period. Specimens
are also to be seen in St. Sophia, Constantinople;
and at Ravenna.

C.

Caaba
, Arabic (lit. square house). The sacred
mosque at Mecca. The temple is an almost
cubical edifice, whence its name. It is a
favourite subject of representation upon Mussulman
works of art.

Caballaria
,
Cavalherium
,
hevallerie
(Gr.

ÎºÎ»á¿ÏÎ¿Ï á¼±ÏÏÎ¹Îºá½¸Ï
), Med. A meadow set apart for
military exercises.

Caballerius
, Med. Lat. A cavalier, or
knight.

Cabeiri
were the personification of the element
of fire. The precise nature attributed to them is
unknown. There were two principal branches
of their worship, the Pelasgian and the PhÅnician.
It is probable that this religion originated
in Asia Minor, and penetrated to the island of
Samothrace, in remote antiquity; it was very
popular throughout Greece in the Pelasgic period.
The principal temples were at Samothrace, Lemnos,
Imbros, Anthedon, and other places.

Cabeiria

is said, seeing two snakes struggling together,
separated them with his wand, whereupon the
snakes immediately twined themselves round it.
This was the origin of the caduceus, as we

who thence obtained his name of
Caducifer

caduceus-bearer. The caduceus was an emblem
of peace.

two methods of construction to which this name
applied. The first, called

or less irregular shape in mortar, so as to give
them any architectural form, and then covering
the whole over with cement. The second,
called
cÃ¦menticia structura antiqua

by incrustation.â (
Jacquemart.
)

calamus
, q.v.). A case for
carrying writing-reeds (
calami
). Another name
for this case was
theca calamaria
.

Calamister
and
Calamistrum
. A curling-iron,
so named because the interior was partly hollow
like a reed (
calamus
), or perhaps because in very
early times a reed heated in the ashes was employed
for the purpose; hence,
Calamistratus
,
an effeminate man, or discourse. (Compare

Ciniflo
.)

Calamus
(
Îºá½±Î»Î±Î¼Î¿Ï
, a reed or cane). A haulm,
reed, or cane. The term was applied to a
variety of objects made out of reeds, such as a
Panâs pipe, a shepherdâs flute (
tibia
), a fishing-rod
(

), a rod tipped with lime, for fowling,
&c. (See
Arundo
.) It was specially used,
however, to denote a reed cut into proper shape,
and used as a pen for writing.

Calautica
.)

Fig. 124. Calash.

Calash
(Fr.
calÃ¨che

string passed through a hem round the top. In
the third description there was neither cord,
lace, nor slit. The shoe was always low in the
heel, and was worn like a slipper.

Calceus
(
calx
, the heel). A shoe or boot
made sufficiently high to completely cover the

the candlestick had several branches, it was called
a candle-
tree
. There were iron, bone, silver-gilt,
and ornamented candlesticks. Through
the Middle Ages candles were stuck on a spike,
not in a socket, and a chandelier of the 16th
century shows the same arrangement.

A dog. This term
has numerous diminutives:

catulus
,
catellus
,

canicula
. However
ancient any civilization,
the dog is
always met with as
the companion of
man, and in each nation
it follows a particular
type. Thus a
distinct difference is
perceptible in the dogs
of the Etruscans,
Greeks, Romans,
Egyptians, Indians,
and Gauls. The
Egyptians had terriers
and greyhounds,
wolf-dogs, and others
for hunting or watchdogs.
All these breeds
are met with on the
bas-reliefs of Egyptian
monuments. The
Egyptian name for a
dog,
wou
,
wouwou

as a basis or model in forming statues, the
various members of which bore a definite proportion

. The
Î´Î¿ÏÏ
Ïá½¹ÏÎ¿Ï

affording a standard for the proportions of the
human body. The Egyptians are also supposed
to have had a canon, in which the middle finger
formed the unit of measurement.

Canopea
or
Canopic Vases
. An Egyptian
vase, made of clay, and so named from its being
manufactured at Canopus, a town of Lower
Egypt, the present Aboukir. The same name
was given to funereal urns made in the shape of
the god
Canopus
, who is described by Russin as

pedibus exiguis, attracto collo, ventre tumido in
modum hydriÃ¦, cum dorso Ã¦qualiter tereti
(i. e.
having small feet, a short neck, a belly as round
and swelling as a water-jar, and a back to
match). Canopean vases were made of earthenware,
alabaster, and limestone. They were
placed at the four corners of tombs or sarcophagi
containing mummies. In them were deposited
the viscera of the dead, which were
placed under the protection of the four genii,
symbolized each by the head of some animal
which served at the same time for the lid of the
canopea.

Carmine.
A beautiful pigment prepared from
the insect, cochineal. Carmine is the richest
and purest portion of the colouring matter of
cochineal. The various kinds of carmine are
distinguished by numbers, and possess a value
corresponding thereto; the difference depending
either on the proportion of the
alumina
added,
or on the presence of
vermilion
added for the
purpose of diluting and increasing the quantity
of the colour: the alumina produces a paler tint,
and the vermilion a tint different to that of
genuine carmine. The amount of adulteration
can always be detected by the use of liquor
ammoniÃ¦, which dissolves the whole of the carmine,
but leaves the adulterating matter untouched.
Carmine is chiefly used in miniature
painting and in water-colours. It is made in
large quantities in Paris.

themselves in order to defend the camp proper,
which lay in the centre of the

covered with a pantherâs skin; it was ornamented
with the

is evidently onomatopoetic. As a symbol, this
animal played a part which has hitherto not
been clearly determined. Certain papyri show
us the cat severing the serpentâs head from its
body, a symbol which would seem to point out
the cat as the destroyer of the enemies of the
daylight and the sun. Again, the goddess

(
ÏÎ±Î»Îºá½¸Ï
, copper). Engraving

Chalcography
was discovered in
Florence, in the 15th century, and early introduced
into England. Caxtonâs âGolden
Legend,â containing copper-plate prints, was
published in 1483. The process is as follows:âA
perfectly smooth plate of copper, having been
highly polished, is heated in an oven, and then
white wax rubbed over it until the whole surface
is covered with a thin layer. A tracing is laid
over the wax, with the black-lead lines downwards,
which transfers the design to the wax.
Then the tracing-paper is removed, and the
engraver goes over the lines lightly with a fine
steel point, so as just to penetrate the wax, and
scratch a delicate outline upon the copper. The
wax is then melted off, and the engraving finished
with the
graver
, or
burin
, a steel instrument with
a peculiar pyramidal point. Should the lines be
cut too deeply, a smooth tool, about three inches
long, called a
burnisher
, is used to soften them
down, and to burnish out scratches in the copper.
The
ridges
or
burrs
that rise on each side of the
engraved lines are scraped off by a tool about six
inches long, called a
scraper
, made of steel, with
three sharp edges. This method has for printing
purposes been generally superseded by other
processes, principally
etching
.

Chess.
Writers immediately after the Conquest
speak of the Saxons as playing at chess, which,
they say, they learned from the Danes. The
game of chess is very prominent in the romances
of the Middle Ages. The Scandinavian navigators
introduced some remarkable elaborately carved
chessmen, of walrus ivory, from Iceland, in the
12th century. The castles are replaced by
warriors on foot, called
hrokr
, from the Saracen

roc
, Persian
rokh
, our
rook
. In the Saracen
game the
vizier
represented our queen, and the

elephant
our bishop, the
roc
, or hero, as aforesaid,
our rook. Beautifully carved chessmen in
the costumes of the 13th and 14th century exist
in England. They were all very large, a king
being four inches in height and seven in circumference.
The
chess-boards
were of corresponding
size, and made of all materials, including the
precious metals, crystal, sapphires, and topazes.
The pieces varied in form: the mediÃ¦val rook
had a head like a
fleur-de-lis
, the knight was
represented by a small upright column with the
upper part bent on one side. The
aufin
or
bishop was of the same shape, but the bent end
was cleft to indicate a mitre. The figures of the
16th century much more nearly resemble those
now in vogue.

Cobalt.
A metal
found in various
combinations,
from which various
colouring matters
are obtained
of great use in the
arts.
Cobalt blue
,
a beautiful blue
pigment, is obtained
by mixing a salt of pure cobalt with a
solution of pure alum, precipitating the liquid
by an alkaline carbonate, washing the precipitate
with care, drying and igniting it strongly.
A fine green, known as
Rinmannâs green
, is
similarly prepared. The chloride, the nitrate,
and the sulphate of cobalt form
sympathetic inks
,
which only become visible when the moisture is
absorbed by the application of heat. From
phosphate of cobalt a beautiful blue pigment
is produced, called
Thenardâs blue
. It is said
to have all the characters of ultramarine. Oxide
of cobalt has the property of colouring glass
blue; hence a glass formed of this oxide under
the name of
smalt
is the blue colouring matter
used for ornamenting porcelain and earthenware,
for staining glass, for painting on enamel,
&c.

put into a strainer or a bag, called respectively

collum nivarium
,
saccus nivarius
, through which
the wine was allowed to filter, not only to cool
it, but because the intense cold cleared the wine,
and rendered it sparkling and transparent; it
was then called

Column
, Arch. A

three principal parts:
the base (

Doric
, or most ancient
style, the columns
in a row rest
upon a common
base (
podium
). In
the Ionic and Corinthian,
each column
has its own
base (
spira

shaft of all columns

tapers
gradually from
the base to the
capital. Any swelling
introduced to
modify the straightness
of the line was
called
entasis
. On
the summit of a
row of columns rests
the
architrave
, or
chief beam (
d
);
above this the

frieze
(
e
), and the

cornice
(
f
) projects
above the frieze.
These three together
are called the
entablature

The triangular
gable-end of
the roof, above the
entablature, is called
the
pediment
. A circuit
of columns, enclosing
an open
space in the interior
of a building, was
called a
peristyle
.
A temple of two
stories, with one
peristyle upon another
(Ionic or Corinthian
columns
over the heavier
Doric), was called

hypÃ¦thral

is a symbol of the Church, which was called, so
early as St. Paul,

forced an entrance into
an enemyâs camp, was

c. triumphalis
there
were three kinds: one

still greater value, also of gold. The
c. ovalis

to commemorate an ovation to an officer, was
made of myrtle leaves. The
c. oleagina

leaves, was given to common soldiers. Besides
these, there were the various sacerdotal

chaplets of leaves and flowers for the dead,
called
c. funebres
or
sepulchrales
; the wreaths
of roses, violets, myrtles, ivy, &c., worn at
convivial meetings,
c. convivialis

bridal wreath, of Greek origin, made of flowers
not bought, but plucked by the bride herself,
the verbena being the chosen flower among the

house were either of the composition called
Ruderatio
,

The inner walls were usually covered with
frescoes. The ceilings left the beams visible,
which supported the roof, and the hollow or
unplanked spaces (
Lacunaria

)
were often covered with gold and ivory, or with
paintings. (See
Camara
.) The principal apartments
had no windows, deriving their light from
the roof; in the upper stories there were
windows either open or latticed, or later filled
with mica, and finally glass.

Norman or mediÃ¦val
castle. It was generally
separate from
the other parts of the
building. The greater
number of feudal
fortresses originally
consisted merely of a
donjon erected on
an artificial earthwork.
This donjon
was surrounded by
an open space walled,
called the Inner
Bailey, and another
beyond called the
Outer Bailey. Beneath
were the dungeons.
Fig.
264
represents
a donjon
called the Tower of
Loudun. The White
tower is the donjon of
the Tower of London.

Doom.
In Christian art, the Last Judgment;
a subject usually painted over the chancel arch
in parochial churches.

Dorelot.

ladies in the 14th century. (See
Calantica
,

Crespine
, &c.)

Fig. 265. Column and Capital of the Doric Order.

Doric Order of Architecture.
The earliest
and simplest of the three Greek orders. âThe
Grecian Doric order, at its best period, is one
of the most beautiful inventions of architectureâstrong
and yet elegant, graceful in outline and
harmonious in all its forms, imposing when on
a great scale, and pleasing equally when reduced
in size, by the exquisite simplicity of its parts.â
(
Newlands.
) The columns of this order had no
pedestal, nor base;
the capital, which
was half a diameter
in height,
had no
astragal
,
but a few plain
fillets, with channels
between
them, under the

ovolo
, and a small
channel below the
fillets. The
ovolo

is generally flat,
and of great projection,
with a

quirk
, or return.
On this was laid
the
Abacus
,
which was only a
plain tile, without
fillet or ornament.
A peculiarity of
this order was the

flutings
of the column,
twenty in
number, shallow,
and with sharp
edges. The best
examples of the
Grecian Doric of
which we have
descriptions and
figures are the
temples of Minerva
(called the Parthenon)
and of
Theseus at Athens,
and that of Minerva
at Sunium.
The
Roman Doric
differs in important particulars
from the Grecian. (See
Roman Doric
.)

Dormant
or
Couchant
, Her. Asleep. (See

Couchant
.)

Dormer
(Fr.
dormir
, to sleep). The top story
in the roof of a house.

Dormer Window.
A gabled window in the
sloping side of a roof, projecting
vertically
; when
it lies in the slope of the roof, it is a
skylight
.

Dorneck
,
Dornex
, or
Dornyks
, O. E. An inferior
damask, wrought of silk, wool, linen thread,
and gold, at Tournay or
Dorneck
; 15th century.

Dorsale
,
Dosser
,
Dossier
, Chr. (
dorsum
, the
back). Pieces of tapestry or hangings put up
in the arches or bays surrounding the choir of a
church in order to screen the clergy and choristers
from draughts of air. Also pieces of tapestry hung
upon parapets, the panels of pulpits and stalls, and
sometimes the backs of side-boards. It was the
custom to hang tapestry, cloth of Arras, or
needlework round the lower half of all the
ancient dining-halls to a height of about five
feet above the basement.

Dorsualia
, R. (
dorsum
). An embroidered
saddle-cloth, which was laid across the back
of a horse on the occasion of a triumphal
entry, or on the backs of victims for sacrifice.
Examples of
dorsualia
occur on several monuments,
in especial on a bas-relief of the arch of
Titus, at Rome.

Doryphorus
, Gen. (
Î´Î¿ÏÏ
-Ïá½¹ÏÎ¿Ï
). Literally,
spear-bearer. Fig.
130
represents a Persian spearman.
A celebrated statue of Polycletus (of the
Argive school) is called the
Doryphorus
.
âPolycletus advanced his art in several respects,
chiefly by fixing a law of proportion, of which
his Doryphorus, a youth bearing a spear, was
called the
Canon
(q.v.); and also by his making
the weight of the body rest on one foot, in
contradistinction to the ancient practice, thereby
producing a contrast between the supporting,
weight-bearing side of the body, and the supported,
freely-resting side.â (
Butlerâs Imitative
Art.
) The statue by Polycletus is lost. The
proportions handed down to us by Vitruvius
are thus described by Bonomi:â

(1) The length of the horizontally extended arms equals
the height of the figure.

(2) The head is an
eighth
, the face a
tenth
of the whole
height.

(3) From the top of the scalp to the nipples is
one-fourth
.

(4) From the nipples to horizontal line across the
centre of the squareâthe pubesâis
one-fourth
.

(5) From that line to one just below the knee-cap is

one-fourth
.

(6) From that line to the ground is
one-fourth
.

(7) The forearm (from the elbow) is a
fourth
of the
height; the hand a
tenth
.

lining of a well-bound book.

Fig. 267. Doublet costume,
temp.
Elizabeth.

Doublet
, although deriving its name from
the French word
doublÃ©e
(lined), is in that language
more generally known as âPourpoint,â
of which, in fact, it is merely a variety. It
first appeared in England in the 14th century
made without sleeves, which for convenience
were afterwards added; and being universally
adopted, it superseded the tunic. The engraving
shows a doublet with stuffed sleeves of the
time of Elizabeth. They were worn of varied
forms till the reign of Charles II. (Fig.
267
.)

Doubling
, Her. The lining of a mantle or
mantling.

Fig. 268. Two Doves. Device of Giovanna deâ Medici.

Dove.
A Christian symbol of frequent occurrence;
it expresses candour, gentleness, innocence,
faith, and, in especial, the Holy Spirit.
It is also a symbol of martyrdom and grief, and
in this signification appears frequently represented
on tombs and sarcophagi. With an
olive-bough in its mouth it is a symbol of peace,
and accordingly the inscription
Pax
(Peace) is
often found accompanying representations of the
dove, more particularly in the catacombs.
With the Assyrians and Babylonians the dove
was the symbol of Semiramis, who, according
to them, took this shape on leaving earth. The
dove was the favourite bird of Venus. As a
symbol of conjugal fidelity, the device of two
turtle-doves was adopted by Giovanna of
Austria on her marriage with Francesco deâ
Medici. (Fig.
268
.)

Fig. 269. Dove-tailed Masonry.

Dove-tail
or
Swallow-tail
, Gen. A method
of joining employed for wood, stone, or iron,
and so called because the tenon by which the
joint is effected is cut in the shape of a dove-tail
or swallow-tail. This tail fits into a notch
(Fig.
269
). The ancients employed double dove-tails
for joining stones together; this method of
construction was called
Opus

Revinctum
(q.v.).

Dove-tail Moulding
, Arch. (Norman; called
also
Triangular Frette
). Decorated with
running bands in the form of dove-tails.

Doves, the Eucharistic.
Sacred vessels of
gold, silver, gilded bronze, or ivory, in the
form of a dove, a tower, &c., which served as
receptacles for the reserved Host; they were
hung up in the middle of the
Ciborium
(q.v.).
At the Amiens Museum a dove of this kind is
to be seen dating from the 12th century, and at
the church of St. Nazaire at Milan there is
one of silver, gilded within and enamelled without,
which is also very ancient.

Dowlas
, O. E. Coarse linen cloth made in
Brittany; â
filthy dowlas!

, to hold
in the hand). A drachm, the principal silver
coin of the Greeks. There were two kinds of

drachmata
, which differed in value: the Attic
drachm and the Ãginetan. The Attic
drachma

was equal in value to a franc, equal to six
oboloi
.
The piece of four drachmas was called a
stater
.
As a weight the drachma was the eighth of an

uncia
; about = our modern
drachm
.

Draco
, Gen. (1) A dragon; the ensign of the
Roman cohort in the time of Trajan, adopted from
the Parthians. (2) A fantastic animal of Pagan
mythology: the garden of the Hesperides, the
Golden Fleece, and the fountain of Castalia were
all guarded by dragons. (3) In Christian
archÃ¦ology the dragon symbolizes sin, especially
idolatry. (4) The Chinese give to several immortals
the figure of a dragon. They distinguish
the long dragon of heaven, a being especially
sacred; the Kau, dragon of the mountain;
and the Li, dragon of the sea. The dragons
are represented as âgigantic saurians, with
powerful claws, and terminated by a frightful
head, scaly and strongly toothed.â There are
the scaly dragon, the winged dragon, the horned
and the hornless dragons, and the dragon
rolled within itself which has not yet taken
flight to the upper regions. In their zodiacal
system the dragon is the sign for the month of
March. (See
Tchy
.)

Draconarius
, R. The standard-bearer who
carried the
draco
.

Dracontarium
, R. A band for the head, so
called because it was twisted in imitation of the

Fig. 271. Dresden milk-jug.

Dresden Porcelain
, made at the Royal
Manufactory established at Meissen in Saxony
in 1709, is most excellent anterior to 1796,
since when its ancient perfection has been lost.
The mark of the best period is two crossed
swords, with a sloped cross or a small circle
beneath. The later mark has a star beneath
the swords. On rejected pieces the swords
were cut across with a line; but the manufactory
at the present day counterfeits its old
marks. Fig.
271
is a specimen of the best
period, later than 1720 and before 1778.

Fig. 272. Pot-pourri vase, Dresden china.

Dressoir
or
Dressouer
(the
buffet
of the
15th century, the
Ã©vidence
of the 16th) was the
principal object of the dining-room, on which
were displayed all the ornamental plate of the
owner of the house, costly vases, &c. Kings
had often three dressers, one for silver, another
for silver-gold, and the third for gold plate. In
form they varied; but they were made of the
most valuable woods, and enriched with the
finest carving. They were sometimes covered
over with cloth of gold: the city of Orleans
offered one in gold to Charles IV., which was
valued at 8000 livres Tournois.

Drilbu
, Hind. A bell used in Buddhist worship.

Drinking-cups of Glass
are frequently found
in the Saxon barrows or graves in England.
They are ornamented in various patterns, and

They used horn cups also, as did the Normans.
In the 15th century flat-shaped cups or bowls
were used.

Drip
, Arch. The edge of a roof; the eaves;
the corona of a cornice.

(Monuments), Celt. Celtic monuments,
also known by the name of
Megalithic
.
(See
Standing stones
,
Dolmens
,
Menhirs
,

Cromlechs
, &c.). The most ancient and probably
the largest Celtic or Druidical temple
was at Avebury in Wiltshire.
Dr. Stukeley
,
who surveyed it in 1720, says that âthis may
be regarded as the grand national cathedral,
while the smaller circles which are met with in
other parts of the island may be compared to
the parish or village churches.â

Drum
, Arch. (1) Of a dome or cupola, the

Stylobate
(or vertical part on which the
columns rest). (2) Of the Corinthian and
Composite capitals, the solid part; called also

Bell
,
Vase
,
Basket
.

Dry Point.
Direct engraving upon copper
with the sharp etching-needle itself, without the
plate being covered with etching-ground, or the
lines bit in by acid. This method produces very
soft and delicate work, but it is not so durable
in printing as the etched line.

Dryers.
In painting, substances imparted
to oils to make them dry quickly. The most
general in use is
OXIDE
of
LEAD
, but white
copperas, oxide of manganese, ground glass,
oxide of zinc, calcined bones, chloride of lime,
and verdigris have all been used at various times.

Drying Oil.
Boiled oil, used in painting
as a vehicle and a varnish. It is linseed oil
boiled with litharge (or oxide of lead).

Dryness.

Fig. 273. Dukeâs coronet.

Duke
, Her. The highest rank and title
in the British
peerage; first
introduced by
Edward III.
in the year
1337, when
he created the
Black Prince
the first English
duke (in
Latin âduxâ). The coronet of a duke, arbitrary
in its adornment until the 16th century was far
advanced, is now a circlet, heightened with eight
conventional strawberry-leaves, of which in representation
three and two half-leaves are
shown. (
Boutell.
)

Dulcimer.
A musical instrument, the prototype
of our pianoforte. It was very early
known to the Arabs and Persians, who called it

santir
. One of its old European names is the

cimbal
. The Hebrew
nebel
, or perhaps the

psanterin
mentioned by Daniel, is supposed to
have been a dulcimer; the
psalterion
of the
Greeks also. A hand organ of the Middle Ages
was called a dulcimer.

Dunkirk.
A manufactory of modern faience
which only existed for a short time in the 18th
century, and was closed within a year. The
works are therefore very rare. Jacquemart
mentions a clock bearing a close resemblance
to certain Dutch products, inscribed
Dickhoof

and
A. Duisburg
, and by the latter name
identified as Dunkirk work.

Duns
, Celtic. Ancient hill forts of the simplest
kind, consisting of a round or oval earthen

Fig. 274. EagleâEnsign of France.

Eagle
, Her. The eagle (called in heraldry

Alerion
) appears in
the earliest English
examples of arms,
and his appearance
often denotes an
alliance with German
princes. Both
the German emperors
and Russian
czars adopted
the eagle for their
heraldic ensign in
support of their
claim to be considered
the successors
of the
Roman CÃ¦sars. The eagle borne as the ensign
of Imperial France sits, grasping a thunderbolt,
in an attitude of vigilance, having its
wings elevated, but the tips of the feathers
drooping, as they would be in a living bird. In
remote antiquity the eagle was an emblem of
the sun, and the double-headed eagle typifies the
rising and the setting sun. The eagle was the
attribute of Jove as his messenger. The eagle
killing a serpent or a hare is an ancient symbol
of victory. In Christian art the eagle is the attribute
of St. John the Evangelist, the symbol of
the highest inspiration. St. John is sometimes
represented with human body and eagle head.
The lectern in Christian churches is commonly
in the form of an eagle. Elisha the prophet is
represented with a two-headed eagle. (See

AquilÃ¦
.)

Fig. 275. Earlâs coronet.

Earl
, Her. (from the Gaelic
iarflath
, âa
dependent chiefâ =
iar
, âafter,â and
flath
,
âlordâ; pronounced
iarrl
). Before 1337 the highest,
and now the
third degree of rank
and dignity in the
British peerage. An
earlâs coronet has
eight lofty rays of
gold rising from the
circlet, each of
which supports a
large pearl, while between each pair of these
rays there is a golden strawberry-leaf. In representation
five of the rays and pearls are shown.
Elevated clusters of pearls appear in an earlâs
coronet as early as 1445; but the present form
of the coronet may be assigned to the second
half of the following century.

Earl Marshal.
In England, one of the great
officers of state, who regulates ceremonies and
takes cognizance of all matters relating to
honour, arms, and pedigree.

Early English Architecture.
The first of
the pointed or Gothic styles of architecture used
in England. It succeeded the
Norman
towards
the end of the 12th century, and gradually
merged into the
Decorated
at the end of the
13th. Its leading peculiarity is the long narrow
lancet window.

Earn

exotic woods came into general use in Europe
from the end of the 17th centuryâsubsequently
to 1695, when the Dutch settled in Ceylon. The
black ebony is the most valuable, but there are
green and yellow varieties. Old carved ebony
furniture found in English houses dates generally
from the early years of the Dutch occupation
of Ceylon.

crest
on his head.

Egyptian Architecture
and
Sculpture
can be
studied in the monuments remaining from remotest
antiquity to about
A. D.
300. Great varieties
of style occur, which can be easily attributed to
their respective periods by the hieroglyphical
inscriptions. The three primitive motives of
all Egyptian buildings are the
pyramid
,
caves
,
and
structures of timber
; all contemporary with
the most ancient relics. In sculpture, the most
ancient works of all are also those most remarkable
for fidelity to nature. The conventionality introduced
afterwards with the
canon of proportions
is
still combined with a close imitation of Nature
in the details. The Grecian or Ptolemaic period
begins
B.C.
322. [See
Wilkinsonâs Ancient
Egyptians
,
Caninaâs Egyptian Architecture
; and
the works of
Brugsch
,
Marriette
,
Soldi
,
Ebers
, &c.]

Egyptian Blue
, the brilliant blue pigment
found on the monuments,
is found by
analysis to consist of
the hydrated protoxide
of copper,
mixed with a minute
quantity of iron. The
green colour was derived
from another
oxide of copper; violet
from manganese
or gold; yellow from
silver, or perhaps
iron; and red from
the protoxide of copper.

Fig. 280. Lenticular Phials. Louvre Museum.

Fig. 279. Oviform bottle. Egyptian.

Egyptian Pottery

of great beauty is
found in great quantities
along with the
costly ornaments
in the tombs. It is
intermediary between
porcelain and stone-ware,
and its colouring
demonstrates a
high degree of skill,
science, and precision of execution. Among
the forms frequently found are the oviform,
long-necked bottles (Fig.
279
), lenticular phials,
with royal cartouches (Fig.
280
), lamps (Fig.

281
), &c. (See also Fig.
219
.)

Electrotint.
A method of preparing engraved
copper plates for the printing-press by
the electrotype process. (See
Art Journal
, 1850.)

Electrotype.
The process whereby works in
relief are produced by the agency of electricity,
through which certain metals, such as gold,
silver, and copper, are precipitated from their
solutions upon moulds in so fine a state of
division as to form a coherent mass of pure
metal, equal in toughness and flexibility to the
hammered metals. (
Fairholt.
) At the present
day electrotypes are generally taken from engravings
on wood for printing from.

Electrum
(
á¼¤Î»ÎµÎºÏÏÎ¿Î½
). In Homer and Hesiod
this word means
amber
. Pliny says that when
gold contains a fifth part of silver, it is called
electrum. Its colour was whiter and more
luminous than that of gold, and the metal was
supposed to betray the presence of poison.
Specimens are rare. A beautiful vase of electrum
is preserved in the St. Petersburg Museum.
Some coins in electrum were struck by the
kings of Bosporus, and by Syracuse and some
Greek states.

Elements
, Chr. The bread and the wine in
the Lordâs Supper. In the Eastern liturgies
the unconsecrated elements are called âthe

Mysteries
,â and the bread alone the
Seal

(
ÏÏÏÎ±Î³á½¶Ï
), from its being divided by lines in the
form of a cross. The interesting subject of the
composition and form of the elements in the
early churches is fully discussed in the âDictionary
of Christian Antiquitiesâ (Smith and
Cheetham).

Elemine.

consistency to the varnish which forms part of
the composition of lacquer.

Elenchus
, R. (
á¼Î»ÎµÎ³ÏÎ¿Ï

Crotalium
.) (2) An index to a book.

Elephant.
In mediÃ¦val heraldry this animal
is a symbol of piety, from an ancient legend,

Eleusinian Mysteries.
The holiest and most
venerated of the Greek festivals. The Lesser
Eleusinia, held at AgrÃ¦ in the month Anthesterion,
were a preparation for the Greater,
which were celebrated at Athens and Eleusis.
The
MystÃ¦
were the initiated at the Lesser, of
which the principal rite was the sacrifice of a
sow, previously purified by washing in the Cantharus.
The Greater were celebrated every year
in the month Boedromion, and lasted nine days.
On the first day the MystÃ¦ assembled at Athens;
on the second they went through a ceremony of
purification at the sea-coast; the third was a
day of fasting; on the fourth there was a procession
of a waggon drawn by oxen, followed
by women who had small mystic cases in their
hands; on the fifth, or torch day, the MystÃ¦
went in the evening with torches to the temple
of Demeter, where they passed the night; on
the sixth, which was the most solemn of all, a
statue of Iacchos, the son of Demeter, was
borne in procession to Eleusis, and the MystÃ¦
were there initiated in the last mysteries
during the following night. There was something
in the secrets of this part of the ceremony
which excited greatly the imagination of the
ancient writers, especially Christians, who describe
them âin an awful and horrible manner.â
Each of the initiated was dismissed by the

mystagogus
with the words
Îºá½¹Î³Î¾, á½Î¼ÏÎ±Î¾
. On
the next day they returned to Athens, and
resting on the bridge of Cephisus engaged in a
contest of ridicule with the passers-by: the
eighth and ninth days were unimportant.

Eleutheria.
A Greek festival in honour of
Zeus Eleutherios (the Deliverer).

Elevati
of Ferrara. One of the Italian
literary academies. Their device was from the
fable of Hercules and AntÃ¦us, with the motto
from Horace, â
Superat tellus, sidera donat
â
(Earth conquers us, but gives us Heaven).

Elevation.
(1) In Architecture, &c., a perpendicular
plan drawn to a scale. (2) In
Christian archÃ¦ology, the
lifting up
of the
elements at certain points in the Eucharistic service,
universally prescribed in the early Oriental
liturgies, and introduced into the Western
Church with the doctrine of transubstantiation.

Fig. 282. Bas-relief from the frieze of the Parthenon. One of the Elgin Marbles.

Elgin Marbles.
Friezes and metopes from
the Parthenon at Athens, brought to the
British Museum by Lord Elgin. They are
adorned with sculptures in relief; those on the
frieze represent the Panathenaic procession in
honour of Athena; those on the metopes, chiefly
the contests of the Centaurs and LapithÃ¦. There
are also statues and friezes, especially from the
temple of the Wingless Victory and the
Choragic
Monument
of Lysicrates. They are
admirably described by Mr. Newton in his
âGuideâ to these sculptures published by the
authorities of the British Museum. (Fig.

Fig. 283. Great Seal of Queen Elizabeth.

Elizabeth, Queen.
The costume and the
royal appurtenances of this monarch are well
illustrated by the Royal Seal. In the Royal Arms
we see the lions and the lilies (
France modern
and England quarterly
). On the reverse (Fig.

284
) the Tudor Rose, fleur-de-lis, and harp
appear separately crowned for England,
France, and Ireland. Elizabeth was fond
of allegory and devices. In her portrait
by Zoffany âthe lining of her robe is
worked with eyes and ears, and on her
left sleeve is embroidered a serpentâall
to imply wisdom and vigilance.â In her
other hand is a rainbow with the motto,
â
Non sine sole iris
â (no rainbow without
the sun).

Fig. 284. Great Seal of Queen Elizabeth.

Elizabethan.

crustÃ¦
for this kind
of work. From
Emblemata
is derived
our word
Emblem
, the true meaning of
which is âa symbolical figure or composition
which conceals an allegory.â Thus
an

pelican

piety, and the Redeemerâs love for the world.

Fig. 286. Indian Embroidery. In the Indian section of the South Kensington Museum.

Embroidery
is one of the oldest of the ornamental
arts. Some specimens of ancient
Egyptian

embroidery are exhibited in the Louvre, and
Herodotus mentions the embroidered vestments
of the gods in Egypt. The
Israelites
appointed
Aholiab, âa cunning workman, and an embroiderer
in blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
linen,â to be
chief embroiderer
to the sacred ark.
The prophet Ezekiel mentions the embroidery
of
Tyre
. It was the principal domestic occupation
of ladies in
Greece
, from the days when
Penelope embroidered a garment for Ulysses,
representing a dog chasing a deer. The
Romans

called embroidery âPhrygium,â and imported
it largely from the East. In later times
Byzantium

was celebrated for its embroidered ecclesiastical
vestments. Pope Paschal, in the 9th
century, was the greatest patron of the art.
When the Caliph Omar pillaged the
Persian

palace of Khosroes, he found there a carpet of
silk and cloth of gold, sixty cubits square, having
a garden depicted upon it, and rubies,
emeralds, sapphires, beryls, topazes, and pearls
arranged with consummate skill to represent
trees, fruit and flowers, rivulets, fountains, roses
and shrubs. Our English word âembroideryâ
is derived from the Celtic âbrouda,â to prick.
Anglo-Saxon embroidery was celebrated throughout
Europe as
Opus Anglicanum
. The celebrated
Bayeux tapestry is attributed to the 12th century.
A copy of it may be seen in the South Kensington
Museum. The art decayed in England
during the Civil War of the 17th century.

red
by gold, and
green
by copper.
Different kinds of enamel are (1) inlaid or incrusted.
(2) Transparent, showing designs on
the metal under it. (3) Painted as a complete
picture. âMany fine specimens of ancient
Chinese enamel were seen in the Exhibition of
1851. They have the enamel on copper, beautifully
coloured and enlivened with figures of
flowers, birds, and other animals. The
colouring is most chaste and effective.
The Chinese say that no good specimens of
this manufacture have been made for the
last six or eight hundred years.â (
Fortune.
)
Beautiful transparent enamels are
made in India.
They look like
slices of emerald
or sapphire laid
in beds of gold,
having tiny figures
of beaten gold let
into their surfaces.

Enamel.
Painting
in enamel is
done by means of
colours that are
vitrifiable, a quality
that is communicated
to them
by combining them with a vitreous base,
which is called their flux. These are
fused and fixed on the enamel by the
action of fire, which produces in the colours
applied such changes as the artist has previously
learned to calculate. (

then melted or fused with hot irons (
cauteria
),
a small fillet of a different tint being inserted
between each flat tint.â Fairholt says,

Etching.
In this process the copper plate
is covered with an
etching-ground
, which is
a preparation of beesâ-wax, Burgundy pitch,
black pitch, and asphaltum (or other ingredients);
and the lines of the design are traced
out with
etching-needles
, which remove the
etching-ground from the copper wherever they
pass, and slightly scratch the surface of the
plate. Next, a border of
banking-wax
is put
round the sides of the plate, making a trough of
it. The
banking-wax
is made of beesâ-wax,
common pitch, Burgundy pitch, and sweet oil
melted in a crucible and poured into cold
water. The next operation is to pour in nitrous
acid reduced with water to a proper strength
(about one part acid to four parts water).
When the acid has been on a sufficient time to
corrode the fainter parts of the subject, it is to
be poured off, the plate washed with water, and
left to dry. These fainter parts are then to be
varnished with a mixture called
stopping-ground
,
made of lamp-black and Venice turpentine,
applied with a camelâs-hair pencil. This stops
the further action of the acid on these parts.
When the surface is dry, fresh acid is poured on
to
bite in
the bolder parts, and the processes of

stopping
and
biting-in
are alternated for every
gradation of tint. The wax is removed from
the plate by heat, and cleaned away with a rag
moistened with olive oil; and the work is then
complete, or it may be finished off with the

graver
.
Etching-points
or
needles
resemble
common needles, fixed in handles four or five
inches long; some are made oval to produce
broader lines. The
dry point
is only a very
fine-pointed needle for the delicate lines. Imitations
of chalk and pencil drawings are sometimes
produced by
etching on soft ground
.

Etching on steel
is done in the same way as on
copper. For
etching on glass
, a ground of
beesâ-wax is laid on, and the design traced as
above. Sulphuric acid is then poured on, and
fluor-spar sprinkled on it, or fluoric acid may be
at once used; this is allowed to remain four or
five hours, and is then removed with oil of
turpentine. (See also
Stipple
,
Mezzotinto
,

Falx
, R. A scythe, sickle, bill-hook, &c.;
any instrument with a curved edge used for

,

fÃ¦naria
or
veruculata
,
vinitoria
,
vineatica
, and

Fig. 302. Feather FanâItalian.

Fan
, Egyp. With the
Egyptians
, the fan of
ostrich feathers for brushing away flies was
looked upon as the insignia of princes and chieftains;
the
flabellum
or
umbellum
(parasol) was
carried by inferior officers. Both kinds of fan
are frequently represented on the sacred barges.
The use of the fan was first introduced into
England in the 16th century; they were first
made of feathers with long handles of gold,
silver, or ivory of elaborate workmanship, and
sometimes inlaid with precious stones. The
engraving shows one from a portrait of Queen
Elizabeth. The
Greeks
and
Romans
had fans
of various elegant materials, often of peacockâs
feathers; sometimes of wings of birds, or of
linen stretched on a frame.
Italian
fans,
mediÃ¦val, were square flags, as in Fig.
303
.
Folding fans were first introduced in the 17th
century. Inventories of churches and monasteries
of the 14th century include ecclesiastical
fans or

. These are still used in the
Catholic Church in the East. An illumination
at Rouen represents the deacon raising the
flabellum, a circular fan with a long handle,
over the head of the priest at the altar. In the
accounts of the churchwardens of Walberswick,
Suffolk, of 1493, is the entry âfor a bessume of

and
tub-farthingales
. Farthingales
were worn during the reign of Charles I., but of

Flemish Lace.
Flanders and Italy dispute
the invention of pillow lace. It is certain, however,
that lace of home manufacture was worn
in the 15th century in the Low Countries, and

The engraving shows a fine specimen of
old Flemish lace composed of six different
designs joined together, commonly known as

France, was first adopted by Louis VII. (about

A. D.
1137)
semÃ©e
, or scattered over the field.
This shield is blazoned as âFrance Ancient.â
On the occasion of his marriage, in 1234,
St. Louis instituted the order of the âCosse de
Genestâ (Fig.

318
), and, as an
emblem of his
humility, took for
his badge the
broom-flower with
the motto
Exaltat
humiles
. The collar
of the order
was composed of
broom-flowers
enamelled, intermixed
with fleurs-de-lis.
In the
reign of Charles
VI. four collars
of the order of the
Cosse de Genest
were sent as
presents to King
Richard II. and
his uncles the Dukes of Lancaster, Gloucester,
and York. The fleur-de-lis entered the English
insignia in 1275 with the marriage of Edmund
with Blanche of Artois, and was erased on
January 1, 1801.

Fluor-spar
or

. A mineral
rock very common in Derbyshire, where it is

Flute
, Gen. Said to have been invented by
Apollo or Mercury. The simplest form of flute
was made with an oat-stalk (
avena
) or a hollow
reed (
calamus
); in the course of time it was
made of ivory, bone, or the shin-bones of
animals; whence its
Latin name of
Tibia

(q.v.). The Greek
flute (
aulos
) was held
like a flageolet, and a
vibrating reed was inserted
into the mouthpiece.
The single flute
was called
monaulos
;
the double one
diaulos
.
A specimen of the
last in the British
Museum was found in
a tomb at Athens.
It is made of cedar,
and the tubes, which
are fifteen inches in
length, have each a
separate mouthpiece and six finger-holes, five of
which are at the upper side, and one underneath.
The flutes of the
Etruscans
were often
of ivory; those used in religious ceremonies
were of box-wood,
assâs bone, bronze,
and silver. The
Persian

flute called
â
nay
,â and the
â
surnay
â a kind
of oboe, are still
popular in the East.
In
Mexico
, the young
man sacrificed to the
god was taught to
play the flute, and
as he went to his
death he broke a
flute on each of
the steps of the
temple. The practice
of making flutes
of the bones of their enemies was common with
many Indian tribes in America.

Fig. 321. Foliage of the Acanthus.

Foliage
, Gen.
Nearly every style
of architecture has
made use of foliage
for purposes of ornamentation.
In antiquity,
the leaves
of the acanthus,
palm, laurel, olive,
ivy, &c., were thus
employed; the Romano-Byzantine,
Byzantine,
and Pointed
styles utilized for
the same purpose the vine, oak, cinquefoil,
parsley, mahonia, mullein, thistle, &c. Foliage
has been applied to the decoration of capitals,
archivolts, bands, cornices, and friezes; and
it has also been used to form
Crockets
(q.v.),
crownings, pinnacles, &c. Architectural work
thus enriched is said to be
FOLIATED
, and the
ornament itself is called
FOLIATION
.

Fig. 322. Foliage on moulding.

ObscÅna
.)

Foolscap.
A foolâs cap was the device of the
Italian society called the Granelleschi, formed
at Venice in 1740 to oppose the corruption of
the Italian language. A sheet of foolscap paper
is 17 in. by 13Â½ in.

Forceps.
Tongs or pincers, the attributes of
some of the martyrs. (See

us by antiquity.
A
is the principal entrance;

B
, a Corinthian temple;

, the public prison
(
carcer publicus
);
D
is supposed to have been a
horreum, or public granary;
E
, the temple of
Venus, the guardian goddess of the city;

adapted for use as that procured from living
species.

Fote

Fresco-Painting
(i. e.
al fresco
, upon fresh or
wet ground), generally employed for large pictures
on walls and ceilings, is executed with
mineral and earthy pigments upon a freshly-laid
ground of stucco. It was known to the ancients,
and must be distinguished from
DISTEMPER
PAINTING
(q.v.) on plaster, which is a different
process. â
Buon
(or genuine)
fresco
,â painted
on the fresh surface of plaster, is distinguished
from â
fresco secco
,â or a process of painting on
dry plaster commonly practised in Italy and
Munich. It is argued that the latter was the
process used at Pompeii, and generally by the
ancients, because (1) lime is found in nearly all the
colours, and (2) the nature of the joinings in
the work indicates that each compartment does
not contain only one dayâs work, as it must
in
buon fresco
.

Frog.
An ancient emblem of silence and
secrecy, from a legend quoted by Ãlian that
the frogs of Syriapha never croak in their own

perfect preservation, is preserved at Pompeii.
The
fullones
acted as laundrymen to Greek and
Roman families, washing linen as well as
woollen clothes by treading in tubs (using urine
for soap, which was unknown to them); hence

saltus fullonicus

Funda, Sling
, Gen. The sling has been employed
by most of the peoples of antiquity as
a weapon of warfare for hurling stones, chiefly
flints or leaden bullets (

the Egyptians were made of leather thongs or
plaited cord. The
funaitores
, or slingers, of the
Greek and Roman armies carried each a provision
of stones in the folds (
sinus
) of his pallium,
a shield on his left arm, and brandished
his sling in the right hand. The most celebrated
slingers were the inhabitants of the Balearic
Islands, which took their ancient name from
this circumstance.

Funeral Ceremonies.
1. Greek. The expressions

Ïá½° Î´á½·ÎºÎ±Î¹Î±
,
Î½Î¿Î¼Î¹Î¶á½¹Î¼ÎµÎ½Î±
, or
ÏÏÎ¿Ïá½µÎºÎ¿Î½ÏÎ±
, the
just and lawful rites, are expressive of the Greek
idea that the proper burial of the dead was a
most sacred duty to them. The first act was
to place in the mouth of the corpse an
obolus
,
with which the spirit would pay the ferryman
in Hades. This coin was then called
danakÃ©
.
The body was then washed and anointed,
the head crowned with flowers, and the handsomest
robes put on. All this was done by the
women of the family. By the side of the bed
upon which the corpse was then laid (
ÏÏá½¹Î¸ÎµÏÎ¹Ï
)
were placed painted earthen vessels (
lecuthoi
;
see
Lecythus
), which were afterwards buried
with the corpse. (These vases are frequently
disinterred in modern excavations.) A honeycake
(
melittouta
) to throw to the dog Cerberus
was laid on the bed. Before the door a vessel
of water (
ostracon
or
ardalion
) was set, to be
used, like the holy water of Catholic times, by
persons
leaving
the house, for purification. On
the third day after death, the
ecphora
, or carrying
out for burial, took place in the morning
before sunrise. The men walked before the
corpse, and the women behind. Hired mourners
(
threnodoi
) accompanied the procession, playing
mournful tunes on the flute. The bodies were
either buried or burned, until cremation gave
way to a Christian prejudice. The body was
placed for burning on the top of a
pyre
(Gr.

Ïá¿¦Ï
, fire); and, in remote ages, animals,
prisoners, or slaves were burned with it. Oils
and perfumes were thrown into the flames.
Finally, the smouldering ashes were quenched
with wine, and relatives and friends collected
what remained of the bones. The bones were
then washed with wine and oil, and placed in
urns, often golden.

2. Roman.
Funera justa
conveys the same
idea as the Greek
dicaia
of the right and title
of the dead to a proper observance. With the
Romans, the washing, anointing, &c. of the
body was done by slaves (
pollinctores
) of the
undertakers, who were called
libitinarii
, because
they dwelt near the temple of Venus
Libitina, in which all things requisite for funerals
were sold and a mortuary register was kept.
The coin having been duly placed in the mouth,
the body was laid out in the vestibule dressed,
of ordinary citizens in a white toga, and of
magistrates in their official robes, and the couch
was strewn with flowers, and a branch of
cypress

was placed at the door of the house. All funerals
were, in ancient times, performed at night,
but afterwards only those of the poor. At a
great funeral the corpse was carried out on
the eighth day, preceded by musicians (
cornicines
,
&c.) and mourning women (
prÃ¦ficÃ¦
), who
chanted a funeral hymn (
nÃ¦nia
); players and
buffoons (
histriones
,
scurrÃ¦
) followed, and a
procession of the freed slaves wearing the cap
of liberty (
pileati
). Images of the deceased and
of his ancestors were borne before the corpse,
which was carried on a litter (
feretrum
). The
common bier of the poor was called
sandapila
,
and its bearers
vespillones
, because they bore it
forth in the evening (
vespere
). The couches of
the rich were of ivory, richly ornamented with
gold and purple. The relations walked behind
in mourning, sons with the head veiled, and
daughters with dishevelled hair. At the forum
a funeral oration (
laudatio
) was delivered, and
thence the procession went to the place of
burial or cremation. Those who were buried
(as all were subsequently to the 4th century

A. D.
) were placed in a coffin (
arca
or
loculus
),
often of stone. The Assian stone, from Assos
in Troas, was said to consume all the body,
with the exception of the teeth, in forty days,
whence it was called sarcophagus (q.v.). For
cremation the pyre, or
rogus
, was built like an
altar, and the corpse in its splendid couch being
placed on the top, the nearest relation, with
averted face, fired a corner of the pile. Perfumes
were forbidden by the Twelve Tables.
Sometimes animals were slaughtered, and in
ancient times, captives and slaves, but afterwards
gladiators were hired to fight round the blazing
pile. (Compare
Bustum
.) When the pyre
was burnt down, the embers were soaked with
wine, and the bones and ashes collected into
urns. (See
Urna
.) The solemnities continued
for nine days after the funeral, at the end of
which time a sacrifice was performed called the

novemdiale
. Men wore
black
for mourning, and
women white; but at all banquets given in honour
of the dead the guests were clothed in white.

Fur.

Strutt
says that âthe furs of sables,
beavers, foxes, cats, and lambs were used in
England before the Conquest; to which were
afterwards added those of ermines, squirrels,
martens, rabbits, goats, and many other animals.â
In the Middle Ages the more precious furs, as
ermine and sable, were reserved for kings,
knights, and the principal nobility of both sexes.
Inferior ranks used âvairâ and âgris,â or
gray; while citizens, burgesses, and priests wore
the common squirrel and lamb-skins. The
peasants wore cat-skins, badger-skins, &c. In
after times were added the skins of badgers,
bears, beavers, deer, fitches, foxes, foynes (or
martens), grays, hares, otters, sables, squirrels,
weasels, wolves, &c. The mantles of our kings
and peers, and the furred robes of municipal
officers are the remains of this fashion, which in
the 13th century was almost universal.

Garnet.
This gem, on account of its brilliant
colour and hardness, is much used in jewellery,

Jerusalem below Mount Zion, is a place called
Tophet, where children were sacrificed to

their feet covered with scales. A beautiful
cameo in the Naples Museum represents Jove
in his chariot subduing the giants. In 1875 the

They were frequently made entirely of gold or
silver, decorated with cameos, precious stones,
&c. Besides the knightly sword; the purse,
dagger, rosary, or penner and ink-horn and other
objects were suspended from the girdle. From
this word the waist was called the
girdlestead
, or
place (
sted
) of the girdle. The girdles of ladies
were equally splendid, and frequently depended
nearly to the ground, as in Fig.
355
. The
girdle is an attribute of St. Thomas, from a
legend that the Virgin, pitying his weakness
of faith, threw down to him her girdle, after

Gladiators
were first exhibited at Rome,
B.C.

264, at a funeral. The practice had its origin
in that very ancient one of slaughtering slaves
and captives on such occasions. Subsequently
it became more general. The different classes
of gladiators, distinguished by their arms and
other circumstances, were:
AndabatÃ¦
, who wore
helmets without any opening for the eyes, and
therefore fought blindfold;
Essedarii
, who
fought from chariots (
EssedÃ¦
);
Hoplomachai
,
who wore heavy defensive armour;
Laqueatores
,
who carried a sort of lasso or noose;
Meridiani
,
who fought in the middle of the day, and were
very slightly armed;
Mirmillones
, so called
from their having the image of a fish (mormyr)
on their helmets;
Retiarii
, armed with a trident
and a net. Others, as
Samnites
,
Thraces
, &c.,
were named from the nation whose fashion of
armour they adopted. The fights of gladiators
were favourite subjects of Roman art, and it is
assumed that in cases where no actual combats
took place at a funeral, they were represented
on the walls of tombs in sculpture or paint.
The most celebrated statues of the kind are the
so called âDying Gladiatorâ in the museum
of the capitol at Rome, and the Gladiator of
the Borghese collection.

Fig. 358. Venetian Glass Vase, 16th century.

Glass.
The discovery is lost
in remote antiquity. Pliny
gives a legend which ascribes
it to chance. Glass bottles
in Egypt are represented upon monuments
of the 4th dynasty (at least 2000 years
B.C.
).
A vase of greenish glass found at Nineveh
dates from
B.C.
700. Glass is found in the
windows at Pompeii; and the Romans stained
it, blew it, worked it on lathes, and engraved
it. Pliny mentions, as made by the
Romans in his time, glass coloured opaque,
red, white, black (like
obsidian
), or imitating
jacinths, sapphires, and other gems; also

murrhine glass
. This last was either an imitation
of fluor-spar, or a kind of agate, or fluor
spar. The Romans also made
mosaic
or
millefiori
,
in which the threads of colour are melted
into a rod, so that at every section the whole
pattern appears; and
cameo glasses
, in which a
paste of one colour is laid over another, and the
whole then carved into the required design;

gold leaf
was also worked into the substance or
fixed on the surface. A gate at Constantinople
took its name from the glass works near it, but
little is known of the Byzantine art, nor of
earlier European art than the 13th century. In
mediÃ¦val times stained glass windows, in leaden
frames, were constructed with great success in
England, France, and Flanders. In the 13th
century they appear in Italy. The Venetian
art took its impulse from the capture of Constantinople
in 1204. Its peculiar beauty is derived
from the curved forms and tenuity of substance
obtained in blowing. (Fig.
358
.) There are
six kinds of Venetian glass. (1) Vessels of colourless
or
transparent glass
, or of single colours, generally
blue or purple. (2)
Gilt
or
enamelled glass
.
(3)
Crackled glass
, having a surface rough and
divided irregularly into ridges. (4) Variegated
or
marbled opaque glass
, called
schmeltz
; the
most common variety is a mixture of green and
purple, sometimes resembling jasper, sometimes
chalcedony; other varieties are imitations
of lapis lazuli and tortoise-shell;
and
avanturine
, which is
obtained by mingling metallic filings
or fragments of gold leaf with
melted glass. (5)
Millefiori
, or

mosaic glass
, in imitation of the
old Roman process. (6)
Reticulated
,

filigree
, or
lace glass
. The varieties
contain fine threads of glass, generally
coloured, but sometimes milk-white,
included in their substance.
The lightness and strength of the
Venetian glass are due to its not
containing lead like our modern
flint glass. Venetian
mirrors
were
for a long period widely celebrated.
The oldest example of the German

drinking-cups
, ornamented with
paintings in enamel, is of the date
of 1553. The designs are commonly
armorial bearings. From
the beginning of the 17th century
the Bohemian manufactories supplied

vases
enriched with ornamental
subjects, particularly with
portraits engraved upon the glass.
The art of
wheel engraving upon
glass
flourished in France under
Louis XVI. In modern times this
kind of ornamentation is produced
by the agency of hydrofluoric acid.
âCoarse glass-making in England
was, in Sussex, of great antiquity.â
(
Fuller.
) âThe first making of
Venice glasses in England began in
London, about the beginning of
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by one
Jacob Vessaline, an Italian.â (
Stow.
)

Glass-glazed Wares.
(See
Glazed
Wares
.)

Î³Î»Î±Ï
Îºá½¹Ï
). Of a sea-green
colour, or a greyish blue.

Fig. 359. Flemish stone-ware Cruche, 17th century.

Glazed Wares.
Almost immediately after the
invention of Ceramic manufacture, the application
of
glaze
or
coloured enamel
must have improved
it. What we term
glaÃ§ure
is a light varnish
which enlivens and harmonizes the porous
surface of terra-cotta. In its simple state it is
a mixture of silex and lead, and in this state it
is transparent, as we find it on
antique vases
;
when vitrifiable, and mixed with tin, as in the
case of
majolicas
, it is called enamel; and when
of vitrifiable and earthen substance, such as can
only be melted at the temperature required for
the baking of the paste itself, it is known as

Glaze
, or
couverte
, and can be identified in the
Persian faiences and Flemish stone-ware. (Figs.
359, 360.) (See
Burty
,
Chefs-dâÅuvre of the
Industrial Arts
.)

Fig. 360. German enamelled stone-ware Cruche, date first half of the 16th century.

Glazing.
In oil painting, the application of
thin layer of colour to finally modify the tone.
In pottery, a vitreous covering over the surface.
(See
Glazed Wares
.)

, held in the hand, is the emblem of
power.

Globus
, R. A military manÅuvre employed
by a body of Roman soldiers when surrounded
by superior forces; it consisted in forming a
circle facing in every direction.

Fig. 361. Glory. Vesica Piscis in Ely Cathedral.

Glory
,
Nimbus
or
Aureole
, the Christian
attribute of sanctity, is of pagan origin, common
to images of the gods, and Roman, even
Christian, emperors. Satan in miniatures of
the 9th to 13th century wears a glory. The
earliest known Christian example is a gem of
St. Martin of the early part of the 6th century.
The glory round the head is properly the nimbus
or aureole. The oblong glory surrounding the
whole person, called in Latin âvesica piscisâ (Fig.

361
), and in Italian the âmandorlaâ (almond) from
its form, is confined to figures of Christ and the
Virgin, or saints who are in the act of ascending
into heaven. When used to distinguish one of the
three divine Persons of the Trinity, the glory
is often cruciform or triangular: the square
nimbus designates a person living at the time
the work was executed. In other instances it is
circular. Coloured glories are variously symbolical.

and Legendary Art
.â)

Gloves.
In the 14th century already
gloves

were worn, jewelled on the back, as a badge of
rank. âThey were worn in the hat,â says
Steevens, âas the favour of a mistress, or the
memorial of a friend, and as a mark to be challenged
by an enemy.â A glove of the 17th century
is described âof a light buff leather,
beautifully ornamented with spangles and
needlework in gold and silver threads, with a
gold lace border, and silk opening at the
wrist.â Gloves were called âcheirothecÃ¦,â
hand-coverers, by the Greeks and Romans;
they were made without separate fingers, the
thumb only being free. A legend current at
Grenoble affirms that St. Anne, the mother
of the Virgin Mary, was a knitter of gloves.

Fig. 362. Egyptian Diadem of gold and lapis lazuli of the ancient Empire, found in the tomb of Queen Aah-Hotep.

Gold.
It is probable that the earliest recorded
mark upon units of value was the image of a
sheep or an ox; hence money in Latin is called

pecunia
, from
pecus
, cattle, the original form of
barbaric wealth, for which gold was the substitute.
The wealth of Abraham in silver and
gold, as well as in cattle, is mentioned in
Genesis. No coins of gold or silver have been
found in
Egypt
or
Nineveh
, although beautiful
specimens of the goldsmithâs art have been
recovered from the tombs of both countries.
The
Hebrews
, taught by the Egyptians, made
their ark, mercy-seat, altar of incense, seven-branched
candlestick, and other golden ornaments,
even in the desert of Sinai. The seven-branched
candlestick is represented in sculpture on the
arch of Titus at Rome. At
Babylon
and

Nineveh
gold is said to have been lavishly
applied in gilding sculpture, and even walls;
but it is suggested that an alloy of copper, the

aurichalcum
of the Greeks, was the metal in
reality used for this purpose. The heroes of
the Greek epic had golden shields and
helmets; breastplates and other large
pieces of golden armour are among the
recent discoveries at MycenÃ¦; at Kourioum
in the island of Cyprus also great stores of
golden ornaments of a very early age have
been discovered. In
Scythian
tombs in
Russia also, about Kertch, beautiful relics
of Grecian work in gold have been found,
showing that in the very earliest ages the
skill and taste applied to this art were not
less than those of later times. The gold
jewellery of ancient India also excelled that
of modern date, but none, before or since,
ever equalled the great age of
Greek
art.
Pausanias describes a statue of Athene,
made by Pheidias, and kept in the Parthenon
at Athens, of ivory and goldâ
chryselephantine
âdelicately
worked all over; and
a still larger statue of Jupiter, of the
same materials. Native gold alloyed with one-fifth
silver was greatly prized by the Greek artists,
who gave it the name of
electrum
. Examples of
this electrum are rare; there is a vase at St. Petersburg.
The
Romans
used to pay enormous
prices for their household plate; for an example,
the bowl of Pytheas, on which were
represented Ulysses and Diomed with the palladium,
fetched 10,000 denarii, or about 330
l.

per ounce
. Few specimens of Roman art have
escaped destruction. (Fig.
7
.) Of the age of

Byzantine
splendour we are told that the
Emperor Acadius, early in the 5th century, sat
on a throne of massive gold, his chariot being
also of gold, &c. In the 9th century the
throne of Theophilus was overshadowed by a
tree of gold, with birds in the branches, and at
the foot two lions all gold. The lions roared
and the birds piped in the branches. A remarkable
wealth of ancient goldsmithâs work has been
found in
Ireland
, consisting principally of
personal ornaments. In the 9th and 10th centuries
the Irish workmanship was unsurpassed in
Europe. It consisted principally of objects for
religious use, and is characterized by a filagree
of extraordinary richness, akin to the intricate
traceries of the Irish illuminated work on MS. of
the same date and derivation. In the 10th and
11th centuries there was a great revival of art
throughout Europe. In
Germany
, the abbey of
Hildesheim, under Bishop Bernward, became
the centre of a school of goldsmiths, and some
beautiful specimens of hammered gold, by the
bishopâs hand, are preserved.

Gold
, in Christian art. (See
Yellow
.)

Gold, Cloth of
, is mentioned in the Pentateuch,
and was common throughout the East in
all ages. It was originally wrought, not in
rounded wire but flat, as the Chinese, the
Indians, and the Italians (their
lama dâoro
)
weave it now. The early Roman kings wore
tunics of gold, and the Romans used it as a
shroud for burial. King Childeric,
A. D.
482,
was buried at Tournai in a mantle of golden
stuff. It was much favoured in England for
church vestments, and by royalty, especially by
Edward IV. and Henry VIII. and the nobility
of their time. (The different varieties are
described in their order. See

Golden Fleece.
An Order of Knighthood instituted
on the 10th of January, 1429, by Philip,
Duke of Burgundy. The
Collar
is composed
of double steels, interwoven with flint-stones,
emitting sparks of fire, at the end whereof
hangs on the breast a Golden Fleece. The fusils
are joined two and two together, as if they were
double BBâs (the cyphers of Burgundy). The

flint-stones
are the ancient arms of the Sovereigns
of Burgundy, with the motto â
Ante ferit
quam flamma micet
.â (See Fig.
342
.) The
motto of the Order is â
Pretium non vile laborum
.â
There are four great officers, viz. the Chancellor,
Treasurer, Register, and a King of Arms, called

Toison dâOr
. The
Badge
consists of a Golden
Fleece, suspended from a flint-stone, which is
surrounded with flames of gold.

Golden Spur.
An Order of Knighthood
said to have been instituted by Pius IV., at
Rome, in 1559. They are sometimes spoken of

be distinguished from those who are created
knights on the coronation or marriage days of
Emperors and Kings, and who receive at the
same time the
Spurs of Honour

Hair.
The
Assyrian
monarchs are represented
with beard elaborately plaited, and hair
falling in ringlets on the shoulder, which may
have been partly artificial, like that of the
Persian monarchs, who, according to Xenophon,
wore a wig. Both the hair and beard were
dyed, and the eyes blackened with kohl, &c.
(
Layard.
) The
Egyptians
kept the head shaved,
and wore wigs and beard-boxes. The
Hebrews

generally wore the hair short, but the horse-guards
of King Solomon âdaily strewed their
heads with gold dust, which glittered in the
sun.â (
Josephus.
) The ancient
Greeks
wore
their hair long. The
Athenians
wore it long
in childhood, had it cut short at a solemn
ceremony when they became eighteen years of
age, and afterwards allowed it to grow, and
wore it rolled up in a knot on the crown of the
head, fastened with golden clasps (
crobylus
,

corymbus
). Women wore bands or coifs (
sphendone
,

kekryphalus
,
saccus
,
mitra
). Youths and
athletes are represented with short hair. The
favourite colour was blonde (
xanthus
); black
was the most common. The ancient
Romans

also wore long hair; about 300
B.C.
the practice
of wearing it short came in (
cincinnus
,

cirrus
). The Roman women anciently dressed
their hair very plainly, but in the Augustan
period adopted some extravagant fashions.
Each of the gods is distinguished by his peculiar
form of hair: that of Jupiter is long and flowing;
Mercury has close curling hair, &c. The
Danes
,

Gauls
, and
Anglo-Saxons
wore long flowing
hair, and the shearing of it was a punishment:
when Julius CÃ¦sar conquered the Gauls, he cut
off their long hair. Among the early
Frankish

kings long hair was the privilege of the blood
royal. From the time of
Clovis
the French
nobility wore short hair, but as they grew less
martial the hair became longer. FranÃ§ois I.
introduced short hair, which prevailed until the
reign of Louis XIII., which was followed by the
period of periwigs and perukes of Louis XIV.
The variations from the Conquest to the last
generation in
England
are so striking and frequent
that each reign may be distinguished by
its appropriate head-dress. (Consult
Fairholtâs
Costume in England
,
PlanchÃ©âs CyclopÃ¦dia of
Costume
, &c.)

with the uncut ends of the hair. (See

Fitch
.)

Halbert.

season when the king-fisher lays its eggs in nests
close by the brink of the sea; i. e. seven days
before and as many after the winter solstice.

âSeven winter dayes with peacefull calme possest

Alcyon
sits upon her floating nest.â

(
Sandyâs Ovid, Met.
b. xi.)

Hall-marks.
The Goldsmiths of London
formed their company in 1327, and were incorporated

in the order of their introduction, are as follows:â1.
The leopardâs head, called the kingâs
mark. 2. The makerâs mark, originally a

lionâs head
erased
, introduced in 1697 when the
standard was changed, and, 6, a figure of
Britannia substituted for the lion
passant

The name is derived from that of a famous
Italian comedian, who appeared in Paris in the
time of Henri III., and from frequenting the
house of M. de Harlay was so called by his

MÃ©nage
.)

Harmamaxa

and drawn by four horses, and richly ornamented.
It was principally used for women and children.

Harmonica.
A musical instrument consisting
of a number of glass cups fixed upon a revolving
spindle, and made to vibrate by friction applied
to their edges. These âmusical glassesâ are
described in a work published in 1677. A

harpsichord-harmonica
is a similar instrument,
in which finger-keys like those of a pianoforte
are used. (See the article in
Encyl. Brit.
,
8th edition.)

Harmonium.
A musical instrument having
a key-board like a pianoforte, and the sounds
(which resemble those of organ pipes) produced
by the vibration of thin tongues of metal.

Harp.
The
Egyptians
had various kinds of
harps, some of which were elegantly shaped and
tastefully ornamented. The name of the harp
was
buni
. Its frame had no front pillar. The
harps represented on the monuments varied in
size from 6Â½ feet high downwards, and had from
4 to 28 strings. A beautiful Egyptian harp, in
the Louvre collection, is of triangular shape with
21 strings, but, like all the harps represented on
the monuments, it has no fore-pillar. The
strings were of catgut.
Assyrian
sculptures also
represent harps. These also had no front pillar,
and were about 4 feet high, with ornamental
appendages on the lower frame. The upper
frame contained the sound-holes and the tuning-pegs
in regular order. The strings are
supposed to have been of silk. The
Greek

harp, called
kinyra
, resembled the Assyrian, and
is represented with 13 strings: it is an attribute
of Polyhymnia. The
Anglo-Saxons
called
the harp the
gleo-beam
, or âglee-wood;â and it
was their most popular instrument. King David
playing a harp is represented on an A.S. monument
of the 11th century. It was the favourite
instrument of the
German
and
Celtic
bards,
and of the
Scandinavian
skalds. It is represented
with 12 strings and 2 sound-holes, and
having a fore-pillar. A curious
Irish
harp of the
8th century, or earlier, is represented in Buntingâs
âAncient Music of Ireland,â having no
fore-pillar. The
Finns
had a harp (
harpu
,

kantele
) with a similar frame, devoid of a front
pillar. In
Christian art
a harp is the attribute
of King David and of St. Cecilia. St.
Dunstan is also occasionally represented with it.
In Heraldry the harp is the device and badge of
Ireland. The Irish harp of gold with silver
strings on a blue field forms the third quarter
of the royal arms.

Harpaga
,
Harpago
, Gr. and R. A general
term, including any kind of hook for grappling;
more particularly a military engine invented by
Pericles, and introduced into the Roman navy by
Duillius. It consisted of a joist about two yards
and a half long, each face of which was coated
with iron, and having at one end a harpoon of
iron or bronze; the other end was fitted with an
iron ring, to which a rope was attached, so as to
enable it to be drawn back when it had once
grappled a ship or its rigging.
Harpago
or
wolf

was the term applied to a beam armed with a
harpoon, which was employed to break down
the tops of walls, or widen a breach already
made. [A flesh-hook used in cookery to take
boiled meat out of the caldron.]

Harpastum
, R. A small ball employed for a
game in which the players formed two sides.
They stationed themselves at some distance from
a line traced on the ground or sand where the

harpastum
was placed. At a given signal each
player threw himself upon the ball, in order to
try and send it beyond the bounds of the opposite
party.

Harpies
, Gen. (
á¼ÏÏÏ
Î¹Î±Î¹
, i. e. the Snatchers).

Terra, three in number, viz.
AÃ«llo
(the tempest),

OcypetÃª
(swift-flying), and
CÃªlÃªno
; representing
the storm-winds. They had the faces of old
women, a vultureâs body, and huge claws; they
were the representatives of the Evil Fates, and
the rulers of storms and tempests. In Christian
iconography the Harpies symbolize the devil
and repentance. [In the so called âHarpy tombâ
in the British Museum they are represented
carrying off Camiro and Clytia, the daughters of
Pandarus of Crete, as a punishment for his
complicity with Tantalus in stealing ambrosia
and nectar from the table of the gods.]

Harpsichord.
A musical instrument intermediate
between the
spinet
,
virginals
, &c., and
the
pianoforte
, which supplanted it in the 18th
century. It may be described as a horizontal
harp enclosed in a sonorous case, the wires
being struck with jacks armed with crow-quills,
and moved with finger-keys.

Harquebus.

Fig. 379. HastaâRoman ceremonial spear.

Hasta
(Gr.
á¼Î³ÏÎ¿Ï
).
A spear used as a pike
for thrusting, or as a
missile for hurling from
the hand, or as a bolt
from an engine. Homer
defines the spear as âa pole heavy with
bronze.â The
hasta amentata
, for hurling,
had a leathern thong for a handle (
amentum
) in
the middle;
hasta pura
was a spear without a
head, and was a much-valued decoration given
to a Roman soldier who had saved a citizenâs
life;
hasta celibarium
was a spear which, having
been thrust into the body of a gladiator as he lay
dead in the arena, was afterwards used at marriages
to part the hair of the bride. A spear
was set up before a place where sales by auction
were going on, and an auction-room was hence
called
Hastarium
. Different
kinds of spear were the
lancea

of the Greeks; the
pilum
,
peculiar to the Romans; the

veru
,
verutum
, or âspit,â of
the Roman light infantry;
the
gÃ¦sum
, a Celtic weapon
adopted by the Romans; the

sparrus
, our English spar or

spear
, the rudest missile of
the whole class; and many
others mentioned under their
respective headings in this
work.

which sales were made
sub
hasta publica
, that is, by public auction, under
the public authority indicated by the spear. The

). The shaft of a spear, and
thence the spear itself, a goad, &c.

Fig. 380. Costume of a nobleman in Venice (16th century), showing the Hat of the period.

Hat
(A.S.
haet
, a covering for the head).
Froissart describes hats and plumes worn at
Edwardâs court in 1340, when the Garter order
was instituted. Hats were originally of a scarlet-red
colour, and made of âa fine kinde of haire
matted thegither.â A remarkable series of
changes in the fashion of hats is given in

PlanchÃ©âs EncyclopÃ¦dia of Costume
. Our illustration
represents a young Venetian noble of the
Middle Ages. (See also the illustrations to

soul
. The sun
(
Ra
) is likewise represented with a hawkâs head,
ornamented with the disk.

Fig. 382. Inscription, with hearts, found at Alise.

Heart.
On numerous Christian tombs hearts
maybe seen sculptured. Many archÃ¦ologists have
attempted to explain their meaning as symbols,
but without entering on an unprofitable discussion
of that question, it may be noticed that,
in many cases, what archÃ¦ologists have supposed
to be hearts were nothing but ivy-leaves,
which served as marks of separation between
different words or sentences. Fig.
382
represents
an inscription at Alise in which ivy-leaves
figure, together with an ornament which
some would insist were flames, if they were to
take the leaves for hearts. When inscriptions,
however, are defaced, the shape of the leaves
is not nearly so distinguishable as in the figure.
[One of the most frequent methods in which
this emblem is introduced in Christian art
is that the Saviour, or the Virgin Mary, is represented
opening the breast to display the
living heartâthe natural symbol of Love, Devotion,
or Sorrow. The Heart is an attribute
of St. Theresa, St. Augustine, and other saints.
The flaming heart is the emblem of charity.
The heart pierced by seven daggers symbolizes
the âseven sorrowsâ of Mary.]

Helm
,
Helmet

Now placed as an accessory
above a shield of
arms. Modern usage distinguishes
helms according
to the rank of the wearer.
The term
helm
was applied
by both Saxons and Normans,
in the 11th century,
to the conical steel cap
with a nose-guard, which
was the common head-piece
of the day, and is
depicted in contemporary
illuminations, sculptures, and tapestries. Afterwards
it was restricted to the
casque
, which
covered the whole head, and had an aventaile or
vizor for the face. The use of the
helm
finally
ceased in the reign of Henry VIII.

.)

Hemlock
, the

in Platoâs description
of the death
of Socrates.

MycenÃ¦, where the oxen were slaughtered, and
their flesh distributed to the citizens.

Herald
(Germ.
Herold
). An officer of arms.
The heralds of England were incorporated
by Richard III. The college now consists
of three kings of arms, six heralds, and four
pursuivants. The office of Earl Marshal, the
supreme head of the English heralds, is hereditary
in the family of the Duke of Norfolk.
There is another herald king styled âBath,â
who is specially attached to that order; he is
not a member of the college. The chief herald
of Scotland is styled Lord Lyon King of Arms;
that of Ireland, Ulster King of Arms.
Chester
herald
is mentioned in the reign of Richard II.,

Lancaster king of arms
under Henry IV. (See

Marshal
,
Kings of Arms
, &c.)

Heraldsâ College.
A college of heralds was
instituted in Rome by Numa Pompilius, and
the office was held sacred among the most
ancient Oriental nations. The institution was
imported into England in the Middle Ages
from Germany, a corporation of heralds, similar
to the
collegium fetialium
of Rome, having
been established in England in 1483 by Richard
III. (See
Pitiscus
, tom. i., and
Hofmann
,
tom. ii.)

HermÃ¦
, Gr. and R. (
á¼ÏÎ¼Î±á¿
). HermÃ¦, a
kind of pedestals surmounted only by the head,
or, in some cases, the bust of Hermes. Great
reverence was felt for these statues. Houses at
Athens had one before the doors; they were also
placed in front of temples, near tombs, at
street corners, or as mile-stones on the high roads.

Hermuli
, or small
HermÃ¦
, were a common ornament
of furniture, as pilasters and supports.
The same name is applied to similar statues
having a manâs head. This statue was probably
one of the first attempts of art at plastic representation.
The
phallus
and a pointed beard
originally were essential parts of the symbol.
In place of arms there were projections to hang
garlands on. Then a mantle was introduced
from the shoulders. Afterwards the whole torso
was placed above the pillar; and finally the
pillar itself was shaped into a perfect statue.
All these gradations of the sculptorâs art are
traceable in existing monuments.

HermÃ¦a.
Festivals of Hermes, celebrated
by the boys in the gymnasia, of which Hermes
was the tutelary deity.

HermeneutÃ¦
, Chr. (

, to carve). Characters of Egyptian
writing, the letters of which are figurative or
symbolic. There are three kinds of Egyptian
writing, the
hieroglyphic

the education of the Egyptians three styles of
writing are taught: the first is called the
epistolary (
enchorial
or
demotic
); the second
the
sacerdotal
(
hieratic
), which the sacred Scribes
employ; and the third the
hieroglyphic
. Other
nations, as for instance the ancient Mexicans,
have likewise employed hieroglyphics.

, Gr. and R. The Greek name
for an arena for horse and chariot races, in contradistinction
to the stadium, which served for
foot-racing. Fig.
386
represents the hippodrome
at Olympia, taken from Gellâs
Itinerary of the
Morea
. The following is the key to the plan:â1,
2, and 3 are
carceres
;
A
, the space included
between the stalls or
carceres
;
B
, starting-place
for the chariots;
C
, the colonnade;
D

Histrio.
An actor. The
Greek
dramas
were originally represented on the stage by
one performer, who represented in succession
the different characters. Ãschylus introduced
a second and a third actor. The actors
were all amateurs, and it was not until a
later period that the histrionic profession became
a speciality. Sophocles and Ãschylus
both probably acted their own plays. The

Roman
name for an actor,
histrio
, was formed
from the Etruscan
hister
, a dancer. The earliest

histriones
were dancers, and performed to the
music of a flute; then Roman youths imitating
them introduced jocular dialogue, and this was
the origin of the drama. After the organization
of the theatres, the
histriones
were subjected to
certain disabilities; they were a despised class,
and excluded from the rights of citizenship.
The greatest of
histriones
in Rome were Roscius
and Ãsopus, who realized great fortunes by
their acting.

Holy Bread
,
Holy Loaf
, or
Eulogia
(Lat.

blessed by the priest after mass, cut up into
small pieces and given to the people.

Holy-bread-skep

Fig. 388. Honiton Guipure.

Honiton Guipure.
Lace was made in Devonshire,
as well as in other parts of England, of
silk and coarse thread until 1567, when the
fine thread now used was introduced, it is said,
by Flemings, who had escaped from the persecutions
of the Duke of Alva. (See
Old Devonshire
.)
Honiton lace owes its great reputation
to the sprigs made separately on a pillow,
and afterwards either worked in with the
beautiful pillow net or sewn on it. This net
was made of the finest thread from Antwerp,
the price of which in 1790 was 70
l.
per pound.
(See
Mechlin Lace
, 18th century.) Heathcoatâs
invention, however, dealt a fatal blow to
the trade of the net-makers, and since then
Honiton lace is usually made by uniting the
sprigs on a pillow, or joining them with a needle
by various stitches, as shown in the engraving.

Honour
, Legion of. Instituted 3rd June,
1802, by Napoleon I. as first consul.

Hoodman-blind.

(A.S.
Hod
) were probably introduced
by the Normans. They are constantly represented,
with great variation of fashion, in illustrations
of the 11th to 18th century, as a part of
the costume of both sexes. They were finally
displaced by caps and bonnets in the reign of
George II. (See
Chaperon
,
Cowl
.)

west extremity of the Roman forum to receive
the trophy of the spoils of the three Curiatii

Horns.
A portion of a ladyâs head-dress,
mentioned in the 13th century. They appear to
have been formed by the foldings of the
gorget
or

wimple
, and a disposition of the hair on each side
of the head into the form of ramsâ horns. For
the horned head-dress of the 15th century, see
the illustration to
Coronet
.

Horologium.
(1)
Sundials
preceded all
other instruments for the measurement of time.
The
gnomon
or
stocheion
of the
Greeks
was a
perpendicular staff or pillar, the shadow of
which fell upon a properly marked ground; the

polos
or
heliotropion
consisted of a perpendicular
staff, in a basin in which the twelve parts of the
day were marked by lines. (2) The
clepsydra

was a hollow globe, with a short neck, and holes
in the bottom; it measured time by the escape
of water, and was at first used like an hour-glass
to regulate the length of speeches in the
Athenian courts. The escape of water was
stopped by inserting a stopper in the mouth,
when the speaker was interrupted. Smaller

clepsydrata
made of glass and marked with the
hours were used in families. A precisely similar
history applies to the
horologia
of
Rome
.

Horreum
(dimin.
horreolum
), R. (1) Literally,
a place in which ripe fruits were kept; a
granary, or storehouse for grain;
horreum publicum

was the public granary. (2) Any storehouse
or depÃ´t;
horrea subterranea
, cellars. (3)
It was applied to places in which
works of art

were kept, and Seneca calls his library a
horreum
.

Horse.
In Christian art, the emblem of
courage and generosity; attribute of St. Martin,
St. Maurice, St. George, and others. The
Chinese have a
sacred horse
, which is affirmed to
have appeared from a river to the philosopher
Fou-hi, bearing instruction in eight diagrams
of the characters proper to express certain abstract
ideas.

, Arch. A form of the stilted
arch elevated beyond half the diameter of the
curve on which it is described. (See
Arch
.)

Hortus
(dimin.
hortulus
), R. A pleasure-garden,
park, and thence a kitchen garden;

horti pensiles
were hanging gardens. The most
striking features of a Roman garden were lines
of large trees planted in regular order; alleys or
walks (
ambulationes
) formed by closely clipped
hedges of box, yew, cypress, and other ever
greens; beds of acanthus, rows of fruit-trees
especially of vines, with statues, pyramids,
fountains, and summer-houses (
diÃ¦tÃ¦
). The
Romans were fond of the art of cutting and
twisting trees, especially box, into figures of
animals, ships, &c. (
ars topiaria
). The principal
garden-flowers seem to have been violets
and roses, and they had also the crocus, narcissus,
lily, gladiolus, iris, poppy, amaranth, and
others. Conservatories and hot-houses are
frequently mentioned by Martial. An ornamental
garden was also called
viridarium
, and
the gardener
topiarius
or
viridarius
. The common
name for a gardener is
villicus
or
cultor
hortorum
. (Consult
Smithâs Dict. of Ant.
)

Hospitium
, R. (
hospes
, a guest). A general
term to denote any place in which a traveller

Fig. 389. Hunting Flask of Jaspered Ware, 1554â1556. Louvre Museum.

Hunting Flask.
M. Jacquemart thinks that
that represented in Fig.
389
may be reasonably
attributed to Palissy. It is glazed in green,
and diapered with little flames of a deeper
shade. Upon the body, in relief, is the escutcheon
of the celebrated Anne de Montmorency,
round it the collar of St. Michael,
and on each side the Constableâs sword supported
by a mailed arm and the motto of his
house, âA Planosâ (unwavering). A mask
of Italian style and rayonnated suns complete
the decoration of this curious sealed earthenware.

known as
Poimenes
(the Shepherds),
Mentiou
Sati
,
Asian Shepherds
, and even
Scourges
, from
their invasion of some part of Eastern Egypt.

Fig. 390. Hydra with seven heads.

Hydra
, Gr. (a water-serpent). A hundred-headed
monster of Greek mythology, sprung,
like the ChimÃ¦ra, from Typhon and Echidna;
he was killed by Hercules. In Heraldry the
hydra is represented with only nine heads. The
illustration (Fig.
390
) is of the device adopted
by Curtio Gonzaga, an Italian poet, to symbolize
the constancy of his love, with the motto, âIf I
kill it, more strong it revives.â

HydraletÃªs
, Gr. (1) A mill for grinding
corn, driven by water. (2) A waterfall or current
of water.

Hydraulis
, Gr. (
á½Î´Ï-Î±Ï
Î»Î¹Ï
). A water-organ.
The hydraulic organ, invented about
B.C.
200, was
really a pneumatic organ; the water was only
used to force the air through the pipes. It is
represented on a coin of Nero in the British
Museum. Only ten pipes are given to it, and
there is no indication of any key-board. It had
eight stops, and consequently eight rows of
pipes; these were partly of bronze, and partly
of reed. It continued in use so late as the 9th
century of our era.

Fig. 391. Hydria, or Water-jug, in black glaze.

Hydria
, Gr. A large, heavy vessel, used
principally for holding a store of water. It is
represented urn-shaped, with a broad base and

pails of bronze or silver, &c. (Fig.
391
.)

alcarazas
.

Hydroscope.

.)

HypÃ¦thral
, Gr. and R. (lit. under the sky,
or in the open air). The term was applied to
any building, especially a temple, the
cella
of
which had no roof. On the roofs of Egyptian
temples, hypÃ¦thral temples are arranged with
regard to astronomical observations, by which
the calendar was regulated.

ÏÏÎ¿Î½
). A furnace with flues running
underneath the floor of an apartment or bath,

I.

Ich Dien.
I serve. The popular belief that
Edward the Black Prince adopted this motto
and the âPrince of Walesâs feathers,â at the
battle of Cressy, from the blind King of Bohemia,
is not sustained by investigation. It was
at the battle of Poitiers that he first adopted
this crest, joining to the family badge the old
English word
Ic den
(Theyn), âI serve,â in
accordance with the words of the Apostle,
âThe heir, while he is a child, differeth nothing
from a servant.â (
Mrs. Palliser

the Eastern Empire, from which finally Theophilus
banished all the painters and statuaries
in 832. It has been since generally applied to
those who, at various outbreaks of fanaticism,
have destroyed ecclesiastical objects of art, and
is especially applicable to the disciples of Savonarola
in 1497, and to the Puritans of Scotland
and England during the civil wars.

Iconography
(i. e. image-description). The
science that deals with statues and images,
bas-reliefs, busts, medals, &c. Thus we have
an Egyptian, Greek, Roman, mediÃ¦val iconography,
&c. The best work on this science is
âChristian Iconography; or the History of
Christian Art in the Middle Ages,â by M. Didron.
The second volume contains a manual on
the subject by a painter of the 12th century.

Iconostasis
, Chr. The screen of the chancel
in ancient churches, so called because it was
there that images (
Îµá¼°Îºá½¹Î½ÎµÏ
) were displayed for
the adoration of the faithful.

Ideal
and
Real.
âAny work of art which
represents, not a material object, but the mental
conception of a material object, is in the primary
sense of the word
ideal
; that is to say, it
represents an
idea
, not a
thing
. Any work of
art which represents or realizes a material object
is, in the primary sense of the term,
un-ideal
.â
(
Modern Painters
, vol. ii. chap. 13.) In a
practical sense an
ideal
picture or statue (e. g.
the Medici Venus) is not the portrait of an
individual model, but the putting together of
selected parts from several models. Raphael
said, âTo paint a beautiful woman I must see
several, and I have also recourse to a certain

ideal
in my mind;â and Guido said, âThe
beautiful and pure
idea
must be in the mind, and
then it is no matter what the model is.â

Ides
,
Idus
, R. One of the monthly divisions
in the Roman year; it fell on the 15th in
months of thirty-one days, excepting January,
August, and December; in months with only
twenty-nine or thirty days, the
ides
fell on
the 13th. The
kalends
are the first of every
month; the
nones
are the 7th of March, May,
July, and October, and the 5th of all the other
months; and the ides always fall eight days
later than the nones; and the days are reckoned
backwards: thus the 13th of January is the ides
of January, and the 14th of January the 19th day

ante diem
(or before) the February kalends.
The morrow of the ides was looked upon as an
unlucky day (
nefas
).

Illapa
, Peruv. One of the divisions of the
temple of the Sun (
Inti
) among the ancient
Peruvians, so called because it was dedicated to
the thunder (
Illapa
). (See
Inti
.)

Illumination.
This art originated simply in
the application of
minium
(or red lead) as a
colour or ink, to decorate a portion of a piece of
writing, the general text of which was in black
ink. The term was retained long after the
original red lead was superseded by the more
brilliant
cinnabar
, or vermilion. Ornaments of
all kinds were gradually added, and the term includes
the practice of every kind of ornamental
or ornamented writing. From the 3rd century
Greek and Roman specimens exist of golden
lettering upon purple or rose-coloured vellum,
and the art prevailed wherever monasteries were
founded. Anglo-Saxon and Irish MSS. of the
6th and 7th centuries exhibit a marvellous perfection,
characterized by wonderfully minute interlacements
of the patterns. Nearly all the best
specimens of illumination were destroyed on the
dissolution of monasteries. (Consult â
The
Art of Illuminating

Imbrex
, R. A ridge-tile of semi-cylindrical
form, and thus distinct from the

was
the name given to a channel or gutter formed of
ridge-tiles laid on their backs.

Indian Art.
The study of the forms and
principles of Indian Art is indispensable to an
appreciation of the true principles of ornamental
design in general. The excellence of Indian
manufactures is due to the system of Guilds
rigidly adhered to for ages, which has resulted
in the production of a race of hereditary craftsmen
unequalled for their skill and taste in
execution and design. Their pottery is distinguished
above all others for purity and
simplicity of form, obvious fitness to purpose,
and individual freedom of design. Its origin
antedates the Institutes of Manu, and is lost in
antiquity. Indian gold and metal work is supposed
by Dr. Birdwood to owe its origin to Greek
influence, but has acquired in its development a
purely Oriental character. The Hindoos exhibit
the greatest skill in the Oriental arts of damascening
and enamelling, as well as in lacquer work
and wood and ivory carving. All their designs are
deeply symbolical, and closely interwoven with
the primitive religious impulses of humanity.
India was probably the first country in which
the art of weaving was brought to perfection,
and the fame of its cloudy gauzes and its gold
and silver brocades is more ancient than the
Code of Manu. The art is repeatedly mentioned
in the Vedas. The purity of Indian Art is
endangered in modern days by the introduction
of machine-made goods and European design.
(Consult
Dr. Birdwoodâs Handbook of Indian
Art
.)

,
systyle
, and

situated in the centre of the temple; the second
division was called
mama-quilla
, from the fact
of its being dedicated to the moon, which was
thus named; the third was dedicated to the
stars, called
cayllur
; the fourth to the thunder,

(which is half a diameter) and the

Capital
, to the bottom of the volute. The

Pedestal
is a little taller and more ornamented
than the Doric. The
Bases
used are very
various. The Attic base is very often used,
and, with an
astragal
added above the upper

torus
, makes a beautiful and appropriate base
for the Ionic. The
Cornices
are (1) plain
Grecian, or (2) the
dentil
cornice, or (3) the

modillon
cornice. The Ionic shaft may be
fluted in twenty-four semicircular flutes with
fillets between them. The best Ionic example
was the temple on the Ilissus at Athens. The
temple of Fortuna Virilis at Rome is an inferior
specimen. (See also Figs. 69, 184.)

Ivory Carving.
This art, in considerable
perfection, was known to prehistoric
man at the period of the so called stone
age. Egyptian and Assyrian specimens of
the art are of a
date at least as
early as that of
Moses. From the
year 1000
B.C.

down to the Christian
era, there
was a constant
succession of
artists in ivory in
the western
Asiatic countries,
in Egypt, in
Greece, and in
Italy. From the time
of Augustus, ivory
carving shared in
the general decline
of art. Increasing in
number as they come
nearer to the Middle
Ages, we can refer to
carved ivories of every
century, preserved in
museums in England
and abroad. The most
important ivories up to
the 7th century are the
consular
diptychs
, originally
a favourite form
of presents from newly-appointed
consuls to
eminent persons; subsequently
adapted to
Christian uses, or as wedding presents, &c. In
the Middle Ages, from the 8th to the 16th century,
the use of ivory was adopted for general
purposes. The favourite subjects of the carvings
are those drawn from the romances of the
Middle Agesâespecially the romance of the
Roseâand in the 15th century, scenes of
domestic life, illustrating the dress, armour,
and manners and customs of the day. Combs
of every date, from the Roman and Anglo-Saxon
period, and earlier, are found in British
graves. In short, from the time when the first
prehistoric carvings of antediluvian animals
were made to the present, every age of human
civilization appears to be more or less fully
illustrated in carvings upon ivory and bone.
(See also
Chessmen
.) The earliest material
was found in the tusks of the mammoth: from
Iceland we have beautiful carvings of the 7th
century in the teeth of the walrus. Fossil tusks
of the mammoth are found in great quantities
in Siberia, and are almost the only material of
the ivory-turnerâs work in Russia. African and
Asiatic elephant ivory are the best, and differ,
the former, when newly cut, being of a mellow,
warm, transparent tint. Asiatic ivory tends to
become yellow by exposure. A fine specimen
of carving in ivory is given in Fig.
403
from
a
Mirror-case
of the 15th century. (See
also Fig.
185
, and illustrations to
Pyx
,
Triptych
,
&c.)

In â
cutwork

laid on to cloth, and the cloth sewn to it in
parts, and the other parts cut away; or, by
another method, the threads were arranged on
a frame, all radiating from a common centre,
and then worked into patterns. This was the
old convent lace of Italy, called â
Greek lace

Pillow
laces
are made by the weaving, twisting, and
plaiting of the threads with bobbins on a

cushion
; such are Mechlin, Lille, Valenciennes,
Honiton, Buckingham, and many manufactories
in France.

Lithochrome.
Another name for
Chromolithography

Lithography
, or drawing on stone, was
invented by Aloys Senefelder of Munich
in 1796. Drawings are made on a polished
surface of calcareous stone, with ink and
chalk of a soapy nature. The
lithographic
ink
is made of tallow-soap, pure white wax,
lamp-black, and a small quantity of tallow, all
boiled together, and, when cool, dissolved in
distilled water; the ingredients for the
lithographic
chalk
are the same, with a small quantity
of potash added during the boiling. After the
drawing on the stone is perfectly dry, a very
weak solution of sulphuric acid is poured over
it, which takes up the alkali from the ink or
chalk, and leaves an insoluble substance behind
it, while it lowers in a slight degree the surface
of the stone not drawn upon, and prepares it for
the free absorption of water. Weak gum-water
is next applied to close the pores of the stone,
and to keep it moist. The stone is then washed
with water, and the printing-ink applied in the
ordinary way. It then passes through the press,
the washing with water and daubing with ink
being repeated after every impression. As many
as 70,000 copies have in this way been taken
from one stone, the last being nearly as good as
the first. Copper-plate and steel engravings can
be transferred to stone. (See the article âLithographyâ
in the

8th ed.)

Fig. 433. Heraldic Decoration at VersaillesâLouis Quatorze.

Louis Quatorze
, Arch. A style of ornament
developed towards the close of the 17th century
(1643â1715). It is described as âessentially
an
ornamental
style, its chief aim being effect by
a brilliant play of light and shade; colour, or
mere beauty of form in detail, having no part in
it. This style arose in Italy, and the Chiesa
del GesÃ¹ at Rome is mentioned as its type or
model. The great medium of the Louis
Quatorze was gilt stucco-work, which, for a
while, seems to have almost wholly superseded
decorative painting; and this absence of colour
in the principal decorations of the period seems
to have led to its more striking characteristic,âinfinite
play of light and shade.â (
Wornum
,

Analysis of Ornament
.) In this style symmetry
was first systematically avoided. In the
Furniture

of the period the characteristic details are
the scroll and shell. The classical ornaments
and all the elements of the
Cinque-cento
, from
which the Louis Quatorze proceeded, are
admitted under peculiar treatment, as accessories;
the panels are formed by chains of
scrolls, or a combination of the scroll and shell.
Versailles is the great repertory of the Louis
Quatorze (Fig.
433
), and the designs of Watteau
its finest exemplification.

Louis Quinze
, Arch. This style (1715â74)
is the exaggeration of the Louis Quatorze, rejecting
all symmetry, and introducing the
elongation of the foliations of the scroll, mixed
up with a species of crimped conventional

coquillage
or shell-work. The style found its
culmination in the bizarre absurdities of the
Rococo.

penetrating within, and to direct the sound of
the bells downwards. Sometimes the wooden

you may weave your mistressâs favour?â (
Quip
for an Upstart Courtier.
)

âWhy should thy sweete love-locke hang dangling downe,

Kissing thy girdle-stud with falling pride?

Oh, let not then thy haire thy beautie hide.â

(

Wrestling. In the Homeric
age the wrestlers contended
naked, excepting the
perizoma

round the loins; about

B.C.
720 (the 15th Olympiad)
this was discarded. The
Cretans and LacedÃ¦monians,
and afterwards the Greeks,
anointed the body with oil, and then strewed it
over with sand or dust. The Lucta or PalÃ©
differed from the
Pancratium
. In the latter,
boxing and wrestling were combined, and the
contest continued until one party was killed, or
unable to continue. In wrestling, on the other
hand, the victory was awarded to the man who
first threw the other three times. The most

B.C.
509, and was seven times
crowned at the Pythian games, and six times at

Lute
(Arabic,
el oud
). A stringed instrument
of great antiquity, first mentioned in Persia in
682
A. D.
Before the 10th century the lute had
only four strings, or four pairs producing four
tones, each tone having two strings tuned in
unison. About the 10th century a string for a
fifth tone was added. The strings were made of
silk neatly twisted. The neck of the instrument
was provided with frets of string, regulated
according to the system of seventeen intervals to
an octave. The Chinese god of music is represented
playing on a lute with four strings. The
lute was very popular in England in Elizabethâs
time. Originally it had eight catgut strings, arranged
in four pairs, each pair being in unison.
The number of strings varied from time to
time, and in the 17th century they were twenty-four.
The size of the lute also varied; the
treble lute was the smallest, and the bass lute the
largest. There were also the
Archlute
, the

Chitarrone
,

Theorbo
, &c.

, Gr. and R. (
Î»á½»ÏÎ±

stringed instrument which assumed various
forms. On Assyrian monuments the lyre occurs in
three different forms, and is held horizontally
in playing. Its front bar was generally either
oblique or slightly curved. It was played with
a
plectrum
or with the fingers. The
Hebrew

lyre is represented on coins of Judas MaccabÃ¦us.
Some have three strings, others five, and others
six. The two sides of the frames appear to have
been made of horns of animals. The Hebrew
square-shaped lyre is probably the
Psalterion
,
the
Kinnor
, a lyre of triangular shape, the
instrument of King David, is named in the
Bible as the oldest stringed instrument, the invention
of Jubal. The Rabbis record that King
David used to suspend his over his pillow at
night. On Egyptian monuments, at Beni
Hassan, a Hebrew lyre is represented, probably
of the date of Joseph, 1700
B.C.
The
Greeks

had lyres of many kinds, distinguished by different
names;
Lyra
, a generic term, and also the
lyre oval at the base, to be held in the lap;

Kithara
, with a square base, to be held
against the breast;
Chelys
, a small lyre with
body made of tortoise-shell;
Phormix
, a large
lyre, &c. Some lyres have a bridge, others have
none; the largest were probably held on or
between the knees, or were tied by a band to
the left arm. The strings of catgut or sinew
were twanged with a
plektron
or short stem of
ivory or metal, pointed at both ends. The lyre
was the most favourite instrument of the

Romans
, under various names. The
Cornu

had a frame ending at the top in two long horns;
the
Barbitos
was a lyre with a large body;
the
Psalterium
was of an oblong square shape,
&c. The lyre is represented in early
Christian

monuments of the 4th century. In one of them
the Saviour is represented as Apollo touching
the lyre.
Anglo-Saxon MSS.
of the 9th century
also represent the lyre. A
German
fiddle
of the 9th century, with only one string, is called

lyra
in the MS. In Christian symbolism the
lyre represented âthe attractive power of the
Lord.â (See

Fig. 443. Shaft ornamented with Marquetry.

Marquetry.
Inlaid-work
of ornamental woods and
stones of various colours
put together and mixed with
metals. The art has existed
from the earliest ages; but
no nation has brought it
to a higher degree of perfection
than the Italians of
the 15th century. The
Florentines especially have
produced work of this kind
which is unapproached; the
Medici chapel at Florence
may be particularly instanced.
Figs. 443 and 444
represent specimens of antique
work. The Venetian
marquetry, derived from
Persia and India, is a fine
inlay of ivory, metal, and
woods, stained to vary the
colour. This work is in
geometric patterns only. In
France, in the early marquetry designs, picturesque
landscapes, broken architecture, and figures are
represented. Colours are occasionally stained
on the wood. Ivory and ebony are the favourite

Fig. 453. Mechlin Lace, 18th century.

Mechlin Lace
is fine, transparent, and effective.
It is made in one piece on the pillow;
its distinguishing feature is the flat thread which
forms the flowers, and gives to the lace the
character of embroidery. In 1699âwhen
Charles II.âs prohibition to the introduction of
Flanders lace was removedâMechlin lace
became the fashion in England, and continued
so during the succeeding century. In the 17th
century the Beguinage nuns were celebrated for
their lace-making, and they supported their
house by their work. Previous to 1665 the
name of Mechlin was given to all pillow lace,
and much of it was made like our modern
insertion. The engraving shows a specimen
of old Mechlin lace formerly in great favour as
head-dresses and other trimmings.

Pergamus. It was usually written over on one
side, and the back was stained with saffron.
The writings were frequently erased, and the
paper or parchment used again. It was then
called a
palimpsest
. All the sheets used for one
work were joined together into a long scroll,
which was folded round a staff, and then called

volumen
; usually there were ornamental balls
or bosses, projecting from the ends of the staff,
called
umbilici
or

Metallurgy.
It was at a comparatively late
period of human civilization that the art of
working in iron was brought to perfection. The
ancient Egyptians, probably aware of its resources,
had a superstitious objection to its use;
but they hardened bronze to a degree unknown
to later ages, and their bronze statuary of the
most ancient period is worthy of any age. The
bronze-work of Britain and Ireland is as ancient
as any; and, in beauty of form and perfection of
casting, rivals the best modern work. Of the
work in Greece we are told that Athens alone
contained 3000 bronze statues in the year 130
B.C.
,
and vast treasures of metallurgy have been discovered
in Herculaneum and Pompeii. In
mediÃ¦val times Ireland was famous for metallurgy,
and of its admirable copper-works of the
11th century many splendid relics remain,
especially the so called Bell of St. Patrick.
Oriental bronzes, of characteristic design, are
plentiful from all ages; especially beautiful
and perfect in execution are those of China and
Japan. The best period of workmanship in

Iron
is the Middle Ages; gates and hinges, keys,
and especially weapons and defensive armour being
the chief objects produced. (Consult

,
Digby
Wyatt
.) (See also

Moorish Architecture
, or Arabian or Mohammedan

of the 7th century in the East, and in Spain,

appears at Cairo and elsewhere three centuries
earlier than in Europe. The most perfect
specimen of the luxury of decoration of which
this style is capable is found in the Alhambra.

only examples are sculptural, and this on ivories,
gems, &c. On these generally the Child is
seen wrapped in swaddling clothes as the central

practice of the ancients, derived from
a pagan source, of celebrating the birthday
of St. John Baptist at the midsummer solstice
(St. Johnâs Eve) by lighting fires, carrying about

practice is one of many examples of the caution
with which the evangelizing ecclesiastics of the
Middle Ages refrained from abruptly disturbing
the deeply-rooted superstitions of the ancient
Germans. [Consult

the invention of the two most perfect productions
of the needleââPoint coupÃ©,â and Venetian
point in relief. Various other wonderful
products of the needle are included under the
general name of Venetian point, all of exquisite
workmanship. The needle point in relief is

regularity. The engraving is an exquisite
specimen of the fine raised needle point.

Greeks. The Byzantines compounded for this
purpose silver, lead, sulphur, and copper, and

the heads of persons of special dignity or
sanctity as a symbol of honour. After the
8th century living persons were, in Italy, distinguished
by a square nimbus, which sometimes
assumed the form of a scroll partly unrolled.
The nimbus is of heathen origin. Virgil describes
Juno as ânimbo succincta.â The heads of
the statues of the gods, and the Roman emperors,
after they began to claim divine honours, were
decorated with a crown of rays. On medals of
the Christian emperors also the nimbus is found,
e.g. Constantine. In illuminated MSS. it is
found on Pharaoh, Ahab, and other kings. It
is a familiar symbol of dignity or power in the
East, but does not appear as a Christian emblem
before the 6th century. [See the article

Fig. 489. Incrusted Tile. Norman. Middle Ages.

Norman Pottery
, MediÃ¦val. The illustration
is from a pavement of a church of the 12th
century. âNothing,â says Jacquemart, âis
more curious than the study of these tiles, in
which, with rudimentary means, art already
begins to manifest its power. There, in a graceful
chequer-work, the fleur-de-lis of France
heightens at intervals a semÃ© of trefoils and
rosettes; scrolls of notched leaves combine in
graceful borders; circles divided crossways
receive in their sections stars and heraldic
suns; here are armour-clad warriors, mounted
upon horses richly caparisoned, &c.âall that
picturesque fancy assisted by the resources of
heraldry could invent to animate the cold
compartments of the pavement, and give a
meaning to the vast naves trodden every day
by the Christian multitude.â (

ancients entertained for this beautiful gem was
unbounded. The Roman senator Nonnius preferred
exile to parting with a brilliant opal the
size of a filbert which Marc Antony coveted.
The
fire opal
is furnished principally by Mexico.
Its colour, more pronounced than that of the

oriental
opal, and the carmine or vinous red tint
of its fires, permit it to be easily recognized.
The
common opal
displays very little fire; its
colour is milk-white, which, joined to a texture
extremely homogeneous, renders it semi-transparent.

are running, frogs jumping, snakes crawling
or sleeping, or more still, in a streamlet of

Quincy states that the fine preservation of the
surface of some antique statues, such as the
Apollo Belvedere, Hercules of Glycon, and
Venus de Medici, is attributable to the use of
wax colouring. Stones of various colours were

Porcelain
(Ancient Chinese) (from the Portuguese

the chief component part of which is
silex. (
Fairholt.
) The most ancient examples
of porcelain in China are circular dishes
with upright sides, very thick, strong, and
heavy, and which invariably have the marks
of one, two, or three on the bottom thus:
I. II. III. The colours of these rare specimens
vary. The kinds most highly prized have
a brownish-yellow ground, over which is thrown
a light shot sky-blue, with here and there a
dash of blood-red. The Chinese say there are
but a few of these specimens in the country,
and that they are more than a thousand years
old. (
Fortune.
) The first imitations of Chinese
porcelain in Europe date from the 16th century,
under the Medici family, and include specimens
supposed to have been designed by the immediate
pupils of Raffaelle. (See

Among the next earliest produced is
that of Fulham, by Dr. Dwight, in 1671, and of
St. Cloud in France about 1695.

Potterâs Clay
, found in Dorsetshire and
Devonshire, is used for modelling and for
pottery; mixed with linseed oil, it is used as a

ground
in painting.

Pottery
(
Fayence
,
Terraglia
), as distinct from
porcelain, is formed of potterâs clay mixed with
marl of argillaceous and calcareous nature, and
sand, variously proportioned, and may be classed
under two divisions:
Soft
(Fayence Ã  pÃ¢te
tendre), and
Hard
(Fayence Ã  pÃ¢te dure), according
to the nature of the composition or the
degree of heat under which it has been fired in
the kiln. What is known generally in England
as
earthenware
is soft, while
stone-ware
,
Queenâs ware
,
&c., are hard. The characteristics of the
soft wares are a paste or body which may be
scratched with a knife or file, and fusibility
generally at the heat of a porcelain furnace.
These soft wares may be again divided into
four subdivisions:
unglazed
,
lustrous
,
glazed
, or

enamelled
. Among the three first of these subdivisions
may be arranged almost all the ancient
pottery of Egypt, Greece, Etruria, and Rome;
as also the larger portion of that in general use
among all nations during mediÃ¦val and modern
times. The
glazed wares
may be again divided
into
silicious
or
glass-glazed wares
, and
plumbeous

or
lead-glazed
. In these subdivisions the
foundation is in all cases the same. The mixed
clay or âpasteâ or âbodyâ is formed by the
hand or on the wheel, or impressed into moulds;
then slowly dried and baked in a furnace or
stove, after which, on cooling, it is in a state to
receive the glaze. This is prepared by fusing
sand or other silicious material with potash or
soda to form a translucent glass, the composition
of the glaze upon vitreous or
glass-glazed
wares.
The addition of oxide of lead constitutes the
glaze of
plumbeous
wares; and the further addition
of the oxide of tin produces an enamel of
an opaque white of great purity, which is the
characteristic glazing of
stanniferous
or
tin-glazed
wares
. Most of the principal seats of the
manufacture of pottery, and a description of
the objects manufactured, and methods used in
the manufacture, will be found mentioned under
their respective headings.

natural forms all primitive Egyptian and other
sculpture. Jacquemart describes the vase of the

American ceramics; and, from the close resemblance
of the features of the figure represented
to certain groups of prisoners on the Egyptian
bas-reliefs, as well as to the ethnic type of the
ancient Japanese kings, makes important deductions
with reference to the dispersion of
mankind, and the commerce of the old and new

Reticella
(Lat.
reticulus
, a little net). This
was the first known needle-made lace, produced
in all lace-making countries under different
names. (See
Greek Lace
.) It was made in
several ways: the first consisted in arranging a
network of threads on a small frame, crossing
and interlacing them in various complicated
patterns. Beneath this network was gummed a
piece of fine cloth, open like canvas, called quintain
(from the town in Brittany where it was
made). Then with a needle the network was
sewn to the quintain by edging round those
parts of the pattern which were to remain thick,
then cutting away the superfluous cloth:
hence the name of cutwork in England. A
more simple mode was to make the pattern detached
without any linen; the threads radiating
at equal distances from one common centre
served as a framework to others, which were
united to them in geometric forms worked over
with button-hole stitch (or
point nouÃ©
). The
engraving shows a fine specimen of reticella
from Venice, 1493. (See also
Milan Reticella
.)

Rings.
The symbolic use of signet-rings is
mentioned in many passages of the Holy Scriptures,
especially as a transfer of authority; as
Pharaoh to Joseph (Gen. xli. 42),
Ahasuerus to Haman, &c. A large
collection of Egyptian signet-rings
is in the British Museum, many
being much too large to be worn on
the hand.
Egyptian
rings were of
ivory, porcelain, or stone, but generally
of gold. The
Etruscans

and
Sabines
wore rings at the
foundation of Rome, 753
B.C.
, those
of the former being remarkable for
beauty and intrinsic value. The

LacedÃ¦monians
wore iron rings.
The
Romans
also under the Republic
were proud of wearing an
iron ring; under the Empire the
privilege of wearing a ring raised the wearer to
the equestrian order.
Greek
and
Roman
rings
were, generally speaking, massive and simple, and
of obvious value
in metal and
stone, until in
the degenerate
times of the
Empire luxury
spread, and the
lower classes began
to disfigure
themselves with
cheap jewellery.
Solid rings were
carved out of
rock-crystal in
Christian times;
and others were
made of stone,
chiefly of calcedony.
Rings
of amber, glass,
earthenware, and
other materials
were exhumed at
Pompeii. The

Britons
and
Saxons
had beautiful jewellery.
The former wore the ring on the middle
finger; the Anglo-Saxons on the third finger of
the right hand, which was thence poetically
called the âgolden finger.â A beautiful specimen
of enamelled art is the gold ring of Ethelwulf,
king of Wessex (the father of Alfred the
Great), now in the medal room of the British
Museum. Among the
niello
rings of the
Saxon period is one in the British Museum inscribed
âAhlreds owns me, Eanred engraved
me.â Plain wire rings, or plain bands of metal
merely twisted round the finger, are common
objects in Saxon tombs; but the most beautiful
specimens of this, as of other branches of the
goldsmithâs art in antiquity, are from
Ireland
.
In
Scandinavia
the earliest forms are spiral,
and of simple workmanship.
Rings
were a part
of the official jewellery of kings, bishops, and
cardinals; and the
fishermanâs ring
, with a representation
of St. Peter in a boat fishing, was
the papal ring of investiture. A copious literature
on this special subject deals with the superstitions,
ceremonies, customs, and anecdotes
connected with finger-rings, as well as with their
exemplification of the history of the development
or decadence of art. A collector divides his
rings into
Antique
,
MediÃ¦val
, and
Modern
; the
former period ending
A. D.
800, and classified by
nationalities. The later collections are classified
as
Official
: ecclesiastical, civil, and military;
or
Personal
, viz. signet-rings, love and marriage,
mourning, &c.; historical, religious (i. e. devotional,
&c.), magic, and simply ornamental.
(The substance of the above is drawn from

Finger-ring Lore
, &c., by
W. Jones
, Chatto,
1877; and
Antique Gems
, by the
Rev. C. W.
King
. For the significance of rings in connexion

Rivers
, Chr. The four rivers of Paradise are
variously represented in primitive Christian
art; e. g. the
Lamb
standing on a mountain,
from which they flow; or they are personified,
and symbolize the four Evangelists: the Gihon
is St. Matthew; Pison, St. John; Tigris,
St. Mark; and Euphrates, St. Luke. The following
lines in one instance accompany such a
representation on an engraved copper plate:â

â
Fons paradisiacus per flumina quatuor exit;

Hec quadriga levis te
Î§ÏÎµ
per omnia vexit.
â

In
CLASSIC
art generally, rivers are personified
as half-prostrate figures reclining upon an urn,
and marked by certain attributes; e. g. of the
Nile, a hippopotamus; of the Tiber, a wolf
suckling Romulus and Remus; other rivers by
the flora or by certain cities of their banks, &c.

ruins still remain.

Rochet
, Chr. (Lat.
rochetum
; Anglo-Saxon

roc
, a loose upper garment). A short surplice
without sleeves, open at the sides; imitated
from a linen outer garment of the same name,
much worn by women in the 14th century.
Chaucer says,â

âThere is no clothe sytteth bette

On damoselle than doth rokette.â

Rock-crystal.
A material much used for
carving in China.
Fortune
says, âFine specimens
of rock-crystal, carved into figures, cups,
and vases, are met with in the curiosity shops of
Foo-chow-foo. Some of these specimens are
white, others golden yellow, and others again
blue and black. One kind looks as if human
hair was thrown in and crystallized.
Imitations

of this stone are common in Canton, made into
snuff-bottles, such as are commonly used by the
Chinese.â The
Greek
name (
ÎºÏá½»ÏÏÎ±Î»Î»Î¿Ï
, ice)
refers to the belief that it was frozen water;
the
Indians
believe it to be the husk of which
the
diamond
is the kernel, and call it the
unripe
diamond
; in
Japan
it is cut into round balls
used for cooling the hands; in
China
also it is
extensively carved; in the
Middle Ages
it was
highly valued throughout
Europe
as a detector
of poison. Still more recently crystal balls have
been supposed to have magical influence, and
used for divination and conjuring.

Rockets
, O. E. Slabs of wood used on
lances, during exercise, for the same purpose as
the buttons of foils.

Roman Architecture
is a combination of the

Etruscan
and the
Greek
, principally distinguished
from the latter by the circular arch, and the

monopteral
or circular temple unknown to the
Greeks, but a favourite form with the tomb-building
ancestors of the Etruscans. The
orders

of Roman architecture were the Doric and
Ionic, detrimentally modified; the Corinthian,
which they greatly enriched; and the Composite,
of which the upper part of the capital
was Ionic, and the remainder Corinthian. The
distinguishing feature of the Roman architecture
is, however, less in the modifications of the orders,
than in their application in
composite arcades
, or
plain arches of Etruscan design, faced by and
supporting a purely ornamental arrangement of
a long horizontal entablature on two columns.
(Consult
Fergusson
,
Hist. of Arch.
, vol. i.)

Romanesque.
A degenerated and hybrid
style of architecture and ornament, transitional
from the classical Roman to the introduction of
the Gothic. In the architecture there is an
incongruous combination of the horizontal and
arched methods of construction; and in the
ornament a similar dissonance of natural and
conventional or fanciful objects.
Fairholt
calls
it the
classic rococo
.
Fergusson
(
Hist. of Arch.
,
vol. i. p. 352) defines the
Romanesque
as âthat
modification of the classical Roman form, which
was introduced between the reigns of Constantine
and Justinian, and was avowedly an attempt
to adapt classical forms to Christian purposes.â
He says, âIf
Romanesque
is to be applied to
our Norman architecture, the Parthenon ought
to be called
Egyptianesque
, and the Temple at
Ephesus
Assyrianesque
.â There seems to be
no universally-received definition of this term.

Rorarii
, R. (
ros
, the dew). A body of light
skirmishers in the Roman army, who were
ranged in the second rank of the
triarii
, with the

accensi
behind them in the third line. They took
their name from the light missiles which they
scattered upon the enemy, which were like the
drops of rain before a thunder shower. It was
their business to begin the attack, and retire
behind the
triarii
when pressed. Their skirmishing
was a prelude to the charge of the
heavy-armed spears (
hastati
).

Rosary
, Chr. A string or chaplet of beads
for numbering prayers, an Oriental and ante-Christian
custom of great antiquity. They are
called
tasbih

&c.

Fig. 590. Heraldic Roses.

Rose
, Her. Represented in blazon without
leaves. The rose of England is generally drawn
like the natural flower, or with natural stem,
branches, leaves, and buds, but with heraldic
rose-flowers. (See Fig.
395
.) In Classic art,
a rose upon a tomb is an emblem of a short
life. The ancient
Romans
were passionately
fond of
roses, and cultivated
them assiduously
in their
gardens, and introduced
them
plentifully in their feasts and symposia. In

mediÃ¦val
England roses were the favourite presents
on birthdays; and Whitsuntide was called,
from the plenty of them, Rose Easter. Sticking
a rose in the ear was the boast of an accepted
lover.

âThat in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,

Lest men should say, Look where three farthings goes.â

(
Shakspeare.
)

The allusion refers to a thin silver coin of the
reign of Elizabeth, called the three-farthing
rose. (
PlanchÃ©.
)

most beautiful examples are met with in churches
of the Florid Gothic period. (Fig.
591
.)

Rose-wood
,
Rhodes-wood
, largely used in
furniture as a favourite veneer, is a name applied
to a large variety of trees, mostly imported from
Brazil.

Rosemary
, in Old England, was closely connected
with wedding-feasts and with funerals.

âThereâs rosemary: thatâs for remembrance; pray you,
love, remember: and there is pansies; thatâs for thoughts.â

(
Hamlet.
)

âThereâs Rosemarie; the Arabians justifie,

It comforteth the braine and memorie.â

white spots and veins.

Rostrum
, R. (Gr.
Embolos
). The prow of a
ship. The plural
rostra
was used to denote a
tribune in the Roman forum, from which orators
addressed the people; it was so called because
it was decorated with the figure-heads of the
ships taken from the Volscians in the Latin
War.

Rota
, R. (1) A wheel composed of a nave
(
modius
), spokes (
radii
), felloes (

an instrument of punishment.
Rota aquaria

was a hydraulic wheel;

rotte
; Eng.
rote
), a stringed
instrument of the early Middle Ages, sounded

rotunda
ever made
was that of the Vienna Exhibition in 1873.

Fig. 592. Gallic coin.

Rouelle
, Fr. (lit. a small wheel). A
French term which has
been applied by antiquaries
to numerous objects more or
less resembling a wheel,
such as brooches and coins.

592
)
is from the bas-reliefs on a
Roman arch at Orange.

Fig. 593. Rouen Plate. Decorated Ã  la Corne.

Rouennais Faience.
This
style, of strongly Oriental
character, and mostly applied
to the decoration of what are called
âlambrequinsâ (or mantlings) and âdentellesâ

in France and other countries. Figs. 593 and
594 are representative specimens remarkable
for great originality.

Round Towers.
There are upwards of a hundred
in Ireland, of which about twenty are perfect.
Generally the tower is a hollow circular
column from 50 to 150 feet high, capped by a
short pointed roof of stone. The base, frequently
of cyclopean masonry, measures from
40 to 60 feet in circumference, and the form of
the whole tower is tapering towards the summit.
The single entrance door is always from 8 to 15
feet above the ground; the windows, scattered,
light the internal stories or rooms. Innumerable
and wild conjectures of the origin and purpose
of these towers have been made. The most
sober appears to be that they were the earliest
form of buildings of a monastic order, adapted
to the exigencies of a Christian settlement in the
midst of pagans and pirates. (See
Petrie
,
The
Round Towers of Ireland
.)

Fig. 595. Bezant.

Ruby
or
Red Sapphire
. A
corundum

most valuable of all gems; when perfect and
large, exceeding even the diamond in value.
The colour varies from the lightest rose tint to
the deepest carmine. The most valuable tint is
called âpigeonâs blood,â a pure deep rich red,
without any admixture of blue or yellow.
Brahmin traditions speak of the abode of the
gods lighted by enormous rubies; and one name
of the Kings of Pegu was âLord of Rubies.â
In mediÃ¦val times the ruby was regarded as an

Fig. 604. Schleswig Lace.

Schleswig Lace.
North Schleswig (or South
Jutland) is the only province of Denmark in
which there was a regular manufacture of lace.
The art itself is supposed to have been introduced,
in 1515, by Queen Elizabeth (sister of the
Emperor Charles V., and wife of Christian II.
of Denmark). About 1712 lace-making was
much improved by Brabant women. The earlier
specimens are all of Flemish character, made on
the pillow in the same way, occasionally imitating
the Mechlin ground with the pattern apparently
run in with the needle. All Schleswig
laces are remarkable for their fine quality and
excellent workmanship. The engraving shows
part of a shirt-collar of Christian IV., of a Brabant
pattern to be seen in his portrait in
Hampton Court Palace.

Sculpture
(from
sculpo
, to carve) includes all
carved work, in wood, ivory, stone, marble,
metal, or other material; and also those works
formed in a softer material not requiring carving,
such as wax or clay. It includes

,
carved ornament, and
Glyptics
or
incised gems and cameos. From the practice of
preparing the model in clay, sculpture is also
called
the plastic art
. A most remarkable incident
in the history of sculpture, is the fact that
the most ancient specimens are carved of the
hardest stones, such as basalt, granite, and porphyry;
and that this work was done at a period
antecedent to the introduction of steel tools.

(
helix pomatia
). (See

shoes. Patricians and their children wore a
crescent shoe-buckle (see
Luna
). Slaves went
barefooted. The Jews had shoes of leather,
wood, &c., tied with thongs passed under the

Silver.
The history of working in silver is
identical with that of Goldsmithsâ work in general.
(See
Gold
.)
Pollen
remarks that though
Phidias and his contemporaries made great
statues of gold, many artists who devoted themselves
mainly and altogether to working in the
precious metals executed their best work in
silver. Silver was also largely used for the surfaces
of mirrors, which were hung on the walls
of temples. The best collection of antique silver
plate was found at Hildesheim, in Germany, in
1869, and is now in the Berlin Museum. The
silver stoup (Fig.
615
) belonging to the Corporation
of Norwich, is of the time of Elizabeth.
The illustration (Fig.
614
) of the silver dish and
ewer at St. Johnâs College (1670), is representative
of the change that the goldsmithsâ style
underwent about the middle of the 17th century,
after which time the light and graceful leaf work
gave way to heavier designs. (Consult

dynasty. The same name was applied
to a suction and forcing pump, which was generally
employed as a fire-engine.

Sirens
(Gr.
Î£ÎµÎ¹Ïá¿Î½ÎµÏ
[probably from
ÏÎµÎ¹Ïá½°
, a

chain
, to signify their attractive power]). These
mythical representatives of the evil side of the
seductive power of music, are represented in
art as lovely women to the waist, and fishes
or birds below. Sometimes they have wings,
which the Muses are said to have plucked (see

Muses
) of their feathers; as Orpheus, by opening
their minds to the unattainable higher
music, drove them to suicide in the end. In
Christian symbolism the sirens typify the three

were made to give out a sharp rattling sound.
The Egyptians made use of the sistrum in the
ceremonial worship of Isis and at funerals.
Roman coins of Hadrian present a personification
of Egypt as a female figure seated with the
sacred ibis at her feet, and a
sistrum
in her
hand. The instrument is still in use on the

solarium
; A.S.

Soles of the Feet
, Egyp. and Chr. On a
great number of Christian tombs there occur representations
of the soles of the feet. This
symbol has been variously explained. In our
opinion, one which has never been broached before,
it denoted that the dead were in the
power of God; for among the Egyptians, whenever
a god or powerful king was spoken of, it
was said of him that he put his enemies under
the sole of his foot. Ezekiel uses the same terms
in speaking of Jehovah. Whenever an Egyptian
went on a pilgrimage to a distant place, he
never left the country without engraving on some
stone the impression of his feet, to which he
added his name and titles. (

Tapestry.
The introduction of
tapestry
properly
so called dates from the 12th century,
when it began to rival the more ancient embroidered
stuffs called
Sarrazinois carpets
. Tapestry
is woven on looms, i. e. on a
warp
rolled round
two cylinders, and stretched out between them
either vertically or horizontally, for the insertion
of the
woof
between and among the threads.
When woven on a vertical warp, it is called
high-warp (
haute-lisse
); when horizontal, low-warp
(
basse-lisse
). The former produces, for
many reasons, incomparably the finest work, and
is the method adopted for the Gobelins and
Savonnerie tapestries. The progress of the art
has followed, especially in Flanders, that of
painting, from which its models are derived. It
has become less popular than it was during the
present century, from the general disuse of
hangings in the decoration of houses. Perhaps
the best condensed account of this extensive
subject is the work of M. Alfred de Champeaux,
translated for the South Kensington Museum.

Templum
,
Temple
, R. (
Ïá½³Î¼Î½Ï
, to cut off). A
Greek temple was not originally intended for
worshippers, but as a shrine for the gods.
In the earliest times the Greek temples were
made of wood, and the primitive origin of
them was probably a hollow tree in which the
image was placed as in a niche. The early
Greek temples were dark and gloomy, having
no windows, but lighted through the door, or
by lamps. At a very early stage in history,
temples of great grandeur and beauty are mentioned.
All temples were built in an oblong
or round form, and were mostly adorned
with columns; they were classified accordingly
as
astyle
, without any columns;
in antis
, with
two columns in front, between the
antÃ¦
;
prostyle
,
with four columns in front; or
amphiprostyle
,
with four columns at each end;

peripteral
, with columns at each end and along
the sides; or
dipteral
, with two ranges of columns
all round, one within the other, &c. They
were also described according to the number of
columns in the porticoes, as
tetrastyle
,
hexastyle
,

decastyle
, &c.,âthis number was never uneven;
or according to the intercolumniation, as
pycnostyle
,

systyle
,
eustyle
,
diastyle
, or
arÃ¦ostyle
.
Many of the great temples consisted of
three parts: the
pronaos
or vestibule; the

cella
, properly the
naos
; and the
opisthodomos
.

,
Theatre
, Gr. and R. (
Î¸á½³Î±ÏÏÎ¿Î½
, lit.
a place for seeing). The construction of the
ancient
Greek
theatre was similar to that of
modern theatres. The seats rose one behind
and above the other in concentric half-circles,
and the whole space enclosed was called
cavea
,
the pit, being in most cases a real excavation
from the rock. The central level space within
and below the circles for spectators was covered
with boards, upon which the
chorus
danced and
performed their part. This was the
Orchestra
,
the central point of which and of the plan of the
whole building was the
Thymele
, or altar of
Dionysus. This altar became a
property
of the
piece, doing duty as a funeral monument, an
altar, or a pulpit for the leader of the chorus or
flute-player, according to the nature of the performance
going on, in which it must be remembered
that the part assigned to the
chorus
in the
orchestra below was quite as important as any
other, and in its original intention was in fact
the centre of interest, to which the performance
on the stage was
accessory
. The whole theatre
and orchestra were open to the sky. The cavea
of the former accommodated about 50,000 spectators.
The arrangements of the stage were
elaborate and ingenious, and the art of
scene-painting

developed at a very early period. The

Roman
theatre differed from the Greek principally
in the absence of an
orchestra
, that space
(the modern
pit
) being used for the seats of
senators, foreign ambassadors, &c. Remains of
ancient theatres still exist in Greece, Italy, and
France. The most perfect of these are the
Colosseum at Rome, and the amphitheatre at
Nismes.

Î¸á½³ÏÎ¼Î±Î¹
, lit. hot-springs).
Distinguished from
balneÃ¦
. The luxurious establishments
for bathing, gymnastics, and conversation
which grew up under the Roman
Empire, on which all the resources of architecture
and decorative art were lavished. The

Diocletian are still visible. They contained,
besides the baths properly so called, â
exedrÃ¦

porticoes

for the idle, and libraries for the learned, and
were adorned with marbles and fountains, and
shaded with walks and plantations.â

Thesaurus
, Gr. A treasure-house. In the

agorÃ¦
or the temples. (See
Ãrarium
.)

relief remain, of which castings exist in the
British Museum. Our illustration represents an
incident of the âBattle of the gods and the
giants,â and is remarkable for anatomical precision.
In these sculptures Greek art has entirely
emerged from the
archaic
stage, and they
were doubtless the inspiring models for Pheidias
and his contemporaries, and the forerunners of
the Parthenon sculptures. (See
Elgin Marbles
.)

Thesmo-phoria.
Greek festivals of women
and maidens in honour of Demeter, in commemoration
of the traditions of civilized life.
The solemnities opened with processions of
women bearing on their heads the books of the
sacred laws (ascribed to Demeter). On the

remained all day grouped round the statue of
Demeter in the temple, taking no other food
than cakes of sesame and honey, and in the
afternoon walked barefoot in procession behind
a waggon on which baskets with mystical symbols
were borne to the
thesmophorion

a story that thieves who plundered the dead
bodies during the plague with perfect security,
attributed their impunity to the use of this disinfectant.

his âGlossaryâ the following quotation:â

âOver the midst of the said vault did lie a fair
throwstone
,
and at each either side of the stone it was open,
through which were cast the bones of the monks whose
graves were opened for other monks to lie in; which
vault was made to be a charnel-house to put dead menâs
bones in.â

borne by the attendants on a king. The

Greek
and
Roman
ladies used parasols in all
respects resembling those of modern times. In
the
Panathenaic
procession the daughters of
foreign settlers in Athens had to carry parasols
over the heads of the Athenian maidens
taking part in the procession. They were substituted
later on by broad hats, the Roman

Petasus
and the Greek
Tholia
. In the

Siamese
empire an umbrella is the emblem of
the royal dignity.

Unicorn.
In Christian art a symbol of
purity, especially of female chastity. Attribute
of St. Justina of Antioch. In Heraldry it is
famous as the sinister supporter of the Royal
Shield of England. The legend was that its
body took the form of a horse and antelope, and
it had one horn on its head. It was believed to
live solitary in the woods, and could only be
caught by a maiden. The property of detecting
poison was attributed to its horn, and Hentzner,
who visited England in 1598, says:â

âWe were shown at Windsor the horn of an Unicorn,
of about eight spans and a half in length, valued at above
100
l.
â

It is frequently mentioned in ancient inventories:â

â
1391. Une manche dâor dâun essay de lincourne pour
attoucher aux viandes de Monseigneur le Dauphin.
â

Comptes Royaux
, quoted by Mrs. Bury Palliser.

In allusion to this property, Alviano, the

Valenciennes lace is made entirely on the
pillow, of simple combinations, with one
kind of thread for the pattern and for the
ground. (See engraving.) No lace is so expensive
to make from the number of bobbins
required. The flax used is of the finest quality,
so fine that the lace-makers worked in underground
cellars to keep their work from the air,
and scarcely completed an inch and half of lace
in a day.

Varnishes
are made by dissolving
resins
or
gum-resins in alcohol, ether, &c., so that as the
spirit evaporates the varnish dries down into a
transparent film; varnishes are coloured with
aloes, annotto, cochineal, dragonâs blood, gamboge,
indigo, red saunders, saffron, or turmeric.

Amber varnish
is hardest and most durable in
colour, but dries very slowly.
AnimÃ© varnish

dries quickly, but is liable to crack, and
deepens in colour with exposure to the air.

Copal
ranks next to amber in durability,
and the varnish becomes lighter by exposure;
the best copal varnishes are slow in
drying unless mixed with animÃ©.
Mastic
is a
favourite spirit varnish used as a picture varnish
and for delicate works of a pale colour.
Damar

mixed with mastic makes an appropriate varnish
for maps and similar work. The qualities to be
sought in varnishes for a painting are that they
should resist damp, exclude air, and not injure
the colour. (See also

century. They took their greatest proportions
in the time of Louis XIV. In the early 18th
century also they are described as of immense
size, âlarge enough to have loaded a camel.â
And of this date is the celebrated wig-makerâs
sign, in which Absalom was represented hanging
by the hair in a tree, and King David weeping
beneath, exclaiming,â

âO Absalom! O Absalom!

O Absalom, my son!

If thou hadst worn a
periwig

Thou hadst not been undone.â

Windows.
The earliest of stained glass in
Italy were painted by order of Pope Leo III.,
at Rome, in 795. The windows of some churches
were closed with valves or shutters of stone,
like those of the Duomo of Torcello, erected in
1008. Others were filled with slabs of transparent
talc or alabaster. The earliest painted
glass in York Cathedral is of
A. D.
1200. The
use of glass windows in private houses was not
general until the 14th century. During the
Middle Ages glass windows were in movable
wooden frames, and were taken away by
families when they travelled. (Consult
Hallamâs
Middle Ages
, vol. iii.) Substitutes for glass were
thin parchment or linen, painted and varnished,
or even paper. (
Le Vieil
,
de la Peinture sur
Verre
.) These paper windows may still be
seen in villages in the north of Italy.

Winds
(Latin,
Venti
). The impersonations of
the
winds
were held in high veneration, especially
by the Athenians. The four principal
were Eurus or Vulturnus, the east or south-east
wind; Auster, the south wind, the Notus of the
Greeks, pernicious to plants and men; Zephyrus,
the son of Aurora and father of Carpus
(fruit), a genial, health-bearing breeze, called
also
Î¶ÏÎ·Ïá½¹ÏÎ¿Ï
, life-bearing; and Boreas, the
strong north wind, usually represented with the
feet of a serpent, his wings dripping with golden
dewdrops, and the train of his garment sweeping
along the ground. Inferior
winds
were
Solanus, in Greek Apeliotes, answering to the
east, and represented as a young man holding
fruit in his lap; Africus, south-west, represented
with black wings and melancholy countenance;
Corus, north-west, drives clouds of
snow before him; Aquilo, north-east by north,
equally dreadful in appearance, from
aquila
, an
eagle, type of swiftness and impetuosity.

Windsor Chairs.
A plain kind of strong
wooden chairs, so called.

Wings
, from time immemorial, have been the
Oriental and Egyptian symbol of power as well
as of swiftness; of the spiritual and aerial, in
contradistinction to the human and the earthly;
also in Chaldaic and Babylonian remains, in the
Lycian and Nineveh marbles, and on the gems
and other relics of the Gnostics. In Etruscan
art all their divinities are winged.

driven away from his body after his martyrdom,
by a raven.

Wood-carving.
One of the most ancient
manifestations of the art instinct of humanity is
found in the very earliest relics of every nation.
Especially in Egypt specimens remarkable for
fidelity of representation have been recently disinterred,
and stand in the Boulac Museum.
Among Christian countries Germany is the
most distinguished in this branch of art, but
Holland and Belgium closely rival it in excellence
and abundance of early specimens. Illustrious
English carvers in wood were mostly of
Dutch or German extraction. The most famous
of them is Grinling Gibbons, employed by Sir
Christopher Wren in the decoration of St.
Paulâs Cathedral. He excelled in carving
flowers and foliage.

Wood-engraving
or
Xylography
. Box-wood
is the only kind that can be used. The blocks
when smoothed and polished are prepared for
drawing on, by rubbing the polished surface
with
bath brick
in very fine powder mixed with
water. When this thin coating is dry, it is removed
by rubbing the block on the palm of the
hand; its only use is to make the surface less
slippery. There are four descriptions of cutting
tools used in wood-engraving. The
graver
is
not very different from that used for copper-plate,
but has the point ground to a peculiar
form by rubbing on a
Turkey stone
. Eight or
nine
gravers
, of different sizes, are generally required
commencing with a very fine one, which
is called the
outline tool
, and increasing in size
or breadth.
Tinting
is cutting series of parallel
lines, which, when engraved, form an even and
uniform tint. For this process there is a distinct
set of tools called
tinting tools
.
Gouges
of
different sizes are used for scooping out the wood
towards the centre of the block, and flat tools or

chisels
for cutting it away towards the edges.
The earliest known wood-engraving, âThe
Virgin surrounded by four Saints,â is dated
1418. A print of it is in the Brussels Museum.

Wood-skin.

Wreath.
Wreaths have at all times been
prominent among symbolical personal ornaments;
always with an honourable or pleasant

at Elis in order to inure himself to toil, and that
he tore up many weeds by scraping (
Î¾á½»Ï
, to
scrape,
Î¾Ï
ÏÏá½¹Ï
). The baths and thermÃ¦ at
Rome were furnished with large xysti, in which
young men went through a number of exercises.
The term
xystus
was also generally applied by
the Romans to the beds of rare flowers and
shrubs in the centre of the peristyle; it also denoted
a garden walk perfectly straight, and
planted in a regular style; and lastly, an open
walk or terrace in a garden attached to any
building.

Y.

The letter
Y
is called the letter of Pythagoras
because that philosopher made it the symbol of
life. The foot of the letter, he said, represented
infancy, and as man gradually rises to the age of
reason, he finds two paths set before him, the
one leading to good, the other to evil, portrayed
by two forks of the letter. The illustration is
the device of Jean de Morvilliers (+ 1577),
Chancellor of France; the harrow tied to the
Pythagorean
Î¥
, a
rebus
on his name
Mort-vie-liers
ââDeath
and life united.â The harrow

Zodiacus
,
Zodiac
, Gen. (
Î¶ÏÎ´Î¹Î±Îºá½¸Ï
, i. e. pertaining
to animals). The zone of the celestial
sphere which extends to eight degrees on either
side of the ecliptic. The Egyptians had representations
of it in their temples, the most
celebrated being that of
Denderah
, a cast of
which is at the Louvre. Other zodiacs have
also been found in the great temple of Esneh
and at Contra-Lato. Many monuments of the
Romano-Byzantine and Gothic periods possess
representations of zodiacs. They occur on the
doorways and other parts of churches from the
end of the 10th century. In particular may be
noted the one which figures on the bas-reliefs of
the frieze in the side apsides of the Romano-Auvergniate
church of St. Paul dâIssoire. One
of the largest zodiacs, dating from the beginning
of the 11th century, is that of the church of St.
VÃ©zelay. The series of medallions which surround
the great tympanum representing Christ
and the apostles, contain, independently of the
signs of the zodiac, representations of the agricultural
operations belonging to each month of
the year.

A girdle, used to
gird up the skirts
of the dress for

);
on occasions of
solemnity, as sacrifices
or funerals,
the girdle was relaxed, and the folds of the
dress allowed to hang to the feet (Fig.

);
as a part of the marriage ceremony it was taken
off. Upon the armour of men it supported the
kilt, and was worn round the cuirass (Fig.

705
; cf. Fig.

). It was generally used
as a purse. The celebrated girdle (
cestus
) of
Venus, which conferred beauty and inspired love,
is not represented on the statues of that goddess.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

HIS LOVE STORY

CHAPTER I

A SERIOUS EVENT

Le Comte de Sabron, in the
undress uniform of captain in the
—— Cavalry, sat smoking and thinking....
What is the use of being
thirty years old with the brevet of captain
and much distinction of family if you are
a poor man—in short, what is the good
of anything if you are alone in the world
and no one cares what becomes of you?

He rang his bell, and when his
ordonnance

appeared, said sharply:

"
Que diable
is the noise in the stable,
Brunet?  Don't you know that when I
smoke at this hour all Tarascon must be
kept utterly silent?"

Tarascon is never silent.  No French
meridional town is, especially in the warm
sunlight of a glorious May day.

"The noise,
mon Capitaine
," said Brunet,
"
is
rather melancholy."

"Melancholy!" exclaimed the young
officer.  "It's infernal.  Stop it at once."

The
ordonnance
held his kepi in his
hand.  He had a round good-natured face
and kind gray eyes that were used to
twinkle at his master's humor and caprices.

"I beg pardon,
mon Capitaine
, but a
very serious event is taking place."

"It will be more serious yet, Brunet, if
you don't keep things quiet."

"I am sorry to tell,
mon Capitaine
, that
Michette has just died."

"Michette!" exclaimed the master.
"What relation is she of yours, Brunet?"

"Ah,
mon Capitaine
," grinned the

ordonnance
, "relation!  None!  It is the
little terrier that Monsieur le
Capitaine may have remarked now and then in
the garden."

Sabron nodded and took his cigarette
out of his mouth as though in respect for
the deceased.

"Ah, yes," he said, "
that
melancholy
little dog!  Well, Brunet!"

"She has just breathed her last,
mon
Capitaine
, and she is leaving behind her
rather a large family."

"I am not surprised," said the officer.

"There are six," vouchsafed Brunet,
"of which, if
mon Capitaine
is willing, I
should like to keep one."

"Nonsense," said Sabron, "on no
account.  You know perfectly well, Brunet,
that I don't surround myself with things
that can make me suffer.  I have not kept
a dog in ten years.  I try not to care about
my horses even.  Everything to which I
attach myself dies or causes me regret
and pain.  And I won't have any miserable
little puppy to complicate existence."

"
Bien, mon Capitaine
," accepted the

ordonnance
tranquilly.  "I have given
away five.  The sixth is in the stable; if
Monsieur le Capitaine would come down
and look at it...."

Sabron rose, threw his cigarette away
and, following across the garden in the
bland May light, went into the stable
where Madame Michette, a small wire-haired
Irish terrier had given birth to
a fine family and herself gone the way of
those who do their duty to a race.  In the
straw at his feet Sabron saw a rat-like,
unprepossessing little object, crawling
about feebly in search of warmth and
nourishment, uttering pitiful little cries.
Its extreme loneliness and helplessness
touched the big soldier, who said curtly
to his man:

"Wrap it up, and if you don't know
how to feed it I should not be surprised if
I could induce it to take a little warm
milk from a quill.  At all events we shall
have a try with it.  Fetch it along to my
rooms."

And as he retraced his steps, leaving
his order to be executed, he thought to
himself: The little beggar is not much
more alone in the world than I am!  As
he said that he recalled a word in the
meridional patois:
PitchounÃ©
, which
means "poor little thing."

"I shall call it PitchounÃ©," he thought,
"and we shall see if it can't do better than
its name suggests."

He went slowly back to his rooms and
busied himself at his table with his
correspondence.  Among the letters was an
invitation from the Marquise d'Esclignac,
an American married to a Frenchman,
and the great lady of the country
thereabouts.

"Will you not," she wrote, "come to
dine with us on Sunday?  I have my niece
with me.  She would be glad to see a
French soldier.  She has expressed such
a wish.  She comes from a country where
soldiers are rare.  We dine at eight."

Sabron looked at the letter and its fine
clear handwriting.  Its wording was less
formal than a French invitation is likely
to be, and it gave him a sense of
cordiality.  He had seen, during his rides, the
beautiful lines of the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac.
Its turrets surely looked upon the
Rhone.  There would be a divine view
from the terraces.  It would be a pleasure
to go there.  He thought more of what
the place would be than of the people in
it, for he was something of a hermit,
rather a recluse, and very reserved.

He was writing a line of acceptance
when Brunet came in, a tiny bundle in his
hand.

"Put PitchounÃ© over there in the sunlight,"
ordered the officer, "and we shall
see if we can bring him up by hand."

CHAPTER II

JULIA REDMOND

He remembered all his life the
first dinner at the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac,
where from the terrace he saw
the Rhone lying under the early moonlight
and the shadows falling around the castle
of good King RenÃ©.

As he passed in, his sword clanking—for
he went in full dress uniform to dine
with the Marquise d'Esclignac—he saw
the picture the two ladies made in their
drawing-room: the marquise in a very
splendid dress (which he never could
remember) and her niece, a young lady
from a country whose name it took him
long to learn to pronounce, in a dress so
simple that of course he never could
forget it!  He remembered for a great many
years the fall of the ribbon at her pretty
waist, the bunch of sweet peas at her
girdle, and he always remembered the
face that made the charm of the picture.

Their welcome to him was gracious.
The American girl spoke French with an
accent that Sabron thought bewilderingly
charming, and he put aside some of his
reserve and laughed and talked at his ease.
After dinner (this he remembered with
peculiar distinctness) Miss Redmond sang
for him, and although he understood none
of the words of the English ballad, he
learned the melody by heart and it
followed with him when he left.  It went
with him as he crossed the terrace into
the moonlight to mount his horse; it went
home with him; he hummed it, and when
he got up to his room he hummed it
again as he bent over the little roll of
flannel in the corner and fed the puppy
hot milk from a quill.

This was a painstaking operation and
required patience and delicacy, both of
which the big man had at his finger-tips.
The tune of Miss Redmond's song did for
a lullaby and the puppy fell comfortably
to sleep while Sabron kept the picture of
his evening's outing contentedly in his
mind.  But later he discovered that he
was not so contented, and counted the
hours when he might return.

He shortly made a call at the ChÃ¢teau
d'Esclignac with the result that he had
a new picture to add to his collection.
This time it was the picture of a lady
alone; the Marquise d'Esclignac doing
tapestry.  While Sabron found that he
had grown reticent again, he listened for
another step and another voice and heard
nothing; but before he took leave there
was a hint of a second invitation to dinner.

The marquise was very handsome that
afternoon and wore yet another bewildering
dress.  Sabron's simple taste was dazzled.
Nevertheless, she made a graceful
picture, one of beauty and refinement,
and the young soldier took it away with
him.  As his horse began to trot, at the
end of the alley, near the poplars at the
lower end of the rose terrace he caught a
glimpse of a white dress (undoubtedly a
simpler dress than that worn by Madame
d'Esclignac).

CHAPTER III

A SECOND INVITATION

"I don't think,
mon Capitaine
, that
it is any use," Brunet told his master.

Sabron, in his shirt-sleeves, sat before a
table on which, in a basket, lay Michette's
only surviving puppy.  It was a month
old.  Sabron already knew how bright its
eyes were and how alluring its young ways.

"Be still, Brunet," commanded the
officer.  "You do not come from the south
or you would be more sanguine.
PitchounÃ© has
got
to live."

The puppy's clumsy adventuresome feet
had taken him as far as the highroad, and
on this day, as it were in order that he
should understand the struggle for
existence, a bicycle had cut him down in the
prime of his youth, and now, according
to Brunet, "there wasn't much use!"

PitchounÃ© was bandaged around his
hind quarters and his adorable little head
and forepaws came out of the handkerchief
bandage.

"He won't eat anything from me,
mon
Capitaine
," said Brunet, and Sabron
ceremoniously opened the puppy's mouth and
thrust down a dose.  PitchounÃ© swallowed
obediently.

Sabron had just returned from a long
hard day with his troops, and tired out
as he was, he forced himself to give his
attention to PitchounÃ©.  A second invitation
to dinner lay on his table; he had
counted the days until this night.  It
seemed too good to be true, he thought,
that another picture was to add itself to
his collection!  He had mentally enjoyed
the others often, giving preference to the
first, when he dined at the chÃ¢teau; but
there had been a thrill in the second
caused by the fluttering of the white dress
down by the poplar walk.

To-night he would have the pleasure
of taking in Miss Redmond to dinner.

"See, mon Capitaine," said Brunet, "the
poor little fellow can't swallow it."

The water trickled out from either side
of PitchounÃ©'s mouth.  The sturdy terrier
refused milk in all forms, had done so
since Sabron weaned him; but Sabron
now returned to his nursery days, made
Brunet fetch him warm milk and, taking
the quill, dropped a few drops of the
soothing liquid, into which he put a dash
of brandy, down PitchounÃ©'s throat.
PitchounÃ© swallowed, got the drink down.
gave a feeble yelp, and closed his eyes.
When he opened them the glazed look had
gone.

The officer hurried into his evening
clothes and ordered Brunet, as he tied
his cravat, to feed the puppy a little of
the stimulant every hour until he should
return.  PitchounÃ©'s eyes, now open,
followed his handsome master to the door.
As Sabron opened it he gave a pathetic
yelp which made the
capitaine
turn about.

"Believe me,
mon Capitaine
," said the

ordonnance
with melancholy fatality, "it
is no use.  If I am left with PitchounÃ©
it will be to see him die.  I know his spirit,

mon Capitaine
.  He lives for you alone."

"Nonsense," said the young officer
impatiently, drawing on his gloves.

PitchounÃ© gave a plaintive wail from
the bandages and tried to stir.

"As for feeding him,
mon Capitaine
,"
the
ordonnance
threw up his hands, "he
will be stiff by the time..."

But Sabron was half-way down the
stairs.  The door was open, and on the
porch he heard distinctly a third tenderly
pathetic wail.

* * * * * * *

That evening the Marquise d'Esclignac
read aloud to her niece the news that
the Count de Sabron was not coming to
dinner.  He was "absolutely desolated"
and had no words to express his regret
and disappointment.  The pleasure of
dining with them both, a pleasure to which
he had looked forward for a fortnight,
must be renounced because he was obliged
to sit up with a very sick friend, as there
was no one else to take his place.  In
expressing his undying devotion and his
renewed excuses he put his homage at their
feet and kissed their hands.

The Marquise d'Esclignac, wearing
another very beautiful dress, looked up at
her niece, who was playing at the piano.

"A very poor excuse, my dear Julia,
and a
very
late one."

"It sounds true, however.  I believe
him, don't you,
ma tante
?"

"I do
not
," said the marquise emphatically.
"A Frenchman of good education
is not supposed to refuse a dinner invitation
an hour before he is expected.  Nothing
but a case of life and death would
excuse it."

"He says a Very sick friend.'"

"Nonsense," exclaimed the marquise.

Miss Redmond played a few bars of
the tune Sabron had hummed and which
more than once had soothed PitchounÃ©,
and which, did she know, Sabron was
actually humming at that moment.

"I am rather disappointed," said the
young girl, "but if we find it is a matter
of life and death,
ma tante
, we will
forgive him?"

The Marquise d'Esclignac had invited
the Count de Sabron because she had been
asked to do so by his colonel, who was an
old and valued friend.  She had other
plans for her niece.

"I feel, my dear," she answered her
now, "quite safe in promising that if it
is a question of life and death we shall
forgive him.  I shall see his colonel
to-morrow and ask him pointblank."

Miss Redmond rose from the piano and
came over to her aunt, for dinner had
been announced.

"Well, what do you think," she slipped
her hand in her aunt's arm, "really, what
do you think
could
be the reason?"

"Please don't ask me," exclaimed the
Marquise d'Esclignac impatiently.  "The

reasons
for young men's caprices are
sometimes just as well not inquired into."

If Sabron, smoking in his bachelor
quarters, lonely and disappointed, watching
with an extraordinary fidelity by his
"sick friend," could have seen the two
ladies at their grand solitary dinner, his
unfilled place between them, he might
have felt the picture charming enough to
have added to his collection.

CHAPTER IV

THE DOG PAYS

PitchounÃ© repaid what was given him.

He did not think that by getting well,
reserving the right for the rest of his
life to a distinguished limp in his right
leg, that he had done all that was
expected of him.  He developed an ecstatic
devotion to the captain, impossible for any
human heart adequately to return.  He
followed Sabron like a shadow and when
he could not follow him, took his place on
a chair in the window, there to sit, his
sharp profile against the light, his pointed
ears forward, watching for the uniform
he knew and admired extravagantly.

PitchounÃ© was a thoroughbred, and
every muscle and fiber showed it, every
hair and point asserted it, and he loved as
only thoroughbreds can.  You may say
what you like about mongrel attachments,
the thoroughbred in all cases reserves his
brilliancy for crises.

Sabron, who had only seen Miss Redmond
twice and thought about her countless
times, never quite forgave his friend
for the illness that kept him from the
chÃ¢teau.  There was in Sabron's mind,
much as he loved PitchounÃ©, the feeling
that if he had gone that night...

There was never another invitation!

"
Voyons, mon cher
," his colonel had
said to him kindly the next time he met
him, "what stupidity have you been guilty
of at the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac?"

Poor Sabron blushed and shrugged his shoulders.

"I assure you," said the colonel, "that
I did you harm there without knowing
it.  Madame d'Esclignac, who is a very
clever woman, asked me with interest
and sympathy, who your 'very sick
friend' could be.  As no one was very
sick according to my knowledge, I told
her so.  She seemed triumphant and I
saw at once that I had put you in the
wrong."

It would have been simple to have explained
to the colonel, but Sabron, reticent
and reserved, did not choose to do so.  He
made a very insufficient excuse, and the
colonel, as well as the marquise, thought
ill of him.  He learned later, with chagrin,
that his friends were gone from the Midi.
Rooted to the spot himself by his duties,
he could not follow them.  Meanwhile
PitchounÃ© thrived, grew, cheered his
loneliness, jumped over a stick, learned a trick
or two from Brunet and a great many
fascinating wiles and ways, no doubt
inherited from his mother.  He had a sense of
humor truly Irish, a power of devotion
that we designate as "canine," no doubt
because no member of the human race has
ever deserved it.

CHAPTER V

THE GOLDEN AUTUMN

Sabron longed for a change with
autumn, when the falling leaves made
the roads golden roundabout the ChÃ¢teau
d'Esclignac.  He thought he would like
to go away.  He rode his horse one day up
to the property of the hard-hearted
unforgiving lady and, finding the gate open,
rode through the grounds up to the
terrace.  Seeing no one, he sat in his saddle
looking over the golden country to the
Rhone and the castle of the good King
RenÃ©, where the autumn mists were like
banners floating from the towers.

There was a solitary beauty around the
lovely place that spoke to the young
officer with a sweet melancholy.  He fancied
that Miss Redmond must often have
looked out from one of the windows, and
he wondered which one.  The terrace was
deserted and leaves from the vines
strewed it with red and golden specters.
PitchounÃ© raced after them, for the wind
started them flying, and he rolled his
tawny little body over and over in the
rustling leaves.  Then a rabbit, which
before the arrival of Sabron had been sitting
comfortably on the terrace stones, scuttled
away like mad, and PitchounÃ©, somewhat
hindered by his limp, tore after it.

The deserted chÃ¢teau, the fact that
there was nothing in his military life
beyond the routine to interest him now in
Tarascon, made Sabron eagerly look
forward to a change, and he waited for
letters from the minister of war which
would send him to a new post.

The following day after his visit to the
chÃ¢teau he took a walk, PitchounÃ© at his
heels, and stood aside in the highroad to
let a yellow motor pass him, but the
yellow motor at that moment drew up to the
side of the road while the chauffeur got
out to adjust some portion of the
mechanism.  Some one leaned from the yellow
motor window and Sabron came forward
to speak to the Marquise d'Esclignac
and another lady by her side.

"How do you do, Monsieur?  Do you remember us?"

(Had he ever forgotten them?)  He
regretted so very much not having been
able to dine with them in the spring.

"And your sick friend?" asked Madame
d'Esclignac keenly, "did he recover?"

"Yes," said Sabron, and Miss Redmond,
who leaned forward, smiled at him
and extended her pretty hand.  Sabron
opened the motor door.

"What a darling dog!" Miss Redmond
cried.  "What a bewitching face he has!
He's an Irish terrier, isn't he?"

Sabron called PitchounÃ©, who diverted
his attention from the chauffeur to come
and be hauled up by the collar and
presented.  Sabron shook off his reticence.

"Let me make a confession," he said
with a courteous bow.  "This is my 'very
sick friend.'  PitchounÃ© was at the point
of death the night of your dinner and I
was just leaving the house when I realized
that the helpless little chap could not
weather the breeze without me.  He had
been run over by a bicycle and he needed
some very special care."

Miss Redmond's hand was on PitchounÃ©'s
head, between his pointed ears.
She looked sympathetic.  She looked
amused.  She smiled.

"It was a question of 'life and death,'
wasn't it?" she said eagerly to Sabron.

"Really, it was just that," answered the
young officer, not knowing how significant
the words were to the two ladies.

Then Madame d'Esclignac knew that
she was beaten and that she owed something
and was ready to pay.  The chauffeur
got up on his seat and she asked suavely:

"Won't you let us take you home, Monsieur Sabron?"

He thanked them.  He was walking
and had not finished his exercise.

"At all events," she pursued, "now that
your excuse is no longer a good one, you
will come this week to dinner, will you not?"

He would, of course, and watched the
yellow motor drive away in the autumn
sunlight, wishing rather less for the order
from the minister of war to change his
quarters than he had before.

CHAPTER VI

ORDERED AWAY

He had received his letter from
the minister of war.  Like many
things we wish for, set our hopes upon,
when they come we find that we do not
want them at any price.  The order was
unwelcome.  Sabron was to go to Algiers.

Winter is never very ugly around
Tarascon.  Like a lovely bunch of fruit
in the brightest corner of a happy
vineyard, the Midi is sheltered from the rude
experiences that the seasons know farther
north.  Nevertheless, rains and winds,
sea-born and vigorous, had swept in and
upon the little town.  The mistral came
whistling and Sabron, from his window,
looked down on his little garden from
which summer had entirely flown.  PitchounÃ©,
by his side, looked down as well,
but his expression, different from his
master's, was ecstatic, for he saw, sliding
along the brick wall, a cat with which he
was on the most excited terms.  His body
tense, his ears forward, he gave a sharp
series of barks and little soft growls, while
his master tapped the window-pane to the
tune of Miss Redmond's song.

Although Sabron had heard it several
times, he did not know the words or that
they were of a semi-religious, extremely
sentimental character which would have
been difficult to translate into French.  He
did not know that they ran something like
this:

"God keep you safe, my love,

All through the night;

Rest close in His encircling arms

Until the light."

And there was more of it.  He only
knew that there was a pathos in the tune
which spoke to his warm heart; which
caressed and captivated him and which
made him long deeply for a happiness he
thought it most unlikely he would ever
know.

There had been many pictures added to
his collection: Miss Redmond at dinner,
Miss Julia Redmond—he knew her first
name now—before the piano; Miss Redmond
in a smart coat, walking with him
down the alley, while PitchounÃ© chased
flying leaves and apparitions of rabbits
hither and thither.

The Count de Sabron had always
dreaded just what happened to him.  He
had fallen in love with a woman beyond
his reach, for he had no fortune
whatsoever, nothing but his captain's pay and
his hard soldier's life, a wanderer's life
and one which he hesitated to ask a
woman to share.  In spite of the fact that
Madame d'Esclignac was agreeable to
him, she was not cordial, and he understood
that she did not consider him a
parti

for her niece.  Other guests, as well as
he, had shared her hospitality.  He had
been jealous of them, though he could not
help seeing Miss Redmond's preference
for himself.  Not that he wanted to help
it.  He recalled that she had really sung
to him, decidedly walked by his side when
there had been more than the quartette,
and he felt, in short, her sympathy.

"PitchounÃ©," he said to his companion,
"we are better off in Algiers,
mon vieux
.
The desert is the place for us.  We shall
get rid of fancies there and do some hard
fighting one way or another."

PitchounÃ©, whose eyes had followed
the cat out of sight, sprang upon his
master and seemed quite ready for the new
departure.

"I shall at least have you," Sabron said.
"It will be your first campaign.  We shall
have some famous runs and I shall
introduce you to a camel and make you
acquainted with several donkeys, not to
speak of the historic Arab steeds.  You
will see, my friend, that there are other
animals besides yourself in creation."

"A telegram for
mon capitaine
."  Brunet
came in with the blue envelope which
Sabron tore open.

"
You will take with you neither horses
nor dogs.
"

It was an order from the minister of
war, just such a one as was sent to some
half-dozen other young officers, all of
whom, no doubt, felt more or less discomfited.

Sabron twisted the telegram, put it in
the fireplace and lighted his cigarette with
it, watching PitchounÃ© who, finding himself
a comfortable corner in the armchair,
had settled down for a nap.

"So," nodded the young man aloud, "I
shall not even have PitchounÃ©."

He smoked, musing.  In the rigid discipline
of his soldier's life he was used to
obedience.  His softened eyes, however,
and his nervous fingers as they pulled at
his mustache, showed that the command
had touched him.

"What shall I do with you, old fellow?"

Sabron and PitchounÃ©

Although Sabron's voice was low, the
dog, whose head was down upon his paws,
turned his bright brown eyes on his
master with so much confidence and affection
that it completed the work.  Sabron
walked across the floor, smoking, the
spurs on his heels clanking, the light
shining on his brilliant boots and on his
form.  He was a splendid-looking man
with race and breeding, and he combined
with his masculine force the gentleness of
a woman.

"They want me to be lonely," he
thought.  "All that the chiefs consider is
the soldier—not the man—even the
companionship of my dog is denied me.  What
do they think I am going to do out there
in the long eastern evenings?"  He
reflected.  "What does the world expect an
uncompanioned wanderer to do?"  There
are many things and the less thought
about them, the better.

"A letter for Monsieur le Capitaine."  Brunet
returned with a note which he
presented stiffly, and PitchounÃ©, who chose
in his little brain to imagine Brunet an
intruder, sprang from the chair like lightning,
rushed at the servant, seized the leg
of his pantaloons and began to worry
them, growling, Brunet regarding him
with adoration.  Sabron had not thought
aloud the last words of the telegram,
which he had used to light his cigarette.

"... Nor will it be necessary to
take a personal servant.  The indigenes
are capable
ordonnances
."

As he took the letter from Brunet's
salver he said curtly:

"I am ordered to Algiers and I shall
not take horses nor PitchounÃ©."

The dog, at the mention of his name,
set Brunet's leg free and stood quiet, his
head lifted.

"Nor you either,
mon
brave Brunet."  Sabron
put his hand on his servant's
shoulder, the first familiarity he had ever
shown a man who served him with devotion,
and who would have given his life
to save his master's.  "Those," said the
officer curtly, "are the orders from
headquarters, and the least said about them
the better."

The ruddy cheek of the servant turned
pale.  He mechanically touched his forehead.

"
Bien, mon Capitaine
," he murmured,
with a little catch in his voice.  He stood
at attention, then wheeled and without
being dismissed, stalked out of the room.

PitchounÃ© did not follow.  He remained
immovable like a little dog cut from
bronze; he understood—who shall say—how
much of the conversation?  Sabron
threw away his cigarette, then read his
letter by the mantelpiece, leaning his
arm upon it.  He read slowly.  He had
broken the seal slowly.  It was the first
letter he had ever seen in this handwriting.
It was written in French and ran thus:

"Monsieur:—My aunt wishes me to ask
you if you will come to us for a little
musicale to-morrow afternoon.  We hope
you will be free, and
I
hope," she added,
"that you will bring PitchounÃ©.  Not that
I think he will care for the music, but
afterward perhaps he will run with us as we
walk to the gate.  My aunt wishes me to
say that she has learned from the colonel
that you have been ordered to Algiers.
In this way she says that we shall have an
opportunity of wishing you bon voyage,
and I say I hope PitchounÃ© will be a
comfort to you."

The letter ended in the usual formal
French fashion.  Sabron, turning the
letter and rereading it, found that it
completed the work that had been going on in
his lonely heart.  He stood long, musing.

PitchounÃ© laid himself down on the
rug, his bright little head between his
paws, his affectionate eyes on his master.
The firelight shone on them both, the
musing young officer and the almost
human-hearted little beast.  So Brunet found them
when he came in with the lamp shortly,
and as he set it down on the table and
its light shone on him, Sabron, glancing
at the
ordonnance
, saw that his eyes were
red, and liked him none the less for it.

CHAPTER VII

A SOLDIER'S DOG

"It is just as I thought," he told
PitchounÃ©.  "I took you into my life,
you little rascal, against my will, and now,
although it's not your fault, you are
making me regret it.  I shall end, PitchounÃ©,
by being a cynic and misogynist, and learn
to make idols of my career and my troops
alone.  After all, they may be tiresome,
but they don't hurt as you do, and some
other things as well."

PitchounÃ©, being invited to the musicale
at the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac, went along
with his master, running behind the
captain's horse.  It was a heavenly January
day, soft and mild, full of sunlight and
delicious odors, and over the towers of
King RenÃ©'s castle the sky banners were
made of celestial blue.

The officer found the house full of
people.  He thought it hard that he might
not have had one more intimate picture
to add to his collection.  When he entered
the room a young man was playing a
violoncello.  There was a group at the piano,
and among the people the only ones he
clearly saw were the hostess, Madame
d'Esclignac in a gorgeous velvet frock,
then Miss Redmond, who stood by the
window, listening to the music.  She saw
him come in and smiled to him, and from
that moment his eyes hardly left her.

What the music was that afternoon the
Count de Sabron could not have told very
intelligently.  Much of it was sweet, all of
it was touching, but when Miss Redmond
stood to sing and chose the little song of
which he had made a lullaby, and sang it
divinely, Sabron, his hands clasped behind
his back and his head a little bent,
still looking at her, thought that his heart
would break.  It was horrible to go away
and not tell her.  It was cowardly to feel so
much and not be able to speak of it.  And
he felt that he might be equal to some
wild deed, such as crossing the room
violently, putting his hand over her
slender one and saying:

"I am a soldier; I have nothing but a
soldier's life.  I am going to Africa
to-morrow.  Come with me; I want you.  Come!"

All of which, slightly impossible and
quite out of the question, nevertheless
charmed and soothed him.  The words of
her English song, almost barbaric to him
because incomprehensible, fell on his ears.
Its melody was already part of him.

"Monsieur de Sabron," said Madame
d'Esclignac, "you are going away to-morrow?"

"Yes, Madame."

"I expect you will be engaged in some
awful native skirmishes.  Perhaps you
will even be able to send back a tiger skin."

"There are no tigers in that part of
Africa, Madame."

The young soldier's dark eyes rested
almost hostilely on the gorgeous marquise
in her red gown.  He felt that she was
glad to have him go.  He wanted to say:
"I shall come back, however; I shall come
back and when I return" ... but he
knew that such a boast, or even such a
hope was fruitless.

His colonel had told him only the day
before that Miss Redmond was one of the
richest American heiresses, and there was
a question of a duke or a prince and
heaven only knew what in the way of
titles.  As the marquise moved away her
progress was something like the rolling of
an elegant velvet chair, and while his
feelings were still disturbed Miss
Redmond crossed the room to him.  Before
Sabron quite knew how they had been
able to escape the others or leave the
room, he was standing with her in the
winter garden where the sunlight came in
through trellises and the perfume of the
warmed plants was heavy and sweet.
Below them flowed the Rhone, golden in the
winter's light.  The blue river swept its
waves around old Tarascon and the
battlements of King RenÃ©'s towers.

"You are going to Algiers to-morrow,
Monsieur de Sabron?"  Miss Redmond
smiled, and how was Sabron to realize
that she could not very well have wept
there and then, had she wished to do so?

"Yes," he said.  "I adore my regiment.
I love my work.  I have always wanted to
see colonial service."

"Have you?  It is delightful to find
one's ambitions and desires satisfied,"
said Miss Redmond.  "I have always
longed to see the desert.  It must be
beautiful.  Of course you are going to take
PitchounÃ©?"

"Ah!" exclaimed Sabron, "that is just
what I am not going to do."

"What!" she cried.  "You are never going
to leave that darling dog behind you?"

"I must, unfortunately.  My superior
officers do not allow me to take horses or
dogs, or even my servant."

"Heavens!" she exclaimed.  "What
brutes they are!  Why, PitchounÃ© will die
of a broken heart."  Then she said: "You
are leaving him with your man servant?"

Sabron shook his head.

"Brunet would not be able to keep him."

"Ah!" she breathed.  "He is looking
for a home?  Is he?  If so, would you
... might
I
take care of PitchounÃ©?"

The Frenchman impulsively put out his
hand, and she laid her own in it.

"You are too good," he murmured.
"Thank you.  PitchounÃ© will thank you."

He kissed her hand.  That was all.

From within the salon came the noise
of voices, and the bow of the violoncellist
was beginning a new concerto.  They
stood looking at each other.  No condition
could have prevented it although the
Marquise d'Esclignac was rolling toward
them across the polished floor of the
music-room.  As though Sabron realized
that he might never see this lovely young
woman again, probably never would see
her, and wanted before he left to have
something made clear, he asked quickly:

"Could you, Mademoiselle, in a word
or two tell me the meaning of the English
song you sang?"

She flushed and laughed slightly.

"Well, it is not very easy to put it in
prose," she hesitated.  "Things sound so
differently in music and poetry; but it
means," she said in French, bravely, "why,
it is a sort of prayer that some one you
love very much should be kept safe night
and day.  That's about all.  There is a
little sadness in it, as though," and her
cheeks glowed, "as if there was a sort of
separation.  It means..."

"Ah!" breathed the officer deeply, "I
understand.  Thank you."

And just then Madame d'Esclignac
rolled up between them and with an
unmistakable satisfaction presented to her
niece the gentleman she had secured.

"My dear Julia, my godson, the Duc
de Tremont."  And Sabron bowed to both
the ladies, to the duke, and went away.

This was the picture he might add to
his collection: the older woman in her
vivid dress, Julia in her simpler gown, and
the titled Frenchman bowing over her hand.

When he went out to the front terrace
Brunet was there with his horse, and
PitchounÃ© was there as well, stiffly
waiting at attention.

"Brunet," said the officer to his man,
"will you take PitchounÃ© around to the
servants' quarters and give him to Miss
Redmond's maid?  I am going to leave
him here."

"Good,
mon Capitaine
," said the
ordonnance
,
and whistled to the dog.

PitchounÃ© sprang toward his master
with a short sharp bark.  What he
understood would be hard to say, but all that
he wanted to do was to remain with
Sabron.  Sabron bent down and stroked him.

"Go, my friend, with Brunet.  Go,
mon
vieux
, go," he commanded sternly, and
the little dog, trained to obedience as a
soldier's dog should be, trotted reluctantly
at the heels of the
ordonnance
, and the
soldier threw his leg over the saddle and
rode away.  He rode regardless of
anything but the fact that he was going.

CHAPTER VIII

HOMESICK

PitchounÃ© was a soldier's dog,
born in a stable, of a mother who had
been dear to the canteen.  Michette had
been
une vrai
vivandiÃ¨re, a real daughter
of the regiment.

PitchounÃ© was a worthy son.  He
adored the drums and trumpets.  He
adored the fife.  He adored the drills
which he was accustomed to watch from
a respectable distance.  He liked Brunet,
and the word had not yet been discovered
which would
express
how he felt toward
Monsieur le Capitaine, his master.
His muscular little form expressed it in
every fiber.  His brown eyes looked it
until their pathos might have melted a heart
of iron.

There was nothing picturesque to
PitchounÃ© in the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac
or in the charming room to which he was
brought.  The little dog took a flying
tour around it, over sofas and chairs,
landing on the window-seat, where he
crouched.  He was not wicked, but he
was perfectly miserable, and the lovely
wiles of Julia Redmond and her
endearments left him unmoved.  He refused
meat and drink, was indifferent to the
views from the window, to the beautiful
view of King RenÃ©'s castle, to the
tantalizing cat sunning herself against the
wall.  He flew about like mad, leaving
destruction in his wake, tugged at the leash
when they took him out for exercise.  In
short, PitchounÃ© was a homesick, lovesick
little dog, and thereby endeared himself
more than ever to his new mistress.  She
tied a ribbon around his neck, which he
promptly chewed and scratched off.  She
tried to feed him with her own fair hands;
he held his head high, looked bored and
grew thin in the flanks.

"I think Captain de Sabron's little dog
is going to die,
ma tante
," she told her
aunt.

"Fiddlesticks, my dear Julia!  Keep him
tied up until he is accustomed to the place.
It won't hurt him to fast; he will eat when
he is hungry.  I have a note from Robert.
He has not gone to Monte Carlo."

"Ah!" breathed Miss Redmond indifferently.

She slowly went over to her piano and
played a few measures of music that
were a torture to PitchounÃ©, who found
these ladylike performances in strong
contrast to drums and trumpets.  He felt
himself as a soldier degraded and could
not understand why he should be relegated
to a salon and to the mild society
of two ladies who did not even know how
to pull his ears or roll him over on the
rug with their riding boots and spurs.  He
sat against the window as was his habit,
looking, watching, yearning.

"
Vous avez tort, ma chÃ¨re,
" said her
aunt, who was working something less
than a thousand flowers on her tapestry.
"The chance to be a princess and a
Tremont does not come twice in a young
girl's life, and you know you have only
to be reasonable, Julia."

Miss Redmond's fingers wandered,
magnetically drawn by her thoughts, into
a song which she played softly through.
PitchounÃ© heard and turned his beautiful
head and his soft eyes to her.  He knew
that tune.  Neither drums nor trumpets
had played it but there was no doubt
about its being fit for soldiers.  He had
heard his master sing it, hum it, many
times.  It had soothed his nerves when
he was a sick puppy and it went with
many things of the intimate life with his
master.  He remembered it when he had
dozed by the fire and dreamed of chasing
cats and barking at Brunet and being a
faithful dog all around; he heard again
a beloved voice hum it to him.  PitchounÃ©
whined and softly jumped down from his
seat.  He put his forepaws on Miss
Redmond's lap.  She stopped and caressed
him, and he licked her hand.

"That is the first time I have seen that
dog show a spark of human gratitude,
Julia, He is probably begging you to
open the door and let him take a run."

Indeed PitchounÃ© did go to the door
and waited appealingly.

"I think you might trust him out.  I
think he is tamed," said the Marquise
d'Esclignac.  "He is a real little savage."

Miss Redmond opened the door and
PitchounÃ© shot out.  She watched him
tear like mad across the terrace, and
scuttle into the woods, as she thought,
after a rabbit.  He was the color of the
fallen leaves and she lost sight of him in
the brown and golden brush.

CHAPTER IX

THE FORTUNES OF WAR

Sabron's departure had been
delayed on account of a strike at the
dockyards of Marseilles.  He left
Tarascon one lovely day toward the end of
January and the old town with its sweetness
and its sorrow, fell behind, as he rolled
away to brighter suns.  A friend from
Paris took him to the port in his motor
and there Sabron waited some forty-eight
hours before he set sail.  His boat lay out
on the azure water, the brown rocks of the
coast behind it.  There was not a ripple
on the sea.  There was not a breeze to stir
as he took the tug which was to convey
him.  He was inclined to dip his fingers
in the indigo ocean, sure that he would
find them blue.  He climbed up the ladder
alongside of the vessel, was welcomed
by the captain, who knew him, and turned
to go below, for he had been suffering
from an attack of fever which now and
then laid hold of him, ever since his
campaign in Morocco.

Therefore, as he went into his cabin,
which he did not leave until the steamer
touched Algiers, he failed to see the
baggage tender pull up and failed to see a
sailor climb to the deck with a wet
bedraggled thing in his hand that looked
like an old fur cap except that it wriggled
and was alive.

"This,
mon commandant
," said the
sailor to the captain, "is the pluckiest
little beast I ever saw."

He dropped a small terrier on the deck,
who proceeded to shake himself vigorously
and bark with apparent delight.

"No sooner had we pushed out from
the quay than this little beggar sprang
from the pier and began to swim after us.
He was so funny that we let him swim
for a bit and then we hauled him in.  It
is evidently a mascot, mon commandant,
evidently a sailor dog who has run away
to sea."

The captain looked with interest at
PitchounÃ©, who engaged himself in making
his toilet and biting after a flea or two
which had not been drowned.

"We sailors," said the man saluting,
"would like to keep him for luck,
mon
commandant
."

"Take him down then," his superior
officer ordered, "and don't let him up
among the passengers."

* * * * * * *

It was a rough voyage.  Sabron passed
his time saying good-by to France and
trying to keep his mind away from
the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac, which persisted
in haunting his uneasy slumber.  In a
blaze of sunlight, Algiers, the white
city, shone upon them on the morning
of the third day and Sabron tried to
take a more cheerful view of a soldier's
life and fortunes.

He was a soldierly figure and a
handsome one as he walked down the
gangplank to the shore to be welcomed by
fellow officers who were eager to see him,
and presently was lost in the little crowd
that streamed away from the docks into
the white city.

CHAPTER X

TOGETHER AGAIN

That night after dinner and a
cigarette, he strode into the streets
to distract his mind with the sight of the
oriental city and to fill his ears with the
eager cries of the crowd.  The lamps
flickered.  The sky overhead was as blue
nearly as in daytime.  He walked leisurely
toward the native quarter, jostled, as
he passed, by men in their brilliant
costumes and by a veiled woman or two.

He stopped indifferently before a little
cafÃ©, his eyes on a Turkish bazaar where
velvets and scarfs were being sold at
double their worth under the light of a
flaming yellow lamp.  As he stood so, his
back to the cafÃ© where a number of the
ship's crew were drinking, he heard a
short sharp sound that had a sweet
familiarity about it and whose individuality
made him start with surprise.  He could
not believe his ears.  He heard the bark
again and then he was sprung upon by a
little body that ran out from between the
legs of a sailor who sat drinking his coffee
and liquor.

"Gracious heavens!" exclaimed Sabron,
thinking that he must be the victim of a
hashish dream.  "PitchounÃ©!"

The dog fawned on him and whined,
crouched at his feet whining—like a child.
Sabron bent and fondled him.  The sailor
from the table called the dog imperatively,
but PitchounÃ© would have died at his
master's feet rather than return.  If his
throat could have uttered words he would
have spoken, but his eyes spoke.  They
looked as though they were tearful.

"PitchounÃ©,
mon vieux
!  No, it can't
be PitchounÃ©.  But it
is
PitchounÃ©!"  And
Sabron took him up in his arms.  The
dog tried to lick his face.

"
Voyons,
" said the officer to the
marine, who came rolling over to them,
"where did you get this dog?"

The young man's voice was imperative
and he fixed stern eyes on the sailor, who
pulled his forelock and explained.

"He was following me," said Sabron,
not without a slight catch in his voice.
The body of PitchounÃ© quivered under
his arm.  "He is my dog.  I think his
manner proves it.  If you have grown fond
of him I am sorry for you, but I think
you will have to give him up."

Sabron put his hand in his pocket and
turned a little away to be free of the
native crowd that, chattering and grinning,
amused and curious and eager to participate
in any distribution of coin, was
gathering around him.  He found two gold
pieces which he put into the hand of the
sailor.

"Thank you for taking care of him.  I
am at the Royal Hotel."  He nodded, and
with PitchounÃ© under his arm pushed his
way through the crowd and out of the
bazaar.

He could not interview the dog himself,
although he listened, amused, to
PitchounÃ©'s own manner of speech.  He
spent the latter part of the evening
composing a letter to the minister of war, and
although it was short, it must have
possessed certain evident and telling qualities,
for before he left Algiers proper for the
desert, Sabron received a telegram much
to the point:

"You may keep your dog.  I congratulate
you on such a faithful companion."

CHAPTER XI

A SACRED TRUST

His eyes had grown accustomed to
the glare of the beautiful sands,
but his sense of beauty was never satisfied
with looking at the desert picture and
drinking in the glory and the loveliness
of the melancholy waste.  Standing in
the door of his tent in fatigue uniform,
he said to PitchounÃ©:

"I could be perfectly happy here if I
were not alone."

PitchounÃ© barked.  He had not grown
accustomed to the desert.  He hated it.
It slipped away from under his little
feet; he could not run on it with any
comfort.  He spent his days idly in his
master's tent or royally perched on a
camel, crouching close to Sabron's man
servant when they went on caravan
explorations.

"Yes," said Sabron, "if I were not
alone.  I don't mean you,
mon vieux
.  You
are a great deal, but you really don't
count, you know."

Before his eyes the sands were as pink
as countless rose leaves.  To Sabron they
were as fragrant as flowers.  The peculiar
incense-like odor that hovers above the
desert when the sun declines was to him
the most delicious thing he had ever
inhaled.  All the west was as red as fire.
The day had been hot and there came up
the cool breeze that would give them a
delicious night.  Overhead, one by one,
he watched the blossoming out of the
great stars; each one hung above his
lonely tent like a bridal flower in a veil of
blue.  On all sides, like white petals on
the desert face, were the tents of his men
and his officers, and from the encampment
came the hum of military life, yet
the silence to him was profound.  He had
only to order his stallion saddled and to
ride away for a little distance in order to
be alone with the absolute stillness.

This he often did and took his thoughts
with him and came back to his tent more
conscious of his solitude every night of
his life.

There had been much looting of caravans
in the region by brigands, and his
business was that of sentinel for the
commerce of the plains.  Thieving and
rapacious tribes were under his eye and his
care.  To-night, as he stood looking
toward the west into the glow, shading his
eyes with his hand, he saw coming toward
them what he knew to be a caravan from
Algiers.  His
ordonnance
was a native
soldier, one of the desert tribes, black as
ink, and scarcely more child-like than
Brunet and presumably as devoted.

"Mustapha," Sabron ordered, "fetch me
out a lounge chair."  He spoke in French
and pointed, for the man understood
imperfectly and Sabron did not yet speak
Arabic.

He threw himself down, lighted a fresh
cigarette, dragged PitchounÃ© by the nape
of his neck up to his lap, and the two sat
watching the caravan slowly grow into
individuals of camels and riders and
finally mass itself in shadow within some four
or five hundred yards of the encampment.

The sentinels and the soldiers began to
gather and Sabron saw a single footman
making his way toward the camp.

"Go," he said to Mustapha, "and see
what message the fellow brings to the
regiment."

Mustapha went, and after a little
returned, followed by the man himself, a
black-bearded, half-naked Bedouin,
swathed in dust-colored burnoose and
carrying a bag.

He bowed to Captain de Sabron and
extended the leather bag.  On the outside
of the leather there was a ticket pasted,
which read:

"The Post for the —— Squadron of Cavalry—"

Sabron added mentally:

"—
wherever it may happen to be!
"

He ordered bakshish given to the man
and sent him off.  Then he opened the
French mail.  He was not more than three
hundred miles from Algiers.  It had taken
him a long time to work down to Dirbal,
however, and they had had some hardships.
He felt a million miles away.  The
look of the primitive mail-bag and the
knowledge of how far it had traveled to
find the people to whom these letters were
addressed made his hands reverent as he
unfastened the sealed labels.  He looked
the letters through, returned the bag to
Mustapha and sent him off to distribute
the post.

Then, for the light was bad, brilliant
though the night might be, he went into
his tent with his own mail.  On his
dressing-table was a small illumination consisting
of a fat candle set in a glass case.  The
mosquitoes and flies were thick around it.
PitchounÃ© followed him and lay down
on a rush mat by the side of Sabron's
military bed, while the soldier read his
letter.

"Monsieur:—

"I regret more than ever that I can not
write your language perfectly.  But even
in my own I could not find any word
to express how badly I feel over
something which has happened.

"I took the best of care of PitchounÃ©.
I thought I did, but I could not make him
happy.  He mourned terribly.  He
refused to eat, and one day I was so
careless as to open the door for him and we
have never seen him since.  As far as I
know he has not been found.  Your man,
Brunet, comes sometimes to see my maid,
and he thinks he has been hurt and died
in the woods."

Sabron glanced over to the mat where
PitchounÃ©, stretched on his side, his
forelegs wide, was breathing tranquilly in the
heat.

"We have heard rumors of a little dog
who was seen running along the highway,
miles from Tarascon, but of course
that could not have been PitchounÃ©."

Sabron nodded.  "It was, however,
mon
brave
," he said to the terrier.

"Not but what I think his little heart
was brave enough and valiant enough to
have followed you, but no dog could go
so far without a better scent."

Sabron said: "It is one of the regrets
of my life that you can not tell us about
it.  How did you get the scent?  How did
you follow me?"  PitchounÃ© did not stir,
and Sabron's eyes returned to the page.

"I do not think you will ever forgive
us.  You left us a trust and we did not
guard it."

He put the letter down a moment,
brushed some of the flies away from the
candle and made the wick brighter.
Mustapha came in, black as ebony, his woolly
head bare.  He stood as stiff as a ramrod
and as black.  In his child-like French
he said:

"Monsieur le Lieutenant asks if Monsieur
le Capitaine will come to play a game
of
cartÃ©
in the mess tent?"

"No," said Sabron, without turning.
"Not to-night."  He went on with his letter:

"... a sacred trust."

Half aloud he murmured: "I left a
very sacred trust at the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac,
Mademoiselle; but as no one knew
anything about it there will be no question
of guarding it, I dare say."

"... So I write you this letter to
tell you about darling PitchounÃ©.  I had
grown to love him though he did not like
me.  I miss him terribly....  My
aunt asks me to say that she hopes you
had a fine crossing and that you will send
us a tiger skin; but I am sure there are no
tigers near Algiers.
I
say..."

And Sabron did not know how long
Miss Redmond's pen had hesitated in
writing the closing lines:

"... I say I hope you will be successful
and that although nothing can
take the place of PitchounÃ©, you will find
some one to make the desert less solitary.

"Sincerely yours,

"JULIA REDMOND."

When Sabron had read the letter several
times he kissed it fervently and put
it in his pocket next his heart.

"That," he said to PitchounÃ©, making
the dog an unusual confidence, "that will
keep me less lonely.  At the same time it
makes me more so.  This is a paradox,

mon vieux
, which you can not understand."

CHAPTER XII

THE NEWS FROM AFRICA

It took the better part of three
evenings to answer her letter, and the
writing of it gave Sabron a vast amount
of pleasure and some tender sorrow.  It
made him feel at once so near to this
lovely woman and at once so far away.
In truth there is a great difference
between a spahi on an African desert, and
a young American heiress dreaming in
her chintz-covered bedroom in a chÃ¢teau
in the Midi of France.

Notwithstanding, the young American
heiress felt herself as much alone in her
chintz-covered bedroom and as desolate,
perhaps more so, than did Sabron in his
tent.  Julia Redmond felt, too, that she
was surrounded by people hostile to her
friend.

Sabron's letter told her of PitchounÃ©
and was written as only the hand of a
charming and imaginative Frenchman can
write a letter.  Also, his pent-up heart and
his reserve made what he did say stronger
than if perhaps he could have expressed
it quite frankly.

Julia Redmond turned the sheets that
told of PitchounÃ©'s following his master,
and colored with joy and pleasure as she
read.  She wiped away two tears at the
end, where Sabron said:

"Think of it, Mademoiselle, a little dog
following his master from peace and
plenty, from quiet and security, into the
desert!  And think what it means to have
this little friend!"

Julia Redmond reflected, was greatly
touched and loved PitchounÃ© more than
ever.  She would have changed places
with him gladly.  It was an honor, a
distinction to share a soldier's exile and to
be his companion.  Then Sabron wrote,
in closing words which she read and
reread many, many times.

"Mademoiselle, in this life many things
follow us; certain of these follow us
whether we will or not.  Some things
we are strong enough to forbid, yet we
do not forbid them!  My little dog
followed me; I had nothing to do with that.
It was a question of fate.  Something else
has followed me as well.  It is not a
living thing, and yet it has all the qualities
of vitality.  It is a tune.  From the
moment I left the chÃ¢teau the first night I
had the joy of seeing you, Mademoiselle,
the tune you sang became a companion
to me and has followed me everywhere
... followed me to my barracks, followed
me across the sea, and here in my
tent it keeps me company.  I find that
when I wake at night the melody sings
to me; I find that when I mount my horse
and ride with my men, when the desert's
sands are shifted by my horse's feet,
something sings in the sun and in the
heat, something sings in the chase and in
the pursuit, and in the nights, under the
stars, the same air haunts me still.

"I am glad you told me what the words
mean, for I find them beautiful; the
music in it would not be the same without
the strength and form of the words.  So
it is, Mademoiselle, with life.  Feelings
and sentiments, passions and emotions, are
like music.  They are great and beautiful;
they follow us, they are part of us, but
they would be nothing—music would be
nothing without forms by which we could
make it audible—appealing not to our
senses alone but to our souls!

"And yet I must close my letter sending
you only the tune; the words I
can not

send you, yet believe me, they form part
of everything I do or say.

"To-morrow, I understand from my
men, we shall have some lively work to
do.  Whatever that work is you will hear
of it through the papers.  There is a little
town near here called Dirbal, inhabited
by a poor tribe whose lives have been
made miserable by robbers and slave-dealers.
It is the business of us watchers of
the plains to protect them, and I believe
we shall have a lively skirmish with the
marauders.  There is a congregation of
tribes coming down from the north.  When
I go out with my people to-morrow it
may be into danger, for in a wandering
life like this, who can tell?  I do not mean
to be either morbid or sentimental.  I only
mean to be serious, Mademoiselle, and I
find that I am becoming so serious that
it will be best to close.

"Adieu, Mademoiselle.  When you look
from your window on the Rhone Valley
and see the peaceful fields of Tarascon,
when you look on your peaceful gardens,
perhaps your mind will travel farther
and you will think of Africa.  Do so if
you can, and perhaps to-night you will
say the words only of the song before you
go to sleep.

"I am, Mademoiselle,

"Faithfully yours,

"CHARLES DE SABRON."

There was only one place for a letter
such as that to rest, and it rested on that
gentle pillow for many days.  It proved a
heavy weight against Julia Redmond's
heart.  She could, indeed, speak the
words of the song, and did, and they rose
as a nightly prayer for a soldier on the
plains; but she could not keep her mind
and thoughts at rest.  She was troubled
and unhappy; she grew pale and thin;
she pined more than PitchounÃ© had pined,
and she, alas! could not break her chains
and run away.

The Duc de Tremont was a constant
guest at the house, but he found the
American heiress a very capricious and
uncertain lady, and Madame d'Esclignac
was severe with her niece.

"My dear Julia," she said to the
beautiful girl, looking at her through her
lorgnon; "I don't understand you.  Every
one of your family has married a title.
We have not thought that we could do
better with our money than build up
fortunes already started; than in preserving
noble races and noble names.  There has
never been a divorce in our family.  I am
a marquise, your cousin is a countess, your
aunt is one of the peeresses of England,
and as for you, my dear..."

Miss Redmond was standing by the
piano.  She had lifted the cover and was
about to sit down to play.  She smiled
slightly at her aunt, and seemed in the
moment to be the older woman.

"There are titles and titles,
ma tante
:
the only question is what kind do you
value the most?"

"The highest!" said her aunt without
hesitation, "and the Duc de Tremont is
undoubtedly one of the most famous

partis
in Europe."

"He will then find no difficulty in
marrying," said the young girl, "and I do not
wish to marry a man I do not love."

She sat down at the piano and her
hands touched the keys.  Her aunt, who
was doing some dainty tapestry, whose
fingers were creating silken flowers and
whose mind was busy with fancies and
ambitions very like the work she created,
shrugged her shoulders.

"That seems to be," she said keenly,
"the only tune you know, Julia."

"It's a pretty song,
ma tante
."

"I remember that you played and sang
it the first night Sabron came to dinner."  The
girl continued to finger among the
chords.  "And since then never a day
passes that sometime or other you do
not play it through."

"It has become a sort of
oraison, ma tante
."

"Sabron," said the marquise, "is a fine
young man, my child, but he has nothing
but his officer's pay.  Moreover, a soldier's
life is a precarious one."

Julia Redmond played the song softly
through.

The old butler came in with the
evening mail and the papers.  The Marquise
d'Esclignac, with her embroidery
scissors, opened
Le Temps
from Paris and
began to read with her usual interest.  She
approached the little lamp on the table
near her, unfolded the paper and looked
over at her niece, and after a few
moments, said with a slightly softened voice:

"Julia!"  Miss Redmond stopped playing.
"Julia!"  The girl rose from the
piano-stool and stood with her hand on
the instrument.

"My dear Julia!"  Madame d'Esclignac
spread
Le Temps
out and put her
hand on it.  "As I said to you, my child,
the life of a soldier is a precarious one."

"
Ma tante
," breathed Miss Redmond
from where she stood.  "Tell me what
the news is from Africa.  I think I know
what you mean."

She could not trust herself to walk
across the floor, for Julia Redmond in
that moment of suspense found the room
swimming.

"There has been an engagement," said
the marquise gently, for in spite of her
ambitions she loved her niece.  "There
has been an engagement, Julia, at Dirbal."  She
lifted the newspaper and held it
before her face and read:

"There has been some hard fighting
in the desert, around about Dirbal.  The
troops commanded by Captain de Sabron
were routed by the natives at noon on
Thursday.  They did not rally and were
forced to retreat.  There was a great
loss of life among the natives and
several of the regiment were also killed.
There has been no late or authentic
news from Dirbal, but the last
despatches give the department of war to
understand that Sabron himself is among
the missing."

The Marquise d'Esclignac slowly put
down the paper, and rose quickly.  She
went to the young girl's side and put her
arm around her.  Miss Redmond covered
her face with her hands:

"
Ma tante, ma tante!
" she murmured.

"My dear Julia," said the old lady,
"there is nothing more uncertain than
newspaper reports, especially those that
come from the African seat of war.  Sit
down here, my child."

The two women sat together on the
long piano-stool.  The marquise said:

"I followed the fortunes, my dear, of
my husband's cousin through the engagement
in Tonkin.  I know a little what it
was."  The girl was immovable.  Her
aunt felt her rigid by her side.  "I told
you," she murmured, "that a soldier's life
was a precarious one."

Miss Redmond threw away all disguise.

"
Ma tante,
" she said in a hard voice.
"I love him!  You must have known it
and seen it.  I love him!  He is
becoming my life."

As the marquise looked at the girl's
face and saw her trembling lips and her
wide eyes, she renounced her ambitions
for Julia Redmond.  She renounced them
with a sigh, but she was a woman of the
world, and more than that to a woman.
She remained for a moment in silence,
holding Julia's hands.

She had followed the campaign of her
husband's cousin, a young man with an
insignificant title whom she had not
married.  In this moment she relived again
the arrival of the evening papers; the
despatches, her husband's news of his
cousin.  As she kissed Julia's cheeks a
moisture passed over her own eyes, which
for many years had shed no tears.

"Courage, my dear," she implored, "we
will telegraph at once to the minister of
war for news."

The girl drew a convulsive breath and
turned, and leaning both elbows on the
piano keys—perhaps in the very notes
whose music in the little song had charmed
Sabron—she burst into tears.  The marquise
rose and passed out of the room to
send a man with a despatch to Tarascon.

CHAPTER XIII

ONE DOG'S DAY

There must be a real philosophy
in all proverbs.  "Every dog has his
day" is a significant one.  It surely was for
PitchounÃ©.  He had his day.  It was a
glorious one, a terrible one, a memorable one,
and he played his little part in it.  He
awoke at the gray dawn, springing like
a flash from the foot of Sabron's bed,
where he lay asleep, in response to the
sound of the reveille, and Sabron sprang
up after him.

PitchounÃ© in a few moments was in the
center of real disorder.  All he knew
was that he followed his master all day
long.  The dog's knowledge did not
comprehend the fact that not only had the
native village, of which his master spoke
in his letter to Miss Redmond, been
destroyed, but that Sabron's regiment itself
was menaced by a concerted and concentrated
attack from an entire tribe, led by
a fanatic as hotminded and as fierce as
the Mahdi of Sudanese history.

PitchounÃ© followed at the heels of his
master's horse.  No one paid any
attention to him.  Heaven knows why he was
not trampled to death, but he was not.
No one trod on him; no horse's hoof hit
his little wiry form that managed in the
midst of carnage and death to keep itself
secure and his hide whole.  He smelt the
gunpowder, he smelt the smoke, sniffed at
it, threw up his pretty head and barked,
puffed and panted, yelped and tore about
and followed.  He was not conscious of
anything but that Sabron was in motion;
that Sabron, his beloved master, was
in action of some kind or other and he,
a soldier's dog, was in action, too.  He
howled at fierce dark faces, when he saw
them.  He snarled at the bullets that
whistled around his ears and, laying his
little ears back, he shook his black muzzle
in the very grin of death.

Sabron's horse was shot under him,
and then PitchounÃ© saw his master,
sprang upon him, and his feelings were
not hurt that no attention was paid him,
that not even his name was called, and as
Sabron struggled on, PitchounÃ© followed.
It was his day; he was fighting the
natives; he was part of a battle; he was a
soldier's dog!  Little by little the creatures
and things around him grew fewer, the
smoke cleared and rolled away, there were
a few feet of freedom around him in
which he stood and barked; then he was
off again close to his master's heels and
not too soon.  He did not know the blow
that struck Sabron, but he saw him fall,
and then there came into his canine heart
some knowledge of the importance of his
day.  He had raced himself weary.  Every
bone in his little body ached with fatigue.

Sabron lay his length on the bed of a
dried-up river, one of those phantom-like
channels of a desert stream whose course
runs watery only certain times of the year.
Sabron, wounded in the abdomen, lay
on his side.  PitchounÃ© smelled him
from head to foot, addressed himself to
his restoration in his own way.  He licked
his face and hands and ears, sat sentinel
at the beloved head where the forehead
was covered with sweat and blood.  He
barked feverishly and to his attentive ears
there came no answer whatsoever, either
from the wounded man in the bed of the
African river or from the silent plains.

Sabron was deserted.  He had fallen
and not been missed and his regiment,
routed by the Arabs, had been driven into
retreat.  Finally the little dog, who knew
by instinct that life remained in his
master's body, set himself at work vigorously
to awaken a sign of life.  He attacked
Sabron's shoulder as though it were a
prey; he worried him, barked in his ear,
struck him lightly with his paw, and
finally, awakening to dreadful pain, to fever
and to isolation, awakening perhaps to the
battle for life, to the attentions of his
friend, the spahi opened his eyes.

Sabron's wound was serious, but his
body was vigorous, strong and healthy,
and his mind more so.  There was a film
over it just now.  He raised himself with
great effort, and in a moment realized
where he was and that to linger there was
a horrible death.  On each side of the
river rose an inclined bank, not very high
and thickly grown with mimosa bush.
This meant to him that beyond it and
probably within easy reach, there would
be shade from the intense and dreadful
glare beating down upon him,
with death in every ray.  He groaned and
PitchounÃ©'s voice answered him.  Sabron
paid no attention to his dog, did not even
call his name.  His mind, accustomed to
quick decisions and to a matter-of-fact
consideration of life, instantly took its
proper course.  He must get out of the
river bed or die there, rot there.

What there was before him to do was
so stupendous an undertaking that it
made him almost unconscious of the pain
in his loins.  He could not stand, could
not thoroughly raise himself; but by great
and painful effort, bleeding at every move,
he could crawl; he did so, and the sun
beat upon him.  PitchounÃ© walked by his
side, whining, talking to him, encouraging
him, and the spahi, ashen pale, his bright
gray uniform ripped and stained, all alone
in the desert, with death above him and
death on every hand, crawled, dragged,
hitched along out of the river to the bank,
cheered, encouraged by his little dog.

For a drop of water he would have
given—oh, what had he to give?  For a
little shade, he would have given—about
all he had to give had been given to his
duty in this engagement which could never
bring him glory, or distinction or any
renown.  The work of a spahi with a
native regiment is not a very glorious
affair.  He was simply an officer who fell
doing his daily work.

PitchounÃ© barked and cried out to him:
"Courage!"

"I shall die here at the foot of the
mimosa," Sabron thought; and his hands
hardly had the courage or strength to
grasp the first bushes by which he meant
to pull himself up on the bank.  The little
dog was close to him, leaping, springing
near him, and Sabron did not know how
tired and thirsty and exhausted his brave
little companion was, or that perhaps in
that heroic little body there was as much
of a soldier's soul as in his own human
form.

The sun was so hot that it seemed to
sing in the bushes.  Its torrid fever struck
on his brow, struck on his chest; why did
it not kill him?  He was not even
delirious, and yet the bushes sang dry and
crackling.  What was their melody?  He
knew it.  Just one melody haunted him
always, and now he knew the words: they
were a prayer for safety.

"But," Sabron said aloud, "it is a
prayer to be said at night and not in the
afternoon of an African hell."

He began to climb; he pulled himself
along, leaving his track in blood.

He fainted twice, and the thick growth
held him like the wicker of a cradle, and
before he came to his consciousness the
sun was mercifully going down.  He finally
reached the top of the bank and lay
there panting.  Not far distant were the
bushes of rose and mimosa flower, and
still panting, weaker and ever weaker,
his courage the only living thing in him,
Sabron, with PitchounÃ© by his side,
dragged himself into healing hands.

All that night Sabron was delirious;
his mind traveled far into vague fantastic
countries, led back again, ever gently, by
a tune, to safety.

Every now and then he would realize
that he was alone on the vast desert,
destined to finish his existence here, to cease
being a human creature and to become
nothing but carrion.  Moments of
consciousness succeeded those of mental
disorder.  Every now and then he would feel
PitchounÃ© close to his arm.  The dog
licked his hand and the touch was grateful
to the deserted officer.  PitchounÃ©
licked his master's cheek and Sabron felt
that there was another life beside his in
the wilderness.  Neither dog nor man
could long exist, however, without food
or drink, and Sabron was growing
momentarily weaker.

The Frenchman, though a philosopher,
realized how hard it was to die unsatisfied
in love, unsatisfied in life, having
accomplished nothing, having wished many
things and realized at an early age only
death!  Then this point of view changed
and the physical man was uppermost.

He groaned for water, he groaned for
relief from pain, turned his head from
side to side, and PitchounÃ© whined softly.
Sabron was not strong enough to speak
to him, and their voices, of man and
beast, inarticulate, mingled—both left to
die in the open.

Then Sabron violently rebelled and
cried out in his soul against fate and
destiny.  He could have cursed the day he
was born.  Keenly desirous to live, to
make his mark and to win everything a
man values, why should he be picked and
chosen for this lonely pathetic end?
Moreover, he did not wish to suffer like
this, to lose his grasp on life, to go on
into wilder delirium and to die!  He knew
enough of injuries to feel sure that his
wound alone could not kill him.  When
he had first dragged himself into the shade
he had fainted, and when he came to
himself he might have stanched his blood.
His wound was hardly bleeding now.  It
had already died!  Fatigue and thirst,
fever would finish him, not his hurt.  He
was too young to die.

With great effort he raised himself on
his arm and scanned the desert stretching
on all sides like a rosy sea.  Along the
river bank the pale and delicate blossom
and leaf of the mimosa lay like a bluish
veil, and the smell of the evening and the
smell of the mimosa flower and the
perfumes of the weeds came to him, aromatic
and sweet.  Above his head the blue sky
was ablaze with stars and directly over
him the evening star hung like a crystal
lamp.  But there was no beauty in it for
the wounded officer who looked in vain
to the dark shadows on the desert that
might mean approaching human life.  It
would be better to die as he was dying,
than to be found by the enemy!

The sea of waste rolled unbroken as far
as his fading eyes could reach.  He sank
back with a sigh, not to rise again, and
closed his eyes and waited.  He slept a
short, restless, feverish sleep, and in it
dreams chased one another like those
evoked by a narcotic, but out of them,
over and over again came the picture of
Julia Redmond, and she sang to him the
song whose words were a prayer for the
safety of a loved one during the night.

From that romantic melody there
seemed to rise more solemn ones.  He
heard the rolling of the organ in the
cathedral in his native town, for he came
from Rouen originally, where there is one
of the most beautiful cathedrals in the
world.  The music rolled and rolled and
passed over the desert's face.  It seemed
to lift his spirit and to cradle it.  Then he
breathed his prayers,—they took form,
and in his sleep he repeated the
Ave Maria

and the
Paternoster
, and the words
rolled and rolled over the desert's face
and the supplication seemed to his
feverish mind to mingle with the stars.

A sort of midnight dew fell upon him:
so at least he thought, and it seemed to
him a heavenly dew and to cover him like
a benignant rain.  He grew cooler.  He
prayed again, and with his words there
came to the young man an ineffable sense
of peace.  He pillowed his fading
thoughts upon it; he pillowed his aching
mind upon it and his body, too, and the
pain of his wound and he thought aloud,
with only the night airs to hear him, in
broken sentences: "If this is death it is
not so bad.  One should rather be afraid
of life.  This is not difficult, if I should
ever get out of here I shall not regret this
night."

Toward morning he grew calmer, he
turned to speak to his little companion.
In his troubled thoughts he had forgotten
PitchounÃ©.

Sabron faintly called him.  There was
no response.  Then the soldier listened in
silence.  It was absolutely unbroken.  Not
even the call of a night-bird—not even
the cry of a hyena,—nothing came to him
but the inarticulate voice of the desert.
Great and solemn awe crept up to him,
crept up to him like a spirit and sat down
by his side.  He felt his hands grow cold,
and his feet grow cold.  Now, unable to
speak aloud, there passed through his
mind that this, indeed, was death, desertion
absolute in the heart of the plains.

CHAPTER XIV

AN AMERICAN GIRL

The Marquise d'Esclignac saw that
she had to reckon with an American
girl.  Those who know these girls
know what their temper and mettle are,
and that they are capable of the finest
reverberations.

Julia Redmond was very young.  Otherwise
she would never have let Sabron go
without one sign that she was not indifferent
to him, and that she was rather bored
with the idea of titles and fortunes.  But
she adored her aunt and saw, moreover,
something else than ribbons and velvets in
the make-up of the aunt.  She saw deeper
than the polish that a long Parisian
lifetime had overlaid, and she loved what she
saw.  She respected her aunt, and knowing
the older lady's point of view, had
been timid and hesitating until now.

Now the American girl woke up, or
rather asserted herself.

"My dear Julia," said the Marquise
d'Esclignac, "are you sure that all the
tinned things, the cocoa, and so forth, are
on board?  I did not see that box."

"
Ma tante
," returned her niece from
her steamer chair, "it's the only piece of
luggage I am sure about."

At this response her aunt suffered a
slight qualm for the fate of the rest of
her luggage, and from her own chair in
the shady part of the deck glanced
toward her niece, whose eyes were on her
book.

"What a practical girl she is,"
thought the Marquise d'Esclignac.  "She
seems ten years older than I.  She is cut
out to be the wife of a poor man.  It is
a pity she should have a fortune.  Julia
would have been charming as love in a
cottage, whereas I..."

She remembered her hotel on the Parc
Monceau, her chÃ¢teau by the Rhone, her
villa at Biarritz—and sighed.  She had
not always been the Marquise d'Esclignac;
she had been an American girl first
and remembered that her maiden name
had been De Puyster and that she had
come from Schenectady originally.  But
for many years she had forgotten these
things.  Near to Julia Redmond these
last few weeks all but courage and
simplicity had seemed to have tarnish on its
wings.

Sabron had not been found.

It was a curious fact, and one that
transpires now and then in the history of
desert wars—the man is lost.  The
captain of the cavalry was missing, and the
only news of him was that he had fallen
in an engagement and that his body had
never been recovered.  Several sorties
had been made to find him; the war
department had done all that it could; he
had disappeared from the face of the
desert and even his bones could not be
found.

From the moment that Julia Redmond
had confessed her love for the
Frenchman, a courage had been born in her
which never faltered, and her aunt seemed
to have been infected by it.  The
marquise grew sentimental, found out that
she was more docile and impressionable
than she had believed herself to be, and
the veneer and etiquette (no doubt never
a very real part of her) became less
important than other things.  During the
last few weeks she had been more a De
Puyster from Schenectady than the
Marquise d'Esclignac.

"
Ma tante
," Julia Redmond had said
to her when the last telegram was brought
in to the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac, "I shall
leave for Africa to-morrow."

"My dear Julia!"

"He is alive!  God will not let him
die.  Besides, I have prayed.  I believe in
God, don't you?"

"Of course, my dear Julia."

"Well," said the girl, whose pale cheeks
and trembling hands that held the
telegram made a sincere impression on her
aunt, "well, then, if you believe, why do
you doubt that he is alive?  Some one
must find him.  Will you tell Eugene to
have the motor here in an hour?  The
boat sails to-morrow,
ma tante
."

The marquise rolled her embroidery
and put it aside for twelve months.  Her
fine hands looked capable as she did so.

"My dear Julia, a young and handsome
woman can not follow like a daughter of
the regiment, after the fortunes of a soldier."

"But a Red Cross nurse can,
ma tante
,
and I have my diploma."

"The boat leaving to-morrow, my dear
Julia, doesn't take passengers."

"Oh,
ma tante
!  There will be no other
boat for Algiers," she opened the
newspaper, "until ... oh, heavens!"

"But Robert de Tremont's yacht is in
the harbor."

Miss Redmond looked at her aunt
speechlessly.

"I shall telegraph Madame de Haussonvelle
and ask permission for you to go in
that as an auxiliary of the Red Cross to
Algiers, or, rather, Robert is at Nice.  I
shall telegraph him."

"Oh,
ma tante
!"

"He asked me to make up my own
party for a cruise on the Mediterranean,"
said the Marquise d'Esclignac thoughtfully.

Miss Redmond fetched the telegraph
blank and the pad from the table.  The
color began to return to her cheeks.  She
put from her mind the idea that her aunt
had plans for her.  All ways were fair in
the present situation.

The Marquise d'Esclignac wrote her
despatch, a very long one, slowly.  She
said to her servant:

"Call up the Villa des Perroquets at
Nice.  I wish to speak with the Duc de
Tremont."  She then drew her niece very
gently to her side, looking up at her as a
mother might have looked.  "Darling
Julia, Monsieur de Sabron has never told
you that he loved you?"

Julia shook her head.

"Not in words,
ma tante
."

There was a silence, and then Julia
Redmond said:

"I only want to assure myself that he
is safe, that he lives.  I only wish to
know his fate."

"But if you go to him like this,
ma
chÃ¨re
, he will think you love him.  He
must marry you!  You are making a
serious declaration."

"Ah," breathed the girl from between
trembling lips, "don't go on.  I shall be
shown the way."

The Marquise d'Esclignac then said,
musing:

"I shall telegraph to England for
provisions.  Food is vile in Algiers.  Also,
Melanie must get out our summer clothes."

"
Ma tante!
" said Julia Redmond, "
our

summer clothes?"

"Did you think you were going alone,
my dear Julia!"

She had been so thoroughly the American
girl that she had thought of nothing
but going.  She threw her arms around
her aunt's neck with an abandon that
made the latter young again.  The
Marquise d'Esclignac kissed her niece tenderly.

"Madame la Marquise, Monsieur le
Duc de Tremont is at the telephone," the
servant announced to her from the doorway.

CHAPTER XV

JULIA'S ROMANCE

From her steamer chair the
Marquise d'Esclignac asked:

"Are you absorbed in your book, Julia?"

Miss Redmond faintly smiled as she
laid it down.  She was absorbed in but
one thing, morning, noon and night,
waking or sleeping: when and where she
should find him; how he was being treated.
Had he been taken captive?  He was
not dead, of that she was sure.

"What is the book, Julia?"

"
Le Conte d'un Spahi.
"

"Put it down and let me speak to you
of Robert de Tremont."

Miss Redmond, being his guest and
indebted to him for her luxurious transportation,
could not in decency refuse the request.

"He knows nothing whatever of our
errand, Julia."

"Ah, then, what does he think?"

Miss Redmond on the arm of her blue
serge coat wore a band of white, in the
center of which gleamed the Red Cross.
The marquise, wrapped in a sable rug,
held a small Pekinese lap-dog cuddled
under her arm, and had only the appearance
of a lady of leisure bent on a pleasure
excursion.  She did not suggest a rescuing
party in the least.  Her jaunty hat was
enveloped by a delicate veil; her hands were
incased in long white gloves.  Now that
she had encouraged her energetic niece
and taken this decisive step, she relaxed
and found what pleasure she might in the
voyage.

"When we came on board last night,
my dear, you remember that I sat with
Robert in the salon until ... well,
latish."

"After midnight?"

"Possibly; but I am fifty and he is
thirty.  Moreover, I am his godmother.
He is enchanting, Julia, spiritual and
sympathetic.  I confess, my dear, that I find
myself rather at a loss as to what to tell
him."

Miss Redmond listened politely.  She
was supremely indifferent as to what had
been told to her host.  This was Tuesday;
they should reach Algiers on Saturday
at the latest.  What news would meet
them there?  She held in her book the
last despatch from the ministry of war.
Supposing the Captain de Sabron had
been taken captive by some marauding
tribe and was being held for a ransom!

This
was the
Romance of a Spahi
, in
which she was absorbed.
Taken
captive
!  She could not let herself think
what that might mean.

"Robert's mother, you know, is my
closest friend.  His father was one of the
witnesses of my marriage.  I feel that I
have brought up Robert ... it would
have been
so perfect
."  She sighed.

"
Ma tante!
" warned Miss Redmond,
with a note of pain in her voice.

"Yes, yes," accepted the marquise, "I
know, my dear, I know.  But you can not
escape from the yacht except in a
lifeboat, and if you
did
it would be one of
Robert's lifeboats!  You must not be too
formal with him."  She tapped the nose
of her Pekinese dog.  "Be still, Mimi,

that
man is only a sailor! and if he were
not here and at his duty you would be
drowned, you little goose!"

The Pekinese dog was a new addition.
Julia tried not to dislike her; for Julia,
only PitchounÃ© existed.  She could not
touch Mimi without a sense of disloyalty.

The boat cut the azure water with its
delicate white body, the decks glistened
like glass.  The sailor at whom Mimi
had barked passed out of sight, and far
up in the bow Tremont, in white flannels,
stood smoking.

"I had to be very circumspect, my dear
Julia, when I talked with Robert.  You
see you are not engaged to Monsieur de
Sabron."  The girl colored.  "The
sentimental woman in me," her aunt went on,
"has responded to all your fantasies, but
the practical woman in me calls me a
romantic goose."

"Ah," breathed Miss Redmond, opening
her book, "
ma tante
, let me read."

"Nonsense," said the marquise
affectionately.  "The most important part of
the whole affair is that we are here—that
we are en route to Algiers, is it not?"

The girl extended her hand gratefully.

"And thank you!  Tell me, what did
you say to him?"

The marquise hummed a little tune, and
softly pulled Mimi's ears.

"Remember, my child, that if we find
Monsieur de Sabron, the circumspection
will have to be even greater still."

"Leave that to me,
ma tante
."

"You don't know," said the determined
lady quite sweetly, "that he has the

slightest
desire to marry you, Julia."

Miss Redmond sat up in her chair, and
flamed.

"Do you want to make me miserable?"

"I intend to let my worldly wisdom
equal this emergency, Julia.  I want
Robert to have no suspicion of the facts."

"How can we prevent it,
ma tante
?"

"We can do so if you will obey me."

The girl started, and her aunt, looking
up at the Duc de Tremont where he stood
in the bow, saw that he showed signs of
finishing his smoke and of joining them.

"
Ma tante
," said the girl quickly, "have
you brought me here under false colors?
Have you let him think..."

"Hush, Julia, you are indebted to him
for accomplishing your own desire."

"But I would never, never..."

"
Petite sotte
," cried the marquise, "then
you would never have been on this yacht."

Intensely troubled and annoyed, Julia
asked in a low tone:

"For heaven's sake,
ma tante
, tell me
what the Duc de Tremont thinks!"

Her aunt laughed softly.  The intrigue
and romance of it all entertained her.  She
had the sense of having made a very
pretty concession to her niece, of having
accomplished a very agreeable pleasure
trip for herself.  As for young Sabron,
he would be sure to be discovered at the
right moment, to be lionized, decorated
and advanced.  The reason that she had
no wrinkles on her handsome cheek was
because she went lightly through life.

"He thinks, my dearest girl, that you
are like all your countrywomen: a little
eccentric and that you have a strong mind.
He thinks you one of the most tender-hearted
and benevolent of girls."

"
Ma tante, ma tante!
"

"He thinks you are making a little
mission into Algiers among the sick and
the wounded.  He thinks you are going
to sing in the hospitals."

"But," exclaimed the girl, "he must
think me mad."

"Young men don't care how mildly
mad a beautiful young woman is, my dear Julia."

"But, he will find out ... he will know."

"No," said the marquise, "that he will
not.  I have attended to that.  He will not
leave his boat during the excursion, Julia.
He remains, and we go on shore with our people."

"How splendid!" sighed Julia Redmond, relieved.

"I'm glad you think so," said her aunt
rather shortly.  "Now I have a favor to
ask of you, my child."

Julia trembled.

"
Ma tante?
"

"While we are on board the yacht you
will treat Robert charmingly."

"I am always polite to him, am I not?"

"You are like an irritated sphinx to
him, my dear.  You must be different."

"I thought," said the girl in a subdued
voice, "that it would be like this.  Oh,
I wish I had sailed on any vessel, even a
cargo vessel."

Looking at her gently, her aunt said:
"Don't be ridiculous.  I only wish to
protect you, my child.  I think I have proved
my friendship.  Remember, before the
world you are nothing to Charles de
Sabron.  A woman's heart, my dear, has
delusions as well as passions."

The girl crimsoned and bowed her
charming head.  "You are not called upon
to tell Robert de Tremont that you are in
love with a man who has not asked you
to marry him, but you are his guest, and
all I ask of you is that you make the
voyage as agreeable to him as you can,
my dear."

Tremont was coming toward them.
Julia raised her head and murmured:

"I thank you for everything.  I shall
do what I can."  And to herself she said:
"That is, as far as my honor will let me."

CHAPTER XVI

THE DUKE IN DOUBT

The short journey to Africa—over
a calm and perfect sea, whose
waters were voices at her port to solace
her, and where the stars alone glowed
down like friends upon her and seemed
to understand—was a torture to Julia
Redmond.  To herself she called her aunt
cruel, over and over again, and felt a
prisoner, a caged creature.

Tremont found her charming, though
in this role of Florence Nightingale, she
puzzled and perplexed him.  She was
nevertheless adorable.  The young man
had the good sense to make a discreet
courtship and understood she would not
be easily won.  Until they reached
Algiers, indeed, until the night before they
disembarked, he had not said one word
to her which might not have been shared
by her aunt.  In accordance with the
French custom, they never were alone.
The marquise shut her eyes and napped
considerably and gave them every opportunity
she could, but she was always present.

The Duc de Tremont had been often in
love during his short life.  He was a
Latin and thought that women are made
to be loved.  It was part of his education
to think this and to tell them this, and he
also believed it a proof of his good taste
to tell them this as soon as possible.

He was a thoroughly fine fellow.  Some
of his forefathers had fought and fallen
in Agincourt.  They had been dukes ever
since.  There was something distinctly
noble in the blond young man, and Julia
discovered it.  Possibly she had felt it
from the first.  Some women are keen to
feel.  Perhaps if she had
not
felt it she
might even have hesitated to go to
Algiers as his guest.

From the moment that the old duchess
had said to Robert de Tremont:

"Julia Redmond is a great catch, my
dear boy.  I should like to have you marry
her," her son answered:

"
Bien, ma mÃ¨re
," with cheerful
acquiescence, and immediately considered it
and went to Tarascon, to the ChÃ¢teau
d'Esclignac.  When his mother had
suggested the visit, he told her that he
intended making up a party for the Mediterranean.

"Why don't you take your godmother
and the American girl?  Miss Redmond
has an income of nearly a million francs
and they say she is well-bred."

"Very good,
ma mÃ¨re
."

When he saw Miss Redmond he found
her lovely; not so lovely as the Comtesse
de la Maine, whose invitation to dinner
he had refused on the day his mother
suggested the ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac.  The
comtesse was a widow.  It is not very,
very
comme il faut
to marry a widow, in
the Faubourg St.-Germain.  Miss
Redmond's beauty was different.  She was
self-absorbed and cold.  He did not
understand her at all, but that was the
American of her.

One of his friends had married an
American girl and found out afterward
that she chewed gum before breakfast.

Pauvre
Raymond!  Miss Redmond did
not suggest such possibilities.  Still she
was very different to a French
jeune fille
.

With his godmother he was entirely at
ease.  Ever since she had paid his trifling
debts when he was a young man, he had
adored her.  Tremont, always discreet
and almost in love with his godmother,
kept her in a state of great good humor
always, and when she had suggested to
him this little party he had been delighted.
In speaking over the telephone the Marquise
d'Esclignac had said very firmly:

"My dear Robert, you understand that
this excursion engages you to nothing."

"Oh, of course,
marraine
."

"We both need a change, and between
ourselves, Julia has a little mission on foot."

Tremont would be delighted to help
Miss Redmond carry it out.  Whom else
should he ask?

"By all means, any one you like," said
his godmother diplomatically.  "We want
to sail the day after to-morrow."  She
felt safe, knowing that no worldly people
would accept an invitation on twenty-four
hours' notice.

"So," the Duc de Tremont reflected,
as he hung up the receiver, "Miss
Redmond has a scheme, a mission!  Young
girls do not have schemes and missions
in good French society."

"Mademoiselle," he said to her, as they
walked up and down on the deck in the
pale sunset, in front of the chair of the
Marquise d'Esclignac, "I never saw an
ornament more becoming to a woman than
the one you wear."

"The ornament, Monsieur?"

"On your sleeve.  It is so beautiful.  A
string of pearls would not be more beautiful,
although your pearls are lovely, too.
Are all American girls Red Cross members?"

"But of course not, Monsieur.  Are all
girls anywhere one thing?"

"Yes," said the Duc de Tremont, "they
are all charming, but there are gradations."

"Do you think that we shall reach
Algiers to-morrow, Monsieur?"

"I hope not, Mademoiselle."

Miss Redmond turned her fine eyes on him.

"
You hope not?
"

"I should like this voyage to last forever,
Mademoiselle."

"How ridiculous!"

Her look was so frank that he laughed
in spite of himself, and instead of
following up the politeness, he asked:

"Why do you think of Algiers as a field
for nursing the sick, Mademoiselle?"

"There has been quite a deputation of
the Red Cross women lately going from
Paris to the East."

"But," said the young man, "there are
poor in Tarascon, and sick, too.  There is
a great deal of poverty in Nice, and Paris
is the nearest of all."

"The American girls are very imaginative,"
said Julia Redmond.  "We must
have some romance in all we do."

"I find the American girls very charming,"
said Tremont.

"Do you know many, Monsieur?"

"Only one," he said serenely.

Miss Redmond changed the subject
quickly and cleverly, and before he knew
it, Tremont was telling her stories about
his own military service, which had been
made in Africa.  He talked well and
entertained them both, and Julia Redmond
listened when he told her of the desert, of
its charm and its desolation, and of its
dangers.  An hour passed.  The Marquise
d'Esclignac took an ante-prandial stroll,
Mimi mincing at her heels.

"
Ce pauvre
Sabron!" said Tremont.
"He has disappeared off the face of the
earth.  What a horrible thing it was,
Mademoiselle!  I knew him in Paris; I
remember meeting him again the night
before he left the Midi.  He was a fine
fellow with a career before him, his
friends say."

"What do you think has become of
Monsieur de Sabron?"

Miss Redmond, so far, had only been
able to ask this question of her aunt and
of the stars.  None of them had been able
to tell her.  Tremont shrugged his
shoulders thoughtfully.

"He may have dragged himself away
to die in some ambush that they have not
discovered, or likely he has been taken
captive,
le pauvre diable
!"

"France will do all it can, Monsieur..."

"They will do all they can, which is
to wait.  An extraordinary measure, if
taken just now, would probably result in
Sabron being put to death by his captors.
He may be found to-morrow—he may
never be found."

A slight murmur from the young girl
beside him made Tremont look at her.  He
saw that her hands were clasped and that
her face was quite white, her eyes staring
fixedly before her, out toward Africa.
Tremont said:

"You are compassion itself, Mademoiselle;
you have a tender heart.  No wonder
you wear the Red Cross.  I am a soldier,
Mademoiselle.  I thank you for all
soldiers.  I thank you for Sabron
... but, we must not talk of such things."

He thought her very charming, both
romantic and idealistic.  She would make
a delightful friend.  Would she not be
too intense for a wife?  However, many
women of fashion joined the Red Cross.
Tremont was a commonplace man, conventional
in his heart and in his tastes.

"My children," said the marquise,
coming up to them with Mimi in her arms,
"you are as serious as though we were on
a boat bound for the North Pole and
expected to live on tinned things and salt
fish.  Aren't you hungry, Julia?  Robert,
take Mimi to my maid, will you?  Julia,"
said her aunt as Tremont went away with
the little dog, "you look dramatic, my
dear, you're pale as death in spite of this
divine air and this enchanting sea."  She
linked her arm through her niece's.  "Take
a brisk walk with me for five minutes and
whip up your blood.  I believe you were
on the point of making Tremont some
unwise confession."

"I assure you no,
ma tante
."

"Isn't Bob a darling, Julia?"

"Awfully," returned her niece absent-mindedly.

"He's the most eligible young man in
Paris, Julia, and the most difficult to please."

"
Ma tante
," said the girl in a low tone,
"he tells me that France at present can do
practically nothing about finding
Monsieur de Sabron.  Fancy a great army and
a great nation helpless for the rescue
of a single soldier, and his life at stake!"

"Julia," said the marquise, taking the
trembling hand in her own, "you will
make yourself ill, my darling, and you will
be no use to any one, you know."

"You're right," returned the girl, "I
will be silent and I will only pray."

She turned from her aunt to stand for
a few moments quiet, looking out at the
sea, at the blue water through which the
boat cut and flew.  Along the horizon was
a mist, rosy and translucent, and out of it
white Algiers would shine before many
hours.

When Tremont, at luncheon a little
later, looked at his guests, he saw a new
Julia.  She had left her coat with the
Red Cross in her cabin with her hat.  In
her pretty blouse, her pearls around her
neck, the soft flush on her cheeks, she was
apparently only a light-hearted woman of
the world.  She teased her aunt gently,
she laughed very deliciously and lightly
flirted with the Duc de Tremont, who
opened a bottle of champagne.  The
Marquise d'Esclignac beamed upon her niece.
Tremont found her more puzzling than
ever.  "She suggests the chameleon," he
thought, "she has moods.  Before, she
was a tragic muse; at luncheon she is an
adorable sybarite."

CHAPTER XVII

OUT OF THE DESERT

From a dreamy little villa, whose
walls were streaming with bougainvillea,
Miss Redmond looked over Algiers,
over the tumult and hum of it, to
the sea.  Tremont, by her side, looked at
her.  From head to foot the girl was in
white.  On one side the bougainvillea laid
its scarlet flowers against the stainless
linen of her dress, and on her other arm
was the Red Cross.

The American girl and the Frenchman
had become the best of friends.  She
considered him a sincere companion and an
unconscious confederate.  He had not yet
decided what he thought of her, or how.
His promise to remain on the yacht had
been broken and he paid his godmother
and Miss Redmond constant visits at their
villa, which the marquise rented for the
season.

There were times when Tremont
thought Miss Redmond's exile a fanatical
one, but he always found her fascinating
and a lovely woman, and he wondered
what it was that kept him from laying his
title and his fortune at her feet.  It had
been understood between the godmother
and himself that he was to court Miss
Redmond
Ã  l'americaine
.

"She has been brought up in such a
shocking fashion, Robert, that nothing
but American love-making will appeal to
her.  You will have to make love to her,
Robert.  Can you do it?"

"But,
marraine
, I might as well make
love to a sister of charity."

"There was
la Belle Heloise
, and no
woman is immune."

"I think she is engaged to some American
cowboy who will come and claim her,

marraine
."

His godmother was offended.

"Rubbish!" she said.  "She is engaged
to no one, Bob.  She is an idealist, a
Rosalind; but that will not prevent her
from making an excellent wife."

"She is certainly very beautiful," said
the Duc de Tremont, and he told Julia so.

"You are very beautiful," said the Duc
de Tremont to Miss Redmond, as she
leaned on the balcony of the villa.  The
bougainvillea leaned against her breast.
"When you stood in the hospital under the
window and sang to the poor devils, you
looked like an angel."

"Poor things!" said Julia Redmond.
"Do you think that they liked it?"

"Liked it!" exclaimed the young man
enthusiastically, "couldn't you see by their
faces?  One poor devil said to me: 'One
can die better now, Monsieur.'  There
was no hope for him, it seems."

Tremont and the Marquise d'Esclignac
had docilely gone with Julia Redmond
every day at a certain hour to the
different hospitals, where Julia, after
rendering some slight services to the
nurses—for she was not needed—sang for the
sick, standing in the outer hallway of the
building open on every side.  She knew
that Sabron was not among these sick.
Where he was or what sounds his ears
might hear, she could not know; but she
sang for him, and the fact put a sweetness
in her voice that touched the ears of the
suffering and uplifted those who were not
too far down to be uplifted, and as for
the dying, it helped them, as the soldier
said, to die.

She had done this for several days, but
now she was restless.  Sabron was not in
Algiers.  No news had been brought of
him.  His regiment had been ordered out
farther into the desert that seemed to
stretch away into infinity, and the vast
cruel sands knew, and the stars knew
where Sabron had fallen and what was
his history, and they kept the secret.

The marquise made herself as much at
home as possible in Algiers, put up with
the inefficiency of native servants, and
her duty was done.  Her first romantic
Ã©lan was over.  Sabron had recalled to
her the idyl of a love-affair of a quarter
of a century before, but she had been for
too long the Marquise d'Esclignac to go
back to an ideal.  She pined to have her
niece a duchess, and never spoke the
unfortunate Sabron's name.

They were surrounded by fashionable
life.  As soon as their arrival had been
made known there had been a flutter of
cards and a passing of carriages and
automobiles, and this worldly life added to
the unhappiness and restlessness of Julia,
Among the guests had been one woman
whom she found sympathetic; the
woman's eyes had drawn Julia to her.  It
was the Comtesse de la Maine, a widow,
young as herself and, as Julia said, vastly
better-looking.  Turning to Tremont on
the balcony, when he told her she was
beautiful, she said:

"Madame de la Maine is my ideal of loveliness."

The young man wrinkled his fair brow.

"Do you think so, Mademoiselle?  Why?"

"She has character as well as perfect
lines.  Her eyes look as though they could
weep and laugh.  Her mouth looks as
though it could say adorable things."

Tremont laughed softly and said:

"Go on, you amuse me."

"And her hands look as though they
could caress and comfort.  I like her
awfully.  I wish she were my friend."

Tremont said nothing, and she glanced
at him suddenly.

"She says such lovely things about you, Monsieur."

"Really!  She is too indulgent."

"Don't be worldly," said Miss Redmond
gravely, "be human.  I like you
best so.  Don't you agree with me?"

"Madame de la Maine is a very charming
woman," said the young man, and the
girl saw a change come over his features.

At this moment, as they stood so
together, Tremont pulling his mustache
and looking out through the bougainvillea
vines, a dark figure made its way through
the garden to the villa, came and took its
position under the balcony where the duke
and Miss Redmond leaned.  It was a native,
a man in filthy rags.  He turned his
face to Tremont and bowed low to the lady.

"Excellency," he said in broken French,
"my name is Hammet Abou.  I was the

ordonnance
of Monsieur le Capitaine de Sabron."

"What!" exclaimed Tremont, "what
did you say?"

"Ask him to come up here," said Julia
Redmond, "or, no—let us go down to the garden."

"It is damp," said Tremont, "let me
get you a shawl."

"No, no, I need nothing."

She had hurried before him down the
little stairs leading into the garden from
the balcony, and she had begun to speak
to the native before Tremont appeared.
In this recital he addressed his words to
Julia alone.

"I am a very poor man, Excellency," he
said in a mellifluous tone, "and very sick."

"Have you any money, Monsieur?"

"Pray do not suggest it," said the duke
sharply.  "Let him tell what he will; we
will pay him later."

"I have been very sick," said the man.
"I have left the army.  I do not like the
French army," said the native simply.

"You are very frank," said Tremont
brutally.  "Why do you come here at any rate?"

"Hush," said Julia Redmond imploringly.
"Do not anger him, Monsieur, he
may have news."  She asked: "Have you
news?" and there was a note in her voice
that made Tremont glance at her.

"I have seen the excellency and her
grandmother," said the native, "many
times going into the garrison."

"What news have you of Captain de
Sabron?" asked the girl directly.  Without
replying, the man said in a melancholy
voice:

"I was his
ordonnance
, I saw him fall
in the battle of Dirbal.  I saw him shot
in the side.  I was shot, too.  See?"

He started to pull away his rags.  Tremont
clutched him.

"You beast," he muttered, and pushed
him back.  "If you have anything to say,
say it."

Looking at Julia Redmond's colorless
face, the native asked meaningly:

"Does the excellency wish any news?"

"Yes," said Tremont, shaking him.
"And if you do not give it, it will be the
worse for you."

"Monsieur le Capitaine fell, and I fell,
too; I saw no more."

Tremont said:

"You see the fellow is half lunatic and
probably knows nothing about Sabron.  I
shall put him out of the garden."

But Miss Redmond paid no attention
to her companion.  She controlled her
voice and asked the man:

"Was the Capitaine de Sabron alone?"

"Except," said the native steadily, with
a glance of disgust at the duke, "except
for his little dog."

"Ah!" exclaimed Julia Redmond, with
a catch in her voice, "do you hear that?
He must have been his servant.  What
was the dog's name?"

"My name," said the native, "is Hammet Abou."

To her at this moment Hammet Abou
was the most important person in North
Africa.

"What was the little dog's name, Hammet Abou?"

The man raised his eyes and looked at
the white woman with admiration.

"PitchounÃ©," he said, and saw the effect.

Tremont saw the effect upon her, too.

"I have a wife and ten children," said
the man, "and I live far away."

"Heavens!  I haven't my purse," said
Julia Redmond.  "Will you not give him
something, Monsieur?"

"Wait," said Tremont, "wait.  What
else do you know?  If your information is
worth anything to us we will pay you,
don't be afraid."

"Perhaps the excellency's grandmother
would like to hear, too," said the man
naively.

Julia Redmond smiled: the youthful
Marquise d'Esclignac!

Once more Tremont seized the man by
the arm and shook him a little.

"If you don't tell what you have to say
and be quick about it, my dear fellow, I
shall hand you over to the police."

"What for?" said the man, "what have I done?"

"Well, what have you got to tell, and
how much do you want for it?"

"I want one hundred francs for this,"
and he pulled out from his dirty rags a
little packet and held it up cautiously.

It looked like a package of letters and
a man's pocketbook.

"You take it," said the Duc de Tremont
to Julia Redmond, "you take it,
Mademoiselle."  She did so without hesitation;
it was evidently Sabron's pocketbook,
a leather one with his initials upon
it, together with a little package of letters.
On the top she saw her letter to him.  Her
hand trembled so that she could scarcely
hold the package.  It seemed to be all that
was left to her.  She heard Tremont ask:

"Where did you get this, you miserable dog?"

"After the battle," said the man coolly,
with evident truthfulness, "I was very
sick.  We were in camp several days at
——.  Then I got better and went
along the dried river bank to look for
Monsieur le Capitaine, and I found this
in the sands."

"Do you believe him?" asked Julia Redmond.

"Hum," said Tremont.  He did not
wish to tell her he thought the man
capable of robbing the dead body of his
master.  He asked the native: "Have you no
other news?"

The man was silent.  He clutched the
rags at his breast and looked at Julia
Redmond.

"Please give him some money, Monsieur."

"The dog!"  Tremont shook him again.
"Not yet."  And he said to the man: "If
this is all you have to tell we will give you
one hundred francs for this parcel.  You
can go and don't return here again."

"But it is not all," said the native quietly,
looking at Julia.

Her heart began to beat like mad and
she looked at the man.  His keen dark
eyes seemed to pierce her.

"Monsieur," said the American girl
boldly, "would you leave me a moment
with him?  I think he wants to speak
with me alone."

But the Duc de Tremont exclaimed in surprise:

"To speak with you alone, Mademoiselle!
Why should he?  Such a thing is not possible!"

"Don't go far," she begged, "but leave
us a moment, I pray."

When Tremont, with great hesitation,
took a few steps away from them and she
stood face to face with the creature who
had been with Sabron and seen him fall,
she said earnestly:

"Now speak without reserve.  Tell me everything."

The face of the man was transformed.
He became human, devoted, ardent.

"Excellency," he said swiftly in his
halting French, "I loved Monsieur le
Capitaine.  He was so kind and such a
brave soldier.  I want to go to find
Monsieur le Capitaine, but I am ill and too
weak to walk.  I believe I know where he
is hid—I want to go."

The girl breathed:

"Oh, can it be possible that what you
say is true, Hammet Abou?  Would you
really go if you could?"

The man made, with a graceful gesture
of his hand, a map in the air.

"It was like this," he said; "I think he
fell into the bed of an old river.  I think
he drew himself up the bank.  I followed
the track of his blood.  I was too
weak to go any farther, Excellency."

"And how could you go now?" she asked.

"By caravan, like a merchant, secretly.
I would find him."

Julia Redmond put out a slim hand,
white as a gardenia.  The native lifted it
and touched his forehead with it.

"Hammet Abou," she said, "go away
for to-night and come to-morrow—we
will see you."  And without waiting to
speak again to Monsieur de Tremont, the
native slid away out of the garden like a
shadow, as though his limbs were not
weak with disease and his breast
shattered by shot.

When Monsieur de Tremont had
walked once around the garden, keeping
his eyes nevertheless on the group, he
came back toward Julia Redmond, but
not quickly enough, for she ran up the
stairs and into the house with Sabron's
packet in her hand.

CHAPTER XVIII

TWO LOVELY WOMEN

There was music at the Villa des
Bougainvilleas.  Miss Redmond
sang; not
Good-night, God Keep You
Safe
, but other things.  Ever since her
talk with Hammet Abou she had been,
if not gay, in good spirits, more like her
old self, and the Marquise d'Esclignac
began to think that the image of Charles
de Sabron had not been cut too deeply
upon her mind.  The marquise, from the
lounge in the shadow of the room,
enjoyed the picture (Sabron would not have
added it to his collection) of her niece at
the piano and the Duc de Tremont by her
side.  The Comtesse de la Maine sat in a
little shadow of her own, musing and
enjoying the picture of the Duc de Tremont
and Miss Redmond very indifferently.
She did not sing; she had no parlor
accomplishments.  She was poor, a widow,
and had a child.  She was not a brilliant
match.

From where he stood, Tremont could
see the Comtesse de la Maine in her little
shadow, the oriental decorations a
background to her slight Parisian figure, and
a little out of the shadow, the bright
aigret in her hair danced, shaking its
sparkles of fire.  She looked infinitely sad
and infinitely appealing.  One bare arm
was along the back of her lounge.  She
leaned her head upon her hand.

After a few moments the Duc de Tremont
quietly left the piano and Miss Redmond,
and went and sat down beside the
Comtesse de la Maine, who, in order to
make a place for him, moved out of the
shadow.

Julia, one after another, played songs
she loved, keeping her fingers resolutely
from the notes that wanted to run into a
single song, the music, the song that
linked her to the man whose life had
become a mystery.  She glanced at the Duc
de Tremont and the Comtesse de la
Maine.  She glanced at her aunt, patting
Mimi, who, freshly washed, adorned by
pale blue ribbon, looked disdainful and
princely, and with passion and feeling
she began to sing the song that seemed
to reach beyond the tawdry room of the
villa in Algiers, and to go into the desert,
trying in sweet intensity to speak and to
comfort, and as she sat so singing to one
man, Sabron would have adored adding
that picture to his collection.

The servant came up to the marquise
and gave her a message.  The lady rose,
beckoned Tremont to follow her, and
went out on the veranda, followed by
Mimi.  Julia stopped playing and went
over to the Comtesse de la Maine.

"Where have my aunt and Monsieur de
Tremont gone, Madame?"

"To see some one who has come to
suggest a camel excursion, I believe."

"He chooses a curious hour."

"Everything is curious in the East,
Mademoiselle," returned the comtesse.  "I
feel as though my own life were turned
upside down."

"We are not far enough in the East for
that," smiled Julia Redmond.  She
regarded the comtesse with her frank girlish
scrutiny.  There was in it a fine
truthfulness and utter disregard of all the
barriers that long epochs of etiquette put
between souls.

Julia Redmond knew nothing of
French society and of the deference due
to the arts of the old world.  She knew,
perhaps, very little of anything.  She was
young and unschooled.  She knew, as
some women know, how to feel, and how
to be, and how to love.  She was as
honest as her ancestors, among whose
traditions is the story that one of them could
never tell a lie.

Julia Redmond sat beside the Comtesse
de la Maine, whose elegance she admired
enormously, and taking one of the lady's
hands, with a frank liking she asked in
her rich young voice:

"Why do you tolerate me, Madame?"

"
Ma chÃ¨re enfant
," exclaimed the
comtesse.  "Why, you are adorable."

"It is terribly good of you to say so,"
murmured Julia Redmond.  "It shows
how generous you are."

"But you attribute qualities to me I do
not deserve, Mademoiselle."

"You deserve them and much more,
Madame.  I loved you the first day I saw
you; no one could help loving you."

Julia Redmond was irresistible.  The
Comtesse de la Maine had remarked her
caprices, her moods, her sadness.  She
had seen that the good spirits were false
and, as keen women do, she had attributed
it to a love-affair with the Duc de
Tremont.  The girl's frankness was contagious.
The Comtesse de la Maine murmured:

"I think the same of you,
ma chÃ¨re,
vous Ãªtes charmante
."

Comtesse de la Main and Julia Redmond

Julia Redmond shook her head.  She
did not want compliments.  The eyes of
the two women met and read each other.

"Couldn't you be frank with me,
Madame?  It is so easy to be frank."

It was, indeed, impossible for Julia
Redmond to be anything else.  The comtesse,
who was only a trifle older than the
young girl, felt like her mother just then.
She laughed.

"But be frank—about what?"

"You see," said Julia Redmond swiftly,
"I care absolutely nothing for the Duc
de Tremont, nothing."

"You don't
love
him?" returned Madame
de la Maine, with deep accentuation.
"Is it possible?"

The girl smiled.

"Yes, quite possible.  I think he is a
perfect dear.  He is a splendid friend
and I am devoted to him, but I don't love
him at all, not at all."

"Ah!" breathed Madame de la Maine,
and she looked at the American girl
guardedly.

For a moment it was like a passage of
arms between a frank young Indian
chief and a Jesuit.  Julia, as it were,
shook her feathers and her beads.

"And I don't care in the
least
about
being a duchess!  My father made his
money in oil.  I am not an aristocrat like
my aunt," she said.

"Then," said the Comtesse de la Maine,
forgetting that she was a Jesuit, "you will
marry Robert de Tremont simply to
please your aunt?"

"But nothing on earth would induce
me to marry him!" cried Julia Redmond.
"That's what I'm telling you, Madame.  I
don't love him!"

The Comtesse de la Maine looked at
her companion and bit her lip.  She
blushed more warmly than is permitted
in the Faubourg St.-Germain, but she was
young and the western influence is pernicious.

"I saw at once that you loved him,"
said Julia Redmond frankly.  "That's
why I speak as I do."

The Comtesse de la Maine drew back
and exclaimed.

"Oh," said Julia Redmond, "don't
deny it.  I shan't like you half so well if
you do.  There is no shame in being in
love, is there?—especially when the man
you love, loves you."

The Comtesse de la Maine broke down,
or, rather, she rose high.  She rose above
all the smallness of convention and the
rules of her French formal education.

"You are wonderful," she said, laughing
softly, her eyes full of tears.  "Will
you tell me what makes you think that he
is fond of me?"

"But you know it so well," said Julia.
"Hasn't he cared for you for a long time?"

Madame de la Maine wondered just
how much Julia Redmond had heard, and
as there was no way of finding out, she
said graciously:

"He has seemed to love me very dearly
for many years; but I am poor; I have a
child.  He is ambitious and he is the Duc
de Tremont."

"Nonsense," said Julia.  "He loves
you.  That's all that counts.  You will be
awfully happy.  You will marry the Duc
de Tremont, won't you?  There's a dear."

"Happy," murmured the other woman,
"happy, my dear friend, I never dreamed
of such a thing!"

"Dream of it now," said Julia Redmond
swiftly, "for it will come true."

CHAPTER XIX

THE MAN IN RAGS

The Marquise d'Esclignac, under
the stars, interviewed the native
soldier, the beggar, the man in rags, at the
foot of the veranda.  There was a moon
as well as stars, and the man was
distinctly visible in all his squalor.

"What on earth is he talking about,
Robert?"

"About Sabron,
marraine
," said her
godson laconically.

The Marquise d'Esclignac raised her
lorgnon and said:

"Speak, man!  What do you know
about Monsieur de Sabron?  See, he is
covered with dirt—has leprosy,
probably."  But she did not withdraw.  She
was a great lady and stood her ground.
She did not know what the word
"squeamish" meant.

Listening to the man's jargon and
putting many things together, Tremont at
last turned to the Marquise d'Esclignac
who was sternly fixing the beggar with
her haughty condescension:

"
Marraine
, he says that Sabron is alive,
in the hands of natives in a certain district
where there is no travel, in the heart of
the seditious tribes.  He says that he has
friends in a caravan of merchants who
once a year pass the spot where this native
village is."

"The man's a lunatic," said the Marquise
d'Esclignac calmly.  "Get Abimelec
and put him out of the garden, Robert.
You must not let Julia hear of this."

"
Marraine
," said Tremont quietly,
"Mademoiselle Redmond has already
seen this man.  He has come to see her
to-night."

"How perfectly horrible!" said the
Marquise d'Esclignac.  Then she asked
rather weakly of Tremont: "Don't you
think so?"

"Well, I think," said Tremont, "that
the only interesting thing is the truth
there may be in what this man says.  If
Sabron is a captive, and he knows anything
about it, we must use his information
for all it is worth."

"Of course," said the Marquise d'Esclignac,
"of course.  The war department
must be informed at once.  Why hasn't
he gone there?"

"He has explained," said Tremont,
"that the only way Sabron can be saved
is that he shall be found by outsiders.  One
hint to his captors would end his life."

"Oh!" said the Marquise d'Esclignac.
"I don't know what to do, Bob!  What
part can we take in this?"

Tremont pulled his mustache.  Mimi
had circled round the beggar, snuffing at
his slippers and his robe.  The man made
no objection to the little creature, to the
fluffy ball surrounded by a huge bow, and
Mimi sat peacefully down in the moonlight,
at the beggar's feet.

"Mimi seems to like him," said the
Marquise d'Esclignac helplessly, "she is
very particular."

"She finds that he has a serious and
convincing manner," said Tremont.

Now the man, who had been a silent
listener to the conversation, said in fairly
comprehensible English to the Marquise
d'Esclignac:

"If the beautiful grandmother could
have seen the Capitaine de Sabron on the
night before the battle—"

"Grandmother, indeed!" exclaimed the
marquise indignantly.  "Come, Mimi!
Robert, finish with this creature and get
what satisfaction you can from him.  I
believe him to be an impostor; at any rate,
he does not expect me to mount a camel
or to lead a caravan to the rescue."

Tremont put Mimi in her arms; she
folded her lorgnon and sailed majestically
away, like a highly decorated pinnace
with silk sails, and Tremont, in the
moonlight, continued to talk with the sincere
and convincing Hammet Abou.

CHAPTER XX

JULIA DECIDES

Now the young girl had his letters
and her own to read.  They were
sweet and sad companions and she laid
them side by side.  She did not weep,
because she was not of the weeping type;
she had hope.

Her spirits remained singularly even.
Madame de la Maine had given her a
great deal to live on.

"Julia, what have you done to Robert?"

"Nothing,
ma tante
"

"He has quite changed.  This excursion
to Africa has entirely altered him.
He is naturally so gay," said the
Marquise d'Esclignac.  "Have you refused
him, Julia?"

"
Ma tante
, he has not asked me to be
the Duchess de Tremont."

Her aunt's voice was earnest.

"Julia, do you wish to spoil your life
and your chances of happiness?  Do you
wish to mourn for a dead soldier who has
never been more than an acquaintance?
I won't even say a
friend
."

What she said sounded logical.

"
Ma tante
, I do not think of Monsieur
de Sabron as dead, you know."

"Well, in the event that he may be, my
dear Julia."

"Sometimes," said the girl, drawing
near to her aunt and taking the older
lady's hand quietly and looking in her
eyes, "sometimes,
ma tante
, you are
cruel."

The marquise kissed her and sighed:

"Robert's mother will be so unhappy!"

"But she has never seen me,
ma tante
."

"She trusts my taste, Julia."

"There should be more than 'taste' in
a matter of husband and wife,
ma tante
."

After a moment, in which the Marquise
d'Esclignac gazed at the bougainvillea
and wondered how any one could
admire its crude and vulgar color, Miss
Redmond asked:

"Did you ever think that the Duc de
Tremont was in love?"

Turning shortly about to her niece, her
aunt stared at her.

"In love, my dear!"

"With Madame de la Maine."

The arrival of Madame de la Maine
had been a bitter blow to the Marquise
d'Esclignac.  The young woman was,
however, much loved in Paris and quite
in the eye of the world.  There was no
possible reason why the Marquise
d'Esclignac should avoid her.

"You have been hearing gossip, Julia."

"I have been watching a lovely
woman," said the girl simply, "and a man.
That's all.  You wouldn't want me to
marry a man who loves another woman,

ma tante
, when the woman loves him and
when I love another man?"

She laughed and kissed her aunt's cheek.

"Let us think of the soldier," she murmured,
"let us think just of
him, ma tante
,
will you not?"

The Marquise d'Esclignac struck her colors.

In the hallway of the villa, in a snowy
gibbeh, (and his clean-washed appearance
was much in his favor) Hammet Abou
waited to talk with the "grandmother"
and the excellency.

He pressed both his hands to his forehead
and his breast as the ladies entered
the vestibule.  There was a stagnant odor
of myrrh and sandalwood in the air.  The
marble vestibule was cool and dark, the
walls hung with high-colored stuffs, the
windows drawn to keep out the heat.

The Duc de Tremont and Madame de
la Maine came out of the salon together.
Tremont nodded to the Arab.

"I hope you are a little less—" and he
touched his forehead smiling, "to-day, my
friend."

"I am as God made me, Monsieur."

"What have you got to-day?" asked
Julia Redmond anxiously, fixing her
eager eyes upon Hammet.

It seemed terrible to her that this man
should stand there with a vital secret and
that they should not all be at his feet.  He
glanced boldly around at them.

"There are no soldiers here?"

"No, no, you may speak freely."

The man went forward to Tremont
and put a paper in his hands, unfolding
it like a chart.

"This is what monsieur asked me for—a
plan of the battle-field.  This is the
battle-field, and this is the desert."

Tremont took the chart.  On the page
was simply a round circle, drawn in red
ink, with a few Arabian characters and
nothing else.  Hammet Abou traced the
circle with his fingers tipped with henna.

"That was the battle, Monsieur."

"But this is no chart, Hammet Abou."

The other continued, unmoved:

"And all the rest is a desert, like this."

Tremont, over the man's snowy turban,
glanced at the others and shrugged.
Every one but Julia Redmond thought he
was insane.  She came up to him where
he stood close to Tremont.  She said very
slowly in French, compelling the man's
dark eyes to meet hers:

"You don't wish to tell us, Hammet
Abou, anything more.  Am I not right?
You don't wish us to know the truth."

Now it was the American pitted against
the Oriental.  The Arab, with deference,
touched his forehead before her.

"If I made a true plan," he said coolly,
"your excellency could give it to-morrow
to the government."

"Just what should be done, Julia," said
the Marquise d'Esclignac, in English.
"This man should be arrested at once."

"
Ma tante
," pleaded Julia Redmond.

She felt as though a slender thread was
between her fingers, a thread which led
her to the door of a labyrinth and which
a rude touch might cause her to lose forever.

"If you had money would you start out
to find Monsieur de Sabron at once?"

"It would cost a great deal, Excellency."

"You shall have all the money you
need.  Do you think you would be able to
find your way?"

"Yes, Excellency."

The Duc de Tremont watched the
American girl.  She was bartering with
an Arabian for the salvation of a poor
officer.  What an enthusiast!  He had no
idea she had ever seen Sabron more than
once or twice in her life.  He came forward.

"Let me talk to this man," he said with
authority, and Julia Redmond did not
dispute him.

In a tone different from the light and
mocking one that he had hitherto used to
the Arab, Tremont began to ask a dozen
questions severely, and in his answers to
the young Frenchman, Hammet Abou
began to make a favorable impression on
every one save the Marquise d'Esclignac,
who did not understand him.  There was
a huge bamboo chair on a dais under a
Chinese pagoda, and the Marquise
d'Esclignac took the chair and sat upright as
on a throne.  Mimi, who had just been
fed, came in tinkling her little bells and
fawned at the sandals on Hammet Abou's
bare feet.  After talking with the native,
Tremont said to his friends:

"This man says that if he joins a Jewish
caravan, which leaves here to-morrow
at sundown, he will be taken with these
men and leave the city without suspicion,
but he must share the expenses of the
whole caravan.  The expedition will not
be without danger; it must be entered into
with great subtlety.  He is either," said
Tremont, "an impostor or a remarkable
man."

"He is an impostor, of course," murmured
the Marquise d'Esclignac.  "Come
here, Mimi."

Tremont went on:

"Further he will not disclose to us.  He
has evidently some carefully laid plan for
rescuing Sabron."

There was a pause.  Hammet Abou,
his hands folded peacefully across his
breast, waited.  Julia Redmond waited.
The Comtesse de la Maine, in her pretty
voice, asked quickly:

"But,
mes amis
, there is a man's life at
stake!  Why do we stand here talking in
the antechamber?  Evidently the war
office has done all it can for the Capitaine
de Sabron.  But they have not found
him.  Whether this fellow is crazy or
not, he has a wonderful hypothesis."

A brilliant look of gratitude crossed
Julia Redmond's face.  She glanced at the
Comtesse de la Maine.

"Ah, she's got the heart!" she said to
herself.  "I knew it."  She crossed the
hall to the Comtesse de la Maine and
slipped her arm in hers.

"Has Monsieur de Sabron no near family?"

"No," said the Marquise d'Esclignac
from her throne.  "He is one of those
unfamilied beings who, when they are once
taken into other hearts are all the dearer
because of their orphaned state."

Her tone was not unkind.  It was affectionate.

"Now, my good man," she said to
Hammet Abou, in a language totally
incomprehensible to him, "money is no
object in this question, but what will you do
with Monsieur de Sabron if you find him?
He may be an invalid, and the ransom
will be fabulous."

The Comtesse de la Maine felt the girl's
arm in hers tremble.  Hammet Abou
answered none of these questions, for he did
not understand them.  He said quietly to
Tremont:

"The caravan starts to-morrow at
sundown and there is much to do."

Tremont stood pulling his mustache.
He looked boyish and charming, withal
serious beyond his usual habit.  His eyes
wandered over to the corner where the
two women stood together.

"I intend to go with you, Hammet
Abou," said he slowly, "if it can be
arranged.  Otherwise this expedition does
not interest me."

Two women said:

"Oh, heavens!" at once.

Robert de Tremont heard the note of
anxiety in the younger voice alone.  He
glanced at the Comtesse de la Maine.

"You are quite right, Madame," he
said, "a man's life is at stake and we stand
chaffing here.  I know something of what
the desert is and what the natives are.
Sabron would be the first to go if it were
a question of a brother officer."

The Marquise d'Esclignac got down
from her throne, trembling.  Her eyes
were fixed upon her niece.

"Julia," she began, and stopped.

Madame de la Maine said nothing.

"Robert, you are my godson, and I forbid
it.  Your mother—"

"—is one of the bravest women I ever
knew," said her godson.  "My father was
a soldier."

Julia withdrew her arm from the Comtesse
de la Maine as though to leave her
free.

"Then you two girls," said the Marquise
d'Esclignac, thoroughly American
for a moment, "must forbid him to go."  She
fixed her eyes sternly upon her niece,
with a glance of entreaty and reproach.
Miss Redmond said in a firm voice:

"In Monsieur de Tremont's case I
should do exactly what he proposes."

"But he is risking his life," said the
Marquise d'Esclignac.  "He is not even
an intimate friend of Monsieur de Sabron!"

Tremont said, smiling:

"You tell us that he has no brother,

marraine
.
Eh bien
, I will pass as his
brother."

A thrill touched Julia Redmond's heart.
She almost loved him.  If, as her aunt had
said, Sabron had been out of the question...

"Madame de la Maine," said the
Marquise d'Esclignac, her hands shaking, "I
appeal to you to divert this headstrong
young man from his purpose."

The Comtesse de la Maine was the
palest of the three women.  She had been
quietly looking at Tremont and now a
smile crossed her lips that had tears back
of it—one of those beautiful smiles that
mean so much on a woman's face.  She
was the only one of the three who had not
yet spoken.  Tremont was waiting for
her.  Hammet Abou, with whom he had
been in earnest conversation, was answering
his further questions.  The Marquise
d'Esclignac shrugged, threw up her hands
as though she gave up all questions of
romance, rescue and disappointed love
and foolish girls, and walked out
thoroughly wretched, Mimi tinkling at her
heels.  The Comtesse de la Maine said to
Julia:

"
Ma chÃ¨re
, what were the words of the
English song you sang last night—the
song you told me was a sort of prayer.
Tell me the words slowly, will you?"

They walked out of the vestibule
together, leaving Hammet Abou and
Tremont alone.

CHAPTER XXI

MASTER AND FRIEND

PitchounÃ©, who might have been
considered as one of the infinitesimal
atoms in the economy of the universe, ran
over the sands away from his master.  He
was an infinitesimal dot on the desert's
face.  He was only a small Irish terrier
in the heart of the Sahara.  His little wiry
body and his color seemed to blend with
the dust.  His eyes were dimmed by
hunger and thirst and exhaustion, but there
was the blood of a fighter in him and he
was a thoroughbred.  Nevertheless, he
was running away.  It looked very much
like it.  There was no one to comment on
his treachery; had there been, PitchounÃ©
would not have run far.

It was not an ordinary sight to see on
the Sahara—a small Irish terrier going as
fast as he could.

PitchounÃ© ran with his nose to the
ground.  There were several trails for a
dog to follow on that apparently untrodden
page of desert history.  Which one
would he choose?  Without a scent a dog
does nothing.  His nostrils are his instinct.
His devotion, his faithfulness, his
intelligence, his heart—all come through
his nose.  A man's heart, they say, is in
his stomach—or in his pocket.  A dog's is
in his nostrils.  If PitchounÃ© had chosen
the wrong direction, this story would
never have been written.  Michette did not
give birth to the sixth puppy, in the
stables of the garrison, for nothing.  Nor
had Sabron saved him on the night of the
memorable dinner for nothing.

With his nose flat to the sands
PitchounÃ© smelt to east and to west,
to north and south, took a scent to
the east, decided on it—for what
reason will never be told—and followed it.
Fatigue and hunger were forgotten as
hour after hour PitchounÃ© ran across the
Sahara.  Mercifully, the sun had been
clouded by the precursor of a wind-storm.
The air was almost cool.  Mercifully, the
wind did not arise until the little terrier
had pursued his course to the end.

There are occasions when an animal's
intelligence surpasses the human.  When,
toward evening of the twelve hours that it
had taken him to reach a certain point, he
came to a settlement of mud huts on the
borders of an oasis, he was pretty nearly
at the end of his strength.  The oasis was
the only sign of life in five hundred miles.
There was very little left in his small
body.  He lay down, panting, but his
bright spirit was unwilling just then to
leave his form and hovered near him.  In
the religion of Tatman dogs alone have
souls.

PitchounÃ© panted and dragged himself
to a pool of water around which the green
palms grew, and he drank and drank.
Then the little desert wayfarer hid himself
in the bushes and slept till morning.
All night he was racked with convulsive
twitches, but he slept and in his dreams,
he killed a young chicken and ate it.  In
the morning he took a bath in the pool,
and the sun rose while he swam in the
water.

If Sabron or Miss Redmond could have
seen him he would have seemed the
epitome of heartless egoism.  He was the
epitome of wisdom.  Instinct and
wisdom sometimes go closely together.
Solomon was only instinctive when he asked
for wisdom.  The epicurean Lucullus,
when dying, asked for a certain Nile fish
cooked in wine.

PitchounÃ© shook out his short hairy
body and came out of the oasis pool into
the sunlight and trotted into the Arabian
village.

* * * * * * *

Fatou Anni parched corn in a brazier
before her house.  Her house was a mud
hut with yellow walls.  It had no roof and
was open to the sky.  Fatou Anni was
ninety years old, straight as a
lance—straight as one of the lances the men of
the village carried when they went to
dispute with white people.  These lances with
which the young men had fought,
had won them the last battle.  They had
been victorious on the field.

Fatou Anni was the grandmother of
many men.  She had been the mother of
many men.  Now she parched corn
tranquilly, prayerfully.

"Allah! that the corn should not burn;
Allah! that it should be sweet; Allah! that
her men should be always successful."

She was the fetish of the settlement.  In
a single blue garment, her black scrawny
breast uncovered, the thin veil that the
Fellaheen wear pushed back from her
face, her fine eyes were revealed and she
might have been a priestess as she bent
over her corn!

"Allah!  Allah Akbar!"

Rather than anything should happen to
Fatou Anni, the settlement would have
roasted its enemies alive, torn them in
shreds.  Some of them said that she was
two hundred years old.  There was a
charmed ring drawn around her house.
People supposed that if any creature
crossed it uninvited, it would fall dead.

The sun had risen for an hour and the
air was still cool.  Overhead, the sky,
unstained by a single cloud, was blue as a
turquoise floor, and against it, black and
portentous, flew the vultures.  Here and
there the sun-touched pools gave life and
reason to the oasis.

Fatou Anni parched her corn.  Her
barbaric chant was interrupted by a sharp
bark and a low pleading whine.

She had never heard sounds just like
that.  The dogs of the village were great
wolf-like creatures.  PitchounÃ©'s bark
was angelic compared with theirs.  He
crossed the charmed circle drawn around
her house, and did not fall dead, and stood
before her, whining.  Fatou Anni left her
corn, stood upright and looked at
PitchounÃ©.  To her the Irish terrier was an
apparition.  The fact that he had not
fallen dead proved that he was beloved of
Allah.  He was, perhaps, a genie, an afrit.

PitchounÃ© fawned at her feet.  She
murmured a line of the Koran.  It did not
seem to affect his demonstrative affection.
The woman bent down to him after
making a pass against the Evil Eye, and
touched him, and PitchounÃ© licked her
hand.

Fatou Anni screamed, dropped him,
went into the house and made her ablutions.
When she came out PitchounÃ© sat
patiently before the parched corn, and he
again came crawling to her.

The Arabian woman lived in the last
hut of the village.  She could satisfy her
curiosity without shocking her neighbors.
She bent down to scrutinize PitchounÃ©'s
collar.  There was a sacred medal on it
with sacred inscriptions which she could
not read.  But as soon as she had freed him
this time, PitchounÃ© tore himself away
from her, flew out of the sacred ring and
disappeared.  Then he ran back, barking
appealingly; he took the hem of her dress
in his mouth and pulled her.  He repeatedly
did this and the superstitious Arabian
believed herself to be called divinely.
She cautiously left the door-step, her veil
falling before her face, came out of the
sacred ring, followed to the edge of the
berry field.  From there PitchounÃ© sped
over the desert; then he stopped and
looked back at her.  Fatou Anni did not
follow, and he returned to renew his
entreaties.  When she tried to touch him he
escaped, keeping at a safe distance.  The
village began to stir.  Blue and yellow
garments fluttered in the streets.

"Allah Akbar," Fatou Anni murmured,
"these are days of victory, of recompense."

She gathered her robe around her and,
stately and impressively, started toward
the huts of her grandsons.  When she
returned, eight young warriors, fully armed,
accompanied her.  PitchounÃ© sat beside
the parched corn, watching the brazier and
her meal.  Fatou Anni pointed to the desert.

She said to the young men, "Go with
this genie.  There is something he wishes
to show us.  Allah is great.  Go."

* * * * * * *

When the Capitaine de Sabron opened
his eyes in consciousness, they encountered
a square of blazing blue heaven.  He
weakly put up his hand to shade his sight,
and a cotton awning, supported by four
bamboo poles, was swiftly raised over his
head.  He saw objects and took cognizance
of them.  On the floor in the low
doorway of a mud hut sat three little
naked children covered with flies
and dirt.  He was the guest of
Fatou Anni.  These were three of
her hundred great-great-grandchildren.
The babies were playing with a little
dog.  Sabron knew the dog but could
not articulate his name.  By his side sat
the woman to whom he owed his life.  Her
veil fell over her face.  She was braiding
straw.  He looked at her intelligently.  She
brought him a drink of cool water in an
earthen vessel, with the drops oozing from
its porous sides.  The hut reeked with
odors which met his nostrils at every
breath he drew.  He asked in Arabic:

"Where am I?"

"In the hut of victory," said Fatou Anni.

PitchounÃ© overheard the voice and
came to Sabron's side.  His master murmured:

"Where are we, my friend?"

The dog leaped on his bed and licked
his face.  Fatou Anni, with a whisk of
straw, swept the flies from him.  A great
weakness spread its wings above him and
he fell asleep.

Days are all alike to those who lie in
mortal sickness.  The hours are intensely
colorless and they slip and slip and slip
into painful wakefulness, into fever, into
drowsiness finally, and then into weakness.

The Capitaine de Sabron, although he
had no family to speak of, did possess,
unknown to the Marquise d'Esclignac, an
old aunt in the provinces, and a handful
of heartless cousins who were indifferent
to him.  Nevertheless he clung to
life and in the hut of Fatou Anni fought
for existence.  Every time that he was
conscious he struggled anew to hold to the
thread of life.  Whenever he grasped the
thread he vanquished, and whenever he
lost it, he went down, down.

Fatou Anni cherished him.  He was a
soldier who had fallen in the battle against
her sons and grandsons.  He was a man
and a strong one, and she despised
women.  He was her prey and he was her
reward and she cared for him; as she did
so, she became maternal.

His eyes which, when he was conscious,
thanked her; his thin hands that moved on
the rough blue robe thrown over him, the
devotion of the dog—found a responsive
chord in the great-grandmother's heart.
Once he smiled at one of the naked,
big-bellied great-great-grandchildren.  Beni
Hassan, three years old, came up to
Sabron with his finger in his mouth and
chattered like a bird.  This proved to Fatou
Anni that Sabron had not the Evil Eye.
No one but the children were admitted
to the hut, but the sun and the flies and the
cries of the village came in without
permission, and now and then, when the
winds arose, he could hear the stirring of
the palm trees.

Sabron was reduced to skin and bone.
His nourishment was insufficient, and the
absence of all decent care was slowly
taking him to death.  It will never be
known why he did not die.

PitchounÃ© took to making long excursions.
He would be absent for days, and
in his clouded mind Sabron thought the
dog was reconnoitering for him over the
vast pink sea without there—which, if
one could sail across as in a ship, one
would sail to France, through the walls
of mellow old Tarascon, to the chÃ¢teau
of good King RenÃ©; one would sail as
the moon sails, and through an open
window one might hear the sound of a
woman's voice singing.  The song, ever
illusive and irritating in its persistency,
tantalized his sick ears.

Sabron did not know that he would
have found the chÃ¢teau shut had he sailed
there in the moon.  It was as well that he
did not know, for his wandering thought
would not have known where to follow,
and there was repose in thinking of the
ChÃ¢teau d'Esclignac.

It grew terribly hot.  Fatou Anni, by
his side, fanned him with a fan she had
woven.  The great-great-grandchildren on
the floor in the mud fought together.  They
quarreled over bits of colored glass.
Sabron's breath came panting.  Without, he
heard the cries of the warriors, the
lance-bearers—he heard the cries of Fatou
Anni's sons who were going out to
battle.  The French soldiers were in a
distant part of the Sahara and Fatou Anni's
grandchildren were going out to pillage
and destroy.  The old woman by his side
cried out and beat her breast.  Now and
then she looked at him curiously, as if
she saw death on his pale face.  Now
that all her sons and grandsons had gone,
he was the only man left in the village,
as even boys of sixteen had joined the
raid.  She wiped his forehead and gave
him a potion that had healed her husband
after his body had been pierced with
arrows.  It was all she could do for a
captive.

Toward sundown, for the first time
Sabron felt a little better, and after
twenty-four hours' absence, PitchounÃ© whined
at the hut door, but would not come in.
Fatou Anni called on Allah, left her
patient and went out to see what was the
matter with the dog.  At the door, in
the shade of a palm, stood two Bedouins.

It was rare for the caravan to pass by
Beni Medinet.  The old woman's superstition
foresaw danger in this visit.  Her
veil before her face, her gnarled old
fingers held the fan with which she had been
fanning Sabron.  She went out to the
strangers.  Down by the well a group of
girls in garments of blue and yellow, with
earthen bottles on their heads, stood
staring at Beni Medinet's unusual visitors.

"Peace be with you, Fatou Anni," said
the older of the Bedouins.

"Are you a cousin or a brother that you
know my name?" asked the ancient woman.

"Every one knows the name of the
oldest woman in the Sahara," said Hammet
Abou, "and the victorious are always
brothers."

"What do you want with me?" she
asked, thinking of the helplessness of the
village.

Hammet Abou pointed to the hut

"You have a white captive in there.  Is
he alive?"

"What is that to you, son of a dog?"

"The mother of many sons is wise,"
said Hammet Abou portentously, "but
she does not know that this man carries
the Evil Eye.  His dog carries the Evil
Eye for his enemies.  Your people have
gone to battle.  Unless this man is
cast out from your village, your young
men, your grandsons and your sons will
be destroyed."

The old woman regarded him calmly.

"I do not fear it," she said tranquilly.
"We have had corn and oil in plenty.  He
is sacred."

For the first time she looked at his
companion, tall and slender and evidently
younger.

"You favor the coward Franks," she
said in a high voice.  "You have come to
fall upon us in our desolation."

She was about to raise the peculiar wail
which would have summoned to her all
the women of the village.  The dogs of
the place had already begun to show their
noses, and the villagers were drawing near
the people under the palms.  Now the
young man began to speak swiftly in a
language that she did not understand,
addressing his comrade.  The language
was so curious that the woman, with the
cry arrested on her lips, stared at him.
Pointing to his companion, Hammet
Abou said:

"Fatou Anni, this great lord kisses your
hand.  He says that he wishes he could
speak your beautiful language.  He does
not come from the enemy; he does not
come from the French.  He comes from
two women of his people by whom the
captive is beloved.  He says that you are
the Mother of sons and grandsons, and
that you will deliver this man up into our
hands in peace."

The narrow fetid streets were beginning
to fill with the figures of women,
their beautifully colored robes fluttering
in the light, and there were curious eager
children who came running, naked save
for the bangles upon their arms and
ankles.

Pointing to them, Hammet Abou said
to the old sage:

"See, you are only women here, Fatou
Anni.  Your men are twenty miles farther
south.  We have a caravan of fifty men all
armed, Fatou Anni.  They camp just
there, at the edge of the oasis.  They are
waiting.  We come in peace, old woman;
we come to take away the Evil Eye from
your door; but if you anger us and rave
against us, the dogs and women of your
town will fall upon you and destroy every
breast among you."

She began to beat her palms together,
murmuring:

"Allah!  Allah!"

"Hush," said the Bedouin fiercely,
"take us to the captive, Fatou Anni."

Fatou Anni did not stir.  She pulled
aside the veil from her withered face, so
that her great eyes looked out at the two
men.  She saw her predicament, but she
was a subtle Oriental.  Victory had been
in her camp and in her village; her sons
and grandsons had never been vanquished.
Perhaps the dying man in the hut would
bring the Evil Eye!  He was dying,
anyway—he would not live twenty-four
hours.  She knew this, for her ninety
years of life had seen many eyes close on
the oasis under the hard blue skies.

To the taller of the two Bedouins she
said in Arabic:

"Fatou Anni is nearly one hundred
years old.  She has borne twenty children,
she has had fifty grandchildren; she has
seen many wives, many brides and many
mothers.  She does not believe the sick man
has the Evil Eye.  She is not afraid of your
fifty armed men.  Fatou Anni is not afraid.
Allah is great.  She will not give up the
Frenchman because of fear, nor will she
give him up to any man.  She gives him
to the women of his people."

With dignity and majesty and with
great beauty of carriage, the old woman
turned and walked toward her hut and
the Bedouins followed her.

CHAPTER XXII

INTO THE DESERT

A week after the caravan of the
Duc de Tremont left Algiers, Julia
Redmond came unexpectedly to the villa
of Madame de la Maine at an early
morning hour.  Madame de la Maine saw her
standing on the threshold of her bedroom
door.

"
ChÃ¨re
Madame," Julia said, "I am
leaving to-day with a dragoman and
twenty servants to go into the desert."

Madame de la Maine was still in bed.
At nine o'clock she read her papers and
her correspondence.

"Into the desert—alone!"

Julia, with her
cravache
in her gloved
hands, smiled sweetly though she was very
pale.  "I had not thought of going alone,
Madame," she replied with charming
assurance, "I knew you would go with me."

On a chair by her bed was a wrapper
of blue silk and lace.  The comtesse sprang
up and then thrust her feet into her slippers
and stared at Julia.

"What are you going to do in the desert?"

"Watch!"

"Yes, yes!" nodded Madame de la
Maine.  "And your aunt?"

"Deep in a bazaar for the hospital,"
smiled Miss Redmond.

Madame de la Maine regarded her
slender friend with admiration and envy.
"Why hadn't I thought of it?"  She rang
for her maid.

"Because your great-grandfather was
not a pioneer!" Miss Redmond answered.

* * * * * * *

The sun which, all day long, held the
desert in its burning embrace, went
westward in his own brilliant caravan.

"The desert blossoms like a rose,
ThÃ©rÃ¨se."

"Like a rose?" questioned Madame de la Maine.

She was sitting in the door of her tent;
her white dress and her white hat gleamed
like a touch of snow upon the desert's
face.  Julia Redmond, on a rug at her
feet, and in her khaki riding-habit the
color of the sand, blended with the desert
as though part of it.  She sat up as she
spoke.

"How divine!  See!"  She pointed to
the stretches of the Sahara before her.  On
every side they spread away as far as the
eye could reach, suave, mellow, black,
undulating finally to small hillocks with
corrugated sides, as a group of little
sand-hills rose softly out of the sea-like plain.
"Look, ThÃ©rÃ¨se!"

Slowly, from ocher and gold the color
changed; a faint wave-like blush crept
over the sands, which reddened, paled,
faded, warmed again, took depth and
grew intense like flame.

"The heart of a rose!
N'est-ce pas
, ThÃ©rÃ¨se?"

"I understand now what you mean,"
said madame.  The comtesse was not a
dreamer.  Parisian to the tips of her
fingers, elegant, fine, she had lived a
conventional life.  ThÃ©rÃ¨se had been taught to
conceal her emotions.  She had been
taught that our feelings matter very little
to any one but ourselves.  She had been
taught to go lightly, to avoid serious
things.  Her great-grandmother had gone
lightly to the scaffold, exquisitely
courteous till the last.

"I ask your pardon if I jostled you in
the tumbrel," the old comtesse had said
to her companion on the way to the
guillotine.  "The springs of the cart are
poor"—and she went up smiling.

In the companionship of the American
girl, ThÃ©rÃ¨se de la Maine had thrown off
restraint.  If the Marquise d'Esclignac
had felt Julia's influence, ThÃ©rÃ¨se de la
Maine, being near her own age, echoed
Julia's very feeling.

Except for their dragoman and their
servants, the two women were alone in
the desert.

Smiling at Julia, Madame de la Maine
said: "I haven't been so far from the
Rue de la Paix in my life."

"How can you speak of the Rue de la
Paix, ThÃ©rÃ¨se?"

"Only to show you how completely I
have left it behind."

Julia's eyes were fixed upon the limitless
sands, a sea where a faint line lost
itself in the red west and the horizon shut
from her sight everything that she
believed to be her life.

"This is the seventh day, ThÃ©rÃ¨se!"

"Already you are as brown as an Arab, Julia!"

"You as well,
ma chÃ¨re amie
!"

"Robert does not like dark women,"
said the Comtesse de la Maine, and
rubbed her cheek.  "I must wear two
veils."

"Look, ThÃ©rÃ¨se!"

Across the face of the desert the glow
began to withdraw its curtain.  The sands
suffused an ineffable hue, a shell-like pink
took possession, and the desert melted and
then grew colder—it waned before their
eyes, withered like a tea-rose.

"Like a rose!" Julia murmured, "smell
its perfume!"  She lifted her head, drinking
in with delight the fragrance of the
sands.

"
Ma chÃ¨re
Julia," gently protested the
comtesse, lifting her head, "perfume,
Julia!"  But she breathed with her friend,
while a sweetly subtle, intoxicating odor,
as of millions and millions of roses,
gathered, warmed, kept, then scattered on the
airs of heaven, intoxicating her.

To the left were the huddled tents of
their attendants.  No sooner had the sun
gone down than the Arabs commenced to
sing—a song that Julia had especially
liked.

"Love is like a sweet perfume,

It comes, it escapes.

When it's present, it intoxicates;

When it's a memory, it brings tears.

Love is like a sweet breath,

It comes and it escapes."

The weird music filled the silence of
the silent place.  It had the evanescent
quality of the wind that brought the
breath of the sand-flowers.  The voices
of the Arabs, not unmusical, though
hoarse and appealing, cried out their
love-song, and then the music turned to
invocation and to prayer.

The two women listened silently as the
night fell, their figures sharply outlined
in the beautiful clarity of the eastern night.

Julia stood upright.  In her severe
riding-dress, she was as slender as a boy.
She remained looking toward the horizon,
immovable, patient, a silent watcher over
the uncommunicative waste.

"Perhaps," she thought, "there is nothing
really beyond that line, so fast blotting
itself into night!—and yet I seem to
see them come!"

Madame de la Maine, in the door of her
tent, immovable, her hands clasped around
her knees, looked affectionately at the
young girl before her.  Julia was a
delight to her.  She was carried away by
her, by her frank simplicity, and drawn
to her warm and generous heart.  Madame
de la Maine had her own story.  She
wondered whether ever, for any period of
her conventional life, she could have
thrown everything aside and stood out
with the man she loved.

Julia, standing before her, a dark slim
figure in the night—isolated and alone—recalled
the figurehead of a ship, its face
toward heaven, pioneering the open seas.

* * * * * * *

Julia watched, indeed.  On the desert
there is the brilliant day, a passionate
glow, and the nightfall.  They passed the
nights sometimes listening for a cry that
should hail an approaching caravan,
sometimes hearing the wild cry of the hyenas,
or of a passing vulture on his horrid
flight.  Otherwise, until the camp stirred
with the dawn and the early prayer-call
sounded "Allah!  Allah!  Akbar!" into the
stillness, they were wrapped in complete
silence.

CHAPTER XXIII

TWO LOVE STORIES

If it had not been for her absorbing
thought of Sabron, Julia would have
reveled in the desert and the new
experiences.  As it was, its charm and magic
and the fact that he traveled over it helped
her to endure the interval.

In the deep impenetrable silence she
seemed to hear her future speak to her.
She believed that it would either be a
wonderfully happy one, or a hopelessly
withered life.

"Julia, I can not ride any farther!"
exclaimed the comtesse.

She was an excellent horsewoman and
had ridden all her life, but her riding of
late had consisted of a canter in the Bois
de Boulogne at noon, and it was
sometimes hard to follow Julia's tireless
gallops toward an ever-disappearing goal.

"Forgive me," said Miss Redmond, and
brought her horse up to her friend's side.

It was the cool of the day, of the
fourteenth day since Tremont had left Algiers
and the seventh day of Julia's excursion.
A fresh wind blew from the west, lifting
their veils from their helmets and bringing
the fragrance of the mimosa into
whose scanty forest they had ridden.  The
sky paled toward sunset, and the evening
star, second in glory only to the moon,
hung over the west.

Although both women knew perfectly
well the reason for this excursion and its
importance, not one word had been spoken
between them of Sabron and Tremont
other than a natural interest and anxiety.

They might have been two hospital
nurses awaiting their patients.

They halted their horses, looking over
toward the western horizon and its
mystery.  "The star shines over their
caravan," mused Madame de la Maine (Julia
had not thought ThÃ©rÃ¨se poetical), "as
though to lead them home."

Madame de la Maine turned her face
and Julia saw tears in her eyes.  The
Frenchwoman's control was usually
perfect, she treated most things with
mocking gaiety.  The bright softness of her
eyes touched Julia.

"ThÃ©rÃ¨se!" exclaimed the American
girl.  "It is only fourteen days!"

Madame de la Maine laughed.  There
was a break in her voice.  "Only fourteen
days," she repeated, "and any one of
those days may mean death!"

She threw back her head, touched her
stallion, and flew away like light, and it
was Julia who first drew rein.

"ThÃ©rÃ¨se!  ThÃ©rÃ¨se!  We can not go any farther!"

"Lady!" said Azrael.  He drew his
big black horse up beside them.  "We
must go back to the tents."

Madame de la Maine pointed with her
whip toward the horizon.  "It is cruel!
It ever recedes!"

* * * * * * *

"Tell me, Julia, of Monsieur de Sabron,"
asked Madame de la Maine abruptly.

"There is nothing to tell, ThÃ©rÃ¨se."

"You don't trust me?"

"Do you think that, really?"

In the tent where Azrael served them
their meal, under the ceiling of Turkish
red with its Arabic characters in clear
white, Julia and Madame de la Maine sat
while their coffee was served them by a
Syrian servant.

"A girl does not come into the Sahara
and watch like a sentinel, does not suffer
as you have suffered,
ma chÃ¨re
, without
there being something to tell."

"It is true," said Miss Redmond, "and
would you be with me, ThÃ©rÃ¨se, if I did
not trust you?  And what do you want
me to tell?" she added naively.

The comtesse laughed.

"
Vous Ãªtes charmante
, Julia!"

"I met Monsieur de Sabron," said Julia
slowly, "not many months ago in Palestine.
I saw him several times, and then
he went away."

"And then?" urged Madame de la Maine eagerly.

"He left his little dog, PitchounÃ©, with
me, and PitchounÃ© ran after his master,
to Marseilles, flinging himself into the
water, and was rescued by the sailors.  I
wrote about it to Monsieur de Sabron,
and he answered me from the desert, the
night before he went into battle."

"And that's all?" urged Madame de la Maine.

"That's all," said Miss Redmond.  She
drank her coffee.

"You tell a love story very badly,
ma chÃ¨re
."

"Is it a love story?"

"Have you come to Africa for charity?

Voyons!
"

Julia was silent.  A great reserve
seemed to seize her heart, to stifle her as
the poverty of her love story struck her.
She sat turning her coffee-spoon between
her fingers, her eyes downcast.  She had
very little to tell.  She might never have
any more to tell.  Yet this was her love
story.  But the presence of Sabron was so
real, and she saw his eyes clearly looking
upon her as she had seen them often;
heard the sound of his voice that meant
but one thing—and the words of his letter
came back to her.  She remembered her
letter to him, rescued from the field where
he had fallen.  She raised her eyes to the
Comtesse de la Maine, and there was an
appeal in them.

The Frenchwoman leaned over and
kissed Julia.  She asked nothing more.
She had not learned her lessons in
discretion to no purpose.

At night they sat out in the moonlight,
white as day, and the radiance over the
sands was like the snow-flowers.
Wrapped in their warm coverings, Julia
and ThÃ©rÃ¨se de la Maine lay on the rugs
before the door of their tent, and above
their heads shone the stars so low that it
seemed as though their hands could
snatch them from the sky.  At a little
distance their servants sat around the dying
fire, and there came to them the plaintive
song of Azrael, as he led their singing:

"And who can give again the love of yesterday?

Can a whirlwind replace the sand after it is scattered?

What can heal the heart that Allah has smited?

Can the mirage form again when there are no eyes to see?"

"I was married," said Madame de la
Maine, "when I was sixteen."

Julia drew a little nearer and smiled to
herself in the shadow.

This would be a real love story.

"I had just come out of the convent.
We lived in an old chÃ¢teau, older than the
history of your country,
ma chÃ¨re
, and I
had no
dot
.  Robert de Tremont and I
used to play together in the
allÃ©es
of the
park, on the terrace.  When his mother
brought him over, when she called on my
grandmother, he teased me horribly
because the weeds grew between the stones
of our terrace.  He was very rude.

"Throughout our childhood, until I
was sixteen, we teased each other and
fought and quarreled."

"This is not a love-affair, ThÃ©rÃ¨se,"
said Miss Redmond.

"There are all kinds,
ma chÃ¨re
, as
there are all temperaments," said
Madame de la Maine.  "At Assumption—that
is our great feast, Julia—the Feast
of Mary—it comes in August—at
Assumption, Monsieur de la Maine came to
talk with my grandmother.  He was forty
years old, and bald—Bob and I made fun
of his few hairs, like the children in the
Holy Bible."

Julia put out her hand and took the
hand of Madame de la Maine gently.  She
was getting so far from a love-affair.

"I married Monsieur de la Maine in six
weeks," said ThÃ©rÃ¨se.

"Oh," breathed Miss Redmond, "horrible!"

Madame de la Maine pressed Julia's hand.

"When it was decided between my
grandmother and the comte, I escaped at
night, after they thought I had gone to
bed, and I went down to the lower terrace
where the weeds grew in plenty, and told
Robert.  Somehow, I did not expect him
to make fun, although we always joked
about everything until this night.  It was
after nine o'clock."

The comtesse swept one hand toward
the desert.  "A moon like this—only not
like this—
ma chÃ¨re
.  There was never
but that moon to me for many years.

"I thought at first that Bob would kill
me,—he grew so white and terrible.  He
seemed suddenly to have aged ten years.
I will never forget his cry as it rang out
in the night.  'You will marry that old
man when we love each other?'  I had
never known it until then.

"We were only children, but he grew
suddenly old.  I knew it then," said
Madame de la Maine intensely, "I knew it
then."

She waited for a long time.  Over the
face of the desert there seemed to be
nothing but one veil of light.  The silence
grew so intense, so deep; the Arabs had
stopped singing, but the heart fairly
echoed, and Julia grew meditative—before
her eyes the caravan she waited for
seemed to come out of the moonlit mist,
rocking, rocking—the camels and the
huddled figures of the riders, their
shadows cast upon the sand.

And now Tremont would be forever
changed in her mind.  A man who had
suffered from his youth, a warm-hearted
boy, defrauded of his early love.  It
seemed to her that he was a charming
figure to lead Sabron.

"ThÃ©rÃ¨se," she murmured, "won't you tell me?"

"They thought I had gone to bed," said
the Comtesse de la Maine, "and I went
back to my room by a little staircase,
seldom used, and I found myself alone, and
I knew what life was and what it meant
to be poor."

"But," interrupted Julia, horrified,
"girls are not sold in the twentieth century."

"They are sometimes in France, my
dear.  Robert was only seventeen.  His
father laughed at him, threatened to send
him to South America.  We were victims."

"It was the harvest moon," continued
Madame de la Maine gently, "and it shone
on us every night until my wedding-day.
Then the duke kept his threat and sent
Robert out of France.  He continued his
studies in England and went into the army
of Africa."

There was a silence again.

"I did not see him until last year," said
Madame de la Maine, "after my husband died."

CHAPTER XXIV

THE MEETING

Under the sun, under the starry
nights Tremont, with his burden,
journeyed toward the north.  The halts
were distasteful to him, and although he
was forced to rest he would rather have
been cursed with sleeplessness and have
journeyed on and on.  He rode his camel
like a Bedouin; he grew brown like the
Bedouins and under the hot breezes,
swaying on his desert ship, he sank into
dreamy, moody and melancholy reveries,
like the wandering men of the Sahara,
and felt himself part of the desolation, as
they were.

"What will be, will be!" Hammet
Abou said to him a hundred times, and
Tremont wondered: "Will Charles live
to see Algiers?"

Sabron journeyed in a litter carried
between six mules, and they traveled slowly,
slowly.  Tremont rode by the sick man's
side day after day.  Not once did the
soldier for any length of time regain his
reason.  He would pass from coma to
delirium, and many times Tremont thought
he had ceased to breathe.  Slender,
emaciated under his covers, Sabron lay like
the image of a soldier in wax—a wounded
man carried as a votive offering to the
altars of desert warfare.

At night as he lay in his bed in his
tent, Tremont and Hammet Abou cooled
his temples with water from the earthen
bottles, where the sweet ooze stood out
humid and refreshing on the damp clay.
They gave him acid and cooling drinks,
and now and then Sabron would smile on
Tremont, calling him "
petit frÃ¨re
", and
Tremont heard the words with moisture
in his eyes, remembering what he had
said to the Marquise d'Esclignac about
being Sabron's brother.  Once or twice
the soldier murmured a woman's name,
but Tremont could not catch it, and once
he said to the duke:

"Sing!  Sing!"

The Frenchman obeyed docilely,
humming in an agreeable barytone the
snatches of song he could remember, La
Fille de Madame Angot
, Il Trovatore
;
running then into more modern opera,
La
Veuve Joyeuse
.  But the lines creased in
Sabron's forehead indicated that the
singer had not yet found the music which
haunted the memory of the sick man.

"Sing!" he would repeat, fixing his
hollow eyes on his companion, and Tremont
complied faithfully.  Finally, his own
thoughts going back to early days, he
hummed tunes that he and a certain
little girl had sung at their games in the

allÃ©es
of an old chÃ¢teau in the valley of
the Indre.

"
Sonnez les matines

Ding—din—don,
"

and other children's melodies.

In those nights, on that desolate way,
alone, in a traveling tent, at the side of a
man he scarcely knew, Robert de
Tremont learned serious lessons.  He had
been a soldier himself, but his life had
been an inconsequent one.  He had lived
as he liked, behind him always the bitterness
of an early deception.  But he had
been too young to break his heart at
seventeen.  He had lived through much since
the day his father exiled him to Africa.

ThÃ©rÃ¨se had become a dream, a
memory around which he did not always let
his thoughts linger.  When he had seen
her again after her husband's death and
found her free, he was already absorbed
in the worldly life of an ambitious young
man.  He had not known how much he
loved her until in the Villa des
Bougainvilleas he had seen and contrasted her
with Julia Redmond.

All the charm for him of the past
returned, and he realized that, as money
goes, he was poor—she was poorer.

The difficulties of the marriage made
him all the more secure in his determination
that nothing should separate him
again from this woman.

By Sabron's bed he hummed his little
insignificant tunes, and his heart longed
for the woman.  When once or twice on
the return journey they had been threatened
by the engulfing sand-storm, he had
prayed not to die before he could again
clasp her in his arms.

Sweet, tantalizing, exquisite with the
sadness and the passion of young love,
there came to him the memories of the
moonlight nights on the terrace of the old
chÃ¢teau.  He saw her in the pretty girlish
dresses of long ago, the melancholy droop
of her quivering mouth, her bare young
arms, and smelled the fragrance of her
hair as he kissed her.  So humming his
soothing melodies to the sick man, with
his voice softened by his memories, he
soothed Sabron.

Sabron closed his eyes, the creases in
his forehead disappeared as though
brushed away by a tender hand.  Perhaps
the sleep was due to the fact that,
unconsciously, Tremont slipped into humming
a tune which Miss Redmond had sung in
the Villa des Bougainvilleas, and of
whose English words De Tremont was
quite ignorant.

"Will he last until Algiers, Hammet Abou?"

"What will be, will be, Monsieur!"
Abou replied.

"He must," De Tremont answered
fiercely.  "He shall."

He became serious and meditative on
those silent days, and his blue eyes, where
the very whites were burned, began to
wear the far-away mysterious look of the
traveler across long distances.  During
the last sand-storm he stood, with the
camels, round Sabron's litter, a human
shade and shield, and when the storm
ceased, he fell like one dead, and the
Arabs pulled off his boots and put him to
bed like a child.

One sundown, as they traveled into the
after-glow with the East behind them,
when Tremont thought he could not endure
another day of the voyage, when the
pallor and waxness of Sabron's face were
like death itself, Hammet Abou, who rode
ahead, cried out and pulled up his camel
short.  He waved his arm.

"A caravan, Monsieur!"

In the distance they saw the tents, like
lotus leaves, scattered on the pink sands,
and the dark shadows of the Arabs and
the couchant beasts, and the glow of the
encampment fire.

"An encampment, Monsieur!"

Tremont sighed.  He drew the curtain
of the litter and looked in upon Sabron,
who was sleeping.  His set features, the
growth of his uncut beard, the long fringe
of his eyes, his dark hair upon his
forehead, his wan transparency—with the
peace upon his face, he might have been
a figure of Christ waiting for sepulture.
Tremont cried to him: "Sabron,
mon
vieux
Charles,
rÃ©veille-toi
!  We are in
sight of human beings!"

But Sabron gave no sign that he heard
or cared.

Throughout the journey across the desert,
PitchounÃ© had ridden at his will and
according to his taste, sometimes journeying
for the entire day perched upon Tremont's
camel.  He sat like a little figurehead
or a mascot, with ears pointed northward
and his keen nose sniffing the desert
air.  Sometimes he would take the same
position on one of the mules that carried
Sabron's litter, but his favorite post was
within the litter, at his master's feet.
There he would lie hour after hour, with
his soft eyes fixed with understanding
sympathy upon Sabron's face.

He was, as he had been to Fatou Anni,
a kind of fetish: the caravan adored him.
Now from his position at Sabron's feet,
he crawled up and licked his master's hand.

"Charles!" Tremont cried, and lifted
the soldier's hand.

Sabron opened his eyes.  He was sane.
The glimmer of a smile touched his lips.
He said Tremont's name, recognized him.
"Are we home?" he asked weakly.  "Is it
France?"

Tremont turned and dashed away a tear.

He drew the curtains of the litter and
now walked beside it, his legs feeling like
cotton and his heart beating.

As they came up toward the encampment,
two people rode out to meet them,
two women in white riding-habits, on stallions,
and as the evening breeze fluttered
the veils from their helmets, they seemed
to be flags of welcome.

Under his helmet Tremont was red and
burned.  He had a short rough growth of
beard.

ThÃ©rÃ¨se de la Maine and Julia Redmond
rode up.  Tremont recognized them,
and came forward, half staggering.  He
looked at Julia and smiled, and pointed
with his left hand toward the litter; but
he went directly up to Madame de la
Maine, who sat immovable on her little
stallion.  Tremont seemed to gather her
in his arms.  He lifted her down to him.

Julia Redmond's eyes were on the litter,
whose curtains were stirring in the breeze.
Hammet Abou, with a profound salaam,
came forward to her.

"Mademoiselle," he said respectfully,
"he lives.  I have kept my word."

PitchounÃ© sprang from the litter and
ran over the sands to Julia Redmond.  She
dismounted from her horse alone and
called him: "PitchounÃ©!  PitchounÃ©!"  Kneeling
down on the desert, she stooped
to caress him, and he crouched at her feet,
licking her hands.

CHAPTER XXV

AS HANDSOME DOES

When Sabron next opened his
eyes he fancied that he was at
home in his old room in Rouen, in the
house where he was born, in the little
room in which, as a child, dressed in his
dimity night-gown, he had sat up in his
bed by candle-light to learn his letters
from the cookery book.

The room was snowy white.  Outside
the window he heard a bird sing, and
near by, he heard a dog's smothered bark.
Then he knew that he was not at home or
a child, for with the languor and weakness
came his memory.  A quiet nurse in
a hospital dress was sitting by his bed, and
PitchounÃ© rose from the foot of the bed
and looked at him adoringly.

He was in a hospital in Algiers.

"PitchounÃ©," he murmured, not knowing
the name of his other companion,
"where are we, old fellow?"

The nurse replied in an agreeable Anglo-Saxon French:

"You are in a French hospital in Algiers,
sir, and doing well."

Tremont came up to him.

"I remember you," Sabron said.  "You
have been near me a dozen times lately."

"You must not talk,
mon vieux
."

"But I feel as though I must talk a
great deal.  Didn't you come for me into
the desert?"

Tremont, healthy, vigorous, tanned,
gay and cheerful, seemed good-looking to
poor Sabron, who gazed up at him with
touching gratitude.

"I think I remember everything.  I
think I shall never forget it," he said, and
lifted his hand feebly.  Robert de Tremont
took it.  "Haven't we traveled far
together, Tremont?"

"Yes," nodded the other, affected, "but
you must sleep now.  We will talk about
it over our cigars and liquors soon."

Sabron smiled faintly.  His clear mind
was regaining its balance, and thoughts
began to sweep over it cruelly fast.  He
looked at his rescuer, and to him the
other's radiance meant simply that he was
engaged to Miss Redmond.  Of course
that was natural.  Sabron tried to accept
it and to be glad for the happiness of the
man who had rescued him.  But as he
thought this, he wondered why he had
been rescued and shut his eyes so that
Tremont might not see his weakness.  He said
hesitatingly:

"I am haunted by a melody, a tune.
Could you help me?  It won't come."

"It's not the
Marseillaise
?" asked the
other, sitting down by his side and pulling
PitchounÃ©'s ears.

"Oh, no!"

"There will be singing in the ward
shortly.  A Red Cross nurse comes to
sing to the patients.  She may help you to
remember."

Sabron renounced in despair.  Haunting,
tantalizing in his brain and illusive,
the notes began and stopped, began and
stopped.  He wanted to ask his friend a
thousand questions.  How he had come to
him, why he had come to him, how he
knew...  He gave it all up and dozed,
and while he slept the sweet sleep of those
who are to recover, he heard the sound of
a woman's voice in the distance, singing,
one after another, familiar melodies, and
finally he heard the
Kyrie Eleison
, and to
its music Sabron again fell asleep.

The next day he received a visitor.  It
was not an easy matter to introduce
visitors to his bedside, for PitchounÃ©
objected.  PitchounÃ© received the Marquise
d'Esclignac with great displeasure.

"Is he a thoroughbred?" asked the
Marquise d'Esclignac.

"He has behaved like one," replied the officer.

There was a silence.  The Marquise
d'Esclignac was wondering what her
niece saw in the pale man so near still to
the borders of the other world.

"You will be leaving the army, of
course," she murmured, looking at him
interestedly.

"Madame!" said the Capitaine de Sabron,
with his blood—all that was in him—rising
to his cheeks.

"I mean that France has done nothing
for you.  France did not rescue you and
you may feel like seeking a more—another career."

Sabron could not reply.  Her ribbons
and flowers and jewels shook in his eyes
like a kaleidoscope.  His flush had made
him more natural.  In his invalid state,
with his hair brushed back from his fine
brow, there was something spiritual and
beautiful about him.  The Marquise
d'Esclignac looked on a man who had been
far and who had determined of his own
accord to come back.  She said more
gently, putting her hand affectionately
over his:

"Get strong, Monsieur—get well.  Eat
all the good things we are making for you.
I dare say that the army can not spare
you.  It needs brave hearts."

Sabron was so agitated after her
departure that the nurse said he must receive no
more visits for several days, and he
meditated and longed and thought and
wondered, and nearly cursed the life that had
brought him back to a world which must
be lonely for him henceforth.

When he sat up in bed he was a shadow.
He had a book to read and read a few
lines of it, but he put it down as the letters
blurred.  He was sitting so, dreaming and
wondering how true or how false it was
that he had seen Julia Redmond come
several times to his bedside during the early
days of his illness here in the hospital.
Then across his troubled mind suddenly
came the words that he had heard her
sing, and he tried to recall them.  The
Red Cross nurse who so charitably sang in
the hospital came to the wards and began
her mission.  One after another she sang
familiar songs.

"How the poor devils must love it!"
Sabron thought, and he blessed her for
her charity.

How familiar was her voice!  But that
was only because he was so ill.  But he
began to wonder and to doubt, and across
the distance came the notes of the tune,
the melody of the song that had haunted
him for many months:

"God keep you safe, my love,

All through the night;

Rest close in His encircling arms

Until the light.

My heart is with you as I kneel to pray,

Good night!  God keep you in His care alway.

"Thick shadows creep like silent ghosts

About my head;

I lose myself in tender dreams

While overhead

The moon comes stealing through the window-bars,

A silver sickle gleaming 'mid the stars.

"For I, though I am far away,

Feel safe and strong,

To trust you thus, dear love—and yet,

The night is long.

I say with sobbing breath the old fond prayer,

Good night!  Sweet dreams!  God keep you everywhere!"

When she had finished singing there
were tears on the soldier's cheeks and he
was not ashamed.  PitchounÃ©, who
remembered the tune as well, crept up to
him and laid his head on his master's
hand.  Sabron had just time to wipe away
the tears when the Duc de Tremont came in.

"Old fellow, do you feel up to seeing
Miss Redmond for a few moments?"

* * * * * * *

When she came in he did not know
whether he most clearly saw her simple
summer dress with the single jewel at her
throat, her large hat that framed her face,
or the gentle lovely face all sweetness and
sympathy.  He believed her to be the
future Duchesse de Tremont.

"Monsieur de Sabron, we are all so glad
you are getting well."

"Thank you, Mademoiselle."

He seemed to look at her from a great
distance, from the distance to the end of
which he had so wearily been traveling.
She was lovelier than he had dreamed,
more rarely sweet and adorable.

"Did you recognize the little song, Monsieur?"

"It was good of you to sing it."

"This is not the first time I have seen
you, Monsieur de Sabron.  I came when
you were too ill to know of it."

"Then I did not dream," said the officer simply.

He was as proud as he was poor.  He
could only suppose her engaged to the
Duc de Tremont.  It explained her presence
here.  In his wildest dreams he could
not suppose that she had followed him to
Africa.  Julia, on her part, having done
an extraordinary and wonderful thing,
like every brave woman, was seized with
terror and a sudden cowardice.  Sabron,
after all, was a stranger.  How could she
know his feelings for her?  She spent a
miserable day.  He was out of all danger;
in a fortnight he might leave the hospital.
She did not feel that she could see him
again as things were.  The Comtesse de la
Maine had returned to Paris as soon as
Tremont came in from the desert.

"
Ma tante
," said Julia Redmond to the
Marquise d'Esclignac, "can we go back
to France immediately?"

"My dear Julia!" exclaimed her aunt,
in surprise and delight.  "Robert will be
enchanted, but he would not be able to
leave his friend so soon."

"He need not," said the girl, "nor need
you leave unless you wish."

The Marquise d'Esclignac entertained
a thousand thoughts.  She had not studied
young girls' minds for a long time.  She
had heard that the modern American girl
was very extreme and she held her in
rather light esteem.  Julia Redmond she
had considered to be out of the general
rule.  "Was it possible," she wondered,
"that Julia, in comparing Tremont with
the invalid, found Robert more attractive?"

"Julia," she said severely, as though her
niece were a child, pointing to a chair, "sit
down."

Slightly smiling, the young girl obeyed
her aunt.

"My dear, I have followed your
caprices from France to Africa.  Only by
pleading heart-failure and mortal illness
could I dissuade you from going into the
desert with the caravan.  Now, without
any apparent reason, you wish to return to
France."

"The reason for coming here has been
accomplished,
ma tante
.  Monsieur de
Sabron has been found."

"And now that you have found him,"
said the marquise reproachfully, "and you
discover that he is not all your romantic
fancy imagined, you are going to run
away from him.  In short, you mean to
throw him over."

"Throw him over,
ma tante
!" murmured
the girl.  "I have never had the
chance.  Between Monsieur de Sabron
and myself there is only friendship."

"Fiddlesticks!" said the Marquise
d'Esclignac impatiently.  "I have no
understanding of the modern young girl.
She makes her own marriages and her
subsequent divorces.  I am your aunt, my
dear, your mother's sister, and a woman
of at least twenty-five years' more
experience than you have."

Julia was not following her aunt's train
of thought, but her own.  She felt the hint
of authority and bondage in her aunt's
tone and repeated:

"I wish to leave Algiers to-morrow."

"You shall do so," said her aunt.  "I
am rejoiced to get out of the Orient.  It
is late to order my dresses for Trouville,
but I can manage.  Before we go, however,
my dear, I want you to make me a
promise."

"A promise,
ma tante
?"  The girl's tone
implied that she did not think she would
give it.

"You have played the part of fate in the
life of this young man, who, I find, is a
charming and brave man.  Now you must
stand by your guns, my dear Julia."

"Why, how do you mean,
ma tante
?"

"You will go to Paris and the Capitaine
de Sabron will get well rapidly.  He will
follow you, and if it were not for
Tremont, myself, your Red Cross Society and
the presence here of Madame de la
Maine, you would have been very much
compromised.  But never mind," said the
Marquise d'Esclignac magnificently, "my
name is sufficient protection for my niece.
I am thinking solely of the poor young man."

"Of Monsieur de Sabron?"

"Of course," said the Marquise
d'Esclignac tartly, "did you think I meant
Robert?  You have so well arranged
his

life for him, my dear."

"
Ma tante
," pleaded the girl.

The marquise was merciless.

"I want you to promise me, Julia, before
you sail for home, that if Sabron follows
us and makes you to understand that
he loves you, as he will, that you will
accept him."

Julia Redmond looked at the Marquise
d'Esclignac in astonishment.  She half
laughed and she half cried.

"You want me to promise?"

"I do," said her aunt firmly, regarding
her niece through her lorgnon.  "In the
first place the affair is entirely unconventional
and has been since we left France.
It is I who should speak to the Capitaine
de Sabron.  You are so extremely rich
that it will be a difficult matter for a poor
and honorable young man....  Indeed,
my dear, I may as well tell you that
I shall do so when we reach home."

"Oh," said the girl, turning perfectly
pale and stepping forward toward her
aunt, "if you consider such a thing I shall
leave for America at once."

The Marquise d'Esclignac gave a petulant sigh.

"How impossible you are, Julia.  Understand
me, my dear, I do not want a
woman of my family to be a coquette.  I
do not want it said that you are an American
flirt—it is in bad taste and entirely
misunderstood in the Faubourg St.-Germain."

The girl, bewildered by her aunt's attitude
and extremely troubled by the threat
of the marriage convention, said:

"Don't you understand?  In this case
it is peculiarly delicate.  He might ask me
from a sense of honor."

"Not in any sense," said the Marquise
d'Esclignac.  "It has not occurred to the
poor young officer to suppose for a
moment that a young woman with millions,
as you are so fortunate to be, would
derange herself like this to follow him.  If
I thought so I would not have brought
you, Julia.  What I have done, I have
done solely for your peace of mind, my
child.  This young man loves you.  He
believes that you love him, no doubt.  You
have given him sufficient reason, heaven
knows!  Now," said her aunt emphatically,
"I do not intend that you should break
his heart."

It was more than likely that the Marquise
d'Esclignac was looking back twenty-five
years to a time, when as a rich
American, she had put aside her love for
a penniless soldier with an insignificant
title.  She remembered how she had
followed his campaign.  She folded her
lorgnon and looked at her niece.  Julia
Redmond saw a cloud pass over her
aunt's tranquil face.  She put her arms
around her and kissed her tenderly.

"You really think then,
ma tante
, that
he will come to Paris?"

"Without a doubt, my dear."

"You think he cares,
ma tante
?"

Her aunt kissed her and laughed.

"I think you will be happy to a bourgeois
extent.  He is a fine man."

"But do I need to
promise
you?" asked
the girl.  "Don't you
know
?"

"I shall be perfectly ashamed of you,"
said the Marquise d'Esclignac, "if you are
anything but a woman of heart and
decision in this matter."

Evidently she waited, and Julia Redmond,
slightly bowing her lovely head in
deference to the older lady who had not
married her first love, said obediently:

"I promise to do as you wish,
ma tante
."

CHAPTER XXVI

CONGRATULATIONS

The Duc de Tremont saw what
splendid stuff the captain in the
—— Cavalry was made of by the
young man's quick convalescence.  Sabron
could not understand why Robert
lingered after the departure of the
Marquise d'Esclignac, the Comtesse de la
Maine and Miss Redmond.  The presence
of the young man would have been
agreeable if it had not been for his
jealously and his unhappiness.

They played piquet together.  Sabron,
in his right mind, thinner and paler,
nevertheless very much of a man, now smoked
his cigarettes and ate his three meals a
day.  He took a walk every day and was
quite fit to leave the Orient.  Tremont said:

"I think, Sabron, that we can sail this week."

Sabron looked at him questioningly.

"You are going, then, too—?"

"Of course," said the young nobleman
heartily.  "We are going together.  You
know I am going to take you back in my
yacht."

Sabron hesitated and then said:

"No,
mon vieux
, if you will excuse me I
think I shall remain faithful to the old
line of travel.  I have an idea that I am
not in yachting trim."

Tremont was not too dull to have
noticed his friend's change of attitude
toward him.  He smoked for a few
moments and then said:

"When we get back to Paris I want to
have the pleasure of introducing you to
my fiancÃ©e."

Sabron dropped his cards.

"Introducing me!" he repeated.  Then
putting out his hand, said cordially: "I
knew you were to be felicitated, old fellow."

Tremont shook his hand warmly.

"Yes, and the lady is very anxious to
know you.  It is Madame de la Maine."

A very warm color flushed the cheeks
of the invalid.  He remembered all he had
heard and all he had known.  He congratulated
his friend with sincere warmth, and
after a few moments said:

"If you really want me to go back with
you on the yacht, old chap—"

"I really do," said Tremont serenely.
"You see, when we came on the boat we
scarcely hoped to be so fortunate as to
bring back the distinguished captain."

Sabron smiled.

"But you have not told me yet," he said,
"why you came down."

"No," said Tremont, "that is true.
Well, it will make a story for the sea."

CHAPTER XXVII

VALOR IN RETROSPECT

In the month of May, when the chestnuts
bloom in the green dells, where
the delicate young foliage holds the light
as in golden cups, a young man walked
through one of the small
allÃ©es
of the Bois
at the fashionable noon hour, a little
reddish dog trotting at his heels.  The young
man walked with an imperceptible limp.
He was thin as men are thin who have
lived hard and who have overcome
tremendous obstacles.  He was tanned as
men are browned who have come from
eastern and extreme southern countries.

The little dog had also an imperceptible
limp occasioned by a bicycle running over
him when he was a puppy.

The two companions seemed immensely
to enjoy the spring day.  Sabron every
now and then stood for a few moments
looking into the green of the woods, looking
at the gay passers-by, pedestrians and
equestrians, enjoying to the full the repose
of civilization, the beauty of his own land.

PitchounÃ© looked with indifference upon
the many dogs.  He did not stir from
his master's side.  When Sabron was
quiet, the little animal stood at attention;
he was a soldier's dog.  He could have
told dog stories to those insignificant
worldly dogs—could have told of really
thrilling adventures.  His brown eyes
were pathetic with their appeal of
affection as they looked up at his beloved
master.  He had a fund of experience such as
the poodles and the terriers led by their
owners, could not understand.  Therefore
PitchounÃ© was indifferent to them.  Not
one of those petted, ridiculous house dogs
could have run for miles in the dark
across an African desert, could have
found the regiment and fetched relief to
his master.  PitchounÃ© was proud of it.
He was very well satisfied with his career.
He was still young; other deeds of valor
perhaps lay before him—who can tell?  At
any rate, he had been shown about at the
ministry of war, been very much admired,
and he was a proud animal.

When Sabron spoke to him he leaped
upon him and wagged his tail.  After a
few moments, as the two stood near the
exit of an
allÃ©e
leading to one of the
grand avenues, PitchounÃ© slowly went in
front of his master and toward two ladies
sitting on a bench in the gentle warmth of
the May sunlight.  PitchounÃ©, moved from
his usual indifference, gave a short bark,
walked up to the ladies, and began to snuff
about their feet.  The younger lady
exclaimed, and then Sabron, lifting his hat,
came forward, the crimson color beating
in his dark tanned cheeks.

The Marquise d'Esclignac held out
both hands to the officer:

"It's nearly noon," she said, "and you
don't forget that you have promised to
lunch with us, do you, Monsieur le Capitaine?"

Sabron, bending over her hand, assured
her that he had not forgotten.  Then his
eyes traveled to her companion.  Miss
Redmond wore a very simple dress, as
was her fashion, but the young officer
from Africa who had not seen her near by
until now and who had only caught a
glimpse of her across the opera-house,
thought that he had never seen such a
beautiful dress in all his life.  It was made
of soft gray cloth and fitted her closely,
and in the lapel of her mannish little
buttonhole she wore a few Parma violets.  He
recognized them.  They had come from a
bunch that he had sent her the night
before.  He kissed her hand, and they stood
talking together, the three of them, for a
few moments, PitchounÃ© stationing himself
as a sentinel by Miss Redmond's side.

The Marquis d'Esclignac rose.  The
young girl rose as well, and they walked
on together.

"
Mes enfants
," said the Marquise
d'Esclignac, "don't go with your usual
rush, Julia.  Remember that Monsieur de
Sabron is not as strong as Hercules yet.
I will follow you with PitchounÃ©."

But she spoke without knowledge of the
dog.  Now feeling that some unwonted
happiness had suddenly burst upon the
horizon that he knew, PitchounÃ© seemed
suddenly seized with a rollicking spirit
such as had been his characteristic some
years ago.  He tore like mad down the
path in front of Sabron and Miss
Redmond.  He whirled around like a dervish,
he dashed across the road in front of
automobiles, dashed back again, springing
upon his master and whining at the girl's feet.

"See," said Sabron, "how happy he is."

"I should think he would be happy.  He
must have a knowledge of what an
important animal he is.  Just think!  If he
were a man they would give him a decoration."

And the two walked tranquilly side by side.

PitchounÃ© ran to the side of the road,
disappeared into a little forest all shot
through with light.  He came back, bringing
the remains of an old rubber ball lost
there by some other dog, and laid it
triumphantly in front of Miss Redmond.

"See," said Sabron, "he brings you his
trophies."

CHAPTER XXVIII

HAPPINESS

Le Comte de Sabron finished his dressing.

Brunet surveyed his master from the tip
of his shining boots to his sleek fair head.
His expressive eyes said: "Monsieur le
Capitaine is looking well to-night."

Brunet had never before given his
master a direct compliment.  His eyes only
had the habit of expressing admiration,
and the manner in which he performed
his duties, his devotion, were his forms of
compliment.  But Sabron's long illness
and absence, the fact that he had been
snatched from death and given back to
the army again, leveled between servant
and master the impassable wall of etiquette.

"There will be a grand dinner to-night,
will there not, Monsieur le Capitaine?
Doubtless Monsieur le Colonel and all the
gentlemen will be there."  Brunet made a
comprehensive gesture as though he
comprised the entire
Ã©tat major
.

Sabron, indeed, looked well.  He was
thin, deeply bronzed by the exposure on
the yacht, for he and Tremont before
returning to France had made a long cruise.
Sabron wore the look of a man who has
come back from a far country and is content.

"And never shall I forget to the end of
my days how Monsieur le Capitaine
looked when I met the yacht at Marseilles!"

Brunet spoke reverently, as though he
were chronicling sacred souvenirs.

"I said to myself, you are about to
welcome back a hero, Brunet!  Monsieur le
Capitaine will be as weak as a child.  But
I was determined that Monsieur le
Capitaine should not read my feelings,
however great my emotion."

Sabron smiled.  At no time in his simple
life did Brunet ever conceal the most
trifling emotion—his simple face revealed
all his simple thoughts.  Sabron said
heartily: "Your control was very fine, indeed."

"Instead of seeing a sick man, Monsieur
le Capitaine, a splendid-looking figure,
with red cheeks and bright eyes came off
the boat to the shore.  I said to myself:
'Brunet, he has the air of one who comes
back from a victory.'  No one would have
ever believed that Monsieur le Capitaine
had been rescued from captivity."

Brunet's curiosity was very strong and
as far as his master was concerned he had
been obliged to crush it down.  To
himself he was saying: "Monsieur le
Capitaine is on the eve of some great event.
When will he announce it to me?  I am

sure
my master is going to be married."

PitchounÃ©, from a chair near by, assisted
at his master's toilet, one moment
holding the razor-strop between his teeth,
then taking the clothes brush in his little
grip.  He was saying to himself: "I hope
in the name of rats and cats my master is
not going out without me!"

Brunet was engaged to be married to
the kitchen maid of the Marquise
d'Esclignac.
Ordonnances
and scullions are
not able to arrange their matrimonial
affairs so easily as are the upper classes.

"Monsieur le Capitaine," said the servant,
his simple face raised to his master's,
"I am going to be married."

Sabron wheeled around: "
Mon
brave
Brunet, when?"

Brunet grinned sheepishly.

"In five years, Monsieur le Capitaine,"
at which the superior officer laughed
heartily.

"Is she an infant, are you educating her?"

"When one is the eldest son of a widow,"
said Brunet with a sigh, "and the
eldest of ten children—"

The clock struck the quarter.  Sabron
knew the story of the widow and ten
children by heart.

"Is the taxi at the door?"

"Yes, Monsieur le Capitaine."

PitchounÃ© gave a sharp bark.

"You are not invited," said his master
cruelly, and went gaily out, his sword
hitting against the stairs.

* * * * * * *

The Marquise d'Esclignac gave a brilliant
little dinner to the colonel of Sabron's
squadron.  There were present a
general or two, several men of distinction,
and among the guests were the Duc de
Tremont and Madame de la Maine.
Sabron, when he found himself at table,
looked at everything as though in a
dream.  Julia Redmond sat opposite him.
He had sent her flowers and she wore
them in her bodice.  Madame de la Maine
bent upon the young officer benignant
eyes, the Duc de Tremont glanced at him
affectionately, but Sabron was only
conscious that Julia's eyes did not meet his
at all.

They talked of Sabron's captivity, of
the engagement in Africa, of what the
army was doing, would not do, or might
do, and the fact that the Duc de Tremont
was to receive the decoration of the
Legion of Honor in July.  Tremont toasted
Sabron and the young officer rose to
respond with flushing face.  He looked
affectionately at his friend who had brought
him from death into life.  The moment
was intense, and the Marquise d'Esclignac
lifted her glass:

"Now, gentlemen, you must drink to
the health of PitchounÃ©."

There was a murmur of laughter.  Madame
de la Maine turned to Sabron:

"I have had a collar made for PitchounÃ©;
it is of African leather set with
real turquoise."

Sabron bowed: "PitchounÃ© will be
perfectly enchanted, Madame; he will
wear it at your wedding."

* * * * * * *

Later, when the others had left them
to themselves in the music-room, Sabron
sat in a big chair by the open window and
Julia Redmond played to him.  The day
was warm.  There was a smell of
spring flowers in the air and the vases
were filled with
girofles
and sweet peas.
But Sabron smelt only the violets in
Julia's girdle.  Her hands gently
wandered over the keys, finding the tune
that Sabron longed to hear.  She played
the air through, and it seemed as though
she were about to sing the first verse.  She
could not do so, nor could she speak.

Sabron rose and came over to where she sat.

There was a low chair near the piano
and he took it, leaning forward, his hands
clasped about his knees.  It had been the
life-long dream of this simple-hearted
officer that one day he would speak out
his soul to the woman he loved.  The time
had come.  She sat before him in her
unpretentious dress.  He was not worldly
enough to know it cost a great price, nor
to appreciate that she wore no jewels—nothing
except the flowers he had sent.
Her dark hair was clustered about her
ears and her beautiful eyes lost their fire
in tenderness.

"When a man has been very close to
death, Mademoiselle, he looks about for
the reason of his resurrection.  When he
returns to the world, he looks to see what
there is in this life to make it worth
living.  I am young—at the beginning of
my career.  I may have before me a long
life in which, with health and friends, I
may find much happiness.  These things
certainly have their worth to a normal
man—but I can not make them real before
my eyes just yet.  As I look upon the
world to which I have returned, I see
nothing but a woman and her love.  If I
can not win her for my wife, if I can not
have her love—"  He made an expressive
gesture which more impressively than
words implied how completely he laid
down everything else to her love and his.

He said, not without a certain dignity:
"I am quite poor; I have only my soldier's
pay.  In Normandy I own a little
property.  It is upon a hill and looks over
the sea, with apple orchards and wheat
fields.  There is a house.  These are my
landed estates.  My manhood and my
love are my fortune.  If you can not
return my love I shall not thank Tremont
for bringing me back from Africa."

The American girl listened to him with
profound emotion.  She discovered every
second how well she understood him, and
he had much to say, because it was the
first time he had ever spoken to her of his
love.  She had put out both her hands
and, looking at him fully, said simply:

"Why it seems to me you must know
how I feel—how can you help knowing
how I feel?"

* * * * * * *

After a little he told her of Normandy,
and how he had spent his childhood and
boyhood in the chÃ¢teau overlooking the
wide sea, told her how he had watched
the ships and used to dream of the
countries beyond the horizon, and how the
apple-blossoms filled the orchards in the
spring.  He told her how he longed to go
back, and that his wandering life had
made it impossible for years.

Julia whispered: "We shall go there in
the spring, my friend."

He was charming as he sat there holding
her hands closely, his fine eyes bent
upon her.  Sabron told her things that
had been deep in his heart and mind,
waiting for her here so many months.
Finally, everything merged into his
present life, and the beauty of what he said
dazed her like an enchanted sea.  He was
a soldier, a man of action, yet a dreamer.
The fact that his hopes were about to be
realized made him tremble, and as he
talked, everything took light from this
victory.  Even his house in Normandy
began to seem a fitting setting for the
beautiful American.

"It is only a Louis XIII chÃ¢teau; it
stands very high, surrounded by orchards,
which in the spring are white as snow."

"We shall go there in the spring," she
whispered.

Sabron stopped speaking, his reverie
was done, and he was silent as the intensity
of his love for her surged over him.
He lifted her delicate hands to his lips.
"It is April now," he said, and his voice
shook, "it is spring now, my love."

* * * * * * *

At Julia's side was a slight touch.  She
cried: "PitchounÃ©!"  He put his paws on
her knees and looked up into her face.

"Brunet has brought him here," said
Sabron, "and that means the good chap
is attending to his own love-making."

Julia laid her hand on PitchounÃ©'s
head.  "He will love the Normandy beach,
Charles."

"He will love the forests," said Sabron;
"there are rabbits there."

On the little dog's head the two hands
met and clasped.  "PitchounÃ© is the only
one in the world who is not de trop," said
Julia gently.

Sabron, lifting her hand again to his
lips, kissed it long, looking into her eyes.
Between that great mystery of the awakening
to be fulfilled, they drew near to
each other—nearer.

PitchounÃ© sat before them, waiting.  He
wagged his tail and waited.  No one
noticed him.  He gave a short bark that
apparently disturbed no one.

PitchounÃ© had become de trop.

He was discreet.  With sympathetic
eyes he gazed on his beloved master and
new mistress, then turned and quietly
trotted across the room to the hearth-rug,
sitting there meditatively for a few
minutes blinking at the empty grate, where
on the warm spring day there was no fire.

PitchounÃ© lay down before the fireless
hearth, his head forward on his paws, his
beautiful eyes still discreetly turned away
from the lovers.  He drew a long contented
breath as dogs do before settling into
repose.  His thrilling adventures had come
to an end.  Before fires on the friendly
hearth of the Louis XIII chÃ¢teau, where
hunting dogs were carved in the stone
above the chimney, PitchounÃ© might
continue to dream in the days to come.  He
would hunt rabbits in the still forests
above the wheat fields, and live again in
the firelight his great adventures on the
desert, the long runs across the sands on
his journey back to France.

Now he closed his eyes.  As a faithful
friend he rested in the atmosphere of
happiness about him.  He had been the sole
companion of a lonely man, now he had
become part of a family.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢

Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundationâs EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Fellow Students
,
[1]

I look
back to-day to a time before
the middle of the century, when I was
UNITY OF MODERN HISTORY

reading at Edinburgh, and fervently wishing
to come to this University. At three
colleges I applied for admission, and, as
things then were, I was refused by all.
Here, from the first, I vainly fixed my
hopes, and here, in a happier hour,
after five-and-forty years, they are at last
fulfilled.

I desire first to speak to you of that which
I may reasonably call the Unity of Modern
History, as an easy approach to questions
[2]

necessary to be met on the threshold by
any one occupying this place, which my
predecessor has made so formidable to me
by the reflected lustre of his name.

You have often heard it said that
Modern History is a subject to which
neither beginning nor end can be assigned.
No beginning, because the dense web of
the fortunes of man is woven without a
void; because, in society as in nature, the
structure is continuous, and we can trace
things back uninterruptedly, until we
dimly descry the Declaration of Independence
in the forests of Germany. No
end, because, on the same principle,
history made and history making are
scientifically inseparable and separately
unmeaning.

“Politics,” said Sir John Seeley, “are
vulgar when they are not liberalised by
[3]

history, and history fades into mere literature
LINK BETWEEN HISTORY AND POLITICS

when it loses sight of its relation
to practical politics.” Everybody perceives
the sense in which this is true. For the
science of politics is the one science that is
deposited by the stream of history, like
grains of gold in the sand of a river; and
the knowledge of the past, the record of
truths revealed by experience, is eminently
practical, as an instrument of action, and
a power that goes to the making of the
future.
[1]
In France, such is the weight
attached to the study of our own time,
that there is an appointed course of contemporary
history, with appropriate textbooks.
[2]

That is a chair which, in the
progressive division of labour by which
both science and government prosper,
[3]

may some day be founded in this country.
Meantime, we do well to acknowledge
[4]

the points at which the two epochs
diverge. For the contemporary differs
from the modern in this, that many of its
facts cannot by us be definitely ascertained.
The living do not give up their secrets
with the candour of the dead; one key
is always excepted, and a generation
passes before we can ensure accuracy.
Common report and outward seeming
are bad copies of the reality, as the
initiated know it. Even of a thing
so memorable as the war of 1870, the
true cause is still obscure; much that
we believed has been scattered to the
winds in the last six months, and further
revelations by important witnesses are
about to appear. The use of history turns
far more on certainty than on abundance
of acquired information.

Beyond the question of certainty is the
[5]

question of detachment. The process by
which principles are discovered and appropriated
is other than that by which, in
practice, they are applied; and our most
sacred and disinterested convictions ought
to take shape in the tranquil regions of
the air, above the tumult and the tempest
of active life.
[4]
For a man is justly despised
who has one opinion in history and
another in politics, one for abroad and
another at home, one for opposition and
another for office. History compels us
to fasten on abiding issues, and rescues
us from the temporary and transient.
Politics and history are interwoven,
but are not commensurate. Ours is a
domain that reaches farther than affairs of
state, and is not subject to the jurisdiction
of governments. It is our function to
keep in view and to command the movement
[6]

of ideas, which are not the effect but
the cause of public events;
[5]
and even to
allow some priority to ecclesiastical history
over civil, since, by reason of the graver
issues concerned, and the vital consequences
of error, it opened the way in
research, and was the first to be treated by
close reasoners and scholars of the higher
rank.
[6]

In the same manner, there is wisdom
and depth in the philosophy which always
considers the origin and the germ, and
NOT GOVERNED BY NATIONAL CAUSES

glories in history as one consistent epic.
[7]

Yet every student ought to know that
mastery is acquired by resolved limitation.
And confusion ensues from the theory of
Montesquieu and of his school, who,
adapting the same term to things unlike,
insist that freedom is the primitive condition
of the race from which we are
[7]

sprung.
[8]
If we are to account mind not
matter, ideas not force, the spiritual
property that gives dignity, and grace, and
intellectual value to history, and its action
on the ascending life of man, then we shall
not be prone to explain the universal by
the national, and civilisation by custom.
[9]

A speech of Antigone, a single sentence of
Socrates, a few lines that were inscribed on
an Indian rock before the Second Punic
War, the footsteps of a silent yet prophetic
people who dwelt by the Dead Sea, and
perished in the fall of Jerusalem, come
nearer to our lives than the ancestral
wisdom of barbarians who fed their swine
on the Hercynian acorns.

For our present purpose, then, I describe
as modern history that which begins
four hundred years ago, which is marked
MEDIÆVAL LIMIT OF MODERN HISTORY

off by an evident and intelligible line from
[8]

the time immediately preceding, and displays
in its course specific and distinctive
characteristics of its own.
[10]
The modern
age did not proceed from the mediæval by
normal succession, with outward tokens
of legitimate descent. Unheralded, it
founded a new order of things, under a
law of innovation, sapping the ancient
reign of continuity. In those days
Columbus subverted the notions of the
world, and reversed the conditions of production,
wealth and power; in those days,
Machiavelli released government from the
restraint of law; Erasmus diverted the
current of ancient learning from profane
into Christian channels; Luther broke the
chain of authority and tradition at the
strongest link; and Copernicus erected an
invincible power that set for ever the mark
of progress upon the time that was to
[9]

come. There is the same unbound originality
and disregard for inherited sanctions
in the rare philosophers as in the discovery
of Divine Right, and the intruding Imperialism
of Rome. The like effects are
visible everywhere, and one generation
beheld them all. It was an awakening of
new life; the world revolved in a different
orbit, determined by influences unknown
before. After many ages persuaded of
the headlong decline and impending dissolution
of society,
[11]
and governed by usage
and the will of masters who were in their
graves, the sixteenth century went forth
armed for untried experience, and ready
to watch with hopefulness a prospect of
incalculable change.

That forward movement divides it
broadly from the older world; and the
unity of the new is manifest in the universal
spirit of investigation and discovery
INFLUENCE OF KNOWLEDGE ON MODERN HISTORY

which did not cease to operate, and withstood
the recurring efforts of reaction,
[10]

until, by the advent of the reign of general
ideas which we call the Revolution, it at
length prevailed.
[12]
This successive deliverance
and gradual passage, for good
and evil, from subordination to independence
is a phenomenon of primary
import to us, because historical science has
been one of its instruments.
[13]
If the Past
has been an obstacle and a burden, knowledge
of the Past is the safest and the
surest emancipation. And the earnest
search for it is one of the signs that distinguish
the four centuries of which I speak
from those that went before. The middle
ages, which possessed good writers of
contemporary narrative, were careless and
impatient of older fact. They became
[11]

content to be deceived, to live in a twilight
of fiction, under clouds of false
witness, inventing according to convenience,
and glad to welcome the forger
and the cheat.
[14]
As time went on,
the atmosphere of accredited mendacity
thickened, until, in the Renaissance, the
art of exposing falsehood dawned upon
keen Italian minds. It was then that
history as we understand it began to be
understood, and the illustrious dynasty of
scholars arose to whom we still look both
for method and material. Unlike the
dreaming prehistoric world, ours knows the
need and the duty to make itself master of
the earlier times, and to forfeit nothing
of their wisdom or their warnings,
[15]
and
has devoted its best energy and treasure
to the sovereign purpose of detecting error
and vindicating entrusted truth.
[16]

In this epoch of full-grown history men
[12]

have not acquiesced in the given conditions
of their lives. Taking little for
INTERNATIONAL IDEAS

granted they have sought to know the
ground they stand on, and the road they
travel, and the reason why. Over them,
therefore, the historian has obtained an increasing
ascendancy.
[17]
The law of stability
was overcome by the power of ideas, constantly
varied and rapidly renewed;
[18]
ideas
that give life and motion, that take wing
and traverse seas and frontiers, making it
futile to pursue the consecutive order of
events in the seclusion of a separate
nationality.
[19]
They compel us to share the
existence of societies wider than our own,
to be familiar with distant and exotic
types, to hold our march upon the loftier
summits, along the central range, to live
in the company of heroes, and saints, and
[13]

men of genius, that no single country
could produce. We cannot afford wantonly
MEMORABLE MEN

to lose sight of great men and
memorable lives, and are bound to store up
objects for admiration as far as may be;
[20]

for the effect of implacable research is constantly
to reduce their number. No intellectual
exercise, for instance, can be more
invigorating than to watch the working of
the mind of Napoleon, the most entirely
known as well as the ablest of historic
men. In another sphere, it is the
vision of a higher world to be intimate
with the character of Fénelon, the
cherished model of politicians, ecclesiastics,
and men of letters, the witness against
one century and precursor of another, the
advocate of the poor against oppression,
of liberty in an age of arbitrary
power, of tolerance in an age of persecution,
[14]

of the humane virtues among men
accustomed to sacrifice them to authority,
INDEPENDENT MINDS

the man of whom one enemy says that his
cleverness was enough to strike terror,
and another, that genius poured in torrents
from his eyes. For the minds that are
greatest and best alone furnish the instructive
examples. A man of ordinary
proportion or inferior metal knows not
how to think out the rounded circle of
his thought, how to divest his will of
its surroundings and to rise above the
pressure of time and race and circumstance,
[21]

to choose the star that guides
his course, to correct, and test, and assay
his convictions by the light within,
[22]
and,
with a resolute conscience and ideal
courage, to re-model and reconstitute the
character which birth and education gave
him.
[23]

For ourselves, if it were not the quest of
[15]

the higher level and the extended horizon,
international history would be imposed by
FOREIGN CONSTITUTIONS

the exclusive and insular reason that parliamentary
reporting is younger than parliaments.
The foreigner has no mystic
fabric in his government, and no
arcanum
imperii
. For him, the foundations have
been laid bare; every motive and function
of the mechanism is accounted for as
distinctly as the works of a watch. But
with our indigenous constitution, not made
with hands or written upon paper, but
claiming to develope by a law of organic
growth; with our disbelief in the virtue of
definitions and general principles and our
reliance on relative truths, we can have
nothing equivalent to the vivid and prolonged
debates in which other communities
have displayed the inmost secrets of
[16]

political science to every man who can
read. And the discussions of constituent
assemblies, at Philadelphia, Versailles and
Paris, at Cadiz and Brussels, at Geneva,
Frankfort and Berlin, above nearly all,
those of the most enlightened States in
the American Union, when they have
recast their institutions, are paramount
in the literature of politics, and proffer
treasures which at home we have never
enjoyed.

To historians the later part of their
enormous subject is precious because it is
inexhaustible. It is the best to know
RESOURCES OF MODERN HISTORY

because it is the best known and the most
explicit. Earlier scenes stand out from a
background of obscurity. We soon reach
the sphere of hopeless ignorance and unprofitable
doubt. But hundreds and even
thousands of the moderns have borne
[17]

testimony against themselves, and may be
studied in their private correspondence
and sentenced on their own confession.
Their deeds are done in the daylight.
Every country opens its archives and
invites us to penetrate the mysteries of
State. When Hallam wrote his chapter
on James II., France was the only
Power whose reports were available.
Rome followed, and the Hague; and then
came the stores of the Italian States, and
at last the Prussian and the Austrian
papers, and partly those of Spain. Where
Hallam and Lingard were dependent on
Barillon, their successors consult the
diplomacy of ten governments. The
topics indeed are few on which the resources
have been so employed that we
can be content with the work done for us,
and never wish it to be done over again.
[18]

Part of the lives of Luther and Frederic,
a little of the Thirty Years' War, much
of the American Revolution and the
BEGINNING OF THE DOCUMENTARY AGE

French Restoration, the early years of
Richelieu and Mazarin, and a few
volumes of Mr. Gardiner, show here
and there like Pacific islands in
the ocean. I should not even venture
to claim for Ranke, the real originator
of the heroic study of records,
and the most prompt and fortunate of
European pathfinders, that there is one of
his seventy volumes that has not been
overtaken and in part surpassed. It is
through his accelerating influence mainly
that our branch of study has become progressive,
so that the best master is quickly
distanced by the better pupil.
[24]
The
Vatican archives alone, now made accessible
to the world, filled 3,239 cases when
[19]

they were sent to France; and they are not
the richest. We are still at the beginning
of the documentary age, which will tend
to make history independent of historians,
to develope learning at the expense of
writing, and to accomplish a revolution
in other sciences as well.
[25]

To men in general I would justify the
stress I am laying on modern history,
neither by urging its varied wealth, nor the
MODERN HISTORY

rupture with precedent, nor the perpetuity
of change and increase of pace, nor the
growing predominance of opinion over
belief, and of knowledge over opinion, but
by the argument that it is a narrative told
of ourselves, the record of a life which is
our own, of efforts not yet abandoned to
repose, of problems that still entangle the
feet and vex the hearts of men. Every
part of it is weighty with inestimable
[20]

lessons that we must learn by experience
and at a great price, if we know not how
to profit by the example and teaching of
those who have gone before us, in a
society largely resembling the one we live
in.
[26]
Its study fulfils its purpose even if
it only makes us wiser, without producing
books, and gives us the gift of historical
thinking, which is better than historical
learning.
[27]
It is a most powerful
ingredient in the formation of character
and the training of talent, and our historical
judgments have as much to do with
hopes of heaven as public or private conduct.
Convictions that have been strained
through the instances and the comparisons
of modern times differ immeasurably in
solidity and force from those which every
new fact perturbs, and which are often little
better than illusions or unsifted prejudice.
[28]

The first of human concerns is religion,
[21]

and it is the salient feature of the
modern centuries. They are signalised as
A SCHOOL OF OPINION

the scene of Protestant developments.
Starting from a time of extreme indifference,
ignorance, and decline, they were at
once occupied with that conflict which was
to rage so long, and of which no man
could imagine the infinite consequences.
Dogmatic conviction—for I shun to speak
of faith in connection with many characters
of those days—dogmatic conviction rose
to be the centre of universal interest, and
remained down to Cromwell the supreme
influence and motive of public policy. A
time came when the intensity of prolonged
conflict, when even the energy of antagonistic
assurance, abated somewhat, and the
controversial spirit began to make room
for the scientific; and as the storm subsided,
[22]

and the area of settled questions
emerged, much of the dispute was abandoned
to the serene and soothing touch
INFLUENCE OF THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENT

of historians, invested as they are with
the prerogative of redeeming the cause
of religion from many unjust reproaches,
and from the graver evil of reproaches
that are just. Ranke used to say that
Church interests prevailed in politics until
the Seven Years' War, and marked a
phase of society that ended when the
hosts of Brandenburg went into action
at Leuthen, chanting their Lutheran
hymns.
[29]
That bold proposition would be
disputed even if applied to the present
age. After Sir Robert Peel had broken up
his party, the leaders who followed him declared
that no-popery was the only basis
on which it could be reconstructed.
[30]
On
the other side may be urged that, in July
[23]

1870, at the outbreak of the French war,
the only government that insisted on the
abolition of the temporal power was
Austria; and since then we have witnessed
the fall of Castelar, because he attempted
to reconcile Spain with Rome.

Soon after 1850 several of the most
intelligent men in France, struck by the
arrested increase of their own population
RELIGION

and by the telling statistics from
Further Britain, foretold the coming preponderance
of the English race. They
did not foretell, what none could then
foresee, the still more sudden growth
of Prussia, or that the three most
important countries of the globe would,
by the end of the century, be those
that chiefly belonged to the conquests of
the Reformation. So that in Religion, as
in so many things, the product of these
[24]

centuries has favoured the new elements;
and the centre of gravity, moving from the
Mediterranean nations to the Oceanic, from
the Latin to the Teuton, has also passed
from the Catholic to the Protestant.
[31]

Out of these controversies proceeded
political as well as historical science. It
was in the Puritan phase, before the restoration
THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY

of the Stuarts, that theology, blending
with politics, effected a fundamental
change. The essentially English reformation
of the seventeenth century was less
a struggle between churches than between
sects, often subdivided by questions of
discipline and self-regulation rather than
by dogma. The sectaries cherished no
purpose or prospect of prevailing over the
nations; and they were concerned with
the individual more than with the congregation,
with conventicles, not with
[25]

state-churches. Their view was narrowed,
but their sight was sharpened. It appeared
to them that governments and
institutions are made to pass away, like
things of earth, whilst souls are immortal;
that there is no more proportion between
liberty and power than between eternity
and time; that, therefore, the sphere of
enforced command ought to be restricted
within fixed limits, and that which had
been done by authority, and outward discipline,
and organised violence, should
be attempted by division of power, and
committed to the intellect and the conscience
of free men.
[32]
Thus was exchanged
the dominion of will over will for the
dominion of reason over reason. The
true apostles of toleration are not those
who sought protection for their own beliefs,
or who had none to protect; but men
[26]

to whom, irrespective of their cause, it
was a political, a moral, and a theological
REVOLUTION

dogma, a question of conscience, involving
both religion and policy.
[33]
Such a man
was Socinus; and others arose in the
smaller sects—the Independent founder of
the colony of Rhode Island, and the
Quaker patriarch of Pennsylvania. Much
of the energy and zeal which had laboured
for authority of doctrine was employed for
liberty of prophesying. The air was filled
with the enthusiasm of a new cry; but the
cause was still the same. It became a
boast that religion was the mother of
freedom, that freedom was the lawful off
spring of religion; and this transmutation,
this subversion of established forms of
political life by the development of religious
thought, brings us to the heart of my
subject, to the significant and central
[27]

feature of the historic cycle before us.
Beginning with the strongest religious
THE MODE OF LIBERTY

movement and the most refined despotism
ever known, it has led to the superiority
of politics over divinity in the life of
nations, and terminates in the equal claim
of every man to be unhindered by man in
the fulfilment of duty to God
[34]
—a doctrine
laden with storm and havoc, which is
the secret essence of the Rights of Man,
and the indestructible soul of Revolution.

When we consider what the adverse
forces were, their sustained resistance,
their frequent recovery, the critical moments
when the struggle seemed for ever
desperate, in 1685, in 1772, in 1808, it is no
hyperbole to say that the progress of the
world towards self-government would have
been arrested but for the strength afforded
by the religious motive in the seventeenth
[28]

century. And this constancy of
PROGRESS

progress, of progress in the direction
of organised and assured freedom, is
the characteristic fact of modern history,
and its tribute to the theory, of
Providence.
[35]
Many persons, I am well
assured, would detect that this is a
very old story, and a trivial commonplace,
and would challenge proof that
the world is making progress in aught
but intellect, that it is gaining in freedom,
or that increase in freedom is either a
progress or a gain. Ranke, who was my
own master, rejected the view that I
have stated;
[36]
Comte, the master of better
men, believed that we drag a lengthening
chain under the gathered weight of the
dead hand;
[37]
and many of our recent
classics, Carlyle, Newman, Froude, were
persuaded that there is no progress
[29]

justifying the ways of God to man, and
that the mere consolidation of liberty is
THE MARK OF PROVIDENCE

like the motion of creatures whose advance
is in the direction of their tails. They
deem that anxious precaution against bad
government is an obstruction to good,
and degrades morality and mind by
placing the capable at the mercy of the
incapable, dethroning enlightened virtue
for the benefit of the average man. They
hold that great and salutary things are
done for mankind by power concentrated,
not by power balanced and cancelled
and dispersed, and that the whig theory,
sprung from decomposing sects, the theory
that authority is legitimate only by virtue
of its checks, and that the sovereign
is dependent on the subject, is rebellion
against the divine will manifested all
down the stream of time.
[30]

I state the objection not that we may
plunge into the crucial controversy of a
science that is not identical with ours,
CERTAINTY

but in order to make my drift clear by
the defining aid of express contradiction.
No political dogma is as serviceable to
my purpose here as the historian's maxim
to do the best he can for the other side,
and to avoid pertinacity or emphasis on his
own. Like the economic precept
Laissez-faire
[38]

which the eighteenth century
derived from Colbert, it has been an
important, if not a final step in the making
of method. The strongest and most
impressive personalities, it is true, like
Macaulay, Thiers, and the two greatest of
living writers, Mommsen and Treitschke,
project their own broad shadow upon their
pages. This is a practice proper to great
men, and a great man may be worth several
[31]

immaculate historians. Otherwise there is
virtue in the saying that a historian is seen
at his best when he does not appear.
[39]

Better for us is the example of the Bishop
DEPENDENT ON RESERVE

of Oxford, who never lets us know what
he thinks of anything but the matter
before him; and of his illustrious French
rival, Fustel de Coulanges, who said to
an excited audience: “Do not imagine
you are listening to me; it is history
itself that speaks.”
[40]
We can found no
philosophy on the observation of four
hundred years, excluding three thousand.
It would be an imperfect and a fallacious
induction. But I hope that even this
narrow and disedifying section of history
will aid you to see that the action of
Christ who is risen on mankind whom he
redeemed fails not, but increases;
[41]
that
the wisdom of divine rule appears not in
[32]

the perfection but in the improvement
of the world;
[42]
and that achieved liberty
is the one ethical result that rests on
the converging and combined conditions
of advancing civilisation.
[43]
Then you will
understand what a famous philosopher said,
that History is the true demonstration of
Religion.
[44]

But what do people mean who proclaim
that liberty is the palm, and the prize,
and the crown, seeing that it is an idea of
MEANING OF LIBERTY

which there are two hundred definitions,
and that this wealth of interpretation has
caused more bloodshed than anything,
except theology? Is it Democracy as in
France, or Federalism as in America, or
the national independence which bounds
the Italian view, or the reign of the fittest,
which is the ideal of Germans?
[45]
I know
not whether it will ever fall within my
[33]

sphere of duty to trace the slow progress
of that idea through the chequered scenes
of our history, and to describe how subtle
speculations touching the nature of conscience
promoted a nobler and more
spiritual conception of the liberty that
protects it,
[46]
until the guardian of rights
developed into the guardian of duties
which are the cause of rights,
[47]
and that
which had been prized as the material
safeguard for treasures of earth became
sacred as security for things that are divine.
All that we require is a workday key to
history, and our present need can be
supplied without pausing to satisfy philosophers.
Without inquiring how far
Sarasa or Butler, Kant or Vinet, is right
as to the infallible voice of God in man,
we may easily agree in this, that where
absolutism reigned, by irresistible arms, concentrated
[34]

possessions, auxiliary churches,
THE GROWTH OF REVOLUTION

and inhuman laws, it reigns no more; that
commerce having risen against land,
labour against wealth, the state against the
forces dominant in society,
[48]
the division
of power against the state, the thought of
individuals against the practice of ages,
neither authorities, nor minorities, nor
majorities can command implicit obedience;
and, where there has been long and
arduous experience, a rampart of tried
conviction and accumulated knowledge,
[49]

where there is a fair level of general
morality, education, courage, and self-restraint,
there, if there only, a society
may be found that exhibits the condition
of life towards which, by elimination of
failures, the world has been moving
through the allotted space.
[50]
You will
know it by outward signs: Representation,
[35]

the extinction of slavery, the reign of
opinion, and the like; better still by less
apparent evidences: the security of the
weaker groups
[51]
and the liberty of conscience,
which, effectually secured, secures
the rest.

Here we reach a point at which my
argument threatens to abut on a contradiction.
If the supreme conquests of
society are won more often by violence
than by lenient arts, if the trend and
drift of things is towards convulsions and
catastrophes,
[52]
if the world owes religious
liberty to the Dutch Revolution, constitutional
government to the English,
federal republicanism to the American,
political equality to the French and its
successors,
[53]
what is to become of us,
docile and attentive students of the absorbing
Past? The triumph of the Revolutionist
[36]

annuls the historian.
[54]
By its
authentic exponents, Jefferson and Sieyès,
the Revolution of the last century repudiates
RENOVATION OF HISTORY BY REVOLUTION

history. Their followers renounced
acquaintance with it, and were ready to
destroy its records and to abolish its inoffensive
professors. But the unexpected
truth, stranger than fiction, is that this was
not the ruin but the renovation of history.
Directly and indirectly, by process of development
and by process of reaction,
an impulse was given which made it
infinitely more effectual as a factor of
civilisation than ever before, and a movement
began in the world of minds which
was deeper and more serious than the
revival of ancient learning.
[55]
The dispensation
under which we live and labour
consists first in the recoil from the
negative spirit that rejected the law of
[37]

growth, and partly in the endeavour to
classify and adjust the revolution, and to
account for it by the natural working
of historic causes. The Conservative
line of writers, under the name of the
Romantic or Historical School, had its
seat in Germany, looked upon the Revolution
as an alien episode, the error of
an age, a disease to be treated by the investigation
of its origin, and strove to
unite the broken threads and to restore the
normal conditions of organic evolution.
The Liberal School, whose home was
France, explained and justified the Revolution
as a true development, and the ripened
fruit of all history.
[56]
These are the two
main arguments of the generation to
which we owe the notion and the
scientific methods that make history so
unlike what it was to the survivors of the
[38]

last century. Severally, the innovators
USE OF UNPUBLISHED SOURCES

were not superior to the men of old.
Muratori was as widely read, Tillemont as
accurate, Leibniz as able, Fréret as acute,
Gibbon as masterly in the craft of composite
construction. Nevertheless, in the
second quarter of this century, a new era
began for historians.

I would point to three things in particular,
out of many, which constitute the
amended order. Of the incessant deluge
INSUFFICIENCY OF BOOKS

of new and unsuspected matter I need
say little. For some years, the secret
archives of the papacy were accessible
at Paris; but the time was not ripe,
and almost the only man whom they
availed was the archivist himself.
[57]

Towards 1830 the documentary studies
began on a large scale, Austria leading the
way. Michelet, who claims, towards 1836,
[39]

to have been the pioneer,
[58]
was preceded
by such rivals as Mackintosh, Bucholtz,
and Mignet. A new and more productive
period began thirty years later, when the
war of 1859 laid open the spoils of Italy.
Every country in succession has now
allowed the exploration of its records, and
there is more fear of drowning than of
drought. The result has been that a
lifetime spent in the largest collection
of printed books would not suffice to train
a real master of modern history. After he
had turned from literature to sources, from
Burnet to Pocock, from Macaulay to
Madame Campana, from Thiers to the
interminable correspondence of the Bonapartes,
he would still feel instant need of
inquiry at Venice or Naples, in the Ossuna
library or at the Hermitage.
[59]

These matters do not now concern us.
[40]

For our purpose, the main thing to learn
is not the art of accumulating material,
HISTORY RENEWED BY CRITICISM

but the sublimer art of investigating it,
of discerning truth from falsehood, and
certainty from doubt. It is by solidity
of criticism more than by the plenitude
of erudition, that the study of history
strengthens, and straightens, and extends
the mind.
[60]
And the accession of the
critic in the place of the indefatigable compiler,
of the artist in coloured narrative,
the skilled limner of character, the persuasive
advocate of good, or other, causes,
amounts to a transfer of government, to a
change of dynasty, in the historic realm.
For the critic is one who, when he lights
on an interesting statement, begins by
suspecting it. He remains in suspense
until he has subjected his authority to
three operations. First, he asks whether
[41]

he has read the passage as the author
wrote it. For the transcriber, and the
editor, and the official or officious censor
on the top of the editor, have played
strange tricks, and have much to answer
for. And if they are not to blame, it may
turn out that the author wrote his book
twice over, that you can discover the first
jet, the progressive variations, things
added, and things struck out. Next is the
question where the writer got his information.
If from a previous writer, it can be
ascertained, and the inquiry has to be repeated.
If from unpublished papers, they
must be traced, and when the fountain
head is reached, or the track disappears,
the question of veracity arises. The responsible
writer's character, his position,
antecedents, and probable motives have
to be examined into; and this is what,
[42]

in a different and adapted sense of the
word, may be called the higher criticism,
CRITICAL STUDY OF EARLIER TIMES

in comparison with the servile and often
mechanical work of pursuing statements
to their root. For a historian has to be
treated as a witness, and not believed unless
his sincerity is established.
[61]
The maxim
that a man must be presumed to be innocent
until his guilt is proved, was not made
for him.

For us then the estimate of authorities,
the weighing of testimony, is more
meritorious than the potential discovery
of new matter.
[62]
And modern history,
which is the widest field of application,
is not the best to learn our business in;
for it is too wide, and the harvest has
not been winnowed as in antiquity, and
further on to the Crusades. It is better
to examine what has been done for questions
[43]

that are compact and circumscribed,
such as the sources of Plutarch's
Pericles
,
the two tracts on Athenian government,
the origin of the epistle to Diognetus, the
date of the life of St. Antony; and to
learn from Schwegler how this analytical
work began. More satisfying because
more decisive has been the critical treatment
of the mediæval writers, parallel
with the new editions, on which incredible
labour has been lavished, and of which we
have no better examples than the prefaces
of Bishop Stubbs. An important event in
this series was the attack on Dino Compagni,
which, for the sake of Dante,
roused the best Italian scholars to a not
unequal contest. When we are told that
England is behind the Continent in
critical faculty, we must admit that this is
true as to quantity, not as to quality of
[44]

work. As they are no longer living, I will
DEGREES OF IMPARTIALITY

say of two Cambridge professors, Lightfoot
and Hort, that they were critical scholars
whom neither Frenchman nor German has
surpassed.

The third distinctive note of the generation
of writers who dug so deep a trench
between history as known to our grandfathers
and as it appears to us, is their
dogma of impartiality. To an ordinary
man the word means no more than
justice. He considers that he may proclaim
the merits of his own religion, of
his prosperous and enlightened country, of
his political persuasion, whether democracy,
or liberal monarchy, or historic conservatism,
without transgression or offence,
so long as he is fair to the relative, though
inferior merits of others, and never treats
men as saints or as rogues for the side they
[45]

take. There is no impartiality, he would
say, like that of a hanging judge. The men
who, with the compass of criticism in their
hands, sailed the uncharted sea of original
research, proposed a different view. History,
to be above evasion or dispute, must stand
on documents, not on opinions. They had
their own notion of truthfulness, based on
the exceeding difficulty of finding truth,
and the still greater difficulty of impressing
it when found. They thought it possible
to write, with so much scruple, and
simplicity, and insight, as to carry along
with them every man of good will, and,
whatever his feelings, to compel his assent.
Ideas which, in religion and in politics,
are truths, in history are forces. They
must be respected; they must not be
affirmed. By dint of a supreme reserve,
by much self-control, by a timely and
[46]

discreet indifference, by secrecy in the
matter of the black cap, history might be
lifted above contention, and made an
accepted tribunal, and the same for all.
[63]

If men were truly sincere, and delivered
MORALITY THE SOLE RULE OF JUDGMENT

judgment by no canons but those of
evident morality, then Julian would be described
in the same terms by Christian and
pagan, Luther by Catholic and Protestant,
Washington by Whig and Tory, Napoleon
by patriotic Frenchman and patriotic
German.
[64]

I speak of this school with reverence, for
the good it has done, by the assertion of
historic truth and of its legitimate authority
over the minds of men. It provides a discipline
which every one of us does well to
undergo, and perhaps also well to relinquish.
For it is not the whole truth. Lanfrey's
essay on Carnot, Chuquet's wars of the
[47]

Revolution, Ropes's military histories,
Roget's Geneva in the time of Calvin, will
supply you with examples of a more robust
impartiality than I have described. Renan
calls it the luxury of an opulent and
aristocratic society, doomed to vanish in
an age of fierce and sordid striving. In
our universities it has a magnificent and
appointed refuge; and to serve its cause,
which is sacred, because it is the cause of
truth and honour, we may import a profitable
lesson from the highly unscientific
region of public life. There a man does
not take long to find out that he is
opposed by some who are abler and
better than himself. And, in order to
understand the cosmic force and the
true connection of ideas, it is a source
of power, and an excellent school of principle,
not to rest until, by excluding the
[48]

fallacies, the prejudices, the exaggerations
which perpetual contention and the consequent
EXAMPLE OF RANKE

precautions breed, we have made out
for our opponents a stronger and more
impressive case than they present themselves.
[65]

Excepting one to which we are
coming before I release you, there is
no precept less faithfully observed by
historians.

Ranke is the representative of the age
which instituted the modern study of
history. He taught it to be critical, to be
colourless, and to be new. We meet him
at every step, and he has done more for us
than any other man. There are stronger
books than any one of his, and some may
have surpassed him in political, religious,
philosophic insight, in vividness of the
creative imagination, in originality, elevation,
and depth of thought; but by the
[49]

extent of important work well executed, by
SUPPRESSION OF OPINION

his influence on able men, and by the
amount of knowledge which mankind
receives and employs with the stamp
of his mind upon it, he stands without a
rival. I saw him last in 1877, when he
was feeble, sunken, and almost blind, and
scarcely able to read or write. He uttered
his farewell with kindly emotion, and I
feared that the next I should hear of him
would be the news of his death. Two
years later he began a Universal History
which is not without traces of weakness,
but which, composed after the age of
eighty-three, and carried, in seventeen
volumes, far into the Middle Ages, brings
to a close the most astonishing career in
literature.

His course had been determined, in
early life, by
Quentin Durward
. The
[50]

shock of the discovery that Scott's Lewis
the Eleventh was inconsistent with the
original in Commynes made him resolve
that his object thenceforth should be above
all things to follow, without swerving, and
in stern subordination and surrender, the
lead of his authorities. He decided
effectually to repress the poet, the patriot,
the religious or political partisan, to
sustain no cause, to banish himself from
his books, and to write nothing that would
gratify his own feelings or disclose his
private convictions.
[66]
When a strenuous
divine who, like him, had written on the
Reformation, hailed him as a comrade,
Ranke repelled his advances. “You,” he
said, “are in the first place a Christian: I am
in the first place a historian. There is a
gulf between us.”
[67]
He was the first eminent
writer who exhibited what Michelet
[51]

calls
le désintéressement des morts
. It
was a moral triumph for him when he
could refrain from judging, show that
much might be said on both sides, and
leave the rest to Providence.
[68]
He would
have felt sympathy with the two famous
London physicians of our day, of whom
CRITICISM OF MODERN SOURCES

it is told that they could not make up
their minds on a case and reported
dubiously. The head of the family insisted
on a positive opinion. They
answered that they were unable to give
one, but he might easily find fifty doctors
who could.

Niebuhr had pointed out that chroniclers
who wrote before the invention
of printing generally copied one predecessor
at a time, and knew little
about sifting or combining authorities.
The suggestion became luminous in
[52]

Ranke's hands, and with his light and dexterous
touch he scrutinised and dissected
the principal historians, from Machiavelli
to the
Mémoires d'un Homme d'État
, with
a rigour never before applied to moderns.
But whilst Niebuhr dismissed the traditional
story, replacing it with a construction
of his own, it was Ranke's mission to
preserve, not to undermine, and to set up
masters whom, in their proper sphere, he
could obey. The many excellent dissertations
in which he displayed this art,
though his successors in the next generation
matched his skill and did still more
thorough work, are the best introduction
from which we can learn the technical
process by which within living memory
the study of modern history has been
renewed. Ranke's contemporaries, weary
of his neutrality and suspense, and of
[53]

the useful but subordinate work that
was done by beginners who borrowed his
METHOD TO BE LEARNT FROM SCIENCES

wand, thought that too much was made
of these obscure preliminaries which a
man may accomplish for himself, in the
silence of his chamber, with less demand
on the attention of the public.
[69]
That may
be reasonable in men who are practised in
these fundamental technicalities. We who
have to learn them, must immerse ourselves
in the study of the great examples.

Apart from what is technical, method is
only the reduplication of common sense,
and is best acquired by observing its use
by the ablest men in every variety of intellectual
employment.
[70]
Bentham acknowledged
that he learned less from his own
profession than from writers like Linnæus
and Cullen; and Brougham advised the
student of Law to begin with Dante.
[54]

Liebig described his
Organic Chemistry

as an application of ideas found in Mill's

Logic
, and a distinguished physician, not
to be named lest he should overhear me,
read three books to enlarge his medical
mind; and they were Gibbon, Grote, and
Mill. He goes on to say, “An educated
man cannot become so on one study alone,
but must be brought under the influence
of natural, civil, and moral modes of
thought.”
[71]
I quote my colleague's golden
words in order to reciprocate them. If men
of science owe anything to us, we may learn
much from them that is essential.
[72]
For
they can show how to test proof, how to
secure fulness and soundness in induction,
how to restrain and to employ with safety
hypothesis and analogy. It is they who
hold the secret of the mysterious property
of the mind by which error ministers to
[55]

truth, and truth slowly but irrevocably prevails.
[73]

Theirs is the logic of discovery,
[74]

the demonstration of the advance of knowledge
and the development of ideas, which
as the earthly wants and passions of men
remain almost unchanged, are the charter
of progress, and the vital spark in history.
And they often give us invaluable counsel
when they attend to their own subjects
and address their own people. Remember
Darwin, taking note only of those passages
that raised difficulties in his way; the
French philosopher complaining that his
work stood still, because he found no more
contradicting facts; Baer, who thinks error
treated thoroughly, nearly as remunerative
as truth, by the discovery of new objections;
for, as Sir Robert Ball warns us,
it is by considering objections that we
often learn.
[75]
Faraday declares that “in
[56]

knowledge, that man only is to be condemned
and despised who is not in a
state of transition.” And John Hunter
spoke for all of us, when he said: “Never
ask me what I have said or what I have
written; but if you will ask me what my
present opinions are, I will tell you.”

From the first years of the century we
have been quickened and enriched by
contributors from every quarter. The
ALL ADOPT THE HISTORIC METHOD

jurists brought us that law of continuous
growth which has transformed history
from a chronicle of casual occurrences
into the likeness of something organic.
[76]

Towards 1820 divines began to recast
their doctrines on the lines of development,
of which Newman said, long after,
that evolution had come to confirm it.
[77]

Even the Economists, who were practical
men, dissolved their science into liquid
[57]

history, affirming that it is not an auxiliary,
but the actual subject-matter of their inquiry.
[78]

Philosophers claim that, as early
as 1804, they began to bow the metaphysical
neck beneath the historical yoke.
They taught that philosophy is only the
amended sum of all philosophies, that
systems pass with the age whose impress
they bear,
[79]
that the problem is to focus
the rays of wandering but extant truth,
and that history is the source of philosophy,
if not quite a substitute for it.
[80]

Comte begins a volume with the words
that the preponderance of history over
philosophy was the characteristic of the
time he lived in.
[81]
Since Cuvier first
recognised the conjunction between the
course of inductive discovery and the
course of civilization,
[82]
science had its share
in saturating the age with historic ways
[58]

of thought, and subjecting all things to
that influence for which the depressing
DANGER OF OBLIVION

names historicism and historical-mindedness
have been devised.

There are certain faults which are corrigible
mental defects on which I ought
to say a few denouncing words, because
they are common to us all. First: the
want of an energetic understanding of
the sequence and real significance of
events, which would be fatal to a practical
politician, is ruin to a student of history
who is the politician with his face turned
backwards.
[83]
It is playing at study, to
see nothing but the unmeaning and unsuggestive
surface, as we generally do.
Then we have a curious proclivity to
neglect, and by degrees to forget, what
has been certainly known. An instance
or two will explain my idea. The
[59]

most popular English writer relates how
it happened in his presence that the title
of Tory was conferred upon the Conservative
party. For it was an opprobrious
name at the time, applied to men for whom
the Irish Government offered head-money;
so that if I have made too sure of progress,
I may at least complacently point
to this instance of our mended manners.
One day, Titus Oates lost his temper
with the men who refused to believe
him, and after looking about for a scorching
imprecation, he began to call them
Tories.
[84]
The name remained; but its
origin, attested by Defoe, dropped out
of common memory, as if one party were
ashamed of their godfather, and the other
did not care to be identified with his cause
and character. You all know, I am sure,
the story of the news of Trafalgar, and
[60]

how, two days after it had arrived, Mr.
Pitt, drawn by an enthusiastic crowd, went
PROPHECY OF PITT

to dine in the city. When they drank the
health of the minister who had saved his
country, he declined the praise. “England,”
he said, “has saved herself by her
own energy; and I hope that after having
saved herself by her energy, she will save
Europe by her example.” In 1814, when
this hope had been realised, the last speech
of the great orator was remembered, and
a medal was struck upon which the
whole sentence was engraved, in four
words of compressed Latin: “
Seipsam
virtute, Europam exemplo.
” Now it
was just at the time of his last appearance
in public that Mr. Pitt heard of the
overwhelming success of the French in
Germany, and of the Austrian surrender
at Ulm. His friends concluded that the
[61]

contest on land was hopeless, and that
it was time to abandon the Continent to
the conqueror, and to fall back upon our
new empire of the sea. Pitt did not
agree with them. He said that Napoleon
would meet with a check whenever he
encountered a national resistance; and
he declared that Spain was the place for
it, and that then England would intervene.
[85]

General Wellesley, fresh from
India, was present. Ten years later,
when he had accomplished that which
Pitt had seen in the lucid prescience of
his last days, he related at Paris what
I scarcely hesitate to call the most astounding
and profound prediction in all
political history, where such things have
not been rare.

I shall never again enjoy the opportunity
of speaking my thoughts to such an
[62]

audience as this, and on so privileged an
occasion a lecturer may well be tempted to
bethink himself whether he knows of any
RULES FOR THE STUDY OF HISTORY

neglected truth, any cardinal proposition,
that might serve as his selected epigraph,
as a last signal, perhaps even as a target.
I am not thinking of those shining precepts
which are the registered property
of every school; that is to say—Learn
as much by writing as by reading; be
not content with the best book; seek sidelights
from the others; have no favourites;
keep men and things apart; guard
against the prestige of great names;
[86]

see that your judgments are your own,
and do not shrink from disagreement;
no trusting without testing; be more
severe to ideas than to actions;
[87]
do not
overlook the strength of the bad cause
or the weakness of the good;
[88]
never be
[63]

surprised by the crumbling of an idol or
the disclosure of a skeleton; judge talent
at its best and character at its worst;
suspect power more than vice,
[89]
and study
problems in preference to periods; for
instance: the derivation of Luther, the
scientific influence of Bacon, the predecessors
of Adam Smith, the mediæval
masters of Rousseau, the consistency of
Burke, the identity of the first Whig.
Most of this, I suppose, is undisputed, and
calls for no enlargement. But the weight
of opinion is against me when I exhort
you never to debase the moral currency or
to lower the standard of rectitude, but to
try others by the final maxim that governs
your own lives, and to suffer no man and no
cause to escape the undying penalty which
history has the power to inflict on wrong.
[90]

The plea in extenuation of guilt and mitigation
[64]

of punishment is perpetual. At every
step we are met by arguments which go to
JUSTIFICATION OF THE PAST

excuse, to palliate, to confound right and
wrong, and reduce the just man to the
level of the reprobate. The men who plot
to baffle and resist us are, first of all,
those who made history what it has become.
They set up the principle that
only a foolish Conservative judges the
present time with the ideas of the Past;
that only a foolish Liberal judges the
Past with the ideas of the Present.
[91]

The mission of that school was to
make distant times, and especially the
middle ages, then most distant of all,
intelligible and acceptable to a society
issuing from the eighteenth century.
There were difficulties in the way; and
among others this, that, in the first
fervour of the Crusades, the men who
[65]

took the Cross, after receiving communion,
heartily devoted the day to the extermination
of Jews. To judge them by a
fixed standard, to call them sacrilegious
fanatics or furious hypocrites, was to
yield a gratuitous victory to Voltaire.
It became a rule of policy to praise the
spirit when you could not defend the deed.
So that we have no common code;
our moral notions are always fluid; and
you must consider the times, the class
from which men sprang, the surrounding
influences, the masters in their schools,
the preachers in their pulpits, the
movement they obscurely obeyed, and
so on, until responsibility is merged in
numbers, and not a culprit is left for
execution.
[92]
A murderer was no criminal
if he followed local custom, if neighbours
approved, if he was encouraged by official
[66]

advisers or prompted by just authority, if
he acted for the reason of state or the pure
love of religion, or if he sheltered himself
behind the complicity of the Law. The
depression of morality was flagrant; but
the motives were those which have
enabled us to contemplate with distressing
PHILOSOPHIES OF HISTORY

complacency the secret of unhallowed
lives. The code that is greatly modified
by time and place, will vary according to
the cause. The amnesty is an artifice that
enables us to make exceptions, to tamper
with weights and measures, to deal unequal
justice to friends and enemies.

It is associated with that philosophy
which Cato attributes to the gods. For
we have a theory which justifies Providence
by the event, and holds nothing so
deserving as success, to which there
can be no victory in a bad cause, prescription
[67]

and duration legitimate,
[93]
and
whatever exists is right and reasonable;
and as God manifests His will by
that which He tolerates, we must conform
to the divine decree by living to
shape the Future after the ratified image
of the Past.
[94]
Another theory, less confidently
urged, regards History as our
guide, as much by showing errors to evade
as examples to pursue. It is suspicious
of illusions in success, and, though there
may be hope of ultimate triumph for what
is true, if not by its own attraction, by the
gradual exhaustion of error, it admits no
corresponding promise for what is ethically
right. It deems the canonisation of the
historic Past more perilous than ignorance
or denial, because it would perpetuate the
reign of sin and acknowledge the sovereignty
of wrong, and conceives it the
[68]

part of real greatness to know how to
stand and fall alone, stemming, for a lifetime,
the contemporary flood.
[95]

Ranke relates, without adornment, that
William III. ordered the extirpation of a
Catholic clan, and scouts the faltering
DEBASING THE CURRENCY

excuse of his defenders. But when he
comes to the death and character of the
international deliverer, Glencoe is forgotten,
the imputation of murder drops, like
a thing unworthy of notice.
[96]
Johannes
Mueller, a great Swiss celebrity, writes
that the British Constitution occurred to
somebody, perhaps to Halifax. This artless
statement might not be approved
by rigid lawyers as a faithful and
felicitous indication of the manner of
that mysterious growth of ages, from
occult beginnings, that was never profaned
by the invading wit of man;
[97]
but
[69]

it is less grotesque than it appears. Lord
Halifax was the most original writer of
political tracts in the pamphleteering crowd
between Harrington and Bolingbroke; and
in the Exclusion struggle he produced
a scheme of limitations which, in substance,
if not in form, foreshadowed the position
of the monarchy in the later Hanoverian
reigns. Although Halifax did not believe
in the Plot,
[98]
he insisted that innocent
victims should be sacrificed to content the
multitude. Sir William Temple writes:—“We
only disagreed in one point, which
was the leaving some priests to the law
upon the accusation of being priests only,
as the House of Commons had desired;
which I thought wholly unjust. Upon this
point Lord Halifax and I had so sharp
a debate at Lord Sunderland's lodgings,
that he told me, if I would not concur in
[70]

points which were so necessary for the
people's satisfaction, he would tell everybody
I was a Papist. And upon his
affirming that the plot must be handled as
if it were true, whether it were so or no,
in those points that were so generally believed.”
In spite of this accusing passage
SINFULNESS OF HISTORY

Macaulay, who prefers Halifax to all the
statesmen of his age, praises him for his
mercy: “His dislike of extremes, and a
forgiving and compassionate temper which
seems to have been natural to him, preserved
him from all participation in the
worst crimes of his time.”

If, in our uncertainty, we must often err,
it may be sometimes better to risk excess in
rigour than in indulgence, for then at least
we do no injury by loss of principle. As
Bayle has said, it is more probable that the
secret motives of an indifferent action are
[71]

bad than good;
[99]
and this discouraging
conclusion does not depend upon theology,
for James Mozley supports the sceptic
from the other flank, with all the artillery
of Tractarian Oxford. “A Christian,” he
says, “is bound by his very creed to suspect
evil, and cannot release himself....
He sees it where others do not; his instinct
is divinely strengthened; his eye is supernaturally
keen; he has a spiritual insight,
and senses exercised to discern.... He
owns the doctrine of original sin; that doctrine
puts him necessarily on his guard
against appearances, sustains his apprehension
under perplexity, and prepares
him for recognising anywhere what he
knows to be everywhere.”
[100]
There is
a popular saying of Madame de Staël,
that we forgive whatever we really
understand. The paradox has been
[72]

judiciously pruned by her descendant,
the Duke de Broglie, in the words:
SOVEREIGNTY OF THE MORAL CODE

“Beware of too much explaining, lest we
end by too much excusing.”
[101]
History,
says Froude, does teach that right and
wrong are real distinctions. Opinions
alter, manners change, creeds rise and
fall, but the moral law is written on the
tablets of eternity.
[102]
And if there are
moments when we may resist the teaching
of Froude, we have seldom the chance of
resisting when he is supported by Mr.
Goldwin Smith: “A sound historical
morality will sanction strong measures in
evil times; selfish ambition, treachery,
murder, perjury, it will never sanction in
the worst of times, for these are the things
that make times evil.—Justice has been
justice, mercy has been mercy, honour
has been honour, good faith has been
[73]

good faith, truthfulness has been truthfulness
from the beginning.” The
doctrine that, as Sir Thomas Browne
says, morality is not ambulatory,
[103]
is expressed
as follows by Burke, who, when
true to himself, is the most intelligent of our
instructors: “My principles enable me to
form my judgment upon men and actions
in history, just as they do in common life;
and are not formed out of events and
characters, either present or past. History
is a preceptor of prudence, not of principles.
The principles of true politics are those
of morality enlarged; and I neither now
do, nor ever will admit of any other.”
[104]

Whatever a man's notions of these later
centuries are, such, in the main, the man
himself will be. Under the name of History,
they cover the articles of his philosophic,
his religious, and his political
[74]

creed.
[105]
They give his measure; they
denote his character: and, as praise is the
shipwreck of historians, his preferences
HISTORY AND CHARACTER

betray him more than his aversions.
Modern history touches us so nearly, it
is so deep a question of life and death,
that we are bound to find our own way
through it, and to owe our insight to
ourselves. The historians of former ages,
unapproachable for us in knowledge and
in talent, cannot be our limit. We have
the power to be more rigidly impersonal,
disinterested and just than they; and to
learn from undisguised and genuine records
to look with remorse upon the past,
and to the future with assured hope of
better things; bearing this in mind, that
if we lower our standard in history, we
cannot uphold it in Church or State.

NOTES

[1]
No political conclusions of any value for practice
can be arrived at by direct experience. All true
political science is, in one sense of the phrase,
a priori
,
being deduced from the tendencies of things, tendencies
known either through our general experience
of human nature, or as the result of an analysis of the
course of history, considered as a progressive evolution.—

Contemporary history is, in Dr. Arnold's opinion,
more important than either ancient or modern; and
in fact superior to it by all the superiority of the end
to the means.—

Il y a des savants qui raillent le sentiment religieux.
Ils ne savent pas que c'est à ce sentiment, et

de l'église, quand les lettrés n'avaient pas encore eu
l'idée de porter un regard critique sur les textes de

In our own history, above all, every step in advance
has been at the same time a step backwards.
It has often been shown how our latest constitution
is, amidst all external differences, essentially the same
as our earliest, how every struggle for right and freedom,
from the thirteenth century onwards, has simply
been a struggle for recovering something old.—

et que l'obéissance aveugle est la principale vertu des
chrétiens. La paresse des inférieurs et leur esprit
flatteur s'accommode souvent de cette vertu prétendue,
et l'orgueil de ceux qui commandent en est
toujours très content. De sorte qu'il se trouvera peut-être
des gens qui seront scandalisés que je fasse cet
honneur à la raison, de l'élever au-dessus de toutes les
puissances, et qui s'imagineront que je me révolte contre
les autorités légitimes à cause que je prends son parti et
que je soutiens que c'est à elle à décider et à regner.—

The greatest changes of which we have had

The real history of mankind is that of the slow

were of small consequence—the thoughts that were
developed are of infinite consequence.—

In the case of Protestantism, this constitutional

for a transitory scheme, whose breaking up is to make
room in due time for another and far more perfect
state of the Church.—The new order in which Protestantism
is to become thus complete cannot be
reached without the co-operation and help of
Romanism.—

routine, tandis que le fils représente et défend la
science progressive? En diminuant l'écart qui existait
entre l'influence des jeunes générations et celle de la

pas un principe purement négatif, un simple élément de
contrôle et de critique. Elle est le principe actif,
créateur organisateur par excellence. Elle est le
moteur et la règle, la source de toute vie, et le principe
de l'ordre. Elle est, en un mot, le nom que prend
la conscience souveraine, lorsque, se posant en face
du monde social et politique, elle émerge du moi pour

nerve or fibre of the mighty laws which govern the
moral world.—

The social body is no more liable to arbitrary
changes than the individual body.—A full perception
of the truth that society is not a mere aggregate, but
an organic growth, that it forms a whole the laws of
whose growth can be studied apart from those of the
individual atom, supplies the most characteristic postulate
of modern speculation.—

Sprache stete Fortbildung und Entwicklung, und auf

Political economy is not a science, in any strict

been practised all down the history of the human

Bonamy

a study is in harmony with the best intellectual
tendencies of our age, which is, more than anything
else, characterized by the universal supremacy of the
historical spirit. To such a degree has this spirit
permeated all our modes of thinking, that with respect
to every branch of knowledge, no less than with
respect to every institution and every form of human
activity, we almost instinctively ask, not merely what
is its existing condition, but what were its earliest
discoverable germs, and what has been the course
of its development.—

Ideen, bereichert die sie aus ihrem eigenen Schoosse
sobald noch nicht erzeugt haben würde. Weit die
fruchtbarste darunter war die aus der Naturwissenschaft
geschöpfte Idee des organischen Lebens, dieselbe auf
der die neueste Philosophie selbst beruht. Die seit zwei

Kann sich doch die Philosophie überhaupt und
insbesondere die Metaphysik ihrer eigenen geschichtlichen
Entwickelung nicht entschlagen, sondern hat
eine Geschichte der Philosophie als eigene und zwar
zugleich historische und spekulative Disziplin, in deren
geschichtlichen Entwickelungsphasen und geschichtlich
aufeinanderfolgenden Systemen der Philosophen
die neuere Spekulation seit Schelling and Hegel zugleich
die Philosophie selbst als ein die verschiedenen

verwechselt wird, starke Gefahren der Einseitigkeit, des
Dogmatismus und damit der Stagnation in sich.

this happened to be present. There was a meeting

Ireland, that there were some Tories to be brought
over hither, who were privately to murder Dr. Oates
and the said Bedloe. The doctor, whose zeal was
very hot, could never after this hear any man talk
against the plot, or against the witnesses, but he
thought he was one of these Tories, and called almost

I have now to exhibit a rare combination of good
qualities, and a steady perseverance in good conduct,

made him to be regarded by succeeding generations as
a model of public and private virtue.—The evidence
shows that upon this occasion he was not only under
the influence of the most vulgar credulity, but that
he violated the plainest rules of justice, and that
he really was the murderer of two innocent women.—Hale's

This is not an age for a man to follow the strict

men who will scorn to join concert with the public
voice when it is not well grounded.—

Cette proposition: L'homme est incomparablement
plus porté au mal qu'au bien, et il se fait dans
le monde incomparablement plus de mauvaises actions
que de bonnes—est aussi certaine qu'aucun principe de
métaphysique. Il est donc incomparablement plus
probable qu'une action faite par un homme, est
mauvaise, qu'il n'est probable qu'elle soit bonne.
Il est incomparablement plus probable que ces
secrets ressorts qui l'ont produite sont corrompus,
qu'il n'est probable qu'ils soient honnêtes.
Je vous avertis que je parle d'une action qui n'est
point mauvaise extérieurement.—

A Christian is bound by his very creed to suspect
evil, and cannot release himself.—His religion
has brought evil to light in a way in which it never
was before; it has shown its depth, subtlety, ubiquity;
and a revelation, full of mercy on the one hand, is
terrible in its exposure of the world's real state on the
other. The Gospel fastens the sense of evil upon the
mind; a Christian is enlightened, hardened, sharpened,
as to evil; he sees it where others do not.—

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License.  You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

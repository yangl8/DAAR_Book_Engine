INTRODUCTION

The romance of war in its most thrilling form is
exemplified in this narrative of the adventures of âThe
Worldâs Greatest Military Spies and Secret Service
Agents.â Much has been published upon the subject
of espionage, and the memoirs and secret histories of
the courts of Europe give us instances of men and
women who have gained favor and money, if not
honor and glory, by selling back-stairs gossip concerning
their fellow creatures; but the aim of the present
work has been rather to relate the big exploits of
those who faced great personal danger and risked
their lives for the sake of flag and country.

Each story is complete in itself, and yet forms a
link in the chain of narratives which illustrates the
startling and unexpected manner in which battles have
been lost and won through the shrewdness and the
courage of military spies at various times in different
countries of the world. All spies are not admirable.
Indeed, some whose deeds are herein related seem
despicable. The use of the word âspyâ in this series
is in its broadest, and usually its best, sense. In all
of the great wars of history there have been spies,
scouts, emissaries and others still with no very well
defined status, who have rendered invaluable service
to their governments. A spy is liable to death; a
viii

scout, if captured, has the rights of a prisoner of war,
but an emissary is rather political than military, and is
sent to influence secretly the opposition rather than to
bring information concerning the movements of troops.

There are spies and spies. Just where the line is to
be drawn must depend largely upon the personal view-point
of the reader. Some of those who have been engaged
in hazardous military exploits are looked upon
as among the worldâs greatest heroes; others who have
abused the hospitality of their entertainers in order
to betray them have earned never-ending obloquy.
Everything depends upon the circumstances and the
point of view. Human nature has been the same in all
ages. We are disposed to justify and glorify the military
spy who risks his life for our own country and our
own cause, and to condemn and abuse the one who is
enlisted in the service of the enemy.

Generally speaking, there is a natural repugnance to
the professional spy in times of war, who is regarded
as akin to the paid informer in times of peace. But
the tendency is to applaud the real soldier who is willing
to depart from the strict lines of military duty
in order to serve his country. Napoleon, who can
scarcely be called a scrupulous man, even by his most
ardent admirers, refused to bestow the medal of honor
on his chief spy. âMoney, as much as you like,â he
exclaimed, âbut the crossânever!â

At the time of the capture of Emilio Aguinaldo by
the late Brigadier-General Frederick Funston a question
arose regarding the ethics of the means employed
by some of the members of the troops under his command
ix

on that occasion. It arose in a lecture before the
law class at the University of the Philippines. Justice
Carson, of the Supreme Court, was asked to enlighten
the students on this point. Instead of doing so, he
wrote and asked General Funstonâs view of the matter.
The reply of the American soldier may be accepted as
the authorized military view of the question. General
Funston wrote:

âIn a nutshell, the legal status of all those engaged
in the expedition referred to was that of spies, and as
such they could not have claimed immunity from the
usual fate of spies. While we were not disguised for
the purpose of obtaining information, the fact that we
penetrated the enemyâs lines under false colors would
have justified treating us as such.

âHaving acknowledged that our status was that of
Spies, I wish to call attention to a popular, erroneous
belief that spies are violators of the laws of war simply
because they are spies and in disguise. It is safe to say
that there never has been a war in which both sides
did not use spies; in fact, the principal military nations
use them in time of peace. Spies are punished, not because
there is anything morally reprehensible in their
work, but because it is desired to make their occupations
so dangerous that it will be difficult to find men
to undertake the risks involved.

âThe status of the spy in our own history cannot
better be shown than in the fact that Nathan Hale, the
spy of our own Revolution, whose impressive statue
stands in New York and whose last words on the gallows
were: âMy chief regret is that I have but one
x

life to give for my country,â is one of the greatest of
our national heroes.

âWashington has been regarded always as one of
the most scrupulous of men, but he did not hesitate to
hold as a prisoner the British general Prescott, captured
by Colonel Barton of the Rhode Island militia
and a few men, all disguised as non-combatants, who
penetrated the British lines under false colors.

âAlthough the use of spies is not a violation of
the laws of war, there are certain acts that are recognized
as such and may be punished by death: The
violation of the flag of truce; breaking a truce; violation
of parole; the use of poison; killing of prisoners
of war to prevent their recapture, and hoisting the hospital
flag over a place not a hospital. But all these
imply moral obliquity, and I have never heard of any
one being rewarded or having a monument erected to
him for having been guilty of any one of them.

âThe Filipinos are about the last people in the world
who can question the ethics of entering the enemyâs
lines in disguise. As a veteran of the war you know
that, disguised as non-combatants, their officers and
soldiers are among us all the time, and that if we had
enforced the law strictly relative to spies we would
have been hanging men all the time.â

The halo of romance hovers in a special manner over
women spies, and it is interesting to note that the
United States furnishes the most conspicuous examples
of this class in the persons of Belle Boyd, the Confederate
girl who saved Stonewall Jackson; and Emma
Edmonds, the Union spy, whose adventures could
xi

scarcely be duplicated in the pages of fiction. The
story of a third American woman is related in this volumeâLydia
Darrah, the gentle and brave Quakeress
who saved Washingtonâs army from destruction. She
was not a spy in the accepted sense of the word, and
it would be impossible to imagine a greater contrast
than is presented between the colonial girl and the two
women of the Civil War, but the service she rendered
the young and struggling nation cannot be overestimated.

A book of this character would not be complete
without the stories of Nathan Hale and Major AndrÃ©,
the American and the Briton, each young and gallant,
and each giving up his life for his country. In a general
way, their exploits are familiar, yet it may be
found that a new light has been turned upon certain
phases of the sacrifices which they both so cheerfully
made for the causes they represented.

An effort has been made to confine this work to the
operations of military spies, but in possibly two instances
the rule has been relaxed in order to present
phases of that form of diplomacy which is so closely
allied with war as to be part of it. Most of the incidents
are interwoven with the history of the countries
to which they relate, and are part of the archives of the
State, War and Navy Departments of these nations.
Taken all in all, the pages of fiction contain few things
more fascinating or thrilling than these fact stories.

THE ALSATIAN SMUGGLER WHO HELPED
NAPOLEON TO CAPTURE THE
AUSTRIAN ARMY

This
is the story of a thrilling episode in the
life of a man who has been called the Prince
of Spies. His name was Charles Louis Schulmeister
and he played a most invaluable part in building
the fame of no less a person than Napoleon Bonaparte.
What the greatest military genius of his time
might have accomplished without the aid of his wonderfully
effective secret service system must be left to
the imagination. What he actually did with the assistance
of Charles Louis Schulmeister and his associates
is one of the most fascinating parts of the secret
archives of France and Austria.

First a word concerning the life and personality of
this famous military spy. He was a native of an
Alsatian villageâNew Freistell in the Grand Duchy
of Baden, on the right bank of the Rhine. He was
an adventurous boy and his early life was filled with
hair-raising escapades. It was the most natural thing
4

in the world for such a youth to develop into a smuggler
and for years he followed that calling to the dismay
of the authorities and to the advantage of his
personal fortunes.

Schulmeister was of medium build, brusque in his
manner and movements, smooth-faced and with two
ugly scars on his forehead, the result of bravery in
battle. He had blue eyes, clear, penetrating and unwavering.
He was quick to think and prompt to
execute; shrewd, smart and full of courage and resolution.
Also, Schulmeister was absolutely devoid of
the sense of fear.

In 1805 Napoleon was at Strassburg planning his
wonderful Austrian campaign. His camp at Boulogne
was marvelous and its size calculated to strike
terror into the heart of the enemy. But the Corsican
did not propose to move until he was fully informed
of the extent and character of the forces he would be
called upon to meet. He wanted a shrewd and tried
man in the camp of the enemy. In this emergency he
sent for General Savery, the head of the French
Secret Service, and informed him of his desire. The
officer saluted.

âSire, I have the very man you need for this
mission.â

Savery, who was not particularly noted for his
scrupulousness, had a score of fearless men at his beck
and call, and not the least of them was Charles Louis
Schulmeister. The Alsatian smuggler had been on
Saveryâs staff for years, and had performed delicate
missions with great success. The moment Napoleon
5

spoke Savery decided to employ Schulmeister for this
latest dangerous mission. He had the young Alsatian
brought to him and informed him of the Emperorâs
wishes.

âThe Emperor wishes to see you personally and at
once,â he said.

Schulmeister was skeptical. He rubbed his brawny
hand across the scars on his forehead:

âYou are having sport with me.â

âNot at all,â was the vehement rejoinder. âThe
Emperor wishes to see you on a matter of great importance.
Be prepared to meet him at any moment.â

The Alsatian sat down and awaited the summons,
but not without some trepidation. He recalled the
lawless career he had pursued, prior to his military
service, and he wondered if he was called to give an
account of his misdeeds. Yet the Great Man of
Destiny would scarcely waste his time on such secondary
and trivial matters. Possibly he had been
misrepresented to the Emperor. In that event he
would truly have reason to shake in his boots, for
Napoleon made short shrift of those whose loyalty was
not absolutely unquestioned.

But with that phase of the business Schulmeister
straightened out his shoulders and was filled with resolution.
He knew that he had been faithful to Napoleon
and France; whatever other defects there might
be in his characterâand they were many and seriousâdisloyalty
was not one of them. As to meeting the
great manâpshaw! that was but part of the dayâs
work.

6

âSchulmeister, come forward!â

This command from an officer awakened the young
Alsatian from his day dreams. He was being conducted
to the presence of the man whose name was
already reverberating around the world. He followed
closely on the heels of the messenger, wondering why
he had been summoned and how he should act.
Before he could map out any coherent line of conduct
he realized that he was in the headquarters of the
Emperor.

Schulmeister looked about him quickly and for the
moment was confused. The place was filled with staff
officers wearing glittering uniforms and talking in low
but animated tones. Which of these could be the
Emperor? He looked for the most impressive uniform
but was not enlightened. Presently his glance
fell upon a man short in stature, but well formed and
resolute in his manner. He was apart from the others
and restlessly paced up and down the narrow limits of
the apartment. He wore a long gray coat over a plain
uniform. He turned around unexpectedly and moved
out of the mass of gorgeously uniformed men. The
Alsatian recognized him at once.

It was Napoleon.

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE

At first the Emperorâs smooth face, firmly set jaw
and rigid mouth seemed to portend a storm. But as
his eyes rested on the young man he smiled charmingly
and engagingly. The glance that he shot at his visitor
was at once ardent and penetrating. He placed his
hand on Schulmeisterâs shoulder.

âYou are an Alsatian?â

7

âYes, sire.â

âYou look like a brave manâa man who will risk
his life for France.â

âWillingly,â was the quick response.

After that the Man of Destiny and the former
smuggler sat down and planned the scheme by which
the Emperor was to gain the information he desired
concerning the position, the extent and the prospective
movements of the enemy. Schulmeister, while not
particularly educated, was exceptionally quick witted.
It has been said that he was as âsharp as a steel trapâ
and that is the impression he made on the Emperor,
for Napoleon afterwards spoke glowingly of the spy
to General Savery, his aide-de-camp.

The result of the campaign that had been planned
was to have a marked effect upon the future of the
âLittle Corporal,â as the idolizing soldiers insisted
upon calling their chief. The Emperor accompanied
the spy to the door of his headquarters, and as he left
called after him:

âDonât fail me!â

Schulmeister hastened away and the thing that he
remembered most of all was the figure of the little man
in the long gray coat, waving his short arm and calling
out that message of warning and of confidence. Who
shall say that this day was not to mark the beginning
of the founding of the great Napoleonic empire?

Time is everything!

Napoleon had said this often and his faithful servitor
learned it by heart. He had a brief interview
with General Savery, and the next moment started on
8

his mission. The expected happenedâthe thing he
wished to happenâthe incident that was necessary in
order to set the little drama in motion.

He was arrested by the French police on the charge
of espionage and hustled by them to the frontier. It is
impossible, if not indiscreet, to admit too many persons
into oneâs confidence. The officers who had made the
arrest were ardent Frenchmen as well as faithful
policemen, and they did not treat the young Alsatian
any too tenderly. In fact, he received more cuffs and
kicks than he liked. But he took them all unresistingly
and even smiled when he was given a final push and
sent headlong into the camp of the Austrians.

They received him with open arms, and when he
told them a cock-and-bull story of his adventures in
the French camp, nothing would do but that he must
enter the Secret Service of the Austrian Army. Such
a valuable man was not to be lost.

The news of this was taken to the short man in the
long gray coat, and as he paced up and down amidst his
brilliantly uniformed officers he was heard to give vent
to a chuckleâthe sort of a chuckle one expects from a
man whose plans are working precisely as he wished.

In the meantime Schulmeister settled down to business
in earnest. He gained the acquaintance and then
the friendship of two very important men. One was
Captain Wend of the Austrian Secret Service, and the
other Lieutenant Bendel, aide-de-camp to General
Kienmayer. In this, as in all else, he had followed the
advice of his Corsican superior. With him, as with
the greater man, time was âeverything.â

9

A less audacious man would have hesitated about
approaching such officers as Wend and Bendel; a less
courageous man would have feared it, and a less imaginative
man would never have thought of it. But
Schulmeister had audacity, courage and imagination.
He unbosomed himself to these two men, he pointed
out the possibilities of the future and he painted
the glories and the rewards of the Napoleonic empire.

In less than twenty-four hours Captain Wend and
Lieutenant Bendel had become his allies, and thereafter
worked with him hand and glove.

The next necessary move was to obtain the confidence
of the higher Austrian officers and to find out
their plans. He was able to do this with the assistance
of Captain Wend and Lieutenant Bendel.

The Allies had a great body of soldiers in the field.
The chief figure was Field Marshal Baron Mack, who
had 90,000 splendidly equipped and well trained men
under his command. His army formed the right wing
of an enormous host, of which Archduke Charles with
140,000 men in northern Italy and Archduke John
with 50,000 more in the passes of the Tyrol were important
adjuncts.

General Mack was impressed with the great strength
of his troops and felt that he could easily overcome
Napoleon with the superiority of his numbers. Schulmeister
learned of this over-confidence and was all the
more anxious to reach the big man. Captain Wend
undertook to present the Alsatian to Mack. It proved
to be easy. The Austrian commander was not anxious
10

to move unless it was necessary, and when he
learned that there was a man in the vicinity who had
been in the camp of Napoleon he was eager to meet
him.

Schulmeister was bidden to come into his presence
and told to describe all that he had seen in the camp of
the âenemy.â He did so with a vividness of imagination
that would have done credit to Baron Munchausen.

For nearly an hour the medium-sized man with the
ugly scars and the sky-blue eyes sat there and poured
fiction into the ears of the great generalâthe man
decorated with many medals and filled with a sense of
his own importance. And Mack believed it all. At
the conclusion the Austrian turned to one of his subordinates.

âYou see; it is as I suspected. We must not move
from this place. We must watch and wait.â

So, on the strength of the informationâthe false
informationâsupplied by the Alsatian smuggler, the
great army dawdled away its time in idleness. That
is to say, it was really idle while making a pretense of
activity. General Mack moved his troops about aimlessly
in order to fool the enemy. That was his notion
of military strategy. But alas! for his expectations,
he was dealing with the master military strategist of
his timeâif not of all times.

Having deluded the Austrian commander and
obtained accurate data concerning his plans, Schulmeister
now made it his business to convey the information
to Napoleon. He was readily given leave to go
11

to the French camp, with instructions to get all the
facts possible as to its future movements.

He was in an enviable position. He had the passwords
of both armies and he made his way to the quarters
of the Emperor without any difficulty. As before,
he found the silent, mysterious figure in the long gray
coat, in the midst of his brilliantly attired staff.
Schulmeister almost ran into the presence of the âLittle
Corporal.â

âSire,â he said, âI have important news from the
front.â

Napoleon dismissed his officers, and sat down to
listen to the report of the spy. His penetrating eyes
seemed to pierce the soul of Schulmeister, but the
Alsatian bore the scrutiny without flinching. The
Emperor was satisfied. His determined look gave
way to one of his charming smiles.

âProceed,â said he.

Briefly, but without omitting any essential detail,
Schulmeister told the story of his adventures from the
time he had left the French camp until his return. At
intervals there was a quiet chuckle from the great soldier.
After he had concluded Napoleon propounded
a number of questions, all of which the spy was able to
answer clearly and satisfactorily. Then the short
man in the long coat arose and paced up and down for
some moments in silence. Presently he placed his
hand on Schulmeisterâs shoulder and said:

âYou have done your work well; return and keep
me posted on future developments.â

So Schulmeister made his way back to the Austrian
12

lines, while the Corsican proceeded with his plans for
enveloping the enemy. Mack was âbottled upâ but
not quite effectively. Time was needed to complete
the job and it was the Alsatian spy who was to make
that time possible. He hastened to the Austrian commander.
On this occasion he had no need of a go-between.
He had now the confidence of Mack and
the orders were that he should be permitted to go
and come as he pleased. The Baron was delighted
at the return of âhis spy,â as he called him.
Schulmeister told of his visit to the French camp
and gave what purported to be a rÃ©sumÃ© of Napoleonâs
plans.

The audacity of the man may be judged when it is
known that he gave considerable accurate information.
This was susceptible of confirmation, and the
fact that it was confirmed by some of Mackâs subordinates
only served to raise Schulmeister in the estimation
of the Austrian. And all the while Napoleon was
marshaling his forces in such a way that the escape
of the enemy seemed impossible.

Presently it began to dawn on General Mack that
something was wrong. Disquieting reports came
from the outer defenses. The Austrian became genuinely
disturbed. He sent for Schulmeister and questioned
him regarding the previous âinformationâ he
had brought him, but the Alsatian went through the
ordeal with flying colors. Indeed, he gave him one or
two additional facts which were so transparently correct
that it placed the spy above suspicion.

On the seventh of October the campaign of strategy
13

on both sides came to a close. With Napoleon
it had been a series of restless moves. With Mack
it had been a period of marking time, of doing
nothing.

Too late he realized his mistake. He hurried to the
north and found that the French troops were lined up
there in a solid phalanx; he turned to the south and
discovered that his retreat was cut off there. The east
and the west were in the same condition. The worst
part of it was that these various lines were slowly but
surely closing in on him. He could see now that the
Corsican commander had been engaged in a vast enveloping
campaign.

In a word, the great Napoleon had the Austrian
army in a grip of steel!

Mack presented a pitiable sight, sitting there with
his head between his hands, humiliated and remorsefulâthe
victim of his own inactivity and his too confiding
nature. The members of his staff gazed on the
spectacle silently and not entirely with pity. From a
distance Charles Louis Schulmeister also beheld the
defeated Austrian chief. He felt, like the others, that
it was all over but the shouting. The spy kept discreetly
away from the immediate vicinity of the general
and his staff. He knew very well that if his
duplicity were discovered that he would, even then, be
shot down like a dog. So he patiently awaited the
arrival of the French troops.

But unexpectedly the situation seemed to change.
It is an axiom of war that no chain is stronger than
its weakest link. Napoleon had completely surrounded
14

the Austrians and their allies, but there was
one section where the French line was very thinâtoo
thin indeed for French comfort. And while Mack
was moping over his hard fate some of his more energetic
officers had been making a closer investigation of
the situation.

The sound of a horseâs hoofs was heard and an
aide-de-camp galloped into the presence of Mack.

The officer alighted and saluted his chief.

âGeneral,â he cried, âthere is a weak link in the
French lines about two miles to the south, and with a
sufficient force we may be able to break through.â

This was as balm to the sorely afflicted pride of the
Austrian. He rose to the situation. Officers were
sent hither and thither and the soldiers massed for an
attack upon the point in question.

Napoleonâs spy looked upon these preparations with
a sinking heart. If they were carried out all of his
work might go for naught. That seemed like a glorious
French victory might be turned into simply a
drawn battle.

He had to think and think quickly!

As usual, he was equal to the occasion. Captain
Wend, of the Austrian Secret Service, and Lieutenant
Bendel were near him ready to share in the downfall
of the Austrian arms. They, too, realized that the
situation now hung upon a thread. They were completely
in Schulmeisterâs power, and were ready to do
anything he might command. He prepared a false
message purporting to be signed by one of the officers
of the outlying regiments. It said, in substance:

15

A revolution has broken out among the people of
Paris. Riots are going on in the streets. Napoleon
is hurrying home and the retreat of the French troops
is but a question of time.

This was conveyed to Mack by Captain Wend. It
filled the Austrian commander with amazement. It
was so unexpected and so surprising. His mind
worked slowly at best, and this intelligence seemed to
impair his thinking faculties still further. Schulmeister
was too shrewd to permit his enterprise to rest
on a single warning. He sent a second message by
another officer and finally he personally appeared before
the Austrian commander and told him things that
appeared like confirmation as strong as Holy Writ.
Mack was flooded with false messages.

As a consequence of this he called back his troops
and calmly sat down to await the retreat of the enemy.
That this inaction was largely due to his own indolence
cannot be doubted. But that it was chiefly prompted
by the cunning of the Alsatian spy is a matter of
history.

Before the sun went down that day the weak link in
the French lines had been strengthened effectively.
Napoleon had his troops under perfect control and the
ring of steel began to draw in closer and closer.
Mack, in his fancied security, waited for the retreat of
the enemy. Day by day Napoleon became more irresistible,
while the Austrian grew weaker.

Finally he awoke to discover that he had made a
second mistake, and a greater one than the first. The
16

Ulm campaign came to a sudden termination on the
18th of October, when Mack capitulated and surrendered
his entire force.

This campaign has few parallels in history. Not a
shot had been fired and many of the Austrians had not
even seen a French soldier!

While the world was ringing with the news of this
remarkable close to a remarkable campaign, General
Savery, who is also known to history as the Duke de
Rongo, accompanied Charles Louis Schulmeister on a
visit to the Emperor Napoleon. The great soldier
congratulated the Alsatian smuggler and loaded him
down with financial favors. Schulmeisterâs fortune
was madeâfrom a worldly standpoint.

He was given leave of absence, with the understanding
that he must remain subject to the Emperorâs call.
He had the right to go anywhere he chose and he
chose to go to his home in the Alsatian village of New
Freistell. The wife of his youth awaited him eagerly.
This curious man, who knew neither fear nor pity, had
one unexpected characteristic. He was passionately
fond of children. Although married several years
there was no prospect of little ones.

Schulmeister was not a man to be thwarted in his
desires. He went out into the village, found two
orphaned and homeless children and adopted them as
his own. Visitors to the little place on the right bank
of the Rhine tell of seeing the world-famous spy frolicking
on the lawn of his home with these children.
For the time being the man who had affected the destinies
17

of armies was subject to the whims and the
caprices of two little ones. He obeyed their slightest
commands as implicitly as he had the orders of Napoleon
Bonaparte.

Queer sight in this queerest of all possible worlds!

II

BELLE BOYD, THE CONFEDERATE GIRL
WHO SAVED STONEWALL JACKSON

That
brilliant writer, Gilbert Chesterton, in one
of his paradoxical essays said that a fact, if
looked at fiercely, may become an adventure.
It is certain that the most important facts in the
life of Belle Boyd, the Confederate spy, constitute
some of the most thrilling adventures in the great conflict
between the sectionsâthe Civil War in the
United States.

She was only a girl when the flag was fired on at
Sumter and her father and all the members of her family
immediately enlisted in the Confederate army.
When the Union troops took possession of Martinsburg,
Belle Boyd found herself unwillingly inside the
Federal lines. She had no formal commission from
any of the Southern officers, but circumstances and her
ardent nature made her an intense partisan of what was
to be âThe Lost Cause.â

During the occupation of Martinsburg, she shot a
Union soldier, who, she claimed, had insulted a Southern
woman. From that moment until the close of the
war she was actively engaged either as a spy, a scout
or an emissary of the Confederacy. On more than
one occasion she attracted the attention of Secretary
22

of War Stanton, and although she served a term in a
military prison, she seems to have been treated with
unusual leniency. After the war she escaped to England,
where she published her autobiography, bitterly
assailing the victorious North.

It was in Martinsburg that Belle Boyd first began
her work for the Confederacy. The Union officers
sometimes left their swords and pistols about the
houses which they occupied, and later were surprised
and mystified at the strange disappearance of the
weapons. They little thought that this mere slip of a
girl was the culprit. Still later they were amazed to
find that these same swords and pistols had found their
way into the hands of the enemy and were being used
against them.

But aside from this Belle Boyd made it her business
to pick up all the information that was possible concerning
the movements and the plans of the Union
forces. Every scrap of news she obtained was
promptly conveyed to General J.Â E.Â B. Stuart and
other Confederate officers.

BELLE BOYD

It was about the time of the battle of Bull Run that
the Confederate general in command fixed upon Front
Royal as a site for a military hospital. Belle Boyd
was one of the nurses and many a fevered brow felt
the touch of her cool hand and more than one stricken
soldier afterwards testified to the loving care he received
from this remarkable woman.

Later, Front Royal became the prize of the Union
army, and Belle Boyd naturally fell under suspicion.
Some remarks of her activities had already reached the
23

front, and the officers kept her under close scrutiny.
Fortunately, as she thought, she had been provided
with a pass which would permit her to leave the place.
Accordingly, the second day after the arrival of the
Unionists she packed her grip and prepared to leave
the town. As she came from the house she was halted
by a Union officer named Captain Bannon.

âIs this Miss Belle Boyd?â

âYes.â

âWell, I am the Assistant Provost Marshal, and
I regret to say that orders have been issued for
your detention. It is my duty to inform you that
you cannot proceed until your case has been investigated.â

This did not suit the young woman at all. She
opened her pocketbook and produced a bit of pasteboard.

âI have here a pass from General Shields. Surely
that should be sufficient to permit me to leave the
city.â

The young officer was perplexed. He did not care
to repudiate a pass issued by General Shields, and at
the same time did not wish to disobey the instructions
which he had received from his immediate chief.

âI hardly know what to do,â he said. âHowever,
I am going to Baltimore with a squad of men in the
morning. I will take you with me and when we get
there turn you over to General Dix.â

This program was carried out and the Confederate
spy was given a free trip to the monumental city,
which she did not want. She was compelled to remain
24

in Baltimore for some time, being kept constantly
under the closest supervision. Finally, however, General
Dix gave her permission to return to her home.
There was no direct evidence against her and it was
considered a waste of time and energy to keep her
under guard. She was escorted to the boundaries of
her old home by two Union soldiers. It was twilight
when she arrived at the Shenandoah River. The
effects of the war were to be seen on every side. The
bridges had been destroyed, and they only managed to
cross the river by means of a temporary ferry boat that
had been pressed into service.

When she reached her home she found that it had
been appropriated as a headquarters by General Shields
and the members of his staff. He treated her courteously
and said that no harm would befall her if she
was discreet and attended to her own business. She
was told that a small house adjoining the family dwelling
had been set aside for her use, and that the soldiers
would be given orders not to molest her in any
way.

But the young daughter of the Confederacy kept her
eyes and ears open and the night before the departure
of General Shields, who was to give battle to General
Jackson, she learned that a council of war was to be
held in the drawing-room of the Boyd home. Just
over this apartment was a bedroom containing a large
closet. On the night of the council she managed to
make her way to this room and slipped into the closet.
A hole had been bored through the floor, whether by
design or otherwise she was unable to tell. However,
25

she immediately determined to take advantage of what
she considered a providential situation.

When the council assembled the girl got down on
her hands and knees in the bottom of the closet and
placed her ear near the hole in the floor. To her great
satisfaction she found that she could distinctly hear
all of the conversation. The conference between the
Union officers lasted for hours, but she remained motionless
and silent until it had been concluded. When
the scraping movement of the chairs on the floor below
was heard she knew that everything was over so came
out of her place of concealment. She was tired and
her limbs were so stiff from remaining in that cramped
position so long that it was all she could do to move.
But she was full of grit and determination and as soon
as the coast was clear she hurried across the courtyard
and made the best of her way to her own room in the
little house and wrote down in cipherâa cipher of
her ownâeverything of importance that she had
overheard.

After that it was but a matter of a few minutes to decide
on her course of action. She knew that it would
be extremely dangerous to call a servant or to do anything
that might arouse the officers, who had by this
time gone to bed, so she went to the stables and saddled
a horse herself, and galloped away in the direction of
the mountains. The moon was shining when she
started on this wild ride. She had in her possession
passes which she had obtained from time to time for
Confederate soldiers who were returning south. Without
them it would have been impossible for her to have
26

accomplished her purpose. Before she had gone a
half mile she was halted by a Federal sentry. He
grabbed the bridle of her horse and cried out:

âWhere are you going?â

âI am going to visit a sick friend,â was the ready
response.

âYou canât do it,â he cried. âYou ought to know
that you canât leave this place without a pass.â

âBut I have one,â she said, with an engaging smile,
and drew out the piece of pasteboard.

The guard looked at it dubiously, but it was in
proper form and contained the necessary signature
and he grudgingly permitted her to continue on her
journey.

Twice again she was halted by sentinels and each
time she told the same story and underwent the same
experience. Once clear of the chain of sentries she
whipped her horse and hurried ahead for a distance of
fifteen miles. At that time the animal was in a perfect
lather and when she pulled up in front of the
frame house which was the dwelling place of her
friends the horse was panting and trembling from the
unusual exertion. She leaped from the animalâs back
and going to the door rapped on it with the butt end of
her riding whip. There was no reply, so she hammered
harder than ever. Presently a window in the
second story was cautiously opened and a head poked
out and a voice called:

âWhoâs there?â

âBelle Boyd, and I have important intelligence to
give to Colonel Ashby.â

27

âMy dear Belle!â shrieked the voice from the window.
âWhere in the world did you come from and
how did you get here?â

âOh, I forced the sentries,â was the reply, in a
matter of fact voice.

Within sixty seconds the girl was in the house and
receiving refreshments and telling her strange story to
her wondering friend. The horse in the meantime
was taken to the stable by a negro and carefully
groomed and fed. Only after these important details
had been attended to was the girl permitted to tell her
story.

âI must see Colonel Ashby,â she said in conclusion,
âand if you can tell me where to find him I will go at
once.â

She was informed that the Confederate officer and
his party were in the woods about a half mile distant
from the place in which they were sitting. Just as the
girl was ready to go the front door was thrown open
and Colonel Ashby stood before her. He looked at
her as if she were a ghost and then finally burst forth
in amazement:

âMy God, Miss Belle, is that you? Where did you
come from? Did you drop from the clouds?â

âNo,â she said smilingly, âI didnât. I came on
horseback and I have some very important information.â

Whereupon she related the details of the council
that had taken place in the Boyd home, and then told
the story of her mad ride through the night. She
concluded by handing him the cipher, which he said
28

would be communicated to his superior officers at
once.

After that she insisted on mounting her horse and
returning home again. It was more than two hoursâ
ride, during which time she ran the blockade of the
sleeping sentries with comparative success. Just at
dawn when she was in sight of her home one of the
sentries she was passing called out:

âHalt or Iâll shoot!â

But she did not halt. On the contrary she whipped
her horse until it fairly leaped through the air. She
felt that the man was leveling his gun in her direction.
She lay flat on her horseâs back with her arms around
his neck, and this was done in the very nick of time,
for at that same moment a hot bullet came singing
past her ears. That was the only serious interruption.
In a few minutes she had reached the grounds
surrounding the Boyd home. Fortunately no one
was in sight. She hurried into the house and
went to bed in her auntâs room just at the break
of dawn.

Two days later General Shields marched south with
the idea of laying a trap to catch General Jackson.
Once again the fearless girl determined to carry the
information she possessed to her Confederate friends.
Major Tyndale, at that time Provost Marshal, gave
Belle Boyd and her cousin a pass to Winchester. Once
there a gentleman of standing in the community called
on her and handing her a package, said:

âMiss Belle, I am going to ask you to take these
letters, and send them through the lines to the Confederate
29

army. One of them is of supreme importance
and I beseech you to try and get it safely to General
Jackson.â

After the exercise of considerable ingenuity she
managed to get a pass to Front Royal. To add to the
romantic feature of the business a young Union officer,
who admired the girl, offered to escort her to her destination.
They went in a carriage, but before starting
she made it a point to conceal the Jackson letter inside
her dress. The other letters, which were of comparatively
small importance, she handed to the Union officer
with the remark that she would take them from him
when they reached Front Royal. On the way, as she
feared, they were stopped by a sentinel. The Union
admirer of the Confederate spy explained that they
had a pass which would permit them to proceed on their
way, but the zealous sentinel insisted on searching them
and was highly indignant when he discovered the compromising
letters in the hands of the young man. He
insisted upon confiscating them, but in the excitement
forgot all about the girl, and she was permitted to go
unmolested, carrying with her the precious letter
intended for General Jackson.

Afterwards she laughingly expressed contrition for
having involved an ardent admirer in such a serious
plight, but excused herself on the ground that all was
fair in war as well as in love. Fortunately, the young
man, who was a perfectly loyal Northern soldier, was
given the credit of having discovered the papers, which
were valuable to his superior officers. Thus do we
sometimes make a virtue of necessity.

30

After Belle Boyd had been in Front Royal for several
days she learned that the Confederates were coming
to that place, but she also discovered that General
Banks was at Strasbourg with 4,000 men; that White
was at Harperâs Ferry; Shields and Geary a short distance
away, and FrÃ©mont below the valley. At a spot
which was the vital point all of the separate divisions
were expected to meet and coÃ¶perate in the destruction
of General Jackson. She realized that the Confederates
were in a most critical situation and that
unless the officers in command were aware of the facts
they might rush into a trap which meant possible
annihilation.

With characteristic promptness she decided on her
plan of action. She rushed out to warn the approaching
Confederates. On that occasion she wore a dark
blue dress with a fancy white apron over it which made
her a shining mark for bullets. The Federal pickets
fired at her but missed and a shell burst near her at
one time, but she threw herself flat on the ground and
thus escaped what seemed to be sure death. Presently
she came within sight of the approaching Confederates
and waved her bonnet as a signal.

Major Harry Douglass, whom she knew, galloped
up and received from her the information, which he
immediately transmitted to General Jackson. The
result of all this was a rout of the Union forces.

It was in this battle of Bull Run which followed
soon afterwards that General Bee, as he rallied his
men, shouted:

âThereâs Jackson standing like a stonewall!â

31

From that time, as has been aptly said, the name he
received in a baptism of fire displaced that which he
had received in a baptism of water.

The number of Union men engaged in the battle of
Bull Run was about 18,000, and the number of Confederates
somewhat greater.

Soon after the engagement the young woman
received the following letter, which she prized until
the hour of her death.

Miss Belle Boyd
:

I thank you for myself and for the army, for the
immense service you have rendered your country
to-day.

Hastily, I am your friend,

T.Â J. Jackson, C.Â S.Â A.

Shortly before the close of the war Belle Boyd was
captured and imprisoned. She escaped and made her
way to England. In London she attracted the attention
of George Augustus Sala, the famous writer.
She had been married in the meantime and her husband,
Lieutenant Hardage of the Confederate army,
was among those taken prisoner by the Union forces.

While abroad she became financially embarrassed;
indeed, at one time she was reduced to actual want. A
stranger in a strange land, sick in mind and body, she
was in a pitiable condition. Mr. Sala wrote a letter
to the
London Times
explaining her sad state and
roundly abusing the United States Government which
had, he said, not only imprisoned her husband but was
also âbarbarous enough to place him in irons.â

32

British sympathies were very strongly with the
South at that time, and as a result of this plea provision
was made for the immediate wants of the
famous spy. After the war she disappeared from the
public gaze, and some years later died in comparative
obscurity.

III

THE INDIAN SCOUT WHO WAS THE
HERO OF KING PHILIPâS WAR

It
is a curious fact that Job Kattenanit, one of the
Praying Indians of Deer Island, in Boston Harbor,
should have emerged from King Philipâs war
with more glory than any other man, either white or
red, who participated in that bloody contest.

Like the historic Biblical character from whom he
received his name, Job was a sorely afflicted man. He
was among the first group of Indians in that section
of the United States to accept the Christian religion,
and it was this fact, and in order to distinguish them
from the other red men, that Kattenanit and his companions
received the designation of the Praying
Indians.

It is regrettable to record, however, that the excesses
of some of the other natives had caused an indiscriminate
hatred of the Indians throughout New England.
They were regarded as wild beasts who should be shot
and killed without mercy. It was while this feeling
was at its height that Job Kattenanit and eleven of his
companions were arrested on a charge of being concerned
in the murder of seven white men. They were
captured in the town of Lancaster and brought to
Boston, tied âneck and neck,â as the practice was in
36

those primitive days. The evidence against them was
of the flimsiest character, and it was only through the
efforts of Captain John Gookin, a magistrate who felt
a special interest in the Indians, that their lives were
spared and they were condemned to imprisonment on
Deer Island.

In the meantime King Philip, the Indian chieftain,
was spreading terror among the white people. He was
jealous of their gradual encroachment upon what he
conceived to be his domain and he planned to destroy
them. He was a man of sagacity, although said to be
wanting in physical courage, and he gradually combined
all of the Indian tribes into one strong confederation
and waited for a chance to strike the decisive
blow.

It came at Swansea on Sunday, July 4, 1675. The
settlers were going to church when the Indians suddenly
burst upon them. But these pioneers were both
pious and prepared, and taking up arms they routed
their assailants. Philip and his warriors then hunted
the settlers in the Connecticut valley, burning down
their homes and subjecting the people to the most
atrocious forms of cruelty. In the spring the war
broke out anew along a frontier of three hundred
miles and to within twenty miles of Boston. The
Indians had remained quiet for a long time after the
initial outbreakâso quiet that the whites were
thoroughly alarmed. They knew the ruthless nature
of their foes and they feared the consequences to
the women and children if they should be taken
unawares.

37

It was at this critical stage of affairs that Major
Gookinâhe had been promotedâbethought himself
of the Praying Indians on Deer Island. It was absolutely
necessary to know something of the plans of
King Philip and his bloodthirsty redskins. If a white
man went into their camp he was certain to be scalped
and tortured. If an Indian could be induced to act as
a spy he might save the whites from a wholesale massacre.

The eloquent Major visited Deer Island and presented
these facts to the prisoners and called for volunteers.
He said that a service of this kind would
not only secure the release of the Praying Indians, but
would win for them the lasting friendship of the white
people.

âI go,â said one handsome brave, rising and lifting
his hand solemnly in mid-air. âI go, not for reward,
but to save the palefaces from death.â

The Indian was Job Kattenanit. He was tall and
perfectly erect, with piercing black eyes and a grave,
almost sorrowful countenance. There was a suggestion
of nobility in his bearing. In short, he might
well have passed for the original of Deerfoot, so vividly
pictured by James Fenimore Cooper.

Major Gookin recognized him at once. He knew
the Indians personally, and he had a special friendship
for this straight shouldered chap. He rushed over and
gripped him by the hand.

âJob,â he exclaimed, âthe white people shall know
of this and in time it will help your people.â

A mist passed before the bright eyes of the Indian,
38

and he gave a gesture as if to sweep the suggestion
aside.

âWhite man cruel to Indian,â he rejoined, âbut the
red man must return good for evil.â

As they were about to leave another Indian rose in
his place and said:

âMe go, tooâme go with Job.â

This was James Quannapohit, a native in whom
Major Gookin also had implicit confidence. After
deliberation he decided to accept the services of both
volunteers. They were taken aside and given careful
directions.

That night Job and James were brought secretly
from Deer Island and set freeâaccording to arrangement.
In order to avoid difficulties they had been
first escorted beyond the British lines.

From that point they journeyed alone and on foot.
It was a long walk, and when they reached their destination
they were footsore, hungry and almost in
rags. It was as they wished. They bore the appearance
of fugitives, of escaped prisoners. It was daybreak
when they arrived in the camp of the Nipmuck
Indians. They threw themselves on their faces and
begged for food and drink. The amazed redskins
who surrounded them wanted to know who they were
and what they were doing in the camp of the Nipmuck
Indians. Job, who acted as spokesman, insisted upon
refreshments and said he would tell his story to some
one in authority. After their wants had been satisfied
they were escorted to Mantampe, a chief Sachem
of the tribe.

39

âWhat you do here?â he demanded.

âWe have escaped from the clutches of the white
man,â replied Job in his native tongue, âand we came
to you for protection. The white man of Lancaster
came and took the red man prisoner. He charged us
with murdering his squaws and he gave us no chance
to defend ourselves.â

âTell me more,â said the chief Sachem, deeply interested.

Job did as he was requested and he was able to do so
all the more eloquently because he was giving an
account of some things that had actually occurred to
the Praying Indians. He said they had been accused
by David, a fellow savage, of being concerned in the
murder of the whites. But he added that the manner
in which David was forced to make this charge robbed
it of all value. He related how Colonel Mosely and a
scouting party captured David and tied him to a tree;
how with six muskets pointed at his head he was told
to confess or die. To save his life he named eleven
men he understood were present at the murder, though
he himself was not there, and knew nothing about it.
The men were put on trial, and so great and indiscriminate
was the popular feeling against the natives that
several of them were condemned.

âBut you are alive,â grinned the Sachem.

Job admitted the soft impeachment and explained
how he and his companions had been imprisoned on
Deer Island. He said that he and James Quannapohit
had managed to escape, but slyly enough neglected to
tell the Sachem that the escape had been arranged by
40

their English friends. He concluded by saying that
they had come to the camp of the Nipmuck Indians to
get the lay of the land, âso that they might advise the
friends they had left if it would be possible for them
also to escape.â

The Sachem accepted the story of Job and his companion
and they were given the liberty of the camp.
The two Praying Indians kept their eyes and ears open
and learned much. Mantampe was undoubtedly in
command of a large force. Job met many of the
Indians, who were, as a rule, able fighting men,
straight as arrows, very tall and active.

Three squaws who were in the camp interested and
amused the spies. One was a very proud dame. She
spent the best part of each day in dressing herself in
all the colors of the rainbow; she powdered her hair
and painted her face, wore numberless necklaces, had
jewels in her hair and bracelets on her wrists. When
she finished her toilet she sat down and spent the
remainder of the day in making girdles of wampum
and beads.

James Quannapohit found great favor in the eyes
of Mantampe. He made him share his tent with
him and insisted upon his repeating the story of his
escape from Deer Island. During the course of these
talks James learned that the Nipmuck Indians contemplated
a raid on the white settlers. They proposed to
burn Lancaster and then attack other towns. The
method of the raid was not made clear. One morning
Mantampe called James before him.

âSon,â he said in substance, âI am about to take a
41

journey for the purpose of visiting the big chief, King
Philip. If all goes well I may take you with me.â

This alarmed James. He dreaded the idea of going
further into the Indian country, perhaps to a point
where it would be impossible for him to make his escape.
Besides that he had a good reason for wishing
to avoid a meeting with the king. He had once fought
against Philip at Mount Hope. He had taken a conspicuous
part in the battle and he knew that if the
King recognized him he would be shot.

The next morning he arose before any one was stirring,
and left the camp. He urged Job to go along
with him but the other spy refused to do so.

âBut you will be killed,â urged James, âwhen they
discover my absence. They will at once suspect that
you are a spy, and that means death.â

Job shook his head.

âYou go,â he said. âI donât blame you for that.
But I am going to stay for a while. It may mean life
or death, but I am willing to take my chances.â

Nothing that James could say would shake the
determination of Job. So the younger Indian started
on the return journey to Boston alone. There had
been severe storms and the snow lay deep on the
ground. It was necessary for the Indian to wear
heavy snowshoes and this made traveling all the more
difficult.

When the Indian spy reached Boston he had a tale
of unparalleled hardships to relate to his white friends.
But more important than that was his story of the plans
of the Indians against the settlers in and around Lancaster.
42

He was highly praised for the effective work
he had done and was showered with attentions by the
white men and their families. For the first time since
the beginning of what is popularly known as King
Philipâs war an Indian was treated as though he were
a human being.

Indeed, it is no exaggeration to state that the exploit
of the two Indians did more to reinstate the redskins
in the good graces of the whites than anything that
had occurred in years.

But curiously enough the settlers did little or nothing
to protect themselves against the expected attack. The
very warning which should have put them on their
guard seemed to lull them into a false sense of security.
There were two reasons for this. The first one was
that the suspected danger was comparatively remoteâa
matter of weeks in fact. Another and more important
one was the desire to get further and fuller
information from the other Indian scout. Job was the
shrewder and more capable of the two messengers. It
was just possible that the abrupt departure of James
might arouse the suspicion of the savages and cause
them to entirely revise their plans. James was closely
questioned concerning his companion.

âWhy didnât he come back with you?â he was
asked.

James shrugged his shoulders and threw out his
hands in a gesture of hopelessness.

âHe very stubborn man. Have his own way.
No listen to poor James.â

âDo you think he intends to come back?â

43

At this suggestion of possible disloyalty on the part
of his friend the Indian became very indignant. He
was so angry that he found it impossible to express
himself coherently. But his manner, if not his words,
perfectly satisfied the questioner of the perfect good
faith of Job. As a matter of fact it was never
seriously doubted and the white man who propounded
the query felt ashamed at having put the unworthy
suspicion into words.

In the meantime Job found himself in an embarrassing
and really dangerous situation. With the flight
of James the savages, for the first time, became skeptical
concerning the motives of the two visitors. The
chief Sachem sent for Job and put him through a
severe cross-examination. But Job was shrewd and
told them a cock-and-bull story that satisfied their
curiosity. As a result of this he was treated with even
more consideration than when he first arrived in camp.
He was fearful lest the Sachem should want him to
accompany him on the proposed visit to King Philip.
He knew that to go before the big Chief would be
taking his life in his hands. Finally, to his great joy,
the Sachem decided that he should not go on the trip.

The next three days were days of great anxiety to
the spy. He knew that the emissary to the King would
bring final plans for the attack on the whites and he
was fearful lest anything should happen to deprive
him of this much needed information. So he exerted
himself to the utmost in order to keep the good will of
the savages. As a result of this they virtually took
him to their bosoms. In speaking of this afterwards
44

he said that he felt no compunctions of conscience.
He did not feel that he was betraying them but rather
that he was engaged in an honest attempt to save
human life.

He took part in their amusements, which helped to
while away the time. One of the most popular of the
games was called âhunt the button,â a diversion somewhat
akin to that which is enjoyed by children the
world over. This was played at night when the natives,
in paint and buckskin, seated themselves around
a tepee, with the fire blazing bright in their faces, as
they swung their hands in time with a rhythmic chant.
This was indulged in by both sexes. Also they played
the game of âdeer-foot.â In this a number of cylindrical
bones, usually taken from the foot of the deer,
and perforated with several holes around their sides,
were strung on a cord, which had at one end several
strands of beads and at the other a long needle. The
object was to toss the string, with the beads upon it,
in such a way as to catch in the point of the needle,
which was retained in the hand, any designated one of
the bones or bead strands.

KING PHILIP, OR METACOMET.

But presently the Sachem returned from his visit to
the King and from the air of activity which prevailed
Job realized that something important was on hand. It
did not take him long to find out that that something
was war. Clubs that were armed with jagged teeth of
stone were brought from their hiding places and sharpened.
Javelins, lances and arrows became very much
in evidence. The arrows were most numerous. They
were made of hard wood and with a feather from the
45

eagle. These various weapons were not unknown to
Job, of course, but his own tribe was composed of
more peace-loving Indians and they were not in the
habit of using the more destructive weapons.

Finally one night the Sachem gathered the most important
men of the tribe about him and outlined the
plans of King Philip. Job, who was still in the confidence
of the savages, was permitted to hear all that
was said. The proposal was shocking, even to a redskin.
The intention was to destroy the whites at one
blow, if that were possible. The day and the hour at
which the descent was to be made upon Lancaster was
fixed and the method of attack outlined. This was
news indeed, and vastly more important than that
which had been carried to Boston by James.

Job Kattenanit knew that the hour had come to act.
With haste he would have time to warn the threatened
settlers, but with not a minute to spare. Creeping
away, he made for the edge of the camp. Fortunately
most of the Indiansâaside from those who were attending
the council of warâwere asleep. He passed
one sentinel unobserved and gained the fringe of the
encampment in safety. The road to Boston was familiar
to him and he counted on reaching there by dusk
on the evening of February 8th.

But just as he struck the main road leading to his
destination there was a cry of anger and dismay from
the Nipmuck camp.

His flight had been discovered.

Instead of halting he redoubled his speed. From
time to time he heard savage cries and he knew that
46

he was being pursued. The thought of giving up
never once entered his mind. It was too late to retreat
now. The Nipmuck Indians had been credulous
enough, but it would be impossible to deceive them any
longer. Job was in fine physical condition and he ran
with the swiftness of a deer. But his enemies were
equally fleet-footed and it seemed only a question of
time when he would be overtaken. Nearer and nearer
came the footsteps in the rear. He felt that there
must be a number of Indians in the party, but evidently
they did not have time to give a general alarm.

Just when he was congratulating himself on the
possibility of outrunning his pursuers an arrow
whizzed past his head. This was a new danger and
one that he had not anticipated. He paused for a second
and turned to look at the men who were after him.
Instantly a well-directed arrow struck him in the chest
within an inch of the region of the heart.

A heavy blanket covered the fleeing redskin, and
with that momentary pause and turn the arrow had
penetrated the covering. But, as by a miracle, it went
no further. The Praying Indian wore a metal charm
on his breast, suspended by a string fastened about his
neck. That saved his life.

In that trying moment the shrewd Indian made his
resolution. To pull the arrow out and run ahead
again only meant postponing the inevitable. Instead
of that, he paused motionless for a second, then
swayed to and fro, and fell flat on his back.

Everything depended upon the success of this ruse.
It was, perhaps, half a minute before the Nipmuck
47

Indians came up, and when they did they regarded the
motionless body with something like awe. Job suppressed
his breathing as much as possible. Two of
the pursuers engaged in an animated conversation, and
finally turning, retraced their steps, leaving the spy for
dead.

He lay there perfectly quiet until he was sure they
were out of sight. Then he jumped up and resumed
his interrupted flight. The story of that journey
through a wilderness in the most inclement season of
the year should rank with the classics of adventure.
But only the savage himself knew what he was compelled
to undergo, and he never spoke of it afterwards.

He arrived at Major Gookinâs house late on the
night of February 9th. His feet were bruised and
bleeding from the long trip and he was faint from
weakness on account of exposure and want of food.
All of the inmates at the Gookin dwelling were asleep
and Job had to rap repeatedly on the door to awaken
them. Presently the Major came downstairs and the
meeting between the twoâwhite man and the redâwas
most affecting.

The tidings he brought were startling. It was evident
that it would only be a question of hours before
the settlers were attacked. Major Gookin did not
return to his bed that night. He dispatched messengers
to all of the surrounding towns. In an incredibly
short time troops were marching from everywhere to
the aid of the threatened town. Captain Wadsworth,
at Marlborough, received the news at daybreak and
48

started for Lancaster at once. Others did the same
thing.

The savages came over four hundred strong. Re-enforcements
added to this number. The white men
were not so numerous, but they fought with a courage
born of desperation. The town was partially destroyed
by fire and a few of the people taken prisoners
by the Indians. Had it not been for the warning of
Job Kattenanit there would have been a wholesale massacre
and Lancaster would have been left in ashes.

That was the beginning of the end. Driven to
drastic measures by the atrocities of the savages, the
settlers hunted down the Indians like wild beasts.
King Philip was driven from one hiding place to another,
going finally to his old home on Mount Hope,
Rhode Island, where he was shot by a faithless Indian,
August 12, 1676.

But Job Kattenanit, the Praying Indian, did more
than any white man to break up the reign of terror
caused by the savages, and even though history fails
to mention the fact, he was the real hero of King
Philipâs War.

IV

HOW THE SUICIDE OF A STAFF OFFICER
ONCE AVERTED WAR BETWEEN
AUSTRIA AND RUSSIA

Could
the preservation of the life of an officer
of the Austrian army on May 26, 1913,
have prevented the devastating war in Europe
that followed? And if the same man had lived
would it have precipitated a war at that time between
Austria and Russia?

These questions may remain unanswered to the end
of time, but there are students of history who do not
hesitate to give an affirmative reply to each of the
momentous queries.

The story of Colonel Albert Riddleâthat is near
enough to his real name to make it clear to those who
were within the inner circle and far enough away to
protect the feelings of his descendants who are still
livingâis one of the strangest in history. In its way
it takes its place with the Mystery of the Man in the
Iron Mask, although in the present case there was
never any question of the identity of the victim or of
the fact of his death.

Colonel Riddle was connected with the general staff
of the Eighth Army Corps. He was one of the
favorites of the Austrian Court. He was young,
52

handsome, attractive and with a dash and go about
him that made him a general favorite. He had won
an enviable record for bravery in battle, and was considered
an efficient officer in every sense of the term.

Presently the time came when it was desirable to
learn something concerning the secrets of the Russian
army plans. Austria, like all other great countries in
Europe, had any number of spies, but very few of
them were available for the character of work which
would be necessary in order to learn the plans of the
higher military officers of the Russian Empire. It
was in this emergency that Colonel Riddle was called
upon. He had a young soldierâs love of adventure
and he eagerly volunteered for the delicate and difficult
task. He was well supplied with money and authority
and eventually he went to St. Petersburg, where he
posed as a sort of military attachÃ© of the Austrian
embassy. The social side of life in St. Petersburg
attracted him immensely and while he devoted part of
his time to the work for which he had been assigned,
he nevertheless found numerous opportunities for satisfying
his love for the pleasant things of life.

Indeed, so genial did he find his surroundings, that
he had little or no desire to return home. He became
very popular with the ladies of the Russian Court, and
participated in many of the social events for which
that capital was noted.

But everything has its end, and finally the day came
when it was deemed necessary for him to return to
Vienna. He reached Austria in due time and made a
comprehensive report of his discoveries, a report that
53

was considered acceptable by the higher officers of the
Austrian army. After that he retired to his home in
Prague, Bohemia. He had many friends there and
indulged in what was regarded as a well earned rest.
His activitiesâhis military activitiesâwere suspended
for the time being, and this high grade spy
enjoyed life with more zest than is granted to the
ordinary or commonplace person.

But suddenly and as unexpectedly as a bolt from
the blue sky came the report that Colonel Riddle was
suspected of treason to his country.

He was summoned to Vienna to defend himself
from the charges. Now whether they were true or
not never has been and never will be definitely determined.
At all events the military and social circles
of the gayest capital in the world were filled with
stories which were not creditable to the fascinating and
really popular colonel. These stories, it may be stated
with surety, lost nothing in the telling, and as they
went from mouth to mouth they assumed proportions
which represented Riddle as being one of the most
marvelous deceivers of his time.

In the meanwhile the talk took on a new twist. It
was contended that if Colonel Riddle lived to be prosecuted
for treason the revelations at his trial would
make it impossible for Austria to maintain friendly
relations with Russia. The gossip said more than
that; it said that not only relations with Russia would
be broken, but that the bonds between Austria and one
of her fully trusted allies would be severely strained.
As a matter of fact, there is no telling to what extent
54

Germany and Austria might have found reason to suspect
each other had Colonel Riddle gone on the stand
and made the revelations which would have been
necessary in order for him to defend himself on the
charge of treason. He was accused by unknown accusers
of not only giving military secrets of Austria
and Germany to Russia, but also of having betrayed
to Russia the Russian officers who were selling Russiaâs
military secrets to Austria and Germany. Those
who were acquainted with the man were vehement in
denying his guilt of any such double faced dealings.
At all events, one of the secrets of this talk was that
Austria and Germany very materially revised their
plans for mobilizing their forces along the Russian
frontier.

In the meantime, while Colonel Riddle was in Vienna
preparing for the court-martial, the Government
had its agents in Bohemia collecting evidence to be
used against the accused man. Two of the secret
service men who were in Prague burst into his room
for the purpose of securing any information that
might be obtained there. At first it looked as if they
were to have their labors for their pains. Nothing
out of the ordinary was found. It was a sort of
apartment that might be expected to belong to a comparatively
wealthy and popular young man. There
were trophies from all parts of the world; souvenirs
of his stay at St. Petersburgâthis, it must be remembered,
was before the days that the capital of Russia
assumed the unfamiliar name of Petrogradâand
other interesting places. There were numerous private
55

letters, some of them tender love missives. But
at the last moment the secret service men discovered
a private desk in a corner of the room which, when
broken open, disclosed a number of papers of an incriminating
character. It was positively declared at
the time that if certain of these papers ever became
public nothing could prevent a war between Austria
and Russia.

And here another curious twist is introduced in this
strangest of strange stories. It was asserted in a way
that gave it the appearance of verity that some of the
papers, had they come to light, would have ruptured,
if not entirely broken, the relations between Austria
and Germany. Even at that time these two countries
were looked upon as the Siamese twins among the nations
of Europe. The Austrian authorities were seriously
alarmed. They could not contemplate a struggle
between their own country and their German ally with
equanimity. The question was what to do under these
critical circumstances. One of the first things was to
take charge of all of the possessions of the unfortunate
man. Everything was seizedânot only the official
papers, but private letters, tailorsâ bills, photographs,
and all other articles that were found in the room.
Not only were the papers seized and sequestered, but
his apartments were sealed, thus concluding the first
act in the tragic drama.

But the most serious part of the business was still
to come. The papers were out of the way; there was
no documentary evidence in the case, but the man still
remained, and what he might do or say was the unknown
56

quantity in the problem. The strangest part of
the queer affair was that in spite of all of these charges
and counter charges against the fascinating colonel he
was still looked upon as a most patriotic person. It
was assumedâand probably with correctnessâthat
while he had been indiscreet and possibly blameworthy,
he never really intended to betray his own country.
Anyhow the cold facts remained. It was a condition
and not a theory which confronted those in authority.
The court-martial had been ordered. It was fixed for
a certain day. If it took place according to schedule
it might strike the spark which would cause a terrific
explosion in Europe. If it were postponed, how could
the postponement be explained? And even if it were,
there would still remain the man who had been indiscreet
and who might be again.

It was at this stage of events that Colonel Riddle,
who was kept in strict confinement, received a call from
two of his fellow officers. They smoked and chatted,
and even had a glass of wine together. All of the
facts were placed before him in an orderly manner.
He was shown that he could not escape under any
circumstances and that if he should live, the life of the
empire might be threatened. It was the existence of
one or the other. He was told, as he knew very well,
that any attempt to defend himself would place Austria
in the position of having attempted to steal the military
secrets of Russia, and further, of being faithless to
Germany. Finally, about midnight, they parted, and
as the officers left the room one of them with a significant
gesture handed Colonel Riddle a loaded pistol.

57

The next morning when the guard made his regular
rounds his eyes met a shocking sight. Colonel Riddle
lay prostrate on the floor with a bullet wound in his
forehead. The pistol with which the deed was committed
lay by his side.

There was much regret, of course. The highest
officials of the Austrian Court were heard to express
sorrow at the untimely taking off of the popular young
officer. His high standing, his unusual ability and his
bright prospects for the future only made the tragedy
the sadder.

A five line cablegram told the story to America. It
is doubtful if one person in a thousand either read
it or paid any attention to it. It was simply reported
as the suicide of a soldier who was about to be placed
on trial for treason. What could be more natural than
that a man in the face of impending disgraceâespecially
when he had been a trusted officerâshould take
his life? Such things had happened before. Why
should it excite any comment?

In the early part of the following month there were
whispers concerning the real facts that lay behind the
curious story of Colonel Riddleâs suicide. These facts
came to light little by little, and finally were woven
into a coherent and connected story. Many friends of
the dead soldier, who knew that he had fought bravely
for his country and had acted as a spy in her interests,
also knew that he had become a martyr for the Fatherland.

One of the results of the tragic affair was a reorganization
of the entire spy system of the Austrian army.
58

Secrets which had hitherto been known to a score of
men were now confined to a comparative few. Every
man was placed under suspicion, and even spies whose
fidelity had never been questioned before were subjected
to the closest scrutiny of other spies whose existence
was unknown to them. At the same time the German
secret service was reorganized and put in position
where the likelihood of a betrayal of state secrets was
exceedingly improbable. Even those who were unwilling
to believe that Colonel Riddle had been guilty
of treason admitted that the looseness of the spy
system placed it within the power of many men to
betray those for whom they were supposed to be working.

âThe Government,â said one officer, alluding to the
tragedy that had just occurred, âfound it imperatively
necessary to close the mouth of one of its own sons. I
hope the necessity for such a thing will never occur
again.â

Germany has never expressed itself officially in this
matter, but those who know a thing or two about military
methods may be sure that the important officers
in that country fully approved of the manner in which
this unfortunate incident was handled. Experience
has proved that there is no way to keep military secrets,
that there is no protection against the weakness or
cupidity of your own spies. Only one man can be
trusted with a mobilization plan, and that man is the
chief of the general staff. If he fails it is madness to
put him on trial. The only reasonable thing to do
under the circumstances is to have him efface himself
59

from the earth. Exile is impossible. Death is the
only remedy.

Such were the arguments that were used a little over
two years ago in order to justify the Riddle case.
Since that time dispatches have been coming from
Germany, Austria, Italy and various other countries
reporting vaguely that documents have been sequestered
at the postoffices in these places and that those
responsible for their existence have been subjected to
drastic military discipline. That, it may be safe to
say, means that those who know too much have had to
answer with their lives for their indiscretion.

In a short while after the death of Colonel Riddle
the incident was forgotten, and so far as people are
concerned was relegated to the lumber room of unsolved
mysteriesâand to that hazy and uncertain
section of history which is filled with stories that everybody
believes and no one is willing to affirm. But it
seems curious indeed that two years after a life had
been sacrificed in order to avert war, the nations of
Europe should be engaged in a death grapple.

War, like politics, makes strange bedfellows. The
fate of nations often rests on the tossing of a coin.
Human lives are but the pawns with which the kings
and emperors play the game. This was pathetically
illustrated in the case of Colonel Albert Riddle. By
snuffing out his own life he prevented war between two
great empires. And yet, as if by the decree of Nemesis,
the Goddess of Justice, these same countries were
soon clutching at the throat of one another.

V

THE ROMANTIC SIDE OF MAJOR ANDRÃâS
UNSUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT

All
the world loves a lover, and the fact that the
unfortunate Major John AndrÃ© was engaged to
be married to a charming English girl at the
time of his execution helped to place him in something
like a romantic light before the world. He had
another advantage. The blackness of the treason of
Benedict Arnold made AndrÃ© shine by comparison, so
that while the American was regarded with horror and
contempt everywhere, the unhappy fate of the young
Englishman excited universal sympathy.

It was in 1769 that AndrÃ© met Miss Honora Sneyd
in Litchfield, England. It was a case of love at first
sight, ardent and impetuous on both sides. But, alas, as
is usual, the course of true love did not run smoothly.
The match was disapproved by Miss Sneydâs father,
and the young man was told to keep away from the
house of his adored one. To make assurance doubly
sure he was sent to his fatherâs counting house in London.
He tried hard to accustom himself to office
drudgery, but in spite of his best intentions the face of
Honora kept popping up from amidst the rows of
figures, and upsetting his calculations.

64

His was an adventurous spirit, and in 1771 he tossed
aside his ledgers and day books to accept a commission
in a regiment bound for America. There was an
affecting scene when he parted from Miss Sneyd and
she gave him her portrait as a souvenir. He plighted
his troth anew and promised that the picture should
never part from him under any circumstancesâa
promise that was kept with pathetic fidelity.

Before he had been in America long AndrÃ©, by
reason of his courage and intelligence, rose to the position
of aide-de-camp to Sir Henry Clinton, commander-in-chief
of the British forces. It was at this juncture
that Benedict Arnold, smarting under supposed
wrongs, made a proposition to the British to betray to
them the post at West Point, of which he was in command.
It was regarded as the key to the American
position and General Clinton designated Major AndrÃ©
as the man to conduct the negotiations with the traitor
Arnold. The importance of this position was equaled
by its danger.

The conspiracy between Arnold and AndrÃ© had been
carried on by means of correspondence for quite a
while. They wrote under fictitious names, and naturally
the greatest secrecy was observed. But finally
the time came when it was necessary to hold a personal
meeting in order to bring the treason to a head.
Major AndrÃ© at that time held the position of adjutant
general in the British army, and it was at Arnoldâs
request that he was detailed to meet the traitorous general
for the purpose of settling all the details. On the
20th of September, 1780, AndrÃ© went on board the
65

British sloop of war
Vulture
with Colonel Beverly
Robinson, and proceeded up the Hudson with a view
of holding an interview with Arnold. There is a
strong feeling, or at least circumstantial evidence,
which indicates that Robinson was partially responsible
for bringing Arnold to the state of mind where he was
willing to sacrifice his country in order to satisfy his
own wounded vanity. At all events, they made the
trip together and on the night of the 21st a boat was
sent by Arnold to the
Vulture
which brought AndrÃ© to
the shore about six miles below Stony Point.

In a secluded spot and after midnight the conspirators
met and prepared the plans by which the American
cause was to be betrayed. Daylight appeared and still
the conference went on. It was suggested that it
would be desirable to have breakfast, and at Arnoldâs
invitation AndrÃ© consented to accompany him to the
house of Joshua Smith, which was about two miles
below the meeting place. They sat there for a long
time and presently the booming of cannon was heard
and they saw that the
Vulture
had weighed anchor and
was proceeding down the river. This was due to the
fact that Colonel Livingston of the American army
thought that she was too near the American outposts,
and with characteristic promptness he brought cannon
to bear on the vessel and compelled her to descend the
river.

This interfered seriously with the scheme that had
been agreed upon between the Englishman and the
American. Plans of the American works, their armament,
the number of troops they contained and other
66

important details were handed by Arnold to AndrÃ©.
To make sure that he should not lose the precious
papers Major AndrÃ© took off his boots and placed the
documents between his stockings and his feet. As it
was evident that AndrÃ© would not be able to reach the

Vulture
Arnold furnished him with a horse and gave
him a pass which directed the guards to permit him
to go where he pleased on the ground that he was
engaged in public business. A similar pass was given
to Joshua Smith who had acted as host to the spy and
the traitor. Major AndrÃ© passed the entire day at
Smithâs house in the hope and expectation of being able
to get aboard the
Vulture
at night, but when evening
arrived Smith became frightened and declined to row
out to the
Vulture
. He proposed instead to cross the
river with AndrÃ© and then see that he was put on the
road by which he might return to New York. The
Englishman was greatly disappointed, but was finally
induced to throw Smithâs overcoat over his uniform,
and shortly before dusk they started to go across at
Kings Ferry. They succeeded in making about eight
miles on the other side when they were stopped by an
American sentinel. Arnoldâs pass satisfied the officer
in command but he warned them against proceeding
any farther at night.

THE MEETING BETWEEN BENEDICT ARNOLD AND MAJOR ANDRÃ

They remained at a farmhouse until morning and by
that time had now approached a portion of the country
some thirty miles in extent which lay between the lines
of the opposing armies and was considered neutral
ground. After proceeding three miles farther toward
New York AndrÃ© and his host breakfasted at a farmhouse
67

and then parted. Smith returned home and
AndrÃ© continued on his way to New York, confident
that he was past all danger and that it was only a question
of time when the treason of Arnold would be
completed.

He was going through a wooded glen when he was
suddenly confronted by three men, the first of whom
was clothed in a manner which might suggest his connection
with the British army.

âGood morning,â exclaimed AndrÃ©, imprudently.
âGentlemen, I hope you belong to our party.â

âWhat party?â asked the leader of the trio.

âThe lower party,â said AndrÃ©, indicating the camp
of the British army.

âWe do,â said the leader, but with a significant look
at his companions.

The young Englishman was now entirely off his
guard and declared himself to be a British officer. He
said that he had been up the country on most important
business and must not be detained on any account. He
drew out his gold watch as evidence of his statement,
but to his surprise, the foremost of the young men
clutched him by the shoulder and exclaimed:

âYou are our prisoner!â

It afterwards became known that the three men
were farmers of the neighborhood, their names being
John Paulding, Isaac Van Wort and David Williams.
Paulding happened by chance to be wearing an overcoat
that had been left on his place by a British soldier, and
it was this uniform that had misled AndrÃ©.

The English major was very much exercised by this
68

time and now remembered his pass. He exhibited the
paper that had been given to him by General Arnold,
saying:

âYou see that I am all right. This pass permits me
to go through the lines.â

Paulding, however, was convinced that there was
something wrong. He seized the bridle of AndrÃ©âs
horse and compelled him to dismount and then subjected
him to a very close search. They took off his
boots and his stockings and found the concealed papers.
Paulding read them carefully and as he came across the
incriminating words exclaimed:

âMy God, he is a spy!â

The Englishman used all of his persuasive powers on
his captors, but in vain. He offered them any amount
of money if they would release him, but they refused
and conducted their prisoner to Lieutenant Colonel
Jameson, who was in command of the post at New
Castle. He in turn instantly sent the papers found in
AndrÃ©âs possession by express to General Washington,
who was then returning from a visit to the French at
Hartford.

By a curious chain of circumstances Washington
was returning with the members of his own military
family, including General Lafayette and General Knox.
On the morning of the 25th of September he sent a
messenger to General Arnold saying that the party
would breakfast with him on that day. As they approached
Arnoldâs headquarters at the Robinson house
Washington turned aside from the direct route in order
to visit the defenses on the east side of the Hudson.
69

Lafayette, with the proverbial politeness of the French,
suggested that Mrs. Arnold would be waiting breakfast
for them.

âAh,â replied Washington, âyou young men are all
in love with Mrs. Arnold. I see that you are eager to
be with her as soon as possible. Go and breakfast with
her and tell her not to wait for me. I must ride down
and examine the redoubts on this side of the river. I
will be with you shortly.â

His request was complied with. Lafayette and his
friends found Mrs. Arnoldâwho was the famous
Peggy Shippenâas usual, bright, gay and fascinating.
Arnold himself was strangely grave and thoughtful.
In the very midst of the breakfast a horseman
galloped to the door and gave a letter to Arnold, which
stated that AndrÃ© was a prisoner and that the papers
found in his boots had been forwarded to General
Washington. Arnold was compelled to act quickly in
this crisis and he gave remarkable evidence of quickness
of mind.

âGentlemen,â he said to his guests, âI am compelled
to leave you for a time and hope that I may be
excused.â

From the breakfast room he hurried to Mrs.
Arnoldâs apartments, and when she came to him in
response to his summons explained his position, saying:
âI must fly instantly. My life depends on my reaching
the British lines without detection.â

It was perhaps a few hours after this that the letters
and papers which told the story of Arnoldâs perfidy
were handed to Washington. Washington read them
70

calmly and, calling Lafayette and Knox, told them the
story, adding sadly:

âWho can we trust now?â

Hot on the heels of this came one from Major AndrÃ©
explaining his position and saying that he had been
betrayed into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise
within the American posts. He asked that in
any rigor policy might dictate he should not be branded
with anything dishonorable, as he considered himself a
messenger in the service of the king and not an involuntary
impostor. He said that he wrote to vindicate
his fame and not to solicit security. To this letter
Washington made no reply.

On the 26th of September Major Tallmadge, having
AndrÃ© in custody, arrived at the Robinson house.
General Washington declined to see the prisoner but
gave orders that he should be treated with every courtesy
and civility consistent with his absolute security.

The charming personality of the prisoner won for
him the personal regard of all with whom he was
brought into contact. His immediate jailor said that
it often drew tears from his eyes to find AndrÃ© so
agreeable in conversation on different subjects while
heâthe American officerâwas reflecting on the
future fate of the young Englishman.

While Tallmadge was on the way with AndrÃ© to the
American headquarters their conversation became very
frank and their relations friendly. Presently AndrÃ©
asked Tallmadge with what light he would be regarded
by General Washington at a military tribunal. The
71

American hesitated, but when AndrÃ© repeated the question
he said:

âI had a much loved chum in Yale College by the
name of Nathan Hale, who entered the army in 1775.
Immediately before the battle of Long Island General
Washington wanted information respecting the
strength, position and probable movements of the
enemy. Captain Hale volunteered his services, went
over to Brooklyn and was taken just as he was passing
the outposts of the enemy on his return. Do you
remember the sequel of the story?â

âYes,â said AndrÃ©, in a low voice that was tremulous
with emotion. âHe was hanged as a spy. But
you surely do not consider his case and mine alike.â

âYes, precisely similar,â said Major Tallmadge,
âand your fate will be a similar one.â

Washington in the meantime had received a number
of communications from General Clinton concerning
the case of Major AndrÃ©. Clinton, Arnold and Robinson
conferred together as to the means of obtaining
the release of AndrÃ©. Arnold wrote a letter to Clinton
assuming the responsibility for AndrÃ©âs conduct,
declaring that he came to him under the protection of
a flag of truce, and that he gave him passports to go to
White Plains on his return to New York. This impertinent
letter from the traitor, enclosed in one from
himself, Clinton forwarded to Washington, claiming
that AndrÃ© should be permitted to return to New York.

As might be expected, these letters had no influence
upon the action of Washington. He referred the case
of the prisoner to a board of general officers, which he
72

ordered to meet on the 29th of September, 1780, and
directed that after a careful examination this board
should report their opinion âof the light in which
Major AndrÃ© should be considered and the punishment
that ought to be inflicted.â This board consisted of
six major generals and eight brigadier generals, who
went into the case with unusual care.

When Major AndrÃ© was brought before the board
of officers he met with every indulgence, and was
requested to answer no questions which would even
embarrass his feelings. He frankly confessed all the
facts relating to himself. Indeed, the facts were not
controverted, and the board reported that AndrÃ© ought
to be considered as a spy, and, agreeable to the usages
of nations, must suffer death. AndrÃ© met the result
with manly firmness.

âI foresaw my fate,â said he, âand though I do not
pretend to play the hero or to be indifferent about life,
yet I am reconciled to whatever may happen, conscious
that misfortune and not guilt has brought it upon
me.â

The execution was to have taken place on the 1st of
October at five oâclock in the evening, but Washington
received a second letter from Clinton expressing the
opinion that the board had not been rightly informed of
all the circumstances on which a judgment ought to be
formed and adding, âI think it of the highest moment
to humanity that your Excellency should be perfectly
appraised of the state of this matter before you proceed
to put that judgment into execution.â

Accordingly he sent three of his staff officers to give
73

Washington, as he declared, the true state of the facts.
These gentlemen came accompanied by Colonel Beverly
Robinson. General Greene on the part of Washington
met the party and after a long conference left to report
to Washington all that had been urged in behalf of
AndrÃ©. Later General Greene sent a note to Colonel
Robinson informing him that he had made as full a
report of their conference as his memory would permit,
but that it had made no alteration in the opinion and
determination of Washington.

AndrÃ© died possessing the sympathy of his judges
and the friendship of all the American officers with
whom he had been brought into familiar intercourse.
Both Tallmadge and Hamilton expressed for him an
attachment almost passionate. He died in the full
uniform of his rank in the British army. A letter
from AndrÃ© to Sir Henry Clinton expressed gratitude
for his kindness and commended to his consideration
his mother and sister and excusing his commander
from all responsibility for his fate, saying among other
things, âI have obtained General Washingtonâs permission
to send you this letter, the object of which is to
remove from your breast any suspicion that I should
imagine that I was bound by your Excellencyâs orders
to expose myself to what has happened. The events
of coming within an enemyâs lines and of changing my
dress, which led me to my present situation, were contrary
to my own intentions as they were to your orders,
and the circuitous route upon which I took to return
was pressed, perhaps unavoidably and without alternative,
upon me. I am perfectly tranquil in mind and
74

prepared for any fate to which an honest zeal for my
kingâs service may have conducted me.â

On the 10th of August, 1821, the remains of AndrÃ©
were removed from the banks of the Hudson to Westminster
Abbey and interred there near the monument
which had long been erected to his memory. In
the south aisle near the window and surrounded by
many great names is his monument on which is inscribed:

âSacred to the memory of Major John AndrÃ©, who rose by his
merits at an early period of life to the rank of Adjutant-General
of the British forces in America; and employed in an important
but hazardous enterprise, fell a sacrifice to his zeal for his king
and country, on the Second of October, 1780. Age 29. Universally
beloved and esteemed by the army in which he served and
lamented even by his foes.

âHis Grace and Sovereign, King George III, has caused this
monument to be erected.â

It is an interesting fact that AndrÃ© never ceased in
his affection for Honora Sneyd. He kept his pledge
to be faithful to her always. His letters are full of the
hopes and expectations of ambitious young manhood.
While in New York with Sir Henry Clinton he was a
great social favorite. Many proud young women,
especially among the Tories, would have been glad of
a matrimonial alliance with the handsome young aide-de-camp.
AndrÃ© was human enough to appreciate and
enjoy all of this flattery, but his heart was true to the
girl he met in Litchfield. When the three farmers
arrested him they stripped himâas they thoughtâof
all he possessed, but he managed to keep the portrait
of Miss Sneyd, which he always carried about his person,
75

by concealing it in his mouth. He thought of her
to the last.

And the pathos of it all lay in the fact that he expired
in ignorance of the fact that she had died in London,
two months before.

VI

THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF THE
CHEVALIER DâEON AT THE
RUSSIAN COURT

The
Chevalier DâEon was not a military spy in
the ordinary sense of the term, but his secret
mission to the Russian Court, in the disguise of
a woman, was the direct means of reÃ«stablishing diplomatic
relations between Russia and France and of preventing
England from obtaining the services of 60,000
Russian soldiers to be used whenever the emergency
might require them.

Charles Genevieve Louis Auguste Andre Timothee
DâEon de Beaumont was the full name of this curious
character who took part in one of the most remarkable
adventures in the history of war, politics or diplomacy.

Before he appeared on the scene Chancellor Bestuzhev
of the Russian Ministry and the English and Austrian
Ambassadors had been engaged in a long and perplexing
negotiation which was expected to end in a
new treaty between Russia and England. His English
Majesty, King George II, was haunted by the fear that
France and Prussia had designs on Hanover. To prevent
this he wished to make an alliance against these
countries with Russia and Austria. Empress Elizabeth
of Russia did not display much interest in the
80

proposition, but her Chancellor, Bestuzhev, was eager
to consummate the plan because he had no love for the
King of Prussia and believed that any extensions of
that monarchâs kingdom would be detrimental to
Russia.

Bestuzhevâs scheme was to raise 60,000 recruits who
were to be placed at the service of England in return
for a subsidy which was placed at five hundred thousand
pounds. This was in January, 1755; but between
the desire of the English cabinet to reduce the amount
of the subsidy and the indifference of the Russian
Empress, the affair dragged along for many months.
Indeed, the patience of the English ambassadorâGuy
Dickensâwas so sorely tried that he resigned in a
huff and was succeeded by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams,
one of the most notable men of the period, who
determined to distinguish himself by bringing about
the alliance which his predecessor at St. Petersburg
had failed to accomplish.

Lord Holderness, the English Foreign Secretary,
gave the new Ambassador to Russia minute directions
concerning what he was expected to do at St. Petersburg.
In a letter dated April 11, 1755, he said among
other things: âOn this occasion it will be proper to
convince the Russians that they will remain only an
Asiatic power if they sit still and give the King of
Prussia an opportunity of putting into execution his
ambitious, dangerous and long-concerted schemes of
aggrandizement. His Majesty has authorized you, by
your full powers and instructions, to do what may be
necessary for preventing such a calamity.â

81

The new Ambassador went to work with great
energy and if the private letters and memoirs of the
time are to be credited he soon found that he was
engaged in a most expensive undertaking. Nearly
everybody about the Russian Court wanted money and
wanted it badly. Ten thousand pounds, it is stated,
besides âthe usual diplomatic presentsâ were given to
the Chancellor. âAn extraordinary giftâ was made
to the Vice Chancellor. After that the Secretary to
the Cabinet had to be considered and a letter to London
said that this person could be obtained âfor fifteen
hundred ducats ready money, and five hundred per
annum pension.â But the money grabbers did not
end here, for the bribery continued all along the line.

As a climax to this wholesale palm greasing, a convention
was signed on the 9th of August, 1755, the
chief feature of which was that Russiaâs aid to England
should extend to all the allies of King George and
that on the first demand for help from England, Russia
would march 30,000 men against Prussia. This
arrangement was to be ratified two months from the
date of signing, but in the meantime was not to be
binding.

Such were the methods of diplomacy 160 years ago!
Is it surprising that the word at that time should come
to have a shady meaning?

But unexpectedly an obstacle arose. Louis XV of
France wished to renew diplomatic intercourse with
the Court of Elizabeth. The Empress was favorable
to this but her ministers knew that if it were accomplished
the new treaty with England would be âmerely
82

a scrap of paperââthat it would be consigned to the
waste basket.

Every attempt on the part of the French authorities
to communicate with her was frustrated. Presently a
Frenchman, the Chevalier de Valcroissant, appeared in
St. Petersburg. His mission was to ascertain the feelings
of the Russian Court toward the French monarch.
He found out sooner than he expected, and in a way he
did not relish. Charged with being a spy, he was
arrested and shut in the fortress of Schlosselburg.
Louis XV was furious but helpless. France did not
have the power to protest against this proceeding
because Valcroissant was not an accredited agent; he
had only been sent as a private emissary to get the lay
of the land.

Louis XV was not the sort of a man to abandon an
enterprise. He considered how he could penetrate the
barrier of diplomats and spies who were surrounding
the Empress Elizabeth. And suddenly he thought of
the man to accomplish this seemingly impossible feat.

It was the Chevalier DâEon.

THE CHEVALIER DâEON

This talented young man, who had written a pamphlet
on the financial condition of France under Louis
XIV, had gained the friendship of the king and was in
the Secret Service of his country. He had distinguished
himself as a soldier at an early age, and was
noted for the success with which he had performed
several confidential missions.

It was decided that he should go to Russia with the
Chevalier Douglass, and that he should go in female
attire. Douglass was to leave France quietly on the
83

pretext of traveling for his health and his supposed
woman companion was to be represented as his niece.
Above all he was not to have any communication with
any French officials whether in France or during the
course of his travels.

His instructions were given in great detail. He was
to enter Germany though Sweden, and to pass into
Bohemia on the plea of examining its mines. On
reaching St. Petersburg he was directed to make the
acquaintance of any persons who might be able to help
him in his enterprise. Among other things he had
orders to ascertain the influence which was exerted over
Elizabeth by her favorites and to send this information
from time to time to Louis XV. No letters were to be
posted in the ordinary way, but all negotiations were to
be reported by means of a cipher code which was to
be forwarded to private addresses in Paris.

The Chevalier DâEon entered into the affair with
much enthusiasm. His appearance easily lent itself to
the disguise of a female. He was small and slight
and had a pink and white complexion and his expression
was gentle. A sweet voice helped to make his
disguise complete. This exploit of the notorious
adventurer afterwards gave him an unwelcome fame
which he was never able to live down, although history
proves that he was a brave soldier and had many manly
qualifications. His defense for the remarkable escapade
was love of country, a taste for adventure and the
fact that a spy must do many things that would be distasteful
to a soldier.

Before DâEon left Paris he was given a copy of a
84

French novel, which had concealed between the boards
of its binding a letter from Louis XV to the Empress
Elizabeth. It also contained a cipher which the Empress
and her Vice Chancellor Woronzoff were to use
in corresponding with the French king. It is a significant
fact that this volume never left the possession of
the young adventurer. He read it on all occasionsâin
his room at hotels and even while he waited for an
audience with the officials of the Russian Court. Is it
any wonder that he gained the reputation of being an
omnivorous novel reader?

The little drama began when the Chevalier Douglass
arrived at Anhalt and stopped at one of the hotels to
await the arrival of his delightful niece. She arrived
in due time, did Mademoiselle Lia de Beaumont, and
made an immediate and favorable impression on all
with whom she came in contact. Such charm! Such
shyness! Such modesty and at the same time such
sprightliness! Is it any wonder that Douglass and his
young relative at once gained the attention of the best
society of the place? They were pressed to make a
long stay at Anhalt, but declined on the ground that it
was necessary to proceed to the capital.

In St. Petersburg they stayed at the house of Monsieur
Michael, the French banker, who was a man of
eminence in the Russian city. One of the first persons
to meet Douglass was the Austrian Ambassador. He
was curious about the new arrivals.

âWhat are you doing in this country?â he asked.

The wily courier of the king was seized with a fit of
coughing and at its conclusion replied:

85

âI am here by the advice of my physician, in order
to get the benefit of a cold climate.â

All the while the real purposes of Chevalier Douglass
were in microscopic characters on the sheet of thin
paper concealed in the false bottom of a tortoise shell
snuff box. Every time he took a pinch of snuff he
thought of his mission. Also he was sure that if he
should be suspected and searched that the snuff box
would escape attention and confiscation. But as the
days went by the charming niece was seized with a
desire to see the Empress, not in a public, but in a private
audience.

How was this to be accomplished?

The French banker who was acting as host to the
queer couple was acquainted with the Vice Chancellor,
who had no love for the Chancellor. So he invited the
first named personage to his house to meet Douglass
and his âadorable niece.â The Vice Chancellor was
delighted with the newcomers and readily agreed to
present the niece privately to the Empress.

The meeting took place in one of the large rooms of
the palace and as soon as they were alone the fascinating
young woman exclaimed:

âYour Majesty, I am not what I seem. I am the
Chevalier DâEon sent to you as the special messenger
of Louis XV. It was necessary to come to you in
this guise to outwit your court officers who were determined
that no message from the King should reach you.â

At first amazed, the Empress afterwards felt flattered
that such extraordinary means should be
86

employed to obtain her attention, and she made the
supposed female sit down and tell her the story of how
the ruse had been planned and executed. After that
DâEon told of the desire of the King to resume diplomatic
relations with the Russian Court. Her Majesty
was greatly flattered. The manner in which she had
been approached appealed to her imagination, and she
agreed that the deception of her ministers should be
continued. In order that the scheme might be facilitated,
she appointed DâEon her reader, which not only
gave him a reason for being about the Court, but also
furnished him with ready access to her at all times.

In a very short time she gave him a written statement
in which she expressed a willingness to receive
and to accord ârespectful treatment for any envoy of
the King of France who would bring with him sufficient
powers to sign a treaty.â With this precious
paper in his possession Douglass hastened to Paris to
give it to the King. DâEon, in the meantime, remained
in St. Petersburg in order to see that there were no
unexpected developments that would militate against
King Louis XV. There can be no doubt but that it
was the secret influence which Douglass and DâEon had
with the Empress which led her to neglect the treaty
with England which the Chancellor had fully expected
her to sign.

âI am sorry to say,â writes the English Ambassador
to Lord Holderness, âthat it is impossible for the
Chancellor to get her Majesty to put her signature to
the treaty which we so much desire. He appears to be
very much in awe of her.â Little did the diplomats
87

suspect that their carefully laid plans had been upset
by the âcharming nieceâ of the Chevalier Douglass.

In the meantime other events were occurring in other
parts of the world which served to make still further
impossible the thing which England had so ardently
desired. King George had become alarmed over the
unexpected delay and entered into a defensive alliance
with the King of Prussia. By this the Prussian monarch
agreed to defend Hanover. This treaty was
signed at Westminster on January 16, 1756. The
news was sent to the English Ambassador at St.
Petersburg, who promptly communicated it to the
Chancellor Bestuzhev.

That aged, if not venerable, diplomat swore violently.
And little wonder, for it meant that his long-sought
scheme to humiliate Frederick of Prussia and to
gain England as an ally, had collapsed. After he had
partially recovered his self-possession he exclaimed:

âThis union between England and Prussia will be
bitter news to her Imperial Majesty.â

âWhy so?â replied the innocent English Ambassador.
âSuch an alliance can offend no one but France.â

In the meantime the treaty between England and
Russia was still regarded as a desirable thing and Bestuzhev
and the English Ambassador worked hard with
that end in view.

The hint was given that some financial gifts promised
by England had not arrived, but the English Ambassador
assured the Russian Chancellor that it would
all be received in due time and that if necessary the
88

promised sums would be advanced at once. As a consequence
of this there was much activity about the Russian
Court. Finally the long deferred ratification took
place on February 4, 1756, but there had been slyly
added to the treaty a phrase stating that it would be
valid only in case the King of Prussia attacked the
dominions of his Majesty, the King of Great Britain.
The English Ambassador strongly protested against
this clause because it made his labor of many months
and his splendid financial âgiftsâ practically useless,
but he was obliged to accept the paper as it stood.

But the worst was still to come. When the Empress
became fully informed of the treaty between Prussia
and England she was furious, and immediately declared
that the arrangement just made between her
own country and England should be declared void.
Bestuzhev was frantic at this order which destroyed
the work which had cost him so much time and labor.
Indeed, so far did he go that the Empress reprimanded
him for his impertinence.

The changed condition of diplomatic relations in the
world now made it more desirable than ever that
France should be represented at the Russian Court.
The Chevalier Douglass was sent by Louis XV to St.
Petersburg for the second time. He reached there in
April, 1756, and was so eager to present himself that
late on the evening of his arrival he called on the Vice
Chancellor and handed him a letter from the French
King to the Russian Empress. The Vice Chancellor,
who was in sympathy with the program of the French,
made it a point to present the messenger from Paris to
89

the Empress that very night. Elizabeth was not very
well pleased that the Chevalier Douglass should be sent
to her Court as an unofficial agent instead of an accredited
minister, but in spite of this fact she received him
graciously and listened to what he had to say. A few
days later she sent for Douglass and gave him a note
addressed to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs
in which it was stated that it would be agreeable to her
Imperial Majesty if the Chevalier Douglass was more
fully authorized or accredited as chargÃ© dâaffaires, so
that it would be possible for both sides to treat with
greater authority on the matters included in his instructions.
She added that this would not only be to the
mutual advantage of both courts but would also tend to
hasten their reunion in a diplomatic sense. It was further
stated that notwithstanding the failure to make the
Chevalier Douglass an accredited minister he would
be treated with distinction and listened to with great
consideration as being a person sent to Russia on the
part of Louis XV.

Shortly before this meeting between the Empress
and Douglass, the Chevalier DâEon had returned to
Paris, but during his stay in St. Petersburg he had
won the friendship and favor of the Empress. He had
on numerous occasions acted as her reader and his
great knowledge of men and things in all parts of the
world had furnished her with more than ordinary
entertainment. She learned that he had a real knowledge
of art and literature and also that while living in
Paris he had been in the midst of many men distinguished
in literature, politics and art. Also she had
90

him recount to her his early experiences as the son of a
Tonnere lawyer and the descendant of a good family.
DâEon was not the sort of a person to boast of his personal
courage, but by close questioning she learned that
he had been engaged in many military exploits which
redounded to his credit.

As a result of all this she desired very much that the
Chevaliers Douglass and DâEon should be returned to
her court as thoroughly accredited representatives of
their Government, but while she was working to this
end, her Chancellor and the English Ambassador were
doing all in their power to prevent the consummation
desired by the French king. Indeed, the English representative
still had hopes of accomplishing the task he
had been instructed to perform. His only fear seems
to have been that the health of the Empress, which was
not very good at that time, might become worse and
leave the matter suspended, like Mohammedâs coffin,
between Heaven and earth. The Court was in what
might be described as a state of uproar, and Sir Charles
Williams, writing to Lord Holderness, says: âThe
state of the Empressâs health has been extremely bad.
On the 16th instant there was a ball at Court, and after
the Imperial Ambassador of Austria was gone she told
me she would dance a minuet with me. As soon as it
was over she was so spent that she retired into her
own apartments for a quarter of an hour. She then
returned into the ballroom and taking me aside told
me in a very affecting strain how ill she was. She
said that her cough had lasted nine minutes and she
could not get rid of it, and that she had quite lost her
91

appetite. While she was telling me this she was seized
with another fit of coughing that obliged her to retire,
and she appeared no more.â

In another letter addressed to his superior, Sir
Charles says: âLast night the Empress was much
worse. She intends if possible, however, going to
Count Esterhasyâs ball, which he gives in honor of the
young grand duke next Wednesday, and there is actually
a machine making to carry her Majesty from one
floor to another without obliging her to mount the
stairs. I leave your Lordship to imagine the alarm
which this Court it in. I had much conversation last
night with the Grand Chancellor on the present scene.
He perhaps is less alarmed than other people, for the
Grand Duchess is his friend and is governed by him.
As her Imperial Highness is the person who in case of
accidents will rule here, I think it will be well to inform
the King of my observations upon her, which I can the
better do because I often have conversations with her
for long periods, as my rank places me at supper always
next to Her Imperial Highness, and almost from the
beginning of my being here she has treated me with
confidence, and sent word by the Grand Chancellor
that she would do so.â

But all of the solicitude of the English Ambassador
was lost. He could not get the Empress to agree to
the reopening of negotiations looking to the treaty
between the two countries. On the contrary she
renewed her request to King Louis XV for an official
representation of that country at the Russian Court.
The Empressâs request was given prompt consideration,
92

for in July of the same year the Chevalier Douglass
was accredited chargÃ© dâaffaires to the Russian
Court, while DâEon, the dashing young adventurer,
joined him, no longer in womanâs apparel but in the
handsome dress of a fashionable young man. He was
appointed and served with great success as Secretary
of the French Legation at the Russian Court. It is
very significant of the waning influence of the wily
Chancellor in the esteem of the Empress, that he knew
nothing of the arrangement by which Douglass and
DâEon were sent to St. Petersburg until these two persons
had reached the frontier town of Riga.

This was an instance where French shrewdness got
the better of English gold. Chancellor Bestuzhev was
outwitted and outplayed at every stage of the diplomatic
game. He realized, when it was too late, that
he had been beaten by a French spy, disguised as a
woman, and the recollection of it embittered the
remainder of his life.

There was a dramatic sequel to this defeat, which
fortunately for those concerned, did not have a fatal
ending. Armed thugs entered the house where Douglass
and DâEon were sleeping and, rushing into the
room, fired several shots at the young men.

They escaped with their lives and were content to
regard the affair as an ordinary case of housebreaking.
But if either of them had been called upon to point
the finger of suspicion at any one, it would have been
straight in the direction of Chancellor Bestuzhev.

95

VII

HOW NAPOLEONâS CHIEF SPY
HOODWINKED THE EMPEROR
OF AUSTRIA

The
amazing audacity of Charles Louis SchulmeisterâNapoleonâs
chief spyâwas never
illustrated to better advantage than when he
hoodwinked Francis II, Emperor of Austria.

The episode really had its inception on the twenty-third
of October, 1805, when Napoleon sent for his
favorite and told him that he wanted to know the plans
of the Austrian army. At that time General Kontovsoff
was believed to be hurrying westward with 60,000
Russians. It was characteristic of Schulmeister that
he received this commission as a matter of course. He
had men and money at his disposal and was in a position
to command the attention of the great. But his
biggest asset was his fearlessness.

On the day after his interview with Napoleon he
started on the mission which was to involve him in the
most sensational events of his checkered career. He
met his old friend and confederate, Lieutenant Bendel,
at Muhldorf, and by him was presented to General
Kienmayer, in command of the Austrian forces. He
was well received as before by this officer, who
regarded him as a member of the Austrian Secret Service.
96

Indeed, Kienmayer had taken a liking to the
medium-sized man with the scarred forehead and was
glad to meet him again. He little thought that this
was the man who had betrayed the Austrian military
secrets and who more than any one individual, was
responsible for the maneuvers which had resulted in
the surrender of Field Marshal Mack.

Schulmeister, with his unwavering blue eyes and his
brusque soldierly manner, had several talks with Kienmayer
and learned that the Austrian was not yet ready
to take the offensive. Also he was given an inkling of
the movements of General Kontovsoff. This valuable
information was transmitted to Napoleon, who made
his plans accordingly.

But Schulmeister was not satisfied to stop at this
stage of the game. He had another scheme hatching
in his fertile mind, and presently he made it known to
his friend Bendel.

âI want you to get me permission to wear the uniform
of an Austrian staff officer.â

Bendel, who had already gone to great lengths to
serve the spy, gasped at the daring of this latest request.

âBut why?â he asked. âWhat reason can be given
for such a thing?â

The blue-eyed one smiled grimly. The humor of
the business was not lost on him.

âThe best reason in the world,â he replied. âIt is
but a slight return for all I have done for the Austrian
army.â

The things he had done for the Austrian army, had
they been known to Kienmayer, would have caused
97

that officer to give an order for Schulmeisterâs execution
at sunrise. Instead of that he gave him permission
to wear the Austrian uniform. The result of this
was far-reaching. It helped to make history. In a
word, it placed the Austrian armyâor a considerable
section of itâat the mercy of the Alsatian smuggler.

Schulmeister went to Vienna, where he proclaimed
himself to be the representative of General Kienmayer.
Vienna, even at that time, was numbered among the
gayest capitals of Europe, and the supposed secret service
agent of the Austrian commander was received
with open arms and treated with marked distinction.
He mingled with the officers and was entertained at the
cafÃ©s and altogether made a marked impression with
the people. His natural qualities helped him greatly
in this bold adventure. The scars on his forehead, his
apparent reticence and his military bearing all helped to
win the confidence of those with whom he was thrown
into contact.

The Emperor Francis II was in Vienna at the time,
and Schulmeister was told that he would have an opportunity
of meeting him in person. He did not shrink
from the ordeal. Indeed, he may be said to have
courted it. The Emperor at that time had reached a
critical stage of his career. He came into power at a
time when the French revolution was exciting the
alarm of most of the old European dynasties. Austria
was in alliance with Prussia against the advances of the
new republic. In 1795â96, the war between France
and Austria raged fiercely on German soil. In 1796
Napoleon, whose meteoric career was astonishing the
98

world, swept through northern Italy and the next year
invaded Austria. As a consequence of this, Francis
was compelled to sign the treaty of Campo Formio, by
which Austria surrendered Belgium and Lombardy,
receiving in return most of the dominions of the extinct
Republic of Venice. Smarting under this, Francis,
two years later, made an alliance with Russia and
England. Again he took up arms and at the outset
met with a number of successes.

But the recall of the Russian general Suvaroff and
the return of Napoleon from the East, turned the tide
against him. The victories won by Bonaparte at Marengo
and by Morean at Hohenlinden seriously crippled
the power of Austria, and Francis was reduced to the
necessity of suing for peace. By the treaty of LunÃ©ville
in 1801, France was confirmed in the possession
of the left bank of the Rhine. In 1804 Francis
assumed the title of the Emperor of Austria, and in
the following year entered into a new alliance with
Russia. The following year began the contest with
Napoleon which was to end so disastrously for the
Austrians. This was the condition of affairs that
existed when Napoleonâs chief spy found himself in
the Austrian capital, clothed in the uniform of an Austrian
officer.

He had not been there long before he learned that a
most important council of war was to be held, at which
plans were to be matured for the purpose of checking
the aggressions of Napoleon. He resolved to attend
that council. As before, he had the aid of Lieutenant
Bendel. It was by means of this officer that he was
99

taken into the confidence of the Secretary of the Council
and told that he would be admitted to its deliberations.
A less audacious man would have hesitated to
attend such a meeting. Even Bendel warned him of
the danger he ran.

âYou are putting your head into the lionâs mouth,â
said he.

âIt doesnât matter,â he retorted; âthe animal has no
teeth.â

At the appointed hour Schulmeister presented himself
at the palace, and presenting the proper credentials,
was admitted. An orderly conducted him along narrow
passages and up a flight of stairs to a wide corridor
which led to the conference chamber. Lieutenant Bendel
had preceded him there and at three knocks on the
door he was ushered into the room. It was a long,
high-ceilinged apartment with a raised dais at the far
end.

It was evident, at a glance, that this was used as a
sort of war office. Large maps were spread out on
the walls and a globe stood in the center of the apartment.
Colored pins were stuck into the maps to
indicate the positions of the various armies then in the
field.

A number of officers were present and others continued
to come until probably fifteen men were in the
room. Schulmeister was presented to them by Lieutenant
Bendel, and was greeted, for the most part, in a
perfunctory manner. The pride-stricken members had
very little time to give to one who appeared to be below
them in rank. One or two, attracted by the report that
100

the newcomer was a member of the Austrian Secret
Service, paused long enough to ask him a few questions
concerning the character of his work. He replied
in a way that satisfied them without committing himself.
Schulmeister was at his best in situations of
this kind. His natural reticence served him well.
Somehow he gave one the impression of imparting a
great deal of information in a very few words.

At all events he was fortunate in being lost amid the
titled and gold lace of the occasion. A large table was
placed in front of the raised dais at the end of the room
and the conferees drew up chairs and began a general
conversation. The Alsatian spy managed to keep in
the background and yet to be in a position to see and to
hear all that was taking place. In the midst of the
talk there was a flutter at the entrance to the apartment
and an official voice called out:

âGentlemen, the King!â

Everybody arose and stood at attention while Francis
II rapidly walked down the center of the room and
took his place in the big chair on the raised platform.
As he sat down the others resumed their places. The
monarch looked worn and worried and he proceeded to
the business in hand in a listless sort of style. Schulmeister,
to his relief, was not even noticed by the monarch,
who was plainly preoccupied.

For three quarters of an hour the members of the
council of war discussed their plans while the spy of
Napoleon drank in every word. It was a situation
without a parallel, probably, in the history of warfare.
Spies have found their way into the councils of the
101

enemy, but there is no other case on record where the
sovereign of a great empire has openly discussed his
plans before a spy from the opposing army. Presently
the affair came to an end and Schulmeister left with
the others. He gave a sigh of satisfaction as he
breathed the free air again and before an hour passed
had sent an account of the proceedings to Napoleon.

Some one must have detected him in the act of relaying
his messagesâbecause he had a system of his
own of getting his information through the linesâfor
he began to be regarded with suspicion. He carried
himself with great calmness but he was too adept in the
art of spying not to know that he was being shadowed.
Everywhere that he went he was followed by Austrian
officers. Evidently they were not sure of their man.
He was suspected, but the proof was wanting. He
thought he might wear out the patience of his shadowers,
but he was mistaken in this.

Finally the situation became so acute that he resolved
to fly for his life. He left in the middle of the night
and managed to reach Moravia. Here a burly Austrian
staff officer pulled him out of bed without any
ceremony.

âYou are wanted in Vienna,â he said gruffly.

âBut I have been there,â protested Schulmeister,
âand now it is most important that I should proceed
on my way.â

The officer roared with laughter.

âI donât doubt it, but we wish to show you some
attention at the capital.â

Schulmeister made a final effort. He produced the
102

letters by which he had wormed his way into the good
graces of the Secretary of the Council.

âHere are my credentials. What more do you
wish?â

âNothing,â roared the big fellow, as he grabbed the
letters. âThese are what we have been hunting.
They will be put to the test and you will come and
answer to the charge of being a spy.â

This was a truly alarming situation, but the Alsatian
smuggler carried himself with great confidence and
dignity. In his heart of hearts he felt that he was lost.
His wonderful activity had made him known to many
persons and surely some of them would appear against
him.

The court martial which was called to consider the
case of Schulmeister met in Vienna and was surrounded
with great pomp and dignity. The soldierly
appearance of the accused and his refusal to defend
himself aroused a great deal of sympathy in his case.
But the weight of the evidence was against him. It
was proven that he had given false information to
General Mack in the Ulm campaign and it was shown
that he had been in Vienna under false pretenses.
After due deliberations the verdict was rendered and
it condemned him to death as a spy.

Schulmeister fought for time to the last. He believed
that something might happen to relieve him from
his dangerous position. The general in command directed
that he should be shot at sunrise. The Alsatian
betrayed no emotion when he heard the dreadful
words. Indeed, danger had become so great a part of
103

his everyday life that it had no terrors for him. Death
in any form did not shock himânot even when it was
to be his own. He called for pen, ink and paper and
spent a long time writing in his cell. It has been said
that he scribbled reports which he hoped to have smuggled
into the French lines. If this be true it proves
that Schulmeister was as much patriot as spy. But
the story rests on tradition, and, of course, is impossible
of verification, by means of documentary evidence.

After that he waited for morning. To the ordinary
man this would have seemed a long black night, but
there is nothing to indicate that it caused the Alsatian
any great mental anguish. His mind was busy turning
over the possibility of escape, but otherwise he was
placid and self-contained. He simply sat there on his
low wooden stool and watched for the sunrise that was
to be the signal for his execution.

While Schulmeister was going through this thrilling
experience Napoleon was hammering at the gates of
Vienna. He had pursued the armies of Russia and
Austria from one point to another, all the time working
to accomplish his favorite maxim, âDivide in
order to subsist; concentrate in order to fight.â As
the contest went along the ardor of the Russian army
grew more intense. It advanced toward the position
long studied by Napoleon and which he destined for
his field of battle. We are told by the historian Guizot
that in accordance with the plan of the Austrian general
Weirother, the allies had resolved to turn the
right of the French army in order to cut off the road
104

to Vienna by assaulting the numerous corps dispersed
in Austria and Styria. Altogether, the two emperors
and their staff officers occupied the castle and village
of Austerlitz. On the first of December, 1805, the
allies established themselves upon the plateau Platzen.
Napoleon by design had left this free, divining with
a sure instinct of superior genius the maneuvers of
the enemy he had cleverly drawn into the snare. His
proclamation to the troops announced the plan of the
battle.

âSoldiers,â said he, âthe Russian army presents
itself before you to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm.
These are the same battalions you have beaten at Hollabrunn
and that you have constantly pursued to this
place. The positions that we occupy are formidable
and whilst they march to turn my right they will present
me their flank.

âSoldiers, I will myself direct your battalions. I
will keep myself away from the firing if with your
accustomed bravery you carry disorder and confusion
into the enemyâs ranks. But if the victory were for
a moment uncertain you would see your emperor expose
himself to the brunt of the attack; for this victory
will finish the campaign and we shall be able to resume
our winter quarters where we shall be joined by new
armies which are forming in France. Then the peace
I shall make will be worthy of my people, of you, and
of me.â

It so happened that this was the eve of the anniversary
of the coronation of the Emperor. The soldiers
in order to celebrate the event gathered up the straw
105

upon which they were stretched and, making it into
bundles, they lit them at the end of poles.

âBe assured,â said an old grenadier, advancing toward
the chief who had so many times led his comrades
to victory, âthat we will bring thee to-morrow
the flags and cannon of the Russian army to signalize
the anniversary of the Second of December.â

The fires were extinguished and the Austrians
thought they saw in this the indication of a night retreat.
Gathered around the map, the allied generals
listened to Weirother, who developed his plan of battle
with a boasting air which displayed in him a clear
persuasion of his own merits. He said to his associates:

âWe do not think him strong. If he has 40,000
men it is all. He is extinguishing his fires and a good
deal of noise is coming from his camp. He is either
retreating or else he is changing his position.â

At daylight the next morning the battle began. It
was one of the fiercest in all of the Napoleonic wars.
Murat and Lanes attacked on the left eighty-two Russian
and Austrian squadrons under the orders of
Prince John of Lichtenstein. General Valhubert had
his thigh fractured and the soldiers wished to carry
him away.

âRemain at your posts,â said he calmly. âI know
well how to die alone. We must not for one man lose
six.â

Finally the tide, which comes in every great battle,
turned in favor of the French. General Doctoroff
and Kienmayer effected a painful retreat, under the
106

fire of the French batteries, by a narrow embankment
separating the two lakes of Melintz and Falnitz. The
awful day came to a close with French shouts of victory.

Napoleon, as was customary, harangued his army.

âSoldiers,â said he, âI am satisfied with you.
You have justified all that I expected from you. An
army of 100,000 men commanded by the Emperors of
Russia and Austria has been in less than four hours
either cut up or dispersed, and what escaped from your
steel is drowned in the lakes. Forty flags or standards
of the Imperial Guard of Russia, 120 pieces of cannon,
20 generals and more than 30,000 prisoners are the
results of this ever memorable day. In three months
this third coalition has been vanquished and dissolved.
Soldiers, when all that is necessary in order to assure
the happiness and prosperity of France shall be accomplished,
I will lead you back into France. There you
will be the object of my most tender solicitude.â

Prior to this the French troops had pressed on into
Vienna. A detachment hurried to the prison where
Charles Louis Schulmeister was awaiting his execution.
They arrived in the nick of time and released
him from what seemed to be certain death. He was
calmer and more collected than any one in the crowd.

âFrenchmen,â he cried, with a mixture of irony and
joy, âI greet you. I welcome you to the City of
Vienna.â

Schulmeister was naturally one of the heroes of the
day and when Napoleon went to meet the Emperor
Francis on the following day he formed one of the
107

small bodyguard that accompanied the great soldier.
The conference between the two crowned heads took
place at the mill of Paleny, between Nasiedlowitz and
Urschitz. The spy kept in the background and was
not observed by the vanquished monarch.

Napoleon treated his fallen foe with great courtesy
and made excuses for the poor place in which he was
compelled to receive Francis II.

âThese are the palaces,â said he, âwhich Your
Majesty has compelled me to inhabit for the last three
months.â

âYour visit has succeeded sufficiently well for you
to have no right to bear me any grudge,â replied the
Austrian Emperor.

The two monarchs embraced and the armistice was
concluded. A formal order from Napoleon was necessary
in order to stop the march of Marshal Davont,
who was in pursuit of the Russian army. General
Savery, the friend of Schulmeister, was entrusted with
this order. He carried to the Czar the conditions of
the armistice.

âI am satisfied, since my ally is,â replied Alexander,
and he allowed to escape from him the expression of
admiration which he could not restrain. âYour master,â
he said, âhas shown himself to be very great.â

After more weighty matters had been settled Napoleon
sent for Schulmeister and congratulated him
upon his courage and level-headedness.

âAs a mark of my confidence,â he said, âI make
you chief of police of Vienna.â

It was a rich plumâin its way one of the richest
108

at the disposal of the Emperor. The smuggler of the
Alsatian village was a man who knew how to adapt
himself to circumstances. In his new post he displayed
great executive ability, and if he added to his
fortuneâwell, those were the times when it was declared
unblushingly that âto the victors belong the spoils.â

VIII

LYDIA DARRAH, THE BRAVE QUAKERESS
WHO SAVED WASHINGTONâS ARMY
FROM DESTRUCTION

While
the British occupied Philadelphia during
the Revolutionary War most of their
time was given to the pleasures of life. It
was this fact that caused Franklin to observe with
characteristic shrewdness that âHowe had not taken
Philadelphia but Philadelphia had taken Howe.â
There was, however, one serious attempt made to destroy
Washingtonâs army during the period and, curiously
enough, it was frustrated by the courage, the
wit and the promptness of a brave Quakeress.

When the British took possession of the city the
officers appropriated the most desirable dwellings for
their headquarters. Thus General Harris practically
confiscated the home of General Cadwallader, on Second
Street, four doors below Spruce. Directly opposite
this, on the corner of Little Dock Street, was the
quaint home of William and Lydia Darrah, who were
members of the Society of Friends, whose members,
it need scarcely be said, have a profound repugnance
to war.

By one of those little ironies which constantly mock
112

our lives, the Adjutant-General of the British army
decided to make his home with the Darrahs. By the
polite fiction which sometimes prevails in time of war
as well as of peace, both pretended to be delighted with
the arrangement. It is certain that the Englishman
found a desirable and well kept colonial home for his
temporary habitation, while the Darrahs soon discovered
that whatever else he might be, their war guest
was a gentleman.

Lydia Darrah had the reputation of being a Whig,
and she gloried in it. She made no secret of her feelings
to her lodger, and one day when he reproached
her with her want of loyalty to the mother country,
she exclaimed with spirit:

âI hope thee is beatenâthee deserve to be for
coming across the ocean to subdue a liberty-loving
people.â

He laughed at this outburst and remarked:

âI was beginning to flatter myself that you and
your husband looked upon me as a friend.â

âAnd so we do. We detest the sin while pitying
the sinner. Though we consider thee as a public
enemy, we regard thee as a private friend. While we
detest the cause thee fights for, we wish well to thy
personal interest and safety.â

âOh!â he cried, jovially. âThat sounds better.
You are really a friend of the King.â

âThee must not feel flattered,â she said gravely.
âWe are for the Colonists. Thee knows that every
unnecessary expense has been retrenched in this house.
Tea has not been drunk since last Christmas. Nor
113

have I bought a new cap or gown since your defeat
at Lexington. Be assured that such is the feeling of
American women.â

The Adjutant-General could not but admire the
spirit of such a woman. Whatever else she might be
she was not deceitful. She did not attempt to curry
favor with the British. It rather pleased him to permit
her to indulge in what might be considered treasonable
sentiments. No matter how radical might be her
views there could be no danger from this sweet-faced
little woman with the poke bonnet and the drab dress.
And, moreover, even when most spirited, there was no
bitterness or vindictiveness in her tone or manner.
As he gazed at her he felt that the serenity of her
countenance was truly an outward sign of the tranquillity
of her life.

Among other things, the Adjutant-General had arranged
for a room on the first floor to be used as a
sort of conference chamber for the British officers.
Here groups of the leading redcoats were wont to
assemble, by candle-light, for the purpose of discussing
plans of campaigns. Several of these gatherings
had been held without attracting any particular attention
from Lydia Darrah.

Early in December, 1777, there was a strange halt
in the round of pleasure among the British officers in
Philadelphia. The men were drilled and organized
as if in anticipation of a coming movement. The indifference
and indolence of the previous months gave
way to activity all along the line. Lydia, who was a
true patriot, observed these signs with genuine distress.
114

She could not but feel that it boded ill to her countrymen.

It was on the 2nd of December that the Adjutant-General
sent for her. She noticed that he was serious
and preoccupied.

âI wish to tell you,â he said, âthat we will require
the use of the sitting-room at seven oâclock this evening.
We may remain late and it is important that we
should not be disturbed. For this reason I would ask
you to have all of the members of your family retire
early. When we are through and it is time for us to
leave I will call you so that you may let us out. Do
you understand?â

âPerfectly,â she replied, with downcast eyes. âI
will see that everything is prepared, and after that shall
retire and wait until thee summons me.â

On the night in question she carried out all of the
orders with literal exactness. But she could not rest.
The words of the British officer had filled her with
curiosity and uneasiness. What did it mean? What
was the object of this mysterious conference? Finally
she could remain in her room no longer. She crept
silently downstairs in her stockinged feet and took up a
position outside of the door where the officers were
assembled. By pressing her ear close to the crevices
of the panels she could hear the talk from within.
The words âWashingtonâ and âWhitemarshâ attracted
her attention and presently she obtained a connected
story of their plans.

She was shocked, and with reason. What she had
heard was an order for all the British troops to march
115

out on the evening of the fourth to attack the army of
General Washington, then encamped at Whitemarsh.
She knew what that would mean only too well. Taken
unawares by superior numbers, the patriot army would
be destroyed. And that destruction meant that the
torch of liberty would be extinguishedâthe hope of
freedom would be destroyed.

Lydia Darrah crept silently upstairs again and went
to bed, but not to sleep. She was depressed and disheartened.
The thought that the lives of Americans
might be lost in vain was intolerable. And while the
members of her family slept soundly, and the officers
in the room below perfected their plans, she wondered
what could be done to avert the threatened calamity.

While her mind was filled with conflicting thoughts
there came a rap at her door and the voice of the Adjutant-General
saying that they were ready to leave.
She remained perfectly quiet and then he knocked a
second time and louder than before. Still no answer
and this time he pounded with his fists. She arose,
and taking her time to dress, appeared at the door,
candle in hand, and pretended to be very drowsy. He
apologized for having aroused her from sleep and left
the house with his companions.

From that moment she was so agitated that she could
neither sleep nor eat. The question was how to get
the information to General Washington. She dare not
confide in any oneânot even her husband. She decided
to go to Whitemarsh herself. In order to furnish
a plausible excuse she informed the members of
116

her family that it was necessary to get a sack of flour
from the mill at Frankford. Her husband protested.

âSend one of the servants,â he said. âThere is no
good reason why thee should make such a long
trip.â

âNo,â she replied resolutely. âI shall go myself.â

âBut at least,â he pleaded, âtake one of the servant
maids with thee.â

âI shall go alone,â she insisted with a determination
that surprised and conquered him.

William Darrah learned on that occasion that a
Quakeress, though placid in appearance, can be quite as
obstinate as other members of her sex. He gazed
wonderingly at the poke-bonneted woman as she left
the house and started in the direction of General
Howeâs headquarters in order to get the requisite pass
to get through the British lines.

General Howe received her kindly, if not almost
jovially. He knew that the Adjutant-General of his
army was quartered at the Darrah home, and he looked
on Lydia as an interesting but harmless rebel. He was
surrounded by members of his staff and they, like their
superior, were disposed to jest with the Quakeress.
But finally the coveted pasteboard was handed to her.

âDonât stay long,â he smiled. âYour British
guests will miss you.â

The moment she received the pass she hurried away
and once out of sight of the generalâs headquarters
she almost ran until she reached Frankford. She left
her bag at the mill, and saying she would return for it
in a little while, continued her journey to Whitemarsh.

117

Washington had camped at this place after resting
for a few days at Perkiomen Creek. He was reÃ«nforced
by 1200 Rhode Island troops from Peekskill,
under General Varnum, and nearly 1000 Virginia,
Maryland and Pennsylvania soldiers. He was now
within fourteen miles of Philadelphia. By a resolution
of Congress all persons taken within thirty miles of
any place occupied by the British troops, in the act of
conveying supplies to them, were subjected to martial
law. Acting under the resolution, Washington detached
large bodies of militia to scour the roads above
the city, and between the Schuylkill and Chester, to
intercept all supplies going to the enemy.

This served a double purpose. It harassed Howe by
preventing him from receiving the supplies and gave
them to the Continentals. All this time Washington
was observing a prudent policy. He was anxious
to fight, but he was only willing to do so under circumstances
that would be advantageous to himself. He
had many critics of this policy, and some of them said
nasty things, but Washington held steadily to his purpose
in spite of good and evil reports.

Lydia Darrah plodded along to Whitemarsh, oblivious
alike of the inclemency of the weather and her
personal discomfort. Her one thought was to get the
warning to Washington, for whom she had a respect
and reverence that bordered on veneration. After
leaving the mill at Frankford she encountered but few
persons, and these looked upon the little Quakeress
with only a listless curiosity.

It was when she had almost reached her destination
118

that she began to feel footsore and weary. She was
filled with a great desire to sit by the roadside and rest,
but she resisted the natural inclination and kept on to
the end. Within that frail body and beneath those
modest and peaceful garments there was a grim determination
that was Spartan-like in its persistence and
its ignoring of pain and suffering.

Just before she reached her goal she saw a mounted
Continental officer. His back was turned to her and
she debated the advisability of speaking to him. Before
she reached a conclusion he had twisted about in
his saddle and looked in her direction. The recognition
was mutual. He was a young American officer of
her acquaintance, Lieutenant Colonel Craig of the
light horse. He was evidently amazed at seeing her in
such a place, and, riding over, touched his hat.

LYDIA DARRAH AND LIEUTENANT-COLONEL CRAIG

âHave you lost your way?â he asked, and before
she could answer he added, âand how did you get
through the British lines?â

She smiled sweetly in spite of her fatigue.

âI came to get flour at the mill in Frankford. General
Howe was good enough to give me a pass.â

âBut you are beyond Frankford,â he protested.

âPerhaps,â she said hesitatingly, âI may be in
search of my son who is an officer in the American
army.â

âPerhaps,â retorted Lieutenant Colonel Craig,
doubtfully.

By this time several soldiers on foot came in the direction
of the speakers. Lydia became nervous and
ill at ease. She plucked at his coat.

119

âDismount and walk aside with me,â she whispered.
âI have something to tell you.â

He complied with her request, wonderingly. The
Lieutenant Colonel and his companions constituted a
squad that had been sent out by Washington to watch
the roads and to gather information concerning the
enemy. Little did he suspect that such important news
was at hand. They walked some yards from the soldiers.

âNow,â he commanded, âtell me what in the world
you are doing so far from home.â

âLieutenant,â she cried in a voice that trembled in
spite of herself, âI came to warn General Washington
that General Howe intends to attack the Continental
army. He hopes to find General Washington
unprepared.â

âHow do you know this?â

âI overheard it last night. The Adjutant-General
and other officers met at my house to make their plans.
I felt that General Washington must be warned and I
walked here for that purpose.â

The eyes of the young officer almost stared out of
their sockets. He gazed down at the frail woman in
amazement and admiration.

âShall I take you to the General?â

âNo, it is sufficient for you to know. It shall be
your duty to tell him. And you must agree not to
reveal your source of information. If it was known
that I came here it would go hard with meâit might
mean my death.â

âI promise!â he said, solemnly.

120

Then and there the Quakeress told him all that had
taken place in her house at the conference among the
British officers. She had an excellent memory and was
able to give him all the details of the proposed attack.
As she concluded she said:

âYou must not reveal my identityâeven to your
men.â

âIt shall be as you wish, and now you must rest and
have food.â

She protested feebly, but he was not to be gainsaid,
and insisted upon escorting her to a nearby farmhouse
where she might obtain food and also rest for a while
before taking the long walk back to the city. She
urged him to go to Washington at once, saying the
message he had to convey was more important than her
personal comfort. But he was a gentleman as well as
a patriot and he did not leave her until she had been
safely housed and her wants attended to. On leaving
he stooped and kissed her hand.

âYou have saved the army,â he said, âand you will
not be forgotten as long as liberty endures.â

She did not stay long, and, after a light meal, left
for the return to Philadelphia. She paused at Frankford
to get the sack of flour, which she carried with her
as a proof of the statement that she had gone to the
mill. Fortunately she reached her home safely, and
apparently the incident after that was forgotten by the
other members of the household.

But she was in a state of high nervous tension until
she could be assured of the safety of the Continental
army. She waited eagerly for the departure of the
121

British. It was about forty-eight hours after her return
from Whitemarsh that the beating of drums and
the marching of many feet announced the departure
of the troops for the purpose of surprising Washington.
Lydia Darrah stood on the sidewalk as the glittering
cavalcades passed by, apparently a non-important
unit in the mass of spectators, but actually the heroine,
if not the most important figure, of the drama
that was to be enacted. After the last of the soldiers
had departed she retired to her room in a fever of apprehension
that was not to be allayed until she had
received definite news of the encounter between the
two armies.

General Howe was in high good spirits. He felt
that he was going to catch the âold foxâ sleeping, and
the thought made him chuckle with delight. The town
was full of Tories, too, and many of them would not
have been displeased if the ârebelsâ received a crushing
blow. But Lydia Darrah, in her darkened chamber,
hoped and prayed that all might go well with
Washington and his men.

In the meantime, at Whitemarsh, preparations for
meeting the enemy were going on in the Continental
army. Washington was impressed with the information
brought to him by Lieutenant Colonel Craig. On
the day of the 4th the Commander-in-chief received
word from Captain Allen McLane, a vigilant officer,
which confirmed the warning carried to the camp by
Lydia Darrah. He made his dispositions to receive
the meditated assault, and in the meantime sent McLane,
with 100 men, to reconnoiter. This gallant officer
122

met the van of the enemy at eleven oâclock at night
on the Germantown road, attacked it and forced it to
change its line of march.

But it was three oâclock in the morning before the
alarm gun announced the approach of the main body
of the British army. They appeared at daybreak and
took their position at Chestnut Hill within three miles
of Washingtonâs right wing. Here the invaders met
with a second surprise. Far from being unprepared, a
detachment of the Pennsylvania State Militia sallied
forth and gave battle to the redcoats. It was a draw,
with a few dead and wounded on each side, and the
British general in charge exclaimed:

âThey donât seem to be a bit surprised!â

General Howe passed the day in reconnoitering and
at night changed his ground and moved to a hill
on the left within a mile of the American line. He
wanted to get into action, but Washington, with great
military shrewdness, declined to accommodate him.
There were several sharp skirmishes at Edge Hill, and
other points thereabouts, in which Morganâs Riflemen
and the Maryland Militia were concerned, but no general
engagement.

On the morning of the seventh there was every evidence
that Howe meditated an attack on the left wing.
This was what Washington most desired and his hopes
ran high as he prepared for a warm and decisive action.
In the course of the day he rode through every
brigade explaining how the attack was to be met and
exhorting the men to remember that they were fighting
in the cause of liberty. He urged them to depend
123

mainly upon the bayonet and to be on the aggressive
always. Both his words and his manner impressed
them, but especially his manner, for Washington had
a demeanor at once grave and determined, which filled
his followers with confidence.

The day wore on to its close with nothing but minor
skirmishes. The reports show that Morganâs Riflemen
and the Maryland Militia under Colonel Gist did
brave work in this regard. An attack was next expected
during the night, but it never occurred. The
spirit displayed by the Americans, and especially their
preparedness, had a discouraging effect upon the invaders.

When the first gray tints of dawn appeared it was
seen that the British army was in motion again. But
they did not advance toward the Americans. On the
contrary they filed off to the right where long strings
of fires were lit; behind these fires the redcoats silently
departed in the direction of Philadelphia.

They had come on a foolâs errandâlike the kingâs
soldiers in the couplet, they had marched up the hill
and then marched down again.

Washington immediately detached light firing
parties to fall upon the rear of the departing army,
but they had secured too good a start to be very seriously
damaged. The Continentals did, however, succeed
in worrying the redcoats and in making them regret
they had left Philadelphia.

Washington was sorry that there had not been a
battle, and writing to the President of Congress at the
time said:

124

âI sincerely wish they had made an attack; as the
issue in all probability, from the disposition of our
troops and the strong situation of our camp, must have
been fortunate and happy. At the same time
I
must
add, that reason, prudence and every principle of policy
forbade us from quitting our post to attack them.
Nothing but success would have justified the measure;
and this could not have been expected from their position.â

It was a sorry procession of Englishmen that filed
through the streets of Philadelphia after this historic
retreatâbecause it can only be called a retreat.
They had gone out with high hopes; they had returnedâfiguratively
speakingâwith their tails between
their legs. They had expected to throw themselves
upon a camp of sleeping and unprepared men; they
had encountered a spirited and fully prepared foe.
The Tory ladies who lined the sidewalks of the city
felt sorry for the non-conquering heroes. But one
woman watched that mournful march with pleasure,
the woman who was chiefly responsible for itâLydia
Darrah.

On the night after the return of the British troops
the Adjutant-General of the army sent for Lydia Darrah.
He requested her to come to his room as he
wished to put to her some important questions. She
followed, quaking in her shoes. She felt that some
one had betrayed her, and prepared to suffer the consequences.

âWhat I wish to know,â he said, after she had been
125

seated, âis whether any of your family was up after
eight oâclock on the night that I conferred with the
other officers in your sitting-room.â

She shook her poke-bonneted head.

âThee knows that we all went to bed at eight
oâclock,â she answered.

âI know that
you
were asleep,â he said with emphasis,
âbecause I had to knock at your chamber door
three times before you were aroused. But I wondered
if any one else was about.â

âWhy?â

âBecause some one must have given Washington
information concerning our march. I know you were
in bed; you say the others were also. I canât imagine
who gave us away unless the walls had ears. When
we reached Whitemarsh we found all their cannon
mounted and the soldiers ready to receive us. Consequently,
after wasting days in marching and counter-marching,
we were compelled to come back here like
a pack of fools.â

âI sympathize with thee,â she said, but if one could
have peeped beneath the folds of that poke bonnet one
would have sworn there was a twinkle in those demure
eyes and a smile of satisfaction upon that placid face.

And who will have the heart to find fault with the
brave Quakeress for the twinkle, the smile and the
white lie?

IX

DOCTOR STEIBER AND THE MYSTERY
OF THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR

One
of the mysteries that has ever puzzled patriotic
Frenchmen is how Germanyâin 1870âwas
able to crush France in one of the shortest
and most humiliating wars in history. The bravery,
the unquestioned courage of the French soldier, in
every war prior to and since 1870, has been universally
conceded. The French troops have often held out
against great odds and acknowledged defeat only after
a long and stubborn resistance. Why did the national
defenses in 1870 fall down like so many houses of
cards? Why was France caught in such an utterly
unprepared condition? Why was it that so many
French troops were captured like rats in a trap? In
a word, what was the mystery of the Franco-Prussian
War?

The answer is simple. They were out-spied, and
the man behind the mystery was Doctor Steiber, Chief
of the Prussian Secret Service.

He confessed afterwards, and it has since been corroborated
from many reliable sources, that two armies
were responsible for the defeat of France in the
Franco-Prussian War. One was Steiberâs army of
spies which invaded the country in 1867, 1868, and
130

1869, and the other was the German military army
which came in 1870.

Steiber was a man with untiring push, unlimited
persistence and an unpleasant personality. He had
big ears, a big nose, shifty eyes and an irritating smile.
Like a certain character made famous by Dickens, he
was always washing his hands in invisible water. He
was cordially disliked by many of the German officers,
but was a favorite of Prince Bismarck, and that, of
course, turned the scales in his favor. Napoleonâs
chief spy was an Alsatian smuggler, while Bismarckâs
secret service agent was a socialist. At least that is
what he was before he attracted the attention of the
German Prime Minister. After that he believed absolutely
in the sacred rights of property.

It was in 1864 that he first performed any work of
consequence outside of Germany. About that time
Bismarck began to have designs upon Bohemia, but
before attacking that country the prudent head of the
State Department desired to get all of the inside information
that was possible. He looked about him for an
instrument, and his gaze fell upon the erstwhile
socialist.

In the latter part of 1864 Steiber set out for Bohemia.
As the people of that country were very religious
he went in the guise of a peddler of religious statues.
He traveled from one town to another gaining the
confidence of the honest and simple minded people,
and acquiring a vast fund of information concerning
the forts and defenses and the general state of military
preparednessâor unpreparedness. He remained
131

there for many months and had the assistance of a
number of lesser spies. When he returned to Germany
he was able to place this data in the hands of
Bismarck, who, in turn, gave it to Moltke.

On the strength of this report it was decided to
invade Bohemia, and many thousands of well-drilled,
well-officered and well-fed troops advanced upon what
might fairly be called a helpless country. It was one
victory after another until Bohemia was entirely subjugated.
Doctor Steiber accompanied the German
army in its victorious march, but more in the rÃ´le of
an informer than a warrior. Naturally many of the
German officers were aware of the character of his
work, and some of them were outspoken in their disgust.
Many of them refused to eat at the same mess
with him. Bismarck was in the field on one occasion
and Steiber complained to him of the affronts that had
been placed upon him.

âThey go out of their way to show their dislike of
me,â he said.

âWell, what of it?â was the gruff query.

âThey should be disciplined,â he insisted, âbecause
I am merely carrying out your orders.â

âYou think so?â

âI do.â

âWell,â was the shrewd response, âI will teach
them a lesson in my own way.â

And so he did. And it took the form of having
Doctor Steiber dine with him in his own tent.

During the course of the invasion Steiber was made
Governor of Braum, the capital of Moravia, thus
132

becoming a sort of glorified chief of police. In this
position, as might be expected, there were many rich
pickings, a fact that was not overlooked by the thrifty
ex-socialist. This was not all. He was decorated,
and the medal bestowed upon him was pinned on his
ample bosom by Moltke. That soldier, like Bismarck,
was eminently practical. As if to justify himself he
said on one occasion:

âOne must not confine oneself to giving money to
spies. One must know how to show them honor when
they deserve it.â

After the Bohemian business had been concluded,
Doctor Steiber had a period of comparative ease. He
rested, so to speak, on his âlaurels.â He prospered
in a worldly sense, and was happy in possessing the
confidence and the favor of those who were high in
Prussian officialdom. He knew the time would come
when his peculiar services would be in demand.
Meanwhile he continued with the routine work of the
Secret Service office. The call for bigger things came
sooner than he anticipated. It was early one day in
June, 1867, that he received a summons from Bismarck.

He dropped everything and hastened to the home of
the Prime Minister. He found him alone, and at
breakfast. Bismarck greeted him with lazy, good
natured tolerance, and bade him be seated until he had
finished, what was to him at that moment the most
important thing in the worldâhis meal. While
Steiber waited he had a chance to study the personality
of this remarkable man.

133

It seemed to him that Bismarck was all body. He
was impressed more than anything else with the bulkiness
of the Prime Minister. He was massive,ââas
big as a mountain,â as he afterwards expressed it.
For the rest of it, there was nothing to dispel the popular
conception of the man, the broad shoulders, thick
neck, grisly mustache, bushy eyebrows and grim determined
look.

âSteiber,â said the Prime Minister between bites,
âwe have real work cut out for you nowâwork and
not mere childâs play.â

âAnd might I inquire what it is, your Excellency?â
asked the spy respectfully.

âAll in good time,â was the playful response.
âFor the present you will see that we have important
business on hand.â

This allusion to the meal spread before the man of
blood and iron, of course, brought the expected laugh
from the Chief of the Prussian Secret Service. And
he sat and watched with amazement the gastronomic
powers of the great man. He had heard of Bismarckâs
ability in this line, but had never witnessed anything
like the present exhibition. He had been told that on
one historic occasion, in the presence of the Emperor,
the count drained a quart of champagne from a loving
cup without pausing for breath, and now he believed it.

The breakfast which was to satisfy the morning
appetite of Bismarck was an average mealâthe kind
that ordinarily pleased him. It consisted of six eggs,
a beefsteak, several slices of pheasant, a dish of fried
potatoes, a plate of rye bread, cakes, three cups of
134

coffee and a quart of red wine. Two large hunting
dogs hovered about the table, and from time to time
during the meal the Prime Minister tossed bits of meat
to them. After he had concluded his breakfast Bismarck
leaned back in his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.
Presently he reached for a long-stemmed pipe,
and lighting it, sent clouds of smoke about the room.
He was at peace with all the worldâand with Bismarck,
too.

âNow,â he said lazily, and yet with a sort of determination,
âfor business.â

Steiber realized, when his patron arose, that Bismarck
was a tall man, a fact that was not always apparent
because of his great bulk. The Prime Minister
laid his pipe aside and paced the floor as he talked.
Presently he sat down again and lit a cigar. And
during the remainder of the interview he continued
smoking. He was what is popularly called a âchain
smoker,â each cigar being lighted by the stub of its
predecessor.

His instructions were clean cut and to the point.
Steiber was to go into France and spy out that country
for the benefit of Prussia. He was to have unlimited
means and all of the assistance he might require. He
was to get plans of forts and defenses generally; to
ascertain the size and condition of the French army
and to learn all that was possible of the secrets of the
French War Office. In a word, he was to repeat, in
France, what he had already done in Bohemia.

PRINCE VON BISMARCK

When Bismarck dismissed Steiber the spy had the
greatest commission of his career. He had little doubt
135

of his ability to execute it. He feared no man, except
possibly Bismarck. The meeting and the parting of
the two men on that eventful day might be called historic.
The Chancellor even went so far as to lay his
hand on the shoulder of his agent.

âRemember the Fatherland!â

The builder of the German Empire stood there with
all of the immensity and impressiveness of a bronze
statue, and as the spy left he carried with him the
remembrance of the tall figure, the broad shoulders,
the thick neck, the grisly mustache, the keen eyes, and
the grim, determined look. And as a background
there was the table littered with the remains of that
amazing meal and the Japanned plate filled with smoldering
cigar stumps.

Steiber went forth proud and boastful and with the
vision of more medals to cover his ample breast. His
big ears seemed to become bigger, his enormous nose
appeared to grow larger, and his shifty eyes were fairly
dancing with delight.

He hurried to his office and began to prepare for the
campaign of espionage. It was not the sort of thing
to plan in an hour or a day. He devoted weeks of
labor to the task. Maps of all kinds were consulted
and all sorts of secret information was brought from
all sorts of impossible hiding-places. He considered
next the men that should go with him and the various
branches of work that should be assigned to them, and
finally the job was completed with the thoroughness for
which the official German is noted.

When Steiber started on this secret invasion of
136

France he took with him two lieutenants, Zernicki and
Kalten. Their work lay in the military line. They
visited fortifications in all parts of France; they carried
cameras with them, and in spite of the regulations
forbidding such things, they made photographs of the
defenses and even of the cannon in the forts. Disguised
as peddlers they made their way into the various
garrisons and studied the methods of the drill, discovered
the number of men attached to each of the regiments,
and altogether obtained a mass of information
that could not possibly have been gleaned from blue
books or official publications.

In the same manner men were sent to the different
navy yards. They explored the warships and cruisers
and obtained data which was promptly forwarded to
the Foreign Office in Berlin. Napoleon III reigned
over France at this time, and while he must have known
the danger that threatened his country by reason of
German aggression, he apparently made no effort to
avert it. Spies ran about almost under his nose and he
could not see them. Some years before this, when it
was reported that the people of Paris were discontented,
he said:

âWell, gild the dome of Les Invalidesâthat will
give them something to look at.â

And, indeed, he gave the people a great deal to distract
them from the fear of both poverty and war. He
was largely responsible for making Paris the most
beautiful city in the world. He laid out the magnificent
boulevards, built the great sewers and in other
ways made the city the joy and pride of the inhabitants.

137

There had long been ill feeling smoldering between
France and Germany and the two countries were on
the verge of war in 1866. But this significant fact was
lost on Napoleon III, and the German spies, when they
came into France, found a fertile soil to cultivate.

Steiber did not stop at learning the secrets of the
army and navy. His spies even went to Versailles
and were to be found in public and semi-public institutions
everywhere. They consisted of both men and
women. If one went into a restaurant the waiter who
attended to his wants was likely to be a German spy.
If a Frenchwomanâpossibly the wife of an army or
naval officerâwent to her dressmakerâs she was fitted
by a female who probably was on the payroll of Doctor
Steiber. At one time, it is hinted, there were five thousand
Prussian spies working on French territory.
Never was a country so overrun by the secret agents of
a foreign power.

Finally, in the latter part of 1869, Steiber completed
his work and started back to Berlin. And all this time
the complacent French Emperor and the credulous
French people, were in ignorance of how they had
been betrayed by the thousands of foreign visitors.
Steiber, Zernicki and Kalten carried several large
trunks with themâtrunks that were zealously
guarded by day and by night. These trunks contained
plans of all sorts and reports that had been returned
by the myriads of spies under the Chief of the Prussian
Secret Service. Suppose these trunks had been
captured and confiscated by the French police? Suppose
Steiber and his emissaries had been arrested while
138

they were still on French territory? Is it too much to
say that it would have changed the course of history?

Steiber on his return to Berlin went direct to the
home of the Chancellor. He found him, as before,
resting after one of those meals for which he was
famous. It seemed very familiar, the broad shoulders,
thick neck, grisly mustache, bushy eyebrows and grim,
determined look. He greeted his agent with a playful
manner and bade him tell all he knew. That consumed
some time, for it must be remembered that Steiber and
his corps of assistants had spent more than two years
in France. It is true that much of the information had
been sent as fast as it was collected, but Bismarck
wanted direct, first-hand news from his trusted servant.

And while he talked the Chancellor smoked one cigar
after another and occasionally tossed bits of meat to
the dogs that were constantly by his side. After the
interview Steiber received another medal to add to the
collection he had already acquired. And then Berlin,
so to speak, having set the stage, calmly awaited the
course of events.

The climax came quicker than was anticipated.
Napoleon demanded that the King of Prussia should
bind himself by an autograph letter never to support
Prince Leopold as a candidate for the Spanish crown.
Bismarck, confident in his power, and fortified by the
knowledge that he had of the French unpreparedness,
calmly refused to lay the request before the monarch.

This was an intolerable slight from one who was
regarded as a subordinate. A few days after this the
139

French Ambassador chanced to meet the King in a
public walk at Ems, and there and then asked him to
give the desired promise. King William refused, with
indignation, to transact business under such circumstances
and later notified the Ambassador that he
would not be given an audience at the royal palace.

Napoleon regarded this as the insult direct, and as a
consequence of the incident war was declared between
the two countries. The people, of course, were unfamiliar
with real conditions. They did not know that
their country had been infested with foreign spies and
that they were utterly unprepared for war. They
were angered at the apparent slight that had been put
upon the French nation and they were filled with a
burning patriotism. In no time the streets of Paris
were filled with but one cry:

âOn to Berlin!â

Napoleon, heading a hastily mobilized army,
marched north and camped at Metz, whence he proposed
crossing the Rhine into Germany. But the Germans,
instead of waiting for this, invaded France, hurrying
directly toward Paris. The scorn and indignation
of the people was intense. Marshal McMahon
fought bravely, but was driven back, and Marshal
Bazaine, after a struggle, was driven within the fortifications
at Metz. Everything had come about as the
Germans anticipated. A large part of the French
army was shut up in a trap, while the remainder struggled
for existence.

On the eve of the first of September, 1870, the King
of Prussia arrived at Versailles and took up his lodgings
140

in the palace belonging to the Duc de Persigny.
And with him was Doctor Steiber, gloating and continually
washing his hands in invisible water. Was
not all of this his work? Had he not spied out the
land? Had he not invaded France before the army
arrived? In a word, was not this conquest of the
army but a confirmation of his victory of espionage?
He was more boastful than ever and his big ears and
big nose were everywhere in evidence.

While the King of Prussia ruled like a conqueror,
Steiber played the tyrant in his own way. He had
large powers and he did not hesitate to use them. One
incident will show the character of the man. A wealthy
and popular young Frenchman, Monsieur de
Raynal, had returned to Versailles from his honeymoon,
arriving just in time to meet the German invaders.
He kept a diary of the happenings of the invasion.
It was not muchâmerely a colorful account,
day by day, of the doings of the invaders. Perhaps
he did not draw a flattering picture of the Prussians.
How could he? The confiscation of the offending
document and maybe the temporary imprisonment of
the writer would have been ample punishment, if
indeed, any were necessary. But the beggar on horseback
did not think so.

He decreed that the gallant Frenchman should be
executed. Friends of the gentleman interceded and
asked clemency on the ground that he was but newly
married and on his honeymoon. Steiber spread out
his big hands, shrugged his ugly shoulders and said,
âAh, but that only makes my task the more painful.â
141

Even the German soldiers entered their protest. But
in spite of it Monsieur de Raynal was executed. And
Steiber rubbed his hands, washing them, as ever, in
invisible water. But all the water in creation would
not wash the blood of innocent victims from those dirty
hands!

While this was going on in Versailles the brave McMahon
was pressing forward to the relief of Bazaine.
Presently he reached Sedan, where a great battle was
fought, resulting in the decisive defeat of the French.
On the evening of the following day NapoleonâNapoleon
the Littleâas he was derisively called by Victor
Hugoâsent a letter to the King of Prussia in
which he said:

âNot being able to die at the head of my troops, I
can only resign my sword into the hands of Your
Majesty.â

Following this, Napoleon, with McMahon and 80,000
prisoners of war, surrendered to the enemy.
Three days later the Emperor was deposed and France
made a Republic. So rapidly did one event follow
another. Bazaine held out until October when he,
with 6,000 officers and 170,000 men, laid down their
arms. Bazaine was afterwards tried and sentenced to
degradation and death for having failed in his duty to
France. The sentence was commuted to twenty yearsâ
imprisonment, from which he effected his escape.

Then came the Third Republic, the siege of Paris
and the treaty of peace in February, 1871; France
agreed to give up all of German-speaking Lorraine and
the whole of Alsace and to pay 5,000,000,000 francs to
142

Germany. The story of how the inhabitants of Alsace
were compelled to choose between becoming German
citizens or leaving the province is a sad one. The melancholy
procession, when fifty thousand of them left
their homes and their all and marched into France on
the 30th of September, 1872, will never be forgotten.

The great statue in the Place de la Concorde in Paris,
with one of its marble figures draped in mourning on
national holidays, has been a constant reminder to posterity.

When the victorious Germans returned to Berlin
Doctor Steiber was with themâproud and boastful
as ever. The order of the Red Eagle was added to his
numerous decorations, and it was reputed that he
became a millionaire in addition.

The Franco-Prussian Warâor at least the result
of that warâhas ever been a mystery to patriotic
Frenchmen. But the solution of it may be found in
that secret invasion of spies led by Steiber and his
unscrupulous lieutenants.

X

THE ADVENTURE OF PRIVATE MORGAN
IN THE CAMP OF CORNWALLIS

This
is the story of how a private soldier in
the New Jersey Brigade displayed remarkable
shrewdness and unusual courage, and participated
in the glory of one of the most successful campaigns
of the Revolutionary War by acting as the
agent of General Lafayette in entering the British
lines, and obtaining valuable information concerning
the movements of Cornwallis.

It is quite possible that other private soldiers of the
Continental army may have performed exploits just
as thrilling in their nature, but Charles Morgan had the
good fortune to be the man of the hour, and the fact
that he secured precisely the information that was
desired at one of the critical stages of the Revolution
stamps him as a man of more than ordinary intelligence
and resourcefulness. Nothing succeeds like success,
and Morgan succeeded far beyond his most sanguine
expectations.

General Lafayette had reached a point in his campaign
where he desired to obtain accurate information
regarding the resources and intentions of the enemy.
He had been worrying Cornwallis for several weeks
and in the summer of 1781 the British commander
146

reached Virginia after vainly pursuing the French general
and destroying millions of dollarsâ worth of property.
Eventually he reached Yorktown, on a narrow
peninsula at the mouth of the York River. He had
no desire to go to this place, but did so because there
was nothing else to do under the circumstances. During
his chase of Lafayette he boastingly said: âThe
boy cannot escape me,â but to his amazement the
youngster with a larger army had turned around and
begun to chase him. It was then that Cornwallis had
retreated to Yorktown in order to get help by sea from
New York. There he began the work of fortifying
himself, little dreaming that he was placing himself in
a trap from which it would be almost impossible to
escape. While he was waiting for the soldiers to arrive
from New York a French fleet of warships under
Count de Grasse was coming to block him. This was
the great opportunity of the Continental army to strike
a blow that might be heard around the world. Washingtonâs
plan, and it was concurred in by Lafayette,
was to march rapidly south from the Hudson to Yorktown,
and, with the help of the French fleet on one side
and Lafayette and his army on the other, to capture
Cornwallis with his whole force. Needless to say, a
movement of this character required an immense sum
of money for provisions, pay and powder. In this
crisis Robert Morris, patriot and Philadelphia financier,
came to the rescue and furnished nearly
$1,500,000 for the work of putting the patriot army
in the proper condition.

Lafayette disposed his forces with great military
147

ability, but there were some points in the proposed plan
of campaign which were not quite clear to his mind.
He was anxious to procure exact information of the
strength of the forces under Cornwallis, and if possible
to learn the exact nature of that generalâs plan of campaign.
He looked about him for some courageous and
intelligent man who could obtain the information he
desired. His choice fell upon Charles Morgan, a member
of the New Jersey Brigade, who had attracted his
attention by bravery in battle. He sent for Morgan
and told him that he considered him a proper agent for
the accomplishment of his purpose and proposed that
he should enter the British camp in the character of a
deserter, but in reality a spy.

The soldier was delighted at the thought of being
selected for such a hazardous enterprise. Lafayette
at that time was in all the glory of his young manhood.
To Morgan he was the very embodiment of romance.
He had looked upon him for months with wonder and
delight. He was to him the bright particular hero of
the Revolution. That a man should give up family,
friends and fortune, and all of the prospects of a great
career, should leave his own country to go to a foreign
shore for the purpose of casting his lot with the struggling
colonists, made him sublimely heroic. The
courtly airs of the young nobleman also captivated the
imagination of the New Jersey soldier. Morgan,
before entering the army, had been a farmer. He was
sturdy and wholesome, yet without the benefits of an
education, and the French general dazzled him with his
simplicity of manner no less than by his natural
148

assumption of authority. He could scarcely believe
his ears when he was told that he was to act as the
confidential agent of the General in such an important
enterprise.

GENERAL LAFAYETTE

âThis mission,â said Lafayette, âis a dangerous
one. It may cost you your life. Under the circumstances
I am not willing to order you to do what I
desire. If you go to the camp of Cornwallis it must
be a voluntary act, and with the full understanding of
its possible consequences.â

âI am perfectly willing,â was the prompt reply,
âand am glad to serve you and my country.â

The Marquis beamed upon him with satisfaction in
his countenance. He spoke to him in a fatherly manner
and added:

âNow, if there is any assistance you require from
me, either with money or men, do not hesitate to ask
for it.â

Morgan shook his head.

âNone at all. I am glad to take the risk, but I
would not like to do this work unless my motives are
perfectly understood. I only ask one thing and that
is that if I should be detected and executed you will
cause a notice to be inserted in the New Jersey papers
saying that I was acting under the orders of my commanding
officer.â

The required condition was readily accepted by the
General, who then proceeded to explain just what he
wished to ascertain.

That night Morgan entered the British lines in the
guise of a deserter, and was warmly welcomed by the
149

English soldiers. The officer who first met him looked
at Morgan with some curiosity, and said:

âWhy did you leave the rebels? Were you afraid
that they were about to be defeated?â

Morgan protested warmly that he had no such
thought in his mind.

âI have been with the American army from the
beginning of the war,â he said, âand I went into the
contest with all my heart and soul. While I served
with General Washington I was perfectly satisfied and
I would have gone until the end, but when they put me
under the charge of a Frenchman I felt that it was time
to call a halt. I was unwilling to fight under a foreigner.
I did not like it, I chafed under it, and finally
I made up my mind to desert, and here I am.â

With this story, which was given with an air of the
greatest plausibility, the British were satisfied. They
received the supposed deserter without suspicion and
assigned him to duty as a soldier in one of the English
regiments. But before going on actual duty the young
man was taken to Cornwallis and his story repeated.
The British general was attired in all the glory of
his high office and the members of his staff presented a
glittering array of gold lace. Morgan could not help
but contrast their prosperous appearance with the
shabby and threadbare condition of the American
army. Cornwallis was an imposing looking man who
evidently was filled with the importance of his rank.
He spoke harshly enough to his officers, but assumed a
kindly manner with the deserter from the American
ranks.

150

âHow many men has Lafayette under his command?â
he asked.

Morgan gave a quick reply, giving the number at
much less than the actual force under the French general.

âHow long will it take the Marquis to cross the
James River?â asked Cornwallis.

âThree hours, my lord,â was the answer.

âThree hours,â exclaimed Cornwallis. âDonât you
think it is more likely to take three days?â

âNot at all, my lord,â was the response. âThe
Marquis has a certain number of boats, and each boat
will carry a certain number of men, and if your Lordship
will take the trouble of calculating you can find
that he can cross the stream in about three hours.â

Cornwallis turned to his officers and began speaking
in an undertone to them. There was much discussion
and a great deal of shaking of heads, and finally the
Earl said in the hearing of Morgan:

âThe scheme will not do. We will have to change
some of the lines.â

After that Morgan was assigned to his position with
one of the English regiments. He was a hale fellow
well met, and it did not take him long to win their confidence.
The circumstances under which he had come
to the British army gave him considerable latitude and
he was able to go and come pretty much as he pleased.
He talked freely with the officers and they, in turn,
regarding him as a zealous convert to their cause, did
not hesitate to furnish him with the kind of information
which he most desired. Once or twice after that
151

he was called before Cornwallis and cross-questioned
concerning the plans of the American army. He stood
this ordeal with amazing self-possession, and by his
native shrewdness managed to obtain much more
information than he gave, the difference being that his
news was the product of his imagination, while the
information he obtained was accurate and clearly outlined
the movement of the forces under Cornwallis.

Morgan became the special friend of four of the
men in his regiment. After some weeks they began
to tell him of their troubles. They looked upon him as
a superior and indicated by their manner a desire to
follow his advice. Each soldier was allowed a certain
amount of grog each day, and he further increased
their regard for him by dividing his liquor with them.
Presently they began to complain of the privations to
which they had been subjected in the British camp.
He listened with ready sympathy and when he felt that
the time was ripe assured them privately that the
American army was at the present time enjoying a
plentiful supply of provisions. He also assured them
that the victory of the American cause was as certain
as that the sun would rise in the morning. Finally, he
proposed that they should all desert and go over to the
American army. The Englishmen were familiar with
the passwords and numbered the sentries among their
personal friends. This helped to make Morganâs
return to his own army comparatively easy.

Their plans were carefully made and shortly before
midnight the five men, headed by Morgan, left the British
camp. They were halted by a sentinel, who told
152

them that they would not be permitted to leave the
British lines without a passport.

âWe are only on a lark,â Morgan assured him, âand
if you will let us go by we will promise to return before
daylight.â

âBut if I do, it will get me into trouble,â insisted
the man.

âNot at all,â was the ready retort. âYou let us go
and we will see that no harm comes to you.â

As a further proof of friendship the American produced
the canteen which he had brought with him and
gave the sentinel a liberal draught of the rum. They
remained talking with him for a few minutes and then
treated him to a second drink. After that he was in
the humor to pass the entire regiment without either
explanations or passports.

The experience which they had with this first man
was repeated with two other sentinels, and eventually
they found themselves outside of the British lines and
headed toward the American camp.

It was an unpleasant journey. They had to make
their way through swampy ground and several times
found themselves up to their ankles in mud and water.
The British deserters were very much depressed and
at one stage of the trip would have gladly returned to
their own camp, but Morgan had gone too far to permit
anything of that kind. He continued to furnish
them with liquor and in this way kept their courage
buoyed up to the sticking point. Finally, just before
daylight, they found themselves within sight of the
American lines. The sun was shining when Morgan
153

reached the American camp with the four British
deserters trailing at his heels. He was received with
great delight by his fellow patriots and almost immediately
escorted to the headquarters of General Lafayette.
The Marquis hastened to meet him and eagerly
clapped him on the back.

âMy friend,â he said, âI am delighted to see you
againâto see you in the flesh.â

âI have carried out your instructions,â said Morgan,
modestly.

âSo I presume. But who is it you have with you?â

âThese are four British soldiers who have decided
to give themselves to the cause of liberty.â

The General directed that the recruits be fed and
clothed and enlisted in the regiment to which Morgan
was attached. After that he made Morgan sit down
and tell the story of his stay in the camp of Cornwallis.
This he was able to do with intelligence and in
great detail. Lafayette thus obtained the information
which he desired. He praised his messenger highly
and told him that he would commend him to the good
offices of General Washington. In the meantime he
proposed to promote him to the rank of corporal, with
the promise of still further promotion in the near
future. But the volunteer spy shook his head.

âI thank you for your goodness. I appreciate it
greatly, but I do not desire to go above the rank of an
ordinary private. I have ability for a common soldier,
but should I be promoted, my ability may not be equal
to the occasion, and I would thus lose my character.â

General Lafayette laughed heartily at this unusual
154

display of modesty, but assured Morgan that his services
would not be forgotten and that at the proper time
he would be rewarded for his sacrifice and his heroism.

Lafayette was now in a position to act with intelligence.
The information that had been brought to him
by his spy fortunately did not make it necessary for him
to change his plan of campaign. He was in communication
with other Continental officers and kept constantly
informed of the progress of the campaign. He
discovered many other things; that Clinton, at the head
of the British forces in New York, was under the
impression that Washington was getting ready to
attack him. Washington encouraged him to think so.
In order that the British general should not be disillusioned,
the American continued to make every possible
preparation for moving against New York. So cleverly
was this ruse carried on that the members of
Washingtonâs own army supposed that he was really
getting ready to attack Clinton. When at length
everything was just as he wished it, Washington suddenly
broke camp and conducted his entire force with
all possible speed across the country to the head of
Chesapeake Bay and thus by vessels to Yorktown. It
was truly a critical time in the Revolutionary War.
While Washington was continuing his southern movement
Lafayette and his army closed in on the other
side. The British realized that they were gradually
becoming the victims of a vast enveloping movement.
Cornwallis put his spy glass to his eye and peered over
the walls of his fortified town. On one side he beheld
the French fleet, on the other side Washingtonâs troops,
155

and on still another, Lafayetteâs army. The Americans,
16,000 strong, were gradually but surely coming
closer and closer. Cornwallis held out with great bravery
for three weeks, but the constant rain of shells and
hot shot made his position almost impossible. Finally,
seeing that it was useless to struggle against fate, he
surrendered. His army marched out on the 19th of
October, 1781, to the tune of âThe Worldâs Upside
Down,â and it wasâat least to the British. They
were dazed and could not understand how such a powerful
army and such a great empire should fall victims
to what seemed to be a handful of untrained farmers.
But in spite of their feeling it was over, and they were
the vanquished.

The fall of Yorktown practically ended the war of
the Revolution. Washington had conquered. Lafayetteâs
confidence in the struggling colonists was fully
vindicated and his great respect for George Washington
increased. As has been said, it was the victory of
a great and good man in a great and good cause.

The news of the surrender was sent post-haste to
London. The excited messenger who announced the
sad tidings to Lord North, the Prime Minister of the
British Government, afterwards said that that functionary
threw up his arms as though he had received a
shot and cried dramatically:

âIt is all over!â

And so it was; and in the victory at Yorktown none
of the Continental troops fought more bravely or
showed to greater advantage than those who served
under the leadership of Lafayette. Among the privates
156

in the New Jersey Brigade none fought with
greater courage than Charles Morgan, who had served
as the personal spy of the great Frenchman in the camp
of Cornwallis. But in his case virtue and courage had
to be their own reward. Many of the soldiers who
deserved great honor were compelled to go unrewarded,
and Charles Morgan was apparently one of these, for
after his exploit, and the ending of the war, his name
does not appear in any of the records of that great
event. Like many other deserving men, he was lost in
the mists of obscurity.

159

XI

THE MYSTERIOUS AND ROMANTIC CASE
OF GENERAL NAPPER TANDY

During
the Napoleonic wars scores of military
spies were sent from England and France, and
most of them performed their work so well
that posterity has not even been given the benefit of
their names. Perhaps the most industrious of these
was a man who was simply known as âO.â He was
constantly in communication with the English Government
and he kept Pitt, the English Prime Minister,
informed of the movements of certain Irishmen who
had left their own country to enlist under the banner
of Napoleon.

One of the most conspicuous of these was General
Napper Tandy, who urged upon the Man of Destiny
the advisability of attacking England by making a
descent upon the coast of Ireland. For more than a
half-century the greatest mystery hovered about the
name and the identity of General Napper Tandy. But
it was finally cleared up through the persistence and
the painstaking efforts of William J. Fitzpatrick, the
Irish historian, but only after he had secured the permission
of the English Government to make an examination
of the secret archives of Dublin Castle.

160

As a result of that, we now know that Tandy was an
adventurous soul who was willing to fight at the drop
of a hat. He is described in Government reports as
an âarch rebel,â and it is certain that he took part in
various Irish uprisings against the English Government.
He went over to France about 1796 and identified
himself with Napoleon. He was a brave man,
with much knowledge of military strategy and
undoubtedly made an impression upon one who was
regarded as the greatest military strategist of his
day.

That Napoleon thought well of the proposed invasion
of Ireland is proven by his negotiations with
Thomas Addis Emmet. The correspondence of the
great Corsican makes that fact clear. But Emmet
accused him of coldness and indecision on the Irish
program, because, instead of going to Ireland in 1798,
he changed his plans and went to Egypt.

However, there was never any doubt about the plans
of General Tandy, and the manner in which he carried
them out is part of the secret history of the times. A
meeting to arrange the details was held in Paris, and
was attended by Messrs. Blackwell, Morres, Tandy
and Corbett. Unfortunately for them, there was
another person present, and that was the English spy
who became known later from the fact that he signed
all of his communications to the English Government
with the letter âO.â

Mr. Fitzpatrick, after the most exhaustive researches,
is convinced that this spy was a man named
Orr, who had been on Pittâs payroll for a long time.
161

He had been a thorn in the side of Napoleon for years,
and even before the meeting which Tandy held in Paris
had sent a note to his chief in which he said:

âThe grand object of the French is, as they term it
themselves, London.
Delanda Carthago
is their particular
end; once in England, they think they would
speedily indemnify themselves for all their expenses
and recruit their ruined finances.â

It is certain that âOâ was not only present at the
meeting to arrange for the expedition into Ireland, but
that he made suggestions regarding the details of that
historic trip. It is interesting to know that before the
ship set sail full particulars of it had been sent by âOâ
to his English employers. He even goes so far as to
make sport of the finances of the French nation at that
time.

âThree generals are to go out on the little expedition,â
he writes, âand all the money they can muster
between them is thirty louis dâor. One of them, to my
certain knowledge, has but five guineas in all.â

Tandy sailed from Dunkirk in the French ship
Anacreon
,
which was well stocked with a store of ordnance,
ammunition, saddles and accouterments. He
was accompanied by a large staff including Corbett
and Blackwell. One of his aides-de-camp was Orr, the
spy, who kept at his elbow constantly, and learned all of
his most secret plans and hopes. Before the gallant
ship raised anchor there was a conference in the cabin
concerning the most desirable landing place. Maps of
Ireland were consulted, and it was finally decided that
the safest, if not the most secluded stretch of country,
162

was along the coast of Donegal. General Napper
Tandy was in fine fettle. He wore a most gorgeous
uniform with gold lace and brass buttons, and altogether
made an impressive appearance. Like many
brave men, he was a dandy in dress and manner, and
when not fighting, devoted much time to his toilet.
The journey to Ireland was comparatively uneventful,
but all of those aboard the
Anacreon
were glad to see
the shores of the Green Isle.

Tandy was very much concerned regarding another
expedition which had set sail for Ireland about a week
before the departure of his own party. This was in
charge of General Humbert, and was expected to
clear the way for the Tandy invasion. As the ship
approached the shore General Tandy hoisted a green
flag at the masthead of the
Anacreon
. It had on it
the words, âErin go Bragh,â and was intended as a
signal to the Irishmen who were to join in an attack
on the British. He also had with him for distribution,
printed copies of a proclamation addressed to the people
of Ireland. It was headed âLiberty or Death,â
and contained a drawing of the Irish harp and the cap
of liberty, and began with the words: âHorrid crimes
have been perpetrated in your country, your friends
have fallen a sacrifice to their devotion to your cause,
and their shadows are around you and call for vengeance.â
Little did Tandy imagine that copies of these proclamations
were already in the hands of the British,
and that the spy who had forwarded them was then on
the ship with him. If Orr felt any apprehension he did
not show it in his manner, yet he must have known that
163

if discovered he would have been hanged to the mast
arm of the vessel.

Tandy landed in company with General Ray, a
French soldier who had seen service with Napoleon.
In a short time they were surrounded by a large number
of people who looked upon the invaders with
amazement and alarm. To them General Ray made a
grandiloquent speech, in the course of which he said:

âThe soldiers of the Great Nation have landed on
your coast well supplied with arms and ammunition of
all kinds, and with artillery worked by those who have
spread terror amongst the ranks of the best troops in
Europe, headed by French officers; they come to break
your fetters and restore you to the blessings of liberty.
General Napper Tandy is at their head; he has sworn
to lead them on to victory or die. Brave Irishmen!
The friends of liberty have left their native soil to
assist you in reconquering your rights; they will brave
the dangers, and glory at the sublime idea of cementing
your happiness with their blood.â

General Tandy made his headquarters with Mr. Foster,
who lived near the coast of Donegal, and after partaking
of refreshments he said to that gentleman:

âWhat news have you got to give me regarding the
expedition that landed last week?â

âNot very goodâfor you at least,â said Foster,
who was an ardent Royalist. âPart of the French
troops landed at Killala, and after winning the battle
of Castlebar have been finally compelled to capitulate
to Lord Cornwallis.â

âI cannot believe it,â exclaimed Tandy.

164

âIt is true,â was the grim reply, âwhether you
believe it or not.â

In order to assure himself of the truthfulness of the
intelligence, General Tandy took forcible possession
of the Rutland postoffice, which was kept by Mr. Fosterâs
sister. He opened the newspapers, and to his dismay
found that all he had been told was perfectly correct.
He realized that the usefulness of his own expedition
was destroyed. Indeed, he learned further that
a large body of British troops was already on its way
to Rutland to capture the latest invaders. Under the
circumstances the only thing left for him to do was to
retire with as little loss as possible.

The thoughtfulness of this soldier of fortune was
illustrated by the fact that he wrote an official letter,
signed and sealed, exonerating Foster from blame for
not having dispatched his mail bags. He testified that,
being in temporary want of accommodation, he was
obliged to put Citizen Foster under requisition, and to
place sentinels around the island.

It is also a curious fact that he and his officers paid
for everything they took, including two pigs and a cow.
General Ray, when leaving, removed a gold ring from
his finger and presented it to Mrs. Foster as a token of
fraternity. Finally, this arch rebel, after paying all of
his obligations, discharged a cannon as a farewell note
to the people of Donegal.

The
Anacreon
had scarcely started on her way
when Foster dispatched two messengers to the proper
authorities in the hope that part of the British fleet
might intercept the invaders. This was not so easy as
165

it looked, because Tandy had already told Foster that
they had met several English cruisers on their way to
Ireland and had outsailed them all. The
Anacreon

proved to be equally successful on its return voyage,
capturing two English ships near the Orkneys after a
stiff engagement, and finally landing Tandy and his
associates in Norway. They landed at Bergen, and
after suffering many trials and tribulations, sought to
reach France by land. The cold became so intense that
people were found frozen to death at the gate of Hamburg.
Weary and footsore, Tandy arrived there at
twilight on November 22, 1798.

There he was met by a man named Turner who was
really a spy associated with Orr, but seeming to recognize
in him a fellow Irishman, Tandy at once gave him
his confidence and eagerly accepted an invitation from
him to take supper. It has been said, but with how
much truth cannot be vouched for, that Turner was one
of those who was compelled to fly from his native land
on account of the âWearing of the Green.â At all
events there was a verse in the popular ballad which
ran thus:

âI met with Napper Tandy and he took me by the hand,

And he said, âHowâs poor old Ireland, and how does she stand,

ââTis a most distressful country for itâs plainly to be seen,

They are hanging men and women for the âWearing of the Green.âââ

166

Little did Tandy suspect that when he accepted this
invitation to supper he was walking into a trap that had
been set for him. Tandy and his fellow officers were
lodged at an inn in Hamburg called the American
Arms, and after finishing their meal they retired to
their respective rooms. Tandy occupied himself in
writing letters. He had many reports to make and
explanations concerning the failure of his expedition.
He stayed up nearly all night, and about five oâclock
in the morning was startled by a loud tapping at his
bedroom door. He opened it and an officer walked in
followed by Sir James Crawford, British Minister at
Hamburg. The officer turned to the Irishman and
said:

âI would like to have a look at your passport.â

Tandy, although taken by surprise, was perfectly
composed.

âIf you will wait a moment,â he said, âI will get
it for you.â

Turning around and going over to his trunk he lifted
the lid very carefully and took out a pistol which he
pointed at the soldier, exclaiming as he did so:

âThis is my passport!â

The officer, who had the courage of his convictions,
made a rush at him and succeeded in deflecting the aim
of the pistol. The next moment the guards rushed in
and secured Tandy. Before daylight he and his associates
were handcuffed and confined in the local prison
by order of Sir James Crawford.

A few hours after the arrest of the culprits Monsieur
Maragan, the French resident, wrote to the Senate
167

at Hamburg claiming Tandy and his colleagues as
French citizens and threatening to leave the place unless
they were released. The British minister opposed
this demand very forcibly, and, needless to say, carried
his point. The French chargÃ© dâaffaires noticed that
Tandy was in very poor health and it is said that he
offered a large sum to the officer of the guard to permit
the Irishmanâs escape. But the influence of the
British minister was strong enough to overcome all
obstacles from the French side of the house. The action
of the Senate at Hamburg in giving Tandy and
his colleagues over to the British created quite a sensation,
and was the cause of a prolonged controversy.

That Tandy suffered dreadfully from his confinement
is proven by many letters and papers that have
since come to light. His sufferings in prison he said
were so severe that life was a burden, and more than
once he prayed to be led out on the ramparts and shot.
John Philpot Curran, writing of his sufferings, says:

âHe was confined in a dungeon little larger than a
grave. He was loaded with irons; he was chained by
an iron that communicated from his arm to his leg and
that was so short as to grind into his flesh. Food was
cut into shapeless lumps and flung to him by his keepers
as he lay on the ground, as if he had been a beast;
he had no bed to lie on, not even straw to coil himself
up on, if he could have slept.â

Corbett, who was one of the prisoners, gives details
of the detention which are hardly less painful.

âWhat happened to me,â he writes, âwould have
naturally discouraged and prevented me from making
168

any new attempts; nevertheless, I managed to correspond
with my two companions in misfortune; and
we all three stood so well with our guards, the greater
number of whom we had gained, that we resolved to
arm ourselves and place ourselves at their head to
deliver Tandy, who was in another prison, and afterwards
to repair to the house of the French ambassador.
Our measures were so well taken that we hoped
this time at least to recover our liberty in spite of the
impediments which fortune might place in our way.
But the same traitor who had formerly deranged my
plan discovered all to the English minister Crawford,
who immediately gave orders that our guard should be
changed and even that those of the different posts of
Hamburg should be doubled, which continued even to
our departure. Such was the result of the last struggle
we made to obtain our liberty at Hamburg.â

Finally at midnight on September 29, 1799, after
ten monthsâ detention, Tandy and his companions were
taken from prison and put on an English frigate. As
they were leaving, Tandy said to the officer in charge:

âWhat right did you have to arrest us? You are
surely not ignorant of the fact that we were French
officers.â

The man in charge shrugged his shoulders.

âI merely fulfilled the orders of the minister from
England.â

By this time France was venting its wrath unreservedly.
It denounced the conduct of Hamburg to
all states, allied and neutral. It compelled all French
consular officers to quit the offending territory and
169

demanded that every agent of Hamburg residing in
France should leave in twenty-four hours. The Senate
of Hamburg now expressed regret at the occurrence
and wrote in this vein to the French authorities.

âYour letter, gentlemen,â replied Napoleon, âdoes
not justify you. You have violated the laws of hospitality,
a thing which never happened among the most
savage hordes of the desert.â

A deputation from the Senate of Hamburg arrived
at the Tuileries to make a public apology to Napoleon.
Once again he expressed his indignation, and when the
envoys pleaded national weakness, he exclaimed:

âWell, and had you not the resources of weak
states; was it not in your power to let them escape?â

As a result of the incident Napoleon laid a fine of
4,500,000 francs on Hamburg. The payment of this
large sum appeased the wrath of the Man of Destiny
and also, it is slyly hinted by his secretary, helped to
pay Josephineâs debts.

In the meanwhile Tandy and his companions had
arrived in England. A military escort accompanied
them to Rochester and thence over Blackfriars Bridge
up Ludgate Hill to Newgate. One of the English
newspapers of that time thus describes the event:

âHad Bonaparte and his staff been sent here by Sir
Sydney Smith, they could not have excited more curiosity
than Tandy and his companions. A vast concourse
of people gathered at the landing place and followed
the prisoners and their escort to the garrison
gates where a new guard was assembled; and so from
stage to stage to the end of the journey everybody, old
170

and young, male and female, was anxious to get a
peep at this wonderful man now become, from the
hope and perverseness of Ministers, a new bone of
contention among the Powers of Europe.

GENERAL NAPPER TANDY

âNapper Tandy is a large, big-boned, muscular
man, much broken and emaciated. His hair is quite
white from age, cut close behind into his neck, and
he appears much enervated. This is indeed very natural
if it be considered that he is nearly seventy years
of age and has just suffered a long and rigorous confinement,
his mind a constant prey of the most painful
suspense. He wore a large friarâs hat, a long silk
black greatcoat and military boots, which had a very
â
outre
â effect.

âOf Blackwell and Morres, the latter seemed to be
five and thirty. They are two tall, handsome looking
men. They wore military dress and had a very soldier
like appearance. The first named is a man of
very enterprising genius, about the middle size and
apparently not more than four or five and twenty, and
has the look of a foreigner.â

Eventually Tandy and his companions were removed
to Ireland and were placed at the bar of the
Kingâs Bench, when the Attorney General prayed that
sentence of death should be passed upon them. The
case was argued for several days and finally Lord
Kilwarden ruled that Tandy should be discharged.
But he was scarcely given his liberty when he was
again arrested in the district where, two years before,
he had made a hostile descent from France. He lay
in the jail there for seven months, during which time
171

great efforts were made to insure the conviction of
what was regarded as a very dangerous character.

Tandy, finding the evidence against him overwhelming,
admitted the truth of the indictment and was sentenced
to die on the 4th of the following May. Meanwhile
Napoleon, on his return from Egypt, claimed
Tandy as a French general and held an English prisoner
of equal rank a hostage for his safety. At this
stage of the historic affair it was not quite so clear
that the English had a legal claim to the life of a man
who wore the uniform of a French general and who
had been arrested under such peculiar circumstances.
A pardon was eventually made out for him on condition
of banishment to Botany Bay. He indignantly
refused it, but was finally induced to accept it on the
ground that all that was required was merely the name
of transportation, and that if he pleased, it might appear
to the world as if he had made his escape at sea.

Napper Tandy arrived at Bordeaux on the 14th of
March, 1802, where he was received with military honors.
Bordeaux was illuminated and the old rebel was
promoted to the rank of a general of division. In the
midst of his vindication, as he termed it, he read with
real horror a speech of Pelhamâs in Parliament saying
that he owed his life to the useful information and
discoveries he had given to the British Government.
Instantly he addressed a letter to Pelham branding the
statement as audacious and false. Mr. Elliott repeated
in Parliament the taunt cast by Pelham, and spoke of
Tandyâs ignorance and insignificant birth. Tandy immediately
challenged him to a duel, saying: âA
172

French officer must not be insulted with impunity, and
you, as well as the country which gave me birth and
that which has adopted me, shall find that I will preserve
the honor of my station.â

When eight weeks had elapsed and Elliott had failed
to reply, Tandy at once proclaimed him âA calumniator,
liar and poltroon.â

The most curious part of the whole business is that
General Tandy never knew that he had been betrayed
by a spy who was serving under him as an aide-de-camp.
His private character was as clean as a houndâs
tooth, a fact that led one of his friends to say that
âit furnished no ground to doubt the integrity of his
public one.â

But his experiences in and out of prison undermined
his health, and after a lingering illness, he died at
Bordeaux in 1803. By one of the curious decrees of
destiny George Orr, the spy, lived and prospered long
after Tandyâs death, and, if rumor be correct, managed
to accumulate not only English but French gold!

XII

HOW MONSIEUR DE MEINAU HELPED TO
MAKE JEROME BONAPARTE KING OF
WESTPHALIA

Among
all of the worldâs famous impostors it
is doubtful if any could hold a candle to Monsieur
de Meinau. Monsieur did not always
have such a dignified name. Originally, it will be
recalled, he was an Alsatian smuggler and had the
plain every-day appellation of Schulmeister. But as
Napoleonâs chief spy his rise to fame and fortune was
both sure and sudden. He was lavishly rewarded by
the Man of Destiny. Indeed, his appointment as Chief
of Police of Vienna was a fortune in itself and a fair
return for the services he had rendered, and the dangers
he had braved as the secret agent of Napoleon.

But Napoleon was not yet satisfied. He wished to
be the King of Kings and to reconstruct Germany,
Italy and the Netherlands. His ambition was to rule
over an empire that should be encircled and guarded
by a belt of dependent thrones. In pursuance of
this policy he seized Naples and made his brother
Joseph its king. After that he converted the Republic
of the Netherlands into a monarchy, and placed his
brother Louis at its head with the title of the King of
Holland.

176

In the meantime he needed more information concerning
the power and the plans of those who were
opposed to his designs. At this stage of events he
once more sent for his trusted spy, Schulmeister. He
had made him Monsieur de Meinau, with both the title
and the estates that went with it. But the new Monsieur
knew his imperial patron well enough to understand
that he could not rest on his laurels. With Napoleon
incessant activity was the price of favor.

As the result of the interview with the Emperor
Monsieur left Vienna with letters of introduction to
the Austrian officers at Oedenburg. This was in west
Hungary, about thirty-seven miles from the Austrian
capitol. Here he learned that the Archduke Charles
and Ferdinand had combined forces the day before
and were preparing for a united attack on the French
troops. This information was exceedingly important
and he never rested until he had forwarded it to
Napoleon.

After that he felt entitled to a little relaxation and
he joined the Austrian officers in the gayeties of camp
life. He had been hospitably received on his arrival
and now was royally entertained by his new found
friends. His scarred forehead and his severe military
manner impressed them. Add to this the fact that he
was supposed to have undergone great privations and
dangers as an officer of the Austrian Secret Service
and it will not be difficult to understand why the soldiers
insisted upon placing a halo of romance around
his head. A dinner was given in his honor and on
this occasion the rascal actually entertained his hosts
177

with stories of some of his thrilling adventures in the
service of the Fatherland. His methods were simple
enough. He related real exploits, merely picturing
himself as an Austrian secret agent instead of a spy
of Napoleon. His narratives were received with applause
and manifestations of delight.

The Austrians had been at Oedenburg for some time
and the pleasures of camp life were beginning to affect
the discipline of the men. Schulmeister, or rather
Monsieur de Meinau, was ordinarily a person of abstemious
habits, but he could be a jolly good fellow
when the occasion demanded it, and this, you may be
sure, was one of the occasions. The flowing bowl was
passed around so often that it was in grave danger of
flowing over. The more wine the officers drank the
greater became their affection for the spy. They literally
threw themselves around his neck, which was
quite a generous thing to do when we consider that
under the military customs of the time they would have
been justified in placing a rope around that same neck.
But there was one man at the banqueting board who
was a deathâs head at the feast. Lieutenant Bernstein
looked and felt unhappy. He did not share the confidence
of his comrades in Monsieur de Meinau. In
fact, he frankly regarded him as a fraud. So he sat
there eating little and drinking less and wondering how
he could bring the spy to grief.

His opportunity came sooner than he expected.
Monsieur de Meinau, having reduced his hosts to a
state of semi-intoxication, hastened out to send further
information to Napoleon. With his usual cleverness
178

he had established a chain of communication between
Oedenburg and Vienna. He had his own sub-spies
within and without the lines of the enemy, and thus
had a method of forwarding his dispatches which
would have been envied by modern news associations
in times of war. But on this one occasion he reckoned
without his hostâor at least this particular host.
Bernstein was at his very heels, and when he saw him
pass the slips of paper into the hands of a confederate,
felt that it was time for some one to interfere. Consequently
when Monsieur de Meinau returned to the
banqueting board Bernstein pointed an accusing finger
in his direction and exclaimed:

âI denounce that man as a spy!â

There was a loud shout of laughter at this and the
man nearest to him punched the accuser in the ribs.

âWhy, old man, thereâs nothing startling in that.
We know that he is a spy.â

Monsieur de Meinau folded his arms and looked the
lieutenant in the eye.

âThe comrade is trying to have a jest at my expense.
Gentlemen, you all know that I am a spy. I
have told you myself. Perhaps it was an indiscretion,
butââ

âNo! No!â cried Bernstein, excitedly. âNot
that kind of a spy. I say that he is a spy against
Austria. He has been in communication with the
French troops. I caught him in the act of sending
messages through the lines.â

Silence fell upon the group of officers surrounding
the two men. The force of the accusation was
179

startlingâso startling that it sobered them at once.
A bucket of water thrown into each of their faces
would not have been half so shocking. All of them
turned to Monsieur de Meinau. His face was pale,
but he did not lose his composure. He was ready for
whatever might happen. The chief officer cried
sternly:

âWhat have you to say to this?â

Monsieur de Meinauâs arms were still folded in the
way in which he had often seen Napoleon fold his
arms.

âGentlemen,â he said with dignity, âI have been
grossly insulted, and under the circumstances I can
only do one thingâI demand an instant investigation
of the accusation against me. I insist upon a trialâa
court martial, if you will.â

The audacity of this request had the expected result.
It disarmed suspicion at the outset. And his insistence
upon a trial only served to strengthen him in the
minds of the officers. He was given a trial, but it was
largely a perfunctory affair. The lieutenant who
made the accusation was, of course, unable to prove
his charge. The only witnesses against Schulmeister
had fled, and he was triumphantly acquitted. He displayed
numerous letters, some real and others forged,
to prove that he was a patriot working in the Austrian
Secret Service. General Wilhing, who presided over
the trial, was profuse in his apologies and insisted
upon giving him a letter to the Archduke Charles who
was then at Koermoend.

Monsieur de Meinau proceeded gayly on his way to
180

the headquarters of the Archduke, arriving with his
letters and his never-failing audacity. His Austrian
uniform, of course, was an immense asset, which he
did not fail to utilize to the fullest extent. He was
not only in the confidence of the Austrians, but also
in the position of being a âvindicatedâ man. Thereafter
no one could have the temerity to point the finger
of suspicion in his direction. Any charge they might
make would have the appearance of being a stale and
exploded slander. The most important thing for him
now was not to be caught in the commission of any
overt act.

Most military spies come to grief by having dispatches
and documents on their person. Monsieur de
Meinau knew this, and he made it his business to get
rid of incriminating documents at the earliest possible
moment. But yet there were times when papers and
documents were his chief stock in trade. He was
cordially received at Koermoend and was taken to the
Archduke Charles by a member of that Generalâs staff.
The nobleman greeted the newcomer kindly and asked
him for information regarding the enemy. Monsieur
de Meinau having just come from Vienna via Oedenburg
was able to give the Archduke some very interesting
news. The fact that the greater part of it was
the product of his vivid imagination did not make it
any the less thrilling. As a consequence of this the
Archduke regarded him with unusual favor.

This fact was not lost on the lesser lights of the
camp at Koermoend. The chief-of-staff of the Archduke
conceived that one who was so highly regarded
181

by his superior was entitled to special attention at his
hand. So he invited him to be his guest during his
brief stay at the headquarters of the Archduke.
Schulmeisterâto give him his old name for the momentâaccepted
cheerfully, but reminded his host that
he was a very busy man and that he might be compelled
at any moment to leave him abruptly and without
notice. This was the solemn truth, but, of course, the
humor of it was lost on the chief-of-staff.

Now the General had his headquarters in a roomy
frame building not far from that of the Archduke.
His office was in a large apartment on the first floor.
Here he kept all of his papers and military correspondence.
Monsieur de Meinauâto get back to his formal
designationâmade note of all this and was quick
to see where the soldier placed the keys of the place.
For some days now he followed a policy of watchful
waiting. He was a persistent man, but also a patient
one. He felt sure that his opportunity would comeâand
it did.

One morning the Archduke decided to make an inspection
of his troops. This was an all-day job and
he was naturally accompanied by his chief-of-staff.
When they were out of sight and hearing the spy
began his operations. He had access to the house, but
the desk containing the coveted papers was locked.
By rare goodâor badâfortune, the General had
left his bunch of keys on a hook behind the door.
Monsieur de Meinau possessed himself of them and
opened the desk of the absent soldier. To his delight
he found a mass of most important correspondence.

182

He tiptoed over to the door and locked it securely.
After that he pulled down the blinds and started in to
read the papers. It consumed several hours and at
the end of that time he had discovered many things
which he felt sure were important to Napoleon. The
question now was whether to steal the papers or copy
them. He finally decided on the latter course. There
were two reasons for this. The first was that he could
accomplish his purpose without exciting any suspicion
and the second that the chief-of-staff, for whom he
had come to hold a certain regard, would be held
blameless.

He went at his work with a will. He used a cipher
of his own which was a sort of shorthand, and long
before the sun went down he had filled his memorandum
books with most valuable information. Just as
he finished there came a loud rapping at the door.
He was startled, but not seriously disturbed. He concealed
his notebook, locked the desk, placed the keys
where he had found them, and then hastily undressed.
A couch was in the corner of the room, and he threw
himself on it. In the meantime the knocking had
become more pronounced. He arose and opened the
door, presenting a sleepy and dishevelled appearance
to the man at the door. It proved to be, as he had
expected, the chief-of-staff, returned from his tour
of inspection. Monsieur de Meinau was all apologies.

âI am so sorry to have kept you waiting,â he murmured,
âbut I was tired and I am a heavy sleeper.â

The General was graciousness itself.

183

âNo excuses are necessary,â he insisted. âI regret
having disturbed you. Please lie down again and take
the rest I know you must need so badly.â

After that speech it might be supposed that Monsieur
de Meinau would relent. But not so. He had
other uses for his victim. He had supper with him
and late that night asked for a safe conduct to Vienna.

âI have to go after some information and it is too
late to go to the Archduke. I am sure he would give it
to me but I dislike disturbing him. Perhaps it is too
much to ask from you?â

The chief-of-staff gave a gracious wave of the arm
which might be taken to mean that everything he had
was at the disposal of the spy. He said:

âIt gives me great pleasure to serve you in this matter
because in doing so I know that I am serving my
country.â

If Monsieur de Meinau had been capable of blushing
he would have done so at that moment. But he merely
sat there stolidly waiting while the General wrote the
desired pass. When it was handed to him he put it in
his wallet, bade his host an affectionate farewell and
started off with the stolen correspondence.

He reached Vienna in safety and immediately
reported to Napoleon, giving the Little Corporal not
only the copies of the letters and papers, but also
a great amount of verbal information. Napoleon
already had his plans made for the campaign which
was to end by placing his brother Jerome on the throne
of Westphalia. The data given him by Monsieur de
Meinau enabled him to dispose his forces still more
184

advantageously. Also it placed the enemy at a tremendous
disadvantage.

At this time there had been formed a new combination
against France, consisting of England, Russia,
Sweden, Saxony and Prussia. The contest began in
1806 with two thrilling battles, Jena and Auerstadt.
They were fought on the same day. It was a crushing
defeat for the Prussians, and Napoleon, already having
possession of Vienna, now marched in triumph into
Berlin. Well might he gloat over his triumph, for he
had accomplished in a few hours what Austria, France
and Russia had been unable to do in the Seven Yearsâ
War of the preceding century. And within a stoneâs
throw of the Emperor and sharing with him the glories
of this historic occasion was his faithful spy.

But the opposition, while dismayed, was not yet
entirely vanquished. The Prussians gathered their
scattered forces together and joining with the Russians
made a final stand at Eylau. The battle there was
fierce, but not decisive. A short time after this the
French won the battle of Friedland, and then a treaty
of peace was signed.

Napoleon gained precisely what he wanted. By the
peace treaty Prussia gave up a large part of her territory.
From a portion of it, lying west of the Elbe,
he created the Kingdom of Westphalia. This was
bestowed upon his brother Jerome, thus adding another
kingdom to the group of states which he was accumulating
and whichâhe thought in his colossal vanityâwas
to make him King of Kings. Monsieur de
Meinau was present when Jerome was crowned, as was
185

befitting for one who had risked his life in the cause of
the king-maker.

In 1809 Monsieur de Meinau was given command
of the Military Police of the French Army. From
that date, although his field of Operations was
increased, his personal exploits became less numerous.
He did undertake one or two private missions for
Napoleon, but for the most part his hours were fully
occupied in directing the activities of others. That he
was a busy man may be appreciated from the ceaseless
labors of Napoleon. That remarkable man never
rested and, needless to say, did not permit any one
about him to rest. There came the seizure of the
thrones of Portugal and Spain, the Peninsular War,
the quarrel with the Pope, the battle of Wagram and
then the divorce from Josephine and the marriage to
the Princess Marie Louise. In all of these stirring
events the former Alsatian smuggler played his part.

Napoleon, while a hard taskmaster, was a liberal
paymaster. Time and again his spy was given large
sums of money, and what was quite as good, the opportunities
of making money. But there was one thing
he craved, and that was the cross of the Legion of
Honor. He had been a soldier as well as a spy, and
felt that this entitled him to the decoration. Familiar
as he had been with the Man of Destiny, the spy did
not have the courage to personally ask him for this
favor. He confided his wish to General Savery, his
original patron, who undertook to present the case to
the Emperor. The great Napoleon had ideas of his
own on this point. He fully appreciated the value of
186

the services rendered by Schulmeister but when the
decoration was demanded he gave an aggressive shake
of the head.

âMoney as much as you like,â he cried, âbut the
crossânever!â

And the money poured into the outstretched hands
of Monsieur de Meinau, but the decoration of the
Legion of Honor remained ever beyond his reach.
Presently the fortunes of Napoleon began to wane,
and, appropriately enough the fortunes of his chief
spy also waned. He became a comparatively poor
man and went to spend the declining years of his life
in the town of his birth. There Napoleon III called on
him and talked of the great days that had gone before.

Some time in the forties a Parisian visiting the Alsatian
village met a little old man, dressed in black, and
walking about with the aid of a cane. In spite of his
great age he was nattily attired and the red rose in his
buttonhole betokened the spirit of youth that dwelt
within him. He was amiable and very, very gentle.
This man was Louis Joseph Schulmeister, afterwards
Monsieur de Meinau, Napoleonâs chief spy, and the
hero of a hundred thrilling escapes.

The good, it is said, die young; this amazing man
lived to be eighty-two, and died in bed!

XIII

THE STRANGE MYSTERY SURROUNDING
THE BETRAYAL OF CAPTAIN
NATHAN HALE

Most
Americans are fairly familiar with the
story of the heroic sacrifice of Captain Nathan
Hale, but none have yet ventured to remove
the veil of mystery that hides the identity of the
betrayer of the young patriot.

Who delivered Nathan Hale into the hands of his
executioners? That is a question which has never
been answered. Was it one of his own cousins who
happened to be a Tory and a British sympathizer?
That suspicion has been expressed and although it
has been pushed aside by Benson J. Lossing the historian,
he admits that he has not been able to obtain any
data for or against this theory.

It is a notorious fact that the Tories were very
numerous in and about New York, and there seems to
be reason for believing that some of Haleâs own family
were in sympathy with their sycophantic sentiments.
Could feelings of envy have entered into one of the
saddest betrayals of American history? It is to be
hoped not for the sake of our common humanity, and
yet the popularity of Hale as he reached manâs estate
190

was likely to arouse the mean jealousy of those of a
lower order of mentality.

Nathan Hale was a magnificent specimen of manhood.
His physical and mental qualities were alike
distinguished. He was graduated from Yale college
with high honors and while there made a record as an
athlete. He was almost six feet in height, perfectly
proportioned, and, in the words of Dr. Munson, was
âthe most manly man I have ever met.â His chest
was broad, his muscles firm; his face wore a most
benign expression; his complexion was rosy; his eyes,
light blue and beaming with intelligence; his hair soft
and light brown and his speech low, sweet and musical.
Is it any wonder that the girls of New Haven loved
him and wept when they heard his fate?

Nathan Hale was engaged in teaching school at New
London when the rumbles of the Revolution first began
to disturb the placid life of that part of the country.
On the day that American blood was first shed at Lexington
a twilight town meeting was called and Nathan
Hale was one of the speakers. He called upon the
people to act at once and to act in a manner that could
not be misunderstood.

âLet us march immediately,â he cried with all of the
passionate ardor of youth, âand let us never lay down
our arms until we have obtained our independence.â

As a proof of both his consistency and his patriotism,
Hale immediately enrolled himself as a volunteer.
The following morning he bade good-by to his pupils
and departed for Cambridge. Before long he had
been formally enlisted as a lieutenant of a company in
191

a regiment commanded by Colonel Charles Webb, and
late in September of that year marched with his regiment
to Cambridge and participated in the siege of
Boston. Within three months he had been commissioned
as a captain because of vigilance and bravery.
The British were driven from Boston in the spring of
the following year, and soon after that the Americans
proceeded to New York. His earnestness in the cause
was proven when he surrendered his own pay to his
men in the endeavor to have them prolong their term
of service, which had already expired.

Even at this early stage of his military career he
covered himself with glory by performing what proved
to be one of the most daring feats of the Revolution.
A British sloop laden with provisions was anchored
in the East River under the protection of the guns of
a man-of-war called the
Asia
. Hale went to General
Heath and obtained permission to attempt the capture
of the supply vessel. With a few dozen picked men
as resolute as himself, he embarked in a small boat at
midnight and reached the side of the sloop unobserved
by the sentinel. The young New Englander followed
by his men sprang aboard the vessel, secured the sentinel,
confined the crew below the hatches, raised the
boatâs anchor and took her into the wharf just at the
dawn of day. It was a dashing adventure and it was
successful. He was the hero of the hour, especially
among his fellow Americans, when the supplies were
distributed among them. For many months after this
he continued the routine work of a captain in the Revolutionary
Army, and it was not until the 7th of September
192

that he was called upon to take part in the thrilling
exploit which was to end in such a disastrous and
tragic manner. Washington had called a council of
war to decide whether he should defend or abandon
New York. He had already asked Congress this important
question and he was answered by a resolution
that in case he should find it necessary to quit New
York he should have special care taken that no damage
be done to the city. As a result of this he resolved to
remain and defend the city.

General Washington had at this time made his headquarters
at the house of Robert Murray. The position
of his army was exceedingly perilous, ships of war
having already passed up the East River. Scouts
reported great activity among the British troops, but
they were unable, after great efforts, to gain any intelligent
idea of the intentions of the enemy. Yet Washington
knew that it was most essential that he should
have this information. He wrote to General Heath,
then staying at Kings Bridge.

âAs everything in a manner depends upon intelligence
of the enemyâs motions, I do most earnestly
entreat you and General Clinton to exert yourselves to
accomplish this most desirable thing. Leave no stone
unturned nor do not stick at expense to bring this to
pass, as I was never more uneasy than on account of
my want of knowledge on this score. Keep a constant
lookout with good glasses on some commanding
heights that look well on to the other shore.â

What Washington desired to know more than anything
else was whether the British would make a direct
193

attack upon the city, and if they did whether they
intended to land upon the island above the city or Morrisania,
beyond the Harlem River. The general in his
perplexity called another council of war at Murrayâs.
At this conference it was resolved to send some courageous
and competent person in disguise into the British
camps on Long Island. The person needed was
one skilled in military and scientific knowledge and a
good draftsmanâin short a man on whose judgment
and fidelity they could absolutely depend. In this
emergency Washington sent for Lieutenant Colonel
Noulton and told him just what he wanted. In
response Noulton summoned a number of officers to a
conference at his quarters and in the name of the commander-in-chief
called for volunteers. They were
taken by surprise. There was a general reluctance to
engage in the work of a spy. For a time it looked as
if it would be impossible to obtain a man for the service,
but at the last moment a young soldier who had
been ill entered the room and learning the nature of the
request called out:

âI will undertake the work.â

It was Captain Nathan Hale. Everybody was
amazed, not the least among them being Lieutenant
Colonel Noulton. Some of the others, who knew and
loved Hale, privately endeavored to persuade him to
reconsider his decision. They pointed out his hopes
for the future and explained the ignominy and death
to which he might be exposed. One of his dearest
friends, William Hull, who was afterwards a general
in the War of 1812, and who was a member of his
194

company and had been his classmate at college, was
especially fervid in trying to turn him from the perilous
task, but Hale had made up his mind and would not
change it. He said with great warmth:

âGentlemen, I am satisfied that I owe to my country
the accomplishment of an object so important and
so much desired by the commander of her armies, and
I know of no mode of obtaining the information except
by assuming a disguise and passing into the enemyâs
camp. I am fully sensible of the consequences of discovery
and capture in such circumstances, but for a
year I have been attached to the army and have not
rendered any material service, while receiving a compensation
for which I made no return. Yet I am not
influenced by any expectation of promotion or pecuniary
reward. I wish to be useful; and every kind of
service necessary for the public good becomes honorable
by being necessary. If the exigencies of my country
demand a peculiar service its claims to the performance
of that service are imperious.â

These words, thrilling with their patriotism, silenced
the objections of his fellow soldiers. That very afternoon
in company with Noulton he appeared before
Washington and received instructions concerning his
mission. He was provided with the necessary authority
and also given a general order to the owners of all
American vessels to convey him to any point on Long
Island which he might designate.

He left the camp on Harlem Heights that night
accompanied by Sergeant Stephen Hempstead. With
him also was his servant, Ansel Wright. It was not
195

until they had reached Norwalk, fifty miles from New
York, that they found a safe place to cross the Sound.
Here Hale exchanged his regimentals for citizenâs
dress of brown cloth and a broad brimmed round hat.
He directed his two companions to remain there until
his return and also deposited with Hempstead his uniform
and his military commission. Hale crossed the
Sound to Huntingdon Bay where he landed disguised
in the character of schoolmaster and Royalist who was
disgusted with the Rebel forces. He entered the British
camps in this disguise and was received with much
enthusiasm by the Redcoats, who accepted him as an
ally. It is known that he visited all the British camps
on Long Island and made observations openly; that he
passed over from Brooklyn to New York City and that
he gathered considerable information concerning the
condition of the British army at that place. So far he
had been entirely successful in his mission.

On his return he safely reached the point on the
Long Island shore where he had first landed, and he
prepared to recross the Sound at Norwalk the first
thing in the following morning. He wore shoes with
loose inner soles and between the soles he had concealed
the drawings he made of the fortifications and also
other memoranda written in Latin on thin paper. Perfectly
satisfied that he was safe from harm and filled
with the thought that his mission had ended successfully,
he calmly awaited the coming of daylight. His
attention was attracted by the proximity of an inn
known as âThe Cedars.â This place was managed by
a widow who was a staunch Loyalist. It was well
196

known as the resort of the Tories in that part of
the country. Hale was familiar with these facts, but
was not disturbed at the thought of any personal
danger.

The light in the window of âThe Cedarsâ attracted
him. It was necessary that he should have refreshments
and lodgings. He felt perfectly safe now, considering
that he was far away from the danger zone,
and besides felt that his simple attire would protect
him from prying eyes. Accordingly he strolled into
the tavern and secured a room for the night. After
that he went to the main room and ordered supper.
The place was fairly crowded and the entrance of Hale
apparently attracted no attention.

He took his ease, supping leisurely and listening with
interest to the gossip of the loungers about the room.
âThe Cedarsâ was notoriously a resort for Tories and
the young American was forced to listen to some conversation
which he surely did not relish. But he had
a sense of humor as well as a philosophy of his own
and the blatant talk of the so-called Royalists did not
disturb the serenity of his disposition. Indeed, there
is reason to believe that the romantic side of the young
man was attracted by the novelty of the situation.
âThe Cedarsâ was a quaint old inn. The customary
shingle, offering refreshments for âman and beastâ
swung outside in the wind; mine host with a long white
apron served beer in great stone mugs, and the patrons
of the place sprawled about the tables smoking long
stemmed pipes. They talked of war and they talked
of spies, little thinking that an American officer who
197

was just finishing an important mission was listening
to all they had to say.

In the midst of the hub-bub a stranger entered the
room. He caught one glance of Nathan Hale and then
turned his face with the suddenness of one who has
made a startling discovery. The next moment Hale
had looked up, but too late to get a good view of the
manâs face. He caught the merest glance of the guilty
countenance, and from that moment his mind was
haunted with a resemblance which it was impossible to
fix with any certainty. The newcomer was in civilianâs
dress. He wore his hair long and was square-shouldered.
He spoke to no one and disappeared as
silently as he had entered.

There can be no doubt that he is the man who
betrayed Hale to the British. But there has always
been real doubt concerning his identity. It is hinted
that Hale himself said that the fellow resembled a distant
cousin. But there is nothing on record to prove
this disagreeable suspicion. Indeed, from that moment,
there seems to have been an attempt to conceal
all of the facts concerning Haleâs dramatic arrest and
tragic death. Can this have been part of the plan to
protect the informer? Over one hundred and forty
years have passed since then and history still asks the
name of the man who entered âThe Cedarsâ on that
fateful night in September, 1775.

Nathan Hale spent the night at this tavern, and at
daylight the next morning he went out to search for the
boat that was to convey him to the other side of the
Sound. To his immense satisfaction he saw a craft
198

moving towards the shore with several men in it. He
had not the least doubt but that they were his friends
and he hastened to the beach in order to meet it. As
the boat touched the shore a half dozen British marines
jumped out and surrounded him. He turned as if to
run when a harsh voice exclaimed:

âSurrender instantly, or you die!â

Too late he realized that he had walked into a trap.
He saw six men standing there erect with muskets
levelled at his heart. It was folly to struggle. He
was seized, taken into the barge and conveyed to the
British guardship
Halifax
. His captors stripped and
searched him and found the evidence of his mission
concealed between the soles of his shoes. The unfortunate
American was taken in one of the boats of the

Halifax
to General Howeâs headquarters, which were
then in the mansion of James Beekman at Mount
Pleasant. This place contained among other things a
great greenhouse filled with shrubbery and plants. In
this greenhouse Hale was confined under a strong
guard on the night of September 21. The following
morning he was taken before Howe, who, without the
formality of a trial, condemned him to be hung. He
was delivered into the custody of William Cunningham
with orders that he should be executed before sunrise
the following day.

History informs us that when Hale was taken before
Howe he frankly acknowledged the purpose of his
mission.

âI was present at the interview,â wrote a British
officer, âand I observed that the frankness, the manly
199

bearing and the evident disinterested patriotism of the
young prisoner touched a tender cord in General
Howeâs nature; but the stern rules of war concerning
such offenses would not allow him to exercise even
pity.â

It was on a Sunday morning that Nathan Hale was
marched to the place of execution, which was in the
vicinity of what is now East Broadway and Market
Street. He was escorted by a file of soldiers and was
permitted to sit in a tent while waiting for the necessary
preparations for his death. The young patriot
asked for a chaplain but his request was brutally
denied. He asked for a Bible, but this also was
refused. It was only at the solicitation of a young
officer in whose tent Hale sat that he was allowed to
write brief letters to his mother, sisters and the young
girl to whom he was betrothed. She was Alice
Adams, a native of Canterbury, Connecticut, and distinguished
both for her intelligence and personal
beauty. Who could imagine the feelings that filled
the young patriot as he penned his final words to the
girl who was pledged to be his wife.

But imagine the scene a moment later when these
tender epistles were handed to Cunningham. That
officer read them with growing anger. He became
furious as he realized the noble spirit which breathed in
every word. He resolved that they should not be
given to the world, and with an oath tore them into
bits before the face of his victim. It was twilight on
that beautiful September morning when Hale was led
to his execution. The gallows was the limb of an
200

apple tree in Colonel Rutgerâs orchard. The young
martyr was asked if he had anything to say. He
turned to his executioner and in a calm clear voice
said:

âI only regret that I have but one life to lose for
my country.â

Nathan Hale

His body was buried near the spot where he died
and a British officer was sent to acquaint Washington
with the fate of his young messenger. A rude stone
placed by the side of the grave of his father in the
burial ground of the Congregational Church in his
native town for many years revealed to passersby the
fact that it was âIn Commemoration of Nathan Hale,
Esquire, a Captain in the Army of the United States,
who was Born June Sixth, 1755, and Received the
First Honors of Yale College, September 17, 1773,
and Resigned His Life a Sacrifice to His Countryâs
Liberty at New York, September 22, 1776, Age Twenty-two.â

Sixty years ago, long before there was a monument
to the memory of Hale, George Gibbs, librarian of the
New York Historical Society, wrote this epitaph,
which is worthy of preservation:

STRANGER, BENEATH THIS STONE

LIES THE DUST OF

A SPY,

WHO PERISHED UPON THE GIBBET;

YET

THE STORIED MARBLES OF THE GREAT,

THE SHRINES OF HEROES,

ENTOMBED ONE NOT MORE WORTHY OF

201
HONOR

THAN HIM WHO HERE

SLEEPS HIS LAST SLEEP.

NATIONS

BOW WITH REVERENCE BEFORE THE DUST

OF HIM WHO DIES

A GLORIOUS DEATH,

URGED ON BY THE SOUND OF THE

TRUMPET

AND THE SHOUTS OF

ADMIRING THOUSANDS

BUT WHAT REVERENCE, WHAT HONOR,

IS NOT DUE TO ONE,

WHO FOR HIS COUNTRY ENCOUNTERED

EVEN AN INFAMOUS DEATH,

SOOTHED BY NO SYMPATHY,

ANIMATED BY NO PRAISE!

The simple narrative of Nathan Haleâs life and
death effectively disposes of the tradition that he undertook
his perilous mission reluctantly or that he had
any scruples about essaying the rÃ´le of a spy. He
regarded that task as part of the dayâs workâan
unpleasant part to be sure, but one of the things that
had to be cheerfully undertaken in the line of duty.

But there is one phase of the tragic business that is
shrouded in mystery and it is the story of his betrayal.
Who was the strange man in âThe Cedarsâ? Was
he a cousin? Was he a Tory? Do the descendants
of that man still live in New York City and what must
their feelings be when they read the inscription upon
the monument to the young patriot and martyr?

Until these questions have been answered and until
this mystery has been made clear the story of Nathan
Hale will be incomplete.

MAJOR LE CARON AND THE FENIAN
INVASION OF CANADA

If
there is one name in Ireland that is more cordially
detested than another it is that of Thomas Beach,
the spy, who is better known by his adopted name
of Major Henri Le Caron. The story of how he came
to assume that cognomen, and the manner in which he
served the government of Great Britain as against his
supposed co-patriots furnishes one of the most interesting
chapters in the Secret Service of England, if not
of the world.

Beach defends his work on the ground that when he
was first brought into contact with Fenianism he had no
ulterior motive in mind and that no material consideration
prompted him to work against the men who
hoped to bring about the freedom of Ireland by the
spectacular invasion of Canada. He says that he was
forced by a variety of circumstances to play a part he
had never sought, but he insists that he did nothing to
be ashamed of and has never felt any regret for the
manner in which he served England. He says that
there is no truth in the popular belief which credited
him with receiving fabulous payments and frequent
rewards. He admits that there was ever-present danger
and constantly recurring difficulties, but very scant
206

recompense from the Government for which he risked
so much.

Beach was born in England, but came to the United
States just about the time of the beginning of the Civil
War and enlisted in the Union Armyâin the 8th
Pennsylvanian Reserves. But in enlisting he took on
himself a new name and a new nationality. One reason
he gives for this was his desire to avoid giving his
parents anxiety. Also he thought it would be âa
good joke.â Be that as it may, he was put down on
the books of his company as Henri Le Caron and his
home as France. He served through the greater part
of the war, and after it was over became connected
with the Grand Army of the Republic, holding among
other positions those of Vice Commander and Post
Surgeon, with the rank of major.

MAJOR LE CARON (THOMAS BEACH)

So from that time until the end of the chapter he was
known as Major Le Caron, and he says that this
afforded him an effective disguise through which he
was enabled to keep the English authorities informed
of the Irish movements on this side of the Atlantic.

It was through an Irishman named OâNeill that Le
Caron became connected with the Fenian movement.
He wrote home at intervals and he says that the information
which was thus informally given to his family
was by them taken to the Home Secretary in London,
and in the course of time Le Caron became a regularly
paid spy in the Secret Service. The consequences of
this was that the proposed invasion of Canada was well
known to the English and Canadian officials long
before it occurred. The first invasion, with which
207

Le Caron does not seem to have been personally connected
occurred on the morning of June 1, 1866. For
six months before that time active preparations were in
progress. During the spring of the year many companies
of soldiers, armed and uniformed, were being
drilled in a number of cities in the United States.
Thousands of stands of arms and millions of rounds of
ammunition had been purchased and located at different
points along the Canadian border.

The relations between the United States and England
were not very cordial at that time because of the
attitude of England during the Civil War, and as a
consequence the proposed invasion, if it was not encouraged,
was not greatly discouraged in this country.
The attempt, however, proved a failure. The Fenians
were defeated and driven out of Canada. Sixty of
them were killed and more than two hundred taken
prisoners. It was the natural result that is to be looked
for when a volunteer force goes against a well trained
army. Under the command of General John OâNeill
800 Irish patriots were towed across the Niagara River
to a point on the Canadian side called Waterloo. At
four oâclock in the morning the Irish flag was planted
on British soil by Colonel Owen Starr, and from thence
the patriots marched to and captured Fort Erie, containing
a detachment of the Welland Battery.

The effect of the news of this first victory was electrical
in the United States. Thousands who had hesitated
about joining the movement were now willing
and anxious to enlist. The Canadian Government,
and Le Caron in his official reports to London endeavored
208

to belittle this initial triumph, but they felt very
much chagrined just the same. However, the Irish
victory was short-lived. As soon as the news of the
capture of Fort Erie spread to Toronto, the 22nd Battalion
of Volunteers of that city hastened to the rescue,
and at Ridgeway a bloody battle occurred between the
opposing forces. The invaders were driven back to
Fort Erie and later were taken as prisoners by the
United States battleship
Michigan
.

The news of the temporary victory had a wonderful
effect in the United States. By the 7th of June not
less than 30,000 men had assembled in and around
Buffalo, prepared to fight if it was deemed desirable.
But the defeat of the detachment that had actually
entered Canada, and the issuance of a neutrality proclamation
by President Andrew Johnson ended the war
for the time being. The prisoners were released on
their own recognizance and sent home by the United
States authorities. The arms seized by the American
Government were returned to the Fenian organization,
and if Dame Rumor is not a falsifier, were used for a
second invasion of Canada four years later.

In 1869 Le Caron was so intimate with his Fenian
friends that he was made an inspector general of the
Irish Republican Army. After that he was assistant
adjutant general with the rank of colonel, and his new
position enabled him not only to become possessed of
the originals of many important documents and plans
of proposed campaigns, but also specimens of the Fenian
army commissions which he promptly conveyed
to the officials of the Canadian Government. In this
209

work he was assisted by a number of officials from
Canada. Speaking of this, he says:

âSuccessful as I was in avoiding detection through
all this work, those assisting me in my secret service
capacity were not always destined to share in my good
luck. This has been particularly the case on one occasion.
I was at the time shipping arms at Malone, N.Â Y.,
and attended on behalf of the Canadian Government
by one of the staff men placed at my disposal for
the purpose of immediate communication and the transit
of any documents requiring secrecy and dispatch as
well as for personal protection should such prove necessary.
This man, John C. Rose, was one of the most
faithful and trusted servants of the Canadian administration,
and for months he followed me along the
whole border.

âThough stopping at the same hotels and in constant
communication with me, no suspicion was aroused
until his identity was accidentally disclosed by a visitor
from the seat of government to one of the Fenians
located at Malone. Men were immediately set to
watch him without my knowledge, and the fact of his
being found always in my wake on my visits to and
from several towns led to the belief that he was spying
upon my actions. A few nights after this poor Rose
on his return from sending a dispatch from the postoffice,
was waylaid, robbed and brutally beaten, and
subsequently brought back to the hotel in as sorry a
plight as I ever saw.â

In the meantime, in the winter of 1869, the Fenian
Senate announced the completion of the arrangements
210

for the invasion of Canada, and early in February
the following year circulars were sent out to the military
officers of the Fenian Brotherhood, instructing
them to prepare for the proposed campaign. Those
Brothers whose business or family duties prevented
them from getting their commands in readiness for
active and immediate service were requested to forward
their resignations at once and at the same time
send on the names of persons suitable to take their
places. They were told to ascertain and report how
many of their own men could furnish their own transportation,
and in the meantime to try and persuade all
of them to save enough for that purpose.

On Saturday, April 22, 1870, General OâNeill and
Le Caron left Buffalo for St. Albans, the general being
filled with enthusiasm over the belief that the Canadians
would be taken entirely by surprise, and Le Caron
laughing in his sleeve at the thought of how his companion
would be fooled. OâNeillâs plan was to get
across the boundary line without delay and then to
entrench himself at a point where his soldiers would
form the nucleus around which a large army and
unlimited support would rally from the United States.
Buffalo, Malone, and Franklin were the three points
from which attacks were to be made. OâNeill
expected 1,000 men to meet him at Franklin, on the
night of April 25, 1870. Only a quarter of that number
presented themselves, and by the following morning
not more than 500 had mustered. Every hourâs
delay added to the danger of failure and collapse. All
this time Le Caron was busy sending messages across
211

the border carrying full details as to the time the Fenians
would leave Franklin, the exact points at which
they would cross the border, their numbers, and the
places of their contemplated operation.

On April 26 OâNeill left the Franklin Hotel to place
himself at the head of the Fenian Army. Hubbardâs
Farm, the Fenian camp and rendezvous, was about
half a mile from Franklin, and here all of the available
soldiers had been mustered. Arranging them in line,
OâNeill, according to Le Caronâs narrative, addressed
them as follows:

âSoldiers, this is the advance guard of the Irish-American
army for the liberation of Ireland from
the yoke of the oppressor. For the sake of your
own country you enter that of the enemy. The
eyes of your countrymen are upon you. Forward,
march!â

Following this harangue they started off on their
expedition with OâNeill at their head. Before leaving,
OâNeill instructed Le Caron to bring to his support
on their arrival a party of 400 men who were coming
from St. Albans. The men marched with a certain
amount of military precision for all of them had
received some degree of military training. There is
no doubt of the patriotic feelings that filled their
hearts. In spite of the lack of uniformity, and possibly
because of it, the scene was picturesque. Here and
there a Fenian coat with its green and gray faced with
gold sparkled in contrast with the civilian clothing
and the more somber garb of the others.

Finally the volunteers reached a little wooden bridge
212

and deployed as skirmishers in close order, advancing
with fixed bayonets and cheering wildly. Not a soldier
appeared to dispute their way, but the dark Canadian
trees hid from their view the ambushed Canadian
volunteers, who were only awaiting the signal to spring
out upon the unsuspecting invaders.

All this time Le Caron, who had spent years of intimate
association with many of the Irishmen and who
was regarded as their friend and confidant, stood upon
the hilltop to watch the inevitable slaughter. They
advanced a few yards farther, and on their startled
ears came the whistling sound of many bullets from
the rifles of the ambushed Canadians as they poured
a deadly volley straight into their ranks.

Little remains to be told. There was fierce fighting
and terrible bloodshed, but the invaders were overcome
by superior numbers and well disciplined troops.
Finally they were forced to retreat up to the hill where
Le Caron stood, still under the fire of their adversaries
and leaving their dead to be subsequently buried by the
Canadians.

Seeing that all was over, for the time at least, the
spy had hurried off to the point where the St. Albans
contingent had arrived and were forming. He
actually took part in this ceremony, and while engaged
in superintending it he was afforded, as he says, practical
evidence of the termination of OâNeillâs part in the
fight. While he was standing in the middle of the
road where the men were forming into line, he was
startled by the cry:

âClear the road, clear the road!â

213

He was almost knocked down by a team of horses
pulling a covered carriage, and as the conveyance
flashed by him he caught through the carriage window
a hurried glimpse of the dejected face of General
OâNeill, who was seated between two men. He said in
speaking of this that he might have given the command
to shoot the horses as they turned an adjacent corner,
but it was no part of his purpose to restore OâNeill to
his command.

It became known later that OâNeill was in the custody
of the United States Marshal, General Foster,
who, acting under instructions from Washington, had
arrived on the scene of the battle immediately after Le
Caron left and arrested OâNeill on the charge of breaking
the neutrality laws. OâNeill, who was in the company
of his comrades, refused to surrender and threatened
force, but when General Foster placed a revolver
at his head he succumbed.

Late that afternoon when the news of OâNeillâs
arrest became known, a council of war was held, presided
over by John Boyle OâReilly. On the following
morning General Spear, the secretary of war of the
Fenian Brotherhood, arrived at St. Albans and tried to
do something practical in the way of continuing the
invasion. He pleaded with Le Caron to supply him
with 400 or 500 stands of arms and ammunition within
the next twenty-four hours, but the spy felt that it
would not do for him to allow further operations, and
so he said that it would be impossible to grant the
demands under the condition of affairs then prevailing.
Thousands of Canadian troops had arrived on the border
214

and were making the position of the Irish volunteers
more precarious every moment.

Fortunately for Le Caron, the appearance of United
States troops in the vicinity put any further attempt at
war operations out of the question, for in order to
avoid arrest for a breach of the neutrality laws the
Fenians were compelled to disappear. The spy left
with them and hurried to Malone and found a similar
state of affairs prevailing there, although the arrest of
OâNeill and the anticipated appearance of United
States troops filled the invaders with dismay.

Le Caron was elated with his success and anxious to
report himself at the Canadian headquarters without
delay. He knew, however, that it would not be safe
for him to go direct to Ottawa so he traveled in a
roundabout way. One night he stopped with the Commissioner
of the Quebec police, and the following
morning took a train for Ottawa. Before this journey
was concluded he found that he had been altogether
too premature in his self congratulations,
because that journey brought him closer to discovery
than he had ever been before.

The incident which threatened to deprive him of his
usefulness as a spy occurred at Cornwall where there
was the usual half hourâs delay for dinner. He was
in the midst of his meal, enjoying it with great zest in
spite of the fact that his work as a spy had sent hundreds
of men to their death, when two men stopped and
gazed at him with unusual interest. One of them was
tall and very military in his manner, and the other
had on clerical attire. As Le Caron ceased eating he
215

heard the clerical looking one say as he pointed his
finger in his direction:

âThat is the man!â

Advancing, the tall man, who subsequently turned
out to be the Mayor of Cornwall, said with a Scotch
accent:

âYou are my prisoner!â

These words were accompanied with a strong grasp
of the hand on the shoulder of the suspected one. He
imagined there was some mistake, and laughed as he
turned around to resume his dinner, but the Scotchman
gave an added squeeze to his arm as he solemnly
repeated the words:

âYou are my prisoner, and you must go with me
at once.â

It turned out later that the ministerial looking person
was a wandering preacher who happened to be in
the vicinity of Malone when Le Caron was loading
arms there and he had been pointed out to him as the
leading Fenian agent. The preacherâs memory was a
very good one, and he immediately recognized the spy
when he met him again.

It was a serious condition of affairs for Le Caron,
but still he could not entirely comprehend what it all
meant, and he said:

âWill not you let me finish my dinner?â

âNo,â was the sharp reply, âyou have got to come
at once.â

âFor what reason am I arrested?â asked Le Caron.

âYou are a Fenian,â was the indignant reply, and
then for the first time the spy noticed that the crowd in
216

the room was beginning to show signs of anger and
indignation toward him.

He was hurried out by his captors and taken to a
room adjoining the ticket office, where a demand was
made on him for his luggage and keys with everything
on his person. He had with him documents which
would reveal everything if they were made public.
His position was dangerous, as he puts it âdistinctly
dangerous.â

In this emergency he asked the Mayor for a few
minutesâ private conversation, and it was accorded
him. They went inside the ticket office and Le Caron
told him the exact situation. It was true, he admitted,
that he had been working with the Fenians, but he was
also a Government agent. In fact he was a British
spy who had been keeping the Canadian officials
informed of the details of the proposed invasion. He
said that he was then on his way to Ottawa to see
Judge McMicken. He said that to delay or expose
him would mean serious difficulty to the Government.

His manner must have impressed the Mayor, for he
decided to send him on to Ottawa in charge of an escort
with instructions to find out from Judge McMicken
whether his story was to be believed. The details of
Le Caronâs arrest as a Fenian quickly spread amongst
his fellow passengers and the reception he received
along the journey was not very agreeable, so for
safetyâs sake the lieutenant transferred him to the
care of a sergeant and two other soldiers. The carriage
in which they traveled was the sole point of
attraction in the train, and the Canadians, crowding
217

around this carriage, hissed and hooted him, while their
cries of âHang him! Lynch him!â gave him a very
uncomfortable idea of what would happen if he were
left alone amongst them.

On reaching Prescott junction Le Caron found the
news of his capture had preceded him and created such
a sensation that a special correspondent of the
Toronto
Globe
had traveled to meet him in order to find out
who and what he was and everything about him. The
spy of course refused to have anything to say. When
the party arrived at Ottawa a representative of Judge
McMicken was waiting for him at the station. He
was conveyed to the police station without delay, and
there the judge heard the details of his capture and
received possession of his person and gave a formal
receipt for his custody. After the guard left the judge
listened to the recital of the spy and arranged that his
identity should not become public. He also supplied
him with needful funds to leave Canada. This came
in the form of a check and it was necessary to have
some one cash it. This was done at one of the clubs
in Ottawa and the amount of the checkâ$350.00âcaused
the club porter to speak of it to some of his
friends. This porter knew that Le Caron was the
Fenian prisoner and he let out the secret a little later.
It became public property and the Canadian press published
the fact that an important Fenian had been in
Ottawa immediately after the raid and received a
large sum of money from a Government official with
whom he was in communication, adding that the Fenians
must have been nicely duped all through.

218

Le Caron was very much disturbed by this publication.
It was bringing danger very close to him, and
yet strange as it may appear, suspicion did not rest
upon him in connection with the newspaper story. He
drove from Ottawa in the night and got safely home,
not being troubled afterwards by any of the events of
that fateful invasion into Canada.

Le Caron studied medicine after that and subsequently
became connected with the Clan-na-Gael. He
became one of the members of the military board of
organization and in that capacity continued to send
information to his friends at Scotland Yard. While
he was in this organization he became acquainted with
many of its leading members who believed that he was
really a friend of Ireland and who never suspected that
he was connected with the British Government and
was regularly receiving compensation for the information
which he sent from time to time to the home office
in London.

Le Caron continued to serve as an English spy for
nearly twenty years after the Fenian invasion of Canada.
His part in that affairâor at least the part he
played in keeping the Canadian and English governments
informed of the movements of the Irish patriotsâwas
never suspected by the men with whom he was
associated and with whom he lived on such intimate
terms. He was in constant communication with Mr.
Anderson, the head of Scotland Yard, and his letters
to that official, if gathered together, would make a
volume in themselves. On one occasion when he was
leaving America for a trip abroad he was entrusted
219

with letters to Patrick Egan and other Irish leaders.
He met Egan in Paris, and spent weeks with him in
visiting places of interest in the French capital. They
attended the theater together and dined at various
restaurants in company, and Le Caron proudly boasts
that he never had to spend a penny, because Egan
insisted upon being the host at their various entertainments.

But it was when the famous suit of Parnell against
the
London Times
was tried that the spy was at last
revealed in his true light. He says of that event:

âOn Tuesday morning, the 5th of February, 1889,
the curtain was rung up, and throwing aside the mask
forever, I stepped into the witness box and came out in
my true colors, as an Englishman, proud of his country,
and in no sense ashamed of his record in her services.â

His one complaint was that he had been treated badly
in the matter of his pay by the British Government.
He said that âthe miserable pittance doled out for the
purpose of fighting the Clan-na-Gael becomes perfectly
ludicrousâ in the light of the service he was called on
to perform.

It all depends upon the way in which the business
is regarded, and there are still a great many persons
that will resent the effort of Thomas Beach, or Major
Henri Le Caron, to place a halo about his head.

XV

HOW EMMA EDMONDS PENETRATED
THE CONFEDERATE LINES

This
is a leaf from the life of an extraordinary
woman who served as a nurse and a spy in the
Union army during the Civil War in the United
States, and who was a pronounced success in both
capacities. Few women that have passed through such
thrilling adventures are so little known to fame, yet if
the patient seeker be willing to spare the time and the
labor he may find in the files of the War Department
at Washington reports in her handwriting which had a
material influence upon more than one battle during
the four years of the war.

Emma Edmonds was an adopted American. She
was born and educated in the province of New Brunswick,
but came to the United States at an early age.
She was passing through New York on her way to her
future home in New England when the newspapers
appeared on the street with the announcement of the
fall of Fort Sumter, and President Lincolnâs call for
seventy-five thousand men. That happening changed
the entire course of her life. Ten days later she had
been enrolled as a field nurse in the Union army, and
was in Washington waiting to be detailed for duty.

The first assignment came sooner than was expected.
224

Almost before she knew it she was in the thick of the
work that followed the battle of Manassas. She spent
three hours with other nurses in caring for the needs
of the menâeven while the battle was in progress.
Presently the enemy made a desperate charge on the
Union troops, driving them back and taking possession
of the spring from which they obtained their water.
The chaplainâs horse was shot from under him and
bled to death in a little while. Not long afterwards
Colonel Cameron, brother of the Secretary of War,
came dashing along the line shouting:

âCome on, boys, theyâre in full retreat!â

The words had scarcely been uttered when he fell,
pierced to the heart by a bullet. It was mortal and all
that the nurse could do was to fold his arms, close his
eyes and leave him in the cold embrace of death. And
all the while the battle raged about them. This was
but one of a score of incidents that prepared a frail
woman for the breath-taking career which she was to
follow during the four years of the Civil Warâincidents
which are more thrilling than those to be found
in the pages of the most exciting fiction.

All of this was preliminary to Emma Edmondsâ work
as a spy. One morning a detachment of the Thirty-seventh
New York Regiment that had been sent out on
scouting duty returned with several prisoners and the
statement that one of the Federal spies had been captured
and executed. There was regret, not alone over
the death of the man, but also because a valuable soldier
had been lost to the United States Secret Service.
Incidentally it brought the opportunity for which the
225

fearless woman had been waiting. She was told that
she might have the opportunity of becoming a spy if
she fully realized the danger and the responsibility that
was attached to the post. She considered it carefully
and said that if appointed she would accept and do the
best she knew how for the Government.

Her name was sent to headquarters, and she was
soon summoned to appear there herself. She was
questioned and cross-questioned at some length; she
was examined at length as to her knowledge of firearms,
and finally the oath of allegiance was administered
and she became a regular commissioned spy for
the Federal army. It was at once decided that she
should adopt a disguise and attempt to penetrate the
Confederate lines.

In the first place she purchased a suit of contraband
clothing, real plantation style such as the male negroes
wore, and then went to a barber and had her hair
sheared close to her head. After that, by the use of
stains and dyes she colored her face, and then she was
ready for business. It might be well to state, at this
stage of the narrative, that Emma Edmonds while in
the secret service penetrated the enemyâs lines, in various
disguises, no less than eleven times; always with
complete success and without detection.

She started on her first expedition toward the Confederate
capitol with the greatest confidence imaginable.
With a few hard crackers in her pocket and her
revolver loaded and capped she began the journey on
foot, and without a blanket or any other kind of baggage
that might excite suspicion. At half-past nine
226

oâclock at night she passed the outer picket line of the
Union army and at twelve oâclock was within the Confederate
lines without once being halted by a sentinel.
Once she passed within ten rods of a Confederate
picket without being detected.

As soon as she had gone a safe distance from the
picket lines she lay down and rested until morning.
The night was chilly and the ground damp and she
passed the weary hours in fear and trembling. The
first thing in the morning she met a party of negroes
carrying hot coffee and provisions to the Confederate
pickets. This was most fortunate for she made their
acquaintance, and after securing a hot breakfast she
marched into Yorktown with them without eliciting the
slightest suspicion. The negroes went to work at once
on fortifications that were being erected, and the spy
was left by herself. But an officer seeing her a few
minutes later turned to an overseer and said:

âTake that black rascal and set him to work, and if
he donât work well tie him up and give him twenty
lashes.â

So saying he rode away, and the disguised one was
conducted to a breastwork which was in course of erection
and where there were about a hundred negroes
at work. She was soon furnished with a pick and
shovel and a wheelbarrow and put to work. It was
hardâhard enough for the strongest man, but with
occasional assistance from some kind-hearted darky
she managed to do her part. All day long she worked
in this manner until her hands were blistered and
her back nearly broken. When night came she was
227

released from her toil and was free to go where she
pleased. She made good use of her liberty. She
wandered about the place and made out a brief report
of the mounted guns she found in her ramble around
the fort. There were fifteen three-inch rifle cannon,
eighteen four and a half inch rifle cannon, twenty-nine
thirty-two pounders, twenty-three eight-inch Columbiads,
eleven nine-inch Dalgrens, thirteen ten-inch Columbiads,
fourteen ten-inch mortars and seven eight-inch
siege howitzers.

This capitulation must sound strange to those
acquainted with present-day methods of warfare, but
it was all very important to the spy, who made out her
list with the greatest care. After that she made a
rough sketch of the outer works, and placing the precious
papers under the inner sole of her contraband
shoe she returned to the negro quarters. She did not
want to stay with them, but she did wish to find some
one among them who would change places with her on
the following day. She was fortunate in discovering
a lad of about her own size who was engaged in carrying
water to the troops. He said he would take her
place next day and he thought he could find a friend to
do the same thing the following day, for which evidence
of brotherly kindness the female spy offered him
$5.00 in greenbacks, which, he said, was more money
than he had ever seen in all of his life before. By this
arrangement Miss Edmonds escaped the scrutiny of
the overseer, who might have detected her disguise.

The second day in the Confederate service was pleasanter
than the first. She had only to supply one brigade
228

with water, which did not require much energy,
for the day was cool and the well not far distant. As
a result of this she had an opportunity of lounging
among the soldiers and of hearing important steps discussed.
In this way she learned the number of reÃ«nforcements
which had arrived from different places
and also had the pleasure of seeing General Lee, who
came there to consult with other Confederates. It
was whispered among the men that he had been telegraphed
to for the purpose of inspecting the fortifications,
as he was the best engineer in the Confederacy
and that he had pronounced it impossible to hold Yorktown
after McClellan opened his siege guns upon it.
General Johnson was hourly expected with a force at
his command, and including all, the Confederates estimated
their force in and around Yorktown at 150,000
men.

When General Johnson arrived a council of war was
held. Soon after that the report began to circulate
that the town was to be evacuated. It was at this
stage of the game that Miss Edmonds saw a man who
had been coming into the Federal camp as a peddler of
newspapers and stationery, and now here he was giving
the Confederates a full description of the Union
camp and the Union forces. She watched him closely
and discovered him displaying a map of the entire
works of McClellanâs position.

Miss Edmonds decided that it was of the utmost
importance for her to leave the camp of the enemy and
carry the information she possessed to the Union
headquarters. The important thing now was to leave
229

without being detected. On the evening of the third
day from the time she entered the camp of the enemy
she was sent in company with colored men to carry
supper to the outer picket posts. This was just what
she hoped and wished for. During the day she had
provided herself with a canteen of whisky. Some of
the men on picket duty were colored and others were
white, but calling them to her side she spread before
them corn cake and added to that a moderate amount
of whisky for dessert. While they were thus engaged
minnie balls were whistling around their heads, for the
picket lines of the two armies were not more than half
a mile distant from each other.

Not long after nightfall an officer came riding along
the lines, and seeing the spy there, wanted to know his
business. One of the darkies replied that she had
helped to carry out their supper and was waiting until
the Yankees stopped firing before she started back.
Turning to the disguised one, he said:

âYou come along with me. Iâll see that you have
something to occupy your mind.â

Miss Edmonds did as she was ordered and they went
back the way he had come until they had gone about
fifty rods, then halting in front of a petty officer he
said:

âPut this fellow on the post where that man was
shotâand see that he stays there until I return.â

So the spy was conducted a few rods farther and
then a rifle put in her hands, which she was told to use
freely in case she should see anybody or anything
approaching from the enemy. The officer, of course,
230

regarded her as an irresponsible negro, and after giving
her the assignment took her by the coat collar and
gave her a vigorous shake.

âNow, you black rascal,â he cried, âif I catch you
sleeping at your post Iâll shoot you like a dog.â

It was a startling position for a stranger in a strange
land, especially when that one happened to be a female
spy in disguise. The night was very dark and it was
beginning to rain. She was all alone now and she
could not guess when she would be relieved or just
what the next hour might bring forth. Her one
thought was to escape. After ascertaining as well as
possible the position of the picket on each side of herâeach
of whom was enjoying the shelter of the nearest
treeâshe deliberately and noiselessly stepped into
the darkness and was soon gliding swiftly through the
forest toward the Union lines. She had to make her
approach very carefully for she was in as much danger
of being shot by her friends as by the enemy, so
she spent the remainder of the night within hailing
distance of the Union lines, and with the first dawn of
morning hoisted the well known signal and was heartily
welcomed back to her own camp.

She made her way to the tent containing the hospital
nurses and removed as much of the color from
her face as was possible with the aid of soap and
water. She then made out a report and carried it to
the headquarters of General McClellan. He was intensely
interested in the news that had been brought
him and heartily congratulated the spy on her work.
The rifle which she had carried from the Confederate
231

lines was an object of much curiosity, and it is now
said to be in one of the museums in the national capitol
as a memento of the war.

It was several weeks before the female spy received
her second assignment, and then when it came a new
disguise was necessary. The African costume was
abandoned and she decided to go into the Confederate
lines this time in the capacity of an Irish apple woman,
so she procured the dress and outfit that was necessary
for this impersonation and also practiced the brogue
that might be needed to carry her through the emergency.
The bridges were not finished across the
Chickahominy when she was ready to cross the river,
so she packed up her new disguise in the cake and pie
basket and swam across the river mounted on her
horse, which was known as Frank. Reaching the
other side she dismounted and led him to the edge of
the water. Giving him a farewell pat she permitted
him to swim back to the other side, where a soldier
awaited his return.

It was night, and as she did not know the precise
distance to the enemyâs picket lines she thought it best
to avoid the road and consequently determined to
spend the night in the swamp. It required some time
to put on her new disguise and to feel at home in the
clothes. She whimsically said at the time that she
thought the best place for her dÃ©but as an apple woman
was the Chickahominy swamp. She did not propose
this time to pass the enemyâs lines in the night, but to
present herself at the picket line at a seasonable hour
and to ask admission as one of the fugitives of that
232

section who was flying at the approach of the Yankees.

In crossing the river she had her basket strapped on
her back and did not know that its contents were completely
drenched until she was required to use them.
Later she discovered with much terror that she was
suffering from fever and ague as a result of spending
the night in the wet clothing in that malaria infested
region. Her mind began to wander and she became
delirious. There seemed to be the horrors of a thousand
deaths centered around her. She was tortured
by fiends of every shape and magnitude, but morning
came at last and she was aroused from the nightmare
which had paralyzed her senses by the roar of the cannon
and the screaming of the shells.

The cannonading ceased in a few hours, but the
chills and fever clung to the spy and were her constant
companion for two days and two nights. At the end
of that time she was certainly an object of pity; with
no medicine or food and little strength, she was almost
in a state of starvation. Her pies and cakes were
spoiled and she had no means of procuring more. It
was nine oâclock in the morning of the third day after
crossing the river when she started to what she thought
was the enemyâs lines. She traveled from that time
until four oâclock in the afternoon and was then deeper
in the swamp than when she started. As it was a dark
day in every sense of the word, she had neither sun
nor compass to guide her, but at five oâclock the booming
of cannon came to her like music, because it was
the signal that would guide her out of the wilderness.
233

She turned her face in the direction of the scene of
action and soon after emerging from the swamp she
saw a small white house in the distance.

The house was deserted with the exception of a sick
Confederate soldier who lay on a straw tick on the
floor in a helpless condition. He had been ill with
typhoid fever and was very weak.

He told her, however, that the family who had occupied
the house had left some flour and corn meal but
did not have time to cook anything for him. This
was good news to the exhausted spy, and she soon
kindled a fire and in less than fifteen minutes a large
hoe cake was in the process of baking. She found
some tea packed away in a small basket and the cake
being cooked and the tea made she fed the poor famished
man as tenderly as if he had been her brother,
and after that she tended to the cravings of her own
appetite. But it was quite evident that the man could
not recover. He was dying. She did everything in
her power to make him comfortable, but it was quite
plain that he only had a few hours to live. While she
stood by his side he said:

âI have a last request to make. If you ever pass
through the Confederate camp between this and Richmond
inquire for Major McKee of General Ewellâs
staff and give him a gold watch which you will find
in my pocket. He will know what to do with it, and
tell him I died happy and peaceful.â

His name was Allen Hall. Taking a ring from his
finger he tried to put it on hers, but his strength failed
and after a pause he said:

234

âKeep that ring in memory of one whose sufferings
you have alleviated and whose soul has been refreshed
by your presence in the hour of dissolution.â

He folded his hands together as a little child would
do at its motherâs knee. She gave him some water,
raised the window and used her hat for a fan and then
sat down, as she put it, âAnd watched the last glimmering
spark of life go out from those beautiful windows
of the soul.â

He died at twelve oâclock that night and after the
involuntary nurse had wrapped the form of her late
patient in his winding sheet she laid down in a corner
of the room and slept soundly until six oâclock in the
morning. It was a curious situation, but it did not
seem to affect the nerve of this remarkable woman.
She cut a lock of hair from the head of the dead man,
took the watch and a small package of letters from his
pocket and left the house.

On examining the basket in which she had found
the tea she discovered a number of articles which assisted
her in assuming a more perfect disguise. There
was mustard, pepper, an old pair of green spectacles
and a bottle of red ink. Of the mustard she made a
strong plaster about the size of a silver dollar and tied
it on one side of her face until it blistered thoroughly.

She then removed the blister and put on a large
patch of black court plaster. After giving her pale
complexion a deep tinge with some ochre which she
found in a closet, she put on her green glasses and
Irish hat. She had previously made a tour of the
house to find the fixings which an Irish woman would
235

be supposed to carry with her in such an emergency,
for she fully expected to be searched before she was
admitted through the lines.

She followed the Richmond road about five miles
before meeting any one. At length she saw a sentinel
in the distance, but before he observed her she sat down
to rest and prepare her mind for the coming interview.
While thus waiting to have her courage reÃ«nforced,
she took from her basket the black pepper and sprinkled
a little of it on her pocket handkerchief, and then
applied the moisture to her eyes. The effect of it was
all that could be desired, for taking a view of her
face in a small mirror which she always carried, she
perceived that her eyes had a fine tender expression
which added very much to their beauty. She now
resumed her journey and displayed a flag of truce, a
window curtain which she had brought from the house
where she had stopped over night. As she came
nearer, the sentinel signaled for her to advance, which
she did as fast as she could under the circumstances.
He cross questioned her at some length and then permitted
her to pass along the road, saying that she might
go wherever she pleased.

After thanking the man for his kindness, she went
her way toward the Confederate camp. She had not
gone far when he called her back and advised her not
to stay in the camp over night, adding:

âOne of our spies has just come in and reported
that the Yankees have finished the bridges across the
Chickahominy and intend to attack us either to-day or
to-night, but Jackson and Lee are ready for them.
236

We have masked batteries in all parts of the road.
There is one over there thatâll give them fits, if they
come this way.â

This was important information, and Miss Edmonds
made up her mind at once that she must get all the
news that was possible before night and then make her
way back to the Union camp before the battle began.
At five oâclock that afternoon she met Major McKee,
and, carrying out the promise she made to the dying
Confederate, she delivered to him the watch and
package. She did not require any black pepper to
assist the tears in performing their duty, for the sad
mementoes which she had just delivered were a forcible
reminder of the scenes of the past night, and she
could not refrain from weeping. The major, grave
and stem as he was, sat there with his face between his
hands and sobbed like a child. Soon he rose to his
feet, surveyed her from head to foot and said:

âYou are a faithful woman and you shall be
rewarded.â

At his request she consented to show a detachment
of the guards the house where Allenâs body lay. They
made their way there cautiously, lest they should be
surprised by the Federals. Miss Edmonds rode at the
head of the little band of Confederates as a guide, not
knowing but that she was leading them into the jaws
of death. They traveled thus for five miles, silently,
thoughtfully and stealthily. The sun had gone down
when they came in sight of the little white cottage in
the forest where she had so recently spent such a
strange night. As they drew near and saw no sign
237

of approaching Federals, they regretted that they had
not brought an ambulance, but Miss Edmonds did not
regret it for the arrangement suited her admirably.
They were soon at the gate of the house. The sergeant
ordered the corporal to proceed inside with a
squad of men and bring out the corpse while he stationed
the remaining men to guard all the approaches
to the house. He then asked Miss Edmonds to ride
down the road a little way to watch out for the
Yankees with instructions to ride back as fast as possible
if she detected any of the hated tribe.

She assented joyfully. It was the very thing for
which she had been watching and waiting. She
turned and rode slowly down the road, but not seeing
or hearing anything of the Yankees whimsically
thought it best to keep on in that direction until she
did. She says that she was like the Zouave after the
battle of Bull Run who said he was ordered to retreat
but not being ordered to halt in any particular place
preferred to keep on until he reached New York. So
Miss Edmonds preferred to keep on until she reached
the Chickahominy where she reported all the information
she had gathered to the Federal general who was
in charge.

The news that she brought was of the highest
importance and proved to be of great assistance to the
officers in arranging their final plans for the forth-coming
battle. This was the last feat undertaken by
Miss Edmonds, and by a curious chain of circumstances
it enabled her to take part in one of the most
thrilling battles of the war.

238

The battle of Hanover Court House is counted
among the heroic engagements of that year, and was a
very important victory for the army of the Potomac.

Three days after this battle while the army was
divided by the Chickahominy River, a portion of the
troops having crossed over the day before, a most
fearful storm swept over the peninsula accompanied
by terrible exhibitions of lightning and explosions of
thunder. The water came down in torrents and there
were great floods, completely engulfing the valley
through which the Chickahominy flows and turning
the narrow stream into a broad river as well as converting
the swamps into lakes.

On the 30th of May, the enemy, taking advantage of
this terrible state of affairs, came rushing down upon
the Union troops in immense force. A battle opened
at about one oâclock in the afternoon and after three
hours of desperate fighting General Caseyâs division,
occupying the first line, was compelled to fall back in
considerable disorder upon the second line, causing
temporary confusion; but the rapid advance of General
Heinselman and General Kearney with their
divisions soon checked the Confederates.

The enemy, led by Hill and Longstreet, advanced in
great columns with three full lines, and came boldly
on like an overwhelming wave, as if determined to
crush all opposition by the suddenness and fierceness
of the attack. It looked as if the Union troops would
be annihilated; indeed, it seemed as if the fragments
of the army would be driven into the Chickahominy
before it would be possible for reÃ«nforcements to
239

arrive. It was at this most dramatic stage of the
battle that Miss Edmonds became a voluntary orderly
to one of the generals. She has told the story in her
own words, which cannot be improved upon. It furnishes
a fine climax to her sensational career in the
army.

âAt this time,â she says, âI was in military uniform
mounted on my horse and acting as orderly for
General Kearney. Several times orderlies had been
sent with messages and dispatches but no reÃ«nforcements
had yet arrived, and taking a Federal view of
the picture it presented a gloomy appearance. The
General reined in his horse abruptly and taking from
his pocket an envelope he hastily wrote on the back
of it with pencil, âIn the name of God, bring your command
to our relief if you have to swim in order to get
hereâor we are lost.â Handing it to me he said:

ââGo just as fast as that horse can carry you to
General G, present this with my compliments and
return and report to me.â

âI put poor little âRebâ over the road at the very
top of his speed until he was nearly white with foam,
then plunged him into the Chickahominy and swam
across the river. I met one general about one hundred
rods from the river, making the best of his way towards
the bridge. Engineers were at once set to work
strengthening the crazy structure, which was swaying
to and fro with the rush of the tide. The eager,
excited troops dashed into the water waist deep, and
getting upon the floating planks went pouring over in
massive columns. I preferred to swim my horse back
240

again rather than risk myself upon such a bridge, for
I looked every moment to see it give way and engulf
the whole division in the turbid waters of the swollen
creek. However, all reached the other side in safety
and started along the flooded road on the double quick.
This was cheering news to carry back to the General,
so I started again through the field in order to claim
the reward of âHim who bringeth good tidings.â

âI found the General in the thickest of the fight,
encouraging his men and shouting his orders distinctly
above the roar and din of battle. Riding up
to him and touching my hat I reported:

ââJust returned, sir. General G with his command
will be here immediately.â

âIt was too good to keep to himself, so he turned to
his men and shouted at the top of his voice:

ââReÃ«nforcements! ReÃ«nforcements!â

âThen, swinging his hat in the air, he perfectly electrified
the whole line as far as his voice could reach and
the glorious word âReÃ«nforcements,â was passed along
until that almost exhausted line was re-animated and
inspired with new hopes, which led it to ultimate
victory.â

XVI

THE AMAZING ADVENTURE OF
BRIGADIER-GENERAL
LAFAYETTE C. BAKER

In
the early part of April, 1861, a tall, well-built
man, with the love of adventure in his heart,
called upon the General commanding the Union
forces and offered to penetrate the Confederate lines
for the purpose of discovering the military secrets of
the Southern army.

The volunteer was Lafayette C. Baker, who was to
play a most conspicuous part in the Civil War, and the
soldier to whom he made his proposal was General
Winfield Scott, one of the most distinguished military
men in the United States. The interview was epoch-making
in its character, and out of it came one of the
most amazing adventures in the history of the war.

BRIGADIER-GENERAL LAFAYETTE C. BAKER

Washington was filled with all sorts of men on all
sorts of missions at that time, and Scott was not disposed
to see the young man from the West. The
General, with others in power, had his fill of theorists
who offered endless suggestions for the conduct of the
war, most of which, when tried, proved to be impracticable.
But Baker was the sort of an enthusiast who
was not to be daunted. He had journeyed to the
244

National Capital for the purpose of seeing the General
and he did not propose to quit until he had accomplished
his object. It happened that he was acquainted
with Congressman William D. Kelley, a notable member
of the House from Philadelphia, and Mr. Kelley,
in the kindness of his heart, managed to arrange an
interview with General Scott.

The enthusiasm of the man who was willing to risk
his life in the cause attracted the attention of the veteran
of the Army. Scott had the enviable distinction
of having participated in three wars. He rendered
distinguished service in the war of 1812, and
he was one of the heroes of the Mexican War. Now,
as the ranking head of the Army, he was charged with
the direction of the Federal forces in the Civil War,
although age and increasing infirmities eventually
caused him to be shelved in favor of younger men.
But in the meantime he was deeply interested in knowing
the plans of the Confederates, and he was impressed
with the earnestness of Baker.

âYou look as if you had the grit and the intelligence
for the job,â he said, âand Iâm going to give
you a chance to see what you can do. If you succeed
you will be recognized by the Government in a suitable
manner.â

Baker drew himself up to his full height and there
was a flash of fire in his gray eyes as he exclaimed:

âAll I ask is this chanceâIâll guarantee to make
good!â

The General smiled and placed his hand upon the
shoulder of the volunteer.

245

âThatâs the sort of spirit that wins. Good-by and
good luck to you!â

But before Baker left, Scott had pressed ten twenty-dollar
gold pieces into his hands.

âYou may need it for expenses,â he said with a
humorous twinkle in his eyes.

Lafayette Baker now possessed the status of an
âunofficial spy.â He was not commissioned and he
was unarmed, but he was satisfied that if he were able
to carry out his promise he would not fail to receive
governmental recognition. His first move was to contrive
some plan that would make his appearance in
the camp seem reasonable. He discarded the notion
of a disguise as unnecessary and dangerous. He
finally hit upon the expedient of pretending to be an
itinerant photographer. At that stage of the Civil
War picture taking was all the rage and the officers
delighted in having themselves photographed in front
of their tents, surrounded by their aides.

Baker went to one of the second hand shops in
Washington and succeeded in purchasing a camera
and a tripod. The fact that the camera was worn out
and unworkable did not disturb him in the least. The
dealer chuckled at the thought of finding a customer
who was willing to pay real money for such junk, little
thinking that the paraphernalia was precisely suited to
the needs of the purchaser.

All of his preparations were completed on the 11th
of July, 1861, and on the morning of that day he began
his journey, exclaiming as he did so,

âOn to Richmond!â

246

Baker had been given detailed instructions by General
Scott and was told to keep his eyes and ears open
during the progress of his trip to the Confederate
capital. He had been told to learn the locality,
strength and character of the Southern troops and to
let no opportunity pass for gaining information of
the enemyâs fortifications. General Scott was especially
anxious to get some definite news concerning the
famous Black Horse Cavalry, which had become the
bane of the Union Commanders.

Baker began his journey in high spirits. The
nature of his services, of course, was not known to
the Federal troops and as a consequence he was regarded
by them with quite as much interest and curiosity
as if he had been within the lines of the enemy.

The Federal Army lay before Washington, guarding
the frontier, which stretched from a point three
miles below Alexandria toward the Potomac. General
Heintzelman was the Provost Marshal and was
stationed at this point. Passes were not recognized
either by the Union or Confederate armies, and Baker
knew that he ran the risk of being arrested as a spy
either by the Federal or the Confederate sentinels.
However, he knew the attempt to get through both
these lines was a part of his self-imposed task. When
he was four miles out of the city he reached the headquarters
of the Second Maine Regiment. His photographic
outfit was slung across his back and the Colonel
of the regiment invited him to take a view of the
camp, including his own tent with the principal officers
standing in the foreground. As Bakerâs apparatus
247

was next to worthless, he knew that it would be
folly for him to pretend to take the picture, but he was
equal to the occasion. After dining with the Colonel,
he suggested that he would like to go to a neighboring
hill and take views of the encampment and
then return to photograph the headquarters. He was
soon in the woods, and eluding the guards pushed forward
through the tangled undergrowth in the direction
of Richmond. After a while he felt that he had
crossed the Federal lines, but at that critical moment
he was startled by a loud command:

âWho goes there!â

Baker looked up and saw a sentinel standing with
lifted gun upon a knoll just beyond the roadside.
There was no opportunity for explanation. The
guard marched the volunteer in the direction of the
Colonelâs headquarters. That officer was sure he had
caught a spy and escorted by ten men, Baker was sent
back along the railroad, the very way he had started,
to General Heintzelmanâs headquarters. He was presented
to the General in language that was more expressive
than flattering:

âHereâs a dirty spy, Generalâwe found him lurking
about our camp and trying to get through the
lines.â

âYou contemptible villain!â exclaimed Heintzelman
with an oath, âIâve got a notion to stand you
against the wall and shoot you through the heart.â

Baker, with all his courage, quailed before this
fiery denunciation. He was in a predicament. His
employment by General Scott was confidential and it
248

might spoil his plan of campaign if he should disclose
his identity, but while he was wondering what he
should do under the circumstances, General Heintzelman
burst forth with another tirade:

âIâll fix you, you rascal!â he exclaimed. âIâll
send you to General Scott and Iâll wager that heâll
teach you a lesson that will last you for the balance of
your life.â

The captive smiled at this announcement. It fitted
in with his own desires so well that he could scarcely
conceal his own satisfaction. A guard was placed
around him and he was hurried to Washington and
into the presence of General Scott. The veteran lifted
his eyebrows with surprise and amusement and dismissed
the escort.

âLeave this man with me,â he said, trying to conceal
his smile; âIâll know how to deal with him.â

When they were alone the General patted his messenger
on the shoulder and said cheerfully:

âThis is a complication that I had not anticipated.
What are you going to do about it?â

âIâm going to try again,â was the prompt reply of
Baker, and ten minutes later he was started on his
mission for the second time.

Soldiers were arriving in Washington at all hours
of the day and night and in an almost unbroken line
were marching over a long bridge into Virginia. That
night Baker took his position at the end of the bridge
and when a regiment came down in considerable disorder
he quietly slipped into the ranks, hoping to be
borne along with the troops. Unfortunately a lieutenant
249

saw the movement and taking the interloper by
the collar put him under guard and sent him back to
the rear. He was released with a warning not to repeat
the trick.

Another night was spent in Washington, but it was
not wholly devoted to sleep. The active mind of the
volunteer was busy with new plans and when daylight
came he said to himself with the air of a child who is
reciting a lesson:

âOn to Richmond!â

Before breakfast that morning he had renewed his
journey on foot, going through the lower counties of
Maryland, toward Fort Tobacco. He traveled thirty-five
miles that day and when night came he was so
exhausted that he slept like a log. In the morning
he gave a negro one of his precious twenty-dollar gold
pieces to row him across the river and before noon
that day he found himself well within the Confederate
lines. The country was wooded and an unfrequented
road, whose general direction was toward
Richmond, suggested his line of advance into the old
dominion. It was a hot day and he was forced to
pause frequently to slake his thirst at brooks by the
roadside. He had no settled plan of future movements,
but trusted to circumstances to steer his course.
He was about four miles from the banks of the Potomac
when two Confederate soldiers made their appearance
and demanded him to give an account of himself.
He did so, but his story was evidently discounted, for
the soldiers promptly placed him under arrest as a
spy. They were friendly guards, however, and accepted
250

an invitation from their prisoner to indulge in
a glass of ale at a beer shop in one of the townships
through which they passed. One glass, as frequently
happens, led to another, until finally the two soldiers
fell asleep on the step of the beer house and their prisoner
went on his way unmolested.

He proceeded along the road toward Manassas
Junction, congratulating himself on his easy escape
when four cavalrymen suddenly came out of the brush
and ordered him to halt. They drew their sabers and
commanded him to surrender. He pretended surprise.

âIâm a law abiding citizen,â he exclaimed, âunarmed
and on my way to Richmond, where I have
business.â

One of the men dismounted and proceeded to search
him and succeeded in finding a number of letters. It
was just the thing that Baker wanted, for two of these
missives were notes of introduction to prominent men
in Richmond. In spite of this, the four soldiers directed
Baker to proceed to Brentsville, about ten miles
distant. They rode all the way and kept him on foot
between them. Brentsville was reached about ten
oâclock that night and the prisoner was immediately
taken to the headquarters of General Bonham of South
Carolina, who was in command at that vicinity. The
General, who was in full dress uniform, took a seat
opposite Baker and began to question him.

âWhere do you come from and where are you
going?â he asked.

âI come from Washington and I am on my way to
Richmond.â

251

âWhat do you mean by coming inside of my
lines!â he exclaimed.

Bakerâs face in the language of the movies âregisteredâ
intense surprise.

âIâm a loyal and peaceful citizen of the United
States, engaged in an honorable and legitimate pursuit.
I have business in Richmond and desire to get
there at the earliest possible moment.â

The Confederate General laughed mirthlessly.

âWell, Iâll see that you get there and in quick order.
I believe youâre a Union spy and Iâm going to send you
to General Beauregard.â

General Bonham handed a sealed letter to a lieutenant
who was standing near by and said:

âPut this man in irons and take him to General
Beauregardâs headquarters.â

So at midnight, expostulating all the way, he was
compelled to go on foot in the direction of Manassas
Junction. When he protested against being compelled
to walk such a distance he was told that he had chosen
that mode of conveyance and ought not to find fault
with it. The party arrived at Manassas Junction at
daylight and went at once to General Beauregardâs
headquarters, which were located at the Wiere House.
The prisoner was completely exhausted from his walk
and he lay down in front of the house and went to
sleep. He awoke at nine oâclock and found himself
in charge of a guard, who told him that General
Beauregard had expressed a desire to see him.

General Beauregard sat in front of a desk, surrounded
by members of his staff. An open letter lay
252

before him. He pointed to it, frowningly, and said:

âI see that you have been taken inside of our lines.
What explanation have you to make?â

Lafayette Baker had been cross-examined so often
during his brief career as a military spy that he was
becoming used to the ordeal. He had his story by
heart and he proceeded to tell it glibly.

âI am from Washington and I am on my way
to Richmond where I have private business requiring
my attention. I have not intended to violate any
law, regulation or military rule of the Confederate
Army.â

The General turned to a member of his staff and
began whispering. The prisoner watched him anxiously.
The letters that had been taken from him
named him as Samuel Munson and he realized that it
would not do to forget the appellation. He had assumed
that name because he had learned that several
families by the name of Munson belonged in Knoxville,
Tennessee, and he had known a son of Judge
Munson during the time he lived in California.
While this thought was running through his mind the
General finished his conversation with his staff officer
and once more turned to the spy.

âSo you are going to Richmond, are you?â

The prisoner smiled.

âThat was my intention,â he replied, âbut of course
you are to be the judge in that matter. If it is your
desire, I am willing to return to Washington.â

General Beauregard shook his head.

âNo,â he said, with a slight trace of sarcasm in his
253

voice. âI prefer that you should go to Richmond.
Where do you reside?â

âI have lived in California for the last ten years,
but formerly lived in the South in Knoxville, Tennessee.â

âHow long has it been since you were in Knoxville?â

âTen or twelve years.â

âWhat is your name?â

âSamuel Munson,â replied Baker with cheerful
mendacity.

General Beauregard looked at the prisoner intently
and then suddenly exclaimed:

âYes, yes, I know that is the name on the letters
that were found in your possession, but Iâd like to
know what your name was before you became a spy.â

If he expected to catch his man unaware, he was
disappointed for Baker, looking at him with assumed
dignity, said:

âI am no spy.â

The General arose from his chair and paced up and
down the room several times. Presently he halted
and pointing out of the window said:

âDo you see that tree?â

âI do.â

âWell, I half believe that you are a spy and if I
was sure of it I would hang you on that tree as a warning
to all other spies.â

Baker looked at him reproachfully and not without
a secret feeling of fear. The General called to one
of his attendants.

254

âOrderly,â he commanded, âtake this man out and
put him in the guard house.â

Five minutes later the adventurer found himself
inside of a log house within a stockade. The discreet
use of one of his gold pieces secured him a warm
breakfast and later in the day he was permitted to go
outside in the care of a guard. The two men were
soon on good terms and the guard did not disdain the
offer of a drink with his prisoner. Before they
returned, Baker had the satisfaction of seeing all the
troops in the vicinity of Manassas Junctionâincluding
the famous Black Horse Cavalry concerning which
General Scott was anxious to obtain information.

The volunteer spy now had important information
which would be of great value to General Scott, but
he had no means of conveying it to the Union Commander.
Indeed, he was kept under lock and key with
no means to communicate with the outside world.
Perhaps his guards repented having given him so
much liberty. If so they did not propose to repeat
the mistake. During the long watches of the night he
had time to think over his position, and to consider
his plans for the future. As a result of this he abandoned
all thought of trying to escapeâat least at
that stage of the adventure. His one desire was to
reach Richmond, and thus carry out his original
design. But if he were kept confined there would not
be much prospect of reaching the Confederate capital.
Curiously enough, the thought of being shot as
a spy did not enter his thoughts at that time. He was
so much engrossed in his mission that he did not think
255

of the risk he was running. All during that night his
one thought was:

How shall I get to Richmond?

Just before daylight the answer came in the most
abrupt and unexpected manner. One of his guards
aroused him, shouting:

âHey there, wake up and get ready for a journey!
Youâve got to go to Richmond and give an account of
yourself to Jeff Davis!â

Baker could have cried with joy. The one thing
he most desired had come about without any effort on
his part. He cheerfully arose and won the good will
of the guard by his seeming docility. He was taken
to the station and placed on a freight car, along with
some others who were also going to Richmond. Evidently
he was regarded as an important prisoner, for
he was carefully guarded during every stage of the
journey. That trip during the night, over a badly
constructed road was a nightmare, long to live in the
memory of Lafayette Baker. But the prospect of
actually setting foot in the Confederate capital kept
him in the best of spirits and enabled him to exchange
jests with his captors.

On the arrival in Richmond he expected to be taken
to Libby Prison, concerning the horrors of which he
had heard a great deal from Union soldiers who had
been captured in some of the early skirmishes of the
war. But instead of that he was conveyed to a room
on the third story of an engine house in the city. His
apartment was large and airy, and was all that could be
desired. He was treated with great consideration,
256

but was guarded with scrupulous care. Evidently the
officers felt that they had no ordinary prisoner in their
charge. The cause of this extreme courtesy became
evident on the morning of the second day after Bakerâs
arrival in Richmond when he was informed that President
Davis desired to interview him. The head of
the Confederacy had his headquarters in the Spottswood
House whence the Northern spy was escorted.
Baker expected to find much formality there, but to
his surprise found Mr. Davis in his shirt sleeves and
without collar and tie. He was evidently very busy
because his desk was filled with papers and there were
a number of persons waiting to have a talk with him.
He motioned Baker to a seat without looking at him,
and continued with some writing with which he was
engaged when the prisoner was brought into his room.
Presently he turned to the suspect and said abruptly:

âThey say your name is Samuel Munson?â

âYes, sir,â replied the cheerful fabricator, âthat
is my name.â

âI understand,â said the civil chief of the seceding
States, toying with his pen, âthat you have been in
Washington recently. What can you tell me about
conditions there?â

âNot much,â was the answer, âexcept that there
is a great deal of excitement and confusion there.â

âHow many troops do you think there are in Washington
and vicinity at the present time?â

âThat is a pretty difficult question to answer, but
there are probably from 75,000 to 100,000, with more
arriving all the while.â

257

Mr. Davis seemed to ponder over this for some
time, and then looking his caller in the eye, he said,

âI presume that you know you are suspected of
being a spy?â

The look of injured innocence which appeared upon
the face of Lafayette Baker would have done credit
to a professional actor. Nevertheless he evaded a
direct answer by saying:

âNo man is safe from accusation in times like the
present.â

âBut what have you to say for yourself?â

âNothing except that I defy my accusers to prove
their charges.â

âIt seems to me,â said Mr. Davis, âthat some one
said you were a Southern man.â

âYes, sir, I came originally from Knoxville. The
members of my family lived there for years, but in
recent times I have lived in California.â

âHave you any way of proving that?â

The alleged Mr. Munson shrugged his shoulders.

âI am afraid I cannot find any one here to identify
me.â

The President of the Confederacy smiled a somewhat
sarcastic smile.

âPerhaps we may be able to help you out in that
respect. There is a Knoxville man in the city and as
soon as I am able to locate him I will have you meet
him.â

This was startling news indeed and it came near
shaking the self-assurance of the volunteer spy. But
before he had time to make any reply he found himself
258

being escorted out of the room and taken to his
place of confinement in the engine house. He was
treated as kindly as before, but he realized that the
watch upon him was closer than ever. He did some
serious thinking that night. As he looked out of the
barred windows and up into the unpitying stars he felt
that he had reached a real crisis in his life.

One of two things would happen. Either he would
escape from his place of confinement, and attempt to
reach the North, or he would be shot as a spy. All of
the chances seemed to point to his execution on the
charge of spying.

But his naturally buoyant disposition came to his
aid, and when morning arrived he was taking a more
cheerful view of the future. That day he was taken
before President Davis and submitted to a further
cross-examination. The Chief of the Confederacy
appeared to be more anxious to get reliable information
concerning the Union forces than to prove that
Baker was a spy.

âWho is in command of the Yankees at this time?â
he asked.

âGeneral Scott,â was the truthful reply.

âWhere is he?â

âIn Washington.â

âAh, then he is not in charge of the troops?â

âNo, sir, I believe that General McDowell is in
active command of the forces in the field.â

This was correct, and Baker in making the statement
felt that he was not giving away any of the secrets
of the war. But the information interested the
259

President and he turned aside and talked with several
of his advisers who were in the room. In the meanwhile
he made a gesture to indicate that he was through
with Mr. Baker, alias Mr. Munson, and the spy was
led from the room and once again taken to his prison
in the engine house. In spite of his optimistic nature
these repeated cross-examinations were beginning to
unnerve him. He was afraid that he might be tripped
up in some of his answers, and then he felt sure that
he would be stood up against a wall and shot. He felt
that such a procedure would make him a martyr, but
he had a very natural desire to postpone his martyrdom
as long as possible.

His real ordeal was to come on the following day.
Shortly after breakfast he learned that Mr. Davis
desired to see him again. And he learned something
else that caused him much perturbation. It was that a
Knoxville man had been located in Richmond and that
he had been sent for to identify the supposed Mr.
Munson. Baker tried hard to screw up his courage
for the interview. He was at a loss as to how he
should act and talk. It was certain that the man did
not know him and in such an event he would be in the
position of being condemned as an impostor and a
spy. While he was preparing to go over to the Spottswood
House he heard one of his captors speak of a
Mr. Brock of Knoxville, who had also been summoned
to meet the President. Baker grasped at this as a
drowning man grabs at a straw. All the way to the
hotel he racked his brain in the effort to work out a
plan of action. But he could reach no definite conclusion.
260

He would have to be guided entirely by circumstances.
One thing he did do was to refresh his
mind as to certain names and places in Knoxville.
When he reached the headquarters of the Confederate
Government he found Mr. Davis talking with a man in
a frock coat and a slouch hat. At first he supposed
that this must be Brock, but fortunately he learned
that it was Robert Toombs, and was thereby saved
from making a break that might have caused his undoing.
In a moment the President turned to the spy.

âHello, Munson,â he said, âI have sent for a man
who has lived in Knoxville for many years, and he will
be able to tell us if you are the person you claim to be.
Take a seat. Heâll be here in a few minutes.â

Baker sat on a chair facing the door and anxiously
waited for the man who was to give the verdict. The
moments went by on leaden heels. He could feel the
cold sweat coming out on his brow. But he had courage
and he was resourceful. Once the door opened
and a messenger came in. Baker half rose to his feet,
but caught himself in time. He could not afford to
make a mistake. The President and Toombs talked
together as if oblivious to his presence. Presently
Toombs threw himself on a couch in a corner of the
room and Mr. Davis busied himself with some papers
on his desk. The spy kept his eyes glued upon the
door. Out of it would walk his doom or his deliveranceâhe
could not tell which. Suddenly when the
strain was beginning to seem too great for further
endurance, the door was opened and a middle-aged
man entered the room. He hesitated for a moment
261

and looked about him inquiringly. Baker felt that he
must be the man. He did not hesitate for the fraction
of a moment, but jumping up and hurrying toward the
newcomer he held out his hand and exclaimed in a
tone of great cordiality:

âWhy, hello, Brock, how are you, anyhow?â

The surprised visitor did not have time to think.
He accepted the proffered hand in a mechanical manner
and said slowly:

âYouâyou areââ

âSam Munson, of course. Donât you remember
me?â

âJudge Munsonâs son?â

âCertainlyâbut itâs been ten years since weâve
met. Iâm surely glad to see you. How are you, anyhow?â

âIâm right well,â said the stampeded one, âand
how are you?â

âWell, I havenât been very well, but the sight of
you is a cure for sore eyes. Theyâve locked me up on
suspicion, and youâve just come in the nick of time.
They wanted some one to let them know that I was
really Sam Munson. How long has it been since
youâve been in the old town?â

âTwo years,â said Brock, watching the other man
intently.

âWell, itâs been ten since I was there, and Iâll bet
theyâve had some big changes in that time.â

âRather!â

âBy the way,â continued Baker, trying to prevent
the other from having time to think, âyou remember
262

the Bradleys, donât you? Well, I heard not long ago
that Sue Bradley had marriedâmarried some fellow
from Chattanooga. She was a mighty fine girl was
Sue, and the fellow that got her got a prize.â

Well, to make a long story short the bluff workedânot
like a charm, but with sufficient smoothness to
enable the nervy spy to save his life. Brock and
Baker had one or two more interviews, and by ransacking
his brain for incidents he had learned about the
prominent people of Knoxville he finally persuaded
Brock that he was really Sam Munson. The visitor
even went so far as to apologize for his seeming inability
to place his fellow townsman at first sight.

âBut you must remember that it has been many
years since you left the old town, Sam. Youâve
changed a lot since then.â

âDonât mention it,â was the hearty response. âIâd
have been the same if I had been in your place. But
youâve done me a good turn, and I wonât forget it.â

There was no doubt of the good turnâif saving
a man from being shot as a spy can be placed in that
category.

As a result of the business Baker was not released,
but he was placed under parole. This gave him the
right to wander about Richmond at willâthe very
privilege he most desired. If he had planned the thing
in advance it could not have worked out more to his
liking. He was free to go and come as he pleased,
and he was actually under the patronage and the protection
of the Confederate Government!

For two days and two nights he roamed about until
263

he became as familiar with conditions in Richmond as
if he were a resident. He obtained a mass of data
concerning military plans and proposed movements,
learned where troops were quartered and where fortifications
were being erected. Most of this information
he carried in his head, but in a few instances he
made notes of a character which were intelligible to
himself, but which were not likely to be decipherable
to any one else. Finally the time came when he knew
more than âwas goodâ for himself, from a Confederate
point of view. The question was how to get this
knowledge to the Federal Government. The fact that
he had been before Mr. Davis and was now at liberty
made him seem harmless to most of the officers in
Richmond. He became personally acquainted with
some of them. One was the Provost Marshal, and
so, one day, when he asked that official for a pass to
permit him to visit Fredericksburg it was granted without
any hesitation.

He proceeded to that place without any difficulty.
Once or twice he was halted by sentinels, but the production
of his pass was all that was needed to permit
him to go on his way. On the night of the day he
reached Fredericksburg he parted with another of his
precious gold pieces to a negro who rowed him across
the Rappahannock. He drew a breath of relief when
he reached the other side of the stream, and yet he
realized that his dangers had only begun. That night
he slept in a haystackâslept the sleep of a dog-tired
man, if not of the just. When he awoke at dawn he
discovered signs of activity in the vicinity of the barn
264

where he had slept and he knew that he was being
pursued. He lay very quiet and listened. Voices
were shouting and it did not take him long to learn
that a squad of Confederate cavalry was on the hunt
and that a number of horsemen surrounded the barn.

He shuddered at the thought of the consequences.
He had plenty of courage but he did not relish the
thought of being caught like a rat in a trap. He had
provided himself with a revolver, and he firmly resolved
that if he were detected he would not give his
life easily. He grasped the weapon, and lay very,
very quiet. He was almost afraid to breathe. Presently
one of the cavalrymen dismounted and flourishing
his sword began a search of the barn. Some of
those on the outside were shouting instructions to the
searcher, and he responded cheerily. He poked his
sword here and there in the hay rick, calling meanwhile
on any supposed fugitive to surrender if he did
not want to be killed. At one time the point of the
sword just grazed Bakerâs boots. He could have
screamed with nervousness, but by a super-human effort
he managed to keep perfectly quiet. And by so
doing he saved his life, for the officer turning to his
companions called:

âHe ainât here, boysâwe might as well move on!â

They rode off, to the great joy of the hidden man.
He remained still until the sound of the horsesâ hoofs
had died out in the distance, and then he crept from
his place of concealment more dead than alive. He
waited for a long while and then crept out of the barn
and made for the woods. How long he straggled
265

through the woods he could not tell, but he was so
hungry, and faint and footsore that nothing seemed to
make any difference. That night he managed to get
supper in a hut owned by a poor colored man, and
afterwards tried to find just where the Potomac was
located. When he reached that stream he discovered
an old row boat. The owner of it was lying, half
asleep, on the banks of the river. Baker invited him
to sell the boat, offering the last of his gold pieces for
craft, but the owner indignantly refused saying that
he would not part with it for any price.

This was discouraging, and in lieu of anything better
to do he lay down and went to sleep, with the hard
earth for a couch, and the shining stars for his covering.
He awakened just before daylight with every
bone in his body aching, and an intense yearning for
home. The owner of the boat was still asleep, and his
craft lay anchored in the water. It did not take Baker
long to come to a decision. At that stage of his career
larceny seemed a very petty offense. He crept
down to the water side and climbing into the boat
began to row gently into the stream. The job was not
an easy one because the oars were broken and decayed.
However, by great care he managed to get the boat
into the middle of the stream. At that moment the
owner awoke, and when he discovered what had happened
sent up a series of ear-splitting screams.

âCome back with that boat, you thief,â he yelled,
âor Iâll kill you.â

Baker did not fear anything from the man, but in
a few moments he saw that three or four soldiers had
266

suddenly appeared upon the scene, and were talking
with the distracted owner of the boat. They grasped
the situation at a glance, and ordered him to halt at
the risk of his life. Instead of halting he pulled
harder than ever. Without another word one of the
soldiers raised his gun and fired. The shot struck one
of the oars and shattered it. Once again came the
command to halt and once again the fleeing man renewed
his efforts as best he could with the broken oar.
This time three of the soldiers aimed at the man in
the boat. There was a hissing sound, Baker ducked
and the bullets went skimming across the water. The
situation was becoming perilous. The fugitive plied
his one good oar, and worked the stump of the other
with great vigor, and in this way managed to lengthen
the distance between himself and the shore. A final
volley came from the soldiers and this time the shots
fell short of the mark by several yards.

Baker breathed freely for the first time since he
had boarded the boat. He was out of danger for the
time being. All depended now upon his ability to get
to the Maryland side of the stream. It was a hard
job, but he stuck at it with the persistence of a desperate
man, and eventually felt the small craft grazing
the beach. He felt a strong desire to cheer, but he
overestimated his strength, for the moment he climbed
out of the boat he fell to the ground, exhausted. The
perils and the privations he had undergone were
enough to kill a less resolute and less hardy man. He
lay on the shore for more than an hour, until finally
a farmer passing that way halted and picked him up.
267

He was taken to a farmhouse, and given a meal
which he ate with the ravenousness of a wolf. His
hosts were naturally filled with curiosity, but he felt
that discretion was the part of wisdom and he declined
to reveal his identity, or the cause of the plight in
which he had been found.

That night, in spite of the protests of the farmer,
he resumed his journey to Washington. He walked
the greater part of the night and slept in a barn as
usual. He begged his breakfast and then started on
his last lap to the National Capital. It was some time
before he felt that he was out of danger, but finally
the dome of the Capitol came into view, and he knew
then that he was safe and that his remarkable adventure
was to be a success. It was nearly noon, and
there was a broiling sun when he finally reached the
streets of Washington. He did not wait to eat or to
make himself presentable, but headed immediately for
the headquarters of General Scott. The attendant at
the door repulsed him and said that it would be impossible
to see the General at that time. Baker knew
that this reception was caused by his disreputable appearance,
and once he was sure that Scott was in his
room, he pushed the man aside and bolted into the
apartment where the head of the army was making
his headquarters. The General was seated at a desk
and as the strange looking specimen of humanity
stood beside him, he said rather gruffly:

âWell, sir, what can I do for you?â

Baker threw out his arms in a gesture of entreaty
and said with a wan smile:

268

âWhy, General, donât you know me?â

The veteran rose to his feet and closely scrutinized
the speaker, and then he said, with a welcoming smile
and outstretched hand:

âWell, by all thatâs holy, itâs Baker!â

He would not let him tell his story then, but insisted
upon his taking a hearty dinner and making
himself comfortable. After that the adventurous one
sat down and gave a detailed account of his exploits
from the time he left Washington. He presented a
complete report of all he had learned while in Richmond,
and furnished him with data concerning the
size and movements of the Confederate soldiers.
Other members of the staff were called into consultation,
and after their talk had been concluded Baker
was plied with questions which he had no difficulty in
answering. It was dusk before he had talked himself
out, and then the General took him by the hand and
thanked him for what he had done for the Government.

âYou have more than made good,â he said, âand
I will see that you get the recognition which you
deserve.â

On the following morning General Scott walked
over to the War Department, and when he returned
he carried with him a commission which
made Lafayette Baker an agent in the secret service
of the War Department. From that time until the
close of the war he participated actively in the work
of both the War and State Departments. He was
recognized by President Lincoln and became intimately
269

associated with Secretary Stanton. As the
result of all this he was made Provost General and
later was promoted to the post of Brigadier-General
in the army.

XVII

THE MYSTERIOUS âFâ AND THE
CAPTURED TROOPERS

A fan
, a glove, a whiff of perfume, an unknown
female spy, and a troop of captured soldiers,
taken unawares, constitute pretty good ingredients
for a romance, and yet they have been part of
the actual history of more than one war.

During the Civil War the Union troops occupied
the territory known as Fairfax Court House for a
considerable period. It was in Virginia, and might
fairly be said to be âthe enemyâs country.â It was
one of those army outposts where the men are called
upon to do a great deal of watchful waiting. The
Union soldiers and the residents of the community
came to know one another pretty well, and in the
course of time there came that familiarity which
breeds contempt of danger. There were social affairs
and the people came and went as they pleased.

General Stoughton was in charge of the small Union
force which was in control of the town, and there is
nothing in the official reports to indicate that he was
remiss in any way. But some of the men began to feel
that everything was not as it should be. It was
rumored that at least one of the women in the place
274

was supplying information to the enemy. Just who it
was could not be determined, but presently the word
went around that the mysterious spy was known only
by the letter âF.â

Mosbyâs raiders were performing sensational feats
in many parts of Virginia at that time, and it was
hinted that they were in the vicinity of Fairfax Court
House. One day one of the charming Southern girls
of the town went out horseback riding with one of
the Union officers. It was a delightful trip and the
soldier greatly enjoyed the conversation of his companion,
who was a cultivated woman, who, while naturally
having much love for her own people, insisted
that she had no feeling against the âYankees.â During
the return home she became separated from him,
and when he rejoined her, found that she was talking
to a man by the roadside, in civilian attire. Not much
was thought of the incident at the time, but later it
was reported that the stranger was not only connected
with the Confederate Army, but was actually on the
staff of the famous Mosby.

The house occupied by General Stoughton at Fairfax
Court House was one of those Southern mansions
which are so familiar in Virginia. It was of brick,
with a porch, and covered with creeping vines which
gave it a most picturesque appearance. The halls
were wide and the rooms large and airy. It is not
hard to imagine that the ample drawing-room must
have been the scene of many festivities in ante-bellum
days. In a word, it was just the sort of setting that
was necessary for the remarkable adventure in which
275

a girl, a famous scout and a captured general were to
be the central figures.

One day a young Union officer entered the drawing-room
of this house, and looking about him discovered
a fan and a pair of gloves upon the large center table.
There was the scent of a faint perfume in the apartment
and following it he came across a beautiful girl
to whom the articles belonged. He returned them
with a gallantry which it might be supposed was foreign
to a Northerner, but which as a matter of fact
was quite as common as it was in those living south
of Mason and Dixonâs line. He was fascinated with
the girl and she betrayed just enough interest in him
to make him want to dance attendance upon her. His
duties were not particularly trying at that time and
as a consequence he managed to spend a great deal
of his time in her company.

Her nameâwell, he heard it, but it did not make
much of an impression upon his mind. It is enough
to say that from that time the war seemed to be of
secondary importance compared to the ardent affection
he felt for the young woman. They walked together
and they talked together and he lived in a Paradise of
his own making, none the less attractive because it
happened to be a Foolâs Paradise. Even after the incident
which caused such a stir at the time, he defended
her from the charge of deceit, so far as he was concerned.
But it is very evident that information concerning
the conditions about the outpost began to filter
into the Confederate lines. Through some mysterious
agency all of the details concerning the topography
276

of the camp found its way to General Stuart, the
Confederate cavalry leader, and then one evening the
thing happened which caused consternation in the
North, and was received with joy and laughter in the
South.

Mosby, the Confederate Guerrilla, from time to
time, obtained information concerning the outpost at
Fairfax Court House, and he finally determined to
raid it in the hope of making some sensational captures.
His little band, which had been recruited from
Stuartâs Cavalry, was eager for the venture, and held
themselves in readiness for the order from their chief.
Mosby, who had the loyalty of his men in an intense
degree, was one of the remarkable men of the Civil
War. He weighed only one hundred and twenty-five
pounds and was about five feet, eight inches in height.
His face was clean cut and smooth shaven and he had
straight, firm lips and a nose that has been described as
resembling an eagleâs beak. He was just the type of
man who might be expected to engage in dangerous
adventure without the thought of the consequences.

The affair took place on the eighth of March, 1863.
Mosby had been with his Rangers only a month, but
already he was gaining a name for himself in all parts
of the country. Fairfax Court House at this time
was surrounded by large numbers of Union soldiers.
Centreville, only a few miles away, contained a brigade
of trained men. Still another brigade of mixed
troops was located on the pike, near the town. This
would seem to be pretty dangerous territory for a
small body of raiders, but Mosby had not been receiving
277

information for days without understanding the
situation fully. He knew that there was one weak
link in the chain of defenses and he knew precisely
where to look for it. He proceeded in the direction
of this weak spot, followed by twenty-nine of his
most daring men. It was pitch dark and impossible
to see more than a few feet ahead. Presently they
found themselves in the Court House Square, in the
center of the town. A picket coming out of the darkness
called out:

âWho goes there?â

âA friend,â came the reply in a muffled voice.

âAdvance and give the countersign,â came from
the sentinel.

Two of Mosbyâs men did advance, but they did not
give the countersign. On the contrary they threw
a coat about the manâs head, and before he realized
what was going on he had been tied and gagged, and
placed near the roadside where he was not likely to do
any damage to the expedition. The men were now
given specific directions by Mosby as to their duties.
The proof that he had been in receipt of confidential
messages from the outpost was shown by the fact that
he was able to direct each of the men to the particular
place where he would find a particular Union officer.
They separated and went in squads to different
parts of the city. Mosby was particularly anxious to
capture Colonel Wyndham, because that officer had sent
him a tantalizing message only a few days before; but
when he arrived at Wyndhamâs tent he discovered
that his man was not there. As a matter of fact the
278

officer had been summoned to Washington only that
morning and thus escaped the humiliation of being
captured by Mosby.

In the meanwhile, as his officers went about their
various assignments, the chief raider made for the
headquarters of General Stoughton. The large front
door was unlocked, of course, and Mosby proceeded
upstairs to the room which he knew was occupied by
the Union officer. He tapped at the door and in a
little while it was opened by a young lieutenant who
was only partly dressed. He rubbed his eyes and
demanded to know the cause of such a visit at such an
unearthly hour. Mosby, who seemed to be enjoying
the situation, took him to one side and ordered him to
take care not to speak loudly or he would shoot him
instantly. He demanded to be taken to the bedside of
General Stoughton, and as the young man was
unarmed, and startled into the bargain, he complied
with the request. Once by the bedside the Guerrilla
Chieftain gave the sleeping man a terrific whack that
awakened him and brought him out of bed in a hurry.
He was furious, but before he could say a word the
invader said in a tragic whisper:

âDid you ever hear of John S. Mosby?â

âCertainly,â was the quick rejoinder. âHave you
captured him?â

âNo,â was the laughing reply, âbut he has captured
you.â

It was humiliating, but General Stoughton was
unarmed and perfectly helpless. He was compelled
to dress and to go with his captor, who by this time
279

was reÃ«nforced by a number of his men. They went
in the direction of the Court House Square where they
found the remainder of the raiders, with a large number
of prisoners lined up and ready for departure.
There were in all, fifty or sixty prisoners and fifty-eight
horses. In the darkness some of the prisoners
escaped. As the party passed a dwelling in the town
a voice from an upper window demanded to know who
they were. It happened to be the Lieutenant-Colonel
of a New York Regiment. Two of Mosbyâs men were
sent into the house to add him to the prizes already
in hand but he managed to elude them and to
escape.

But how did Mosby and his men get out of Fairfax
Court House without arousing the soldiers in the
vicinity? Let that be told by Mr. John W. Munson,
who was one of the famous raiders, and who has written
a most entertaining story of their exploits. âIt
was always Mosbyâs care,â he says, âto get his men
out of the troubles into which he led them. The troops
in the town knew of his presence, but each man of
them seemed to be looking out for himself, and there
was no concert of action. Mosby started toward Fairfax
Station to throw his pursuers off their guard, and
then suddenly turned toward Centreville. To pass
that point meant a great deal to him. The heavy guns
looked down frowningly on him only a few hundred
yards away, and the Sentinels on the works with âWho
goes there?â hailed him as he passed under them, but
he made no reply. Silently the little troop passed
along by the big guns of the forts with their prisoners
280

and vanished into the darkness. Captain Barker, one
of the prisoners, made a dash toward the fort but was
shot at by one of the guerrillas and recaptured just as
his horse fell into a ditch.

âOne more serious danger confronted Mosby.
Cub Run, just beyond Centreville, was overflowing.
Back of the little band of raiders was the fort with its
brigade of soldiers, soon to be, if not already alarmed;
in front of them a raging torrent. There was not an
instant of hesitation but, plunging into the mad stream,
the whole party swam safely across, although many
were carried downstream with the current. Once on
the other side pursuit seemed almost impossible and,
as the sun rose above the eastern horizon, Mosby
breathed his first sigh of relief. Even at that hour he
knew that he had graven his name in history never to
be effaced. He had performed another feat entirely
new in the annals of war, and one that was never to be
repeated. In time he reached Culpepper Court House
and turned his prisoners over to General Fitz Hugh
Lee, who was a classmate of General Stoughtonâs at
West Point.â

In the morning Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston started
in pursuit of Mosby, but it was too late to capture him
or to save the prisoners who had been caught so cleverly.
The news spread to all parts of the country and
was given an importance far beyond its military meaning.
It was humiliating, of course, but it did not have
any positive effect upon the remaining days of the war.
The most interesting comment, as might be expected,
came from President Lincoln, who, when informed
281

that one of his generals and a large number of horses
had been captured said, dryly:

âIâm sorry about the horses. I can make Brigadier-Generals
easily, but I canât make horses.â

But the Confederates were not disposed to look upon
the matter so lightly. They knew the value of such
an exploit in stirring up the enthusiasm of the people,
and Mosby was advertised as a popular hero. General
Stuart went so far as to issue a special order proclaiming
the incident. It read as follows:

âCaptain John S. Mosby has for a long time
attracted the attention of his generals by his
boldness, skill and success, so signally displayed
in his numerous forays upon the invaders of his
native State.

None know his daring enterprise and dashing
heroism better than these foul invaders
though strangers themselves to such noble
traits.

His late brilliant exploit, the capture of General
Stoughton, U.Â S.Â A., two captains, thirty other
prisoners, together with their arms, equipments
and fifty-eight horses, justifies this recognition
in General Orders. The feat, almost unparalleled
in the war, was performed in the midst of the
enemyâs troops, at Fairfax Court House, without
loss to Virginia.

The gallant band of Captain Mosby share the
glory as they did the danger of this enterprise,
and are worthy of such a leader.â

282

Secretary of War Stanton was very angry over the
incident. He felt that it was the result of bad management
in permitting Union secrets to be discovered
by the enemy and he was determined to know just
how it had happened. Secretary Stanton sent for
General Lafayette C. Baker, then Chief of the Federal
Secret Service, and instructed him to make a thorough
investigation and to make any arrests that might be
deemed necessary. Baker had already made a survey
of the grounds at Fairfax Court House, and was
familiar with the incidents of the raid. He was perfectly
satisfied that the Union soldiers had been
betrayed by a spy. And he came to another important
conclusion.

It was that the work had been done by a woman
spy!

How could he ascertain the identity of the woman
and how could he prove her guilt? These were not
the sort of questions to be easily answered. Baker
suspected the daughter of one of the leading citizens
of Fairfax Court House, but he had too much experience
in handling delicate matters of the war to think
of arresting a woman without having proof of her
guilt. It would not do to place the case in the hands
of the soldiers. Their methods were likely to be
crude, and besides might cause complications. He
thought over the matter for some time and then he
made a momentous decision. He decided to place the
case in the hands of a woman operative in his own
office.

It was to be a case of woman against woman!

283

The woman operative, who shall have to be known
as Miss Clarke, prepared for her part with the greatest
care. She even perfected herself in the charming
Southern dialect so that she should be immediately
taken for a daughter of the Sunny South. It was
probably a week after the Mosby raid that a fine-looking
and apparently embarrassed woman arrived at
Fairfax Court House. Finally she managed to enlist
the attention of the young woman who was known
all through the transaction as âF.â The stranger,
with feminine impulsiveness, gave her complete
confidence to âF.â She said that she was greatly
attached to the Confederate cause, that she was really
a friend and an agent of the South and that she
wanted advice and assistance in an effort to reach
Warrington. âF,â who was the spy that had betrayed
Stoughton to Mosby, literally received the newcomer
with open arms. She took her to her own
home where she was given a warm reception. Miss
Clarke was given a repast which included corn muffins,
and when they were placed before her she exclaimed:

âThis makes me feel that I am home again in the
good old South. It has been terrible to have to live
in the North with those Yankees. I have never seen
a corn cake since I left the Virginia line.â

Everybody laughed at this and everybody was
happy. It really seemed like a family reunion. The
visitor was petted and patronized and made to feel that
she was a person of great importance. And why not?
Wasnât she engaged in carrying dispatches to the leaders
284

of the Confederacyâdispatches which might
result in the downfall of the Yankee Government?
They forebore to ask her the nature of the confidential
information which she claimed to be taking to Warrington.
Naturally she would be reluctant to impart
that even to such good friends as they had shown themselves.

How did Miss Clarke feel under these circumstances?
Did she have qualms of conscience at the
thought of eating the bread of the family she might
soon be called upon to denounce? Not in the least.
She knew that the young woman before her had already
betrayed the Union soldiers from a sense of loyalty
to her section, and Miss Clarke did not have the
slightest compunction about betraying âFâ in turn.
But the thing was to get the proof. She could give
evidence that the family of âFâ sympathized with
the Confederacy and was willing to do anything to aid
them, but that was not sufficient for her purpose.
How could she get evidenceâdocumentary evidence
if possible?

The answer came quicker than she had hoped for.
âFâ invited her to her bedroom, and when they had
closed the door said to the visitor,

âI have something I am going to show you. I think
it will interest you for we are engaged in the same
cause.â

MAJOR-GENERAL J.Â E.Â B. STUART

With that she reached under the mattress and
brought forth a document which she handed to her
visitor. Miss Clarke read it with glowing eyes. It
ran as follows:

285

TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, KNOW
YE: That reposing special confidence in the patriotism
and fidelity of âF,â I, James E.Â B. Stuart, by
virtue of the power vested in me as Brigadier-General
in the provisional army of the Confederate States of
America, do hereby appoint and commission her my
honorary aide-de-camp, to rank as such from this
date.

She will be obeyed, respected and admired by all
lovers of a noble nature.

Given under my hand and seal at the headquarters
Cavalry Brigade at Camp Beverly the Seventh day of
October, A.Â D., 1861, and the first year of our independence.

(Signed) J.Â E.Â B. STUART,

By the General: L. TIEMAN,

Assistant Adjutant General.

Here was evidence of a most damaging character.
Miss Clarke could scarcely restrain her emotions at the
important discovery. âFâ noticed this and instead
of suspecting that all was not well, took the actions of
her companion as the natural expressions of feeling
under the circumstances. She put a question to the
other:

âDonât you feel frightened sometimesâyou are
engaged in very dangerous work.â

âI know that very well,â replied Miss Clarke, âbut
I am sustained by the thought that I am doing it for
the sake of my country.â

This was followed by an embrace on the part of the
286

two womenâboth spies, but only one conscious of
the true conditions. It might be supposed that having
obtained proof of the identity and the complicity
of âFâ that Miss Clarke might go on her way. But
she remained for twenty-four hours longer and in that
time obtained a mass of information, not only concerning
the suspected woman, but also about the location
and the movement of the Southern troops. Finally
she departedâdeparted with another kiss and embrace.

Two days later Sergeant Odell, connected with the
staff of General Baker, called at the residence of one
of the leading citizens of Fairfax Court House and
demanded to see his daughter. The young woman
came into the room.

âWhat can I do for you?â she asked calmly.

âYou have been identified as âF,â the famous
Southern spy,â said the officer, âand I have come here
for the purpose of taking you into custody.â

She submitted without a murmur and with a smile.
Evidently she knew the danger of her calling and
expected to be arrested at any time. The young
woman was searched and in her possession were found
a number of letters and papers from Southern officers.
Also was found her commission from General Stuart
which Miss Clarke had considerately left behind. At
the time Odell was placing âFâ under arrest other
officers were making a search of her home which was
still occupied by members of her family. They found
quite a number of damaging papers, and also a large
quantity of Confederate money. That same night
287

âFâ was taken to Washington and lodged in the old
Capital prison.

General Baker, in a report upon the subject which
he made to Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War,
enclosing this commission, said:

âThis document, undoubtedly authentic and bearing
the genuine signature and private seal of General J.Â E.Â B.
Stuart, is of itself strong evidence of the appreciation
of which âFâsâ treasonable services as a spy and
informer were held by her Rebel employers. The
proof of âFâsâ former employment in the service may
be considered indisputable; that of her more recent
services and especially in connection with the late
attack upon our outpost at Fairfax Court House is
not less conclusive; that proof consists in the voluntary
acknowledgment and declaration by âFâ that she
made herself acquainted while a resident within our
lines at Fairfax Court House of all the particulars
relating to the numbers of our forces there and in the
neighborhood, the location of our camps, the places
where officersâ quarters were established, the precise
points where our pickets were stationed, the strength
of the outposts, the names of officers in command, the
nature of general orders and all other information
valuable to the Rebel leaders; that such information
had been communicated by her to Captain Mosby of
the Confederate Army immediately before the attack
on our outposts above mentioned; and that it has been
in consequence of the precision and correctness of
such information that Captain Mosby had been enabled
successfully to attack and surprise the pickets and outposts
288

of our forces, to find without delay or difficulty
the quarters of General Stoughton and other United
States officers, to capture that officer and a large
amount of Government property and effect a large
return within the Confederate lines.

ââFâ also stated to my informant that Captain
Mosby had, but a short time before the rebel raid at
Fairfax, been a guest at âFâsâ house at that place,
that he had remained there three days and three nights,
disguised in citizenâs dress and that during such visit
she had given to him all the information and details
which afterward enabled him successfully to attack
our forces. âFâ also stated that on an occasion while
she was taking a ride on horseback, accompanied by a
member of General Stoughtonâs staff, they were met
by Captain Mosby, also on horseback, but in citizenâs
dress and that she and Captain Mosby recognized and
saluted each other.â

The official histories of the Civil War are singularly
silent regarding the fate of the celebrated âF.â Was
she tried and convicted? Or was she acquitted and
released? Her identity was proven, but it is not written
in the records of the war, and consequently it is
not given in this narrative. It is known that President
Lincoln, with his shrewd, common sense, and his wonderful
ability to make the best of perplexing situations,
did not look upon the girl as a dreadful offender.
But if he was not willing to condemn her, he was not
disposed to formally condone her offense. What happened
to her? Can it be possible that the door of her
cell was conveniently left open one night, and that on
289

the following morning she was not found in her accustomed
place? Quite likely. At all events the reader
is free to draw any conclusion he, or she, may like.

One thing certain is that she did return to her home
in Virginia, and that her descendants are to-day among
the residents of the Old Dominion.

XVIII

THE MYSTERIOUS MAN WHO ASKED
FOR A LIGHT

One
afternoon in the summer of 1898, a shrewd,
bright-eyed looking man stepped up to another
man in a corridor of a hotel in Toronto, Canada,
and asked him if he would give him a light for
his cigarette.

A trivial incident, one might say, and yet upon that
insignificant episode rested a movement which had for
its object the ridding of the United States of Spanish
spies in the war which was then going on between this
country and the Kingdom of Spain.

In order to make this veracious record perfectly
clear it is necessary to retrace our steps. For many
months prior to the time mentioned, the relations
between the United States and Spain had been greatly
strained because of the troublesome Cuban situation.
President McKinley had entered a serious protest to
the King of Spain, and told him that it was important
for our peace that the Cubans should be pacified. But
they were not pacified, and things went on from bad
to worse until they came to a startling and dramatic
climax on the fifteenth of February, 1898, when the
cruiser
Maine
was blown up in the harbor of Havana
and a number of Americans were killed.

294

A wave of indignation swept the country from
Maine to California. A chorus went up from all
classes in favor of demanding satisfaction from Spainâfor,
in the popular mind, Spain was responsible for
the outrage. The cry everywhere was âRemember
the
Maine
!â Prior to that time the Spanish Minister
had been recalled from Washington because of an
indiscretion, and now our Minister at Madrid, General
Woodford, was handed his passports, and on April 22,
President McKinley issued a proclamation saying that
a state of war existed between this nation and Spain.

That is history and is known to all. What followed
is likewise history, but it is by no means so well known.
The first act of the State Department was to inform
all of the members of the staff of the Spanish Embassyâin
polite language, of courseâthat their room was
preferable to their company. This seemed like a matter
of form that did not deserve much thought. And
the State Department, having served the required notice,
promptly forgot it. But there was one bureau
of the United States Government where it was kept in
mind, and that was the Secret Service Division.

JOHN E. WILKIE

John E. Wilkie was then the Chief of that most
important branch of the Treasury Department, and he
had been voted a modest sum by Congress for the
purpose of keeping the country free from spies.
Heretofore his work had been to keep the nation free
from counterfeiters. In both cases he was dealing
with crafty and elusive enemies. He proceeded to
build up a war organization and he posted his best men
in the large cities of this country and Canada. In his
295

office he had a large map of the United States, and by
the use of steel pins he could tell at a glance just where
his operatives were located. Thus he had men acting
as the eyes and the ears of the Government in the
cities of Montreal, Toronto, New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, Newport News, Savannah, Jacksonville,
Tampa, Key West, Mobile, New Orleans, Galveston
and San Francisco.

Now, when the members of the staff of the Spanish
Embassy were told to get out of the country Wilkie
determined to make it his business to see that they did
get out. To make sure, he furnished them with an
escortâan invisible escortâin the person of the
operatives of the Secret Service Division. He suspected
that some of them would be so interested in the
game of war that they might be tempted to remain on
this side of the ocean and take part in the game. And
his suspicions were perfectly correct. For instance,
Ramon Carranza, who had been Naval AttachÃ© at
Washington, found it convenient to linger in the city
of Toronto. That would have been perfectly proper
if he had not been found talking to a person who was
far from proper.

And this is where this story really beginsâwith
the episode of the man who asked for a light in the
semi-darkened corridor of a Toronto hotel. The operative
who had been sent to the Canadian city by
Chief Wilkie happened to stop at the same hotel as
the former AttachÃ© of the Spanish Embassy. By a
curious coincidence he happened to get a room directly
adjoining the one occupied by SeÃ±or Carranza. And,
296

moreover, he happened to see every one that came in
or out of that room. Also, he overheard some of the
conversation that went on in the apartment. Thus
on the afternoon with which we are concerned he saw
a man with a hang-dog look go into the room, and
from time to time he caught fragments of conversation.
One of the things he heard the Visitor say was âso I
will write to the address you have given me in Montreal.â
There was some further talk, which could
only be heard indistinctly, but the listener managed to
discover that the man who was doing the talking had a
surprising knowledge of the conditions at the Brooklyn
Navy Yard. Presently the conversation came to an
end and the visitor left the room. The listener left
his room at the same moment, and he came into contact
with the other man in the hallway. As they
gained the head of the stairway he turned to the
strange talker in the most casual manner and said:

âI beg your pardon, but will you kindly favor me
with a light for my cigarette?â

The mysterious stranger halted and courteously
complied with the request. And in those few seconds
in that dim hallway, by the light of the burning match,
the Secret Service operative obtained what he most
desiredâa view of the other manâs face. In that
brief period of time the characteristics of the suspect
were indelibly stamped upon his memory. The two
men parted. The one who had been closeted with the
former Naval AttachÃ© of the Spanish Embassy went
out into the street and proceeded to a remote part of
the city. He went to an obscure hotel and registered
297

and was given a room. The operative of the Secret
Service followed him and at the first convenient opportunity
he scrutinized the hotel register. The name he
found inscribed thereon was âAlexander Cree.â His
theory was that it was an assumed name. At all
events he shadowed his man. He watched his every
movement, and soon afterwards he sent a code telegram
to John E. Wilkie, the Chief of the Secret Service
at Washington.

The scene now shifts to the National Capital. Mr.
Wilkie was still in his office occupied with the duties
which pressed heavily upon a man in charge of an important
department, and whose force was scarcely large
enough for the work they were called upon to do day
by day at a most critical stage in the history of the
nation. Shortly before midnight the telegram came
from Toronto. It was given to the code man of the
office and in a short time he had transcribed it. In
plain English it read as follows:

âYoung Southerner, Alexander Cree, of Hillsboro,
I think, leaves for Washington to-night. My height
and build, small, dark moustache, black soft felt hat,
black sack coat, black sailor tie, somewhat shabby, evidently
served on
Brooklyn
, has intimate knowledge of
Naval matters. Just had long interview with Naval
AttachÃ©. He is to write to Montreal.â

This was news with a vengeance. There was great
activity about the offices of the Secret Service Division
that night. Several of the best men who were in the
city were quickly summoned and given a description
of the man who was expected from Canada. It was
298

almost midnight when Chief Wilkie left for his home,
but when he quit the Department to get a few hoursâ
sleep it was with the knowledge that he had made
arrangements for giving Mr. Cree a hospitable reception
upon his arrival in Washington.

That night every railroad station leading into the
Capital was closely guarded by Secret Service men.
They carefully scrutinized every passenger who
alighted, paying special attention to those who were
likely to have come from Canada. It was a big job,
but it was performed with thoroughness. Many a
passenger that night must have been annoyed at the
manner in which he was watched by the alert representatives
of the United States Government. But, if
they felt any annoyance, they must have realized that
they were living in war times and must expect all
sorts of queer things. Finally, âMr. Alexander
Creeâ arrived, and it is significant of the efficiency of
the system that he was immediately spotted by the
waiting detectives. The description sent by the operative
at Toronto had served them well. They recognized
him as easily as if they were in possession of his
photograph.

From that moment there was a Secret Service man
watching him. When one man was tired another
quickly took his place, and, as a consequence, there was
not a thing he did, and scarcely a thing he said, that
was not known to Chief Wilkie a few hours afterwards.
His first move was to get something to eat,
which was an entirely natural and by no means an
unpatriotic act. But after that he went to the Navy
299

Department, and apparently wandered about in an
aimless manner. But, as a matter of fact, he had a
purpose in visiting that place. Just whether some one
in the Department was acting in collusion with him
was not clearly established. Finally he went to his
lodgings on E Street. He occupied a second-story
room, and as soon as he reached it he made a light and
settled down to work before a desk which could be seen
from the street. Evidently a quantity of mail had
accumulated during his absence in the Dominion, because
he was occupied for some time in opening and
reading letters. For hours he remained there silhouetted
against the window shade while the Secret Service
men on the opposite side of the street observed every
move he made.

Thus, while Washington slept, an enemy of the
Republic and its defenders engaged in a game that was
to have the greatest bearing upon the conduct of the
war. It is difficult to decide which was the most
amazing, the daring and impudence of the conspirator
in thus working under the very dome of the Capitol,
or the pertinacity and bull-dog determination of the
Secret Service operatives in keeping this man under
their constant supervision. It began to look as if he
would never go to bed. But presently there was a
movement in the room and in a few minutes the dark-complexioned
man in the soft hat came out of the
house and walked across the street in the direction of a
letter box. He opened the lid and slid a long envelope
into the aperture. Then he turned and went back to
his lodgings. In a little while the light was extinguished
300

and then âAlexander Creeâ retired to sleep
the sleepâif not of the just at least of the industrious
man.

But the Secret Service operatives did not go to
sleep. They were more alert than ever. One man
kept guard over the lodgings of the suspect and the
other remained by the side of the letter box. At daylight
he got into communication with Chief Wilkie,
and as a consequence of his report an arrangement
was made with the Postmaster of Washington by
which that particular letter box was opened, and the
particular missive dropped into the box by the man
from Toronto turned over to Chief Wilkie. A short
time later a âcouncil of warâ was held in the office
of the Chief of the Secret Service. The object of
interest was the suspected letter. It was in an ordinary
white, oblong envelope, and it was addressed to
F.Â W. Dicken, 1248 Dorchester Street, Montreal, Canada.
The address instantly called to mind the report
of the operative in Toronto. He had heard the mysterious
stranger say to the Naval AttachÃ© âso I am to
write to the address you have given me in Montreal.â
It was evident that they were âgetting warmâ as the
children say in their games. But when the letter was
opened all need for conjecture was past. The amazing
communication read as follows:

âA cipher message has been sent from the Navy
Department to San Francisco directing the Cruiser

Charleston
to proceed to Manila with 500 men and
machinery for repairs to Dewey. A long cipher has
been received from Dewey at Department at 3.30
301

oâclock. They are translating it now. Cannot find
it out yet. Have heard important news respecting
movements of colliers and cruisers.
Newark
at Norfolk
Navy Yard; also about the new Holland boat, as
to what they intend to do with her and her destination,
I shall go to Norfolk soon to find important news.
My address will be Norfolk House, Norfolk, Virginia,
but shall not go until Tuesday.â

This was signed âG.Â D.â and was marked âin
haste.â The first move of Chief Wilkie was to make
sure that the man was guarded. His investigations
proved that there was no possibility of âG.Â D.â escaping
from Washington. Then he got into communication
with the Secretary of War and the Secretary of
the Navy and informed them of the information that
had been intercepted. The immediate effect of this
was to tighten the discipline in each of these Departments.
All unauthorized persons were to be kept out
of the building and a strict watch was kept upon all of
the employees. The inference was that some one in
the Navy Department had been co-operating with âG.
D.â and that this person had supplied him with information
upon his return from Canada.

The question of taking the spy into custody was next
considered. It was decided that this should be done
at once. As it was a matter that technically came under
the military power of the Government, Chief Wilkie
made application to the War Department, and as a
result of this Captain Saye of the Eighth Artillery,
with a corporal and one other man, was ordered to
report to him for duty. Thus fortified, the head of
302

the Secret Service Division started for the apartment
on E Street. The little procession going from the
Treasury Department attracted very little attention,
and the passers-by did not realize what was going on.
But all of those in the little group understood the importance
of their mission so far as the Government
was concerned.

It was eleven oâclock at night and when they arrived
at the house occupied by âG.Â D.â they discovered a
light burning in the second-story room. It was evident
that the spy was continuing his habits of industry.
The Chief gained admission without any difficulty,
and, followed by the others, made for the upper
room. The supposed Alexander Cree was sitting at
his desk engaged in writing. He seemed surprised at
the intrusion, but received his callers politely. Evidently
his calling had accustomed him to visits at all
hours of the day and night.

âWell, gentlemen,â he said, âwhat can I do for
you?â

âTo start with,â said the spokesman of the invading
party, âwe would like to have the letter you are writing
and all of the documents you have in that desk.â

For the first time he showed surprise. He smiled
faintly and then rejoined:

âPerhaps you will let me know the cause of this
unexpected visit.â

âCertainly. We have come to arrest you as a
spy!â

Cree turned very white. He steadied himself by
resting against the side of a bureau. It was some
303

moments before he was able to speak, and then moistening
his lips with the tip of his tongue he murmured:

âWho are you, and what authority have you got for
talking in this manner?â

âItâs no use, young man,â was the quick retort, âwe
have the goods on you, and if you have any doubt
about it we can show you the letter which you mailed to
Montreal and which has been intercepted by the United
States Government.â

The spy looked at the speaker helplessly. His white
face contrasted sharply with his black moustache.
For a moment he swayed uncertainly, and fell to the
floor in a heap. He was a most abject spectacle, and it
was necessary to carry him out of the room. That
night he spent in a cell, facing a charge of treason
against the Government, and wondering what his fate
would be.

A mass of compromising letters and papers were
found in the room. From some of these it was proven
that âG.Â D.â was a naturalized citizen and a former
yeoman on the cruiser
Brooklyn
. What had prompted
him to turn against his own country? Could it have
been some grievance, real or fancied? Was it
Spanish gold? Chief Wilkie discovered many interesting
things among the papers that were found in the
room on E Street. Among them was a slip of paper
which contained what is known as Slaterâs Code. It
said: âTo send add 100; to receive subtract 100.â
This was the key to the cipher which he was to employ
in sending messages to his employers. The cipher
contained thousands of ordinary words arranged
304

alphabetically and having fixed consecutive numbers
of five figures each. Why he had not employed it in
the compromising communication to Montreal was
never known. Possibly over-confidence had made him
careless for the moment.

In the meantime Chief Wilkie had his organization
working overtime. The United States map in his
office containing the little steel pins to indicate the position
of his men in different parts of the United States
and Canada was consulted repeatedly during the next
twenty-four hours. Telegrams in code were sent in
all directions. As the result another spy was captured
in Tampa, Florida. By one of the curious freaks of
fate this man was critically ill when he was taken into
custody and died shortly afterwards. But the greatest
activity was in Canada. It was learned that the
Dorchester Street house had only been leased a few
days before, and that it was intended as the rendezvous
of the Spanish spies in Canada. It was clear
that a private detective agency had been organized in
Canada for the purpose of obtaining information concerning
the movements of the American troops.

Another amazing thing that was discovered in connection
with this spy system related to the manner in
which these men were to work. They were to join
the United States army and to go with the army of
invasion into Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines.
When the opportunity offered they were to permit
themselves to be captured by the Spanish soldiers.
After furnishing all of the information possible to the
enemy they were to return to the American lines and
305

continue their system of espionage. All of this was
worked out with the greatest attention to detail. Each
one of the spies was supplied with a plain gold or silver
ring. On this was engraved the words âConfienza
Augustine.â That was to be their means of identification
to the Spanish Generals. Needless to say, the discovery
of the plot nipped that scheme in the bud, and
rendered it useless for the remainder of the war.

But what Chief Wilkie and his associates desired
more than anything else was some evidence to directly
connect the members of the late Spanish Embassy with
the operations of âG.Â D.â and the plot in Canada. It
came sooner than was expected. One of the Secret
Service operatives who investigated the Dorchester
Street house found some letters which established this
connection. One of them was a communication from
Ramon Carranza to SeÃ±or Don Jose Gomez Ymas.
It was short and sweet. It said: âWe have had bad
luck for they have captured two of our best spiesâone
in Washington and the other in Tampa.â

This made it appear that the former Naval AttachÃ©
was quite as indiscreet as the supposed Alexander Cree.
At all events, the evidence in the case was furnished to
Lord Pauncefoote, the English Ambassador to Washington,
and, upon his representations, the Canadian
authorities made it their business to deport the entire
Spanish outfit.

Two days later the Chief of the Secret Service
Division went to the jail at the National Capital for
the purpose of interviewing the man who had permitted
himself to be made a dupe of the Spanish Government.
306

When the door of the cell was opened a dreadful
sight met his eyes:

âG.Â D.,â the chief spy of the Spanish-American war,
had hanged himselfâa dramatic and horrible climax
to one of the most interesting incidents in American
history.

XIX

CARL LODY AND SPIES OF THE
WORLDâS GREATEST WAR

The
worldâs greatest armed conflict which began
with Austriaâs declaration of war against Servia
on July 28, 1914, and which has since involved
most of the important nations of the earth, has
produced hundreds, nay, thousands of spies, but the
very secrecy which is so necessary to their work has
prevented many of them from looming conspicuously
in the public eye.

The grim old Tower of London could tell many a
sensational tale if its stone walls had the power of
speech. At an early period of the war it was estimated
that at least a dozen spies had been executed in
the Tower.

That being the case, how many spies were shot without
the formality of being brought to the capital for
trial? How many were executed after hurried
âdrum-headâ court martials? It is safe to say that
hundreds perished and that most of them will go down
into history unnamed and unknown, unhonored and
unsung.

Every one of the nations at war has utilized spies of
one class or another. They were captured within the
310

lines disguised as women, as war correspondentsâeven
as priests. In the very heart of the city of London
they were caught masquerading as waiters, as cab
drivers, and even as clerks in establishments, both manufacturing
and dispensing munitions of war.

Now and then there were glimpses of these war
tragedies which for reasons of expediency are destined
never to see the light of day. In spite of the censors
there were fragments of stories teeming with red
blood and human interest, even if not of historic importance.

The censorship on war news was strict, but it did
not begin to compare with that applied to everything
connected with the apprehension, trial and execution of
spies. As a rule, there was no mention at all of these
tragic affairs, although earlier in the war readers of
the London newspapers might have found in the corner
of an inside column two or three lines merely announcing
that another foreign spy had met his doom.
Who can describe the pathos and tragedy lurking
behind those few words of cold type?

One day a squad of soldiers escorted a prisoner into
the grim gates of the Tower. He had been caught
making tracings of a barracks somewhere, and he was
going to suffer the penalty of espionageâwhich is
death. It is true that he was assured of a trial that
day, but he saw inscribed over the entrance to the
Tower, âAbandon hope, all ye who enter here.â One
could see the ashy look on the poor devilâs face as he
went through the Traitorsâ Gate, and one could imagine
all of the details of the impending business after he
311

should be escorted into the Lower Green, where all of
the official executions take place.

Women spies were numerous in this war, and as a
rule they were more successful at this business than the
men. One of them had herself banished as a suspicious
character from the German border. This was
done in order to deceive the English more easily. At
one of the barracks outside of London she soon won a
host of admirers among the younger officers. It happened
that Kitchener was due about this time on a
visit of inspection and the woman determined to exercise
her wiles on him. Did she succeed? Let the
man who tells the story answer that question.

âOne glance at the gaunt figure, rugged face and
piercing eyes of the man who had avenged Chinese
Gordon robbed her of her assurance. She realized
that this man, instead of being a puppet, would be a
master. She fled for her life and was never seen
again.â

Some time after that Felice Schmidt made her
appearance at Marseilles in the rÃ´le of an apple seller.
She was in that neighborhood for many days and evidently
was acquainting herself with the fortifications
with a view to informing the Germans of the conditions
existing there. She was young and beautiful
and spoke French with a fluency that deceived the soldiers
and the natives of the town. The French soldiers,
with characteristic gallantry, treated her with
much consideration. But one day she was found in a
secluded spot making a sketch of one of the big guns.
This led to an investigation. Incriminating papers
312

were found in her possession. She was tried by the
council of war of the Fifteenth Legion, convicted of
espionage and put to death at the Lighthouse shooting
range.

Whatever feeling the British public have had against
Carl Lody as a German spy, they conclude that he went
to his death with the courage of a soldier. Since his
execution it has been whispered that he had a romance
with a young girl in Berlin, and that had he succeeded
in returning to Germany, he would have been welcomed
with open arms by a rosy-cheeked damsel who
loved him for the dangers he had braved. In some
ways his case was similar to that of the unfortunate
Major AndrÃ©, who was captured as a British spy during
the American revolution and condemned to death.
On the night before he was executed, Lody spent his
time in the Tower writing letters to those nearest and
dearest to him. One of these pathetic missives was
addressed to his sister and read as follows:

â
My darling
: I have trusted in my God and He
has decided. Through many of the dangers of life
He has guided me and has always saved me. More
than to millions of others He has shown to me the
beauties of this world and I may not complain. My
hour has struck and I must take my way through the
dark valley as many of my good, brave comrades have
during this dreadful struggle of nations.

âWhere I am going there is no worry and there are
no alarms. May my life be judged worthy to be an
humble sacrifice on the altar of the Fatherland. The
313

death of a hero on the battlefield is perhaps more beautiful,
but that has not been my lot. I die here in a hostile
land, silent and unknown; yet the consciousness
that I die in the service of my country makes death
easier. I shall die as an officer, not a spy.â

It is estimated that nearly one hundred persons have
been tried for espionage in Belgium alone and that at
least thirty of these have been put to death by the Germans.
The list includes a former burgomaster of
Hisselt. The spirit of the Belgians, in spite of their
trying position, has amazed friend and foe alike.

The story of a young woman who tried to serve her
country and the Allies reads like the pages of an old
romance. She managed to get a passport from a German
officer giving her the right to leave Belgium, but
before going she got into the German camp and became
possessed of some valuable information relating to the
future movements of the army. This was sketched
on thin paper, placed inside the lining of her hat. Her
whole aim now was to get out of Belgium without
being searched.

She secured a conveyance and started for the border.
At intervals of every few miles she was halted and
searched.

But as her passport was a letter of recommendation,
these searches were fortunately of a perfunctory
character. At last she reached the point where it was
needful to pass only one more sentinel. As she approached
this point, near the border, she heard the
order:

314

âHaltâwho goes there?â

The vehicle was stopped and the sentinel, after
looking at her papers, made the customary search. It
revealed nothing of a forbidding nature. She was
congratulating herself that all was well when the wife
of a German officer advanced and asked the sentinel:

âHave you looked in the lining of her hat?â

The girlâs heart fell, as well it might. The sentinel
made a second search and found the incriminating document.
She was tried, convicted and shot as a spy.

Another tale relates to a German spy who actually
enlisted with a Scottish regiment in France. He was
blonde and looked like a native of Scotland. Indeed,
there was no trace of German accent in his conversation.
He must have lived in Scotland for some years
as he had an astonishing amount of information concerning
that country. Some of his fellow soldiers
insisted that he even had a bit of burr on his tongue, so
much did his conversation resemble that of a real Scot.
At all events, he is said to have gained command of a
company of Scotch Fusiliers. He gave the order to
charge and led his men into a trap. Whether he tried
to escape is not known, but, at all events, the ruse was
discovered and an investigation made. The result satisfied
the authorities that a spy was in their midst, and
under orders from the colonel of the regiment this pretended
Scot was taken out and shot.

Another case that has caused no end of discussion
concerns a woman known as Fanny La Place. It was
said at one time that she was German and her case has
been compared with that of Edith Cavell, the British
315

nurse who was put to death at Brussels. But this parallel
is denied strenuously by the French, who give out
a statement to the contrary. According to this information,
her right name was Felice Pfast. She was a
French woman born at Nancy in 1890. She went to
Metz in 1914 and later received permission to visit her
mother in Belgium. While there, it is said, a German
official proposed that she gather military information
in Paris. She spent three weeks in Paris and then
reported the results to Germans, who, she admitted,
paid her 5,000 francs to undertake another mission.
She was caught in the act of spying at Marseilles and
admitted she had been commissioned to gather military
information. On July 10 she was unanimously condemned
to death by a court-martial.

Another alleged spy in the great war was Captain
Otto Feinat of the Russian army. He was well
known in Ruman and was in charge of the judicial
proceedings following the Jewish massacres at Kishineff
in 1903. He held responsible military positions
after that, but it was lately claimed that he had been in
some compromising correspondence with some friends
in Germany. The evidence against him was circumstantial.
He protested from the outset that he was
loyal to Russia, but in spite of this he was condemned
and sent to Siberia for a long term of penal servitude.

Was he guilty? Who can tell? He had the consolationâmaybe
a poor consolationâof knowing
that scores of other Russian officers have lately been
sent into banishment on circumstantial evidence.

Then there is the remarkable story of Colonel Miassoyedorff,
316

who was attached to the staff of the Russian
Tenth army corps in East Prussia. The Tenth was
one of those that met with disastrous defeat in the
Mazuirian lake district. It was under the command of
General Rennykampf, and in one of these defeats lost
70,000 prisoners. In a second defeat it lost 50,000.
The circumstances in each case were similar. The
unexpected arrival of a large force of Germans served
to defeat the invaders, and caused them to take to their
heels, thus transforming an anticipated victory into a
most humiliating rout.

WILLIAM J. FLYNN

An investigation was started and all of the circumstances
pointed in the direction of Miassoyedorff, an
interpreter on the staff of the Tenth army. One soldier
said that he recognized Miassoyedorff as a man
who had been connected at one time with the German
army. It was further alleged that at the outbreak of
hostilities he had been the head of the German spy system
and one of the highest officers of the political
police. Charged with these former connections, he
denied them most emphatically.

âI deny the charge,â he cried, âand I defy my enemies
to produce the slightest proof of its truth.â

Further charges were made that while he was in
command of frontier guards at Verjoblova, only a few
miles from the border, he had repeatedly visited the
Kaiser and made reports to him. When asked what
he had to say to this second charge he merely folded
his arms, smiled and said:

âI deny it!â

But appearances were against him, and after the
317

defeats they had just sustained, the Russians were in a
mood to accept any explanation of their humiliation.
So Colonel Miassoyedorff, in spite of his protestations,
was declared guilty and was executed.

Was he an innocent man, or was he the spy of the
Kaiser?

History may tell us the truth, but history in cases of
this kind is just as apt to be in error as contemporaneous
reports. Such men are unknown, unhonored
and unsung for two reasons. The first is that the
very nature of their profession renders it necessary for
them to lead a dual existence. If they are innocent,
their innocence is rarely proclaimed because it would
be an admission of error. And whoever heard of such
an admission? On the other hand, if they are actually
spies those who care for them most would fain permit
their memory to rest in peace.

The story of the activity of German spies in the
United States would make a book in itself, but it would
be disconnected, fragmentary and unsatisfactory.
There have been any number of unproved charges,
any amount of unfinished stories and countless plots
that never came to a head. But enough has been
proven to indicate that this country has been filled with
spies and special agents of the Kaiser. Chief Flynn,
of the United States Secret Service, with the comparatively
small force under his direction, has performed
wonders in ferreting out these offenders against
the peace and honor of this country. Scores of arrests
have been made and there have been a number of
important convictions. Most of these have been in
318

connection with the destruction of munition plants, and
a few have been violations of our laws in an endeavor
to hatch plots against Great Britain and France.

Perhaps the most striking instance of pernicious
activity on the part of German representatives was that
of Captain Karl Boy-Ed and Captain Franz von
Papen, naval and military attachÃ©s, respectively, of the
German Embassy at Washington. For a long time
they were a thorn in the side of the American Government.
The President and the Secretary of State
were reluctant to act because of their desire to preserve
friendly relations with the German nation. Finally,
conditions became unbearable, and on the last of October,
1916, the State Department asked for the recall
of Boy-Ed and von Papen. It was announced at the
time that the action of this Government against the
German attachÃ©s was due to no single incident in either
case, but was based on an accumulation of improper
activities connected with the handling of German military
and naval matters in this country. It was hinted
at the time that one of the strongest reasons for the action
was the connection of one of the attachÃ©s with a
movement to set up a scheme in Mexico detrimental to
the interests of the United States.

One can only marvel at the patience of our Government
under the circumstances. Captain Boy-Edâs
name at the time was prominently mentioned in connection
with the Richard Peter Stengel passport case,
with the Werner Horn dynamiting case, and with the
queer diplomatic fiasco in connection with the case of
Dr. Constantine Dumba, the Austrian Ambassador.
319

Germany informed the United States on December 6,
1916, that she desired to know upon what grounds the
State Department asked for the withdrawal of Captains
Boy-Ed and von Papen. Secretary Lansing, on
the following day, replied that the military and naval
activities of the attachÃ©s constituted their principal
offense, but did not discuss the facts or the sources of
information. On December 10, Count von Bernstoff,
the German Ambassador, informed Secretary Lansing
that the German Emperor had acquiesced in the request
of the United States for the withdrawal of the attachÃ©s,
and before the end of the year both of them had departed
for Germany.

Events moved rapidly in the United States after
that. On Saturday, February 3, Ambassador Bernstoff
was given his passports, and on April 6, 1917, the
Congress, upon the recommendation of the President,
declared that a state of war existed with Germany.
From that day forth the Secret Service, and all of the
forces of the Government were used in rounding up
and arresting spies and suspects.

Many hundreds of arrests Were made by Secret
Service agents and other officers of the Government
and a score of convictions secured. A large number
of suspected persons were interned at Fort Oglethorpe,
in Georgia. Probably not one of the arrested persons
could be ranked as a great military spy, and yet when
all of their activities were pieced together they must
have been of great value to the Imperial German Government.
The varied character of the work they were
doing for the enemy indicated that it must have been
320

more or less systematized, and that it was in all probability
under the direction of some one person acting
as the master spy.

For instance, on the 15th of July, 1917, an alien was
indicted by the Federal Grand Jury, in New Orleans,
on the charge of being a spy. It was learned that the
man had been hovering in the neighborhood of the
local naval station for many days at a time. Once he
was seen to be making notes in a book. At a given
time his rooms were searched, and the authorities
found a number of blue prints and plans of the naval
station in his possession. He was indicted on the
charge of obtaining this information clandestinely
âand for the purpose of supplying it to the enemy, the
Imperial German Government, against the peace and
dignity of the United States.â The case attracted
much interest because it was the first time since the
days of reconstruction that any one had been indicted
in New Orleans for a plot against the United States.

About the time of the New Orleans incident a German
nobleman was arrested in Toledo, Ohio, for activity
in the interest of the Kaiser. The man had made
a sensational escape from Canada, about eighteen
months previously. He had been arrested in Quebec
on a spy charge, and was being taken in an automobile
to St. Thomas, Ontario. Near the outskirts of the
town he attacked the official who was driving the car,
and knocking him into a state of insensibility, escaped.
He took the badge and the revolver of the stricken
man, and made his way to the United States, coming
into this country by way of the Niagara Falls bridge.
321

He admitted that he had once been a captain in the
German army, but denied that he had engaged in any
unlawful business in the United States.

In the early days of the participation of the United
States in the war, and when the people of this country
did not even know of the departure of our war vessels
for the other side of the Atlantic, the fact of their departure
was published in Berlin, four days before they
actually arrived in Queenstown. This was a serious
leak, to say the least. The American newspapers scrupulously
observed the request of the Secretary of the
Navy to avoid publishing the date of the departure or
arrival of any vessel. Where did the Berlin authorities
obtain their information? That was a question
which agitated many persons. It was solved when
the Secret Service, early in July, of 1917, arrested
three men in New York, for conducting a private
postal service, in the interest of Germany. It was
claimed that for months they had been sending âmailâ
to Scandinavian countries for transmission to Germany.
These letters were entrusted to the sailors on
the ships, and ordered to be handed to certain persons
in Norway and Sweden, and by them sent to their destination
in the German Capital.

Several bundles of these letters were seized by the
representatives of the American Government. It is a
significant fact that many of them were in code. They
came from all parts of the United States, and from
Mexico and South and Central America. The letters
were written in English, Spanish and German. Some
of them were business communications, and were admittedly
322

harmless. It was proven that this novel
âmail serviceâ worked in both directions, letters going
to and from Germany. It was also shown that remote
parts of Mexico were in wireless communication with
Berlin. Significance was also attached to the fact that
parts of wireless outfits had been brought in on some
of the Scandinavian boats, and that these were afterward
erected in Mexico. None of the men were subjected
to any pressure on the part of United States officials,
and all were told that they had the right to be
represented by counsel, if they so desired.

But these arrests in different sections of the country,
almost simultaneously, and the varied character of the
activity of the men involved, helps to confirm the statement,
made on the floor of the Senate, that during and
before the war, we had thousands of German spies in
the United States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

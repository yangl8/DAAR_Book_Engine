âUnexpected obstacle. Please donât come till thirtieth. Anna.â

All the way from Charing Cross to Dover the train had hammered the words
of the telegram into George Darrowâs ears, ringing every change of irony
on its commonplace syllables: rattling them out like a discharge of
musketry, letting them, one by one, drip slowly and coldly into his brain,
or shaking, tossing, transposing them like the dice in some game of the
gods of malice; and now, as he emerged from his compartment at the pier,
and stood facing the wind-swept platform and the angry sea beyond, they
leapt out at him as if from the crest of the waves, stung and blinded him
with a fresh fury of derision.

âUnexpected obstacle. Please donât come till thirtieth. Anna.â

She had put him off at the very last moment, and for the second time: put
him off with all her sweet reasonableness, and for one of her usual âgoodâ
reasons—he was certain that this reason, like the other, (the visit
of her husbandâs uncleâs widow) would be âgoodâ! But it was that very
certainty which chilled him. The fact of her dealing so reasonably with
their case shed an ironic light on the idea that there had been any
exceptional warmth in the greeting she had given him after their twelve
years apart.

They had found each other again, in London, some three months previously,
at a dinner at the American Embassy, and when she had caught sight of him
her smile had been like a red rose pinned on her widowâs mourning. He
still felt the throb of surprise with which, among the stereotyped faces
of the seasonâs diners, he had come upon her unexpected face, with the
dark hair banded above grave eyes; eyes in which he had recognized every
little curve and shadow as he would have recognized, after half a
life-time, the details of a room he had played in as a child. And as, in
the plumed starred crowd, she had stood out for him, slender, secluded and
different, so he had felt, the instant their glances met, that he as
sharply detached himself for her. All that and more her smile had said;
had said not merely âI remember,â but âI remember just what you rememberâ;
almost, indeed, as though her memory had aided his, her glance flung back
on their recaptured moment its morning brightness. Certainly, when their
distracted Ambassadress—with the cry: âOh, you know Mrs. Leath?
Thatâs perfect, for General Farnham has failed meâ—had waved them
together for the march to the dining-room, Darrow had felt a slight
pressure of the arm on his, a pressure faintly but unmistakably
emphasizing the exclamation: âIsnât it wonderful?—In London—in
the season—in a mob?â

Little enough, on the part of most women; but it was a sign of Mrs.
Leathâs quality that every movement, every syllable, told with her. Even
in the old days, as an intent grave-eyed girl, she had seldom misplaced
her light strokes; and Darrow, on meeting her again, had immediately felt
how much finer and surer an instrument of expression she had become.

Their evening together had been a long confirmation of this feeling. She
had talked to him, shyly yet frankly, of what had happened to her during
the years when they had so strangely failed to meet. She had told him of
her marriage to Fraser Leath, and of her subsequent life in France, where
her husbandâs mother, left a widow in his youth, had been re-married to
the Marquis de Chantelle, and where, partly in consequence of this second
union, the son had permanently settled himself. She had spoken also, with
an intense eagerness of affection, of her little girl Effie, who was now
nine years old, and, in a strain hardly less tender, of Owen Leath, the
charming clever young stepson whom her husbandâs death had left to her
care...

A porter, stumbling against Darrowâs bags, roused him to the fact that he
still obstructed the platform, inert and encumbering as his luggage.

âCrossing, sir?â

Was he crossing? He really didnât know; but for lack of any more
compelling impulse he followed the porter to the luggage van, singled out
his property, and turned to march behind it down the gang-way. As the
fierce wind shouldered him, building up a crystal wall against his
efforts, he felt anew the derision of his case.

âNasty weather to cross, sir,â the porter threw back at him as they beat
their way down the narrow walk to the pier. Nasty weather, indeed; but
luckily, as it had turned out, there was no earthly reason why Darrow
should cross.

While he pushed on in the wake of his luggage his thoughts slipped back
into the old groove. He had once or twice run across the man whom Anna
Summers had preferred to him, and since he had met her again he had been
exercising his imagination on the picture of what her married life must
have been. Her husband had struck him as a characteristic specimen of the
kind of American as to whom one is not quite clear whether he lives in
Europe in order to cultivate an art, or cultivates an art as a pretext for
living in Europe. Mr. Leathâs art was water-colour painting, but he
practised it furtively, almost clandestinely, with the disdain of a man of
the world for anything bordering on the professional, while he devoted
himself more openly, and with religious seriousness, to the collection of
enamelled snuff-boxes. He was blond and well-dressed, with the physical
distinction that comes from having a straight figure, a thin nose, and the
habit of looking slightly disgusted—as who should not, in a world
where authentic snuff-boxes were growing daily harder to find, and the
market was flooded with flagrant forgeries?

Darrow had often wondered what possibilities of communion there could have
been between Mr. Leath and his wife. Now he concluded that there had
probably been none. Mrs. Leathâs words gave no hint of her husbandâs
having failed to justify her choice; but her very reticence betrayed her.
She spoke of him with a kind of impersonal seriousness, as if he had been
a character in a novel or a figure in history; and what she said sounded
as though it had been learned by heart and slightly dulled by repetition.
This fact immensely increased Darrowâs impression that his meeting with
her had annihilated the intervening years. She, who was always so elusive
and inaccessible, had grown suddenly communicative and kind: had opened
the doors of her past, and tacitly left him to draw his own conclusions.
As a result, he had taken leave of her with the sense that he was a being
singled out and privileged, to whom she had entrusted something precious
to keep. It was her happiness in their meeting that she had given him, had
frankly left him to do with as he willed; and the frankness of the gesture
doubled the beauty of the gift.

Their next meeting had prolonged and deepened the impression. They had
found each other again, a few days later, in an old country house full of
books and pictures, in the soft landscape of southern England. The
presence of a large party, with all its aimless and agitated
displacements, had served only to isolate the pair and give them (at least
to the young manâs fancy) a deeper feeling of communion, and their days
there had been like some musical prelude, where the instruments, breathing
low, seem to hold back the waves of sound that press against them.

Mrs. Leath, on this occasion, was no less kind than before; but she
contrived to make him understand that what was so inevitably coming was
not to come too soon. It was not that she showed any hesitation as to the
issue, but rather that she seemed to wish not to miss any stage in the
gradual reflowering of their intimacy.

Darrow, for his part, was content to wait if she wished it. He remembered
that once, in America, when she was a girl, and he had gone to stay with
her family in the country, she had been out when he arrived, and her
mother had told him to look for her in the garden. She was not in the
garden, but beyond it he had seen her approaching down a long shady path.
Without hastening her step she had smiled and signed to him to wait; and
charmed by the lights and shadows that played upon her as she moved, and
by the pleasure of watching her slow advance toward him, he had obeyed her
and stood still. And so she seemed now to be walking to him down the
years, the light and shade of old memories and new hopes playing variously
on her, and each step giving him the vision of a different grace. She did
not waver or turn aside; he knew she would come straight to where he
stood; but something in her eyes said âWaitâ, and again he obeyed and
waited.

On the fourth day an unexpected event threw out his calculations. Summoned
to town by the arrival in England of her husbandâs mother, she left
without giving Darrow the chance he had counted on, and he cursed himself
for a dilatory blunderer. Still, his disappointment was tempered by the
certainty of being with her again before she left for France; and they did
in fact see each other in London. There, however, the atmosphere had
changed with the conditions. He could not say that she avoided him, or
even that she was a shade less glad to see him; but she was beset by
family duties and, as he thought, a little too readily resigned to them.

The Marquise de Chantelle, as Darrow soon perceived, had the same mild
formidableness as the late Mr. Leath: a sort of insistent self-effacement
before which every one about her gave way. It was perhaps the shadow of
this ladyâs presence—pervasive even during her actual brief eclipses—that
subdued and silenced Mrs. Leath. The latter was, moreover, preoccupied
about her stepson, who, soon after receiving his degree at Harvard, had
been rescued from a stormy love-affair, and finally, after some months of
troubled drifting, had yielded to his step-motherâs counsel and gone up to
Oxford for a year of supplementary study. Thither Mrs. Leath went once or
twice to visit him, and her remaining days were packed with family
obligations: getting, as she phrased it, âfrocks and governessesâ for her
little girl, who had been left in France, and having to devote the
remaining hours to long shopping expeditions with her mother-in-law.
Nevertheless, during her brief escapes from duty, Darrow had had time to
feel her safe in the custody of his devotion, set apart for some
inevitable hour; and the last evening, at the theatre, between the
overshadowing Marquise and the unsuspicious Owen, they had had an almost
decisive exchange of words.

Now, in the rattle of the wind about his ears, Darrow continued to hear
the mocking echo of her message: âUnexpected obstacle.â In such an
existence as Mrs. Leathâs, at once so ordered and so exposed, he knew how
small a complication might assume the magnitude of an âobstacle;â yet,
even allowing as impartially as his state of mind permitted for the fact
that, with her mother-in-law always, and her stepson intermittently, under
her roof, her lot involved a hundred small accommodations generally
foreign to the freedom of widowhood—even so, he could not but think
that the very ingenuity bred of such conditions might have helped her to
find a way out of them. No, her âreasonâ, whatever it was, could, in this
case, be nothing but a pretext; unless he leaned to the less flattering
alternative that any reason seemed good enough for postponing him!
Certainly, if her welcome had meant what he imagined, she could not, for
the second time within a few weeks, have submitted so tamely to the
disarrangement of their plans; a disarrangement which—his official
duties considered—might, for all she knew, result in his not being
able to go to her for months.

âPlease donât come till thirtieth.â The thirtieth—and it was now the
fifteenth! She flung back the fortnight on his hands as if he had been an
idler indifferent to dates, instead of an active young diplomatist who, to
respond to her call, had had to hew his way through a very jungle of
engagements! âPlease donât come till thirtieth.â That was all. Not the
shadow of an excuse or a regret; not even the perfunctory âhave writtenâ
with which it is usual to soften such blows. She didnât want him, and had
taken the shortest way to tell him so. Even in his first moment of
exasperation it struck him as characteristic that she should not have
padded her postponement with a fib. Certainly her moral angles were not
draped!

âIf I asked her to marry me, sheâd have refused in the same language. But
thank heaven I havenât!â he reflected.

These considerations, which had been with him every yard of the way from
London, reached a climax of irony as he was drawn into the crowd on the
pier. It did not soften his feelings to remember that, but for her lack of
forethought, he might, at this harsh end of the stormy May day, have been
sitting before his club fire in London instead of shivering in the damp
human herd on the pier. Admitting the sexâs traditional right to change,
she might at least have advised him of hers by telegraphing directly to
his rooms. But in spite of their exchange of letters she had apparently
failed to note his address, and a breathless emissary had rushed from the
Embassy to pitch her telegram into his compartment as the train was moving
from the station.

Yes, he had given her chance enough to learn where he lived; and this
minor proof of her indifference became, as he jammed his way through the
crowd, the main point of his grievance against her and of his derision of
himself. Half way down the pier the prod of an umbrella increased his
exasperation by rousing him to the fact that it was raining. Instantly the
narrow ledge became a battle-ground of thrusting, slanting, parrying
domes. The wind rose with the rain, and the harried wretches exposed to
this double assault wreaked on their neighbours the vengeance they could
not take on the elements.

Darrow, whose healthy enjoyment of life made him in general a good
traveller, tolerant of agglutinated humanity, felt himself obscurely
outraged by these promiscuous contacts. It was as though all the people
about him had taken his measure and known his plight; as though they were
contemptuously bumping and shoving him like the inconsiderable thing he
had become. âShe doesnât want you, doesnât want you, doesnât want you,â
their umbrellas and their elbows seemed to say.

He had rashly vowed, when the telegram was flung into his window: âAt any
rate I wonât turn backâ—as though it might cause the sender a
malicious joy to have him retrace his steps rather than keep on to Paris!
Now he perceived the absurdity of the vow, and thanked his stars that he
need not plunge, to no purpose, into the fury of waves outside the
harbour.

With this thought in his mind he turned back to look for his porter; but
the contiguity of dripping umbrellas made signalling impossible and,
perceiving that he had lost sight of the man, he scrambled up again to the
platform. As he reached it, a descending umbrella caught him in the
collar-bone; and the next moment, bent sideways by the wind, it turned
inside out and soared up, kite-wise, at the end of a helpless female arm.

Darrow caught the umbrella, lowered its inverted ribs, and looked up at
the face it exposed to him.

âWait a minute,â he said; âyou canât stay here.â

As he spoke, a surge of the crowd drove the owner of the umbrella abruptly
down on him. Darrow steadied her with extended arms, and regaining her
footing she cried out: âOh, dear, oh, dear! Itâs in ribbons!â

Her lifted face, fresh and flushed in the driving rain, woke in him a
memory of having seen it at a distant time and in a vaguely unsympathetic
setting; but it was no moment to follow up such clues, and the face was
obviously one to make its way on its own merits.

Its possessor had dropped her bag and bundles to clutch at the tattered
umbrella. âI bought it only yesterday at the Stores; and—yes—itâs
utterly done for!â she lamented.

Darrow smiled at the intensity of her distress. It was food for the
moralist that, side by side with such catastrophes as his, human nature
was still agitating itself over its microscopic woes!

âHereâs mine if you want it!â he shouted back at her through the shouting
of the gale.

The offer caused the young lady to look at him more intently. âWhy, itâs
Mr. Darrow!â she exclaimed; and then, all radiant recognition: âOh, thank
you! Weâll share it, if you will.â

She knew him, then; and he knew her; but how and where had they met? He
put aside the problem for subsequent solution, and drawing her into a more
sheltered corner, bade her wait till he could find his porter.

When, a few minutes later, he came back with his recovered property, and
the news that the boat would not leave till the tide had turned, she
showed no concern.

âNot for two hours? How lucky—then I can find my trunk!â

Ordinarily Darrow would have felt little disposed to involve himself in
the adventure of a young female who had lost her trunk; but at the moment
he was glad of any pretext for activity. Even should he decide to take the
next up train from Dover he still had a yawning hour to fill; and the
obvious remedy was to devote it to the loveliness in distress under his
umbrella.

âYouâve lost a trunk? Let me see if I can find it.â

It pleased him that she did not return the conventional âOh,
would
you?â
Instead, she corrected him with a laugh—âNot a trunk, but my trunk;
Iâve no other—â and then added briskly: âYouâd better first see to
getting your own things on the boat.â

This made him answer, as if to give substance to his plans by discussing
them: âI donât actually know that Iâm going over.â

âNot going over?â

âWell ... perhaps not by this boat.â Again he felt a stealing indecision. âI
may probably have to go back to London. Iâm—Iâm waiting ... expecting
a letter...(Sheâll think me a defaulter,â he reflected.) âBut meanwhile
thereâs plenty of time to find your trunk.â

He picked up his companionâs bundles, and offered her an arm which enabled
her to press her slight person more closely under his umbrella; and as,
thus linked, they beat their way back to the platform, pulled together and
apart like marionettes on the wires of the wind, he continued to wonder
where he could have seen her. He had immediately classed her as a
compatriot; her small nose, her clear tints, a kind of sketchy delicacy in
her face, as though she had been brightly but lightly washed in with
water-colour, all confirmed the evidence of her high sweet voice and of
her quick incessant gestures. She was clearly an American, but with the
loose native quality strained through a closer woof of manners: the
composite product of an enquiring and adaptable race. All this, however,
did not help him to fit a name to her, for just such instances were
perpetually pouring through the London Embassy, and the etched and angular
American was becoming rarer than the fluid type.

More puzzling than the fact of his being unable to identify her was the
persistent sense connecting her with something uncomfortable and
distasteful. So pleasant a vision as that gleaming up at him between wet
brown hair and wet brown boa should have evoked only associations as
pleasing; but each effort to fit her image into his past resulted in the
same memories of boredom and a vague discomfort...

II

âDonât you remember me now—at Mrs. Murrettâs?â She threw the
question at Darrow across a table of the quiet coffee-room to which, after
a vainly prolonged quest for her trunk, he had suggested taking her for a
cup of tea.

In this musty retreat she had removed her dripping hat, hung it on the
fender to dry, and stretched herself on tiptoe in front of the round
eagle-crowned mirror, above the mantel vases of dyed immortelles, while
she ran her fingers comb-wise through her hair. The gesture had acted on
Darrowâs numb feelings as the glow of the fire acted on his circulation;
and when he had asked: âArenât your feet wet, too?â and, after frank
inspection of a stout-shod sole, she had answered cheerfully: âNo—luckily
I had on my new boots,â he began to feel that human intercourse would
still be tolerable if it were always as free from formality.

The removal of his companionâs hat, besides provoking this reflection,
gave him his first full sight of her face; and this was so favourable that
the name she now pronounced fell on him with a quite disproportionate
shock of dismay.

âOh, Mrs. Murrettâs—was it
there
?â

He remembered her now, of course: remembered her as one of the shadowy
sidling presences in the background of that awful house in Chelsea, one of
the dumb appendages of the shrieking unescapable Mrs. Murrett, into whose
talons he had fallen in the course of his head-long pursuit of Lady Ulrica
Crispin. Oh, the taste of stale follies! How insipid it was, yet how it
clung!

âI used to pass you on the stairs,â she reminded him.

Yes: he had seen her slip by—he recalled it now—as he dashed
up to the drawing-room in quest of Lady Ulrica. The thought made him steal
a longer look. How could such a face have been merged in the Murrett mob?
Its fugitive slanting lines, that lent themselves to all manner of tender
tilts and foreshortenings, had the freakish grace of some young head of
the Italian comedy. The hair stood up from her forehead in a boyish
elf-lock, and its colour matched her auburn eyes flecked with black, and
the little brown spot on her cheek, between the ear that was meant to have
a rose behind it and the chin that should have rested on a ruff. When she
smiled, the left corner of her mouth went up a little higher than the
right; and her smile began in her eyes and ran down to her lips in two
lines of light. He had dashed past that to reach Lady Ulrica Crispin!

âBut of course you wouldnât remember me,â she was saying. âMy name is
Viner—Sophy Viner.â

Not remember her? But of course he
did
! He was genuinely sure of it now.
âYouâre Mrs. Murrettâs niece,â he declared.

She shook her head. âNo; not even that. Only her reader.â

âHer reader? Do you mean to say she ever reads?â

Miss Viner enjoyed his wonder. âDear, no! But I wrote notes, and made up
the visiting-book, and walked the dogs, and saw bores for her.â

Darrow groaned. âThat must have been rather bad!â

âYes; but nothing like as bad as being her niece.â

âThat I can well believe. Iâm glad to hear,â he added, âthat you put it
all in the past tense.â

She seemed to droop a little at the allusion; then she lifted her chin
with a jerk of defiance. âYes. All is at an end between us. Weâve just
parted in tears—but not in silence!â

âJust parted? Do you mean to say youâve been there all this time?â

âEver since you used to come there to see Lady Ulrica? Does it seem to you
so awfully long ago?â

The unexpectedness of the thrust—as well as its doubtful taste—chilled
his growing enjoyment of her chatter. He had really been getting to like
her—had recovered, under the candid approval of her eye, his usual
sense of being a personable young man, with all the privileges pertaining
to the state, instead of the anonymous rag of humanity he had felt himself
in the crowd on the pier. It annoyed him, at that particular moment, to be
reminded that naturalness is not always consonant with taste.

She seemed to guess his thought. âYou donât like my saying that you came
for Lady Ulrica?â she asked, leaning over the table to pour herself a
second cup of tea.

He liked her quickness, at any rate. âItâs better,â he laughed, âthan your
thinking I came for Mrs. Murrett!â

âOh, we never thought anybody came for Mrs. Murrett! It was always for
something else: the music, or the cook—when there was a good one—or
the other people; generally
one
of the other people.â

âI see.â

She was amusing, and that, in his present mood, was more to his purpose
than the exact shade of her taste. It was odd, too, to discover suddenly
that the blurred tapestry of Mrs. Murrettâs background had all the while
been alive and full of eyes. Now, with a pair of them looking into his, he
was conscious of a queer reversal of perspective.

âWho were the âweâ? Were you a cloud of witnesses?â

âThere were a good many of us.â She smiled. âLet me see—who was
there in your time? Mrs. Bolt—and Mademoiselle—and Professor
Didymus and the Polish Countess. Donât you remember the Polish Countess?
She crystal-gazed, and played accompaniments, and Mrs. Murrett chucked her
because Mrs. Didymus accused her of hypnotizing the Professor. But of
course you donât remember. We were all invisible to you; but we could see.
And we all used to wonder about you——â

Again Darrow felt a redness in the temples. âWhat about me?â

âWell—whether it was you or she who...â

He winced, but hid his disapproval. It made the time pass to listen to
her.

âAnd what, if one may ask, was your conclusion?â

âWell, Mrs. Bolt and Mademoiselle and the Countess naturally thought it
was
she
; but Professor Didymus and Jimmy Brance—especially Jimmy——â

âJust a moment: who on earth is Jimmy Brance?â

She exclaimed in wonder: âYou
were
absorbed—not to remember Jimmy
Brance! He must have been right about you, after all.â She let her amused
scrutiny dwell on him. âBut how could you? She was false from head to
foot!â

âFalse——?â In spite of time and satiety, the male instinct of
ownership rose up and repudiated the charge.

Miss Viner caught his look and laughed. âOh, I only meant externally! You
see, she often used to come to my room after tennis, or to touch up in the
evenings, when they were going on; and I assure you she took apart like a
puzzle. In fact I used to say to Jimmy—just to make him wild—: âIâll
bet you anything you like thereâs nothing wrong, because I know sheâd
never dare un—ââ She broke the word in two, and her quick blush made
her face like a shallow-petalled rose shading to the deeper pink of the
centre.

The situation was saved, for Darrow, by an abrupt rush of memories, and he
gave way to a mirth which she as frankly echoed. âOf course,â she gasped
through her laughter, âI only said it to tease Jimmy——â

Her amusement obscurely annoyed him. âOh, youâre all alike!â he exclaimed,
moved by an unaccountable sense of disappointment.

She caught him up in a flash—she didnât miss things! âYou say that
because you think Iâm spiteful and envious? Yes—I was envious of
Lady Ulrica.... Oh, not on account of you or Jimmy Brance! Simply because
she had almost all the things Iâve always wanted: clothes and fun and
motors, and admiration and yachting and Paris—why, Paris alone would
be enough!—And how do you suppose a girl can see that sort of thing
about her day after day, and never wonder why some women, who donât seem
to have any more right to it, have it all tumbled into their laps, while
others are writing dinner invitations, and straightening out accounts, and
copying visiting lists, and finishing golf-stockings, and matching
ribbons, and seeing that the dogs get their sulphur? One looks in oneâs
glass, after all!â

She launched the closing words at him on a cry that lifted them above the
petulance of vanity; but his sense of her words was lost in the surprise
of her face. Under the flying clouds of her excitement it was no longer a
shallow flower-cup but a darkening gleaming mirror that might give back
strange depths of feeling. The girl had stuff in her—he saw it; and
she seemed to catch the perception in his eyes.

âThatâs the kind of education I got at Mrs. Murrettâs—and I never
had any other,â she said with a shrug.

âGood Lord—were you there so long?â

âFive years. I stuck it out longer than any of the others.â She spoke as
though it were something to be proud of.

âWell, thank God youâre out of it now!â

Again a just perceptible shadow crossed her face. âYes—Iâm out of it
now fast enough.â

âAnd what—if I may ask—are you doing next?â

She brooded a moment behind drooped lids; then, with a touch of hauteur:
âIâm going to Paris: to study for the stage.â

âThe stage?â Darrow stared at her, dismayed. All his confused
contradictory impressions assumed a new aspect at this announcement; and
to hide his surprise he added lightly: âAh—then you will have Paris,
after all!â

âHardly Lady Ulricaâs Paris. Itâs not likely to be roses, roses all the
way.â

âItâs not, indeed.â Real compassion prompted him to continue: âHave you
any—any influence you can count on?â

She gave a somewhat flippant little laugh. âNone but my own. Iâve never
had any other to count on.â

He passed over the obvious reply. âBut have you any idea how the
profession is over-crowded? I know Iâm trite——â

âIâve a very clear idea. But I couldnât go on as I was.â

âOf course not. But since, as you say, youâd stuck it out longer than any
of the others, couldnât you at least have held on till you were sure of
some kind of an opening?â

She made no reply for a moment; then she turned a listless glance to the
rain-beaten window. âOughtnât we be starting?â she asked, with a lofty
assumption of indifference that might have been Lady Ulricaâs.

Darrow, surprised by the change, but accepting her rebuff as a phase of
what he guessed to be a confused and tormented mood, rose from his seat
and lifted her jacket from the chair-back on which she had hung it to dry.
As he held it toward her she looked up at him quickly.

âThe truth is, we quarrelled,â she broke out, âand I left last night
without my dinner—and without my salary.â

âAh—â he groaned, with a sharp perception of all the sordid dangers
that might attend such a break with Mrs. Murrett.

âAnd without a character!â she added, as she slipped her arms into the
jacket. âAnd without a trunk, as it appears—but didnât you say that,
before going, thereâd be time for another look at the station?â

There was time for another look at the station; but the look again
resulted in disappointment, since her trunk was nowhere to be found in the
huge heap disgorged by the newly-arrived London express. The fact caused
Miss Viner a momentâs perturbation; but she promptly adjusted herself to
the necessity of proceeding on her journey, and her decision confirmed
Darrowâs vague resolve to go to Paris instead of retracing his way to
London.

Miss Viner seemed cheered at the prospect of his company, and sustained by
his offer to telegraph to Charing Cross for the missing trunk; and he left
her to wait in the fly while he hastened back to the telegraph office. The
enquiry despatched, he was turning away from the desk when another thought
struck him and he went back and indited a message to his servant in
London: âIf any letters with French post-mark received since departure
forward immediately to Terminus Hotel Gare du Nord Paris.â

Then he rejoined Miss Viner, and they drove off through the rain to the
pier.

III

Almost as soon as the train left Calais her head had dropped back into the
corner, and she had fallen asleep.

Sitting opposite, in the compartment from which he had contrived to have
other travellers excluded, Darrow looked at her curiously. He had never
seen a face that changed so quickly. A moment since it had danced like a
field of daisies in a summer breeze; now, under the pallid oscillating
light of the lamp overhead, it wore the hard stamp of experience, as of a
soft thing chilled into shape before its curves had rounded: and it moved
him to see that care already stole upon her when she slept.

The story she had imparted to him in the wheezing shaking cabin, and at
the Calais buffet—where he had insisted on offering her the dinner
she had missed at Mrs. Murrettâs—had given a distincter outline to
her figure. From the moment of entering the New York boarding-school to
which a preoccupied guardian had hastily consigned her after the death of
her parents, she had found herself alone in a busy and indifferent world.
Her youthful history might, in fact, have been summed up in the statement
that everybody had been too busy to look after her. Her guardian, a drudge
in a big banking house, was absorbed by âthe officeâ; the guardianâs wife,
by her health and her religion; and an elder sister, Laura, married,
unmarried, remarried, and pursuing, through all these alternating phases,
some vaguely âartistic" ideal on which the guardian and his wife looked
askance, had (as Darrow conjectured) taken their disapproval as a pretext
for not troubling herself about poor Sophy, to whom—perhaps for this
reason—she had remained the incarnation of remote romantic
possibilities.

In the course of time a sudden âstrokeâ of the guardianâs had thrown his
personal affairs into a state of confusion from which—after his
widely lamented death—it became evident that it would not be
possible to extricate his wardâs inheritance. No one deplored this more
sincerely than his widow, who saw in it one more proof of her husbandâs
life having been sacrificed to the innumerable duties imposed on him, and
who could hardly—but for the counsels of religion—have brought
herself to pardon the young girl for her indirect share in hastening his
end. Sophy did not resent this point of view. She was really much sorrier
for her guardianâs death than for the loss of her insignificant fortune.
The latter had represented only the means of holding her in bondage, and
its disappearance was the occasion of her immediate plunge into the wide
bright sea of life surrounding the island—of her captivity. She had first
landed—thanks to the intervention of the ladies who had directed her
education—in a Fifth Avenue school-room where, for a few months, she
acted as a buffer between three autocratic infants and their bodyguard of
nurses and teachers. The too-pressing attentions of their fatherâs valet
had caused her to fly this sheltered spot, against the express advice of
her educational superiors, who implied that, in their own case, refinement
and self-respect had always sufficed to keep the most ungovernable
passions at bay. The experience of the guardianâs widow having been
precisely similar, and the deplorable precedent of Lauraâs career being
present to all their minds, none of these ladies felt any obligation to
intervene farther in Sophyâs affairs; and she was accordingly left to her
own resources.

A schoolmate from the Rocky Mountains, who was taking her father and
mother to Europe, had suggested Sophyâs accompanying them, and âgoing
roundâ with her while her progenitors, in the care of the courier, nursed
their ailments at a fashionable bath. Darrow gathered that the âgoing
roundâ with Mamie Hoke was a varied and diverting process; but this
relatively brilliant phase of Sophyâs career was cut short by the
elopement of the inconsiderate Mamie with a âmatinee idolâ who had
followed her from New York, and by the precipitate return of her parents
to negotiate for the repurchase of their child.

It was then—after an interval of repose with compassionate but
impecunious American friends in Paris—that Miss Viner had been drawn
into the turbid current of Mrs. Murrettâs career. The impecunious
compatriots had found Mrs. Murrett for her, and it was partly on their
account (because they were such dears, and so unconscious, poor confiding
things, of what they were letting her in for) that Sophy had stuck it out
so long in the dreadful house in Chelsea. The Farlows, she explained to
Darrow, were the best friends she had ever had (and the only ones who had
ever âbeen decentâ about Laura, whom they had seen once, and intensely
admired); but even after twenty years of Paris they were the most
incorrigibly inexperienced angels, and quite persuaded that Mrs. Murrett
was a woman of great intellectual eminence, and the house at Chelsea âthe
last of the salonsâ—Darrow knew what she meant? And she hadnât liked
to undeceive them, knowing that to do so would be virtually to throw
herself back on their hands, and feeling, moreover, after her previous
experiences, the urgent need of gaining, at any cost, a name for
stability; besides which—she threw it off with a slight laugh—no
other chance, in all these years, had happened to come to her.

She had brushed in this outline of her career with light rapid strokes,
and in a tone of fatalism oddly untinged by bitterness. Darrow perceived
that she classified people according to their greater or less âluckâ in
life, but she appeared to harbour no resentment against the undefined
power which dispensed the gift in such unequal measure. Things came oneâs
way or they didnât; and meanwhile one could only look on, and make the
most of small compensations, such as watching âthe showâ at Mrs.
Murrettâs, and talking over the Lady Ulricas and other footlight figures.
And at any moment, of course, a turn of the kaleidoscope might suddenly
toss a bright spangle into the grey pattern of oneâs days.

This light-hearted philosophy was not without charm to a young man
accustomed to more traditional views. George Darrow had had a fairly
varied experience of feminine types, but the women he had frequented had
either been pronouncedly âladiesâ or they had not. Grateful to both for
ministering to the more complex masculine nature, and disposed to assume
that they had been evolved, if not designed, to that end, he had
instinctively kept the two groups apart in his mind, avoiding that
intermediate society which attempts to conciliate both theories of life.
âBohemianismâ seemed to him a cheaper convention than the other two, and
he liked, above all, people who went as far as they could in their own
line—liked his âladiesâ and their rivals to be equally unashamed of
showing for exactly what they were. He had not indeed—the fact of
Lady Ulrica was there to remind him—been without his experience of a
third type; but that experience had left him with a contemptuous distaste
for the woman who uses the privileges of one class to shelter the customs
of another.

As to young girls, he had never thought much about them since his early
love for the girl who had become Mrs. Leath. That episode seemed, as he
looked back on it, to bear no more relation to reality than a pale
decorative design to the confused richness of a summer landscape. He no
longer understood the violent impulses and dreamy pauses of his own young
heart, or the inscrutable abandonments and reluctances of hers. He had
known a moment of anguish at losing her—the mad plunge of youthful
instincts against the barrier of fate; but the first wave of stronger
sensation had swept away all but the outline of their story, and the
memory of Anna Summers had made the image of the young girl sacred, but
the class uninteresting.

Such generalisations belonged, however, to an earlier stage of his
experience. The more he saw of life the more incalculable he found it; and
he had learned to yield to his impressions without feeling the youthful
need of relating them to others. It was the girl in the opposite seat who
had roused in him the dormant habit of comparison. She was distinguished
from the daughters of wealth by her avowed acquaintance with the real
business of living, a familiarity as different as possible from their
theoretical proficiency; yet it seemed to Darrow that her experience had
made her free without hardness and self-assured without assertiveness.

The rush into Amiens, and the flash of the station lights into their
compartment, broke Miss Vinerâs sleep, and without changing her position
she lifted her lids and looked at Darrow. There was neither surprise nor
bewilderment in the look. She seemed instantly conscious, not so much of
where she was, as of the fact that she was with him; and that fact seemed
enough to reassure her. She did not even turn her head to look out; her
eyes continued to rest on him with a vague smile which appeared to light
her face from within, while her lips kept their sleepy droop.

Shouts and the hurried tread of travellers came to them through the
confusing cross-lights of the platform. A head appeared at the window, and
Darrow threw himself forward to defend their solitude; but the intruder
was only a train hand going his round of inspection. He passed on, and the
lights and cries of the station dropped away, merged in a wider haze and a
hollower resonance, as the train gathered itself up with a long shake and
rolled out again into the darkness.

Miss Vinerâs head sank back against the cushion, pushing out a dusky wave
of hair above her forehead. The swaying of the train loosened a lock over
her ear, and she shook it back with a movement like a boyâs, while her
gaze still rested on her companion.

âYouâre not too tired?â

She shook her head with a smile.

âWe shall be in before midnight. Weâre very nearly on time.â He verified
the statement by holding up his watch to the lamp.

She nodded dreamily. âItâs all right. I telegraphed Mrs. Farlow that they
mustnât think of coming to the station; but theyâll have told the
concierge to look out for me.â

âYouâll let me drive you there?â

She nodded again, and her eyes closed. It was very pleasant to Darrow that
she made no effort to talk or to dissemble her sleepiness. He sat watching
her till the upper lashes met and mingled with the lower, and their blent
shadow lay on her cheek; then he stood up and drew the curtain over the
lamp, drowning the compartment in a bluish twilight.

As he sank back into his seat he thought how differently Anna Summers—or
even Anna Leath—would have behaved. She would not have talked too
much; she would not have been either restless or embarrassed; but her
adaptability, her appropriateness, would not have been nature but âtact.â
The oddness of the situation would have made sleep impossible, or, if
weariness had overcome her for a moment, she would have waked with a
start, wondering where she was, and how she had come there, and if her
hair were tidy; and nothing short of hairpins and a glass would have
restored her self-possession...

The reflection set him wondering whether the âshelteredâ girlâs
bringing-up might not unfit her for all subsequent contact with life. How
much nearer to it had Mrs. Leath been brought by marriage and motherhood,
and the passage of fourteen years? What were all her reticences and
evasions but the result of the deadening process of forming a âladyâ? The
freshness he had marvelled at was like the unnatural whiteness of flowers
forced in the dark.

As he looked back at their few days together he saw that their intercourse
had been marked, on her part, by the same hesitations and reserves which
had chilled their earlier intimacy. Once more they had had their hour
together and she had wasted it. As in her girlhood, her eyes had made
promises which her lips were afraid to keep. She was still afraid of life,
of its ruthlessness, its danger and mystery. She was still the petted
little girl who cannot be left alone in the dark.... His memory flew back to
their youthful story, and long-forgotten details took shape before him.
How frail and faint the picture was! They seemed, he and she, like the
ghostly lovers of the Grecian Urn, forever pursuing without ever clasping
each other. To this day he did not quite know what had parted them: the
break had been as fortuitous as the fluttering apart of two seed-vessels
on a wave of summer air...

The very slightness, vagueness, of the memory gave it an added poignancy.
He felt the mystic pang of the parent for a child which has just breathed
and died. Why had it happened thus, when the least shifting of influences
might have made it all so different? If she had been given to him then he
would have put warmth in her veins and light in her eyes: would have made
her a woman through and through. Musing thus, he had the sense of waste
that is the bitterest harvest of experience. A love like his might have
given her the divine gift of self-renewal; and now he saw her fated to
wane into old age repeating the same gestures, echoing the words she had
always heard, and perhaps never guessing that, just outside her glazed and
curtained consciousness, life rolled away, a vast blackness starred with
lights, like the night landscape beyond the windows of the train.

The engine lowered its speed for the passage through a sleeping station.
In the light of the platform lamp Darrow looked across at his companion.
Her head had dropped toward one shoulder, and her lips were just far
enough apart for the reflection of the upper one to deepen the colour of
the other. The jolting of the train had again shaken loose the lock above
her ear. It danced on her cheek like the flit of a brown wing over
flowers, and Darrow felt an intense desire to lean forward and put it back
behind her ear.

IV

As their motor-cab, on the way from the Gare du Nord, turned into the
central glitter of the Boulevard, Darrow had bent over to point out an
incandescent threshold.

âThere!â

Above the doorway, an arch of flame flashed out the name of a great
actress, whose closing performances in a play of unusual originality had
been the theme of long articles in the Paris papers which Darrow had
tossed into their compartment at Calais.

âThatâs what you must see before youâre twenty-four hours older!â

The girl followed his gesture eagerly. She was all awake and alive now, as
if the heady rumours of the streets, with their long effervescences of
light, had passed into her veins like wine.

âCerdine? Is that where she acts?â She put her head out of the window,
straining back for a glimpse of the sacred threshold. As they flew past it
she sank into her seat with a satisfied sigh.

âItâs delicious enough just to
know
sheâs there! Iâve never seen her, you
know. When I was here with Mamie Hoke we never went anywhere but to the
music halls, because she couldnât understand any French; and when I came
back afterward to the Farlowsâ I was dead broke, and couldnât afford the
play, and neither could they; so the only chance we had was when friends
of theirs invited us—and once it was to see a tragedy by a Roumanian
lady, and the other time it was for âLâAmi Fritzâ at the FranÃ§ais.â

Darrow laughed. âYou must do better than that now. âLe Vertigeâ is a fine
thing, and Cerdine gets some wonderful effects out of it. You must come
with me tomorrow evening to see it—with your friends, of course.—That
is,â he added, âif thereâs any sort of chance of getting seats.â

The flash of a street lamp lit up her radiant face. âOh, will you really
take us? What fun to think that itâs tomorrow already!â

It was wonderfully pleasant to be able to give such pleasure. Darrow was
not rich, but it was almost impossible for him to picture the state of
persons with tastes and perceptions like his own, to whom an evening at
the theatre was an unattainable indulgence. There floated through his mind
an answer of Mrs. Leathâs to his enquiry whether she had seen the play in
question. âNo. I meant to, of course, but one is so overwhelmed with
things in Paris. And then Iâm rather sick of Cerdine—one is always
being dragged to see her.â

That, among the people he frequented, was the usual attitude toward such
opportunities. There were too many, they were a nuisance, one had to
defend oneâs self! He even remembered wondering, at the moment, whether to
a really fine taste the exceptional thing could ever become indifferent
through habit; whether the appetite for beauty was so soon dulled that it
could be kept alive only by privation. Here, at any rate, was a fine
chance to experiment with such a hunger: he almost wished he might stay on
in Paris long enough to take the measure of Miss Vinerâs receptivity.

She was still dwelling on his promise, âItâs too beautiful of you! Oh,
donât you
think
youâll be able to get seats?â And then, after a pause of
brimming appreciation: âI wonder if youâll think me horrid?—but it
may be my only chance; and if you canât get places for us all, wouldnât
you perhaps just take
me
? After all, the Farlows may have seen it!â

He had not, of course, thought her horrid, but only the more engaging, for
being so natural, and so unashamed of showing the frank greed of her
famished youth. âOh, you shall go somehow!â he had gaily promised her; and
she had dropped back with a sigh of pleasure as their cab passed into the
dimly-lit streets of the Farlowsâ quarter beyond the Seine...

This little passage came back to him the next morning, as he opened his
hotel window on the early roar of the Northern Terminus.

The girl was there, in the room next to him. That had been the first point
in his waking consciousness. The second was a sense of relief at the
obligation imposed on him by this unexpected turn of everts. To wake to
the necessity of action, to postpone perforce the fruitless contemplation
of his private grievance, was cause enough for gratitude, even if the
small adventure in which he found himself involved had not, on its own
merits, roused an instinctive curiosity to see it through.

When he and his companion, the night before, had reached the Farlowsâ door
in the rue de la Chaise, it was only to find, after repeated assaults on
its panels, that the Farlows were no longer there. They had moved away the
week before, not only from their apartment but from Paris; and Miss
Vinerâs breach with Mrs. Murrett had been too sudden to permit her letter
and telegram to overtake them. Both communications, no doubt, still
reposed in a pigeon-hole of the loge; but its custodian, when drawn from
his lair, sulkily declined to let Miss Viner verify the fact, and only
flung out, in return for Darrowâs bribe, the statement that the Americans
had gone to Joigny.

To pursue them there at that hour was manifestly impossible, and Miss
Viner, disturbed but not disconcerted by this new obstacle, had quite
simply acceded to Darrowâs suggestion that she should return for what
remained of the night to the hotel where he had sent his luggage.

The drive back through the dark hush before dawn, with the nocturnal blaze
of the Boulevard fading around them like the false lights of a magicianâs
palace, had so played on her impressionability that she seemed to give no
farther thought to her own predicament. Darrow noticed that she did not
feel the beauty and mystery of the spectacle as much as its pressure of
human significance, all its hidden implications of emotion and adventure.
As they passed the shadowy colonnade of the FranÃ§ais, remote and
temple-like in the paling lights, he felt a clutch on his arm, and heard
the cry: âThere are things
there
that I want so desperately to see!â and
all the way back to the hotel she continued to question him, with shrewd
precision and an artless thirst for detail, about the theatrical life of
Paris. He was struck afresh, as he listened, by the way in which her
naturalness eased the situation of constraint, leaving to it only a
pleasant savour of good fellowship. It was the kind of episode that one
might, in advance, have characterized as âawkwardâ, yet that was proving,
in the event, as much outside such definitions as a sunrise stroll with a
dryad in a dew-drenched forest; and Darrow reflected that mankind would
never have needed to invent tact if it had not first invented social
complications.

It had been understood, with his good-night to Miss Viner, that the next
morning he was to look up the Joigny trains, and see her safely to the
station; but, while he breakfasted and waited for a time-table, he
recalled again her cry of joy at the prospect of seeing Cerdine. It was
certainly a pity, since that most elusive and incalculable of artists was
leaving the next week for South America, to miss what might be a last
sight of her in her greatest part; and Darrow, having dressed and made the
requisite excerpts from the time-table, decided to carry the result of his
deliberations to his neighbourâs door.

It instantly opened at his knock, and she came forth looking as if she had
been plunged into some sparkling element which had curled up all her
drooping tendrils and wrapped her in a shimmer of fresh leaves.

âWell, what do you think of me?â she cried; and with a hand at her waist
she spun about as if to show off some miracle of Parisian dress-making.

âI think the missing trunk has come—and that it was worth waiting
for!â

âYou
do
like my dress?â

âI adore it! I always adore new dresses—why, you donât mean to say
itâs
not
a new one?â

She laughed out her triumph.

âNo, no, no! My trunk hasnât come, and this is only my old rag of
yesterday—but I never knew the trick to fail!â And, as he stared:
âYou see,â she joyously explained, âIâve always had to dress in all kinds
of dreary left-overs, and sometimes, when everybody else was smart and
new, it used to make me awfully miserable. So one day, when Mrs. Murrett
dragged me down unexpectedly to fill a place at dinner, I suddenly thought
Iâd try spinning around like that, and say to every one: â
Well, what do
you think of me
?â And, do you know, they were all taken in, including Mrs.
Murrett, who didnât recognize my old turned and dyed rags, and told me
afterward it was awfully bad form to dress as if I were somebody that
people would expect to know! And ever since, whenever Iâve particularly
wanted to look nice, Iâve just asked people what they thought of my new
frock; and theyâre always, always taken in!â

She dramatized her explanation so vividly that Darrow felt as if his point
were gained.

âAh, but this confirms your vocation—of course,â he cried, âyou must
see Cerdine!â and, seeing her face fall at this reminder of the change in
her prospects, he hastened to set forth his plan. As he did so, he saw how
easy it was to explain things to her. She would either accept his
suggestion, or she would not: but at least she would waste no time in
protestations and objections, or any vain sacrifice to the idols of
conformity. The conviction that one could, on any given point, almost
predicate this of her, gave him the sense of having advanced far enough in
her intimacy to urge his arguments against a hasty pursuit of her friends.

Yes, it would certainly be foolish—she at once agreed—in the
case of such dear indefinite angels as the Farlows, to dash off after them
without more positive proof that they were established at Joigny, and so
established that they could take her in. She owned it was but too probable
that they had gone there to âcut downâ, and might be doing so in quarters
too contracted to receive her; and it would be unfair, on that chance, to
impose herself on them unannounced. The simplest way of getting farther
light on the question would be to go back to the rue de la Chaise, where,
at that more conversable hour, the concierge might be less chary of
detail; and she could decide on her next step in the light of such facts
as he imparted.

Point by point, she fell in with the suggestion, recognizing, in the light
of their unexplained flight, that the Farlows might indeed be in a
situation on which one could not too rashly intrude. Her concern for her
friends seemed to have effaced all thought of herself, and this little
indication of character gave Darrow a quite disproportionate pleasure. She
agreed that it would be well to go at once to the rue de la Chaise, but
met his proposal that they should drive by the declaration that it was a
âwasteâ not to walk in Paris; so they set off on foot through the cheerful
tumult of the streets.

The walk was long enough for him to learn many things about her. The storm
of the previous night had cleared the air, and Paris shone in morning
beauty under a sky that was all broad wet washes of white and blue; but
Darrow again noticed that her visual sensitiveness was less keen than her
feeling for what he was sure the good Farlows—whom he already seemed
to know—would have called âthe human interest.â She seemed hardly
conscious of sensations of form and colour, or of any imaginative
suggestion, and the spectacle before them—always, in its scenic
splendour, so moving to her companion—broke up, under her scrutiny,
into a thousand minor points: the things in the shops, the types of
character and manner of occupation shown in the passing faces, the street
signs, the names of the hotels they passed, the motley brightness of the
flower-carts, the identity of the churches and public buildings that
caught her eye. But what she liked best, he divined, was the mere fact of
being free to walk abroad in the bright air, her tongue rattling on as it
pleased, while her feet kept time to the mighty orchestration of the
cityâs sounds. Her delight in the fresh air, in the freedom, light and
sparkle of the morning, gave him a sudden insight into her stifled past;
nor was it indifferent to him to perceive how much his presence evidently
added to her enjoyment. If only as a sympathetic ear, he guessed what he
must be worth to her. The girl had been dying for some one to talk to,
some one before whom she could unfold and shake out to the light her poor
little shut-away emotions. Years of repression were revealed in her sudden
burst of confidence; and the pity she inspired made Darrow long to fill
her few free hours to the brim.

She had the gift of rapid definition, and his questions as to the life she
had led with the Farlows, during the interregnum between the Hoke and
Murrett eras, called up before him a queer little corner of Parisian
existence. The Farlows themselves—he a painter, she a âmagazine
writerâ—rose before him in all their incorruptible simplicity: an
elderly New England couple, with vague yearnings for enfranchisement, who
lived in Paris as if it were a Massachusetts suburb, and dwelt hopefully
on the âhigher sideâ of the Gallic nature. With equal vividness she set
before him the component figures of the circle from which Mrs. Farlow drew
the âInner Glimpses of French Lifeâ appearing over her name in a leading
New England journal: the Roumanian lady who had sent them tickets for her
tragedy, an elderly French gentleman who, on the strength of a weekâs stay
at Folkestone, translated English fiction for the provincial press, a lady
from Wichita, Kansas, who advocated free love and the abolition of the
corset, a clergymanâs widow from Torquay who had written an âEnglish
Ladiesâ Guide to Foreign Galleriesâ and a Russian sculptor who lived on
nuts and was âalmost certainlyâ an anarchist. It was this nucleus, and its
outer ring of musical, architectural and other American students, which
posed successively to Mrs. Farlowâs versatile fancy as a centre of
âUniversity Lifeâ, a âSalon of the Faubourg St. Germainâ, a group of
Parisian âIntellectualsâ or a âCross-section of Montmartreâ; but even her
faculty for extracting from it the most varied literary effects had not
sufficed to create a permanent demand for the âInner Glimpsesâ, and there
were days when—Mr. Farlowâs landscapes being equally unmarketable—a
temporary withdrawal to the country (subsequently utilized as âPeeps into
Chateau Lifeâ) became necessary to the courageous couple.

Five years of Mrs. Murrettâs world, while increasing Sophyâs tenderness
for the Farlows, had left her with few illusions as to their power of
advancing her fortunes; and she did not conceal from Darrow that her
theatrical projects were of the vaguest. They hung mainly on the
problematical good-will of an ancient comedienne, with whom Mrs. Farlow
had a slight acquaintance (extensively utilized in âStars of the French
Footlightsâ and âBehind the Scenes at the FranÃ§aisâ), and who had once,
with signs of approval, heard Miss Viner recite the Nuit de Mai.

âBut of course I know how much thatâs worth,â the girl broke off, with one
of her flashes of shrewdness. âAnd besides, it isnât likely that a poor
old fossil like Mme. Dolle could get anybody to listen to her now, even if
she really thought I had talent. But she might introduce me to people; or
at least give me a few tips. If I could manage to earn enough to pay for
lessons Iâd go straight to some of the big people and work with them. Iâm
rather hoping the Farlows may find me a chance of that kind—an
engagement with some American family in Paris who would want to be âgone
roundâ with like the Hokes, and whoâd leave me time enough to study.â

In the rue de la Chaise they learned little except the exact address of
the Farlows, and the fact that they had sub-let their flat before leaving.
This information obtained, Darrow proposed to Miss Viner that they should
stroll along the quays to a little restaurant looking out on the Seine,
and there, over the plat du jour, consider the next step to be taken. The
long walk had given her cheeks a glow indicative of wholesome hunger, and
she made no difficulty about satisfying it in Darrowâs company. Regaining
the river they walked on in the direction of Notre Dame, delayed now and
again by the young manâs irresistible tendency to linger over the
bookstalls, and by his ever-fresh response to the shifting beauties of the
scene. For two years his eyes had been subdued to the atmospheric effects
of London, to the mysterious fusion of darkly-piled city and low-lying
bituminous sky; and the transparency of the French air, which left the
green gardens and silvery stones so classically clear yet so softly
harmonized, struck him as having a kind of conscious intelligence. Every
line of the architecture, every arch of the bridges, the very sweep of the
strong bright river between them, while contributing to this effect, sent
forth each a separate appeal to some sensitive memory; so that, for
Darrow, a walk through the Paris streets was always like the unrolling of
a vast tapestry from which countless stored fragrances were shaken out.

It was a proof of the richness and multiplicity of the spectacle that it
served, without incongruity, for so different a purpose as the background
of Miss Vinerâs enjoyment. As a mere drop-scene for her personal adventure
it was just as much in its place as in the evocation of great perspectives
of feeling. For her, as he again perceived when they were seated at their
table in a low window above the Seine, Paris was âParisâ by virtue of all
its entertaining details, its endless ingenuities of pleasantness. Where
else, for instance, could one find the dear little dishes of hors
dâoeuvre, the symmetrically-laid anchovies and radishes, the thin golden
shells of butter, or the wood strawberries and brown jars of cream that
gave to their repast the last refinement of rusticity? Hadnât he noticed,
she asked, that cooking always expressed the national character, and that
French food was clever and amusing just because the people were? And in
private houses, everywhere, how the dishes always resembled the talk—how
the very same platitudes seemed to go into peopleâs mouths and come out of
them? Couldnât he see just what kind of menu it would make, if a fairy
waved a wand and suddenly turned the conversation at a London dinner into
joints and puddings? She always thought it a good sign when people liked
Irish stew; it meant that they enjoyed changes and surprises, and taking
life as it came; and such a beautiful Parisian version of the dish as the
navarin that was just being set before them was like the very best kind of
talk—the kind when one could never tell before-hand just what was
going to be said!

Darrow, as he watched her enjoyment of their innocent feast, wondered if
her vividness and vivacity were signs of her calling. She was the kind of
girl in whom certain people would instantly have recognized the histrionic
gift. But experience had led him to think that, except at the creative
moment, the divine flame burns low in its possessors. The one or two
really intelligent actresses he had known had struck him, in conversation,
as either bovine or primitively âjollyâ. He had a notion that, save in the
mind of genius, the creative process absorbs too much of the whole stuff
of being to leave much surplus for personal expression; and the girl
before him, with her changing face and flexible fancies, seemed destined
to work in life itself rather than in any of its counterfeits.

The coffee and liqueurs were already on the table when her mind suddenly
sprang back to the Farlows. She jumped up with one of her subversive
movements and declared that she must telegraph at once. Darrow called for
writing materials and room was made at her elbow for the parched
ink-bottle and saturated blotter of the Parisian restaurant; but the mere
sight of these jaded implements seemed to paralyze Miss Vinerâs faculties.
She hung over the telegraph-form with anxiously-drawn brow, the tip of the
pen-handle pressed against her lip; and at length she raised her troubled
eyes to Darrowâs.

âI simply canât think how to say it.â

âWhat—that youâre staying over to see Cerdine?â

âBut
am
I—am I, really?â The joy of it flamed over her face.

Darrow looked at his watch. âYou could hardly get an answer to your
telegram in time to take a train to Joigny this afternoon, even if you
found your friends could have you.â

She mused for a moment, tapping her lip with the pen. âBut I must let them
know Iâm here. I must find out as soon as possible if they
can
, have me.â
She laid the pen down despairingly. âI never
could
write a telegram!â she
sighed.

âTry a letter, then and tell them youâll arrive tomorrow.â

This suggestion produced immediate relief, and she gave an energetic dab
at the ink-bottle; but after another interval of uncertain scratching she
paused again. âOh, itâs fearful! I donât know what on earth to say. I
wouldnât for the world have them know how beastly Mrs. Murrettâs been.â

Darrow did not think it necessary to answer. It was no business of his,
after all. He lit a cigar and leaned back in his seat, letting his eyes
take their fill of indolent pleasure. In the throes of invention she had
pushed back her hat, loosening the stray lock which had invited his touch
the night before. After looking at it for a while he stood up and wandered
to the window.

Behind him he heard her pen scrape on.

âI donât want to worry them—Iâm so certain theyâve got bothers of
their own.â The faltering scratches ceased again. âI wish I werenât such
an idiot about writing: all the words get frightened and scurry away when
I try to catch them.â He glanced back at her with a smile as she bent
above her task like a school-girl struggling with a âcomposition.â Her
flushed cheek and frowning brow showed that her difficulty was genuine and
not an artless device to draw him to her side. She was really powerless to
put her thoughts in writing, and the inability seemed characteristic of
her quick impressionable mind, and of the incessant come-and-go of her
sensations. He thought of Anna Leathâs letters, or rather of the few he
had received, years ago, from the girl who had been Anna Summers. He saw
the slender firm strokes of the pen, recalled the clear structure of the
phrases, and, by an abrupt association of ideas, remembered that, at that
very hour, just such a document might be awaiting him at the hotel.

What if it were there, indeed, and had brought him a complete explanation
of her telegram? The revulsion of feeling produced by this thought made
him look at the girl with sudden impatience. She struck him as positively
stupid, and he wondered how he could have wasted half his day with her,
when all the while Mrs. Leathâs letter might be lying on his table. At
that moment, if he could have chosen, he would have left his companion on
the spot; but he had her on his hands, and must accept the consequences.

Some odd intuition seemed to make her conscious of his change of mood, for
she sprang from her seat, crumpling the letter in her hand.

âIâm too stupid; but I wonât keep you any longer. Iâll go back to the
hotel and write there.â

Her colour deepened, and for the first time, as their eyes met, he noticed
a faint embarrassment in hers. Could it be that his nearness was, after
all, the cause of her confusion? The thought turned his vague impatience
with her into a definite resentment toward himself. There was really no
excuse for his having blundered into such an adventure. Why had he not
shipped the girl off to Joigny by the evening train, instead of urging her
to delay, and using Cerdine as a pretext? Paris was full of people he
knew, and his annoyance was increased by the thought that some friend of
Mrs. Leathâs might see him at the play, and report his presence there with
a suspiciously good-looking companion. The idea was distinctly
disagreeable: he did not want the woman he adored to think he could forget
her for a moment. And by this time he had fully persuaded himself that a
letter from her was awaiting him, and had even gone so far as to imagine
that its contents might annul the writerâs telegraphed injunction, and
call him to her side at once...

V

At the porterâs desk a brief âPas de lettresâ fell destructively on the
fabric of these hopes. Mrs. Leath had not written—she had not taken
the trouble to explain her telegram. Darrow turned away with a sharp pang
of humiliation. Her frugal silence mocked his prodigality of hopes and
fears. He had put his question to the porter once before, on returning to
the hotel after luncheon; and now, coming back again in the late
afternoon, he was met by the same denial. The second post was in, and had
brought him nothing.

A glance at his watch showed that he had barely time to dress before
taking Miss Viner out to dine; but as he turned to the lift a new thought
struck him, and hurrying back into the hall he dashed off another telegram
to his servant: âHave you forwarded any letter with French postmark today?
Telegraph answer Terminus.â

Some kind of reply would be certain to reach him on his return from the
theatre, and he would then know definitely whether Mrs. Leath meant to
write or not. He hastened up to his room and dressed with a lighter heart.

Miss Vinerâs vagrant trunk had finally found its way to its owner; and,
clad in such modest splendour as it furnished, she shone at Darrow across
their restaurant table. In the reaction of his wounded vanity he found her
prettier and more interesting than before. Her dress, sloping away from
the throat, showed the graceful set of her head on its slender neck, and
the wide brim of her hat arched above her hair like a dusky halo. Pleasure
danced in her eyes and on her lips, and as she shone on him between the
candle-shades Darrow felt that he should not be at all sorry to be seen
with her in public. He even sent a careless glance about him in the vague
hope that it might fall on an acquaintance.

At the theatre her vivacity sank into a breathless hush, and she sat
intent in her corner of their
baignoire
, with the gaze of a neophyte about
to be initiated into the sacred mysteries. Darrow placed himself behind
her, that he might catch her profile between himself and the stage. He was
touched by the youthful seriousness of her expression. In spite of the
experiences she must have had, and of the twenty-four years to which she
owned, she struck him as intrinsically young; and he wondered how so
evanescent a quality could have been preserved in the desiccating Murrett
air. As the play progressed he noticed that her immobility was traversed
by swift flashes of perception. She was not missing anything, and her
intensity of attention when Cerdine was on the stage drew an anxious line
between her brows.

After the first act she remained for a few minutes rapt and motionless;
then she turned to her companion with a quick patter of questions. He
gathered from them that she had been less interested in following the
general drift of the play than in observing the details of its
interpretation. Every gesture and inflection of the great actressâs had
been marked and analyzed; and Darrow felt a secret gratification in being
appealed to as an authority on the histrionic art. His interest in it had
hitherto been merely that of the cultivated young man curious of all forms
of artistic expression; but in reply to her questions he found things to
say about it which evidently struck his listener as impressive and
original, and with which he himself was not, on the whole, dissatisfied.
Miss Viner was much more concerned to hear his views than to express her
own, and the deference with which she received his comments called from
him more ideas about the theatre than he had ever supposed himself to
possess.

With the second act she began to give more attention to the development of
the play, though her interest was excited rather by what she called âthe
storyâ than by the conflict of character producing it. Oddly combined with
her sharp apprehension of things theatrical, her knowledge of technical
âdodgesâ and green-room precedents, her glibness about âlinesâ and
âcurtainsâ, was the primitive simplicity of her attitude toward the tale
itself, as toward something that was âreally happeningâ and at which one
assisted as at a street-accident or a quarrel overheard in the next room.
She wanted to know if Darrow thought the lovers âreally wouldâ be involved
in the catastrophe that threatened them, and when he reminded her that his
predictions were disqualified by his having already seen the play, she
exclaimed: âOh, then, please donât tell me whatâs going to happen!â and
the next moment was questioning him about Cerdineâs theatrical situation
and her private history. On the latter point some of her enquiries were of
a kind that it is not in the habit of young girls to make, or even to know
how to make; but her apparent unconsciousness of the fact seemed rather to
reflect on her past associates than on herself.

When the second act was over, Darrow suggested their taking a turn in the
foyer; and seated on one of its cramped red velvet sofas they watched the
crowd surge up and down in a glare of lights and gilding. Then, as she
complained of the heat, he led her through the press to the congested
cafÃ©

at the foot of the stairs, where orangeades were thrust at them between
the shoulders of packed
consommateurs
and Darrow, lighting a cigarette
while she sucked her straw, knew the primitive complacency of the man at
whose companion other men stare.

On a corner of their table lay a smeared copy of a theatrical journal. It
caught Sophyâs eye and after poring over the page she looked up with an
excited exclamation.

âTheyâre giving
Oedipe
tomorrow afternoon at the FranÃ§ais! I suppose
youâve seen it heaps and heaps of times?â

He smiled back at her. âYou must see it too. Weâll go tomorrow.â

She sighed at his suggestion, but without discarding it. âHow can I? The
last train for Joigny leaves at four.â

âBut you donât know yet that your friends will want you.â

âI shall know tomorrow early. I asked Mrs. Farlow to telegraph as soon as
she got my letter.â A twinge of compunction shot through Darrow. Her words
recalled to him that on their return to the hotel after luncheon she had
given him her letter to post, and that he had never thought of it again.
No doubt it was still in the pocket of the coat he had taken off when he
dressed for dinner. In his perturbation he pushed back his chair, and the
movement made her look up at him.

âWhatâs the matter?â

âNothing. Only—you know I donât fancy that letter can have caught
this afternoonâs post.â

âNot caught it? Why not?â

âWhy, Iâm afraid it will have been too late.â He bent his head to light
another cigarette.

She struck her hands together with a gesture which, to his amusement, he
noticed she had caught from Cerdine.

âOh, dear, I hadnât thought of that! But surely it will reach them in the
morning?â

âSome time in the morning, I suppose. You know the French provincial post
is never in a hurry. I donât believe your letter would have been delivered
this evening in any case.â As this idea occurred to him he felt himself
almost absolved.

âPerhaps, then, I ought to have telegraphed?â

âIâll telegraph for you in the morning if you say so.â

The bell announcing the close of the entrâ-acte shrilled through the
cafÃ©
,
and she sprang to her feet.

âOh, come, come! We mustnât miss it!â

Instantly forgetful of the Farlows, she slipped her arm through his and
turned to push her way back to the theatre.

As soon as the curtain went up she as promptly forgot her companion.
Watching her from the corner to which he had returned, Darrow saw that
great waves of sensation were beating deliciously against her brain. It
was as though every starved sensibility were throwing out feelers to the
mounting tide; as though everything she was seeing, hearing, imagining,
rushed in to fill the void of all she had always been denied.

Darrow, as he observed her, again felt a detached enjoyment in her
pleasure. She was an extraordinary conductor of sensation: she seemed to
transmit it physically, in emanations that set the blood dancing in his
veins. He had not often had the opportunity of studying the effects of a
perfectly fresh impression on so responsive a temperament, and he felt a
fleeting desire to make its chords vibrate for his own amusement.

At the end of the next act she discovered with dismay that in their
transit to the
cafÃ©
she had lost the beautiful pictured programme he had
bought for her. She wanted to go back and hunt for it, but Darrow assured
her that he would have no trouble in getting her another. When he went out
in quest of it she followed him protestingly to the door of the box, and
he saw that she was distressed at the thought of his having to spend an
additional franc for her. This frugality smote Darrow by its contrast to
her natural bright profusion; and again he felt the desire to right so
clumsy an injustice.

When he returned to the box she was still standing in the doorway, and he
noticed that his were not the only eyes attracted to her. Then another
impression sharply diverted his attention. Above the fagged faces of the
Parisian crowd he had caught the fresh fair countenance of Owen Leath
signalling a joyful recognition. The young man, slim and eager, had
detached himself from two companions of his own type, and was seeking to
push through the press to his step-motherâs friend. The encounter, to
Darrow, could hardly have been more inopportune; it woke in him a
confusion of feelings of which only the uppermost was allayed by seeing
Sophy Viner, as if instinctively warned, melt back into the shadow of
their box.

A minute later Owen Leath was at his side. âI was sure it was you! Such
luck to run across you! Wonât you come off with us to supper after itâs
over? Montmartre, or wherever else you please. Those two chaps over there
are friends of mine, at the Beaux Arts; both of them rather good fellows—and
weâd be so glad——â

For half a second Darrow read in his hospitable eye the termination âif
youâd bring the lady tooâ; then it deflected into: âWeâd all be so glad if
youâd come.â

Darrow, excusing himself with thanks, lingered on for a few minutesâ chat,
in which every word, and every tone of his companionâs voice, was like a
sharp light flashed into aching eyes. He was glad when the bell called the
audience to their seats, and young Leath left him with the friendly
question: âWeâll see you at Givre later on?â

When he rejoined Miss Viner, Darrowâs first care was to find out, by a
rapid inspection of the house, whether Owen Leathâs seat had given him a
view of their box. But the young man was not visible from it, and Darrow
concluded that he had been recognized in the corridor and not at his
companionâs side. He scarcely knew why it seemed to him so important that
this point should be settled; certainly his sense of reassurance was less
due to regard for Miss Viner than to the persistent vision of grave
offended eyes...

During the drive back to the hotel this vision was persistently kept
before him by the thought that the evening post might have brought a
letter from Mrs. Leath. Even if no letter had yet come, his servant might
have telegraphed to say that one was on its way; and at the thought his
interest in the girl at his side again cooled to the fraternal, the almost
fatherly. She was no more to him, after all, than an appealing young
creature to whom it was mildly agreeable to have offered an eveningâs
diversion; and when, as they rolled into the illuminated court of the
hotel, she turned with a quick movement which brought her happy face close
to his, he leaned away, affecting to be absorbed in opening the door of
the cab.

At the desk the night porter, after a vain search through the
pigeon-holes, was disposed to think that a letter or telegram had in fact
been sent up for the gentleman; and Darrow, at the announcement, could
hardly wait to ascend to his room. Upstairs, he and his companion had the
long dimly-lit corridor to themselves, and Sophy paused on her threshold,
gathering up in one hand the pale folds of her cloak, while she held the
other out to Darrow.

âIf the telegram comes early I shall be off by the first train; so I
suppose this is good-bye,â she said, her eyes dimmed by a little shadow of
regret.

Darrow, with a renewed start of contrition, perceived that he had again
forgotten her letter; and as their hands met he vowed to himself that the
moment she had left him he would dash down stairs to post it.

âOh, Iâll see you in the morning, of course!â

A tremor of pleasure crossed her face as he stood before her, smiling a
little uncertainly.

âAt any rate,â she said, âI want to thank you now for my good day.â

He felt in her hand the same tremor he had seen in her face. âBut itâs

you
, on the contrary—â he began, lifting the hand to his lips.

As he dropped it, and their eyes met, something passed through hers that
was like a light carried rapidly behind a curtained window.

âGood night; you must be awfully tired,â he said with a friendly
abruptness, turning away without even waiting to see her pass into her
room. He unlocked his door, and stumbling over the threshold groped in the
darkness for the electric button. The light showed him a telegram on the
table, and he forgot everything else as he caught it up.

âNo letter from France,â the message read.

It fell from Darrowâs hand to the floor, and he dropped into a chair by
the table and sat gazing at the dingy drab and olive pattern of the
carpet. She had not written, then; she had not written, and it was
manifest now that she did not mean to write. If she had had any intention
of explaining her telegram she would certainly, within twenty-four hours,
have followed it up by a letter. But she evidently did not intend to
explain it, and her silence could mean only that she had no explanation to
give, or else that she was too indifferent to be aware that one was
needed.

Darrow, face to face with these alternatives, felt a recrudescence of
boyish misery. It was no longer his hurt vanity that cried out. He told
himself that he could have borne an equal amount of pain, if only it had
left Mrs. Leathâs image untouched; but he could not bear to think of her
as trivial or insincere. The thought was so intolerable that he felt a
blind desire to punish some one else for the pain it caused him.

As he sat moodily staring at the carpet its silly intricacies melted into
a blur from which the eyes of Mrs. Leath again looked out at him. He saw
the fine sweep of her brows, and the deep look beneath them as she had
turned from him on their last evening in London. âThis will be good-bye,
then,â she had said; and it occurred to him that her parting phrase had
been the same as Sophy Vinerâs.

At the thought he jumped to his feet and took down from its hook the coat
in which he had left Miss Vinerâs letter. The clock marked the third
quarter after midnight, and he knew it would make no difference if he went
down to the post-box now or early the next morning; but he wanted to clear
his conscience, and having found the letter he went to the door.

A sound in the next room made him pause. He had become conscious again
that, a few feet off, on the other side of a thin partition, a small keen
flame of life was quivering and agitating the air. Sophyâs face came back
to him insistently. It was as vivid now as Mrs. Leathâs had been a moment
earlier. He recalled with a faint smile of retrospective pleasure the
girlâs enjoyment of her evening, and the innumerable fine feelers of
sensation she had thrown out to its impressions.

It gave him a curiously close sense of her presence to think that at that
moment she was living over her enjoyment as intensely as he was living
over his unhappiness. His own case was irremediable, but it was easy
enough to give her a few more hours of pleasure. And did she not perhaps
secretly expect it of him? After all, if she had been very anxious to join
her friends she would have telegraphed them on reaching Paris, instead of
writing. He wondered now that he had not been struck at the moment by so
artless a device to gain more time. The fact of her having practised it
did not make him think less well of her; it merely strengthened the
impulse to use his opportunity. She was starving, poor child, for a little
amusement, a little personal life—why not give her the chance of
another day in Paris? If he did so, should he not be merely falling in
with her own hopes?

At the thought his sympathy for her revived. She became of absorbing
interest to him as an escape from himself and an object about which his
thwarted activities could cluster. He felt less drearily alone because of
her being there, on the other side of the door, and in his gratitude to
her for giving him this relief he began, with indolent amusement, to plan
new ways of detaining her. He dropped back into his chair, lit a cigar,
and smiled a little at the image of her smiling face. He tried to imagine
what incident of the day she was likely to be recalling at that particular
moment, and what part he probably played in it. That it was not a small
part he was certain, and the knowledge was undeniably pleasant.

Now and then a sound from her room brought before him more vividly the
reality of the situation and the strangeness of the vast swarming solitude
in which he and she were momentarily isolated, amid long lines of rooms
each holding its separate secret. The nearness of all these other
mysteries enclosing theirs gave Darrow a more intimate sense of the girlâs
presence, and through the fumes of his cigar his imagination continued to
follow her to and fro, traced the curve of her slim young arms as she
raised them to undo her hair, pictured the sliding down of her dress to
the waist and then to the knees, and the whiteness of her feet as she
slipped across the floor to bed...

He stood up and shook himself with a yawn, throwing away the end of his
cigar. His glance, in following it, lit on the telegram which had dropped
to the floor. The sounds in the next room had ceased, and once more he
felt alone and unhappy.

Opening the window, he folded his arms on the sill and looked out on the
vast light-spangled mass of the city, and then up at the dark sky, in
which the morning planet stood.

VI

At the Theatre FranÃ§ais, the next afternoon, Darrow yawned and fidgeted in
his seat.

The day was warm, the theatre crowded and airless, and the performance, it
seemed to him, intolerably bad. He stole a glance at his companion,
wondering if she shared his feelings. Her rapt profile betrayed no unrest,
but politeness might have caused her to feign an interest that she did not
feel. He leaned back impatiently, stifling another yawn, and trying to fix
his attention on the stage. Great things were going forward there, and he
was not insensible to the stern beauties of the ancient drama. But the
interpretation of the play seemed to him as airless and lifeless as the
atmosphere of the theatre. The players were the same whom he had often
applauded in those very parts, and perhaps that fact added to the
impression of staleness and conventionality produced by their performance.
Surely it was time to infuse new blood into the veins of the moribund art.
He had the impression that the ghosts of actors were giving a spectral
performance on the shores of Styx.

Certainly it was not the most profitable way for a young man with a pretty
companion to pass the golden hours of a spring afternoon. The freshness of
the face at his side, reflecting the freshness of the season, suggested
dapplings of sunlight through new leaves, the sound of a brook in the
grass, the ripple of tree-shadows over breezy meadows...

When at length the fateful march of the cothurns was stayed by the single
pause in the play, and Darrow had led Miss Viner out on the balcony
overhanging the square before the theatre, he turned to see if she shared
his feelings. But the rapturous look she gave him checked the depreciation
on his lips.

âOh, why did you bring me out here? One ought to creep away and sit in the
dark till it begins again!â

âIs
that
the way they made you feel?â

âDidnât they
you?
...As if the gods were there all the while, just
behind them, pulling the strings?â Her hands were pressed against the
railing, her face shining and darkening under the wing-beats of successive
impressions.

Darrow smiled in enjoyment of her pleasure. After all, he had felt all
that, long ago; perhaps it was his own fault, rather than that of the
actors, that the poetry of the play seemed to have evaporated.... But no, he
had been right in judging the performance to be dull and stale: it was
simply his companionâs inexperience, her lack of occasions to compare and
estimate, that made her think it brilliant.

âI was afraid you were bored and wanted to come away.â

â
Bored
?â She made a little aggrieved grimace. âYou mean you thought me too
ignorant and stupid to appreciate it?â

âNo; not that.â The hand nearest him still lay on the railing of the
balcony, and he covered it for a moment with his. As he did so he saw the
colour rise and tremble in her cheek.

âTell me just what you think,â he said, bending his head a little, and
only half-aware of his words.

She did not turn her face to his, but began to talk rapidly, trying to
convey something of what she felt. But she was evidently unused to
analyzing her aesthetic emotions, and the tumultuous rush of the drama
seemed to have left her in a state of panting wonder, as though it had
been a storm or some other natural cataclysm. She had no literary or
historic associations to which to attach her impressions: her education
had evidently not comprised a course in Greek literature. But she felt
what would probably have been unperceived by many a young lady who had
taken a first in classics: the ineluctable fatality of the tale, the dread
sway in it of the same mysterious âluckâ which pulled the threads of her
own small destiny. It was not literature to her, it was fact: as actual,
as near by, as what was happening to her at the moment and what the next
hour held in store. Seen in this light, the play regained for Darrow its
supreme and poignant reality. He pierced to the heart of its significance
through all the artificial accretions with which his theories of art and
the conventions of the stage had clothed it, and saw it as he had never
seen it: as life.

After this there could be no question of flight, and he took her back to
the theatre, content to receive his own sensations through the medium of
hers. But with the continuation of the play, and the oppression of the
heavy air, his attention again began to wander, straying back over the
incidents of the morning.

He had been with Sophy Viner all day, and he was surprised to find how
quickly the time had gone. She had hardly attempted, as the hours passed,
to conceal her satisfaction on finding that no telegram came from the
Farlows. âTheyâll have written,â she had simply said; and her mind had at
once flown on to the golden prospect of an afternoon at the theatre. The
intervening hours had been disposed of in a stroll through the lively
streets, and a repast, luxuriously lingered over, under the
chestnut-boughs of a restaurant in the Champs Elysees. Everything
entertained and interested her, and Darrow remarked, with an amused
detachment, that she was not insensible to the impression her charms
produced. Yet there was no hard edge of vanity in her sense of her
prettiness: she seemed simply to be aware of it as a note in the general
harmony, and to enjoy sounding the note as a singer enjoys singing.

After luncheon, as they sat over their coffee, she had again asked an
immense number of questions and delivered herself of a remarkable variety
of opinions. Her questions testified to a wholesome and comprehensive
human curiosity, and her comments showed, like her face and her whole
attitude, an odd mingling of precocious wisdom and disarming ignorance.
When she talked to him about âlifeâ—the word was often on her lips—she
seemed to him like a child playing with a tigerâs cub; and he said to
himself that some day the child would grow up—and so would the
tiger. Meanwhile, such expertness qualified by such candour made it
impossible to guess the extent of her personal experience, or to estimate
its effect on her character. She might be any one of a dozen definable
types, or she might—more disconcertingly to her companion and more
perilously to herself—be a shifting and uncrystallized mixture of
them all.

Her talk, as usual, had promptly reverted to the stage. She was eager to
learn about every form of dramatic expression which the metropolis of
things theatrical had to offer, and her curiosity ranged from the official
temples of the art to its less hallowed haunts. Her searching enquiries
about a play whose production, on one of the latter scenes, had provoked a
considerable amount of scandal, led Darrow to throw out laughingly: âTo
see
that
youâll have to wait till youâre married!â and his answer had sent
her off at a tangent.

âOh, I never mean to marry,â she had rejoined in a tone of youthful
finality.

âI seem to have heard that before!â

âYes; from girls whoâve only got to choose!â Her eyes had grown suddenly
almost old. âIâd like you to see the only men whoâve ever wanted to marry
me! One was the doctor on the steamer, when I came abroad with the Hokes:
heâd been cashiered from the navy for drunkenness. The other was a deaf
widower with three grown-up daughters, who kept a clock-shop in Bayswater!—Besides,â
she rambled on, âIâm not so sure that I believe in marriage. You see Iâm
all for self-development and the chance to live oneâs life. Iâm awfully
modern, you know.â

It was just when she proclaimed herself most awfully modern that she
struck him as most helplessly backward; yet the moment after, without any
bravado, or apparent desire to assume an attitude, she would propound some
social axiom which could have been gathered only in the bitter soil of
experience.

All these things came back to him as he sat beside her in the theatre and
watched her ingenuous absorption. It was on âthe storyâ that her mind was
fixed, and in life also, he suspected, it would always be âthe storyâ,
rather than its remoter imaginative issues, that would hold her. He did
not believe there were ever any echoes in her soul...

There was no question, however, that what she felt was felt with
intensity: to the actual, the immediate, she spread vibrating strings.
When the play was over, and they came out once more into the sunlight,
Darrow looked down at her with a smile.

âWell?â he asked.

She made no answer. Her dark gaze seemed to rest on him without seeing
him. Her cheeks and lips were pale, and the loose hair under her hat-brim
clung to her forehead in damp rings. She looked like a young priestess
still dazed by the fumes of the cavern.

âYou poor child—itâs been almost too much for you!â

She shook her head with a vague smile.

âCome,â he went on, putting his hand on her arm, âletâs jump into a taxi
and get some air and sunshine. Look, there are hours of daylight left; and
see what a night itâs going to be!â

He pointed over their heads, to where a white moon hung in the misty blue
above the roofs of the rue de Rivoli.

She made no answer, and he signed to a motor-cab, calling out to the
driver: âTo the Bois!â

As the carriage turned toward the Tuileries she roused herself. âI must go
first to the hotel. There may be a message—at any rate I must decide
on something.â

Darrow saw that the reality of the situation had suddenly forced itself
upon her. âI
must
decide on something,â she repeated.

He would have liked to postpone the return, to persuade her to drive
directly to the Bois for dinner. It would have been easy enough to remind
her that she could not start for Joigny that evening, and that therefore
it was of no moment whether she received the Farlowsâ answer then or a few
hours later; but for some reason he hesitated to use this argument, which
had come so naturally to him the day before. After all, he knew she would
find nothing at the hotel—so what did it matter if they went there?

The porter, interrogated, was not sure. He himself had received nothing
for the lady, but in his absence his subordinate might have sent a letter
upstairs.

Darrow and Sophy mounted together in the lift, and the young man, while
she went into her room, unlocked his own door and glanced at the empty
table. For him at least no message had come; and on her threshold, a
moment later, she met him with the expected: âNo—thereâs nothing!â

He feigned an unregretful surprise. âSo much the better! And now, shall we
drive out somewhere? Or would you rather take a boat to Bellevue? Have you
ever dined there, on the terrace, by moonlight? Itâs not at all bad. And
thereâs no earthly use in sitting here waiting.â

She stood before him in perplexity.

âBut when I wrote yesterday I asked them to telegraph. I suppose theyâre
horribly hard up, the poor dears, and they thought a letter would do as
well as a telegram.â The colour had risen to her face. âThatâs why I wrote
instead of telegraphing; I havenât a penny to spare myself!â

Nothing she could have said could have filled her listener with a deeper
contrition. He felt the red in his own face as he recalled the motive with
which he had credited her in his midnight musings. But that motive, after
all, had simply been trumped up to justify his own disloyalty: he had
never really believed in it. The reflection deepened his confusion, and he
would have liked to take her hand in his and confess the injustice he had
done her.

She may have interpreted his change of colour as an involuntary protest at
being initiated into such shabby details, for she went on with a laugh: âI
suppose you can hardly understand what it means to have to stop and think
whether one can afford a telegram? But Iâve always had to consider such
things. And I mustnât stay here any longer now—I must try to get a
night train for Joigny. Even if the Farlows canât take me in, I can go to
the hotel: it will cost less than staying here.â She paused again and then
exclaimed: âI ought to have thought of that sooner; I ought to have
telegraphed yesterday! But I was sure I should hear from them today; and I
wanted—oh, I
did
so awfully want to stay!â She threw a troubled look
at Darrow. âDo you happen to remember,â she asked, âwhat time it was when
you posted my letter?â

VII

Darrow was still standing on her threshold. As she put the question he
entered the room and closed the door behind him.

His heart was beating a little faster than usual and he had no clear idea
of what he was about to do or say, beyond the definite conviction that,
whatever passing impulse of expiation moved him, he would not be fool
enough to tell her that he had not sent her letter. He knew that most
wrongdoing works, on the whole, less mischief than its useless confession;
and this was clearly a case where a passing folly might be turned, by
avowal, into a serious offense.

âIâm so sorry—so sorry; but you must let me help you.... You will let
me help you?â he said.

He took her hands and pressed them together between his, counting on a
friendly touch to help out the insufficiency of words. He felt her yield
slightly to his clasp, and hurried on without giving her time to answer.

âIsnât it a pity to spoil our good time together by regretting anything
you might have done to prevent our having it?â

She drew back, freeing her hands. Her face, losing its look of appealing
confidence, was suddenly sharpened by distrust.

âYou didnât forget to post my letter?â

Darrow stood before her, constrained and ashamed, and ever more keenly
aware that the betrayal of his distress must be a greater offense than its
concealment.

âWhat an insinuation!â he cried, throwing out his hands with a laugh.

Her face instantly melted to laughter. âWell, then—I
wonât
be sorry;
I wonât regret anything except that our good time is over!â

The words were so unexpected that they routed all his resolves. If she had
gone on doubting him he could probably have gone on deceiving her; but her
unhesitating acceptance of his word made him hate the part he was playing.
At the same moment a doubt shot up its serpent-head in his own bosom. Was
it not he rather than she who was childishly trustful? Was she not almost
too ready to take his word, and dismiss once for all the tiresome question
of the letter? Considering what her experiences must have been, such
trustfulness seemed open to suspicion. But the moment his eyes fell on her
he was ashamed of the thought, and knew it for what it really was: another
pretext to lessen his own delinquency.

âWhy should our good time be over?â he asked. âWhy shouldnât it last a
little longer?â

She looked up, her lips parted in surprise; but before she could speak he
went on: âI want you to stay with me—I want you, just for a few
days, to have all the things youâve never had. Itâs not always May and
Paris—why not make the most of them now? You know me—weâre not
strangers—why shouldnât you treat me like a friend?â

While he spoke she had drawn away a little, but her hand still lay in his.
She was pale, and her eyes were fixed on him in a gaze in which there was
neither distrust or resentment, but only an ingenuous wonder. He was
extraordinarily touched by her expression.

âOh, do! You must. Listen: to prove that Iâm sincere Iâll tell you.... Iâll
tell you I didnât post your letter.... I didnât post it because I wanted so
much to give you a few good hours ... and because I couldnât bear to have
you go.â

He had the feeling that the words were being uttered in spite of him by
some malicious witness of the scene, and yet that he was not sorry to have
them spoken.

The girl had listened to him in silence. She remained motionless for a
moment after he had ceased to speak; then she snatched away her hand.

âYou didnât post my letter? You kept it back on purpose? And you tell me
so
now
, to prove to me that Iâd better put myself under your protection?â
She burst into a laugh that had in it all the piercing echoes of her
Murrett past, and her face, at the same moment, underwent the same change,
shrinking into a small malevolent white mask in which the eyes burned
black. âThank you—thank you most awfully for telling me! And for all
your other kind intentions! The planâs delightful—really quite
delightful, and Iâm extremely flattered and obliged.â

She dropped into a seat beside her dressing-table, resting her chin on her
lifted hands, and laughing out at him under the elf-lock which had shaken
itself down over her eyes.

Her outburst did not offend the young man; its immediate effect was that
of allaying his agitation. The theatrical touch in her manner made his
offense seem more venial than he had thought it a moment before.

He drew up a chair and sat down beside her. âAfter all,â he said, in a
tone of good-humoured protest, âI neednât have told you Iâd kept back your
letter; and my telling you seems rather strong proof that I hadnât any
very nefarious designs on you.â

She met this with a shrug, but he did not give her time to answer. âMy
designs,â he continued with a smile, âwere not nefarious. I saw youâd been
through a bad time with Mrs. Murrett, and that there didnât seem to be
much fun ahead for you; and I didnât see—and I donât yet see—the
harm of trying to give you a few hours of amusement between a depressing
past and a not particularly cheerful future.â He paused again, and then
went on, in the same tone of friendly reasonableness: âThe mistake I made
was not to tell you this at once—not to ask you straight out to give
me a day or two, and let me try to make you forget all the things that are
troubling you. I was a fool not to see that if Iâd put it to you in that
way youâd have accepted or refused, as you chose; but that at least you
wouldnât have mistaken my intentions.—Intentions!â He stood up,
walked the length of the room, and turned back to where she still sat
motionless, her elbows propped on the dressing-table, her chin on her
hands. âWhat rubbish we talk about intentions! The truth is I hadnât any:
I just liked being with you. Perhaps you donât know how extraordinarily
one can like being with you.... I was depressed and adrift myself; and you
made me forget my bothers; and when I found you were going—and going
back to dreariness, as I was—I didnât see why we shouldnât have a
few hours together first; so I left your letter in my pocket.â

He saw her face melt as she listened, and suddenly she unclasped her hands
and leaned to him.

âBut are
you
unhappy too? Oh, I never understood—I never dreamed it!
I thought youâd always had everything in the world you wanted!â

Darrow broke into a laugh at this ingenuous picture of his state. He was
ashamed of trying to better his case by an appeal to her pity, and annoyed
with himself for alluding to a subject he would rather have kept out of
his thoughts. But her look of sympathy had disarmed him; his heart was
bitter and distracted; she was near him, her eyes were shining with
compassion—he bent over her and kissed her hand.

âForgive me—do forgive me,â he said.

She stood up with a smiling head-shake. âOh, itâs not so often that people
try to give me any pleasure—much less two whole days of it! I
shaânât forget how kind youâve been. I shall have plenty of time to
remember. But this
is
good-bye, you know. I must telegraph at once to say
Iâm coming.â

âTo say youâre coming? Then Iâm not forgiven?â

âOh, youâre forgiven—if thatâs any comfort.â

âItâs not, the very least, if your way of proving it is to go away!â

She hung her head in meditation. âBut I canât stay.—How
can
I stay?â
she broke out, as if arguing with some unseen monitor.

âWhy canât you? No one knows youâre here.... No one need ever know.â

She looked up, and their eyes exchanged meanings for a rapid minute. Her
gaze was as clear as a boyâs. âOh, itâs not
that
,â she exclaimed, almost
impatiently; âitâs not people Iâm afraid of! Theyâve never put themselves
out for me—why on earth should I care about them?â

He liked her directness as he had never liked it before. âWell, then, what
is it? Not
me
, I hope?â

âNo, not you: I like you. Itâs the money! With me thatâs always the root
of the matter. I could never yet afford a treat in my life!â

âIs
that
all?â He laughed, relieved by her naturalness. âLook here;
since weâre talking as man to man—canât you trust me about that
too?â

âTrust you? How do you mean? Youâd better not trust
me
!â she laughed back
sharply. âI might never be able to pay up!â

His gesture brushed aside the allusion. âMoney may be the root of the
matter; it canât be the whole of it, between friends. Donât you think one
friend may accept a small service from another without looking too far
ahead or weighing too many chances? The question turns entirely on what
you think of me. If you like me well enough to be willing to take a few
daysâ holiday with me, just for the pleasure of the thing, and the
pleasure youâll be giving me, letâs shake hands on it. If you donât like
me well enough weâll shake hands too; only I shall be sorry,â he ended.

âOh, but I shall be sorry too!â Her face, as she lifted it to his, looked
so small and young that Darrow felt a fugitive twinge of compunction,
instantly effaced by the excitement of pursuit.

âWell, then?â He stood looking down on her, his eyes persuading her. He
was now intensely aware that his nearness was having an effect which made
it less and less necessary for him to choose his words, and he went on,
more mindful of the inflections of his voice than of what he was actually
saying: âWhy on earth should we say good-bye if weâre both sorry to? Wonât
you tell me your reason? Itâs not a bit like you to let anything stand in
the way of your saying just what you feel. You mustnât mind offending me,
you know!â

She hung before him like a leaf on the meeting of cross-currents, that the
next ripple may sweep forward or whirl back. Then she flung up her head
with the odd boyish movement habitual to her in moments of excitement.
âWhat I feel? Do you want to know what I feel? That youâre giving me the
only chance Iâve ever had!â

She turned about on her heel and, dropping into the nearest chair, sank
forward, her face hidden against the dressing-table.

Under the folds of her thin summer dress the modelling of her back and of
her lifted arms, and the slight hollow between her shoulder-blades,
recalled the faint curves of a terra-cotta statuette, some young image of
grace hardly more than sketched in the clay. Darrow, as he stood looking
at her, reflected that her character, for all its seeming firmness, its
flashing edges of âopinionâ, was probably no less immature. He had not
expected her to yield so suddenly to his suggestion, or to confess her
yielding in that way. At first he was slightly disconcerted; then he saw
how her attitude simplified his own. Her behaviour had all the indecision
and awkwardness of inexperience. It showed that she was a child after all;
and all he could do—all he had ever meant to do—was to give
her a childâs holiday to look back to.

For a moment he fancied she was crying; but the next she was on her feet
and had swept round on him a face she must have turned away only to hide
the first rush of her pleasure.

For a while they shone on each other without speaking; then she sprang to
him and held out both hands.

âIs it true? Is it really true? Is it really going to happen to
me
?â

He felt like answering: âYouâre the very creature to whom it was bound to
happenâ; but the words had a double sense that made him wince, and instead
he caught her proffered hands and stood looking at her across the length
of her arms, without attempting to bend them or to draw her closer. He
wanted her to know how her words had moved him; but his thoughts were
blurred by the rush of the same emotion that possessed her, and his own
words came with an effort.

He ended by giving her back a laugh as frank as her own, and declaring, as
he dropped her hands: âAll that and more too—youâll see!â

VIII

All day, since the late reluctant dawn, the rain had come down in
torrents. It streamed against Darrowâs high-perched windows, reduced their
vast prospect of roofs and chimneys to a black oily huddle, and filled the
room with the drab twilight of an underground aquarium.

The streams descended with the regularity of a third dayâs rain, when
trimming and shuffling are over, and the weather has settled down to do
its worst. There were no variations of rhythm, no lyrical ups and downs:
the grey lines streaking the panes were as dense and uniform as a page of
unparagraphed narrative.

George Darrow had drawn his armchair to the fire. The time-table he had
been studying lay on the floor, and he sat staring with dull acquiescence
into the boundless blur of rain, which affected him like a vast projection
of his own state of mind. Then his eyes travelled slowly about the room.

It was exactly ten days since his hurried unpacking had strewn it with the
contents of his portmanteaux. His brushes and razors were spread out on
the blotched marble of the chest of drawers. A stack of newspapers had
accumulated on the centre table under the âelectrolierâ, and half a dozen
paper novels lay on the mantelpiece among cigar-cases and toilet bottles;
but these traces of his passage had made no mark on the featureless
dulness of the room, its look of being the makeshift setting of
innumerable transient collocations. There was something sardonic, almost
sinister, in its appearance of having deliberately âmade upâ for its
anonymous part, all in noncommittal drabs and browns, with a carpet and
paper that nobody would remember, and chairs and tables as impersonal as
railway porters.

Darrow picked up the time-table and tossed it on to the table. Then he
rose to his feet, lit a cigar and went to the window. Through the rain he
could just discover the face of a clock in a tall building beyond the
railway roofs. He pulled out his watch, compared the two time-pieces, and
started the hands of his with such a rush that they flew past the hour and
he had to make them repeat the circuit more deliberately. He felt a quite
disproportionate irritation at the trifling blunder. When he had corrected
it he went back to his chair and threw himself down, leaning back his head
against his hands. Presently his cigar went out, and he got up, hunted for
the matches, lit it again and returned to his seat.

The room was getting on his nerves. During the first few days, while the
skies were clear, he had not noticed it, or had felt for it only the
contemptuous indifference of the traveller toward a provisional shelter.
But now that he was leaving it, was looking at it for the last time, it
seemed to have taken complete possession of his mind, to be soaking itself
into him like an ugly indelible blot. Every detail pressed itself on his
notice with the familiarity of an accidental confidant: whichever way he
turned, he felt the nudge of a transient intimacy...

The one fixed point in his immediate future was that his leave was over
and that he must be back at his post in London the next morning. Within
twenty-four hours he would again be in a daylight world of recognized
activities, himself a busy, responsible, relatively necessary factor in
the big whirring social and official machine. That fixed obligation was
the fact he could think of with the least discomfort, yet for some
unaccountable reason it was the one on which he found it most difficult to
fix his thoughts. Whenever he did so, the room jerked him back into the
circle of its insistent associations. It was extraordinary with what a
microscopic minuteness of loathing he hated it all: the grimy carpet and
wallpaper, the black marble mantel-piece, the clock with a gilt allegory
under a dusty bell, the high-bolstered brown-counterpaned bed, the framed
card of printed rules under the electric light switch, and the door of
communication with the next room. He hated the door most of all...

At the outset, he had felt no special sense of responsibility. He was
satisfied that he had struck the right note, and convinced of his power of
sustaining it. The whole incident had somehow seemed, in spite of its
vulgar setting and its inevitable prosaic propinquities, to be enacting
itself in some unmapped region outside the pale of the usual. It was not
like anything that had ever happened to him before, or in which he had
ever pictured himself as likely to be involved; but that, at first, had
seemed no argument against his fitness to deal with it.

Perhaps but for the three daysâ rain he might have got away without a
doubt as to his adequacy. The rain had made all the difference. It had
thrown the whole picture out of perspective, blotted out the mystery of
the remoter planes and the enchantment of the middle distance, and thrust
into prominence every commonplace fact of the foreground. It was the kind
of situation that was not helped by being thought over; and by the
perversity of circumstance he had been forced into the unwilling
contemplation of its every aspect...

His cigar had gone out again, and he threw it into the fire and vaguely
meditated getting up to find another. But the mere act of leaving his
chair seemed to call for a greater exertion of the will than he was
capable of, and he leaned his head back with closed eyes and listened to
the drumming of the rain.

A different noise aroused him. It was the opening and closing of the door
leading from the corridor into the adjoining room. He sat motionless,
without opening his eyes; but now another sight forced itself under his
lowered lids. It was the precise photographic picture of that other room.
Everything in it rose before him and pressed itself upon his vision with
the same acuity of distinctness as the objects surrounding him. A step
sounded on the floor, and he knew which way the step was directed, what
pieces of furniture it had to skirt, where it would probably pause, and
what was likely to arrest it. He heard another sound, and recognized it as
that of a wet umbrella placed in the black marble jamb of the
chimney-piece, against the hearth. He caught the creak of a hinge, and
instantly differentiated it as that of the wardrobe against the opposite
wall. Then he heard the mouse-like squeal of a reluctant drawer, and knew
it was the upper one in the chest of drawers beside the bed: the clatter
which followed was caused by the mahogany toilet-glass jumping on its
loosened pivots...

The step crossed the floor again. It was strange how much better he knew
it than the person to whom it belonged! Now it was drawing near the door
of communication between the two rooms. He opened his eyes and looked. The
step had ceased and for a moment there was silence. Then he heard a low
knock. He made no response, and after an interval he saw that the door
handle was being tentatively turned. He closed his eyes once more...

The door opened, and the step was in the room, coming cautiously toward
him. He kept his eyes shut, relaxing his body to feign sleep. There was
another pause, then a wavering soft advance, the rustle of a dress behind
his chair, the warmth of two hands pressed for a moment on his lids. The
palms of the hands had the lingering scent of some stuff that he had
bought on the Boulevard.... He looked up and saw a letter falling over his
shoulder to his knee...

âDid I disturb you? Iâm so sorry! They gave me this just now when I came
in.â

The letter, before he could catch it, had slipped between his knees to the
floor. It lay there, address upward, at his feet, and while he sat staring
down at the strong slender characters on the blue-gray envelope an arm
reached out from behind to pick it up.

âOh, donât—DONâTâ broke from him, and he bent over and caught the
arm. The face above it was close to his.

âDonât what?â

——âtake the trouble,â he stammered.

He dropped the arm and stooped down. His grasp closed over the letter, he
fingered its thickness and weight and calculated the number of sheets it
must contain.

Suddenly he felt the pressure of the hand on his shoulder, and became
aware that the face was still leaning over him, and that in a moment he
would have to look up and kiss it...

He bent forward first and threw the unopened letter into the middle of the
fire.

IX

The light of the October afternoon lay on an old high-roofed house which
enclosed in its long expanse of brick and yellowish stone the breadth of a
grassy court filled with the shadow and sound of limes.

From the escutcheoned piers at the entrance of the court a level drive,
also shaded by limes, extended to a white-barred gate beyond which an
equally level avenue of grass, cut through a wood, dwindled to a
blue-green blur against a sky banked with still white slopes of cloud.

In the court, half-way between house and drive, a lady stood. She held a
parasol above her head, and looked now at the house-front, with its double
flight of steps meeting before a glazed door under sculptured trophies,
now down the drive toward the grassy cutting through the wood. Her air was
less of expectancy than of contemplation: she seemed not so much to be
watching for any one, or listening for an approaching sound, as letting
the whole aspect of the place sink into her while she held herself open to
its influence. Yet it was no less apparent that the scene was not new to
her. There was no eagerness of investigation in her survey: she seemed
rather to be looking about her with eyes to which, for some intimate
inward reason, details long since familiar had suddenly acquired an
unwonted freshness.

This was in fact the exact sensation of which Mrs. Leath was conscious as
she came forth from the house and descended into the sunlit court. She had
come to meet her step-son, who was likely to be returning at that hour
from an afternoonâs shooting in one of the more distant plantations, and
she carried in her hand the letter which had sent her in search of him;
but with her first step out of the house all thought of him had been
effaced by another series of impressions.

The scene about her was known to satiety. She had seen Givre at all
seasons of the year, and for the greater part of every year, since the
far-off day of her marriage; the day when, ostensibly driving through its
gates at her husbandâs side, she had actually been carried there on a
cloud of iris-winged visions.

The possibilities which the place had then represented were still vividly
present to her. The mere phrase âa French chateauâ had called up to her
youthful fancy a throng of romantic associations, poetic, pictorial and
emotional; and the serene face of the old house seated in its park among
the poplar-bordered meadows of middle France, had seemed, on her first
sight of it, to hold out to her a fate as noble and dignified as its own
mien.

Though she could still call up that phase of feeling it had long since
passed, and the house had for a time become to her the very symbol of
narrowness and monotony. Then, with the passing of years, it had gradually
acquired a less inimical character, had become, not again a castle of
dreams, evoker of fair images and romantic legend, but the shell of a life
slowly adjusted to its dwelling: the place one came back to, the place
where one had oneâs duties, oneâs habits and oneâs books, the place one
would naturally live in till one died: a dull house, an inconvenient
house, of which one knew all the defects, the shabbinesses, the
discomforts, but to which one was so used that one could hardly, after so
long a time, think oneâs self away from it without suffering a certain
loss of identity.

Now, as it lay before her in the autumn mildness, its mistress was
surprised at her own insensibility. She had been trying to see the house
through the eyes of an old friend who, the next morning, would be driving
up to it for the first time; and in so doing she seemed to be opening her
own eyes upon it after a long interval of blindness.

The court was very still, yet full of a latent life: the wheeling and
rustling of pigeons about the rectangular yews and across the sunny
gravel; the sweep of rooks above the lustrous greyish-purple slates of the
roof, and the stir of the tree-tops as they met the breeze which every
day, at that hour, came punctually up from the river.

Just such a latent animation glowed in Anna Leath. In every nerve and vein
she was conscious of that equipoise of bliss which the fearful human heart
scarce dares acknowledge. She was not used to strong or full emotions; but
she had always known that she should not be afraid of them. She was not
afraid now; but she felt a deep inward stillness.

The immediate effect of the feeling had been to send her forth in quest of
her step-son. She wanted to stroll back with him and have a quiet talk
before they re-entered the house. It was always easy to talk to him, and
at this moment he was the one person to whom she could have spoken without
fear of disturbing her inner stillness. She was glad, for all sorts of
reasons, that Madame de Chantelle and Effie were still at Ouchy with the
governess, and that she and Owen had the house to themselves. And she was
glad that even he was not yet in sight. She wanted to be alone a little
longer; not to think, but to let the long slow waves of joy break over her
one by one.

She walked out of the court and sat down on one of the benches that
bordered the drive. From her seat she had a diagonal view of the long
house-front and of the domed chapel terminating one of the wings. Beyond a
gate in the court-yard wall the flower-garden drew its dark-green squares
and raised its statues against the yellowing background of the park. In
the borders only a few late pinks and crimsons smouldered, but a peacock
strutting in the sun seemed to have gathered into his out-spread fan all
the summer glories of the place.

In Mrs. Leathâs hand was the letter which had opened her eyes to these
things, and a smile rose to her lips at the mere feeling of the paper
between her fingers. The thrill it sent through her gave a keener edge to
every sense. She felt, saw, breathed the shining world as though a thin
impenetrable veil had suddenly been removed from it.

Just such a veil, she now perceived, had always hung between herself and
life. It had been like the stage gauze which gives an illusive air of
reality to the painted scene behind it, yet proves it, after all, to be no
more than a painted scene.

She had been hardly aware, in her girlhood, of differing from others in
this respect. In the well-regulated well-fed Summers world the unusual was
regarded as either immoral or ill-bred, and people with emotions were not
visited. Sometimes, with a sense of groping in a topsy-turvy universe,
Anna had wondered why everybody about her seemed to ignore all the
passions and sensations which formed the stuff of great poetry and
memorable action. In a community composed entirely of people like her
parents and her parentsâ friends she did not see how the magnificent
things one read about could ever have happened. She was sure that if
anything of the kind had occurred in her immediate circle her mother would
have consulted the family clergyman, and her father perhaps even have rung
up the police; and her sense of humour compelled her to own that, in the
given conditions, these precautions might not have been unjustified.

Little by little the conditions conquered her, and she learned to regard
the substance of life as a mere canvas for the embroideries of poet and
painter, and its little swept and fenced and tended surface as its actual
substance. It was in the visioned region of action and emotion that her
fullest hours were spent; but it hardly occurred to her that they might be
translated into experience, or connected with anything likely to happen to
a young lady living in West Fifty-fifth Street.

She perceived, indeed, that other girls, leading outwardly the same life
as herself, and seemingly unaware of her world of hidden beauty, were yet
possessed of some vital secret which escaped her. There seemed to be a
kind of freemasonry between them; they were wider awake than she, more
alert, and surer of their wants if not of their opinions. She supposed
they were âclevererâ, and accepted her inferiority good-humouredly, half
aware, within herself, of a reserve of unused power which the others gave
no sign of possessing.

This partly consoled her for missing so much of what made their âgood
timeâ; but the resulting sense of exclusion, of being somehow laughingly
but firmly debarred from a share of their privileges, threw her back on
herself and deepened the reserve which made envious mothers cite her as a
model of ladylike repression. Love, she told herself, would one day
release her from this spell of unreality. She was persuaded that the
sublime passion was the key to the enigma; but it was difficult to relate
her conception of love to the forms it wore in her experience. Two or
three of the girls she had envied for their superior acquaintance with the
arts of life had contracted, in the course of time, what were variously
described as âromanticâ or âfoolishâ marriages; one even made a runaway
match, and languished for a while under a cloud of social reprobation.
Here, then, was passion in action, romance converted to reality; yet the
heroines of these exploits returned from them untransfigured, and their
husbands were as dull as ever when one had to sit next to them at dinner.

Her own case, of course, would be different. Some day she would find the
magic bridge between West Fifty-fifth Street and life; once or twice she
had even fancied that the clue was in her hand. The first time was when
she had met young Darrow. She recalled even now the stir of the encounter.
But his passion swept over her like a wind that shakes the roof of the
forest without reaching its still glades or rippling its hidden pools. He
was extraordinarily intelligent and agreeable, and her heart beat faster
when he was with her. He had a tall fair easy presence and a mind in which
the lights of irony played pleasantly through the shades of feeling. She
liked to hear his voice almost as much as to listen to what he was saying,
and to listen to what he was saying almost as much as to feel that he was
looking at her; but he wanted to kiss her, and she wanted to talk to him
about books and pictures, and have him insinuate the eternal theme of
their love into every subject they discussed.

Whenever they were apart a reaction set in. She wondered how she could
have been so cold, called herself a prude and an idiot, questioned if any
man could really care for her, and got up in the dead of night to try new
ways of doing her hair. But as soon as he reappeared her head straightened
itself on her slim neck and she sped her little shafts of irony, or flew
her little kites of erudition, while hot and cold waves swept over her,
and the things she really wanted to say choked in her throat and burned
the palms of her hands.

Often she told herself that any silly girl who had waltzed through a
season would know better than she how to attract a man and hold him; but
when she said âa manâ she did not really mean George Darrow.

Then one day, at a dinner, she saw him sitting next to one of the silly
girls in question: the heroine of the elopement which had shaken West
Fifty-fifth Street to its base. The young lady had come back from her
adventure no less silly than when she went; and across the table the
partner of her flight, a fat young man with eye-glasses, sat stolidly
eating terrapin and talking about polo and investments.

The young woman was undoubtedly as silly as ever; yet after watching her
for a few minutes Miss Summers perceived that she had somehow grown
luminous, perilous, obscurely menacing to nice girls and the young men
they intended eventually to accept. Suddenly, at the sight, a rage of
possessorship awoke in her. She must save Darrow, assert her right to him
at any price. Pride and reticence went down in a hurricane of jealousy.
She heard him laugh, and there was something new in his laugh.... She
watched him talking, talking.... He sat slightly sideways, a faint smile
beneath his lids, lowering his voice as he lowered it when he talked to
her. She caught the same inflections, but his eyes were different. It
would have offended her once if he had looked at her like that. Now her
one thought was that none but she had a right to be so looked at. And that
girl of all others! What illusions could he have about a girl who, hardly
a year ago, had made a fool of herself over the fat young man stolidly
eating terrapin across the table? If that was where romance and passion
ended, it was better to take to district visiting or algebra!

All night she lay awake and wondered: âWhat was she saying to him? How
shall I learn to say such things?â and she decided that her heart would
tell her—that the next time they were alone together the
irresistible word would spring to her lips. He came the next day, and they
were alone, and all she found was: âI didnât know that you and Kitty Mayne
were such friends.â

He answered with indifference that he didnât know it either, and in the
reaction of relief she declared: âSheâs certainly ever so much prettier
than she was...â

âSheâs rather good fun,â he admitted, as though he had not noticed her
other advantages; and suddenly Anna saw in his eyes the look she had seen
there the previous evening.

She felt as if he were leagues and leagues away from her. All her hopes
dissolved, and she was conscious of sitting rigidly, with high head and
straight lips, while the irresistible word fled with a last wing-beat into
the golden mist of her illusions...

She was still quivering with the pain and bewilderment of this adventure
when Fraser Leath appeared. She met him first in Italy, where she was
travelling with her parents; and the following winter he came to New York.
In Italy he had seemed interesting: in New York he became remarkable. He
seldom spoke of his life in Europe, and let drop but the most incidental
allusions to the friends, the tastes, the pursuits which filled his
cosmopolitan days; but in the atmosphere of West Fifty-fifth Street he
seemed the embodiment of a storied past. He presented Miss Summers with a
prettily-bound anthology of the old French poets and, when she showed a
discriminating pleasure in the gift, observed with his grave smile: âI
didnât suppose I should find any one here who would feel about these
things as I do.â On another occasion he asked her acceptance of a
half-effaced eighteenth century pastel which he had surprisingly picked up
in a New York auction-room. âI know no one but you who would really
appreciate it,â he explained.

He permitted himself no other comments, but these conveyed with sufficient
directness that he thought her worthy of a different setting. That she
should be so regarded by a man living in an atmosphere of art and beauty,
and esteeming them the vital elements of life, made her feel for the first
time that she was understood. Here was some one whose scale of values was
the same as hers, and who thought her opinion worth hearing on the very
matters which they both considered of supreme importance. The discovery
restored her self-confidence, and she revealed herself to Mr. Leath as she
had never known how to reveal herself to Darrow.

As the courtship progressed, and they grew more confidential, her suitor
surprised and delighted her by little explosions of revolutionary
sentiment. He said: âShall you mind, I wonder, if I tell you that you live
in a dread-fully conventional atmosphere?â and, seeing that she manifestly
did not mind: âOf course I shall say things now and then that will horrify
your dear delightful parents—I shall shock them awfully, I warn
you.â

In confirmation of this warning he permitted himself an occasional playful
fling at the regular church-going of Mr. and Mrs. Summers, at the
innocuous character of the literature in their library, and at their
guileless appreciations in art. He even ventured to banter Mrs. Summers on
her refusal to receive the irrepressible Kitty Mayne who, after a rapid
passage with George Darrow, was now involved in another and more flagrant
adventure.

âIn Europe, you know, the husband is regarded as the only judge in such
matters. As long as he accepts the situation—â Mr. Leath explained
to Anna, who took his view the more emphatically in order to convince
herself that, personally, she had none but the most tolerant sentiments
toward the lady.

The subversiveness of Mr. Leathâs opinions was enhanced by the distinction
of his appearance and the reserve of his manners. He was like the
anarchist with a gardenia in his buttonhole who figures in the higher
melodrama. Every word, every allusion, every note of his
agreeably-modulated voice, gave Anna a glimpse of a society at once freer
and finer, which observed the traditional forms but had discarded the
underlying prejudices; whereas the world she knew had discarded many of
the forms and kept almost all the prejudices.

In such an atmosphere as his an eager young woman, curious as to all the
manifestations of life, yet instinctively desiring that they should come
to her in terms of beauty and fine feeling, must surely find the largest
scope for self-expression. Study, travel, the contact of the world, the
comradeship of a polished and enlightened mind, would combine to enrich
her days and form her character; and it was only in the rare moments when
Mr. Leathâs symmetrical blond mask bent over hers, and his kiss dropped on
her like a cold smooth pebble, that she questioned the completeness of the
joys he offered.

There had been a time when the walls on which her gaze now rested had shed
a glare of irony on these early dreams. In the first years of her marriage
the sober symmetry of Givre had suggested only her husbandâs
neatly-balanced mind. It was a mind, she soon learned, contentedly
absorbed in formulating the conventions of the unconventional. West
Fifty-fifth Street was no more conscientiously concerned than Givre with
the momentous question of âwhat people didâ; it was only the type of deed
investigated that was different. Mr. Leath collected his social instances
with the same seriousness and patience as his snuff-boxes. He exacted a
rigid conformity to his rules of non-conformity and his scepticism had the
absolute accent of a dogma. He even cherished certain exceptions to his
rules as the book-collector prizes a âdefectiveâ first edition. The
Protestant church-going of Annaâs parents had provoked his gentle sarcasm;
but he prided himself on his motherâs devoutness, because Madame de
Chantelle, in embracing her second husbandâs creed, had become part of a
society which still observes the outward rites of piety.

Anna, in fact, had discovered in her amiable and elegant mother-in-law an
unexpected embodiment of the West Fifty-fifth Street ideal. Mrs. Summers
and Madame de Chantelle, however strongly they would have disagreed as to
the authorized source of Christian dogma, would have found themselves
completely in accord on all the momentous minutiae of drawing-room
conduct; yet Mr. Leath treated his motherâs foibles with a respect which
Annaâs experience of him forbade her to attribute wholly to filial
affection.

In the early days, when she was still questioning the Sphinx instead of
trying to find an answer to it, she ventured to tax her husband with his
inconsistency.

âYou say your mother wonât like it if I call on that amusing little woman
who came here the other day, and was let in by mistake; but Madame de
Chantelle tells me she lives with her husband, and when mother refused to
visit Kitty Mayne you said——â

Mr. Leathâs smile arrested her. âMy dear child, I donât pretend to apply
the principles of logic to my poor motherâs prejudices.â

âBut if you admit that they
are
prejudices——?â

âThere are prejudices and prejudices. My mother, of course, got hers from
Monsieur de Chantelle, and they seem to me as much in their place in this
house as the pot-pourri in your hawthorn jar. They preserve a social
tradition of which I should be sorry to lose the least perfume. Of course
I donât expect you, just at first, to feel the difference, to see the
nuance. In the case of little Madame de Vireville, for instance: you point
out that sheâs still under her husbandâs roof. Very true; and if she were
merely a Paris acquaintance—especially if you had met her, as one
still might, in the
right kind
of house in Paris—I should be the
last to object to your visiting her. But in the country itâs different.
Even the best provincial society is what you would call narrow: I donât
deny it; and if some of our friends met Madame de Vireville at Givre—well,
it would produce a bad impression. Youâre inclined to ridicule such
considerations, but gradually youâll come to see their importance; and
meanwhile, do trust me when I ask you to be guided by my mother. It is
always well for a stranger in an old society to err a little on the side
of what you call its prejudices but I should rather describe as its
traditions.â

After that she no longer tried to laugh or argue her husband out of his
convictions. They
were
convictions, and therefore unassailable. Nor was
any insincerity implied in the fact that they sometimes seemed to coincide
with hers. There were occasions when he really did look at things as she
did; but for reasons so different as to make the distance between them all
the greater. Life, to Mr. Leath, was like a walk through a carefully
classified museum, where, in moments of doubt, one had only to look at the
number and refer to oneâs catalogue; to his wife it was like groping about
in a huge dark lumber-room where the exploring ray of curiosity lit up now
some shape of breathing beauty and now a mummyâs grin.

In the first bewilderment of her new state these discoveries had had the
effect of dropping another layer of gauze between herself and reality. She
seemed farther than ever removed from the strong joys and pangs for which
she felt herself made. She did not adopt her husbandâs views, but
insensibly she began to live his life. She tried to throw a compensating
ardour into the secret excursions of her spirit, and thus the old vicious
distinction between romance and reality was re-established for her, and
she resigned herself again to the belief that âreal lifeâ was neither real
nor alive.

The birth of her little girl swept away this delusion. At last she felt
herself in contact with the actual business of living: but even this
impression was not enduring.

Everything but the irreducible crude fact of child-bearing assumed, in the
Leath household, the same ghostly tinge of unreality. Her husband, at the
time, was all that his own ideal of a husband required. He was attentive,
and even suitably moved: but as he sat by her bedside, and thoughtfully
proffered to her the list of people who had âcalled to enquireâ, she
looked first at him, and then at the child between them, and wondered at
the blundering alchemy of Nature...

With the exception of the little girl herself, everything connected with
that time had grown curiously remote and unimportant. The days that had
moved so slowly as they passed seemed now to have plunged down head-long
steeps of time; and as she sat in the autumn sun, with Darrowâs letter in
her hand, the history of Anna Leath appeared to its heroine like some grey
shadowy tale that she might have read in an old book, one night as she was
falling asleep...

X

Two brown blurs emerging from the farther end of the wood-vista gradually
defined themselves as her step-son and an attendant game-keeper. They grew
slowly upon the bluish background, with occasional delays and
re-effacements, and she sat still, waiting till they should reach the gate
at the end of the drive, where the keeper would turn off to his cottage
and Owen continue on to the house.

She watched his approach with a smile. From the first days of her marriage
she had been drawn to the boy, but it was not until after Effieâs birth
that she had really begun to know him. The eager observation of her own
child had shown her how much she had still to learn about the slight fair
boy whom the holidays periodically restored to Givre. Owen, even then,
both physically and morally, furnished her with the oddest of commentaries
on his fatherâs mien and mind. He would never, the family sighingly
recognized, be nearly as handsome as Mr. Leath; but his rather charmingly
unbalanced face, with its brooding forehead and petulant boyish smile,
suggested to Anna what his fatherâs countenance might have been could one
have pictured its neat features disordered by a rattling breeze. She even
pushed the analogy farther, and descried in her step-sonâs mind a
quaintly-twisted reflection of her husbandâs. With his bursts of
door-slamming activity, his fits of bookish indolence, his crude
revolutionary dogmatizing and his flashes of precocious irony, the boy was
not unlike a boisterous embodiment of his fatherâs theories. It was as
though Fraser Leathâs ideas, accustomed to hang like marionettes on their
pegs, should suddenly come down and walk. There were moments, indeed, when
Owenâs humours must have suggested to his progenitor the gambols of an
infant Frankenstein; but to Anna they were the voice of her secret
rebellions, and her tenderness to her step-son was partly based on her
severity toward herself. As he had the courage she had lacked, so she
meant him to have the chances she had missed; and every effort she made
for him helped to keep her own hopes alive.

Her interest in Owen led her to think more often of his mother, and
sometimes she would slip away and stand alone before her predecessorâs
portrait. Since her arrival at Givre the picture—a âfull-lengthâ by
a once fashionable artist—had undergone the successive displacements
of an exiled consort removed farther and farther from the throne; and Anna
could not help noting that these stages coincided with the gradual decline
of the artistâs fame. She had a fancy that if his credit had been in the
ascendant the first Mrs. Leath might have continued to throne over the
drawing-room mantel-piece, even to the exclusion of her successorâs
effigy. Instead of this, her peregrinations had finally landed her in the
shrouded solitude of the billiard-room, an apartment which no one ever
entered, but where it was understood that âthe light was better,â or might
have been if the shutters had not been always closed.

Here the poor lady, elegantly dressed, and seated in the middle of a large
lonely canvas, in the blank contemplation of a gilt console, had always
seemed to Anna to be waiting for visitors who never came.

âOf course they never came, you poor thing! I wonder how long it took you
to find out that they never would?â Anna had more than once apostrophized
her, with a derision addressed rather to herself than to the dead; but it
was only after Effieâs birth that it occurred to her to study more closely
the face in the picture, and speculate on the kind of visitors that Owenâs
mother might have hoped for.

âShe certainly doesnât look as if they would have been the same kind as
mine: but thereâs no telling, from a portrait that was so obviously done
âto please the familyâ, and that leaves Owen so unaccounted for. Well,
they never came, the visitors; they never came; and she died of it. She
died of it long before they buried her: Iâm certain of that. Those are
stone-dead eyes in the picture.... The loneliness must have been awful, if
even Owen couldnât keep her from dying of it. And to feel it so she must
have
had
feelings—real live ones, the kind that twitch and tug. And
all she had to look at all her life was a gilt console—yes, thatâs
it, a gilt console screwed to the wall! Thatâs exactly and absolutely what
he is!â

She did not mean, if she could help it, that either Effie or Owen should
know that loneliness, or let her know it again. They were three, now, to
keep each other warm, and she embraced both children in the same passion
of motherhood, as though one were not enough to shield her from her
predecessorâs fate.

Sometimes she fancied that Owen Leathâs response was warmer than that of
her own child. But then Effie was still hardly more than a baby, and Owen,
from the first, had been almost âold enough to understandâ: certainly
did

understand now, in a tacit way that yet perpetually spoke to her. This
sense of his understanding was the deepest element in their feeling for
each other. There were so many things between them that were never spoken
of, or even indirectly alluded to, yet that, even in their occasional
discussions and differences, formed the unadduced arguments making for
final agreement...

Musing on this, she continued to watch his approach; and her heart began
to beat a little faster at the thought of what she had to say to him. But
when he reached the gate she saw him pause, and after a moment he turned
aside as if to gain a cross-road through the park.

She started up and waved her sunshade, but he did not see her. No doubt he
meant to go back with the gamekeeper, perhaps to the kennels, to see a
retriever who had hurt his leg. Suddenly she was seized by the whim to
overtake him. She threw down the parasol, thrust her letter into her
bodice, and catching up her skirts began to run.

She was slight and light, with a natural ease and quickness of gait, but
she could not recall having run a yard since she had romped with Owen in
his school-days; nor did she know what impulse moved her now. She only
knew that run she must, that no other motion, short of flight, would have
been buoyant enough for her humour. She seemed to be keeping pace with
some inward rhythm, seeking to give bodily expression to the lyric rush of
her thoughts. The earth always felt elastic under her, and she had a
conscious joy in treading it; but never had it been as soft and springy as
today. It seemed actually to rise and meet her as she went, so that she
had the feeling, which sometimes came to her in dreams, of skimming
miraculously over short bright waves. The air, too, seemed to break in
waves against her, sweeping by on its current all the slanted lights and
moist sharp perfumes of the failing day. She panted to herself: âThis is
nonsense!â her blood hummed back: âBut itâs glorious!â and she sped on
till she saw that Owen had caught sight of her and was striding back in
her direction.

Then she stopped and waited, flushed and laughing, her hands clasped
against the letter in her breast.

âNo, Iâm not mad,â she called out; âbut thereâs something in the air today—donât
you feel it?—And I wanted to have a little talk with you,â she added
as he came up to her, smiling at him and linking her arm in his.

He smiled back, but above the smile she saw the shade of anxiety which,
for the last two months, had kept its fixed line between his handsome
eyes.

âOwen, donât look like that! I donât want you to!â she said imperiously.

He laughed. âYou said that exactly like Effie. What do you want me to do?
To race with you as I do Effie? But I shouldnât have a show!â he
protested, still with the little frown between his eyes.

âWhere are you going?â she asked.

âTo the kennels. But thereâs not the least need. The vet has seen Garry
and heâs all right. If thereâs anything you wanted to tell me——â

âDid I say there was? I just came out to meet you—I wanted to know
if youâd had good sport.â

The shadow dropped on him again. âNone at all. The fact is I didnât try.
Jean and I have just been knocking about in the woods. I wasnât in a
sanguinary mood.â

They walked on with the same light gait, so nearly of a height that
keeping step came as naturally to them as breathing. Anna stole another
look at the young face on a level with her own.

âYou
did
say there was something you wanted to tell me,â her step-son
began after a pause.

âWell, there is.â She slackened her pace involuntarily, and they came to a
pause and stood facing each other under the limes.

âIs Darrow coming?â he asked.

She seldom blushed, but at the question a sudden heat suffused her. She
held her head high.

âYes: heâs coming. Iâve just heard. He arrives to-morrow. But thatâs not——â
She saw her blunder and tried to rectify it. âOr rather, yes, in a way it
is my reason for wanting to speak to you——â

âBecause heâs coming?â

âBecause heâs not yet here.â

âItâs about him, then?â

He looked at her kindly, half-humourously, an almost fraternal wisdom in
his smile.

âAbout——? No, no: I meant that I wanted to speak today because
itâs our last day alone together.â

âOh, I see.â He had slipped his hands into the pockets of his tweed
shooting jacket and lounged along at her side, his eyes bent on the moist
ruts of the drive, as though the matter had lost all interest for him.

âOwen——â

He stopped again and faced her. âLook here, my dear, itâs no sort of use.â

âWhatâs no use?â

âAnything on earth you can any of you say.â

She challenged him: âAm I one of âany of youâ?â

He did not yield. âWell, then—anything on earth that even
you
can
say.â âYou donât in the least know what I can say—or what I mean
to.â

âDonât I, generally?â

She gave him this point, but only to make another. âYes; but this is
particularly. I want to say.... Owen, youâve been admirable all through.â

He broke into a laugh in which the odd elder-brotherly note was once more
perceptible.

âAdmirable,â she emphasized. âAnd so has
she
.â

âOh, and so have you to
her
!â His voice broke down to boyishness. âIâve
never lost sight of that for a minute. Itâs been altogether easier for
her, though,â he threw off presently.

âOn the whole, I suppose it has. Well——â she summed up with a
laugh, âarenât you all the better pleased to be told youâve behaved as
well as she?â

âOh, you know, Iâve not done it for you,â he tossed back at her, without
the least note of hostility in the affected lightness of his tone.

âHavenât you, though, perhaps—the least bit? Because, after all, you
knew I understood?â

âYouâve been awfully kind about pretending to.â

She laughed. âYou donât believe me? You must remember I had your
grandmother to consider.â

âYes: and my father—and Effie, I suppose—and the outraged
shades of Givre!â He paused, as if to lay more stress on the boyish sneer:
âDo you likewise include the late Monsieur de Chantelle?â

His step-mother did not appear to resent the thrust. She went on, in the
same tone of affectionate persuasion: âYes: I must have seemed to you too
subject to Givre. Perhaps I have been. But you know that was not my real
object in asking you to wait, to say nothing to your grandmother before
her return.â

He considered. âYour real object, of course, was to gain time.â

âYes—but for whom? Why not for
you
?â

âFor me?â He flushed up quickly. âYou donât mean——?â

She laid her hand on his arm and looked gravely into his handsome eyes.

âI mean that when your grandmother gets back from Ouchy I shall speak to
her——â âYouâll speak to her...?â

âYes; if only youâll promise to give me time——â

âTime for her to send for Adelaide Painter?â

âOh, sheâll undoubtedly send for Adelaide Painter!â

The allusion touched a spring of mirth in both their minds, and they
exchanged a laughing look.

âOnly you must promise not to rush things. You must give me time to
prepare Adelaide too,â Mrs. Leath went on.

âPrepare her too?â He drew away for a better look at her. âPrepare her for
what?â

âWhy, to prepare your grandmother! For your marriage. Yes, thatâs what I
mean. Iâm going to see you through, you know——â

His feint of indifference broke down and he caught her hand. âOh, you dear
divine thing! I didnât dream——â

âI know you didnât.â She dropped her gaze and began to walk on slowly. âI
canât say youâve convinced me of the wisdom of the step. Only I seem to
see that other things matter more—and that not missing things
matters most. Perhaps Iâve changed—or
your
not changing has
convinced me. Iâm certain now that you wonât budge. And that was really
all I ever cared about.â

âOh, as to not budging—I told you so months ago: you might have been
sure of that! And how can you be any surer today than yesterday?â

âI donât know. I suppose one learns something every day——â

âNot at Givre!â he laughed, and shot a half-ironic look at her. âBut you
havenât really
been
at Givre lately—not for months! Donât you
suppose Iâve noticed that, my dear?â

She echoed his laugh to merge it in an undenying sigh. âPoor Givre...â

âPoor empty Givre! With so many rooms full and yet not a soul in it—except
of course my grandmother, who is its soul!â

They had reached the gateway of the court and stood looking with a common
accord at the long soft-hued facade on which the autumn light was dying.
âIt looks so made to be happy in——â she murmured.

âYes—today, today!â He pressed her arm a little. âOh, you darling—to
have given it that look for me!â He paused, and then went on in a lower
voice: âDonât you feel we owe it to the poor old place to do what we can
to give it that look? You, too, I mean? Come, letâs make it grin from wing
to wing! Iâve such a mad desire to say outrageous things to it—havenât
you? After all, in old times there must have been living people here!â

Loosening her arm from his she continued to gaze up at the house-front,
which seemed, in the plaintive decline of light, to send her back the mute
appeal of something doomed.

âIt
is
beautiful,â she said.

âA beautiful memory! Quite perfect to take out and turn over when Iâm
grinding at the law in New York, and youâre——â He broke off
and looked at her with a questioning smile. âCome! Tell me. You and I
donât have to say things to talk to each other. When you turn suddenly
absentminded and mysterious I always feel like saying: âCome back. All is
discoveredâ.â

She returned his smile. âYou know as much as I know. I promise you that.â

He wavered, as if for the first time uncertain how far he might go. âI
donât know Darrow as much as you know him,â he presently risked.

She frowned a little. âYou said just now we didnât need to say thingsâ

âWas I speaking? I thought it was your eyes——â He caught her
by both elbows and spun her halfway round, so that the late sun shed a
betraying gleam on her face. âTheyâre such awfully conversational eyes!
Donât you suppose they told me long ago why itâs just today youâve made up
your mind that people have got to live their own lives—even at
Givre?â

XI

âThis is the south terrace,â Anna said. âShould you like to walk down to
the river?â

She seemed to listen to herself speaking from a far-off airy height, and
yet to be wholly gathered into the circle of consciousness which drew its
glowing ring about herself and Darrow. To the aerial listener her words
sounded flat and colourless, but to the self within the ring each one beat
with a separate heart.

It was the day after Darrowâs arrival, and he had come down early, drawn
by the sweetness of the light on the lawns and gardens below his window.
Anna had heard the echo of his step on the stairs, his pause in the
stone-flagged hall, his voice as he asked a servant where to find her. She
was at the end of the house, in the brown-panelled sitting-room which she
frequented at that season because it caught the sunlight first and kept it
longest. She stood near the window, in the pale band of brightness,
arranging some salmon-pink geraniums in a shallow porcelain bowl. Every
sensation of touch and sight was thrice-alive in her. The grey-green fur
of the geranium leaves caressed her fingers and the sunlight wavering
across the irregular surface of the old parquet floor made it seem as
bright and shifting as the brown bed of a stream.

Darrow stood framed in the door-way of the farthest drawing-room, a
light-grey figure against the black and white flagging of the hall; then
he began to move toward her down the empty pale-panelled vista, crossing
one after another the long reflections which a projecting cabinet or
screen cast here and there upon the shining floors.

As he drew nearer, his figure was suddenly displaced by that of her
husband, whom, from the same point, she had so often seen advancing down
the same perspective. Straight, spare, erect, looking to right and left
with quick precise turns of the head, and stopping now and then to
straighten a chair or alter the position of a vase, Fraser Leath used to
march toward her through the double file of furniture like a general
reviewing a regiment drawn up for his inspection. At a certain point,
midway across the second room, he always stopped before the mantel-piece
of pinkish-yellow marble and looked at himself in the tall garlanded glass
that surmounted it. She could not remember that he had ever found anything
to straighten or alter in his own studied attire, but she had never known
him to omit the inspection when he passed that particular mirror.

When it was over he continued more briskly on his way, and the resulting
expression of satisfaction was still on his face when he entered the oak
sitting-room to greet his wife...

The spectral projection of this little daily scene hung but for a moment
before Anna, but in that moment she had time to fling a wondering glance
across the distance between her past and present. Then the footsteps of
the present came close, and she had to drop the geraniums to give her hand
to Darrow...

âYes, let us walk down to the river.â

They had neither of them, as yet, found much to say to each other. Darrow
had arrived late on the previous afternoon, and during the evening they
had had between them Owen Leath and their own thoughts. Now they were
alone for the first time and the fact was enough in itself. Yet Anna was
intensely aware that as soon as they began to talk more intimately they
would feel that they knew each other less well.

They passed out onto the terrace and down the steps to the gravel walk
below. The delicate frosting of dew gave the grass a bluish shimmer, and
the sunlight, sliding in emerald streaks along the tree-boles, gathered
itself into great luminous blurs at the end of the wood-walks, and hung
above the fields a watery glory like the ring about an autumn moon.

âItâs good to be here,â Darrow said.

They took a turn to the left and stopped for a moment to look back at the
long pink house-front, plainer, friendlier, less adorned than on the side
toward the court. So prolonged yet delicate had been the friction of time
upon its bricks that certain expanses had the bloom and texture of old red
velvet, and the patches of gold lichen spreading over them looked like the
last traces of a dim embroidery. The dome of the chapel, with its gilded
cross, rose above one wing, and the other ended in a conical pigeon-house,
above which the birds were flying, lustrous and slatey, their breasts
merged in the blue of the roof when they dropped down on it.

âAnd this is where youâve been all these years.â

They turned away and began to walk down a long tunnel of yellowing trees.
Benches with mossy feet stood against the mossy edges of the path, and at
its farther end it widened into a circle about a basin rimmed with stone,
in which the opaque water strewn with leaves looked like a slab of
gold-flecked agate. The path, growing narrower, wound on circuitously
through the woods, between slender serried trunks twined with ivy. Patches
of blue appeared above them through the dwindling leaves, and presently
the trees drew back and showed the open fields along the river.

They walked on across the fields to the tow-path. In a curve of the wall
some steps led up to a crumbling pavilion with openings choked with ivy.
Anna and Darrow seated themselves on the bench projecting from the inner
wall of the pavilion and looked across the river at the slopes divided
into blocks of green and fawn-colour, and at the chalk-tinted village
lifting its squat church-tower and grey roofs against the precisely drawn
lines of the landscape. Anna sat silent, so intensely aware of Darrowâs
nearness that there was no surprise in the touch he laid on her hand. They
looked at each other, and he smiled and said: âThere are to be no more
obstacles now.â

âObstacles?â The word startled her. âWhat obstacles?â

âDonât you remember the wording of the telegram that turned me back last
May? âUnforeseen obstacleâ: that was it. What was the earth-shaking
problem, by the way? Finding a governess for Effie, wasnât it?â

âBut I gave you my reason: the reason why it was an obstacle. I wrote you
fully about it.â

âYes, I know you did.â He lifted her hand and kissed it. âHow far off it
all seems, and how little it all matters today!â

She looked at him quickly. âDo you feel that? I suppose Iâm different. I
want to draw all those wasted months into today—to make them a part
of it.â

âBut they are, to me. You reach back and take everything—back to the
first days of all.â

She frowned a little, as if struggling with an inarticulate perplexity.
âItâs curious how, in those first days, too, something that I didnât
understand came between us.â

âOh, in those days we neither of us understood, did we? Itâs part of
whatâs called the bliss of being young.â

âYes, I thought that, too: thought it, I mean, in looking back. But it
couldnât, even then, have been as true of you as of me; and now——â

âNow,â he said, âthe only thing that matters is that weâre sitting here
together.â

He dismissed the rest with a lightness that might have seemed conclusive
evidence of her power over him. But she took no pride in such triumphs. It
seemed to her that she wanted his allegiance and his adoration not so much
for herself as for their mutual love, and that in treating lightly any
past phase of their relation he took something from its present beauty.
The colour rose to her face.

âBetween you and me everything matters.â

âOf course!â She felt the unperceiving sweetness of his smile. âThatâs
why,â he went on, ââeverything,â for me, is here and now: on this bench,
between you and me.â

She caught at the phrase. âThatâs what I meant: itâs here and now; we
canât get away from it.â

âGet away from it? Do you want to?
again
?â

Her heart was beating unsteadily. Something in her, fitfully and with
reluctance, struggled to free itself, but the warmth of his nearness
penetrated every sense as the sunlight steeped the landscape. Then,
suddenly, she felt that she wanted no less than the whole of her
happiness.

ââAgainâ? But wasnât it
you
, the last time——?â

She paused, the tremor in her of Psyche holding up the lamp. But in the
interrogative light of her pause her companionâs features underwent no
change.

âThe last time? Last spring? But it was you who—for the best of
reasons, as youâve told me—turned me back from your very door last
spring!â

She saw that he was good-humouredly ready to âthresh out,â for her
sentimental satisfaction, a question which, for his own, Time had so
conclusively dealt with; and the sense of his readiness reassured her.

âI wrote as soon as I could,â she rejoined. âI explained the delay and
asked you to come. And you never even answered my letter.â

âIt was impossible to come then. I had to go back to my post.â

âAnd impossible to write and tell me so?â

âYour letter was a long time coming. I had waited a week—ten days. I
had some excuse for thinking, when it came, that you were in no great
hurry for an answer.â

âYou thought that—really—after reading it?â

âI thought it.â

Her heart leaped up to her throat. âThen why are you here today?â

He turned on her with a quick look of wonder. âGod knows—if you can
ask me that!â

âYou see I was right to say I didnât understand.â

He stood up abruptly and stood facing her, blocking the view over the
river and the checkered slopes. âPerhaps I might say so too.â

âNo, no: we must neither of us have any reason for saying it again.â She
looked at him gravely. âSurely you and I neednât arrange the lights before
we show ourselves to each other. I want you to see me just as I am, with
all my irrational doubts and scruples; the old ones and the new ones too.â

He came back to his seat beside her. âNever mind the old ones. They were
justified—Iâm willing to admit it. With the governess having
suddenly to be packed off, and Effie on your hands, and your mother-in-law
ill, I see the impossibility of your letting me come. I even see that, at
the moment, it was difficult to write and explain. But what does all that
matter now? The new scruples are the ones I want to tackle.â

Again her heart trembled. She felt her happiness so near, so sure, that to
strain it closer might be like a childâs crushing a pet bird in its
caress. But her very security urged her on. For so long her doubts had
been knife-edged: now they had turned into bright harmless toys that she
could toss and catch without peril!

âYou didnât come, and you didnât answer my letter; and after waiting four
months I wrote another.â âAnd I answered that one; and Iâm here.â

âYes.â She held his eyes. âBut in my last letter I repeated exactly what
Iâd said in the first—the one I wrote you last June. I told you then
that I was ready to give you the answer to what youâd asked me in London;
and in telling you that, I told you what the answer was.â

âMy dearest! My dearest!â Darrow murmured.

âYou ignored that letter. All summer you made no sign. And all I ask now
is, that you should frankly tell me why.â

âI can only repeat what Iâve just said. I was hurt and unhappy and I
doubted you. I suppose if Iâd cared less I should have been more
confident. I cared so much that I couldnât risk another failure. For youâd
made me feel that Iâd miserably failed. So I shut my eyes and set my teeth
and turned my back. Thereâs the whole pusillanimous truth of it!â

âOh, if itâs the
whole
truth!——â She let him clasp her.
âThereâs my torment, you see. I thought that was what your silence meant
till I made you break it. Now I want to be sure that I was right.â

âWhat can I tell you to make you sure?â

âYou can let me tell
you
everything first.â She drew away, but without
taking her hands from him. âOwen saw you in Paris,â she began.

She looked at him and he faced her steadily. The light was full on his
pleasantly-browned face, his grey eyes, his frank white forehead. She
noticed for the first time a seal-ring in a setting of twisted silver on
the hand he had kept on hers.

âIn Paris? Oh, yes.... So he did.â

âHe came back and told me. I think you talked to him a moment in a
theatre. I asked if youâd spoken of my having put you off—or if
youâd sent me any message. He didnât remember that you had.â

âIn a crush—in a Paris foyer? My dear!â

âIt was absurd of me! But Owen and I have always been on odd kind of
brother-and-sister terms. I think he guessed about us when he saw you with
me in London. So he teased me a little and tried to make me curious about
you; and when he saw heâd succeeded he told me he hadnât had time to say
much to you because you were in such a hurry to get back to the lady you
were with.â

He still held her hands, but she felt no tremor in his, and the blood did
not stir in his brown cheek. He seemed to be honestly turning over his
memories. âYes: and what else did he tell you?â

âOh, not much, except that she was awfully pretty. When I asked him to
describe her he said you had her tucked away in a
baignoire
and he hadnât
actually seen her; but he saw the tail of her cloak, and somehow knew from
that that she was pretty. One
does
, you know.... I think he said the cloak
was pink.â

Darrow broke into a laugh. âOf course it was—they always are! So
that was at the bottom of your doubts?â

âNot at first. I only laughed. But afterward, when I wrote you and you
didnât answer——Oh, you
do
see?â she appealed to him.

He was looking at her gently. âYes: I see.â

âItâs not as if this were a light thing between us. I want you to know me
as I am. If I thought that at that moment ... when you were on your way
here, almost——â

He dropped her hand and stood up. âYes, yes—I understand.â

âBut do you?â Her look followed him. âIâm not a goose of a girl. I
know ... of course I
know
...but there are things a woman feels ... when what
she knows doesnât make any difference. Itâs not that I want you to explain—I
mean about that particular evening. Itâs only that I want you to have the
whole of my feeling. I didnât know what it was till I saw you again. I
never dreamed I should say such things to you!â

âI never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them!â He turned back
and lifting a floating end of her scarf put his lips to it. âBut now that
you have, I know—I know,â he smiled down at her.

âYou know?â

âThat this is no light thing between us. Now you may ask me anything you
please! That was all I wanted to ask
you
.â

For a long moment they looked at each other without speaking. She saw the
dancing spirit in his eyes turn grave and darken to a passionate
sternness. He stooped and kissed her, and she sat as if folded in wings.

XII

It was in the natural order of things that, on the way back to the house,
their talk should have turned to the future.

Anna was not eager to define it. She had an extraordinary sensitiveness to
the impalpable elements of happiness, and as she walked at Darrowâs side
her imagination flew back and forth, spinning luminous webs of feeling
between herself and the scene about her. Every heightening of emotion
produced for her a new effusion of beauty in visible things, and with it
the sense that such moments should be lingered over and absorbed like some
unrenewable miracle. She understood Darrowâs impatience to see their plans
take shape. She knew it must be so, she would not have had it otherwise;
but to reach a point where she could fix her mind on his appeal for dates
and decisions was like trying to break her way through the silver tangle
of an April wood.

Darrow wished to use his diplomatic opportunities as a means of studying
certain economic and social problems with which he presently hoped to deal
in print; and with this in view he had asked for, and obtained, a South
American appointment. Anna was ready to follow where he led, and not
reluctant to put new sights as well as new thoughts between herself and
her past. She had, in a direct way, only Effie and Effieâs education to
consider; and there seemed, after due reflection, no reason why the most
anxious regard for these should not be conciliated with the demands of
Darrowâs career. Effie, it was evident, could be left to Madame de
Chantelleâs care till the couple should have organized their life; and she
might even, as long as her future step-fatherâs work retained him in
distant posts, continue to divide her year between Givre and the
antipodes.

As for Owen, who had reached his legal majority two years before, and was
soon to attain the age fixed for the taking over of his paternal
inheritance, the arrival of this date would reduce his step-motherâs
responsibility to a friendly concern for his welfare. This made for the
prompt realization of Darrowâs wishes, and there seemed no reason why the
marriage should not take place within the six weeks that remained of his
leave.

They passed out of the wood-walk into the open brightness of the garden.
The noon sunlight sheeted with gold the bronze flanks of the polygonal
yews. Chrysanthemums, russet, saffron and orange, glowed like the
efflorescence of an enchanted forest; belts of red begonia purpling to
wine-colour ran like smouldering flame among the borders; and above this
outspread tapestry the house extended its harmonious length, the soberness
of its lines softened to grace in the luminous misty air.

Darrow stood still, and Anna felt that his glance was travelling from her
to the scene about them and then back to her face.

âYouâre sure youâre prepared to give up Givre? You look so made for each
other!â

âOh, Givre——â She broke off suddenly, feeling as if her too
careless tone had delivered all her past into his hands; and with one of
her instinctive movements of recoil she added: âWhen Owen marries I shall
have to give it up.â

âWhen Owen marries? Thatâs looking some distance ahead! I want to be told
that meanwhile youâll have no regrets.â

She hesitated. Why did he press her to uncover to him her poor starved
past? A vague feeling of loyalty, a desire to spare what could no longer
harm her, made her answer evasively: âThere will probably be no
âmeanwhile.â Owen may marry before long.â

She had not meant to touch on the subject, for her step-son had sworn her
to provisional secrecy; but since the shortness of Darrowâs leave
necessitated a prompt adjustment of their own plans, it was, after all,
inevitable that she should give him at least a hint of Owenâs.

âOwen marry? Why, he always seems like a faun in flannels! I hope heâs
found a dryad. There might easily be one left in these blue-and-gold
woods.â

âI canât tell you yet where he found his dryad, but she
is
one, I believe:
at any rate sheâll become the Givre woods better than I do. Only there may
be difficulties——â

âWell! At that age theyâre not always to be wished away.â

She hesitated. âOwen, at any rate, has made up his mind to overcome them;
and Iâve promised to see him through.â

She went on, after a momentâs consideration, to explain that her
step-sonâs choice was, for various reasons, not likely to commend itself
to his grandmother. âShe must be prepared for it, and Iâve promised to do
the preparing. You know I always
have
seen him through things, and he
rather counts on me now.â

She fancied that Darrowâs exclamation had in it a faint note of annoyance,
and wondered if he again suspected her of seeking a pretext for
postponement.

âBut once Owenâs future is settled, you wonât, surely, for the sake of
what you call seeing him through, ask that I should go away again without
you?â He drew her closer as they walked. âOwen will understand, if you
donât. Since heâs in the same case himself Iâll throw myself on his mercy.
Heâll see that I have the first claim on you; he wonât even want you not
to see it.â

âOwen sees everything: Iâm not afraid of that. But his future isnât
settled. Heâs very young to marry—too young, his grandmother is sure
to think—and the marriage he wants to make is not likely to convince
her to the contrary.â

âYou donât mean that itâs like his first choice?â

âOh, no! But itâs not what Madame de Chantelle would call a good match;
itâs not even what I call a wise one.â

âYet youâre backing him up?â

âYet Iâm backing him up.â She paused. âI wonder if youâll understand? What
Iâve most wanted for him, and shall want for Effie, is that they shall
always feel free to make their own mistakes, and never, if possible, be
persuaded to make other peopleâs. Even if Owenâs marriage is a mistake,
and has to be paid for, I believe heâll learn and grow in the paying. Of
course I canât make Madame de Chantelle see this; but I can remind her
that, with his character—his big rushes of impulse, his odd
intervals of ebb and apathy—she may drive him into some worse
blunder if she thwarts him now.â

âAnd you mean to break the news to her as soon as she comes back from
Ouchy?â

âAs soon as I see my way to it. She knows the girl and likes her: thatâs
our hope. And yet it may, in the end, prove our danger, make it harder for
us all, when she learns the truth, than if Owen had chosen a stranger. I
canât tell you more till Iâve told her: Iâve promised Owen not to tell any
one. All I ask you is to give me time, to give me a few days at any rate
Sheâs been wonderfully ânice,â as she would call it, about you, and about
the fact of my having soon to leave Givre; but that, again, may make it
harder for Owen. At any rate, you can see, canât you, how it makes me want
to stand by him? You see, I couldnât bear it if the least fraction of my
happiness seemed to be stolen from his—as if it were a little scrap
of happiness that had to be pieced out with other peopleâs!â She clasped
her hands on Darrowâs arm. âI want our life to be like a house with all
the windows lit: Iâd like to string lanterns from the roof and chimneys!â

She ended with an inward tremor. All through her exposition and her appeal
she had told herself that the moment could hardly have been less well
chosen. In Darrowâs place she would have felt, as he doubtless did, that
her carefully developed argument was only the disguise of an habitual
indecision. It was the hour of all others when she would have liked to
affirm herself by brushing aside every obstacle to his wishes; yet it was
only by opposing them that she could show the strength of character she
wanted him to feel in her.

But as she talked she began to see that Darrowâs face gave back no
reflection of her words, that he continued to wear the abstracted look of
a man who is not listening to what is said to him. It caused her a slight
pang to discover that his thoughts could wander at such a moment; then,
with a flush of joy she perceived the reason.

In some undefinable way she had become aware, without turning her head,
that he was steeped in the sense of her nearness, absorbed in
contemplating the details of her face and dress; and the discovery made
the words throng to her lips. She felt herself speak with ease, authority,
conviction. She said to herself: âHe doesnât care what I say—itâs
enough that I say it—even if itâs stupid heâll like me better for
it...â She knew that every inflexion of her voice, every gesture, every
characteristic of her person—its very defects, the fact that her
forehead was too high, that her eyes were not large enough, that her
hands, though slender, were not small, and that the fingers did not taper—she
knew that these deficiencies were so many channels through which her
influence streamed to him; that she pleased him in spite of them, perhaps
because of them; that he wanted her as she was, and not as she would have
liked to be; and for the first time she felt in her veins the security and
lightness of happy love.

They reached the court and walked under the limes toward the house. The
hall door stood wide, and through the windows opening on the terrace the
sun slanted across the black and white floor, the faded tapestry chairs,
and Darrowâs travelling coat and cap, which lay among the cloaks and rugs
piled on a bench against the wall.

The sight of these garments, lying among her own wraps, gave her a sense
of homely intimacy. It was as if her happiness came down from the skies
and took on the plain dress of daily things. At last she seemed to hold it
in her hand.

As they entered the hall her eye lit on an unstamped note conspicuously
placed on the table.

âFrom Owen! He must have rushed off somewhere in the motor.â

She felt a secret stir of pleasure at the immediate inference that she and
Darrow would probably lunch alone. Then she opened the note and stared at
it in wonder.

âDear,â Owen wrote, âafter what you said yesterday I canât wait another
hour, and Iâm off to Francheuil, to catch the Dijon express and travel
back with them. Donât be frightened; I wonât speak unless itâs safe to.
Trust me for that—but I had to go.â

She looked up slowly.

âHeâs gone to Dijon to meet his grandmother. Oh, I hope I havenât made a
mistake!â

âYou? Why, what have you to do with his going to Dijon?â

She hesitated. âThe day before yesterday I told him, for the first time,
that I meant to see him through, no matter what happened. And Iâm afraid
heâs lost his head, and will be imprudent and spoil things. You see, I
hadnât meant to say a word to him till Iâd had time to prepare Madame de
Chantelle.â

She felt that Darrow was looking at her and reading her thoughts, and the
colour flew to her face. âYes: it was when I heard you were coming that I
told him. I wanted him to feel as I felt ... it seemed too unkind to make
him wait!â Her hand was in his, and his arm rested for a moment on her
shoulder.

âIt
would
have been too unkind to make him wait.â

They moved side by side toward the stairs. Through the haze of bliss
enveloping her, Owenâs affairs seemed curiously unimportant and remote.
Nothing really mattered but this torrent of light in her veins. She put
her foot on the lowest step, saying: âItâs nearly luncheon time—I
must take off my hat...â and as she started up the stairs Darrow stood
below in the hall and watched her. But the distance between them did not
make him seem less near: it was as if his thoughts moved with her and
touched her like endearing hands.

In her bedroom she shut the door and stood still, looking about her in a
fit of dreamy wonder. Her feelings were unlike any she had ever known:
richer, deeper, more complete. For the first time everything in her, from
head to foot, seemed to be feeding the same full current of sensation.

She took off her hat and went to the dressing-table to smooth her hair.
The pressure of the hat had flattened the dark strands on her forehead;
her face was paler than usual, with shadows about the eyes. She felt a
pang of regret for the wasted years. âIf I look like this today,â she said
to herself, âwhat will he think of me when Iâm ill or worried?â She began
to run her fingers through her hair, rejoicing in its thickness; then she
desisted and sat still, resting her chin on her hands.

âI want him to see me as I am,â she thought.

Deeper than the deepest fibre of her vanity was the triumphant sense that

as she was
, with her flattened hair, her tired pallor, her thin sleeves a
little tumbled by the weight of her jacket, he would like her even better,
feel her nearer, dearer, more desirable, than in all the splendours she
might put on for him. In the light of this discovery she studied her face
with a new intentness, seeing its defects as she had never seen them, yet
seeing them through a kind of radiance, as though love were a luminous
medium into which she had been bodily plunged.

She was glad now that she had confessed her doubts and her jealousy. She
divined that a man in love may be flattered by such involuntary betrayals,
that there are moments when respect for his liberty appeals to him less
than the inability to respect it: moments so propitious that a womanâs
very mistakes and indiscretions may help to establish her dominion. The
sense of power she had been aware of in talking to Darrow came back with
ten-fold force. She felt like testing him by the most fantastic exactions,
and at the same moment she longed to humble herself before him, to make
herself the shadow and echo of his mood. She wanted to linger with him in
a world of fancy and yet to walk at his side in the world of fact. She
wanted him to feel her power and yet to love her for her ignorance and
humility. She felt like a slave, and a goddess, and a girl in her teens...

XIII

Darrow, late that evening, threw himself into an armchair before his fire
and mused.

The room was propitious to meditation. The red-veiled lamp, the corners of
shadow, the splashes of firelight on the curves of old full-bodied
wardrobes and cabinets, gave it an air of intimacy increased by its faded
hangings, its slightly frayed and threadbare rugs. Everything in it was
harmoniously shabby, with a subtle sought-for shabbiness in which Darrow
fancied he discerned the touch of Fraser Leath. But Fraser Leath had grown
so unimportant a factor in the scheme of things that these marks of his
presence caused the young man no emotion beyond that of a faint
retrospective amusement.

The afternoon and evening had been perfect.

After a moment of concern over her step-sonâs departure, Anna had
surrendered herself to her happiness with an impetuosity that Darrow had
never suspected in her. Early in the afternoon they had gone out in the
motor, traversing miles of sober-tinted landscape in which, here and
there, a scarlet vineyard flamed, clattering through the streets of stony
villages, coming out on low slopes above the river, or winding through the
pale gold of narrow wood-roads with the blue of clear-cut hills at their
end. Over everything lay a faint sunshine that seemed dissolved in the
still air, and the smell of wet roots and decaying leaves was merged in
the pungent scent of burning underbrush. Once, at the turn of a wall, they
stopped the motor before a ruined gateway and, stumbling along a road full
of ruts, stood before a little old deserted house, fantastically carved
and chimneyed, which lay in a moat under the shade of ancient trees. They
paced the paths between the trees, found a mouldy Temple of Love on an
islet among reeds and plantains, and, sitting on a bench in the
stable-yard, watched the pigeons circling against the sunset over their
cot of patterned brick. Then the motor flew on into the dusk...

When they came in they sat beside the fire in the oak drawing-room, and
Darrow noticed how delicately her head stood out against the sombre
panelling, and mused on the enjoyment there would always be in the mere
fact of watching her hands as they moved about among the tea-things...

They dined late, and facing her across the table, with its low lights and
flowers, he felt an extraordinary pleasure in seeing her again in evening
dress, and in letting his eyes dwell on the proud shy set of her head, the
way her dark hair clasped it, and the girlish thinness of her neck above
the slight swell of the breast. His imagination was struck by the quality
of reticence in her beauty. She suggested a fine portrait kept down to a
few tones, or a Greek vase on which the play of light is the only pattern.

After dinner they went out on the terrace for a look at the moon-misted
park. Through the crepuscular whiteness the trees hung in blotted masses.
Below the terrace, the garden drew its dark diagrams between statues that
stood like muffled conspirators on the edge of the shadow. Farther off,
the meadows unrolled a silver-shot tissue to the mantling of mist above
the river; and the autumn stars trembled overhead like their own
reflections seen in dim water.

He lit his cigar, and they walked slowly up and down the flags in the
languid air, till he put an arm about her, saying: âYou mustnât stay till
youâre chilledâ; then they went back into the room and drew up their
chairs to the fire.

It seemed only a moment later that she said: âIt must be after eleven,â
and stood up and looked down on him, smiling faintly. He sat still,
absorbing the look, and thinking: âThereâll be evenings and eveningsâ—till
she came nearer, bent over him, and with a hand on his shoulder said:
âGood night.â

He got to his feet and put his arms about her.

âGood night,â he answered, and held her fast; and they gave each other a
long kiss of promise and communion.

The memory of it glowed in him still as he sat over his crumbling fire;
but beneath his physical exultation he felt a certain gravity of mood. His
happiness was in some sort the rallying-point of many scattered purposes.
He summed it up vaguely by saying to himself that to be loved by a woman
like that made âall the differenceâ...He was a little tired of
experimenting on life; he wanted to âtake a lineâ, to follow things up, to
centralize and concentrate, and produce results. Two or three more years
of diplomacy—with her beside him!—and then their real life
would begin: study, travel and book-making for him, and for her—well,
the joy, at any rate, of getting out of an atmosphere of bric-a-brac and
card-leaving into the open air of competing activities.

The desire for change had for some time been latent in him, and his
meeting with Mrs. Leath the previous spring had given it a definite
direction. With such a comrade to focus and stimulate his energies he felt
modestly but agreeably sure of âdoing somethingâ. And under this assurance
was the lurking sense that he was somehow worthy of his opportunity. His
life, on the whole, had been a creditable affair. Out of modest chances
and middling talents he had built himself a fairly marked personality,
known some exceptional people, done a number of interesting and a few
rather difficult things, and found himself, at thirty-seven, possessed of
an intellectual ambition sufficient to occupy the passage to a robust and
energetic old age. As for the private and personal side of his life, it
had come up to the current standards, and if it had dropped, now and then,
below a more ideal measure, even these declines had been brief,
parenthetic, incidental. In the recognized essentials he had always
remained strictly within the limit of his scruples.

From this reassuring survey of his case he came back to the contemplation
of its crowning felicity. His mind turned again to his first meeting with
Anna Summers and took up one by one the threads of their faintly sketched
romance. He dwelt with pardonable pride on the fact that fate had so early
marked him for the high privilege of possessing her: it seemed to mean
that they had really, in the truest sense of the ill-used phrase, been
made for each other.

Deeper still than all these satisfactions was the mere elemental sense of
well-being in her presence. That, after all, was what proved her to be the
woman for him: the pleasure he took in the set of her head, the way her
hair grew on her forehead and at the nape, her steady gaze when he spoke,
the grave freedom of her gait and gestures. He recalled every detail of
her face, the fine veinings of the temples, the bluish-brown shadows in
her upper lids, and the way the reflections of two stars seemed to form
and break up in her eyes when he held her close to him...

If he had had any doubt as to the nature of her feeling for him those
dissolving stars would have allayed it. She was reserved, she was shy
even, was what the shallow and effusive would call âcoldâ. She was like a
picture so hung that it can be seen only at a certain angle: an angle
known to no one but its possessor. The thought flattered his sense of
possessorship.... He felt that the smile on his lips would have been fatuous
had it had a witness. He was thinking of her look when she had questioned
him about his meeting with Owen at the theatre: less of her words than of
her look, and of the effort the question cost her: the reddening of her
cheek, the deepening of the strained line between her brows, the way her
eyes sought shelter and then turned and drew on him. Pride and passion
were in the conflict—magnificent qualities in a wife! The sight
almost made up for his momentary embarrassment at the rousing of a memory
which had no place in his present picture of himself.

Yes! It was worth a good deal to watch that fight between her instinct and
her intelligence, and know oneâs self the object of the struggle...

Mingled with these sensations were considerations of another order. He
reflected with satisfaction that she was the kind of woman with whom one
would like to be seen in public. It would be distinctly agreeable to
follow her into drawing-rooms, to walk after her down the aisle of a
theatre, to get in and out of trains with her, to say âmy wifeâ of her to
all sorts of people. He draped these details in the handsome phrase âSheâs
a woman to be proud ofâ, and felt that this fact somehow justified and
ennobled his instinctive boyish satisfaction in loving her.

He stood up, rambled across the room and leaned out for a while into the
starry night. Then he dropped again into his armchair with a sigh of deep
content.

âOh, hang it,â he suddenly exclaimed, âitâs the best thing thatâs ever
happened to me, anyhow!â

The next day was even better. He felt, and knew she felt, that they had
reached a clearer understanding of each other. It was as if, after a swim
through bright opposing waves, with a dazzle of sun in their eyes, they
had gained an inlet in the shades of a cliff, where they could float on
the still surface and gaze far down into the depths.

Now and then, as they walked and talked, he felt a thrill of youthful
wonder at the coincidence of their views and their experiences, at the way
their minds leapt to the same point in the same instant.

âThe old delusion, I suppose,â he smiled to himself. âWill Nature never
tire of the trick?â

But he knew it was more than that. There were moments in their talk when
he felt, distinctly and unmistakably, the solid ground of friendship
underneath the whirling dance of his sensations. âHow I should like her if
I didnât love her!â he summed it up, wondering at the miracle of such a
union.

In the course of the morning a telegram had come from Owen Leath,
announcing that he, his grandmother and Effie would arrive from Dijon that
afternoon at four. The station of the main line was eight or ten miles
from Givre, and Anna, soon after three, left in the motor to meet the
travellers.

When she had gone Darrow started for a walk, planning to get back late, in
order that the reunited family might have the end of the afternoon to
themselves. He roamed the country-side till long after dark, and the
stable-clock of Givre was striking seven as he walked up the avenue to the
court.

In the hall, coming down the stairs, he encountered Anna. Her face was
serene, and his first glance showed him that Owen had kept his word and
that none of her forebodings had been fulfilled.

She had just come down from the school-room, where Effie and the governess
were having supper; the little girl, she told him, looked immensely better
for her Swiss holiday, but was dropping with sleep after the journey, and
too tired to make her habitual appearance in the drawing-room before being
put to bed. Madame de Chantelle was resting, but would be down for dinner;
and as for Owen, Anna supposed he was off somewhere in the park—he
had a passion for prowling about the park at nightfall...

Darrow followed her into the brown room, where the tea-table had been left
for him. He declined her offer of tea, but she lingered a moment to tell
him that Owen had in fact kept his word, and that Madame de Chantelle had
come back in the best of humours, and unsuspicious of the blow about to
fall.

âShe has enjoyed her month at Ouchy, and it has given her a lot to talk
about—her symptoms, and the rival doctors, and the people at the
hotel. It seems she met your Ambassadress there, and Lady Wantley, and
some other London friends of yours, and sheâs heard what she calls
âdelightful thingsâ about you: she told me to tell you so. She attaches
great importance to the fact that your grandmother was an Everard of
Albany. Sheâs prepared to open her arms to you. I donât know whether it
wonât make it harder for poor Owen ... the contrast, I mean.... There are no
Ambassadresses or Everards to vouch for
his
choice! But youâll help me,
wonât you? Youâll help me to help him? To-morrow Iâll tell you the rest.
Now I must rush up and tuck in Effie...â

âOh, youâll see, weâll pull it off for him!â he assured her; âtogether, we
canât fail to pull it off.â

He stood and watched her with a smile as she fled down the half-lit vista
to the hall.

XIV

If Darrow, on entering the drawing-room before dinner, examined its new
occupant with unusual interest, it was more on Owen Leathâs account than
his own.

Annaâs hints had roused his interest in the ladâs love affair, and he
wondered what manner of girl the heroine of the coming conflict might be.
He had guessed that Owenâs rebellion symbolized for his step-mother her
own long struggle against the Leath conventions, and he understood that if
Anna so passionately abetted him it was partly because, as she owned, she
wanted his liberation to coincide with hers.

The lady who was to represent, in the impending struggle, the forces of
order and tradition was seated by the fire when Darrow entered. Among the
flowers and old furniture of the large pale-panelled room, Madame de
Chantelle had the inanimate elegance of a figure introduced into a
âstill-lifeâ to give the scale. And this, Darrow reflected, was exactly
what she doubtless regarded as her chief obligation: he was sure she
thought a great deal of âmeasureâ, and approved of most things only up to
a certain point. She was a woman of sixty, with a figure at once young and
old-fashioned. Her fair faded tints, her quaint corseting, the
passementerie on her tight-waisted dress, the velvet band on her tapering
arm, made her resemble a âcarte de visiteâ photograph of the middle
âsixties. One saw her, younger but no less invincibly lady-like, leaning on
a chair with a fringed back, a curl in her neck, a locket on her tuckered
bosom, toward the end of an embossed morocco album beginning with The
Beauties of the Second Empire.

She received her daughter-in-lawâs suitor with an affability which implied
her knowledge and approval of his suit. Darrow had already guessed her to
be a person who would instinctively oppose any suggested changes, and
then, after one had exhausted oneâs main arguments, unexpectedly yield to
some small incidental reason, and adhere doggedly to her new position. She
boasted of her old-fashioned prejudices, talked a good deal of being a
grandmother, and made a show of reaching up to tap Owenâs shoulder, though
his height was little more than hers.

She was full of a small pale prattle about the people she had seen at
Ouchy, as to whom she had the minute statistical information of a
gazetteer, without any apparent sense of personal differences. She said to
Darrow: âThey tell me things are very much changed in America.... Of course
in my youth there
was
a Societyâ...She had no desire to return there she
was sure the standards must be so different. âThere are charming people
everywhere ... and one must always look on the best side ... but when one has
lived among Traditions itâs difficult to adapt oneâs self to the new
ideas.... These dreadful views of marriage ... itâs so hard to explain them to
my French relations.... Iâm thankful to say I donât pretend to understand
them myself! But
youâre
an Everard—I told Anna last spring in London
that one sees that instantlyâ...

She wandered off to the cooking and the service of the hotel at Ouchy. She
attached great importance to gastronomic details and to the manners of
hotel servants. There, too, there was a falling off, she said. âI don t
know, of course; but people say itâs owing to the Americans. Certainly my
waiter had a way of slapping down the dishes ... they tell me that many of
them are Anarchists ... belong to Unions, you know.â She appealed to
Darrowâs reported knowledge of economic conditions to confirm this ominous
rumour.

After dinner Owen Leath wandered into the next room, where the piano
stood, and began to play among the shadows. His step-mother presently
joined him, and Darrow sat alone with Madame de Chantelle.

She took up the thread of her mild chat and carried it on at the same pace
as her knitting. Her conversation resembled the large loose-stranded web
between her fingers: now and then she dropped a stitch, and went on
regardless of the gap in the pattern.

Darrow listened with a lazy sense of well-being. In the mental lull of the
after-dinner hour, with harmonious memories murmuring through his mind,
and the soft tints and shadowy spaces of the fine old room charming his
eyes to indolence, Madame de Chantelleâs discourse seemed not out of
place. He could understand that, in the long run, the atmosphere of Givre
might be suffocating; but in his present mood its very limitations had a
grace.

Presently he found the chance to say a word in his own behalf; and
thereupon measured the advantage, never before particularly apparent to
him, of being related to the Everards of Albany. Madame de Chantelleâs
conception of her native country—to which she had not returned since
her twentieth year—reminded him of an ancient geographerâs map of
the Hyperborean regions. It was all a foggy blank, from which only one or
two fixed outlines emerged; and one of these belonged to the Everards of
Albany.

The fact that they offered such firm footing—formed, so to speak, a
friendly territory on which the opposing powers could meet and treat—helped
him through the task of explaining and justifying himself as the successor
of Fraser Leath. Madame de Chantelle could not resist such incontestable
claims. She seemed to feel her sonâs hovering and discriminating presence,
and she gave Darrow the sense that he was being tested and approved as a
last addition to the Leath Collection.

She also made him aware of the immense advantage he possessed in belonging
to the diplomatic profession. She spoke of this humdrum calling as a
Career, and gave Darrow to understand that she supposed him to have been
seducing Duchesses when he was not negotiating Treaties. He heard again
quaint phrases which romantic old ladies had used in his youth: âBrilliant
diplomatic society ... social advantages ... the entree everywhere ... nothing
else
forms
a young man in the same way...â and she sighingly added that
she could have wished her grandson had chosen the same path to glory.

Darrow prudently suppressed his own view of the profession, as well as the
fact that he had adopted it provisionally, and for reasons less social
than sociological; and the talk presently passed on to the subject of his
future plans.

Here again, Madame de Chantelleâs awe of the Career made her admit the
necessity of Annaâs consenting to an early marriage. The fact that Darrow
was âorderedâ to South America seemed to put him in the romantic light of
a young soldier charged to lead a forlorn hope: she sighed and said: âAt
such moments a wifeâs duty is at her husbandâs side.â

The problem of Effieâs future might have disturbed her, she added; but
since Anna, for a time, consented to leave the little girl with her, that
problem was at any rate deferred. She spoke plaintively of the
responsibility of looking after her granddaughter, but Darrow divined that
she enjoyed the flavour of the word more than she felt the weight of the
fact.

âEffieâs a perfect child. Sheâs more like my son, perhaps, than dear Owen.
Sheâll never intentionally give me the least trouble. But of course the
responsibility will be great.... Iâm not sure I should dare to undertake it
if it were not for her having such a treasure of a governess. Has Anna
told you about our little governess? After all the worry we had last year,
with one impossible creature after another, it seems providential, just
now, to have found her. At first we were afraid she was too young; but now
weâve the greatest confidence in her. So clever and amusing—and
such

a lady! I donât say her educationâs all it might be ... no drawing or
singing ... but one canât have everything; and she speaks Italian...â

Madame de Chantelleâs fond insistence on the likeness between Effie Leath
and her father, if not particularly gratifying to Darrow, had at least
increased his desire to see the little girl. It gave him an odd feeling of
discomfort to think that she should have any of the characteristics of the
late Fraser Leath: he had, somehow, fantastically pictured her as the
mystical offspring of the early tenderness between himself and Anna
Summers.

His encounter with Effie took place the next morning, on the lawn below
the terrace, where he found her, in the early sunshine, knocking about
golf balls with her brother. Almost at once, and with infinite relief, he
saw that the resemblance of which Madame de Chantelle boasted was mainly
external. Even that discovery was slightly distasteful, though Darrow was
forced to own that Fraser Leathâs straight-featured fairness had lent
itself to the production of a peculiarly finished image of childish
purity. But it was evident that other elements had also gone to the making
of Effie, and that another spirit sat in her eyes. Her serious handshake,
her âprettyâ greeting, were worthy of the Leath tradition, and he guessed
her to be more malleable than Owen, more subject to the influences of
Givre; but the shout with which she returned to her romp had in it the
note of her motherâs emancipation.

He had begged a holiday for her, and when Mrs. Leath appeared he and she
and the little girl went off for a ramble. Anna wished her daughter to
have time to make friends with Darrow before learning in what relation he
was to stand to her; and the three roamed the woods and fields till the
distant chime of the stable-clock made them turn back for luncheon.

Effie, who was attended by a shaggy terrier, had picked up two or three
subordinate dogs at the stable; and as she trotted on ahead with her
yapping escort, Anna hung back to throw a look at Darrow.

âYes,â he answered it, âsheâs exquisite.... Oh, I see what Iâm asking of
you! But sheâll be quite happy here, wonât she? And you must remember it
wonât be for long...â

Anna sighed her acquiescence. âOh, sheâll be happy here. Itâs her nature
to be happy. Sheâll apply herself to it, conscientiously, as she does to
her lessons, and to what she calls âbeing goodâ...In a way, you see,
thatâs just what worries me. Her idea of âbeing goodâ is to please the
person sheâs with—she puts her whole dear little mind on it! And so,
if ever sheâs with the wrong person——â

âBut surely thereâs no danger of that just now? Madame de Chantelle tells
me that youâve at last put your hand on a perfect governess——â

Anna, without answering, glanced away from him toward her daughter.

âItâs lucky, at any rate,â Darrow continued, âthat Madame de Chantelle
thinks her so.â

âOh, I think very highly of her too.â

âHighly enough to feel quite satisfied to leave her with Effie?â

âYes. Sheâs just the person for Effie. Only, of course, one never
knows.... Sheâs young, and she might take it into her head to leave us...â
After a pause she added: âIâm naturally anxious to know what you think of
her.â

When they entered the house the hands of the hall clock stood within a few
minutes of the luncheon hour. Anna led Effie off to have her hair smoothed
and Darrow wandered into the oak sitting-room, which he found untenanted.
The sun lay pleasantly on its brown walls, on the scattered books and the
flowers in old porcelain vases. In his eyes lingered the vision of the
dark-haired mother mounting the stairs with her little fair daughter. The
contrast between them seemed a last touch of grace in the complex harmony
of things. He stood in the window, looking out at the park, and brooding
inwardly upon his happiness...

He was roused by Effieâs voice and the scamper of her feet down the long
floors behind him.

âHere he is! Here he is!â she cried, flying over the threshold.

He turned and stooped to her with a smile, and as she caught his hand he
perceived that she was trying to draw him toward some one who had paused
behind her in the doorway, and whom he supposed to be her mother.

âHERE he is!â Effie repeated, with her sweet impatience.

The figure in the doorway came forward and Darrow, looking up, found
himself face to face with Sophy Viner. They stood still, a yard or two
apart, and looked at each other without speaking.

As they paused there, a shadow fell across one of the terrace windows, and
Owen Leath stepped whistling into the room. In his rough shooting clothes,
with the glow of exercise under his fair skin, he looked extraordinarily
light-hearted and happy. Darrow, with a quick side-glance, noticed this,
and perceived also that the glow on the youthâs cheek had deepened
suddenly to red. He too stopped short, and the three stood there
motionless for a barely perceptible beat of time. During its lapse,
Darrowâs eyes had turned back from Owenâs face to that of the girl between
them. He had the sense that, whatever was done, it was he who must do it,
and that it must be done immediately. He went forward and held out his
hand.

âHow do you do, Miss Viner?â

She answered: âHow do you do?â in a voice that sounded clear and natural;
and the next moment he again became aware of steps behind him, and knew
that Mrs. Leath was in the room.

To his strained senses there seemed to be another just measurable pause
before Anna said, looking gaily about the little group: âHas Owen
introduced you? This is Effieâs friend, Miss Viner.â

Effie, still hanging on her governessâs arm, pressed herself closer with a
little gesture of appropriation; and Miss Viner laid her hand on her
pupilâs hair.

Darrow felt that Annaâs eyes had turned to him.

âI think Miss Viner and I have met already—several years ago in
London.â

âI remember,â said Sophy Viner, in the same clear voice.

âHow charming! Then weâre all friends. But luncheon must be ready,â said
Mrs. Leath.

She turned back to the door, and the little procession moved down the two
long drawing-rooms, with Effie waltzing on ahead.

XV

Madame de Chantelle and Anna had planned, for the afternoon, a visit to a
remotely situated acquaintance whom the introduction of the motor had
transformed into a neighbour. Effie was to pay for her morningâs holiday
by an hour or two in the school-room, and Owen suggested that he and
Darrow should betake themselves to a distant covert in the desultory quest
for pheasants.

Darrow was not an ardent sportsman, but any pretext for physical activity
would have been acceptable at the moment; and he was glad both to get away
from the house and not to be left to himself.

When he came downstairs the motor was at the door, and Anna stood before
the hall mirror, swathing her hat in veils. She turned at the sound of his
step and smiled at him for a long full moment.

âIâd no idea you knew Miss Viner,â she said, as he helped her into her
long coat.

âIt came back to me, luckily, that Iâd seen her two or three times in
London, several years ago. She was secretary, or something of the sort, in
the background of a house where I used to dine.â

He loathed the slighting indifference of the phrase, but he had uttered it
deliberately, had been secretly practising it all through the interminable
hour at the luncheon-table. Now that it was spoken, he shivered at its
note of condescension. In such cases one was almost sure to overdo.... But
Anna seemed to notice nothing unusual.

âWas she really? You must tell me all about it—tell me exactly how
she struck you. Iâm so glad it turns out that you know her.â

ââKnowâ is rather exaggerated: we used to pass each other on the stairs.â

Madame de Chantelle and Owen appeared together as he spoke, and Anna,
gathering up her wraps, said: âYouâll tell me about that, then. Try and
remember everything you can.â

As he tramped through the woods at his young hostâs side, Darrow felt the
partial relief from thought produced by exercise and the obligation to
talk. Little as he cared for shooting, he had the habit of concentration
which makes it natural for a man to throw himself wholly into whatever
business he has in hand, and there were moments of the afternoon when a
sudden whirr in the undergrowth, a vivider gleam against the hazy browns
and greys of the woods, was enough to fill the foreground of his
attention. But all the while, behind these voluntarily emphasized
sensations, his secret consciousness continued to revolve on a loud wheel
of thought. For a time it seemed to be sweeping him through deep gulfs of
darkness. His sensations were too swift and swarming to be disentangled.
He had an almost physical sense of struggling for air, of battling
helplessly with material obstructions, as though the russet covert through
which he trudged were the heart of a maleficent jungle...

Snatches of his companionâs talk drifted to him intermittently through the
confusion of his thoughts. He caught eager self-revealing phrases, and
understood that Owen was saying things about himself, perhaps hinting
indirectly at the hopes for which Darrow had been prepared by Annaâs
confidences. He had already become aware that the lad liked him, and had
meant to take the first opportunity of showing that he reciprocated the
feeling. But the effort of fixing his attention on Owenâs words was so
great that it left no power for more than the briefest and most
inexpressive replies.

Young Leath, it appeared, felt that he had reached a turning-point in his
career, a height from which he could impartially survey his past progress
and projected endeavour. At one time he had had musical and literary
yearnings, visions of desultory artistic indulgence; but these had of late
been superseded by the resolute determination to plunge into practical
life.

âI donât want, you see,â Darrow heard him explaining, âto drift into what
my grandmother, poor dear, is trying to make of me: an adjunct of Givre. I
donât want—hang it all!—to slip into collecting sensations as
my father collected snuff-boxes. I want Effie to have Givre—itâs my
grandmotherâs, you know, to do as she likes with; and Iâve understood
lately that if it belonged to me it would gradually gobble me up. I want
to get out of it, into a life thatâs big and ugly and struggling. If I can
extract beauty out of
that
, so much the better: thatâll prove my vocation.
But I want to
make
beauty, not be drowned in the ready-made, like a bee in
a pot of honey.â

Darrow knew that he was being appealed to for corroboration of these views
and for encouragement in the course to which they pointed. To his own ears
his answers sounded now curt, now irrelevant: at one moment he seemed
chillingly indifferent, at another he heard himself launching out on a
flood of hazy discursiveness. He dared not look at Owen, for fear of
detecting the ladâs surprise at these senseless transitions. And through
the confusion of his inward struggles and outward loquacity he heard the
ceaseless trip-hammer beat of the question: âWhat in Godâs name shall I
do?â...

To get back to the house before Annaâs return seemed his most pressing
necessity. He did not clearly know why: he simply felt that he ought to be
there. At one moment it occurred to him that Miss Viner might want to
speak to him alone—and again, in the same flash, that it would
probably be the last thing she would want.... At any rate, he felt he ought
to try to speak to
her
; or at least be prepared to do so, if the chance
should occur...

Finally, toward four, he told his companion that he had some letters on
his mind and must get back to the house and despatch them before the
ladies returned. He left Owen with the beater and walked on to the edge of
the covert. At the park gates he struck obliquely through the trees,
following a grass avenue at the end of which he had caught a glimpse of
the roof of the chapel. A grey haze had blotted out the sun and the still
air clung about him tepidly. At length the house-front raised before him
its expanse of damp-silvered brick, and he was struck afresh by the high
decorum of its calm lines and soberly massed surfaces. It made him feel,
in the turbid coil of his fears and passions, like a muddy tramp forcing
his way into some pure sequestered shrine...

By and bye, he knew, he should have to think the complex horror out,
slowly, systematically, bit by bit; but for the moment it was whirling him
about so fast that he could just clutch at its sharp spikes and be tossed
off again. Only one definite immediate fact stuck in his quivering grasp.
He must give the girl every chance—must hold himself passive till
she had taken them...

In the court Effie ran up to him with her leaping terrier.

âI was coming out to meet you—you and Owen. Miss Viner was coming,
too, and then she couldnât because sheâs got such a headache. Iâm afraid I
gave it to her because I did my division so disgracefully. Itâs too bad,
isnât it? But wonât you walk back with me? Nurse wonât mind the least bit;
sheâd so much rather go in to tea.â

Darrow excused himself laughingly, on the plea that he had letters to
write, which was much worse than having a headache, and not infrequently
resulted in one.

âOh, then you can go and write them in Owenâs study. Thatâs where
gentlemen always write their letters.â

She flew on with her dog and Darrow pursued his way to the house. Effieâs
suggestion struck him as useful. He had pictured himself as vaguely
drifting about the drawing-rooms, and had perceived the difficulty of Miss
Vinerâs having to seek him there; but the study, a small room on the right
of the hall, was in easy sight from the staircase, and so situated that
there would be nothing marked in his being found there in talk with her.

He went in, leaving the door open, and sat down at the writing-table. The
room was a friendly heterogeneous place, the one repository, in the
well-ordered and amply-servanted house, of all its unclassified odds and
ends: Effieâs croquet-box and fishing rods, Owenâs guns and golf-sticks
and racquets, his step-motherâs flower-baskets and gardening implements,
even Madame de Chantelleâs embroidery frame, and the back numbers of the
Catholic Weekly. The early twilight had begun to fall, and presently a
slanting ray across the desk showed Darrow that a servant was coming
across the hall with a lamp. He pulled out a sheet of note-paper and began
to write at random, while the man, entering, put the lamp at his elbow and
vaguely âstraightenedâ the heap of newspapers tossed on the divan. Then
his steps died away and Darrow sat leaning his head on his locked hands.

Presently another step sounded on the stairs, wavered a moment and then
moved past the threshold of the study. Darrow got up and walked into the
hall, which was still unlighted. In the dimness he saw Sophy Viner
standing by the hall door in her hat and jacket. She stopped at sight of
him, her hand on the door-bolt, and they stood for a second without
speaking.

âHave you seen Effie?â she suddenly asked. âShe went out to meet you.â

âShe
did
meet me, just now, in the court. Sheâs gone on to join her
brother.â

Darrow spoke as naturally as he could, but his voice sounded to his own
ears like an amateur actorâs in a âlightâ part.

Miss Viner, without answering, drew back the bolt. He watched her in
silence as the door swung open; then he said: âShe has her nurse with her.
She wonât be long.â

She stood irresolute, and he added: âI was writing in there—wonât
you come and have a little talk? Every oneâs out.â

The last words struck him as not well-chosen, but there was no time to
choose. She paused a second longer and then crossed the threshold of the
study. At luncheon she had sat with her back to the window, and beyond
noting that she had grown a little thinner, and had less colour and
vivacity, he had seen no change in her; but now, as the lamplight fell on
her face, its whiteness startled him.

âPoor thing ... poor thing ... what in heavenâs name can she suppose?â he
wondered.

âDo sit down—I want to talk to you,â he said and pushed a chair
toward her.

She did not seem to see it, or, if she did, she deliberately chose another
seat. He came back to his own chair and leaned his elbows on the blotter.
She faced him from the farther side of the table.

âYou promised to let me hear from you now and then,â he began awkwardly,
and with a sharp sense of his awkwardness.

A faint smile made her face more tragic. âDid I? There was nothing to
tell. Iâve had no history—like the happy countries...â

He waited a moment before asking: âYou
are
happy here?â

âI
was
,â she said with a faint emphasis.

âWhy do you say âwasâ? Youâre surely not thinking of going? There canât be
kinder people anywhere.â Darrow hardly knew what he was saying; but her
answer came to him with deadly definiteness.

âI suppose it depends on you whether I go or stay.â

âOn me?â He stared at her across Owenâs scattered papers. âGood God! What
can you think of me, to say that?â

The mockery of the question flashed back at him from her wretched face.
She stood up, wandered away, and leaned an instant in the darkening
window-frame. From there she turned to fling back at him: âDonât imagine
Iâm the least bit sorry for anything!â

He steadied his elbows on the table and hid his face in his hands. It was
harder, oh, damnably harder, than he had expected! Arguments, expedients,
palliations, evasions, all seemed to be slipping away from him: he was
left face to face with the mere graceless fact of his inferiority. He
lifted his head to ask at random: âYouâve been here, then, ever since?â

âSince June; yes. It turned out that the Farlows were hunting for me—all
the while—for this.â

She stood facing him, her back to the window, evidently impatient to be
gone, yet with something still to say, or that she expected to hear him
say. The sense of her expectancy benumbed him. What in heavenâs name could
he say to her that was not an offense or a mockery?

âYour idea of the theatre—you gave that up at once, then?â

âOh, the theatre!â She gave a little laugh. âI couldnât wait for the
theatre. I had to take the first thing that offered; I took this.â

He pushed on haltingly: âIâm glad—extremely glad—youâre happy
here.... Iâd counted on your letting me know if there was anything I could
do.... The theatre, now—if you still regret it—if youâre not
contented here.... I know people in that line in London—Iâm certain I
can manage it for you when I get back——â

She moved up to the table and leaned over it to ask, in a voice that was
hardly above a whisper: âThen you
do
want me to leave? Is that it?â

He dropped his arms with a groan. âGood heavens! How can you think such
things? At the time, you know, I begged you to let me do what I could, but
you wouldnât hear of it ... and ever since Iâve been wanting to be of use—to
do something, anything, to help you...â

She heard him through, motionless, without a quiver of the clasped hands
she rested on the edge of the table.

âIf you want to help me, then—you can help me to stay here,â she
brought out with low-toned intensity.

Through the stillness of the pause which followed, the bray of a
motor-horn sounded far down the drive. Instantly she turned, with a last
white look at him, and fled from the room and up the stairs. He stood
motionless, benumbed by the shock of her last words. She was afraid, then—afraid
of him—sick with fear of him! The discovery beat him down to a lower
depth...

The motor-horn sounded again, close at hand, and he turned and went up to
his room. His letter-writing was a sufficient pretext for not immediately
joining the party about the tea-table, and he wanted to be alone and try
to put a little order into his tumultuous thinking.

Upstairs, the room held out the intimate welcome of its lamp and fire.
Everything in it exhaled the same sense of peace and stability which, two
evenings before, had lulled him to complacent meditation. His armchair
again invited him from the hearth, but he was too agitated to sit still,
and with sunk head and hands clasped behind his back he began to wander up
and down the room.

His five minutes with Sophy Viner had flashed strange lights into the
shadowy corners of his consciousness. The girlâs absolute candour, her
hard ardent honesty, was for the moment the vividest point in his
thoughts. He wondered anew, as he had wondered before, at the way in which
the harsh discipline of life had stripped her of false sentiment without
laying the least touch on her pride. When they had parted, five months
before, she had quietly but decidedly rejected all his offers of help,
even to the suggestion of his trying to further her theatrical aims: she
had made it clear that she wished their brief alliance to leave no trace
on their lives save that of its own smiling memory. But now that they were
unexpectedly confronted in a situation which seemed, to her terrified
fancy, to put her at his mercy, her first impulse was to defend her right
to the place she had won, and to learn as quickly as possible if he meant
to dispute it. While he had pictured her as shrinking away from him in a
tremor of self-effacement she had watched his movements, made sure of her
opportunity, and come straight down to âhave it outâ with him. He was so
struck by the frankness and energy of the proceeding that for a moment he
lost sight of the view of his own character implied in it.

âPoor thing ... poor thing!â he could only go on saying; and with the
repetition of the words the picture of himself as she must see him
pitiably took shape again.

He understood then, for the first time, how vague, in comparison with
hers, had been his own vision of the part he had played in the brief
episode of their relation. The incident had left in him a sense of
exasperation and self-contempt, but that, as he now perceived, was
chiefly, if not altogether, as it bore on his preconceived ideal of his
attitude toward another woman. He had fallen below his own standard of
sentimental loyalty, and if he thought of Sophy Viner it was mainly as the
chance instrument of his lapse. These considerations were not agreeable to
his pride, but they were forced on him by the example of her valiant
common-sense. If he had cut a sorry figure in the business, he owed it to
her not to close his eyes to the fact any longer...

But when he opened them, what did he see? The situation, detestable at
best, would yet have been relatively simple if protecting Sophy Viner had
been the only duty involved in it. The fact that that duty was paramount
did not do away with the contingent obligations. It was Darrowâs instinct,
in difficult moments, to go straight to the bottom of the difficulty; but
he had never before had to take so dark a dive as this, and for the minute
he shivered on the brink.... Well, his first duty, at any rate, was to the
girl: he must let her see that he meant to fulfill it to the last jot, and
then try to find out how to square the fulfillment with the other problems
already in his path...

XVI

In the oak room he found Mrs. Leath, her mother-in-law and Effie. The
group, as he came toward it down the long drawing-rooms, composed itself
prettily about the tea-table. The lamps and the fire crossed their gleams
on silver and porcelain, on the bright haze of Effieâs hair and on the
whiteness of Annaâs forehead, as she leaned back in her chair behind the
tea-urn.

She did not move at Darrowâs approach, but lifted to him a deep gaze of
peace and confidence. The look seemed to throw about him the spell of a
divine security: he felt the joy of a convalescent suddenly waking to find
the sunlight on his face.

Madame de Chantelle, across her knitting, discoursed of their afternoonâs
excursion, with occasional pauses induced by the hypnotic effect of the
fresh air; and Effie, kneeling, on the hearth, softly but insistently
sought to implant in her terrierâs mind some notion of the relation
between a vertical attitude and sugar.

Darrow took a chair behind the little girl, so that he might look across
at her mother. It was almost a necessity for him, at the moment, to let
his eyes rest on Annaâs face, and to meet, now and then, the proud shyness
of her gaze.

Madame de Chantelle presently enquired what had become of Owen, and a
moment later the window behind her opened, and her grandson, gun in hand,
came in from the terrace. As he stood there in the lamp-light, with dead
leaves and bits of bramble clinging to his mud-spattered clothes, the
scent of the night about him and its chill on his pale bright face, he
really had the look of a young faun strayed in from the forest.

Effie abandoned the terrier to fly to him. âOh, Owen, where in the world
have you been? I walked miles and miles with Nurse and couldnât find you,
and we met Jean and he said he didnât know where youâd gone.â

âNobody knows where I go, or what I see when I get there—thatâs the
beauty of it!â he laughed back at her. âBut if youâre good,â he added,
âIâll tell you about it one of these days.â

âOh, now, Owen, now! I donât really believe Iâll ever be much better than
I am now.â

âLet Owen have his tea first,â her mother suggested; but the young man,
declining the offer, propped his gun against the wall, and, lighting a
cigarette, began to pace up and down the room in a way that reminded
Darrow of his own caged wanderings. Effie pursued him with her
blandishments, and for a while he poured out to her a low-voiced stream of
nonsense; then he sat down beside his step-mother and leaned over to help
himself to tea.

âWhereâs Miss Viner?â he asked, as Effie climbed up on him. âWhy isnât she
here to chain up this ungovernable infant?â

âPoor Miss Viner has a headache. Effie says she went to her room as soon
as lessons were over, and sent word that she wouldnât be down for tea.â

âAh,â said Owen, abruptly setting down his cup. He stood up, lit another
cigarette, and wandered away to the piano in the room beyond.

From the twilight where he sat a lonely music, borne on fantastic chords,
floated to the group about the tea-table. Under its influence Madame de
Chantelleâs meditative pauses increased in length and frequency, and Effie
stretched herself on the hearth, her drowsy head against the dog.
Presently her nurse appeared, and Anna rose at the same time. âStop a
minute in my sitting-room on your way up,â she paused to say to Darrow as
she went.

A few hours earlier, her request would have brought him instantly to his
feet. She had given him, on the day of his arrival, an inviting glimpse of
the spacious book-lined room above stairs in which she had gathered
together all the tokens of her personal tastes: the retreat in which, as
one might fancy, Anna Leath had hidden the restless ghost of Anna Summers;
and the thought of a talk with her there had been in his mind ever since.
But now he sat motionless, as if spell-bound by the play of Madame de
Chantelleâs needles and the pulsations of Owenâs fitful music.

âShe will want to ask me about the girl,â he repeated to himself, with a
fresh sense of the insidious taint that embittered all his thoughts; the
hand of the slender-columned clock on the mantel-piece had spanned a
half-hour before shame at his own indecision finally drew him to his feet.

From her writing-table, where she sat over a pile of letters, Anna lifted
her happy smile. The impulse to press his lips to it made him come close
and draw her upward. She threw her head back, as if surprised at the
abruptness of the gesture; then her face leaned to his with the slow droop
of a flower. He felt again the sweep of the secret tides, and all his
fears went down in them.

She sat down in the sofa-corner by the fire and he drew an armchair close
to her. His gaze roamed peacefully about the quiet room.

âItâs just like you—it is you,â he said, as his eyes came back to
her.

âItâs a good place to be alone in—I donât think Iâve ever before
cared to talk with any one here.â

âLetâs be quiet, then: itâs the best way of talking.â

âYes; but we must save it up till later. There are things I want to say to
you now.â

He leaned back in his chair. âSay them, then, and Iâll listen.â

âOh, no. I want you to tell me about Miss Viner.â

âAbout Miss Viner?â He summoned up a look of faint interrogation.

He thought she seemed surprised at his surprise. âItâs important,
naturally,â she explained, âthat I should find out all I can about her
before I leave.â

âImportant on Effieâs account?â

âOn Effieâs account—of course.â

âOf course.... But youâve every reason to be satisfied, havenât you?â

âEvery apparent reason. We all like her. Effieâs very fond of her, and she
seems to have a delightful influence on the child. But we know so little,
after all—about her antecedents, I mean, and her past history.
Thatâs why I want you to try and recall everything you heard about her
when you used to see her in London.â

âOh, on that score Iâm afraid I shaânât be of much use. As I told you, she
was a mere shadow in the background of the house I saw her in—and
that was four or five years ago...â

âWhen she was with a Mrs. Murrett?â

âYes; an appalling woman who runs a roaring dinner-factory that used now
and then to catch me in its wheels. I escaped from them long ago; but in
my time there used to be half a dozen fagged âhandsâ to tend the machine,
and Miss Viner was one of them. Iâm glad sheâs out of it, poor girl!â
âThen you never really saw anything of her there?â

âI never had the chance. Mrs. Murrett discouraged any competition on the
part of her subordinates.â

âEspecially such pretty ones, I suppose?â Darrow made no comment, and she
continued: âAnd Mrs. Murrettâs own opinion—if sheâd offered you one—probably
wouldnât have been of much value?â

âOnly in so far as her disapproval would, on general principles, have been
a good mark for Miss Viner. But surely,â he went on after a pause, âyou
could have found out about her from the people through whom you first
heard of her?â

Anna smiled. âOh, we heard of her through Adelaide Painter—;â and in
reply to his glance of interrogation she explained that the lady in
question was a spinster of South Braintree, Massachusetts, who, having
come to Paris some thirty years earlier, to nurse a brother through an
illness, had ever since protestingly and provisionally camped there in a
state of contemptuous protestation oddly manifested by her never taking
the slip-covers off her drawing-room chairs. Her long residence on Gallic
soil had not mitigated her hostility toward the creed and customs of the
race, but though she always referred to the Catholic Church as the Scarlet
Woman and took the darkest views of French private life, Madame de
Chantelle placed great reliance on her judgment and experience, and in
every domestic crisis the irreducible Adelaide was immediately summoned to
Givre.

âItâs all the odder because my mother-in-law, since her second marriage,
has lived so much in the country that sheâs practically lost sight of all
her other American friends. Besides which, you can see how completely she
has identified herself with Monsieur de Chantelleâs nationality and
adopted French habits and prejudices. Yet when anything goes wrong she
always sends for Adelaide Painter, whoâs more American than the Stars and
Stripes, and might have left South Braintree yesterday, if she hadnât,
rather, brought it over with her in her trunk.â

Darrow laughed. âWell, then, if South Braintree vouches for Miss Viner——â

âOh, but only indirectly. When we had that odious adventure with
Mademoiselle Grumeau, whoâd been so highly recommended by Monsieur de
Chantelleâs aunt, the Chanoinesse, Adelaide was of course sent for, and
she said at once: âIâm not the least bit surprised. Iâve always told you
that what you wanted for Effie was a sweet American girl, and not one of
these nasty foreigners.â Unluckily she couldnât, at the moment, put her
hand on a sweet American; but she presently heard of Miss Viner through
the Farlows, an excellent couple who live in the Quartier Latin and write
about French life for the American papers. I was only too thankful to find
anyone who was vouched for by decent people; and so far Iâve had no cause
to regret my choice. But I know, after all, very little about Miss Viner;
and there are all kinds of reasons why I want, as soon as possible, to
find out more—to find out all I can.â

âSince youâve got to leave Effie I understand your feeling in that way.
But is there, in such a case, any recommendation worth half as much as
your own direct experience?â

âNo; and itâs been so favourable that I was ready to accept it as
conclusive. Only, naturally, when I found youâd known her in London I was
in hopes youâd give me some more specific reasons for liking her as much
as I do.â

âIâm afraid I can give you nothing more specific than my general vague
impression that she seems very plucky and extremely nice.â

âYou donât, at any rate, know anything specific to the contrary?â

âTo the contrary? How should I? Iâm not conscious of ever having heard any
one say two words about her. I only infer that she must have pluck and
character to have stuck it out so long at Mrs. Murrettâs.â

âYes, poor thing! She has pluck, certainly; and pride, too; which must
have made it all the harder.â Anna rose to her feet. âYou donât know how
glad I am that your impressionâs on the whole so good. I particularly
wanted you to like her.â

He drew her to him with a smile. âOn that condition Iâm prepared to love
even Adelaide Painter.â

âI almost hope you wont have the chance to—poor Adelaide! Her
appearance here always coincides with a catastrophe.â

âOh, then I must manage to meet her elsewhere.â He held Anna closer,
saying to himself, as he smoothed back the hair from her forehead: âWhat
does anything matter but just
this
?—Must I go now?â he added aloud.

She answered absently: âIt must be time to dressâ; then she drew back a
little and laid her hands on his shoulders. âMy love—oh, my dear
love!â she said.

It came to him that they were the first words of endearment he had heard
her speak, and their rareness gave them a magic quality of reassurance, as
though no danger could strike through such a shield.

A knock on the door made them draw apart. Anna lifted her hand to her hair
and Darrow stooped to examine a photograph of Effie on the writing-table.

âCome in!â Anna said.

The door opened and Sophy Viner entered. Seeing Darrow, she drew back.

âDo come in, Miss Viner,â Anna repeated, looking at her kindly.

The girl, a quick red in her cheeks, still hesitated on the threshold.

âIâm so sorry; but Effie has mislaid her Latin grammar, and I thought she
might have left it here. I need it to prepare for tomorrowâs lesson.â

âIs this it?â Darrow asked, picking up a book from the table.

âOh, thank you!â

He held it out to her and she took it and moved to the door.

âWait a minute, please, Miss Viner,â Anna said; and as the girl turned
back, she went on with her quiet smile: âEffie told us youâd gone to your
room with a headache. You mustnât sit up over tomorrowâs lessons if you
donât feel well.â

Sophyâs blush deepened. âBut you see I have to. Latinâs one of my weak
points, and thereâs generally only one page of this book between me and
Effie.â She threw the words off with a half-ironic smile. âDo excuse my
disturbing you,â she added.

âYou didnât disturb me,â Anna answered. Darrow perceived that she was
looking intently at the girl, as though struck by something tense and
tremulous in her face, her voice, her whole mien and attitude. âYou
do

look tired. Youâd much better go straight to bed. Effie wonât be sorry to
skip her Latin.â

âThank you—but Iâm really all right,â murmured Sophy Viner. Her
glance, making a swift circuit of the room, dwelt for an appreciable
instant on the intimate propinquity of arm-chair and sofa-corner; then she
turned back to the door.

BOOK III

XVII

At dinner that evening Madame de Chantelleâs slender monologue was thrown
out over gulfs of silence. Owen was still in the same state of moody
abstraction as when Darrow had left him at the piano; and even Annaâs
face, to her friendâs vigilant eye, revealed not, perhaps, a personal
preoccupation, but a vague sense of impending disturbance.

She smiled, she bore a part in the talk, her eyes dwelt on Darrowâs with
their usual deep reliance; but beneath the surface of her serenity his
tense perceptions detected a hidden stir.

He was sufficiently self-possessed to tell himself that it was doubtless
due to causes with which he was not directly concerned. He knew the
question of Owenâs marriage was soon to be raised, and the abrupt
alteration in the young manâs mood made it seem probable that he was
himself the centre of the atmospheric disturbance. For a moment it
occurred to Darrow that Anna might have employed her afternoon in
preparing Madame de Chantelle for her grandsonâs impending announcement;
but a glance at the elder ladyâs unclouded brow showed that he must seek
elsewhere the clue to Owenâs taciturnity and his step-motherâs concern.
Possibly Anna had found reason to change her own attitude in the matter,
and had made the change known to Owen. But this, again, was negatived by
the fact that, during the afternoonâs shooting, young Leath had been in a
mood of almost extravagant expansiveness, and that, from the moment of his
late return to the house till just before dinner, there had been, to
Darrowâs certain knowledge, no possibility of a private talk between
himself and his step-mother.

This obscured, if it narrowed, the field of conjecture; and Darrowâs
gropings threw him back on the conclusion that he was probably reading too
much significance into the moods of a lad he hardly knew, and who had been
described to him as subject to sudden changes of humour. As to Annaâs
fancied perturbation, it might simply be due to the fact that she had
decided to plead Owenâs cause the next day, and had perhaps already had a
glimpse of the difficulties awaiting her. But Darrow knew that he was too
deep in his own perplexities to judge the mental state of those about him.
It might be, after all, that the variations he felt in the currents of
communication were caused by his own inward tremor.

Such, at any rate, was the conclusion he had reached when, shortly after
the two ladies left the drawing-room, he bade Owen good-night and went up
to his room. Ever since the rapid self-colloquy which had followed on his
first sight of Sophy Viner, he had known there were other questions to be
faced behind the one immediately confronting him. On the score of that
one, at least, his mind, if not easy, was relieved. He had done what was
possible to reassure the girl, and she had apparently recognized the
sincerity of his intention. He had patched up as decent a conclusion as he
could to an incident that should obviously have had no sequel; but he had
known all along that with the securing of Miss Vinerâs peace of mind only
a part of his obligation was discharged, and that with that part his
remaining duty was in conflict. It had been his first business to convince
the girl that their secret was safe with him; but it was far from easy to
square this with the equally urgent obligation of safe-guarding Annaâs
responsibility toward her child. Darrow was not much afraid of accidental
disclosures. Both he and Sophy Viner had too much at stake not to be on
their guard. The fear that beset him was of another kind, and had a
profounder source. He wanted to do all he could for the girl, but the fact
of having had to urge Anna to confide Effie to her was peculiarly
repugnant to him. His own ideas about Sophy Viner were too mixed and
indeterminate for him not to feel the risk of such an experiment; yet he
found himself in the intolerable position of appearing to press it on the
woman he desired above all others to protect...

Till late in the night his thoughts revolved in a turmoil of indecision.
His pride was humbled by the discrepancy between what Sophy Viner had been
to him and what he had thought of her. This discrepancy, which at the time
had seemed to simplify the incident, now turned out to be its most galling
complication. The bare truth, indeed, was that he had hardly thought of
her at all, either at the time or since, and that he was ashamed to base
his judgement of her on his meagre memory of their adventure.

The essential cheapness of the whole affair—as far as his share in
it was concerned—came home to him with humiliating distinctness. He
would have liked to be able to feel that, at the time at least, he had
staked something more on it, and had somehow, in the sequel, had a more
palpable loss to show. But the plain fact was that he hadnât spent a penny
on it; which was no doubt the reason of the prodigious score it had since
been rolling up. At any rate, beat about the case as he would, it was
clear that he owed it to Anna—and incidentally to his own peace of
mind—to find some way of securing Sophy Vinerâs future without
leaving her installed at Givre when he and his wife should depart for
their new post.

The night brought no aid to the solving of this problem; but it gave him,
at any rate, the clear conviction that no time was to be lost. His first
step must be to obtain from Miss Viner the chance of another and calmer
talk; and he resolved to seek it at the earliest hour.

He had gathered that Effieâs lessons were preceded by an early scamper in
the park, and conjecturing that her governess might be with her he betook
himself the next morning to the terrace, whence he wandered on to the
gardens and the walks beyond.

The atmosphere was still and pale. The muffled sunlight gleamed like gold
tissue through grey gauze, and the beech alleys tapered away to a blue
haze blent of sky and forest. It was one of those elusive days when the
familiar forms of things seem about to dissolve in a prismatic shimmer.

The stillness was presently broken by joyful barks, and Darrow, tracking
the sound, overtook Effie flying down one of the long alleys at the head
of her pack. Beyond her he saw Miss Viner seated near the stone-rimmed
basin beside which he and Anna had paused on their first walk to the
river.

The girl, coming forward at his approach, returned his greeting almost
gaily. His first glance showed him that she had regained her composure,
and the change in her appearance gave him the measure of her fears. For
the first time he saw in her again the sidelong grace that had charmed his
eyes in Paris; but he saw it now as in a painted picture.

âShall we sit down a minute?â he asked, as Effie trotted off.

The girl looked away from him. âIâm afraid thereâs not much time; we must
be back at lessons at half-past nine.â

âBut itâs barely ten minutes past. Letâs at least walk a little way toward
the river.â

She glanced down the long walk ahead of them and then back in the
direction of the house. âIf you like,â she said in a low voice, with one
of her quick fluctuations of colour; but instead of taking the way he
proposed she turned toward a narrow path which branched off obliquely
through the trees.

Darrow was struck, and vaguely troubled, by the change in her look and
tone. There was in them an undefinable appeal, whether for help or
forbearance he could not tell. Then it occurred to him that there might
have been something misleading in his so pointedly seeking her, and he
felt a momentary constraint. To ease it he made an abrupt dash at the
truth.

âI came out to look for you because our talk of yesterday was so
unsatisfactory. I want to hear more about you—about your plans and
prospects. Iâve been wondering ever since why youâve so completely given
up the theatre.â

Her face instantly sharpened to distrust. âI had to live,â she said in an
off-hand tone.

âI understand perfectly that you should like it here—for a time.â
His glance strayed down the gold-roofed windings ahead of them. âItâs
delightful: you couldnât be better placed. Only I wonder a little at your
having so completely given up any idea of a different future.â

She waited for a moment before answering: âI suppose Iâm less restless
than I used to be.â

âItâs certainly natural that you should be less restless here than at Mrs.
Murrettâs; yet somehow I donât seem to see you permanently given up to
forming the young.â

âWhat—exactly—DO you seem to see me permanently given up to?
You know you warned me rather emphatically against the theatre.â She threw
off the statement without impatience, as though they were discussing
together the fate of a third person in whom both were benevolently
interested. Darrow considered his reply. âIf I did, it was because you so
emphatically refused to let me help you to a start.â

She stopped short and faced him âAnd you think I may let you now?â

Darrow felt the blood in his cheek. He could not understand her attitude—if
indeed she had consciously taken one, and her changes of tone did not
merely reflect the involuntary alternations of her mood. It humbled him to
perceive once more how little he had to guide him in his judgment of her.
He said to himself: âIf Iâd ever cared a straw for her I should know how
to avoid hurting her nowâ—and his insensibility struck him as no
better than a vulgar obtuseness. But he had a fixed purpose ahead and
could only push on to it.

âI hope, at any rate, youâll listen to my reasons. Thereâs been time, on
both sides, to think them over since——â He caught himself back
and hung helpless on the âsinceâ: whatever words he chose, he seemed to
stumble among reminders of their past.

She walked on beside him, her eyes on the ground. âThen Iâm to understand—definitely—that
you
do
renew your offer?â she asked

âWith all my heart! If youâll only let me——â

She raised a hand, as though to check him. âItâs extremely friendly of you—I

do
believe you mean it as a friend—but I donât quite understand why,
finding me, as you say, so well placed here, you should show more anxiety
about my future than at a time when I was actually, and rather
desperately, adrift.â

âOh, no, not more!â

âIf you show any at all, it must, at any rate, be for different reasons.—In
fact, it can only be,â she went on, with one of her disconcerting flashes
of astuteness, âfor one of two reasons; either because you feel you ought
to help me, or because, for some reason, you think you owe it to Mrs.
Leath to let her know what you know of me.â

Darrow stood still in the path. Behind him he heard Effieâs call, and at
the childâs voice he saw Sophy turn her head with the alertness of one who
is obscurely on the watch. The look was so fugitive that he could not have
said wherein it differed from her normal professional air of having her
pupil on her mind.

Effie sprang past them, and Darrow took up the girlâs challenge.

âWhat you suggest about Mrs. Leath is hardly worth answering. As to my
reasons for wanting to help you, a good deal depends on the words one uses
to define rather indefinite things. Itâs true enough that I want to help
you; but the wish isnât due to ... to any past kindness on your part, but
simply to my own interest in you. Why not put it that our friendship gives
me the right to intervene for what I believe to be your benefit?â

She took a few hesitating steps and then paused again. Darrow noticed that
she had grown pale and that there were rings of shade about her eyes.

âYouâve known Mrs. Leath a long time?â she asked him suddenly.

He paused with a sense of approaching peril. âA long time—yes.â

âShe told me you were friends—great friendsâ

âYes,â he admitted, âweâre great friends.â

âThen you might naturally feel yourself justified in telling her that you
donât think Iâm the right person for Effie.â He uttered a sound of
protest, but she disregarded it. âI donât say youâd
like
to do it. You
wouldnât: youâd hate it. And the natural alternative would be to try to
persuade me that Iâd be better off somewhere else than here. But supposing
that failed, and you saw I was determined to stay?
then
you might think it
your duty to tell Mrs. Leath.â

She laid the case before him with a cold lucidity. âI should, in your
place, I believe,â she ended with a little laugh.

âI shouldnât feel justified in telling her, behind your back, if I thought
you unsuited for the place; but I should certainly feel justified,â he
rejoined after a pause, âin telling
you
if I thought the place unsuited to
you.â

âAnd thatâs what youâre trying to tell me now?â

âYes; but not for the reasons you imagine.â

âWhat, then, are your reasons, if you please?â

âIâve already implied them in advising you not to give up all idea of the
theatre. Youâre too various, too gifted, too personal, to tie yourself
down, at your age, to the dismal drudgery of teaching.â

âAnd is
that
what youâve told Mrs. Leath?â

She rushed the question out at him as if she expected to trip him up over
it. He was moved by the simplicity of the stratagem.

âIâve told her exactly nothing,â he replied.

âAnd what—exactly—do you mean by ânothingâ? You and she were
talking about me when I came into her sitting-room yesterday.â

Darrow felt his blood rise at the thrust.

âIâve told her, simply, that Iâd seen you once or twice at Mrs.
Murrettâs.â

âAnd not that youâve ever seen me since?â

âAnd not that Iâve ever seen you since...â

âAnd she believes you—she completely believes you?â

He uttered a protesting exclamation, and his flush reflected itself in the
girlâs cheek.

âOh, I beg your pardon! I didnât mean to ask you that.â She halted, and
again cast a rapid glance behind and ahead of her. Then she held out her
hand. âWell, then, thank you—and let me relieve your fears. I
shaânât be Effieâs governess much longer.â

At the announcement, Darrow tried to merge his look of relief into the
expression of friendly interest with which he grasped her hand. âYou
really do agree with me, then? And youâll give me a chance to talk things
over with you?â

She shook her head with a faint smile. âIâm not thinking of the stage.
Iâve had another offer: thatâs all.â

The relief was hardly less great. After all, his personal responsibility
ceased with her departure from Givre.

âYouâll tell me about that, then—wonât you?â

Her smile flickered up. âOh, youâll hear about it soon.... I must catch
Effie now and drag her back to the blackboard.â

She walked on for a few yards, and then paused again and confronted him.
âIâve been odious to you—and not quite honest,â she broke out
suddenly.

âNot quite honest?â he repeated, caught in a fresh wave of wonder.

âI mean, in seeming not to trust you. Itâs come over me again as we talked
that, at heart, Iâve always
known
I could...â

Her colour rose in a bright wave, and her eyes clung to his for a swift
instant of reminder and appeal. For the same space of time the past surged
up in him confusedly; then a veil dropped between them.

âHereâs Effie now!â she exclaimed.

He turned and saw the little girl trotting back to them, her hand in Owen
Leathâs. Even through the stir of his subsiding excitement Darrow was at
once aware of the change effected by the young manâs approach. For a
moment Sophy Vinerâs cheeks burned redder; then they faded to the paleness
of white petals. She lost, however, nothing of the bright bravery which it
was her way to turn on the unexpected. Perhaps no one less familiar with
her face than Darrow would have discerned the tension of the smile she
transferred from himself to Owen Leath, or have remarked that her eyes had
hardened from misty grey to a shining darkness. But her observer was less
struck by this than by the corresponding change in Owen Leath. The latter,
when he came in sight, had been laughing and talking unconcernedly with
Effie; but as his eye fell on Miss Viner his expression altered as
suddenly as hers.

The change, for Darrow, was less definable; but, perhaps for that reason,
it struck him as more sharply significant. Only—just what did it
signify? Owen, like Sophy Viner, had the kind of face which seems less the
stage on which emotions move than the very stuff they work in. In moments
of excitement his odd irregular features seemed to grow fluid, to unmake
and remake themselves like the shadows of clouds on a stream. Darrow,
through the rapid flight of the shadows, could not seize on any specific
indication of feeling: he merely perceived that the young man was
unaccountably surprised at finding him with Miss Viner, and that the
extent of his surprise might cover all manner of implications.

Darrowâs first idea was that Owen, if he suspected that the conversation
was not the result of an accidental encounter, might wonder at his
step-motherâs suitor being engaged, at such an hour, in private talk with
her little girlâs governess. The thought was so disturbing that, as the
three turned back to the house, he was on the point of saying to Owen: âI
came out to look for your mother.â But, in the contingency he feared, even
so simple a phrase might seem like an awkward attempt at explanation; and
he walked on in silence at Miss Vinerâs side. Presently he was struck by
the fact that Owen Leath and the girl were silent also; and this gave a
new turn to his thoughts. Silence may be as variously shaded as speech;
and that which enfolded Darrow and his two companions seemed to his
watchful perceptions to be quivering with cross-threads of communication.
At first he was aware only of those that centred in his own troubled
consciousness; then it occurred to him that an equal activity of
intercourse was going on outside of it. Something was in fact passing
mutely and rapidly between young Leath and Sophy Viner; but what it was,
and whither it tended, Darrow, when they reached the house, was but just
beginning to divine...

XVIII

Anna Leath, from the terrace, watched the return of the little group.

She looked down on them, as they advanced across the garden, from the
serene height of her unassailable happiness. There they were, coming
toward her in the mild morning light, her child, her step-son, her
promised husband: the three beings who filled her life. She smiled a
little at the happy picture they presented, Effieâs gambols encircling it
in a moving frame within which the two men came slowly forward in the
silence of friendly understanding. It seemed part of the deep intimacy of
the scene that they should not be talking to each other, and it did not
till afterward strike her as odd that neither of them apparently felt it
necessary to address a word to Sophy Viner.

Anna herself, at the moment, was floating in the mid-current of felicity,
on a tide so bright and buoyant that she seemed to be one with its warm
waves. The first rush of bliss had stunned and dazzled her; but now that,
each morning, she woke to the calm certainty of its recurrence, she was
growing used to the sense of security it gave.

âI feel as if I could trust my happiness to carry me; as if it had grown
out of me like wings.â So she phrased it to Darrow, as, later in the
morning, they paced the garden-paths together. His answering look gave her
the same assurance of safety. The evening before he had seemed
preoccupied, and the shadow of his mood had faintly encroached on the
great golden orb of their blessedness; but now it was uneclipsed again,
and hung above them high and bright as the sun at noon.

Upstairs in her sitting-room, that afternoon, she was thinking of these
things. The morning mists had turned to rain, compelling the postponement
of an excursion in which the whole party were to have joined. Effie, with
her governess, had been despatched in the motor to do some shopping at
Francheuil; and Anna had promised Darrow to join him, later in the
afternoon, for a quick walk in the rain.

He had gone to his room after luncheon to get some belated letters off his
conscience; and when he had left her she had continued to sit in the same
place, her hands crossed on her knees, her head slightly bent, in an
attitude of brooding retrospection. As she looked back at her past life,
it seemed to her to have consisted of one ceaseless effort to pack into
each hour enough to fill out its slack folds; but now each moment was like
a miserâs bag stretched to bursting with pure gold.

She was roused by the sound of Owenâs step in the gallery outside her
room. It paused at her door and in answer to his knock she called out
âCome in!â

As the door closed behind him she was struck by his look of pale
excitement, and an impulse of compunction made her say: âYouâve come to
ask me why I havenât spoken to your grandmother!â He sent about him a
glance vaguely reminding her of the strange look with which Sophy Viner
had swept the room the night before; then his brilliant eyes came back to
her.

âIâve spoken to her myself,â he said.

Anna started up, incredulous.

âYouâve spoken to her? When?â

âJust now. I left her to come here.â

Annaâs first feeling was one of annoyance. There was really something
comically incongruous in this boyish surrender to impulse on the part of a
young man so eager to assume the responsibilities of life. She looked at
him with a faintly veiled amusement.

âYou asked me to help you and I promised you I would. It was hardly worth
while to work out such an elaborate plan of action if you intended to take
the matter out of my hands without telling me.â

âOh, donât take that tone with me!â he broke out, almost angrily.

âThat tone? What tone?â She stared at his quivering face. âI might,â she
pursued, still half-laughing, âmore properly make that request of
you
!â

Owen reddened and his vehemence suddenly subsided.

âI meant that I
had
to speak—thatâs all. You donât give me a chance
to explain...â

She looked at him gently, wondering a little at her own impatience.

âOwen! Donât I always want to give you every chance? Itâs because I
do

that I wanted to talk to your grandmother first—that I was waiting
and watching for the right moment...â

âThe right moment? So was I. Thatâs why Iâve spoken.â His voice rose again
and took the sharp edge it had in moments of high pressure.

His step-mother turned away and seated herself in her sofa-corner. âOh, my
dear, itâs not a privilege to quarrel over! Youâve taken a load off my
shoulders. Sit down and tell me all about it.â

He stood before her, irresolute. âI canât sit down,â he said.

âWalk about, then. Only tell me: Iâm impatient.â

His immediate response was to throw himself into the armchair at her side,
where he lounged for a moment without speaking, his legs stretched out,
his arms locked behind his thrown-back head. Anna, her eyes on his face,
waited quietly for him to speak.

âWell—of course it was just what one expected.â

âShe takes it so badly, you mean?â

âAll the heavy batteries were brought up: my father, Givre, Monsieur de
Chantelle, the throne and the altar. Even my poor mother was dragged out
of oblivion and armed with imaginary protests.â

Anna sighed out her sympathy. âWell—you were prepared for all that?â

âI thought I was, till I began to hear her say it. Then it sounded so
incredibly silly that I told her so.â

âOh, Owen—Owen!â

âYes: I know. I was a fool; but I couldnât help it.â

âAnd youâve mortally offended her, I suppose? Thatâs exactly what I wanted
to prevent.â She laid a hand on his shoulder. âYou tiresome boy, not to
wait and let me speak for you!â

He moved slightly away, so that her hand slipped from its place. âYou
donât understand,â he said, frowning.

âI donât see how I can, till you explain. If you thought the time had come
to tell your grandmother, why not have asked me to do it? I had my reasons
for waiting; but if youâd told me to speak I should have done so,
naturally.â

He evaded her appeal by a sudden turn. âWhat
were
your reasons for
waiting?â

Anna did not immediately answer. Her step-sonâs eyes were on her face, and
under his gaze she felt a faint disquietude.

âI was feeling my way.... I wanted to be absolutely sure...â

âAbsolutely sure of what?â

She delayed again for a just perceptible instant. âWhy, simply of
our
side
of the case.â

âBut you told me you were, the other day, when we talked it over before
they came back from Ouchy.â

âOh, my dear—if you think that, in such a complicated matter, every
day, every hour, doesnât more or less modify oneâs surest sureness!â

âThatâs just what Iâm driving at. I want to know what has modified yours.â

She made a slight gesture of impatience. âWhat does it matter, now the
thingâs done? I donât know that I could give any clear reason...â

He got to his feet and stood looking down on her with a tormented brow.
âBut itâs absolutely necessary that you should.â

At his tone her impatience flared up. âItâs not necessary that I should
give you any explanation whatever, since youâve taken the matter out of my
hands. All I can say is that I was trying to help you: that no other
thought ever entered my mind.â She paused a moment and then added: âIf you
doubted it, you were right to do what youâve done.â

âOh, I never doubted
you
!â he retorted, with a fugitive stress on the
pronoun. His face had cleared to its old look of trust. âDonât be offended
if Iâve seemed to,â he went on. âI canât quite explain myself,
either ... itâs all a kind of tangle, isnât it? Thatâs why I thought Iâd
better speak at once; or rather why I didnât think at all, but just
suddenly blurted the thing out——â

Anna gave him back his look of conciliation. âWell, the how and why donât
much matter now. The point is how to deal with your grandmother. Youâve
not told me what she means to do.â

âOh, she means to send for Adelaide Painter.â

The name drew a faint note of mirth from him and relaxed both their faces
to a smile.

âPerhaps,â Anna added, âitâs really the best thing for us all.â

Owen shrugged his shoulders. âItâs too preposterous and humiliating.
Dragging that woman into our secrets——!â

âThis could hardly be a secret much longer.â

He had moved to the hearth, where he stood pushing about the small
ornaments on the mantel-shelf; but at her answer he turned back to her.

âYou havenât, of course, spoken of it to any one?â

âNo; but I intend to now.â

She paused for his reply, and as it did not come she continued: âIf
Adelaide Painterâs to be told thereâs no possible reason why I shouldnât
tell Mr. Darrow.â Owen abruptly set down the little statuette between his
fingers. âNone whatever: I want every one to know.â

She smiled a little at his over-emphasis, and was about to meet it with a
word of banter when he continued, facing her: âYou havenât, as yet, said a
word to him?â

âIâve told him nothing, except what the discussion of our own plans—his
and mine—obliged me to: that you were thinking of marrying, and that
I wasnât willing to leave France till Iâd done what I could to see you
through.â

At her first words the colour had rushed to his forehead; but as she
continued she saw his face compose itself and his blood subside.

âYouâre a brick, my dear!â he exclaimed.

âYou had my word, you know.â

âYes; yes—I know.â His face had clouded again. âAnd thatâs all—positively
all—youâve ever said to him?â

âPositively all. But why do you ask?â

He had a momentâs embarrassed hesitation. âIt was understood, wasnât it,
that my grandmother was to be the first to know?â

âWell—and so she has been, hasnât she, since youâve told her?â

He turned back to his restless shifting of the knick-knacks.

âAnd youâre sure that nothing youâve said to Darrow could possibly have
given him a hint——?â

âNothing Iâve said to him—certainly.â

He swung about on her. âWhy do you put it in that way?â

âIn what way?â

âWhy—as if you thought some one else might have spoken...â

âSome one else? Who else?â She rose to her feet. âWhat on earth, my dear
boy, can you be driving at?â

âIâm trying to find out whether you think he knows anything definite.â

âWhy should I think so? Do
you
?â

âI donât know. I want to find out.â

She laughed at his obstinate insistence. âTo test my veracity, I suppose?â
At the sound of a step in the gallery she added: âHere he is—you can
ask him yourself.â

She met Darrowâs knock with an invitation to enter, and he came into the
room and paused between herself and Owen. She was struck, as he stood
there, by the contrast between his happy careless good-looks and her
step-sonâs frowning agitation.

Darrow met her eyes with a smile. âAm I too soon? Or is our walk given
up?â

âNo; I was just going to get ready.â She continued to linger between the
two, looking slowly from one to the other. âBut thereâs something we want
to tell you first: Owen is engaged to Miss Viner.â

The sense of an indefinable interrogation in Owenâs mind made her, as she
spoke, fix her eyes steadily on Darrow.

He had paused just opposite the window, so that, even in the rainy
afternoon light, his face was clearly open to her scrutiny. For a second,
immense surprise was alone visible on it: so visible that she half turned
to her step-son, with a faint smile for his refuted suspicions. Why, she
wondered, should Owen have thought that Darrow had already guessed his
secret, and what, after all, could be so disturbing to him in this not
improbable contingency? At any rate, his doubt must have been dispelled:
there was nothing feigned about Darrowâs astonishment. When her eyes
turned back to him he was already crossing to Owen with outstretched hand,
and she had, through an unaccountable faint flutter of misgiving, a mere
confused sense of their exchanging the customary phrases. Her next
perception was of Owenâs tranquillized look, and of his smiling return of
Darrowâs congratulatory grasp. She had the eerie feeling of having been
overswept by a shadow which there had been no cloud to cast...

A moment later Owen had left the room and she and Darrow were alone. He
had turned away to the window and stood staring out into the down-pour.

âYouâre surprised at Owenâs news?â she asked.

âYes: I am surprised,â he answered.

âYou hadnât thought of its being Miss Viner?â

âWhy should I have thought of Miss Viner?â

âYou see now why I wanted so much to find out what you knew about her.â He
made no comment, and she pursued: âNow that you
do
know itâs she, if
thereâs anything——â

He moved back into the room and went up to her. His face was serious, with
a slight shade of annoyance. âWhat on earth should there be? As I told
you, Iâve never in my life heard any one say two words about Miss Viner.â

Anna made no answer and they continued to face each other without moving.
For the moment she had ceased to think about Sophy Viner and Owen: the
only thought in her mind was that Darrow was alone with her, close to her,
and that, for the first time, their hands and lips had not met.

He glanced back doubtfully at the window. âItâs pouring. Perhaps youâd
rather not go out?â

She hesitated, as if waiting for him to urge her. âI suppose Iâd better
not. I ought to go at once to my mother-in-law—Owenâs just been
telling her,â she said.

âAh.â Darrow hazarded a smile. âThat accounts for my having, on my way up,
heard some one telephoning for Miss Painter!â

At the allusion they laughed together, vaguely, and Anna moved toward the
door. He held it open for her and followed her out.

XIX

He left her at the door of Madame de Chantelleâs sitting-room, and plunged
out alone into the rain.

The wind flung about the stripped tree-tops of the avenue and dashed the
stinging streams into his face. He walked to the gate and then turned into
the high-road and strode along in the open, buffeted by slanting gusts.
The evenly ridged fields were a blurred waste of mud, and the russet
coverts which he and Owen had shot through the day before shivered
desolately against a driving sky.

Darrow walked on and on, indifferent to the direction he was taking. His
thoughts were tossing like the tree-tops. Annaâs announcement had not come
to him as a complete surprise: that morning, as he strolled back to the
house with Owen Leath and Miss Viner, he had had a momentary intuition of
the truth. But it had been no more than an intuition, the merest faint
cloud-puff of surmise; and now it was an attested fact, darkening over the
whole sky.

In respect of his own attitude, he saw at once that the discovery made no
appreciable change. If he had been bound to silence before, he was no less
bound to it now; the only difference lay in the fact that what he had just
learned had rendered his bondage more intolerable. Hitherto he had felt
for Sophy Vinerâs defenseless state a sympathy profoundly tinged with
compunction. But now he was half-conscious of an obscure indignation
against her. Superior as he had fancied himself to ready-made judgments,
he was aware of cherishing the common doubt as to the disinterestedness of
the woman who tries to rise above her past. No wonder she had been sick
with fear on meeting him! It was in his power to do her more harm than he
had dreamed...

Assuredly he did not want to harm her; but he did desperately want to
prevent her marrying Owen Leath. He tried to get away from the feeling, to
isolate and exteriorize it sufficiently to see what motives it was made
of; but it remained a mere blind motion of his blood, the instinctive
recoil from the thing that no amount of arguing can make âstraight.â His
tramp, prolonged as it was, carried him no nearer to enlightenment; and
after trudging through two or three sallow mud-stained villages he turned
about and wearily made his way back to Givre. As he walked up the black
avenue, making for the lights that twinkled through its pitching branches,
he had a sudden realisation of his utter helplessness. He might think and
combine as he would; but there was nothing, absolutely nothing, that he
could do...

He dropped his wet coat in the vestibule and began to mount the stairs to
his room. But on the landing he was overtaken by a sober-faced maid who,
in tones discreetly lowered, begged him to be so kind as to step, for a
moment, into the Marquiseâs sitting-room. Somewhat disconcerted by the
summons, he followed its bearer to the door at which, a couple of hours
earlier, he had taken leave of Mrs. Leath. It opened to admit him to a
large lamp-lit room which he immediately perceived to be empty; and the
fact gave him time to note, even through his disturbance of mind, the
interesting degree to which Madame de Chantelleâs apartment âdatedâ and
completed her. Its looped and corded curtains, its purple satin
upholstery, the Sevres jardinieres, the rosewood fire-screen, the little
velvet tables edged with lace and crowded with silver knick-knacks and
simpering miniatures, reconstituted an almost perfect setting for the
blonde beauty of the âsixties. Darrow wondered that Fraser Leathâs filial
respect should have prevailed over his aesthetic scruples to the extent of
permitting such an anachronism among the eighteenth century graces of
Givre; but a momentâs reflection made it clear that, to its late owner,
the attitude would have seemed exactly in the traditions of the place.

Madame de Chantelleâs emergence from an inner room snatched Darrow from
these irrelevant musings. She was already beaded and bugled for the
evening, and, save for a slight pinkness of the eye-lids, her elaborate
appearance revealed no mark of agitation; but Darrow noticed that, in
recognition of the solemnity of the occasion, she pinched a lace
handkerchief between her thumb and forefinger.

She plunged at once into the centre of the difficulty, appealing to him,
in the name of all the Everards, to descend there with her to the rescue
of her darling. She wasnât, she was sure, addressing herself in vain to
one whose person, whose âtone,â whose traditions so brilliantly declared
his indebtedness to the principles she besought him to defend. Her own
reception of Darrow, the confidence she had at once accorded him, must
have shown him that she had instinctively felt their unanimity of
sentiment on these fundamental questions. She had in fact recognized in
him the one person whom, without pain to her maternal piety, she could
welcome as her sonâs successor; and it was almost as to Owenâs father that
she now appealed to Darrow to aid in rescuing the wretched boy.

âDonât think, please, that Iâm casting the least reflection on Anna, or
showing any want of sympathy for her, when I say that I consider her
partly responsible for whatâs happened. Anna is âmodernâ—I believe
thatâs what itâs called when you read unsettling books and admire hideous
pictures. Indeed,â Madame de Chantelle continued, leaning confidentially
forward, âI myself have always more or less lived in that atmosphere: my
son, you know, was very revolutionary. Only he didnât, of course, apply
his ideas: they were purely intellectual. Thatâs what dear Anna has always
failed to understand. And Iâm afraid sheâs created the same kind of
confusion in Owenâs mind—led him to mix up things you read about
with things you do.... You know, of course, that she sides with him in this
wretched business?â

Developing at length upon this theme, she finally narrowed down to the
point of Darrowâs intervention. âMy grandson, Mr. Darrow, calls me
illogical and uncharitable because my feelings toward Miss Viner have
changed since Iâve heard this news. Well! Youâve known her, it appears,
for some years: Anna tells me you used to see her when she was a
companion, or secretary or something, to a dreadfully vulgar Mrs. Murrett.
And I ask you as a friend, I ask you as one of
us
, to tell me if you think
a girl who has had to knock about the world in that kind of position, and
at the orders of all kinds of people, is fitted to be Owenâs wife. Iâm not
implying anything against her! I
liked
the girl, Mr. Darrow.... But whatâs
that got to do with it? I donât want her to marry my grandson. If Iâd been
looking for a wife for Owen, I shouldnât have applied to the Farlows to
find me one. Thatâs what Anna wonât understand; and what you must help me
to make her see.â

Darrow, to this appeal, could oppose only the repeated assurance of his
inability to interfere. He tried to make Madame de Chantelle see that the
very position he hoped to take in the household made his intervention the
more hazardous. He brought up the usual arguments, and sounded the
expected note of sympathy; but Madame de Chantelleâs alarm had dispelled
her habitual imprecision, and, though she had not many reasons to advance,
her argument clung to its point like a frightened sharp-clawed animal.

âWell, then,â she summed up, in response to his repeated assertions that
he saw no way of helping her, âyou can, at least, even if you wonât say a
word to the others, tell me frankly and fairly—and quite between
ourselves—your personal opinion of Miss Viner, since youâve known
her so much longer than we have.â

He protested that, if he had known her longer, he had known her much less
well, and that he had already, on this point, convinced Anna of his
inability to pronounce an opinion.

Madame de Chantelle drew a deep sigh of intelligence. âYour opinion of
Mrs. Murrett is enough! I donât suppose you pretend to conceal
that
? And
heaven knows what other unspeakable people sheâs been mixed up with. The
only friends she can produce are called Hoke.... Donât try to reason with
me, Mr. Darrow. There are feelings that go deeper than facts.... And I
know

she thought of studying for the stage...â Madame de Chantelle raised the
corner of her lace handkerchief to her eyes. âIâm old-fashioned—like
my furniture,â she murmured. âAnd I thought I could count on you, Mr.
Darrow...â

When Darrow, that night, regained his room, he reflected with a flash of
irony that each time he entered it he brought a fresh troop of
perplexities to trouble its serene seclusion. Since the day after his
arrival, only forty-eight hours before, when he had set his window open to
the night, and his hopes had seemed as many as its stars, each evening had
brought its new problem and its renewed distress. But nothing, as yet, had
approached the blank misery of mind with which he now set himself to face
the fresh questions confronting him.

Sophy Viner had not shown herself at dinner, so that he had had no glimpse
of her in her new character, and no means of divining the real nature of
the tie between herself and Owen Leath. One thing, however, was clear:
whatever her real feelings were, and however much or little she had at
stake, if she had made up her mind to marry Owen she had more than enough
skill and tenacity to defeat any arts that poor Madame de Chantelle could
oppose to her.

Darrow himself was in fact the only person who might possibly turn her
from her purpose: Madame de Chantelle, at haphazard, had hit on the surest
means of saving Owen—if to prevent his marriage were to save him!
Darrow, on this point, did not pretend to any fixed opinion; one feeling
alone was clear and insistent in him: he did not mean, if he could help
it, to let the marriage take place.

How he was to prevent it he did not know: to his tormented imagination
every issue seemed closed. For a fantastic instant he was moved to follow
Madame de Chantelleâs suggestion and urge Anna to withdraw her approval.
If his reticence, his efforts to avoid the subject, had not escaped her,
she had doubtless set them down to the fact of his knowing more, and
thinking less, of Sophy Viner than he had been willing to admit; and he
might take advantage of this to turn her mind gradually from the project.
Yet how do so without betraying his insincerity? If he had had nothing to
hide he could easily have said: âItâs one thing to know nothing against
the girl, itâs another to pretend that I think her a good match for Owen.â
But could he say even so much without betraying more? It was not Annaâs
questions, or his answers to them, that he feared, but what might cry
aloud in the intervals between them. He understood now that ever since
Sophy Vinerâs arrival at Givre he had felt in Anna the lurking sense of
something unexpressed, and perhaps inexpressible, between the girl and
himself.... When at last he fell asleep he had fatalistically committed his
next step to the chances of the morrow.

The first that offered itself was an encounter with Mrs. Leath as he
descended the stairs the next morning. She had come down already hatted
and shod for a dash to the park lodge, where one of the gatekeeperâs
children had had an accident. In her compact dark dress she looked more
than usually straight and slim, and her face wore the pale glow it took on
at any call on her energy: a kind of warrior brightness that made her
small head, with its strong chin and close-bound hair, like that of an
amazon in a frieze.

It was their first moment alone since she had left him, the afternoon
before, at her mother-in-lawâs door; and after a few words about the
injured child their talk inevitably reverted to Owen.

Anna spoke with a smile of her âsceneâ with Madame de Chantelle, who
belonged, poor dear, to a generation when âscenesâ (in the ladylike and
lachrymal sense of the term) were the tribute which sensibility was
expected to pay to the unusual. Their conversation had been, in every
detail, so exactly what Anna had foreseen that it had clearly not made
much impression on her; but she was eager to know the result of Darrowâs
encounter with her mother-in-law.

âShe told me sheâd sent for you: she always âsends forâ people in
emergencies. That again, I suppose, is
de lâepoque
. And failing Adelaide
Painter, who canât get here till this afternoon, there was no one but poor
you to turn to.â

She put it all lightly, with a lightness that seemed to his tight-strung
nerves slightly, undefinably over-done. But he was so aware of his own
tension that he wondered, the next moment, whether anything would ever
again seem to him quite usual and insignificant and in the common order of
things.

As they hastened on through the drizzle in which the storm of the night
was weeping itself out, Anna drew close under his umbrella, and at the
pressure of her arm against his he recalled his walk up the Dover pier
with Sophy Viner. The memory gave him a startled vision of the inevitable
occasions of contact, confidence, familiarity, which his future
relationship to the girl would entail, and the countless chances of
betrayal that every one of them involved.

âDo tell me just what you said,â he heard Anna pleading; and with sudden
resolution he affirmed: âI quite understand your mother-in-lawâs feeling
as she does.â

The words, when uttered, seemed a good deal less significant than they had
sounded to his inner ear; and Anna replied without surprise: âOf course.
Itâs inevitable that she should. But we shall bring her round in time.â
Under the dripping dome she raised her face to his. âDonât you remember
what you said the day before yesterday? âTogether we canât fail to pull it
off for him!â Iâve told Owen that, so youâre pledged and thereâs no going
back.â

The day before yesterday! Was it possible that, no longer ago, life had
seemed a sufficiently simple business for a sane man to hazard such
assurances?

âAnna,â he questioned her abruptly, âwhy are you so anxious for this
marriage?â

She stopped short to face him. âWhy? But surely Iâve explained to you—or
rather Iâve hardly had to, you seemed so in sympathy with my reasons!â

âI didnât know, then, who it was that Owen wanted to marry.â

The words were out with a spring and he felt a clearer air in his brain.
But her logic hemmed him in.

âYou knew yesterday; and you assured me then that you hadnât a word to say——â

âAgainst Miss Viner?â The name, once uttered, sounded on and on in his
ears. âOf course not. But that doesnât necessarily imply that I think her
a good match for Owen.â

Anna made no immediate answer. When she spoke it was to question: âWhy
donât you think her a good match for Owen?â

âWell—Madame de Chantelleâs reasons seem to me not quite as
negligible as you think.â

âYou mean the fact that sheâs been Mrs. Murrettâs secretary, and that the
people who employed her before were called Hoke? For, as far as Owen and I
can make out, these are the gravest charges against her.â

âStill, one can understand that the match is not what Madame de Chantelle
had dreamed of.â

âOh, perfectly—if thatâs all you mean.â The lodge was in sight, and
she hastened her step. He strode on beside her in silence, but at the gate
she checked him with the question: âIs it really all you mean?â

âOf course,â he heard himself declare.

âOh, then I think I shall convince you—even if I canât, like Madame
de Chantelle, summon all the Everards to my aid!â She lifted to him the
look of happy laughter that sometimes brushed her with a gleam of spring.

Darrow watched her hasten along the path between the dripping
chrysanthemums and enter the lodge. After she had gone in he paced up and
down outside in the drizzle, waiting to learn if she had any message to
send back to the house; and after the lapse of a few minutes she came out
again.

The child, she said, was badly, though not dangerously, hurt, and the
village doctor, who was already on hand, had asked that the surgeon,
already summoned from Francheuil, should be told to bring with him certain
needful appliances. Owen had started by motor to fetch the surgeon, but
there was still time to communicate with the latter by telephone. The
doctor furthermore begged for an immediate provision of such bandages and
disinfectants as Givre itself could furnish, and Anna bade Darrow address
himself to Miss Viner, who would know where to find the necessary things,
and would direct one of the servants to bicycle with them to the lodge.

Darrow, as he hurried off on this errand, had at once perceived the
opportunity it offered of a word with Sophy Viner. What that word was to
be he did not know; but now, if ever, was the moment to make it urgent and
conclusive. It was unlikely that he would again have such a chance of
unobserved talk with her.

He had supposed he should find her with her pupil in the school-room; but
he learned from a servant that Effie had gone to Francheuil with her
step-brother, and that Miss Viner was still in her room. Darrow sent her
word that he was the bearer of a message from the lodge, and a moment
later he heard her coming down the stairs.

XX

For a second, as she approached him, the quick tremor of her glance showed
her all intent on the same thought as himself. He transmitted his
instructions with mechanical precision, and she answered in the same tone,
repeating his words with the intensity of attention of a child not quite
sure of understanding. Then she disappeared up the stairs.

Darrow lingered on in the hall, not knowing if she meant to return, yet
inwardly sure she would. At length he saw her coming down in her hat and
jacket. The rain still streaked the window panes, and, in order to say
something, he said: âYouâre not going to the lodge yourself?â

âIâve sent one of the men ahead with the things; but I thought Mrs. Leath
might need me.â

âShe didnât ask for you,â he returned, wondering how he could detain her;
but she answered decidedly: âIâd better go.â

He held open the door, picked up his umbrella and followed her out. As
they went down the steps she glanced back at him. âYouâve forgotten your
mackintosh.â

âI shaânât need it.â

She had no umbrella, and he opened his and held it out to her. She
rejected it with a murmur of thanks and walked on through the thin
drizzle, and he kept the umbrella over his own head, without offering to
shelter her.

Rapidly and in silence they crossed the court and began to walk down the
avenue. They had traversed a third of its length before Darrow said
abruptly: âWouldnât it have been fairer, when we talked together
yesterday, to tell me what Iâve just heard from Mrs. Leath?â

âFairer——?â She stopped short with a startled look.

âIf Iâd known that your future was already settled I should have spared
you my gratuitous suggestions.â

She walked on, more slowly, for a yard or two. âI couldnât speak
yesterday. I meant to have told you today.â

âOh, Iâm not reproaching you for your lack of confidence. Only, if you
had

told me, I should have been more sure of your really meaning what you said
to me yesterday.â

She did not ask him to what he referred, and he saw that her parting words
to him lived as vividly in her memory as in his.

âIs it so important that you should be sure?â she finally questioned.

âNot to you, naturally,â he returned with involuntary asperity. It was
incredible, yet it was a fact, that for the moment his immediate purpose
in seeking to speak to her was lost under a rush of resentment at counting
for so little in her fate. Of what stuff, then, was his feeling for her
made? A few hours earlier she had touched his thoughts as little as his
senses; but now he felt old sleeping instincts stir in him... A rush of
rain dashed against his face, and, catching Sophyâs hat, strained it back
from her loosened hair. She put her hands to her head with a familiar
gesture.... He came closer and held his umbrella over her...

At the lodge he waited while she went in. The rain continued to stream
down on him and he shivered in the dampness and stamped his feet on the
flags. It seemed to him that a long time elapsed before the door opened
and she reappeared. He glanced into the house for a glimpse of Anna, but
obtained none; yet the mere sense of her nearness had completely altered
his mood.

The child, Sophy told him, was doing well; but Mrs. Leath had decided to
wait till the surgeon came. Darrow, as they turned away, looked through
the gates, and saw the doctorâs old-fashioned carriage by the roadside.

âLet me tell the doctorâs boy to drive you back,â he suggested; but Sophy
answered: âNo; Iâll walk,â and he moved on toward the house at her side.
She expressed no surprise at his not remaining at the lodge, and again
they walked on in silence through the rain. She had accepted the shelter
of his umbrella, but she kept herself at such a carefully measured
distance that even the slight swaying movements produced by their quick
pace did not once bring her arm in touch with his; and, noticing this, he
perceived that every drop of her blood must be alive to his nearness.

âWhat I meant just now,â he began, âwas that you ought to have been sure
of my good wishes.â

She seemed to weigh the words. âSure enough for what?â

âTo trust me a little farther than you did.â

âIâve told you that yesterday I wasnât free to speak.â

âWell, since you are now, may I say a word to you?â

She paused perceptibly, and when she spoke it was in so low a tone that he
had to bend his head to catch her answer. âI canât think what you can have
to say.â

âItâs not easy to say here, at any rate. And indoors I shaânât know where
to say it.â He glanced about him in the rain. âLetâs walk over to the
spring-house for a minute.â

To the right of the drive, under a clump of trees, a little stucco
pavilion crowned by a balustrade rose on arches of mouldering brick over a
flight of steps that led down to a spring. Other steps curved up to a door
above. Darrow mounted these, and opening the door entered a small circular
room hung with loosened strips of painted paper whereon spectrally faded
Mandarins executed elongated gestures. Some black and gold chairs with
straw seats and an unsteady table of cracked lacquer stood on the floor of
red-glazed tile.

Sophy had followed him without comment. He closed the door after her, and
she stood motionless, as though waiting for him to speak.

âNow we can talk quietly,â he said, looking at her with a smile into which
he tried to put an intention of the frankest friendliness.

She merely repeated: âI canât think what you can have to say.â

Her voice had lost the note of half-wistful confidence on which their talk
of the previous day had closed, and she looked at him with a kind of pale
hostility. Her tone made it evident that his task would be difficult, but
it did not shake his resolve to go on. He sat down, and mechanically she
followed his example. The table was between them and she rested her arms
on its cracked edge and her chin on her interlocked hands. He looked at
her and she gave him back his look.

âHave you nothing to say to
me
?â he asked at length.

A faint smile lifted, in the remembered way, the left corner of her
narrowed lips.

âAbout my marriage?â

âAbout your marriage.â

She continued to consider him between half-drawn lids. âWhat can I say
that Mrs. Leath has not already told you?â

âMrs. Leath has told me nothing whatever but the fact—and her
pleasure in it.â

âWell; arenât those the two essential points?â

âThe essential points to
you
? I should have thought——â

âOh, to
you
, I meant,â she put in keenly.

He flushed at the retort, but steadied himself and rejoined: âThe
essential point to me is, of course, that you should be doing whatâs
really best for you.â

She sat silent, with lowered lashes. At length she stretched out her arm
and took up from the table a little threadbare Chinese hand-screen. She
turned its ebony stem once or twice between her fingers, and as she did so
Darrow was whimsically struck by the way in which their evanescent slight
romance was symbolized by the fading lines on the frail silk.

âDo you think my engagement to Mr. Leath not really best for me?â she
asked at length.

Darrow, before answering, waited long enough to get his words into the
tersest shape—not without a sense, as he did so, of his likeness to
the surgeon deliberately poising his lancet for a clean incision. âIâm not
sure,â he replied, âof its being the best thing for either of you.â

She took the stroke steadily, but a faint red swept her face like the
reflection of a blush. She continued to keep her lowered eyes on the
screen.

âFrom whose point of view do you speak?â

âNaturally, that of the persons most concerned.â

âFrom Owenâs, then, of course? You donât think me a good match for him?â

âFrom yours, first of all. I donât think him a good match for you.â

He brought the answer out abruptly, his eyes on her face. It had grown
extremely pale, but as the meaning of his words shaped itself in her mind
he saw a curious inner light dawn through her set look. She lifted her
lids just far enough for a veiled glance at him, and a smile slipped
through them to her trembling lips. For a moment the change merely
bewildered him; then it pulled him up with a sharp jerk of apprehension.

âI donât think him a good match for you,â he stammered, groping for the
lost thread of his words.

She threw a vague look about the chilly rain-dimmed room. âAnd youâve
brought me here to tell me why?â

The question roused him to the sense that their minutes were numbered, and
that if he did not immediately get to his point there might be no other
chance of making it.

âMy chief reason is that I believe heâs too young and inexperienced to
give you the kind of support you need.â

At his words her face changed again, freezing to a tragic coldness. She
stared straight ahead of her, perceptibly struggling with the tremor of
her muscles; and when she had controlled it she flung out a pale-lipped
pleasantry. âBut you see Iâve always had to support myself!â

âHeâs a boy,â Darrow pushed on, âa charming, wonderful boy; but with no
more notion than a boy how to deal with the inevitable daily
problems ... the trivial stupid unimportant things that life is chiefly made
up of.â âIâll deal with them for him,â she rejoined.

âTheyâll be more than ordinarily difficult.â

She shot a challenging glance at him. âYou must have some special reason
for saying so.â

âOnly my clear perception of the facts.â

âWhat facts do you mean?â

Darrow hesitated. âYou must know better than I,â he returned at length,
âthat the way wonât be made easy to you.â

âMrs. Leath, at any rate, has made it so.â

âMadame de Chantelle will not.â

âHow do
you
know that?â she flung back.

He paused again, not sure how far it was prudent to reveal himself in the
confidence of the household. Then, to avoid involving Anna, he answered:
âMadame de Chantelle sent for me yesterday.â

âSent for you—to talk to you about me?â The colour rose to her
forehead and her eyes burned black under lowered brows. âBy what right, I
should like to know? What have you to do with me, or with anything in the
world that concerns me?â

Darrow instantly perceived what dread suspicion again possessed her, and
the sense that it was not wholly unjustified caused him a passing pang of
shame. But it did not turn him from his purpose.

âIâm an old friend of Mrs. Leathâs. Itâs not unnatural that Madame de
Chantelle should talk to me.â

She dropped the screen on the table and stood up, turning on him the same
small mask of wrath and scorn which had glared at him, in Paris, when he
had confessed to his suppression of her letter. She walked away a step or
two and then came back.

âMay I ask what Madame de Chantelle said to you?â

âShe made it clear that she should not encourage the marriage.â

âAnd what was her object in making that clear to
you
?â

Darrow hesitated. âI suppose she thought——â

âThat she could persuade you to turn Mrs. Leath against me?â

He was silent, and she pressed him: âWas that it?â âThat was it.â

âBut if you donât—if you keep your promise——â

âMy promise?â

âTo say nothing ... nothing whatever...â Her strained look threw a haggard
light along the pause.

As she spoke, the whole odiousness of the scene rushed over him. âOf
course I shall say nothing ... you know that...â He leaned to her and laid
his hand on hers. âYou know I wouldnât for the world...â

She drew back and hid her face with a sob. Then she sank again into her
seat, stretched her arms across the table and laid her face upon them. He
sat still, overwhelmed with compunction. After a long interval, in which
he had painfully measured the seconds by her hard-drawn breathing, she
looked up at him with a face washed clear of bitterness.

âDonât suppose I donât know what you must have thought of me!â

The cry struck him down to a lower depth of self-abasement. âMy poor
child,â he felt like answering, âthe shame of it is that Iâve never
thought of you at all!â But he could only uselessly repeat: âIâll do
anything I can to help you.â

She sat silent, drumming the table with her hand. He saw that her doubt of
him was allayed, and the perception made him more ashamed, as if her trust
had first revealed to him how near he had come to not deserving it.
Suddenly she began to speak.

âYou think, then, Iâve no right to marry him?â

âNo right? God forbid! I only meant——â

âThat youâd rather I didnât marry any friend of yours.â She brought it out
deliberately, not as a question, but as a mere dispassionate statement of
fact.

Darrow in turn stood up and wandered away helplessly to the window. He
stood staring out through its small discoloured panes at the dim brown
distances; then he moved back to the table.

âIâll tell you exactly what I meant. Youâll be wretched if you marry a man
youâre not in love with.â

He knew the risk of misapprehension that he ran, but he estimated his
chances of success as precisely in proportion to his peril. If certain
signs meant what he thought they did, he might yet—at what cost he
would not stop to think—make his past pay for his future.

The girl, at his words, had lifted her head with a movement of surprise.
Her eyes slowly reached his face and rested there in a gaze of deep
interrogation. He held the look for a moment; then his own eyes dropped
and he waited.

At length she began to speak. âYouâre mistaken—youâre quite
mistaken.â

He waited a moment longer. âMistaken——?â

âIn thinking what you think. Iâm as happy as if I deserved it!â she
suddenly proclaimed with a laugh.

She stood up and moved toward the door. â
Now
are you satisfied?â she
asked, turning her vividest face to him from the threshold.

XXI

Down the avenue there came to them, with the opening of the door, the
voice of Owenâs motor. It was the signal which had interrupted their first
talk, and again, instinctively, they drew apart at the sound. Without a
word Darrow turned back into the room, while Sophy Viner went down the
steps and walked back alone toward the court.

At luncheon the presence of the surgeon, and the non-appearance of Madame
de Chantelle—who had excused herself on the plea of a headache—combined
to shift the conversational centre of gravity; and Darrow, under shelter
of the necessarily impersonal talk, had time to adjust his disguise and to
perceive that the others were engaged in the same re-arrangement. It was
the first time that he had seen young Leath and Sophy Viner together since
he had learned of their engagement; but neither revealed more emotion than
befitted the occasion. It was evident that Owen was deeply under the
girlâs charm, and that at the least sign from her his bliss would have
broken bounds; but her reticence was justified by the tacitly recognized
fact of Madame de Chantelleâs disapproval. This also visibly weighed on
Annaâs mind, making her manner to Sophy, if no less kind, yet a trifle
more constrained than if the moment of final understanding had been
reached. So Darrow interpreted the tension perceptible under the fluent
exchange of commonplaces in which he was diligently sharing. But he was
more and more aware of his inability to test the moral atmosphere about
him: he was like a man in fever testing anotherâs temperature by the
touch.

After luncheon Anna, who was to motor the surgeon home, suggested to
Darrow that he should accompany them. Effie was also of the party; and
Darrow inferred that Anna wished to give her step-son a chance to be alone
with his betrothed. On the way back, after the surgeon had been left at
his door, the little girl sat between her mother and Darrow, and her
presence kept their talk from taking a personal turn. Darrow knew that
Mrs. Leath had not yet told Effie of the relation in which he was to stand
to her. The premature divulging of Owenâs plans had thrown their own into
the background, and by common consent they continued, in the little girlâs
presence, on terms of an informal friendliness.

The sky had cleared after luncheon, and to prolong their excursion they
returned by way of the ivy-mantled ruin which was to have been the scene
of the projected picnic. This circuit brought them back to the park gates
not long before sunset, and as Anna wished to stop at the lodge for news
of the injured child Darrow left her there with Effie and walked on alone
to the house. He had the impression that she was slightly surprised at his
not waiting for her; but his inner restlessness vented itself in an
intense desire for bodily movement. He would have liked to walk himself
into a state of torpor; to tramp on for hours through the moist winds and
the healing darkness and come back staggering with fatigue and sleep. But
he had no pretext for such a flight, and he feared that, at such a moment,
his prolonged absence might seem singular to Anna.

As he approached the house, the thought of her nearness produced a swift
reaction of mood. It was as if an intenser vision of her had scattered his
perplexities like morning mists. At this moment, wherever she was, he knew
he was safely shut away in her thoughts, and the knowledge made every
other fact dwindle away to a shadow. He and she loved each other, and
their love arched over them open and ample as the day: in all its sunlit
spaces there was no cranny for a fear to lurk. In a few minutes he would
be in her presence and would read his reassurance in her eyes. And
presently, before dinner, she would contrive that they should have an hour
by themselves in her sitting-room, and he would sit by the hearth and
watch her quiet movements, and the way the bluish lustre on her hair
purpled a little as she bent above the fire.

A carriage drove out of the court as he entered it, and in the hall his
vision was dispelled by the exceedingly substantial presence of a lady in
a waterproof and a tweed hat, who stood firmly planted in the centre of a
pile of luggage, as to which she was giving involved but lucid directions
to the footman who had just admitted her. She went on with these
directions regardless of Darrowâs entrance, merely fixing her small pale
eyes on him while she proceeded, in a deep contralto voice, and a fluent
French pronounced with the purest Boston accent, to specify the
destination of her bags; and this enabled Darrow to give her back a gaze
protracted enough to take in all the details of her plain thick-set
person, from the square sallow face beneath bands of grey hair to the
blunt boot-toes protruding under her wide walking skirt.

She submitted to this scrutiny with no more evidence of surprise than a
monument examined by a tourist; but when the fate of her luggage had been
settled she turned suddenly to Darrow and, dropping her eyes from his face
to his feet, asked in trenchant accents: âWhat sort of boots have you got
on?â

Before he could summon his wits to the consideration of this question she
continued in a tone of suppressed indignation: âUntil Americans get used
to the fact that France is under water for half the year theyâre
perpetually risking their lives by not being properly protected. I suppose
youâve been tramping through all this nasty clammy mud as if youâd been
taking a stroll on Boston Common.â

Darrow, with a laugh, affirmed his previous experience of French dampness,
and the degree to which he was on his guard against it; but the lady, with
a contemptuous snort, rejoined: âYou young men are all alike——â;
to which she appended, after another hard look at him: âI suppose youâre
George Darrow? I used to know one of your motherâs cousins, who married a
Tunstall of Mount Vernon Street. My name is Adelaide Painter. Have you
been in Boston lately? No? Iâm sorry for that. I hear there have been
several new houses built at the lower end of Commonwealth Avenue and I
hoped you could tell me about them. I havenât been there for thirty years
myself.â

Miss Painterâs arrival at Givre produced the same effect as the windâs
hauling around to the north after days of languid weather. When Darrow
joined the group about the tea-table she had already given a tingle to the
air. Madame de Chantelle still remained invisible above stairs; but Darrow
had the impression that even through her drawn curtains and bolted doors a
stimulating whiff must have entered.

Anna was in her usual seat behind the tea-tray, and Sophy Viner presently
led in her pupil. Owen was also there, seated, as usual, a little apart
from the others, and following Miss Painterâs massive movements and
equally substantial utterances with a smile of secret intelligence which
gave Darrow the idea of his having been in clandestine parley with the
enemy. Darrow further took note that the girl and her suitor perceptibly
avoided each other; but this might be a natural result of the tension Miss
Painter had been summoned to relieve.

Sophy Viner would evidently permit no recognition of the situation save
that which it lay with Madame de Chantelle to accord; but meanwhile Miss
Painter had proclaimed her tacit sense of it by summoning the girl to a
seat at her side.

Darrow, as he continued to observe the newcomer, who was perched on her
arm-chair like a granite image on the edge of a cliff, was aware that, in
a more detached frame of mind, he would have found an extreme interest in
studying and classifying Miss Painter. It was not that she said anything
remarkable, or betrayed any of those unspoken perceptions which give
significance to the most commonplace utterances. She talked of the
lateness of her train, of an impending crisis in international politics,
of the difficulty of buying English tea in Paris and of the enormities of
which French servants were capable; and her views on these subjects were
enunciated with a uniformity of emphasis implying complete unconsciousness
of any difference in their interest and importance. She always applied to
the French race the distant epithet of âthose peopleâ, but she betrayed an
intimate acquaintance with many of its members, and an encyclopaedic
knowledge of the domestic habits, financial difficulties and private
complications of various persons of social importance. Yet, as she
evidently felt no incongruity in her attitude, so she revealed no desire
to parade her familiarity with the fashionable, or indeed any sense of it
as a fact to be paraded. It was evident that the titled ladies whom she
spoke of as Mimi or Simone or Odette were as much âthose peopleâ to her as
the
bonne
who tampered with her tea and steamed the stamps off her letters
(âwhen, by a miracle, I donât put them in the box myself.â) Her whole
attitude was of a vast grim tolerance of things-as-they-came, as though
she had been some wonderful automatic machine which recorded facts but had
not yet been perfected to the point of sorting or labelling them.

All this, as Darrow was aware, still fell short of accounting for the
influence she obviously exerted on the persons in contact with her. It
brought a slight relief to his state of tension to go on wondering, while
he watched and listened, just where the mystery lurked. Perhaps, after
all, it was in the fact of her blank insensibility, an insensibility so
devoid of egotism that it had no hardness and no grimaces, but rather the
freshness of a simpler mental state. After living, as he had, as they all
had, for the last few days, in an atmosphere perpetually tremulous with
echoes and implications, it was restful and fortifying merely to walk into
the big blank area of Miss Painterâs mind, so vacuous for all its
accumulated items, so echoless for all its vacuity.

His hope of a word with Anna before dinner was dispelled by her rising to
take Miss Painter up to Madame de Chantelle; and he wandered away to his
own room, leaving Owen and Miss Viner engaged in working out a
picture-puzzle for Effie.

Madame de Chantelle—possibly as the result of her friendâs
ministrations—was able to appear at the dinner-table, rather pale
and pink-nosed, and casting tenderly reproachful glances at her grandson,
who faced them with impervious serenity; and the situation was relieved by
the fact that Miss Viner, as usual, had remained in the school-room with
her pupil.

Darrow conjectured that the real clash of arms would not take place till
the morrow; and wishing to leave the field open to the contestants he set
out early on a solitary walk. It was nearly luncheon-time when he returned
from it and came upon Anna just emerging from the house. She had on her
hat and jacket and was apparently coming forth to seek him, for she said
at once: âMadame de Chantelle wants you to go up to her.â

âTo go up to her? Now?â

âThatâs the message she sent. She appears to rely on you to do something.â
She added with a smile: âWhatever it is, letâs have it over!â

Darrow, through his rising sense of apprehension, wondered why, instead of
merely going for a walk, he had not jumped into the first train and got
out of the way till Owenâs affairs were finally settled.

âBut what in the name of goodness can I do?â he protested, following Anna
back into the hall.

âI donât know. But Owen seems so to rely on you, too——â

âOwen! Is
he
to be there?â

âNo. But you know I told him he could count on you.â

âBut Iâve said to your mother-in-law all I could.â

âWell, then you can only repeat it.â

This did not seem to Darrow to simplify his case as much as she appeared
to think; and once more he had a movement of recoil. âThereâs no possible
reason for my being mixed up in this affair!â

Anna gave him a reproachful glance. âNot the fact that I am?â she reminded
him; but even this only stiffened his resistance.

âWhy should you be, either—to this extent?â

The question made her pause. She glanced about the hall, as if to be sure
they had it to themselves; and then, in a lowered voice: âI donât know,â
she suddenly confessed; âbut, somehow, if
theyâre
not happy I feel as if
we shouldnât be.â

âOh, well—â Darrow acquiesced, in the tone of the man who perforce
yields to so lovely an unreasonableness. Escape was, after all,
impossible, and he could only resign himself to being led to Madame de
Chantelleâs door.

Within, among the bric-a-brac and furbelows, he found Miss Painter seated
in a redundant purple armchair with the incongruous air of a horseman
bestriding a heavy mount. Madame de Chantelle sat opposite, still a little
wan and disordered under her elaborate hair, and clasping the handkerchief
whose visibility symbolized her distress. On the young manâs entrance she
sighed out a plaintive welcome, to which she immediately appended: âMr.
Darrow, I canât help feeling that at heart youâre with me!â

The directness of the challenge made it easier for Darrow to protest, and
he reiterated his inability to give an opinion on either side.

âBut Anna declares you have—on hers!â

He could not restrain a smile at this faint flaw in an impartiality so
scrupulous. Every evidence of feminine inconsequence in Anna seemed to
attest her deeper subjection to the most inconsequent of passions. He had
certainly promised her his help—but before he knew what he was
promising.

He met Madame de Chantelleâs appeal by replying: âIf there were anything I
could possibly say I should want it to be in Miss Vinerâs favour.â

âYouâd want it to be—yes! But could you make it so?â

âAs far as facts go, I donât see how I can make it either for or against
her. Iâve already said that I know nothing of her except that sheâs
charming.â

âAs if that werenât enough—werenât all there
ought
to be!â Miss
Painter put in impatiently. She seemed to address herself to Darrow,
though her small eyes were fixed on her friend.

âMadame de Chantelle seems to imagine,â she pursued, âthat a young
American girl ought to have a dossier—a police-record, or whatever
you call it: what those awful women in the streets have here. In our
country itâs enough to know that a young girlâs pure and lovely: people
donât immediately ask her to show her bank-account and her visiting-list.â

Madame de Chantelle looked plaintively at her sturdy monitress. âYou donât
expect me not to ask if sheâs got a family?â

âNo; nor to think the worse of her if she hasnât. The fact that sheâs an
orphan ought, with your ideas, to be a merit. You wonât have to invite her
father and mother to Givre!â

âAdelaide—Adelaide!â the mistress of Givre lamented.

âLucretia Mary,â the other returned—and Darrow spared an instantâs
amusement to the quaint incongruity of the name—âyou know you sent
for Mr. Darrow to refute me; and how can he, till he knows what I think?â

âYou think itâs perfectly simple to let Owen marry a girl we know nothing
about?â

âNo; but I donât think itâs perfectly simple to prevent him.â

The shrewdness of the answer increased Darrowâs interest in Miss Painter.
She had not hitherto struck him as being a person of much penetration, but
he now felt sure that her gimlet gaze might bore to the heart of any
practical problem.

Madame de Chantelle sighed out her recognition of the difficulty.

âI havenât a word to say against Miss Viner; but sheâs knocked about so,
as itâs called, that she must have been mixed up with some rather dreadful
people. If only Owen could be made to see that—if one could get at a
few facts, I mean. She says, for instance, that she has a sister; but it
seems she doesnât even know her address!â

âIf she does, she may not want to give it to you. I daresay the sisterâs
one of the dreadful people. Iâve no doubt that with a little time you
could rake up dozens of them: have her âtracedâ, as they call it in
detective stories. I donât think youâd frighten Owen, but you might: itâs
natural enough he should have been corrupted by those foreign ideas. You
might even manage to part him from the girl; but you couldnât keep him
from being in love with her. I saw that when I looked them over last
evening. I said to myself: âItâs a real old-fashioned American case, as
sweet and sound as home-made bread.â Well, if you take his loaf away from
him, what are you going to feed him with instead? Which of your nasty
Paris poisons do you think heâll turn to? Supposing you succeed in keeping
him out of a really bad mess—and, knowing the young man as I do, I
rather think that, at this crisis, the only way to do it would be to marry
him slap off to somebody else—well, then, who, may I ask, would you
pick out? One of your sweet French ingenues, I suppose? With as much mind
as a minnow and as much snap as a soft-boiled egg. You might hustle him
into that kind of marriage; I daresay you could—but if I know Owen,
the natural thing would happen before the first baby was weaned.â

âI donât know why you insinuate such odious things against Owen!â

âDo you think it would be odious of him to return to his real love when
heâd been forcibly parted from her? At any rate, itâs what your French
friends do, every one of them! Only they donât generally have the grace to
go back to an old love; and I believe, upon my word, Owen would!â

Madame de Chantelle looked at her with a mixture of awe and exultation.
âOf course you realize, Adelaide, that in suggesting this youâre
insinuating the most shocking things against Miss Viner?â

âWhen I say that if you part two young things who are dying to be happy in
the lawful way itâs ten to one theyâll come together in an unlawful one?
Iâm insinuating shocking things against
you
, Lucretia Mary, in suggesting
for a moment that youâll care to assume such a responsibility before your
Maker. And you wouldnât, if you talked things straight out with him,
instead of merely sending him messages through a miserable sinner like
yourself!â

Darrow expected this assault on her adopted creed to provoke in Madame de
Chantelle an explosion of pious indignation; but to his surprise she
merely murmured: âI donât know what Mr. Darrowâll think of you!â

âMr. Darrow probably knows his Bible as well as I do,â Miss Painter calmly
rejoined; adding a moment later, without the least perceptible change of
voice or expression: âI suppose youâve heard that Gisele de Folembrayâs
husband accuses her of being mixed up with the Duc dâArcachon in that
business of trying to sell a lot of imitation pearls to Mrs. Homer Pond,
the Chicago woman the Dukeâs engaged to? It seems the jeweller says Gisele
brought Mrs. Pond there, and got twenty-five per cent—which of
course she passed on to dâArcachon. The poor old Duchess is in a fearful
state—so afraid her sonâll lose Mrs. Pond! When I think that Gisele
is old Bradford Wagstaffâs grand-daughter, Iâm thankful heâs safe in Mount
Auburn!â

XXII

It was not until late that afternoon that Darrow could claim his postponed
hour with Anna. When at last he found her alone in her sitting-room it was
with a sense of liberation so great that he sought no logical
justification of it. He simply felt that all their destinies were in Miss
Painterâs grasp, and that, resistance being useless, he could only enjoy
the sweets of surrender.

Anna herself seemed as happy, and for more explicable reasons. She had
assisted, after luncheon, at another debate between Madame de Chantelle
and her confidant, and had surmised, when she withdrew from it, that
victory was permanently perched on Miss Painterâs banners.

âI donât know how she does it, unless itâs by the dead weight of her
convictions. She detests the French so that sheâd back up Owen even if she
knew nothing—or knew too much—of Miss Viner. She somehow
regards the match as a protest against the corruption of European morals.
I told Owen that was his great chance, and heâs made the most of it.â

âWhat a tactician you are! You make me feel that I hardly know the
rudiments of diplomacy,â Darrow smiled at her, abandoning himself to a
perilous sense of well-being.

She gave him back his smile. âIâm afraid I think nothing short of my own
happiness is worth wasting any diplomacy on!â

âThatâs why I mean to resign from the service of my country,â he rejoined
with a laugh of deep content.

The feeling that both resistance and apprehension were vain was working
like wine in his veins. He had done what he could to deflect the course of
events: now he could only stand aside and take his chance of safety.
Underneath this fatalistic feeling was the deep sense of relief that he
had, after all, said and done nothing that could in the least degree
affect the welfare of Sophy Viner. That fact took a millstone off his
neck.

Meanwhile he gave himself up once more to the joy of Annaâs presence. They
had not been alone together for two long days, and he had the loverâs
sense that he had forgotten, or at least underestimated, the strength of
the spell she cast. Once more her eyes and her smile seemed to bound his
world. He felt that their light would always move with him as the sunset
moves before a ship at sea.

The next day his sense of security was increased by a decisive incident.
It became known to the expectant household that Madame de Chantelle had
yielded to the tremendous impact of Miss Painterâs determination and that
Sophy Viner had been âsent forâ to the purple satin sitting-room.

At luncheon, Owenâs radiant countenance proclaimed the happy sequel, and
Darrow, when the party had moved back to the oak-room for coffee, deemed
it discreet to wander out alone to the terrace with his cigar. The
conclusion of Owenâs romance brought his own plans once more to the front.
Anna had promised that she would consider dates and settle details as soon
as Madame de Chantelle and her grandson had been reconciled, and Darrow
was eager to go into the question at once, since it was necessary that the
preparations for his marriage should go forward as rapidly as possible.
Anna, he knew, would not seek any farther pretext for delay; and he
strolled up and down contentedly in the sunshine, certain that she would
come out and reassure him as soon as the reunited family had claimed its
due share of her attention.

But when she finally joined him her first word was for the younger lovers.

âI want to thank you for what youâve done for Owen,â she began, with her
happiest smile.

âWho—I?â he laughed. âAre you confusing me with Miss Painter?â

âPerhaps I ought to say for
me
,â she corrected herself. âYouâve been even
more of a help to us than Adelaide.â

âMy dear child! What on earth have I done?â

âYouâve managed to hide from Madame de Chantelle that you donât really
like poor Sophy.â

Darrow felt the pallour in his cheek. âNot like her? What put such an idea
into your head?â

âOh, itâs more than an idea—itâs a feeling. But what difference does
it make, after all? You saw her in such a different setting that itâs
natural you should be a little doubtful. But when you know her better Iâm
sure youâll feel about her as I do.â

âItâs going to be hard for me not to feel about everything as you do.â

âWell, then—please begin with my daughter-in-law!â

He gave her back in the same tone of banter: âAgreed: if youâll agree to
feel as I do about the pressing necessity of our getting married.â

âI want to talk to you about that too. You donât know what a weight is off
my mind! With Sophy here for good, I shall feel so differently about
leaving Effie. Iâve seen much more accomplished governesses—to my
cost!—but Iâve never seen a young thing more gay and kind and human.
You must have noticed, though youâve seen them so little together, how
Effie expands when sheâs with her. And that, you know, is what I want.
Madame de Chantelle will provide the necessary restraint.â She clasped her
hands on his arm. âYes, Iâm ready to go with you now. But first of all—this
very moment!—you must come with me to Effie. She knows, of course,
nothing of whatâs been happening; and I want her to be told first about

you
.â

Effie, sought throughout the house, was presently traced to the
school-room, and thither Darrow mounted with Anna. He had never seen her
so alight with happiness, and he had caught her buoyancy of mood. He kept
repeating to himself: âItâs over—itâs over,â as if some monstrous
midnight hallucination had been routed by the return of day.

As they approached the school-room door the terrierâs barks came to them
through laughing remonstrances.

âSheâs giving him his dinner,â Anna whispered, her hand in Darrowâs.

âDonât forget the gold-fish!â they heard another voice call out.

Darrow halted on the threshold. âOh—not now!â

âNot now?â

âI mean—sheâd rather have you tell her first. Iâll wait for you both
downstairs.â

He was aware that she glanced at him intently. âAs you please. Iâll bring
her down at once.â

She opened the door, and as she went in he heard her say: âNo, Sophy,
donât go! I want you both.â

The rest of Darrowâs day was a succession of empty and agitating scenes.
On his way down to Givre, before he had seen Effie Leath, he had pictured
somewhat sentimentally the joy of the moment when he should take her in
his arms and receive her first filial kiss. Everything in him that
egotistically craved for rest, stability, a comfortably organized
middle-age, all the home-building instincts of the man who has
sufficiently wooed and wandered, combined to throw a charm about the
figure of the child who might—who should—have been his. Effie
came to him trailing the cloud of glory of his first romance, giving him
back the magic hour he had missed and mourned. And how different the
realization of his dream had been! The childâs radiant welcome, her
unquestioning acceptance of, this new figure in the family group, had been
all that he had hoped and fancied. If Mother was so awfully happy about
it, and Owen and Granny, too, how nice and cosy and comfortable it was
going to be for all of them, her beaming look seemed to say; and then,
suddenly, the small pink fingers he had been kissing were laid on the one
flaw in the circle, on the one point which must be settled before Effie
could, with complete unqualified assurance, admit the new-comer to full
equality with the other gods of her Olympus.

âAnd is Sophy awfully happy about it too?â she had asked, loosening her
hold on Darrowâs neck to tilt back her head and include her mother in her
questioning look.

âWhy, dearest, didnât you see she was?â Anna had exclaimed, leaning to the
group with radiant eyes.

âI think I should like to ask her,â the child rejoined, after a minuteâs
shy consideration; and as Darrow set her down her mother laughed: âDo,
darling, do! Run off at once, and tell her we expect her to be awfully
happy too.â

The scene had been succeeded by others less poignant but almost as trying.
Darrow cursed his luck in having, at such a moment, to run the gauntlet of
a houseful of interested observers. The state of being âengagedâ, in
itself an absurd enough predicament, even to a man only intermittently
exposed, became intolerable under the continuous scrutiny of a small
circle quivering with participation. Darrow was furthermore aware that,
though the case of the other couple ought to have made his own less
conspicuous, it was rather they who found a refuge in the shadow of his
prominence. Madame de Chantelle, though she had consented to Owenâs
engagement and formally welcomed his betrothed, was nevertheless not sorry
to show, by her reception of Darrow, of what finely-shaded degrees of
cordiality she was capable. Miss Painter, having won the day for Owen, was
also free to turn her attention to the newer candidate for her sympathy;
and Darrow and Anna found themselves immersed in a warm bath of
sentimental curiosity.

It was a relief to Darrow that he was under a positive obligation to end
his visit within the next forty-eight hours. When he left London, his
Ambassador had accorded him a ten daysâ leave. His fate being definitely
settled and openly published he had no reason for asking to have the time
prolonged, and when it was over he was to return to his post till the time
fixed for taking up his new duties. Anna and he had therefore decided to
be married, in Paris, a day or two before the departure of the steamer
which was to take them to South America; and Anna, shortly after his
return to England, was to go up to Paris and begin her own preparations.

In honour of the double betrothal Effie and Miss Viner were to appear that
evening at dinner; and Darrow, on leaving his room, met the little girl
springing down the stairs, her white ruffles and coral-coloured bows
making her look like a daisy with her yellow hair for its centre. Sophy
Viner was behind her pupil, and as she came into the light Darrow noticed
a change in her appearance and wondered vaguely why she looked suddenly
younger, more vivid, more like the little luminous ghost of his Paris
memories. Then it occurred to him that it was the first time she had
appeared at dinner since his arrival at Givre, and the first time,
consequently, that he had seen her in evening dress. She was still at the
age when the least adornment embellishes; and no doubt the mere uncovering
of her young throat and neck had given her back her former brightness. But
a second glance showed a more precise reason for his impression. Vaguely
though he retained such details, he felt sure she was wearing the dress he
had seen her in every evening in Paris. It was a simple enough dress,
black, and transparent on the arms and shoulders, and he would probably
not have recognized it if she had not called his attention to it in Paris
by confessing that she hadnât any other. âThe same dress? That proves that
sheâs forgotten!â was his first half-ironic thought; but the next moment,
with a pang of compunction, he said to himself that she had probably put
it on for the same reason as before: simply because she hadnât any other.

He looked at her in silence, and for an instant, above Effieâs bobbing
head, she gave him back his look in a full bright gaze.

âOh, thereâs Owen!â Effie cried, and whirled away down the gallery to the
door from which her step-brother was emerging. As Owen bent to catch her,
Sophy Viner turned abruptly back to Darrow.

âYou, too?â she said with a quick laugh. âI didnât know——â And
as Owen came up to them she added, in a tone that might have been meant to
reach his ear: âI wish you all the luck that we can spare!â

About the dinner-table, which Effie, with Miss Vinerâs aid, had lavishly
garlanded, the little party had an air of somewhat self-conscious
festivity. In spite of flowers, champagne and a unanimous attempt at ease,
there were frequent lapses in the talk, and moments of nervous groping for
new subjects. Miss Painter alone seemed not only unaffected by the general
perturbation but as tightly sealed up in her unconsciousness of it as a
diver in his bell. To Darrowâs strained attention even Owenâs gusts of
gaiety seemed to betray an inward sense of insecurity. After dinner,
however, at the piano, he broke into a mood of extravagant hilarity and
flooded the room with the splash and ripple of his music.

Darrow, sunk in a sofa corner in the lee of Miss Painterâs granite bulk,
smoked and listened in silence, his eyes moving from one figure to
another. Madame de Chantelle, in her armchair near the fire, clasped her
little granddaughter to her with the gesture of a drawing-room Niobe, and
Anna, seated near them, had fallen into one of the attitudes of vivid calm
which seemed to Darrow to express her inmost quality. Sophy Viner, after
moving uncertainly about the room, had placed herself beyond Mrs. Leath,
in a chair near the piano, where she sat with head thrown back and eyes
attached to the musician, in the same rapt fixity of attention with which
she had followed the players at the FranÃ§ais. The accident of her having
fallen into the same attitude, and of her wearing the same dress, gave
Darrow, as he watched her, a strange sense of double consciousness. To
escape from it, his glance turned back to Anna; but from the point at
which he was placed his eyes could not take in the one face without the
other, and that renewed the disturbing duality of the impression. Suddenly
Owen broke off with a crash of chords and jumped to his feet.

âWhatâs the use of this, with such a moon to say it for us?â

Behind the uncurtained window a low golden orb hung like a ripe fruit
against the glass.

âYes—letâs go out and listen,â Anna answered. Owen threw open the
window, and with his gesture a fold of the heavy star-sprinkled sky seemed
to droop into the room like a drawn-in curtain. The air that entered with
it had a frosty edge, and Anna bade Effie run to the hall for wraps.

Darrow said: âYou must have one too,â and started toward the door; but
Sophy, following her pupil, cried back: âWeâll bring things for
everybody.â

Owen had followed her, and in a moment the three reappeared, and the party
went out on the terrace. The deep blue purity of the night was unveiled by
mist, and the moonlight rimmed the edges of the trees with a silver blur
and blanched to unnatural whiteness the statues against their walls of
shade.

Darrow and Anna, with Effie between them, strolled to the farther corner
of the terrace. Below them, between the fringes of the park, the lawn
sloped dimly to the fields above the river. For a few minutes they stood
silently side by side, touched to peace beneath the trembling beauty of
the sky. When they turned back, Darrow saw that Owen and Sophy Viner, who
had gone down the steps to the garden, were also walking in the direction
of the house. As they advanced, Sophy paused in a patch of moonlight,
between the sharp shadows of the yews, and Darrow noticed that she had
thrown over her shoulders a long cloak of some light colour, which
suddenly evoked her image as she had entered the restaurant at his side on
the night of their first dinner in Paris. A moment later they were all
together again on the terrace, and when they re-entered the drawing-room
the older ladies were on their way to bed.

Effie, emboldened by the privileges of the evening, was for coaxing Owen
to round it off with a game of forfeits or some such reckless climax; but
Sophy, resuming her professional role, sounded the summons to bed. In her
pupilâs wake she made her round of good-nights; but when she proffered her
hand to Anna, the latter ignoring the gesture held out both arms.

âGood-night, dear child,â she said impulsively, and drew the girl to her
kiss.

BOOK IV

XXIII

The next day was Darrowâs last at Givre and, foreseeing that the afternoon
and evening would have to be given to the family, he had asked Anna to
devote an early hour to the final consideration of their plans. He was to
meet her in the brown sitting-room at ten, and they were to walk down to
the river and talk over their future in the little pavilion abutting on
the wall of the park.

It was just a week since his arrival at Givre, and Anna wished, before he
left, to return to the place where they had sat on their first afternoon
together. Her sensitiveness to the appeal of inanimate things, to the
colour and texture of whatever wove itself into the substance of her
emotion, made her want to hear Darrowâs voice, and to feel his eyes on
her, in the spot where bliss had first flowed into her heart.

That bliss, in the interval, had wound itself into every fold of her
being. Passing, in the first days, from a high shy tenderness to the rush
of a secret surrender, it had gradually widened and deepened, to flow on
in redoubled beauty. She thought she now knew exactly how and why she
loved Darrow, and she could see her whole sky reflected in the deep and
tranquil current of her love.

Early the next day, in her sitting-room, she was glancing through the
letters which it was Effieâs morning privilege to carry up to her. Effie
meanwhile circled inquisitively about the room, where there was always
something new to engage her infant fancy; and Anna, looking up, saw her
suddenly arrested before a photograph of Darrow which, the day before, had
taken its place on the writing-table.

Anna held out her arms with a faint blush. âYou do like him, donât you,
dear?â

âOh, most awfully, dearest,â Effie, against her breast, leaned back to
assure her with a limpid look. âAnd so do Granny and Owen—and I
do

think Sophy does too,â she added, after a momentâs earnest pondering.

âI hope so,â Anna laughed. She checked the impulse to continue: âHas she
talked to you about him, that youâre so sure?â She did not know what had
made the question spring to her lips, but she was glad she had closed them
before pronouncing it. Nothing could have been more distasteful to her
than to clear up such obscurities by turning on them the tiny flame of her
daughterâs observation. And what, after all, now that Owenâs happiness was
secured, did it matter if there were certain reserves in Darrowâs approval
of his marriage?

A knock on the door made Anna glance at the clock. âThereâs Nurse to carry
you off.â

âItâs Sophyâs knock,â the little girl answered, jumping down to open the
door; and Miss Viner in fact stood on the threshold.

âCome in,â Anna said with a smile, instantly remarking how pale she
looked.

âMay Effie go out for a turn with Nurse?â the girl asked. âI should like
to speak to you a moment.â

âOf course. This ought to be
your
holiday, as yesterday was Effieâs. Run
off, dear,â she added, stooping to kiss the little girl.

When the door had closed she turned back to Sophy Viner with a look that
sought her confidence. âIâm so glad you came, my dear. Weâve got so many
things to talk about, just you and I together.â

The confused intercourse of the last days had, in fact, left little time
for any speech with Sophy but such as related to her marriage and the
means of overcoming Madame de Chantelleâs opposition to it. Anna had
exacted of Owen that no one, not even Sophy Viner, should be given a hint
of her own projects till all contingent questions had been disposed of.
She had felt, from the outset, a secret reluctance to intrude her securer
happiness on the doubts and fears of the young pair.

From the sofa-corner to which she had dropped back she pointed to Darrowâs
chair. âCome and sit by me, dear. I wanted to see you alone. Thereâs so
much to say that I hardly know where to begin.â

She leaned forward, her hands clasped on the arms of the sofa, her eyes
bent smilingly on Sophyâs. As she did so, she noticed that the girlâs
unusual pallour was partly due to the slight veil of powder on her face.
The discovery was distinctly disagreeable. Anna had never before noticed,
on Sophyâs part, any recourse to cosmetics, and, much as she wished to
think herself exempt from old-fashioned prejudices, she suddenly became
aware that she did not like her daughterâs governess to have a powdered
face. Then she reflected that the girl who sat opposite her was no longer
Effieâs governess, but her own future daughter-in-law; and she wondered
whether Miss Viner had chosen this odd way of celebrating her
independence, and whether, as Mrs. Owen Leath, she would present to the
world a bedizened countenance. This idea was scarcely less distasteful
than the other, and for a moment Anna continued to consider her without
speaking. Then, in a flash, the truth came to her: Miss Viner had powdered
her face because Miss Viner had been crying.

Anna leaned forward impulsively. âMy dear child, whatâs the matter?â She
saw the girlâs blood rush up under the white mask, and hastened on:
âPlease donât be afraid to tell me. I do so want you to feel that you can
trust me as Owen does. And you know you mustnât mind if, just at first,
Madame de Chantelle occasionally relapses.â

She spoke eagerly, persuasively, almost on a note of pleading. She had, in
truth, so many reasons for wanting Sophy to like her: her love for Owen,
her solicitude for Effie, and her own sense of the girlâs fine mettle. She
had always felt a romantic and almost humble admiration for those members
of her sex who, from force of will, or the constraint of circumstances,
had plunged into the conflict from which fate had so persistently excluded
her. There were even moments when she fancied herself vaguely to blame for
her immunity, and felt that she ought somehow to have affronted the perils
and hardships which refused to come to her. And now, as she sat looking at
Sophy Viner, so small, so slight, so visibly defenceless and undone, she
still felt, through all the superiority of her worldly advantages and her
seeming maturity, the same odd sense of ignorance and inexperience. She
could not have said what there was in the girlâs manner and expression to
give her this feeling, but she was reminded, as she looked at Sophy Viner,
of the other girls she had known in her youth, the girls who seemed
possessed of a secret she had missed. Yes, Sophy Viner had their look—almost
the obscurely menacing look of Kitty Mayne.... Anna, with an inward smile,
brushed aside the image of this forgotten rival. But she had felt, deep
down, a twinge of the old pain, and she was sorry that, even for the flash
of a thought, Owenâs betrothed should have reminded her of so different a
woman...

She laid her hand on the girlâs. âWhen his grandmother sees how happy Owen
is sheâll be quite happy herself. If itâs only that, donât be distressed.
Just trust to Owen—and the future.â

Sophy Viner, with an almost imperceptible recoil of her whole slight
person, had drawn her hand from under the palm enclosing it.

âThatâs what I wanted to talk to you about—the future.â

âOf course! Weâve all so many plans to make—and to fit into each
otherâs. Please letâs begin with yours.â

The girl paused a moment, her hands clasped on the arms of her chair, her
lids dropped under Annaâs gaze; then she said: âI should like to make no
plans at all ... just yet...â

âNo plans?â

âNo—I should like to go away ... my friends the Farlows would let me
go to them...â Her voice grew firmer and she lifted her eyes to add: âI
should like to leave today, if you donât mind.â

Anna listened with a rising wonder.

âYou want to leave Givre at once?â She gave the idea a momentâs swift
consideration. âYou prefer to be with your friends till your marriage? I
understand that—but surely you neednât rush off today? There are so
many details to discuss; and before long, you know, I shall be going away
too.â

âYes, I know.â The girl was evidently trying to steady her voice. âBut I
should like to wait a few days—to have a little more time to
myself.â

Anna continued to consider her kindly. It was evident that she did not
care to say why she wished to leave Givre so suddenly, but her disturbed
face and shaken voice betrayed a more pressing motive than the natural
desire to spend the weeks before her marriage under her old friendsâ roof.
Since she had made no response to the allusion to Madame de Chantelle,
Anna could but conjecture that she had had a passing disagreement with
Owen; and if this were so, random interference might do more harm than
good.

âMy dear child, if you really want to go at once I shaânât, of course,
urge you to stay. I suppose you have spoken to Owen?â

âNo. Not yet...â

Anna threw an astonished glance at her. âYou mean to say you havenât told
him?â

âI wanted to tell you first. I thought I ought to, on account of Effie.â
Her look cleared as she put forth this reason.

âOh, Effie!—â Annaâs smile brushed away the scruple. âOwen has a
right to ask that you should consider him before you think of his
sister.... Of course you shall do just as you wish,â she went on, after
another thoughtful interval.

âOh, thank you,â Sophy Viner murmured and rose to her feet.

Anna rose also, vaguely seeking for some word that should break down the
girlâs resistance. âYouâll tell Owen at once?â she finally asked.

Miss Viner, instead of replying, stood before her in manifest uncertainty,
and as she did so there was a light tap on the door, and Owen Leath walked
into the room.

Annaâs first glance told her that his face was unclouded. He met her
greeting with his happiest smile and turned to lift Sophyâs hand to his
lips. The perception that he was utterly unconscious of any cause for Miss
Vinerâs agitation came to his step-mother with a sharp thrill of surprise.

âDarrowâs looking for you,â he said to her. âHe asked me to remind you
that youâd promised to go for a walk with him.â

Anna glanced at the clock. âIâll go down presently.â She waited and looked
again at Sophy Viner, whose troubled eyes seemed to commit their message
to her. âYouâd better tell Owen, my dear.â

Owenâs look also turned on the girl. âTell me what? Why, whatâs happened?â

Anna summoned a laugh to ease the vague tension of the moment. âDonât look
so startled! Nothing, except that Sophy proposes to desert us for a while
for the Farlows.â

Owenâs brow cleared. âI was afraid sheâd run off before long.â He glanced
at Anna. âDo please keep her here as long as you can!â

Sophy intervened: âMrs. Leathâs already given me leave to go.â

âAlready? To go when?â

âToday,â said Sophy in a low tone, her eyes on Annaâs.

âToday? Why on earth should you go today?â Owen dropped back a step or
two, flushing and paling under his bewildered frown. His eyes seemed to
search the girl more closely. âSomethingâs happened.â He too looked at his
step-mother. âI suppose she must have told you what it is?â

Anna was struck by the suddenness and vehemence of his appeal. It was as
though some smouldering apprehension had lain close under the surface of
his security.

âSheâs told me nothing except that she wishes to be with her friends. Itâs
quite natural that she should want to go to them.â

Owen visibly controlled himself. âOf course—quite natural.â He spoke
to Sophy. âBut why didnât you tell me so? Why did you come first to my
step-mother?â

Anna intervened with her calm smile. âThat seems to me quite natural, too.
Sophy was considerate enough to tell me first because of Effie.â

He weighed it. âVery well, then: thatâs quite natural, as you say. And of
course she must do exactly as she pleases.â He still kept his eyes on the
girl. âTomorrow,â he abruptly announced, âI shall go up to Paris to see
you.â

âOh, no—no!â she protested.

Owen turned back to Anna. â
Now
do you say that nothingâs happened?â

Under the influence of his agitation Anna felt a vague tightening of the
heart. She seemed to herself like some one in a dark room about whom
unseen presences are groping.

âIf itâs anything that Sophy wishes to tell you, no doubt sheâll do so.
Iâm going down now, and Iâll leave you here to talk it over by
yourselves.â

As she moved to the door the girl caught up with her. âBut thereâs nothing
to tell: why should there be? Iâve explained that I simply want to be
quiet.â Her look seemed to detain Mrs. Leath.

Owen broke in: âIs that why I maynât go up tomorrow?â

âNot tomorrow!â

âThen when may I?â

âLater ... in a little while ... a few days...â

âIn how many days?â âOwen!â his step-mother interposed; but he seemed no
longer aware of her. âIf you go away today, the day that our engagementâs
made known, itâs only fair,â he persisted, âthat you should tell me when I
am to see you.â

Sophyâs eyes wavered between the two and dropped down wearily. âItâs you
who are not fair—when Iâve said I wanted to be quiet.â

âBut why should my coming disturb you? Iâm not asking now to come
tomorrow. I only ask you not to leave without telling me when Iâm to see
you.â

âOwen, I donât understand you!â his step-mother exclaimed.

âYou donât understand my asking for some explanation, some assurance, when
Iâm left in this way, without a word, without a sign? All I ask her to
tell me is when sheâll see me.â

Anna turned back to Sophy Viner, who stood straight and tremulous between
the two.

âAfter all, my dear, heâs not unreasonable!â

âIâll write—Iâll write,â the girl repeated.

âWHAT will you write?â he pressed her vehemently.

âOwen,â Anna exclaimed, âyou are unreasonable!â

He turned from Sophy to his step-mother. âI only want her to say what she
means: that sheâs going to write to break off our engagement. Isnât that
what youâre going away for?â

Anna felt the contagion of his excitement. She looked at Sophy, who stood
motionless, her lips set, her whole face drawn to a silent fixity of
resistance.

âYou ought to speak, my dear—you ought to answer him.â

âI only ask him to wait——â

âYes,â Owen, broke in, âand you wonât say how long!â

Both instinctively addressed themselves to Anna, who stood, nearly as
shaken as themselves, between the double shock of their struggle. She
looked again from Sophyâs inscrutable eyes to Owenâs stormy features; then
she said: âWhat can I do, when thereâs clearly something between you that
I donât know about?â

âOh, if it
were
between us! Canât you see itâs outside of us—outside
of her, dragging at her, dragging her away from me?â Owen wheeled round
again upon his step-mother.

Anna turned from him to the girl. âIs it true that you want to break your
engagement? If you do, you ought to tell him now.â

Owen burst into a laugh. âShe doesnât dare to—sheâs afraid Iâll
guess the reason!â

A faint sound escaped from Sophyâs lips, but she kept them close on
whatever answer she had ready.

âIf she doesnât wish to marry you, why should she be afraid to have you
know the reason?â

âSheâs afraid to have
you
know it—not me!â

âTo have
me
know it?â

He laughed again, and Anna, at his laugh, felt a sudden rush of
indignation.

âOwen, you must explain what you mean!â

He looked at her hard before answering; then: âAsk Darrow!â he said.

âOwen—Owen!â Sophy Viner murmured.

XXIV

Anna stood looking from one to the other. It had become apparent to her in
a flash that Owenâs retort, though it startled Sophy, did not take her by
surprise; and the discovery shot its light along dark distances of fear.

The immediate inference was that Owen had guessed the reason of Darrowâs
disapproval of his marriage, or that, at least, he suspected Sophy Viner
of knowing and dreading it. This confirmation of her own obscure doubt
sent a tremor of alarm through Anna. For a moment she felt like
exclaiming: âAll this is really no business of mine, and I refuse to have
you mix me up in it—â but her secret fear held her fast.

Sophy Viner was the first to speak.

âI should like to go now,â she said in a low voice, taking a few steps
toward the door.

Her tone woke Anna to the sense of her own share in the situation. âI
quite agree with you, my dear, that itâs useless to carry on this
discussion. But since Mr. Darrowâs name has been brought into it, for
reasons which I fail to guess, I want to tell you that youâre both
mistaken if you think heâs not in sympathy with your marriage. If thatâs
what Owen means to imply, the ideaâs a complete delusion.â

She spoke the words deliberately and incisively, as if hoping that the
sound of their utterance would stifle the whisper in her bosom.

Sophyâs only answer was a vague murmur, and a movement that brought her
nearer to the door; but before she could reach it Owen had placed himself
in her way.

âI donât mean to imply what you think,â he said, addressing his
step-mother but keeping his eyes on the girl. âI donât say Darrow doesnât
like our marriage; I say itâs Sophy whoâs hated it since Darrowâs been
here!â

He brought out the charge in a tone of forced composure, but his lips were
white and he grasped the doorknob to hide the tremor of his hand.

Annaâs anger surged up with her fears. âYouâre absurd, Owen! I donât know
why I listen to you. Why should Sophy dislike Mr. Darrow, and if she does,
why should that have anything to do with her wishing to break her
engagement?â

âI donât say she dislikes him! I donât say she likes him; I donât know
what it is they say to each other when theyâre shut up together alone.â

âShut up together alone?â Anna stared. Owen seemed like a man in delirium;
such an exhibition was degrading to them all. But he pushed on without
seeing her look.

âYes—the first evening she came, in the study; the next morning,
early, in the park; yesterday, again, in the spring-house, when you were
at the lodge with the doctor.... I donât know what they say to each other,
but theyâve taken every chance they could to say it ... and to say it when
they thought that no one saw them.â

Anna longed to silence him, but no words came to her. It was as though all
her confused apprehensions had suddenly taken definite shape. There was
âsomethingâ—yes, there was âsomethingâ...Darrowâs reticences and
evasions had been more than a figment of her doubts.

The next instant brought a recoil of pride. She turned indignantly on her
step-son.

âI donât half understand what youâve been saying; but what you seem to
hint is so preposterous, and so insulting both to Sophy and to me, that I
see no reason why we should listen to you any longer.â

Though her tone steadied Owen, she perceived at once that it would not
deflect him from his purpose. He spoke less vehemently, but with all the
more precision.

âHow can it be preposterous, since itâs true? Or insulting, since I donât
know, any more than
you
, the meaning of what Iâve been seeing? If youâll
be patient with me Iâll try to put it quietly. What I mean is that Sophy
has completely changed since she met Darrow here, and that, having noticed
the change, Iâm hardly to blame for having tried to find out its cause.â

Anna made an effort to answer him with the same composure. âYouâre to
blame, at any rate, for so recklessly assuming that you
have
found it out.
You seem to forget that, till they met here, Sophy and Mr. Darrow hardly
knew each other.â

âIf so, itâs all the stranger that theyâve been so often closeted
together!â

âOwen, Owen—â the girl sighed out.

He turned his haggard face to her. âCan I help it, if Iâve seen and known
what I wasnât meant to? For Godâs sake give me a reason—any reason I
can decently make out with! Is it my fault if, the day after you arrived,
when I came back late through the garden, the curtains of the study hadnât
been drawn, and I saw you there alone with Darrow?â

Anna laughed impatiently. âReally, Owen, if you make it a grievance that
two people who are staying in the same house should be seen talking
together——!â

âThey were not talking. Thatâs the point——â

âNot talking? How do you know? You could hardly hear them from the
garden!â

âNo; but I could see.
he
was sitting at my desk, with his face in his
hands.
she
was standing in the window, looking away from him...â

He waited, as if for Sophy Vinerâs answer; but still she neither stirred
nor spoke.

âThat was the first time,â he went on; âand the second was the next
morning in the park. It was natural enough, their meeting there. Sophy had
gone out with Effie, and Effie ran back to look for me. She told me sheâd
left Sophy and Darrow in the path that leads to the river, and presently
we saw them ahead of us. They didnât see us at first, because they were
standing looking at each other; and this time they were not speaking
either. We came up close before they heard us, and all that time they
never spoke, or stopped looking at each other. After that I began to
wonder; and so I watched them.â

âOh, Owen!â âOh, I only had to wait. Yesterday, when I motored you and the
doctor back from the lodge, I saw Sophy coming out of the spring-house. I
supposed sheâd taken shelter from the rain, and when you got out of the
motor I strolled back down the avenue to meet her. But sheâd disappeared—she
must have taken a short cut and come into the house by the side door. I
donât know why I went on to the spring-house; I suppose it was what youâd
call spying. I went up the steps and found the room empty; but two chairs
had been moved out from the wall and were standing near the table; and one
of the Chinese screens that lie on it had dropped to the floor.â

Anna sounded a faint note of irony. âReally? Sophyâd gone there for
shelter, and she dropped a screen and moved a chair?â

âI said two chairs——â

âTwo? What damning evidence—of I donât know what!â

âSimply of the fact that Darrowâd been there with her. As I looked out of
the window I saw him close by, walking away. He must have turned the
corner of the spring-house just as I got to the door.â

There was another silence, during which Anna paused, not only to collect
her own words but to wait for Sophy Vinerâs; then, as the girl made no
sign, she turned to her.

âIâve absolutely nothing to say to all this; but perhaps youâd like me to
wait and hear your answer?â

Sophy raised her head with a quick flash of colour. âIâve no answer either—except
that Owen must be mad.â

In the interval since she had last spoken she seemed to have regained her
self-control, and her voice rang clear, with a cold edge of anger.

Anna looked at her step-son. He had grown extremely pale, and his hand
fell from the door with a discouraged gesture. âThatâs all then? You wonât
give me any reason?â

âI didnât suppose it was necessary to give you or any one else a reason
for talking with a friend of Mrs. Leathâs under Mrs. Leathâs own roof.â

Owen hardly seemed to feel the retort: he kept his dogged stare on her
face.

âI wonât ask for one, then. Iâll only ask you to give me your assurance
that your talks with Darrow have had nothing to do with your suddenly
deciding to leave Givre.â

She hesitated, not so much with the air of weighing her answer as of
questioning his right to exact any. âI give you my assurance; and now I
should like to go,â she said.

As she turned away, Anna intervened. âMy dear, I think you ought to
speak.â

The girl drew herself up with a faint laugh. âTo him—or to
you
?â

âTo him.â

She stiffened. âIâve said all there is to say.â

Anna drew back, her eyes on her step-son. He had left the threshold and
was advancing toward Sophy Viner with a motion of desperate appeal; but as
he did so there was a knock on the door. A momentâs silence fell on the
three; then Anna said: âCome in!â

Darrow came into the room. Seeing the three together, he looked rapidly
from one to the other; then he turned to Anna with a smile.

âI came up to see if you were ready; but please send me off if Iâm not
wanted.â

His look, his voice, the simple sense of his presence, restored Annaâs
shaken balance. By Owenâs side he looked so strong, so urbane, so
experienced, that the ladâs passionate charges dwindled to mere boyish
vapourings. A moment ago she had dreaded Darrowâs coming; now she was glad
that he was there.

She turned to him with sudden decision. âCome in, please; I want you to
hear what Owen has been saying.â

She caught a murmur from Sophy Viner, but disregarded it. An illuminating
impulse urged her on. She, habitually so aware of her own lack of
penetration, her small skill in reading hidden motives and detecting
secret signals, now felt herself mysteriously inspired. She addressed
herself to Sophy Viner. âItâs much better for you both that this absurd
question should be cleared up now.â Then, turning to Darrow, she
continued: âFor some reason that I donât pretend to guess, Owen has taken
it into his head that youâve influenced Miss Viner to break her
engagement.â

She spoke slowly and deliberately, because she wished to give time and to
gain it; time for Darrow and Sophy to receive the full impact of what she
was saying, and time to observe its full effect on them. She had said to
herself: âIf thereâs nothing between them, theyâll look at each other; if
there
is
something, they wonât;â and as she ceased to speak she felt as if
all her life were in her eyes.

Sophy, after a start of protest, remained motionless, her gaze on the
ground. Darrow, his face grown grave, glanced slowly from Owen Leath to
Anna. With his eyes on the latter he asked: âHas Miss Viner broken her
engagement?â

A momentâs silence followed his question; then the girl looked up and
said: âYes!â

Owen, as she spoke, uttered a smothered exclamation and walked out of the
room. She continued to stand in the same place, without appearing to
notice his departure, and without vouchsafing an additional word of
explanation; then, before Anna could find a cry to detain her, she too
turned and went out.

âFor Godâs sake, whatâs happened?â Darrow asked; but Anna, with a drop of
the heart, was saying to herself that he and Sophy Viner had not looked at
each other.

XXV

Anna stood in the middle of the room, her eyes on the door. Darrowâs
questioning gaze was still on her, and she said to herself with a
quick-drawn breath: âIf only he doesnât come near me!â

It seemed to her that she had been suddenly endowed with the fatal gift of
reading the secret sense of every seemingly spontaneous look and movement,
and that in his least gesture of affection she would detect a cold design.

For a moment longer he continued to look at her enquiringly; then he
turned away and took up his habitual stand by the mantel-piece. She drew a
deep breath of relief.

âWonât you please explain?â he said.

âI canât explain: I donât know. I didnât even know—till she told you—that
she really meant to break her engagement. All I know is that she came to
me just now and said she wished to leave Givre today; and that Owen, when
he heard of it—for she hadnât told him—at once accused her of
going away with the secret intention of throwing him over.â

âAnd you think itâs a definite break?â She perceived, as she spoke, that
his brow had cleared.

âHow should I know? Perhaps you can tell me.â

âI?â She fancied his face clouded again, but he did not move from his
tranquil attitude.

âAs I told you,â she went on, âOwen has worked himself up to imagining
that for some mysterious reason youâve influenced Sophy against him.â

Darrow still visibly wondered. âIt must indeed be a mysterious reason! He
knows how slightly I know Miss Viner. Why should he imagine anything so
wildly improbable?â

âI donât know that either.â

âBut he must have hinted at some reason.â

âNo: he admits he doesnât know your reason. He simply says that Sophyâs
manner to him has changed since she came back to Givre and that heâs seen
you together several times—in the park, the spring-house, I donât
know where—talking alone in a way that seemed confidential—almost
secret; and he draws the preposterous conclusion that youâve used your
influence to turn her against him.â

âMy influence? What kind of influence?â

âHe doesnât say.â

Darrow again seemed to turn over the facts she gave him. His face remained
grave, but without the least trace of discomposure. âAnd what does Miss
Viner say?â

âShe says itâs perfectly natural that she should occasionally talk to my
friends when sheâs under my roof—and refuses to give him any other
explanation.â

âThat at least is perfectly natural!â

Anna felt her cheeks flush as she answered: âYes—but there is
something——â

âSomething——?â

âSome reason for her sudden decision to break her engagement. I can
understand Owenâs feeling, sorry as I am for his way of showing it. The
girl owes him some sort of explanation, and as long as she refuses to give
it his imagination is sure to run wild.â

âShe would have given it, no doubt, if heâd asked it in a different tone.â

âI donât defend Owenâs tone—but she knew what it was before she
accepted him. She knows heâs excitable and undisciplined.â

âWell, sheâs been disciplining him a little—probably the best thing
that could happen. Why not let the matter rest there?â

âLeave Owen with the idea that you
have
been the cause of the break?â

He met the question with his easy smile. âOh, as to that—leave him
with any idea of me he chooses! But leave him, at any rate, free.â

âFree?â she echoed in surprise.

âSimply let things be. Youâve surely done all you could for him and Miss
Viner. If they donât hit it off itâs their own affair. What possible
motive can you have for trying to interfere now?â

Her gaze widened to a deeper wonder. âWhy—naturally, what he says of
you!â

âI donât care a straw what he says of me! In such a situation a boy in
love will snatch at the most far-fetched reason rather than face the
mortifying fact that the lady may simply be tired of him.â

âYou donât quite understand Owen. Things go deep with him, and last long.
It took him a long time to recover from his other unlucky love affair.
Heâs romantic and extravagant: he canât live on the interest of his
feelings. He worships Sophy and she seemed to be fond of him. If sheâs
changed itâs been very sudden. And if they part like this, angrily and
inarticulately, it will hurt him horribly—hurt his very soul. But
that, as you say, is between the two. What concerns me is his associating
you with their quarrel. Owenâs like my own son—if youâd seen him
when I first came here youâd know why. We were like two prisoners who talk
to each other by tapping on the wall. Heâs never forgotten it, nor I.
Whether he breaks with Sophy, or whether they make it up, I canât let him
think you had anything to do with it.â

She raised her eyes entreatingly to Darrowâs, and read in them the
forbearance of the man resigned to the discussion of non-existent
problems.

âIâll do whatever you want me to,â he said; âbut I donât yet know what it
is.â

His smile seemed to charge her with inconsequence, and the prick to her
pride made her continue: âAfter all, itâs not so unnatural that Owen,
knowing you and Sophy to be almost strangers, should wonder what you were
saying to each other when he saw you talking together.â

She felt a warning tremor as she spoke, as though some instinct deeper
than reason surged up in defense of its treasure. But Darrowâs face was
unstirred save by the flit of his half-amused smile.

âWell, my dear—and couldnât you have told him?â âI?â she faltered
out through her blush.

âYou seem to forget, one and all of you, the position you put me in when I
came down here: your appeal to me to see Owen through, your assurance to
him that I would, Madame de Chantelleâs attempt to win me over; and most
of all, my own sense of the fact youâve just recalled to me: the
importance, for both of us, that Owen should like me. It seemed to me that
the first thing to do was to get as much light as I could on the whole
situation; and the obvious way of doing it was to try to know Miss Viner
better. Of course Iâve talked with her alone—Iâve talked with her as
often as I could. Iâve tried my best to find out if you were right in
encouraging Owen to marry her.â

She listened with a growing sense of reassurance, struggling to separate
the abstract sense of his words from the persuasion in which his eyes and
voice enveloped them.

âI see—I do see,â she murmured.

âYou must see, also, that I could hardly say this to Owen without
offending him still more, and perhaps increasing the breach between Miss
Viner and himself. What sort of figure should I cut if I told him Iâd been
trying to find out if heâd made a proper choice? In any case, itâs none of
my business to offer an explanation of what she justly says doesnât need
one. If she declines to speak, itâs obviously on the ground that Owenâs
insinuations are absurd; and that surely pledges me to silence.â

âYes, yes! I see,â Anna repeated. âBut I donât want you to explain
anything to Owen.â

âYou havenât yet told me what you do want.â

She hesitated, conscious of the difficulty of justifying her request;
then: âI want you to speak to Sophy,â she said.

Darrow broke into an incredulous laugh. âConsidering what my previous
attempts have resulted in——!â

She raised her eyes quickly. âThey havenât, at least, resulted in your
liking her less, in your thinking less well of her than youâve told me?â

She fancied he frowned a little. âI wonder why you go back to that?â

âI want to be sure—I owe it to Owen. Wonât you tell me the exact
impression sheâs produced on you?â

âI have told you—I like Miss Viner.â

âDo you still believe sheâs in love with Owen?â

âThere was nothing in our short talks to throw any particular light on
that.â

âYou still believe, though, that thereâs no reason why he shouldnât marry
her?â

Again he betrayed a restrained impatience. âHow can I answer that without
knowing her reasons for breaking with him?â

âThatâs just what I want you to find out from her.â

âAnd why in the world should she tell me?â

âBecause, whatever grievance she has against Owen, she can certainly have
none against me. She canât want to have Owen connect me in his mind with
this wretched quarrel; and she must see that he will until heâs convinced
youâve had no share in it.â

Darrowâs elbow dropped from the mantel-piece and he took a restless step
or two across the room. Then he halted before her.

âWhy canât you tell her this yourself?â

âDonât you see?â

He eyed her intently, and she pressed on: âYou must have guessed that
Owenâs jealous of you.â

âJealous of me?â The blood flew up under his brown skin.

âBlind with it—what else would drive him to this folly? And I canât
have her think me jealous too! Iâve said all I could, short of making her
think so; and sheâs refused a word more to either of us. Our only chance
now is that she should listen to you—that you should make her see
the harm her silence may do.â

Darrow uttered a protesting exclamation. âItâs all too preposterous—what
you suggest! I canât, at any rate, appeal to her on such a ground as
that!â

Anna laid her hand on his arm. âAppeal to her on the ground that Iâm
almost Owenâs mother, and that any estrangement between you and him would
kill me. She knows what he is—sheâll understand. Tell her to say
anything, do anything, she wishes; but not to go away without speaking,
not to leave
that
between us when she goes!â

She drew back a step and lifted her face to his, trying to look into his
eyes more deeply than she had ever looked; but before she could discern
what they expressed he had taken hold of her hands and bent his head to
kiss them.

âYouâll see her? Youâll see her?â she entreated; and he answered: âIâll do
anything in the world you want me to.â

XXVI

Darrow waited alone in the sitting-room.

No place could have been more distasteful as the scene of the talk that
lay before him; but he had acceded to Annaâs suggestion that it would seem
more natural for her to summon Sophy Viner than for him to go in search of
her. As his troubled pacings carried him back and forth a relentless hand
seemed to be tearing away all the tender fibres of association that bound
him to the peaceful room. Here, in this very place, he had drunk his
deepest draughts of happiness, had had his lips at the fountain-head of
its overflowing rivers; but now that source was poisoned and he would
taste no more of an untainted cup.

For a moment he felt an actual physical anguish; then his nerves hardened
for the coming struggle. He had no notion of what awaited him; but after
the first instinctive recoil he had seen in a flash the urgent need of
another word with Sophy Viner. He had been insincere in letting Anna think
that he had consented to speak because she asked it. In reality he had
been feverishly casting about for the pretext she had given him; and for
some reason this trivial hypocrisy weighed on him more than all his heavy
burden of deceit.

At length he heard a step behind him and Sophy Viner entered. When she saw
him she paused on the threshold and half drew back.

âI was told that Mrs. Leath had sent for me.â

âMrs. Leath
did
send for you. Sheâll be here presently; but I asked her to
let me see you first.â

He spoke very gently, and there was no insincerity in his gentleness. He
was profoundly moved by the change in the girlâs appearance. At sight of
him she had forced a smile; but it lit up her wretchedness like a
candle-flame held to a dead face.

She made no reply, and Darrow went on: âYou must understand my wanting to
speak to you, after what I was told just now.â

She interposed, with a gesture of protest: âIâm not responsible for Owenâs
ravings!â

âOf course——â. He broke off and they stood facing each other.
She lifted a hand and pushed back her loose lock with the gesture that was
burnt into his memory; then she looked about her and dropped into the
nearest chair.

âWell, youâve got what you wanted,â she said.

âWhat do you mean by what I wanted?â

âMy engagementâs broken—you heard me say so.â

âWhy do you say thatâs what I wanted? All I wished, from the beginning,
was to advise you, to help you as best I could——â

âThatâs what youâve done,â she rejoined. âYouâve convinced me that itâs
best I shouldnât marry him.â

Darrow broke into a despairing laugh. âAt the very moment when youâd
convinced me to the contrary!â

âHad I?â Her smile flickered up. âWell, I really believed it till you
showed me ... warned me...â

âWarned you?â

âThat Iâd be miserable if I married a man I didnât love.â

âDonât you love him?â

She made no answer, and Darrow started up and walked away to the other end
of the room. He stopped before the writing-table, where his photograph,
well-dressed, handsome, self-sufficient—the portrait of a man of the
world, confident of his ability to deal adequately with the most delicate
situations—offered its huge fatuity to his gaze. He turned back to
her. âItâs rather hard on Owen, isnât it, that you should have waited
until now to tell him?â

She reflected a moment before answering. âI told him as soon as I knew.â

âKnew that you couldnât marry him?â

âKnew that I could never live here with him.â She looked about the room,
as though the very walls must speak for her.

For a moment Darrow continued to search her face perplexedly; then their
eyes met in a long disastrous gaze.

âYes——â she said, and stood up.

Below the window they heard Effie whistling for her dogs, and then, from
the terrace, her mother calling her.

âThere—
that
for instance,â Sophy Viner said.

Darrow broke out: âItâs I who ought to go!â

She kept her small pale smile. âWhat good would that do any of us—now?â

He covered his face with his hands. âGood God!â he groaned. âHow could I
tell?â

âYou couldnât tell. We neither of us could.â She seemed to turn the
problem over critically. âAfter all, it might have been
you
instead of
me!â

He took another distracted turn about the room and coming back to her sat
down in a chair at her side. A mocking hand seemed to dash the words from
his lips. There was nothing on earth that he could say to her that wasnât
foolish or cruel or contemptible...

âMy dear,â he began at last, âoughtnât you, at any rate, to try?â

Her gaze grew grave. âTry to forget you?â

He flushed to the forehead. âI meant, try to give Owen more time; to give
him a chance. Heâs madly in love with you; all the good thatâs in him is
in your hands. His step-mother felt that from the first. And she thought—she
believed——â

âShe thought I could make him happy. Would she think so now?â

âNow...? I donât say now. But later? Time modifies ... rubs out ... more
quickly than you think.... Go away, but let him hope.... Iâm going too—
weâre

going—â he stumbled on the plural—âin a very few weeks: going
for a long time, probably. What youâre thinking of now may never happen.
We may not all be here together again for years.â

She heard him out in silence, her hands clasped on her knee, her eyes bent
on them. âFor me,â she said, âyouâll always be here.â

âDonât say that—oh, donât! Things change ... people change.... Youâll
see!â

âYou donât understand. I donât want anything to change. I donât want to
forget—to rub out. At first I imagined I did; but that was a foolish
mistake. As soon as I saw you again I knew it.... Itâs not being here with
you that Iâm afraid of—in the sense you think. Itâs being here, or
anywhere, with Owen.â She stood up and bent her tragic smile on him. âI
want to keep you all to myself.â

The only words that came to him were futile denunciations of his folly;
but the sense of their futility checked them on his lips. âPoor child—you
poor child!â he heard himself vainly repeating.

Suddenly he felt the strong reaction of reality and its impetus brought
him to his feet. âWhatever happens, I intend to go—to go for good,â
he exclaimed. âI want you to understand that. Oh, donât be afraid—Iâll
find a reason. But itâs perfectly clear that I must go.â

She uttered a protesting cry. âGo away? You? Donât you see that that would
tell everything—drag everybody into the horror?â

He found no answer, and her voice dropped back to its calmer note. âWhat
good would your going do? Do you suppose it would change anything for me?â
She looked at him with a musing wistfulness. âI wonder what your feeling
for me was? It seems queer that Iâve never really known—I suppose we

donât
know much about that kind of feeling. Is it like taking a drink when
youâre thirsty?... I used to feel as if all of me was in the palm of your
hand...â

He bowed his humbled head, but she went on almost exultantly: âDonât for a
minute think Iâm sorry! It was worth every penny it cost. My mistake was
in being ashamed, just at first, of its having cost such a lot. I tried to
carry it off as a joke—to talk of it to myself as an âadventureâ.
Iâd always wanted adventures, and youâd given me one, and I tried to take
your attitude about it, to âplay the gameâ and convince myself that I
hadnât risked any more on it than you. Then, when I met you again, I
suddenly saw that I
had
risked more, but that Iâd won more, too—such
worlds! Iâd been trying all the while to put everything I could between
us; now I want to sweep everything away. Iâd been trying to forget how you
looked; now I want to remember you always. Iâd been trying not to hear
your voice; now I never want to hear any other. Iâve made my choice—thatâs
all: Iâve had you and I mean to keep you.â Her face was shining like her
eyes. âTo keep you hidden away here,â she ended, and put her hand upon her
breast.

After she had left him, Darrow continued to sit motionless, staring back
into their past. Hitherto it had lingered on the edge of his mind in a
vague pink blur, like one of the little rose-leaf clouds that a setting
sun drops from its disk. Now it was a huge looming darkness, through which
his eyes vainly strained. The whole episode was still obscure to him, save
where here and there, as they talked, some phrase or gesture or intonation
of the girlâs had lit up a little spot in the night.

She had said: âI wonder what your feeling for me was?â and he found
himself wondering too.... He remembered distinctly enough that he had not
meant the perilous passion—even in its most transient form—to
play a part in their relation. In that respect his attitude had been above
reproach. She was an unusually original and attractive creature, to whom
he had wanted to give a few days of harmless pleasuring, and who was alert
and expert enough to understand his intention and spare him the boredom of
hesitations and misinterpretations. That had been his first impression,
and her subsequent demeanour had justified it. She had been, from the
outset, just the frank and easy comrade he had expected to find her. Was
it he, then, who, in the sequel, had grown impatient of the bounds he had
set himself? Was it his wounded vanity that, seeking balm for its hurt,
yearned to dip deeper into the healing pool of her compassion? In his
confused memory of the situation he seemed not to have been guiltless of
such yearnings.... Yet for the first few days the experiment had been
perfectly successful. Her enjoyment had been unclouded and his pleasure in
it undisturbed. It was very gradually—he seemed to see—that a
shade of lassitude had crept over their intercourse. Perhaps it was
because, when her light chatter about people failed, he found she had no
other fund to draw on, or perhaps simply because of the sweetness of her
laugh, or of the charm of the gesture with which, one day in the woods of
Marly, she had tossed off her hat and tilted back her head at the call of
a cuckoo; or because, whenever he looked at her unexpectedly, he found
that she was looking at him and did not want him to know it; or perhaps,
in varying degrees, because of all these things, that there had come a
moment when no word seemed to fly high enough or dive deep enough to utter
the sense of well-being each gave to the other, and the natural substitute
for speech had been a kiss.

The kiss, at all events, had come at the precise moment to save their
venture from disaster. They had reached the point when her amazing
reminiscences had begun to flag, when her future had been exhaustively
discussed, her theatrical prospects minutely studied, her quarrel with
Mrs. Murrett retold with the last amplification of detail, and when,
perhaps conscious of her exhausted resources and his dwindling interest,
she had committed the fatal error of saying that she could see he was
unhappy, and entreating him to tell her why...

From the brink of estranging confidences, and from the risk of
unfavourable comparisons, his gesture had snatched her back to safety; and
as soon as he had kissed her he felt that she would never bore him again.
She was one of the elemental creatures whose emotion is all in their
pulses, and who become inexpressive or sentimental when they try to turn
sensation into speech. His caress had restored her to her natural place in
the scheme of things, and Darrow felt as if he had clasped a tree and a
nymph had bloomed from it...

The mere fact of not having to listen to her any longer added immensely to
her charm. She continued, of course, to talk to him, but it didnât matter,
because he no longer made any effort to follow her words, but let her
voice run on as a musical undercurrent to his thoughts.

She hadnât a drop of poetry in her, but she had some of the qualities that
create it in others; and in moments of heat the imagination does not
always feel the difference...

Lying beside her in the shade, Darrow felt her presence as a part of the
charmed stillness of the summer woods, as the element of vague well-being
that suffused his senses and lulled to sleep the ache of wounded pride.
All he asked of her, as yet, was a touch on the hand or on the lips—and
that she should let him go on lying there through the long warm hours,
while a black-birdâs song throbbed like a fountain, and the summer wind
stirred in the trees, and close by, between the nearest branches and the
brim of his tilted hat, a slight white figure gathered up all the floating
threads of joy...

He recalled, too, having noticed, as he lay staring at a break in the
tree-tops, a stream of maresâ-tails coming up the sky. He had said to
himself: âIt will rain to-morrow,â and the thought had made the air seem
warmer and the sun more vivid on her hair.... Perhaps if the maresâ-tails
had not come up the sky their adventure might have had no sequel. But the
cloud brought rain, and next morning he looked out of his window into a
cold grey blur. They had planned an all-day excursion down the Seine, to
the two Andelys and Rouen, and now, with the long hours on their hands,
they were both a little at a loss.... There was the Louvre, of course, and
the Luxembourg; but he had tried looking at pictures with her, she had
first so persistently admired the worst things, and then so frankly lapsed
into indifference, that he had no wish to repeat the experiment. So they
went out, aimlessly, and took a cold wet walk, turning at length into the
deserted arcades of the Palais Royal, and finally drifting into one of its
equally deserted restaurants, where they lunched alone and somewhat
dolefully, served by a wan old waiter with the look of a castaway who has
given up watching for a sail.... It was odd how the waiterâs face came back
to him...

Perhaps but for the rain it might never have happened; but what was the
use of thinking of that now? He tried to turn his thoughts to more urgent
issues; but, by a strange perversity of association, every detail of the
day was forcing itself on his mind with an insistence from which there was
no escape. Reluctantly he relived the long wet walk back to the hotel,
after a tedious hour at a cinematograph show on the Boulevard. It was
still raining when they withdrew from this stale spectacle, but she had
obstinately refused to take a cab, had even, on the way, insisted on
loitering under the dripping awnings of shop-windows and poking into
draughty passages, and finally, when they had nearly reached their
destination, had gone so far as to suggest that they should turn back to
hunt up some show she had heard of in a theatre at the Batignolles. But at
that he had somewhat irritably protested: he remembered that, for the
first time, they were both rather irritable, and vaguely disposed to
resist one anotherâs suggestions. His feet were wet, and he was tired of
walking, and sick of the smell of stuffy unaired theatres, and he had said
he must really get back to write some letters—and so they had kept
on to the hotel...

XXVII

Darrow had no idea how long he had sat there when he heard Annaâs hand on
the door. The effort of rising, and of composing his face to meet her,
gave him a factitious sense of self-control. He said to himself: âI must
decide on something——â and that lifted him a hairâs breadth
above the whirling waters.

She came in with a lighter step, and he instantly perceived that something
unforeseen and reassuring had happened.

âSheâs been with me. She came and found me on the terrace. Weâve had a
long talk and sheâs explained everything. I feel as if Iâd never known her
before!â

Her voice was so moved and tender that it checked his start of
apprehension.

âSheâs explained——?â

âItâs natural, isnât it, that she should have felt a little sore at the
kind of inspection sheâs been subjected to? Oh, not from you—I donât
mean that! But Madame de Chantelleâs opposition—and her sending for
Adelaide Painter! She told me frankly she didnât care to owe her husband
to Adelaide Painter.... She thinks now that her annoyance at feeling herself
so talked over and scrutinized may have shown itself in her manner to
Owen, and set him imagining the insane things he did.... I understand all
she must have felt, and I agree with her that itâs best she should go away
for a while. Sheâs made me,â Anna summed up, âfeel as if Iâd been
dreadfully thick-skinned and obtuse!â

â
You
?â

âYes. As if Iâd treated her like the bric-a-brac that used to be sent down
here âon approval,â to see if it would look well with the other pieces.â
She added, with a sudden flush of enthusiasm: âIâm glad sheâs got it in
her to make one feel like that!â

She seemed to wait for Darrow to agree with her, or to put some other
question, and he finally found voice to ask: âThen you think itâs not a
final break?â

âI hope not—Iâve never hoped it more! I had a word with Owen, too,
after I left her, and I think he understands that he must let her go
without insisting on any positive promise. Sheâs excited ... he must let her
calm down...â

Again she waited, and Darrow said: âSurely you can make him see that.â

âSheâll help me to—sheâs to see him, of course, before she goes. She
starts immediately, by the way, with Adelaide Painter, who is motoring
over to Francheuil to catch the one oâclock express—and who, of
course, knows nothing of all this, and is simply to be told that Sophy has
been sent for by the Farlows.â

Darrow mutely signed his comprehension, and she went on: âOwen is
particularly anxious that neither Adelaide nor his grandmother should have
the least inkling of whatâs happened. The need of shielding Sophy will
help him to control himself. Heâs coming to his senses, poor boy; heâs
ashamed of his wild talk already. He asked me to tell you so; no doubt
heâll tell you so himself.â

Darrow made a movement of protest. âOh, as to that—the thingâs not
worth another word.â

âOr another thought, either?â She brightened. âPromise me you wonât even
think of it—promise me you wonât be hard on him!â

He was finding it easier to smile back at her. âWhy should you think it
necessary to ask my indulgence for Owen?â

She hesitated a moment, her eyes wandering from him. Then they came back
with a smile. âPerhaps because I need it for myself.â

âFor yourself?â

âI mean, because I understand better how one can torture oneâs self over
unrealities.â

As Darrow listened, the tension of his nerves began to relax. Her gaze, so
grave and yet so sweet, was like a deep pool into which he could plunge
and hide himself from the hard glare of his misery. As this ecstatic sense
enveloped him he found it more and more difficult to follow her words and
to frame an answer; but what did anything matter, except that her voice
should go on, and the syllables fall like soft touches on his tortured
brain?

âDonât you know,â she continued, âthe bliss of waking from a bad dream in
oneâs own quiet room, and going slowly over all the horror without being
afraid of it any more? Thatâs what Iâm doing now. And thatâs why I
understand Owen...â She broke off, and he felt her touch on his arm.
â
Because Iâd dreamed the horror too
!â

He understood her then, and stammered: âYou?â

âForgive me! And let me tell you!... It will help you to understand
Owen.... There
were
little things ... little signs ... once I had begun to watch
for them: your reluctance to speak about her ... her reserve with you ... a
sort of constraint weâd never seen in her before...â

She laughed up at him, and with her hands in his he contrived to say: â
Now

you understand why?â

âOh, I understand; of course I understand; and I want you to laugh at me—with
me! Because there were other things too ... crazier things still.... There was
even—last night on the terrace—her pink cloak...â

âHer pink cloak?â Now he honestly wondered, and as she saw it she blushed.

âYouâve forgotten about the cloak? The pink cloak that Owen saw you with
at the play in Paris? Yes ... yes.... I was mad enough for that!... It does me
good to laugh about it now! But you ought to know that Iâm going to be a
jealous woman ... a ridiculously jealous woman ... you ought to be warned of
it in time...â

He had dropped her hands, and she leaned close and lifted her arms to his
neck with one of her rare gestures of surrender.

âI donât know why it is; but it makes me happier now to have been so
foolish!â

Her lips were parted in a noiseless laugh and the tremor of her lashes
made their shadow move on her cheek. He looked at her through a mist of
pain and saw all her offered beauty held up like a cup to his lips; but as
he stooped to it a darkness seemed to fall between them, her arms slipped
from his shoulders and she drew away from him abruptly.

âBut she
was
with you, then?â she exclaimed; and then, as he stared at
her: âOh, donât say no! Only go and look at your eyes!â

He stood speechless, and she pressed on: âDonât deny it—oh, donât
deny it! What will be left for me to imagine if you do? Donât you see how
every single thing cries it out? Owen sees it—he saw it again just
now! When I told him sheâd relented, and would see him, he said: âIs that
Darrowâs doing too?ââ

Darrow took the onslaught in silence. He might have spoken, have summoned
up the usual phrases of banter and denial; he was not even certain that
they might not, for the moment, have served their purpose if he could have
uttered them without being seen. But he was as conscious of what had
happened to his face as if he had obeyed Annaâs bidding and looked at
himself in the glass. He knew he could no more hide from her what was
written there than he could efface from his soul the fiery record of what
he had just lived through. There before him, staring him in the eyes, and
reflecting itself in all his lineaments, was the overwhelming fact of
Sophy Vinerâs passion and of the act by which she had attested it.

Anna was talking again, hurriedly, feverishly, and his soul was wrung by
the anguish in her voice. âDo speak at last—you must speak! I donât
want to ask you to harm the girl; but you must see that your silence is
doing her more harm than your answering my questions could. Youâre leaving
me only the worst things to think of her ... sheâd see that herself if she
were here. What worse injury can you do her than to make me hate her—to
make me feel sheâs plotted with you to deceive us?â

âOh, not that!â Darrow heard his own voice before he was aware that he
meant to speak. âYes; I did see her in Paris,â he went on after a pause;
âbut I was bound to respect her reason for not wanting it known.â

Anna paled. âIt was she at the theatre that night?â

âI was with her at the theatre one night.â

âWhy should she have asked you not to say so?â

âShe didnât wish it known that Iâd met her.â

âWhy shouldnât she have wished it known?â

âShe had quarrelled with Mrs. Murrett and come over suddenly to Paris, and
she didnât want the Farlows to hear of it. I came across her by accident,
and she asked me not to speak of having seen her.â

âBecause of her quarrel? Because she was ashamed of her part in it?â

âOh, no. There was nothing for her to be ashamed of. But the Farlows had
found the place for her, and she didnât want them to know how suddenly
sheâd had to leave, and how badly Mrs. Murrett had behaved. She was in a
terrible plight—the woman had even kept back her monthâs salary. She
knew the Farlows would be awfully upset, and she wanted more time to
prepare them.â

Darrow heard himself speak as though the words had proceeded from other
lips. His explanation sounded plausible enough, and he half-fancied Annaâs
look grew lighter. She waited a moment, as though to be sure he had no
more to add; then she said: âBut the Farlows
did
know; they told me all
about it when they sent her to me.â

He flushed as if she had laid a deliberate trap for him. âThey may know

now
; they didnât then——â

âThatâs no reason for her continuing now to make a mystery of having met
you.â

âItâs the only reason I can give you.â

âThen Iâll go and ask her for one myself.â She turned and took a few steps
toward the door.

âAnna!â He started to follow her, and then checked himself. âDonât do
that!â

âWhy not?â

âItâs not like you ... not generous...â

She stood before him straight and pale, but under her rigid face he saw
the tumult of her doubt and misery.

âI donât want to be ungenerous; I donât want to pry into her secrets. But
things canât be left like this. Wouldnât it be better for me to go to her?
Surely sheâll understand—sheâll explain.... It may be some mere trifle
sheâs concealing: something that would horrify the Farlows, but that I
shouldnât see any harm in...â She paused, her eyes searching his face. âA
love affair, I suppose ... thatâs it? You met her with some man at the
theatre—and she was frightened and begged you to fib about it? Those
poor young things that have to go about among us like machines—oh,
if you knew how I pity them!â

âIf you pity her, why not let her go?â

She stared. âLet her go—go for good, you mean? Is that the best you
can say for her?â

âLet things take their course. After all, itâs between herself and Owen.â

âAnd you and me—and Effie, if Owen marries her, and I leave my child
with them! Donât you see the impossibility of what youâre asking? Weâre
all bound together in this coil.â

Darrow turned away with a groan. âOh, let her go—let her go.â

âThen there
is
something—something really bad? She
was
with some one
when you met her? Some one with whom she was——â She broke off,
and he saw her struggling with new thoughts. âIf itâs
that
, of
course.... Oh, donât you see,â she desperately appealed to him, âthat I must
find out, and that itâs too late now for you not to speak? Donât be afraid
that Iâll betray you.... Iâll never, never let a soul suspect. But I must
know the truth, and surely itâs best for her that I should find it out
from you.â

Darrow waited a moment; then he said slowly: âWhat you imagineâs mere
madness. She was at the theatre with me.â

âWith you?â He saw a tremor pass through her, but she controlled it
instantly and faced him straight and motionless as a wounded creature in
the moment before it feels its wound. âWhy should you both have made a
mystery of that?â

âIâve told you the idea was not mine.â He cast about. âShe may have been
afraid that Owen——â

âBut that was not a reason for her asking you to tell me that you hardly
knew her—that you hadnât even seen her for years.â She broke off and
the blood rose to her face and forehead. âEven if
she
had other reasons,
there could be only one reason for your obeying her——â Silence
fell between them, a silence in which the room seemed to become suddenly
resonant with voices. Darrowâs gaze wandered to the window and he noticed
that the gale of two days before had nearly stripped the tops of the
lime-trees in the court. Anna had moved away and was resting her elbows
against the mantel-piece, her head in her hands. As she stood there he
took in with a new intensity of vision little details of her appearance
that his eyes had often cherished: the branching blue veins in the backs
of her hands, the warm shadow that her hair cast on her ear, and the
colour of the hair itself, dull black with a tawny under-surface, like the
wings of certain birds. He felt it to be useless to speak.

After a while she lifted her head and said: âI shall not see her again
before she goes.â

He made no answer, and turning to him she added: âThat is why sheâs going,
I suppose? Because she loves you and wonât give you up?â

Darrow waited. The paltriness of conventional denial was so apparent to
him that even if it could have delayed discovery he could no longer have
resorted to it. Under all his other fears was the dread of dishonouring
the hour.

âShe
has
given me up,â he said at last.

XXVIII

When he had gone out of the room Anna stood where he had left her. âI must
believe him! I must believe him!â she said.

A moment before, at the moment when she had lifted her arms to his neck,
she had been wrapped in a sense of complete security. All the spirits of
doubt had been exorcised, and her love was once more the clear habitation
in which every thought and feeling could move in blissful freedom. And
then, as she raised her face to Darrowâs and met his eyes, she had seemed
to look into the very ruins of his soul. That was the only way she could
express it. It was as though he and she had been looking at two sides of
the same thing, and the side she had seen had been all light and life, and
his a place of graves...

She didnât now recall who had spoken first, or even, very clearly, what
had been said. It seemed to her only a moment later that she had found
herself standing at the other end of the room—the room which had
suddenly grown so small that, even with its length between them, she felt
as if he touched her—crying out to him âIt
is
because of you sheâs
going!â and reading the avowal in his face.

That was his secret, then,
their
secret: he had met the girl in Paris and
helped her in her straits—lent her money, Anna vaguely conjectured—and
she had fallen in love with him, and on meeting him again had been
suddenly overmastered by her passion. Anna, dropping back into her
sofa-corner, sat staring these facts in the face.

The girl had been in a desperate plight—frightened, penniless,
outraged by what had happened, and not knowing (with a woman like Mrs.
Murrett) what fresh injury might impend; and Darrow, meeting her in this
distracted hour, had pitied, counselled, been kind to her, with the fatal,
the inevitable result. There were the facts as Anna made them out: that,
at least, was their external aspect, was as much of them as she had been
suffered to see; and into the secret intricacies they might cover she
dared not yet project her thoughts.

âI must believe him.... I must believe him...â She kept on repeating the
words like a talisman. It was natural, after all, that he should have
behaved as he had: defended the girlâs piteous secret to the last. She too
began to feel the contagion of his pity—the stir, in her breast, of
feelings deeper and more native to her than the pains of jealousy. From
the security of her blessedness she longed to lean over with compassionate
hands.... But Owen? What was Owenâs part to be? She owed herself first to
him—she was bound to protect him not only from all knowledge of the
secret she had surprised, but also—and chiefly!—from its
consequences. Yes: the girl must go—there could be no doubt of it—Darrow
himself had seen it from the first; and at the thought she had a wild
revulsion of relief, as though she had been trying to create in her heart
the delusion of a generosity she could not feel...

The one fact on which she could stay her mind was that Sophy was leaving
immediately; would be out of the house within an hour. Once she was gone,
it would be easier to bring Owen to the point of understanding that the
break was final; if necessary, to work upon the girl to make him see it.
But that, Anna was sure, would not be necessary. It was clear that Sophy
Viner was leaving Givre with no thought of ever seeing it again...

Suddenly, as she tried to put some order in her thoughts, she heard Owenâs
call at the door: âMother!——â a name he seldom gave her. There
was a new note in his voice: the note of a joyous impatience. It made her
turn hastily to the glass to see what face she was about to show him; but
before she had had time to compose it he was in the room and she was
caught in a school-boy hug.

âItâs all right! Itâs all right! And itâs all your doing! I want to do the
worst kind of penance—bell and candle and the rest. Iâve been
through it with
her
, and now she hands me on to you, and youâre to call me
any names you please.â He freed her with his happy laugh. âIâm to be stood
in the corner till next week, and then Iâm to go up to see her. And she
says I owe it all to you!â

âTo me?â It was the first phrase she found to clutch at as she tried to
steady herself in the eddies of his joy.

âYes: you were so patient, and so dear to her; and you saw at once what a
damned ass Iâd been!â She tried a smile, and it seemed to pass muster with
him, for he sent it back in a broad beam. âThatâs not so difficult to see?
No, I admit it doesnât take a microscope. But you were so wise and
wonderful—you always are. Iâve been mad these last days, simply mad—you
and she might well have washed your hands of me! And instead, itâs all
right—all right!â

She drew back a little, trying to keep the smile on her lips and not let
him get the least glimpse of what it hid. Now if ever, indeed, it behoved
her to be wise and wonderful!

âIâm so glad, dear; so glad. If only youâll always feel like that about
me...â She stopped, hardly knowing what she said, and aghast at the idea
that her own hands should have retied the knot she imagined to be broken.
But she saw he had something more to say; something hard to get out, but
absolutely necessary to express. He caught her hands, pulled her close,
and, with his forehead drawn into its whimsical smiling wrinkles, âLook
here,â he cried, âif Darrow wants to call me a damned ass too youâre not
to stop him!â

It brought her back to a sharper sense of her central peril: of the secret
to be kept from him at whatever cost to her racked nerves.

âOh, you know, he doesnât always wait for orders!â On the whole it sounded
better than sheâd feared.

âYou mean heâs called me one already?â He accepted the fact with his
gayest laugh. âWell, that saves a lot of trouble; now we can pass to the
order of the day——â he broke off and glanced at the clock—âwhich
is, you know, dear, that sheâs starting in about an hour; she and Adelaide
must already be snatching a hasty sandwich. Youâll come down to bid them
good-bye?â

âYes—of course.â

There had, in fact, grown upon her while he spoke the urgency of seeing
Sophy Viner again before she left. The thought was deeply distasteful:
Anna shrank from encountering the girl till she had cleared a way through
her own perplexities. But it was obvious that since they had separated,
barely an hour earlier, the situation had taken a new shape. Sophy Viner
had apparently reconsidered her decision to break amicably but definitely
with Owen, and stood again in their path, a menace and a mystery; and
confused impulses of resistance stirred in Annaâs mind. She felt Owenâs
touch on her arm. âAre you coming?â

âYes ... yes ... presently.â

âWhatâs the matter? You look so strange.â

âWhat do you mean by strange?â

âI donât know: startled—surprised.â She read what her look must be
by its sudden reflection in his face.

âDo I? No wonder! Youâve given us all an exciting morning.â

He held to his point. âYouâre more excited now that thereâs no cause for
it. What on earth has happened since I saw you?â

He looked about the room, as if seeking the clue to her agitation, and in
her dread of what he might guess she answered: âWhat has happened is
simply that Iâm rather tired. Will you ask Sophy to come up and see me
here?â

While she waited she tried to think what she should say when the girl
appeared; but she had never been more conscious of her inability to deal
with the oblique and the tortuous. She had lacked the hard teachings of
experience, and an instinctive disdain for whatever was less clear and
open than her own conscience had kept her from learning anything of the
intricacies and contradictions of other hearts. She said to herself: âI
must find out——â yet everything in her recoiled from the means
by which she felt it must be done...

Sophy Viner appeared almost immediately, dressed for departure, her little
bag on her arm. She was still pale to the point of haggardness, but with a
light upon her that struck Anna with surprise. Or was it, perhaps, that
she was looking at the girl with new eyes: seeing her, for the first time,
not as Effieâs governess, not as Owenâs bride, but as the embodiment of
that unknown peril lurking in the background of every womanâs thoughts
about her lover? Anna, at any rate, with a sudden sense of estrangement,
noted in her graces and snares never before perceived. It was only the
flash of a primitive instinct, but it lasted long enough to make her
ashamed of the darknesses it lit up in her heart...

She signed to Sophy to sit down on the sofa beside her. âI asked you to
come up to me because I wanted to say good-bye quietly,â she explained,
feeling her lips tremble, but trying to speak in a tone of friendly
naturalness.

The girlâs only answer was a faint smile of acquiescence, and Anna,
disconcerted by her silence, went on: âYouâve decided, then, not to break
your engagement?â

Sophy Viner raised her head with a look of surprise. Evidently the
question, thus abruptly put, must have sounded strangely on the lips of so
ardent a partisan as Mrs. Leath! âI thought that was what you wished,â she
said.

âWhat I wished?â Annaâs heart shook against her side. âI wish, of course,
whatever seems best for Owen.... Itâs natural, you must understand, that
that consideration should come first with me...â

Sophy was looking at her steadily. âI supposed it was the only one that
counted with you.â

The curtness of retort roused Annaâs latent antagonism. âIt is,â she said,
in a hard voice that startled her as she heard it. Had she ever spoken so
to any one before? She felt frightened, as though her very nature had
changed without her knowing it.... Feeling the girlâs astonished gaze still
on her, she continued: âThe suddenness of the change has naturally
surprised me. When I left you it was understood that you were to reserve
your decision——â

âYes.â

âAnd now——?â Anna waited for a reply that did not come. She
did not understand the girlâs attitude, the edge of irony in her short
syllables, the plainly premeditated determination to lay the burden of
proof on her interlocutor. Anna felt the sudden need to lift their
intercourse above this mean level of defiance and distrust. She looked
appealingly at Sophy.

âIsnât it best that we should speak quite frankly? Itâs this change on
your part that perplexes me. You can hardly be surprised at that. Itâs
true, I asked you not to break with Owen too abruptly—and I asked
it, believe me, as much for your sake as for his: I wanted you to take
time to think over the difficulty that seems to have arisen between you.
The fact that you felt it required thinking over seemed to show you
wouldnât take the final step lightly—wouldnât, I mean, accept of
Owen more than you could give him. But your change of mind obliges me to
ask the question I thought you would have asked yourself. Is there any
reason why you shouldnât marry Owen?â

She stopped a little breathlessly, her eyes on Sophy Vinerâs burning face.
âAny reason——? What do you mean by a reason?â

Anna continued to look at her gravely. âDo you love some one else?â she
asked.

Sophyâs first look was one of wonder and a faint relief; then she gave
back the otherâs scrutiny in a glance of indescribable reproach. âAh, you
might have waited!â she exclaimed.

âWaited?â

âTill Iâd gone: till I was out of the house. You might have known ... you
might have guessed...â She turned her eyes again on Anna. âI only meant to
let him hope a little longer, so that he shouldnât suspect anything; of
course I canât marry him,â she said.

Anna stood motionless, silenced by the shock of the avowal. She too was
trembling, less with anger than with a confused compassion. But the
feeling was so blent with others, less generous and more obscure, that she
found no words to express it, and the two women faced each other without
speaking.

âIâd better go,â Sophy murmured at length with lowered head.

The words roused in Anna a latent impulse of compunction. The girl looked
so young, so exposed and desolate! And what thoughts must she be hiding in
her heart! It was impossible that they should part in such a spirit.

âI want you to know that no one said anything.... It was I who...â

Sophy looked at her. âYou mean that Mr. Darrow didnât tell you? Of course
not: do you suppose I thought he did? You found it out, thatâs all—I
knew you would. In your place I should have guessed it sooner.â

The words were spoken simply, without irony or emphasis; but they went
through Anna like a sword. Yes, the girl would have had divinations,
promptings that she had not had! She felt half envious of such a sad
precocity of wisdom.

âIâm so sorry ... so sorry...â she murmured.

âThings happen that way. Now Iâd better go. Iâd like to say good-bye to
Effie.â

âOh——â it broke in a cry from Effieâs mother. âNot like this—you
mustnât! I feel—you make me feel too horribly: as if I were driving
you away...â The words had rushed up from the depths of her bewildered
pity.

âNo one is driving me away: I had to go,â she heard the girl reply.

There was another silence, during which passionate impulses of magnanimity
warred in Anna with her doubts and dreads. At length, her eyes on Sophyâs
face: âYes, you must go now,â she began; âbut later on ... after a while,
when all this is over ... if thereâs no reason why you shouldnât marry Owen——â
she paused a moment on the words— âI shouldnât want you to think I
stood between you...â

âYou?â Sophy flushed again, and then grew pale. She seemed to try to
speak, but no words came. âYes! It was not true when I said just now that
I was thinking only of Owen. Iâm sorry—oh, so sorry!—for you
too. Your life—I know how hard itâs been; and mine ... mineâs so
full.... Happy women understand best!â Anna drew near and touched the girlâs
hand; then she began again, pouring all her soul into the broken phrases:
âItâs terrible now ... you see no future; but if, by and bye ... you know
best ... but youâre so young ... and at your age things
do
pass. If thereâs no
reason, no real reason, why you shouldnât marry Owen, I
want
him to hope,
Iâll help him to hope ... if you say so....â

With the urgency of her pleading her clasp tightened on Sophyâs hand, but
it warmed to no responsive tremor: the girl seemed numb, and Anna was
frightened by the stony silence of her look. âI suppose Iâm not more than
half a woman,â she mused, âfor I donât want my happiness to hurt her;â and
aloud she repeated: âIf only youâll tell me thereâs no reason——â

The girl did not speak; but suddenly, like a snapped branch, she bent,
stooped down to the hand that clasped her, and laid her lips upon it in a
stream of weeping. She cried silently, continuously, abundantly, as though
Annaâs touch had released the waters of some deep spring of pain; then, as
Anna, moved and half afraid, leaned over her with a sound of pity, she
stood up and turned away.

âYouâre going, then—for good—like this?â Anna moved toward her
and stopped. Sophy stopped too, with eyes that shrank from her.

âOh——â Anna cried, and hid her face.

The girl walked across the room and paused again in the doorway. From
there she flung back: âI wanted it—I chose it. He was good to me—no
one ever was so good!â

The door-handle turned, and Anna heard her go.

XXIX

Her first thought was: âHeâs going too in a few hours—I neednât see
him again before he leaves...â At that moment the possibility of having to
look in Darrowâs face and hear him speak seemed to her more unendurable
than anything else she could imagine. Then, on the next wave of feeling,
came the desire to confront him at once and wring from him she knew not
what: avowal, denial, justification, anything that should open some
channel of escape to the flood of her pent-up anguish.

She had told Owen she was tired, and this seemed a sufficient reason for
remaining upstairs when the motor came to the door and Miss Painter and
Sophy Viner were borne off in it; sufficient also for sending word to
Madame de Chantelle that she would not come down till after luncheon.
Having despatched her maid with this message, she lay down on her sofa and
stared before her into darkness...

She had been unhappy before, and the vision of old miseries flocked like
hungry ghosts about her fresh pain: she recalled her youthful
disappointment, the failure of her marriage, the wasted years that
followed; but those were negative sorrows, denials and postponements of
life. She seemed in no way related to their shadowy victim, she who was
stretched on this fiery rack of the irreparable. She had suffered before—yes,
but lucidly, reflectively, elegiacally: now she was suffering as a hurt
animal must, blindly, furiously, with the single fierce animal longing
that the awful pain should stop...

She heard her maid knock, and she hid her face and made no answer. The
knocking continued, and the discipline of habit at length made her lift
her head, compose her face and hold out her hand to the note the woman
brought her. It was a word from Darrow—âMay I see you?â—and
she said at once, in a voice that sounded thin and empty: âAsk Mr. Darrow
to come up.â

The maid enquired if she wished to have her hair smoothed first, and she
answered that it didnât matter; but when the door had closed, the instinct
of pride drew her to her feet and she looked at herself in the glass above
the mantelpiece and passed her hands over her hair. Her eyes were burning
and her face looked tired and thinner; otherwise she could see no change
in her appearance, and she wondered that at such a moment her body should
seem as unrelated to the self that writhed within her as if it had been a
statue or a picture.

The maid reopened the door to show in Darrow, and he paused a moment on
the threshold, as if waiting for Anna to speak. He was extremely pale, but
he looked neither ashamed nor uncertain, and she said to herself, with a
perverse thrill of appreciation: âHeâs as proud as I am.â

Aloud she asked: âYou wanted to see me?â

âNaturally,â he replied in a grave voice.

âDonât! Itâs useless. I know everything. Nothing you can say will help.â

At the direct affirmation he turned even paler, and his eyes, which he
kept resolutely fixed on her, confessed his misery.

âYou allow me no voice in deciding that?â

âDeciding what?â

âThat thereâs nothing more to be said?â He waited for her to answer, and
then went on: âI donât even know what you mean by âeverythingâ.â

âOh, I donât know what more there is! I know enough. I implored her to
deny it, and she couldnât.... What can you and I have to say to each other?â
Her voice broke into a sob. The animal anguish was upon her again—just
a blind cry against her pain!

Darrow kept his head high and his eyes steady. âIt must be as you wish;
and yet itâs not like you to be afraid.â

âAfraid?â

âTo talk things out—to face them.â

âItâs for
you
to face this—not me!â

âAll I ask is to face it—but with you.â Once more he paused. âWonât
you tell me what Miss Viner told you?â

âOh, sheâs generous—to the utmost!â The pain caught her like a
physical throe. It suddenly came to her how the girl must have loved him
to be so generous—what memories there must be between them!

âOh, go, please go. Itâs too horrible. Why should I have to see you?â she
stammered, lifting her hands to her eyes.

With her face hidden she waited to hear him move away, to hear the door
open and close again, as, a few hours earlier, it had opened and closed on
Sophy Viner. But Darrow made no sound or movement: he too was waiting.
Anna felt a thrill of resentment: his presence was an outrage on her
sorrow, a humiliation to her pride. It was strange that he should wait for
her to tell him so!

âYou want me to leave Givre?â he asked at length. She made no answer, and
he went on: âOf course Iâll do as you wish; but if I go now am I not to
see you again?â

His voice was firm: his pride was answering her pride!

She faltered: âYou must see itâs useless——â

âI might remind you that youâre dismissing me without a hearing——â

âWithout a hearing? Iâve heard you both!â

——âbut I wonât,â he continued, âremind you of that, or of
anything or any one but Owen.â

âOwen?â

âYes; if we could somehow spare him——â

She had dropped her hands and turned her startled eyes on him. It seemed
to her an age since she had thought of Owen!

âYou see, donât you,â Darrow continued, âthat if you send me away now——â

She interrupted: âYes, I see——â and there was a long silence
between them. At length she said, very low: âI donât want any one else to
suffer as Iâm suffering...â

âOwen knows I meant to leave tomorrow,â Darrow went on. âAny sudden change
of plan may make him think...â

Oh, she saw his inevitable logic: the horror of it was on every side of
her! It had seemed possible to control her grief and face Darrow calmly
while she was upheld by the belief that this was their last hour together,
that after he had passed out of the room there would be no fear of seeing
him again, no fear that his nearness, his look, his voice, and all the
unseen influences that flowed from him, would dissolve her soul to
weakness. But her courage failed at the idea of having to conspire with
him to shield Owen, of keeping up with him, for Owenâs sake, a feint of
union and felicity. To live at Darrowâs side in seeming intimacy and
harmony for another twenty-four hours seemed harder than to live without
him for all the rest of her days. Her strength failed her, and she threw
herself down and buried her sobs in the cushions where she had so often
hidden a face aglow with happiness.

âAnna——â His voice was close to her. âLet me talk to you
quietly. Itâs not worthy of either of us to be afraid.â

Words of endearment would have offended her; but her heart rose at the
call to her courage.

âIâve no defense to make,â he went on. âThe facts are miserable enough;
but at least I want you to see them as they are. Above all, I want you to
know the truth about Miss Viner——â

The name sent the blood to Annaâs forehead. She raised her head and faced
him. âWhy should I know more of her than what sheâs told me? I never wish
to hear her name again!â

âItâs because you feel about her in that way that I ask you—in the
name of common charity—to let me give you the facts as they are, and
not as youâve probably imagined them.â

âIâve told you I donât think uncharitably of her. I donât want to think of
her at all!â

âThatâs why I tell you youâre afraid.â

âAfraid?â

âYes. Youâve always said you wanted, above all, to look at life, at the
human problem, as it is, without fear and without hypocrisy; and itâs not
always a pleasant thing to look at.â He broke off, and then began again:
âDonât think this a plea for myself! I donât want to say a word to lessen
my offense. I donât want to talk of myself at all. Even if I did, I
probably couldnât make you understand—I donât, myself, as I look
back. Be just to me—itâs your right; all I ask you is to be generous
to Miss Viner...â

She stood up trembling. âYouâre free to be as generous to her as you
please!â

âYes: youâve made it clear to me that Iâm free. But thereâs nothing I can
do for her that will help her half as much as your understanding her
would.â

âNothing you can do for her? You can marry her!â

His face hardened. âYou certainly couldnât wish her a worse fate!â

âIt must have been what she expected ... relied on...â He was silent, and
she broke out: âOr what is she? What are you? Itâs too horrible! On your
way here ... to
me
...â She felt the tears in her throat and stopped.

âThat was it,â he said bluntly. She stared at him.

âI was on my way to you—after repeated delays and postponements of
your own making. At the very last you turned me back with a mere word—and
without explanation. I waited for a letter; and none came. Iâm not saying
this to justify myself. Iâm simply trying to make you understand. I felt
hurt and bitter and bewildered. I thought you meant to give me up. And
suddenly, in my way, I found some one to be sorry for, to be of use to.
That, I swear to you, was the way it began. The rest was a momentâs
folly ... a flash of madness ... as such things are. Weâve never seen each
other since...â

Anna was looking at him coldly. âYou sufficiently describe her in saying
that!â

âYes, if you measure her by conventional standards—which is what you
always declare you never do.â

âConventional standards? A girl who——â She was checked by a
sudden rush of almost physical repugnance. Suddenly she broke out: âI
always thought her an adventuress!â

âAlways?â

âI donât mean always ... but after you came...â

âSheâs not an adventuress.â

âYou mean that she professes to act on the new theories? The stuff that
awful women rave about on platforms?â

âOh, I donât think she pretended to have a theory——â

âShe hadnât even that excuse?â

âShe had the excuse of her loneliness, her unhappiness—of miseries
and humiliations that a woman like you canât even guess. She had nothing
to look back to but indifference or unkindness—nothing to look
forward to but anxiety. She saw I was sorry for her and it touched her.
She made too much of it—she exaggerated it. I ought to have seen the
danger, but I didnât. Thereâs no possible excuse for what I did.â

Anna listened to him in speechless misery. Every word he spoke threw back
a disintegrating light on their own past. He had come to her with an open
face and a clear conscience—come to her from this! If his security
was the security of falsehood it was horrible; if it meant that he had
forgotten, it was worse. She would have liked to stop her ears, to close
her eyes, to shut out every sight and sound and suggestion of a world in
which such things could be; and at the same time she was tormented by the
desire to know more, to understand better, to feel herself less ignorant
and inexpert in matters which made so much of the stuff of human
experience. What did he mean by âa momentâs folly, a flash of madnessâ?
How did people enter on such adventures, how pass out of them without more
visible traces of their havoc? Her imagination recoiled from the vision of
a sudden debasing familiarity: it seemed to her that her thoughts would
never again be pure...

âI swear to you,â she heard Darrow saying, âit was simply that, and
nothing more.â

She wondered at his composure, his competence, at his knowing so exactly
what to say. No doubt men often had to make such explanations: they had
the formulas by heart.... A leaden lassitude descended on her. She passed
from flame and torment into a colourless cold world where everything
surrounding her seemed equally indifferent and remote. For a moment she
simply ceased to feel.

She became aware that Darrow was waiting for her to speak, and she made an
effort to represent to herself the meaning of what he had just said; but
her mind was as blank as a blurred mirror. Finally she brought out: âI
donât think I understand what youâve told me.â

âNo; you donât understand,â he returned with sudden bitterness; and on his
lips the charge of incomprehension seemed an offense to her.

âI donât want to—about such things!â

He answered almost harshly: âDonât be afraid ... you never will...â and for
an instant they faced each other like enemies. Then the tears swelled in
her throat at his reproach.

âYou mean I donât feel things—Iâm too hard?â

âNo: youâre too high ... too fine ... such things are too far from you.â

He paused, as if conscious of the futility of going on with whatever he
had meant to say, and again, for a short space, they confronted each
other, no longer as enemies—so it seemed to her—but as beings
of different language who had forgotten the few words they had learned of
each otherâs speech.

Darrow broke the silence. âItâs best, on all accounts, that I should stay
till tomorrow; but I neednât intrude on you; we neednât meet again alone.
I only want to be sure I know your wishes.â He spoke the short sentences
in a level voice, as though he were summing up the results of a business
conference.

Anna looked at him vaguely. âMy wishes?â

âAs to Owen——â

At that she started. âThey must never meet again!â

âItâs not likely they will. What I meant was, that it depends on you to
spare him...â

She answered steadily: âHe shall never know,â and after another interval
Darrow said: âThis is good-bye, then.â

At the word she seemed to understand for the first time whither the flying
moments had been leading them. Resentment and indignation died down, and
all her consciousness resolved itself into the mere visual sense that he
was there before her, near enough for her to lift her hand and touch him,
and that in another instant the place where he stood would be empty.

She felt a mortal weakness, a craven impulse to cry out to him to stay, a
longing to throw herself into his arms, and take refuge there from the
unendurable anguish he had caused her. Then the vision called up another
thought: âI shall never know what that girl has known...â and the recoil
of pride flung her back on the sharp edges of her anguish.

âGood-bye,â she said, in dread lest he should read her face; and she stood
motionless, her head high, while he walked to the door and went out.

BOOK V

XXX

Anna Leath, three days later, sat in Miss Painterâs drawing-room in the
rue de Matignon.

Coming up precipitately that morning from the country, she had reached
Paris at one oâclock and Miss Painterâs landing some ten minutes later.
Miss Painterâs mouldy little man-servant, dissembling a napkin under his
arm, had mildly attempted to oppose her entrance; but Anna, insisting, had
gone straight to the dining-room and surprised her friend—who ate as
furtively as certain animals—over a strange meal of cold mutton and
lemonade. Ignoring the embarrassment she caused, she had set forth the
object of her journey, and Miss Painter, always hatted and booted for
action, had immediately hastened out, leaving her to the solitude of the
bare fireless drawing-room with its eternal slip-covers and âbowedâ
shutters.

In this inhospitable obscurity Anna had sat alone for close upon two
hours. Both obscurity and solitude were acceptable to her, and impatient
as she was to hear the result of the errand on which she had despatched
her hostess, she desired still more to be alone. During her long
meditation in a white-swathed chair before the muffled hearth she had been
able for the first time to clear a way through the darkness and confusion
of her thoughts. The way did not go far, and her attempt to trace it was
as weak and spasmodic as a convalescentâs first efforts to pick up the
thread of living. She seemed to herself like some one struggling to rise
from a long sickness of which it would have been so much easier to die. At
Givre she had fallen into a kind of torpor, a deadness of soul traversed
by wild flashes of pain; but whether she suffered or whether she was numb,
she seemed equally remote from her real living and doing self.

It was only the discovery—that very morning—of Owenâs
unannounced departure for Paris that had caught her out of her dream and
forced her back to action. The dread of what this flight might imply, and
of the consequences that might result from it, had roused her to the sense
of her responsibility, and from the moment when she had resolved to follow
her step-son, and had made her rapid preparations for pursuit, her mind
had begun to work again, feverishly, fitfully, but still with something of
its normal order. In the train she had been too agitated, too preoccupied
with what might next await her, to give her thoughts to anything but the
turning over of dread alternatives; but Miss Painterâs imperviousness had
steadied her, and while she waited for the sound of the latch-key she
resolutely returned upon herself.

With respect to her outward course she could at least tell herself that
she had held to her purpose. She had, as people said, âkept upâ during the
twenty-four hours preceding George Darrowâs departure; had gone with a
calm face about her usual business, and even contrived not too obviously
to avoid him. Then, the next day before dawn, from behind the closed
shutters where she had kept for half the night her dry-eyed vigil, she had
heard him drive off to the train which brought its passengers to Paris in
time for the Calais express.

The fact of his taking that train, of his travelling so straight and far
away from her, gave to what had happened the implacable outline of
reality. He was gone; he would not come back; and her life had ended just
as she had dreamed it was beginning. She had no doubt, at first, as to the
absolute inevitability of this conclusion. The man who had driven away
from her house in the autumn dawn was not the man she had loved; he was a
stranger with whom she had not a single thought in common. It was
terrible, indeed, that he wore the face and spoke in the voice of her
friend, and that, as long as he was under one roof with her, the mere way
in which he moved and looked could bridge at a stroke the gulf between
them. That, no doubt, was the fault of her exaggerated sensibility to
outward things: she was frightened to see how it enslaved her. A day or
two before she had supposed the sense of honour was her deepest sentiment:
if she had smiled at the conventions of others it was because they were
too trivial, not because they were too grave. There were certain
dishonours with which she had never dreamed that any pact could be made:
she had had an incorruptible passion for good faith and fairness.

She had supposed that, once Darrow was gone, once she was safe from the
danger of seeing and hearing him, this high devotion would sustain her.
She had believed it would be possible to separate the image of the man she
had thought him from that of the man he was. She had even foreseen the
hour when she might raise a mournful shrine to the memory of the Darrow
she had loved, without fear that his doubleâs shadow would desecrate it.
But now she had begun to understand that the two men were really one. The
Darrow she worshipped was inseparable from the Darrow she abhorred; and
the inevitable conclusion was that both must go, and she be left in the
desert of a sorrow without memories...

But if the future was thus void, the present was all too full. Never had
blow more complex repercussions; and to remember Owen was to cease to
think of herself. What impulse, what apprehension, had sent him suddenly
to Paris? And why had he thought it needful to conceal his going from her?
When Sophy Viner had left, it had been with the understanding that he was
to await her summons; and it seemed improbable that he would break his
pledge, and seek her without leave, unless his loverâs intuition had
warned him of some fresh danger. Anna recalled how quickly he had read the
alarm in her face when he had rushed back to her sitting-room with the
news that Miss Viner had promised to see him again in Paris. To be so
promptly roused, his suspicions must have been but half-asleep; and since
then, no doubt, if she and Darrow had dissembled, so had he. To her proud
directness it was degrading to think that they had been living together
like enemies who spy upon each otherâs movements: she felt a desperate
longing for the days which had seemed so dull and narrow, but in which she
had walked with her head high and her eyes unguarded.

She had come up to Paris hardly knowing what peril she feared, and still
less how she could avert it. If Owen meant to see Miss Viner—and
what other object could he have?—they must already be together, and
it was too late to interfere. It had indeed occurred to Anna that Paris
might not be his objective point: that his real purpose in leaving Givre
without her knowledge had been to follow Darrow to London and exact the
truth of him. But even to her alarmed imagination this seemed improbable.
She and Darrow, to the last, had kept up so complete a feint of harmony
that, whatever Owen had surmised, he could scarcely have risked acting on
his suspicions. If he still felt the need of an explanation, it was almost
certainly of Sophy Viner that he would ask it; and it was in quest of
Sophy Viner that Anna had despatched Miss Painter.

She had found a blessed refuge from her perplexities in the stolid
Adelaideâs unawareness. One could so absolutely count on Miss Painterâs
guessing no more than one chose, and yet acting astutely on such hints as
one vouchsafed her! She was like a well-trained retriever whose interest
in his prey ceases when he lays it at his masterâs feet. Anna, on
arriving, had explained that Owenâs unannounced flight had made her fear
some fresh misunderstanding between himself and Miss Viner. In the
interests of peace she had thought it best to follow him; but she hastily
added that she did not wish to see Sophy, but only, if possible, to learn
from her where Owen was. With these brief instructions Miss Painter had
started out; but she was a woman of many occupations, and had given her
visitor to understand that before returning she should have to call on a
friend who had just arrived from Boston, and afterward despatch to another
exiled compatriot a supply of cranberries and brandied peaches from the
American grocery in the Champs Elysees.

Gradually, as the moments passed, Anna began to feel the reaction which,
in moments of extreme nervous tension, follows on any effort of the will.
She seemed to have gone as far as her courage would carry her, and she
shrank more and more from the thought of Miss Painterâs return, since
whatever information the latter brought would necessitate some fresh
decision. What should she say to Owen if she found him? What could she say
that should not betray the one thing she would give her life to hide from
him? âGive her lifeâ—how the phrase derided her! It was a gift she
would not have bestowed on her worst enemy. She would not have had Sophy
Viner live the hours she was living now... She tried again to look
steadily and calmly at the picture that the image of the girl evoked. She
had an idea that she ought to accustom herself to its contemplation. If
life was like that, why the sooner one got used to it the better.... But no!
Life was not like that. Her adventure was a hideous accident. She dreaded
above all the temptation to generalise from her own case, to doubt the
high things she had lived by and seek a cheap solace in belittling what
fate had refused her. There was such love as she had dreamed, and she
meant to go on believing in it, and cherishing the thought that she was
worthy of it. What had happened to her was grotesque and mean and
miserable; but she herself was none of these things, and never, never
would she make of herself the mock that fate had made of her...

She could not, as yet, bear to think deliberately of Darrow; but she kept
on repeating to herself âBy and bye that will come too.â Even now she was
determined not to let his image be distorted by her suffering. As soon as
she could, she would try to single out for remembrance the individual
things she had liked in him before she had loved him altogether. No
âspiritual exerciseâ devised by the discipline of piety could have been
more torturing; but its very cruelty attracted her. She wanted to wear
herself out with new pains...

XXXI

The sound of Miss Painterâs latch-key made her start. She was still a
bundle of quivering fears to whom each coming moment seemed a menace.

There was a slight interval, and a sound of voices in the hall; then Miss
Painterâs vigorous hand was on the door.

Anna stood up as she came in. âYouâve found him?â

âIâve found Sophy.â

âAnd Owen?—has she seen him? Is he here?â

â
Sheâs
here: in the hall. She wants to speak to you.â

âHere—
now
?â Anna found no voice for more.

âShe drove back with me,â Miss Painter continued in the tone of impartial
narrative. âThe cabman was impertinent. Iâve got his number.â She fumbled
in a stout black reticule.

âOh, I canât—â broke from Anna; but she collected herself,
remembering that to betray her unwillingness to see the girl was to risk
revealing much more.

âShe thought you might be too tired to see her: she wouldnât come in till
Iâd found out.â

Anna drew a quick breath. An instantâs thought had told her that Sophy
Viner would hardly have taken such a step unless something more important
had happened. âAsk her to come, please,â she said.

Miss Painter, from the threshold, turned back to announce her intention of
going immediately to the police station to report the cabmanâs
delinquency; then she passed out, and Sophy Viner entered.

The look in the girlâs face showed that she had indeed come unwillingly;
yet she seemed animated by an eager resoluteness that made Anna ashamed of
her tremors. For a moment they looked at each other in silence, as if the
thoughts between them were packed too thick for speech; then Anna said, in
a voice from which she strove to take the edge of hardness: âYou know
where Owen is, Miss Painter tells me.â

âYes; that was my reason for asking you to see me.â Sophy spoke simply,
without constraint or hesitation.

âI thought heâd promised you—â Anna interposed.

âHe did; but he broke his promise. Thatâs what I thought I ought to tell
you.â

âThank you.â Anna went on tentatively: âHe left Givre this morning without
a word. I followed him because I was afraid...â

She broke off again and the girl took up her phrase. âYou were afraid heâd
guessed? He
has
...â

âWhat do you mean—guessed what?â

âThat you know something he doesnât ... something that made you glad to have
me go.â

âOh—â Anna moaned. If she had wanted more pain she had it now. âHeâs
told you this?â she faltered.

âHe hasnât told me, because I havenât seen him. I kept him off—I
made Mrs. Farlow get rid of him. But heâs written me what he came to say;
and that was it.â

âOh, poor Owen!â broke from Anna. Through all the intricacies of her
suffering she felt the separate pang of his.

âAnd I want to ask you,â the girl continued, âto let me see him; for of
course,â she added in the same strange voice of energy, âI wouldnât unless
you consented.â

âTo see him?â Anna tried to gather together her startled thoughts. âWhat
use would it be? What could you tell him?â

âI want to tell him the truth,â said Sophy Viner.

The two women looked at each other, and a burning blush rose to Annaâs
forehead. âI donât understand,â she faltered.

Sophy waited a moment; then she lowered her voice to say: âI donât want
him to think worse of me than he need...â

âWorse?â

âYes—to think such things as youâre thinking now.... I want him to
know exactly what happened ... then I want to bid him good-bye.â

Anna tried to clear a way through her own wonder and confusion. She felt
herself obscurely moved.

âWouldnât it be worse for him?â

âTo hear the truth? It would be better, at any rate, for you and Mr.
Darrow.â

At the sound of the name Anna lifted her head quickly. âIâve only my
step-son to consider!â

The girl threw a startled look at her. âYou donât mean—youâre not
going to give him up?â

Anna felt her lips harden. âI donât think itâs of any use to talk of
that.â

âOh, I know! Itâs my fault for not knowing how to say what I want you to
hear. Your words are different; you know how to choose them. Mine offend
you ... and the dread of it makes me blunder. Thatâs why, the other day, I
couldnât say anything ... couldnât make things clear to you. But now
must
,
even if you hate it!â She drew a step nearer, her slender figure swayed
forward in a passion of entreaty. âDo listen to me! What youâve said is
dreadful. How can you speak of him in that voice? Donât you see that I
went away so that he shouldnât have to lose you?â

Anna looked at her coldly. âAre you speaking of Mr. Darrow? I donât know
why you think your going or staying can in any way affect our relations.â

âYou mean that you
have
given him up—because of me? Oh, how could
you? You canât really love him!—And yet,â the girl suddenly added,
âyou must, or youâd be more sorry for me!â

âIâm very sorry for you,â Anna said, feeling as if the iron band about her
heart pressed on it a little less inexorably.

âThen why wonât you hear me? Why wonât you try to understand? Itâs all so
different from what you imagine!â

âIâve never judged you.â

âIâm not thinking of myself. He loves you!â

âI thought youâd come to speak of Owen.â

Sophy Viner seemed not to hear her. âHeâs never loved any one else. Even
those few days.... I knew it all the while ... he never cared for me.â

âPlease donât say any more!â Anna said.

âI know it must seem strange to you that I should say so much. I shock
you, I offend you: you think me a creature without shame. So I am—but
not in the sense you think! Iâm not ashamed of having loved him; no; and
Iâm not ashamed of telling you so. Itâs that that justifies me—and
him too.... Oh, let me tell you how it happened! He was sorry for me: he saw
I cared. I
knew
that was all he ever felt. I could see he was thinking of
some one else. I knew it was only for a week.... He never said a word to
mislead me.... I wanted to be happy just once—and I didnât dream of
the harm I might be doing him!â

Anna could not speak. She hardly knew, as yet, what the girlâs words
conveyed to her, save the sense of their tragic fervour; but she was
conscious of being in the presence of an intenser passion than she had
ever felt.

âI am sorry for you.â She paused. âBut why do you say this to me?â After
another interval she exclaimed: âYouâd no right to let Owen love you.â

âNo; that was wrong. At least whatâs happened since has made it so. If
things had been different I think I could have made Owen happy. You were
all so good to me—I wanted so to stay with you! I suppose youâll say
that makes it worse: my daring to dream I had the right.... But all that
doesnât matter now. I wonât see Owen unless youâre willing. I should have
liked to tell him what Iâve tried to tell you; but you must know better;
you feel things in a finer way. Only youâll have to help him if I canât.
He cares a great deal ... itâs going to hurt him...â

Anna trembled. âOh, I know! What can I do?â

âYou can go straight back to Givre—now, at once! So that Owen shall
never know youâve followed him.â Sophyâs clasped hands reached out
urgently. âAnd you can send for Mr. Darrow—bring him back. Owen must
be convinced that heâs mistaken, and nothing else will convince him.
Afterward Iâll find a pretext—oh, I promise you! But first he must
see for himself that nothingâs changed for you.â

Anna stood motionless, subdued and dominated. The girlâs ardour swept her
like a wind.

âOh, canât I move you? Some day youâll know!â Sophy pleaded, her eyes full
of tears.

Anna saw them, and felt a fullness in her throat. Again the band about her
heart seemed loosened. She wanted to find a word, but could not: all
within her was too dark and violent. She gave the girl a speechless look.

âI do believe you,â she said suddenly; then she turned and walked out of
the room.

XXXII

She drove from Miss Painterâs to her own apartment. The maid-servant who
had it in charge had been apprised of her coming, and had opened one or
two of the rooms, and prepared a fire in her bedroom. Anna shut herself
in, refusing the womanâs ministrations. She felt cold and faint, and after
she had taken off her hat and cloak she knelt down by the fire and
stretched her hands to it.

In one respect, at least, it was clear to her that she would do well to
follow Sophy Vinerâs counsel. It had been an act of folly to follow Owen,
and her first business was to get back to Givre before him. But the only
train leaving that evening was a slow one, which did not reach Francheuil
till midnight, and she knew that her taking it would excite Madame de
Chantelleâs wonder and lead to interminable talk. She had come up to Paris
on the pretext of finding a new governess for Effie, and the natural thing
was to defer her return till the next morning. She knew Owen well enough
to be sure that he would make another attempt to see Miss Viner, and
failing that, would write again and await her answer: so that there was no
likelihood of his reaching Givre till the following evening.

Her sense of relief at not having to start out at once showed her for the
first time how tired she was. The
bonne
had suggested a cup of tea, but
the dread of having any one about her had made Anna refuse, and she had
eaten nothing since morning but a sandwich bought at a buffet. She was too
tired to get up, but stretching out her arm she drew toward her the
arm-chair which stood beside the hearth and rested her head against its
cushions. Gradually the warmth of the fire stole into her veins and her
heaviness of soul was replaced by a dreamy buoyancy. She seemed to be
seated on the hearth in her sitting-room at Givre, and Darrow was beside
her, in the chair against which she leaned. He put his arms about her
shoulders and drawing her head back looked into her eyes. âOf all the ways
you do your hair, thatâs the way I like best,â he said...

A log dropped, and she sat up with a start. There was a warmth in her
heart, and she was smiling. Then she looked about her, and saw where she
was, and the glory fell. She hid her face and sobbed.

Presently she perceived that it was growing dark, and getting up stiffly
she began to undo the things in her bag and spread them on the
dressing-table. She shrank from lighting the lights, and groped her way
about, trying to find what she needed. She seemed immeasurably far off
from every one, and most of all from herself. It was as if her
consciousness had been transmitted to some stranger whose thoughts and
gestures were indifferent to her...

Suddenly she heard a shrill tinkle, and with a beating heart she stood
still in the middle of the room. It was the telephone in her dressing-room—a
call, no doubt, from Adelaide Painter. Or could Owen have learned she was
in town? The thought alarmed her and she opened the door and stumbled
across the unlit room to the instrument. She held it to her ear, and heard
Darrowâs voice pronounce her name.

âWill you let me see you? Iâve come back—I had to come. Miss Painter
told me you were here.â

She began to tremble, and feared that he would guess it from her voice.
She did not know what she answered: she heard him say: âI canât hear.â She
called âYes!â and laid the telephone down, and caught it up again—but
he was gone. She wondered if her âYesâ had reached him.

She sat in her chair and listened. Why had she said that she would see
him? What did she mean to say to him when he came? Now and then, as she
sat there, the sense of his presence enveloped her as in her dream, and
she shut her eyes and felt his arms about her. Then she woke to reality
and shivered. A long time elapsed, and at length she said to herself: âHe
isnât coming.â

The door-bell rang as she said it, and she stood up, cold and trembling.
She thought: âCan he imagine thereâs any use in coming?â and moved forward
to bid the servant say she could not see him.

The door opened and she saw him standing in the drawing-room. The room was
cold and fireless, and a hard glare fell from the wall-lights on the
shrouded furniture and the white slips covering the curtains. He looked
pale and stern, with a frown of fatigue between his eyes; and she
remembered that in three days he had travelled from Givre to London and
back. It seemed incredible that all that had befallen her should have been
compressed within the space of three days!

âThank you,â he said as she came in.

She answered: âItâs better, I suppose——â

He came toward her and took her in his arms. She struggled a little,
afraid of yielding, but he pressed her to him, not bending to her but
holding her fast, as though he had found her after a long search: she
heard his hurried breathing. It seemed to come from her own breast, so
close he held her; and it was she who, at last, lifted up her face and
drew down his.

She freed herself and went and sat on a sofa at the other end of the room.
A mirror between the shrouded window-curtains showed her crumpled
travelling dress and the white face under her disordered hair.

She found her voice, and asked him how he had been able to leave London.
He answered that he had managed—heâd arranged it; and she saw he
hardly heard what she was saying.

âI had to see you,â he went on, and moved nearer, sitting down at her
side.

âYes; we must think of Owen——â

âOh, Owen—!â

Her mind had flown back to Sophy Vinerâs plea that she should let Darrow
return to Givre in order that Owen might be persuaded of the folly of his
suspicions. The suggestion was absurd, of course. She could not ask Darrow
to lend himself to such a fraud, even had she had the inhuman courage to
play her part in it. She was suddenly overwhelmed by the futility of every
attempt to reconstruct her ruined world. No, it was useless; and since it
was useless, every moment with Darrow was pure pain...

âIâve come to talk of myself, not of Owen,â she heard him saying. âWhen
you sent me away the other day I understood that it couldnât be otherwise—then.
But itâs not possible that you and I should part like that. If Iâm to lose
you, it must be for a better reason.â

âA better reason?â

âYes: a deeper one. One that means a fundamental disaccord between us.
This one doesnât—in spite of everything it doesnât. Thatâs what I
want you to see, and have the courage to acknowledge.â

âIf I saw it I should have the courage!â

âYes: courage was the wrong word. You have that. Thatâs why Iâm here.â

âBut I donât see it,â she continued sadly. âSo itâs useless, isnât it?—and
so cruel...â He was about to speak, but she went on: âI shall never
understand it—never!â

He looked at her. âYou will some day: you were made to feel everythingâ

âI should have thought this was a case of not feeling——â

âOn my part, you mean?â He faced her resolutely. âYes, it was: to my
shame.... What I meant was that when youâve lived a little longer youâll see
what complex blunderers we all are: how weâre struck blind sometimes, and
mad sometimes—and then, when our sight and our senses come back, how
we have to set to work, and build up, little by little, bit by bit, the
precious things weâd smashed to atoms without knowing it. Lifeâs just a
perpetual piecing together of broken bits.â

She looked up quickly. âThatâs what I feel: that you ought to——â

He stood up, interrupting her with a gesture. âOh, donât—donât say
what youâre going to! Men donât give their lives away like that. If you
wonât have mine, itâs at least my own, to do the best I can with.â

âThe best you can—thatâs what I mean! How can there be a âbestâ for
you thatâs made of some one elseâs worst?â

He sat down again with a groan. âI donât know! It seemed such a slight
thing—all on the surface—and Iâve gone aground on it because
it was on the surface. I see the horror of it just as you do. But I see, a
little more clearly, the extent, and the limits, of my wrong. Itâs not as
black as you imagine.â

She lowered her voice to say: âI suppose I shall never understand; but she
seems to love you...â

âThereâs my shame! That I didnât guess it, didnât fly from it. You say
youâll never understand: but why shouldnât you? Is it anything to be proud
of, to know so little of the strings that pull us? If you knew a little
more, I could tell you how such things happen without offending you; and
perhaps youâd listen without condemning me.â

âI donât condemn you.â She was dizzy with struggling impulses. She longed
to cry out: âI
do
understand! Iâve understood ever since youâve been
here!â For she was aware, in her own bosom, of sensations so separate from
her romantic thoughts of him that she saw her body and soul divided
against themselves. She recalled having read somewhere that in ancient
Rome the slaves were not allowed to wear a distinctive dress lest they
should recognize each other and learn their numbers and their power. So,
in herself, she discerned for the first time instincts and desires, which,
mute and unmarked, had gone to and fro in the dim passages of her mind,
and now hailed each other with a cry of mutiny.

âOh, I donât know what to think!â she broke out. âYou say you didnât know
she loved you. But you know it now. Doesnât that show you how you can put
the broken bits together?â

âCan you seriously think it would be doing so to marry one woman while I
care for another?â

âOh, I donât know.... I donât know...â The sense of her weakness made her
try to harden herself against his arguments.

âYou do know! Weâve often talked of such things: of the monstrousness of
useless sacrifices. If Iâm to expiate, itâs not in that way.â He added
abruptly: âItâs in having to say this to you now...â

She found no answer.

Through the silent apartment they heard the sudden peal of the door-bell,
and she rose to her feet. âOwen!â she instantly exclaimed.

âIs Owen in Paris?â

She explained in a rapid undertone what she had learned from Sophy Viner.

âShall I leave you?â Darrow asked.

âYes ... no...â She moved to the dining-room door, with the half-formed
purpose of making him pass out, and then turned back. âIt may be
Adelaide.â

They heard the outer door open, and a moment later Owen walked into the
room. He was pale, with excited eyes: as they fell on Darrow, Anna saw his
start of wonder. He made a slight sign of recognition, and then went up to
his step-mother with an air of exaggerated gaiety.

âYou furtive person! I ran across the omniscient Adelaide and heard from
her that youâd rushed up suddenly and secretly.â He stood between Anna and
Darrow, strained, questioning, dangerously on edge.

âI came up to meet Mr. Darrow,â Anna answered. âHis leaveâs been prolonged—heâs
going back with me.â

The words seemed to have uttered themselves without her will, yet she felt
a great sense of freedom as she spoke them.

The hard tension of Owenâs face changed to incredulous surprise. He looked
at Darrow. âThe merest luck ... a colleague whose wife was ill.... I came
straight back,â she heard the latter tranquilly explaining. His
self-command helped to steady her, and she smiled at Owen.

âWeâll all go back together tomorrow morning,â she said as she slipped her
arm through his.

XXXIII

Owen Leath did not go back with his step-mother to Givre. In reply to her
suggestion he announced his intention of staying on a day or two longer in
Paris.

Anna left alone by the first train the next morning. Darrow was to follow
in the afternoon. When Owen had left them the evening before, Darrow
waited a moment for her to speak; then, as she said nothing, he asked her
if she really wished him to return to Givre. She made a mute sign of
assent, and he added: âFor you know that, much as Iâm ready to do for
Owen, I canât do that for him—I canât go back to be sent away
again.â

âNo—no!â

He came nearer, and looked at her, and she went to him. All her fears
seemed to fall from her as he held her. It was a different feeling from
any she had known before: confused and turbid, as if secret shames and
rancours stirred in it, yet richer, deeper, more enslaving. She leaned her
head back and shut her eyes beneath his kisses. She knew now that she
could never give him up.

Nevertheless she asked him, the next morning, to let her go back alone to
Givre. She wanted time to think. She was convinced that what had happened
was inevitable, that she and Darrow belonged to each other, and that he
was right in saying no past folly could ever put them asunder. If there
was a shade of difference in her feeling for him it was that of an added
intensity. She felt restless, insecure out of his sight: she had a sense
of incompleteness, of passionate dependence, that was somehow at variance
with her own conception of her character.

It was partly the consciousness of this change in herself that made her
want to be alone. The solitude of her inner life had given her the habit
of these hours of self-examination, and she needed them as she needed her
morning plunge into cold water.

During the journey she tried to review what had happened in the light of
her new decision and of her sudden relief from pain. She seemed to herself
to have passed through some fiery initiation from which she had emerged
seared and quivering, but clutching to her breast a magic talisman. Sophy
Viner had cried out to her: âSome day youâll know!â and Darrow had used
the same words. They meant, she supposed, that when she had explored the
intricacies and darknesses of her own heart her judgment of others would
be less absolute. Well, she knew now—knew weaknesses and strengths
she had not dreamed of, and the deep discord and still deeper complicities
between what thought in her and what blindly wanted...

Her mind turned anxiously to Owen. At least the blow that was to fall on
him would not seem to have been inflicted by her hand. He would be left
with the impression that his breach with Sophy Viner was due to one of the
ordinary causes of such disruptions: though he must lose her, his memory
of her would not be poisoned. Anna never for a moment permitted herself
the delusion that she had renewed her promise to Darrow in order to spare
her step-son this last refinement of misery. She knew she had been
prompted by the irresistible impulse to hold fast to what was most
precious to her, and that Owenâs arrival on the scene had been the pretext
for her decision, and not its cause; yet she felt herself fortified by the
thought of what she had spared him. It was as though a star she had been
used to follow had shed its familiar ray on ways unknown to her.

All through these meditations ran the undercurrent of an absolute trust in
Sophy Viner. She thought of the girl with a mingling of antipathy and
confidence. It was humiliating to her pride to recognize kindred impulses
in a character which she would have liked to feel completely alien to her.
But what indeed was the girl really like? She seemed to have no scruples
and a thousand delicacies. She had given herself to Darrow, and concealed
the episode from Owen Leath, with no more apparent sense of debasement
than the vulgarest of adventuresses; yet she had instantly obeyed the
voice of her heart when it bade her part from the one and serve the other.

Anna tried to picture what the girlâs life must have been: what
experiences, what initiations, had formed her. But her own training had
been too different: there were veils she could not lift. She looked back
at her married life, and its colourless uniformity took on an air of high
restraint and order. Was it because she had been so incurious that it had
worn that look to her? It struck her with amazement that she had never
given a thought to her husbandâs past, or wondered what he did and where
he went when he was away from her. If she had been asked what she supposed
he thought about when they were apart, she would instantly have answered:
his snuff-boxes. It had never occurred to her that he might have passions,
interests, preoccupations of which she was absolutely ignorant. Yet he
went up to Paris rather regularly: ostensibly to attend sales and
exhibitions, or to confer with dealers and collectors. She tried to
picture him, straight, trim, beautifully brushed and varnished, walking
furtively down a quiet street, and looking about him before he slipped
into a doorway. She understood now that she had been cold to him: what
more likely than that he had sought compensations? All men were like that,
she supposed—no doubt her simplicity had amused him.

In the act of transposing Fraser Leath into a Don Juan she was pulled up
by the ironic perception that she was simply trying to justify Darrow. She
wanted to think that all men were âlike thatâ because Darrow was âlike
thatâ: she wanted to justify her acceptance of the fact by persuading
herself that only through such concessions could women like herself hope
to keep what they could not give up. And suddenly she was filled with
anger at her blindness, and then at her disastrous attempt to see. Why had
she forced the truth out of Darrow? If only she had held her tongue
nothing need ever have been known. Sophy Viner would have broken her
engagement, Owen would have been sent around the world, and her own dream
would have been unshattered. But she had probed, insisted, cross-examined,
not rested till she had dragged the secret to the light. She was one of
the luckless women who always have the wrong audacities, and who always
know it...

Was it she, Anna Leath, who was picturing herself to herself in that way?
She recoiled from her thoughts as if with a sense of demoniac possession,
and there flashed through her the longing to return to her old state of
fearless ignorance. If at that moment she could have kept Darrow from
following her to Givre she would have done so...

But he came; and with the sight of him the turmoil fell and she felt
herself reassured, rehabilitated. He arrived toward dusk, and she motored
to Francheuil to meet him. She wanted to see him as soon as possible, for
she had divined, through the new insight that was in her, that only his
presence could restore her to a normal view of things. In the motor, as
they left the town and turned into the high-road, he lifted her hand and
kissed it, and she leaned against him, and felt the currents flow between
them. She was grateful to him for not saying anything, and for not
expecting her to speak. She said to herself: âHe never makes a mistake—he
always knows what to doâ; and then she thought with a start that it was
doubtless because he had so often been in such situations. The idea that
his tact was a kind of professional expertness filled her with repugnance,
and insensibly she drew away from him. He made no motion to bring her
nearer, and she instantly thought that that was calculated too. She sat
beside him in frozen misery, wondering whether, henceforth, she would
measure in this way his every look and gesture. Neither of them spoke
again till the motor turned under the dark arch of the avenue, and they
saw the lights of Givre twinkling at its end. Then Darrow laid his hand on
hers and said: âI know, dear—â and the hardness in her melted. âHeâs
suffering as I am,â she thought; and for a moment the baleful fact between
them seemed to draw them closer instead of walling them up in their
separate wretchedness.

It was wonderful to be once more re-entering the doors of Givre with him,
and as the old house received them into its mellow silence she had again
the sense of passing out of a dreadful dream into the reassurance of
kindly and familiar things. It did not seem possible that these quiet
rooms, so full of the slowly-distilled accumulations of a fastidious
taste, should have been the scene of tragic dissensions. The memory of
them seemed to be shut out into the night with the closing and barring of
its doors.

At the tea-table in the oak-room they found Madame de Chantelle and Effie.
The little girl, catching sight of Darrow, raced down the drawing-rooms to
meet him, and returned in triumph on his shoulder. Anna looked at them
with a smile. Effie, for all her graces, was chary of such favours, and
her mother knew that in according them to Darrow she had admitted him to
the circle where Owen had hitherto ruled.

Over the tea-table Darrow gave Madame de Chantelle the explanation of his
sudden return from England. On reaching London, he told her, he had found
that the secretary he was to have replaced was detained there by the
illness of his wife. The Ambassador, knowing Darrowâs urgent reasons for
wishing to be in France, had immediately proposed his going back, and
awaiting at Givre the summons to relieve his colleague; and he had jumped
into the first train, without even waiting to telegraph the news of his
release. He spoke naturally, easily, in his usual quiet voice, taking his
tea from Effie, helping himself to the toast she handed, and stooping now
and then to stroke the dozing terrier. And suddenly, as Anna listened to
his explanation, she asked herself if it were true.

The question, of course, was absurd. There was no possible reason why he
should invent a false account of his return, and every probability that
the version he gave was the real one. But he had looked and spoken in the
same way when he had answered her probing questions about Sophy Viner, and
she reflected with a chill of fear that she would never again know if he
were speaking the truth or not. She was sure he loved her, and she did not
fear his insincerity as much as her own distrust of him. For a moment it
seemed to her that this must corrupt the very source of love; then she
said to herself: âBy and bye, when I am altogether his, we shall be so
near each other that there will be no room for any doubts between us.â But
the doubts were there now, one moment lulled to quiescence, the next more
torturingly alert. When the nurse appeared to summon Effie, the little
girl, after kissing her grandmother, entrenched herself on Darrowâs knee
with the imperious demand to be carried up to bed; and Anna, while she
laughingly protested, said to herself with a pang: âCan I give her a
father about whom I think such things?â

The thought of Effie, and of what she owed to Effie, had been the
fundamental reason for her delays and hesitations when she and Darrow had
come together again in England. Her own feeling was so clear that but for
that scruple she would have put her hand in his at once. But till she had
seen him again she had never considered the possibility of re-marriage,
and when it suddenly confronted her it seemed, for the moment, to
disorganize the life she had planned for herself and her child. She had
not spoken of this to Darrow because it appeared to her a subject to be
debated within her own conscience. The question, then, was not as to his
fitness to become the guide and guardian of her child; nor did she fear
that her love for him would deprive Effie of the least fraction of her
tenderness, since she did not think of love as something measured and
exhaustible but as a treasure perpetually renewed. What she questioned was
her right to introduce into her life any interests and duties which might
rob Effie of a part of her time, or lessen the closeness of their daily
intercourse.

She had decided this question as it was inevitable that she should; but
now another was before her. Assuredly, at her age, there was no possible
reason why she should cloister herself to bring up her daughter; but there
was every reason for not marrying a man in whom her own faith was not
complete...

XXXIV

When she woke the next morning she felt a great lightness of heart. She
recalled her last awakening at Givre, three days before, when it had
seemed as though all her life had gone down in darkness. Now Darrow was
once more under the same roof with her, and once more his nearness
sufficed to make the looming horror drop away. She could almost have
smiled at her scruples of the night before: as she looked back on them
they seemed to belong to the old ignorant timorous time when she had
feared to look life in the face, and had been blind to the mysteries and
contradictions of the human heart because her own had not been revealed to
her. Darrow had said: âYou were made to feel everythingâ; and to feel was
surely better than to judge.

When she came downstairs he was already in the oak-room with Effie and
Madame de Chantelle, and the sense of reassurance which his presence gave
her was merged in the relief of not being able to speak of what was
between them. But there it was, inevitably, and whenever they looked at
each other they saw it. In her dread of giving it a more tangible shape
she tried to devise means of keeping the little girl with her, and, when
the latter had been called away by the nurse, found an excuse for
following Madame de Chantelle upstairs to the purple sitting-room. But a
confidential talk with Madame de Chantelle implied the detailed discussion
of plans of which Anna could hardly yet bear to consider the vaguest
outline: the date of her marriage, the relative advantages of sailing from
London or Lisbon, the possibility of hiring a habitable house at their new
post; and, when these problems were exhausted, the application of the same
method to the subject of Owenâs future.

His grandmother, having no suspicion of the real reason of Sophy Vinerâs
departure, had thought it âextremely suitableâ of the young girl to
withdraw to the shelter of her old friendsâ roof in the hour of bridal
preparation. This maidenly retreat had in fact impressed Madame de
Chantelle so favourably that she was disposed for the first time to talk
over Owenâs projects; and as every human event translated itself for her
into terms of social and domestic detail, Anna had perforce to travel the
same round again. She felt a momentary relief when Darrow presently joined
them; but his coming served only to draw the conversation back to the
question of their own future, and Anna felt a new pang as she heard him
calmly and lucidly discussing it. Did such self-possession imply
indifference or insincerity? In that problem her mind perpetually
revolved; and she dreaded the one answer as much as the other.

She was resolved to keep on her course as though nothing had happened: to
marry Darrow and never let the consciousness of the past intrude itself
between them; but she was beginning to feel that the only way of attaining
to this state of detachment from the irreparable was once for all to turn
back with him to its contemplation. As soon as this desire had germinated
it became so strong in her that she regretted having promised Effie to
take her out for the afternoon. But she could think of no pretext for
disappointing the little girl, and soon after luncheon the three set forth
in the motor to show Darrow a chateau famous in the annals of the region.
During their excursion Anna found it impossible to guess from his
demeanour if Effieâs presence between them was as much of a strain to his
composure as to hers. He remained imperturbably good-humoured and
appreciative while they went the round of the monument, and she remarked
only that when he thought himself unnoticed his face grew grave and his
answers came less promptly.

On the way back, two or three miles from Givre, she suddenly proposed that
they should walk home through the forest which skirted that side of the
park. Darrow acquiesced, and they got out and sent Effie on in the motor.
Their way led through a bit of sober French woodland, flat as a faded
tapestry, but with gleams of live emerald lingering here and there among
its browns and ochres. The luminous grey air gave vividness to its dying
colours, and veiled the distant glimpses of the landscape in soft
uncertainty. In such a solitude Anna had fancied it would be easier to
speak; but as she walked beside Darrow over the deep soundless flooring of
brown moss the words on her lips took flight again. It seemed impossible
to break the spell of quiet joy which his presence laid on her, and when
he began to talk of the place they had just visited she answered his
questions and then waited for what he should say next.... No, decidedly she
could not speak; she no longer even knew what she had meant to say...

The same experience repeated itself several times that day and the next.
When she and Darrow were apart she exhausted herself in appeal and
interrogation, she formulated with a fervent lucidity every point in her
imaginary argument. But as soon as she was alone with him something deeper
than reason and subtler than shyness laid its benumbing touch upon her,
and the desire to speak became merely a dim disquietude, through which his
looks, his words, his touch, reached her as through a mist of bodily pain.
Yet this inertia was torn by wild flashes of resistance, and when they
were apart she began to prepare again what she meant to say to him.

She knew he could not be with her without being aware of this inner
turmoil, and she hoped he would break the spell by some releasing word.
But she presently understood that he recognized the futility of words, and
was resolutely bent on holding her to her own purpose of behaving as if
nothing had happened. Once more she inwardly accused him of insensibility,
and her imagination was beset by tormenting visions of his past.... Had such
things happened to him before? If the episode had been an isolated
accident—âa moment of folly and madnessâ, as he had called it—she
could understand, or at least begin to understand (for at a certain point
her imagination always turned back); but if it were a mere link in a chain
of similar experiments, the thought of it dishonoured her whole past...

Effie, in the interregnum between governesses, had been given leave to
dine downstairs; and Anna, on the evening of Darrowâs return, kept the
little girl with her till long after the nurse had signalled from the
drawing-room door. When at length she had been carried off, Anna proposed
a game of cards, and after this diversion had drawn to its languid close
she said good-night to Darrow and followed Madame de Chantelle upstairs.
But Madame de Chantelle never sat up late, and the second evening, with
the amiably implied intention of leaving Anna and Darrow to themselves,
she took an earlier leave of them than usual.

Anna sat silent, listening to her small stiff steps as they minced down
the hall and died out in the distance. Madame de Chantelle had broken her
wooden embroidery frame, and Darrow, having offered to repair it, had
drawn his chair up to a table that held a lamp. Anna watched him as he sat
with bent head and knitted brows, trying to fit together the disjoined
pieces. The sight of him, so tranquilly absorbed in this trifling
business, seemed to give to the quiet room a perfume of intimacy, to fill
it with a sense of sweet familiar habit; and it came over her again that
she knew nothing of the inner thoughts of this man who was sitting by her
as a husband might. The lamplight fell on his white forehead, on the
healthy brown of his cheek, the backs of his thin sunburnt hands. As she
watched the hands her sense of them became as vivid as a touch, and she
said to herself: âThat other woman has sat and watched him as I am doing.
She has known him as I have never known him.... Perhaps he is thinking of
that now. Or perhaps he has forgotten it all as completely as I have
forgotten everything that happened to me before he came...â

He looked young, active, stored with strength and energy; not the man for
vain repinings or long memories. She wondered what she had to hold or
satisfy him. He loved her now; she had no doubt of that; but how could she
hope to keep him? They were so nearly of an age that already she felt
herself his senior. As yet the difference was not visible; outwardly at
least they were matched; but ill-health or unhappiness would soon do away
with this equality. She thought with a pang of bitterness: âHe wonât grow
any older because he doesnât feel things; and because he doesnât, I

shall
...â

And when she ceased to please him, what then? Had he the tradition of
faith to the spoken vow, or the deeper piety of the unspoken dedication?
What was his theory, what his inner conviction in such matters? But what
did she care for his convictions or his theories? No doubt he loved her
now, and believed he would always go on loving her, and was persuaded
that, if he ceased to, his loyalty would be proof against the change. What
she wanted to know was not what he thought about it in advance, but what
would impel or restrain him at the crucial hour. She put no faith in her
own arts: she was too sure of having none! And if some beneficent
enchanter had bestowed them on her, she knew now that she would have
rejected the gift. She could hardly conceive of wanting the kind of love
that was a state one could be cozened into...

Darrow, putting away the frame, walked across the room and sat down beside
her; and she felt he had something special to say.

âTheyâre sure to send for me in a day or two now,â he began.

She made no answer, and he continued: âYouâll tell me before I go what day
Iâm to come back and get you?â

It was the first time since his return to Givre that he had made any
direct allusion to the date of their marriage; and instead of answering
him she broke out: âThereâs something Iâve been wanting you to know. The
other day in Paris I saw Miss Viner.â

She saw him flush with the intensity of his surprise.

âYou sent for her?â

âNo; she heard from Adelaide that I was in Paris and she came. She came
because she wanted to urge me to marry you. I thought you ought to know
what she had done.â

Darrow stood up. âIâm glad youâve told me.â He spoke with a visible effort
at composure. Her eyes followed him as he moved away.

âIs that all?â he asked after an interval.

âIt seems to me a great deal.â

âItâs what sheâd already asked me.â His voice showed her how deeply he was
moved, and a throb of jealousy shot through her.

âOh, it was for your sake, I know!â He made no answer, and she added:
âSheâs been exceedingly generous.... Why shouldnât we speak of it?â

She had lowered her head, but through her dropped lids she seemed to be
watching the crowded scene of his face.

âIâve not shrunk from speaking of it.â

âSpeaking of her, then, I mean. It seems to me that if I could talk to you
about her I should know better——â

She broke off, confused, and he questioned: âWhat is it you want to know
better?â

The colour rose to her forehead. How could she tell him what she scarcely
dared own to herself? There was nothing she did not want to know, no fold
or cranny of his secret that her awakened imagination did not strain to
penetrate; but she could not expose Sophy Viner to the base fingerings of
a retrospective jealousy, nor Darrow to the temptation of belittling her
in the effort to better his own case. The girl had been magnificent, and
the only worthy return that Anna could make was to take Darrow from her
without a question if she took him at all...

She lifted her eyes to his face. âI think I only wanted to speak her name.
Itâs not right that we should seem so afraid of it. If I were really
afraid of it I should have to give you up,â she said.

He bent over her and caught her to him. âAh, you canât give me up now!â he
exclaimed.

She suffered him to hold her fast without speaking; but the old dread was
between them again, and it was on her lips to cry out: âHow can I help it,
when I
am
so afraid?â

XXXV

The next morning the dread was still there, and she understood that she
must snatch herself out of the torpor of the will into which she had been
gradually sinking, and tell Darrow that she could not be his wife.

The knowledge came to her in the watches of a sleepless night, when,
through the tears of disenchanted passion, she stared back upon her past.
There it lay before her, her sole romance, in all its paltry poverty, the
cheapest of cheap adventures, the most pitiful of sentimental blunders.
She looked about her room, the room where, for so many years, if her heart
had been quiescent her thoughts had been alive, and pictured herself
henceforth cowering before a throng of mean suspicions, of unavowed
compromises and concessions. In that moment of self-searching she saw that
Sophy Viner had chosen the better part, and that certain renunciations
might enrich where possession would have left a desert.

Passionate reactions of instinct fought against these efforts of her will.
Why should past or future coerce her, when the present was so securely
hers? Why insanely surrender what the other would after all never have?
Her sense of irony whispered that if she sent away Darrow it would not be
to Sophy Viner, but to the first woman who crossed his path—as, in a
similar hour, Sophy Viner herself had crossed it.... But the mere fact that
she could think such things of him sent her shuddering back to the
opposite pole. She pictured herself gradually subdued to such a conception
of life and love, she pictured Effie growing up under the influence of the
woman she saw herself becoming—and she hid her eyes from the
humiliation of the picture...

They were at luncheon when the summons that Darrow expected was brought to
him. He handed the telegram to Anna, and she learned that his Ambassador,
on the way to a German cure, was to be in Paris the next evening and
wished to confer with him there before he went back to London. The idea
that the decisive moment was at hand was so agitating to her that when
luncheon was over she slipped away to the terrace and thence went down
alone to the garden. The day was grey but mild, with the heaviness of
decay in the air. She rambled on aimlessly, following under the denuded
boughs the path she and Darrow had taken on their first walk to the river.
She was sure he would not try to overtake her: sure he would guess why she
wished to be alone. There were moments when it seemed to double her
loneliness to be so certain of his reading her heart while she was so
desperately ignorant of his...

She wandered on for more than an hour, and when she returned to the house
she saw, as she entered the hall, that Darrow was seated at the desk in
Owenâs study. He heard her step, and looking up turned in his chair
without rising. Their eyes met, and she saw that his were clear and
smiling. He had a heap of papers at his elbow and was evidently engaged in
some official correspondence. She wondered that he could address himself
so composedly to his task, and then ironically reflected that such
detachment was a sign of his superiority. She crossed the threshold and
went toward him; but as she advanced she had a sudden vision of Owen,
standing outside in the cold autumn dusk and watching Darrow and Sophy
Viner as they faced each other across the lamplit desk.... The evocation was
so vivid that it caught her breath like a blow, and she sank down
helplessly on the divan among the piled-up books. Distinctly, at the
moment, she understood that the end had come. âWhen he speaks to me I will
tell him!â she thought...

Darrow, laying aside his pen, looked at her for a moment in silence; then
he stood up and shut the door.

âI must go to-morrow early,â he said, sitting down beside her. His voice
was grave, with a slight tinge of sadness. She said to herself: âHe knows
what I am feeling...â and now the thought made her feel less alone. The
expression of his face was stern and yet tender: for the first time she
understood what he had suffered.

She had no doubt as to the necessity of giving him up, but it was
impossible to tell him so then. She stood up and said: âIâll leave you to
your letters.â He made no protest, but merely answered: âYouâll come down
presently for a walk?â and it occurred to her at once that she would walk
down to the river with him, and give herself for the last time the tragic
luxury of sitting at his side in the little pavilion. âPerhaps,â she
thought, âit will be easier to tell him there.â

It did not, on the way home from their walk, become any easier to tell
him; but her secret decision to do so before he left gave her a kind of
factitious calm and laid a melancholy ecstasy upon the hour. Still
skirting the subject that fanned their very faces with its flame, they
clung persistently to other topics, and it seemed to Anna that their minds
had never been nearer together than in this hour when their hearts were so
separate. In the glow of interchanged love she had grown less conscious of
that other glow of interchanged thought which had once illumined her mind.
She had forgotten how Darrow had widened her world and lengthened out all
her perspectives, and with a pang of double destitution she saw herself
alone among her shrunken thoughts.

For the first time, then, she had a clear vision of what her life would be
without him. She imagined herself trying to take up the daily round, and
all that had lightened and animated it seemed equally lifeless and vain.
She tried to think of herself as wholly absorbed in her daughterâs
development, like other mothers she had seen; but she supposed those
mothers must have had stored memories of happiness to nourish them. She
had had nothing, and all her starved youth still claimed its due.

When she went up to dress for dinner she said to herself: âIâll have my
last evening with him, and then, before we say good night, Iâll tell him.â

This postponement did not seem unjustified. Darrow had shown her how he
dreaded vain words, how resolved he was to avoid all fruitless discussion.
He must have been intensely aware of what had been going on in her mind
since his return, yet when she had attempted to reveal it to him he had
turned from the revelation. She was therefore merely following the line he
had traced in behaving, till the final moment came, as though there were
nothing more to say...

That moment seemed at last to be at hand when, at her usual hour after
dinner, Madame de Chantelle rose to go upstairs. She lingered a little to
bid good-bye to Darrow, whom she was not likely to see in the morning; and
her affable allusions to his prompt return sounded in Annaâs ear like the
note of destiny.

A cold rain had fallen all day, and for greater warmth and intimacy they
had gone after dinner to the oak-room, shutting out the chilly vista of
the farther drawing-rooms. The autumn wind, coming up from the river,
cried about the house with a voice of loss and separation; and Anna and
Darrow sat silent, as if they feared to break the hush that shut them in.
The solitude, the fire-light, the harmony of soft hangings and old dim
pictures, wove about them a spell of security through which Anna felt, far
down in her heart, the muffled beat of an inextinguishable bliss. How
could she have thought that this last moment would be the moment to speak
to him, when it seemed to have gathered up into its flight all the
scattered splendours of her dream?

XXXVI

Darrow continued to stand by the door after it had closed. Anna felt that
he was looking at her, and sat still, disdaining to seek refuge in any
evasive word or movement. For the last time she wanted to let him take
from her the fulness of what the sight of her could give.

He crossed over and sat down on the sofa. For a moment neither of them
spoke; then he said: âTo-night, dearest, I must have my answer.â

She straightened herself under the shock of his seeming to take the very
words from her lips.

âTo-night?â was all that she could falter.

âI must be off by the early train. There wonât be more than a moment in
the morning.â

He had taken her hand, and she said to herself that she must free it
before she could go on with what she had to say. Then she rejected this
concession to a weakness she was resolved to defy. To the end she would
leave her hand in his hand, her eyes in his eyes: she would not, in their
final hour together, be afraid of any part of her love for him.

âYouâll tell me to-night, dear,â he insisted gently; and his insistence
gave her the strength to speak.

âThereâs something I must ask you,â she broke out, perceiving, as she
heard her words, that they were not in the least what she had meant to
say.

He sat still, waiting, and she pressed on: âDo such things happen to men
often?â

The quiet room seemed to resound with the long reverberations of her
question. She looked away from him, and he released her and stood up.

âI donât know what happens to other men. Such a thing never happened to
me...â

She turned her eyes back to his face. She felt like a traveller on a giddy
path between a cliff and a precipice: there was nothing for it now but to
go on.

âHad it ... had it begun ... before you met her in Paris?â

âNo; a thousand times no! Iâve told you the facts as they were.â

âAll the facts?â

He turned abruptly. âWhat do you mean?â

Her throat was dry and the loud pulses drummed in her temples.

âI mean—about her.... Perhaps you knew ... knew things about
her ... beforehand.â

She stopped. The room had grown profoundly still. A log dropped to the
hearth and broke there in a hissing shower.

Darrow spoke in a clear voice. âI knew nothing, absolutely nothing,â he
said.

She had the answer to her inmost doubt—to her last shameful unavowed
hope. She sat powerless under her woe.

He walked to the fireplace and pushed back the broken log with his foot. A
flame shot out of it, and in the upward glare she saw his pale face, stern
with misery.

âIs that all?â he asked.

She made a slight sign with her head and he came slowly back to her. âThen
is this to be good-bye?â

Again she signed a faint assent, and he made no effort to touch her or
draw nearer. âYou understand that I shaânât come back?â

He was looking at her, and she tried to return his look, but her eyes were
blind with tears, and in dread of his seeing them she got up and walked
away. He did not follow her, and she stood with her back to him, staring
at a bowl of carnations on a little table strewn with books. Her tears
magnified everything she looked at, and the streaked petals of the
carnations, their fringed edges and frail curled stamens, pressed upon
her, huge and vivid. She noticed among the books a volume of verse he had
sent her from England, and tried to remember whether it was before or
after...

She felt that he was waiting for her to speak, and at last she turned to
him. âI shall see you to-morrow before you go...â

He made no answer.

She moved toward the door and he held it open for her. She saw his hand on
the door, and his seal ring in its setting of twisted silver; and the
sense of the end of all things came to her.

They walked down the drawing-rooms, between the shadowy reflections of
screens and cabinets, and mounted the stairs side by side. At the end of
the gallery, a lamp brought out turbid gleams in the smoky battle-piece
above it.

On the landing Darrow stopped; his room was the nearest to the stairs.
âGood night,â he said, holding out his hand.

As Anna gave him hers the springs of grief broke loose in her. She
struggled with her sobs, and subdued them; but her breath came unevenly,
and to hide her agitation she leaned on him and pressed her face against
his arm.

âDonât—donât,â he whispered, soothing her.

Her troubled breathing sounded loudly in the silence of the sleeping
house. She pressed her lips tight, but could not stop the nervous
pulsations in her throat, and he put an arm about her and, opening his
door, drew her across the threshold of his room. The door shut behind her
and she sat down on the lounge at the foot of the bed. The pulsations in
her throat had ceased, but she knew they would begin again if she tried to
speak.

Darrow walked away and leaned against the mantelpiece. The red-veiled lamp
shone on his books and papers, on the arm-chair by the fire, and the
scattered objects on his dressing-table. A log glimmered on the hearth,
and the room was warm and faintly smoke-scented. It was the first time she
had ever been in a room he lived in, among his personal possessions and
the traces of his daily usage. Every object about her seemed to contain a
particle of himself: the whole air breathed of him, steeping her in the
sense of his intimate presence.

Suddenly she thought: âThis is what Sophy Viner knewâ...and with a
torturing precision she pictured them alone in such a scene.... Had he taken
the girl to an hotel ... where did people go in such cases? Wherever they
were, the silence of night had been around them, and the things he used
had been strewn about the room.... Anna, ashamed of dwelling on the detested
vision, stood up with a confused impulse of flight; then a wave of
contrary feeling arrested her and she paused with lowered head.

Darrow had come forward as she rose, and she perceived that he was waiting
for her to bid him good night. It was clear that no other possibility had
even brushed his mind; and the fact, for some dim reason, humiliated her.
âWhy not ... why not?â something whispered in her, as though his
forbearance, his tacit recognition of her pride, were a slight on other
qualities she wanted him to feel in her.

âIn the morning, then?â she heard him say.

âYes, in the morning,â she repeated.

She continued to stand in the same place, looking vaguely about the room.
For once before they parted—since part they must—she longed to
be to him all that Sophy Viner had been; but she remained rooted to the
floor, unable to find a word or imagine a gesture that should express her
meaning. Exasperated by her helplessness, she thought: âDonât I feel
things as other women do?â

Her eye fell on a note-case she had given him. It was worn at the corners
with the friction of his pocket and distended with thickly packed papers.
She wondered if he carried her letters in it, and she put her hand out and
touched it.

All that he and she had ever felt or seen, their close encounters of word
and look, and the closer contact of their silences, trembled through her
at the touch. She remembered things he had said that had been like new
skies above her head: ways he had that seemed a part of the air she
breathed. The faint warmth of her girlish love came back to her, gathering
heat as it passed through her thoughts; and her heart rocked like a boat
on the surge of its long long memories. âItâs because I love him in too
many ways,â she thought; and slowly she turned to the door.

She was aware that Darrow was still silently watching her, but he neither
stirred nor spoke till she had reached the threshold. Then he met her
there and caught her in his arms.

âNot to-night—donât tell me to-night!â he whispered; and she leaned
away from him, closing her eyes for an instant, and then slowly opening
them to the flood of light in his.

XXXVII

Anna and Darrow, the next day, sat alone in a compartment of the Paris
train.

Anna, when they entered it, had put herself in the farthest corner and
placed her bag on the adjoining seat. She had decided suddenly to
accompany Darrow to Paris, had even persuaded him to wait for a later
train in order that they might travel together. She had an intense longing
to be with him, an almost morbid terror of losing sight of him for a
moment: when he jumped out of the train and ran back along the platform to
buy a newspaper for her she felt as though she should never see him again,
and shivered with the cold misery of her last journey to Paris, when she
had thought herself parted from him forever. Yet she wanted to keep him at
a distance, on the other side of the compartment, and as the train moved
out of the station she drew from her bag the letters she had thrust in it
as she left the house, and began to glance over them so that her lowered
lids should hide her eyes from him.

She was his now, his for life: there could never again be any question of
sacrificing herself to Effieâs welfare, or to any other abstract
conception of duty. Effie of course would not suffer; Anna would pay for
her bliss as a wife by redoubled devotion as a mother. Her scruples were
not overcome; but for the time their voices were drowned in the tumultuous
rumour of her happiness.

As she opened her letters she was conscious that Darrowâs gaze was fixed
on her, and gradually it drew her eyes upward, and she drank deep of the
passionate tenderness in his. Then the blood rose to her face and she felt
again the desire to shield herself. She turned back to her letters and her
glance lit on an envelope inscribed in Owenâs hand.

Her heart began to beat oppressively: she was in a mood when the simplest
things seemed ominous. What could Owen have to say to her? Only the first
page was covered, and it contained simply the announcement that, in the
company of a young compatriot who was studying at the Beaux Arts, he had
planned to leave for Spain the following evening.

âHe hasnât seen her, then!â was Annaâs instant thought; and her feeling
was a strange compound of humiliation and relief. The girl had kept her
word, lived up to the line of conduct she had set herself; and Anna had
failed in the same attempt. She did not reproach herself with her failure;
but she would have been happier if there had been less discrepancy between
her words to Sophy Viner and the act which had followed them. It irritated
her obscurely that the girl should have been so much surer of her power to
carry out her purpose...

Anna looked up and saw that Darrowâs eyes were on the newspaper. He seemed
calm and secure, almost indifferent to her presence. âWill it become a
matter of course to him so soon?â she wondered with a twinge of jealousy.
She sat motionless, her eyes fixed on him, trying to make him feel the
attraction of her gaze as she felt his. It surprised and shamed her to
detect a new element in her love for him: a sort of suspicious tyrannical
tenderness that seemed to deprive it of all serenity. Finally he looked
up, his smile enveloped her, and she felt herself his in every fibre, his
so completely and inseparably that she saw the vanity of imagining any
other fate for herself.

To give herself a countenance she held out Owenâs letter. He took it and
glanced down the page, his face grown grave. She waited nervously till he
looked up.

âThatâs a good plan; the best thing that could happen,â he said, a just
perceptible shade of constraint in his tone.

âOh, yes,â she hastily assented. She was aware of a faint current of
relief silently circulating between them. They were both glad that Owen
was going, that for a while he would be out of their way; and it seemed to
her horrible that so much of the stuff of their happiness should be made
of such unavowed feelings...

âI shall see him this evening,â she said, wishing Darrow to feel that she
was not afraid of meeting her step-son.

âYes, of course; perhaps he might dine with you.â

The words struck her as strangely obtuse. Darrow was to meet his
Ambassador at the station on the latterâs arrival, and would in all
probability have to spend the evening with him, and Anna knew he had been
concerned at the thought of having to leave her alone. But how could he
speak in that careless tone of her dining with Owen? She lowered her voice
to say: âIâm afraid heâs desperately unhappy.â

He answered, with a tinge of impatience: âItâs much the best thing that he
should travel.â

âYes—but donât you feel...â She broke off. She knew how he disliked
these idle returns on the irrevocable, and her fear of doing or saying
what he disliked was tinged by a new instinct of subserviency against
which her pride revolted. She thought to herself: âHe will see the change,
and grow indifferent to me as he did to
her
...â and for a moment it seemed
to her that she was reliving the experience of Sophy Viner.

Darrow made no attempt to learn the end of her unfinished sentence. He
handed back Owenâs letter and returned to his newspaper; and when he
looked up from it a few minutes later it was with a clear brow and a smile
that irresistibly drew her back to happier thoughts.

The train was just entering a station, and a moment later their
compartment was invaded by a commonplace couple preoccupied with the
bestowal of bulging packages. Anna, at their approach, felt the possessive
pride of the woman in love when strangers are between herself and the man
she loves. She asked Darrow to open the window, to place her bag in the
net, to roll her rug into a cushion for her feet; and while he was thus
busied with her she was conscious of a new devotion in his tone, in his
way of bending over her and meeting her eyes. He went back to his seat,
and they looked at each other like lovers smiling at a happy secret.

Anna, before going back to Givre, had suggested Owenâs moving into her
apartment, but he had preferred to remain at the hotel to which he had
sent his luggage, and on arriving in Paris she decided to drive there at
once. She was impatient to have the meeting over, and glad that Darrow was
obliged to leave her at the station in order to look up a colleague at the
Embassy. She dreaded his seeing Owen again, and yet dared not tell him so,
and to ensure his remaining away she mentioned an urgent engagement with
her dress-maker and a long list of commissions to be executed for Madame
de Chantelle.

âI shall see you to-morrow morning,â she said; but he replied with a smile
that he would certainly find time to come to her for a moment on his way
back from meeting the Ambassador; and when he had put her in a cab he
leaned through the window to press his lips to hers.

She blushed like a girl, thinking, half vexed, half happy: âYesterday he
would not have done it...â and a dozen scarcely definable differences in
his look and manner seemed all at once to be summed up in the boyish act.
âAfter all, Iâm engaged to him,â she reflected, and then smiled at the
absurdity of the word. The next instant, with a pang of self-reproach, she
remembered Sophy Vinerâs cry: âI knew all the while he didnât care...â
âPoor thing, oh poor thing!â Anna murmured...

At Owenâs hotel she waited in a tremor while the porter went in search of
him. Word was presently brought back that he was in his room and begged
her to come up, and as she crossed the hall she caught sight of his
portmanteaux lying on the floor, already labelled for departure.

Owen sat at a table writing, his back to the door; and when he stood up
the window was behind him, so that, in the rainy afternoon light, his
features were barely discernible.

âDearest—so youâre really off?â she said, hesitating a moment on the
threshold.

He pushed a chair forward, and they sat down, each waiting for the other
to speak. Finally she put some random question about his
travelling-companion, a slow shy meditative youth whom he had once or
twice brought down to Givre. She reflected that it was natural he should
have given this uncommunicative comrade the preference over his livelier
acquaintances, and aloud she said: âIâm so glad Fred Rempson can go with
you.â

Owen answered in the same tone, and for a few minutes their talk dragged
itself on over a dry waste of common-places. Anna noticed that, though
ready enough to impart his own plans, Owen studiously abstained from
putting any questions about hers. It was evident from his allusions that
he meant to be away for some time, and he presently asked her if she would
give instructions about packing and sending after him some winter clothes
he had left at Givre. This gave her the opportunity to say that she
expected to go back within a day or two and would attend to the matter as
soon as she returned. She added: âI came up this morning with George, who
is going on to London to-morrow,â intending, by the use of Darrowâs
Christian name, to give Owen the chance to speak of her marriage. But he
made no comment, and she continued to hear the name sounding on
unfamiliarly between them.

The room was almost dark, and she finally stood up and glanced about for
the light-switch, saying: âI canât see you, dear.â

âOh, donât—I hate the light!â Owen exclaimed, catching her by the
wrist and pushing her back into her seat. He gave a nervous laugh and
added: âIâm half-blind with neuralgia. I suppose itâs this beastly rain.â

âYes; it will do you good to get down to Spain.â

She asked if he had the remedies the doctor had given him for a previous
attack, and on his replying that he didnât know what heâd done with the
stuff, she sprang up, offering to go to the chemistâs. It was a relief to
have something to do for him, and she knew from his âOh, thanks—would
you?â that it was a relief to him to have a pretext for not detaining her.
His natural impulse would have been to declare that he didnât want any
drugs, and would be all right in no time; and his acquiescence showed her
how profoundly he felt the uselessness of their trying to prolong their
talk. His face was now no more than a white blur in the dusk, but she felt
its indistinctness as a veil drawn over aching intensities of expression.
âHe knows ... he knows...â she said to herself, and wondered whether the
truth had been revealed to him by some corroborative fact or by the sheer
force of divination.

He had risen also, and was clearly waiting for her to go, and she turned
to the door, saying: âIâll be back in a moment.â

âOh, donât come up again, please!â He paused, embarrassed. âI mean—I
may not be here. Iâve got to go and pick up Rempson, and see about some
final things with him.â She stopped on the threshold with a sinking heart.
He meant this to be their leave-taking, then—and he had not even
asked her when she was to be married, or spoken of seeing her again before
she set out for the other side of the world.

âOwen!â she cried, and turned back.

He stood mutely before her in the dimness.

âYou havenât told me how long youâre to be gone.â

âHow long? Oh, you see ... thatâs rather vague.... I hate definite dates, you
know...â

He paused and she saw he did not mean to help her out. She tried to say:
âYouâll be here for my wedding?â but could not bring the words to her
lips. Instead she murmured: âIn six weeks I shall be going too...â and he
rejoined, as if he had expected the announcement and prepared his answer:
âOh, by that time, very likely...â

âAt any rate, I wonât say good-bye,â she stammered, feeling the tears
beneath her veil.

âNo, no; rather not!â he declared; but he made no movement, and she went
up and threw her arms about him. âYouâll write me, wonât you?â

âOf course, of course——â

Her hands slipped down into his, and for a minute they held each other
dumbly in the darkness; then he gave a vague laugh and said: âItâs really
time to light up.â He pressed the electric button with one hand while with
the other he opened the door; and she passed out without daring to turn
back, lest the light on his face should show her what she feared to see.

XXXVIII

Anna drove to the chemistâs for Owenâs remedy. On the way she stopped her
cab at a book-shop, and emerged from it laden with literature. She knew
what would interest Owen, and what he was likely to have read, and she had
made her choice among the newest publications with the promptness of a
discriminating reader. But on the way back to the hotel she was overcome
by the irony of adding this mental panacea to the other. There was
something grotesque and almost mocking in the idea of offering a judicious
selection of literature to a man setting out on such a journey. âHe
knows ... he knows...â she kept on repeating; and giving the porter the
parcel from the chemistâs she drove away without leaving the books. She
went to her apartment, whither her maid had preceded her. There was a fire
in the drawing-room and the tea-table stood ready by the hearth. The
stormy rain beat against the uncurtained windows, and she thought of Owen,
who would soon be driving through it to the station, alone with his bitter
thoughts. She had been proud of the fact that he had always sought her
help in difficult hours; and now, in the most difficult of all, she was
the one being to whom he could not turn. Between them, henceforth, there
would always be the wall of an insurmountable silence.... She strained her
aching thoughts to guess how the truth had come to him. Had he seen the
girl, and had she told him? Instinctively, Anna rejected this conjecture.
But what need was there of assuming an explicit statement, when every
breath they had drawn for the last weeks had been charged with the
immanent secret? As she looked back over the days since Darrowâs first
arrival at Givre she perceived that at no time had any one deliberately
spoken, or anything been accidentally disclosed. The truth had come to
light by the force of its irresistible pressure; and the perception gave
her a startled sense of hidden powers, of a chaos of attractions and
repulsions far beneath the ordered surfaces of intercourse. She looked
back with melancholy derision on her old conception of life, as a kind of
well-lit and well policed suburb to dark places one need never know about.
Here they were, these dark places, in her own bosom, and henceforth she
would always have to traverse them to reach the beings she loved best!

She was still sitting beside the untouched tea-table when she heard
Darrowâs voice in the hall. She started up, saying to herself: âI must
tell him that Owen knows...â but when the door opened and she saw his
face, still lit by the same smile of boyish triumph, she felt anew the
uselessness of speaking.... Had he ever supposed that Owen would not know?
Probably, from the height of his greater experience, he had seen long
since that all that happened was inevitable; and the thought of it, at any
rate, was clearly not weighing on him now.

He was already dressed for the evening, and as he came toward her he said:
âThe Ambassadorâs booked for an official dinner and Iâm free after all.
Where shall we dine?â

Anna had pictured herself sitting alone all the evening with her wretched
thoughts, and the fact of having to put them out of her mind for the next
few hours gave her an immediate sensation of relief. Already her pulses
were dancing to the tune of Darrowâs, and as they smiled at each other she
thought: âNothing can ever change the fact that I belong to him.â

âWhere shall we dine?â he repeated gaily, and she named a well-known
restaurant for which she had once heard him express a preference. But as
she did so she fancied she saw a shadow on his face, and instantly she
said to herself: âIt was
there
he went with her!â

âOh, no, not there, after all!â she interrupted herself; and now she was
sure his colour deepened.

âWhere shall it be, then?â

She noticed that he did not ask the reason of her change, and this
convinced her that she had guessed the truth, and that he knew she had
guessed it. âHe will always know what I am thinking, and he will never
dare to ask me,â she thought; and she saw between them the same
insurmountable wall of silence as between herself and Owen, a wall of
glass through which they could watch each otherâs faintest motions but
which no sound could ever traverse...

They drove to a restaurant on the Boulevard, and there, in their intimate
corner of the serried scene, the sense of what was unspoken between them
gradually ceased to oppress her. He looked so light-hearted and handsome,
so ingenuously proud of her, so openly happy at being with her, that no
other fact could seem real in his presence. He had learned that the
Ambassador was to spend two days in Paris, and he had reason to hope that
in consequence his own departure for London would be deferred. He was
exhilarated by the prospect of being with Anna for a few hours longer, and
she did not ask herself if his exhilaration were a sign of insensibility,
for she was too conscious of his power of swaying her moods not to be
secretly proud of affecting his.

They lingered for some time over the fruit and coffee, and when they rose
to go Darrow suggested that, if she felt disposed for the play, they were
not too late for the second part of the programme at one of the smaller
theatres.

His mention of the hour recalled Owen to her thoughts. She saw his train
rushing southward through the storm, and, in a corner of the swaying
compartment, his face, white and indistinct as it had loomed on her in the
rainy twilight. It was horrible to be thus perpetually paying for her
happiness!

Darrow had called for a theatrical journal, and he presently looked up
from it to say: âI hear the second play at the AthÃ©nÃ©e is amusing.â

It was on Annaâs lips to acquiesce; but as she was about to speak she
wondered if it were not at the AthÃ©nÃ©e that Owen had seen Darrow with
Sophy Viner. She was not sure he had even mentioned the theatre, but the
mere possibility was enough to darken her sky. It was hateful to her to
think of accompanying Darrow to places where the girl had been with him.
She tried to reason away this scruple, she even reminded herself with a
bitter irony that whenever she was in Darrowâs arms she was where the girl
had been before her—but she could not shake off her superstitious
dread of being with him in any of the scenes of the Parisian episode. She
replied that she was too tired for the play, and they drove back to her
apartment. At the foot of the stairs she half-turned to wish him good
night, but he appeared not to notice her gesture and followed her up to
her door.

âThis is ever so much better than the theatre,â he said as they entered
the drawing-room.

She had crossed the room and was bending over the hearth to light the
fire. She knew he was approaching her, and that in a moment he would have
drawn the cloak from her shoulders and laid his lips on her neck, just
below the gathered-up hair. These privileges were his and, however
deferently and tenderly he claimed them, the joyous ease of his manner
marked a difference and proclaimed a right.

âAfter the theatre they came home like this,â she thought; and at the same
instant she felt his hands on her shoulders and shrank back.

âDonât—oh, donât!â she cried, drawing her cloak about her. She saw
from his astonished stare that her face must be quivering with pain.

âAnna! What on earth is the matter?â

âOwen knows!â she broke out, with a confused desire to justify herself.

Darrowâs countenance changed. âDid he tell you so? What did he say?â

âNothing! I knew it from the things he didnât say.â

âYou had a talk with him this afternoon?â

âYes: for a few minutes. I could see he didnât want me to stay.â

She had dropped into a chair, and sat there huddled, still holding her
cloak about her shoulders.

Darrow did not dispute her assumption, and she noticed that he expressed
no surprise. He sat down at a little distance from her, turning about in
his fingers the cigar-case he had drawn out as they came in. At length he
said: âHad he seen Miss Viner?â

She shrank from the sound of the name. âNo.... I donât think so.... Iâm sure
he hadnât...â

They remained silent, looking away from one another. Finally Darrow stood
up and took a few steps across the room. He came back and paused before
her, his eyes on her face.

âI think you ought to tell me what you mean to do.â She raised her head
and gave him back his look. âNothing I do can help Owen!â

âNo; but things canât go on like this.â He paused, as if to measure his
words. âI fill you with aversion,â he exclaimed.

She started up, half-sobbing. âNo—oh, no!â

âPoor child—you canât see your face!â

She lifted her hands as if to hide it, and turning away from him bowed her
head upon the mantel-shelf. She felt that he was standing a little way
behind her, but he made no attempt to touch her or come nearer.

âI know youâve felt as Iâve felt,â he said in a low voice—âthat we
belong to each other and that nothing can alter that. But other thoughts
come, and you canât banish them. Whenever you see me you remember ... you
associate me with things you abhor.... Youâve been generous—immeasurably.
Youâve given me all the chances a woman could; but if itâs only made you
suffer, whatâs the use?â

She turned to him with a tear-stained face. âIt hasnât only done that.â

âOh, no! I know.... Thereâve been moments...â He took her hand and raised it
to his lips. âTheyâll be with me as long as I live. But I canât see you
paying such a price for them. Iâm not worth what Iâm costing you.â

She continued to gaze at him through tear-dilated eyes; and suddenly she
flung out the question: âWasnât it the AthÃ©nÃ©e you took her to that
evening?â

âAnna—Anna!â

âYes; I want to know now: to know everything. Perhaps that will make me
forget. I ought to have made you tell me before. Wherever we go, I imagine
youâve been there with her.... I see you together. I want to know how it
began, where you went, why you left her.... I canât go on in this darkness
any longer!â

She did not know what had prompted her passionate outburst, but already
she felt lighter, freer, as if at last the evil spell were broken. âI want
to know everything,â she repeated. âItâs the only way to make me forget.â

After she had ceased speaking Darrow remained where he was, his arms
folded, his eyes lowered, immovable. She waited, her gaze on his face.

âArenât you going to tell me?â

âNo.â The blood rushed to her temples. âYou wonât? Why not?â

âIf I did, do you suppose youâd forget
that
?â

âOh—â she moaned, and turned away from him.

âYou see itâs impossible,â he went on. âIâve done a thing I loathe, and to
atone for it you ask me to do another. What sort of satisfaction would
that give you? It would put something irremediable between us.â

She leaned her elbow against the mantel-shelf and hid her face in her
hands. She had the sense that she was vainly throwing away her last hope
of happiness, yet she could do nothing, think of nothing, to save it. The
conjecture flashed through her: âShould I be at peace if I gave him up?â
and she remembered the desolation of the days after she had sent him away,
and understood that that hope was vain. The tears welled through her lids
and ran slowly down between her fingers.

âGood-bye,â she heard him say, and his footsteps turned to the door.

She tried to raise her head, but the weight of her despair bowed it down.
She said to herself: âThis is the end ... he wonât try to appeal to me
again...â and she remained in a sort of tranced rigidity, perceiving
without feeling the fateful lapse of the seconds. Then the cords that
bound her seemed to snap, and she lifted her head and saw him going.

âWhy, heâs mine—heâs mine! Heâs no one elseâs!â His face was turned
to her and the look in his eyes swept away all her terrors. She no longer
understood what had prompted her senseless outcry; and the mortal
sweetness of loving him became again the one real fact in the world.

XXXIX

Anna, the next day, woke to a humiliated memory of the previous evening.

Darrow had been right in saying that their sacrifice would benefit no one;
yet she seemed dimly to discern that there were obligations not to be
tested by that standard. She owed it, at any rate, as much to his pride as
to hers to abstain from the repetition of such scenes; and she had learned
that it was beyond her power to do so while they were together. Yet when
he had given her the chance to free herself, everything had vanished from
her mind but the blind fear of losing him; and she saw that he and she
were as profoundly and inextricably bound together as two trees with
interwoven roots. For a long time she brooded on her plight, vaguely
conscious that the only escape from it must come from some external
chance. And slowly the occasion shaped itself in her mind. It was Sophy
Viner only who could save her—Sophy Viner only who could give her
back her lost serenity. She would seek the girl out and tell her that she
had given Darrow up; and that step once taken there would be no retracing
it, and she would perforce have to go forward alone.

Any pretext for action was a kind of anodyne, and she despatched her maid
to the Farlowsâ with a note asking if Miss Viner would receive her. There
was a long delay before the maid returned, and when at last she appeared
it was with a slip of paper on which an address was written, and a verbal
message to the effect that Miss Viner had left some days previously, and
was staying with her sister in a hotel near the Place de lâEtoile. The
maid added that Mrs. Farlow, on the plea that Miss Vinerâs plans were
uncertain, had at first made some difficulty about giving this
information; and Anna guessed that the girl had left her friendsâ roof,
and instructed them to withhold her address, with the object of avoiding
Owen. âSheâs kept faith with herself and I havenât,â Anna mused; and the
thought was a fresh incentive to action.

Darrow had announced his intention of coming soon after luncheon, and the
morning was already so far advanced that Anna, still mistrustful of her
strength, decided to drive immediately to the address Mrs. Farlow had
given. On the way there she tried to recall what she had heard of Sophy
Vinerâs sister, but beyond the girlâs enthusiastic report of the absent
Lauraâs loveliness she could remember only certain vague allusions of Mrs.
Farlowâs to her artistic endowments and matrimonial vicissitudes. Darrow
had mentioned her but once, and in the briefest terms, as having
apparently very little concern for Sophyâs welfare, and being, at any
rate, too geographically remote to give her any practical support; and
Anna wondered what chance had brought her to her sisterâs side at this
conjunction. Mrs. Farlow had spoken of her as a celebrity (in what line
Anna failed to recall); but Mrs. Farlowâs celebrities were legion, and the
name on the slip of paper—Mrs. McTarvie-Birch—did not seem to
have any definite association with fame.

While Anna waited in the dingy vestibule of the Hotel Chicago she had so
distinct a vision of what she meant to say to Sophy Viner that the girl
seemed already to be before her; and her heart dropped from all the height
of its courage when the porter, after a long delay, returned with the
announcement that Miss Viner was no longer in the hotel. Anna, doubtful if
she understood, asked if he merely meant that the young lady was out at
the moment; but he replied that she had gone away the day before. Beyond
this he had no information to impart, and after a momentâs hesitation Anna
sent him back to enquire if Mrs. McTarvie-Birch would receive her. She
reflected that Sophy had probably pledged her sister to the same secrecy
as Mrs. Farlow, and that a personal appeal to Mrs. Birch might lead to
less negative results.

There was another long interval of suspense before the porter reappeared
with an affirmative answer; and a third while an exiguous and hesitating
lift bore her up past a succession of shabby landings.

When the last was reached, and her guide had directed her down a winding
passage that smelt of sea-going luggage, she found herself before a door
through which a strong odour of tobacco reached her simultaneously with
the sounds of a suppressed altercation. Her knock was followed by a
silence, and after a minute or two the door was opened by a handsome young
man whose ruffled hair and general air of creased disorder led her to
conclude that he had just risen from a long-limbed sprawl on a sofa strewn
with tumbled cushions. This sofa, and a grand piano bearing a basket of
faded roses, a biscuit-tin and a devastated breakfast tray, almost filled
the narrow sitting-room, in the remaining corner of which another man,
short, swarthy and humble, sat examining the lining of his hat.

Anna paused in doubt; but on her naming Mrs. Birch the young man politely
invited her to enter, at the same time casting an impatient glance at the
mute spectator in the background.

The latter, raising his eyes, which were round and bulging, fixed them,
not on the young man but on Anna, whom, for a moment, he scrutinized as
searchingly as the interior of his hat. Under his gaze she had the sense
of being minutely catalogued and valued; and the impression, when he
finally rose and moved toward the door, of having been accepted as a
better guarantee than he had had any reason to hope for. On the threshold
his glance crossed that of the young man in an exchange of intelligence as
full as it was rapid; and this brief scene left Anna so oddly enlightened
that she felt no surprise when her companion, pushing an arm-chair
forward, sociably asked her if she wouldnât have a cigarette. Her polite
refusal provoked the remark that he would, if sheâd no objection; and
while he groped for matches in his loose pockets, and behind the
photographs and letters crowding the narrow mantel-shelf, she ventured
another enquiry for Mrs. Birch.

âJust a minute,â he smiled; âI think the masseurâs with her.â He spoke in
a smooth denationalized English, which, like the look in his long-lashed
eyes and the promptness of his charming smile, suggested a long training
in all the arts of expediency. Having finally discovered a match-box on
the floor beside the sofa, he lit his cigarette and dropped back among the
cushions; and on Annaâs remarking that she was sorry to disturb Mrs. Birch
he replied that that was all right, and that she always kept everybody
waiting.

After this, through the haze of his perpetually renewed cigarettes, they
continued to chat for some time of indifferent topics; but when at last
Anna again suggested the possibility of her seeing Mrs. Birch he rose from
his corner with a slight shrug, and murmuring: âSheâs perfectly hopeless,â
lounged off through an inner door.

Anna was still wondering when and in what conjunction of circumstances the
much-married Laura had acquired a partner so conspicuous for his personal
charms, when the young man returned to announce: âShe says itâs all right,
if you donât mind seeing her in bed.â

He drew aside to let Anna pass, and she found herself in a dim untidy
scented room, with a pink curtain pinned across its single window, and a
lady with a great deal of fair hair and uncovered neck smiling at her from
a pink bed on which an immense powder-puff trailed.

âYou donât mind, do you? He costs such a frightful lot that I canât afford
to send him off,â Mrs. Birch explained, extending a thickly-ringed hand to
Anna, and leaving her in doubt as to whether the person alluded to were
her masseur or her husband. Before a reply was possible there was a
convulsive stir beneath the pink expanse, and something that resembled
another powder-puff hurled itself at Anna with a volley of sounds like the
popping of Lilliputian champagne corks. Mrs. Birch, flinging herself
forward, gasped out: âIf youâd just give him a caramel ... there, in that
box on the dressing-table ... itâs the only earthly thing to stop him...â
and when Anna had proffered this sop to her assailant, and he had
withdrawn with it beneath the bedspread, his mistress sank back with a
laugh.

âIsnât he a beauty? The Prince gave him to me down at Nice the other day—but
heâs perfectly awful,â she confessed, beaming intimately on her visitor.
In the roseate penumbra of the bed-curtains she presented to Annaâs
startled gaze an odd chromo-like resemblance to Sophy Viner, or a
suggestion, rather, of what Sophy Viner might, with the years and in spite
of the powder-puff, become. Larger, blonder, heavier-featured, she yet had
glances and movements that disturbingly suggested what was freshest and
most engaging in the girl; and as she stretched her bare plump arm across
the bed she seemed to be pulling back the veil from dingy distances of
family history.

âDo sit down, if thereâs a place to sit on,â she cordially advised;
adding, as Anna took the edge of a chair hung with miscellaneous raiment:
âMy singing takes so much time that I donât get a chance to walk the fat
off—thatâs the worst of being an artist.â

Anna murmured an assent. âI hope it hasnât inconvenienced you to see me; I
told Mr. Birch—â

âMr.
who
?â the recumbent beauty asked; and then: âOh,
Jimmy
!â she faintly
laughed, as if more for her own enlightenment than Annaâs.

The latter continued eagerly: âI understand from Mrs. Farlow that your
sister was with you, and I ventured to come up because I wanted to ask you
when I should have a chance of finding her.â

Mrs. McTarvie-Birch threw back her head with a long stare. âDo you mean to
say the idiot at the door didnât tell you? Sophy went away last night.â

âLast night?â Anna echoed. A sudden terror had possessed her. Could it be
that the girl had tricked them all and gone with Owen? The idea was
incredible, yet it took such hold of her that she could hardly steady her
lips to say: âThe porter did tell me, but I thought perhaps he was
mistaken. Mrs. Farlow seemed to think that I should find her here.â

âIt was all so sudden that I donât suppose she had time to let the Farlows
know. She didnât get Mrs. Murrettâs wire till yesterday, and she just
pitched her things into a trunk and rushed——â

âMrs. Murrett?â

âWhy, yes. Sophyâs gone to India with Mrs. Murrett; theyâre to meet at
Brindisi,â Sophyâs sister said with a calm smile.

Anna sat motionless, gazing at the disordered room, the pink bed, the
trivial face among the pillows.

Mrs. McTarvie-Birch pursued: âThey had a fearful kick-up last spring—I
daresay you knew about it—but I told Sophy sheâd better lump it, as
long as the old woman was willing to.... As an artist, of course, itâs
perfectly impossible for me to have her with me...â

âOf course,â Anna mechanically assented.

Through the confused pain of her thoughts she was hardly aware that Mrs.
Birchâs explanations were still continuing. âNaturally I didnât altogether
approve of her going back to that beast of a woman. I said all I could.... I
told her she was a fool to chuck up such a place as yours. But Sophyâs
restless—always was—and sheâs taken it into her head sheâd
rather travel...â

Anna rose from her seat, groping for some formula of leave-taking. The
pushing back of her chair roused the white dogâs smouldering animosity,
and he drowned his mistressâs further confidences in another outburst of
hysterics. Through the tumult Anna signed an inaudible farewell, and Mrs.
Birch, having momentarily succeeded in suppressing her pet under a pillow,
called out: âDo come again! Iâd love to sing to you.â

Anna murmured a word of thanks and turned to the door. As she opened it
she heard her hostess crying after her: âJimmy! Do you hear me? Jimmy

Brance
!â and then, there being no response from the person summoned: â
Do

tell him he must go and call the lift for you!â

âDefects,â such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmâs
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

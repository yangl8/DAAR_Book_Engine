THE CHARMER OF SNAKES

I

The
petulant whining of the jackals prevented
Renfrew from sleeping. At first he lay still on his
camp bed, staring at the orifice of the bell tent,
which was only partially covered by the canvas flap
let down by Mohammed, after he had bidden his
master good-night. Behind the tent the fettered
mules stamped on the rough, dry ground, and now
and then the heavy rustling of a wild boar could
be heard, as it shuffled through the scrub towards
the water that lay in the hollow beyond the camp.
The wayward songs of the Moorish attendants had
died into silence. They slept, huddled together
and shrouded in their djelabes. But their wailing
rapture of those old triumphant days when on
the heights above Granada, beneath the eternal
snows, their brethren walked as conquerors, had
been succeeded by the cries of the uneasy beasts
that throng the mountains between Tangier and
Tetuan. And Renfrew said to himself that the
jackals kept him from sleeping. He lay still and
[4]

wondered if Claire were awake in her tent close
by. If so, if her dark eyes were unclouded, what
journeys must her imagination be making! She
was so sensitive to sound of any kind. A cry
moved her sometimes with a swift violence that
alarmed those around her. The message of a
note of music shut one door on her soul, opened
another, and let her in to strange regions in which
she chose to be lonely.

How amazing it was to think that Claire, with
all her serpentine beauty, all her celebrity, all the
legends that clung to her fame, all the wild caprices
of which two worlds had talked for years,—that
Claire was hidden away three feet off, beneath the
canvas shield that looked like a moderate-sized
mushroom from the Kasbar on the hill. How
amazing to think she was no longer Claire Duvigne,
but Claire Renfrew. Her cheated audiences sighed
in London in which a week ago she was acting.
And while they sighed, she slept in this wild
valley of Morocco, or lay awake and heard the
jackals whining among the dwarf palms. And she
was his. She belonged to him. He had the right
to hold her—this thin, pale wonder of night and of
fame—in his arms, and to kiss the lips from which
came at will the coo of a dove or the snarl of a
tigress. Although Renfrew could not sleep, he fell
into a dream. Indeed, ever since he had married
Claire, a week ago, his life had been a dream.
When the goddess suddenly bends down to the
[5]

worshipper, and says: âDon't pray to me any
more—sit on my throne by my side!â—the
worshipper exchanges one form of devotion for
another, so deep and so different that for a while
his ordinary faculties seem frozen, his life goes in
shadowy places. Renfrew was not a man of deep
imagination, but he had enough of the dangerous
and dear quality to make him full of interest in
Claire's bonfires of the mind. He sunned himself
in the sparks which flew from her, even as
the phlegmatic man in the pit bathes in the fury
of some queen of the stage. He adored partly
because he scarcely understood.

And then, at this moment, he was in the throes
of a most unexpected honeymoon. Claire, after
refusing to have anything to do with him for two
years or more, had suddenly married him in such a
hurry that, though London gasped, Renfrew gasped
still more. She had sent for him one night, from
her dressing-room, between the third act and the
fourth of an angry drama of passion. He came
in and found her sitting in an arm-chair by a
table, on which lay a note containing his last proposal,
and a dagger with which she was about to
commit a stage murder that had carried her glory
to the four quarters of the universe. Her face
was covered with powder, and in her long white
dress she looked like a phantom. As she spoke
to him, she ran her thin fingers mechanically up
and down the blade of the dagger. When Renfrew
[6]

was in the room, and the door shut, she looked
up at him and said:—

âDesmond, I'm going to frighten you more
than I shall frighten the audience out there.â

And she pointed towards the hidden stage.

âHow?â he said, looking at her hand and at
the dagger.

âI'm going to marry you.â

Renfrew turned paler than she was.

âAh!â she cried. âYou go white?â

âNo, no,â he murmured. âBut—but I can't
believe it.â

âI will marry you when you like, to-morrow,
whenever you can get a licence.â

âOh, Claire!â

Suddenly she got up.

âTake me away from here,â she said. âFrom
this heat and noise. Take me to some place where
it is wild and desolate. I want to be in starlight,
with people who know nothing of me, and my
trumpery talent. O God, Desmond, you don't
know how a woman can get to hate being
famous! I should like to act to-night to a circle
of savages who had never heard of me and of my
glory.â

âCurtain's up!â sang a shrill voice outside.

Claire picked up the dagger.

âWell?â she said. âShall it be—?â

âAh, yes—yes!â Renfrew answered in a
choked voice.

[7]

She smiled and glided out, like a white snake, he
thought.

And now—yes, those were really jackals whining,
and Claire slept, surrounded by a circle of
Moors under the stars of Morocco.

Renfrew trembled at the astounding surprises of
life. Now the devil of the night—thought—had
filled his veins with fever. He got up softly, drew
on his clothes, unfastened the canvas flap, and
emerged, like a shadow, from the mouth of the
tent. The night was dewy and cool. All the
heaven was full of eyes. The line of tethered
mules looked like a black hedge in whose shelter
the group of tents was pitched. A low fire, held in
a cup of earth, was dying down in the distance, and
as Renfrew came out a lanky dog slunk off among
the bushes that clothed the low hills on every side.

Renfrew stood quite still. He was bare-headed,
and the breeze caught at his thick brown hair, and
seemed to tug it like a rough child at play with a
kindly elder. His eyes were turned towards the
tiny peaked tent which shrouded Claire. A small
moon half way up the sky sent out a beam which
faintly illuminated this home of a wanderer, and
Renfrew thought the beam was like a silver finger
pointing at this wonderful creature whom glory had
so long attended. Such beings must walk in light.
Nature herself protests against their endeavours to
shroud themselves even for a moment in darkness.
He drew close to the tent, and listened for Claire's
[8]

low breathing. But he could not hear it. Perhaps
she was awake then.

âClaire!â he called, in a low voice.

There was no answer. Renfrew hesitated and
glanced round the little camp. It was just then
that he noticed the absence of two figures which
had been standing like statues near his tent when he
went to bed. These were soldiers sent from the
nearest village to guard the camp from marauders
during the night. Clad in earth-coloured rags,
shrouded in loose robes that looked like musty
dressing-gowns, with fez on head, and musket in
hand, they had seemed devoutly intent on doing
their duty then. But now—where were they?
Renfrew strolled among the tents, expecting to
find them squatting near the fire smoking cigarettes,
or playing some Spanish game of cards. But
they had vanished. He returned, and posted himself
again by the door of Claire's rude bed-room,
saying to himself that he would be her guard.
Those Moorish vagabonds had deserted her. They
cared nothing for the safety of this jewel, whom
the whole civilised world cherished. But in his
heart glowed a passion of protection for her. And
then he gazed again at the impenetrable canvas
wall that divided him from her. Only two hours
ago he had held her in his arms and kissed her lips,
yet already he felt as if a river of years flowed
between them. He began to torture himself deliberately,
as lovers will, by the imagination of non-
[9]
existent
evils. Suppose Claire possessed the power
of a fairy, and could evaporate at will into the
spaces of the air, leaving no trace behind. She
might then have departed, have faded into the
scented silence and darkness of this land so strange
and desolate. Renfrew supposed the departure an
actual fact. What a loneliness would fill his night
then; if that little tent stood empty, if that slim
sleeper were removed from the camp round which
the jackals sat on their tiny haunches, whining like
peevish spirits. He trembled beneath the weight
of this absurd supposition, revelling in the intolerable
with the folly of worship. Gradually he forced
himself on step by step along the fanciful path till
he had assured his imagination that Claire was
really gone, and that he was just such a travelling
Englishman as may come alone across the Straits,
take out a camp, and spend his days in stalking
wild boar, or shooting duck, his nights in the heavy
slumber of complete weariness. And, at length,
having gained a ghastly summit of imaginative
despair, he suddenly stretched forth his hand, unhooked
the canvas that shrouded Claire's tent door,
and peeped cautiously in, courting the delicious
revulsion of feeling which he would secure when
he saw her half defined form in the shadow of the
leaning roof that hid her from the stars.

He bent forward with greedy anxiety. But the
pale and tragic face he looked for, did not greet his
eyes. The tent was empty.

[10]

Renfrew stood for a moment holding back the
canvas flap with one hand. This denial calmly
offered to his expectation bewildered him. He
was confused, and for a moment scarcely thought
at all. Then his mind broke away with the
violence of a dog unleashed, and ran a wild course
of surmises. He thought first of rousing the
camp and organising an immediate search. Then
he remembered the absence of the two soldiers
who ought to be guarding the tents and the
mules. Claire gone, those soldiers absent! He
linked the two facts together, and turned white
and sick. But he did not rouse the camp. Indeed,
he thanked God that all the men were sleeping.
He sprang softly back from the tent, turned
on his heel, and stole out of the camp so silently
that he scarcely seemed a living thing. The
ground towards the water was boggy and spongy,
and the scent of the thickly growing myrtles was
heavy in the air. Renfrew brushed through them
swiftly. He heard the harsh snuffling of a boar,
and the tread of its feet in the mud at the water-side.
And these sounds filled the night with a
sense of unknown dangers. Darkness, a wild
country, wild men, wild beasts, and his beautiful
Claire out somewhere alone, near him, perhaps,
yet hidden behind the impenetrable veil of darkness.
He saw her fainting, struggling, crying out
for him. He saw her silent and dead, and
frenzy seized him. She was not here by the
[11]

water. And with a gesture of despair he turned
back. Low and rounded hills faced him on all
sides, covered with a dense undergrowth of palms
and close-growing shrubs that looked almost like
black velvet in the night. On one, the highest,
was perched the native village from which the
soldiers had come. Dogs were barking in it incessantly.
It seemed to Renfrew that Claire
might have been conveyed there by these ruffians;
and he began hastily to ascend in the direction of
the dogs' acute voices. He stumbled among the
palms at first; but, mounting higher, he came into
the eye of the moon, and was swallowed up in a
shrouded silver radiance. The camp faded away
below him, and he felt the breeze with greater
force. Yet its breath was warm. Could Claire
feel it? Did she see the moon? Now the dogs
were evidently close by. The village must be
behind that big clump of trees. Renfrew sprang
upward, passed through them, suddenly drew a
great breath and stood still.

Beyond the trees there was a small clearing that
almost corresponded to our English notion of a village
green. On the near side of it was the clump
of trees in whose shadow Renfrew now stood.
On the far side of it was the Moorish village, a
minute collection of low huts like hovels, featureless
and filthy. The moon streamed over the clearing
and lit up faintly a cluster of seated figures that
formed a good-sized circle. The figures looked
[12]

broad and almost shapeless, for they were all
smothered in long, voluminous robes, and over all
the heads great hoods were drawn which hid the
faces of the wearers. They were absolutely
motionless, and differed little from the more distant
clumps of dwarf palms that grew everywhere
among the huts. Only they possessed the curiously
sullen aspect of things alive but entirely
motionless. It was not this living Stonehenge of
Morocco, however, which caused Renfrew to catch
his breath and rooted him in the shadow. In the
centre of the circle, lit up by the moon, there
stood something that might have been a phantom,
it was so thin, so tall, so white-faced, so strange
in its movements. It was a woman, and long
black hair flowed down to its waist,—night standing
back from that moon, vague and spectral, the
face. In this human night and moon, great
sombre eyes gleamed with a sort of fatigued
beauty. This spectre stretched out its long arms
in weird gesticulations and sometimes swayed its
body as if it moved to music. And from its lips
came a soft and liquid stream of golden words
that mingled with the acid barking of the dogs,
some of which crept furtively about on the outskirts
of the serene hooded circle of the listeners.
This murmuring spectre was Claire. She was
girt about with silently staring Moors. And she
was in the act of delivering one of her most
famous recitations, which she had last given at
[13]

a monster morning performance before Royalties
in London, on a sultry day of the season. As
this fact broke upon Renfrew's mind, he seemed
for a moment to be back in the hot dressing-room
in which Claire had said: âI will marry
you.â He seemed to hear her passionate
exclamation: âI should like to act to-night to
a circle of savages!â The hill men of this part
of Morocco may not be savages, but they are
fierce and wild and ruthless. And now they hung
upon the lips that had spoken to London, Paris,
Vienna, New York—but never before to such
an audience as this. The recitation was a description
of the performance of a snake-charmer,
his harangue to his reptiles and to the crowd
watching him, and his departure into the solitude
of the great desert, there to obtain, in communion
with its spirit, the power to work greater miracles,
and to charm not alone the serpents that dwell
among the rocks and in the forests, but also men,
women, little children,—the power to thrust a
human world into a kennel of plaited straw, to
take it out in sections at pleasure, and to make it
dance, pose, and posture, like a viper tamed into a
species of ballet-dancer. In this recitation the
peculiar and almost serpentine fascination of Claire
had full liberty. She represented the snake-charmer
as a being who through long and intimate association
with snakes had become like them, lithe,
fantastic, and unexpected, soft and deadly, by
[14]

turns sleepy and violent, a coil of glistening
velvet and a length of cast-iron, tipped with a
poisoned fang and the music of a hiss. His
fanaticism, his greed for money, the passionate
prayer to Sidi Mahomet that flowed from his lips
while his terrible eyes searched an imaginary
crowd in search of the richest man or the most
excited woman in it, his bursts of dancing humour,
his deadly stillness, his playful familiarity with his
dangerous captives, his mesmeric anger when they
were sullen and recalcitrant, his relapse into the
savage churchwarden with the collecting box when
his âshowâ was at an end,—every side, every
subtlety of such a creature Claire could give with
the certainty of genius. As you watched her, you
beheld the snakes, you beheld their master. Even
at the end you almost saw the vast and trackless
desert open its haggard arms to receive its child,
who passed from the crowd to the silence in which
alone he could learn to fascinate the crowd. At
the great morning performance in London, a prince
who knew the East had said to Claire, âMiss
Duvigne, you must have lived with snake-charmers.
You must have studied them for months.â

âI never saw one in my life,â she answered
truthfully.

And now she gave her performance to those
who, in the dingy market squares of their white-walled
cities, had seen the snakes dance and had
heard the prayer to Sidi Mahomet. And they
[15]

squatted in the moonbeams, immobile as goblins
carved in dusky oak. Yet they inspired Claire.
From his hiding place Renfrew could note this.
She had let her genius loose upon them, as she had
let her cloud of hair loose upon her shoulders.
The frosty touch of smart conventionality bewilders
and half paralyses the utterly unconventional.
Often Renfrew had heard Claire curse the
smiling and self-contented Londoners who thronged
the stalls of her theatre. She felt, with the swiftness
of genius, the retarding hand they laid upon
her winged talents. She had no inclination to
curse these hooded figures gathered round her in
the night, staring upon her with the fixed concentration
of children who behold, rather than hear,
a fairy tale, they paid her the fine compliment of
an undivided attention. It was a curious scene and
one that stirred in Renfrew a deep excitement.
He watched it with a double sense, of living keenly
and of dreaming deeply. Claire gave to him the
first sense, the moon and the motionless Moors the
second. But presently one of the hooded statues
stirred and swayed, and there mingled with the
voice of Claire a twisted melody, so thin and wandering
that it was like a thread binding a bundle of
gold. It pierced the night, and enclosed the words
of the reciter, one sound prisoned by another lighter
and less than itself. The dogs had ceased to bark
now, and only the voice that told of the snake-charmer's
journey into the desert, and this whisper
[16]
ing
Moorish tune, plucked by dark fingers from the
strings of a rough lute, moved in the night, till
Claire ceased. The lute continued for a few bars,
like the symphony that closes a song, and then it
too ceased abruptly on a note that brought no feeling
of finale to modern ears. For an instant
Claire stood motionless in the centre of the human
circle. Then her arms fell to her sides. She moved
swiftly towards the trees in whose shadow Renfrew
was watching. The Moors made a gap, and as she
passed out all the shapeless figures were suddenly
elongated and crowded together upon her footsteps.
As Claire came into the blackness of the trees,
Renfrew stretched out his hand and clasped her
arm. She stopped with no tremor, and faced him.

âClaire!â

âWhat, it is you, Desmond! I thought you
were asleep.â

âWhen you were awake? You have given me
a fright. I came to your tent; I found it empty.
The soldiers were gone.â

âThey were guarding me up the hill. I could
not sleep. I wandered out. How hot your hand
is!â

Renfrew released her. All the Moors had
gathered round them like enormous shadows.

âMy audience has come to the stage door!â
Claire said.

Her eyes were gleaming with excitement.

âThey are a beautiful audience,â she added;
[17]

âand the orchestra, the soft music—that was
better than London fiddles.â

âCome back to the camp, Claire.â

âVery well.â

He drew her arm through his, and led her out
into the moonlight and down the hill. Two
shadows detached themselves from the silent assembly
and followed them, barefooted, over the
dewy grass. They were the soldiers. Claire
looked back and saw them.

âI shall give those men a handful of pesetas,
to-morrow,â she said.

They reached the camp and sat down on two
folding chairs in the shadow of Claire's tent. The
soldiers stood near, gazing intently at them. Claire
sat in a curved attitude. She had drawn a dark
veil over her hair, and her enormous and tragic
eyes were turned sombrely on Renfrew. She looked
fatigued, as she often did after acting a long and
passionate part. To Renfrew she seemed more
wonderful than ever. He could scarcely believe
that he was her husband.

âYou have had your circle of savages,â he said.

âYes.â

âAnd you liked them?â

âDo you think they liked me? I wonder if
there was a snake-charmer among them. When
I came to Sidi Mahomet I thought perhaps they
would kill me. That thought made me pray better
than I can in London.â

[18]

âYou could charm snakes more certainly than
any Arab,â Renfrew said.

âI daresay. Perhaps I shall try at Tetuan.
Good-night, Desmond.â

She vanished into the tent. It seemed that she
evaporated as Sarah Bernhardt evaporates in the
fourth act of âLa Tosca.â

II

On the following day they rode across the mountain
to Tetuan. They started in the dawn.
Claire's eyes were heavy. She came languidly out
from the tent door to mount her horse, and when
she touched Renfrew he felt that her hand was cold
like an icicle. He looked at her anxiously.

âAre you ill?â he asked.

âNo, Desmond.â

He lifted her into the saddle.

âYou haven't slept,â he said.

She looked down at him as she slowly gathered
up her reins.

âUnfortunately, I have,â she replied.

Before Renfrew had time to express surprise at
this unexpected rejoinder, she had struck her horse
with the whip, and trotted off over the grass in the
direction of the white Kasbar that gleamed on the
hill under the kiss of the rising sun. He leaped
into the saddle, and followed her. The path into
[19]

which they came was narrow, winding through
wild fig-trees and olives, and constantly ascending.
Claire did not turn her head, and Renfrew could
not ride by her side. He watched her thin and
sinuous figure swaying slightly in obedience to the
motion of her horse, which scrambled over the
rough path with the activity of a wild cat. In
front of her their personal attendant, Mohammed,
rode on a huge grey mule, and sang to himself
incessantly in a deep and murmuring voice. Once
or twice Renfrew spoke to Claire, but she did not
seem to hear him. He resolved to ask about her
sleep when they gained some plateau on which
they could rest for a moment. At present it was
necessary to concentrate his attention on his horse
and on the dangers of the road.

When the sun was high in the heavens, and they
were high on the mountain, above a gorge in which
the scrub grew densely, and great bushes starred
with yellow and white flowers hid the rocks and
made a home for birds, Mohammed called a halt.
Renfrew lifted Claire to the ground. The men
passed on towards Tetuan with their camp, and
Claire sank down on a gay rug beneath the shade
of a huge white umbrella, which was pitched on a
square of level ground and circled with luxuriant
vegetation. Renfrew lay at her feet and lit his
pipe, while Mohammed, the dragoman, and one of
the porters squatted at a little distance, and began
to play cards in a cloud of keef. Claire was fan
[20]
ning
herself slowly with an enormous Spanish fan
in which all gay colours met. She still looked
very tired. The shuffle of the descending mules
died away down the mountain, and a silence,
through which the butterflies flitted, fell round them.

âIs this journey too much for you, Claire?â
Renfrew asked.

âNo. I can rehearse for six hours in London,
surely I can ride for six here.â

âBut you look tired.â

âBecause, as I told you, I slept too much last
night.â

âWhat does that mean?â

She stretched herself on the rug with the easy
grace of a woman who has trained her body to
carry to the eyes of others, as a message, all the
moods of passion and of peace. Then she leaned
her cheek on her hand.

âIn the darkness of the tent, Desmond, I slept
and did not know it. I believed that I lay awake.
I thought I still could hear the jackals, and the
stamping of the mules. But, really, I slept.â

âHow do you know that?â

âBecause of what I am going to tell you. The
wind blew about the canvas door, and when it
bulged outwards I could see on each side of it a
tiny section of the night outside, a bit of a bush,
blades of short grass moving, a ray of the moon,
the slinking shadow of one of the dogs from the
village.â

[21]

âYes.â

âPresently there came, I thought, a stronger
gust than usual. It tore the canvas flap from the
pegs, and the whole thing blew up, leaving the
entrance quite open. Then it blew down again.
It was only up for a minute. During that minute
I had seen that a very tall man was standing outside
the tent.â

âOne of the soldiers.â

âIf I had been awake it might have been.â

âYou mean that all this was a dream?â

âI mean that I slept last night, and that I wish I
hadn't.â

She turned her great eyes on Renfrew, holding
the red, green, and yellow fan so that it concealed
the lower part of her face. And he looked at her,
staring at him like some tragic stranger above the
rampart of an unknown city, and wondered whether
she was acting to him in the sun. On the forefinger
of the hand that held up the fan a huge black
pearl perched in a circle of gold. Renfrew had
often noticed it on the stage, when Claire lifted
the silver dagger to kill the man who loved her in
the play.

âThe door of your tent was securely closed
when I got up and came out this morning,â he
said.

âOh, yes.â

She spoke with the utmost indifference. Then
she added more sharply:—

[22]

âDesmond, has it ever occurred to you that I
am serpentine?â

He was startled and made no answer.

âWell—has it?â

âYes,â he said truthfully.

âWhy?â

âEvery one thinks so. You are so thin. You
move so silently. Your body is so elastic and controlled.
You always look as if you could glide
into places where other women could never go,
and be at home in attitudes they could never
assume.â

âBut I'm an actress—my body is trained, you
know, to lie, to fall, as I choose.â

âOther actresses don't give one the same impression.â

âNo,â she said thoughtfully. âMy peculiar
physique has a great deal to do with it.â

âOf course, and there's something more than
that, something mental.â

Claire's heavy eyes grew more thoughtful. The
white lids fluttered lower over them till they looked
like the eyes of one half asleep. She lay in silence,
plunged in a reverie that was deep and dark. In
this reverie she forgot to move her fan, which
dropped from her hand and fell softly upon the
rug. Renfrew did not interrupt her. His worship
had learned to wait upon her moods. A huge
dragon-fly passed on its journey towards the far
blue range of the Atlas Mountains. It whirred in
[23]

its haste, and its burnished body shone in the
sunshine between its gleaming wings. Claire
snatched at it with her hand, but missed it.

âI should like to wear it as a jewel,â she said.

Then she turned slowly again towards Renfrew,
and continued her nocturne as if it had never been
broken off.

âThe canvas flap fell down again over the
doorway, Desmond, and it seemed that just then
the breeze died away, expiring in that angry gust.
I could not see anything but the interior of the
tent, and only that very dimly. But this man
outside. I wanted to see him.â

âDid you recognise that he was not one of the
soldiers, then?â

âPerfectly. He was not dressed as they are.
They were entirely muffled up with hoods drawn
forward above their faces. And in their hands one
could see their guns. This man was bareheaded,
and looked half naked. And in his hands—â

She stopped meditatively.

âWas there anything in his hands?â

âWell—yes, there was.â

âWhat?â

âI wanted to know what it was. But at first I
only lay quite still and wished the wind would
come again and blow the flap up so that I could
see out. But it had quite gone down. The canvas
did not even quiver.â

âWas it near dawn?â

[24]

âI haven't an idea. Does the breeze sink
then?â

âVery often.â

âAh! Perhaps it was then. Oh, but you'll
see in a minute what nonsense it is to think about
that. I lay still, as I said, for some time, waiting
for the breeze. And when it wouldn't come, I
made up my mind that I must arrive at a decision
either to turn my face on the pillow and go to
sleep, or else to get up, go to the tent door, and
look out.â

âTo see this man?â

âExactly.â

âWhich did you do?â

âTurned my face on the pillow.â

âAnd went off to sleep?â

âNo, grew most intensely awake—as I supposed.
The pillow was like fire against my cheek.
It burnt me. With the departure of the breeze
the night had become suddenly most intolerably hot.
I turned over on my back and lay like that. Then
I felt as if there was sand on the sheets.â

âSand! Impossible! We aren't in the
desert.â

âNo. But it seemed as if I lay in hot sand. I
shifted my position, but it made no difference. I
sat up. The tent door was still closed. I listened.
All those dogs had ceased to bark. There wasn't
a sound. Even the jackals had left off whining.
Then I slipped out of bed and threw that rose-
[25]
coloured
Moorish cloak over me. It rustled just
like a thing rustles in grass, Desmond.â

She looked at him with a sort of peculiar significance,
and as if she expected him to gather something
definite from the remark.

âA thing in grass,â he repeated, wondering.
âWhat sort of thing?â

But Claire avoided the question. She had taken
up the fan again, and was opening and shutting it
with a quiet and careful sort of precision, as she
went on in a low and even voice:—

âI disliked this rustling, and held the cloak
tightly together with my hands. I felt as if the
man outside the tent had been waiting to hear that
very little noise.â

âThe rustling?â

âYes. And that when he heard it he smiled to
himself. I didn't intend he should hear it again
though, and as I glided towards the tent door, I
held the cloak very tight and away from my body.
And I don't think I can have made any noise.
You know how softly I can move when I choose?â

âYes.â

âWhen I got to the door, I waited. I couldn't
hear the man; but I felt that he was still there, just
on the other side of the flap.â

Renfrew leaned forward on the rug. He felt
deeply interested, perhaps only because Claire was
the narrator. She held him much as she could
hold an audience in a theatre, by her pose, her
[26]

hands, her pale, almost weary face, her heavy
sombre eyes, even more than by any words she
chanced to be uttering. She could make anything
seem vitally important if she chose, simply by her
manner. Renfrew's pipe had gone out; but he
did not know it, and still kept it between his lips.

âI waited for some time by the flap,â Claire
continued calmly. âI was going to lift it presently,
I knew; but I could not do it at once. The man
and I were standing, I suppose, for full five minutes
only divided by that strip of canvas. I tried
not to breathe audibly, and I could not hear him
breathe. At last I resolved to see him, and considered
how I should do so. If I remained standing
and looked out, I should have to push the flap
quite away and my eyes would be nearly on a
level with his. He would certainly see me. I
didn't wish that. I didn't intend at all that
he should see me. Therefore I resolved to lie
down.â

âOn the ground?â

âYes, quite flat, and to raise the bottom of the
flap gently an inch or two. This would enable
me to see him without being seen, if I did it without
noise. I dropped down quite softly. Do
you remember my death in âCamilleâ?â

Renfrew nodded.

âAlmost like that. But the rose-coloured stuff
rustled again. I wished I hadn't put it on. I
[27]

raised the flap very slightly and peeped out. Do
you know what I felt like just then, Desmond?â

âWhat?â

âJust like a snake in ambush. When my
cloak rustled, it was the grass against my body. I
lay in cover, and could see my enemy like a creature
in a forest, or a reptile in scrub.â

She glanced round at the bushes and the densely
growing palms.

âYes, I lay there like a snake in the grass.â

She stretched herself out on the rug as she
spoke, with her head towards Renfrew and her eyes
fastened on his.

âI saw first the feet of the man close to my
eyes. His feet were almost black and bare. His
legs were bare. My glance travelled up him, and
I saw that his chest and his arms were bare too.
He was clothed in a sort of loose rough garment,
the colour of sacking, that fell into a kind of hood
behind; and he looked enormously powerful.
That struck me very much—his power.â

âDid you see his face?â

âQuite well. It was the face of a man watching
and listening with the closest attention. He was
smiling slightly, too, as if something that had just
happened had satisfied him. I knew he had heard
the rustle of my robe as I slipped to the ground.â

âBut why should that please him?â

âIt told him that I was there, that I was
attentive too.â

[28]

Renfrew's face slightly darkened.

âAs I looked, I saw what he was holding in his
hands.â

âWhat was it—a dagger—a staff?â

âA serpent.â

Renfrew could not repress an exclamation.

âVery large and striped. Its skin was like shot
silk in the moonlight. It writhed softly between
his hands, and turned its flat head from side to side.
It seemed to be trying to bend down towards
where I lay. Its tongue shot out like a length of
riband out of one of those wooden winders that
you buy in cheap shops. I should think its body
was quite five feet long, and its colour seemed to
change as it turned about. Sometimes it was
pink, then it looked dull green and almost black.
Once it wriggled down so near to the ground that
I could see two fangs in its open mouth like hooks,
and the roof of its mouth was flesh colour.â

âHow abominable!â said Renfrew, softly.

âI didn't feel it so at all,â Claire said. âI
wanted it to come to me,—back into the grass
where such things are safe. But the man wouldn't
let it go. He thrust it into his breast. He
wanted to have his hands free.â

âGood God, Claire—what for? Did he—?â

She smiled at his sudden violence, which showed
his interest.

âWhen the snake was safe, he drew out, still
smiling and listening, a little pipe that looked as if
[29]

it were made of straw, very common and dirty.
He held it up to his black lips, and began to play
very softly and sleepily. Desmond, the tune he
played was charmed. It was a tune composed—for—for—â

She broke off.

âYou know the Pied Piper had his tune,â she
said; âthe rats had to follow it. Well, this tune
was for the serpents.â

âTo charm them you mean?â

âWisely—dangerously—almost irresistibly,
perhaps in time, Desmond, quite, quite irresistibly.
There is a music for all creatures, all reptiles, birds,—everything
that lives; this was for the snakes.â

âWell, but, Claire, how did you know that?â

She looked at him with a sort of dull amusement
and pity in her half-shut eyes.

âShall I tell you?â

âYes.â

âI knew it, because the tune charmed me,
Desmond.â

âAh, you are acting! I half suspected it from
the first,â Renfrew exclaimed almost roughly.

He sat up as a man who has been lying under a
spell stirs when the spell is broken. Now he knew
that his pipe was out, and he felt for his match-box.
But Claire still kept her eyes fixed on him,
and laid her hand on his arm gently.

âNo, I am not acting,â she said. âThe tune
charmed me. You see I am a woman; and there
[30]

are many women who feel at moments that what
attracts some special creature, thing, of the so-called
world without a soul, attracts them too.
Some men can whistle a woman as they would a
dog, can't they?â

âPerhaps.â

âYes, and some men can charm a woman as
they could charm a serpent.â

âI don't understand you, Claire.â

âYou don't choose to. The animal is in us all,
hidden deftly by Nature, the artful dodger of the
scheme of creation, Desmond; and we know it
when the right tune is played to summon it from
its slumber in the nest of the human body. Only
the right tune can waken it.â

âThe animal! But—â

âOr the reptile, perhaps. What does it matter?
This was the right tune for me. I lay
there like a snake in the grass and it thrilled me!
And all the time the black man smiled and listened
for the rustling at his feet. You look black,
Desmond! How absurd of you to be angry!â

And she closed her fingers over his hand till the
frown died out of his face.

âThe tune seemed to draw me to the man. I
understood just how he had captured the serpent
that lay hidden in his bosom. It had once lain
in ambush as I lay now, long ago perhaps, in the
desert among the rocks, on the sand, Desmond.â

âAh, the sand!â he said, remembering suddenly
[31]

the strange feeling Claire had described as coming
upon her when she was trying to sleep.

âYes. And he had drawn it from the sand to
the oasis among the palms where he stood playing,
till he heard its rustling in the grass about his feet,
as it glided nearer to him, and nearer, and nearer,
till at last it reared up its body, and wound up him
and round him, and laid its flat head between his
great hands. Yes, that was how it came.â

âYou fancy.â

âI know. But I would not go. I determined
that I would not, and I lay perfectly still. But all
the time I longed to go. I had an almost irresistible
passion for movement towards that tune. It
seemed to me a stream of music into which I yearned
to plunge, and drown and die. And it flowed up
there at the man's lips! The longing increased as
he piped the tune, over and over and over again,
almost under his breath. I was sick with it, and it
hurt me because I resisted it. And at last I knew
that resisting it would kill me. I must either go, or
not go, and die. There was no alternative. That
music simply claimed me. It had the right to. And
if I denied that right I should cease. I did deny it.â

She shuddered in the sun, then added, almost
harshly:—

âLike a fool.â

âAnd then, Claire, then—?â

âIt seemed to me that I died in most horrible
pain. I lived once more when you said, outside
[32]

my tent, âClaire, time to get up.â You see, I
slept too much last night.â

And again she shuddered. A look of relief shot
into Renfrew's face.

âAll this came from your mad performance to
those Moors,â he said. âYou impersonate so
vividly that even sleep cannot release your genius,
and bring it out from the world which you have
deliberately forced it to enter.â

âBut, Desmond, I impersonated the charmer of
the snake, not the snake itself.â

âOh, in a dream the mind always wanders a
little from the event that has caused the dream.
It is like a faulty mimic who strives to reproduce
with exactitude and slightly fails. Time to go,
Absalem?â

The dragoman had come up.

As they rode down the mountain a strange thing
occurred, strange at least in connection with
Claire's narrative of the night. Mohammed, who
was riding just in front of them, pulled up his mule
beside a thicket at the wayside, and, turning his
head, signed to them to be silent. Then, pursing
his lips, he whistled a shrill little tune. In a
moment an answer came from the thicket; Claire
glanced at Renfrew with a slight smile. Here was
a sort of side light of reality thrown upon her
dream and upon their conversation. Mohammed
whistled again. The echo followed. And then
suddenly a bird flew out, almost into his face, and,
[33]

startled, swerved and darted away across the gorge
into the dense woods beyond.

âA charm of birds,â Claire murmured to Renfrew,
as they rode on. âThe summoning tune—what
can resist it?â

âClaire,â he said, almost reproachfully, âyou
speak like a fatalist.â

âAnd I believe I am one,â she answered.
âDestiny is not only a phantom but also a fact.
Mine is marked out for me and known—â

âTo whom? Not to yourself?â

âOh, no!â

âTo whom then?â

âTo the hidden force that directs all things.â

âI am your destiny.â

âAh, Desmond—or Morocco. I feel to-day
as if I shall never see England again, or a civilised
audience such as I have known.â

And then she seemed to fall into a waking
dream. Even Renfrew felt drowsy, the air was
so intensely hot and the motion of the horses so
monotonous. And Mohammed's deep voice was
never silent. It buzzed like a bourdon in the
glare of the noontide, till, far away on the hill-side,
they saw white Tetuan facing the plain, the river
moving stagnantly towards the sea, the great fields
of corn in which strange flowers grew, and the
giant range of shaggy mountains, swimming in a
mist of gold that looked like spangled tissue.

[34]

III

The camp was pitched beyond the city in the
green plain that lies between Tetuan and the sea.
From the tents Renfrew and Claire saw the trains
of camels and donkeys passing slowly along the
high road towards the steep and stony hill that
leads up to the lower city gate, the white-washed
summer palaces of the wealthy Moors, nestling in
gardens, among green fields and groves of acacias,
olives and almond trees, the far-off line of blue
water on the one hand and the fairy-like and ivory
town upon the other. Clouds of brown dust flew
up in the air, and the hoarse cry of âBalak! Balak!â
made a perpetual and distant music. Far more
strange and barbarous was this city than Tangier.
All traces of Europe had faded away. Thousands
of years seemed now to stand like a wall between
the Continents, and the hordes of dark and fanatical
Moslems gazed upon the great actress and her
husband as we gaze at wild animals whose aspects
and whose habits are strange to us.

âI know now what it is to feel like an unclean
dog,â Claire said, as they sat at dinner under the
stars that night, after their halting progress through
the filthy alleys of the white fairyland on the hill-side.
âIt is a grand sensation. I suppose children
enjoy it, too. That must be why they like
making mud-pies.â

[35]

âTo-morrow is market-day, Absalem tells me,â
Renfrew said. âWe will spend it in the town, and
you can feel unclean to your heart's content—you!â

He looked at her and laughed low, with the
pride of a lover in a beautiful woman who is his
own.

âThey ought to fall down and worship you,â he
said.

âMoors worship a woman! Desmond, you are
mad!â

âNo, they are—they are. See, Claire, the
moon is coming up already. Can it be shining on
Piccadilly too, and on the faÃ§ade of the theatre?â

âThe theatre! I can't believe I shall ever see
it again.â

âNonsense!â

âIs it? This wild country seems to have
swallowed me up, and I don't feel as if it will ever
disgorge me again. Desmond, perhaps there are
some lands that certain people ought never to
visit. For those lands love them, and, once they
have seized their prey, they will never yield it up
again. Poor men must often feel that when they
are dying in foreign places. It is the land which
has taken them to itself as an octopus takes a drifting
boat in a lonely sea. Africa!â

She had risen from her seat and moved out into
the vague plain. Renfrew followed her.

âI wonder in which direction the desert lies
[36]

nearest,â she said. âAll the strange people come
in from the desert, as the strange things of life come
in from the future, only one so seldom hears the
tinkling bells of those deadly silent caravans in
which they travel. If we could hear and see them
coming, what emotions we should have!â

âThere are premonitions, some men say,â Renfrew
answered.

âThe faint bells of the caravans ringing,—do
you ever hear them?â

âNo, Claire—never. And you?â

âI half thought I did once.â

âWhen was that?â

âLast night. Hark! The men have finished
supper and are beginning to sing. That's a song
about dancing.â

âTo-morrow we are going to feast the soldiers,
and have an African fire.â

âSplendid! I think I will leap through the
flames.â

Renfrew put his arm round her.

âNo, no. They might singe your beauty.
And yet, you are a flame too. You have burnt
your name, yourself, like a brand upon my heart.â

The dancing song rang up in the moonlight like
the wailing of dead masqueraders. All Moorish
songs are sad and thrilling, fateful and pregnant
with unrest and with forebodings.

With the daylight the Jews came, in their long
and morose garments and black skull-caps, bearing
[37]

bales of embroideries, slippers, and uncut jewels.
When they saw the wonderful black pearl upon
Claire's finger their huge eyes flamed with an
avarice so fierce and open that Renfrew instinctively
moved between them and Claire, as if to guard her
from assault.

But the wonderful pearl was not for them.

The sun blazed furiously when they got upon
their horses to ride to the Soko. Each day the
season was growing hotter, and Absalem told them
that there were no English in Tetuan. Nor did they
set eyes on a European woman until that day when
Renfrew rode back, crouching along his horse, to
the villas of Tangier.

Tetuan has more than one open mouth, and when
it swallows you the contemplation of a fairyland is
immediately exchanged for a desperate reality of
populous filth, stentorian uproar, uneven boulders,
beggars, bazaars like rabbit hutches, men and children
pitted with small-pox till they appear scarcely
human, lepers, Jews, pirates from the Riff Mountains,
fanatics from the Ape's Hill, water-carriers,
veiled, waddling women, dogs like sharp shadows,
and monkeys that appear and vanish in sinister
doorways with the rapidity and gestures of demons.
On a market-day the city is so full that it seems as
if the circling and irregular white walls must burst
and disgorge the clamouring and gesticulating inhabitants
into the tranquil plain below. Claire
surveyed this blanched hell with a still serenity, as
[38]

she had often surveyed an applauding audience at
the close of her evening's task, ere she thanked
them with the curious gesture, that was almost a
salaam, in which humility and a remote pride
mingled. Noise generally gave her calm; and when
passion broke from her she taught the world to be
intensely silent. These alleys became like a dream
to her, and the tiny interiors of the bazaars were
little histories of visionary lives, some, but only a
few, mysteriously beautiful. One, in a very dark
place where, for some unknown cause, all voices
died away till the hot air was full of a whispering
stillness, brought slow tears to Claire's eyes. In
the Street of the Slippers she passed a cupboard of
wood raised high from the pavement, with low
roof, leaning walls, and, in front, a little bar like
that which fences an English baby in its chair before
the fire. In this cupboard squatted two tiny
Moorish infants, sole occupants of the cupboard,
with solemn faces, bending to ply their trade of
pricking patterns upon rose-coloured Morocco
leather. There was no beauty in the cupboard,
sweetness of light, or ease. And the faces of the
little boys were sad and elderly. But, placed carefully
between them, was an ugly three-legged stool,
on which stood two dwarf earthen jars containing
two sprigs of orange flower, and, as Claire looked,
one of the babes laid down his leather, lifted his
jar, sniffed, with a sort of gentle resignation, at his
flower, and then resumed his diligent labours, re
[39]
freshed
perhaps, and strengthened. In the action
Claire seemed to catch sight of a little pallid soul
striving to exist feebly among the slippers.

âDid you see?â she cried to Renfrew, when
the baby shoemakers were lost to sight.

He nodded.

âI wish I were a Moorish woman, Desmond.â

âGood Heaven! Why!â

âSo that I could kiss the infant who smelt
the orange flower in his own language. Little
artist!â

Her sudden blaze of enthusiasm was checked
by the infernal Soko into which they now entered.
In this unpaved square, upon which the pitiless
sun beat, the earth seemed to have come alive,
to have formed itself into a thousand vague semblances
of human figures, and to be shrieking,
moving, twisting, gesticulating, as if striving to
impart a thousand abominable secrets till now
hidden from the world that walks upon its surface.
As snow-men resemble the snow, so did
these bargainers, these buyers, sellers, barterers,
pedlars, resemble the baked earth on which they
squatted. Shrouded in earth-coloured garments,
they shrieked, strove, rang their bells, kicked their
donkeys, elbowed their rivals, pommelled their
camels, recited the Koran, or testified with frenzy,
the terrific honesty of all their dealings. Here
and there tents made of mud-coloured rags cast
a grotesque shadow, in which broad women,
[40]

hidden by veils like sacks, and dominated by straw
hats a yard wide, sat huddled together and pecked
at by wandering fowls. Jew boys, with long and
expressive faces, their black hair plastered upon their
foreheads in fringes that touched their eyes, strolled
through the mob in batches, some of them reading
in little books. Soudanese slave girls carried
bouquets of orange flowers. In a corner some
Hawadji were leaping monotonously to the thunder
of a Moorish drum made of baked earth and
of parchment. A sheep, escaped from the slaughterer,
tumbled with piteous bleatings into a group
of half breeds, Spanish Moors, who were playing
cards near a stall covered with raw meat and great
lumps of some substance that looked like lard.
On a huge heap of rotten oranges and decaying
fish, over which millions of flies swarmed, a
number of children in close white caps were
moving in some mysterious game in which two
prowling cats occasionally took an unintentional
part. Some Riff Arabs, fierce as tigers, tall and
half-naked, stalked feverishly towards a water-carrier
whose lean form, tottering with age, was
almost eclipsed beneath the monstrous bladder
he bore incessantly through the multitude. The
horses of Renfrew and of Claire could scarcely
plant their hoofs on anything that was not moving,
crying, panting, or cursing; and they pulled up,
and prepared to descend into this human ocean of
which all the waves roared in their deafened ears.
[41]

As Claire leant to Renfrew, who stretched his
arms to help her, she said to him:—

âCan you swim? If not, you will certainly
be drowned.â

âYou must not be. Cling to my arm.â

They sank together to their necks in the sea.
In whatever direction they looked, they saw a
mass of heads, an infinite expanse of shouting
mouths. But suddenly the pressure became extraordinary,
the uproar ear-splitting. And with the
voices there mingled a piercing music like a continuous
screech. People began to run, to trample
in one direction. The drum of the leaping
Hawadji was drowned by a louder drumming that
came from the centre of the square. Children
squeaked with excitement. The Riffians forgot
to drink, and slid forward with the cushioned feet
of animals in a jungle. A tempest arose, and in it
a whirlpool formed. It seemed that Renfrew and
Claire must be torn in pieces.

âWhat on earth is happening?â Renfrew exclaimed
to Absalem, with the English anger our
countrymen always display when trodden by a
foreign element.

Absalem smiled with airy dignity, and moved
forward, beckoning them to follow.

âMiracle man, all want see him,â he remarked.
âGreat miracle man.â

With consummate adroitness he drew them
with him to the edge of the whirlpool. As they
[42]

reached it, Renfrew felt that Claire's hand suddenly
tightened upon his arm until his flesh
puckered between her fingers as the flesh of a
rabbit puckers in a trap. He glanced at her in
astonishment. Her eyes were fixed on something,
or some one, beyond them, even beyond Absalem,
who was forcing people out of their way with his
powerful arms and back. Renfrew followed her
eyes, and saw the centre of the whirlpool.

This mass of humanity had now assumed the
form of a rough circus, the ring of which was
kept clear. And in this ring a strange figure had
just appeared with upraised arms, and a manner
of wild, even of frantic, authority. This was a
gigantic man, almost black, half-naked, with long
arms, furious eyes, and legs which, though muscular,
tapered at the ankles like the legs of a finely
bred race-horse. His head was shaved in front;
but at the back the black hair grew in a long and
waving lock, and his features, magnificently cut,
might have been those of a grand European of
some headstrong and high-couraged race. Upon
this man Claire's eyes were fixed, with an expression
so strange and knowing that Renfrew
turned on her with a sharp exclamation.

âClaire! Claire!â

She slowly withdrew her eyes.

âYes, Desmond.â

A question stammered on his lips; but as she
smiled at him, he felt the mad absurdity of it, and
was silent.

[43]

âWell, Desmond, what is it?â

âNothing,â he answered.

Absalem now claimed their attention. He was
determined that they should be in the front of the
crowd, and ruthlessly pushed away the Moors who
had obtained the best places, pointing at Claire and
Renfrew, and wildly vociferating their mighty rank
and enormous wealth. The staring mob gave
way; and in a moment Claire and the miracle man
stood face to face. His frenzied eyes had no sooner
seen her than he too fell upon the surrounding
natives, thrusting them violently to one side, and
cursing them for daring to draw near to the great
English gentleman and lady. In the whole mighty
mob these two were the only Europeans, and they
attracted as universal an attention as two Aztecs
would in a Bank Holiday gathering at the Crystal
Palace. Renfrew could now see that the screeching
music came from one side of the ring, where a
couple of men, clothed in filthy rags, were sitting
on the ground, one playing a long pipe of straw,
the other beating an enormous drum. Immediately
behind them a very old man, evidently a
maniac, swayed his body violently backwards and
forwards, and at regular intervals uttered a loud
and chuckling cry that might have been the ejaculation
of a tipsy school-boy, and came strangely from
withered lips hanging loose with weakness and
with age. This dancing Methuselah caught Renfrew's
attention; and, for the moment, he forgot
[44]

to look at the miracle man. A general outcry
from the multitude made him turn his head. He
saw then that the miracle man held in his huge
hands a sort of kennel of straw, the mouth of which
was closed with a movable flap. Lifting this aloft,
he sprang wildly round the ring, vociferating some
words at the top of his voice; then, suddenly
casting it down, he flung himself upon the ground,
which he beat with his forehead, while he shrieked
out a prayer to his patron saint for protection in
the great miracle which he was about to perform.

âWhat is he doing?â Renfrew asked of Absalem.

âDon't you know?â Claire said.

Her eyes were gleaming with excitement as they
stared at the salaaming figure that grovelled at their
feet.

âNo. How should I?â

âHe is praying to Sidi Mahomet,â she said.

And then she looked at Renfrew. He understood.
At that moment, despite the excessive heat
engendered by the blazing sun and the pressure of
the crowd, he turned very cold, as if his body was
plunged in glacier water. He thought of the tall
figure that had stood before Claire's tent door in
the moonbeams, the lips that had coaxed from the
pipe the tune that charmed all serpents,—that right
tune that they must follow, which drew them from
the desert sands to the grass of the oasis, till they
wound up the body of this gaunt and tremendous
[45]

savage, and hid themselves in his hairy bosom.
This miracle man, then, was a snake-charmer, and
Claire had divined it at once. How? Renfrew
put the question quickly.

âHow did I know? He is the man who played
outside my tent in the night, Desmond.â

âThe very man! Impossible.â

âThe very man.â

âThen you were not asleep, not dreaming?â

âHow can one tell? Hush!â

She spoke in the low voice of one whose attention
is becoming concentrated, and who cannot
endure the interruption. The charmer had now
finished his petition to his god, and, standing up,
thrust into his mouth a handful of some green herb,
which he chewed and swallowed. Then his whole
manner abruptly changed. The frenzy died out
of his eyes. A calm suffused his tall and muscular
body till it became strangely statuesque. His lips
slowly smiled, and he raised his hands towards the
glaring sky with a sublime gesture of gratitude.

âWhat an actor!â Renfrew heard Claire
murmur softly.

He, too, had become intensely engrossed by this
man in whom he, from this moment, began to see
Claire: the exquisite woman whom the civilised
world worshipped in the mighty savage who came
from the remote depths of Morocco; the white being
who played with the minds of the capitals of
Europe, in the black being who played with the
[46]

reptiles of the desert and of the jungle. For Claire,
guided by the spirit that ever goes before genius
bearing the torch, had instinctively divined what
she had never known. In London it seemed that
she had entered into the very soul of this man who
now stood before her. She had caught the wild
graces of his bearing. She had reproduced his smile,
so full of secrets and of power. She had moved as
he did. She had been motionless as now he was
motionless. In the sun she stood at this moment
and beheld the reality of which she had been the
magnificent reflection. And Renfrew felt his heart
oppressed, as if clouds were closing round him.

Now the snake-charmer looked slowly all round
the great circle of watching faces until his eyes
rested on Claire. He had taken the straw kennel
into his hands, and he softly lifted the flap, and
turned it flat upon the top of the kennel, leaving
the mouth open. Then he thrust one hand into
this mouth, and withdrew it, holding a writhing
snake whose striped satin skin changed colour in
the sunshine, turning from pink to green, from
green to black.

âIt is the snake I saw,â Claire whispered to
Renfrew.

He did not reply. He seemed fascinated by the
savage and the serpent. Holding the snake at
arm's length, the charmer walked softly round
the circle, collecting money from the crowd. He
stopped in front of Claire. The snake thrust out
[47]

its flat head towards her. She did not shrink from
it; and the charmer cried aloud some words that
seemed like praise of her beauty and of her composure.
She gave him a piece of gold. Renfrew
gave him nothing.

Then, standing once more in the centre of the
circle, he burst into a frantic incantation, while the
musicians redoubled their efforts, and the old maniac
in the corner gave forth his chuckling cry with
greater force, and swayed his trembling body more
vehemently to and fro. The snake, suddenly
brought from the darkness of the kennel to the
light of day, was torpid and weary. It drooped
between the charmer's hands. He shook it, called
on it, caught up a stick and struck it. Then,
forcing its mouth wide open, he barred its pink
throat with the stick, on which he made it fix its
two fangs, which were like two sharp hooks.
Holding the end of the stick, he came again to
Claire, to whom his whole performance was now
exclusively devoted; and, approaching the hanging
reptile close to her eyes, he jumped it up and down
to the sound of the drum and pipe.

âYou see,â Claire said to Renfrew, âthe roof of
its mouth is flesh-colour.â

He did not answer. Why did all this mean so
much to him? Why did the clouds grow darker?
The music and the cries of the old maniac perturbed
him and bewildered his brain. And he
wanted to be calm, and to watch Claire and this
[48]

savage with a cool and undivided attention. By
this time the snake was growing irritated. It
agitated its long body furiously; and when the
charmer unhooked its fangs from the stick, it
turned its head towards him and made a sudden
dart at his face. He opened his mouth wide, thrust
the snake into it, and let the creature fasten on
his tongue, from which blood began to flow. Still
bleeding, and with the snake fixed on his tongue,
he danced and sprang into the air. His eyes grew
wild. Foam ran from his mouth, and his whole
appearance became demoniacal. Yet his eyes still
fastened themselves upon Claire. In his most
frantic moments his attention was never entirely
distracted from the spot where she was standing.
He tore the snake from his tongue and buried its
fangs in the flesh of his left wrist. Cries broke
from the crowd. The sight of the blood had excited
them, for these people love blood as the toper
loves wine. They urged the charmer on to fresh
exertions with furious screams of encouragement.
The maniac bent his body like a dervish in the last
exercises of his religion, and the ragged musicians
forced a more extreme uproar from their instruments.
The charmer caught the snake by the tail,
and strove to pull it backwards off his wrist. But
the reptile's fangs were firmly fastened. It held
on with a terrible tenacity, and a struggle ensued
between it and its master. When at length it gave
way, it was streaked with blood, and now at last
[49]

thoroughly aroused. The charmer scraped his
tongue with a straw; then, casting himself again
upon the earth, he prayed once more with fury to
Sidi Mahomet. Claire watched him always, with
that pale and exquisite attention which one genius
gives to the performance of another. Her face was
white and still. Her body never moved. But her
eyes blazed with life, and with the fires of a violent
soul completely awake. Having finished his prayer,
which ended in a cry so poignant that it might have
burst from the lips of that world on which the
flood came, the charmer remained upon the ground
in a sitting posture, laid the snake in his lap, and drew
from the inside of his ragged robe a Moorish lute
made of a bladder, bamboo, and two strings, and
coloured a pale yellowish-green. He plucked the
strings gently, and played the fragment of a wild
tune. Then, suddenly catching up the snake, and
thrusting his tongue far out of his mouth, he poised
the snake upon it, rose to his feet and stood at his
full height in front of Claire, fixing his eyes upon
her with a glance that seemed to claim from her
both wonder and worship. The snake reared itself
up higher and higher upon the quivering tongue;
and the charmer, extending his long arms, whirled
slowly round as if poised upon a movable platform,
while a terrific clamour broke from the Moors, who
seemed to be roused by this feat to the highest pitch
of excitement. Still turning and turning, the
charmer drew from his bosom a second snake that
[50]

was black and larger than the first, and coiled it
round his sinewy neck like a gigantic necklace, the
darting head in front, resting, a sort of monstrous
pendant, upon his uncovered chest. To Renfrew
he looked like some hateful grotesque in a nightmare,
inhuman, endowed with attributes of a devil.
The serpents were part of him, growths of his
body, visible signs of some terrible disease in which
he gloried and of which he made a show. The
creature was intolerable. His exhibition had suddenly
become to Renfrew unfit for the eyes of any
woman; and, without a word, he took hold of
Claire and pulled her almost violently away from
the circle on which the fascinated mob was beginning
to encroach. She resisted him.

âDesmond!â she exclaimed, âwhat are you
doing?â

âClaire—come. I insist upon it!â

Already the Moors had thronged the place which
they had left vacant. She turned a white face on
him. There was in her eyes the hideous expression
of a sleep-walker suddenly awakened, and she
trembled in every limb. She swung round from
Renfrew, and, above the intercepting Moors, high
in the air, she saw the snake, which seemed climbing
to heaven. While she looked, a huge hand
closed upon it and took it out of sight. The
charmer, observing the departure of his distinguished
patrons, had abruptly stopped his performance.
Claire made no further resistance. Without a
[51]

word, she permitted Renfrew to lead her to the
horses and help her into the saddle. They rode
down the hill to the camp without exchanging a
word.

When Claire had dismounted, she stood for a
moment twisting her whip in her hands. Then
she said:—

âDesmond, I must ask you never to startle me
again as you did to-day, by sudden action. You
can't understand how such an interruption hurts
a nature like mine. I would rather you had
struck me. That would only have wounded my
body.â

She turned and went into her tent, leaving Renfrew
in an agony of penitence and self-reproach.
All the rest of the afternoon she was very cold and
silent, rather dreamy than sullen, but obviously
disinclined for conversation, and still more obviously
unwilling to endure even the slightest demonstration
of affection on the part of Renfrew.
When the sheep which were to be slaughtered for
the soldiers' feast were driven bleating into the
camp, she retired into her tent, and remained
there, resting, until the sun was low in the heavens,
and the porters and mule-drivers went gaily out to
search for the materials of the African fire with
which the night was to be celebrated. They
returned, singing the Moorish conquest of Granada,
with their strong arms full of canes, dry and brittle
branches of trees, logs that looked like whole
[52]

trunks, and huge shrubs, green and sweet-smelling.
Hearing their song, Claire came out of her tent.
The sky was red, and, in the southwest, turrets of
vapour rose and streamed out, assuming mysterious
and thin shapes in the gathering dimness. A great
flock of birds, flying very high, and forming a
definite and beautiful pattern, passed slowly on the
wing towards the kingdom of the storks, that lies
near the sand banks of Ceuta. They moved in
silence, and faded away in the twilight stealthily,
like things full of quiet intention and governed by
some furtive, but inexorable, desire. Renfrew, who
was wandering rather miserably near the camp,
watching descending pilgrims from the city melt
into the vast bosom of the plain, saw Claire's white
figure in the tent door, half hidden in a soft rosy
mist which stole from the lips of evening as scent
steals from the lips of a flower. He felt afraid to
go to her. He possessed her; and yet it seemed to
him now that he scarcely knew her. He was only
an ordinary man. She was a strange woman; not
merely because of her womanhood, as all women
are to all men, but strange in that which lay
beyond and beneath her womanhood, in her genius,
and in the dull or ardent moods that stood round
it, one, and yet not one, with it. In the tent door
she leaned like a spirit born of the evening, a child
of fading things, dying lights, fainting colours,
retreating sounds,—a spirit waiting for the coming
of the stars, and the rising of the moon, and
[53]

the mysteries of the night, and the subtle odours
that the winds of Northern Africa bring with them
over the mountains and down the lonely valleys,
when the sun descends. And as a spirit may listen
to the songs of men, with the melancholy of a thing
apart, she listened to the songs of the Moors, until
at length they seemed to be in her own heart that
evening, as if they were songs of her own country.
And these dark men with wild eyes who sang
them, while they flung upon the grass their burdens
from the thickets, and from the hedgeless and wide
fields, were no longer alien to her. She stood in
the tent door, and, without any conscious effort of
the imagination, became their fancied mate,—a
woman sprung from the same soil, or come in—like
the strange people—from the deserts of their
country. Only she was not as one of their women,
mindless, patient, and concealed; but as their women
should be, strong, hot-blooded, brave, serene, and
looked upon by a world without reproach.

Absalem came up to her to tell her some details
of the night's festivity. Before he spoke she said
to him:—

âWhere does the desert lie?â

He told her.

âDoes the miracle man come from there?â

Absalem answered that no one knew. He had
been much in Wasan, the sacred city of Morocco;
but none knew his birthplace, his tribe, his name.
Often he disappeared, no man could tell whither.
[54]

But, doubtless, he made vast journeys. Some said
that he had exhibited his snakes on the banks of
the Nile, that he had gone with the pilgrim trains
to Mecca, that he knew Khartoum as he knew
Marakesh, and that he never ceased from wandering.

âWhat is his age?â Claire asked.

Absalem answered that he must be old, but
that Time had no power over him.

âHe miracle man; he live long as he wish.â

Last she asked when he would leave Tetuan.

âPerhaps this night. Perhaps to-morrow night,
perhaps never. Perhaps he go already.â

âAlready!â

Suddenly Claire moved out from the tent, and
joined Renfrew, who was still watching her, and
weaving lover's fancies about her white figure.

âHave you been here long, Desmond?â she
asked.

âVery long, dearest. Are you rested?â

âQuite. From here you can see all the people
travelling away from the city towards the sea?â

âYes.â

âHave you been watching them?â

âYes, indeed; for half the afternoon.â

She turned her great eyes on him searchingly,
and seemed as if she checked a question which
was almost on her lips.

âThey must have been a strange multitude,â
she said at length. âI wonder where they are
all going?â

[55]

âSome to the villages in the plain, some to the
coast. I saw the Riffs who were in the Soko pass
by. I suppose they were returning to the caverns
from which they plunder becalmed vessels, Spanish
and Portuguese.â

âThe Riffs—yes?â

Her intonation suggested that she was waiting
for some further information. Renfrew's curiosity
was aroused.

âWhy do you look at me like that?â he asked.
âWhat do you want to know?â

âNothing, Desmond. How dark it is getting!
There is Mohammed ringing the bell. And look,
those must be the soldiers. They are just marching
in from the city.â

With the coming of night a wind arose, blowing
towards the sea from the mountains; and with
it came up a troop of clouds which blotted out
stars and moon, and plunged the plain into a gulf
of darkness. Tetuan does not gleam with lamps
at night like a European city, and all the distant
villas of the Moors were closely shuttered. So
the wind, warm and scented and strong, swept
over a black land, deserted and vacant. Only in
the camp was there movement, music, and an
illumination that strove up in the night, as if it
would climb to the clouds. Scarcely had Claire
and Renfrew finished dinner, when Absalem and
Mohammed ceremoniously appeared to conduct
them out to the bare space before the tents on
[56]

which the African fire had been carefully built.
Absalem carried a lamp which swung in the wind,
and, behind, there appeared from the kitchen tent
some of the porters, bearing burning brands, the
flames of which were at right angles to the wood
from which they sprung. The guard of soldiers,
one dozen in all, armed with immense guns and
wrapped in hooded cloaks, were already crouched
in a silent mass before the lifeless and portentous
erection which came out of the darkness, as
Absalem swung forward the lamp, like the skeleton
of a monster. They turned their shadowy faces
on Claire, and stared with eyes intent and unself-conscious
as those of an animal. The porters
flung their brands on to the mountain of twigs, and
instantaneously a huge sheet of livid gold sprang up
against the black background of the night, as if it
had been shaken out on the wind by invisible
hands. This sheet expanded, swayed, fluttered in
ragged edges, and cast forth a cloud of sparks
which were carried away into the air and vanished
in the sky. The shrubs caught fire and crackled
furiously, and finally the foundation of gigantic
logs began to glow steadily, and to fill the wind
with a scorching heat. The camp was gradually
defined, at first vaguely and in sections,—the peak
of a tent, the head of a mule, a startled pariah
dog, a Moor set in the eye of the flames; then
clearly, as the buildings one may see in a furnace,
complete and glowing. The faces of the soldiers
[57]

were barred with flickering orange, and red lights
played in their huge and staring eyeballs. The
horses and mules could be counted. Before the
kitchen tent the sacrifice of sheep was visible,
stewing in enormous pans upon red embers in a
trench of earth. And the grave cook, who was
distinguished by a white turban, shone like a pantomime
magician at the mouth of an enchanted
cave. Warmth, light, life poured upon the night,
and the voices of men began to mingle with the
continuous voice of this superb fire. The Moors,
soldiers, servants, porters, kindled into furious
gaiety with the swiftness of the canes and olive
boughs. They sprang up from the ground, pulled
the shrouding hoods from their faces, tossed away
their djelabes, and began, with shouts and ejaculations,
to dance up and down before the golden
sheet, spreading their hands to it with the glee of
children. A sudden joy beamed in the dusky and
solemn faces, twinkled in the sombre eyes. One
man flung away his fez, another dashed his turban
to the ground. Round, shaven heads, bare arms,
brown legs, half concealed by fluttering linen
knickerbockers, lithe bodies emerged with eager
haste into the light. Shadows became abruptly
men, formless humps athletes. Mutes sent out
great voices to startle the sweeping bats. Mourners
turned into maniacs. It was a fantasia that
exploded into life like a rocket, shedding a stream
of vivid human fire. Mohammed drew away
[58]

from the flames, taking a dozen swift footsteps to
the rear. Then, with a shout, he dashed forward,
bounded into the golden sheet, and disappeared as
a clown disappears through a paper hoop. Only
the paper closed up behind him. He leaped
through light to darkness, pursued by a thousand
eager sparks. One soldier followed him, then
another, and another. The porters, linking hands,
leaped in twos and threes. Even the cook, old,
and serious with a weight of savoury knowledge,
tottered to the edge of the fire, which was now
becoming a furnace, and took it as an Irish horse
takes a stone wall, striking the topmost branches
with his bare feet amid a chorus of yells.

Claire watched the darting figures with a silent
gravity. She did not seem to be stirred by the fantasia
of the firelight, or to catch any gaiety or life
from the boisterous activity of those about her.
The flames lit up the whiteness of her face, and
showed Renfrew that she was looking gloomy and
even despairing.

âIs anything the matter, Claire?â he asked
anxiously.

âNo. How could there be?â

The wind, which was increasing in violence,
blew her thin dress forward, and she shivered.
Absalem noticed it.

âWear djelabe, lady,â he said.

And in a moment he had taken his off, and was
carefully wrapping Claire in it. She seemed glad of
[59]

it, thanked him, and, with a quick gesture that hurt
Renfrew, pulled the big brown hood up over her
head, so that her face was entirely concealed from
view. She now looked exactly like a Moor, and
might have been mistaken for one of the soldiers
before the fire was lit and all impeding garments
were thrown aside.

Renfrew, uneasy, and wondering what conduct on
his part would best suit her mysterious mood, after
one or two remarks to which she barely replied,
drew away a little, and gave his attention to the
antics of the soldiers. Some of them were already
resuming their djelabes, in preparation for the feast,
which they sniffed even through the odour of burning
wood and leaves. The cook, after his emotional
and acrobatic outburst, had returned to his pans,
which he was stirring tenderly with a stick. When
Renfrew again looked towards Claire, he found it
impossible to tell which cloak shrouded her from
his sight. Four or five hooded figures stood near
the fire. She must be one of them. He approached
the group, but found, to his surprise, that
all the members of it were soldiers. Claire had
moved away. Renfrew stood for a few minutes
with the men, till they were summoned to their
feast, which, strangely enough, was to take place
away from the fire in the dense darkness behind
the tents. Then he was left alone by the huge
mass of flame, which roared hoarsely in the wind.
Where could Claire be? On any ordinary occa
[60]
sion
Renfrew would certainly have sought for her,
but to-night something held him back. He knew
very well that she wished to be alone, that something
was closely occupying her mind. Whether
she was still brooding over the event of the afternoon,
when he had forcibly led her away in the
very crisis of the snake-charmer's performance, he
could not tell. To an ordinary woman such a
matter would have been a trifle; but Renfrew
understood that Claire felt it more deeply. Her
mind appeared to be mysteriously moved and
awakened by this savage from the depths of
Morocco. Various circumstances combined to
render him more interesting to her than he could
possibly be to any ordinary traveller. Renfrew
recognised that fully and quietly. The genius of
Claire had enabled her to realise in London all
the wildly picturesque idiosyncrasies of a man
whom she had never seen or heard of. Suddenly
fate had led her to him, and she had beheld her
own performance, the original of her imitation.
As Renfrew stood by the fire, he began to feel the
folly of his proceeding of the afternoon, and to
imagine more clearly than before the condition into
which it had thrown Claire. It is a sin to disturb
the contemplations of genius. It is sacrilege.
And then Renfrew had been moved to his act by a
preposterous access of jealousy. He acknowledged
this to himself. He had been jealous of Claire's
interest in this man's performance, jealous perhaps
[61]

even of her dream among the hills in the midnight
camp, where the man stood before her sleeping eyes,
and played with his visionary serpent. How mad
can a lover be? He resolved to go to Claire, and
ask her pardon. This resolve thrilled him. To
carry it out, he would have to draw very near to
Claire, to unpack his heart to her. After all, she
had given herself to him. But he had appreciated
the wonder of his rÃ´le as possessor so keenly, that
he had waited upon her moods with an almost
trembling awe. Now, in asking pardon, he would
show that in his passion he could be strong.
Women want to see the man in the lover, as well
as the devotee. Renfrew, in acknowledging his
jealousy of a black savage, meant to clasp Claire
with the arms of a whirlwind.

Meanwhile she was hidden from him. The
wind blew strongly. The sparks leaped away in
clouds toward the sea. From the dense darkness
behind him came a sound of music. The soldiers
were feasting. The porters were striking the lute,
and singing songs of the dance and of love and of
victory. It was a night of comradeship and of rejoicing.
Yet he stood alone; and the turmoil of
his heart was unheeded. He tried to explore the
blackness of the night which stood round the golden
fire with his eyes. Claire must be in that blackness
close to him. Doubtless she saw him, a red and
yellow creature, painted into fictitious brilliance by
the illumination which was shed upon him. She
[62]

saw him and kept from him. Renfrew resolved to
be patient. When her mood of reserve died she
would come to him, in her dress of a Moor, and
he would kiss the white face beneath the hood,
and put his arms round the thin figure that was
lost in the djelabe of brawny Absalem, and tell her
the true story of his heart, never fully told to her
yet. He squatted down before the fire, lit his pipe,
shrugged his shoulders against the tempest from
the mountains, and waited, listening to the weird
music that swept by him like a hidden bird on the
wind.

And Claire—where was she? When Absalem
wrapped her in the huge djelabe it seemed to Claire
that he had divined her secret longing to be in hiding.
She disappeared into the mighty hood of the garment
as into a cave. Its shadow concealed her
from the watching eyes of Renfrew. There was
warmth in it and a beautiful darkness. She desired
both. She saw Renfrew turn to watch the leaping
soldiers, and stole away out of the illuminated circle
formed by the glow from the fire, into the night
beyond. She did not go far, only into the nearest
shadow. And there she sat down on the short dry
grass, and forgot Renfrew, the roaring flames, the
wind that felt incessantly at her robe, the shouting
guard, the radiant and dancing attendants. She forgot
them all as completely as if they had never been
in her life; for the strangeness of certain incidents
preoccupied her, to the exclusion of everything else.
[63]

In the double existence of a really great actress
there are many moments in which the truths of the
imagination seem more important than the truths
of physical phenomena of things seen by the eye,
of sounds received and appreciated by the ear. In
these moments, genius usurps the throne of reason,
and the mind beholds fancies as sunlit gods, facts
as timid and scarcely defined shadows. So it was
with Claire now. Even the snake-charmer, as he
gave his performance in the Soko, was a shadow in
comparison with that man who summoned her to
the tent door in the solitary encampment. And
behind and beyond both these figures of truth and
dreaming stood a third, created for herself by Claire
in London, that figure into whom she had poured
her soul as into a mould, when she charmed imaginary
serpents, and prayed to the god in whom,
for a moment, she believed with the passion of
the perfect mime. This trio Claire placed in line,
and reviewed: charmer of her imagination, of her
dream, of the Soko.

They were the same, and yet not the same.
For the first was dominated, even was created by
her. The second stood above her, like some
magician, and summoned her as one possessing a
right. The third—what of him? He was a wild
creature of blood and foam, crafty, a player like
herself, a maker of money, a savage in sacking, and
almost nothing to her now. Out of the desert he
came. Into the desert he was, perhaps, even now,
[64]

returning, with his snakes sleeping in his bosom,
and the money of the Tetuan Moors jingling in
his pouch.

Yes, she saw him, travelling like a shadow in
the night, one of those grotesques which leap on
bedroom walls when a lamp flares in the wind that
sighs through an open casement. He was going;
but the man of the dream remained. The dream
man had come up out of the world that is vaguer
to us than the desert when we wake, and clearer
to us than the desert when we sleep. Claire saw
him still, and, while the wonderful mountebank of
the Soko passed, he stood in the tent door like a
statue of ebony, a rooted reality. And the snake
was in his bosom; and the pipe was at his lips;
and the power was in his heart. And as he played,
Claire thought beneath the djelabe of Absalem,
there came to him, with the faltering steps of a
thing irresistibly charmed, that third man whose soul
she had seen in London, like approaching like,
with the manner of a slave and the glance of the
conquered. And her soul was still within that
charmed figure. She could not rescue it now from
the place where she had put it. And the statue at
the tent door played the irresistible melody until
his wild and cringing double stole to his very feet,
and nearer and nearer, till they melted together,
and where two men had been, there was only one.
He smiled with a subtle triumph, laid down his
pipe, stretched out his arms and vanished. But
[65]

within him now was the soul of Claire, borne
wherever he should go, his captive, his possession
for all eternity.

Behind her, in the cloudy darkness, Claire heard
a movement, and the gliding of soft feet on grass.
She did not turn her head, supposing that one of
the soldiers was keeping his guard. The movement
ceased. But the little noise had broken the
thread on which her fancies were strung. They
were scattered like beads. She found herself feeling
quite ordinary, and listening with an urging
attention for a renewal of the trifling noise behind
her. In the distance she could see Renfrew, now
crouching before the fire, which poured colour and
a piercing vitality upon him. She heard also, and
for the first time, the sound of the porters' music,
which had been audible in the night all through her
reverie, though she was entirely unaware of the
fact. She realised that the soldiers were devouring
the stew of mutton, and that she was in a gay camp,
full of human beings in a state of unusual satisfaction.
One of these human beings must be close
to her. She turned her head. But she was sitting
in the darkness beyond the illumination of the fire,
and beyond her the night was like a black wall.
Whatever had moved there was invisible to her.
She had not heard the gliding step go away, and
she felt that she was not alone. This feeling
began to render her uneasy. She got up, with the
intention of returning to the firelight and to Ren
[66]
frew.
Indeed she had taken a step or two in his
direction, when she was checked by an unreasonable
desire to see who had come so close to her,
who had broken her reverie. Acting upon the
sudden impulse, she turned swiftly and came on
into the darkness. Almost instantly she stood
before the dim outline of a man, and paused. Here
in the night it was very lonely, even though the
illuminated camp was so near. Claire hesitated to
approach this man who seemed to be on watch and
who was perfectly motionless. She waited a moment,
wishing that he would come to her in order
that she might see what he was like, whether he
carried a gun and was a soldier. But it was soon
evident that he did not mean to move. Then
Claire went up so close to him that his coarse
garment rubbed against her djelabe and his eyes
stared right down into hers. And she saw that it
was the snake-charmer from the Soko, who was
looking into her face with the very smile of the
man in her dream. Round his bare throat one
of his snakes was twined, and he held its neck
between the fingers of his left hand. The wind
tossed his short and ragged cloak wildly to and fro,
and whirled the long lock of hair at the back of his
shaven head about, and made it dance like a living
thing. When Claire came up to him, he never
said a word, or moved at all. It seemed to her
that his face was that of some dark and triumphant
being, waiting immovably for something that was
[67]

certain to come to him, and to come so close that
he need not even stretch out his hand to take it as
his possession. What was the thing he waited for?
She looked at his black face and at the snake which
moved slowly, trying to thrust its way downward
into the warmth of his bosom, out of the reach of
the wind and of the night. And, when the man's
fingers unclosed to release it, and it slid away and
softly disappeared beneath his garment, Claire
shuddered under the influence of a sensation that
was surely mad. For she felt that she envied the
snake, and that the charmer was waiting there in
the darkness for her. As the snake vanished,
Claire recoiled towards the fire. The charmer
did not attempt to follow her, and his huge and
watchful figure quickly faded from Claire's eyes till
his blackness had become one with the blackness
of the night.

IV

Renfrew, as he crouched before the fire, felt a
light touch on his shoulder. He looked up, saw
Claire's white face peering down on him, and
sprang to his feet.

âI thought you were never coming, that you had
deserted me altogether, and left me lonely in the
midst of the fantasia,â he cried, seizing her hands.

âI am cold,â she said; âhorribly cold. Let
me sit beside you, close to the fire.â

[68]

She sat down on the ground, almost touching
the roaring flames.

âWhere have you been?â

âSitting in the dark. The soldiers are feasting?â

âYes, and the camp fellows are all singing and
playing. Don't you hear them? We are quite
alone. That's all I want, all I care for. Claire,
when you go away like this, and leave me, even
for a few minutes, Morocco is the most desolate
place in all the world, and I'm the most desolate
vagabond in it.â

He put his arm round her. The terrific glow
from the fire played over her face, danced in the
deep folds of her djelabe, shone in her eyes, showered
a cloud of gold and red about her hair. For
she had let her hood fall down on her shoulders.
She attained to that fine and almost demoniacal
picturesqueness which glorifies even the most
commonplace smith when you see him in his forge
by night. Her cheeks were suffused with scarlet,
as if she had suddenly painted them to go on
the stage. Yet she shivered again as Renfrew
spoke.

âYou should not have left the fire,â he said.
âAnd yet the wind is warm.â

âIt can't be. But it's not the wind, it's the
darkness that has chilled me.â

âOr is it the loneliness?â he asked, tenderly.
âFor you have been alone as well as I, and nothing
on earth makes one so cold as solitude.â

[69]

âI scarcely ever feel alone, Desmond,â she said.

And, as she spoke, she cast a glance behind her
into the darkness from which she had just come.
Renfrew noticed it.

âYou have been alone?â he asked hastily.
Then he checked himself with an ashamed laugh.

âWhat a fool I am,â he exclaimed.

He clasped her more closely.

âA fool, because I'm so desperately in love with
you, Claire,â he said, rushing on his confession
with the swiftness of alarmed bravery. âLook
here, I want to tell you something. You must
put everything I do, everything I am, down to the
account of my love,—shyness, anger, abruptness,
violence,—everything, Claire. My love's responsible.
It does play the devil with an ordinary man
when he's given his very soul to—to a woman
like you, to a great woman. It keeps him back
when he ought to go on, and sends him on when
he ought to stay quiet, and makes him jealous of
stones and—and savages.â

âSavages, Desmond?â

Renfrew's face was scarlet. He put up his hand
before it and muttered:—

âThis fire's scorching. Yes, Claire, of savages.
Didn't you find that out this afternoon,
when we were in Tetuan? But of course you
couldn't. You couldn't know you'd married
such an infernal lunatic.â

He broke off. She was watching him with a
[70]

close attention, and her body had ceased to tremble
under his arm.

âGo on, Desmond.â

âYou want me to tell you the sort of man
you've married?â

âI want you to tell me what you mean.â

âThen I will. Claire, this afternoon I took
you away from that snake-charming chap because—well,
because you watched him as if he fascinated
you.â

âOh!â

âOf course I knew why. His performance
was clever, and he was picturesque in his way,
although, to be sure, it was all put on, as far as
that goes.â

âLike my stage performances, Desmond.â

âClaire,â he said hotly. âHow can you?â

âThat man acts far better than I do—if he
acts at all.â

âWas that why he interested you so much?â

âIn what other way could he interest me?â

Renfrew kicked at one of the blazing logs and
sent up a shower of red-hot flakes.

âWell, there was your dream, Claire.â

âYes, there was that.â

âIt was curious, coming just before we saw the
fellow. And you say the two men were alike.â

âI did not say alike. I said the same.â

âHow could that be?â

âHow can a thousand things be? Yet we
[71]

cannot deny them when they are, any more than
we can deny that we feel an earthly immortality
within us and yet crumble into dust. In sleep I
saw that man. I saw his snake. I heard him
play.â

âYes, Claire, I know. It's damned strange.â

Renfrew's forehead was wrinkled in a meditative
frown.

âBut, after all, what's a dream?â he exclaimed.
âA vagary of a sleeping brain. And in your
dream you wouldn't go to that beggar, Claire.â

âNo. I wouldn't go, and so I died.â

âIt all means nothing—nothing at all.â

She looked at him gravely.

âI wonder whether there are things in life that
we are compelled to do, Desmond,â she said. âI
sometimes think there must be. How otherwise
can a thousand strange events be accounted for,
especially things that women do?â

âI don't know,â he muttered, staring at her
anxiously in the firelight.

âEvery one acknowledges the irresistible power
of physical force over physical weakness. Some
day, perhaps, when the world has grown a little
older, we shall all understand that the power of
mental force is precisely similar, and can as little
be resisted. What's that?â

Renfrew felt that she was suddenly alert. Her
thin form grew hard and quivering, like the body
of a greyhound about to be let loose on a hare.
[72]

He heard nothing except a sound of music from
the darkness, and the gentle rustle of the wind.

âI hear nothing,â he said. âWhat was it—a
cry?â

âNo, no!â

âWhat then?â

âOh, Desmond—hush!â

He was obedient, and strained his ears, wondering
what Claire had heard. The fire was at last
beginning to die down, for the flames had devoured
the masses of dry twigs, and had now nothing to
feed upon except the heavy logs. So the darkness
drew a little closer round the camp, as if the night
expanded noiselessly. One of the porters, or,
perhaps, one of the soldiers, was playing a queer
little air upon a pipe over and over again. It was
plaintive and very soft. But the tone of the instrument
was strangely penetrating, and the wind
carried it along over the plain, as if anxious to bear
it to the sea, that the cave men might hear it, and
the sailors bearing up for the Spanish coast. Was
Claire listening to this odd little tune? Renfrew
wondered. There seemed no other sound. She
was moving uneasily now, as if an intense restlessness
had taken hold of her. And she turned her
head away from him and gazed into the night.

Presently she put her hand on Renfrew's arm,
which was still round her waist, and tried to remove
it. But he would not yield to her desire.
He only held her closer, and again—he could
[73]

not tell why—the smouldering jealousy began to
flare up in his heart.

âNo, Claire,â he said, in answer to her movement,
âyou are mine. You have given yourself
to me. I alone have the right to keep you, to
hold you close—close to my heart.â

âCan you keep me always, Desmond?â she
said, suddenly turning on him with a sort of fierce
excitement.

She looked into his eyes as if she would search
the very depths of his soul for strength, for power.

âYou have the right. Yes; but that is nothing—nothing.â

âNothing, Claire?â

âYou must have the strength, Desmond. That
is everything.â

There was a look almost of despair in her face.
She threw herself against him as if moved by a
sudden yearning for protection, and put her arms
round his shoulders.

The hidden Moor was still playing the same
monotonous little tune, an African aria, as wild
as a bird that flies over the desert, or a cloud that
is driven across the sky above a dangerous sea. It
was imaginative, and, as all tunes seem to have a
shape, this melody was misshapen and yet delicious,
like a twisted tangled creature that has the
smile of a sweet woman, or the eyes of an alluring
child. In its plaintiveness there was the atmosphere
of solitary places. And there was a sound
[74]

of love in it, too, but of a love so uncivilised as to
be almost monstrous. Some earth man of a dead
age might have sung it to his mate in a land where
the sun looked down on things primeval. It might
have caught the heart of maidens very long ago,
before they learned to think of passion as the twin
of law, and to regard a kiss as the seal set upon
the tape of matrimony. The queer sorrow of it
could hardly have moved any eyes to tears. Yet
few women could have heard it without a sense of
desolation. It ran through the darkness as cold
water runs in the black shadow of a forest, a
trickle of sound as thin and persistent as the cry
of a wild creature in the night.

Renfrew thrilled under the touch of Claire's hand.

âYou can give me the strength every woman
seeks in the man she yields herself up to,â he
said.

âHow?â

âBy loving me.â

âAh, yes. But the strength must not come,
however subtly, from the woman. No—no.â

Again she leaned away from him, with her face
turned towards the darkness. Tremors ran through
her, and her hands dropped almost feebly from
Renfrew's shoulders, as the hands of an invalid fall
away, and down, after an embrace.

âOh, no,â she reiterated, and her voice was
almost a wail. âIt must be there, in the man,
part of him, whether he is with the woman in the
[75]

night, or alone—far off—in the jungle, or in
the—the desert. He must have the strange
strength that comes from solitude. Where can the
men of our country find that now?â

âThey find strength in the clash of wills,
Claire, and in the battles of love.â

âMost of them never find it at all,â she said,
with a sort of sullen resignation. âAnd most of
the women do not want it, or ask for it, or know
what it is. The danger is when some accident
or some fate teaches them what it is. Then—then—â

She stopped, and glanced at Renfrew suspiciously,
as if she had so nearly betrayed a secret
that he might, nay, must have guessed it.

âWhat do you mean? Then they seek it
away from—?â

âWhere they know they will find it,â she said,
almost defiantly.

Renfrew's face grew cold and rigid.

âWhat are you saying to me, Claire?â

âWhat is true of some women, Desmond.â

He was silent. Pain and fear invaded his
heart; and, by degrees, the little tune played by
the Moor seemed to approach him, very quietly,
and to become one with this slow agony. Music,
among its many and terrible powers, numbers one
that is scarcely possessed as forcibly by any other
art. It can glide into a man and direct his
emotions as irresistibly as science can direct the
[76]

flow of a stream. It can penetrate as a thing
seen cannot penetrate. For that which is invisible
is that which is invincible. And this tune
of the Moor, while it added to Renfrew's distress,
touched his distress with confusion and bewilderment.
At first he did not realise that the music
had anything to do with his state of mind, or with
the growing turmoil of his heart and brain; but
he felt that something was becoming intolerable to
him, and pushing him on in a dangerous path.
He thought it was the statement of Claire; and,
for the first time in his life, he was stirred by an
anger against her that was horrible to him. He
released her from his arm.

âHow dare you say that to me?â he asked.
âDo you understand what your words imply, that—Good
God!—that women are like animals,
creatures without souls, running to the feet of the
master who has the whip with the longest, the
most stinging lash? Why, such a creed as yours
would keep men savages, and kill all gentleness out
of the world. Curse that chap! That hideous
music of his—â

He had suddenly become aware that the Moor's
melody added something to his torment. At his
last exclamation, the sullen look in Claire's pale
face gave way to an expression of fear and of
startling solicitude.

âDesmond, you are putting a wrong interpretation
on what I said,â she began hastily.

[77]

But he was excited, and could not endure any
interruption.

âAnd you imply a degrading immorality as a
prevailing characteristic of women too,â he went
on, âthat they should leave their homes, deny
their obligations, because they find elsewhere—away,
out in some dark place with a blackguard—a
powerful will to curb them and keep them
down, like—why, like these wretched women all
round us here in this country,—the women we
saw in Tetuan only to-day, veiled, hidden, loaded
with burdens, worse off than animals, because
their masters doubt them, and would not dream of
trusting them. Claire, there's something barbarous
about you.â

He spoke the words with the intonation of one
who thinks he is uttering an insult. But she
smiled.

âIt's the something barbarous about me that
has placed me where I am,â she said, with a cold
pride. âIt is that which civilisation worships in
me, that which has set me above the other women
of my time. It is even that which has made you
love me, Desmond, whether you know it or not.â

He looked at her like a man half dazed.

âI frighten the dove-cotes. I can make men
tremble by my outbursts of passion, and women
faint because I am sad; and even the stony-hearted
sob when I die. And I can make you love me,
Desmond. Yes, perhaps I am more barbarous
[78]

than other women. But do you think I am sorry
for it? No.â

âSome day you may be, Claire.â

He spoke more gently. The wonder and worship
he had for this woman stirred in him again.
While she had been speaking, she had instinctively
risen to her feet, and she stood in the dull red
glow of the waning fire, looking down at him as if
he were a creature in a lower world than the one
in which she could walk at will.

âI shall never choose to be sorry,â she said,
âwhatever my fate may be. To be sorry is to
be feeble, and to be feeble is to be unfit to live,
and unfit to die. Never, never think of me as
being sorry for anything I have done, or may do.
Never deceive yourself about me.â

A great log, eaten through by a flame at its
heart, broke gently asunder on the summit of the
heaped wood. One half of it, red-hot, and alive
with multitudes of flickering fires, gold, primrose,
steel-blue, and deep purple, dropped and fell at
Claire's feet. She glanced down at it, and at
Renfrew.

âMy deeds may burn me up,â she said, âas
those coloured fires burn up that wood, until it is
no longer wood but fire itself. They shall never
drench me with wretched, contemptible tears.â

He got up; and, when he was on his feet, he
seemed to hear the incessant music more clearly,
blending with the words of Claire. The notes
[79]

were like hot sparks falling on him. He winced
under them, and looked round almost wildly.
Then, without speaking, he hurried away in the
darkness to the place where the soldiers were feasting,
and the men of the camp were holding their
fantasia. Claire divined why he went. She
started a step forward as if to try and stop him;
but his movement had been so abrupt that she was
too late. She had to let him go. Her hands fell
at her sides, and she waited by the dying fire in the
attitude of one who listens intently. The soft
melody of that hidden and persistent musician
wailed in her ears, on and on. It came again and
again, never ceasing, never altering in time. And
its influence upon Claire was terrible as the influence
of the dream music in the valley beneath
the Kasbar. She longed to go to it. She seemed
to belong to it,—to be its possession, and to have
erred when she separated herself from it. In the
darkness it was awaiting her, and it sent out its
crying voice in the night as a message, as a summons
soft, clear, and quietly determined. She
clenched her hands as she stood by the fire. She
strove to root her feet in the ground. If there had
been anything to cling to just then, she would
have stretched forth her arms and clung to it, resisting
what she loved from fear of the future. But
there was nothing. And she thought of the children
and of the Pied Piper. But they were legendary
beings of a fable long ago. And she thought
[80]

of Renfrew and of his love. But that seemed
nothing. That could not keep her. He was a
pale phantom, and her career was a handful of dust,
and her name was as the name graven upon a
tomb, and her life was but as a gift to be offered to
an unknown destiny,—while that melody called
to her. Had any one seen her then in the glow of
the firelight, she would have seemed to him terrible.
For suddenly she let the djelabe of Absalem slip
from her shoulders to the ground. And, in the
fiercely flickering light, that makes all things and
people assume unearthly aspects, her thin figure in
its white robe looked like the white body of a
serpent, erect and trembling, under the influence of
the charmer. But the melody grew softer and
softer, more faint, more dreamy in the darkness.
Presently it ceased. As it did so, Claire drew
a deep breath, lifted her head like one released
from a thraldom, and turned her face towards the
camp.

Almost directly she saw Renfrew returning
towards her. He looked puzzled.

âIt wasn't any of the men playing,â he said
to her.

âNo?â

Claire bent, caught up the djelabe and drew it
over her.

âI went to them, and found them listening to
some story Absalem was telling. They were all
gathered close round him, huddled up together in
[81]

the dark. And the piping came from quite another
direction—not from the soldiers either. It
must have been some vagabond out of Tetuan. I
was just going to make a search for him, when the
noise stopped. He must have heard me coming.â

He still looked disturbed and angry, and this
break in their conversation was final. It seemed
impossible to take up the thread of it again. They
stood together watching the fire fade away till it
was a faint glow almost level with the ground.
Then at last Renfrew spoke, in a voice that was
almost timid.

âClaire,â he said.

âYes,â she answered out of the dull twilight
that would soon be darkness.

âIf I have said anything to-night to hurt you,
don't think of it, don't remember it. I don't
know—I don't seem to have been like myself
to-night. I believe that cursed music irritated me,
so ugly, and so monotonous; it got right on my
nerves, I think.â

âDid it?â

âWithout my knowing it.â

He felt for one of her hands and clasped it.

âYes, dear. We both said more than we meant.
Didn't we?â

Claire did not assent; but she let her hand
lie in his. That satisfied him then, although afterwards
he remembered her silence. Soon the fire
was dead; and they said good-night in the wind,
[82]

which seemed colder because there was no more
light.

Renfrew went to his tent, undressed, and got
into bed. The wind roared against the canvas.
But the pegs had been driven stoutly into the
ground by the porters, and held the cords fast.
He felt very tired and depressed, and thought he
would not fall asleep quickly. But he soon began
to be drowsy, and to have a sense of dropping into
the very arms of the tempest, lulled by its noise.
He slept for a time. Presently, however, and
while it was still quite dark, he woke up. He
heard the wind as before, but was troubled by an
idea that some other sound was mingling with it,
some murmur so indistinct that he could not decide
what it was, although he was aware of it.
He sat up and strained his ears, and wished the
wind would lull, if only for a moment, or that this
other sound—which had surely been the cause of
his waking—would increase, and stand out distinctly
in the night. And, at last, by dint of listening
with all his force, Renfrew seemed to himself
to compel the sound to greater clearness. Then
he knew that somewhere, far off perhaps in the
wind, the player on the pipe reiterated his soft and
stealthy music. It was swept on the tempest like
a drowning thing caught in a whirlpool. It was so
faint as to be almost inaudible. But in all its
weakness it retained most completely its character,
[83]

and made the same impression upon Renfrew as
when it was near and distinct. It irritated and it
repelled him. And, with an angry exclamation, he
flung himself down and buried his head in the
pillow, stopping his ears with his hands.

With daylight the camp was in a turmoil.
Claire was gone. Her bed had not been slept in.
She had not undressed. She had not even taken
off Absalem's djelabe. At least it could not be
found. Renfrew, frantic, almost mad with anxiety,
explored the plain, rode at a gallop to the gate of
the city, called upon the Governor of Tetuan
to help him in his search, and summoned the
Consul to his aid in his despair. Every effort was
made to find the missing woman; but no success
crowned the quest, either at that time, or afterwards,
when weeks became months, and months grew into
years. A great actress was lost to the world.
His world was lost to Renfrew. He rode back at
last one day to the villas of Tangier, bent down
upon his horse, broken, alone. In his despair he
cursed himself. He accused himself of cruelty to
Claire that night beside the African fire, when he
had been roused to a momentary anger against her.
He even told himself that he had driven her away
from him. But other men, who had known Claire
and the strangeness of her caprices, said to each
other that she had got tired of Renfrew and given
him the slip, wandering away disguised in the djelabe
[84]

of a Moor, and that some fine day she would turn
up again, and re-appear upon the stage that had seen
her glory.

Later on, when Renfrew at last, after long searching,
came hopelessly back to England, so changed
that his friends scarcely recognised him, he was
sometimes seized with strange and terrible thoughts
as he sat brooding over the wreck of his love. He
seemed to see, as in a pale vision of flame and
darkness, a little dusky Moorish boy bending to
smell at a withered sprig of orange flower, and to
remember that once—how long ago it seemed—Claire
had wished to kiss that boy as a Moorish
woman might have kissed him. And then he saw
a veiled figure, that he seemed to know even in
its deceitful robe, bend down to the boy. And the
vision faded. At another time he would hear the
little tune that had persecuted him in the night.
And then he recalled the music of Claire's dream,
and the melody that charmed the snakes; and he
shuddered. For the miracle man had never been
seen in Tetuan since the day when Claire had
watched him in the Soko. Nor could Renfrew
ever find out whither he had wandered.

Very long afterwards, however,—although this
fact was never known to Renfrew,—two Russian
travellers in the Great Sahara desert witnessed one
evening, as they sat in their tent door, the performance
of a savage charmer of snakes who carried
[85]

upon his body three serpents,—one striped, one
black, one white. And the younger of them
noticed, and remarked to the other, that the charmer
wore half-way up the little finger of his left hand a
thin gold circle in which there was set a magnificent
black pearl.

[89]

A TRIBUTE OF SOULS

PRELUDE

The
matter of Carlounie, the village of Perthshire
in Scotland, is become notorious in the
world. The name of its late owner, his remarkable
transformation, his fortunate career, his
married life, the brooding darkness that fell
latterly upon his mind, the flaming deed that he
consummated, its appalling outcome, and the finding
of him by Mr Mackenzie, the minister of the
parish of Carlounie, sunk in a pool of the burn that
runs through a âdenâ close to his house—all
these things are fresh in the minds of many men.
It has been supposed that he had discovered a
common intrigue between his wife, Kate, formerly
an hospital nurse, and his tenant, Hugh Fraser of
Piccadilly, London. It has been universally thought
that this discovery led to the last action of his life.
The following pages, found among his papers, seem
to put a very different complexion on the affair,
although they suggest a mediÃ¦val legend rather than
a history of modern days. It may be added that careful
enquiries have been made among the inhabitants
of Carlounie, and that no man, woman, or child has
been discovered who ever saw, or heard of, the grey
traveller mentioned in Alistair Ralston's narrative.

I

THE STRANGER BY THE BURN

Can
a fever change a man's whole nature, giving
him powers that he never had before? Can he
go into it impotent, starved, naked, emerge from it
potent, satisfied, clothed with possibilities that are
wonders, that are miracles to him? It must be
so; it is so. And yet—I must go back to that
sad autumn day when I walked beside the burn.
Can I write down my moods, my feelings of that
day and of the following days? And if I can,
does that power of pinning the butterfly of my soul
down upon the board—does that power, too, bud,
blossom from a soil mysteriously fertilised by illness?
Formerly, I could as easily have flown in
the air to the summit of cloud-capped Schiehallion
as have set on paper even the smallest fragment of
my mind. Now—well, let me see, let me still
further know my new, my marvellous self.

Yes, that first day! It was Autumn, but only
early Autumn. The leaves were changing colour
upon the birch trees, upon the rowans. At dawn,
mists stood round to shield the toilet of the rising
sun. At evening, they thronged together like a
pale troop of shadowy mutes to assist at his departure
to the under world. It was a misty season,
through which the bracken upon the hillsides of
[91]

my Carlounie glowed furtively in tints of brown
and of orange; and my mind, my whole being,
seemed to move in mists. I was just twenty-two,
an orphan, master of my estate of Carlounie, a
Scotch laird, and my own governor. And some
idiots envied me then, as many begin to envy me
now. I even remember one ghastly old man who
clapped me on the shoulder, and, with the addition
of an unnecessary oath, swore that I was âa lucky
youngster.â I, with my thin, chÃ©tif body, my
burning, weakly, starved, and yet ambitious soul—lucky!
I remember that I broke into a harsh
laugh, and longed to kill the babbling beast.

And it was the next day, in the afternoon,
that I took that book—my Bible—and went
forth alone to the long den in which the burn
hides and cries its presence. Yes, I took Goethe's
âFaust,â and my own complaining spirit, and went
out into the mist with my misty, clouded mind.
My cousin Gavin wanted me to go out shooting.
He laughed and rallied me upon my ill-luck on the
previous day, when I had gone out and been the
joke of my own keepers because I had missed
every bird; and I turned and railed at him, and
told him to leave me to myself. And, as I went, I
heard him muttering, âThat wretched little fellow!
To think that he should be owner of Carlounie!â
Now, he sings another tune.

With âFaustâ in my hand, and hatred in my
heart, I went out into the delicately chilly air,
[92]

down the winding ways of the garden, through
the creaking iron gateway. I emerged on to the
wilder land, irregular, grass-covered ground, strewn
with grey granite boulders, among which coarse,
wiry ferns grew sturdily. The blackfaced sheep
whisked their broad tails at me as I passed, then
stooped their ever-greedy mouths to their damp
and eternal meal again. I heard the thin and
distant cry of a hawk, poised somewhere up in the
mist. The hills, clothed in the death-like glory of
the bracken, loomed around me, like some phantom,
tricked-out procession passing through desolate
places. And then I heard the voice of the
burn—that voice which is even now for ever in
my ears. To me that day it was the voice of one
alive; and it is the voice of one alive to me now.
I descended the sloping hill with my lounging,
weak-kneed gait, at which the creatures who called
me master had so often looked contemptuously
askance. (I was often tired at that time.) I
descended, I say, until I reached the edge of the
tree-fringed den, and the burn was noisy in my
ears. I could see it now, leaping here and there
out of its hiding-place—ivory foam among the
dripping larches, and the birches with their silver
stems; ivory foam among the deep brown and
flaming orange of the bracken, and in that foam a
voice calling—calling me to come down into its
hiding-place, presided over by the mists—to come
down into its hiding-place, away from men: away
[93]

from the living creatures whom I hated because I
envied them, because they were stronger than I,
because they could do what I could not do, say
what I could not say. Gavin, Dr Wedderburn,
my tenants, the smallest farm boy, the grooms, the
little leaping peasants—I hated, I hated them all.
And then I obeyed the voice of the ivory foam, and
I went down into the hiding-place of the burn.

It ran through strange and secret places where
the soft mists hung in wet wreaths. I seemed to
be in another world when I was in its lair. On
the sharply rising banks stood the sentinel trees
like shadows, some of them with tortured and tormented
shapes. As I turned and looked straight
up the hill of the burn's descending course, the
mountain from which it came closed in the prospect
inexorably. A soft gloom hemmed us in—me
and the burn which talked to me. We two
were out of the world which I hated and longed to
have at my feet. Yes, we were in another world,
full of murmuring and of restful unrest; and now
that I was right down at the water-side, the ivory
face of my friend, the ivory lips that spoke to me,
the ivory heart that beat against my heart—so
sick and so weary—were varied and were changed.
As thoughts streak a mind, the clear amber of
the pools among the rocks streaked the continuous
foam that marked the incessant leaps taken by
the water towards the valley. The silence of
those pools was brilliant, like the pauses for con
[94]
templation
in a great career of action; and their
silence spoke to me, mingling mysteriously with
the voice of the foam. The course of the burn
is broken up, and attended by rocks that have
been modelled by the action of the running water
into a hundred shapes. Some are dressed in
mosses, yellow and green, like velvet to the touch,
and all covered with drops of moisture; some are
gaunt and naked and deplorable, with sharp edges
and dry faces. The burn avoids some with a
cunning and almost coquettish grace, dashes
brutally against others, as if impelled by an internal
violence of emotion. Others, again, it caresses
quite gently, and would be glad to linger by, if
Nature would allow the dalliance. And this army
of rocks helps to give to the burn its charm of infinite
variety, and to fill its voice with a whole gamut
of expression; for the differing shape of each
boulder, against which it rushes in its long career,
gives it a different note. It flickers across the
small and round stone with the purling cry of a
child. From the stone curved inwards, and with
a hollow bosom it gains a crooning, liquid melody.
The pointed and narrow colony of rocks which
break it into an intricate network of small water
threads, toss it, chattering frivolously, towards the
dark pool under the birches, where the trout play
like sinister shadows and the insects dance in the
sombre pomp of Autumn; and when it gains a
great slab that serves it for a spring-board, from
[95]

which it takes a mighty leap, its voice is loud and
defiant, and shrieks with a banshee of triumph—in
which, too, there is surely an undercurrent of
wailing woe. Oh, the burn has many voices
among the rocks, under the ferns and the birch
trees, in the brooding darkness of the mists and
shadows, between the steep walls of the green
banks that hem it in! Many voices which can
sing, when they choose, one song, again and again
and—monotonously—again!

So—now on this sad Autumn day—I was
with the burn in its hiding-place, cool, damp, fretful.
Carlounie sank from my sight. My garden,
the wilder land beyond, the moors on which yesterday
my incompetence as a shot had roused the contempt
of my cousin and of my hirelings—all were
lost to view. I was away from all men in this
narrow, tree-shrouded cleft of a world. I sat down
on a rock, and, stretching out my legs, rested my
heels on another rock. Beneath my legs the clear
brown water glided swiftly. I sat and listened to
its murmur. And, just then, it did not occur to
me that water can utter words like men. The
murmur was suggestive but definitely inarticulate.
I had come down here to be away and to think.
The murmur of my mind spoke to the murmur
of the burn; and, as ever, in those days, it
lamented and cursed and bitterly complained.

Why, why was I pursued by a malady of incompetence
that clung to both mind and body? (So
[96]

ran my thoughts.) Why was I bruised and beaten
by Providence? Why had I been given a soul
that could not express itself in the frame of a
coward, a weakling, a thin, nervous, dwarfish, almost
a deformed, creature? If my soul had corresponded
exactly to my body, then all might have
been well enough. I should have been more complete,
although less, in some way, than I now was.
For such a soul would have accepted cowardice,
weakness, inferiority to others as suitable to it, as a
right fate. Such a soul would never have known
the meaning of the word rebellion, would never
have been able to understand its own cancer of
disease, to diagnose the symptoms of its villainous
and creeping malady. It would never have aspired
like a flame, and longed in vain to burn clearly and
grandly or to flicker out for ever. Rather would
such a soul have guttered on like some cheap and
ill-smelling candle, shedding shadows rather than
any light, ignorant of its own obscurity, regardless
of the possibilities that teem like waking children
in the wondrous womb of life, oblivious of the contempt
of the souls around it, heedless of ambition,
of the trumpet call of success, of the lust to be
something, to do something, of the magic, of the
stinging magic of achievement. With such a soul
in my hateful, pinched, meagre, pallid body—I
thought, sitting thus by the burn—I might have
been content, an utterly low, and perhaps an
utterly satisfied product of the fiend creation.

[97]

But my soul was not of this kind, and so I was
the most bitterly miserable of men. God—or the
Devil—had made me ill-shaped, physically despicable,
with the malign sort of countenance that
so often accompanies and illustrates a bad poor
body. My limbs, without being actually twisted,
were shrunken and incompetent—they would not
obey my desires as do the limbs of other men.
My legs would not grip a horse. When I rode I
was a laughing-stock. My arms had no swiftness,
no agility, no delicate and subtle certainty. When
I tried to box, to fence, I was one whirling, jigging
incapacity. I had feeble sight, and objects presented
themselves to my vision so strangely that I
could not shoot straight. I, Alistair Ralston the
young Laird of Carlounie! When I walked my
limbs moved heavily and awkwardly. I had no
grace, no lightness, no ordinary, quite usual competence
of bodily power. And this was bitter, yet as
nothing to the Marah that lay beyond. For my
body was in a way complete. It was a wretch.
But when you came to the mind you had the real
tragedy. In many decrepit flesh temples there
dwells a commanding spirit, as a great God might
dwell—of mysterious choice—in a ruinous and
decaying lodge in a wilderness. And such a spirit
rules, disposes, presides, develops, has its own full
and superb existence, triumphing not merely over,
but actually through the contemptible body in
which it resides, so that men even are led to wor
[98]
ship
the very ugliness and poverty of this body, to
adore it for its power to retain such a mighty spirit
within it. Such a spirit was not mine. Had it
been, I might have been happy by the burn that
Autumn day. Had it been, I might never—But I
am anticipating, and I must not anticipate. I must
sit with the brown water rushing beneath the arch
of my limbs, and recall the horror of my musing.

In a manner, then, my soul matched my body.
It was feeble and incompetent too. My brain was
dull and clouded. My intellect was sluggish and
inert. But—and this was the terror for me!—within
the rank nest of my soul—my spirit—lay
coiled two vipers that never ceased from biting me
with their poisoned fangs—Self-consciousness
and Ambition. I knew myself, and I longed to
be other than I was. I watched my own incompetence
as one who watches from a tower. I
divined how others regarded me—precisely. The
blatant and comfortable egoism of a dwarf mind in
a dwarf body was never for one moment mine. I
was that terrible anomaly, an utterly incomplete and
incompetent thing that adored, with a curious wildness
of passion, completeness, competence. Nor
had I a soul that could ever be satisfied with a one-sided
perfection. My desires were Gargantuan.
When I was with my cousin Gavin, a fine all-round
sportsman, I longed with fury to be a good shot,
to throw a fly as he did, to have a perfect seat on
a horse. I felt that I would give up years of life
[99]

to beat him once in any of his pursuits. When I
was with Dr Wedderburn, my desires, equally intense,
were utterly different. He represented in
my neighbourhood Intellect—with a capital I.
A man of about fifty, minister of the parish of
Carlounie, he was astonishingly adroit as a controversialist,
astonishingly eloquent as a divine. His
voice was full of music. His eyes were full of
light and of the most superb self-confidence. He
rested upon his intellect as a man may rest upon a
rock. The power of his personality was calm and
immense. I felt it vehemently. I shook and
trembled under it. I hated and loathed the man
for it, because I wanted and could never possess
it. So, too, I hated my cousin Gavin for his possessions,
his long and sure-sighted eyes, great and
strong arms, broad chest, lithe legs, bright agility.
My body could do nothing. My soul could do
nothing—except one great thing. It could fully
observe and comprehend its own impotence. It
could fully and desperately envy and pine to be
what it could never be. Could never be, do I
say? Wait! Remember that is only what I
thought then as I sat upon the rock, and, with
haggard young eyes, watched the clear brown
water slipping furtively past between my knees.

My disease seemed to culminate that day, I
remember. I was a sick invalid alone in the mist.
Something—it might have been vitriol—was eating
into me, eating, eating its way to my very heart,
[100]

to the core of me. Oh, to be stunted and desire
to be straight and tall, to be dwarf and wish to be
giant, to be stupid and long to be a genius, to be
ugly and yearn to be in face as one of the shining
gods, to have no power over men, and to pine to
fascinate, hold, dominate a world of men—this
indeed is to be in hell! I was in hell that Autumn
day. I clenched my thin, weak hands
together. I clenched my teeth from which the
pale lips were drawn back in a grin; and I realised
all the spectral crowd of my shortcomings.
They stood before me like demons of the Brocken—yes,
yes, of the Brocken!—and I cursed God
with the sound of the burn ringing and chattering
in my ears. And I devoted Gavin, Doctor Wedderburn,
every man highly placed, every lowest
peasant, who could do even one of all the things
I could not do, to damnation. The paroxysm that
took hold of me was like a fit, a convulsion. I
came out of it white and feeble. And, suddenly,
the voice of the burn seemed to come from a long
way off. I put out my hand, and took up from
the rock on which I had laid it, âFaust.â And,
scarcely knowing what I did, I began mechanically
to read—to the dim rapture of the burn—

â
Scene III.—The Study. Faust (entering, with
the poodle).
â I began to read, do I say, mechanically?
Yes, it is true, but soon, very soon, the
spell of Goethe was laid upon me. I was in the
lofty-arched, narrow Gothic chamber, with that
[101]

living symbol of the weariness, broken ambition,
learned despair of all the ages. I was engrossed.
I heard the poodle snarling by the stove. I heard
the spirits whispering in the corridor. Vapour
rose—or was it indeed the mist from the mountains
among the birch trees?—and out of the
vapour came Mephistopheles in the garb of a
travelling scholar. And then—and then the
great bargain was struck. I heard—yes, I did,
I actually, and most distinctly, heard a voice—Faust's—say,
â
Let us the sensual deeps explore....
Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance, In the
rush and roll of circumstance.
â A pause; then the
Student's grave and astonished tones came to me:

Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum.
The
cloak was spread, and on the burning air Faust
was wafted to his new life—nay, not to his new
life merely, but to life itself. He vanished with
his guide in a coloured, flower-like mist. I
dropped my hand holding the book down upon the
cold rock by which the cold water splashed. It
felt burning hot to my touch. My head fell upon
my breast, and I had my dreams—dreams of the
life of Faust and of its glories, gained by this bargain
that he made. And then—yes, then it was!—the
voice of the burn, as from leagues away in
the bosom of this very mist, began to sing like a
fairy voice, or a voice in dreams, and in visions of
the night, â
If it was so then, it might be so now.
â
At first I scarcely heeded it, for I was enwrapt.
[102]

But the song grew louder, more insistent. It was
travelling to me from a far country. I heard it
coming: â
If it was so then, it might be so now
â—â
If
it was so then, it might be so now.
â How near
it was at last, how loud in my ears! And yet
always there was something vague, visionary about
it, something of the mist, I think. At length I
heard it with the attention that is of earth. I came
to myself, out of the narrow Gothic chamber in
which the genius of Goethe had prisoned me, and
I stared into the mist, which was gathering thicker
as the night began to fall. It seemed flower-like,
and full of strange and mysterious colour. I
trembled. I got up. Still I heard the voice of
the burn singing that monotonous legend, on, and
on, and on. Slowly I turned. I climbed the
bank of the den. The sheep scattered lethargically
at my approach. I passed through the creaking
iron gate into the garden. Carlounie was
before me. There was something altered, something
triumphant about its aspect. The voice of
the burn faded in a long diminuendo. Yet, even
as I gained the door of my house, and, before
entering it, paused in an attentive attitude, I heard
the water chanting faintly from the den—â
If it
was so then, it might be so now.
â ... As I came
into the hall, in which Gavin and Dr Wedderburn
stood together talking earnestly, I remember
that I shivered. Yet my cheeks were glowing.

[103]

From that moment not a day passed without
my visiting the burn. It summoned me. Always
it sang those words persistently. The sound of the
water can be very faintly heard from the windows
of Carlounie. Each day, at dawn, I pushed open
the lattice of my bedroom and hearkened to hear
if the song had changed. Each night, at moon-rise,
or in the darkness through which the soft and
small rain fell quietly, I leaned over the sill and
listened. Sometimes the wind was loud among
the mountains. Sometimes the silence was intense
and awful. But in storm or in stillness the burn
sang on, ever and ever the same words. At
moments I fancied that the voice was as the voice
of a man demented, repeating with mirthless frenzy
through all his years one hollow sentence. At
moments I deemed it the cry of a fair woman,
a siren, a Lorelei among my rocks in my valley.
Then again I said, âIt is a spirit voice, a voice from
the inner chamber of my own heart.â And—why
I know not—at that last fantasy I shuddered.
Even in the midnight from my window ledge I
leaned while the world slept and I heard the
mystic message of the burn. My visits to its bed
were not unobserved. One morning my cousin
Gavin said to me roughly, âWhy the devil are you
always stealing off to that ditchâ—so he called
the den that was the home of my voice—âwhen
you ought to be practising to conquer your infernal
deficiencies? Why, the children of your own
[104]

keepers laugh at you. Try to shoot straight, man,
and be a real man instead of dreaming and idling.â
I stared at him and answered, âYou don't understand
everything.â Once Dr Wedderburn, who
had been my tutor, said to me more kindly,
âAlistair, action is better for you than thought.
Leave the burn alone. You go there to brood. Try
to work, for work is the best man-maker after all.â

And to him I said, âYes, I know!â and flew
with a strong wing in the face of his advice. For
the voice of the burn was more to me than the
voice of Gavin, or of Wedderburn; and the mind
of the burn meant more to me than the mind of
any man. And so the Autumn died slowly, with
a lingering decadence, and shrouded perpetually in
mist. I often felt ill, even then. My body was
dressed in weakness. Perhaps already the fever
was upon me. I wish I could know. Was it
crawling in my veins? Was it nestling about my
heart and in my brain? Could it be that?...

Certainly during this period life seemed alien to
me, and I moved as one apart in a remote world,
full of the music of the burn, and full, too, of
vague clouds. That is so. Looking back, I know
it. Still, I cannot be sure what is the truth. In
the late Autumn I paid my last visit to the burn
before my illness seized me. The cold of early
Winter was in the air and a great stillness. It
was afternoon when I left the house walking slowly
with my awkward gait. My face, I know, was white
[105]

and drawn, and I felt that my lips were twitching.
I did not carry my volume of Goethe in my hand;
but, in its place, held an old book on transcendental
magic. The voice of the burn—yes, that
alone—had led me to study this book. So now
I took it down to the burn. Why? Had I the
foolish fancy of introducing my live thing of the
den to this strange writing on the black art? Who
knows? Perhaps the fever in my veins put the
book into my hand. I shivered in the damp cold
as I descended the steep ground that lay about the
water, which that day seemed to roar in my ears
the sentence I had heard so many days and nights.
And this time, as I hearkened, my heart and my
brain echoed the last words—â
It might be so
now.
â Gaining the edge of the burn, then in
heavy spate, I watched for a while the passage of
the foam from rock to rock. I peered into the
pools, clouded with flood water from the hills, and
with whirling or sinking dead leaves. And all
my meagre body seemed pulsing with those everlasting
words: âWhy not now?â I murmured
to myself, with a sort of silent sneer, too, at my
own absurdity. I remember I glanced furtively
around as I spoke. Grey emptiness, grey loneliness,
dripping bare trees through whose branches
the mist curled silently, cold rocks, the cold flood
of the swollen burn—such was the blank prospect
that met my eyes.

There was no man near me. There was no
[106]

one to look at me. I was remote, hidden in a
secret place, and the early twilight was already
beginning to fall. No one could see me. I
opened my old and ragged book, or, rather, let it
fall open at a certain page. Upon it I looked for
the hundredth time, and read that he who would
evoke the Devil must choose a solitary and condemned
spot. The burn was solitary. The burn
was condemned surely by the despair and by the
endless incapacities of the wretched being who
owned it. I had taken off my shoes and placed
them upon a rock. My feet were bare. My
head was covered. I now furtively proceeded to
gather together a small heap of sticks and leaves,
and to these I set fire, after several attempts. As
the flames at last crept up, the mist gathered more
closely round me and my fire, as if striving to warm
itself at the blaze. The voice of the burn mingled
with the uneasy crackle of the twigs, and a murmur
of its words seemed to emanate also from the
flames, two elements uniting to imitate the utterance
of man to my brain, already surely tormented
with fever. And now, with my eyes upon my
book, I proceeded to trace with the sharp point of
a stick in some sandy soil between two rocks a
rough Goetic Circle of Black evocations and pacts.
From time to time I paused in my work and
glanced uneasily about me, but I saw only the
mists and the waters.

At length my task was finished, and the time
[107]

had arrived for the supreme effort of my insane and
childish folly. Standing at Amasarac in the Circle,
I said aloud the formula of Evocation of the Grand
Grimoire, ending with the words âJehosua, Evam,
Zariat, natmik, Come, come, come.â

My voice died away in the twilight, and I stood
among the grey rocks waiting, mad creature that I
surely was! But only the rippling voice of the
burn answered my adjuration. Then I repeated the
words in a louder tone, adding menaces and imprecations
to my formula. And all the time the fire
I had kindled sprang up into the mist; and the
twilight of the heavy Autumn fell slowly round me.
Again I paused, and again my madness received
no satisfaction, no response. But it seemed to me
that I heard the browsing sheep on the summit of the
right bank of the gully scatter as if at the approach
of some one. Yet there was no stir of footsteps.
It must have been my fancy, or the animals were
merely changing their feeding ground in a troop, as
they sometimes will, for no assignable cause. And
now I made one last effort, urged by the voice of
the burn, which sang so loudly the words which had
mingled with my dream of Faust. I cried aloud the
supreme appellation, making an effort that brought
out the sweat on my forehead, and set the pulses
leaping in my thin and shivering body. â
Chavajoth!
chavajoth! chavajoth! I command thee by the
Key of Solomon and the great name Semhamphoras.
â

[108]

A little way up the course of the burn the dead
wood cracked and shuffled under the pressure of
descending feet. Again I heard a scattering of the
sheep upon the hillside. My hair stirred on my
head under my cap, and the noise of the falling
water was intolerably loud to me. I wanted to
hear plainly, to hear what was coming down to me
in the mist. The brush-wood sang nearer. In
the heavy and damp air there was the small, sharp
report of a branch snapped from a tree. I heard
it drop among the ferns close to me. And then
in the mist and in the twilight I saw a slim figure
standing motionless. It was vague, but less vague
than a shadow. It seemed to be a man, or a youth,
clad in a grey suit that could scarcely be differentiated
from the mist. The flames of my fire, bent
by a light breeze that had sprung up, stretched
themselves towards it, as if to salute it. And now
I could not hear any movement of the sheep; evidently
they had gone to a distance. At first,
seized with a strange feeling of extreme, almost
unutterable fear, I neither moved nor spoke. Then,
making a strong effort to regain control of my
ordinary faculties, I cried out in the twilight—

âWhat is that? What is it?â

âOnly a stranger who has missed his way on the
mountain, and wants to go on to Wester Denoon.â

The voice that came to me from the figure beyond
the fire sounded, I remember, quite young,
like the voice of a boy. It was clear and level,
[109]

and perhaps a little formal. So that was all. A
tourist—that was all!

âCan you direct me on the way?â the voice said.

I gave the required direction slowly, for I was
still confused, nervous, exhausted with my insane
practices in the den. But the youth—as I supposed
he was—did not move away at once.

âWhat are you doing by this fire?â he said.
âI heard your voice calling by the torrent among
the trees when I was a very long way off.â

Strangely, I did not resent the question. Still
more strangely, I was impelled to give him the true
answer to it.

âRaising the Devil!â he said. âAnd did he
come to you?â

âNo; of course not. You must think me
mad.â

âAnd why do you call him?â

Suddenly a desire to confide in this stranger,
whose face I could not see now, whose shadowy
form I should, in all probability, never see again,
came upon me. My usual nervousness deserted
me. I let loose my heart in a turbulent crowd of
words. I explained my impotence of body and of
mind to this grey traveller in the twilight. I dwelt
upon my misery. I repeated the cry of the burn
and related my insane dream of imitating Faust, of
making my poor pact with Lucifer, with the
Sphinx of mediÃ¦val terrors. When I ceased, the
boy's voice answered:—

[110]

âThey say that in these modern days Satan has
grown exigent. It is not enough to dedicate to
him your own soul; but you must also pay a
tribute of souls to the CÃ¦sar of hell.â

âA tribute of souls?â

âYes. You must bring, they say, the mystic
number, three souls to Satan.â

Suddenly I laughed.

âI could never do that,â I said. âI have no
power to seduce man or woman. I cannot win
souls to heaven or to hell.â

âBut if you received new powers, such as you
desire, would you use them to win souls, three
souls, to Lucifer?â

âYes,â I said with passionate earnestness. âI
swear to you that I would.â

Suddenly the boy's voice laughed.

â
Quomodo cecidisti
, Lucifer!â he said. âWhen
thou canst not contrive to capture souls for thyself!
But,â he added, as if addressing himself
once more to me, after this strange ejaculation,
âyour words have, perhaps, sealed the bond.
Who knows? Words that come from the very
heart are often deeds. For, as we can never go
back from things that we have done, it may be
that, sometimes, we can never go back from things
that we have said.â

On the words he moved, and passed so swiftly
by me into the twilight down the glen that I never
saw his face. I turned instinctively to look after
[111]

him; and, this was strange, it seemed that the
wind at that very moment must have turned with
me, blowing from, instead of towards, the mountain.
This certainly was so; for the tongues of
flame from my fire bent backward on a sudden and
leaned after the grey traveller, whose steps died
swiftly away among the rocks, and on the shuffling
dead wood and leaves of the birches and the oaks.

And then there came a singing in my ears, a
beating of many drums in my brain. I drooped
and sank down by the fire in the mist. My fever
came upon me like a giant, and presently Gavin
and Doctor Wedderburn, searching in the night,
found me in a delirium, and bore me back to
Carlounie.

II

THE SOUL OF DR WEDDERBURN

To
emerge from a great illness is sometimes dreadful,
sometimes divine. To one man the return
from the gates of death is a progress of despair.
He feels that he cannot face the wild contrasts of
the surprising world again, that his courage has
been broken upon the wheel, that energy is desolation,
and sleep true beauty. To another this
return is a marvellous and superb experience. It
is like the vivid re-awakening of youth in one who
is old, a rapture of the past committing an act of
[112]

brigandage upon the weariness of the present, a
glorious substitution of Eden for the outer courts
where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. It will
be supposed that I found myself in the first category,
a terror-stricken and rebellious mortal when
the fever gave me up to the world again. For the
world had always been cruel to me, because I was
afraid of it, and was a puny thing in it. Yet this
was not so. My convalescence was like a beautiful
dream of rest underneath which riot stirred.
A simile will explain best exactly what I mean.
Let me liken the calm of my convalescence to
the calm of earth on the edge of Spring. What a
riot of form, of scent, of colour, of movement, is
preparing beneath that enigmatic, and apparently
profound, repose. In the simile you have my
exact state. And I alone felt that, within this
womb of inaction, the child, action, lay hid, developing
silently, but inexorably, day by day. This
knowledge was my strange secret. It came upon
me one night when I lay awake in the faint twilight,
shed by a carefully shaded lamp over my
bed. Rain drummed gently against the windows.
There was no other sound. By the fire, in a
great armchair, the trained nurse, Kate Walters,
was sitting with a book—âJane Eyreâ it was—upon
her knees. I had been sleeping and now
awoke thirsty. I put out my hand to get at a
tumbler of lemonade that stood on a table by my
pillow. And suddenly a thought, a curious thought,
[113]

was with me. My hand had grasped the tumbler
and lifted it from the table; but, instead of bringing
my hand to my mouth I kept my arm rigidly
extended, the tumbler poised on my palm as upon
the palm of a juggler.

âHow long my arm is!â that was my thought,
âand how strong!â Formerly it had been short,
weak, awkward. Now, surely, after my illness,
my arms would naturally be nerveless, useless
things. The odd fact was that now, for the first
time in my life, I felt joy in a physical act. An
absurd and puny act, you will say, I daresay.
What of that? With it came a sudden stirring
of triumph. I lay there on my back and kept my
arm extended for full five minutes by the watch
that ticked by my bed-head. And with each
second that passed joy blossomed more fully
within my heart. I drank the lemonade as one
who drinks a glad toast. Yet I was puzzled.
âIs this—can this be a remnant of delirium?â
I asked myself. And beneath the clothes drawn
up to my chin I fingered my arm above the elbow.
It was the limb of a big, strong man. Surprise,
supreme astonishment forced an exclamation from
my lips. Kate got up softly and came towards
me; but I feigned to be asleep, and she returned
to the fire. Yet, peering under my lowered eyelids,
I noticed an expression of amazement upon
her young and pretty face. I knew afterwards
that it was the sound of my voice—my new voice
[114]
—that
drew it there. After that night my convalescence
was more than a joy to me, it was a
rapture, touched by, and mingled with something
that was almost awe. Is not the earth awe-struck
when she considers that Spring and Summer nestle
silently in her bosom? With each day the secret
which I kept grew more mysterious, more profound.
Soon I knew it could be a secret no
longer. The fever—it must be that!—had
wrought magic within my body, driving out weakness,
impotence, lassitude, developing my physical
powers to an extent that was nothing less than
astounding. Lying there in my bed, I felt the
dwarf expand into the giant. Think of it! Did
ever living man know such an experience before?
A bodily spring came about within me. And I
was already twenty-two years old before the fever
took me. My limbs grew large and strong; the
muscles of my chest and back were tensely strung
and knit as firmly as the muscles of an athlete.
I lay still, it is true, and felt much of the peculiar
vagueness that follows fever; but I was conscious
of a supine, latent energy never known before. I
was conscious that when I rose, and went out
into the world again, it would be as a man, capable
of holding his own against other strong, straight
men. That was a wonder. But it was succeeded
by a greater marvel yet.

One afternoon, while I was still in bed, Doctor
Wedderburn came to see me and to sit with me.
[115]

He had been away on a holiday, and, consequently,
had not visited me before, except once when I had
been delirious. The doctor was a short, spare
man, with a sharply cut brick-red face, lively and
daring dark eyes, and straight hair already on the
road to grey. His self-possession bordered on self-satisfaction;
and, despite his good heart and the
real and anxious sanctity of his life, he could seldom
entirely banish from his manner the contempt he
felt for those less intellectual, less swift-minded
than himself. Often had I experienced the stinging
lash of his sarcasm. Often had I withered
beneath one of his keen glances that dismissed me
from an argument as a profound sage might kick
an urchin from the study into the street. Often
had I hated him with a sick hatred and ground my
teeth because my mind was so clouded and so
helpless, while his was so lucent and so adroit. So
now, when I heard his tap on the door, his deep
voice asking to come in, a rage of self-contempt
seized me, as in the days before my illness. The
doctor entered with an elaborate softness, and
walked, flat-footed, to my bed, pursing his large
lips gently as men do when filled with cautious
thoughts. I could see he desired to moderate his
habitual voice and manner; but, arrived close to
me, he suddenly cried aloud, with a singularly full-throated
amazement.

âBoy—boy, what's come to you?â he called.
Then, abruptly putting his finger to his lips,
[116]

he sank down in a chair, his bright eyes fixed
upon me.

âIt's a miracle,â he said slowly.

âWhat is?â I asked with an invalid's pettishness.

âThe voice, too—the voice!â

I grew angry easily, as men do when they are
sick.

âWhy do you say that? Of course I've been
bad—of course I'm changed.â

âChanged! Look at yourself—and praise
God, Alistair.â

He had caught up a hand-mirror that lay on the
dressing-table and now put it into my hand. For
the first time since the fever I saw my face. It
was as it had been and yet it was utterly different,
for now it was beautiful. The pinched features
seemed to have been smoothed out. The mouth
had become firm and masterful. The haggard eyes
were alight as if torches burned behind them. My
expression, too, was powerful, collected, alert. I
scarcely recognised myself. But I pretended to see
no change.

âWell—what is it?â I asked, dropping the glass.

The doctor was confused by my calm.

âYour look of health startled me,â he answered,
sitting down by the bed and examining me keenly.

All at once I was seized by a strange desire to
get up an argument with this man, by whom I had
so often been crushed in conversation. I leaned
[117]

on my elbow in the bed, and fixing my eyes on
him, I said:—

âAnd why should I praise God?â

The doctor seemed in amazement at my tone.

âBecause you are a Christian and have been
brought back from death,â he replied, but with
none of his usual half-sarcastic self-confidence.

âYou think God did that?â

âAlistair, do you dare to blaspheme the Almighty?â

I felt at that moment like a cat playing with a
mouse. My lips, I know, curved in a smile of
mockery, and yet I will swear—yes, even to my
own heart—that all I said that day I said in pure
mischief, with no evil intent. It seemed that I,
Alistair Ralston, the dolt, the ignoramus, longed
to try mental conclusions with this brilliant and
opinionated divine. He bade me praise God. In
reply I praised—the Devil, and I forced him to
hear me. Absolutely I broke into a flood of words,
and he sat silent. I compared the good and evil
in the scheme of the world, balancing them in
the scales, the one against the other. I took up
the stock weapon of atheism, the deadly nature, the
deadly outcome of free will. I used it with skill.
The names of Strauss, Comte, Schopenhauer,
Renan, a dozen others, sprang from my lips. The
dreary doctrine of the illimitable triumph of sin, of
the appalling mistake of the permission granted it
to step into the scheme of creation, in order that its
[118]

presence might create a
raison d'Ãªtre
for the power
of personal action one way or the other in mankind—such
matters as these I treated with a vehement
eloquence and command of words that laid a spell
upon the doctor. Going very far, I dared to exclaim
that since God had allowed his own scheme to get
out of gear, the only hope of man lay in the direction
of the opposing force, in frank and ardent Satanism.

When at length I ceased from speaking, I
expected Dr Wedderburn to rise up in his wrath
and to annihilate me, but he sat still in his chair
with a queer, and, as I thought, puzzled expression
upon his face. At last he said, as if to himself:

âThe miracle of Balaam; verily, the miracle
of Balaam.â

The ass had indeed spoken as never ass spoke
before. I waited a moment, then I said:—

âWell, why don't you rebuke me, or why don't
you try to controvert me?â

Again he looked upon me, very uneasily I
thought, and with something that was almost fear
in his keen eyes.

âAh!â he said, âI have praised the Lord many
a morning and evening for his gift of words to me.
It seems others bestow that gift too. Alistairâ—and
here his voice became deeply solemn—âwhere
have you been visiting when you lay there,
mad to all seeming? In what dark place have
you been to gather destruction for men? With
whom have you been talking?â

[119]

Suddenly, I know not why, I thought of the
grey stranger, and, with a laugh, I cried:—

âThe grey traveller taught me all I have said
to you.â

âThe grey traveller! Who may he be?â

But I lay back upon the pillows and refused to
answer, and very soon the doctor went, still bending
uneasy, nervous eyes upon me.

In those eyes I read the change that had stolen
over my intellect, as in the hand-mirror I had read
the change that had stolen over my face. This
strange fever had caused both soul and body to
blossom. I trembled with an exquisite joy. Had
Fate relented to me at last? Was it possible that
I was to know the joys of the heroes? I longed
for, yet feared my full recovery. In it alone should
I discover how sincere was my transformation.
Doctor Wedderburn did not come to me again.
The days passed, my convalescence strengthened,
watched over by the pretty nurse, Kate Walters, a
fresh, pure, pious, innocent, beautiful soul, tender,
temperate, and pitiful for all sorrow and evil. At
length I was well. At length I knew, to some
extent, my new, my marvellous self. For I had,
indeed, been folded up in my fever like a vesture,
and, like a vesture, changed. I had grown taller,
expanded, put forth mighty muscles as a tree puts
forth leaves. My cheeks and my eyes glowed with
the radiance of strong health. I went out with my
cousin Gavin, whose estate marched with mine,
[120]

and I shot so well that he was filled with admiration,
and forthwith conceived a sort of foolish worship
for me—having a sportsman's soul but no
real mind. For the first time in my life I felt absolutely
at home on a horse, an unwonted skill came
to my hands, and I actually schooled Gavin's
horses over some fences he had had set up in a
grass park at the Mains of Cossens. The keepers
who had once secretly jeered at me were now at
my very feet. Their children looked upon me as
a young god. I rejoiced in my strength as a giant.
But I asked myself then, as I ask myself now—what
does it mean? The days of miracles are
over. Yet, is this not a miracle? And in a miracle
is there not a gleam of terror, as there is a
gleam of stormy yellow in the fated opal? But
here I leave my condition of body alone, and pass
on to the episode of Doctor Wedderburn, partially
related in the newspapers of the day and marvelled
at, I believe, by all who ever knew, or even set
eyes upon him.

The doctor, as I have said, did not come again
to see me, but I felt an over-mastering desire to
set forth and visit him. This was surprising, as
hitherto I had rather avoided and hated him. Now
something drew me to the Manse. At first I resisted
my inclination, but a chance word led me
to yield to it impulsively. Since my illness I had
not once attended church. Moved by a violent
distaste for the religious service, that was novel in
[121]

me, I had frankly avowed my intention of keeping
away. But, as I did not go to the kirk, I missed
seeing Dr Wedderburn; and I wanted to see him.
One day, leaning by chance against a stone dyke
in the Glen of Ogilvy, smoking a pipe and enjoying
the soft air of Spring as it blew over the rolling
moorland, I heard two ploughmen exchange a
fragment of gossip that made excitement start up
quick within me.

One said:—

âThe doctor's failin'. Man, he was fairly
haverin' last Sabbath, on and on, wi'out logic or
argeyment or sense.â

The other answered:—

âAy; he's greatly changed. He's no the man
he was. It fairly beats me; I canna mak' it out.
Ye've heard that—â And here he lowered his
voice and I could not catch his words.

I turned away from the wall, and walking
swiftly, set out for the Manse with a busy mind.
The afternoon was already late, and when I gained
a view of the Manse, a cold grey house standing a
little apart in a grove of weary-looking sycamores,
one or two lights smiled on me from the small
windows that stared upon the narrow and muddy
road. The minister's study was on the right of
the hall door; and, as I pulled the bell, I observed
the shadow of his head to dance upon the drawn
white blind, a thought fantastically, or with a palsied
motion, I fancied. The yellow-headed maidser
[122]
vant
admitted me with a shrunken grin, that suggested
wild humour stifled by achieved respect, and
I was soon in the minister's study. Then I saw
that Doctor Wedderburn was moving up and down
the room, and that his head was going this way and
that, as he communed in a loud voice with himself.
My entrance checked him as soon as he observed
me, which was not instantly, as, at first, his back
was set towards me and the mood-swept maid.
When he turned about, his discomposure was evident.
His gaze was troubled, and his manner, as
he shook hands with me, had in it something of the
tremulous, and was backward in geniality. We sat
down on either side of the fire, the tea service and
the hot cakes, loved of the doctor, between us. At
first we talked warily of such things as my recovery,
the weather, the condition of affairs in the
parish and so forth. I noticed that though the
doctor's eyes often rested with an almost glaring
expression of scrutiny or of surprise upon me, he
made no remark on the change of my appearance.
Nor did I on the change of his, which was startling,
and suggested I know not what of sorrow and
of the attempt to kill it with evil weapons. The
healthy brick-red of his complexion was now become
scarlet and full of heat; his mouth worked
loosely while he talked; the flesh of his cheeks
was puffed and wrinkled; his eyes had the clouded
and yet fierce aspect of the drunkard. But,
absurdly enough, what most struck me in him was
[123]

his abstinence from an accustomed act. He drank
his tea, but he ate no hot cakes. This was a
departure from an established, if trifling custom of
many years' standing, and worked on my imaginative
conception of what the doctor now was more
than would, at the first blush, appear likely, or even
possible. Instead of, as of old, feeling myself on
the worm level in his presence, I was filled with a
sense of pity, as I looked upon him and wondered
what subtle process of mental or physical development
or retrogression had wrought this dreary
change. Presently, while I wondered, he put his
cup down with an awkward and errant hand that
set it swaying and clattering in the tray, and said
abruptly:—

âAnd what have you come for, Alistair, eh?
what have you come for? To go on with what
you've begun? Well, well, lad, I'm ready for
you; I'm ready now.â

His voice was full of timorous irritation, his
manner of pitiable distress.

âI've thought it out, I've thought it all out,â he
continued; âand I can combat you, I can combat
you, Alistair, wherever you've got your fever-mind
from and your fever-tongue.â

I knew what he meant, and suddenly I knew,
too, why I had wanted so eagerly to come to the
Manse. My instinct of pity and of sympathy died
softly away. My new instinct of cruel rapture in
the ruthless exercise of my—shall I call them
[124]

fever-powers then?—woke, dawned to sunrise.
And Doctor Wedderburn and I fell forthwith into
an animated theological discussion. He was desperately
nervous, desperately ill at ease. His
argumentative struggles were those of a drowning
man positively convinced—note this,—that he
would drown, that no human or divine aid could
save him. There was, too, a strong hint of personal
anger in his manner, which was strictly undignified.
He fought a losing battle with bludgeons, and had
an obvious contempt for the bludgeons while in
the act of using them in defence or in attack.
And at last, with a sort of sharp cry, he threw
up his hands, and exclaimed in a voice I hardly
knew as his:—

âGod forgive you, Alistair, for what you're
doing! God forgive you—murderer, murderer!â

This dolorous exclamation ran through me like
cold water and chilled all the warmth of my intellectual
excitement.

âMurderer!â I repeated inexpressively.

Doctor Wedderburn sat in his chair trembling,
and looking upon me with despairing and menacing
eyes, the eyes of a man who curses but cannot
fight his enemy.

âOf a soul, of a soul,â he said. âThe poisoned
dagger?—doubt, the poisoned dagger—you've
plunged it into me, boy.â

Then raising his voice harshly, he exclaimed:

âCurse you, curse you!â

[125]

I was thunderstruck. I declare it here, for it is
true. I had defamed—and deliberately—the
doctor's dearest idols. I had driven my lance into
his convictions. I had blasphemed what he worshipped,
and had denied all he affirmed. But
that I had made so terrific an impression upon
his mind, his soul—this astounded me. Yet what
else could his passionate denunciation mean? Had
I, a boy, unused to controversy, unskilled in dialectics,
overthrown with my hasty words the faith
of this strong and fervent man? The thought
thrilled one side of my dual nature with triumph,
pierced the other with grim horror. My emotions
were divided and complex. As I sat silent, my
face dogged yet ashamed, the doctor got up from
his chair trembling like one with the palsy.

âAway from me—away,â he cried in a hoarse
voice, and pointing at the door. âI'll have no
more talk with the Devil, no more—no more!â

I had not a word. I got up and went, bending
a steady, fascinated look upon this old mentor of
mine, who now proclaimed himself my victim.
Arrived in the garden I found a thin moon riding
above the sycamores, and soft airs of Spring playing
round the doctor's habitation. Strangely, I
had no mind to begone from it immediately. I
crossed the garden bit and paced up and down
the country lane that skirted it, keeping an eye
upon the lighted window of the study. So I went
back and forth for full an hour, I suppose. Then
[126]

I heard a sound in the Spring night. The doctor's
hall door banged, and, peering through the privet
hedge that protected his meagre domain, I perceived
him come out into the air bareheaded. He
took his way to the small path that ran by the
hedge parallel to the lane, coming close to the place
by which I crouched, spying upon his privacy.
And there he paced, bemoaning aloud the ill fate
that had come upon him. I heard all the awful
complaining of this soul in distress, besieged by
doubts, deserted by the faith and hope of a lifetime.
It was villainous to be his audience. Yet, I could
not go. Sometimes the poor man prayed with a
desolate voice, calling upon God for a sign, imploring
against temptation. Sometimes—and this was
terrible—he blasphemed, he imprecated. And
then again he prayed—to the Devil, as do the
Satanists. I heard him weeping in his garden in
the night, alone under the sycamores. It was a
new agony of the garden and it wrung my heart.
Yet I watched it till the spectral moon waned, and
the trees were black as sins against the faded sky.

About this time, as I have said, his parishioners
began to mark the outward change of Dr Wedderburn
that signified the inward change in him. The
talking ploughmen had their fellows. All who sat
under the doctor were conscious of a difference, at
first vague, in his eloquent discourses, of a diminuendo
in the full fervour of his delivery and manner.
Gossip flowed about him, and presently there were
[127]

whisperings of change in his bodily habits. He
had been seen by night wandering about his garden
in very unholy condition, he who had so often
rebuked excess. Children, passing his gate in the
dark of evening, had endured with terror his tipsy
shoutings. A maidservant left him, and spread
doleful reports of his conduct through the village.
By degrees, rumours of our minister's shortcomings
stole, like snakes, into the local papers, carefully
shrouded by the wrappings that protect scandal-mongers
against libel actions. The congregation
beneath the doctor's pulpit dwindled. Women
looked at him askance. Men were surly to him,
or—and that was less kind—jocular. I, alone,
followed with fascination the paling to dusk of a
bright and useful career. I, alone, partially understood
the hell this poor creature carried within him.
For I often heard his dreary night-thoughts, and
assisted, unperceived of him, at the vigils that he
kept. The lamp within his study burned till dawn
while he wrestled, but in vain, with the disease of
his soul, the malady of his tortured heart.

One night in Summer time, towards midnight, I
bent my steps furtively to the Manse. It was very
dark and the weather was dumb and agitating.
No leaf danced, no grass quivered. Breathless,
dead, seemed the woods and fields, the ocean of
moorland, the assemblage of the mountains. I
heard no step upon the lonely road but my own,
and life seemed to have left the world until I came
[128]

upon the Manse. Then I saw the light in the doctor's
window, and, drawing near, observed that the
blind was up and the lattice thrust open among
the climbing dog-roses. Craftily I stole up the
narrow garden path, and, keeping to the side of
the window, looked into the room.

Doctor Wedderburn lounged within at the table
facing me. A pen was in his shaking hand. A
shuffle of manuscript paper was before him, and a
Bible, in which he thrust his fingers as if to keep
texts already looked out. Beyond the Bible was a
bottle, three-quarters full of whiskey, and a glass.
His muttering lips and dull yet shining eyes betokened
his condition. I saw before me a drunkard
writing a sermon. The vision was sufficiently
bizarre. A tragedy of infinite pathos mingled with
a comedy of hideous yet undeniable humour in the
live picture. I neither wept nor did I laugh. I
only watched, shrouded by the inarticulate night.
The doctor took a pull at the bottle, then swept
the leaves of the Bible....

âLet me die the death of the righteous,â he
murmured thickly. âThat's it—that's—that's—â
He wrote on the paper before him with a
wandering pen, then pushed the sheet from him.
It fell on the floor by the window.

âAnd let my last end be like his—Ah—ah!â

He drank again, and again wrote with fury.
How old and how wicked he looked, yet how sad!
He crouched down over the table and the pen
[129]

broke in his hand. A dull exclamation burst from
him. Taking up the bottle, he poured by accident
some of the whiskey over the open Bible.

âA baptism! A baptism!â he ejaculated, bursting
into laughter. âNow—now—let's see—let's
see.â

Again he violently turned the sodden leaves and
shook his head. He could not read the words,
and that angered him. He drank again and again
till the bottle was empty, then staggered out of the
room. I heard his frantic footsteps echoing in the
uncarpeted passage. Quickly I leaned in at the
window and caught up the sheet of paper that had
fallen to the floor. I held it up to the light.
Only one sentence writhed up and down over it,
repeated a dozen times; âThere is no God!â
While I read I heard the doctor returning, and I
shrank back into the night. He came stumbling
in, another whiskey bottle full in his hand. Falling
down in the chair he applied his lips to it and
drank—on and on. He was killing himself
there and then. I knew it. I wanted to leap
into the room, to stop him, yet I only watched
him. Why?—I want to know why—

At last he fell forward across the Bible with a
choking noise. His limbs struggled. His arms
shot out wildly, the table broke under him—there
was a crash of glass. The lamp was extinguished.
Darkness crowded the little room—and silence.

[130]

The papers recorded the shocking death of a
minister. They did not record this.

As I stole home that night, alone in my knowledge
of the doctor's appalling end, I heard going
before me light and tripping footsteps, those, apparently,
of some youth, not above three yards or so
from me. What wanderer thus preceded me, I
asked myself, with a certain tingling of the nerves,
shaken, perhaps, by what I had just seen? I
paused. The steps also paused. The person was
stopping too. I resumed my way. Again I heard
the tripping footfalls. Their sound greatly disquieted
me, yet I hurried, intending to catch up
the wayfarer. Still the steps hastened along the
highway, and always just before me. I ran, yet
did not come up with any person. I called
âStop! Stop!â There was no reply. Again I
waited. This man—or boy—(the steps seemed
young) waited also. I started forward once more.
So did he. Then a fury of fear ran over me, urging
me at all hazards to see in whose train I travelled.
We were now close to Carlounie. We
entered the policies. Yes, this person turned from
the public road through my gates into the drive,
and the footfalls reached the very house. I
stopped. I dared not approach quite close to the
door. With trembling fingers I fumbled in my
pocket, drew out my match-box, and, in the airless
night, struck a match. The tiny flame burned
steadily. I stretched my hand out, approaching it,
as I supposed, to the face of the stranger.

[131]

But I saw nothing. Only, on a sudden, I
heard some one hasten from me across the sweep
of gravel in the direction of the burn. And then,
after an interval, I heard the rush of startled sheep
through the night.

Just so had they scattered on the day I spoke
with the grey traveller by the waterside.

III

THE SOUL OF KATE WALTERS

It
is more than two years since I wrote down
any incident of my life. Two years ago I seemed
to myself a stranger. To-day an intimacy has
sprung up between myself and that observant, detached
something within me—that little extra
spirit which looks on at me, and yet is, somehow,
me. I am at home with my own power. I am
accustomed to my strength of personality. From
my fever I rose like some giant. Long ago my
world recognised the obedience it owed me. Long
ago, by many signs, in many ways, it taught me
the paramount quality of the emanation from my
soul that is called my influence. Yet sometimes,
even now, I seem to stare at myself aghast, to
turn cold when I am alone with myself. I am
seized with terrible fancies. I think of the voice
of the burn. I think of that childish Autumn
[132]

ceremony upon its bank among the mists and the
flying leaves. I think of the grey youth who
spoke with me in the twilight, and my soul is
full of questions. I muse upon the Wandering
Jew, upon Faust, upon Van Der Decken, upon
the monstrous figures that are legends, yet sometimes
realities to men. And then—and this is
ghastly—I say to myself, can it be that I, too,
shall become a legend? Can it be that my name
will be whispered by the pale lips of good men
long after I am dead? For, is there not a whirl
of white faces attending my progress as the whirl
of dead leaves attends the Autumn? Do I not
hear a faint symphony of despairing cries like a
dreadful music about my life? Is not my power
upon men malign? Boys with their hopes shattered,
men with their faiths broken, women with
their love turned to gall—do they not crowd
about my chariot wheels? Or is it my vain fancy
that they do? Here and there from the sea of
these beings one rises like a drowned creature
whom the ocean will not hide, stark, stiff, corpse-like.
Doctor Wedderburn was the first. Kate
Walters is the second—Kate Walters.

When my convalescence was well advanced she
left Carlounie and went back to Edinburgh. Some
months afterwards I heard casually that she was
working in an hospital there. But a year and a
half went by before I saw this girl again. Her
[133]

fresh, pure, ministering face had nearly faded from
my memory. Yet, she had attended intimately
upon my marvellous transformation from my death
of weakness to the life of strength. She had lifted
me in her girl's arms when I was nothing. Yes,
I had been in her arms then. How strange, how
close are the commonest relations between the
invalid and his nurse! When I chanced to meet
Kate again I had no thought of this. I had forgotten.
I came to Edinburgh on some business
connected with a mine discovered on my estate,
which seemed likely to make a great fortune for
me, and is already on the way to accomplishing
this first duty of a mine. My business done, I
stayed on at my hotel in Princes Street amusing
myself, for I had a multitude of friends in Edinburgh.
One of these friends was a medical student
attached to the hospital there, and he chanced to
invite me to go with him through the wards one
day. In one of the wards I encountered Kate
Walters, fresh, clear, calm as in the old Carlounie
days of my illness. She did not know me till I
recalled myself to her recollection; then she
looked into my face with the frankest astonishment.
My superb physique amazed her, although
she had attended upon its beginnings. I asked
after her life in the interval since our last meeting;
and she told me, with a delightful blush, that her
period of nursing was nearly concluded, as she
was engaged to be married to one Hugh Fraser, a
[134]

handsome, rich, and—strange thing this!—most
steadfast youth, who lived in England in the south,
and who loved her tenderly. I congratulated her,
and was on the point of moving away down the
ward with my friend when my eyes were caught
again by Kate's blushing cheeks and eyes alight
with the fiery shames and joys of love. How
beautiful is the human face when the torches of
the heart are kindled thus. How beautiful! I
paused, and, before I went, invited Kate to tea one
afternoon at my hotel. She accepted the invitation.
Why not? In our meeting the old chain of sympathy
between patient and nurse seemed forged
anew. We felt that we were indeed friends. As
we left the ward, my student chum chaffed me—I
let his words go by heedlessly. I was not in
love with Kate, but I was half in love with her
love for Hugh Fraser. It had such pretty features.
She came to tea and told me all about him; and
when she talked of him she was so fascinating that
I was loath to let her go. It was a sweet evening,
and, as Kate had not to be back at the hospital
early, I suggested that we should go for a stroll
on Carlton Hill, and talk a little more about Hugh
Fraser. The bribe tempted her. I saw that.
And she agreed after a moment's hesitation.

There is certainly an influence that lives only
out of doors and can never enter a house, or
exercise itself within four walls. There is a
wandering spirit in the air of evening, a soul
[135]

that walks with gathering shadows, speaks in the
distant hum of a city, and gazes through its twinkling
lights.
There is a grey traveller who journeys in
the twilight.
(What am I saying? To-day, as I
write, I am full of fancies.) I felt that, so soon as
Kate and I were away from the hotel, out under
the sky and amid the mysteries of Edinburgh, we
were changed. In a flash our intimacy advanced,
the sympathy already existing between us deepened.
Leaving the streets, we mounted the flight of steps
that leads to the hill, and joined the few couples
who were walking, almost like gods on some
Olympus, above the world. They were all obviously
lovers. I pointed this fact out to Kate, saying,
âHugh Fraser should be here, not I.â

She smiled, but scarcely, I thought, with much
regret. For the moment it seemed that a confidant
satisfied her; and this pleased me. I drew
her arm within mine.

âWe must not alarm the lovers,â I said. âWe
must appear to be as they are, or we shall carry a
fiery sword into their Eden.â

âYou seem to understand us very well,â she
answered with a smile. And she left her arm in
mine.

The mention of âusâ chilled me. It seemed
to set me outside a magic circle within which she,
Hugh Fraser, these people sauntering near us, like
amorous ghosts in the dimness, moved. I pressed
her arm ever so gently.

[136]

âTell me how lovers feel at such a time as
this,â I whispered, looking into her eyes.

From Carlton Hill at night one sees a heaving
ocean of yellow lights, gleaming like phosphorescence
on ebon waves. Towards Arthur's Seat,
towards the Castle, they rise; by Holyrood, by the
old town, they fall. That night I could fancy that
this sea of light spoke to me, murmured in my ear,
urging me to prosecute my will, ruthlessly stirring
a strange and, perhaps, evanescent romance in my
heart. I know that when I parted from Kate that
night I bent and kissed her. I know that she
looked up at me startled, even terrified, yet found
no voice to rebuke me. I know that I did not
leave Edinburgh, as I had originally intended, upon
the morrow. And I know this best of all—that
I had no ill-intent in staying. I was caught in a
net of impulse despite my own desire. I was held
fast. There are—I believe it unalterably now—influences
in life that are the very Tsars of the
empires of men's souls. They must be obeyed.
Possibly—is it so I wonder?—they only mount
upon their thrones when they are urgently invoked
by men who, as it were, say, âCome and rule over
us!â But once that invocation has been made,
once it has been responded to, there is never again
free will for him who has rashly called upon the
power he does not understand, and bowed before
the tyrant whose face he has not seen. I tremble
[137]

now, as I write; I tremble as does the bond slave.
Yet I neither speak with, nor hear, nor have sight
of, my master. Unless, indeed—but I will not
give way to any madness of the brain. No, no; I
do not hear, I do not see, although I am conscious
of, my Tsar, whose unemancipated serf I am.

I need not tell all the story of my soul's impression
that was stamped upon the soul of Kate
Walters. Perhaps it is old. Certainly it is sad.
I stamped deceit upon the nature which had not
known it, knowledge of evil where only purity had
been, satiety upon temperance. And, worst of all,
I expelled from this girl's heart love for a good
man who loved her, and planted, in its stead, passion
for a—must I say a bad, or may I not cry, a
driven man? And all this time Hugh Fraser
knew nothing of his sorrow, growing up swiftly
to meet him like a giant. Even now, while I
write these words, he knows nothing of it. As I
had carelessly taken possession of the mind, the
very nature of Dr Wedderburn, so now I took
possession of the very nature of Kate Walters.
My immense strength, my abounding physical
glory drew her—who had known me a puny
invalid—irresistibly. I won the doctor by my
mind; this girl, in the main, I think, by my body.
And when at length I tired of her slightly, the
woman, the gentle woman, sprang up a tigress. I
had said one night that, since I was obliged to go to
London, we must part for a while. I had added
[138]

that it was well Hugh Fraser lived in complete
ignorance of his betrayal.

âWhy?â Kate suddenly cried out.

âBecause—because it is best so. He and you—some
day.â

I paused. She understood my meaning. Instantly
the tigress had sprung upon me. The
scene that followed was eloquent. I learned what
lives and moves in the very depths of a nature,
stirred by the inexhaustible greed of passion,
twisted by passion's fulfilment, the ardent touched
by the inert. But upon that hurricane has followed
an immense and very strange calm. Kate
is almost cold to me, though very sweet. She has
acquiesced in my departure for town. She has
come to one mind with me on the subject of
Hugh Fraser. More, she has even written a letter
to him asking him to come to her, pressing forward
their marriage, and I am to be the bearer
of it to him. This is only a woman's whim. She
insists that I must see once the man who is to be
her husband.

So, after all, the tragedy of Dr Wedderburn is
not to be repeated. I—I shall not hear, stealing
along the steep and windy streets of Edinburgh, any—any
strange footsteps.

What is the awful fate that pursues me? A
year ago I left Edinburgh carrying with me the
letter which I understood to contain the request
[139]

of Kate Walters to her lover, Hugh Fraser, to
hasten on their marriage. As the train roared
southwards, I congratulated myself on my clever
management of a woman. I had, it is true,
stepped in between Kate and the calm happiness
she had been anticipating when I first met her in
the hospital ward. But now I had withdrawn.
And, I told myself, in time. All would be well.
This girl would marry the boy who loved her. She
would deceive him. He would never know that the
girl he married was not the girl he originally loved.
He would never perceive that a human being had
intervened between her and purity, truth, honour.
In this letter—I touched it with my fingers, congratulating
myself—Hugh Fraser would read the
summons to the future he desired, the future with
Kate Walters. His soul would rush to meet hers,
and surely, after a little while, hers would cease to
hold back. She would really once more be as she
had been. I forgot that no human soul can ever
retreat from knowledge to ignorance.

Hugh Fraser's rooms in London were in Piccadilly.
Directly I arrived in town I wrote him
a note, saying that I was from Edinburgh with
a message from Kate Walters for him. I explained
that she had nursed me through a severe
illness, and hoped I might have the pleasure of
making his acquaintance. In reply, I received a
most friendly note, begging me to call at an hour
on the evening of the following day.

[140]

That evening I drove in a hansom from the
Grand Hotel to Piccadilly, taking Kate's note with
me. I was conscious of a certain excitement, and
also of a certain moral exultation. Ridiculously
enough, I felt as if I were about to perform a sort
of fine, almost paternal act, blessing these children
with genuine, as opposed to stage, emotion. Yes;
I glowed with a consciousness of personal merit.
How incredible human beings are! Arrived at
Hugh Fraser's rooms, I was at once shown in.
How vividly I remember that first interview of
ours, the exact condition of the room, Hugh's
attitude of lively anticipation, the precise way in
which he held his cigarette, the grim, short bark
of the fox-terrier that sprang up from a sofa when
I came in. Hugh was almost twenty-four years
old, rather tall, slim, with intense, large, dark eyes—full
of shining cheerfulness just then—very
short, curling black hair, and fine, straight features.
His expression was boyish; so were his movements.
As soon as he saw me, he sprang forward
and gave me an enthusiastic welcome—for the
sake of Kate, I knew. He led me to the fire
and made me sit down. I at once handed him
my credentials, Kate's letter. His face flushed
with pleasure, and his fingers twitched with the
desire to tear it open, but he refrained politely,
and began to talk—about her, I confess. I
understood in three minutes how deeply he was
in love with her. I told him all about her that
[141]

might please him, and hinted at the contents of the
letter.

âWhat!â he exclaimed joyously. âShe wants
to hasten on our marriage at last. And she's kept
me off—but you know what girls are! She
couldn't leave the hospital immediately. She
swore it. There were a thousand reasons for
delay. But now—by Jove!â

His eyes were suddenly radiant, and he clutched
hold of my hand like a schoolboy.

âYou are a good chap to bring me such a letter,â
he cried.

âRead it,â I said, again filled with moral self-satisfaction,
vain, paltry egoist that I was.

âNo, no—presently.â

But I insisted; and at length he complied, enchanted
to yield to my importunity. He opened
the letter, and, as he broke the seal, his face was
like morning. Never shall I forget the change
that grew in it as he read. When he had finished
his face was like starless night. He looked old,
haggard, black, shrunken. I watched him with a
sensation that something had gone wrong with my
sight. Surely radiance was fully before me and
my tricked vision saw it as despair. Raising his
blank, bleak eyes from the letter, Hugh stared
towards me and opened his lips. But no sound
came from them. He frowned, as if in fury at his
own dumbness. Then at last, with a sharp shake of
his head sideways, he said in a low and dry voice:

[142]

âYou know what is in this letter, you say?â

âI—I thought so,â I answered, growing cold
and filled with anxiety.

âWell, read it, will you?â

I took the paper from his hand and read:—

â
Dear Hugh,
—Make the man who brings you this
letter marry me. If you don't, I will kill myself; for I
am ruined.
Kate.
â

I looked up at Hugh Fraser over the letter which
my hand still mechanically held near my eyes. I
wonder how long the silence through which we
stared lasted.

A month later I was married to Kate Walters!

IV

THE SOUL OF HUGH FRASER

It
may seem strange that my influence upon the
soul of Hugh Fraser should follow upon such a
situation as I have just described; but everything
connected with my life, since the day when I met
the grey boy by the burn, has been utterly strange,
utterly abnormal. My treachery, one would have
thought, must have led Fraser to hate me. I had
wrecked his happiness. I had done him the
deepest injury one man can do to another, and at
[143]

first he hated me. When he had wrung from me
a promise to marry Kate, he left me, and I did not
see him again until after the wedding. But then,
it seemed, he could not keep away from her. For
he forgave us the wrong we had done him; and,
after a while, wrote a friendly letter in which he
suggested that we should all forget the past.

âWhy should I not see you sometimes?â he
concluded. âI only wish you both good, there is
no longer any evil in my heart.â

Poor boy! It was to be, I suppose. The Tsar
of the empire of my soul set forth his edict, and
one winter day carriage wheels ground harshly
upon the gravel sweep, and Hugh Fraser was my
guest at Carlounie. I welcomed him upon the
very spot where those light footsteps paused that
black night of Doctor Wedderburn's dreary end.
And the faint sound of the burn mingled with our
voices in greeting and reply.

The boy was changed. He had aged, grown
grave, heavier in movement, fiercer in observation,
less ready in speech. But his manner was friendly
even to me, and it was plain to see that Kate still
had his heart. They met quietly enough, but a
flush ran from his cheek to hers as they touched
hands. Their voices quivered when they spoke
a commonplace of pleasure at the encounter. So
the wheels of Fate began slowly to turn on this
winter's day.

I must tell you that my fortunes had greatly
[144]

changed before Hugh Fraser came to Carlounie.
I was grown rich. My investments, my speculations
had prospered almost miraculously. The
mine I have spoken of was proving a gold mine to
me. All worldly things went well with me—all
worldly things, yes.

Now, I believe that all mighty circumstances
are born tiny, like children, at some given moment.
As a rule, they usually seem so insignificant, so
puny at the birth, that we take no heed of the fact
that they have come into being, and that, in process
of time, they will grow to might, perhaps to
horrible majesty. Only, when we trace events
backwards do we know the exact moment when
their first faint wail broke upon our mental hearing.
Generally this is so. But I affirm that I felt, at
the very time of its first coming, the presence of the
shadow, the tiny shadow of the events which I am
about to describe. I even said to myself, âThis
is a birthday.â

Among many improvements on my estate I had
built a new Manse, in which, of course, our new
minister lived. The old habitation of Doctor
Wedderburn stood empty and deserted among its
sycamores. One winter's day Hugh Fraser, Kate,
and I, in our walk, passed along the lane by the
now ragged privet hedge through which I had so
often observed the doctor's agonies. It was a
black and white day of frost, which crawled along
the dark trees and outlined twig and branch. The
[145]

air was misty, and distant objects assumed a mysterious
importance. Slight sounds, too, suggested
infinite activities to the mind. As we neared the
Manse, Hugh Fraser said to me:—

âWho lives in that old house?â

âNobody,â I replied.

Hugh glanced at me very doubtfully.

âNobody,â I reiterated.

âReally,â he rejoined. âBut the garden?â

âIs deserted.â

âHardly,â he exclaimed, pointing with his hand.
âLook!â

âYes,â said Kate, as if in agreement.

And she grew duskily pale.

I looked over the privet hedge, seeing only the
rank and frost-bitten grass, the wild bushes and
narrow mossy paths. Then I stared at my two
companions in silence. Their eyes appeared to
follow the onward movement of some object invisible
to me.

âThe old man makes himself at home,â Hugh
said. âHe has gone into the summer-house
now.â

âYes,â Kate said again.

There was fear in her eyes.

I felt suddenly that the air was very chill.

âThat house is unoccupied,â I repeated shortly.

We all walked on in silence. But, through our
silence, it certainly seemed to me that there came
a sound of some one lamenting in the garden.

[146]

A day or two later Fraser said to me:—

âWhy is that old house shut up?â

âWho would occupy it?â I said. âOf course,
if I could get a tenant—â

âI'll take it,â he rejoined quickly. âYou can
let me some shooting with it, can't you?â

âBut,â I began; and then I stopped. I had
an instinct to keep the old Manse empty, but I
fought it, merely because it struck me as unreasonable.
How seldom are our instincts unreasonable!
God—how seldom!

âI've been looking out for a shooting-box,â
Hugh said. âThat house would suit me
admirably.â

âAll right,â I answered. âI shall be very glad
to have you for a tenant.â

So it was arranged. When Kate heard of the
arrangement, I observed her to go very pale; but
she made no objection. Hugh Fraser rented the
house, furnished it, engaged servants, a gardener,
enlarged the stables, and took up his abode there.
Doctor Wedderburn's old study was now his den.
When I looked in at the window through which I
had seen the doctor die, I saw Fraser smoking, or
playing with his setters. I don't know why, but
the sight turned me sick.

My relations with Kate, of which I have said
nothing, were rather cold and distant. My passion,
such as it was, had died before marriage. Hers
seemed to languish afterwards. I believe that she
[147]

had really loved me, but that the shame of being
with me, after I had wedded her actually against
my will, struck this sentiment to the dust. When
one feeling that has been very strong dies, its place
is generally filled by another. Sometimes I fancied
that this was so with Kate, that the bitterness of
shattered self-respect gradually transformed her
nature, that a cruel frost bound the tendernesses,
the warm vagaries of what had been a sweet
woman's heart. But, to tell the truth, I did not
trouble much about the matter. My affairs were
prospering so greatly, my health was so abounding,
I had so much beside the mere egotism of brilliant
physical strength to occupy me, that I was heedless,
reckless—at first. Yet, I had moments of
a dull alarm connected with the dweller at the
Manse.

If Hugh Fraser changed as he read that fateful
letter in London, he changed far more after he
came to live at the Manse. And it seemed to me
that there were times when—how shall I put it?—when
he bore a curious, and, to me, almost intolerable
likeness to—some one who was dead. A
certain old man's manner came upon him at
moments. His body, in sitting or standing, assumed,
to my eyes, elderly and damnable attitudes.
Once, when I glanced in at the study window
before entering the Manse, I perceived him lounging
over a table facing me, a pen in his hand and
paper before him, and the spectacle threw all my
[148]

senses into a violent and most distressing disorder.
Instead of going into the house, as I had intended,
I struck sharply upon the glass at the window.
Fraser looked up quickly.

âWhat—what are you writing?â I cried out.

He got up, came to the window, and opened it.

âEh? What's the row, man?â he said. âWhy
don't you come in?â

I repeated my question, with an anxiety I strove
to mask.

âWriting? Only a letter to town,â he said,
looking at me in wonder.

âNot a sermon?â I blurted forth.

âA sermon? Good heavens, no. Why should
I write a sermon?â

âOh,â I replied, forcing an uneasy laugh.
âYou—you live in a Manse. Doctor Wedderburn
used to write his sermons in that room.â

That evening I remember that I said to Kate:

âDon't you think Fraser is getting to look very
old at times?â

âI haven't observed it,â she replied coldly.

Another curious thing. Very soon after he
took up his abode in the Manse, Fraser, who had
been a godly youth, became markedly averse to
religion. He informed us, with some excitement,
that he had changed his views, and seemed much
inclined to carry on an atheistical propaganda
among the devout people of the neighbourhood.
He declared that much evil had been wrought by
[149]

faith in Carlounie, and appeared to deem it as his
special duty to preach some sort of a crusade
against the accepted Christianity of the parish. I
began to combat his views, and once sought the
reason of his ardour and self-election to the post
of teacher. His answer struck me exceedingly.
He said:—

âWhy should I be the one to clear away these
senseless beliefs in phantasms, you say? Why,
because I suppose they were woven by my predecessor
in the Manse. Didn't the minister live and
die there? Do you know, Ralston, sometimes, as
I sit in that study at night, I have a feeling that
instead of turning to what is called repentance
when he died, the minister turned the other way,
recanted in his last hour the faith he had professed
all through his life, and expired before he could
give words to his new mind and heart. And then
I feel as if his influence was left behind him in
that room, and fell upon me and imposed on me
this mission.â

And as he spoke, he suddenly plucked at his
face with an old, habitual action of Doctor Wedderburn's
when excited. I scarcely restrained a
cry, and with difficulty forced myself to go out
slowly from his presence. Nevertheless, I felt
strongly impelled to fight against the atheism of
this boy, I who had formerly sown the seeds of
destruction in the soul of Doctor Wedderburn.
But it was as if my own act of the past rose and
[150]

conquered me in the present. I declare solemnly
it was so. Some emanation from the poor dead
creature's soul clung round that cursed place of his
doom, and, seizing upon the soul of Fraser, spread
tyranny from its throne. And whom did it take
first as its victim, think you? Kate, my wife.

Let our individual beliefs be what they may, one
thing we must all—when we think—acknowledge,
that the pulse which beats eternally in the
heart of life is reparation.

Kate, as I have said, was originally finely pure
and finely dowered with the blessings of faith in a
divine Providence, trust in the eventual redemption
of the world, hope that sin, sorrow, and sighing
would, indeed, flee away, and all mankind find
eternal and unutterable peace. In my worst moments
I had never tried to destroy this beauty of
her soul; and, in her fall, now repaired, she had
never abandoned her religion. It was, I know, a
haunting memory of the last moments of the doctor
that held me back from ever attacking the faith
of another. For myself, I did not think much of
my future beyond death. Life filled my horizon
then.

But now, after a short absence in England, during
which I left Kate at Carlounie, I returned to
find her infected with Fraser's pestilent notions.
She declined to go to the kirk, declaring that it was
better to act up to her real convictions than to set
what is called a good example to her dependants.
[151]

She and Fraser gloried openly in their new-found
damnation. I say damnation, for this was actually
how the matter struck me when I began carefully
to consider it. Men often see only what irreligion
really is and means when they find it existing in a
woman. I was appalled at this deadly fire flaring
up in the heart of Kate, and I set myself, at first
feebly, at length determinedly, to quench it and
stamp it out.

But I fought against my own former self. I
fought against the influence of the spectre that
surely haunted the Manse, and that spectre rose
originally from the very bosom of the burn at my
summons. Am I mad to think so? No, no. Oh,
the eternal horror that may spring from one wild
and lawless action, from the recital of one diabolic
litany! This was surely the strangest, subtlest
reparation that ever beat in the inexorable heart of
Life. Hugh Fraser was enveloped by the influence,
still retained mysteriously in his abode, of the soul
that was gone to its account. Through him it
seized upon Kate, and thus the mystic number was
made up, three souls were bound and linked together.
(I hear as I write the voice of the grey
traveller by the burn in the twilight.) And in the
first soul I had planted the seed of death, and so in
the second and in the third. Now, thrusting as it
were backward through Kate and Hugh Fraser, I
fought with a dead man, long ago, perhaps, wrapped
in pain unknown. But, as the influence of Doctor
[152]

Wedderburn had formerly—before the fever—dominated
my influence, so now it dominated my
influence from the tomb. Indeed, this man whom
I had destroyed had a drear revenge upon me.
There had been an interregnum when the doctor
wavered from Christianity to atheism. But that
had ceased to be. He died undoubting, a blatant
unbeliever. Hence, surely, his deadly power now.
He returned, as it were, to slay me. The spectre
at the Manse defied me.

Slowly I grew to feel, to know, all this. It did
not come upon me in a moment; for sometimes
my worldly affairs still occupied me. My glory of
health and of strength still delighted me. I was as
Faust—I was as Faust in his monstrous and damnable
youth. But there came a time when the
spectre at the Manse touched me with the hand of
Hugh Fraser. And then I rose up to battle with
it, trembling at the thought of the grey boy's
words at the thought of the CÃ¦sar of hell whose
tribute was three human souls.

Kate and I were taking tea one evening with
Fraser. We sat around the hearth, by which was
placed the table with the tea-service and the hot
cakes. Fraser began, as was his habit now, to discuss
religious subjects and to rail against the professors
of faith. Kate listened to him eagerly—a
filthy fire, so I thought, gleaming in her great eyes.
I was silent, watching. And presently it seemed
to me that Fraser's gestures in talking grew like the
[153]

dead gestures of the doctor. He threw his hands
abroad with the fingers divided in a manner of
Wedderburn's. He struck his knees sharply, and
simultaneously, with both his palms to emphasise
his remarks, a frequent habit of the dead man's. So
vehement was the similarity that I began presently to
feel that the doctor himself declaimed in the firelight,
and I was seized with a desire to combat effectively
his wicked, but forcible arguments. I broke in,
then, upon Fraser's tirade and cried the cause of
religion. He turned upon me, dealt with my pleas,
scattered my contentions—growing, I fancied, very
old and with the rumbling voice of age,—thrust at
me with the lances of sarcasm, sore belaboured me
into silence and mute fury. And all the time Kate
sat by, and I seemed to see her soul, with fluttering
outstretched wings, sinking down to hell, as a hawk
drops out of sight into a dark cleft of the mountains.
And then, in the last resort, Fraser struck his hand
down on mine to clinch his defeat of me. And I,
looking upon that poor Kate, cried out:—

âGod forgive you, Fraser, for what you're doing—murderer!
murderer!â

Scarcely had my cry died away than I knew I
had borrowed the very words of Wedderburn to
me. A cold, like ice, came upon me. This reversal
of the past in the present was too ironic.
I heard the doctor chuckling drearily in Hades. I
suddenly sprang up like one pursued, and got away
into the night, leaving Kate and Fraser together
[154]

by the fire. But the spectre of the Manse surely
pursued me. I heard its soft but heavy footsteps
coming in my wake. I heard its old laughter in
the dark behind me; and I sickened and faltered,
and was in fear beyond all human fear of an
enemy. The next day I told Fraser he must leave
the Manse; I would build him a shooting-lodge
on any part of my estate that he preferred.

âNo,â he said, âno; I have grown to love the
old place; I never feel alone there.â

I looked in his eyes, searching after his meaning.

âI would rather pull down the Manse,â I said.

In reply, he touched with his forefinger the
lease I had signed with him, which lay on his
writing-table.

âYou cannot, my friend,â he said.

I cannot do anything that I would. I am driven
on a dark road by the creature with the whip that
is surely after every man who once yields to his
worst desires.

Just after this I received a visit from Mr. Mackenzie,
the new minister, a young and fervent, but
not very knowledgeable man, whose zeal was red-hot,
but incompetent, and who would have died for
the faith he could never properly expound, like
many young ministers of our church. The little
man was in a twisting turmoil of distress, and was
moved, so he said, to deal very plainly with me. I
bade him deal on. It seemed that his flock was
becoming infected with atheism, which spread like
[155]

the plague, from the old Manse. The young children
lisped it to each other in the lanes; lovers
talked it between their kisses; youths chattered
perdition at the idle corner by the church wall.
Even the old began to look askance at the Bible
that had been their only book of age, and to shiver
wantonly at the inevitable approach of death.
The young minister cried denunciation upon
Fraser, like a vague-minded, but angry Jonah before
a provincial Nineveh.

âTurn him out, Mr. Ralston, drive him forth,â
he ejaculated. âWhat is his rent to you? What
is his money in comparison with the immortal
souls of men? Away with him, away with him.â

I mentioned the small matter of the lease.
The young minister, with a quivering scarlet face,
replied stammering:—

âA lease! But—but—your own wife—she
is—is—â

âI do not discuss her,â I said sternly.

âWell; they are deserting the services. You
see that yourself. They will not come to hear me
preach. They will not listen to me.â

The man was tasting bitterness. He was
almost crying. I was terribly sorry for him. Yet,
all I could do was to think of the spectre at the
Manse and answer:—

âI can do nothing.â

His words were true. Carlounie's soul was
being devoured as by a plague. A colony of un
[156]
believers
was springing up in the midst of the
beautiful woods and the mountains. Soon the evil
fame of the place began to spread abroad, and
men, in distant parts of Scotland, to speak of
mad Carlounie. The matter weighed intolerably
upon me, and at last became a fixed idea. I could
think of nothing else but this devil's home in the
hills, this haunted and harassed centre of doom
and darkness which was my possession and in
which I lived. I fell into silence. I ceased to
stir abroad beyond my own land. It seemed to
me that Carlounie should keep strict quarantine,
should be isolated, and that each person who went
over its borders carried a strange infection and was
guilty of murder. I forbade Kate to drive beyond
my estates.

âI never wish to,â she said.

And I knew that where Fraser was she was
happy. He had her soul fast by this; or, it would
be truer to say, the spectre of the Manse had both
him and her. And he aged apace and bore on his
countenance the stamp of evil. And I brooded
and brooded upon the whole matter. But, from
whatever point I started, I came back to the Manse
and to the spectre dwelling in it with Hugh Fraser.
I had given death to Doctor Wedderburn, in return
for the life so miraculously given to me, and
now his spirit, retained in its ancient abiding-place,
spread death about it in its turn. This was, and
is, my conviction. The influence of the departed
[157]

clings to roof, to walls, to floors, leans on the accustomed
window-seat, trembles by the bed-head,
sits by the hearthstone, stands invisible in the passage
way.
To kill it one must destroy its home.
It
was my duty to kill it, therefore it was my duty to
destroy the Manse. This thought at length took
complete possession of me, and, following it, I
strove in every imaginable way to oust Fraser from
the house among the sycamores. But he would
not go. He loved the place, he said. He stood
by his lease and I was powerless.

Oh, God, I have, surely I have, my excuse for
what I have done! I meant to be a saviour, not a
destroyer! I would have restored Fraser and my
poor Kate to their freedom of heart. That was
what I meant. Ay, but the grey traveller fought
against me. Shut up here by night in my house,
on the verge of—that which I cannot, dare not
speak of, I declare that I am guiltless. Let him
bear the burden, him alone! In these last moments,
before my deed is known, I write the truth
that men may exonerate me. This is the truth.

Overwhelmed with this idea that Carlounie
must be rescued, that Hugh Fraser and Kate must
be rescued from this damnation that was preying
upon them, I determined, secretly, on the destruction
of the Manse, in which the spectre of the
doctor stayed to work such evil. But, to do this,
I must first make sure that Hugh Fraser was at
a distance, and that his small household—he only
[158]

kept two servants, hired from the village—were
away from the haunted dwelling. I, therefore,
suggested to Fraser that he should come and spend
a week with me, and give his maids a holiday.
After a little demur, and drawn, I see now, by his
hidden passion for Kate, he accepted my invitation.
He dismissed the maids to their homes for
a week, and moved over to us. When the minister
knew of it, he, no doubt, fully included me
in his prayers for the damnation of those who
worked evil among his flock. Will he ever read
these pages, I wonder? Kate was now an avowed
atheist, and she and Fraser were continually together,
glorying in their complete freedom from
old prejudices, and their new outlook upon life.
They had, I heard them say, broken through the
ties that bound poor, terrified Christians; and,
when they said this, they smiled, the one upon the
other. I did not then know why. Meanwhile, I
was preparing for my deed of redemption, as I
called it, and meant it to be. I was resolved to go
out by night to the empty Manse, and secretly to
set it in flames. It stood alone. The country
people slept sound at night. I calculated that if I
chose midnight for my act none would see the
flames, and, ere the peasants woke at dawn, the
Manse and the spectre within it would be destroyed
for ever. Such was my belief—such the
spirit in which I prepared myself for this strange
work.

[159]

V

THE RETURN OF THE GREY TRAVELLER

I write
these last words after the dead of night,
towards the coming of the dawn. Ere the light is
grey in the sky I shall be away to the burn to meet
him, the grey traveller. He is there waiting for me.
He has come back. I go to meet him, and I shall
never return. Carlounie will know my face no
more. All is done as he ordained. My words
have been as deeds, have marched on inevitably to
actual deeds. Long ago he said that sometimes,
even as we can never go back from things that we
have done, we can never go back from things that
we have said. So, indeed, it is.

According to my fixed intention, I determined
on a night for the destruction of the Manse. The
house was old and would burn like tinder. I
should break into it through the window of the
study, which was never shuttered. I should set
fire to the interior at several points, and escape in
the darkness of the night. By dawn the accursed
place would be a ruin, and then—then I looked
for a new era. Fool! Fool! I looked to see
the burden of the vile influence of the spectre lifted
from the soul of Fraser, and so from the soul of
Kate, which was infected by him. I looked to
see my people sane and satisfied as of old, Carlounie
[160]

no more a plague-spot in the land, that poor and
zealous man, the minister, calm and at rest with
his little faithful flock once more. All this I
looked for confidently. And so, when the black
and starless night of my deed came, I was happy and
serene. That night Kate pleaded a headache, and
went to bed very early, before nine. She begged
me not to come to her room to bid her good-night,
as she wanted perfect quiet and sleep. All
unsuspecting, I agreed to her request. Soon after
she had gone, Fraser, who had seemed heavy with
unusual fatigue all through the evening, also went
off to bed, and I was left alone. But it was not
yet time for me to start on my errand of the darkness.
The burning Manse would surely attract
attention before midnight. People might be out
and about in the village. A belated peasant might
be on his way home by the lane that skirted the
privet hedge. I must wait till all were sleeping.
The time seemed very long. Once I fancied I
heard a movement in the house—again I dreamed
that soft and hurried footsteps upon the gravel outside
broke on the silence. But I said to myself that
I was nervous, highly strung because of my strange
project, that my imagination tricked me. At last
the hour came. Without going upstairs I drew on
my thickest overcoat, took my hat and a heavy
stick, opened the hall door, and passed out into
the night. It was still and very cold, and the voice
of the burn came loudly to my ears. Treading
[161]

quietly, I made my way into the road, and set
forth along it in the direction of the Manse. The
ground was hard, and scarcely had I gone a few
yards before I thought that some one was furtively
following me. I stopped rather uneasily, and listened,
but heard nothing. I went on, and again
seemed aware of distant footsteps treading gently
behind me. The sound made me suppose that
some one of my household must be after me, moved
by curiosity as to the reason of my present pilgrimage;
but I was not minded to be watched, so I
turned sharply, yet very softly, around and faced
the way I had come. I encountered no one, nor
did I any longer catch the patter of feet. So,
reckoning that my nerves must be playing with me,
I pursued my way. But the whole of the distance
between my dwelling and the Manse I seemed
vaguely to hear a noise of one treading behind me.
And, although I said to myself that there was
nobody out beside myself, I was filled with the stir
of a shifting uneasiness. I entered the lonely and
narrow lane that led beside the Manse, and presently
arrived in front of the house; when, what
was my astonishment to perceive a light gleaming
in the study window. My hand was on the gate
when it went out, and all the front of the house
was black and eyeless. For so brief a moment
had I seen the light that I was moved to think that
it, too, existed, like the sound of steps, only in my
excited brain. Nevertheless, I did not go up at
[162]

once to the house, but paced the lane for a full half-hour,
always—so it seemed to me—tracked by
some one. But, since I kept turning about, and the
footfalls were always at my back, I grew certain
that they were nothing more nor less than a fantasy
on my part. It must have been well after
twelve when I summoned courage to enter the
garden and to approach the Manse. The steps, I
thought, followed me to the gate and then paused,
as if a sentinel was posted there to keep watch.
Arrived at the stone step which preceded the hall
door, I, too, paused in my turn and listened. Did
the spectre that inhabited this abode know of my
coming, of my purpose? Was it crouching within,
like some frantic shadow, fearful of its impending
fate? Or was it, perhaps, preparing to attack, to
repel me? Strangely, I had now no fear of it, or
of anything. I was calm. I felt that my deed
was one of rescue, even though, by performing it,
I wrought destruction. I moved to the study
window, and was about to smash in the glass with
my heavy stick when a mad idea came to me to
try the hall door. I put my hand upon it and
found it not locked. This opening of the door
sent a shiver through me, and a ghastly sense of
the occupation of this deserted abode. I was filled
again with an acute consciousness of the indwelling
spectre, whom, in truth, I came to murder. But, I
reasoned, this door has been left unbarred by the
carelessness of Fraser's servants, that is all.

[163]

I stood on the lintel, struck a match and set it
to a candle end which I drew from my coat pocket.
The flame burned up, showing the narrow passage,
the umbrella stand, the doors on either side.
I entered the study softly, looking swiftly on all
sides of me as I did so. Did I expect a vision of
Doctor Wedderburn lounging at the table, his
fingers thrust into a Bible? I scarcely know;
but I saw nothing except the grimly standing furniture,
the lamp on the table, the vacant chairs, the
books in their shelves. I listened. There was no
rustle of the spectre that I came to kill. Did it
watch me? Did it see me there? I set fire to
the room, passed quickly to the chamber on the
other side of the passage, from thence to the
kitchen and the dining-parlour, leaving a track of
dwarf flames behind me. The means of destruction
I had prepared and carried with me. They
availed. When I once more reached the garden, the
ground floor of the Manse was in a blaze. But now
came the incredible event which I must chronicle
before I go down to the burn for the last time.

Having gained the garden, I waited there in the
darkness to watch my work progress. I saw the
light within the Manse, at first a twinkle, grow
to a glare. I heard the faint crackle of the
burning rooms increase to a soft and continuous
roar. And, as I watched and listened, a mighty
sense of relief ran through me. Thus did I burn
up my past! thus did I sacrifice grandly and
[164]

gladly the ill spirit my wild desires had evoked!
Thus—thus! All the base of the Manse was
red-hot, when, on a sudden, I heard a great shout
that seemed to come from the sky. Light sprang
in an upper window. There followed a sound like
the smash of glass, and I saw two arms shoot out,
the top part of a figure and a face framed in the
glare. I deemed it the vision of the poor spectre
that I destroyed. I looked upon it and fancied
I could detect the tortured lineaments of the
doctor, his accustomed gestures distorted by fear
and fury. But then I seemed to see behind him
another figure, struggling, and to hear the failing
scream of a woman. But the flames from below
leaped to the roof. The floors fell in with an
uproar. The figure, or figures, disappeared.

Trembling I turned to go, my mind shuddering
at the thought of the apparition I had seen. I
got into the lane and hastened towards home.
Soon the burning Manse was out of sight, and I
was swallowed up in the intense darkness.

Now, as I went along, a terrible and very peculiar
sensation came upon me. I heard no footsteps;
all was silence. Yet I seemed to be aware
that I was closely companioned, that at my very
side something—I knew not what—walked,
keeping pace with me. And so close did I believe
this thing to be, that at moments I even felt it
pressing against me like a slim figure in the night.
Once, when it thus nestled to me, as if in affection,
[165]

I could not refrain from crying out aloud. I
stretched forth my arms to grasp this surely amorous
horror of the darkness, but found nothing, and
pursued my road in a sweat of apprehension. And
still, the thing was certainly with me, and seemed,
I thought, to praise me as I walked, as the good
man is praised on his journey. My great horror
was that this creature that I could not see, could
not hear, could not feel, and yet was so sharply
conscious of, was
well disposed towards me
. My
heart craved its hatred—but it loved me I knew.
My soul demanded its curses. I almost heard it
bless me as I moved. My knees knocked together,
my limbs were turned to wax, as it was borne in
upon me that I had surely done this terror that
walked in darkness a service of some kind. To be
pursued in fury by one of the dreadful beings
that dwell in the borderland beyond our sight is
sad and dreary; but to be followed thus by one
as by a dog, to be fawned upon and caressed—this
is appalling. I longed to shriek aloud. I
broke into a run, and, like one demented, gained
the gate of Carlounie; but always the thing was
with me—full of joy and laudation. At the house
door I paused, facing round. I was moved to
address this thing I could not see.

âWho is it that walks with me?â I cried, and
my voice was high and strained.

A voice I knew, young, clear, level, a little
formal, answered out of the darkness:—

[166]

âIt is I.â

It was the voice of the grey traveller whom I
had seen long ago by the burnside. I leaned back
against the door and my shoulders shook against it.

âWhat do you want of me?â

âI come to thank you.â

âWhat, then, have I done?â

âYou have brought the tribute money.â

I did not understand, and I answered:—

âNo. One soul I may have destroyed, but two
I have saved to-night. For I have slain the spectre
that preyed upon them and I have set them free
from bondage.â

The voice answered:—

â
Go into the house and see.
â

Then again I was filled with apprehension. I
turned to go in at my door, and, as I did so, I
heard footsteps treading in the direction of the
burn, and a fading voice which cried, like an
echo:—

âAnd then come to me.â

And, as the voice died, I heard the rush of
sheep in the night.

Filled with nameless fear and a cold apprehension,
I entered the house, and, led by some
cruel instinct, made my way to Kate's room.
The lamp she always had at night burned dimly
on the dressing-table and cast a grave radiance
upon an empty bed.

[167]

What could this mean?

I stole to the room of Fraser, bearing the lamp
with me. His chamber was also untenanted;
but, on the quilt of the bed, lay a piece of paper
written over. I took it up and read—with the
sound of the burn in my ears:—

âYou stole her from me. I take back my own. To-night
we stay at the old Manse. To-morrow we shall
be far away.

Hugh Fraser.
â

The paper dropped from my hand upon the
quilt. A woman's scream rang in my ears above
the roar of flames. I understood.

The tribute money has been paid.
I go down to the burn. The grey traveller is
waiting there for me.

Robert Hichens.

Frederic Hamilton.

[171]

AN ECHO IN EGYPT

That
lustrous land of weary music and wild dancing,
of reverend tombs and pert Arabs, that Egypt
of plagues and tourists, to whose sandy bosom
Society flocks, affects her visitors in many different
ways. Bellairs went to her under the fixed impression
that he was a cynic, and found that he
was a romanticist. Very acute in mind, he had
long flattered himself on being unimpressionable;
and he was much inclined to think that to be insensitive
was to be strong with the best kind of
strength. He loved to lay stress on all that was
devil-may-care in his character, and to put aside all
that was prone to cling, or weep, or wonder, or
pray, and he fancied that if he cultivated one side
of his mind assiduously he could eliminate the other
sides. In England, in London, the process had
seemed to be successful. But Egypt gave to him
illusions with both hands, and, against his will, he
had to accept them. Protests were unavailing, and
soon he ceased to protest, and told himself the
horrid fact that he was a sentimentalist, perhaps
even a poet. Good heavens! a Bellairs—a poet!
His soldier ancestors seemed forming a square and
fixing bayonets to resist the charging notion. And
yet—and yet—

[172]

Instead of playing pool after dinner at night,
Bellairs found himself wandering, like Haroun Al
Raschid, through the narrow ways of Cairo, mixing
with the natives, studying their loves, and drinking
their coffee. There were moments, retrograde moments,
when he even wished to wear their dress,
to drape his long-limbed British form in a flowing
blue robe, and wrap his dark head in a bulging
white turban. He resisted this devil of an idea;
but the fact that it had ever come to him troubled
him. And, partly to regain his manhood, his hard
scepticism, his contempt of outside, delicate influences,
he went up the Nile—and succumbed
utterly to fantasy and to old romance. âI am no
longer Jack Bellairs,â he told himself one day, as
the steamer on which he travelled neared Luxor
on its way down the river from the First Cataract—âI
am somebody else; some one who is touched
by a sunset, and responsive to a gleam of rose on
the Libyan Mountains, some one who dreams at
night when the pipes wail under the palm-trees,
some one who feels that the great river has life, and
that the desert owns a wistful soul, and has a sweet
armour with silence. Good-bye, Jack Bellairs!
Go home to England—I stay here.â

And that evening he left the steamer, and took
a room for a month at the Luxor Hotel. And
that evening he cast the skin of his former
self, and emerged, with fluttering wings, from the
chrysalis of his identity. He was a bachelor, aged
[173]

twenty-eight, and he was travelling alone; so there
was no critical eye to mark the change in him, no
chattering tongue to express surprise at his pleasant
abandonment to the follies which make up the lives
of sensitive artists and refined sensualists who can
differentiate between the promenade of the âEmpire,â
and the garden of love. As he stepped out
into the Arab-haunted village that night, after
dinner, Bellairs breathed a sigh of relief. For a
month he would let himself go. Where to? He
bent his steps towards the river, the Nile that is the
pulsing blood in the veins of Egypt. Moored in
the shadow of its brown banks lay a string of
bright-eyed dahabeeyahs. From more than one of
them came music. Bellairs, his cigarette his only
companion, strolled slowly along listening idly in a
pleasant dream. A woman's voice sang, asking
âNinonâ what was her scheme of life. A man
beat out his soul at the feet of âMedje.â And,
upon the deck of the last dahabeeyah, a woman
played a fantastic mazurka. Bellairs was fond of
music, and her performance was so clever, so full
of nuances, understanding, wild passion, that he
stood still to remark it more closely.

âShe has known many things, good and evil,â
he thought, as his mind noted the intellect that
spoke in the changes of time, the regret and the
gaiety that the touch demonstrated so surely and
easily, as the mood of the composition changed.
The music ceased.

[174]

âBetty,â a woman's voice said, in English, but
with a slight French accent, âI want to see the stars.
This awning hides them. Come for a little walk.â

âYes; I want to see the stars too, and the
awning does hide them,â a girl's voice answered.
âDo let us take a little walk.â

Bellairs smiled, as he said to himself, âThe
first voice is the voice of the musician, and the
second voice seems to be its echo.â He was still
standing on the bank when the two women stepped
upon the gangway to the shore and climbed to the
narrow path.

As they passed him by they glanced at him
rather curiously. One was a woman of about
thirty, dark, with a pale, strong-featured face.
The other was a fair, aristocratic-looking girl, not
more than seventeen.

âShe is the echo,â Bellairs thought. âRather
a sweet one.â Then, at a distance, he followed
them, and presently found them sitting together
in the garden of the Hotel. He sat down not far
off. A man, whom he knew slightly, spoke to
them, and afterwards crossed to him.

âThat lady plays very cleverly,â Bellairs said.

âMademoiselle Leroux, you mean—yes. You
know her?â

âNot at all. I only heard her from the river
bank.â

âShe is travelling with Lord Braydon. She is
a great friend of Lady Betty Lambe, his daughter.â

[175]

âThat pretty girl?â

âYes. Shall I introduce you?â

âI should be delighted.â

A moment later Bellairs was sitting with the
two ladies and talking of Egypt. It seemed to
him that they were the first nurses to dandle his
new baby-nature, this nature which Egypt had
given to him, and which only to-night he had
definitely accepted. Perhaps this fact quickly
cemented their acquaintance. At any rate, a distinct
friendship began to walk in their conversation,
and Bellairs found himself listening to Mdlle.
Leroux, and looking at Lady Betty, with a great
deal of interest and of admiration. Presently the
former said:—

âI knew you would be introduced to us
to-night.â

Bellairs was surprised.

âWhen?â he asked.

âWhen we passed you just now on the bank
of the Nile.â

âI knew we should too,â said Lady Betty.

âYou must be very intuitive,â said Bellairs.

âWomen generally are,â remarked Mdlle.
Leroux.

âYes. Do your intuitions tell you whether our
acquaintance will be long and agreeable?â

âPerhaps—but I never prophesy.â

âWhy?â

âBecause I am always right.â

[176]

âIs that a valid reason for abstention?â

âI think so. For in this world those who look
forward generally see darkness.â

âI cannot achieve a proper pessimism in Upper
Egypt,â Bellairs replied.

A week later, Bellairs felt quite certain that
there had never been a period in his life when he
had not known and talked with Mdlle. Leroux and
Lady Betty Lambe. Lord and Lady Braydon
asked him to lunch on the dahabeeyah almost every
day, and he often strolled down to tea without
invitation. Then, in the afternoon, there were
donkey expeditions to Karnak, or across the river
to the tombs of the kings, to the desert villa of
Monsieur Naville, to ancient Thebes, to the two
Colossi. Lord Braydon was consumptive and
was spending the winter and spring in Egypt.
Lady Braydon seldom left his side, and so it happened
that Bellairs and his two acquaintances of
the garden were often alone together. Bellairs
became deeply interested in them, and for a rather
peculiar reason. He was fascinated by the extraordinary
sympathy that existed between the two
women—if Lady Betty could be called a woman
yet. Mdlle. Leroux had obtained so strong an
influence over the girl that she seemed to have
grafted not only her mind, but her heart, her apparatus
of emotions and of affections, on to Lady
Betty's. What the former silently thought, the
[177]

latter silently thought too, and when the silence
died in expression, they frequently spoke almost
the same sentence simultaneously. Sometimes
Mdlle. Leroux would express some feeling with
vehemence to Bellairs when Lady Betty was out
of hearing, and an hour or two afterwards, with
only a slightly fainter vehemence, Lady Betty
would express the same feeling. Indeed, these two
women seemed to have only one heart, one soul,
between them, the heart and soul that had originally
been the sole property of the elder one.

âYou are very generous,â said Bellairs one day
to Mdlle. Leroux.

âWhy?â she asked in surprise.

âYou give away things that most of us have
only the power to keep.â

âWhat do you mean?â

âSome day, perhaps, I will tell you.â

Clarice Leroux was tremendously impulsive,
and she had taken an immediate and strong liking
to Bellairs. In this Lady Betty, as usual, coincided.
But when Clarice's liking passed through
self-revelations, confidences, towards a stronger
feeling, it was rather strange to find Lady Betty
still treading in her footsteps, still ever succeeding
her in her attitudes of mind and of heart. Yet the
inevitable double flirtation, apparently expected
and desired by the two women, was strangely
gilded by novelty; and, at first, Bellairs played as
happily with these two dual natures as a child plays
[178]

with two doll representatives of Tweedledum and
Tweedledee. For, at first, he possessed the child's
power of detachment, and felt that he could at any
moment discard dolls for soldiers, or a Noah's
Ark, and still keep happiness in his lap. But most
things have an inherent tendency to become complicated
if they are let alone and allowed to develop
free from definite guidance, and presently Bellairs
became conscious of advancing complications.
His intellectual appreciation of a new situation
began to degenerate into a more emotional condition,
which disturbed and irritated him. It
seemed that he was peering through the bars of the
gate that guards the garden of passion. Which
of the two women did he see in the garden?

He told himself that, having regard to the circumstances
of the case, he ought to see both of
them. Unfortunately, a vision of that kind never
has been, and never will be, seen by a man. The
temple in which the idol sits always makes a difference
in the nature of our worship of the idol.
Bellairs was forced to recognise this fact. And
the temple in which sat the idol of Lady Betty's
nature attracted him more than the temple in which
sat the idol of Mdlle. Leroux's nature. He came
to this conclusion one afternoon at Karnak. They
three were hidden away in a stone nook of this
great stone forest, enshrined from the gaze of tourists
by mighty rugged pillars, walled in by huge
blocks of antique masonry that threw cold shadows
[179]

whence the lizards stole to seek the sun. The blue
sky was broken to their gaze by a narrow section
of what had been, doubtless, once a wide-spread
roof. A silence of endless ages hung around them
in this haven fashioned by dead men and living
Time.

Mdlle. Leroux had been boiling a kettle; and
they sipped tea, and, at first, did not talk. But
tea unlooses the bonds of speech. After their
second cups they felt communicative.

âOne week gone out of my four,â Bellairs
said, âand each will seem shorter-lived than its
forerunner.â

âYou go in three weeks from now?â said
Mdlle. Leroux, with an uneven intonation that betokened
a sudden awakening to the finality of things.

âYes; at the end of January.â

âAnd we are here until nearly the end of March.â

âYes,â said Lady Betty; âit will seem a very
long time. February will be eternal.â

âIt is the shortest month in the year,â Bellairs
remarked.

Mdlle. Leroux looked at him sarcastically.

âYou English are so prosaic,â she exclaimed.
âAny Frenchman would have understood.â

âWhat?â

âThat we were paying you a compliment.â

âPerhaps I did understand it, and preferred not
to show my comprehension; there is such a thing
as modesty!â

[180]

âThere is—such a thing as false modesty!â

âExactly,â remarked Lady Betty.

âI will accept your compliment gladly,â said
Bellairs, looking at Lady Betty.

âMine?â asked Clarice Leroux.

âYes,â Bellairs replied.

The consciousness that he cared very much
more for such a pretty meaning in Lady Betty
than in Clarice Leroux led him then, for the first
time, to that Garden Gate. He looked at Lady
Betty again with a new feeling. She returned his
gaze quietly. Then he turned his eyes to those of
Clarice. Hers were fixed upon him with a curious
violence. He had a momentary sensation,
literally for the first time, that these two women
after all, had not one soul, one heart, between
them. They did not feel quite simultaneously.
Lady Betty was always a step behind Clarice.
Yes, that was the difference between them. However
quickly the echo follows the voice that summons
it, yet it must always follow. Would Lady
Betty never cease to follow? Bellairs found himself
wondering eagerly, for that afternoon a strange
certainty came to him. He knew, in a flash, that
Clarice, if she did not already love him, was on
the verge of loving him. He knew now that he
loved Lady Betty. But she didn't love him yet,
was not even quite close to loving him. Had she
been in Egypt alone, divorced from Clarice, Bellairs
believed that he would not have attracted her.
[181]

He attracted her through Clarice, because he
attracted Clarice. Could he make her love him in
the same way? It would be a curious, subtle
experiment to try to win one woman's heart by
winning another's: Bellairs silently decided to
make it. All the rest of that afternoon he talked
to Clarice, showing to her the new self that Egypt
had given him, the poetry which had ousted the
prose inherited from a long line of ancestors, the
sentiment of which he was no longer ashamed now
he felt it to be a weapon with which he might win
two hearts, the heart that contained another heart,
as one conjurer's box contains a hundred others.

âI knew it when I first saw you,â Clarice said.
âDirectly I looked at you that evening on the
bank I knew it.â

âHow strange,â Bellairs answered.

âAnd you—did you know it when you heard
me playing?â

âThat mazurka! Remember I am a man.â

They were sitting in the garden. It was night.
Very few people were out, for a great Austrian
pianist was playing in the public drawing-room,
and the little world of Luxor sat at his feet relentlessly.
They two could hear, mingling with a
Polonaise of Chopin, the throbbing of tom-toms in
the dusty village, the faint and suggestive cry
of the pipes, which fill the soul at the same time
with desire, and regret for past desire killed by
[182]

gratification. Bellairs had been making love to
Clarice, and she had told him that she loved him.
And he had kissed her and his kiss had been
returned.

âWill this kiss, too, have its echo?â he
thought; and his eyes travelled towards the lighted
windows of the drawing-room behind which Lady
Betty sat. He turned again to Clarice.

âDo you believe in echoes?â he asked.

âEchoes!â

âThat each thing we do in life, each word, each
cry, each act, calls into being, perhaps very soon,
perhaps very late, a repetition?â

âFrom the same person?â

âOr from some other person.â

âWhat a curious idea. You think we cannot
ever do anything without finding an imitator! I
don't like to imagine it. I don't fancy that there
can ever, in the history of the world, be an exact
repetition of our feeling, our doing, to-night.â

âYet, there may be. Who knows?â

âI do. Instinct tells me there never can.
There has never been, never will be, any woman
with a heart just like mine, given to a man just in
the same way as mine is given to you. Why
should you think such a hateful thing?â

âI don't know. It was only an idea that occurred
to me.â

And again he glanced towards the lighted
windows.

[183]

âThe world is very full of echoes,â he went on;
âour troubles are repeated.â

âBut not our joys, our deepest joys. No, no,
never!â

âThere have always been lovers, and they all
act in much the same way!â

âHateful! Ah! why can't we invent some
new mode of expression for ourselves—you and
I?â

âBecause we are human beings, and one network
of tangled limitations.â

âYou make me cry with anger,â she said.

And when he looked, he saw that there were
tears shining in her eyes.

At that moment a ghastly sensation of compunction
swept over him. What had he done?
A deep wrong, the deepest wrong man can do.
He had made an experiment, as a scientist may
make an experiment. He had vivisected a soul,
but the soul was yet ignorant of the fact. When
it knew, would it die? But then he told himself
he had to do it. For he loved passionately, and
was certain that he could only gain the heart he
had not yet completely won by gaining this heart
that he had completely won. He had made an
experiment. If it failed! But it could not fail.
All that Clarice said, all that she thought, all that
she desired, Betty said, thought, desired. After
the necessary interval the echo must follow the
voice. And he smiled to himself.

[184]

âWhy do you smile like that?â Clarice asked.

âBecause—because I thought I heard an
echo,â he replied. And then they kissed again.
He, with his eyes shut, forced his imagination to tell
him that the lips he pressed were the lips of Betty.
She thought only of the lips of love, that burn up
all the recollections of the lonely years, all the
phantoms which dwell in the deserts through which
women pass to joy—or to despair.

The Austrian pianist was exhausted. Even his
long hair could no longer sustain his failing energies.
He expired magnificently, the seventh
rhapsody of Liszt serving as his bier. Lady Betty
came out into the garden.

âHow unmusical you two are,â she said; âhis
playing was exquisite.â

âWe heard finer music here,â Clarice answered,
as she got up to go back to the dahabeeyah—âdid
we not?â

She turned to Bellairs. He was looking at Lady
Betty and did not hear. Clarice's cheek flushed
angrily.

âCome, Betty,â she exclaimed. âGood-night,
Mr Bellairs.â

âGood-night, Mr Bellairs,â echoed Lady
Betty.

The two women moved away, and vanished
down the narrow and dusty avenue that leads to
the bank of the Nile. Bellairs stood looking after
them. He was wondering why he loved Betty
[185]

and did not love Clarice. It seemed feeble to
love an echo. Yet, the intonation of an echo is
sometimes exquisite in its trilling vagueness, its
far-off, thrilling beauty. And Bellairs fancied that
if he once wakened Betty to passion he would
free her, in a moment, from her curious bondage,
would give to her the soul that Clarice must
surely have crushed down and expelled, replacing
it with a replica of her own soul. And then he
asked himself, being analytically inclined that night,
what he adored in Betty. Was it merely her fresh
young beauty? It could not be her nature; for
that, at present, was merely Clarice's, and he did
not love the nature of Clarice. Yet he felt it was
something more than her beauty. When he had made
her love him he would know; for, when he had
made her love him, he would force her to be herself.

He watched the bats circling among the shadowy
palms. How gentle the air was. How sweet the
stars looked. Bellairs thought of England that
was so far away. It seemed impossible that he
could ever be in London again, ever again assume
a Piccadilly nature, and laugh at the folly of having
a romance. Yes, it seemed impossible.
Nevertheless, in a fortnight he must go. But he
would take Betty's promise with him. He was
resolved on that. And then he left the silent
garden to the bats, and was soon between the
mosquito curtains, dreaming.

[186]

Three days afterwards Clarice was prostrated
with a nervous headache. She could not bear to
have any one in her cabin, and Lady Betty sat on
the deck of the
Queen Hatasoo
quite inconsolable.
Bellairs, arriving to pay his usual afternoon call,
found her there. Lord Braydon was out, sailing
in a flat-bottomed boat far up the river with Lady
Braydon, so Lady Betty was quite desolate. She
told Bellairs so mournfully.

âAnd Clarice won't let me come near her,â she
exclaimed. âA step on the floor, the creak of the
cabin door as I come in, tortures her. She is
all nerves. I hope I shan't have her headache
presently.â

âIs it likely?â

âI often do. She seems to pass it on to me.
I never had a headache until I knew her. But,
indeed, I never seemed to live, I never seemed to
know anything, be anything, until she came into
my life.â

âI wish I had known you before you knew her,â
Bellairs said.

âWhy?â

âI don't know—perhaps to see if you were
really so very different from what you are now.â

âI was—utterly.â

âWhat were you like?â

âI can't remember—but I was utterly different.â

As she ceased speaking, Bellairs glanced over
the rail to the river bank. Two blue-robed donkey
[187]

boys stood there trying to attract his attention,
and pointing significantly to their gaily-bedizened
donkeys.

âShall we go for a ride?â he said to Lady
Betty. âJust along the river bank? Then we
shall see Lord Braydon as he sails back. Mdlle.
Leroux won't miss you. Shall we go?â

Betty hesitated. But she could do the invalid
no good by staying. So she assented. Bellairs
helped her to the bank and placed her in the smart
red saddle. He motioned the boys to keep well in
the rear, and they started at a quick, tripping walk.
As they went, a white face appeared at a cabin window,
staring after them, the face of Clarice, who had
with difficulty lifted her throbbing head from the pillow.
She watched the donkeys diminishing till they
were black shadows moving along against the sky,
then she began to cry weakly, but only because she
was too ill to be with them. Her gift of prophecy
failed her at this critical juncture of her life, and she
had no sense of a coming disaster, as she lay back
on her berth, and gave herself up once more to pain.

That evening Lord Braydon asked Bellairs to
dine on the dahabeeyah, and he accepted the invitation.
Clarice was still in durance, having entirely
failed to pass her headache on to Lady Betty.
After dinner Lord Braydon went into the saloon to
write a letter to England, and Lady Betty and
Bellairs had the deck to themselves. He was
resolved to put his fate to the touch; for, during
[188]

the donkey ride, he had discovered the change in
Betty which he had so eagerly desired, the change
from warm friendship to a different feeling. The
girl had not acknowledged it. Bellairs had not
asked her to do so; but he meant to. Only the
thought of his treachery to the woman lying in the
cabin below held him back, just for a moment, and
prompted him to talk lightly of indifferent things.
But that treachery had been a necessary manÅuvre
in his campaign of happiness. He strove to dismiss
it from his mind as he leant forward in his
chair, and led Lady Betty to the subject that lay so
near to his heart.

âYou love me?â she said presently.

âYes—deeply. You are angry?â

âHow can I be? No, no—and yet—â

âYes?â

âAnd yet, when you told me, I felt sad.â

Bellairs looked keenly vexed, and she hastened
to add:—

âNot because I am—indifferent. No, no. I
can't explain why the feeling came. It was gone
in a moment. And now—â

âNow you are happy?â

He caught her hand and she left it in his.

âYes, very happy.â

Bellairs bent over her and kissed her—as he
lifted himself up a white hand appeared on the rail
of the companion that led from the lower to the
upper deck of the
Hatasoo
. Clarice wearily dragged
[189]

herself up. She was wrapped in a shawl and looked
very ill. Betty ran to help her.

âI thought I must get a little air,â she said
feebly. âHow d'you do, Mr Bellairs?â

She sank down in a chair.

Bellairs felt like a man between two fires.

Two days later Lord Braydon gave his consent
to his daughter's engagement with Bellairs, and
Lady Betty ran to tell Clarice. She had not previously
said a word to her friend of what had passed
between her and Bellairs. He had begged her to
keep silence until he had spoken to Lord Braydon,
and she had promised and had kept her promise.
But now she rushed into the saloon where Clarice
was playing Chopin, and, throwing her arms round
her friend, told her the great news. The body of
Clarice became rigid in her arms.

âAnd the king has consented,â Betty cried.

The king was her father.

âClarice, Clarice, isn't it wonderful?â

âWonderful! I thought so when you told me.
But already I begin to doubt if it is.â

âTo doubt, Clarice?â

âTo doubt whether anything a man does is
wonderful.â

That was all Clarice said. Then she kissed
Betty, and went on playing Chopin feverishly,
while Betty told, to the accompaniment of the
music, all that was in her heart.

[190]

âAnd,â she said at last, âI love him, Clarice;
I love him intensely. I shall always love him.â

Clarice played a final chord and got up.

Bellairs lunched on the dahabeeyah that day and
Clarice met him as usual. Her manner gave no
sign of any mental disturbance. Perhaps it was
curiously calm. He wondered a little, but was too
happy to wonder much. Joy made him cruel, for
nothing is so cruel as joy. Only he was glad that
Clarice had so much pride, for he thought now that
in her pride lay his safety. He no longer feared
that she would condescend to a scene, and he even
thought that perhaps she did not feel so deeply as
he had supposed.

âAfter all,â he said to himself exultantly,
âthere's no harm done. I need not have been so
conscience-stricken. What is a pretty speech and
a kiss to a woman who has lived, travelled over the
world, read widely, thought many things? Now,
if I had treated Betty in such a way I should be a
blackguard. She could not have understood. She
could only have suffered. I will never hurt her—Betty!â

His nature was so full of her that it could no
longer hold any thought of Clarice. And for a
little while, as Bellairs dived into Betty's heart, he
was astonished at the passion he found there, and
congratulated himself on having released her from
bondage. Now, at least, he was teaching her to
be herself. He was killing the echo and creating
[191]

a voice, a beautiful, clear, radiant voice that would
sing to him, to him alone.

âBetty has a great deal in her,â he said to
Clarice once.

âYes—a great deal. Who put it there, do you
think?â

âWho? Why, nobody. Surely you would
not say that all you yourself have of—of strength,
originality, courage, was put into you by some
other man or woman.â

âNo. I would not say that. But then—I am
not Betty.â

Bellairs felt irritated.

âPlease don't run Betty down,â he exclaimed
hastily.

âI! I run down Betty! I don't think you
understand what I feel about Betty. She is the one
perfect being I know. I worship her.â

âI am sure you do,â he said, mollified. âAnd
you have done much for her, perhaps too much.â

âI cannot tell that—yet,â Clarice answered.
âSome day I may know whether I have done very
much, or very little.â

âSome day—when?â

âPerhaps very soon.â

Bellairs wondered what she meant, and wondered,
too, why he had a sudden sense of uneasiness.

It was a day or two after this conversation that
a light cloud seemed to float across his lover's
happiness with Betty. He could not tell the exact
[192]

moment when it came, nor from what quarter it
journeyed. But he felt the obscuring of the sun
and the lessening of the lovely warmth of intimacy.
He was chilled and alarmed, and at night, when he
was alone with Betty in the stern of the
Hatasoo

bidding her good-bye, he could not refrain from
saying:—

âBetty, is anything the matter?â

âThe matter, Jack?â

âYes. Are you quite happy to-day? Quite as
happy as you were yesterday?â

âI suppose so—I believe so.â

But she did not speak with a perfect conviction,
and Bellairs was more gravely troubled.

âI am certain something is wrong,â he persisted.
âI have done something that has offended
you, or said something stupid. What is it? Do
tell me.â

âI can't. There is nothing to tell. Really,
there is not.â

âYou would tell me if there was?â

âOf course.â

âAnd you love me as much as ever?â

âOh, yes.â

He looked into her eyes, asking them mutely to
tell him the truth. And he thought their expression
was strangely cold. The light had surely
faded out of them. He kissed her silently and
went forward. Clarice was standing there looking
at the rising moon.

[193]

âGood-night,â he said, holding out his hand.

âHow grave you look,â she answered, not
seeing the hand.

âThe moonlight makes people look unnatural.â

âIt does not reach the deck yet.â

âGood-night,â he said again, and he went down
the stairs.

She looked after him with a smile. When he
had gone, she turned her head and called.

âBetty!â

âYes!â

âCome here and sit with me. Let us watch
the moon. Don't talk. I want to think—and
to make you think—as I do.â

The cloud which Bellairs had fancied he noticed
did not dissolve in the night. It was not drawn up
mysteriously into the sun to fade in gold. On the
contrary, next day he could no longer pretend to
himself that his anxiety as a lover rendered him
foolishly self-conscious, dangerously observant of
the merest trifles. There really was a change in
Betty, and a change which grew. He became
seriously alarmed. Could it be possible that the
ardent passion which she had displayed in the first
moments of their engagement was already subsiding
as cynics say passion subsides after marriage?
Such a supposition seemed ridiculous. The ardour
which has never fulfilled itself is not liable to cool.
And Betty was a young girl who had not known
love before. If she tired of it after so short an
[194]

experience of its delights, she could be nothing
less than a wholly unnatural and distorted being.
And she was strangely natural. Bellairs rode out
alone with her along the built-up brown roads into
the desert, and tried to interest her, but she was
abstracted and seemed deep in thought. Often she
didn't hear what he was saying, and when she did
hear and replied, her answers were short and careless,
and rather dismissed than encouraged the
subject to which they were applied. Bellairs, at
last, gave up attempting to talk, and from time to
time stole a cautious glance at her pretty face. He
noticed that it wore a puzzled expression, as if she
were turning over something in her mind and could
not come to a conclusion about it. She did not
look exactly sad, but merely grave and distrait.
At length he exclaimed, determined to rouse her
into some sort of comradeship:—

âYou never caught that headache, did you?â

âClarice's, you mean? No.â

âIs it coming on now?â

âOh, no. I feel perfectly well. What made
you think it was?â

âYou won't talk to me, and you look so preternaturally
serious. I am sure I have unwittingly
offended you?â

âNo, you haven't. You are just as you always
are, better to me than I deserve.â

âYou deserve the best man in the world.â

âI already have the best woman.â

[195]

âMdlle. Leroux?â

âYes; Clarice.â

âYou admire her very much.â

âOf course. I would give anything to be like
her.â

Bellairs hesitated a moment. Then he said with
a slight, uneasy laugh:—

âBut you are wonderfully like her.â

Betty looked surprised.

âI don't see how,â she answered.

âNo, because we never see ourselves. But
when I first knew you both, I was immensely
struck by the curious resemblance between you,
in mind, in the things you said, in the things you
did, the people you liked.â

âWe both liked you.â

âYes.â

âIt would have been strange if we had both
loved you!â Betty said, musingly.

Bellairs laughed again, and gave his horse a cut
with the whip. âI only wanted one to do that,â
he said, not quite truthfully. âAnd, thank God,
I have got my desire.â

Betty did not answer.

âHaven't I?â he persisted.

âYou know whether you have or not,â she
answered. âHow beautiful the sunset is going to
be to-night. Look at the light over Karnak.â

She pointed towards the temple with her whip.
Bellairs felt a crawling despair that numbed him
[196]

What did it all mean? Was he torturing himself
foolishly, or was this instinct which gnawed at his
heart a thing to be reckoned with? When he left
Betty at the dahabeeyah, he walked slowly, in the
gathering shadows, along the path which skirts
the dingy temple of Luxor. This change in Betty
was simply inexplicable. In no way could he
account for it. She had not the definite, angry
coldness of a girl who had made a dreadful mistake
and hated the man who had led her to make it.
No; she seemed rather in a state of mental transition.
She was setting foot on some bridge, which,
Bellairs felt, led away from the shore on which she
had been standing with him. Was her first transport
of love and joy a pretence? He could not
believe so. He knew it was genuine. That was
the puzzle which he could not put together. And
then he tried to comfort himself by thinking deliberately
of the many moods that make the feminine
mind so full of April weather, of how they come
and pass and are dead. All men had suffered from
them, especially all lovers. He could not expect to
be exempt—only, till now, Betty had seemed so
utterly free from moods, so steadily frank, eager,
charming, responsive. Bellairs finally argued himself
into a condition of despair, during which he
came to a resolve of despair. He silently decided
to seek a quiet interview with Clarice, and ask her
what was the matter with Betty. After all, there
was no reason why he should not take this step.
[197]

Clarice had evidently not cared deeply for him.
Otherwise, she would not have accepted his desertion
with such truly agreeable fortitude. Theirs
had been a passing flirtation—nothing more.
And, indeed, their intimacy gave him the right to
consult her, while her close knowledge of Betty
must render her an infallible judge of any reasons
which there might be to render the latter's conduct
intelligible.

Bellairs did not have to wait long before he put
his resolve into practice. That evening Betty,
who had become more and more abstracted and
silent, got up soon after dinner, and said she was
tired, and was going to bed. Bellairs tried to get
a moment with her alone, but she frustrated the
attempt by holding out her hand to him in public
and markedly bidding him good-night before Lord
and Lady Braydon. When she had disappeared,
Bellairs sought Clarice, who was downstairs in the
saloon writing letters. Clarice looked up from the
blotting-pad as he entered.

âI want to talk to you,â he exclaimed abruptly.

âI am writing letters.â

âDo give me a few minutes.â

âVery well,â she said, pushing her paper away
and laying down her pen. âWhat is it?â

âThat's what I want to ask you. What has
come over Betty? Is she ill?â

âBetty! Has anything come over her?â

[198]

Bellairs tapped his fingers impatiently on the
table.

âDon't tell me you haven't noticed the change,â
he said. âForgive me for saying that I couldn't
believe it if you did.â

âIn that case I won't trouble myself to say
it.â

âAh—you have! Then what's the matter?
Tell me.â

âHush, don't speak so loud or the sailors will
hear you, and Abdul understands English. I did
not say I knew the reason of this change.â

âYou must. You are Betty's other self, or
rather she is—was—yours.â

âWas! Do you mean that she is not now?â

âRemember, she loves me.â

âOh, and that makes a difference?â

âSurely!â

âYou have observed it?â

Bellairs hesitated. He scarcely knew whether
to reply in the affirmative or the negative. He
resolved upon a compromise.

âThere has hardly been time yet,â he said;
ânaturally, I expect that Betty will place me before
every one else.â

Mdlle. Leroux's eyes flashed under the hanging
lamp.

âWhat we expect is not always what we get,â
she said significantly.

Bellairs flushed. He understood that she was
[199]

alluding to his treatment of her, but he preferred
to ignore it, and went on:—

âIs Betty ill to-night?â

âNot at all.â

âThen what on earth is the matter? I ask
you for a plain answer. I think I deserve so
much.â

âMen are always so deserving,â she said with
bitterness.

âAnd women are always so exacting,â he retorted.
âBut please answer my question.â

âI will first ask you another. If you reply
frankly to me, I will reply frankly to you.â

She leaned her elbows on the table, supporting
her face on the palms of her upturned hands, and
looked into his eyes.

âAsk me,â said Bellairs eagerly; âI'll do
anything if you'll only explain Betty to me.â

âWhy did you try to make me love you? Why
did you make love to me?â

Bellairs pushed back his chair and there was an
awkward silence. Clarice's question was very unexpected
and very difficult to answer.

âWell?â she said, still with her eyes on his.

âIs it any good our discussing this?â he replied
at length. âIt meant nothing to you. It is over.â

âHow do you know it meant nothing to me?â

âYou have shown that by your conduct. You
care nothing. I am indifferent to you.â

âNo, not indifferent, not at all.â

[200]

âWhat? You can't mean—no, it is absurd!â

âWhat is absurd?â

âYou can't—you don't mean that you really
have any feeling for me?â

âI do mean it!â

Bellairs felt very uncomfortable. He scarcely
knew what to do or say. He fidgeted on his chair
almost like a boy caught in a dishonest act.

âWe had really better not talk about it,â he said.

âVery well.â Clarice reached out her hand for
her pen and drew the blotting-pad towards her.

âBut Betty?â said Bellairs uneasily.

âYou have not answered my question. I shall
not answer yours.â She dipped her pen in the ink
and prepared to go on with her letter. Bellairs
grew desperate.

âLook here,â he said; âyou must tell me the
reason of this change in Betty. Now I know you
don't care for me, you don't really love me.â

âNo, I don't love you,â she said quickly.

âWell, then, since you say that, I will answer
your question. I tried to win your heart because
I wanted to win Betty's!â

âWhat do you mean?â

âThat Betty is practically you—or was, your
echo, in word, deed, thought. Her mind, her heart,
followed yours in everything. I loved her, and I
knew that if I made you like me very much she
must follow you in that feeling as in others. Since
you don't love me, I can dare to tell you this.â

[201]

Clarice sat silent.

âAre you angry?â he asked.

âGo on,â she said.

âThat's all.â Again a silence.

âIt was your fault in a way,â Bellairs said
awkwardly. âYou made Betty your other self.
Why did you not let her alone?â

âCan a strong nature help impressing itself on
others?â

âOh, I don't know. I'm no psychologist. But—you
must let Betty alone now,â he said.

âSuppose I can't. Suppose this sympathy between
us has got beyond my control?â

âI shall release Betty from this bondage to you,â
Bellairs said, âmy love will—â

âYou! Your love!â Clarice said. And she
burst into a laugh.

Bellairs suddenly leaned forward across the table.

âI believe you hate me,â he exclaimed.

She, on her part, leaned forward till her face was
near his.

âYou're right,â she whispered; âI do hate
you. Now you know what's the matter with
Betty.â

For a moment Bellairs did not understand.

âNow—I know—â he repeated. âI don't—Ah!â
Comprehension flashed upon him.

âYou devil,â he said—âyou she-devil! Curse—curse
you!â Clarice laughed again. Bellairs
sprang up.

[202]

âNo, no, I won't believe it,â he cried. âI can't.
The thing's impossible.â

âIs it? The pendulum of my heart has swung
back from love to hate. Betty's is following.â

âNo, no!â

âWait, and you will see. Already she seems to
care less for you. You yourself have remarked it.â

âI have not,â he said with violence.

âTo-morrow she will care less, and so less—less—till
she too—hates you.â

âNever!â

âOnly wait—and you will know. And now,
good-night. I must really write my letter. It is
to my mother, and must go by to-morrow's mail.â

She resumed her writing quietly. Bellairs watched
her for a moment. Then he strode out of the
room, across the gangway, up the bank.

How dark the night was.

The explanation of Clarice struck Bellairs with
a benumbing force. In vain he argued to himself
that it was not the true one, that no heart could
follow another as she said Betty's followed hers,
that no nature could merely for ever echo another's.
Some furtive despair lurking in his soul whispered
that she had spoken the truth. An appalling sense
of utter impotence seized him, as it seizes a man
who fights with a shadow. But he resolved to fight.
His whole life's happiness hung on the issue.

On the following day he forced himself to be
[203]

cheerful, gay, talkative. He went early to the
dahabeeyah, and proposed to Lord Braydon a
picnic to Thebes. Lord Braydon assented. A
hamper was packed. The boat was ordered. The
little party assembled on the deck of the
Hatasoo

for the start; Lady Braydon, in a wide hat and
sweeping grey veil, Clarice with her big white
parasol lined with pale green, Lord Braydon in his
helmet, his eyes protected by enormous spectacles.
But where was Betty? Abdul, the dragoman,
went to tell her that they were going. She came,
without her hat, or gloves, holding a palm leaf fan
in her hand.

âI am not coming,â she said.

Clarice glanced at Bellairs. He pressed his
lips together and felt that he was turning white
underneath the tan the Egyptian sun rays had
painted on his cheeks. Lady Braydon protested.

âWhat's the matter, Betty?â she said. âThe
donkeys are ordered and waiting for us on the
opposite bank. Why aren't you coming?â

âI have got a headache. I'm afraid of the
sun to-day.â All persuasion was useless. They
had to set out without her. Bellairs was bitterly
angry, bitterly afraid. He could scarcely make the
necessary effort to be polite and talkative, but Lord
and Lady Braydon readily excused his gloom, understanding
his disappointment, and Clarice no
longer desired his conversation. That night he
did not see Betty. She was confined to her cabin
[204]

and would see no one but Clarice. On the following
day Bellairs went very early to the dahabeeyah
and asked for her. Abdul took his message,
and, after an interval, returned to him with the
following note:—

â
Dear Mr Bellairs
,—I am very sorry I cannot
see you this morning, but I am still very unwell. I
think the mental agony I have been and am undergoing
accounts for my condition. I must tell you the truth.
I cannot marry you. I mistook my feeling for you. I
honestly thought it love. I find it is only friendship.
Can you ever forgive me the pain I am causing you? I
cannot forgive myself. But I should do you a much
greater wrong by marrying you than by giving you up.
I have told my father and mother. See them if you like.
We sail to-morrow morning for Assouan.

â
Betty.
â

Bellairs, crumpling this note in his hand, would
have burst forth into a passion of useless rage and
despair, but Abdul's lustrous eyes were fixed upon
him. Abdul's dignified form calmly waited his
pleasure.

âWhere is Lord Braydon?â said Bellairs, âI
must see him.â

âHis lordship is on the second deck, sir.â

âTake me to him.â

The interview that followed only increased the
despair of Bellairs. Lord Braydon was most sympathetic,
most courteously sorry, but he said that
[205]

his daughter's decision was absolutely irrevocable,
and he could not attempt to coerce her in such an
important matter.

âAt any rate, I must see her before you sail,â
said Bellairs at last. âI think she owes me at
least that one last debt.â

âI think so too,â said Lord Braydon. âCome
at six. I will undertake that you shall see her.â

How Bellairs spent the intervening hours he
could never remember. He did not go back to
the hotel; he must have wandered all day along
the river bank. Yet he felt neither the heat, nor
any fatigue, nor any hunger. At six o'clock he
reached the dahabeeyah. Lady Betty was sitting
alone on the deck. She looked very pale and grave.

âMy father and mother and Clarice have gone
up to the hotel,â she said. âThat Austrian is
playing again this evening.â

âIs he?â Bellairs answered. He sat down
beside her and tried to take her hand. But she
would not let him.

âNo,â she said. âNo, it's no use. I have
made a ghastly mistake, but I will not make another.
Oh, forgive me, do forgive me!â

âHow can I? If you will not try to love me
my life is ruined.â

âDon't say that. It's no use to try to love.
You know that. We must just let ourselves alone.
Love comes, or hate, just as God wills it. We
can only accept our fate.â

[206]

âAs God wills,â Bellairs said passionately; âwhy
do you say that, when you know it is not true?â

âNot true—Mr Bellairs!â

âYes. If you echoed the will of God how
could I blame you? We must all do that—at
least, when we are good. And those of us who
are wicked I suppose echo the Devil. But you—what
do you echo?â

âI—I echo no one. I don't understand you.â

âBut you shall, before it is too late. Betty,
be yourself. Emancipate your soul. You are the
echo of that woman, of Clarice. Don't you see
it? Don't you know it? You are her echo—and
she hates me!â

Betty drew back from him—she was evidently
alarmed.

âAre you mad?â she said. âWhy do you
say such things to me? Clarice and I love each
other, it is true, but our real natures are totally
different. She does not hate you, nor do I. She
has never said one word against you to me. She
has always told me how much she liked you. What
are you saying?â

âThe truth!â

âI—her echo! Why, then—then if that
were the case she must have loved you, or thought
she loved you. Do you dare to tell me that?â

âI do not say that,â Bellairs answered hopelessly.

âOf course not. The idea is so absurd.
[207]

Clarice—oh! how can you talk like this? And
if I am only an echo, as you call it, how can you
say you care for me, care for another woman's
shadow? You do not love me.â

âI do—with all my heart.â

âAnd yet you say I am nothing, that I have
not even a heart of my own, that I love or hate at
the will of another.â

âForgive me, forgive me! I don't know what
I say. I only know I love you.â

Her face softened.

âAnd you deserve to be loved,â she said; âbut
I—it is so horrible—I cannot!â

Suddenly Bellairs caught her in his arms.

âYou shall,â he exclaimed, âyou shall. I will
make you.â But she pushed him back with a
strange strength, and her face hardened till he
scarcely recognised it.

âDon't do that—don't touch me—or you'll
make me hate you,â she said vehemently.

Bellairs let her go. At that moment there was
a step on the deck. Clarice appeared. She did
not seem to notice that anything was wrong. She
smiled.

âIsn't it sad, Mr Bellairs,â she said, âwe sail
to-morrow. I love Luxor. I can't bear to leave it.â

Bellairs suddenly turned and hurried away. He
could no longer trust himself. There was blood
before his eyes.

[208]

It was dawn. The Nile was smooth as a river
of oil. Light mists rolled upwards gently, discovering
the rosy flanks of the Libyan mountains to
the sun. The sky began to glimmer with a dancing
golden heat. On the brown bank where the
boats lie in the shadow a man stood alone. His
hands were tightly clenched. His lips worked
silently. His eyes were fixed in a stare. And
away in the distance up river, a tiny trail of smoke
floated towards Luxor. It came from a steam tug
that drew a following dahabeeyah.

The
Queen Hatasoo
was on her voyage to
Assouan.

[209]

[210]

[211]

THE FACE OF THE MONK

I

â
No
, it will not hurt him to see you,â the doctor
said to me; âand I have no doubt he will recognise
you. He is the quietest patient I have ever had
under my care—gentle, kind, agreeable, perfect
in conduct, and yet quite mad. You know him
well?â

âHe was my dearest friend,â I said. âBefore
I went out to America three years ago we were
inseparable. Doctor, I cannot believe that he is
mad, he—Hubert Blair—one of the cleverest
young writers in London, so brilliant, so acute!
Wild, if you like, a libertine perhaps, a strange
mixture of the intellectual and the sensual—but
mad! I can't believe it!â

âNot when I tell you that he was brought to me
suffering from acute religious mania?â

âReligious! Hubert Blair!â

âYes. He tried to destroy himself, declaring
that he was unfit to live, that he was a curse to
some person unknown. He protested that each
deed of his affected this unknown person, that his
sins were counted as the sins of another, and that
this other had haunted him—would haunt him
for ever.â

[212]

The doctor's words troubled me.

âTake me to him,â I said at last. âLeave us
together.â

It was a strange, sad moment when I entered the
room in which Hubert was sitting. I was painfully
agitated. He knew me, and greeted me warmly.
I sat down opposite to him.

There was a long silence. Hubert looked away
into the fire. He saw, I think, traced in scarlet
flames, the scenes he was going to describe to me;
and I, gazing at him, wondered of what nature
the change in my friend might be. That he had
changed since we were together three years ago
was evident, yet he did not look mad. His dark,
clean-shaven young face was still passionate. The
brown eyes were still lit with a certain devouring
eagerness. The mouth had not lost its mingled
sweetness and sensuality. But Hubert was curiously
transformed. There was a dignity, almost
an elevation, in his manner. His former gaiety had
vanished. I knew, without words, that my friend
was another man—very far away from me now.
Yet once we had lived together as chums, and had
no secrets the one from the other.

At last Hubert looked up and spoke.

âI see you are wondering about me,â he said.

âYes.â

âI have altered, of course—completely
altered.â

[213]

âYes,â I said, awkwardly enough. âWhy is
that?â

I longed to probe this madness of his that I
might convince myself of it, otherwise Hubert's
situation must for ever appal me.

He answered quietly, âI will tell you—nobody
else knows—and even you may—â

He hesitated, then he said:—

âNo, you will believe it.â

âYes, if you tell me it is true.â

âIt is absolutely true.

âBernard, you know what I was when you left
England for America—gay, frivolous in my
pleasures, although earnest when I was working.
You know how I lived to sound the depths of
sensation, how I loved to stretch all my mental and
physical capacities to the snapping-point, how I
shrank from no sin that could add one jot or tittle
to my knowledge of the mind of any man or
woman who interested me. My life seemed a full
life then. I moved in the midst of a thousand
intrigues. I strung beads of all emotions upon my
rosary, and told them until at times my health
gave way. You remember my recurring periods
of extraordinary and horrible mental depression—when
life was a demon to me, and all my success in
literature less than nothing; when I fancied myself
hated, and could believe I heard phantom voices
abusing me. Then those fits passed away, and
once more I lived as ardently as ever, the most
[214]

persistent worker, and the most persistent excitement-seeker
in London.

âWell, after you went away I continued my
career. As you know, my success increased.
Through many sins I had succeeded in diving very
deep into human hearts of men and women. Often
I led people deliberately away from innocence in
order that I might observe the gradual transformation
of their natures. Often I spurred them on to
follies that I might see the effect our deeds have
upon our faces—the seal our actions set upon
our souls. I was utterly unscrupulous, and yet I
thought myself good-hearted. You remember that
my servants always loved me, that I attracted people.
I can say this to you. For some time my
usual course was not stayed. Then—I recollect
it was in the middle of the London season—one
of my horrible fits of unreasonable melancholy
swept over me. It stunned my soul like a heavy
blow. It numbed me. I could not go about. I
could not bear to see anybody. I could only shut
myself up and try to reason myself back into my
usual gaiety and excitement. My writing was put
aside. My piano was locked. I tried to read, but
even that solace was denied to me. My attention was
utterly self-centred, riveted upon my own condition.

âWhy, I said to myself, am I the victim of this
despair, this despair without a cause? What is
this oppression which weighs me down without
reason? It attacks me abruptly, as if it were sent
[215]

to me by some power, shot at me like an arrow by
an enemy hidden in the dark. I am well—I am
gay. Life is beautiful and wonderful to me. All
that I do interests me. My soul is full of vitality.
I know that I have troops of friends, that I am
loved and thought of by many people. And then
suddenly the arrow strikes me. My soul is
wounded and sickens to death. Night falls over
me, night so sinister that I shudder when its twilight
comes. All my senses faint within me. Life
is at once a hag, weary, degraded, with tears on
her cheeks and despair in her hollow eyes. I feel
that I am deserted, that my friends despise me, that
the world hates me, that I am less than all other
men—less in powers, less in attraction—that I
am the most crawling, the most grovelling of all
the human species, and that there is no one who
does not know it. Yet the doctors say I am not
physically ill, and I know that I am not mad.
Whence does this awful misery, this unmeaning,
causeless horror of life and of myself come? Why
am I thus afflicted?

âOf course I could find no answer to all these
old questions, which I had asked many times before.
But this time, Bernard, my depression was
more lasting, more overwhelming than usual. I
grew terribly afraid of it. I thought I might be
driven to suicide. One day a crisis seemed to
come. I dared no longer remain alone, so I put
on my hat and coat, took my stick, and hurried
[216]

out, without any definite intention. I walked
along Piccadilly, avoiding the glances of those
whom I met. I fancied they could all read the
agony, the degradation of my soul. I turned into
Bond Street, and suddenly I felt a strong inclination
to stop before a certain door. I obeyed the
impulse, and my eyes fell on a brass plate, upon
which was engraved these words:—

Vane.

Clairvoyant.

11 till 4 daily.

âI remember I read them several times over,
and even repeated them in a whisper to myself.
Why? I don't know. Then I turned away, and
was about to resume my walk. But I could not.
Again I stopped and read the legend on the brass
plate. On the right-hand side of the door was an
electric bell. I put my finger on it and pressed
the button inwards. The door opened, and I
walked, like a man in a dream, I think, up a flight
of narrow stairs. At the top of them was a second
door, at which a maidservant was standing.

ââYou want to see Mr Vane, sir?â

ââYes. Can I?â

ââIf you will come in, sir, I will see.â

âShe showed me into a commonplace, barely-furnished
little room, and, after a short period of
waiting, summoned me to another, in which stood
a tall, dark youth, dressed in a gown rather like a
[217]

college gown. He bowed to me, and I silently
returned the salutation. The servant left us. Then
he said:—

ââYou wish me to exert my powers for you?â

ââYes.â

ââWill you sit here?â

âHe motioned me to a seat beside a small round
table, sat down opposite to me, and took my hand.
After examining it through a glass, and telling my
character fairly correctly by the lines in it, he laid
the glass down and regarded me narrowly.

ââYou suffer terribly from depression,â he said.

ââThat is true.â

âHe continued to gaze upon me more and more
fixedly. At length he said:—

ââDo you know that everybody has a companion?â

ââHow—a companion?â

ââSomebody incessantly with them, somebody
they cannot see.â

ââYou believe in the theory of guardian angels?â

ââI do not say these companions are always
guardian angels. I see your companion now, as I
look at you. His face is by your shoulder.â

âI started, and glanced hastily round; but, of
course, could see nothing.

ââShall I describe him?â

ââYes,â I said.

â'His face is dark, like yours; shaven, like
yours. He has brown eyes, just as brown as
[218]

yours are. His mouth and his chin are firm and
small, as firm and small as yours.'

ââHe must be very like me.â

ââHe is. But there is a difference between
you.â

ââWhat is it?â

ââHis hair is cut more closely than yours, and
part of it is shaved off.â

ââHe is a priest, then?â

ââHe wears a cowl. He is a monk.â

ââA monk! But why does he come to me?â

ââI should say that he cannot help it, that he is
your spirit in some former state. Yesâ—and he
stared at me till his eyes almost mesmerised me—âyou
must have been a monk once.â

ââI—a monk! Impossible! Even if I have
lived on earth before, it could never have been as a
monk.â

ââHow do you know that?â

ââBecause I am utterly without superstitions,
utterly free from any lingering desire for an ascetic
life. That existence of silence, of ignorance, of
perpetual prayer, can never have been mine.â

ââYou cannot tell,â was all his answer.

II

âWhen I left Bond Street that afternoon I was
full of disbelief. However, I had paid my half-
[219]
guinea
and escaped from my own core of misery
for a quarter of an hour. That was something.
I didn't regret my visit to this man Vane, whom
I regarded as an agreeable charlatan. For a
moment he had interested me. For a moment he
had helped me to forget my useless wretchedness.
I ought to have been grateful to him. And, as
always, my soul regained its composure at last.
One morning I awoke and said to myself that I
was happy. Why? I did not know. But I got
up. I was able to write once more. I was able
to play. I felt that I had friends who loved me
and a career before me. I could again look people
in the face without fear. I could even feel a certain
delightful conceit of mind and body. Bernard,
I was myself. So I thought, so I knew. And
yet, as days went by, I caught myself often thinking
of this invisible, tonsured, and cowled companion
of mine, whom Vane had seen, whom I
did not see. Was he indeed with me? And, if
so, had he thoughts, had he the holy thoughts of
a spirit that has renounced the world and all
fleshly things? Did he still keep that cloistered
nature which is at home with silence, which aspires,
and prays, and lives for possible eternity,
instead of for certain time? Did he still hold
desolate vigils? Did he still scourge himself along
the thorny paths of faith? And, if he did, how
must he regard me?

âI remember one night especially how this last
[220]

thought was with me in a dreary house, where I
sinned, and where I dissected a heart.

âAnd I trembled as if an eye was upon me.
And I went home.

âYou will say that my imagination is keen, and
that I gave way to it. But wait and hear the
end.

âThis definite act of mine—this, my first conscious
renunciation—did not tend, as you might
suppose, to the peace of my mind. On the contrary,
I found myself angry, perturbed, as I analysed
the cause of my warfare with self. I have
naturally a supreme hatred of all control. Liberty
is my fetish. And now I had offered a sacrifice
to a prisoning unselfishness, to a false god that
binds and gags its devotees. I was angry, and I
violently resumed my former course. But now I
began to be ceaselessly companioned by uneasiness,
by a furtive cowardice that was desolating. I felt
that I was watched, and by some one who suffered
when I sinned, who shrank and shuddered when I
followed where my desires led.

âIt was the monk.

âSoon I gave to him a most definite personality.
I endowed him with a mind and with moods. I
imagined not only a heart for him, but a voice,
deep with a certain ecclesiastical beauty, austere,
with a note more apt for denunciation than for
praise. His face was my own face, but with an
expression not mine, elevated, almost fanatical, yet
[221]

nobly beautiful; praying eyes—and mine were
only observant; praying lips—and mine were but
sensitively sensual. And he was haggard with
abstinence, while I—was I not often haggard with
indulgence? Yes, his face was mine, and not
mine. It seemed the face of a great saint who
might have been a great sinner. Bernard, that is
the most attractive face in all the world. Accustoming
myself thus to a thought-companion, I at
length—for we men are so inevitably materialistic—embodied
him, gave to him hands, feet, a figure,
all—as before, mine, yet not mine, a sort of
saintly replica of my sinfulness. For do not hands,
feet, figure cry our deeds as the watchman cries the
hour in the night?

âSo, I had the man. There he stood in my
vision as you are now.

âYes, he was there; but only when I sinned.

âWhen I worked and yielded myself up to the
clear assertion of my intellect, when I fought to
give out the thoughts that lingered like reluctant
fish far down in the deep pools of my mind, when
I wrestled for beauty of diction and for nameless
graces of expression, when I was the author, I
could not see him.

âBut when I was the man, and lived the fables
that I was afterwards to write, then he was with
me. And his face was as the face of one who is
wasted with grey grief.

âHe came to me when I sinned, as if by my
[222]

sins I did him grave injury. And, allowing my
imagination to range wildly, as you will say, I grew
gradually to feel as if each sin did indeed strike a
grievous blow upon his holy nature.

âThis troubled me at last. I found myself continually
brooding over the strange idea. I was
aware that if my friends could know I entertained
it, they would think me mad. And yet I often
fancied that thought moved me in the direction of
a sanity more perfect, more desirable than my
sanity of self-indulgence. Sometimes even I said
to myself that I would reorganise my life, that I
would be different from what I had been. And
then, again, I laughed at my folly of the imagination,
and cursed that clairvoyant of Bond Street,
who made a living by trading upon the latent
imbecility of human nature. Yet, the desire of
change, of soul-transformation, came and lingered,
and the vision of the monk's worn young face
was often with me. And whenever, in my waking
dreams, I looked upon it, I felt that a time might
come when I could pray and weep for the wild
catalogue of my many sins.

âBernard, at last the day came when I left
England. I had long wished to travel. I had
grown tired of the hum of literary cliques, and the
jargon of that deadly parasite called âmodernity.â
Praise fainted, and lay like a corpse before my
mind. I was sick of gaiety. It seemed to me
[223]

that London was stifling my powers, narrowing
my outlook, barring out real life from me with its
moods and its fashions, and its idols of the hour,
and its heroes of a day, who are the traitors of the
day's night.

âSo I went away.

âAnd now I come to the part of my story that
you may find it hard to believe. Yet it is true.

âOne day, in my wanderings, I came to a
monastery. I remember the day well. It was an
afternoon of early winter, and I was
en route
to a
warm climate. But to gain my climate, and
snatch a vivid contrast such as I love, I toiled over
a gaunt and dreary pass, presided over by heavy,
beetling-browed mountains. I rode upon a mule,
attended only by my manservant and by a taciturn
guide who led a baggage-mule. Slowly we wound,
by thin paths, among the desolate crags, which
sprang to sight in crowds at each turn of the way,
pressing upon us, like dead faces of Nature, the
corpses of things we call inanimate, but which had
surely once lived. For the earth is alive, and gives
life. But these mountains were now utterly dead.
These grey, petrified countenances of the hills subdued
my soul. The pattering shuffle of the mules
woke an occasional echo, and even an echo I hated.
For the environing silence was immense, and I
wished to steep myself in it. As we still ascended,
in the waste winter afternoon, towards the hour of
twilight, snow—the first snow of the season
[224]
—began
to fall. I watched the white vision of the
flakes against the grey vision of the crags, and I
thought that this path, which I had chosen as my
road to Summer, was like the path by which holy
men slowly gain Paradise, treading difficult ways
through life that they may attain at last those
eternal roses which bloom beyond the granite and
the snows. Up and up I rode, into the clouds and
the night, into the veil of the world, into the icy
winds of the heights. An eagle screamed above
my head, poised like a black shadow in the opaque
gloom. That flying life was the only life in this
waste.

âAnd then my mule, edging ever to the precipice
as a man to his fate, sidled round a promontory
of rock and set its feet in snow. For we had
passed the snow-line. And upon the snow lay
thin spears of yellow light. They streamed from
the lattices of the monastery which crowns the very
summit of the pass.

III

âAt this monastery I was to spend the night.
The good monks entertain all travellers, and in
summer-time their hospitalities are lavishly exercised.
But in winter, wanderers are few, and
these holy men are left almost undisturbed in their
meditative solitudes. My mule paused upon a
[225]

rocky plateau before the door of the narrow grey
building. The guide struck upon the heavy wood.
After a while we were admitted by a robed figure,
who greeted us kindly and made us welcome.
Within, the place was bare and poor enough, but
scrupulously clean. I was led through long, broad,
and bitterly cold corridors to a big chamber in
which I was to pass the night. Here were ranged
in a row four large beds with white curtains. I
occupied one bed, my servant another. The rest
were untenanted. The walls were lined with
light wood. The wooden floor was uncarpeted.
I threw open the narrow window. Dimly I could
see a mountain of rocks, on which snow lay in
patches, towering up into the clouds in front of
me. And to the left there was a glimmer of water.
On the morrow, by that water, I should ride down
into the land of flowers to which I was bound.
Till then I would allow my imagination to luxuriate
in the bleak romance of this wild home of
prayer. The pathos of the night, shivering in the
snow, and of this brotherhood of aspiring souls,
detached from the excitement of the world for
ever, seeking restlessly their final salvation day by
day, night by night, in clouds of mountain vapour
and sanctified incense, entered into my soul. And
I thought of that imagined companion of mine.
If he were with me now, surely he would feel that
he had led me to his home at length. Surely he
would secretly long to remain here.

[226]

âI smiled, as I said to myself—âMonk, to-morrow,
if, indeed, you are fated to be my eternal
attendant, you must come with me from this cold
station of the cross down into the sunshine, where
the blood of men is hot, where passions sing
among the vineyards, where the battle is not of
souls but of flowers. To-morrow you must come
with me. But to-night be at peace!â

âAnd I smiled to myself again as I fancied that
my visionary companion was glad.

âThen I went down into the refectory.

âThat night, before I retired to my room of
the four beds, I asked if I might go into the chapel
of the monastery. My request was granted. I
shall never forget the curious sensation which
overtook me as my guide led me down some steps
past a dim, little, old, painted window set in the
wall, to the chapel. That there should be a
church here, that the deep tones of an organ
should ever sound among these rocks and clouds,
that the Host should be elevated and the censer
swung, and litanies and masses be chanted amid
these everlasting snows, all this was wonderful and
quickening to me. When we reached the chapel,
I begged my kind guide to leave me for a while.
I longed to meditate alone. He left me, and instinctively
I sank down upon my knees.

âI could just hear the keening of the wind outside.
A dim light glimmered near the altar, and
in one of the oaken stalls I saw a bent form pray
[227]
ing.
I knelt a long time. I did not pray. At
first I scarcely thought definitely. Only, I received
into my heart the strange, indelible impression of
this wonderful place; and, as I knelt, my eyes
were ever upon that dark praying figure near to
me. By degrees I imagined that a wave of sympathy
flowed from it to me, that in this monk's
devotions my name was not forgotten.

ââWhat absurd tricks our imaginations can play
us!â you will say.

âI grew to believe that he prayed for me, there,
under the dim light from the tall tapers.

âWhat blessing did he ask on me? I could
not tell; but I longed that his prayer might be
granted.

âAnd then, Bernard, at last he rose. He lifted
his face from his hands and stood up. Something
in his figure seemed so strangely familiar to me, so
strangely that, on a sudden, I longed, I craved to
see his face.

âHe seemed about to retreat through a side
door near to the altar; then he paused, appeared to
hesitate, then came down the chapel towards me.
As he drew near to me—I scarcely knew why—but
I hid my face deep in my hands, with a dreadful
sense of overwhelming guilt which dyed my
cheeks with blood. I shrank—I cowered. I
trembled and was afraid. Then I felt a gentle
touch on my shoulder. I looked up into the face
of the monk.

[228]

âBernard, it was the face of my invisible companion—it
was my own face.

âThe monk looked down into my eyes searchingly.
He recoiled.

ââ
Mon dÃ©mon!
â he whispered in French.
â
Mon dÃ©mon!
â

âFor a moment he stood still, like one appalled.
Then he turned and abruptly quitted the chapel.

âI started up to follow him, but something held
me back. I let him go, and I listened to hear if
his tread sounded upon the chapel floor as a human
footstep, if his robe rustled as he went.

âYes. Then he was, indeed, a living man, and
it was a human voice which had reached my ears,
not a voice of imagination. He was a living man,
this double of my body, this antagonist of my soul,
this being who called me demon, who fled from
me, who, doubtless, hated me. He was a living
man.

âI could not sleep that night. This encounter
troubled me. I felt that it had a meaning for me
which I must discover, that it was not chance
which had led me to take this cold road to the
sunshine. Something had bound me with an invisible
thread, and led me up here into the clouds,
where already I—or the likeness of me—dwelt,
perhaps had been dwelling for many years. I had
looked upon my living wraith, and my living wraith
had called me demon.

âHow could I sleep?

[229]

âVery early I got up. The dawn was bitterly
cold, but the snow had ceased, though a coating
of ice covered the little lake. How delicate was
the dawn here! The gathering, growing light fell
upon the rocks, upon the snow, upon the ice of
the lake, upon the slate walls of the monastery.
And upon each it lay with a pretty purity, a thin
refinement, an austerity such as I had never seen
before. So, even Nature, it seemed, was purged
by the continual prayers of these holy men. She,
too, like men, has her lusts, and her hot passions,
and her wrath of warfare. She, too, like men, can
be edified and tended into grace. Nature among
these heights was a virgin, not a wanton, a fit companion
for those who are dedicated to virginity.

âI dressed by the window, and went out to see
the entrance of the morning. There was nobody
about. I had to find my own way. But when I
had gained the refectory, I saw a monk standing
by the door.

âIt was my wraith waiting for me.

âSilently he went before me to the great door
of the building. He opened it, and we stepped
out upon the rocky plateau on which the snow
lay thickly. He closed the door behind us, and
motioned me to attend him among the rocks till
we were out of sight of the monastery. Then he
stopped, and we faced one another, still without a
word, the grey light of the wintry dawn clothing
us so wearily, so plaintively.

[230]

âWe gazed at each other, dark face to dark
face, brown eyes to brown eyes. The monk's
pale hands, my hands, were clenched. The
monk's strong lips, my lips, were set. The two
souls looked upon each other, there, in the dawn.

âAnd then at last he spoke in French, and with
the beautiful voice I knew.

ââWhence have you come?â he said.

ââFrom England, father.â

ââFrom England? Then you live! you live.
You are a man, as I am! And I have believed
you to be a spirit, some strange spirit of myself,
lost to my control, interrupting my prayers with
your cries, interrupting my sleep with your desires.
You are a man like myself?â

âHe stretched out his hand and touched mine.

ââYes; it is indeed so,â he murmured.

ââAnd you,â I said in my turn, âare no spirit.
Yet, I, too, believed you to be a wraith of myself,
interrupting my sins with your sorrow, interrupting
my desires with your prayers. I have seen you.
I have imagined you. And now I find you live.
What does it mean? For we are as one and yet
not as one.â

ââWe are as two halves of a strangely-mingled
whole,â he answered. âDo you know what you
have done to me?â

ââNo, father.â

ââListen,â he said. âWhen a boy I dedicated
myself to God. Early, early I dedicated myself,
[231]

so that I might never know sin. For I had heard
that the charm of sin is so great and so terrible
that, once it is known, once it is felt, it can never
be forgotten. And so it can make the holiest life
hideous with its memories. It can intrude into
the very sanctuary like a ghost, and murmur its
music with the midnight mass. Even at the elevation
of the Host will it be present, and stir the
heart of the officiator to longing so keen that it
is like the Agony of the Garden, the Agony of
Christ. There are monks here who weep because
they dare not sin, who rage secretly like beasts—because
they will not sin.â

âHe paused. The grey light grew over the
mountains.

ââKnowing this, I resolved that I would never
know sin, lest I, too, should suffer so horribly. I
threw myself at once into the arms of God. Yet
I have suffered—how I have suffered!â

âHis face was contorted, and his lips worked.
I stood as if under a spell, my eyes upon his face.
I had only the desire to hear him. He went on,
speaking now in a voice roughened by emotion:

ââFor I became like these monks. Youâ—and
he pointed at me with outstretched fingers—'you,
my wraith, made in my very likeness, were
surely born when I was born, to torment me.
For, while I have prayed, I have been conscious
of your neglect of prayer as if it were my own.
When I have believed, I have been conscious of
[232]

your unbelief as if it were my own. Whatever I
have feebly tried to do for God, has been marred
and defaced by all that you have left undone. I have
wrestled with you; I have tried to hold you back; I
have tried to lead you with me where I want to go,
where I must go. All these years I have tried, all
these years I have striven. But it has seemed as if
God did not choose it. When you have been sinning,
I have been agonising. I have lain upon the
floor of my cell in the night, and I have torn at
my evil heart. For—sometimes—I have longed—how
I have longed!—to sin your sin.'

âHe crossed himself. Sudden tears sprang into
his eyes.

ââI have called you my demon,â he cried. âBut
you are my cross. Oh, brother, will you not be
my crown?â

âHis eyes, shadowed with tears, gazed down
into mine. Bernard, in that moment, I understood
all—my depression, my unreasoning despair, the
fancied hatred of others, even my few good impulses,
all came from him, from this living holy
wraith of my evil self.

ââWill you not be my crown?â he said.

âBernard, there, in the snow, I fell at his feet.
I confessed to him. I received his absolution.

âAnd, as the light of the dawn grew strong
upon the mountains, he, my other self, my wraith,
blessed me.â

[233]

There was a long silence between us. Then
I said:—

âAnd now?â

âAnd now you know why I have changed.
That day, as I went down into the land of the
sunshine, I made a vow.â

âA vow?â

âYes; to be his crown, not his cross. I soon
returned to England. At first I was happy, and
then one day my old evil nature came upon me
like a giant. I fell again into sin, and, even as I
sinned, I saw his face looking into mine, Bernard,
pale, pale to the lips, and with eyes—such sad
eyes of reproach! Then I thought I was not fit
to live, and I tried to kill myself. They saved me,
and brought me here.â

âYes; and now, Hubert?â

âNow,â he said, âI am so happy. God surely
placed me here where I cannot sin. The days
pass and the nights, and they are stainless. And
he—he comes by night and blesses me. I live
for him now, and see always the grey walls of his
monastery, his face which shall, at last, be completely
mine.â

âGood-bye,â the doctor said to me as I got into
the carriage to drive back to the station. âYes,
he is perfectly happy, happier in his mania, I
believe, than you or I in our sanity.â

I drove away from that huge home of madness,
[234]

set in the midst of lovely gardens in a smiling
landscape, and I pondered those last words of the
doctor's:—

âYou and I—in our sanity.â

And, thinking of the peace that lay on Hubert's
face, I compared the so-called mad of the world
with the so-called sane—and wondered.

[235]

[236]

[237]

THE MAN WHO INTERVENED

I

The
atmosphere of the room in which Sergius
Blake was sitting seemed to him strange and
cold. As he looked round it, he could imagine
that a light mist invaded it stealthily, like miasma
rising from some sinister marsh. There was surely
a cloud about the electric light that gleamed in
the ceiling, a cloud sweeping in feathery, white
flakes across the faces of the pictures upon the
wall. Even the familiar furniture seemed to loom
out faintly, with a gaunt and grotesque aspect,
from shadows less real, yet more fearful, than any
living form could be.

Sergius stared round him slowly, pressing his
strong lips together. When he concentrated his
gaze upon any one thing—a table, a sofa, a chair—the
cloud faded, and the object stood out clearly
before his eyes. Yet always the rest of the room
seemed to lie in mist and in shadows. He knew
that this dim atmosphere did not really exist, that
it was projected by his mind. Yet it troubled
him, and added a dull horror to his thoughts, which
moved again and again, in persistent promenade,
round one idea.

[238]

The hour was seven o'clock of an autumn
night. Darkness lay over London, and rain made
a furtive music on roofs and pavements. Sergius
Blake listened to the drops upon the panes of his
windows. They seemed to beckon him forth, to
tell him that it was time to exchange thought for
action. He had come to a definite and tremendous
resolution. He must now carry it out.

He got up slowly from his chair, and with the
movement the mist seemed to gather itself together
in the room and to disappear. It passed away,
evaporating among the pictures and ornaments,
the prayer-rugs and divans. A clearness and an
insight came to Sergius. He stood still by the
piano, on which he rested one hand lightly, and
listened. The rain-drops pattered close by. Beyond
them rose the dull music of the evening
traffic of New Bond Street, in which thoroughfare
he lived. As he stood thus at attention, his young
and handsome face seemed carved in stone. His
lips were set in a hard and straight line. His
dark-grey eyes stared, like eyes in a photograph.
The muscles of his long-fingered hands were tense
and knotted. He was in evening dress, and had
been engaged to dine in Curzon Street; but he
had written a hasty note to say he was ill and
could not come. Another appointment claimed
him. He had made it for himself.

Presently, lifting his hand from the piano, he
took up a small leather case from a table that
[239]

stood near, opened it, and drew out a revolver.
He examined it carefully. Two chambers were
loaded. They would be enough. He put on his
long overcoat, and slipped the revolver into his
left breast pocket. His heart could beat against
it there.

Each time his heart pulsed, Sergius seemed to
hear the silence of another heart.

And now, though his mind was quite clear, and
the mists and shadows had slunk away, his familiar
room looked very peculiar to him. The very chair
in which he generally sat wore the aspect of a
stranger. Was the wall paper really blue? Sergius
went close up to it and examined it narrowly,
and then he drew back and laughed softly, like a
child. In the sound of his laugh irresponsibility
chimed. âWhat is the cab fare to Phillimore
Place, Kensington?â he thought, searching in his
waistcoat pocket. âHalf a crown?â He put
the coin carefully in the ticket pocket of his overcoat,
buttoned the coat up slowly, took his hat and
stick, and drew on a pair of lavender gloves. Just
then a new thought seemed to strike him and he
glanced down at his hands.

âLavender gloves for such a deed!â he murmured.
For a moment he paused irresolute, even
partially unbuttoned them. But then he smiled
and shook his head. In some way the gloves
would not be wholly inappropriate. Sergius cast
one final glance round the room.

[240]

âWhen I stand here again,â he said aloud, âI
shall be a criminal—a criminal!â

He repeated the last word, as if trying thoroughly
to realise its meaning.

Then he opened the door swiftly and went out
on to the staircase.

Just as he was putting a hasty foot upon the first
stair, a man out in the street touched his electric
bell. Its thin tingling cry made Sergius start and
hesitate. In the semi-twilight he waited, his hands
deep in his pockets, his silk hat tilted slightly over
his eyes. The porter tramped along the passage
below. The hall door opened, and a deep and
strong voice asked, rather anxiously and breathlessly:—

âIs Mr. Blake at home?â

âI rather think he's gone out, sir.â

âNo—surely—how long ago?â

âI don't know, sir. He may be in. I'll see.â

âDo—do—quickly. If he's in, say I must
see him—Mr Endover. But you know my
name.â

âYes, sir.â

The porter, mounting the stone staircase, suddenly
came upon Sergius standing there like a
stone figure.

âLord, sir!â he ejaculated. âYou give me a
start!â His voice was loud from astonishment.

âHush!â Sergius whispered. âGo down at
once and say that I've gone out!â

[241]

The man turned to obey, but Anthony Endover
was half-way up the stairs.

âIt's all right,â he exclaimed, as he met the
porter.

He had passed him in an instant and arrived at
the place where Sergius was standing.

âSergius,â he cried, and there was a great music
of relief in his voice. âHulloa! Now you're
not going out.â

âYes, I am, Anthony.â

âBut I want to talk to you tremendously.
Where are you going?â

âTo dine with the Venables in Curzon Street.â

âI met young Venables just now, and he said
you'd written that you were ill and couldn't come.
He asked me to fill your place.â

Sergius muttered a âDamn!â under his breath.

âWell, come in for a minute,â he said, attempting
no excuse.

He turned round slowly and re-entered his flat,
followed by Endover.

II

For some years Endover had been Sergius Blake's
close friend. They had left Eton at the same
time; had been at Oxford together. Their intimacy,
born in the playing fields, grew out of its
cricket and football stage as their minds developed,
[242]

and the world of thought opened like a holy of
holies—beyond the world of action. They both
passed behind the veil, but Anthony went farther
than Sergius. Yet this slight separation did not
lead to alienation, but merely caused the admiration
of Sergius for his friend to be mingled with respect.
He looked up to Anthony. Recognising that his
friend's mind was more thoughtful than his own,
while his passions were far stronger than Anthony's,
he grew to lean upon Anthony, to claim his advice
sometimes, to follow it often. Anthony was his
mentor, and thought he knew instinctively all the
workings of Sergius' mind and all the possibilities
of his nature. The mother of Sergius was a Russian
and a great heiress. Soon after he left Oxford,
she died. His father had been killed by an
accident when he was a child. So he was rich,
free, young, in London, with no one to look after
him, until Anthony Endover, who had meanwhile
taken orders, was attached as fourth—or fifth—curate
to a smart West End church, and came
to live in lodgings in George Street, Hanover
Square.

Then, as Sergius laughingly said, he had a father
confessor on the premises. Yet to-night he had
bidden his porter to tell a lie in order to keep his
father confessor out. The lie had been vain.
Sergius led the way morosely into his drawing-room,
and turned on the light. Anthony walked up
to the fire, and stretched his tall athletic figure in
[243]

its long ebon coat. His firm throat rose out of a
jam-pot collar, but his thin, strongly-marked face
rather suggested an intellectual Hercules than a
Mayfair parson, and neither his voice nor his
manner was tinged with what so many people
consider the true clericalism.

For all that he was a splendid curate, as his
rector very well knew.

Now he stood by the fire for a minute in silence,
while Sergius moved uneasily about the room.
Presently Anthony turned round.

âIt's beastly wet,â he said in a melodious ringing
voice. âThe black dog is on me to-night,
Sergius.â

âOh!â

âYou don't want to go out, really,â Anthony
continued, looking narrowly at his friend's curiously
rigid face.

âYes, I do.â

âNot to Curzon Street. They've filled up
your place. I told Venables to ask Hugh Graham.
I knew he was disengaged to-night. Besides—you're
seedy.â

Sergius frowned.

âI'm all right again now,â he said coldly, âand
I particularly wished to go. You needn't have
been so deuced anxious to make the number right.â

âWell, it's done now. And I can't say I'm
sorry, because I want to have a talk with you. I
say, Serge, take off those lavender gloves, pull off
[244]

your coat, let's send out for some dinner, and have
a comfortable evening together in here. I've had
a hard day's work, and I want a rest.â

âI must go out presently.â

âAfter dinner then.â

âBefore ten o'clock.â

âSay eleven.â

âNo—that's too late.â

A violent, though fleeting expression of anxiety
crossed Endover's face. Then, with a smile, he
said:—

âAll right. Shall I ring the bell and order
some dinner to be sent in from Galton's?â

âIf you like. I'm not hungry.â

âI am.â

Anthony summoned the servant and gave the
order. Then he turned again to Sergius.

âHere, I'll help you off with your coat,â he said.

But Sergius moved away.

âNo thanks, I'll do it. There are some cigarettes
on the mantelpiece.â

Anthony went to get one. As he was taking it,
he looked into the mirror over the fireplace, and
saw Sergius—while removing his overcoat—transfer
something from it to the left breast
pocket of his evening coat.

He wanted still to feel his heart beat against
that tiny weapon, still to hear—with each pulse
of his own heart—the silence, not yet alive, but
so soon to be alive, of that other heart.

[245]

And, as Anthony glanced into the mirror, he
said to himself, âI was right!â

He withdrew his eyes from the glass and lit his
cigarette. Sergius joined him.

âI'm in the blues to-night,â Anthony said, puffing
at his cigarette.

âAre you?â

âYes—been down in the East End. The
misery there is ghastly.â

âIt's just as bad in the West End, only different
in kind. You're smoking your cigarette all
down one side.â

Anthony took it out of his mouth and threw it
into the grate. He lit two or three matches, but
held them so badly that they went out before he
could ignite another cigarette. At last, inwardly
cursing his nerves that made his hasty actions belie
the determined calm of his face, he dropped the
cigarette.

âI don't think I'll smoke before dinner,â he
said. âAh, here it is. And wine—champagne—that's
good for you!â

âI shan't drink it. I hate to drink alone.â

âYou shan't drink alone then.â

âWhat d'you mean?â

âI'll drink with you.â

âBut you're a teetotaller.â

âI don't care to-night.â

Anthony spoke briefly and firmly. Sergius was
amazed.

[246]

âWhat!â he said. âYou're going to break
your vow? You a parson!â

âSometimes salvation lies in the breaking of a
vow,â Anthony answered as they sat down.
âHave you never registered a silent vow?â

Sergius looked at him hard in the eyes.

âYes,â he said; and in his voice there was the
hint of a thrilling note. âBut I shan't—I
shouldn't break it.â

âI've known a soul saved alive by the breaking
of a vow,â Anthony answered. âGive me some
champagne.â

Sergius—wondering, as much as the condition of
his mind, possessed by one idea, would allow—filled
his friend's glass. Anthony began to eat, with a well-assumed
hunger. Sergius scarcely touched food,
but drank a good deal of wine. The hands of the
big oaken-cased clock that stood in a far corner of
the room crawled slowly upon their round, recurring
tour. Anthony's eyes were often upon them, then
moved with a swift directness that was akin to
passion to the face of Sergius, which was always
strangely rigid, like the painted face of a mask.

âI sat by a woman to-day,â he said presently,
âsat by her in an attic that looked on to a narrow
street full of rain, and watched her die.â

âThis morning?â

âYes.â

âAnd now she's been out of the world seven or
eight hours. Lucky woman!â

[247]

âAh, Sergius, but the mischief, the horror of it
was that she wasn't ready to go, not a bit ready.â

Sergius suddenly smiled, a straight, glaring smile,
over the sparkling champagne that he was lifting
to his lips.

âYes; it's devilish bad for a woman or a—man
to be shot into another world before they're
prepared,â he said. âIt must be—devilish bad.â

âAnd how can we know that any one is
thoroughly prepared?â

Sergius' smile developed into a short laugh.

âIt's easier to be certain who isn't than who
is,â he said.

The eyes of Anthony fled to the clock face
mechanically and returned.

âDeath terrified me to-day, Sergius,â he said;
âand it struck me that the most awful power that
God has given to man is the power of setting death—like
a dog—at another man.â

Sergius swallowed all the wine in his glass at
a gulp. He was no longer smiling. His hand
went up to his left side.

âIt may be awful,â he rejoined; âbut it's
grand. By Heaven! it's magnificent.â

He got up, as if excited, and moved about the
room, while Anthony went on pretending to eat.
After a minute or two Sergius sat down again.

âPower of any kind is a grand thing,â he said.

âOnly power for good.â

âYou're bound to say that; you're a parson.â

[248]

âI only say what I really feel; you know that,
Serge.â

âAh, you don't understand.â

Anthony looked at him with a sudden, strong
significance.

âPart of a parson's profession—the most important
part—is to understand men who aren't
parsons.â

âYou think you understand men?â

âSome men.â

âMe, for instance?â

The question came abruptly, defiantly. Anthony
seemed glad to answer it.

âWell, yes, Sergius; I think I do thoroughly
understand you. My great friendship alone might
well make me do that.â

The face of Sergius grew a little softer in expression,
but he did not assent.

âPerhaps it might blind you,â he said.

âI don't think so.â

âWell, then, now, if you understand me—tell
me—â

Sergius broke off suddenly.

âThis champagne is awfully good,â he said, filling
his glass again.

âWhat were you going to say?â Anthony
asked.

âI don't know—nothing.â

Anthony tried to conceal his disappointment.
Sergius had seemed to be on the verge of over-
[249]
leaping
the barrier which lay between them. Once
that barrier was overleapt, or broken down, Anthony
felt that the mission he had imposed upon himself
would stand a chance of being accomplished, that
his gnawing anxiety would be laid to rest. But
once more Sergius diffused around him a strange
and cold atmosphere of violent and knowing reserve.
He went away from the table and sat down
close to the fire. From there he threw over his
shoulder the remark:—

âNo man or woman ever understands another—really.â

III

Anthony did not reply for a moment and Sergius
continued:—

âYou, for instance, could never guess what I
should do in certain circumstances.â

âSuch as—â

âOh, in a thousand things.â

âI should have a shrewd idea.â

âNo.â

Anthony didn't contradict him, but got up from
the dinner-table and joined him by the fire, glass
in hand.

âI might not let you know how much I guessed,
how much I knew.â

Sergius laughed.

[250]

âOh, ignorance always surrounds itself with
mystery,â he said.

âKnowledge need not go naked.â

Again the eyes of the two friends met in the
firelight, and over the face of Sergius there ran a
new expression. There was an awakening of wonder
in it, but no uneasiness. Anxiety was far away
from him that night. When passion has gripped a
man, passion strong enough, resolute enough, to
over-ride all the prejudices of civilisation, all the
promptings of the coward within us, whose voice,
whining, we name prudence, the semi-comprehension,
the criticism of another man cannot move him.
Sergius wondered for an instant whether Anthony
suspected against what his heart was beating. That
was all.

While he wondered, the clock chimed the half
hour after nine. He heard it.

âI shall have to go very soon,â he said.

âYou can't. Just listen to the rain.â

âRain! What's that got to do with it?â

Sergius spoke with a sudden unutterable contempt.

âRing for another bottle of champagne,â Anthony
replied. âThis one is empty.â

âWell—for a parson and a teetotaller, I must
say!â

Sergius rang the bell. A second bottle was
opened. The servant went out of the room.
As he closed the door, the wind sighed harshly
[251]

against the window panes, driving the rain before
it.

âRough at sea to-night,â Anthony said.

The remark was an obvious one; but, as spoken,
it sounded oddly furtive, and full of hidden meaning.
Sergius evidently found it so, for he said:

âWhy, whom d'you know that's going to sea
to-night?â

Anthony was startled by the quick question, and
replied almost nervously:—

âNobody in particular—why should I?â

âI don't know why, but I think you do.â

âPeople one knows cross the channel every night
almost.â

âOf course,â Sergius said indifferently.

He glanced towards the clock and again mechanically
his hand went up, for a second, to his left
breast. Anthony leaned forward in his chair
quickly, and broke into speech. He had seen the
stare at the clock-face, the gesture.

âIt's strange,â he said, âhow people go out of
our lives, how friends go, and enemies!â

âEnemies!â

âYes. I sometimes wonder which exit is the
sadder. When a friend goes—with him goes, perhaps
for ever, the chance of saying âI am your
friend.â When an enemy goes—â

âWell, what then?â

âWith him goes, perhaps for ever, too, the chance
of saying, âI am not your enemy.ââ

[252]

âPshaw! Parson's talk, Anthony.â

âNo, Sergius, other men forgive besides parsons;
and other men, and parsons too, pass by
their chances of forgiving.â

âYou're a whole Englishman, I'm only half
an Englishman. There's something untamed in
my blood, and I say—damn forgiveness!â

âAnd yet you've forgiven.â

âWhom?â

âOlga Mayne.â

The face of Sergius did not change at the sound
of this name, unless, perhaps, to a more fixed
calm, a more still and pale coldness.

âOlga is punished,â he said. âShe is ruined.â

âHer ruin may be repaired.â

Sergius smiled quietly.

âYou think so?â

âYes. Tell me, Sergiusâ—Anthony spoke
with a strong earnestness, a strong excitement that
he strove to conceal and hold in check—âyou
loved her?â

âYes, I loved her—certainly.â

âYou will always love her?â

âSince I'm not changeable, I daresay I shall.â

Anthony's thin, eager face brightened. A glow
of warmth burned in his eyes and on his cheeks.

âThen you would wish her ruin repaired.â

âShould I?â

âIf you love her, you must.â

âHow could it be repaired?â

[253]

âBy her marriage with—Vernon.â

Anthony's strong voice quivered before he pronounced
the last word, and his eyes were alight
with fervent anxiety. He was looking at Sergius
like a man on the watch for a tremendous outbreak
of emotion. The champagne he had drunk—a
new experience for him since he had taken orders—put
a sort of wild finishing touch to the intensity
of the feelings, under the impulse of which
he had forced himself upon Sergius to-night. He
supposed that his inward excitement must be more
than matched by the so different inward excitement
of his friend. But he—who thought he
understood!—had no true conception of the region
of cold, frosty fury in which Sergius was
living, like a being apart from all other men,
ostracised by the immensity and peculiarity of
his own power of emotion. Therefore he was
astonished when Sergius, with undiminished quietude,
replied:

âOh, with Vernon, that charming man of
fashion, whose very soul, they say, always wears
lavender gloves? You think that would be a
good thing?â

âGood! I don't say that. I say—as the
world is now—the only thing. He is the author
of her fall. He should be her husband.â

âAnd I?â

Anthony stretched out his hand to grasp his
friend's hand, but Sergius suddenly took up his
[254]

champagne glass, and avoided the demonstration of
sympathy.

âYou can be nothing to her now, Serge,â
Anthony said, and his voice quivered with sympathy.

âYou think so? I might be.â

âWhat?â

âOh, not her husband, not her lover, not her
friend.â

âWhat then?â

Sergius avoided answering.

âYou would have her settle down with Vernon
in Phillimore Place?â he said. âPlay the wife to
his noble husband? Well, I know there's been
some idea of that, as I told you yesterday.â

The clock chimed ten. Although Sergius seemed
so calm, so self-possessed, Anthony observed that
now he paid no heed to the little, devilish note of
time. This new subject of conversation had been
Anthony's weapon. Desperately he had used it,
and not, it seemed, altogether in vain.

âYes; as you told me yesterday.â

âAnd it seems good to you?â

âIt seems to me the only thing possible now.â

âThere are generally more possibilities than one
in any given event, I fancy.â

Again Anthony was surprised at the words of Sergius,
who seemed to grow calmer as he grew more
excited, who seemed, to-night, strangely powerful,
not simply in temper, but even in intellect.

[255]

âFor a woman there is sometimes only one
possibility if she is to be saved from ignominy,
Serge.â

âSo you think that Olga Mayne must become
the wife of Vernon, who is a—â

âCoward. Yes.â

At the word coward, Sergius seemed startled
out of his hard calm. He looked swiftly and
searchingly at Anthony.

âWhy do you say coward?â he asked sharply.
âI was not going to use that word.â

Anthony was obviously disconcerted.

âIt came to me,â he said hurriedly.

âWhy?â

âAny man that brings a girl to the dust is a
coward.â

âAh—that's not what you meant,â Sergius
said.

Anthony stole a glance at the clock. The hand
crawled slowly over the quarter of an hour past
ten.

âNo, it was not,â he said slowly.

IV

Sergius got up from his chair and stood by the
fire. He was obviously becoming engrossed by
the conversation. Anthony could at least notice
this with thankfulness.

[256]

âAnthony, I see you've got a fresh knowledge of
Vernon since I was with you yesterday,â Sergius
continued; âsome new knowledge of his nature.â

âPerhaps I have.â

âHow did you get it?â

âDoes that matter?â

âYou have heard of something about him?â

âNo.â

âYou have seen him, then; I say, you have
seen him?â

Anthony hesitated. He pushed the champagne
bottle over towards Sergius. It had been placed on
a little table near the fireplace.

âNo; I don't want to drink. Why on earth
don't you answer me, Anthony?â

âI have always felt that Vernon was a coward.
His conduct to you shows it. He was—or seemed—your
friend. He saw you deeply in love with
this—with Olga. He chose to ruin her after he
knew of your love. Who but a coward could act
in such a way?â

An expression of dark impatience came into the
eyes of Sergius.

âYou are confusing treachery and cowardice,
and you are doing it untruthfully. You have seen
Vernon.â

Anthony thought for a moment, and then said:

âYes, I have.â

âBy chance, of course. Why did you speak
to him?â

[257]

âI thought I would.â

Sergius was obviously disturbed and surprised.
The deeply emotional, yet rigid calm in which he
had been enveloped all the evening was broken at
last. A slight excitement, a distinct surface irritation,
woke in him. Anthony felt an odd sense of
relief as he observed it. For the constraint of
Sergius had begun to weigh upon him like a heavy
burden and to move him to an indefinable dread.

âI wonder you didn't cut him,â Sergius said.
âYou're my friend. And he's—he's—â

âHe's done you a deadly injury. I know that.
I am your friend, Serge; I would do anything
for you.â

âYet you speak to that—devil.â

âI spoke to him because I'm your friend.â

Sergius sat down again, with a heavy look, the
look of a man who has been thrashed, and means
to return every blow with curious interest.

âYou parsons are a riddle to me,â he said in a
low and dull voice. âYou and your charity and
your loving-kindness, and your turning the cheek
to the smiter and all the rest of it. And as to
your way of showing friendship—â

His voice died away in something that was
almost a growl, and he stared at the carpet. Between
it and his eyes once more the mist seemed
rising stealthily. It began to curl upwards softly
about him. As he watched it, he heard Anthony
say:—

[258]

âSergius, you don't understand how well I
understand you.â

The big hand of the clock had left the half-hour
after ten behind him. Anthony breathed more
freely. At last he could be more explicit, more
unreserved. He thought of a train rushing through
the night, devouring the spaces of land that lie
between London and the sea that speaks, moaning,
to the South of England. He saw a ship glide out
from the dreary docks. Her lights gleamed. He
heard the bell struck and the harsh cry of the
sailors, and then the dim sigh of a coward who
had escaped what he had merited. Then he heard
Sergius laugh.

âThat again, Anthony!â

âYes. I didn't meet Vernon by chance at
all.â

âWhat? You wrote to him, you fixed a
meeting?â

âI went to Phillimore Place, to his house.â

Sergius said nothing. Strange furrows ploughed
themselves in his young face, which was growing
dusky white. He remained in the attitude of one
devoted entirely to listening.

âYou hear, Sergius?â

âGo on—when?â

âTo-day. I decided to go after I met you
yesterday night—and after I had seen that woman
die—unprepared.â

âWhat could she have to do with it?â

[259]

âMuch. Everything almost.â

Anthony got up now, almost sprang up from
his chair. His face was glowing and working
with emotion. There was a choking sensation in
his throat.

âYou don't know what it is,â he said hoarsely,
âto a man with—with strong religious belief to
see a human being's soul go out to blackness, to
punishment—perhaps to punishment that will
never end. It's abominable. It's unbearable.
That woman will haunt me. Her despair will
be with me always. I could not add to that
horror.â

His eyes once more sought the clock. Seeing
the hour, he turned, with a kind of liberating relief,
to Sergius.

âI couldn't add to it,â he exclaimed, almost
fiercely, âso I went to Vernon.â

âWhy?â

âSergius—to warn him.â

There was a dead silence. Even the rain was
hushed against the window. Then Sergius said,
in a voice that was cold as the sound of falling
water in winter:—

âI don't understand.â

âBecause you won't understand how I have
learnt to know you, Sergius, to understand you,
to read your soul.â

âMine too?â

âYes; I've felt this awful blow that's come
[260]

upon you—the loss of Olga, her ruin—as if I
myself were you. We haven't said much about
it till yesterday. Then, from the way you spoke,
from the way you looked, from what you said,
even what you wouldn't say, I guessed all that
was in your heart.â

âYou guessed all that?â

Sergius was looking directly at Anthony and
leaning against the mantelpiece, along which he
stretched one arm. His fingers closed and unclosed,
with a mechanical and rhythmical movement,
round a china figure. The motion looked
as if it were made in obedience to some fiercely
monotonous music.

âYes, more—I knew it.â

Sergius nodded.

âI see,â he said.

Anthony touched his arm, almost with an awe-struck
gesture.

âI knew then that you—that you intended to
kill Vernon. And—God forgive me!—at first I
was almost glad.â

âWell—go on!â

Anthony shivered. The voice of Sergius was
so strangely calm and level.

âI—I—â he stammered. âSerge, why do you
look at me like that?â

Sergius looked away without a word.

âFor I, too, hated Vernon, more for what he
had done to you even than for what he had done
[261]

to Olga. But, Sergius, after you had gone, in the
night, and in the dawn too, I kept on thinking of
it over and over. I couldn't get away from it—that
you were going to commit such an awful
crime. I never slept. When at last it was morning,
I went down to my district; there are criminals
there, you know.â

âI know.â

âI looked at them with new eyes, and in their
eyes I saw you, always you; and then I said to
myself could I bear that you should become a
criminal?â

âYou said that?â

The fingers of Sergius closed over the china
figure, and did not unclose.

âYes. I almost resolved then to go to Vernon
at once and to tell him what I suspected—what
I really knew.â

The clock struck eleven. Anthony heard it;
Sergius did not hear it.

âThen I went to sit with that wretched woman.
Already I had resolved, as I believed, on the
course to take. I had no thought for Vernon
yet, only for you. It seemed to me that I did not
care in the least to save him from death. I only
cared to save you—my friend—from murder.
But when the woman died I felt differently. My
resolve was strengthened, my desire was just
doubled. I had to save not only you, but also him.
He was not ready to die.â

[262]

Anthony trembled with a passion of emotion.
Sergius remained always perfectly calm, the china
figure prisoned in his hand.

âSo—so I went to him, Sergius.â

âYes.â

âI saw him. Almost as I entered he received
your letter, saying that you forgave him, that you
would call to-night after eight o'clock to tell him
so, and to urge on his marriage with Olga. When
he had read the letter—I interpreted it to him;
and then I found out that he was a coward. His
terror was abject—despicable; he implored my
help; he started at every sound.â

âTo-night he'll sleep quietly, Anthony.â

âTo-night he has gone. Before morning he
will be on the sea.â

The sound of the wind came to them again,
and Sergius understood why Anthony had said:
âRough at sea to-night.â

Suddenly Sergius moved; he unclosed his fingers:
the ruins of the china figure fell from them
in a dust of blue and white upon the mantelpiece.

âNo—it's too late, Sergius. He went at
eleven.â

Sergius stood quite still.

âYou came here to-night to keep me here till
he had gone?â

âYes.â

âThat's why you—â

He stopped.

[263]

âThat's why I came. That's why I broke my
pledge. I thought wine—any weapon to keep
you from this crime. And, Sergius, think. Vernon
dead could never have restored Olga to the place
she has lost. That, too, must have driven me to
the right course, though I scarcely thought of it
till now.â

Sergius said, as if in reply: âSo you have understood
me!â

âYes, Sergius. Friendship is something. Let
us thank God, not even that he is safe, but that
you—you are safe—and that Olga—â

âHush! Has she gone with him?â

âShe will meet him. He has sworn to marry
her.â

The hand of Sergius moved to his left breast.
Anthony's glowing eyes were fixed upon him.

âAh, yes, Sergius,â Anthony cried. âPut that
cursed, cursed thing down, put it away. Now
it can never wreck your life and my peace.â

Sergius drew out the revolver slowly and carefully.
Again the mist rose around him. But it
was no longer white; it was scarlet.

There was a report. Anthony fell, without a
word, a cry.

Then Sergius bent down, and listened to the
silence of his friend's heart—the long silence of
the man who intervened.

[264]

[265]

[266]

[267]

AFTER TO-MORROW

I

In
his gilded cage, above the window-boxes that
were full of white daisies, the canary chirped with
a desultory vivacity. That was the only near
sound that broke the silence in the drawing-room
of No. 100 Mill Street, Knightsbridge, in which
a man and a woman stood facing one another.
Away, beyond his twittering voice, sang in the
London streets the muffled voice of the season.
The time was late afternoon, and rays of mellow
light slanted into the pretty room, and touched its
crowd of inanimate occupants with a radiance in
which the motes danced merrily. The china faces
of two goblins on the mantelpiece glowed with a
grotesque meaning, and their yellow smiles seemed
to call aloud on mirth; but the faces of the man
and woman were pale, and their lips trembled, and
did not smile.

She was tall, dark, and passionate-looking, perhaps
twenty-eight or thirty. He was a few years
older, a man so steadfast in expression that silly
people, who spring at exaggeration as saints spring
at heaven, called him stern, and even said he looked
forbidding—at balls.

[268]

At last the song of the canary was broken upon
by a voice. Sir Hugh Maine spoke, very quietly.
âWhy not?â he said.

âI don't think I can tell you,â Mrs. Glinn
answered, with an obvious effort.

âYou prefer to refuse me without giving a
reason?â

âI have a right to,â she said.

âI don't question it. You cannot expect me to
say more than that.â

He took up his hat, which lay on a chair, and
smoothed it mechanically with his coat-sleeve.

The action seemed to pierce her like a knife,
for she started, and half-extended her hand.
âDon't!â she exclaimed. âAt least, wait one
moment. So you belong to the second class of
men.â

âWhat do you mean?â

âMen are divided into two classes—those who
refuse to be refused, and those who accept. But
don't be too—too swift in your acceptance. After
all, a refusal is not exactly a bank-note.â

She tried to smile.

âBut I am exactly a beggar,â he answered, still
keeping the hat in his hand. âAnd if you have
nothing to give me, I may as well go.â

âAnd spend the rest of your life in sweeping the
old crossing?â

âAnd spend the rest of my life as I can,â he
said. âThat need not concern you.â

[269]

âA woman must be all to a man, or nothing?â

âYou must be all to me, or nothing.â

She sat down in an arm-chair in that part of
the room that was in shadow. She always sat
instinctively in shadow when she wanted to think.

âWell?â Sir Hugh said. âWhat are you
thinking?â

She glanced up at him. âThat you don't look
much like a beggar,â she said.

âIt is possible to feel tattered in a frock-coat
and patent-leather boots,â he answered. âGood-bye.
I am going back to my crossing.â And he
moved towards the door.

âNo, stop!â she exclaimed. âBefore you go,
tell me one thing.â

âWhat is it?â

âWill you ever ask me to marry you again?â

He looked hard into her eyes. âI shall always
want to, but I shall never do it,â he said slowly.

âI am glad you have told me that. We women
depend so much on a repetition of the offence,
when we blame a man for saying he loves us, and
ask him not to do it again. If you really mean
only to propose once, I must reconsider my
position.â

She was laughing, but the tears stood in her
eyes.

âWhy do you want to make this moment a
farcical one?â he asked rather bitterly.

âOh, Hugh!â she answered, âdon't you see?
[270]

Because it is really—really so tragic. I only try
to do for this moment what we all try to do for
life.â

âThen you love me?â he said, moving a step
forward.

âI never denied that,â she replied. âI might
as well deny that I am a woman.â

He held out his arms. âEve—then I shall
never go back to the crossing.â

But she drew back. âGo—go there till to-morrow!
To-morrow afternoon I will see you;
and if you love me after that—â

âYes?â

She turned away and pressed the bell. âGood-bye,â
she said. Her voice sounded strange to him.

He came nearer, and touched her hand; but she
drew it away.

âYou may kiss me,â she said.

âEve!â

âAfter to-morrow.â

The footman came in answer to the bell. Mrs
Glinn did not turn round. âI only rang for you
to open the door for Sir Hugh,â she said. âGood-bye
then, Sir Hugh. Come at five.â

âI will,â he answered, wondering.

When he had gone, Mrs Glinn sat down in a
chair and took up a French novel. It was by
Gyp. She tried to read it, with tears running over
her cheeks. But at last she laid it down.

âAfter to-morrow,â she murmured. âAh,
[271]

why—why does a woman ever love twice?â
And then she sobbed.

But the canary sang, and the motes danced merrily
in the sunbeams. And on the table where she
had put it down lay â
Le Mariage de Chiffon
.â

II

That evening, when Sir Hugh Maine came back
to his rooms in Jermyn Street after dining out, he
found a large man sprawling in one of his saddle-back
chairs, puffing vigorously at a pipe that
looked worn with long and faithful service. The
man took the pipe out of his mouth and sprang
up.

âHullo, Maine!â he cried. âD'you recognise
the tobacco and me?â

Hugh grasped his hand warmly. âRather,â he
said. âNeither is changed. At least—h'm—I
think you both seem a bit stronger even than usual.
Who would have thought of seeing you, Manning?
I did not know you were in Europe.â

âI came from Asia. I thought I should like to
hear Melba before the end of the season. And it
was getting sultry out there. So here I am.â

âAnd were those your only reasons?â

âGive me a brandy-and-soda,â said the other.

Maine did as he was bid, lit a cigar, and sat down,
[272]

stretching out his long legs. The other man took
a pull at his glass, and spoke again.

âI am very fond of music,â he said; âand
Melba sings very well.â

âAh!â

âLook here, Maine,â Manning broke out suddenly,
âyou are right—I had another reason.
Kipling says that those who have heard the East
a-calling never heed any other voice. He's wrong
though. The West has been calling me, or, at
least, a voice in the West, and I have resisted it
for a deuce of a time. But at last it became
imperative.â

âA woman's voice, I suppose?â

âYes.â

âTell me what is its
timbre
, if you care to.â

âI will. You're an old friend, and I can talk to
you. But you tell me one thing first: Is a man
really a fool to marry a woman with a past?â

âYou are going to?â

âI have tried not to. I have been trying not to
for three years. Listen! When I was travelling
in Japan I met her. She was with an American
called Glinn.â

âWhat?â

âYou knew him?â

âNo! It's all right. I was surprised, because
at the moment I was thinking of that very name.â

âOh! Well, she passed as Mrs Glinn; but,
somehow, it got out that she was something else.
[273]

The usual story, you know. People fought shy of
her; but I don't think she cared much. Glinn was
devoted to her, and she loved him, and was as true
to him as any wife could have been. Then the
tragedy came.â

âWhat was it?â

âGlinn died suddenly in Tokio, of typhoid.
She nursed him to the end. And when the end
came her situation was awful, so lonely and deserted.
There wasn't a woman in the hotel who
would be her friend; so I tried to come to the
rescue, arranged her affairs, saw about the funeral,
and did what I could. She was well off; Glinn
left her nearly all his money. He would have
married her, only he had a wife alive somewhere.â

âAnd you fell in love with her, of course?â

âThat was the sort of thing. If you knew her
you would not wonder at it. She was not a bad
woman. Glinn had been the only one. She loved
him too much; that was all. She came to Europe,
and lived in Paris for a time, keeping the name of
Mrs Glinn. I used to see her sometimes, but I
never said anything. You see, there was her past.
In fact, I have been fighting against her for three
years. I went to India to get cured; but it was
no good. And now, here I am.â

âAnd she is in Paris?â

âNo, in London at present; but I didn't know
her address till to-day. I think she had her doubts
of me, and meant to give me the slip.â

[274]

âHow did you find it out?â

âQuite by chance. I was walking in Mill
Street, Knightsbridge, and saw her pass in a
victoria.â

Maine got up suddenly, and went over to the
spirit-stand. âIn Mill Street?â he said.

âYes. The carriage stopped at No. 100. She
went in. A footman came out and carried in her
rug.
Ergo
, she lives there.â

âHow hot it is!â said Maine in a hard voice.
He threw up one of the windows and leaned out.
He felt as if he were choking. A little way down
the street a half-tipsy guardsman was reeling along,
singing his own private version of âTommy
Atkins.â He narrowly avoided a lamp-post by an
abrupt lurch which took him into the gutter. Maine
heard some one laugh. It was himself.

âWell, old chap,â said Manning, who had come
up behind him, âwhat would you advise me to do?
I'm in a fix. I'm in love with Eve—that's her
name; I can't live without her happily, and yet I
hate to marry a woman with a—well, you know
how it is.â

Maine drew himself back into the room and faced
round. âDoes she love you?â he asked; and
there was a curious change in his manner towards
his friend.

âI don't know that she does,â Manning said,
rather uncomfortably. âBut that would come right.
She would marry me, naturally.â

[275]

âWhy?â

âWell, I mean the position. Lady Herbert
Manning could go where Mrs Glinn could not,
and all that sort of thing.â

âThe only question is whether you can bring
yourself to ask her?â

âMy dear chap, you don't put it too pleasantly.â

âIt's the fact, though.â

Lord Herbert hesitated. Then he said dubiously,
âI suppose so.â

Maine lit another cigar and sat down again. His
face was very white. âYou're rather conventional,
Manning,â he said presently.

âConventional! Why?â

âYou think her—this Mrs Glinn—a good
woman. Isn't that enough for you?â

âBut, besides Eve and myself, there is a third
person in the situation.â

âHow on earth did you find out that?â exclaimed
Maine.

The other looked surprised. âHow did I find
out? I don't understand you.â

Maine recollected himself. He had made the
common mistake of fancying another might know
a thing because he knew it.

âWho is this third person?â he asked.

âSociety.â

âAh! I said you were conventional.â

âEvery sensible man and woman is.â

âI don't know that I agree. But the third per
[276]
son
does certainly complicate the situation. What
are you going to do then?â

Lord Herbert put down his pipe. It was not
smoked out. âThat's what I want to know,â
he answered.

âOf course, there's the one way—of being
unconventional. Then, there's the way of being
conventional but unhappy. Is there any alternative?â

Lord Herbert hesitated obviously, but at length
he said: âThere is, of course; but Mrs Glinn is a
curious sort of woman. I don't quite know—â

He paused, looking at his friend. Maine's face
was drawn and fierce.

âWhat's the row?â Lord Herbert asked.

âNothing; only I shouldn't advise you to try
the alternative. That's all.â

âMaine, what do you mean?â

âJust this,â replied the other. âThat I know
Mrs Glinn, that I agree with you about her
character—â

âYou know her? That's odd!â

âI have known her for a year.â

They looked each other in the eyes while a
minute passed. Then Lord Herbert said slowly,
âI understand.â

âWhat?â

âThat I have come to the wrong man for
advice.â

There was a silence, broken only by the ticking
[277]

of a clock and the uneasy movements of Maine's
fox-terrier, which was lying before the empty grate
and dreaming of departed fires.

At last Maine said: âTo-day I asked Mrs Glinn
to marry me.â

The other started perceptibly. âKnowing what
I have told you?â he asked.

âNot knowing it.â

âWhat—what did she say?â

âNothing. I am to see her to-morrow.â

Lord Herbert glanced at him furtively. âI
suppose you will not go—now?â he said.

âYes, Manning, I shall,â Maine answered.

âWell,â the other man continued, looking at
his watch and yawning, âI must be going. It's
late. Glad to have seen you, Maine. I am to
be found at 80 St James's Place. Thanks; yes I
will have my coat on. My pipe—oh! here it is.
Good-night.â

The door closed, and Maine was left alone.

âWill she tell me to-morrow, or will she be
silent?â he said to himself. âThat depends on
one thing: Has love of truth the largest half of
her heart, or love of me?â

He sighed—at the conventionality of the world,
perhaps.

[278]

III

âI am not at home to any one except Sir Hugh
Maine,â Mrs Glinn said to the footman. âYou
understand?â

âYes, ma'am.â

He went out softly and closed the door.

The English summer had gone back upon its
steps that afternoon, and remembered the duty it
owed to its old-time reputation. The canary, a
puffed-out ball of ragged-looking feathers in its
cage, seemed listening with a depressed attention
to the beat of the cold rain against the window.
The daisies, in their boxes, dripped and nodded in
the wind. There was a darkness in the pretty
room, and the smile of the china goblins was no
longer yellow. Like many people who are not
made of china, they depended upon adventitious
circumstances for much of their outward show.
When they were not gilded there was a good deal
of the pill apparent in their nature.

Mrs Glinn was trying not to be restless. She
was very pale, and her dark eyes gleamed with an
almost tragic fire; but she sat down firmly on the
white sofa, and read Gyp, as Carmen may have
read her doom in the cards. One by one the
pages were turned. One by one the epigrams
were made the property of another mind. But
through all the lightness and humour of the story
[279]

there crept like a little snake a sentence that Gyp
had not written:—

âCan I tell him?â

And no answer ever came to that question.
When the door-bell at last rang, Mrs Glinn
laid down her novel carefully, and mechanically
stood up. A change of attitude was necessary to
her.

Sir Hugh came in, and was followed by tea.
They sat down by the tiny table, and discussed
French literature. Flaubert and Daudet go as
well with tea as Fielding and Smollett go with
supper.

But, when the cups were put down, Maine
drove the French authors in a pack out of the
conversation.

âI did not come here to say what I can say to
every woman I meet who understands French,â
he remarked.

And then Mrs Glinn was fully face to face with
her particular guardian devil.

âNo?â she said.

She did not try to postpone the moment she
dreaded. For she had a strong man to deal with,
and, being a strong woman at heart, she generally
held out her hand to the inevitable.

âYou have been thinking?â Maine went on.

âYes. What a sad occupation that is sometimes—like
knitting, or listening to church-bells at
night!â

[280]

âEve, let us be serious.â

âGod knows I am,â she answered. âBut
modern gravity is dressed in flippancy. No feeling
must go quite naked.â

âDon't talk like that,â he said. âAs there is
a nudity in art that may be beautiful, so there is a
nudity in expression, in words, that may be beautiful.
Eve, I have come to hear you tell me something.
You know that.â He glanced into her
face with an anxiety that she did not fully understand.
Then he said: âTell it me.â

âThere is—is so much to tell,â she said.

âYes, yes.â

âHe does not understand,â she thought.

He thought, âShe does not understand.â

âAnd I am not good at telling stories.â

âThen tell me the truth.â

She tried to smile, but she was trembling. âOf
course. Why should I not?â She hesitated, and
then added, with a forced attempt at petulance,
âBut there is nothing so awkward as giving people
more than they expect. Is there?â

He understood her question, despite its apparent
inconsequence, and his heart quickened its beating:
âGive me everything.â

âI suppose I should be doing that if I gave you
myself,â she said nervously.

âYou know best,â he answered; and for a
moment she was puzzled by not catching the
affirmative for which she had angled.

[281]

âDo you want me very, very much?â she
asked.

âSo much that, as I told you yesterday, I could
not ask for you twice. Don't you understand?â

âYes. I could not marry a man who had
bothered me to be his wife. One might as well
be scolded into virtue. You want me, then,
Hugh, and I want you. But—â

Again she stopped, with sentences fluttering, as
it seemed, on the very edges of her lips. Her
heart was at such fearful odds with her conscience,
that she felt as if he must hear the clashing of the
swords. And he did hear it. He would fain have
cheered on both the combatants. Which did he
wish should be the conqueror? He hardly knew.

âYes?â he said.

âIt is always so difficult to finish a sentence that
begins with âbut,ââ she began; and for the first
time her voice sounded tremulous. âWhen two
people want each other very much, there is always
something that ought to keep them apart—at
least, I think so. God must love solitude; it is
His gift to so many.â There were tears in her
eyes.

âWhy should we keep apart, Eve?â

âBecause we should be too happy together, I
suppose.â

He leaned suddenly forward and took both her
hands in his. âHow cold you are!â he said,
startled.

[282]

The words seemed to brace her like a sea-breeze.

âHugh,â she said, âI wish to tell you something.
There is a âbutâ in the sentence of my
life.â

He drew her closer to him, with a strange impulse
to be nearer the soul that was about to prove
itself as noble as he desired. But that very act
prevented the fulfilment of his wish. The touch
of his hands, the eagerness of his eyes, gave the
victory to her heart. She shut the lips that were
speaking, and he kissed them. Kisses act as an
opiate on a woman's conscience. Only when Eve
felt his lips on hers did she know her own weakness.
Sir Hugh having kissed her, waited for the
telling of the secret. At that moment he might as
well have sat down and waited for the millennium.

âWhat is it?â he said at last.

âNothing,â she answered, ânothing.â She
spoke the word with a hard intonation.

Hugh held her close in his arms, with a sort of
strange idea that to do so would crush his disappointment.
She was proving her love by her
silence. Why, then, did he wish that she should
speak? At last she said, in a low voice:—

âThere is one thing you ought to know. If I
marry you, I marry you a beggar. I shall lose my
fortune. I am not obliged to lose it, but I mean
to give it up. Don't ask me why.â

He had no need to. He waited, but she was
[283]

silent. So that was all. He kissed her again,
loosened his arms from about her and stood up.

âI have enough for both,â he said.

He did not look at her, and she could not look
at him.

âAre you going?â she said.

âYes; but I will call this evening.â

He was at the door, and had half-opened it
when he turned back, moved by a passionate
impulse.

âEve!â he cried, and his eyes seemed asking
her for something.

âYes?â she said, looking away.

There was a silence. Then he said âGood-bye!â
The door closed upon him.

Mrs Glinn stood for a moment where he had left
her. In her mind she was counting the seconds
that must elapse before he could reach the street.
If she could be untrue to herself till then, she could
be untrue to herself for ever. Would he walk
down the stairs slowly or fast? She wanted to be
a false woman so much, so very much, that she
clenched her hands together. The action seemed
as if it might help her to keep on doing wrong.
But suddenly she unclasped her hands, darted across
the room to the door, and opened it. She listened,
and heard Hugh's footsteps in the hall. He picked
up his umbrella, and unfolded it to be ready for
the rain. The
frou-frou
of the silk seemed to stir
her to action.

[284]

âHugh!â she cried in a broken voice.

He turned in the hall, and looked up.

âCome back,â she said.

He came up the stairs three steps at a time.

âHugh,â she said, leaning heavily on the balustrade,
and looking away, âI have a secret to tell
you. I have tried to be wicked to-day, but somehow
I can't. Listen to the truth.â

âI need not,â he answered. âI know it
already.â

Then she looked at him, and drew in her breath:
âYou know it?â

âYes.â

âHow you must love me!â

There was a ring at the hall door. The footman
opened it, held a short parley with some one who
was invisible, shut the door, and came upstairs
with a card.

Mrs Glinn took it, and read, âLord Herbert
Manning.â

He had decided to be unconventional too late.

[285]

[286]

[287]

A SILENT GUARDIAN

I

The
door of the long, dreary room, with its
mahogany chairs, its littered table, its motley crew
of pale, silent people, opened noiselessly. A
dreary, lean footman appeared in the aperture,
bowing towards a corner where, in a recess near a
forlorn, lofty window, sat a tall, athletic-looking
man of about forty-five years of age, with a strong
yet refined face, clean shaven, and short, crisp,
dark hair. The tall man rose immediately, laying
down an old number of
Punch
, and made his
way out, watched rather wolfishly by the other
occupants of the room. The door closed upon
him, and there was a slight rustle and a hiss of
whispering.

Two well-dressed women leaned to one another,
the feathers in their hats almost mingling as they
murmured: âNot much the matter with him, I
should fancy.â

âHe looks as strong as a horse; but modern
men are always imagining themselves ill. He has
lived too much, probably.â

They laughed in a suppressed ripple.

At the end of the room near the door, under the
[288]

big picture of a grave man in a frock-coat, holding
a double eye-glass tentatively in his right hand as
if to emphasise an argument—a young girl bent
towards her father, who said to her in a low voice:

âThat man who has just left the room is Brune,
the great sculptor.â

âIs he ill?â the girl asked.

âIt seems so, since he is here.â

Then a silence fell again, broken only by the
rustle of turned pages and the occasional uneasy
shifting of feet.

Meanwhile, in a small room across the hall, by
a window through which the autumn sun streamed
with a tepid brightness, Reginald Brune lay on a
narrow sofa. His coat and waistcoat were thrown
open; his chest was bared. Gerard Fane, the
great discoverer of hidden diseases, raised himself
from a bent posture, and spoke some words in a
clear, even voice.

Brune lifted himself half up on his elbow, and
began mechanically to button the collar of his
shirt. His long fingers did not tremble, though his
face was very pale.

He fastened the collar, arranged his loose tie,
and then sat up slowly.

A boy, clanking two shining milk-cans, passed
along the pavement, whistling a music-hall song.
The shrill melody died down the street, and Brune
listened to it until there was a silence. Then he
[289]

looked up at the man opposite to him, and said,
as one dully protesting, without feeling, without
excitement:—

âBut, doctor, I was only married three weeks
ago.â

Gerard Fane gave a short upward jerk of the
head, and said nothing. His face was calmly
grave. His glittering brown eyes were fastened
on his patient. His hands were loosely folded
together.

Brune repeated, in a sightly raised voice:—

âI was married three weeks ago. It cannot be
true.â

âI am here to tell the truth,â the other replied.

âBut it is so—so ironic. To allow me to start
a new life—a beautiful life—just as the night is
coming. Why, it is diabolical; it is not just; the
cruelty of it is fiendish.â

A spot of gleaming red stained each of the
speaker's thin cheeks. He clenched his hands
together, riveting his gaze on the doctor, as he
went on:—

âCan't you see what I mean? I had no idea—I
had not the faintest suspicion of what you say.
And I have had a very hard struggle. I have been
poor and quite friendless. I have had to fight, and
I have lost much of the good in my nature by
fighting, as we often do. But at last I have won the
battle, and I have won more. I have won good
[290]
ness
to give me back some of my illusions. I had
begun to trust life again. I had—â

He stopped abruptly. Then he said:—

âDoctor, are you married?â

âNo,â the other answered; and there was a
note of pity in his voice.

âThen you can't understand what your verdict
means to me. Is it irrevocable?â

Gerard Fane hesitated.

âI wish I could hope not; but—â

âBut—?â

âIt is.â

Brune stood up. His face was quite calm now
and his voice, when he spoke again, was firm and
vibrating.

âI have some work that I should wish to finish.
How long can you give me?â

âThree months.â

âOne will do if my strength keeps up at all.
Good-bye.â

There was a thin chink of coins grating one
against the other. The specialist said:—

âI will call on you to-morrow, between four and
five. I have more directions to give you. To-day
my time is so much taken up. Good-bye.â

The door closed.

In the waiting-room, a moment later, Brune was
gathering up his coat and hat.

The two ladies eyed him curiously as he took
them and passed out.

[291]

âHe does look a little pale, after all,â whispered
one of them. A moment later he was in the
street.

From the window of his consulting-room, Gerard
Fane watched the tall figure striding down the
pavement.

âI am sorry that man is going to die,â he said
to himself.

And then he turned gravely to greet a new
patient.

II

Gerard Fane's victoria drew up at the iron gate
of No. 5 Ilbury Road, Kensington, at a quarter
past four the following afternoon. A narrow strip
of garden divided the sculptor's big red house from
the road. Ornamental ironwork on a brick foundation
closed it in. The great studio, with its huge
windows and its fluted pillars, was built out at
one end. The failing sunlight glittered on its
glass, and the dingy sparrows perched upon the
roof to catch the parting radiance as the twilight
fell. The doctor glanced round him and thought,
âHow hard this man must have worked! In
London this is a little palace.â

âWill you come into the studio, sir, please?â
said the footman in answer to his summons. âMr
Brune is there at present.â

[292]

âSurely he cannot be working,â thought the
doctor, as he followed the man down a glass-covered
paved passage, and through a high doorway
across which a heavy curtain fell. âIf so, he must
possess resolution almost more than mortal.â

He passed beyond the curtain, and looked round
him curiously.

The studio was only dimly lit now, for daylight
was fast fading. On a great open hearth, with
dogs, a log-fire was burning; and beside it, on an
old-fashioned oaken settle, sat a woman in a loose
cream-coloured tea-gown. She was half turning
round to speak to Reginald Brune, who stood a
little to her left, clad in a long blouse, fastened
round his waist with a band. He had evidently
recently finished working, for his hands still bore
evident traces of labour, and in front of him, on a
raised platform, stood a statue that was not far
from completion. The doctor's eyes were attracted
from the woman by the log-fire, from his patient,
by the lifeless, white, nude figure that seemed to
press forward out of the gathering gloom. The
sculptor and his wife had not heard him announced,
apparently, for they continued conversing in low
tones, and he paused in the doorway, strangely
fascinated—he could scarcely tell why—by the
marble creation of a dying man.

The statue, which was life size, represented the
figure of a beautiful, grave youth, standing with
one foot advanced, as if on the point of stepping
[293]

forward. His muscular arms hung loosely; his
head was slightly turned aside as in the attitude
of one who listens for a repetition of some vague
sound heard at a distance. His whole pose suggested
an alert, yet restrained, watchfulness. The
triumph of the sculptor lay in the extraordinary
suggestion of life he had conveyed into the marble.
His creature lived as many mollusc men never live.
Its muscles seemed tense, its body quivering with
eagerness to accomplish—what? To attack, to
repel, to protect, to perform some deed demanding
manfulness, energy, free, fearless strength.

âThat marble thing could slay if necessary,â
thought Gerard Fane, with a thrill of the nerves
all through him that startled him, and recalled him
to himself.

He stepped forward to the hearth quietly, and
Brune turned and took him by the hand.

âI did not hear you,â the sculptor said. âThe
man must have opened the door very gently.
Sydney, this is Dr Gerard Fane, who is kindly
looking after me.â

The woman by the fire had risen, and stood in
the firelight and the twilight, which seemed to join
hands just where she was. She greeted the specialist
in a girl's young voice, and he glanced at her with
the furtive thought, âDoes she know yet?â

She looked twenty-two, not more.

Her eyes were dark grey, and her hair was
bronze. Her figure was thin almost to emaciation;
[294]

but health glowed in her smooth cheeks, and spoke
in her swift movements and easy gestures. Her
expression was responsive and devouringly eager.
Life ran in her veins with turbulence, never with
calm. Her mouth was pathetic and sensitive, but
there was an odd suggestion of almost boyish
humour in her smile.

Before she smiled, Fane thought, âShe knows.â

Afterwards, âShe cannot know.â

âHave you a few moments to spare?â Brune
asked him. âWill you have tea with us?â

Fane looked at Mrs Brune and assented. He
felt a strange interest in this man and this woman.
The tragedy of their situation appealed to him,
although he lived in a measure by foretelling
tragedies. Mrs Brune touched an electric bell let
into the oak-panelled wall, and her husband drew
a big chair forward to the hearth.

As he was about to sit down in it, Gerard Fane's
eyes were again irresistibly drawn towards the
statue; and a curious fancy, born, doubtless, of the
twilight that invents spectres and of the firelight
that evokes imaginations, came to him, and made
him for a moment hold his breath.

It seemed to him that the white face menaced
him, that the white body had a soul, and that the
soul cried out against him.

His hand trembled on the back of the chair.
Then he laughed to himself at the absurd fancy,
and sat down.

[295]

âYour husband has been working?â he said to
Mrs Brune.

âYes, all the day. I could not tempt him out
for even five minutes. But then, he has had a
holiday, as he says, although it was only a fortnight.
That was not very long for—for a honeymoon.â

As she said the last sentence she blushed a little,
and shot a swift, half-tender, half-reproachful glance
at her husband. But he did not meet it; he only
looked into the fire, while his brows slightly
contracted.

âI think Art owns more than half his soul,â the
girl said, with the flash of a smile. âHe only
gives to me the fortnights and to Art the years.â

There was a vague jealousy in her voice; but
then the footman brought in tea, and she poured it
out, talking gaily.

From her conversation, Fane gathered that she
had no idea of her husband's condition. With a
curious and fascinating naturalness she spoke of
her marriage, of her intentions for the long future.

âIf Reginald is really seedy, Dr Fane,â she
said, âget him well quickly, that he may complete
his commissions. Because, you know, he has
promised, when they are finished, to take me to
Italy, and to Greece, to the country of Phidias,
whose mantle has fallen upon my husband.â

âDo not force Dr Fane into untruth,â said
Brune, with an attempt at a smile.

[296]

âAnd is that statue a commission?â Fane
asked, indicating the marble figure, that seemed to
watch them and to listen.

âNo; that is an imaginative work on which I
have long been engaged. I call it, âA Silent
Guardian.ââ

âIt is very beautiful,â the doctor said. âWhat
is your idea exactly? What is the figure guarding?â

Brune and his wife glanced at one another—he
gravely, she with a confident smile.

Then he said, âI leave that to the imagination.â

Dr Fane looked again at the statue, and said
slowly, âYou have wrought it so finely that in
this light my nerves tell me it is alive.â

Mrs Brune looked triumphant.

âAll the world would feel so if they could see
it,â she said; âbut it is not to be exhibited. That
is our fancy—his and mine. And now I will
leave you together for a few minutes. Heal him
of his ills, Dr Fane, won't you?â

She vanished through the door at the end of
the studio. The two men stood together by the
hearth.

âShe does not know?â Fane asked.

The other leaned his head upon his hand, which
was pressed against the oak mantelpiece.

âI am too cowardly to tell her,â he said in
a choked voice. âYou must.â

âAnd when?â

[297]

âTo-day.â

There was a silence. Then, in his gravest professional
manner, Fane gave some directions, and
wrote others down, while the sculptor looked into
the dancing fire. When Fane had finished:—

âShall I tell her now?â he asked gently.

Brune nodded without speaking. His face
looked drawn and contorted as he moved towards
the door. His emotion almost strangled him, and
the effort to remain calm put a strain upon him
that was terrible.

Gerard Fane was left alone for a moment—alone
with the statue whose personality, it seemed
to him, pervaded the great studio. In its attitude
there was a meaning, in its ghost-like face and
blind eyes a resolution of intention, that took possession
of his soul. He told himself that it was
lifeless, inanimate, pulseless, bloodless marble; that
it contained no heart to beat with love or hate, no
soul to burn with impulse or with agony; that its
feet could never walk, its hands never seize or
slay, its lips never utter sounds of joy or menace.
Then he looked at it again, and he shuddered.

âI am over-working,â he said to himself; âmy
nerves are beginning to play me tricks. I must be
careful.â

And he forcibly turned his thoughts from the
marble that could never feel to the man and
woman so tragically circumstanced, and to his
relation towards them.

[298]

A doctor is so swiftly plunged into intimacy
with strangers. To the sculptor it was as if Fane
held the keys of the gates of life and death for
him; as if, during that quarter of an hour in the
consulting-room, the doctor had decided, almost of
his own volition, that death should cut short a life
of work and of love. And even to Fane himself it
seemed as if his fiat had precipitated, even brought
about, a tragedy that appealed to his imagination
with peculiar force. His position towards this
curiously interesting girl was strange. He had
seen her for a quarter of an hour only, and now
it was his mission to cause her the most weary
pain that she might, perhaps, ever know. The
opening of the studio door startled him, and his
heart, that usually beat so calmly, throbbed almost
with violence as Mrs Brune came up to him.

âWhat is it?â she asked, facing him, and looking
him full in the eyes with a violence of interrogation
that was positively startling. âWhat is it
you have to tell me? Reginald says you have
ordered him to keep quiet—that you wish me to
help you in—in something. Is he ill? May he
not finish his commissions?â

âHe is ill,â said Gerard Fane, with a straightforward
frankness that surprised himself.

She kept her eyes on his face.

âVery ill?â

âSit down,â the doctor said, taking her hands
and gently putting her into a chair.

[299]

With the rapidity of intellect peculiar to women,
she heard in those two words the whole truth. Her
head drooped forward. She put out her hands as
if to implore Fane's silence.

âDon't speak,â she murmured. âDon't say
it; I know.â

He looked away. His eyes rested on the statue
that made a silent third in their sad conference.
How its attitude suggested that of a stealthy
listener, bending to hear the more distinctly! Its
expressionless eyes met his, and was there not a
light in them? He knew there was not, yet he
caught himself saying mentally:—

âWhat does he think of this?â and wondering
about the workings of a soul that did not, could
not, exist.

Presently the girl moved slightly, and said:—

âHe only knew this for certain yesterday?â

âOnly yesterday.â

âAh! but he must have suspected it long ago,â—she
pointed towards the statue—âwhen he
began that.â

âI don't understand,â Fane said. âWhat can
that marble have to do with his health or illness?â

âWhen we first began to love each other,â she
said, âhe began to work on that. It was to be
his marriage gift to me, my guardian angel. He
told me he would put all his soul into it, and that
sometimes he fancied, if he died before me, his
soul would really enter into that statue and watch
[300]

over and guard me. âA Silent Guardianâ he has
always called it. He must have known.â

âI do not think so,â Fane said. âIt was impossible
he should.â

The girl stood up. The tears were running
over her face now. She turned towards the statue.

âAnd he will be cold—cold like that!â she
cried in a heart-breaking voice. âHis eyes will
be blind and his hands nerveless, and his voice
silent.â

She suddenly swayed and fainted into Fane's
arms. He held her a moment; and when he laid
her down, a reluctance to let the slim form, lifeless
though it was, slip out of his grasp, came upon
him. He remembered the previous day, the
doomed man going down the street—his thought
as he looked from the window of his consulting-room,
âI am sorry that man is going to die.â

Now, as he leant over the white girl, he whispered,
forming the very words with his lips, âI am
not sorry.â

And the statue seemed to bend and to listen.

III

Six weeks passed away. Winter was deepening.
Through the gloom and fog that shrouded London,
Christmas approached, wrapped in seasonable
snow. The dying man had finished his work, and
[301]

a strange peace stole over him. Now, when he
suffered, when his body shivered and tried to
shrink away, as if it felt the cold hands of death
laid upon it, he looked at the completed statue, and
found he could still feel joy. There had always
been in his highly-strung, sensitive nature an element,
so fantastic that he had ever striven to
conceal it, of romance; and in his mind, affected
by constant pain, by many sleepless nights, grew
the curious idea that his life, as it ebbed away from
him, entered into his creation. As he became
feeble, he imagined that the man he had formed
towered above him in more God-like strength, that
light flowed into the sightless eyes, that the marble
muscles were tense with vigour, that a soul was
born in the thing which had been soulless. The
theory, held by so many, of re-incarnation upon
earth, took root in his mind, and he came to believe
that, at the moment of death, he would pass
into his work and live again, unconscious, it might
be, of his former existence. He loved the statue
as one might love a breathing man; but he seldom
spoke of his fancies, even to Sydney.

Only, he sometimes said to her, pointing to his
work:—

âYou will never be alone, unprotected, while
he is there.â

And she tried to smile through the tears she
could not always keep back.

Gerard Fane was often with them. He sunk
[302]

the specialist in the friend, and not a day passed
without a visit from him to the great studio, in
which the sculptor and his wife almost lived.

He was unwearied in his attendance upon the
sick man, unwavering in his attempts to soothe his
sufferings. But, in reality, and almost against his
will, the doctor numbered each breath his patient
drew, noted with a furious eagerness each sign of
failing vitality, bent his ear to catch every softest
note in the prolonged
diminuendo
of this human
symphony.

When Fane saw Mrs Brune leaning over her
husband, touching the damp brow with her cool,
soft fingers, or the dry, parched lips with her soft,
rosy lips, he turned away in a sick fury, and said
to himself:—

âHe is dying, he is dying. It will soon be
over.â

For with a desperate love had entered into him
a desperate jealousy, and even while he ministered
to Brune he hated him.

And the statue, with blind eyes, observed the
drama enacted by those three people, the two men
and the woman, till the curtain fell and one of the
actors made his final exit.

Fane's nerves still played him tricks sometimes.
He could not look at the statue without a shudder;
and while Brune imaginatively read into the marble
face love and protection, the doctor saw there
menace and hatred. He came to feel almost
[303]

jealous of the statue, because Sydney loved it and
fell in with her husband's fancy that his life was
fast ebbing into and vitalising the marble limbs,
that his soul would watch her from the eyes that
were now without expression and thought.

When Fane entered the studio, he always involuntarily
cast a glance at the white figure—at first,
a glance of shuddering distaste, then, as he acknowledged
to himself his love for Sydney, a glance of
defiance, of challenge.

One evening, after a day of many appointments
and much mental stress and strain, he drove up
to Ilbury Road, was admitted, and shown as usual
into the studio. He found it empty. Only the
statue greeted him silently in the soft lamplight,
that scarcely accomplished more than the defining
of the gloom.

âMy master is upstairs, sir,â said the footman.
âI will tell him you are here.â

In a moment Sydney entered, with a lagging
step and pale cheeks. Without thinking of the
usual polite form of greeting, she said to Fane,
âHe is much worse to-day. There is a change in
him, a horrible change. Dr Fane, just now when
I was talking to him it seemed to me that he was
a long way off. I caught hold of his hands to reassure
myself. I held them. I heard him speaking,
but it was as if his words came from a distance.
What does it mean? He is not—he is not—â

She looked the word he could not speak.

[304]

Fane made her sit down.

âI will go to him immediately,â he said. âI
may be able to do something.â

âYes, go—do go!â she exclaimed with feverish
excitement.

Then suddenly she sprang up, and seizing his
hands with hers, she said in a piercing voice: âYou
are a great doctor. Surely—surely you can keep
this one life for me a little longer.â

As they stood, Fane was facing the statue, which
was at her back, and while she spoke his eyes were
drawn from the woman he loved to the marble
thing he senselessly hated. It struck him that a
ghastly change had stolen over it. A sudden flicker
of absolute life surely infused it, quickened it even
while she spoke, stole through the limbs one by
one, welled up to the eyes as light pierces from a
depth, flowed through all the marble. A pulse
beat in the dead, cold heart. A mind rippled into
the rigid, watching face. There was no absolute
movement, and yet there was the sense of stir.
Fane, absorbed in horror, seemed to watch an act
of creation, to see life poured from some invisible
and unknown source into the bodily chamber that
had been void and dark.

Motionless he saw the statue dead; motionless
he saw the statue live.

He drew his hands from Sydney's. He was too
powerfully impressed to speak, but she looked up
into his face, turned, and followed his eyes.

[305]

She, too, observed the change, for her lips parted,
and a wild amazement shone in her eyes. Then she
touched Fane's arm, and whispered, rather in awe
than in horror, âGo—go to him. See if anything
has happened. I will stay and watch here.â

With a hushed tread Fane left the studio, passed
through the hall, ascended the stairs to the sculptor's
room. Outside the door he hesitated for a moment.
He was trembling. He heard a clock ticking within.
It sounded very loud, like a hammer beating in
his ears. He pushed the door open at length, and
entered. Brune's tall figure was sitting in an armchair,
bowed over a table on which lay an open
Art magazine.

His head lay hidden on his arms, which were
crossed.

Fane raised the face and turned it up towards
him.

It was the face of a dead man.

He looked at it, and smiled.

Then he stole down again to the studio, where
Sydney was still standing.

âYes?â she said interrogatively, as he entered.

âHe is dead,â Fane answered.

She only bowed her head, as if in assent. She
stood a moment, then she turned her tearless eyes
to him, and said:—

âWhy could not you save him?â

âBecause I am human,â Fane answered.

âAnd we did not say good-bye,â she said.

[306]

Fane was strung up. Conflicting feelings found
a wild playground in his soul. His nerves were in a
state of abnormal excitement, and something seemed
to let go in him—the something that holds us back,
normally, from mad follies. He suddenly caught
Sydney's hand, and in a choked voice said:—

âHe is dead. Think a little of the living.â

She looked at him, wondering.

âThink of the living that love you. He neither
hates nor loves any more. Sydney! Sydney!â

As she understood his meaning she wrung her
hand out of his, and said, as one trying to clear the
road for reason:—

âYou love me, and he bought you to keep him
alive. Why, then—â

A sick, white change came over her face.

âSydney! Sydney!â he said.

âWhy, then he bought death from you. Ah!â

She put her hand on the bell, and kept it there
till the servant hurried in.

âShow Dr Fane out,â she said. âHe will not
come here again.â

And Fane, seeing the uselessness of protest,
ready to strike himself for his folly, went without
a word. Only, as he went, he cast one look at
the statue. Was there not the flicker of a smile
in its marble eyes?

[307]

IV

People said Dr Gerard Fane was over-working,
that he was not himself. His manner to patients
was sometimes very strange, brusque, impatient,
intolerant. A brutality stole over him, and impressed
the world that went to him for healing very
unfavourably. The ills of humanity rendered him
now sarcastic instead of pitiful, a fatal attitude of
mind for a physician to adopt; and he was even
known to pronounce on sufferers sentence of death
with a callous indifference that was inhuman as
well as impolitic. As the weeks went by, his
reception-room became less crowded than of old.
There were even moments in his day when he had
leisure to sit down and think, to give a rein to his
mood of impotent misery and despair. Sydney had
never consented to receive him again. Woman-like—for
she could be extravagantly yet calmly unreasonable—she
had clung to the idea that Fane
had hastened, if not actually brought about, her
husband's death by his treatment. She made no
accusation. She simply closed her doors upon him.
She had a horror of him, which never left her.

Again and again Fane called. She was always
denied to him. Then he met her in the street.
She cut him. He spoke to her. She passed on
without a reply. At last a dull fury took possession
of him. Her treatment of him was flagrantly
[308]

unjust. He had wished the sculptor to die, but he
had allowed nature to accomplish her designs unaided,
even to some extent hampered and hindered
by his medical skill and care. He loved Sydney
with the violence of a man whose emotions had
been sedulously repressed through youth, vanquished
but not killed by ambition, and the need to work
for the realisation of that ambition. The tumults
of early manhood, never given fair play, now raged
in his breast, from which they should have been
long since expelled, and played havoc with every
creed of sense, and every built-up theory of wisdom
and experience. Fane became by degrees a monomaniac.

He brooded incessantly over his developed but
starved passion, over the thought that Sydney
chose to believe him a murderer. At first, when
he was trying day after day to see her, he clung
to his love for her; but when he found her obdurate,
set upon wronging him in her thought,
his passion, verging towards despair, changed, and
was coloured with hatred. By degrees he came
to dwell more upon the injury done to him by her
suspicion than upon his love of her, and then
it was that a certain wildness crept into his manner,
and alarmed or puzzled those who consulted
him.

That his career was going to the dogs Fane
understood, but he did not care. The vision of
Sydney was always before him. He was for ever
[309]

plotting and planning to be with her alone—against
her will or not, it was nothing to him.
And when he was alone with her, what then?

He would know how to act.

It was just in the dawn of the spring season
over London that further inaction became insupportable
to him. One evening, after a day of listless
inactivity spent in waiting for the patients who
no longer came in crowds to his door, he put on
his hat and walked from Mayfair to Kensington,
vaguely, yet with intention. He looked calm, even
absent; but he was a desperate man. All fear of
what the world thinks or says, all consideration of
outward circumstances and their relation to worldly
happiness, had died within him. He was entirely
abstracted and self-centred.

He reached the broad thoroughfare of Ilbury
Road, with its line of artistic red houses, detached
and standing in their gardens. The darkness was
falling as he turned into it and began to walk up
and down opposite the house with the big studio in
which he was once a welcome visitor. There was
a light in one of the bedroom windows and in the
hall, and presently, as Fane watched, a brougham
drove up to the door. It waited a few moments
before the house, then some one entered the carriage.
The door was banged; the horse moved
on. Through the windows Fane saw a woman's
face, pale, against the pane. It was the face of
Sydney. For a moment he thought he would call
[310]

to the coachman to stop. Then he restrained
himself, and again walked up and down, waiting.
She must return presently. He would speak to
her as she was getting out of the carriage. He
would force her to receive him.

Towards nine o'clock his plans were altered by
an event which took place. The house door
opened, and the footman came out with a handful
of letters for the post. The pillar-box was very
near, and the man carelessly left the hall door on
the jar while he walked down the road. Fane
caught a glimpse of the hall that he knew so well.
A step, and he could be in the house. He hesitated.
He looked down the road. The man had
his back turned, and was putting the letters into
the box. Fane slipped into the garden, up the
steps, through the door. The hall was empty.
At his right was the passage leading to the studio.
He stole down it, and tried the door. It opened.
In the darkness the heavy curtain blew against his
face. In another instant he closed the door softly
at his back, and stood alone in the wide space and
the blackness. Here there was not a glimmer of
light. Thick curtains fell over the windows.
No fire burned upon the hearth. There was no
sound except when a carriage occasionally rolled
down the road, and even then the wheels sounded
distant.

The silence and darkness had their effect upon
Fane. He had done a desperate thing; but, until
[311]

he found himself alone in the vacant studio, he had
not fully realised the madness of his conduct, and
how it would appear to the world. After the first
moments of solitude had passed he came to himself
a little, and half opened the door with the
intention of stealing out; but he heard steps in
the hall, and shrank back again like a guilty creature.
He must wait, at least, until the household
retired to rest.

And, waiting, the old, haunting thoughts came
back to assail him once more. He began to
brood over Sydney's cruel treatment of him, over
her vile suspicions. Here, in the atmosphere
which he knew so well—for a faint, strange perfume
always lingered about the studio, and gave
to it the subtle sense of life which certain perfumes
can impart—his emotions were gradually
quickened to fury. He recalled the days of his
intimacy with the sculptor, of his unrestrained converse
with Sydney. He recalled his care for the invalid,
persevered in, despite his passion, to the end.
And then his thought fastened upon the statue,
which, strange to say, he had almost forgotten.

The statue!

It must be there, with him, in the darkness,
staring with those white eyes in which he had seen
a soul flicker.

As the recollection of it came to him, he trembled,
leaning against the wall.

He was in one of those states of acute mental
[312]

tension in which the mind becomes so easily the
prey of the wildest fantasies, and slowly, laboriously,
he began to frame a connection between
the lifeless marble creature and his own dreary
trouble.

Because of one moment of folly Sydney treated
him as a pariah, as a criminal. Her gentle nature
had been transformed suddenly.

By what subtle influence?

Fane remembered the day of his first visit to
Ilbury Road, and his curious imagination that the
statue recognised and hated him.

Had that hatred prompted action? Was there
a devil lurking in the white, cold marble to work
his ruin? When Sydney sent him out of her
presence for ever, the watching face had seemed
to smile.

Fane set his teeth in the darkness. He was no
longer sane. He was possessed. The tragedy of
thought within him invited him to the execution of
another tragedy. He stretched out his hand with
the rehearsing action of one meditating a blow.

His hand fell upon an oak table that stood
against the wall, and hit on something smooth and
cold. It was a long Oriental dagger that the dead
sculptor had brought from the East. Fane's fingers
closed on it mechanically. The frigid steel
thrilled his hot palm, and a pulse in his forehead
started beating till there was a dull, senseless music
in his ears that irritated him.

[313]

He wanted to listen for the return of Sydney's
carriage.

His soul was ablaze with defiance. He was alone
in the darkness with his enemy; the cold, deadly,
blind, pulseless thing that yet was alive; the silent
thing that had yet whispered malign accusations
of him to the woman he loved; the nerveless thing
that poisoned a beautiful mind against him, that
stole the music from his harp of life and let loose
the winds upon his summer.

His fingers closed more tightly, more feverishly
upon the slippery steel.

Sydney actually thought, or strove to think, him
a criminal. What if he should earn the title? A
sound as of the sea beating was in his ears, and
flashes of strange light seem to leap to his vision.
What would a man worth the name do to his
enemy?

And he and his enemy were shut up alone together.

He drew himself up straight and steadied himself
against the wall, peering through the blackness
in the direction of the statue.

And, as he did so, there seemed to steal into the
atmosphere the breath of another living presence.
He could fancy he heard the pulse of another heart
beating near to his. The sensation increased upon
him powerfully until suspicion grew into conviction.

His intention had subtly communicated itself to
the thing he could not see.

[314]

He knew it was on guard.

There was no actual sound, no movement, but
the atmosphere became charged by degrees with a
deadly, numbing cold, like the breath of frost in
the air. A chill ran through Fane's blood. A
sluggish terror began to steal over him, folding him
for the moment in a strange inertia of mind and of
body. A creeping paralysis crawled upon his
senses, like the paralysis of nightmare that envelops
the dreamer. He opened his lips to speak,
but they chattered soundlessly. Mechanically his
hand clutched the thin, sharp steel of the dagger.

His enemy—then Sydney.

He would not be a coward. He struggled
against the horror that was upon him.

And still the cold increased, and the personality
of Fane's invisible companion seemed to develop in
power. There was a sort of silent violence in
the hidden room, as if a noiseless combat were
taking place. Waves of darkness were stirred into
motion; and Fane, as a man is drawn by the
retreating tides of the sea out and away, was
drawn from the wall where he had been crouching.

He stole along the floor, the dagger held in his
right hand, his heart barely beating, his lips white—nearer,
nearer to his enemy.

He counted each step, until he was enfolded in
the inmost circle of that deadly frost emanating
from the blackness before him.

Then, with a hoarse cry, he lifted his arm and
[315]

sprang forward and upward, dashing the dagger
down as one plunging it through a human heart.

The cry died suddenly into silence.

There was the sound of a heavy fall.

It reached the ears of the servants below stairs.

The footman took a light, and, with a scared
face, went hesitatingly to the studio door, paused
outside and listened while the female servants huddled
in the passage.

The heavy silence succeeding the strange sound
appalled them, but at length the man thrust the
door open and peered in.

The light from the candle flickered merrily
upon Fane's bowed figure, huddled face downwards
upon the floor.

His neck was broken.

The statue, that was the dead sculptor's last
earthly achievement, stood as if watching over
him. But it was no longer perfect and complete.

Some splinters of marble had been struck from
the left breast, and among them, on the smooth
parquet, lay a bent Oriental dagger.

[319]

A BOUDOIR BOY

I

â
It
is so impossible to be young,â Claude Melville
said very wearily, and with his little air of played-out
indifference. He was smoking a cigarette, as
always, and wore a dark red smoking-suit that, he
thought, went excellently with his black eyes and
swarthy complexion.

His father had been a blue-eyed Saxon giant,
his mother a pretty Kentish woman, with an apple-blossom
complexion and sunny hair; yet he
managed to look exquisitely Turkish, and thought
himself a clever boy for so doing. But then he
always thought himself clever. He had cultivated
this conception of himself until it had become a
confirmed habit of mind. On his head was a fez
with a tassel, and he was sitting upon the hearthrug
with his long legs crossed meditatively. His
room was dimly lit, and had an aspect of divans,
Attar of roses scented the air. A fire was burning,
although it was a spring evening and not cold.
London roared faintly in the distance, like a lion
at a far-away evening party.

âIt is so impossible to be young,â Claude repeated,
without emphasis. âI was middle-aged at
[320]

ten. Now I am twenty-two, and have done everything
I ought not to have done, I feel that life
has become altogether improbable. Even if I live
until I am seventy—the correct age for entering
into one's dotage, I believe—I cannot expect to
have a second childhood. I have never had a first.â

He sighed. It seemed so hard to be deprived of
one's legal dotage.

His friend, Jimmy Haddon, looked at him and
laughed. Jimmy was puffing at a pipe. His pipe
was the only one Claude ever allowed to be
smoked among his divans and his roses.

After thoroughly completing his laugh, Jimmy
remarked:—

âWould you like to take a lesson in the art of
being young?â

âImmensely.â

âI know somebody who could give you one.â

âReally, Jimmy! What strange people you
always know; curates, and women who have never
written improper novels, and all sorts of beings
who seem merely mythical to the rest of us!â

âThis is not a curate.â

âThen it must be a woman who has never
written an improper novel.â

âIt is.â

âAnd you mean to tell me seriously that there
is such a person? To see her would be to take
what
Punch
calls a pre-historic peep. She must
be ingeniously old.â

[321]

âShe is sixty-four, and she is my aunt.â

âHow beautiful of her. I am an only child, so
I can never be an uncle. It is one of my lasting
regrets, although I daresay that profession is terribly
overcrowded like the others. But why is she sixty-four?
It seems a risky thing for a woman to be?â

âShe takes the risk without thinking at all
about it.â

âShe must be very daring.â

âNo; she's only completely natural.â

âNatural. What is that?â

Jimmy laughed again. He was fond of Claude,
but he and Claude met so often chiefly because
they were extremes. Jimmy was a handsome
athlete, who had been called to the bar, and persistently
played cricket or football whenever the
courts were sitting. He was cursed with a large
private income, which he spent royally, and blessed
with a good heart. Once he had appeared for the
defence in a divorce case, which—lasting longer
than he had anticipated, owing to the obvious
guilt of all parties concerned in it, and the consequent
difficulty of getting an innocent jury to
agree about a verdict—had cost him a cricket
match. Since then he had looked upon the law
in the legendary way, as an ass, and spent most
of his time in exercising his muscles. In the
intervals of leisure which he allowed himself from
sports and pastimes, he saw a good deal of Claude,
who amused him, and whom he never bored. He
[322]

called him a boudoir boy, but had a real liking for
him, nevertheless, and sometimes longed to wake
him up, and separate him from the absurd
chiffons

with which he occupied his time. Now he laughed
at him openly, and Claude did not mind in the
least. They were really friends, however preposterous
such a friendship might seem.

âWhat is that? Well—my aunt. When you
see her you will understand thoroughly.â

âDoes she live in Park Lane or in Clapham?â

âShe lives in the country, in Northamptonshire,
is very well off, and has a place of her own.â

âAnd a husband?â

âNo. She is a prosperous spinster, dines the
local cricket team once a year, keeps the church
going, knows all the poor people, and all the rich
in the neighbourhood, and has only one fad.â

âWhat is that?â

âShe always wears her hair powdered. Come
down and stay with her, and she will teach you to
be young.â

âWell—but I am afraid she will work me very
hard.â

âNot she. You would like a new experience.â

Claude yawned, and blinked his long dark eyes
in a carefully Eastern manner.

âI am afraid there is no such thing left for me,â
he said with an elaborate dreariness. âStill, if
your aunt will invite me, I will come. Of course
you will accompany me, I must have a chaperon.â

[323]

âOf course.â

âAh!â Claude said, as a footman came softly
into the room, âhere is our absinthe. Now, Jimmy,
please do forget your horrible football, and I will
teach you to be decadent.â

âAs my aunt will teach you to be young—you
old boy.â

II

âMr Haddon has left, sir,â said the footman,
standing by Claude's bedside in the detached manner
of the well-bred domestic. âHere is a note
for you, sir; I was to give it you the first thing.â

And he handed it on a salver.

Claude stretched out his thin white arm and took
it, without manifesting any of the surprise that he
felt. When the footman had gone, he poured out
a cup of tea from the silver teapot that stood on a
small table at his elbow, sipped it, and quietly
opened the square envelope. The Northamptonshire
sun was pouring in with a countrified ardour
through the bedroom window. Outside the birds
twittered in Miss Haddon's cherished garden. For
Claude had come down at that contented spinster's
invitation to spend a week with her, bringing
Jimmy as chaperon, and this was the very first
morning of his visit. Now he learnt that his
chaperon had already âleft,â possibly to be a
âhalf-back,â or something equally ridiculous, at a
[324]

local football match in a neighbouring village.
Claude spread the note out and read it, while the
birds chirped to the very manifest spring.

â
Dear Boy
,—Good-bye, and good luck to you. I
know you are never angry, so it is scarcely worth while
to tell you not to be. I am off. Back in a week. You
will learn your lesson better alone with Aunt Kitty.
There is no absinthe in her cellar, but she knows good
champagne from bad. You will be all right. Study
hard.—Yours ever,

Jim
.â

Claude drank two cups of tea instead of his
usual one, and read the note four times. Then
he lay back, wrapping his dressing-gown—a fine
specimen of Cairene embroidery—closely round
him, shut his eyes, and seemed to go to sleep. All
he said to himself was:—

âJimmy writes a very dull letter.â

At half-past nine, Miss Haddon's house reverberated
in a hollow manner with the barbarous
music of a gong, the dressing-gong. Claude heard
it very unsympathetically, and felt rather inclined
merely to take off his dressing-gown, as an act of
mute defiance, and go deliberately to sleep, instead
of getting up and putting things on. But he remembered
his manners wearily, and slid out of bed
and into a carefully-warmed bath that was prepared
in the neighbouring dressing-room. Having completed
an intricate toilette, and tied a marvellously
[325]

subtle tie, shot with rigorously subdued, but voluptuous
colours, he sauntered downstairs in time to
be thoroughly immersed in the full clamour of the
second—or breakfast—gong, which he encountered
in the hall.

âWhy will people wake the dead merely because
they are going to eat a boiled egg and a bit of
toast?â he asked himself as he entered the breakfast-room.

Miss Haddon was standing by the window, reading
letters in the proper English manner. The
sun lay on her grey hair, which she wore dressed
high, and void of cap.

âYou are very punctual,â she said with a smile.
âI was going to send up to know whether you
would prefer to breakfast in your room. My
nephew told me you might like to. I shall be
glad to have your company. Jimmy has run away
and left us together, I find.â

âYes, Jimmy has run away,â Claude answered,
beginning slowly to feel the full force of Jimmy's
perfidy. He looked at Miss Haddon's cheerful,
rosy face, and bright brown eyes, and wondered
whether she had been in the plot.

âI hope you will not be bored,â Miss Haddon
went on, as they sat down together, the intonation
of her melodious elderly voice seeming to dismiss
the supposition, even while she suggested it. âBut,
indeed, I think it is almost impossible to be bored
in the country.â

[326]

Claude, who was always either in London or
Paris, looked frankly astonished. In handing him
his cup of tea, Miss Haddon noticed it.

âYou don't agree with me?â she asked.

âI cannot disagree, at least,â he said; âbecause,
to tell the truth, I am always in towns.â

âProbably you are happy there then,â she rejoined,
with a briskness that was agreeable, because
it was not a hideous assumption, like the geniality
that often prevails, fitfully, at Christmas time.

But Claude could not permit his hostess to
remain comfortable in this utterly erroneous
belief.

âOh, please—â he said, with gentle rebuke,
âI am not happy anywhere.â

Miss Haddon glanced at him with a gay and
whimsical, but decidedly acute, scrutiny.

âPerhaps you are too young to be happy,â she
said; âyou have not suffered enough.â

âI have never been young,â he answered, eating
his devilled kidney with a silent pathos of perseverance—ânever.â

âAnd I shall never be old, or, at any rate, feel
old. It can't be done. I'm sixty-four, and look
it, but I can't cease to revel in details, take an interest
in people, and regard life as my half-opened
oyster. It is a pity one can't go on living till one
is two or three hundred or so. There is so much
to see and know. Our existence in the world is
like a day at the Stores. We have to go away
[327]

before we have been into a quarter of the different
departments.â

âI don't find life at all like that. I have seen
all the departments till I am sick of them. But
perhaps you never come to London?â

âEvery year for three months to see my
friends. I stay at an hotel. It is a most delightful
time.â

Her tone was warm with pleasant memories.
Claude felt himself more and more surprised.

âYou enjoy the country, and London?â he
said.

âI enjoy everything,â said Miss Haddon. âAnd
surely most people do.â

âNone of the people I know seem to enjoy
anything very much. They try everything, of
course. That is one's duty.â

âThen the latest literature really reflects life, I
imagine,â Miss Haddon said. âIf what you say
is true, everything includes the sins as well as the
virtues. I have often wondered whether the books
that I have thought utterly and absurdly false
could possibly be the outcome of facts.â

âSuch as what books?â

âOh, I'll name no names. The authors may
be your personal friends. But it is so then? In
their search after happiness the people of to-day,
the moderns, give the warm shoulder to vice as
well as to virtue?â

âThey ignore nothing.â

[328]

âNot even duty?â

âOur duty is to ourselves, and can never be
ignored.â

Miss Haddon tapped a boiled egg very sharply
on its head with a spoon. She wondered if the
action were a performance of duty to herself or to
the egg.

âThat, I understand,â she remarked briskly,
âis the doctrine of what is called in London the
young decadent; and in the country—forgive me—sometimes
the young devil of the day.â

âI am decadent, Miss Haddon,â Claude said
with a gentle pride that was not wholly ungraceful.

The elderly lady swept him with a bright look
of fresh and healthy interest.

âHow exciting,â she exclaimed, after a moment's
decisive pause, but with a completely
natural air. âYou are the first I have seen. For
Jimmy isn't one, is he?â

âJimmy! No. He plays football, and eats
cold roast beef and cheese for lunch.â

âDo tell me—how does one do it?â

She seemed intensely interested, and was merrily
munching an apple grown in one of her own
orchards.

Claude raised his dark eyebrows.

âI beg your pardon?â

âHow does one become a decadent? I have
heard so much about you all, about your clever
[329]
ness,
and your clothes, and the things you write,
and draw, and smoke, and think, and—and
eat—â

She seemed suddenly struck by a bright idea.

âOh, Mr Melville!â she exclaimed, leaning
forward behind the great silver urn, and darting at
him a glance of imploring earnestness, âwill you
do me a favour? We are left to ourselves for a
whole week. Teach me, teach me to be a
decadent.â

âBut I thought you were going to teach me to
be yo—â Claude began, and stopped just in time.
âI mean—er—â

He paused, and they gazed at each other.
There was meditation in the boy's eyes. He was
wondering seriously whether it would be possible
for an elderly spinster lady, of countrified morals
and rural procedure, to be decadent. She was
rather stout, too, and appeared painfully healthy.

âWill you?â Miss Haddon breathed across the
urn and the teapot.

âWell, we might try,â Claude answered doubtfully.

He was remarking to himself:—

âPoor, dear Jimmy! He certainly doesn't
understand his aunt!â

She was murmuring in her mind: âI have
always heard they have no sense of humour!â

[330]

III

âMr Melville, Mr Melville,â cried Miss
Haddon's voice towards evening on the following
day, âthe absinthe has arrived!â

Claude came out languidly into the hall.

âHas it?â he said dreamily.

âYes, and Paul Verlaine's poetry, and the blue
books—I mean the yellow books, andâ (rummaging
in a just-opened parcel) âyes, here are two
novels by Catulle Mendez, and a box of those
rose-tipped cigarettes. Now, what ought I to do?
Shall we have some absinthe instead of our tea, or
what?â

Claude looked at her with a momentary suspicion,
but her grey hair crowned an eager face
decorated with an honest expression. The suspicion
was lulled to rest.

âWe had better have our tea,â he answered
slowly. âI like my absinthe about an hour or so
before dinner.â

âVery well. Tea, James, and muffins.â

The butler retired with fat dignity, but wondering
not a little at the unusual vagaries of his mistress.
Miss Haddon and Claude, laden with
books, repaired to the drawing-room and sat down
by the fire. Claude placed himself, cross-legged,
upon a cushion on the floor. The box of rose-tipped
cigarettes was in his hand. Miss Haddon
[331]

regarded him expectantly from her sofa. Her
expression seemed continually exclaiming, âWhat's
to be done now?â

The boy felt that this was not right, and endeavoured
gently to correct it.

âPlease try to be a little—a—â

âYes?â

âA little more restrained,â he said. âWhat
we feel about life is that it should never be crude.
All extremes are crude.â

âWhat—even extremes of wickedness?â

He hesitated.

âWell, certainly extremes of goodness, or
happiness, or anything of that kind. When one
comes to think of it seriously, happiness is really
absurd, is it not? Just consider how preposterous
what is called a happy face always looks, covered
with those dreadful, wrinkled things named smiles,
all the teeth showing, and so on. I know you
agree with me. Happiness drives all thought out
of a face, and distorts the features in a most painful
manner. When I go out walking on a Bank
Holiday, a thing I seldom do, I always think a
cheerful expression the most degrading of all expressions.
A contented clerk disfigures a whole
street—really.â

Miss Haddon's appearance had gradually grown
very sombre during this speech, and she did not
brighten up on the approach of tea and muffins
on a wicker table whimsical with little shelves.

[332]

âPerhaps you are right,â she said. âI daresay
happiness is unreasonable. Ought I to sit on the
floor too?â

Claude deprecated such an act on the part of his
hostess. Sitting on the floor was one of his pet
originalities, and he hated rivalry. Besides, Miss
Haddon was distinctly too stout for that sort of
thing.

âI do it because I feel so Turkish,â he explained.
âOtherwise, it would be an assumption,
and not naÃ¯ve. People make a great mistake in
fancying the decadent is unnatural. If anything,
he is too natural. He follows his whim. The
world only calls us natural when we do everything
we dislike. If Rossetti had played football every
Saturday, his poetry would have been much more
read in England than it has been. Yes, please, I
will have another muffin.â

âBut I think I feel Turkish too,â Miss Haddon
said calmly. âYes, I am sure I do. I ought not
to resist it; ought I? Otherwise I shall be flying
in the face of your beautiful theories.â And she
squatted down on the floor at his elbow.

Claude had a wonderful purple moment of acute
irritation, during which he felt strangely natural.
Miss Haddon did not appear to notice it. She
went on bombarding him with questions in a cheery
manner until he began to be rather ill, but her face
never lost its expression of grave sadness, a strange,
inexplicable melancholy that was not in the least
[333]

Bank Holiday. The contrast between her expression
and her voice worried Claude, as an intelligent
pantaloon might worry a clown. He felt that
something was wrong. Either face or voice required
alteration. And then questions are like
death—extremely irksome. Besides, he found it
difficult to answer many of them, difficult to define
precisely the position of the decadent, his intentions
and his aims. It was no use to tell Miss
Haddon that he didn't possess either the one or
the other. Always with the same definitely sad
face, the same definitely cheerful voice, she declined
to believe him. He fidgeted on his cushion,
and his Turkish placidity threatened to be seriously
disturbed.

The appearance of the absinthe created a diversion.
Claude arranged a glass of it, much diluted
with water, for the benefit of his hostess, and she
began to sip it with an air of determined reverence.

âIt tastes like the smell of a drag hunt,â she
said after a while.

Claude's gently-lifted eyebrows proclaimed misapprehension.

âWhen they drag a trail over a course and
satisfy the hounds with a dead rabbit at the end of
it,â she explained.

âMy dear lady,â he protested plaintively.
âReally, you do not grasp the inner meaning of
what you are drinking. Presently the most perfect
sensation will steal over you, a curious happy de
[334]
tachment
from everything, as if you were floating
in some exquisite element. You will not care
what happens, or what—â

âBut must I drink it all before I feel detached?â
she asked. âIt's really so very nasty, quite disgusting
to the taste. Surely you think so.â

âI drink it for its after-effect.â

âIs it like a good act that costs us pain at the
moment, and gives us the pleasure of self-satisfaction
ultimately?â

âI don't know,â the boy exclaimed abruptly.
To compare absinthe to a good act seemed to him
quite intolerable.

He let his rose-tipped cigarette go out, and was
glad when the dressing gong sounded in the hall.

Miss Haddon sprang up from the floor briskly.

âI rather admire you for drinking this stuff,â she
said. âI am sure you do it to mortify the flesh.
A Lenten penance out of Lent is most invigorating
to the mind.â

As Claude went up to dress, he felt as if he never
wished to touch absinthe again. The glitter of its
personality was dulled for him now that it was
looked upon as merely a nasty sort of medicine to
be indulged in as a mortification of the flesh, like
wearing a hair shirt, or rejecting meat on Fridays.
He found Miss Haddon painfully prosaic. It
seemed almost silly to be a decadent in her company.
To feel Turkish alone was graceful and
quaint, almost intellectual, but to have an old lady
[335]

feeling Turkish, too, and squatting on the floor to
emphasise the sensation, was tragic, seemed to bring
imbecility very near. Claude dressed with unusual
agitation, and made a distinct failure of his tie.

All through dinner Miss Haddon talked optimistically
about her prospects as a successful decadent,
much as if she were discussing her future on the
Stock Exchange, or as the editor of a paper. She
calculated that at her present rate of progress she
ought to be almost on a level with her guest by the
end of the week, and spoke hopefully of ceasing to
take any interest in the ordinary facts of life, of
learning a proper contempt for all healthy-minded
humanity, and of appreciating at its proper value
what seems to ordinary people, weak-kneed affection
in literature, in art, and, above all, in movement
and in appearance. Her bright eyes flashed
upon Claude beneath her crown of powdered hair,
as she talked, and the big room rang with her
jovial voice.

The boy began to feel exceedingly confused.
Yet he had never been less bored. Miss Haddon
might be stout and sixty-four. Nevertheless, her
net personality was far less wearisome than that of
many a town-bred sylph. Unconsciously Claude
ate with a hearty appetite, indulged immoderately
in excellent roast beef, and even swallowed a
beautifully-cooked Spanish onion without thinking
of the committal of a crime. During dessert
Miss Haddon gave him a racy description of a rural
[336]

cricket match and of the supper and speeches which
followed it, and he found himself laughing heartily
and wishing he had been there. He pulled himself
up short with a sudden sensation of horror,
and his hostess rose to go into the drawing-room.

âShall we play Halma or Ek Bahr?â she asked;
âor would they be out of order? I wish particularly
to conform to all your tenets.â

âDear lady, please, we have no tenets,â he protested.
âDo remember that, or you will never
become what you wish. But I do not care for
any games.â

âThen shall we sit down and each read a volume
of the âYellow Bookâ?â

She hastened towards a table to find copies of
that work, but something in her brisk and anxious
movement caused Claude to exclaim hurriedly:

âPlease—please teach me Halma.â

That night he went up to bed flushed with
triumph.

Miss Haddon had allowed him to win a couple
of games. Never before had he felt so absolutely
certain of the unusual acuteness of his intellect.

IV

Three days later, Miss Haddon and Claude
Melville were feeding chickens—under protest.

âI mean to give it up, of course,â the former
[337]

said. âIt's a degrading pursuit; it's almost as
bad as the âthings that Jimmy does,â the things
that give him such a marvellous complexion and
keep his figure so magnificent.â

She threw a handful of grain to the frenzied
denizens of the enlarged meat-safe before them,
and added in a tone of pensive reflectiveness:

âWhy is it, I wonder, that these actions which,
as you have taught me, are unworthy of thinking
people, tend to make the body so beautiful, the
eyes so bright and clear, the cheeks rose-tinted, the
limbs straight and supple?â

All the time that she was speaking her glance
crept musingly over Claude's tall, but weak-looking
and rather flaccid form, seeming to pause on
his thin undeveloped arms, his lanky legs, and his
slightly yellow face. That face began to flush.
She sighed.

âThere must be something radically wrong in
the scheme of the universe,â she continued. âBut,
of course, one ought to live for the mind and for
subtle sensations, even though they do make one
look an object.â

Her eyes were on the chickens now, who were
fighting like feathered furies, pouncing, clucking,
running for safety, grain in beak, or, with a fiery
anxiety, chasing the favoured brethren who had
secured a morsel and were hoping to be permitted
to swallow it. Claude glanced at her furtively
out of the corner of his eye, and endeavoured,
[338]

for the first time in his life, to stand erect and
broaden his rather narrow chest.

Silently he resolved to give instructions to his
tailor not to spare the padding in his future coats.
He was glad, too, that knee-breeches, for which
he had occasionally sighed, had not come into
fashion again. After all, modern dress had its
little advantages. Miss Haddon was still scattering
grain, rather in the attitude of Millet's
â
Sower
,â and still talking reflectively.

âWe must try to convert Jimmy,â she said.
âI have a good deal of influence over him, Mr
Melville. We must try to make him more like you,
more thoughtful, more inactive, more frankly sensual,
more fond of sofas, in the future than he has been
in the past. Do you know, I am ashamed to say it,
but I don't believe I have ever seen Jimmy lying
on a sofa. Poor Jimmy! Look at that hen! She
is choking. Hens gulp their food so! And then,
he's inclined to be persistently unselfish. That
must be stopped too. I have learnt from you that
to be decadent one must be acutely and untiringly
selfish. The blessings of selfishness! What a
volume might be written upon them! Mr Melville,
all chickens must be decadent, for all chickens are
entirely selfish. It is strange to think that the
average fowl is more advanced in ethics—is it
ethics I mean?—than the average man or woman,
is it not? And we ate a decadent at dinner last
night. I feel almost like a cannibal.â

[339]

She threw away the last grain, and was silent.
But suddenly Claude spoke.

âMiss Haddon,â he said, and his voice had
never sounded so boyish to her before, âyou have
been laughing at me for nearly a week.â He
paused, then he went on, rather unevenly, in the
up-and-down tones induced by stifled excitement,
âand I have never found it out until this moment.
I suppose you think me a great fool. I daresay
I have been one. But please don't—I mean,
please let us give up acting our farce.â

âBut have we reached the third act?â she
said.

They were walking through the garden, among
the crocuses and violets now.

âI am sure I don't know,â he answered, trying
to seem easy. âPerhaps it is a farce in one act.â

âPerhaps it is not a farce at all, my dear boy,â
she said very gently and with a sudden old-world
gravity that was not without its grace.

They reached the house. She put her basket
down on the oak table in the wide hall, and faced
him in the eager way that was natural to her, and
that was so youthful.

âMr Melville—Claude,â she said, as she held
out her hand, clad in a very countrified brown glove,
with a fan-like gauntlet, âof all Jimmy's friends
I think I shall like you the best. People who have
acted together ought to be good comrades.â

He took the hand. That seemed necessary.

[340]

âBut I haven't been acting,â he said.

âOh, yes, you have,â she answered, âand I
have only been on the stage for a week; while
you—well, I suppose you have been on it for at
least two or three years. I am taking my farewell
of it this morning, and you—?â

The boy's face was deeply flushed, but he did
not look, or feel, actually angry.

âI don't know about myself yet,â he said.

âThink it all over,â the old lady exclaimed.
âAnd now let us have lunch. I am hungry.â

Jimmy arrived that evening.

âHow old are you, Claude?â he exclaimed,
clapping his friend on the back.

âI am not sure,â Claude replied. âBut I
almost begin to wish that I were sixty-four.â

THE TEE-TO-TUM

I

Jack Burnham
was quite determined not to
marry Mrs Lorton, and if there was one thing in
the world upon which she had rigidly set her heart
it was upon refusing him. There were several
things about her which he deliberately disliked. In
the first place, she was a widow, and he always had
an uneasy suspicion that widows, like dynamite,
were mysteriously dangerous. Then her Christian
name was Harriet, and she never took afternoon
tea. The former of these two facts indicated,
according to his ideas, that her parents were people
of bad taste, the latter that she possessed notions
that were against nature. Also, she was well informed,
and knew it. This condition of the mind,
he considered, should be the blessed birthright of
the male sex, and he looked upon her as an usurper.
She didn't wear mourning, which implied that she
was forgetful—of dead husbands. Then—well,
that was about all he had against her, and it was
quite enough.

As for her, the whole nature of her protested
eloquently against the way he waxed his moustache,
against the colour of his brown hair, and of his
[344]

brown boots, against his lounging gait, and his
opinion of Mr Gladstone. He had a certain arrogance
about him, when with her, which arose in
truth from his fear of her intellectual prowess.
This led her to dub him intolerably conceited. She
desired to humble him, and considered that she
could best do so by refusing his offer of marriage.
But she must first persuade him to propose. That
was the difficulty.

They were constantly meeting in London. You
always constantly meet your enemies in London.
And, when they met, they always devoted a great
deal of time to the advancement of the tacit and
polite quarrel between them. They argued with
one another in Hyde Park on fine mornings, and
were really disgusted with one another at dinner
parties and âAt Homes.â He thought her fast—at
balls; and she had once considered him blatant—at
a Marlborough House garden party. This
last fact, indeed, put the coping stone to the feud
between them, for Mrs Lorton expressed her
opinion to a friend, and Burnham, of course, got to
know of it. To be thought blatant at Marlborough
House was really intolerable. One might as well
be pronounced to have had a heathen air at Lambeth
Palace.

Distinctly, Jack Burnham and Harriet Lorton
were acutely antagonistic.

Yet, there must surely have been some strange,
unknown link of sympathy between them, for they
[345]

both caught the influenza on the same day—it
was a Sunday morning—and both permitted it to
develop into double pneumonia.

After all, spar as we may, are we not all brothers
and sisters?

The double pneumonia ought to have drawn
them together; but, as he lived in Piccadilly and she
in Queen's Gate, and each was thoroughly self-centred—nothing
produces egoism so certainly as
influenza—neither knew of the illness of the other.

Providence denied to both that subtle joy, and
they got to the mutton chop and chipped potato
stage of convalescence in childlike ignorance of
each other's misfortune.

There must certainly have been a curious community
of mind between them, for both their doctors
ordered them to Margate, and they both took
rooms at Westgate. Now a similar taste in seaside
places is undoubtedly an excellent foundation for
eternal friendship. Let the world crumble in atoms,
two people who both like Westgate will still find
something to talk about amid the confusion occasioned
by the dissolution of kingdoms.

Jack Burnham arrived at the St Mildred's Hotel
on a Thursday, with his man.

Harriet Lorton came on the following Friday,
with her maid.

Neither had any notion of the other's proceedings
until they met back to back, as you shall presently
hear.

[346]

II

In ordinary circumstances of health and vigour,
Burnham and Mrs Lorton possessed dispositions
of quite singular vivacity, looked upon life as a
fairly good, if rather practical joke, and were fully
disposed to consider happiness their
mÃ©tier
. Being
modern, they sometimes concealed their original
gaiety, as if it were original sin, and pretended to
a cruel cynicism; yet at heart, it must be confessed,
they were as lively as poor children playing
in the street. But when they went to Westgate,
influenza had had its fill of them, and the infinite
pathos of the world, and of all that is therein,
appealed to them with a seizing vitality. Burnham,
on the Thursday, was moved to tears at Birchington
Station by the sight of a mother and eleven
children missing the last train to Margate. Harriet
Lorton, on the following Friday, had hysterics at
Victoria, when she perceived a young lady drop a
cage containing a grey parrot, and smash the bird's
china bath upon the platform. The fact that the
parrot had been actually taking its bath at the
moment, and was left by the misfortune in much
confusion and no water, struck her so poignantly
as nearly to break her heart. She wept in a first-class
carriage all the way down, and arrived at
Westgate, towards ten o'clock, in a state of complete
collapse.

[347]

Mr Burnham was in bed drinking a cup of
soup at this time. He heard the luggage being
carried up, but did not suspect whose it was.
Nevertheless, the ravages of disease led him to
consider the slight noise and bustle a personal
insult, and he lay awake most of the night brooding
upon the wrongs of which he, erroneously, believed
himself to be the victim.

It was on the next morning that the two invalids
met back to back in a shelter with glass partitions
upon the lawn.

Mrs Lorton, smothered in wraps, had taken up
her position on the bench that faces Westgate
without noticing a bowed and ulstered figure, shod
in brown boots, sitting in a haggard posture on the
reciprocal bench that faces the sea. Nobody was
about, for it was not the season, and Mrs Lorton
began slowly to weep on account of the loneliness.
It struck her disordered fancy as so personal.
Creation was sending her to Coventry. At her
back the tears ran over Burnham's handsome countenance.
He was staring at the sea, and thinking
of all the people who had been drowned in water
since the days of the Deluge. He wondered how
many there were, and cried copiously, considering
himself absolutely alone and free to give vent to his
feelings, which struck him as splendidly human.

When two people weep together one of them
usually weeps louder than the other, and, on this
occasion, Burnham made the most noise. He
[348]

became, in fact, so uproariously solicitous about
the drowned men and women whom he had never
known that Mrs Lorton gradually was made aware
of the presence of another mourner who was not
a mute. She turned round and beheld a back convulsed
with emotion. Its grief went straight to
her heart, and, casting her own sorrow and her
sense of etiquette to the wind—which blew
bracingly from the north-east—she tapped upon
the glass screen that bisected the shelter.

Burnham took no notice. He was too deeply
involved in grief. So Mrs Lorton knocked again,
with all the vigour that incipient convalescence
gave to her. This time Burnham was startled, and
turned a hollow face upon her. They stared at
each other through the intervening glass for a
moment in wild surprise, the tears congealing upon
their cheeks.

Beyond Burnham Mrs Lorton saw the whirling
white foam of the sea. Beyond Mrs Lorton
Burnham saw the neat villas of Westgate. It
struck them both as a tremendous moment, and
they trembled.

Remember that they were very weak.

At last he, conceiving naturally that she had
recognised and desired to summon him, walked
slowly round to her side of the shelter, and held
out to her a wavering hand.

âGood heavens!â he ejaculated. âThe last
person I—â

[349]

âYou!â said Mrs Lorton. âHow astonishing!
What on earth—â

He seized the opening she gave him with all the
ardour of the whole-souled influenza patient.

âI have been ill,â he said with a deep pathos,
âvery, very ill. My symptoms were most extraordinary.â

He sank down heavily at her side, and continued,
âI doubt if any one has endured such agony
before. It began on a Sunday with—â

âSo did mine,â Mrs Lorton interrupted with
some show of determination. âYou cannot conceive
what it was like. I had pains in every limb,
every limb positively. The doctor—â

âOf course I went straight to bed,â he remarked
with firmness. âI knew at once what
was wrong. But mine was no ordinary case.
Talk of thumbscrews! Why—â

âFor nights I tossed in agony,â she went on
with a poignant self-pity, so much engrossed that
she never noticed the brown boots which on other
occasions had so deeply offended her. âMorphia
and eucalyptus were no—â

âHe said it was pneumonia, double pneumonia,â
Burnham concluded emphatically. âHow
I came through it I shall never know.â His
smile at this point was wan, and seemed to
deprecate existence. âI suppose there is still
some work for me to do. At the same time,
I—â

[350]

âMine was also double!â Mrs Lorton said with
distinct tartness, condemning privately his arrogance,
and noticing the boots with a strange feeling
of sudden and unutterable despair.

âIt is all so much worse for a woman,â she
added vaguely, with some idea of out-doing him,
such as she had felt once or twice at dinner parties,
when her epigrams had been smarter than his.

âThe strong possess a greater capacity for suffering
than the weak,â Burnham retorted. âMedical
science tells us that—â

âPlease spare me the revelations of the dissecting-room,â
she cried bitterly; âI am in no condition
to bear them.â

She glanced at him with pathetic eyes, and
added, âI ought to have gone to Margate.â

âI ought to have gone there too,â he said.

âReally, you make the conversation sound like
one of Maeterlinck's plays,â she rejoined. âDo be
more original.â

The reproach cut him to the heart. He never
knew why, but he felt so much injured that he
with great difficulty restrained his tears.

âWomen can be very brutal,â he said moodily,
biting his lips, and wondering how many authors
it was necessary to read in order never to be at a
disadvantage with a clever woman.

Mrs Lorton was conscious that she had hurt
him, and instead of being her nice, natural self and
glorying in the fact, she experienced a sense of
[351]

profound pity that gave her quite a tightened
feeling about the left side. However, she only
said, âMen can be very selfishâ—a generality
that many people consider as convincing as a
bomb—and got up to go.

âI am staying at the St Mildred's,â she remarked.
âIt is the dull season, so I am the only
person there at present.â

âI beg your pardon,â Burnham said, also getting
upon his feet, âI am there too. My number is 12
and I have a private sitting-room. I do not feel
up to the coffee-room yet.â

Mrs Lorton turned as pale as ashes with vexation.
She had no private sitting-room, and had
ordered dinner in the coffee-room for that very
evening.

She felt herself at a disadvantage as they walked
in a gloomy silence towards the beach.

III

Three days had passed away, and Jack Burnham
had found that he was, in his own phrase, âup to
the coffee-roomâ after all. In consequence, Mrs
Lorton and he dined there every evening at separate
tables. A sense of rivalry—and there is no
rivalry more keen than that between contesting
invalids—prevented both of them from eating as
much as they would have liked. When the widow
[352]

refused a course, Burnham shook his head at it
wearily, and they rose from their meals in a state
of passionate hunger, which they solaced with captain's
biscuits in the seclusion of their bedrooms.
Since they had Westgate almost to themselves,
and the weather was becoming bright and warm,
they were much out of doors; but their profound
depression still continued, and they were as morbid
human beings as Max Nordau could have desired
to meet with when he was seeking for specimens
of degeneration.

Their continual greedy anxiety to narrate the
details of their physical and mental sensations drove
them to seek one another's company, and soon it
became an understood thing that they should sit
together on the lawn or in the winter garden during
the morning, and stroll feebly in the direction
of Margate during the breezy afternoon.

These times were times of battle, of a struggle
for supremacy in symptoms that led to much heart
searching and to infinite exaggeration. Mrs Lorton,
being a woman, generally got the best of it,
and Burnham entered the hotel at tea-time with
set teeth, and an appalling sense of injustice and of
failure in his breast. One night at dinner, determined
to conquer or to die, he refused everything
but soup; and noted, with a grim satisfaction, that
Mrs Lorton could hardly contain her chagrin at
having inadvertently devoured a cutlet and a spoonful
of jelly. Indeed, her temper was so much
[353]

upset by this occurrence that she went straight to
bed on leaving the coffee-room, and sent down a
message the next morning to say that she was far
too ill to venture out.

Burnham, therefore, sat in the shelter alone,
cursing the craft of woman. In the intervals between
the cursings he was conscious of a certain
loneliness that seemed to be in the atmosphere.
It hovered with the seagulls above the sprightly
waves, swept over the lawn hand in hand with the
wind, basked in the sunshine, and companioned
him closely upon the esplanade as he walked home
to lunch. He was puzzled by it.

At lunch-time Mrs Lorton was still confined to
bed, so her maid announced. Burnham promptly
began to wonder whether she was going to die.
He strolled towards Margate wondering, and found
himself presently in the sunset, gazing with tears
in his eyes at the silhouette of Margate Pier, and,
mentally, placing a reverent tribute of flowers from
Covent Garden upon her early grave in Brompton
Cemetery.

He also found himself, later, dropping a tear at
the thought of his own death, for of course with
his weak health he could not hope to outlive anybody
for very long. Mrs Lorton's absence at
dinner struck him as more pathetic than all the
misery of the travailing universe, until he remembered
that at last he could gratify his appetite, and
even accept two
entrÃ©es
at the hands of the waiter.

[354]

Life, if it is full of sorrows, is also full of consolations.

He ate steadily for a couple of hours, pitying
himself all the time.

Next day Mrs Lorton re-appeared in a very bad
temper. Her seclusion, although it had enabled
her to score several points off her rival, had been
in other respects wearisome and vexatious. She
barely nodded to Burnham, and went out towards
the shelter alone. He followed furtively, longing,
as usual, for condolence, and presently saw her
seat herself facing the sea. The strained relations
between them seemed to forbid his placing himself
at her side. The back-to-back posture would be
more illustrative of the exact position of affairs,
and Burnham's nicety and accuracy of mind induced
him accordingly to face Westgate. Their
positions of the first day were thus reversed. She
looked at the sea; he stared at the villas. Strange
turmoil of life, in which we never know which
way we shall be facing next! It struck Burnham
suddenly, and so forcibly,
Ã  propos
of his and Mrs
Lorton's reversal, that the ready tears sprang to
his eyes. How would it all end? Man spins about
like a tee-to-tum, bowing to all points of the compass.
The time comes when the tee-to-tum runs
down—and what then? Burnham was certainly
run down. That must be his excuse for what he
did. He glanced behind him through the glass
screen, and saw by the motion of Mrs Lorton's back
[355]

that she was sobbing. In truth, the sight of the
dancing waves had set her thinking of all the poor
people who have been drowned in water since the
beginning of things. Poor dead folk! She was
trembling with emotion, and still wept mechanically
when she found Mr Burnham on her side of
the shelter proposing to her with all his might and
main. He was asking her to comfort him, to be
a true woman and shield him with her strength,
to support his tottering footsteps along the rugged
ways of life, to dry his tears and stay the agonies
of his shaken soul.

âYour health will help my weakness,â he said.
âYour vigour will teach me to be strong.â

It was a strange proposal, and she began to
defend herself from his imputations, stating her
maladies, marshalling her symptoms of decay in an
imposing procession.

But it was no good. He had taken her unawares
and got the start of her. She felt it, and
his determined weakness obtained a power over
her which she could never afterwards explain.

His influenza triumphed, for she forgot her resolution.

A wave of morbid pity for him swept over
the woman in her. If he was disorganised now,
what would be his condition if she refused
him?

âHave I the right,â she asked herself, âto devote
a fellow-creature to everlasting misery?â

[356]

Her influenza told her plainly that she had not.

People say that the marriage will really come off.

Jack Burnham announced it everywhere before
Mrs Lorton got thoroughly well, and Mrs Lorton
told everybody while Jack Burnham was still what
his friends called âawfully dicky.â

One can but hope that their married life will be
passed on the same side of the shelter. If he
persists in facing the sea, and she in staring at the
villas—well, they will live most of Ibsen's plays!

But at least they will be modern.

And so the tee-to-tum, thought of pathetically
by Burnham on a memorable occasion, spins round,
and the sea and the villas are the two aspects of
life.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

(Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

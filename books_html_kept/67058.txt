MILDREDâS MARRIED LIFE.

CHAPTER
I.

âO married love! each heart shall own,

Where two congenial souls unite,

Thy golden chains inlaid with down,

Thy lamp with heavenâs own splendor bright.â

—​
Langhorne.

What
a happy winter that was!—​the first of
Mildredâs married life. Her cup of bliss
seemed full to overflowing. She was very
proud of her husband, and not without reason,
for his was a noble character; he was a man of
sterling worth, lofty aims, cultivated mind, and
polished address.

They were a pair of lovers who grew more
and more enamored of each other day by day
as the weeks and months rolled on.

And while the new love flooded Mildredâs
pathway with light, the old loves, so dear, so
long tried and true, had not to be given up:
she was still a member of the home circle, a
sharer in all its interests and pleasures, its cares
and its joys.

There was no interruption of the mutual
sympathy and helpfulness of mother and
daughter, brothers and sisters, nor was the
father deprived of the prized society of his
firstborn in the family gatherings about the
table or in the cosy sitting-room or parlor when
evening brought rest from the toils and cares of
the day; she was there, as of old, ready to
cheer and entertain him with music or sprightly
conversation: brighter too, and more full of a
sweet and gentle gayety than of yore.

These things formed no mean or slight element
in Mildredâs happiness; yet there were
times when it was bliss to be alone with her
lover-husband in the privacy of their own apartments—​the
room that had always been hers
and a communicating one—​both of good size,
pleasant and cheery, and made doubly attractive
by perfect neatness and various tasteful little
feminine devices in which Mrs. Keith and her
daughters were thought to excel.

Mildred soon discovered that her husband
was far from neat and orderly in his habits;
but accepting the fact as the one inevitable yet
small thorn joined to her otherwise delicious
rose, she bore the trial with exemplary patience,
indulging in never a reproachful word or even
look as she quietly picked up and put in place
the books, papers, and garments which he scattered
here and there with reckless indifference
to consequences to them or himself.

Mildred thought her efforts were unappreciated
if not entirely unnoticed, until one day on
opening a drawer in search of some article
which he wanted in haste, he exclaimed at the
neat and orderly arrangement of its contents,
adding, âReally, Milly, my dear, I must say
with Solomon, that âhe that findeth a wife findeth
a good thing.â In my bachelor days Iâd
have had many a vexatious hunt for things
which now I always find in place, ready to my
hand. It has been my daily experience since I
became a benedict.â

Mildred looked up in pleased surprise. âI
have been half afraid my particularity about
such things was a trifle annoying to you,
Charlie,â she said in a gratified tone.

âNot at all, but my slovenliness must have
been seriously so to you,â he returned, coming
to her side. âIâll try to reform in that respect,â
he went on playfully, âand I wish
that, to help me, you would impose a fine for
every time you have my coat to hang up in the
wardrobe, my boots or slippers to put away in
the closet, or—​â

âOh, I should ruin you!â Mildred interrupted
with a light, gleeful, happy laugh.

âNot particularly complimentary that, to
either my good intentions or the supposed
amount of my income,â he returned, bending
over her to caress her hair and cheek. âBesides
it would depend largely upon the weight
of the fine. How heavy shall it be?â

âFix it yourself, since the idea is all your
own.â

âOne dollar each time for every article left
out of place; fine to be increased to not more
than five in case no improvement is manifest
within a month. How will that do?â

âOh,â laughed Mildred, âI shall certainly
impoverish you and speedily grow rich at your
expense.â

âCome now, little lady, about how often
have I transgressed against the rules of order
in the two weeks that we have shared these
rooms?â

âPerhaps twenty. I have kept no account;
so can only guess at it.â

âWell, really!â he sighed, in mock despair,
âI could not have believed I was quite so bad
as that. But all the more need for reform;
you must insist upon the fines, Milly. I canât
let you have so much trouble for nothing.â

âO Charlie! as if your love didnât pay me a
thousand times over!â she exclaimed, lifting to
his eyes dewy with mingled emotions—​love,
joy, and gratitude.

He answered with a tender caress and a smile
of ineffable affection.

âAnd then you have been so generous with
money, too,â Mildred went on. âWhy, I
never was so rich before in all my life! Iâve
not spent a fourth part of the hundred dollars I
found in my purse the day after our wedding.
And mother tells me you have insisted upon
paying a good deal more for our board than she
thinks it worth.â

âAh, dearest, circumstances alter cases, and
with more knowledge you and mother may
change your minds,â he replied, half absently.

Then after a momentâs silence, âThis is my
gift to my dear wife, and I cannot tell her how
glad I am to be able to make it. My darling,
will you accept it at your husbandâs hands?â

He had laid a folded paper in her lap.

âThank you,â she said playfully, and with a
pleased smile. âI canât imagine what it is,â
opening and glancing over it as she spoke.
âWhy!â half breathlessly, as she scrutinized it
with more care, then let it fall into her lap with
an astonished, half-incredulous look up into his
face, âCharlie, is it real?â she asked.

âEntirely so, dear Milly,â he answered, with
a tender smile.

âYou have endowed me with all your worldly
goods,â she said, half in assertion, half inquiringly.

âNo, my darling, not nearly half as yet. I
know you thought you were marrying a poor
man—​at least comparatively so—​but it was a
mistake. And oh the delight of being able to
give you ease and luxury! you who have toiled
so long and faithfully for yourself and others!â

He clasped her in his arms as he spoke, and
with a heart too full for speech, she laid her
head upon his breast and wept for very joy and
thankfulness that such love and tender protecting
care were hers.

There was space for little else in her thoughts
for the moment; the next she rejoiced keenly
in the wealth that put in her power so much
that it had long been in her heart to do for
others; yet rejoiced with trembling, remembering
the Masterâs words, âHow hardly shall
they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
God!â

If adversity had its trials prosperity was not
without its perils, and a most earnest, though
silent prayer went up that she might be kept
from trusting in uncertain riches or setting her
affection on earthly treasures.

âTears, darling?â said her husband, softly
stroking her hair. âI thought to give you joy
only.â

âThey are happy tears, Charlie,â she murmured,
lifting her face, putting an arm about his
neck, and gazing with loving eyes straight into
his; âand yet—​oh, I am almost afraid of so
much wealth!â And she went on to tell him
all that was in her heart.

âAh,â he replied, âI do not fear for you,
your very sense of the danger will tend to your
safe-keeping.â

âYes; if it keeps me close to the Master and
ever looking unto Him for strength to resist
temptation. Utter weakness in ourselves, we
may yet âbe strong in the Lord, and in the
power of His might.ââ

âYes, you know Paul tells us the Lord said
to him, âMy grace is sufficient for thee, for my
strength is made perfect in weakness.ââ

CHAPTER
II.

âWealth heaped on wealth, nor truth nor safety buys;

The dangers gather as the treasures rise.â

—​
Dr. Johnson.

Dr. Landreth
had an errand down-town.
Mildred stood at the window looking after him
with loving, admiring eyes. He turned at the
gate to lift his hat and kiss his hand to her with
a bow and smile, then sped on his way, she
watching until his manly form had disappeared
in the distance and the gathering darkness; for
evening was closing in.

But even now she did not turn from the
window, but still stood there, gazing into
vacancy, her thoughts full of the strange revelation
and surprising gift he had made to her
within the last hour.

She would go presently to mother and sisters
with the pleasant news, but first she must have
a little time alone with her best Friend, to pour
out her gratitude to Him and seek strength for
the new duties and responsibilities now laid
upon her, the new dangers and temptations
likely to beset her path.

A few moments had been passed thus when
her motherâs gentle rap was heard at the door
of her room. Mildred hastened to open it and
to unfold her wondrous tale, sure of entire,
loving sympathy in all the contending feelings
which agitated her.

She was not disappointed; but while Mrs.
Keith fully understood and appreciated Mildredâs
fear of the peculiar temptations of
wealth, she took a more hopeful view.

âDear daughter,â she said, âtrust in Him
who has promised, âAs thy days so shall thy
strength be,â and take with joy this good gift
He has sent you. Keep close to Him and you
will be safe, for âHe giveth more grace.ââ

There was great and unqualified rejoicing
among the younger members of the family
when they learned the news—​âthey were so
glad that hard times were over for dear Milly,
who had always been so helpful and kind to
everybody;â and so thoroughly did they believe
in her goodness that they had no fear for
her such as she felt for herself.

âMilly, what
are
you going to do with so
much money?â asked Annis, hanging about her
sisterâs chair; âyou can never spend it all.â

âSpend it!â cried Don contemptuously.
âOnly silly people think money was made just
to spend. Wise ones save it up for time of
need.â

âThe truly wise donât hoard all they have,
Don,â remarked Ada gravely.

âNo; of course they must live, and theyâll
pay their way honestly if they are the right sort
of folks.â

âAnd if they are that,â said Mildred, with a
sweet, bright smile irradiating her features,
âthey will feel that the money God gives them
is not wholly their own, to save and to spend.â

âOh no, to be sure! and what a nice big
tenth youâll have to give now, Milly,â exclaimed
Annis. âI wish youâd find some work
for me to do and pay me for it, so that Iâd have
more money to give to missions.â

âIâll pay you ten cents for every hour you
spend at the piano in faithful practice,â was
Mildredâs answer, as she playfully drew her little
pet sister to a seat upon her knee.

âO Milly! will you really?â cried the child,
clapping her hands in delight; âbut that will
be twenty cents a day when I practise two
hours, and I mean to, every day but Sunday.â

âAnd I make Fan the same offer,â Mildred
said, catching a half wistful, half eager glance
from the great gray eyes of that quiet, demure
little maiden.

The gray eyes sparkled and danced, their
owner saying, âO Milly, thank you ever so
much! Iâll be sure to earn twenty or thirty
cents every day.â

âForty or fifty cents a day for you to pay,
Milly!â Annis said in some anxiety.

âDonât be concerned, little sister, my purse
can stand even so grievous a drain as that,â
returned Mildred gayly.

âMildred,â said Ada, sighing slightly, âI
can hardly help envying you the blessing of
having so much money to do good with.â

âPerhaps your turn will come; at your age
I had no more prospect of it than you have
now,â Mildred said, gently putting Annis aside
and rising to leave the room; for she heard her
husbandâs step in the hall, and it was her wont
to hasten to meet him with a welcoming smile.
But pausing a moment at Adaâs side, âIt is a
great responsibility,â she added in an earnest
undertone; âyou must help me with your prayers
and sisterly warnings, to meet it aright.â

A liberal gift to each benevolent enterprise
of the church to which she belonged was
the first use Mildred made of her newly acquired
wealth. Next her thoughts busied themselves
with plans to increase the comfort and
happiness of her own dear ones; after that of
friends and neighbors.

There were some of these who might not be
approached as objects of charity, yet whose
means were so small as to afford them little beyond
the bare necessaries of life. Meantime
her husband was thinking of her and how he
might add to her comfort and pleasure.

It was now early in November, but the
woods had not lost all their autumnal beauty,
and the weather was unusually mild for the time
of year. They had had many delightful walks
and drives together.

Now Dr. Landreth proposed a trip to Chicago,
and Mildred gave a joyful assent. There
would be ten miles of staging, then three or
four hours of railway travel, making a journey
just long enough for a pleasure trip, they
thought; and a short sojourn in the city would
be an agreeable variety to Mildred at least, she
having been scarcely outside of Pleasant Plains
for the last six or eight years.

With a heart full of quiet happiness and
overflowing with gratitude to the Giver of all
good, she set about the needful preparation.
No great amount of it was needed, as they were
only going sightseeing and shopping; it could
all be done in one day, and they would start
early the next morning.

Alone in her own room, packing her trunk,
her thoughts reverted to a friend, a most estimable
widow lady, a member of the same church
with herself, who was enduring a great fight
with adversity, having an aged mother and
several small children to support.

âThey must be in need,â Mildred said half
aloud to herself, pausing in her work. âHow
nice it would be to give them a little help without
their knowing whence it came! Yes, I shall
do it.â

She rose from her kneeling posture beside her
trunk, went to her writing-desk, enclosed a ten-dollar
bill in a blank sheet of paper, and that
in an envelope which she sealed and directed to
Mrs. Mary Selby, the lady in question.

She wrote the address in a disguised hand,
and following Rupert to the outer door that
evening as he was starting down-town after tea,
asked him to drop that note into the post-office
for her as he passed.

He readily complied, and her secret was between
the Master and herself, as she desired it
to be.

The little jaunt was an entire success, and
the happy bride and groom returned from it
loaded with presents for the dear ones at home.
There was an easy-chair for father, a handsome
set of furs for mother, napery for Zillah, a silk
dress for Ada, a fine soft merino for each of the
younger girls; beside books and a variety of
smaller gifts for all, even Celestia Ann having
been kindly and generously remembered.

It was a glad home-coming, a merry, happy
time to all the family. And Mildred was
younger, prettier, gayer in appearance and
manner than they had seen her for years.

CHAPTER
III.

âFor true charity,

Though neâer so secret, finds a just reward.â

—​
May.

A part
of the winterâs amusement at Mr.
Keithâs was the making of plans for a house to
be built the next summer for Dr. and Mrs.
Landreth. The doctor had bought an acre of
ground adjoining Mildredâs lot, and intended
putting on it a large, handsome residence with
every modern convenience that was attainable
in that region of country.

As soon as the frost was out of the ground
the work of cellar-digging and laying the foundation
was begun. At that time the doctor
hoped the house might be ready for occupancy
the next fall; but as the weeks and months
glided by that hope grew fainter under the dilatory
conduct of workmen and those who supplied
material, until the most he allowed himself
to anticipate was that the walls would be
up and the roof on, so that work upon the inside
might be carried forward during the
winter.

The delay was somewhat trying to both himself
and Mildred, for they had a strong desire
to be in a home of their own, though it was a
very pleasant life they led in that of her parents.

Mildred kept up her church work; her
Sunday-school teaching, attendance upon the
weekly prayer-meetings, the sewing society,
etc., and also her visits to the sick and the
poor.

And now she had the happiness of being able
to provide these last with medical attendance
gratis, her husband joining her, heart and soul,
in her kindly ministrations.

The two were entirely congenial, and their
love deepened and strengthened with every day
they lived together.

One bright April day the doctor invited his
wife to take a drive with him a few miles into
the country, on the farther side of the river,
whither he was going to see a patient.

He always liked to have her company on such
expeditions, when good roads and fine weather
made the drive a pleasure; and she never let
anything but sickness hinder her from going.
She never wearied of his society or grudged the
sacrifice of her own plans and purposes to add
to his comfort or pleasure.

The intended call had been made, and they
turned their faces homeward. The sun was
still some two or three hours high, the air pure
and bracing; not too cool for those who were
well wrapped up; the delicate yellow green of
the newly-opened buds was on the forest trees,
while at their feet the blue violet, the purple
anemone, and other lovely wildwood flowers
peeped up here and there among the blades of
newly springing grass, or showed their pretty
heads half hidden by the carpet of last yearâs
fallen leaves lying brown and dry upon the
ground.

The doctor several times stopped his horse
and alighted to gather a handful of the delicate
blossoms for Mildred.

She thanked him with appreciative words
and smiles, yet half absently, as though her
thoughts were intent upon something else.
âCharlie,â she said at length, âI should like
to call on Mrs. Selby. It is a little out of our
way, but I think we have time; and it is
strongly impressed upon me that, for some
reason, we are needed there.â

âVery well, dearest,â he answered, stepping
into the buggy again, and taking the reins from
her hands, âthen we will drive there at once.
There can be no harm in doing so, whether your
impression be correct or not.â

The horse was urged into a brisk canter, there
were no more pauses for flower-gathering, and
presently they drew up before the Selby dwelling—​a
plain, square log-house, two rooms
below and two above.

As they did so, Mrs. Selby appeared at the
door, drawn thither by the welcome sound of
wheels.

âOh, how glad I am to see you!â she exclaimed
with tears in her eyes. âI was just asking
the Lord to send me help somehow, for
mother is very sick, and none of the children
are old enough to go to town for a doctor.
How good He is to send me just what I need!â

âDoctor and nurse both, dear Mrs. Selby,â
Mildred said, pressing her hand in heartfelt
sympathy, for they had already alighted, and
the doctor was fastening his horse preparatory
to entering the house.

He found the old lady very seriously ill, but
fortunately had the needed remedies with him.

The sun was setting when he went away,
leaving Mildred, reluctantly enough, too, but
there were medicines to be given at regular intervals
during the night, and she was quite resolved
to assist in the nursing; while he could
not stay, other patients claiming his attention;
he left her therefore, promising to return for
her at an early hour next morning.

Mildred followed him to the door.

âMy darling, I can hardly bear to go without
you,â he said, taking her hand in his and
bending his head to press a parting kiss upon
her sweet lips, his eyes full of wistful tenderness.
ââTis a lonely spot,â he added, with an
uneasy glance around upon the woods that enclosed
the little clearing on every side; âno
man about and not another house within half a
mile; none on this side of the river within two
miles.â

âNo, my dear husband,â she answered, looking
up into his face with a sweet, trustful smile,
âbut you leave me in safe keeping nevertheless.
âMan is distant, but God is near.ââ

âThat is true,â he said; âand the path of
duty is the safest; you do seem to be needed
here. So good-by for a few hours, my precious
little wife. âThe Lord bless thee and
keep thee, and cause His face to shine upon
thee.ââ

âAnd may He keep my husband also, and
bring him safely back to me,â she whispered,
putting her arms about his neck, her lips to his.

She watched him till a turn of the road hid
him from sight, then went in, and with a serene,
cheerful face entered upon her gentle ministrations
about the sick-bed, while Mrs. Selby was
busied with her children and household cares.

At length all these duties had been carefully
attended to, doors and window-shutters bolted
and barred, the children put to bed, where they
were presently soundly sleeping.

The invalid too had fallen into a heavy slumber
under the influence of an opiate, and the
two ladies sat down together for a little chat, in
the neat outer room, which served as kitchen,
sitting-room, and parlor.

The evening was chilly, but a bright wood fire
burned and crackled in the large open fireplace.
They drew their chairs near to it and to each
other and conversed in low tones, for the door
into the inner apartment where the sleepers
were stood open, and while they talked their
ears were intent to catch the slightest sound
from the sick-bed.

âIt was so kind in you to stay with me to-night,
and in the doctor to leave you,â Mrs.
Selby said, with a grateful pressure of Mildredâs
hand.

âI am sure you would have done the same
for me in like circumstances,â returned Mildred,
âand who that loves the Master could do
otherwise, remembering His words, âInasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto meâ?â

âI am sure He sent you and the doctor here
to-day in answer to prayer,â Mrs. Selby went
on, her eyes filling with grateful tears. âI
think mother would have died before morning
without better help than I could give her.â

âWe will give Him all the praise,â Mildred
said with emotion. âHe sent us, and I feel it
very sweet to be sent on His errands.â Her
eyes shone as she spoke.

âYes,â was the reply, âI have found it so
when He has sent me, as I am sure He sometimes
has, to minister to the troubled in heart,
the sick and dying. I often feel thankful,
Mrs. Landreth, that money isnât always the
only thing we can serve Him with; because
that would shut me off almost entirely.â

âNo, it is not always even the best or most
acceptable,â Mildred said, with her sweet cheery
smile.

âYet there are times when it is more welcome
than almost anything else, it being unfortunately
so very necessary in this world of ours.
Ah! Mrs. Landreth, even at the risk of seeming
to talk a great deal about myself, I must
tell you what happened to me last fall. I was
walking into town one cold day in November,
feeling so sad at heart thinking over our many
necessities and how impossible it seemed to supply
them; mother needed flannel badly and
my little boys had no shoes. I was praying
silently for help all the way and trying to stay
myself upon God and those precious verses in
the sixth chapter of Matthew about the fowls of
the air and the lilies of the field, and the sweet
words, âYour heavenly Father knoweth that ye
have need of all these things.â They did comfort
me a good deal, but my faith wasnât strong
enough to quite lift the burden off me—​the
need was so very pressing and no sign of help
at hand.â

âThey would trust me at the stores, I knew,
but to buy on credit, or borrow money when
you can see no way of paying it back, is, I
think, no better than stealing, so I couldnât do
that. Just as that thought was in my mind I
looked up and saw that I was in front of the
post-office. I hadnât thought of going there,
because I had no reason to expect anything by
mail, but I stepped in and asked if there was a
letter for me; and you canât think how surprised
I was when they handed me one, and I
tore it open and found a ten-dollar bill in it.
Nothing else, not a word of writing to say
where it came from. But I knew my heavenly
Father had sent it, and I cried for very joy and
thankfulness—​behind my veil—​as I walked
along the street.â

Mildredâs heart and eyes were full as she
listened. Ah, how sweet it was to have been
made the blessed Masterâs almoner to one of
His dear children! But her face was half
averted lest it should betray her secret, and
Mrs. Selbyâs own emotion assisted in the desired
concealment.

âI thought I should never again doubt the
love and care of my heavenly Father,â the latter
went on after a momentâs pause in which
Mildredâs hand sought hers and pressed it in
loving sympathy. âI went to Chetwood &
Mockerâs and bought the flannel and the shoes.
(Mr. Chetwood waited on me himself, and I
felt sure he put the goods down to me, probably
at cost.) And such a rejoicing as there was
when I got home! I really believe, Mrs. Landreth,
that those who have but little of this
worldâs goods enjoy them all the more; and
so things are more evenly divided among us all
than most people think.â

The clock struck nine, and Mildred begged
Mrs. Selby to lie down and try to sleep. âYou
know,â she said with an arch smile, âthe doctorâs
orders were that we should take turns in
watching and sleeping, so that each should have
half a nightâs rest.â

âYes; and you mean to obey, like a good
little wife,â returned her friend with playful
look and tone. âBut wonât you take the first
turn at sleeping?â

âNo, no; I feel quite fresh, and you are
looking sadly tired.â

Mrs. Selby yielded, stretched herself upon
a lounge, saying, âPlease be sure to call me at
twelve, or sooner if you feel like lying down,â
and fell asleep almost before Mildred had
finished covering her carefully with a heavy
blanket shawl.

Mildred sat musing by the fire for a little,
then seeing it was the hour for giving the medicine,
administered it—​the invalid just rousing
sufficiently to take it, and falling off into a
heavy sleep again immediately—​then returning
to the outer room, found a book, seated herself
near the light, and began to read.

She paused presently, and sat for a moment
noting the death-like quiet that reigned within
and without the dwelling, broken only by a
faint sound of breathing from the next room
and the ticking of the little wooden clock on
the mantel.

But the fire needed replenishing. She attended
to it with as little noise as possible, and
returned to her book.

CHAPTER
IV.

âAnd now in moodiness,

Being full of supper and distempering draughts,

Upon malicious bravery dost thou come

To start my quiet.â

—​
Shaks.
: Othello.

Suddenly
there came a sound as of a heavy
body falling or being thrown against the outer
door; then a hand fumbled at the lock, and a
manâs voice said thickly, âOpen hyar and let a
fellar in, canât ye?â

Mildred started to her feet, her heart beating
fast and loud, while at the same instant Mrs.
Selby, waked by the noise of the fall, raised
herself to a sitting posture and glanced round
at her friend with a look of alarm.

âBlast ye! let me in hyar,â repeated the
voice, its owner accompanying the words with
an oath and another effort to turn the handle of
the door.

The two women drew nearer together.

âWho is it?â asked Mildred in a tremulous
whisper.

âI donât know; but donât be frightened, heâs
evidently too drunk to break in on us, for the
door and window shutters are stout and strongly
barred.â

For several minutes the man continued to
fumble at the door, pushing against it and muttering
curses and demands for entrance, the
women standing together, clasping each otherâs
hands and listening with bated breath.

Then he staggered to the window and tried
that, but with no better success.

âIf ye donât leâme in,â he growled at
length, âIâll climb the roof and git down the
chimbly.â

âCould he?â asked Mildred, taking a tighter
grip of her companionâs hand.

âA sober man could easily get on the roof
from the back shed,â Mrs. Selby answered,
âbut I hope he will fail. He seems very drunk
for such an exploit.â

âBut canât he reach an upstairs window from
the shed roof?â

âNo, there is none on that side; itâs a story
and a half house and with upstairs windows in
the gable ends only. Theyâre without shutters,
but he canât possibly reach them.â

âAnd the chimney?â

âI donât know whether it is large enough for
him to get down it or not,â Mrs. Selby said,
with an anxious glance toward it, her ear at the
same time, as well as Mildredâs, still intent upon
the sounds without, âor what will be the
consequence if he should. Thereâs a pretty
hot fire. I hope the heat will deter him from
attempting the descent, even if he should gain
the roof and the chimney-top.â

âBut if he should succeed in getting down?â
Mildred said with a shudder and looking about
for some weapon of defence.

âWe must catch up the lamp, rush into the
other room, and barricade the door. There! he
is on the shed roof! Donât you hear?â

âYes; let us kneel down and ask our heavenly
Father to protect us.â

They did so, continuing their silent supplications
for many minutes, all the more importunately
as the sounds from overhead told them
that the drunken wretch had gained the upper
roof and was at the top of the chimney.

Another moment and the rattling fall of a
quantity of plaster gave notice that he was actually
attempting the descent.

They rose hastily, Mrs. Selby caught up the
lamp burning on the table, and they withdrew
on tiptoe, but with great celerity, to the shelter
of the inner room.

The lamp was set down in a corner where its
light would not disturb the sleepers; then the
two stood close to the door, intently listening
and looking—​the fire giving them light enough
to see the invader should he succeed in forcing
an entrance—​and Mrs. Selby with her hand
upon the lock, ready to close the door instantly
upon his appearance.

Mutterings and curses came faintly to their
ears; these were followed by half-suppressed
cries and groans and another fall of plaster; but
the sounds seemed stationary; they came no
nearer.

âHe has stuck fast, surely!â Mrs. Selby
exclaimed in an excited whisper.

âAnd we can do nothing to help him!â
Mildred said half breathlessly.

âNo, nothing.â

Their conjecture soon grew to a certainty, as
the groans and cries continued. Gradually their
fright abated; they stole softly back to the fireside,
and pitying the sufferings of the poor
wretch, hastened to open the door, throw out
the burning brands and extinguish them with
water. It was all they could do for his relief.

He asked for water, and they tried to give it
to him, but without success. He sang drunken
songs, muttered indistinctly, asking, they
thought, for help to get out—​help they could
not give; then followed groans, cries, and ineffectual
struggles to get free. These gradually
grew fainter, and at length were succeeded
by a death-like silence and stillness.

âHe is dead?â Mildred said half inquiringly
in an awe-struck whisper.

Mrs. Selby nodded assent, tears springing to
her eyes. âI am afraid so, though I had not
thought it would come to that,â she whispered.
âOh, how horrible it is! But Iâm thankful that
mother and the children have slept through it
all. Weâll not speak of it to mother if she
wakes. There, I hear her stirring, and itâs
time for the medicine again.â

âIâll hold the light for you,â Mildred said,
taking it up and following. She could not bear
to stay alone in that room at that moment.

Excitement and horror had effectually driven
away from the two ladies all inclination to
sleep, and the moments dragged by on leaden
wings, until daylight brought some small sense
of relief.

As Mrs. Selby threw open the window-shutters
her eyes were gladdened by the sight of a
neighbor nearing her door. She hastened to
admit him.

âGood-morning,â he said; âIâm out looking
for my cow; sheâs strayed away, and I
thought you might—​But whatâs wrong?â he
broke off abruptly, gazing at her with mingled
surprise and alarm.

She pointed to the chimney and dropped,
white, trembling, and speechless, into a chair.

Mildred had closed the inner door the
moment his loud, hearty tones were heard at the
other.

âWhat is it? house afire?â he asked.
âNever mind, weâll soon have it out. Whereâs
your water-bucket?â with a hasty glance about
the room.

âNo, no! a man—​drunk—​dead—​I—​I
think,â gasped Mrs. Selby.

âWhat! in the chimney? You donât say!â
And hurrying to the fireplace, he stooped and
stuck his head in. âYes, sure enough,â he
gasped, withdrawing it with a shudder, âI see
his legs dangling down. Heâs dead you think?â
turning from Mrs. Selby to Mildred.

âYes,â she said, in an awed, tremulous
tone; âhe groaned and cried out so at first,
but hasnât uttered a sound for hours.â

âHorrible! horrible! You donât know who
he is?â

Mrs. Selby shook her head and relieved her
feelings by a burst of weeping.

âAnd you think he was drunk?â

âIâm certain of it; the tones of his voice told
it.â Then calming herself she told the whole
story in a few brief sentences. âOh, what is
to be done, Mr. Miller?â she asked in conclusion.

âIâll go for the coroner, and weâll have him
got out and taken away just as soon as it can be
done according to law.â

âBut your cow?â

âNo matter about her. Iâll send my boys
to look her up.â

He hurried out and away.

At the same moment the sound of wheels
sent Mildred to the outer door.

Giving the reins to a plainly dressed elderly
woman who sat in the buggy with him, Dr.
Landreth leaped to the ground, and in an instant
his wife was in his arms, hiding her face on his
breast and sobbing hysterically.

âWhat is it, my darling?â he asked; âthe
old lady—​is she so much worse?â

Mildred seemed unable to speak, and Mrs.
Selby answered for her. âNo, doctor, I think
mother is better, but—​â and the story of the
nightâs alarm was repeated.

âDreadful! What a night you two must
have passed!â commented Dr. Landreth, holding
his wife closer to his heart.

âWho on airth can it be?â exclaimed the
woman in the buggy, who had listened to the
recital in open-mouthed astonishment, as she
spoke leaning down and forward in the effort
to look in at the open door, till she seemed in
imminent danger of falling.

âI havenât an idea,â returned Mrs. Selby.
âBut excuse me, wonât you alight and come in,
Mrs. Lightcap? I ought to have asked you before,
but hadnât noticed that you were there.â

âYes, thank ye, Iâll âlight; I want to peek
up in that chimbly; and besides Iâve come to
stay all day and as much longer as you need
help or nursinâ. Youâve nursed my folks and
me in many a sick spell, Mrs. Selby, and Iâm
glad oâ the chance to pay ye back in your own
coin,â the woman answered, jumping out and
hitching the horse as she spoke.

âItâs very kind—​â Mrs. Selby was beginning,
but the other interrupted her. âNo,
âtainât nothing oâ the sort! Iâd a ben an ungrateful
wretch if I hadnât a clapped on my bonnet
and come, the minute the doctor told me you
was wantinâ help.â

They hurried in in the wake of Dr. Landreth
and Mildred.

Stooping his tall form on the hearth, the
doctor put his head into the chimney, took a
long look, then withdrawing it, said in low,
moved tones, âYes, he is there, and life
seems to be extinct; there is not the slightest
sound or movement.â

âAnd ye canât so much as give a guess who
he is? Just let me look,â said Mrs. Lightcap,
thrusting him aside in her eagerness.

The doctor stepped toward Mrs. Selby, and
speaking in an undertone. âKeep this from
your mother if possible,â he said. âI will see
the coroner and tell him how important it is
that she should not be disturbed by noise or
excitement.â

âThen we must keep it from the children,â
she returned, with a half involuntary glance at
Mrs. Lightcap.

âYes,â said the latter, âweâll manage that.
Letâs get âem up, give âem their breakfast, and
send âem off somewhereâs, out oâ the way, afore
the crowner comes.â

âCan I see my patient now? I must get my
wife home as soon as possible,â the doctor said,
with an anxious glance at Mildredâs pale cheeks
and heavy eyes.

âSheâd ought to have a bite oâ breakfast
first,â Mrs. Lightcap remarked. âWhatâs in
that basket in the buggy, doctor? Shall I
fetch it in?â

âAh, I forgot!â he exclaimed. âIâll go for
it. Mother sent it, with a message to you,
Mrs. Selby, that she did so because she knew
you would be too busy to do much cooking just
now.â

âJust like her—​always so thoughtful and
kind,â Mrs. Selby said gratefully. âIâll have
mother ready to see you in a few moments,
doctor; but Mrs. Landreth must have a cup
of tea before she takes her ride. Iâve a fire
kindled in the stove in the shed kitchen
and—​â

âAnd Iâll get the breakfast while you tend
to your mother and the children,â interrupted
Mrs. Lightcap, bustling about like one perfectly
at home and in earnest to accomplish a great
deal in the shortest possible space of time.

Half an hour later Mildred was driving home
by her husbandâs side, drinking in deep
draughts of the fresh morning air, scented with
the breath of wildwood flowers, and rejoicing
that every step was taking her farther from the
scene of last nightâs horror and affright.

At the bridge they met the coroner and his
jury on their way to hold the inquest over the
dead man.

âGood-morning, doctor. Good-morning,
Mrs. Landreth. Do you come from Mrs.
Selbyâs?â asked the coroner, pausing and lifting
his hat to Mildred.

Dr. Landreth reined in his horse to reply.
âYes, Mr. Squires, and I hope you will manage
the affair as quietly as possible, as the old lady
is quite ill, and excitement would be very injurious
to her.â

âCertainly, weâll do our best, doctor. The
man will have to be got out of the chimney,
and weâll hold the inquest near by in the woods.
But you and your wife will be wanted as witnesses.â

âSure enough!â exclaimed Dr. Landreth.
âI had not thought of that. And really my
wife ought to go home and to bed at once.â
And he turned to her with an anxious, questioning
look.

âYes, let us go back, Charlie,â she said in an
undertone, though her heart sank at the very
thought. âI can stand it if I have you with
me.â

âAnd it may be well for me to be there in
case the old lady grows worse,â he said, turning
the buggy round as he spoke. âCan you
spare me while I drive the children over to the
nearest neighborâs, Milly?â

âOh, yes, for it will be a great relief to poor
Mrs. Selby to have them out of the way,â she
answered, thinking of every one before self, as
was her wont.

Driving so rapidly as to arrive some time before
the coroner and his men, who were on
foot, the doctor explained all to Mrs. Selby,
taking her aside out of hearing of the children,
then quickly gathered them into his buggy and
drove off by another road before the other party
came in sight.

The men had brought ladders for climbing
and implements suitable for breaking a hole in
the chimney large enough for the corpse to be
drawn through. They worked from the outside
and with as little noise as possible. Doors
were kept closed, and the old lady, still under
the influence of opiates, slept quietly till all was
over.

Mrs. Selby, Mrs. Lightcap, and Mildred were
summoned in turn to tell all they knew about
the case.

Mrs. Lightcap did not feel at all nervous or
frightened, but the other two were much agitated
and could hardly have passed through the
ordeal without the support of Dr. Landrethâs
presence and sympathy.

A crowd had gathered, and some among them
were able to identify the dead man as a confirmed,
worthless sot from a neighboring town,
one of the many thousand wretched victims of
King Alcohol.

At last all was over, a verdict rendered in
accordance with the facts, the corpse removed,
the crowd scattered, and poor, weary Mildred
carried home by her anxious husband to a
mother and sisters scarcely less solicitous on
her account.

CHAPTER
V.

âA babe in the house is a wellspring of pleasure.â

—​
Tupper.

Spring
and summer had waxed and waned
and the gorgeous October hues were again upon
tree and shrub, its soft mellow haze everywhere,
on prairie, forest, town, and river.

Annis was not ill-pleased to be sent on an
errand that gave her a long walk in the sweet,
bracing morning air.

She came hurrying home in almost breathless
excitement, rushed upstairs, and in at Mildredâs
half-open door.

âO Milly! what do you think? I—​â

But Mildred held up a warning finger.

âExcuse me, I forgot,â and Annisâs voice
sank to a whisper. âI didnât wake him
though,â she said, stealing on tiptoe to the side
of the cradle and bending down over the tiny
sleeper. âO Milly, but he is a beauty! even
prettier than Zillahâs boy. Donât you think
so?â

âDonât ask me, and donât tell Zillah what
you think about it,â returned Mildred with a
half-amused smile. âBut what did you—​Ah,
I see you have a letter for me,â holding out her
hand for it.

âYes; from Cousin Horace,â Annis answered,
putting it into Mildredâs hand; âand
see! I have one from Elsie. And, O Milly,
they want us to come there to spend the winter,
Elsie says. Do you think—​â

âUs?â

âYes; Brother Charlie, you, and me; Fan
too, if she will go; but I âmost know she wonât.â

âI doubt if you or I will either; I wouldnât
leave Charlie, he wouldnât leave his patients,
and baby is too young, I fear, for so long a
journey.â

Annisâs countenance fell. âO Milly! and
I do so want to go! You donât care much
about it, I suppose, because youâve been there
once, but I never have.â

âWell, dear, weâll discuss the question when
your brother comes in,â Mildred said, her eyes
upon the open letter in her hand. âYes, this
is from Cousin Horace, and I see contains a
very warm invitation from himself, his wife,
and Elsie to all four of us—​Charlie, my two
little sisters, and myself.â

âWell, Iâll go away till Percy wakes,â
Annis whispered, with another admiring look
at the sleeping babe, and then stole on tiptoe
from the room.

She found her mother, Ada, and Fan in the
sitting-room, all three busy with the fall sewing
for the family.

Her story was told in a breath. âSee
mother, see! a letter from Elsie,â holding it
up, while her face glowed with animation and
delight. âAnd, O Fan, she wants us to go and
spend the winter at the Oaks. And Milly had
one from Cousin Horace too, and—​â

âOne what?â interrupted Ada, smiling
amusedly into the bright, eager face.

âLetter, to be sure. O mother, do you think
we can go?â

âYou two, all alone? No, indeed, my
child.â

â
Iâll
not go!â exclaimed Fan with decision,
âI wouldnât leave mother and father and home
so long for anything in the world!â

âNo, not alone, mother; Brother Charlie
and Milly are invited. But Iâm not sure, after
all, that I do want to go and leave you,â Annis
sighed, taking a stool at her motherâs feet and
laying her head in her lap.

âAnd what could mother do without her
baby?â Mrs. Keith said, smoothing the bright
curls with softly caressing hand. âBut we will
not try to decide it all in a moment, dear. I
doubt if the others go; and if they do not, of
course that will settle the question for you.â

âThereâs Brother Charlie now!â Annis exclaimed,
lifting her head to listen; âyes, I hear
his step on the stairs. Milly will show him
the letter now, and I hope heâll say he can go.
Mildred says she wouldnât go without him.â

Mildred looked up with a smile as her husband
entered, stepping softly that he might not
disturb the slumbers of his little son and heir.

He bent over the cradle for an instant, then
drew near and sat down by her side.

âHow would you like to go South for the
winter?â he asked.

âAccept the invitation to the Oaks, do you
mean?â

âI had not heard of it,â he said in some surprise;
âbut as matters are I think it will be the
very thing to do.â

He went on to explain that business of importance
called him to the neighborhood of his
old home, and was likely to keep him there for
several months. âAnd of course,â he concluded,
âI want to take my wife and boy with
me. Will you go, love?â

âMust you go? I donât think I could stand
so long a separation,â she said, a slight mist
coming over her sight at the very thought;
âbut isnât our boy too young for such a
journey?â

âNo, I think not; he is a strong, healthy little
fellow, and the journey, if we start within a
week, need not subject him to much exposure
or fatigue. Can you get ready in that time?
I find it is quite important for me to go.â

âYes, I can if necessary.â

âThis is Wednesday,â he said reflectively;
âsuppose we consider it settled that we are to
start next Tuesday morning.â

âVery well. Fan and Annis are included in
the invitation from the Oaks. Are you willing
to take charge of them in addition to wife and
child?â she asked, with playful look and smile.

âCertainly,â he answered cheerily, âthe
more the merrier.â

The babe woke, Mildred took him up, presently
gave him to his father, and they went
down-stairs to let Annis know their decision,
and âtalk the matter over with mother and the
rest.â

As they entered the sitting-room Annis
looked up with an eager âO Brother Charlie,
will you go?â while Fan dropped her work and
holding out her arms for the babe, asked if she
might not take it.

âNot just yet, Aunt Fan,â the doctor said,
with a good-humored smile, dandling the babe
as he spoke, âpapa must have him for a little
while.â

âTill he begins to fret or cry,â remarked
Ada laughingly, âthen youâll be very ready to
resign him to the first one who offers to take
him.â

âOf course, isnât that the way fathers always
do?â the doctor answered, with imperturbable
good nature. âYes, little sister,â to Annis,
âwe are going; expect to leave here for the
sunny South in the morning stage next Tuesday.
Are you going with us?â

âGoing where? South, did you say?â asked
a merry voice from the open doorway.

All turned toward the speaker; it was Zillah
standing there, making a beautiful picture with
her babe in her arms; a sweet, fair, chubby
little fellow, pink-cheeked, dark-eyed, older by
a month or more than Mildredâs boy.

Down went Fanâs work again, and with a
bound she was at Zillahâs side, holding out her
hands to the child with a âCome to your
auntie, sweet, pretty pet!â

Zillah graciously resigned him, and accepting
the chair gallantly offered by the doctor, asked
again what their talk was about.

âSuppose I read Cousin Horaceâs letter
aloud,â said Mildred, taking it from her
pocket.

âAnd Elsieâs, too,â said Annis, laying it in
her sisterâs lap.

Mr. Keith and Rupert coming in at that moment,
followed almost immediately by Wallace
and Donald, she had the whole family for an
audience. Annis silently took possession of her
fatherâs knee, and as Mildred finished, with her
arm about his neck whispered in his ear a coaxing
entreaty to be allowed to accept Elsieâs invitation.

âWait a little, pet, till I hear what Brother
Charlie has to say. But how are father and
mother to do without you for so long a time?â
he said, holding her close, with repeated caresses.

âMaybe youâll enjoy me all the more when
I come back,â was the arch rejoinder.

âAh, child! as if you were not already the
very light of our eyes! But there, we must
stop talking and hear what the doctor is saying.â

The matter was under discussion for some
time. Fan remained steadfast to her resolution
to stay at home, Annis urgent to be permitted
to go. Before night she had won the consent
of both parents, letters of acceptance had been
despatched to the Dinsmores, and active preparations
for the journey set on foot.

The childâs heart misgave her now and then
at thought of the long separation from home,
parents, and so many of her dear ones; but the
time was so short for all that had to be done to
put her wardrobe in such order as mother and
sisters deemed desirable, that she was kept in a
whirl of excitement that up to the last hour left
her little leisure for dwelling upon anything but
the business in hand, and the pleasure in store
for her at the journeyâs end.

The parting was a hard one when it came;
she went away drowned in tears and sobbing
pitifully, but presently forgot her grief in the
interest of new scenes and soothed by the kindly
ministrations of her brother and sister.

CHAPTER
VI.

âSlow pass our days in childhood—

Every day seems like a century.â

—​
Bryant.

At
the Oaks Elsie waited for Annisâs answer
to her letter with an eager impatience which
she found it difficult to restrain. Her papa was
closely questioned in regard to the exact length
of time it must necessarily take for the one
missive to travel to Indiana and the other to
wend its way to the Oaks; then she counted
the days, settled upon the earliest possible as
the one on which to expect it, and from that on
watched the mails, and was sorely disappointed
each time one arrived without bringing what
she so greatly desired; for the letters from
Pleasant Plains were delayed, as will occasionally
happen.

On the third morning, when her father,
glancing over the letters he had just taken from
the mail-bag, remarked, âNone yet from Mildred,â
âO dear!â she sighed, âwonât you
write again to-day, papa? Donât you think
our letters must have been lost on the way?â

âWe will wait a little longer, daughter,â he
said, with a sympathizing look and smile.
âLetters will travel slowly sometimes. You
must try to be patient, and perhaps this afternoonâs
mail will bring the news we are so desirous
for.â

âI wish you would let me write to Annis
again this morning, papa, instead of learning
lessons,â she pleaded.

âNo, my child; I wish you to attend to
your studies as usual,â he replied with gentle
decision.

She said no more, for she was never allowed
to question his decisions or to urge the request
he had once denied.

At the regular hour she repaired to her pretty
boudoir, took out her books, and set to work at
her tasks; but not with her usual spirit and
energy. Her thoughts kept wandering to
Annis and Mildred, and she found herself repeating
words and sentences without in the least
taking in their meaning.

She delighted in most of her studies, but
Latin, which she had begun only of late, she
thoroughly detested. Still her father required
her to study it, and she was too docile and
obedient to think of refusing; which indeed
would have been quite useless, as he was one
who would be obeyed.

But having spent a half hour or more over
the morningâs allotted portion, and finding she
knew no more about it now than on opening
the book, she grew discouraged and sought him
in his private room, where he was busy at his
writing-desk.

âWell, daughter?â he said inquiringly as he
perceived her standing, book in hand, close at
his side.

âO papa, this is such a dreadfully long, hard
lesson! I canât learn it!â

âCanât! ah, thatâs a lazy word!â he said
pleasantly, laying down his pen to put his hand
caressingly on her drooping head. âSurely my
brave little girl is not going to allow herself to
be conquered by difficulties!â

âPapa, you donât know how difficult it is
for a little child like me,â she sighed. âWhy
must I learn Latin?â

âBecause your father bids you,â he answered
in a grave, slightly reproving tone. âIs not
that a sufficient reason for a good, obedient
child?â

âYes, sir, but—​â

âWell?â

âI was just going to say the lazy word again,
papa,â she said, furtively brushing away a tear.

He pushed back his chair and drew her to his
knee. âWhat is wrong with you to-day?â he
asked, smoothing the hair back from her temples
with gentle, caressing hand.

âI donât know, papa; it seems as if I canât
study somehow.â

âDo you know your other lessons?â

âYes, sir; I learned them yesterday.â

âGo and get your books, and I will hear
them now and here.â

She obeyed, and recited almost perfectly.

He gave the deserved meed of praise, then
taking up the Latin grammar, âThis lesson
must be learned,â he said, âbut I shall not
require that to-day. I am in an indulgent
mood,â he went on with a fond, fatherly smile,
âand you shall have a holiday. Your mamma
and I are going to drive into the city, and will
take you along, if you wish to go.â

âO papa, how nice!â she cried, clapping her
hands. Then throwing her arms round his neck
to hug and kiss him, âHow good in you!
Thank you ever so much. I shall try hard to
learn that lesson to-morrow.â

âAnd will succeed, I havenât a doubt,â he
said, returning her caresses. âNow run away
to Aunt Chloe, and tell her I want you handsomely
dressed—​in the dark blue velvet suit—​and
at once, for the carriage will be at the door
directly.â

âYes, sir!â And away she flew, her face
sparkling with delight.

âWhy, darlinâ, you looks mighty pleased,â
remarked Aunt Chloe, as the little girl appeared
before her fairly dancing in the exuberance
of her joy.

âOh yes, mammy, so I am, for Iâm going
to drive to the city with papa and mamma instead
of sitting here studying that hard lesson.
And you must please make all the haste you can
to dress me in my blue velvet suit.â

âMassa say so? Den dat I will, darlinâ, hab
you ready foâ Miss Rose gits her bonnet on.â

Always ready to exert herself for the pleasure
of her idolized nursling, Aunt Chloe had
laid aside her knitting and taken the dress from
the wardrobe before her sentence was fairly
concluded.

Her dexterous fingers made quick work with
the little girlâs toilet. âKi, chile! but you is
lubly and sweet as de rose!â was her delighted
exclamation as she took a careful survey of her
completed work.

âO mammy, you mustnât flatter me!â
laughed Elsie, dancing from the room. âGood-by
till I come back.â

Hastening to the grand entrance hall of the
mansion, she found the carriage at the door;
but her papa and mamma had not yet made
their appearance. Her baby brother was there,
however, crowing in his nurseâs arms.

âOh, you pretty darling, come to sister!â
cried the little girl, holding out her arms to receive
him.

But her fatherâs step and voice sounded in her
rear. âNo, no, Elsie! he is quite too heavy
for you to hold; especially with his out-door
garments on.â

âWhy, papa, you never said so before,â she
returned in a disappointed tone, looking up
entreatingly into his face as he drew near,
âthough youâve often seen me holding him.â

âBut he is growing heavier every day,
daughter, and for your own sake I must forbid
you to carry him. You may have him on your
lap occasionally for a little while at a time,
when you are seated; but never hold him when
standing.â

Elsie sighed, then brightening, âI was ready
in season, papa,â she said.

âYes, dearest, and I am altogether satisfied
with your appearance.â

âAs you well may be, my dear,â added
Rose gayly, joining them at that moment.

Mr. Dinsmore handed her into the carriage,
then Elsie, followed them himself, and taking
the babe from his âmammy,â bade her get in
also.

âI shall hold Master Horace for a while,â
he said, âbut if he begins to fret or cry shall
hand him over to you.â

The day was a glorious one in late October;
the carriage was roomy, softly cushioned, and
easy rolling; Dick was a skilful driver; the
roads were in fine condition, and the little party
were in high health and spirits. Elsie quite
forgot her disappointment of the morning and
was full of innocent mirth and gladness.

Arrived in the city they spent some hours in
shopping, visiting in turn dry-goods, jewelry,
book, and toy stores, and Elsie became the delighted
possessor of several new books, and a
lovely doll to add to her already large family;
all gifts from the fond, indulgent father, who
seemed ready to give her everything that money
could buy for which she showed the slightest
desire.

Nor was he less indulgent to his wife; but
fortunately neither wife nor daughter was disposed
to tax his generosity to any great extent.

They drove to the post-office last, and to
Elsieâs great delight found there a letter addressed
to her papa from Mrs. Landreth, enclosing
a few lines from Annis to herself,
both accepting the invitation to the Oaks and
mentioning the day set for the beginning of
their journey. Mildred also told what route
they would take and about how soon they expected
to reach their destination if all went well
by the way.

âThese letters have been delayed,â Mr.
Dinsmore said, when he had read his aloud to
Rose and Elsie, âand if our friends are not detained
we should have them with us day after
to-morrow.â

âOh, oh, how nice!â cried Elsie. âPapa,
must I say lessons the first day theyâre with
us?â

âThere will not be another holiday for you
until that troublesome Latin lesson has been
properly disposed of,â he answered gravely.

âIf it isnât ready for you to-morrow, papa,
it shaânât be for want of trying,â Elsie said resolutely,
though it cost an effort to refrain from
again complaining that it was too long and hard
for her to master.

But she felt rewarded by the affectionate, approving
smile her father bestowed upon her.
And she said to herself, âWhat a very naughty,
ungrateful girl I should be not to try my very
best when papa has been so good and kind to
me to-day! Yes, and is every day. I donât
believe any other little girl ever had such a dear
good father.â

And with the thought she lifted her face to
his with such a sweet, loving look, as she sat opposite
him in the carriage, that he could not
refrain from taking her in his arms and bestowing
upon her another and another tender caress.

Rose watched them with a beaming countenance.
It was a perpetual feast to her to behold
their mutual affection.

As they drew near home they were overtaken
by a gentleman on horseback. Mr. Dinsmore
saluted him with great cordiality.

âAh, Travilla, how are you to-day? All
well at Ion?â

âQuite well, thank you, Dinsmore,â returned
the cavalier, lifting his hat with a low
bow first to Mrs. Dinsmore and then to Elsie.
âJust from the city?â

âYes; and glad we are reaching home in
time to receive your call.â

âThank you. I was so fortunate as to meet
with entire success in the business you entrusted
to me, Dinsmore; of which fact I think
we shall presently have ocular demonstration.â

âAnd in that case there will be other demonstrations,â
responded Mr. Dinsmore, looking
at his little girl with an odd sort of smile.

âI dare say,â Mr. Travilla said, smiling admiringly
on her also.

They had turned in at the great gates and
now swept rapidly and smoothly along the
broad gravelled drive that, winding about
through the well-kept grounds, finally brought
them to the principal entrance to the mansion.

The carriage stopped, the door was thrown
open by a servant who stood there in waiting.
Mr. Dinsmore sprang out and assisted his wife
to alight, then Elsie.

As the little girlâs foot touched the ground
she caught sight of a beautiful little phaeton,
to which were harnessed a pair of Shetland
ponies, very pretty and exactly alike.

âOh!â she exclaimed, âwe must have
company! I wonder who it is with such a
lovely turnout!â

âNo, Miss Elsie, dar ainât no compâny in
de house,â put in the servant, her papaâs man
John; âand I kinâ oâ reckon dat grand turnout
bâlongs hyah. Ainât dat so, Massa
Horace? Yah, yah!â

Elsie gave her father an eager, inquiring,
half-incredulous look.

âYes, daughter, it is yours,â he said,
smiling fondly upon her.

âO papa! how good you are to me,â she
cried, glad, grateful tears shining in her eyes.
âIs it really my very own? and may I get in
and take a drive?â

âYes,â he said, leading her to the phaeton
and handing her in, then seating himself by
her side, and taking the reins, which John put
into his hand.

âThe phaeton is just large enough for
two,â he remarked, âand the ponies, though
small, are quite strong enough to draw us
both. You shall have the reins in your own
hands presently, and I will give you a lesson
in driving, though you already have a pretty
correct idea of it.â

âWhy yes, papa, you know you have let me
drive a little several times. And these pretty
ponies are so small I think I can easily manage
them. Will you let me drive by myself
sometimes?â

âYou would prefer my room to my company,
eh?â he remarked laughingly.

âOh, I didnât mean that, papa!â she cried,
blushing vividly.

âI intend to let you drive about the
grounds with Annis, or some other friend,
when you have become familiar with your new
steeds,â he answered, bending down to touch
his lips to the glowing cheek, âand I hope,
my darling, you will find great enjoyment in
so doing.â

A few weeks previous to this Elsie had seen
and admired a similar though less handsome
equipage, and though she did not ask for such
an one for herself, her ever-indulgent father
had at once determined in his own mind that
she should have it.

He wanted it to be a pleasant surprise, so
said not a word to her about it, but talked the
matter over with Rose and his friend, Mr.
Travilla. The latter undertook to make the
purchase for him, and had managed the business
to the entire satisfaction of all concerned.

âPapa, you are just
too
good to me!â
Elsie exclaimed.

âAm I?â he asked, putting the reins into
her hands. âNow let me see how well you
can drive?â

She succeeded very nicely in guiding and
controlling her small steeds; so well indeed
that her father said she might try it alone in a
day or two.

They made the circuit of the grounds, then
drew up in fine style before the veranda, where
Rose and Mr. Travilla sat watching them.

âWell and bravely done, my little friend!â
exclaimed the latter, springing down the steps
to hand her from the phaeton, as John took the
reins, she resigning them a trifle reluctantly.

âOh, itâs so nice!â she cried. âPlease,
papa, maynât I drive round once more?â

âNo, daughter, this is enough for to-day.
Let Mr. Travilla lift you out. You must remember
you have already had a long drive, beside
the fatigue of shopping.â

Mr. Dinsmore spoke kindly but with decision,
and the little girl submitted without so
much as a pout or frown. A moment or two
spent in petting and caressing the new ponies,
her father and Mr. Travilla looking on and
listening with pleasure and amusement, and she
ran gayly into the house, eager to show her
friend the books and toys just brought from
the city.

He was a frequent visitor at the Oaks, made
much of Elsie, and always showed as keen an
interest in her childish pleasures as Mr. Dinsmore
himself.

âIsnât she a beauty, Mr. Travilla?â Elsie
asked, exhibiting the doll.

âThat she is. She will be your favorite
child, I presume.â

âNo, sir; she will be valued very highly as
papaâs gift, but she can never be so dear as
Rose.â

âRose? which is she?â

âMy very largest dollie, the first that papa
ever gave me. Sheâs been with me through
so many happy times, and sad times, that I love
her better than I can ever love another.â

âAh!â he said with sudden gravity, for her
words carried him back to a time that had been
very sad indeed to her and all who loved
her.

âMr. Travilla, may I name this one Violet,
for your mother?â she asked.

âCertainly, my dear; my mother will feel
complimented no doubt,â he said with a twinkle
of fun in his eye. âYou must have quite a
family, I suppose. Would you like to show
them all to me?â

âAh yes, indeed, sir! if you care to see
them. There are more than a dozen, big and
little, altogether.â

âIt is about time you were having your hat
and coat taken off, daughter,â her father said,
coming up to them at that moment.

âYes, papa, Iâm going now, and Mr. Travillaâs
going with me to see my baby-house and
all my family.â

âAh, wonât you invite me too?â

âWhy, papa!â she exclaimed, âyou donât
need an invitation, you have more right in my
rooms than even I have.â

âBy virtue of being the grandfather of
the family, I suppose,â he said laughingly.
âWell, then, I will lead the way.â

The baby-house was really very handsome,
and the dolls, all tastefully dressed, presented a
pretty sight.

âIâm afraid Iâm growing rather old to play
with dolls,â remarked Elsie, with gravity,
when she had given their names and relationship,
âbut I like to make pretty clothes for
them, and that teaches me to cut and fit and
sew. And when Iâm reading here by myself I
like to have Rose on my lap; she seems like a
live thing and company for me.â

âYou find that pleasanter than studying
Latin?â her father said in a playful tone, laying
a hand lightly on her head and bending
down to look fondly into the sweet child face.

âPapa, I do mean to have that lesson perfect
to-morrow,â she said in a half whisper,
her eyes cast down and her cheek flushing.

CHAPTER
VII.

âOh, enviable, early days!â

—​
Burns.

Mr. Travilla
left the Oaks directly after
tea. Mrs. Dinsmore went to the nursery, and
Elsie and her papa were the only remaining occupants
of the parlor. He was pacing to and
fro in meditative mood, she seated by the centre-table,
turning over her new books.

Presently pushing them aside, âPapa,â she
asked, âshall I get my Latin grammar and
learn that lesson now?â

âNo; you are tired and will find it easier
in the morning. Besides I want you now.
Come here,â he said, taking possession of an
easy-chair beside the bright wood fire that
crackled on the hearth.

She obeyed with joyous alacrity.

âYou are pleased with the phaeton and
ponies?â he said inquiringly, as he drew her to
his knee.

âYes, indeed, papa! What does make you
so very, very good to me?â

âLove,â he answered, holding her close.
âMy darling, there is nothing I enjoy more
than giving you pleasure and adding to your
happiness. Tell me if you have a single wish
ungratified.â

âOnly one that I can think of just now,
papa,â she replied, looking up at him with an
arch smile, then dropping her eyes and blushing
as if more than half ashamed of the admission.

âAnd what is that?â he asked.

âI donât like to tell you, papa,â she murmured,
hanging her head still lower, while the
blush deepened on her cheek.

âAh, but you have roused my curiosity, and
now I insist upon knowing,â he said, with a
mixture of authority and playfulness.

His left arm encircled her waist, he put his
right hand under her chin and lifted her face so
that it was fully exposed to his view.

âNow look up at me and tell me what
you wish. Why should you desire to hide a
thought from the father who loves you as his
own soul?â

âOnly because—​because Iâm ashamed, papa.
Itâs just that I—​I wish you wouldnât make me
learn Latin.â

With the last word she turned and hid her
blushing face on his breast.

He did not speak for a minute or more.

âPlease donât be vexed with me, papa,â
Elsie said, with tears in her voice.

âNo, daughter,â he answered gravely, âbut
I see that if I would consult my childâs best interests
I must content myself to leave some of
her wishes ungratified. You are not old enough
or wise enough to choose for yourself in such
matters. And I am sorry that you are not
quite willing to submit to my guidance and
authority.â

âDonât be sorry, papa! I will be good
about it after this, indeed I will!â she said,
with earnest entreaty, looking up into his face
with eyes full of tears. âIâm glad I have a
papa who loves me well enough to always do
what he knows is best for me, even when I am
so naughty as to—​to not want to do as he
says.â

Rose came in at that moment, and Mr. Dinsmoreâs
only answer to his little girl was a silent
caress.

She came to him the next morning, before
breakfast, her face beaming with satisfaction,
her Latin grammar in her hand.

âGood-morning, papa,â she said, âI know
every word of my lesson now. I rose half an
hour earlier than usual and studied hard all that
time and while mammy was dressing me and
curling my hair.â

âThat is like my own dear little girl,â he
responded with a pleased look and taking her
on his knee to kiss and fondle her. He kept
her there while he heard the lesson.

âVery well done, indeed!â he said, when
she had finished. âNow you see what you are
capable of when you resolutely set your mind
to your task. Your phaeton is at the door;
would you like to take a drive about the
grounds before breakfast?â

âYes, indeed, dear papa! I shall enjoy it
ever so much now that that hard, disagreeable
lesson is out of the way.â

âWe shall have a full half hour for it,â he
remarked, consulting his watch. âRun to
Aunt Chloe and have yourself well wrapped
up; for the air is keen and frosty.â

He did not need to bid twice, nor did she
keep him waiting, but was at his side again in
hood and cloak by the time he had donned his
overcoat and gloves.

He rode with her, but let her do all the driving.
He brought her back in good time for
breakfast, and she came to the table gay as a
lark, eyes shining, and a lovely color in her
cheeks.

âO mamma,â she said, âwe have had such
a nice drive in the new phaeton—​papa and I—​and
he says I may drive Annis about the
grounds when—​â

âIf Annis is willing to trust herself to your
driving,â put in her father laughingly.

Elsieâs countenance fell slightly. âI hope
she will be; the ponies seem very gentle and
tractable,â she went on. âYou know you said
so yourself, papa.â

âYes; I donât think there will be any danger,
or I should be very sure not to risk my
child in the venture,â he returned, smiling with
fatherly affection into the fair young face.

âNo doubt about that,â said Rose. âBut,
Elsie, are Annis and your papa to be the only
persons to enjoy the privilege of driving out
with you in the new phaeton?â

âO mamma, would you be willing to try
it?â Elsie asked with eager delight. âIâll
drive you out to-day when my lessons are done,
if papa gives permission and you will go. May
I, papa?â

âYou may do anything your mamma wishes
you to do.â

âUnless,â said Rose, âI should unwittingly
ask her to do something her father has forbidden.â

âOh, of course! that might happen. In any
conflict of authority undoubtedly mine must
stand against all other, since even you have
promised to submit to it, lady mine,â Mr.
Dinsmore returned in jesting tone, and with a
fond, lover-like look into the sweet face of his
wife.

Elsie glanced wonderingly from one to the
other.

âDid you really, mamma?â

âYes; didnât you hear me?â said Rose,
laughing and blushing.

âBut donât you do exactly as you please?â

âI have so far.â

âThatâs because sheâs wise and good enough
always to please to do right,â remarked Mr.
Dinsmore.

âOh, yes, sir!â

For the next five minutes Elsie ate in silence,
apparently lost in thought.

Her father watched her with an amused face.
âWell, daughter,â he said at length, âa penny
for your thoughts.â

âI was only thinking, papa, that I hope Iâll
never have to get married,â she said, with a
slight sigh.

âOf course you will never be compelled to,â
he replied, with difficulty restraining a laugh,
âbut what is your objection?â

âI mean if I should have to promise to
obey; because I couldnât obey two people, if
they didnât always agree, and I shall always
have to obey you.â

âWell, my child, you need not so much as
have a thought about that question for ten years
to come,â he answered with gravity. âIt is
a subject a little girl like you should never think
of at all.â

âThen Iâll try not to any more, papa. But,
mamma, you havenât said whether you will
drive out with me to-day or not?â

âThank you, dear, for your kind offer,â
Rose answered, âbut I think I must wait until
another day, as there are some things I wish to
attend to in preparation for the coming of the
cousins to-morrow.â

âCan you not allow yourself a little playtime?â
her husband asked. âYour company
will not arrive until near tea-time to-morrow
evening.â

âWell, perhaps. You will send the carriage
to meet them, of course?â

âYes, and ride over myself on horseback.â

âO papa, couldnât I drive over for Annis?â
asked Elsie.

âNo; it would be too long a drive for you.
But if you wish you may ride with me; ride
Glossy or Gyp, either one would be the better
for the exercise.â

âThank you, dear papa; I believe I shall like
that quite as well,â the little girl responded
with a very pleased look and smile; for there
was scarcely anything she enjoyed more than
riding by her fatherâs side.

She was quite fearless and at home on horseback,
having been accustomed to it ever since
she was five years old.

Rose was very busy that day and the next in
preparations for the comfort and enjoyment of
her expected guests.

Elsie took a deep interest in all that was done,
and gave such assistance as she was capable of
and permitted to attempt. She was with her
mamma in the suite of rooms intended for the
use of Dr. and Mrs. Landreth, watching and
helping her as she put the last finishing touches
to their adornment, placing vases of flowers on
mantels, toilet and centre tables, looping anew
the rich curtains of silk and lace, rearranging
their soft folds, then stepping back to note the
effect, pushing an easy-chair a little farther to
this side or that, picking up a shred from the
carpet, or wiping invisible dust from some article
of furniture.

âYour Cousin Mildred is extremely neat,
Elsie, is she not?â Rose asked, taking a final
survey of the beautiful boudoir.

âI believe she is, mamma, but not more so
than you are,â the little girl answered, looking
up affectionately into the slightly anxious face
of her young step-mother.

âYou think she will be pleased with these
rooms?â

âO mamma, how could she help it? They
are just lovely! sweet with the breath of flowers;
and everything corresponds so nicely. You know
papa chose all the furniture, carpets, curtains, and
ornaments; and he has such excellent taste.â

âSo you and I think, at all events,â Rose responded
with a smile.

âAnd Cousin Mildred is lovely enough to
match with everything here,â Elsie remarked,
sending a satisfied glance from side to side.

âAre you not glad she is coming to make us
a good long visit, mamma?â

âYes, dear, I am indeed, for though I have
never met her, I feel quite sure, from all your
father, Mrs. Travilla, and you have told me, that
I shall love her dearly.â

âI think she will be like a sister to you, and
Annis like one to me, and that we shall have oh
such a nice time while they stay!â

âYes, I hope so; but havenât we nice times
always with each other, your dear father, and
Baby Horace?â

âYes, yes, indeed, mamma! I often think
I must be the happiest girl in the world,â Elsie
said, putting her arm about Roseâs waist and
holding up her face for a kiss.

Rose gave it with earnest affection. âDear
child,â she said, âI hope, if the will of God be
so, life may always be as bright to you as it is
now. Darling, I think even your fond father
can hardly love you much better than I do.
Ah,â she added, taking out her watch, âit is
time you were getting ready for the ride with
him to the dÃ©pÃ´t.â

At that Elsie hastened from the room. As
she descended the broad staircase her father appeared
at its foot, looked up smilingly at her,
and held out his arms.

With a merry, ringing laugh she sprang into
them and put hers about his neck.

âMy darling!â he said, holding her close.
âI was just coming for you. I have ordered
the horses and they will be at the door by the
time you can don your riding-habit.â

CHAPTER
VIII.

âYouth treads on flowers whereâer he goes,

And finds on every thorn a rose.â

â
We
are almost there! Time to don hats,
gloves, and cloaks, and gather together bags,
boxes, and bundles,â exclaimed Dr. Landreth
in his cheery tones, reaching Annis her hat from
the rack overhead as he spoke. âMilly, my
dear,â bending over her in tender solicitude,
âhow is the headache now? Iâm thankful I
shall soon have you out of this close, overheated
atmosphere. No, donât disturb yourself, Annis
and I will take care of the bundles. Now give
me the boy.â

âHere,â beckoning to the porter as the train
came to a standstill, âcarry out these packages,
will you? Now, Milly and Annis, keep close
to me, but donât be uneasy; this is the end of
the road, and we have plenty of time.â

Annis had hurried on her wrap, and now,
catching up her satchel, turned to her sister,
who was fastening her cloak, with âO Milly,
make haste, and Iâll keep close behind you.â

âNo, go on, child,â Mildred answered,
gently pushing the little girl on before her.

Another minute and they were assisted from
the car by their Uncle Dinsmore on one side and
Cousin Horace on the other. There was Elsie
too, waiting to give a welcoming embrace to
each; and beside her Mr. Travilla, who had
ridden over to meet his old friend, Charlie
Landreth, and be introduced to his wife; for
the mistress of Ion had so often sounded Mildredâs
praises in her sonâs ears that he was
very desirous to meet the object of her encomiums.

Tired and travel-stained as she was, Mildred
did not show to the best advantage, yet the
beauty of form and feature, the intellectual and
sweet countenance, seemed to him to fully justify
his motherâs praises.

With joyous exclamations, âO Elsie, dear!â
âO Annis, how glad I am youâve come at
last!â the little girls clasped each other in a
warm embrace.

Greetings, introductions, and friendly inquiries
exchanged all around, the travellers were
speedily bestowed in Mr. Horace Dinsmoreâs
comfortable family carriage and driven away in
the direction of the Oaks, their luggage following
in a wagon.

Elsie was lifted to her saddle by her fatherâs
strong arms, he vaulted to the back of his own
larger steed, and the older Mr. Dinsmore and
Mr. Travilla having mounted theirs, all four
started at a gallop in pursuit of the carriage,
which they presently distanced, exchanging
smiling salutations with its occupants as they
passed.

Elsie rode by her fatherâs side, the other two
gentlemen a little in advance.

âYou will go on to the Oaks with us, father?
and you, Travilla?â Mr. Horace Dinsmore said
with hospitable cordiality.

âNot to-night, Horace,â the old gentleman
answered, âIâll be over to-morrow, if nothing
happens to prevent. I want a talk with Mildred,
but sheâs tired to-night and ought to retire
early.â

Mr. Travilla, too, declined the invitation, on
the plea of an engagement to meet a gentleman
on business.

So presently, when they reached the spot
where their roads parted, Elsie and her papa
were left to pursue their way alone.

âNow for a race to the Oaks, Elsie,â Mr.
Dinsmore said gayly; âlet us see if we can get
there in time to receive our friends on their
arrival.â

So the horses were urged till they almost flew
over the ground. Elsie had never ridden so
fast before, and enjoyed it keenly.

They arrived so much in advance of the carriage
that she had time to run to her dressing-room
and have her riding habit exchanged for
a white cashmere and pink ribbons, then join
her papa and mamma in the principal entrance
hall as the carriage drew up before the door.

The warmest of welcomes awaited the weary
travellers. âNever were guests more welcome!â
was Mr. Dinsmoreâs salutation.

Rose embraced Mildred with sisterly affection,
saying, âI am so very glad you have
come. I am sure we shall love each other.â

âI do not doubt it,â Mildred answered; âI
was prepared to love you for your husbandâs
sake, and now I see that I shall for your own.â

âAnd, mamma, this is Annis,â Elsie said,
releasing the latter from a vigorous hug, and
drawing her toward Rose. âAnnis, this is
my pretty new mamma that I told you I was
going to have, when I was at your house.â

âShe
is
pretty, and looks very kind, too,â
Annis exclaimed, in a burst of honest admiration.

âThank you, dear,â returned Rose, in evident
amusement, bestowing an affectionate kiss
upon the child.

Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore themselves conducted
their older guests to the apartments prepared
for them, Annis and Elsie following.

âOh, how charming!â was Mildredâs delighted
exclamation when shown into the beautiful
boudoir, whence open doors gave glimpses
of dressing and bedrooms equally inviting in appearance;
and she turned with beaming countenance
to her hospitable entertainers, adding,
âWhat a haven of rest after our long, weary
journey!â

âI hope it may prove so, indeed,â Rose
said, looking greatly pleased.

âWe want you to make yourself perfectly
at home in our house, Milly,â added Mr. Dinsmore.
âYou, too, Charlie; call for anything
you want; a servant will always be ready to
answer your ring. And do not feel that you
are trammelled by any of the rules of our establishment;
rise in the morning and retire at
night, come and go, as you like. We will be
glad of your company when you are disposed
to favor us with it, but when you prefer the
solitude of these rooms, do not hesitate to indulge
that preference,â he concluded laughingly,
as he withdrew, presently followed by
his wife.

In the mean while Elsie, after allowing Annis
a hasty survey of Mildredâs apartments, had
taken her into an adjoining bedroom, saying,
âNow, Annis, dear, you are to choose between
this room and another next to my sleeping-room.
Mamma said so because she was not
sure whether you would care most to be near
Cousin Milly or near me.â

For several minutes Annis gazed about her
in silence, seemingly struck dumb with surprise
and admiration at the richness and beauty
of her surroundings.

A velvet carpet covered the floor, lace curtains
draped the windows, the bed-spread and
pillow-shams were of pink silk covered with a
film of lace, chairs and couches were cushioned
with satin damask, while sweet-scented hothouse
flowers and a variety of other pretty
things were scattered here and there with lavish
hand.

âOh,â she cried, at last, drawing a long
breath, âwhat a lovely room! fit for a queen,
I am sure! Did Cousin Rose really intend it
for me?â

âYes; if you prefer it to the other, Annis.
But wonât you see that before you decide?
I should so like to have you close beside me,â
Elsie said, half imploringly, putting an arm
about Annisâs waist and drawing her toward
a door opposite that by which they had entered
the room.

âAnd Iâd like it too,â Annis returned with
hearty acquiescence. âAnd, in fact,â she
went on, âIâd rather not be where everything
is so handsome and costly; because I might
spoil something.â

âThat wouldnât make any difference, âtis
easy to replace things, and one grows tired of
always seeing the same,â Elsie said. âBut I
think the other room is quite as pretty in every
way as that.â

She had led Annis into a back hall, and they
were now descending a flight of stairs that led
to another on the ground floor; reaching that
they presently came to a door which, on opening,
admitted them to a bedroom that was, as
Elsie remarked, quite equal to the one they
had just left.

âThis is it, Annis,â she said. âThat door
yonder opens into my sleeping-room, and you
can get to Cousin Mildred from here very
quickly and easily by the way we came.â

âOh, Iâll take this!â said Annis. ââTwill
be ever so nice for us to be close together!â

âOh, wonât it! Iâm so glad. Come and
see my rooms if youâre not too tired.â And
Elsie led the way, Annis following, through
bedroom, dressing-room, and boudoir.

They were large and airy, and so luxuriously
and beautifully furnished and adorned that
Annis almost thought herself in fairy-land.

She said so to her little cousin, adding,
âWhat a happy girl you must be! you seem
to have nothing left to wish for.â

ââA manâs life consisteth not in the abundance
of the things which he possesseth,ââ Elsie
murmured half aloud, half to herself; then
turning to Annis a very bright, winsome face,
âYou know Jesus said that when here on
earth, and though I am very happy I sometimes
think I could be just as happy in a hut with
His love and my dear papaâs.â

âYes,â assented Annis, âI wouldnât be
without father and mother for all the money
and fine things in the world. But oh, isnât it
time for me to be getting washed and dressed?â

âYes; Iâll have your trunk carried to your
room,â Elsie said, ringing for a servant.
âAnd mammy will help you dress, if you
wish. Oh, here she is!â as the old nurse appeared
before them. âMammy, this is Cousin
Annis Keith. You remember her, donât you?â

âYes, âdeed I do, darlinâ,â she returned;
âIâse glad to see you at de Oaks, Miss Annis,
and hopes you and my chile hab best ob good
times togedder,â she added, dropping a courtesy
to the young guest.

âThank you, Aunt Chloe,â Annis said,
shaking hands with her.

âYes, Mammy, weâre going to be close together,â
said Elsie. âSo please have Annisâs
trunk brought immediately to that room,â indicating
with a motion of her hand the adjoining
apartment, for they were now in her own
sleeping-room.

âBress yoâ heart, honey. Iâll see âbout dat
âdreckly,â and Aunt Chloe hurried away in
search of the luggage and a man servant to
carry it in.

âIs Cousin Horace near you at night?â
asked Annis.

âYes, indeed!â Elsie replied, with joyous
look and tone; âthat door beside my bed leads
into the room where he and mamma sleep;
their bed is very near it too, and papa always
sets the door wide open before he gets into bed,
so that if I want him in the night I have only
to call out âpapa,â and he is beside me in an
instant. Oh, itâs so nice, Annis! I feel so
glad and safe with my dear earthly father so
close to me, and our heavenly Father always
with us, taking care of us all. You know the
Bible says, âBehold he that keepeth Israel shall
neither slumber nor sleep.â Arenât they sweet
words?â

Mr. Dinsmore sat alone in the library reading
by the light of the astral lamp on the centre-table.
A door on the farther side of the
room opened softly, a little white-robed figure
lingered for a moment on the threshold, then
with noiseless steps stole swiftly to the back of
his chair, two round white arms crept about his
neck, a soft cheek was laid against his, and a
low sweet voice murmured in his ear, âMy
papa! my own, own dear papa!â

The book was hastily closed and thrust aside,
he turned half round in his chair, caught the
little graceful figure and drew it to his knee to
caress and fondle it with many an endearing
word.

âWhere is Annis?â he asked at length.

âTaking a bath while Mammy unpacks her
trunk. Then Mammy will brush her hair for
her and help her dress.â

âAh! I hope she will find herself quite refreshed
and with a good appetite for her supper.
Are you not fatigued after your long
ride?â

âA little, papa.â

âThen sit here and rest for the present;
and you and Annis would do well to retire early
to your beds to-night. I should advise her to
defer even an introduction to the dolls and
their house until to-morrow.â

âI can hardly help wishing to-morrow was
here,â exclaimed the little girl. âIâm in such
a hurry to show her Gyp and Glossy and the
two new ponies and the phaeton.â

âAnd ever so many other things? Well,
my child, go to bed early, and to-morrow will
soon be here. I shall give you a holiday for
the rest of the week, that you and Annis may
get your fill of play and find lessons enjoyable
by next Monday.â

âOh, how nice, papa!â she cried, giving
him a hug.

âBut I thought you were fond of lessons,â
he said, pinching her cheek and smiling fondly
down into the bright little face.

âYes, papa, so I am usually; but I like a
holiday now and then. And may I drive Annis
out in the phaeton every day?â

âYou may, when there is nothing to prevent;
two or three times a day if you wish.
But you will want to ride sometimes. The
Shetlands can be used in the saddle, and I think
will be the best for Annis to learn on; if, as I
suspect, she has never ridden.â

âAnd you will teach her, papa? No one
could do it better.â

âIf she wishes. But Dr. Landreth and Mr.
Travilla are quite as capable; and she may prefer
to learn of them.â

âI donât believe she will. Iâm sure Iâd
much rather have you than anybody else.â

At that he only smiled and stroked her hair.

CHAPTER
IX.

âA sweet, heart-lifting cheerfulness,

Like spring-time of the year,

Seemed ever on her steps to wait.â

—​
Mrs. Hale.

â
Will
I do, Elsie?â asked Annis.

âYes, indeed! What a pretty dress; it is
so soft and fine and just matches your blue
eyes.â

âDatâs so, chile, shoâ nuff,â said Aunt
Chloe, smoothing down the folds of the pretty
cashmere, âanâ de ribbons de same. Now,
missy, Iâse done, anâ dars de suppah bell.â

Annis thought again it was like being in
fairyland, as Elsie, putting an arm about her
waist, drew her on through several spacious,
richly-furnished, softly-lighted rooms to one
more brilliantly illuminated, where a table was
spread with the choicest china and silverware,
and all the delicacies of the season.

Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore were already there,
and as the little girls came in at one door, Dr.
and Mrs. Landreth entered by another.

Mildred had exchanged her travelling suit for
a becoming evening dress, and seemed to have
put off with it much of the weary look she had
worn on her arrival.

The doctor, too, was greatly improved in
appearance by a change of linen and riddance
of the dust of travel.

When all had been seated, the blessing asked,
and the meal fairly begun, Annis, smiling
across the table at her sister, asked, âWhat
have you done with Percy?â

âFound a nurse for him and left him in her
care fast asleep,â replied Mildred. Then turning
to her Cousin Horace, âGood help is still
scarce with us,â she remarked; âa competent
childâs nurse not to be had; but with so many
sisters at home, all esteeming it a privilege to
assist in the care of the baby, I scarcely felt
the need of one there.â

âYou must have one here though,â he answered
with gay good humor, âfor we are not
going to let you shut yourself up at home to
such cares and labors while there is so much
enjoyment to be had in riding, driving, and visiting
among this hospitable and cultivated people.â

âI agree with you entirely in that, Dinsmore,â
chimed in the doctor. âI brought her
here to recruit and enjoy herself as much as
possible.â

âIndeed!â Mildred said, with an arch look
and smile, âI understood it was because you
couldnât do without me and your boy.â

âFor both reasons, my dear; and so loath
am I to be parted from you that I shall find
very little pleasure in visiting old friends, and
old familiar haunts, unless I can take my wife
along.â

âI hope you gentlemen will allow us some
quiet home pleasures also for a variety,â remarked
Rose. âI have been planning the enjoyment
of some interesting books and many a
chat with Cousin Mildred.â

âDiscussing the affairs of the nation?â asked
Mr. Dinsmore, with a twinkle of fun in his
eye.

âPerhaps they may be the theme occasionally,â
she answered demurely, âwhen we
have exhausted those, to us, more important
topics—​husbands, housekeeping, and babies.â

âFor those shall you require secret sessions?
deliberating with closed doors?â asked the doctor.

âPerhaps that you will learn in due time.
Cousin Mildred, I have learned that, like myself,
you have a great fondness for both books
and music.â

âYes; and I have been rejoicing in the certainty
that plenty of books worth reading will
always be found where Cousin Horace is.â

From that the talk turned upon books and
authors.

The little girls, both sufficiently intelligent
and well informed to understand and appreciate
the remarks of their elders, were quiet but interested
listeners. Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore
were attentive to their wants as well as to those
of the older guests, and the table was well
served by several skilled waiters.

There was an hour of pleasant social intercourse
in the parlor, after leaving the supper-room,
then the travellers bade good-night to
their host and hostess, pleading fatigue as an
excuse for retiring so early.

âDonât stay in your cousinâs room talking,
but let her get to bed and to sleep at once,â
Mr. Dinsmore said to Elsie, as the little girls
were about to leave the room.

âYes, papa,â Elsie answered; then going to
his side and speaking in an undertone, âMaynât
I come back to you for a little while? you
know it is not my bedtime yet.â

âYes, if you choose.â

âYou know, papa, I always do like to sit
here a little while just the last thing before going
to my room for the night,â she said a few
minutes later as she took possession of his
knee.

âNot better than I like to have you do so,â
he answered, putting his arm about her.
âWhatever should I do without my little pet
daughter?â

Rose, sitting on the opposite side of the fire,
with her babe in her arms, regarded them with
loving, admiring eyes.

âWhat are the plans for to-morrowâs enjoyment
with Annis, little girlie?â she asked, with
real motherly interest.

âI think weâll drive about a good deal,
mamma. Papa says we may; just as much as
we please.â

âAlways supposing you will remember to
have mercy on the ponies,â he added, playfully.

âOh, yes, sir! yes, indeed! Please say how
long you think we may drive without hurting
them at all?â

âI presume a couple of hours of moderate
exercise will not injure them,â he answered,
still using his playful tone.

âI suppose we shall have callers from Roselands
and Ion to-morrow,â Rose remarked to
her husband.

âYes, no doubt. And I think we should
give a family dinner party as soon as our friends
have had time to recover from the fatigue of
their journey.â

âOur Ion friends to be included of course?â
Rose said, half inquiringly, half in assertion.

âOh, yes. I have few relatives who seem
nearer than Travilla and his good mother. She
was, as I believe I have told you before, an intimate
and dear friend of my own mother.
What is it, Elsie?â

The little girl was sitting in silence on his
knee, her eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the carpet,
and a slightly troubled look had come over
her face.

âPlease donât ask me, papa,â she said, blushing.

âBut I have asked you.â

âI—​I was only thinking if Enna comes
with the rest—​â

âWell,â as she paused, seemingly unwilling
to finish her sentence.

âO papa, I oughtnât to think unkind
things! Iâll try not to.â

âIâm not going to have you abused,â he said,
after a momentâs silence; âso if Enna makes
you any trouble with the ponies, or in any other
way, Iâm to know it. Remember that.â Then
kissing her two or three times, âNow say good-night
to your mamma and go to your bed.â

Elsie lingered for a moment clinging about his
neck and gazing into his eyes with a wistful,
half-pleading look.

âNo,â he said, in answer to her mute request.
âI shall not have Enna domineering over you
in her accustomed fashion; and if she attempts
it you are to tell me all about it. Will you
obey me in this?â

âYes, papa; I know I must,â she said with
a slight sigh and a look of some surprise that
he should ask the question. âGood-night.â

As she left the room he turned to his wife
with the remark, âEnna is the most insufferably
arrogant piece! and there would be no
limit to her ill-treatment of Elsie if I did not
insist on being informed of it. And it is hard
for her either way, poor child! for she has no
fancy for telling tales.â

âThat is why you so seldom invite Enna
here or take Elsie to Roselands?â

âPrecisely.â

Rain was falling heavily when Elsie woke the
next morning. She started up in bed and sat
for a moment listening to it with a feeling of
keen disappointment, for evidently there could
be no out-of-door amusement while the storm
lasted. âBut our kind heavenly Father sends
it, and he knows and always does what is best
for us,â was the quickly following thought.
âBeside there are ever so many pleasant ways
of passing the time in the house. I wonder if
Annis is awake?â

Slipping out of bed, she ran lightly across the
room, and peeping in at the open door saw that
her cousin was still sleeping soundly.

At that moment her fatherâs voice was heard
from the opposite door-way, âElsie, my child,
donât run about in your bare feet. The morning
is damp and chilly and you will take cold.â

She turned at the first word, ran to him,
and before the sentence was finished he had her
in his arms.

Lifting her up he laid her in her bed again,
drew the covers closely about her, saying,
âLie still now until you are quite warm;â
then bending down to caress her, âHere are
your warm slippers and dressing-gown close at
hand,â he said; âwhy did you not put them
on, as I did mine?â

âI didnât stop to think, papa,â she answered,
putting an arm round his neck. âGood-morning,
you dear father, youâre as careful of me as
if I were a wax doll.â

âA great deal more so,â he said with playful
look and tone. âIt would be an easy thing
to replace a wax doll, but money wouldnât buy
another little girl like mine. How it storms!â
glancing toward the windows. âI am sorry for
your sake, but you and Annis shall have every
in-door enjoyment I can give you.â

âYes, papa, thank you; and I know weâll
have a nice time. Just think of all the lovely
dolls and toys you have given me, and that will
be new to Annis. And Iâve so many nice
books and pictures, and thereâs the piano
and—​â

âWell, that will do for the present. Iâm
glad I have a little girl who can bear disappointments
cheerfully. Lie still until the fires
here and in your dressing-room are well under
way and the rooms comfortably warm,â he
said, as he left her, closing the door after him.

âElsie, are you awake?â asked Annis from
her room.

âYes; but papa wonât let me get up yet.
Oh, donât you want to come and lie here beside
me till I may? if you wonât catch cold coming.
Please put on your slippers and dressing-gown
first.â

âCatch cold just running across two rooms
with such soft warm carpets on the floor?â
laughed Annis, hastening to accept the invitation.
âIâm not so delicate as all that comes
to, Miss Dinsmore. Oh, isnât it good to be here
with you, you darling!â creeping close to Elsie,
and hugging her tight. âExcept when I think
of mother and father so far away,â she added
with a sigh, the tears starting to her eyes for an
instant.

âYes, Iâm so sorry for that!â Elsie returned
with warm sympathy. âHow nice it will be
when we all get to heaven and never have to
part any more!â

There was a momentâs thoughtful silence,
then a talk beginning with regrets that the
storm would prevent their intended out-door
diversion, soon exchanged for plans for passing
their time delightfully in the house.

Annis had naturally a great flow of animal
spirits, and there had been nothing in her life
thus far to check it. Sheltered in the home
nest, the youngest of the tribe, and as such
shielded, petted, and indulged by parents,
brothers, and sisters, she had known nothing of
care, sorrow, or labor beyond what her young
strength could easily endure. Merry, frank,
fearless, affectionate, and thoroughly conscientious
and true, she was the most suitable and
enjoyable of companions for Elsie.

The two appeared at the breakfast-table with
very bright, happy faces. Indeed the weather
did not seem to have a depressing effect upon
any oneâs spirits. The talk about the hospitable
board was gay and lively, the travellers
reported themselves greatly refreshed and
strengthened by a good nightâs sleep and ready
to enjoy books, work, or play.

âWhat has Elsie proposed for your entertainment
to-day, Annis?â asked Mr. Dinsmore.

âOh, weâre going to have a fine time with the
dolls and baby-house the first thing. Iâve had
a peep at them already and never did see such
beauties!â cried the little girl in a burst of admiration.

âAh,â said her interlocutor, smiling.
âAnd there will be a tea-party or two I suppose?
Well, when you tire of the dolls weâll
find something else.â

âAre they prettier than Mildredâs and my
dollie, Annis?â asked the doctor.

âOh no, Brother Charlie! of course not.
And I forgot, we did think weâd have a little
play with the live babies first of all. I havenât
seen little Horace yet at all.â

âNor I Cousin Millyâs baby,â put in Elsie,
âbecause he was so sound asleep when you
came.â

âWeâll have them both brought to the parlor
after prayers, shall we not, cousin?â Rose
said, looking at Mildred, who gave a ready
assent to the proposal.

âBy all means,â laughed the doctor, âlet
us introduce them to each other, and satisfy
ourselves by comparison which is the finer
child. No doubt we shall all agree.â

âAgree to disagree, probably,â said Mr.
Dinsmore. âI am entirely satisfied that no
finer child than ours can be discovered anywhere.
And I know Rose and Elsie are of the
same opinion.â

âYes,â remarked the doctor, âI see it in
Elsieâs eyes. But no matter; I have Mildred
and Annis to side with me in the same opinion
of our bairnie.â

âAh, donât be too sure of Annis! she may
prove more unprejudiced than you suppose,â
laughed Mr. Dinsmore.

The others laughed in turn as Annis quietly
remarked, âPercy is quite as pretty and
smart as any baby could possibly be, Cousin
Horace.â

And it was evident that her opinion remained
the same even after she had looked with delight
and admiration upon the indisputably bright
and beautiful babe Mr. Dinsmore so proudly
claimed as his own.

âOurs is the largest,â Elsie said when the
two were brought into the parlor. âBut, O
Cousin Milly, yours too is
so
sweet and pretty!
Papa, he canât be quite so heavy as Horace;
maynât I take him?â

âIf his mother is willing, you may hold him
on your lap while you sit still in that low chair;
I donât forbid you to hold Horace in that way,
but you are not to carry either of them about.â

âYour father is wise and kind in making
that rule, Elsie,â said the doctor. âLittle
girls like you very often suffer serious injury
from carrying younger children. I wouldnât
advise you to do much of it, Annis.â

âOh, Iâm so strong it canât hurt me, Brother
Charlie,â answered Annis gayly, but Mildred
said, âIâll see that she doesnât do much of it.â

When the babes were carried away to the
nursery the little girls deemed it time to busy
themselves with the dolls.

But first Mildred and the doctor were taken
in to see Elsieâs rooms and the baby-house, Mr.
and Mrs. Dinsmore going along.

âOh, what a lovely boudoir!â Mildred exclaimed,
taking a critical and delighted survey
of it. âElsie dear, it is fit for a princess! and
full of evidences of a fond fatherâs taste and
affection,â she added, with a glance at her cousin,
whose hand was toying with his daughterâs
curls as she stood at his side.

Elsieâs eyes were lifted to his face with a loving,
grateful look as she answered, âYes,
Cousin Milly, and thatâs the very best of it.â

Annis grew enthusiastic over the dolls, âso
many and so beautiful; some of them so like
real live babies;â and when Elsie opened a deep
drawer in a bureau and displayed quantities of
pretty dress materials ready to be made into
garments for them, beside ribbons, laces, and
flowers, all intended for their adornment—​although
each had already several changes of
raiment—​her eyes fairly danced with delight.

The morning was all too short for the fascinating
employment of turning over all those
lovely things and exercising taste and skill in
making them up into dresses, bonnets, etc.

Elsie said her father had been on the point of
buying her a sewing-machine, but had decided
that she must first become an accomplished
needlewoman.

A little while before dinner Mr. Dinsmore
came in and made them leave their sewing for
a romping play, because he said the exercise
would do them good.

The evening was spent very pleasantly in
the parlor with the older people, who joined
with them in some quiet games, and when
separating for the night all agreed that, spite of
the inclemency of the weather, the day had
been a short and enjoyable one.

CHAPTER
X.

âOh, happy you! who, blest with present bliss,

See not with fatal prescience future tears,

Nor the dear moment of enjoyment miss

Through gloomy discontent or sullen fears.â

—​
Mrs. Tighe.

Morning
broke bright and clear. The little
girls took a short drive before breakfast and a
longer one soon after; the attractions of the
ponies and phaeton quite eclipsing for the
time those of dolls and baby-house.

Annis was taken to the stables to see Elsieâs
other two ponies—​very pretty creatures of
larger size than the Shetlands—​and a number
of fine riding and carriage horses belonging to
Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore. She was pleased
with the sight and eager to learn to ride.

âI never was on horseback,â she said, âor
ponyback either,â she added laughingly;
âbut Iâve always wanted to learn; more than
ever since I saw you on your pony the other
day, Elsie. It seemed so easy and so nice for
you to ride him.â

Mr. Dinsmore, who was with them, offered
to teach her, and to give the first lesson that
afternoon.

âThank you, Cousin Horace, Iâll be very
glad to have you do so,â she said; âbut youâll
be pretty sure to find me very awkward, and
will have many a laugh at my expense, I dare
say.â

âI hope we shall not show ourselves so rude
as that,â returned Mr. Dinsmore pleasantly;
âor be so unreasonable as to expect good
horsemanship from you at the start. Elsie
had been riding for several years when I first
took her in hand, yet I found there were some
things relating to the art that I could teach
her.â

âAnd papa is such a nice teacher, Annis,â
Elsie said, looking up at him with loving admiration;
âhe never calls you stupid and never
gets the least bit out of patience, no matter how
dull or awkward you are.â

âElsie makes a good trumpeter, and without
any instruction in that line,â was Mr. Dinsmoreâs
laughing comment on her remark.

The little girls had driven to the stables and
the pretty phaeton stood before the door with
the ponies still attached.

âPapa,â said Elsie, âI have taken Annis
all round the grounds twice, may we go outside
now?â

âYes, if you will accept of my escort,
but not otherwise.â

âOh, weâll be only too glad, papa!â was
Elsieâs eager rejoinder; and turning to a servant,
Mr. Dinsmore bade him saddle a horse
for him to ride.

They drove several miles, Mr. Dinsmore
keeping by the side of the phaeton all the way
and making himself extremely pleasant and
entertaining.

When they came in sight of the house again
a carriage stood before the front entrance.

âAh! I thought we should have callers
from Roselands to-day,â remarked Mr. Dinsmore.

âAnd from Ion too, papa,â said Elsie as a
second carriage came into view.

âYes, I see. Mrs. Travilla must be here;
for her son never comes in that when alone.â

The Ion carriage had arrived first. It was
more than an hour now since Mildred had been
summoned to the drawing-room to meet the
elderly lady she had learned to love so dearly
in her former visit to this region of country.

They met in a close, tender embrace, followed
by a long talk seated side by side and
hand in hand on a sofa; while Rose entertained
Mr. Travilla on the farther side of the spacious
apartment.

Then Dr. Landreth came in from a walk,
was greeted as an old friend, and the babies
were brought from the nursery to be duly admired
and caressed.

These last were still engrossing the attention
of their elders when Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore,
from Roselands, and Miss Adelaide were announced.

Mrs. Dinsmore, as richly and gayly dressed
as of yore, but looking still more faded and
worn, especially in contrast to the fresh young
beauty of her daughter, greeted Mildred with
languid affection, nodded to the other occupants
of the room, and sank into the depths of an
easy-chair as if completely exhausted by the
unusual exertion.

Mr. Dinsmoreâs greeting was warm and
hearty. âGlad, very glad to see you, Milly,
my dear. Young and fresh still—​as why
shouldnât you be?—​but growing more like
your mother; and thatâs the highest compliment
I could pay you or any one.â

âYes,â sneered the lady in the easy-chair,
âMr. Dinsmore has an eye for the charms of
every woman except his wife.â

But no one heeded or seemed to hear the remark.

Mildred had taken the hand of the younger
lady, saying, as she gazed with affectionate admiration
into the blooming face, âAnd this
is Adelaide? You were but a child when I
saw you last—​eight years ago.â

âAnd now I am very nearly as old as my
Sister Rose, who is already a wife and mother,â
was the smiling rejoinder.

âRose must have married very young,â said
Mildred, looking admiringly at her cousinâs
wife.

âMy mother thought so,â said Rose playfully,
âand for Adelaideâs sake I shall not
deny it.â

At this moment her husband came in with
the two little girls; fresh greetings had to be
exchanged and Annis introduced to those present
who had never seen her before.

Elsie glanced about the room and felt a sense
of relief in perceiving that Enna was not there.

Mildred noticed that while Mr. and Mrs.
Travilla and Adelaide all greeted the little girl
with affectionate warmth, her grandfather and
his wife returned her respectful salutation, the
one with cool indifference, the other with
scarcely concealed aversion.

Her father saw it too; his cheek flushed,
his eye flashed, and beckoning Elsie to his side,
he put his arm about her, and held her there,
now and then caressing her hair and cheek
with his other hand while he conversed with
his friends.

âHorace,â his stepmother remarked in a
tone of impatience, when at length a pause in
the conversation afforded an opportunity, âit
is perfectly absurd!—​the way you have of petting
and fondling that great girl as if she were
nothing but a baby!â

âWell, madam,â he returned with a slight
smile, âso long as it pleases her and myself I
cannot see that any one else need object.
When you are tired of it, Elsie,â he added,
gazing fondly down into the sweet little face
now blushing rosy red and half hidden on his
shoulder, âI shall stop.â

âIâm not tired! I never shall be tired of
it, papa!â she answered with impulsive
warmth; âbut,â and her voice fell almost to a
whisper, âmaynât Annis and I run away now
for a little while?â

âYes,â he said, releasing her, and with a
sign to Annis, who rose and followed with joyful
alacrity, she hastened from the room.

The two were presently busied again with
the dolls and their adornments, chatting and
laughing gayly together as they worked.

âAnnis, donât you think I have just the
nicest, kindest father in the world?â asked
Elsie.

âExcept mine; he is just as good and kind
to me.â

âOh, yes, of course! I forgot Uncle
Stuart.â

âI donât—​â began Annis, then checked
herself and began anew. âDoes Cousin
Horace never call Aunt Dinsmore mother?â

âNo,â Elsie said, with a look that seemed
to say such an idea had never before occurred
to her; âshe isnât his mother.â

âJust as much as Cousin Rose is yours,â
returned Annis.

âBut mamma is so sweet and kind; and—​â

âAnd Aunt Dinsmore isnât?â laughed
Annis. âI donât think Iâd want to call her
mother myself or grandmother either.â

âI donât believe she will ever let anybody
call her grandma,â said Elsie.

âCousin Adelaideâs nice, isnât she?â

âYes, indeed! she was, oh so kind and good
to me once when I was very sick and papa
away! I love her best of all my aunts, Lora
next.â

Just then there was a tap at the door and
Adelaide came in. âWell, little ones,â she
said, in a lively tone. âI have run away
from the older people to see what mischief you
two are at. Making doll clothes, hey? If I
had my thimble here Iâd help. As it is I must
try to be content to look on and perhaps favor
you with a valuable suggestion now and then,â
she went on, taking satisfied possession of an
easy-chair. âWe are all going to stay for dinner,
by urgent request of our host and hostess.â

âO Aunt Adie, Iâm so glad!â exclaimed
Elsie, âfor I want you to see my new ponies
and phaeton.â

âYes, Rose told me about them. I shall
expect an invitation to drive with you some
day. Annis, your younger cousins—​Louise,
Lora, Walter, and Enna—​are expecting the
pleasure of calling upon you this afternoon.
Lessons prevented this morning. By the way,
Elsie, what has become of yours?â

âPapa has given me a holiday for the rest
of this week.â

âHow he pets you!â

âYes, auntie; but am I not kept to lessons
more steadily than Enna is?â

âYes; a good deal more. I donât think he
spoils you with all his petting.â

A bell rang, and Elsie, putting down her
work, said, âItâs time to dress for dinner,
Annis. Aunt Adie will excuse us.â

âIâll go with you,â Adelaide said, following
them into the dressing-room. âI want to
see what you have that is new and pretty, Elsie;
your papa is always buying you something.â

âYes; and tell me what to wear, auntie.
Papa often does, but he didnât to-day.â

Adelaide, going to a wardrobe, took down
one beautiful dress after another, and finally
selected a pale blue of some sort of silk and
wool material, very soft and fine, delicately
embroidered and edged with rich lace in neck
and sleeves.

âThere, that must be very becoming I know,
though I have never seen you in it,â she said.

âDatâs so, Miss Adelaide, my chile look
mighty sweet in dat dress,â remarked Aunt
Chloe, taking it from her hand and hastening
to array her nursling in it, while Adelaide,
opening a bureau-drawer, then a jewel-case, took
from the former a handsome sash, matching
the dress in color, and from the latter pearl
necklace and bracelets, saying, âThese will go
nicely with it.â

âOh, how lovely!â cried Annis, hurrying in
from her room. âCousin Adie, will you fasten
my dress, please? I can do everything else
for myself, but not that very well.â

âYes, dear; excuse my neglect in not offering
you help with your toilet,â Adelaide
answered. âHow pretty and becoming this
peach-blossom dress is! but, like Elsie, you
have a complexion which everything suits.â

âHers is much prettier than mine, though,â
was the modest rejoinder.

Adelaide thought as she glanced from one
to the other, that it would be difficult to find
anywhere two more attractive-looking children.

The impromptu dinner party seemed quite a
grand affair to little home-bred Annis; yet,
seated between Elsie and Mr. Travilla, who was
a general favorite with little girls, she felt but
slight embarrassment, and really enjoyed herself
very much.

She and Elsie returned with the older people
to the drawing-room, and were chatting together
beside a front window when a carriage
drove up and two very stylishly-dressed young
ladies alighted, followed by a little girl and
boy.

âAre they the cousins from Roselands?â
Annis asked.

âYes,â Elsie said. âOh, I hope they wonât
want to take you away from me! I heard grandpa
say to Cousin Milly that of course you must
all spend part of your time at Roselands.â

âI donât want to,â whispered Annis, as the
drawing-room door was thrown open and the
new arrivals were announced.

The greetings and introductions over, Lora
seated herself near her younger cousin and
niece and opened a conversation, questioning
Annis about her journey and the family at
home, and expressing the hope of soon seeing
her at Roselands.

Then Walter and Enna came up, looking
eager and excited, and asking both together to
be shown the new phaeton and ponies.

âHow did you know of them?â asked Elsie.

âHow shouldnât we know when the servants
are going back and forth all the time?â returned
Walter. âI say, Elsie, have them harnessed
up now and let me drive them. Wonât
you?â

âAsk papa about it, Walter; he is the one
to decide.â

âNo; you ask him; heâll maybe say no to
me, but he wonât to you.â

âI donât know,â Elsie returned with a slight
smile, âhe has often said it to me when he
didnât approve of my wishes; but Iâll ask
him.â And she went at once to him with the
request, where he sat on the other side of the
room talking with Mrs. Travilla and Cousin
Mildred.

âWalter has learned how to drive, and I
think may be trusted if he promises to be gentle
with the ponies, and not use a whip,â Mr.
Dinsmore answered. âBut they are yours,
daughter, and you yourself shall decide whether
you will lend them to him or not.â

âThank you, papa,â she said, and went
slowly back.

âWell, what did he say?â asked Walter.

âThat I might decide it myself. Walter,
will you promise to be kind and gentle and not
touch my ponies with a whip?â

âPshaw! what a question! But I promise.
How long can I have them?â

âFor half an hour, and to drive only about
the grounds,â said Mr. Dinsmore, coming up to
the little group. âI donât want them tired,
for I have promised to give a certain young
lady a riding lesson with one of them this afternoon.â

âHalf an hour! thatâs no time at all!â
pouted Enna.

âWhat difference does it make to you?â
asked Mr. Dinsmore.

âWhy, Iâm to go with him, of course!â

âWouldnât it be more polite to let Annis
go? Annis, you neednât be afraid to trust to
Walterâs driving.â

âOh, no, Cousin Horace! but as I have been
twice already in the phaeton, I should prefer to
have Enna go this time,â Annis answered with
hearty entreaty.

âThey are at the door now; I ordered them
some time ago, knowing that some of you
would like to take a drive,â Mr. Dinsmore said.

Walter and Enna hurried from the room
without waiting—​the one to urge Annis to go,
or the other to thank her for giving up in her
favor.

When they came back they did not look as if
they had enjoyed themselves greatly. Enna
was pouting and Walterâs face was flushed and
angry.

âIâll not take her again,â he said aside to
Elsie; âshe did nothing but abuse me all the
way because I wouldnât let her drive; and
three or four times she tried to jerk the reins
out of my hands.â

âOh,â exclaimed Elsie, âIâm so glad it was
not I who was driving!â

âWhy?â

âBecause I should have had to tell papa all
about it.â

âYou donât tell tales!â exclaimed Walter,
with a look of surprise.

âI dislike to very much indeed!â she
answered, her cheeks growing hot, âbut papa
has ordered me to tell him whenever Enna
tries to domineer over me, and you know I have
to obey him.â

âYes, that is quite true. Horace is one of
the sort that wonât let you off any way at all.
Itâs hard on you too; but Iâll tell you what, Iâll
warn Miss Enna, and maybe itâll make her behave
herself when sheâs with you.â

CHAPTER
XI.

âI shall the effect of this good lesson keep.â

—​
Shakespeare.

â
Sister Milly
, may I come in?â

It was Annis at the door of Mildredâs boudoir,
where she sat meditating with her babe in
her arms.

âYes, dear, Iâm glad you came,â she
answered in low, sweet tones. âI donât see
much of you now that Elsie has taken possession,â
she went on, smoothing her little sisterâs
hair with tender, caressing hand as the child
knelt at her side to pet and fondle little Percy.

ââTisnât because I donât love you just as
well as ever!â Annis answered with quick, impulsive
warmth, holding up her face for a kiss,
which was given very heartily. âI wouldnât
be here without you, Milly, for anything. And
yet Iâm having the very nicest kind of a time.
Sometimes I think itâs just like a fairy tale with
so many lovely things about, and Elsie dressed
like a princess, and the ponies and phaeton, the
beautiful dolls and all.â

Mildred laughed a little and stroked the soft
curls again.

âAnd you are enjoying yourself, dear?â

âOh, yes, yes, indeed! but—​â sighing and
laying her head against Mildredâs knee, âI
wish I could see father and mother! It makes
me the least little bit homesick once in a while
to see Cousin Horace petting Elsie.â

âYes, my little pet sister, and I should like
to see them too, but we canât have everything
at once. We have these dear friends now, and
hope to have the other and still dearer ones
next spring.â

âMilly, you know you offered to hear my
lessons while we are here, but Cousin Horace
says he will teach me along with Elsie, if I like.â

âThat is very kind, and I think will be much
nicer for you, because he knows very much
more than I do, and how to impart his knowledge,
and you will enjoy having a companion
in your studies, especially so sweet a one as
Elsie.â

âYes; and she says it will be pleasanter for
her. Then it will save you some trouble too.
Weâre to begin next Monday morning. Milly,
donât you like Mr. Travilla?â

âYes, very much; and I love his mother
dearly. She wants us to spend part of our time
with them at Ion. And we must visit Roselands
too.â

âIâd rather stay here.â

âOf course the greater portion of the winter
will be spent here. Perhaps a week at each of
the other places will be enough.â

The visitors for the day had all gone from
the Oaks, and when Rose went to the nursery,
Mildred to her room, and Annis presently
slipped away to follow her sister, while Dr.
Landreth seemed buried in a book, Mr. Dinsmore
said to Elsie, âCome with me, daughter,â
and led the way to his private study.

âOh, itâs nice to be here alone with you
again, papa!â she exclaimed as he sat down and
drew her to his knee.

âYes, we donât spend so much time alone
together nowadays as has been our custom,â he
said, drawing her closer to him. âBut I hope
my little girl is enjoying herself?â

âOh, yes indeed, papa! I think Annis is
the very nicest little friend Iâve ever had.â

âShe ought to be, considering how thoroughly
well she has been brought up. But
I brought you in here to teach you a lesson.â

Elsie opened her eyes wide in surprise.
âWhy, papa, I thought you said I was to have
a holiday all week! and this is only Friday
evening!â

âThatâs a fact!â he said, as if she had
brought to his recollection something he had
forgotten, âand as I am particular about keeping
my promises, I shall not insist on teaching
you the intended lesson. We will leave it until
next week if you prefer that.â

She considered a moment, then said, âPapa,
I will learn it now, if you please.â

âI think you will not regret your decision,â
he answered, with a gratified look. Then
turning to his writing-desk, which was close at
hand, he took from it a thin paper-covered
book, and opening it showed her that the leaves
were composed of blank forms of checks.

âThe lesson I want to teach you,â he said,
âis how to fill these up properly. I have placed
one thousand dollars in bank to your credit,
and this book is for your use so that you may
draw out the money as you want it.â

She looked surprised, pleased, and yet a little
puzzled.

âYou are very kind, papa,â she said; âbut
you give me so much pocket money that I
never should know what use to make of it all
if I couldnât give it away.â

âBut you enjoy giving, and I am very glad
you do. At Christmas time you always need
extra money for that purpose; and Christmas
will be coming again some weeks hence. Will
you not wish to give some handsome presents
to these cousins here? and enjoy making up a
Christmas box for those in Indiana?â

âO papa, what a nice idea!â she cried, clapping
her hands. âAnd may I spend all that
thousand dollars?â

âPerhaps; we will see about it. Now for
the lesson.â

He showed her how to fill up the blank
spaces with the number, date, amount, and
where to sign her name, giving a simple and
clear explanation of the why and wherefore of
it all; then let her practise on several of the
forms, till she grew quite proficient.

She was greatly pleased and interested.
âItâs very nice, papa! how kind you are to
teach me!â

âI want as early as possible to make you
capable of managing your own business affairs,â
he said, stroking her hair, âso that if I should
be taken from you—​â

âO papa,â she interrupted, her eyes filling
with sudden tears, âdonât talk about that! how
could I ever bear it!â

âMy child,â he said with a tender caress,
âI am in perfect health and, coming of a long-lived
race, seem as likely to live to extreme old
age as any one I know; but life is uncertain to
us all, and it is the part of wisdom to try to be
prepared for any event. You inherit large
wealth from your mother, but riches, as the
Bible tells us, take wings and fly away; are
especially apt to do so with a woman who knows
little or nothing about business. I would not
have you at the mercy of sharpers and fortune-hunters,
so am determined not to allow you to
grow up either too lazy or too ignorant to take
care of your own affairs. I shall teach you how
to write an order, a receipt for money, to make
out a bill, and so on. But this lesson will do for
to-day.â

âNow these forms you have filled out must
be destroyed,â he went on, tearing them up
and throwing the fragments into the fire as he
spoke. âDo you understand why?â

âNo, sir.â

âBecause, bearing your signature, they
would be honored at the bank where you have
money on deposit; that is, any one getting hold
of and presenting them at the bank would be
paid the sums named in them out of your
money, and then you would lose just that
amount. So if you want to give or pay money
to anybody, your check on a bank where you
have money deposited will answer the same
purpose as the cash; provided it be not drawn
for a larger sum than you have there. Do you
understand it all now?â

âYes, papa, I think I do. May I tell Annis
about it?â

âIf you wish,â he said with a smile.
âAnnis is worthy of all confidence. You may
take the check-book and go over your lesson to
her; it will help to impress it on your memory.â

âOh, thank you, sir!â and away she ran in
search of her cousin.

Annis was still in Mildredâs room, chatting
with her sister and playing with the baby.

She opened the door in answer to Elsieâs
gentle rap.

âOh, Iâm so glad itâs you!â she said. âCome
in, wonât you?â

âAm I not intruding?â asked Elsie.

âNo, no, dear child!â replied Mildred,
âAnnis and I were just wishing for your company.â

âOh, I am glad you wanted me,â said the
little girl, taking a low chair by Mildredâs side.
âI should have come sooner, but Iâve been
with papa, learning such a nice lesson!â and
opening her check-book she went on to tell
all about it, for she felt sure he would not
object to having Mildred hear it as well as
Annis.

Both seemed much interested, and said they
thought it a very nice lesson indeed, Annis
adding, âAnd very delightful to have so much
money where you can get it whenever you want
it.â

âYes,â Elsie said, âbut I donât believe
papa meant that I could ever take any of it out
without asking his permission. And I always
have to keep an account to show him what I
have done with every cent he has given me to
spend.â

âThat must be a great deal of trouble!â
Annis remarked, with a slight shrug of her
shoulders.

âBut an excellent lesson too,â Mildred said,
smiling into Elsieâs bright, happy face.

âYes, cousin; papa always knows and does
the very best thing for me,â the little girl responded,
with a look of perfect content.

At breakfast next morning the gentlemen
announced that business called them to the city,
and invited both the ladies and the little girls
to drive in with them.

The latter joyfully accepted, but the ladies
preferred a quiet day at home.

âNow, little girls,â Mr. Dinsmore said, as
they rose from the table, âthe carriage will be
at the door in half an hour, and I should like
you to be ready by that time. But, Elsie, I
want you in the study for a little while the first
thing.â

He walked away in that direction as he spoke,
and she tripped gayly after him.

âIâm going to the bank to get a check
cashed; would you like to do the same?â he
asked, turning to her with a kind, fatherly
smile, as he opened his writing-desk.

âYes, papa. You will go with me and show
me just what to do?â

âOf course, my pet. If I thought there was
any danger of your going there without me for
years to come, I should very positively forbid
it.â

âAh,â she said, with a contented little
laugh, âI was pretty sure you didnât mean to
let me get out some of that money just whenever
I pleased.â

âNo, you are quite too young for such latitude
as that. Now sit down here and let me
see how well you remember yesterdayâs lesson,â
he said, dipping a pen into the ink and putting
it into her hand, as she took the designated
seat.

âHow much money shall I write it for,
papa?â she asked.

âAny sum you please not over fifty dollars.â

âI think twenty-five will do,â she said, and
drew the check correctly for that amount.

âVery nicely done, daughter,â he commented
in a pleased tone. âNow fold and put it
into your purse.â

âWhat will you have me wear, papa?â she
asked.

âThe blue velvet suit; unless you prefer
some other equally suitable to the occasion.â

âAll I care about it is to please my papa,â
she said, smiling up at him.

âThat being the case it is well that papa has
good taste, isnât it?â he said sportively, stroking
her hair and stooping to touch his lips to
the pure white forehead. âNow run away and
tell Aunt Chloe to dress you immediately.â

âYes, sir, it wonât take long; because it is
only to change my dress and put on hat, coat,
and gloves.â

Annis, now quite ready excepting her gloves,
was in her own room, the door of communication
with Elsieâs apartments open as usual.
Mildred, too, was there superintending her little
sisterâs toilet.

âIs Mammy here?â Elsie asked, looking in.
âOh, no, I see she is not. Iâll have to ring for
her, because there is no time to wait, and Iâm
sorry, for Iâm afraid she is eating her breakfast.â

âLet me help you instead,â said Mildred.
âYou see I have quite finished with Annis.â

âI donât like to trouble you, Cousin Milly.â

âIt will be no trouble, dear, but a pleasure.
And I should like to make some small return to
your good Mammy for the help she gives Annis
with her dressing.â

So Elsie accepted with thanks, adding merrily,
âWonât Mammy be astonished! She
thinks nobody can dress me but herself.â

While the dressing was going on Elsie told
with glee what she had been doing in the study,
and that she was to be taken to the bank there
to present the check herself.

Annis was greatly interested. âI hope I can
go along and see you do it,â she said. âBut
wonât you feel a little frightened?â

âNot with papa close beside me.â

âThat makes all the difference in the world,
doesnât it, dear?â Mildred said, finishing her
labors with a kiss upon the round, rosy cheek.

âMe too, Milly,â Annis said, holding up
her face. âNow good-by, and take good care
of my little nephew while Iâm gone.â

âYes. Run away now and donât keep the
gentlemen waiting. The carriage has just driven
round to the side entrance.â

âGood girls! you should have a medal for
punctuality,â Dr. Landreth remarked, meeting
them on the veranda.

âAnd for bright, happy faces,â added Mr.
Dinsmore, handing them to the carriage.

âI donât think little girls who have everything
in the world to make them happy deserve
much credit for that, Cousin Horace,â said
Annis.

âWell, perhaps not; but there are people
who can always find something to growl or fret
about.â

The little girls were very merry during the
drive, and neither gentleman showed the slightest
inclination to check their mirthfulness. But
for that there was no occasion, since there was
not the least approach to rudeness in any of its
manifestations.

On reaching the city they drove directly to
the bank in which Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie
were depositors. They all went in together,
and Annis looked on with great interest while
Elsie handed in her check, received the money,
and counted it under her fatherâs supervision.

They spent some hours in the city, sight-seeing
and shopping, and returned home to a late
dinner, the children rather weary, but in fine
spirits and full of merry talk about all they had
seen and done.

In the mean while the two ladies had found
equal enjoyment at home, spending the day
very quietly in Roseâs boudoir, each busy in the
fashioning of a dainty garment for her baby-boy,
and talking together as they worked.

Both young—​though Mildred was Roseâs
senior by several years—​both happily married,
tender mothers, highly cultivated women, earnest
Christians, they soon discovered that they
had very much in common.

Naturally their talk was at first of the pretty
work with which their hands were busied, then
of the little ones for whose adornment it was
intended, then of their husbands and the days
of their courtship. Each already had some slight
knowledge of the otherâs experience, but now
became more fully acquainted with it. Mildred
told something of her hard trial in the long
years of doubt and uncertainty while she knew
not where her beloved wanderer was, and of
the support and comfort she found in the presence
and love of One nearer and dearer still.

Rose had not yet known any trial more severe
than the parting from parents, brothers, and
sisters, and the loved home of her childhood,
but she too could talk of sweet experiences of
that âLove divine all love excelling.â

âThen they that feared the Lord spake often
one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and
heard it, and a book of remembrance was written
before him for them that feared the Lord,
and that thought upon his name. And they
shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that
day when I make up my jewels; and I will
spare them, as a man spareth his own son that
serveth him.â

CHAPTER
XII.

âI want a sweet sense of Thy pardoning love,

That my manifold sins are forgiven;

That Christ as my Advocate pleadeth above,

That my name is recorded in Heaven.â

â
Well
, Annis, will you take a riding lesson
this afternoon?â asked Mr. Dinsmore as they
left the dinner-table; then seeing the little girl
hesitate in her reply, âAh, I think you are
tired and would prefer a nap.â

âYes, sir, I believe I should, if—​â again
she hesitated.

âIf I will not feel hurt?â he asked with a
smile. âNo, not in the least. And I advise
Elsie to try a siesta too. Then we older people
shall have two bright little girls to help our enjoyment
of the evening.â

Elsie thought it a very nice plan, and the two
went away together to carry it out.

âYour prescription seems to have worked
well, Dinsmore,â was Dr. Landrethâs smiling
remark as the two young faces showed themselves
in the parlor shortly before tea, rosy,
bright, and beaming with health and happiness.

âYes; I find there is no other restorer of
wearied nature equal to restful sleep,â Mr.
Dinsmore said, regarding his little girl with his
wonted look of proud, fond, fatherly affection.
âAre you quite rested, daughter?â he asked,
drawing her to his side.

âYes, sir, I donât believe I shall need any
more sleep till after ten oâclock to-night,â she
answered, looking straight into his eyes with an
arch, sweet smile.

âAh,â he said, with amusement, âquite an
adroit way of putting a request to be allowed to
stay up beyond the regular hour for retiring.
Well, weâll see about it when the time comes.â

âAnd Elsie will be contented with papaâs
decision, whatever it may be,â added Rose,
smiling affectionately upon the little girl.

âAre you not fond of going to bed early,
Elsie?â asked the doctor.

âYes, sir, generally; but I think it is very
nice to stay up a little later sometimes, when
papa is willing and Iâm not sleepy.â

âAnd,â remarked Annis, âwhen the grown-up
folks are playing games, or talking in a very
interesting way, it does seem hard for little
folks to have to go away and leave it all.â

âYes,â said Mildred, âI can remember that
I felt it so when I was a child. Yet I mean to
train my boy to go to his bed at a regular and
early hour, for I am convinced that it will be
for his good.â

âI hope everybody wants to play with letters
again to-night,â remarked Annis; âbecause
Iâve hunted up some very hard words for Cousin
Horace and Brother Charlie to make out.â

âYou are not going to bestow all your favors
upon them I hope,â Rose said, playfully.

The older people being in an amiable mood,
the wishes of both little girls were gratified to
some extent; the greater part of the evening
being spent in word-making, and Elsie permitted
to stay up half an hour beyond her regular
bed-time.

Sunday always passed very quietly at the
Oaks; the master and mistress, having a
supreme regard for the sacredness of the day,
gave no entertainments and allowed no unnecessary
work in the house or on the plantation.
It was a time of peaceful Sabbath rest.

The church to which the family belonged
was some miles distant, but nothing except sickness
or extremely inclement weather ever kept
them at home from the morning service—​the
only one held there.

The afternoon and evening were also profitably
spent in studying the Scriptures for themselves,
and imparting their teachings to the
ignorant about them.

The first Sunday after the arrival of the cousins
from Pleasant Plains was clear and bright.
The ladies and little girls drove to church in the
family carriage, the gentlemen accompanying
them on horseback.

The short ride through a beautiful country,
in the bright sunlight, and pure, bracing autumn
air, was a pleasant one to all; to Annis it had
the charm of novelty, to Dr. Landreth and Mildred
that of agreeable association. How often
they had traversed that road together, or met
in the little church, during the winter she had
spent at Roselands years ago!

The Roselands family was represented to-day
by Mr. Dinsmore, Adelaide, and Lora. Mr.
Travilla and his mother, from Ion, were present
at the service also, and at its close there
was a little chat among them all in the vestibule
of the church—​an exchange of kindly greetings
and inquiries ere the ladies were handed to their
carriages and the gentlemen mounted their
steeds for the homeward trip.

âHow do you spend the rest of the day,
Elsie?â Annis asked, when they found themselves
again in Elsieâs pretty boudoir.

âPart of it in teaching the negroes about
Jesus and the way to heaven. Papa and
mamma have classes of the grown-up ones, and
I one of the little boys and girls. I tell them
Bible stories; sometimes from the Old Testament
and sometimes from the New. I have a
simple little catechism too that I teach them,
by asking the questions and making them repeat
the answers after me,â Elsie replied, with
an animation of look and tone which showed
that she felt greatly interested in her work.

âI like best of all to talk to them about the
wonderful love of Jesus,â she went on; âhow
he left that beautiful heaven and came down to
our world, and labored and suffered and died
the cruel death of the cross; keeping Godâs
holy law for us, and bearing the penalty of our
sins; and how he rose again and ascended to
heaven and ever lives there to make intercession
for us. O Annis, isnât it the sweetest
story?â

Tears were trembling in the soft hazel eyes,
and Annis, putting her arms about her, said,
âWhat a good little Christian you are, Elsie!
I wish I were one too.â

âOh, Iâm not at all good, Annis,â answered
the little girl with earnest sincerity; âbut I do
love Jesus. Donât you?â

âIâm not sure. I do try to do right, but I
so often do wrong that Iâm afraid Iâm not a
Christian.â

âBut, O Annis, Christians are not people who
never do wrong, but those who trust only in
the blood and merits of Jesus Christ; who expect
to be saved because of what he has done
and suffered, and who long and strive to be
good and holy because they love him and want
to please him and be like him. Not because
they expect to be saved by being good. Donât
you remember the Bible says, âThere is none
that doeth good, no, not one.â âThere is not
a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
sinneth not.ââ

âYes, I remember that, and that even the
Apostle Paul said he couldnât do the good he
wanted to, and couldnât help doing the evil he
didnât want to,â Annis said, thoughtfully. âI
see the difference is that Christians hate sin and
want to be free from it because God hates it,
and it is dishonoring to him; and sinners love
it and would only leave it off for fear of punishment.â

âYes, you know the Bible says, âBe ye
therefore followers of God as dear childrenâ!
Oh, I think I understand what that means! because,
loving my dear papa so much, and feeling
so sure that I am a very dear child to him,
I almost always find it a real pleasure to obey
him.â

âYes, and I can understand it for the same
reason. Isnât it a sweet text?â

âYes, indeed! and, oh how many others
there are that are âsweeter than honey and the
honeycombâ! as the Psalmist says,â Elsie exclaimed,
taking up her Bible and turning over
its leaves.

âMay I be with you while you talk to your
little scholars?â asked Annis.

âOh, yes! if you wish; and perhaps you
may like to teach some of them yourself.â

âWell, maybe,â Annis answered, and just
then the call to dinner came.

At the table Dr. Landreth asked Mr. Dinsmore
the same question which Elsie had
answered to Annis, âHow do you spend the
rest of the day here? I understand there is no
afternoon or evening service near enough for
us to attend.â

âNo, there is not,â replied Mr. Dinsmore;
and went on to tell of the afternoon instruction
to the negroes.

âAfter that,â said he, âwe usually fill up
the time with suitable reading, and I hear Elsie
recite her catechism, passages of Scripture, and
perhaps a hymn or two. Most of our evening
is usually spent in the study of the Word—​a
Bible reading in which the three of us take
part; and we are very apt to have some sacred
music after that. Will you and Mildred and
Annis join us in such exercises to-night?â

The invitation was accepted with pleasure by
all three.

âWhat subject shall we take up to-night?â
asked Mr. Dinsmore as they gathered about the
centre-table after tea, with Bibles, Concordance,
and Bible Text-Book.

âChrist a living Saviour,â suggested Mildred;
âliving still in both his divine and his
human nature.â

âThere could not be a sweeter theme,â said
Rose. ââWho is he that condemneth? It is
Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again;
who is even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.ââ

âI should like nothing better,â said the
doctor.

âNor I,â added Mr. Dinsmore. âI have
often thought that while we cannot dwell too
much upon the theme of Christâs life on earth
and atoning sacrifice—​his sufferings and death
in our stead—​we do not think and talk enough
of his resurrection and ascension into heaven;
of his mediatorial work there. Here in Hebrews
we are told, âThis man, because he continueth
ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the
uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing
he ever liveth to make intercession for
them.ââ

âYes,â said Mildred, âI have thought
much about it since a talk I had some time ago
with a gentleman friend who is, I believe, a
true Christian, yet surprised me greatly by remarking
that he had always thought Christâs
body ceased to exist after his death, because—​so
it seemed to him—​he had no further use for
it.â

âA very strange and unscriptural idea!â exclaimed
Rose. âWhy the Bible seems to me
to teach a belief in the resurrection of Christ
necessary to salvation. âIf thou shalt confess
with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
in thine heart that God hath raised him
from the dead, thou shalt be saved.â And it
was his human body that died, was buried,
and rose again.â

âWhat did your friend think became of it?â
queried the doctor; âmatter is indestructible;
and besides we are told that he saw no corruption.â

âYes; in several passages. Here is one—​Acts
13, beginning with verse 29,â and Mildred
read aloud, ââAnd when they had fulfilled all
that was written of him, they took him down
from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. But
God raised him from the dead, and he was seen
many days of them which came up with him
from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses
unto the people. And we declare unto you
glad tidings, how that the promise which was
made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the
same unto us their children, in that he hath
raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in
the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day
have I begotten thee. And as concerning that
he raised him up from the dead, now no more
to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I
will give you the sure mercies of David.
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou
shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
For David, after he had served his own
generation by the will of God, fell on sleep,
and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption;
but he, whom God raised again, saw no
corruption.ââ

âThere we have the whole thing,â remarked
her husband, âand as far as proof is
concerned, need look no farther.â

âBut, oh, maynât we go on and hunt out
other passages?â asked Elsie eagerly.

âWhat have you there?â asked her father,
for her Bible was open in her hand.

âThe fifteenth chapter of first Corinthians,
beginning with the third verse, papa: âFor
I delivered unto you first of all that which I
also received, how that Christ died for our sins
according to the Scriptures; and that he was
buried, and that he rose again the third day according
to the Scriptures; and that he was seen
of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that he
was seen of above five hundred brethren at
once: of whom the greater part remain unto
this present, but some are fallen asleep. After
that he was seen of James, then of all the
apostles. And last of all he was seen of me
also, as of one born out of due time.ââ

âDoes Paul tell there of every time that the
risen Saviour was seen and recognized by those
who had known him before his death?â asked
Mr. Dinsmore.

âOh no indeed, papa! Mary Magdalen saw
him in the garden just after he had risen, and
then—​ But, Annis, donât you want to tell of
the others?â

Annis looked her thanks, and added, âThe
two who were walking into the country; the
disciples met together in the upper room when
Thomas wasnât with them, and afterward when
he was with them; Peter and John and some
of the others when they were out in a boat
fishing.â

Annis paused, and Mildred proposed that
each passage bearing on the subject should be
sought out and read aloud, all taking turns.

âNot a link wanting in the chain of evidence,â
remarked Mr. Dinsmore, as they
finished with these words from the account of
the martyrdom of Stephen: ââBut he, being
full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly
into heaven and saw the glory of God, and
Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and
said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and
the Son of man standing on the right hand of
God,â—​we have just read, âthat he died, was
buried, rose from the grave, ascended into
heaven and there remains at Godâs right hand.ââ

âWhere he ever liveth to make intercession
for us,â added Rose softly, a glad light in her
sweet blue eyes.

Then Mildred read aloud from her open
Bible, ââseeing then that we have a great high
priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus,
the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
For we have not an high priest which cannot be
touched with the feeling of our infirmities;
but was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without sin.ââ

CHAPTER
XIII.

âWake, slumberer! morningâs golden hours

Are speeding fast away;

The sun has waked the opening flowers,

To greet the new-born day.â

—​
Epes Sargent.

Elsie
stirred in her sleep, half dreamily conscious
that it was near her usual hour for rising;
then some one bent over her and a kiss on
the lips awoke her fully.

âPapa!â she cried softly, looking up into
his face with her now wide-open beautiful eyes,
then putting her arm round his neck she drew
him down closer and returned his caress, with
a whispered âGood-morning, my own dear
papa.â

âGood-morning, my darling,â he said;
âdo you feel well and bright and as if a gallop
before breakfast with your father would be enjoyable?â

âOh, yes, yes, indeed, papa!â she cried,
starting up, with a face full of delight.

âWell, then, get up at once; let Aunt Chloe
dress you in your riding-habit, and give you a
glass of good rich milk, and we will go. Annis
seems to be still sleeping. Donât make any
noise to disturb her, and after breakfast you
and she can take a short drive in the phaeton.â

âI wish mamma was going with us,â Elsie
said, as her father assisted her to mount her
pony.

âIt would be very pleasant to have her company,â
he answered, âbut she prefers another
nap, having lost sleep during the night by the
babeâs wakefulness.â

âAnnis is getting another nap, too,â Elsie
remarked. âI peeped in at her just before I
left my rooms.â

âAh! then I hope she will not miss you.â

âOh, let us have a brisk ride, wonât you,
papa?â she asked as they passed out of the
grounds into the highway.

âI see no objection,â he returned, smiling
indulgently upon her; and away they flew.

Elsie had not been long gone when Annis
awoke. She lay still for a little thinking. She
remembered that to-day she was to begin lessons
with her Cousin Horace, and the prospect
was not altogether pleasant; she feared he
would think her a dull scholar and not so far
advanced in her studies as she ought to be.

Then it occurred to her that it was time to
get up. The fire had been attended to and the
room was very pleasantly warm. She threw
back the covers and stepped out upon the thick
soft carpet.

âAh, is you gettinâ up, honey?â asked Aunt
Chloe, peering in at the half-open door. âIse
done dressinâ my chile, and now I kin help you
ef yous willinâ.â

âThank you, auntie, Iâd be very glad to
have you do up my hair and hook my dress.
But where is Elsie? It is so quiet in there that
I thought she was still asleep.â

âYah, yah!â laughed the old nurse. âMiss
Elsie, sheâs done gone ridinâ wid Massa
Horace.â

âWhy, dear me! I must be shamefully
late!â exclaimed Annis in dismay, and beginning
her toilet in great haste.

âNo, missy, yousâ got plenty time, deyâs
early; datâs all.â

Much relieved by the assurance, Annis went
on with her dressing rather more leisurely.

She had finished, and was sitting in an easy
chair beside the fire, reading her Bible, when
Elsie returned from her gallop, and came in
holding up the skirt of her habit with one hand
and carrying in the other a little gold-mounted
riding-whip. She was radiant with health and
happiness, her eyes shining and a lovely color in
her cheeks.

âGood morning, Annis dear,â she said, running
to her cousin with an offered kiss.
âPlease excuse me for leaving you, but you
seemed to be having a very nice nap, and papa
wanted me to take a short ride with him before
breakfast.â

âI donât see any call for excuse,â returned
Annis, with perfect good humor. âIâm glad
you went; for Iâm sure it has done you good,â
she added, gazing admiringly into the sweet,
bright face. âHow beautiful you are, Elsie!â

âAh, donât flatter me and make me vain,â
Elsie said with sudden gravity. âBut you are
reading and I am interrupting you.â

âI can finish while you change your dress,â
said Annis.

âAnd have my morning reading with
papa,â added Elsie, hurrying into her dressing-room.
âPlease, mammy, make me ready for
breakfast as fast as you can, or I shall not have
much time with papa,â she said to Aunt Chloe,
who was there in waiting with a pretty morning
dress and sash laid out in readiness.

âYes, honey darlinâ, Ise hab you ready in
less dan no time,â she responded, beginning to
remove the riding hat and habit as she spoke.

Her toilet complete, Elsie hastened, Bible in
hand, to her fatherâs study. She found him
seated with his Bible open before him.

âI hope I have not kept you waiting long,
papa,â she said, taking her accustomed seat
upon his knee.

âNo, daughter, you have been very prompt,â
he replied, tenderly enfolding her with his arm.
âYour ride has not wearied you?â

âOh, no, sir. I am not tired at all.â

They read a few verses, talked together of
the truth taught in them, then knelt while Mr.
Dinsmore offered a short prayer. After that
she resumed her seat upon his knee until the
call to breakfast.

âYou have not forgotten that lessons are to
be begun again to-day?â he said interrogatively,
taking the small white hands in his and
softly patting and stroking them as he spoke.

âNo, sir, and I intend to try to be very industrious,
to make up for lost time.â

âThat is right, and I donât expect to hear a
word of grumbling over the Latin lesson.â

âPapa,â she exclaimed energetically, âif
you do I ought to be punished!â

âIn what way?â he asked with unmoved
gravity, though there was a twinkle of amusement
in his eye.

âAh, that of course would be for you to decide,
papa,â she said, giving him a hug and
kiss.

âWell, I advise you not to give me the opportunity.
Have you thought what you would
like to send as Christmas gifts to your cousins
at Pleasant Plains?â

âNo, sir.â

âBetter talk it over with mamma.â

âAnd you, papa. I do think you always
know better how to please with presents than
anybody else.â

âOh, my child,â he said, laughing, âif I
swallowed all your loving flattery, what a conceited
creature I should become! Perhaps you
can, in talking with Mildred and Annis, get an
idea of what would best please the others. Ah!
there is the call to breakfast;â and gently putting
her off his knee, he rose, took her hand in
his, and led her to the breakfast-room.

As soon as the meal and family worship were
over, the little girls had their drive. Annis enjoyed
it exceedingly, and Elsie nearly as much.

By the time they had returned and taken off
their wraps the hour for study had arrived.

Elsie took out her books, showed Annis her
lessons for the day, and seating themselves side
by side, they conned their tasks together.

They were about equally advanced in their
studies and could work together to advantage,
as Mr. Dinsmore discovered on hearing the recitations
and examining Annis as to her acquirements.

âPapa,â said Elsie, âI think it very nice
and enjoyable to have company in studying and
reciting, and I guess I shall learn all the faster
for it.â

âI hope so, daughter, but I do not like that
use of the word guess—​in the sense of expect,
think, suppose, presume, conjecture, believe.
Donât use it in that way again.â

âIâm afraid she has learned it from me,
Cousin Horace,â Annis said ingenuously.
âItâs a bad habit of mine that father and
mother both dislike. I have tried to break myself
of it, and I mean to try harder after this.â

âIâll try to remember not to use it any
more, papa,â said Elsie. âBut please tell me
is it quite incorrect or only inelegant?â

âIt is quite incorrect when one guesses
about things well known; it is only inelegant
when used in the sense of conjecture, divine,
surmise, suppose, believe, think concerning
something we do not know; any one of these
words seems to me preferable. The use of
guess in those senses is often spoken of as an
Americanism, but unjustly, as it has been so
used by Milton, Locke, Shakespeare, and other
prominent English writers.â

âI am glad to know that,â said Annis.
âCousin Horace, I think I shall like you as a
tutor very much indeed.â

âYou donât guess so?â he returned with a
smile. âWell, what do you say to taking a
riding lesson now?â

âOh, that I should like it greatly; if it will
not trouble you or take too much of your
time.â

âNo; I can spare time for that, and also for
a walk with my two pupils,â he said, laying a
hand caressingly on Elsieâs head as she stood at
his side. âHow soon can you be ready?â

âOh, directly, papa,â was Elsieâs answer.
Annisâs, âIn two minutes, cousin,â and they
ran gayly from the room.

âI havenât seen Milly since breakfast!â exclaimed
Annis, tripping along by Mr. Dinsmoreâs
side. âI wonder if she went into the
city to shop?â

âNo,â he answered, âshe and my wife
were returning their calls this morning. I was
invited to accompany them, and should have enjoyed
doing so had not business detained me at
home.â

âO papa, what a pity!â said Elsie.
âCouldnât you have heard our lessons this
afternoon?â

âThat would have been possible, but not
best, I thought; beside, I had other matters,
connected with the work on the plantation,
claiming my attention. Is Mildred wanting to
go to the city to shop, Annis?â

âYes, sir,â replied the little girl, her whole
face lighting up with pleasure; âwe are going
to make up a Christmas box for the folks at
home, and Milly says it must start soon to get
there in time; the journey is so long, you know.
We bought some things in Philadelphia, but
hadnât time to buy all we wanted.â

âMay I ask what sort of things they were?â
he queried in a playful tone.

âOh, yes, indeed, Cousin Horace. We
bought gloves, handkerchiefs, ribbons and laces
for mother and the girls, neckties and handkerchiefs
for the boys and father, and some
beautiful coral and gold armlets for little Stuart
Ormsby—​Zillahâs baby, you know—​and some
lovely fine white material for dresses for him;
and beautiful needlework to trim them with.â

âThank you for telling me,â Mr. Dinsmore
said; âand I should be very glad to learn of
some other things you and Mildred think
would please them, for Elsie and I must beg
leave to have a share in this pleasant business.
Must we not, daughter?â

âOh, yes, indeed,â she cried with enthusiasm;
âit will be a very great pleasure! I
want to remember each one with some nice
gift.â

âYou are both very kind,â Annis answered
with a pleased look. âWe all think at home
there never were such kind relations as our
Dinsmore uncle and cousins.â

âMy father is the soul of generosity,â Mr.
Dinsmore remarked. âBut those to whom
God has entrusted such abundant means as he
has to Elsie and myself, so that giving does
not involve much, if any self-denial, do not deserve
any great amount of credit for it; especially
when they find it the most enjoyable way
of using their money.â

Walk and riding lesson over, they returned
to the house.

It was time to dress for dinner. That
attended to, the little girls sought the ladies in
Mrs. Dinsmoreâs boudoir, where they sat in dinner
dress but busied with their fancy work.

The gentlemen were there too, chatting with
their wives and fondling their baby boys.

The moment little Horace caught sight of his
sister he held out his arms to her with a crow
of delight, for he was already very fond of her.

Hastening to her fatherâs side, âO papa!â
she said in her most coaxing tones, âmaynât I
take him?â

âSit down in that low chair, and I will put
him on your lap,â he answered.

âOh, thank you, sir,â she said, gladly
complying with the condition.

âWell, Annis,â said the doctor, âI hear
you are in a fair way to become an accomplished
horsewoman.â

âIn as fair a way as having the best of
teachers can make me.â

âAnd a good little pony to learn on,â added
Elsie.

âYes, indeed,â assented Annis. âMildred,â
turning to her sister, âyou didnât go
shopping to-day?â

âNo, we thought best to pay our calls first,
and that took all the morning. We hope,
though, to shop to-morrow.â

âCousin Horace, will you allow your pupils to
have a share in the shopping?â asked Annis half
laughingly, turning to Mr. Dinsmore as she spoke.

âIf the lessons have first been recited correctly,â
he replied. âMildred, will you allow
me a share in that shopping?â

âYour company is always agreeable, Cousin
Horace.â

âBut he means more than that,â Annis said
gleefully; âhe and Elsie want to buy things
for our box too.â

âAnd so you told them about it? though I
begged you not to do so,â Mildred returned,
reproachfully.

âYou are not to blame her,â remarked Mr.
Dinsmore, âit was no fault of hers. I wormed
it out of her. But I donât see, Milly, why you
should wish to deprive us of the pleasure of
taking part in such work?â

âJust because you and Elsie are both too
generous, and must have plenty of other uses for
your money.â

âMy dear little lady,â he answered smilingly,
âare not we the best judges of that?â

âCome, Milly, be generous and donât try to
keep your pleasure all to yourself,â her husband
said, standing by her side and looking
down at her with laughing, admiring eyes.

âI trust you donât really think I need that
admonition, my dear,â she responded, lifting
to his face eyes brimful of confiding affection.

CHAPTER
XIV.

âIndustry—​

To meditate, to plan, resolve, perform,

Which in itself is good—​as surely brings

Reward of good, no matter what be done.â

—​
Pollock.

It
was decided that the box for Pleasant
Plains must start within a week, so there was
no time to be lost in getting it ready.

Shortly after leaving the tea-table the two
little girls held a whispered consultation, the
result of which was that they stole quietly away
to Elsieâs boudoir and set to work with zeal
and determination upon the morrowâs lessons.

It was a lovely moonlight evening, and a carriage
load of company, and two or three gentlemen
on horseback, arriving just as they left the
parlor, prevented them from being missed for a
couple of hours.

Then the visitors having taken leave, the
elder members of the family began to wonder
what had become of the children, and presently
Mr. Dinsmore went in search of them.

âPapa,â cried Elsie, looking up from her
book as he entered the boudoir, âwe have
learned our lessons for to-morrow. Wonât
you hear them now and let us go to the city
in the morning with mamma and Cousin
Mildred?â

âI will hear the recitations, and if I find
them satisfactory shall certainly consider you
deserving of the favor you ask,â he replied,
seating himself and taking the book she held
out to him.

âYou have both done extremely well, and if
nothing happens to prevent shall go to the city
with the ladies to-morrow,â he said when the
last lesson had been recited.

Both the young faces were full of delight.

âThank you, Cousin Horace,â said Annis.

âThank you, my dear, kind father,â Elsie
said, seating herself on his knee and giving him
a hug and kiss. âAnnis says father always,
and it sounds so nice. May I say it too? I
mean would you like me to, papa?â

âAddress me by whichever title pleases you
best, my darling; both are very sweet to my
ear coming from your lips,â he said, holding
her close. âBut come now, we must return to
our friends; it is time for prayers.â

After prayers Annis followed Mildred to her
rooms to tell how her evening and Elsieâs had
been spent and talk about the purchases to be
made on the morrow.

Mildred sympathized fully in her little
sisterâs pleasure, praised her industry, and gave
patient attention to the other matters, and advice
in regard to them.

âI donât think we can quite decide what
will be best for you to buy till we see the pretty
things in the stores,â she said at length.
âAnd now, dear child, I think it is about time
for you to be getting ready for bed.â

âYes, I suppose it is. O Milly, I do love
you so! you are just like a mother to me, now
while we are away from our own dear mother,â
Annis said, giving and receiving a close and
tender embrace.

Dr. Landreth came in at that moment, and
as the two released each other, âNow, Annis,â
he said, âisnât it my turn? Iâve been your
brother for a good while and you have never
given me a hug yet.â

âI never hug gentlemen, except my father
and brothers,â she returned, coloring and edging
away from him.

âOf course not; but donât you acknowledge
me as your brother?â

âI think you are a very nice brother,â she
said, remembering his many acts of kindness,
âbut not—​â

âNot the sort you like to hug, eh? Then
you oughtnât to hug Mildred; because she and
I are one.â

âI donât think so,â she said, laughing and
shaking her head, âand I
have
let you hug me
once or twice.â

âAh! but thatâs another thing. See here,
Iâll give you this if youâll pay for it with such
a hug as you gave Milly just now.â And he
held up a double gold eagle.

Annisâs eyes sparkled. âThatâs twenty
dollars, isnât it?â

âYes.â

âIâd like to have it, but if itâs to be a gift
you canât ask pay for it.â

âTrue enough,â he said, tossing it up and
catching it again. âWell, how am I to contrive
to get what I want?â

âIf you really want it so much, Brother
Charlie, you shall have it for nothing, because
I am âmost as fond of you as if you were my
very own brother,â she said, permitting him to
catch her in his arms and putting hers about his
neck.

âThatâs right,â he said, kissing her on both
cheeks; âand now, as Iâm not to be outdone in
generosity, you shall have the gold piece as a
free gift.â

He put it into her hand, and with a half
breathless, âOh, thank you. I never was so
rich before!â and a gay good-night to him and
Mildred too, she hurried away, eager to tell
Elsie of her good fortune.

âIt was worth twenty dollars just to see her
delight,â he remarked, to his wife; âdonât
you think so, Milly?â

âYes; how kind and generous you are, my
dear husband.â

As the cousins left the parlor Elsie drew out
her watch, glanced at it, then gave her father a
wistful, pleading look.

He smiled and held out his hand. âYes, it
is your bedtime I know; but a little girl who
has been so industrious all evening I think deserves
a little indulgence.â

She was on his knee and he fondling her before
the sentence was finished.

âAnd papa is very glad of a good excuse to
indulge her and himself at the same time,â
Rose said, regarding the two with a look of
mingled amusement and satisfaction.

âQuite true, mamma,â Mr. Dinsmore returned,
caressing Elsie again and again; âbut
I hardly expected you to be so keen-eyed as to
see through my little subterfuge, so very small
a one that in fact I was hardly aware of it myself.â

âBut what has Elsie been so busy about? if
I may know.â

âOh, yes, mamma; of course you may; I
have only been learning and reciting my lessons—​Annis
and I—​so that we might go with you
and Cousin Mildred in the morning; and papa
says we may if nothing happens to prevent.â

âSuch, for instance, as a disinclination for
your company on the part of your mother and
cousin.â

âNo danger of that impediment,â remarked
Rose, with an affectionate look at her little step-daughter,
âI can answer for myself and Mildred
too, that we shall be glad to have them
with us.â

âThank you, dear mamma,â said Elsie.
âPapa, how much may I spend on the presents
for the cousins?â

âA hundred dollars if you wish. What do
you think of buying?â

âI donât know, sir. Mamma, can you suggest
something?â

âLaces, ribbons, gloves, handkerchiefs; a
lady can hardly have too many of any of those.â

âOr of books of the right sort,â added Mr.
Dinsmore; âor of ornaments for the hair and
dress. A handsome party fan makes a nice
present too. But we need not decide fully until
we see what the merchants have; it is sufficient
for the present to have an idea of what
we want. And now it is high time for my
little daughter to go to bed. Good-night, my
darling.â

Aunt Chloeâs busy hands were preparing her
nursling for bed, when Annis came dancing in,
holding up her double eagle.

âSee, Elsie, what Brother Charlie has just
given me! Wasnât he kind? and isnât it
pretty? I never before had a larger gold piece
than a quarter eagle. Itâs so bright and new it
seems too pretty to spend; but I mean to spend
it to-morrow, for it will buy ever so many nice
things for mother and the rest.â

âItâs a beauty!â Elsie said, taking it in her
hand for a moment. âI remember papa gave
me one three years ago when I was starting off
to buy Christmas gifts, and I was so glad; for
my purse wasnât nearly so full as I wished it
was.â

âBut this year you have a bank to fill it
from,â laughed Annis. âO Elsie, I do think
that must be ever so nice!â

âBut it doesnât make much difference when
you canât get any out without leave,â Elsie responded
with a smile and a little shake of her
pretty head. âI hadnât told papa I wanted
more money that time and didnât expect it in
the least, because he had given me fifty dollars
extra for Christmas just a few weeks before;
but somehow papa always seems to know what
I want. And he is sure to give it to me if he
thinks it good for me to have it.â

âYes, heâs a very nice father; and so is
mine;â Annis said, âthough he canât afford to
give me so much money—​partly, I guess, because
he has âmost as many children as the old
woman that lived in a shoe. O dear! I forgot
I wasnât going to say guess any more, Elsie.
Iâm afraid I shall spoil you entirely, and Cousin
Horace will feel like sending me home in disgrace,
if he doesnât actually do it.â

âNo danger of that; I should be less surprised
to hear him say he feared I should spoil
you. But he told me to go to bed, and if Iâm
not there pretty soon he may say I shall not go
to the city to-morrow. And besides I donât
want to disobey my dear father, though he
should not so much as say Iâm not pleased with
you.â

âThen good-night, dear, Iâll run back to my
room and get to bed too, as fast as I can,â Annis
returned, giving Elsie a kiss and hurrying
away.

The next dayâs shopping was a decided success,
and the two little girls managed to get a
great deal of enjoyment out of it. Mildred
was not far behind them in that, she had seldom
set herself a sweeter task than the selection and
preparing of these gifts for the dear ones at
home. For some only the materials were
bought, and then fashioned into beautiful
things by her own deft fingers; many a tender
thought, many a loving prayer, weaving itself
in among the stitches.

Annis and Elsie also made some pretty things
and had them ready in season too, though Mr.
Dinsmore would not allow any neglect of either
lessons or out-door exercise; and they as well
as the ladies were occasionally hindered by
calls.

Elsie had a number of little girl friends in the
families which kept up a more or less intimate
acquaintance at the Oaks and Roselands, who
when their mothers or older sisters came to call
upon Mrs. Landreth and Mrs. Dinsmore were
allowed to come with them as callers upon Elsie
and Annis.

It was no unusual thing for Mr. Dinsmore
to take Elsie with him when making informal
visits upon neighbors and friends, whether
Rose accompanied him or not; and he made no
objection to her going with her mamma and
cousins to return these calls of her young
friends; which they did as soon as the all-important
box had been dispatched.

He and Dr. Landreth were usually of the
party also, and the hospitable cordiality with
which they were everywhere received made the
little visits a pleasure to all.

The visit to Ion was the most enjoyable of
any, both Mrs. Travilla and her son were so
very kind and knew so well how to please and
entertain their guests, both older and younger;
Mr. Travilla was fond of little girls, and Elsie
was a very great favorite with both his mother
and himself.

He had a good many pretty and interesting
things to show to her and Annis, as well as to
the older people; paintings, engravings, flowers,
birds and other live pets, besides a cabinet
of curiosities. Some of these last were relics of
the Revolutionary War, and each had a story
connected with it. He told one or two, but
said there was not time now for more, or to go
into the details of any; that must all be deferred
for the longer visit he and his mother
hoped soon to have from them.

âWe should like,â he added, âto have you
all here for a week or two, or as much longer
as you please; but if the older people cannot
afford us so much of their valuable time, we
think we must at least have the little girls.
What do you say to it, Dinsmore?â

Elsie turned eagerly to hear her fatherâs reply.
Annis listened anxiously for it too, for
both were greatly interested in everything connected
with the Revolution, and thought a week
at Ion very desirable.

Mr. Dinsmore looked at them with an indulgent
smile. âI see they would like to accept
your kind invitation, Travilla,â he said, âas
doubtless we all should; yet while thanking
you and Mrs. Travilla for it, I think we must
beg a little time to consider the matter. There
must be a visit to Roselands, some entertaining
at the Oaks, too, and it will not do to make
pleasure the business of life, it cannot be all
holiday to any of us.â

âThat is very true,â said Mrs. Travilla,
âand these dear little girls need to be garnering
up knowledge now, in their youth,
to make them ready for the duties and responsibilities
of later years. Still I hope,
Horace, you will find that you can spare
them to us for at least a few days. Their
presence would brighten up the old place
delightfully.â

âYou are very kind, my dear madam.â

âTo myself, yes; Edward and I are very
fond of children, and your little daughter has
always been an especial favorite with us both,
as I am sure you know. If you should ever
want to get rid of her,â she added playfully,
âwe will be ready at a momentâs notice to take
her off your hands.â

âAh, yes, when?â he said, turning upon his
child a look of unutterable love, joy, and fatherly
pride.

â
Elsie
, donât you want to spend that week
at Ion? I think it would be just lovely! Iâd
a great deal rather go there for a long visit than
to Roselands,â Annis said, taking off her hat
and twirling it about in her hands, though her
thoughts were evidently not on it.

They had just driven home from Ion and
were in Elsieâs dressing-room, Aunt Chloe
busy about the person of her nursling.

âYes, I should like to go very much indeed!â
was the quick, earnest rejoinder.

âThen coax your father to let us.â

Elsie shook her head. âThat would be the
surest way to make him say no. But you can
go, Annis, if Cousin Mildred is willing, and
I think it likely she will be; donât you?â

âAs if Iâd care the least bit to go without
you!â Annis exclaimed half indignantly.
âBut are you never allowed to coax?â

âNo, not at all when papa is the person.
He generally says yes or no at once, and then
thatâs the end of it. Sometimes he says, âI
will consider the matter,â or âI am not ready
to decide that question yet,â and then I must
just wait patiently till his answer is ready. I
think mamma and Mr. Travilla can sometimes
persuade him when they try, and I do hope
they will try. You know,â she added with a
merry look, âhe wouldnât be so rude to them
as to refuse to listen to anything they might
want to say.â

âNo; and I think he might be as polite to
you.â

âPapa always is polite to me, I think,â
Elsie answered gravely. âBut you know itâs
his duty to train me up right, so he has to make
rules and see that I obey them.â

âOh, yes! of course; and I ought not to find
the least fault with him; to you anyhow.â

âDar, darlinâ, Ise done wid fixinâ you,â remarked
Aunt Chloe, smoothing down the folds
of Elsieâs dress. âNow, Miss Annis, what kin
I do foâ you? I reckon de suppah bell ring foâ
long.â

Not long after supper Mr. Dinsmore and
Elsie were left sole occupants of the parlor.
Dr. Landreth had gone to the library to do
some writing, being much occupied just now
with the business which had brought him South,
the ladies were engaged with their babies, and
Annis had run after Mildred as she left the
room.

Mr. Dinsmore was pacing thoughtfully to
and fro, Elsie seated beside the centre-table,
turning over some new books, but now and
then stealing a furtive glance at her father, very
much wishing he would call her to him, broach
the subject of the invitation to Ion, and say
that he intended to let her accept it.

Presently she caught his eye, and pausing at
her side he laid his hand caressingly on her
head. âWhat is it?â he asked, smiling down
into the wistful, eager little face. âI see that
my little girl has something to say to me.
Come, sit on my knee and tell me all that is in
your heart.â

He took her hand as he spoke, led her to an
easy-chair, and seating himself therein drew her
to his knee.

âNow, my darling, say on.â

âPapa,â she said, putting an arm round his
neck and gazing straight into his eyes, with
hers brimful of filial love to him and joy in his
love for her, âdonât you know all about it?
you almost always know what Iâm thinking
about and what I want.â

âNever mind how much I know. I choose
to have you tell me,â he said, softly touching
his lips to the white forehead and the round
rosy cheek.

âWell then, father,â she answered, dwelling
slightly, with an indescribably sweet and
tender intonation upon that last word, âit is
that Annis and I would like, oh, very much!
to accept the invitation to Ion, especially if you
will go too. Iâm not quite sure I do wish to go
without you.â

âWell, daughter, I think you know that I
dearly love to gratify you?â

âYes, papa, oh, yes, indeed! and Iâll try
not to want to go if you donât think it best.â

âThat is my own dear child,â he said, smiling
fondly upon her. âI have been thinking
that you and Annis might enjoy having a little
company of your young friends here to spend a
week or so of the holidays. What do you say
to that?â

âPapa! what a nice idea!â she cried, clapping
her hands.

âYour mamma and I will probably have
some older guests visiting us at the same time.
Mrs. and Mr. Travilla, I hope, among others.
I trust they will enjoy it, and feel content with
a shorter visit from us than they so kindly proposed,
and that Annis and you will be satisfied
also.â

âI shall, papa, and I presume she will. But
please tell me whom I may invite.â

âYou may first tell me whom you wish to
ask. We will make out a list together,â taking
a note-book and pencil from his pocket. âWe
have some weeks before us, but it may be as
well to send out our invitations at once, lest we
should be forestalled by some one else. Now
then, what names have you to suggest?â

âCarrie Howard, Lucy Carrington, Isabel
Carleton, Mary Leslie, Flora Arnott, and—​papa,
am I to ask anybody from Roselands?â

âNo; I shall attend to that. We are all to
dine there day after to-morrow, and I shall tell
Enna she will be welcome to come, and stay the
week out, if she behaves nicely, but that I shall
keep an eye on her and send her home if she
shows her usual ill-temper and disposition to
domineer. Your mamma and I will invite your
grandpa and his wife and your Aunt Adelaide.
Louise and Lora will not, I presume, care to
come—​your party being too young, and ours
too old for them.â

âBut Walter, papa?â

âYes; Walter must be invited; Edward and
Herbert Carrington also, and a few other well-behaved
boys of suitable age. They will entertain
each other and probably spend most of
their time out of doors. These will be enough
for you to invite to spend the week. We may,
perhaps, have a larger party for Christmas Eve.
You may if you wish.â

âDear father, how very kind and indulgent
you are to me!â she said with loving gratitude.
âI ought to be the best and most obedient
of children.â

âI think you are, my darling; and every
day I thank God for giving me so dear, so precious
a treasure as my only daughter. Suppose
we go now to my study and write these invitations;
if you are not too tired.â

âOh, Iâm not tired at all, papa; and I think
it would be nice to have it done; because Annis
and I are going to be very busy making Christmas
things.â

âAnd learning lessons,â he added, as he rose
and led her from the room, âthey must always
be attended to first; you will no doubt find it
difficult at times to concentrate your thoughts
upon them, but you can do so if sufficiently determined,
and I shall be strict in requiring it;
it will be good mental discipline for you.â

âYes, sir,â she responded with a half sigh,
as they entered the study hand in hand.

âAh!â he said playfully, bending down to
look into her face, âpapa does not seem to you
quite so indulgent as you thought him a little
while ago.â

âYes, papa, in everything you think for my
good; and indeed I do often thank you in my
heart for not indulging me in other things.â

âI donât doubt it, my dear, submissive little
daughter,â he said in tenderest tones, imprinting
a kiss on the sweet, ruby lips, as she lifted
her face to his.

âNow sit down here at your writing-desk
and let me see if you know how to word an invitation.â

âBut I donât, papa; so please dictate to
me,â she said, opening her desk, and taking
out a quantity of delicately tinted and perfumed
note-paper and envelopes bearing her monogram.

âVery well.â

âBut if you would write them for me, papa,
that would be better still; Iâm afraid I donât
write well enough.â

âI think you write a very neat hand when
you try,â he said, dipping her pen into the ink
and giving it to her.

âI shall try my very best now, papa,â she
answered. âIâll write Isabel Carletonâs first,
if you will please tell me how.â

Half an hour later she wiped and laid away
the pen with a sigh of relief, then glanced with
complacency at the little pile of dainty-looking
notes on the table beside her desk.

âThank you, papa, for your kind help,â she
said, turning to him.

âYou are entirely welcome, my darling,â
he answered; âand I am well pleased with
your part of the work; the writing is very neat
and legible. I shall send a servant with them
in the morning. Now let us go back to the
parlor, for your mamma and cousins are probably
there again. And I suppose you would
like to tell Annis what you have been doing.â

âOh, yes, sir; and I think sheâll be pleased.â

They met Mrs. Dinsmore in the hall.

âLetters, Rose?â her husband said inquiringly
as she came swiftly toward him.

âNotes of invitation, I think,â she replied,
pausing under the lamp to look them over.
âYes, one for you and me,â handing it to
him, âone for Dr. and Mrs. Landreth, one for
Annis, and one for Elsie.â

âFor me, mamma!â cried the little girl,
holding out an eager hand for it. âAnd
Annisâs, mamma, may I take it to her?â

âYes,â Rose replied, giving her the two.
âDo you know where she and her sister
are?â

âProbably in the parlor,â Mr. Dinsmore
said, leading the way thither.

They found the doctor, Mildred, and Annis
all there, and delivered them their notes.

âPapa, may I read mine?â Elsie asked softly,
standing close at his side. âI havenât
opened it yet.â

âYou may,â he answered, with an approving
smile.

âFrom the Howards of Pinegrove,â remarked
the doctor. âWell, we accept I suppose,
as a matter of course, as there seems to be
nothing to prevent.â

âNothing for me, I believe,â Mildred said,
âexcept that I donât like to leave my baby long
enough to attend an evening party.â

âNor I mine,â said Rose.

âOh, weâll make them an excuse for coming
home early,â said the doctor.

âElsie, are you going?â Annis asked.

Elsie looked at her father with wistful, beseeching
eyes.

âCousin Horace, you will let her go, wonât
you?â Annis urged in her most persuasive
tones.

âAre you very desirous to do so, daughter?â
he asked, drawing Elsie to him, smoothing back
the hair from her forehead with caressing hand,
and gazing tenderly into the depths of the
sweet, pleading eyes lifted to his.

âOh, yes, indeed! dear papa, if you are willing;
and you know you will be there too, to take
care of me.â

âYou are not very strong and I rather fear
the late hours for you; but if you can contrive
to take a good long nap in the afternoon of that
day, I will let you go, should nothing happen
to prevent.â

âOh, thank you, papa!â she cried in a transport
of joy, putting her arms round his neck to
hug and kiss him.

âOf course,â he said, looking at Mildred,
âI am taking it for granted that Annis is to go.â

âIt would hardly do to separate such fast
friends,â Mildred said, smiling upon her little
sisterâs eager, entreating face, âand I am sure
I may safely let Annis go wherever Elsie goes
with her fatherâs approval.â

âAnd I never go anywhere without it,
Cousin Milly, and never expect to as long as I
live,â Elsie said, with a sweet, happy little
laugh, as she gave her father another affectionate
hug.

Then she whispered in his ear, âWasnât it
odd that Carrie Howard should invite me just
when I was inviting her? May I tell Annis
now? May everybody hear what weâve been
doing?â

He nodded a smiling assent, and she immediately
availed herself of the permission.

The older people all entered into her pleasure,
and Annis was greatly pleased with her news.

CHAPTER
XVI.

âCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy;

For the apparel oft proclaims the man.â

—​
Shakespeare.

â
Milly
,â Annis said, following her sister,
as usual, when she retired for the night to her
own apartments, âwhat shall I wear to the
party? Have I anything suitable?â

âIâm afraid not, dear; but you shall have a
new dress and as pretty a one as can be found.
We have ten days for the buying and making.â

âBut there wonât be time to ask father or
mother if I may have it.â

âAnd no need,â Mildred said gayly. âI
am rich now, you know, and it will be a dear
delight to me to deck my little pet sister for
the party.â

âOh, thank you! Milly, youâre just the
best and kindest sister in the world!â exclaimed
the little girl, dancing about in delight, then
stopping short to throw her arms about Mildred
and give her a vigorous hug and kiss.

Mildred returned the embrace, saying with a
quiet smile, âYou forget that I am pleasing
myself. And donât you think Zillah, Ada, or
Fan would do as much for you under the same
circumstances?â

âYes; and I think I should for them. I
think we all love one another very much; and
ah, but I do want to hear how they like their
presents!â

âThey wonât get them for some weeks yet,
you must remember, and then their letters of
acknowledgment will take some time to reach
us.â

âMilly, what sort of dress shall it be?â
Annis asked, going back to the original topic of
discourse.

âSomething white I think; but we can decide
better upon the material when we see
what they have in the stores.â

âI hope Elsie will wear white too. I think
it will be prettier for us both.â

âI dare say she will; her father likes to see
her in white, and of course he will say what she
is to wear.â

âYes; and she has so many lovely white
dresses. Iâm sure sheâll grow too large for
them before theyâre half worn out.â

âYes, no doubt,â Mildred said with a slight
smile. âBut now, dear, isnât it time to say
good-night?â

âYes, when Iâve had a peep at darling wee
Percy,â Annis returned, stealing softly to
the side of the crib and bending over the little
sleeper with a face all aglow with loving admiration.
âO Milly, heâs
so
sweet and pretty!â
she whispered, turning to the young mother who
stood close at her side. âIâd like so much to
kiss him, but I wonât, for fear of waking him—​the
precious pet.â

On going down Annis found Elsie in her
dressing-room being made ready for bed.
âMay I stay and talk a little?â she asked.

âYes; while mammy is undressing me,â
Elsie said. âI do want to have a long talk,
but papaâs orders are to get to bed and to sleep
as fast as I can, and leave the talking for to-morrow.â

âThen we must, of course; but I want to tell
you that Milly is going to get me a new dress
for the party—​a white one she thinks. Isnât
she good? And wonât you wear white too?â

âI donât know. I hadnât thought about it
yet, and papa hasnât said anything either.â

âWell, you have such quantities of beautiful
dresses that you donât need to think till youâre
just going to put it on.â

âI donât need to think at all,â Elsie returned,
with a happy little laugh. âI have only to ask
papa what he will choose to have me wear; and
sometimes he saves me even that trouble by
telling me unasked.â

âI donât know whether Iâd quite prefer that
or not,â Annis said; âbut good-night, Iâll go
now, for I see you are ready for bed.â

Annis fell asleep that night and woke again
next morning full of pleasing anticipations of
the coming festivities; but wisely determined
to give her whole mind to her lessons until after
recitation.

Her toilet was almost finished when Elsie
came in, her eyes shining and her face full
of some pleasurable excitement. She had
been up for more than an hour, had had her
morning Bible reading with her father and a
little chat afterward.

âGood-morning, Annis,â she said. âOh,
make haste and come with me. Iâve something
to show you!â

âHave you? Well Iâm ready now.â

Elsie led the way to a part of the house
Annis had never seen, bringing her at length
into a large room where two mulatto women
were busily at work, one sewing by hand,
the other on a machine. Both faces brightened
noticeably at sight of their little mistress.

âGood-morning, Aunt Kitty,â she said in
her sweet, gentle tones, addressing the older
woman, who hastily laid down her sewing to
hand a chair for each little lady. âIâve
brought my cousin to see you and some of the
pretty things kept here.â

âIs you, honey? Well, you knows Ise
always powâful glad to see yoâ lubly face in
hyar. Anâ whatâs yoâ cousinâs name, Miss
Elsie?â

âAnnis Keith, Aunt Kitty. Rachel,â turning
to the younger servant, âhow are you to-day?
is that bad cold quite gone?â

âYes, tank you, Miss Elsie; anâ Ise pretty
well exceptinâ a misery in de back.â

âI think mamma would say you shouldnât
work on the machine to-day if your back hurts
you,â remarked Elsie, with a compassionate
look.

âOh la, chile, âtainât nothinâ!â exclaimed
Aunt Kitty, with a contemptuous sniff directed
at her companion. âRachel sheâs always âplaininâ
ob a misery somewheres, and de moâ you
nuss her up and let her off from work, de wuss
it grows. She better work away and forgit it.
Datâs how dis chile does.â

Elsie seemed too eager about something else
to pay attention to the remark. She had taken
a key from her pocket, and unlocking a large
wardrobe on the farther side of the room,
âAnnis,â she said, âwonât you come here for
a moment?â

Annis was beside her instantly.

âDonât you think this is pretty?â Elsie asked,
showing her some beautifully fine India
mull.

âOh, lovely!â Annis exclaimed. âAre you
going to have a dress made of that?â

âYes; to wear to Carrieâs party, and I want
you to have one, so that we will be dressed
alike. Papa bought it some time ago, a whole
piece, I think he said, and I shall take it as a
great favor,â she added in an undertone and
with a very winning, persuasive look into
Annisâs eyes, âif you will accept a dress of it
as a present from me.â

âThank you ever so much, but—​Iâm afraid
I oughtnât to,â Annis said, hesitating, blushing,
and looking half pleased, half as if the offer were
slightly wounding to her pride of independence.

âWhy not?â Elsie asked entreatingly.
âPapa wants you to—​it was he who thought of
it first—​and I shall be so sorry if you refuse.
Iâve quite set my heart on having our dresses
exactly alike, just as if you were my sister.
You know Iâve never had a sister, and Iâve
always wanted one so much.â

âYou are just as kind as you can be, Elsie,â
Annis returned, putting her arms round her
cousin and kissing her affectionately, âbut I
donât think Mildred would want me to take it.
Anyhow I must ask her first. Couldnât she
buy me one just like it in the city?â

âI donât know; mamma and papa both said
when he bought this, that it was an uncommonly
beautiful piece.â

âOh, it is beautiful! Elsie, so beautiful that I
donât like to have you give it to me—​it must
have cost so much!â

âThat makes it all the more suitable for
you, dear Annis. And it is not at all generous
in me to offer it, because it does not cost me
the least self-denial to part with it. Wonât you
take it?â

Annis hesitated for a moment, then said with
frank cordiality, âYes, I will, if Milly doesnât
object. You know sheâs in motherâs place to
me while I am here.â

âThank you!â Elsie said delightedly. âI do
so want you to have it. Let us run and ask
Cousin Mildred now. No; on second thoughts
I do believe it will be best to consult papa first.
He always knows just what it is best to do.
But wait, I want to show you the trimming
for our dresses; they must be trimmed alike
too, papa says.â

She lifted the lid of a box and drew out the
end of a piece of lace so fine, soft, rich, and
beautiful in design that even Annis, though not
a connoisseur in the article, could not fail to
perceive that it must be very costly.

She exclaimed at its beauty, adding, âYou
could never think of giving any of that away,
Elsie! Cousin Horace could not have meant
that you should!â

âBut indeed he did,â Elsie answered gayly.
âHe doesnât consider anything too good for
you; nor do I either. But thereâs the breakfast
bell, and we must hurry down.â

They found Mr. Dinsmore alone in the
breakfast-room. He greeted them with a smile,
and taking Annisâs hand gave her a good-morning
kiss.

âNow itâs my turn, papa,â Elsie said in a
merry tone, holding up her face so bright, loving,
and winsome that it would have taken a
very cold and unresponsive nature to refuse her
invitation.

Her father did not, though he said laughingly
as he bestowed the caress, âAs if you had
not had half a dozen more or less already this
morning! Well, what success?â with a kindly
glance at Annis.

âOh, I had to coax her, papa, but she will if
Cousin Milly will.â

âAh, is that it? Well, leave Mildred to
me.â

âNo, sir,â exclaimed Dr. Landrethâs voice
in his rear, âit canât be done! Mildred belongs
to me.â

âAh, good-morning to you both!â said Mr.
Dinsmore, turning at the sound to find the doctor
and his wife both there. âIâve no idea of
interfering with your claims, sir; one wifeâs
enough for me to manage,â with a merry
glance at Rose, who entered at that moment
by another door.

âA trifle too much sometimes if the truth
were told; isnât she?â Rose retorted as she
took her place at the head of the table, the
others seating themselves at the same time.

âMy dear, you should never tell tales out of
school,â said Mr. Dinsmore.

There was a general laugh, then a momentâs
pause for all to recover their gravity, and he
asked a blessing on the food.

At the first opportunity Mildred remarked,
âYou have roused my curiosity, Cousin Horace,
and I think are bound to gratify it. In regard
to what am I to be left to you?â

âDidnât I put my veto on that?â queried
her husband.

âYes, and yet I venture to assert that you
are every whit as curious as I to know what
it all meant. Cousin Horace, you are called
upon to explain.â

âWill you do me a favor?â

âGladly, if it is in my power.â

âThere, children, you see itâs all settled with
a word.â

âWhatâs settled?â asked Mildred.

âThat Annis shall have, or rather already
has, your consent to her acceptance of a little
present from Elsie. I shall explain further
anon.â

After breakfast and prayers, Mildred was
taken to the sewing-room and shown the intended
gift, while the desired explanation was
made.

She was not so proud in her wealth as she had
been in her poverty, and gracefully accepted
for Annis, though she perceived that the present
was by no means the trifle Mr. Dinsmore
had represented it.

âI had intended to give Annis her dress,â
she said, âbut I doubt if I could find anywhere
such exquisitely fine mull or lace so beautiful
and costly as this, and I think it will be very
nice to have the dresses alike. This lace is
superb!â examining it more closely. âYou
are making Annis a most generous gift, Cousin
Horace,â she added, looking up with cordial
affection into his handsome, kindly face, as he
stood by her side, âand I thank you and dear
Elsie, a thousand times.â

âNot at all; I feel myself the obliged
party,â he returned, âand I want you to do us
the further favor of allowing Annisâs dress to
be made up here. Aunt Kitty and Rachel are
accomplished seamstresses and dressmakers, and
will be well pleased to have the job.â

âDat we will, Massa,â responded Aunt
Kitty, as he turned to her as if for confirmation
of what he had said, âanâ I spects we kin do
de work up âbout right.â

This offer also Mildred accepted with thanks,
remarking gayly, âYou never do anything by
halves, Cousin Horace.â

The little girls, greatly pleased at the result
of the conference, ran off in high glee to take
their accustomed out-door exercise, then settled
themselves to their lessons with a determined
will to think of nothing else until they were
learned.

So fully occupied were they with the business
in hand that they were not aware of the
departure of their elders on a shopping expedition
to the city. When they felt themselves
fully prepared with their tasks they put aside
their books, rather wondering that Mr. Dinsmore
was so much later than usual in coming
to hear their recitations. But they practised
some duets they were learning together on the
piano, and the time did not seem long till the
carriage drove up and their four elders walked
in upon them looking as if they brought a
pleasant surprise, as indeed they did. Mr.
Dinsmore and Rose each put a small paper
parcel into Elsieâs hand, Dr. Landreth and Mildred
doing the same by Annis.

With eager fingers the children made haste
to undo the packages and bring their contents
to light, the givers looking on with faces full
of pleased anticipation.

Elsieâs presents proved to be two very elegant
sashes—​a pale blue and a rich cream-white.
Mildredâs present to Annis was the
same, two sashes exactly matching her cousinâs,
the doctorâs a jewel-box, which being opened
showed a dainty lining of pale blue satin, on
which reposed an exquisitely beautiful necklace
and bracelets of pearls scarcely inferior in
size and value to those belonging to Elsie,
which Annis had so often admired, never
dreaming that such would ever fall to her lot.

She went into a transport of delight and
hugged and kissed, not Mildred only, but her
new brother to his heartâs content.

Elsie fully sympathized in Annisâs pleasure,
was quietly happy in her own gifts, and grateful
to her kind parents.

CHAPTER
XVII.

âPatience, my lord! why, âtis the soul of peace;

Of all the virtues âtis the nearest kin to heaven.â

Decker.

When
alone with Annis that evening Mildred
said to her, âI had a talk with Uncle Dinsmore
to-day. You know we are all engaged to dine
at Roselands to-morrow, and he wants us—​that
is, my husband, you, and me—​to go prepared to
stay at least a week.â

âO Milly, I donât want to!â cried Annis.
âDo you think I must? I wish we didnât
have to go at all.â

âIt is pleasanter here, especially so to you,
I suppose, but consider, dear, how very kind
Uncle Dinsmore has always been to us, and
how rude and ungrateful it would seem to decline
his invitation.â

âIâm willing to go for to-morrow, but what
is to be done about my lessons if I stay a whole
week?â

âI spoke of that, and uncle said you should
be brought over every day for the lesson hours
and taken back again. Wonât that do, little
lady?â Mildred asked, with playfully affectionate
look and tone.

âYes,â Annis said, her face brightening a
little. âI donât want to be, or to seem ungrateful
to anybody, and I think I can stand it
in that way for a week. And Iâll try to like
the cousins there, though Iâm sure theyâre not
half so nice as these here.â

âNo,â assented Mildred, âbut you might
travel the world over without finding another
such little girl as Elsie.â

âYes, indeed, sister! I grow fonder of her
every day, sheâs so sweet and bright, often
merry and full of innocent fun, without a
particle of rudeness, so gentle and humble and
unselfish. She doesnât think herself good at
all, but I think sheâs as nearly perfect as anybody
can be in this world.â

âAnd I quite agree with you,â said Mildred.
âNo wonder her father doats on her as
he does.â

âAnd she on him; but the way Enna sometimes
treats her makes me angry. I can hardly
help telling Miss Enna she ought to be ashamed
of herself, and could almost scold Elsie for being
so meek and patient.â

âMeekness and patience are very good
things, little sister,â Mildred said, with a
slight smile; âI often wish I had more of
them.â

âYou neednât then, you have quite enough,
I think,â returned Annis.

âThe Bible bids us âlet patience have her
perfect work,â and it is certainly a lack of the
spirit of forgiveness that makes us irritable and
impatient under little annoyances, slights, and
rudenesses,â remarked Mildred; and opening
her Bible at the seventh chapter of Ecclesiastes,
she read aloud, âAnd the patient in spirit is
better than the proud in spirit.â

âBut, Milly, do you think it means we
ought to put up with everything and just let
people trample on us?â

âNo, I agree with Edmund Burke that
âthere is a limit at which forbearance ceases to
be a virtue.â See here, Solomon says, âsurely
oppression maketh a wise man mad.â And,â
turning to the New Testament, âhere in Acts
we read that when the keeper of the prison said
to Paul, âThe magistrates have sent to let you
go, now therefore depart and go in peace,â
Paulâs answer was, âThey have beaten us
openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have
cast us into prison, and now do they thrust us
out privily? nay verily, but let them come
themselves and fetch us out.ââ

âYes,â said Annis meditatively, and as if
thinking aloud, âIâve an idea he wouldnât
have put up with as much as Elsie does from
Enna.â

âWhat is it Enna does that seems to you so
unendurable?â asked Mildred, with some curiosity.

âOh, it isnât so much what she does, or even
says, as it is her sneering, contemptuous tone
and manner, as if Elsie were ever so much
younger and sillier than herself, when she is
really older and a great deal wiser. I spoke to
Elsie about it one day, and she said she was very
glad Enna didnât go any farther; because her
papa had ordered her to tell him if Enna
abused her, and of course she must obey, and
she did dislike so very much to do it.â

Elsie seldom found much enjoyment in a
visit to Roselands. Her Aunt Adelaide was
the only member of the family there between
whom and herself there was a strong mutual
attachment, though Lora and Walter were not
unkind, and sometimes treated her even quite
affectionately.

She and Annis were not in haste to be off
from the Oaks on the day of the dinner party,
so did not ask to be excused from lessons in
order to accompany Rose and Mildred in the
family carriage; they had their morning walk
together, Annis took her riding lesson, then the
usual time was spent in study and recitation.

After that they made their dinner toilets, and
Elsie drove Annis over in her own little phaeton,
her father riding by its side all the way to
Roselands.

It was not strictly a family party; there were
several gentlemen guests beside Mr. Dinsmore
and Dr. Landreth; among whom the children
were glad to see Mr. Travilla. His mother was
there also, and not too busy talking to the
grown-up people to find time for a little chat
with her two young favorites.

They had each brought a bit of fancy work,
and until dinner was announced sat in the drawing-room,
busy and demurely quiet, listening
with interest to the talk that was going on
around them, but taking no part in it unless a
question or remark were addressed particularly
to them.

The moment Walter and Enna caught sight
of the phaeton driving up the avenue, they ran
out to the veranda, and hardly waiting to greet
their brother and the little girls, asked eagerly
to be allowed to take a drive in it.

âIt belongs to Elsie,â Mr. Dinsmore
answered.

âPapa,â she said in an undertone, as he
helped her out, âI am willing if you are. But
please tell them they are not to ill-use the
ponies in any way.â

âI shall ride alongside and see that they do
not,â he said. âYou and Annis go in and say
that I will be here in season for dinner.â

âSay, Horace; say, can I drive?â Walter
was repeating impatiently.

âYes, Elsie says you may.â

âThen Iâm going too,â cried Enna, stepping
in.

âNo, En, you canât go bareheaded and
with nothing round you; and thereâs not time
to wait for you to fix; and Iâll not have you,
because youâll do nothing but scold and quarrel
all the way.â

âNo, she wonât, for I shall be close at hand
to keep her in order,â said Mr. Dinsmore, remounting
his horse.

âAnd here comes Fanny with a hood and
shawl for me,â said Enna, as a servant-maid
came hurrying out with the articles mentioned.

Walter, like the gentlemanly little fellow he
was when not provoked beyond endurance by
Ennaâs temper and wilfulness, helped the girl
to wrap the shawl about his sisterâs shoulders,
the hood was tied on, and they were off; down
the avenue and out into the road they went, the
ponies at a brisk trot, Mr. Dinsmoreâs horse
side-by-side with the phaeton.

âWhat a splendid little turnout it is!â exclaimed
Walter. âWish I had one like it.â

âYou have a good pony,â said his brother,
âand I should think would, at least as a general
thing, prefer riding to driving.â

âHorace, maynât I drive?â asked Enna in a
whining tone.

âPerhaps Walter will resign the reins to you
a part of the way,â Mr. Dinsmore answered,
âbut we have not time to go very far.â

âYou may drive to the end of the next
field,â Walter said, giving her the reins.

âSuch a little bit of a way!â she grumbled,
and would certainly have held on to them when
the designated spot was reached if Mr. Dinsmore
had not been so close at hand.

He seemed in a most amiable mood, conversing
with the two children in an affable and entertaining
manner; but Enna knew he could be
very stern and authoritative on occasion. So a
pout was the only evidence of displeasure she
ventured upon when Walter resumed the reins.

But no notice was taken of it by either
brother, and presently Mr. Dinsmore began
talking of the expected festivities at the Oaks,
and gave them their invitation, adding, âYou,
Enna, will be very welcome to come and stay
the whole week if you can enjoy yourself and
let others do the same.â

âWhat do you mean by that?â she asked,
snappishly.

âThat you must be pleasant-tempered; not
domineering over your little mates, but willing
to yield your wishes to theirs to a reasonable
extent; in a word, be polite and unselfish.â

âI shanât go!â

âVery well; please yourself in that.â

âIâll go, Horace, thank you,â Walter said.
âI wouldnât miss it for a good deal.â

âI say itâs too bad,â Enna burst out, âthat
people are always calling me selfish and ill-natured
and domineering. I should think Iâve
as good a right to have my way as anybody
else.â

âNot all the time,â returned Mr. Dinsmore.
âAnd hardly at all when you are a minority of
one against a majority of half a dozen or more.
But I certainly did not say you were selfish and
domineering.â

On their return they found themselves barely
in time for dinner. The party not being very
large, the children were allowed to dine with the
older people, and Elsie, to her no small content,
was seated between her father and Mr. Travilla,
Annis being on the latter gentlemanâs other
side.

Both little girls were well waited upon and
were quietly happy and contented, saying next
to nothing themselves, but enjoying the conversation
of their elders.

Walter, seated on the opposite side of the
table, seemed in excellent spirits.

âThatâs a splendid little turnout of yours,â
he said, looking across at Elsie. âI tell you I
enjoyed the drive, only it wasnât half long
enough. But youâll lend it to me again,
wonât you?â

She smiled and nodded assent.

âIâm going to the Oaks to spend Christmas
week, but Enna says she isnât,â he went on in a
lowered voice, glancing in Ennaâs direction.

Elsieâs eyes followed his, and she saw that
Ennaâs face was clouded and angry. She was
sorry, but made no remark about it.

After dinner Lora invited Elsie and Annis
to her room to show them some pretty things
she was making as Christmas gifts for her
father and mother, and to talk about what she
should wear to the party at Pine Grove. She
was quite surprised to hear that they were both
invited, still more that Elsieâs father had
consented to let her go. Then she wanted to
know just how they were to be dressed.

Enna came in while they were on that subject,
and exclaimed angrily that it was too bad
they should be invited and she not.

âYou are too young,â said Lora, âand besides
always contrive to make yourself disagreeable
wherever you go.â

Loraâs words were by no means as oil upon
the troubled waters. Enna flew into a violent
passion and abused her sister and niece in turn.
Lora was âa mean, spiteful, hateful thing;
Elsie not a bit better.â

âWhy, Enna, what have I done?â Elsie
asked in surprise, but with a gentle patience
and forbearance that ought to have disarmed
her accuser.

âYouâve done a great deal,â stormed Enna;
âI believe youâre always running to Horace
with tales about me. And youâve gone and got
ahead of me by inviting all the girls to the
Oaks for Christmas, so that I canât have any of
them here.â

âNow, Enna,â expostulated Lora, âthereâs
no use in talking so. You know mamma has
said she wouldnât be bothered with a houseful
of company this Christmas, and we younger
ones are all going away to spend the holidays.â

âNo, Iâm not,â interrupted the irate Enna.
âIâd rather a thousand times stay at home than
go to the old Oaks, to have Horace lecturing
and reproving, and Elsie running to him all the
time with tales about me.â

âO Enna!â Elsie exclaimed, blushing painfully.
âI never tell anything about you
unless papa orders me, and then you know I
canât help it.â

âYou could if you chose. Iâd never tell
tales for being ordered!â returned Enna, with
scornful look and tone.

âNo,â remarked Lora, coolly, âbut you are
ready enough to do it without. And you
neednât say another word about Elsie getting
ahead of you in sending out invitations, for you
never thought of doing so till you heard that
she had; and besides, you are so unpopular
with your mates that they would find some
excuse for not coming, if you did invite
them.â

Elsie was not sorry that at that moment a
summons came for her from her father.

She obeyed at once, Annis and Lora accompanying
her to the drawing-room, where they
found she was wanted to play and sing; some
of the stranger guests having expressed a desire
to hear her.

It was always a trial to her to play before
strangers, but she sat down to the piano, in
obedience to her fatherâs direction, without
hesitation or excuse, and acquitted herself to his
entire satisfaction and apparently to that of all
the guests.

She did not leave the drawing-room again, or
have any more talk with Enna, until it was
time to prepare for the ride home.

It seemed lonely to go back without the
cousins, and especially to leave Annis behind.
But as compensation she had her father and
mother all to herself for the whole evening,
and was allowed to sit longer than usual in her
favorite seat upon his knee.

Annis was there again the next morning in
good season to prepare her lessons for the day,
and the two met as joyfully as if the separation
had been for weeks.

After their recitations Annis had to have
her new dress fitted, then to take her riding
lesson, before returning to Roselands.

Elsie saw her off, then went to her papaâs
study, where he was busily writing. She knew
she was welcome there if she did nothing to
disturb him, so took a book and seated herself
on the farther side of the room.

Mr. Dinsmore was still at his writing-desk
when a servant came in with a visiting-card
which he handed to his master, saying he had
shown the gentleman into the parlor.

âIt is a business call,â Mr. Dinsmore said,
glancing at the card. âJust show him in here,
John.â

Elsie had become so deeply interested in her
book that she heard nothing of this, nor was
she aware of the entrance of the caller, who was
courteously received by Mr. Dinsmore and invited
to take a chair which John set for him
near to that of his master.

The two then fell into earnest talk, and presently
something said by the stranger catching
Elsieâs ear, withdrew her attention from the
book and fixed it upon him and the subject of
his discourse.

He was pleading the cause of Home Missions,
telling of the needs, the labors, trials, and
privations of those who were carrying the gospel
to the destitute regions of our own land,
especially the far West and Northwest. Money
was needed for the support of the laborers now
in the field, and for others ready to go as soon as
the necessary means should be provided.

Elsie laid aside her book and softly drew near
her fatherâs chair. He had forgotten her
presence and did not notice her approach, for
he too was deeply interested in what the stranger
was saying; and when he seemed to have
concluded, responded at once with a liberal
contribution to the cause.

As he handed the gentleman his check, a
little voice at his side said softly, âPapa, may
I give something too?â

âAh, daughter, is it you? I had forgotten
that you were here,â he said, turning to her
with a pleased smile. âYes, you may if you
wish,â and he laid a blank check before her and
put a pen in her hand.

âHow much, papa?â

âI shall leave that to your decision.â

She considered a moment, filled up the
check, signed, and gave it to him. It was
drawn for five hundred dollars.

Her look as her eyes met his was a little
doubtful and timid. But he said, âVery
well,â smiling upon her and stroking her hair
caressingly as he spoke. Then turning to the
stranger he introduced her. âThis, sir, is my
little daughter, and she wishes to make a contribution
of her own to this good cause.â

The gentleman shook hands with her, regarding
the sweet child face with evident admiration
and saying a few pleasant words, then
glancing at the check she had given him,
uttered an exclamation of gratified surprise.

âShe is well able to give it and has my full
consent,â Mr. Dinsmore remarked in explanation,
as the gentleman turned upon him an inquiring,
half-hesitating look; then as he rose
to go, he hospitably urged him to stay for
dinner, and until the next day if he could.

He accepted the invitation to dine, thus
giving them the opportunity to learn still more
of the cause he represented, but took leave
very soon after the conclusion of the meal.

CHAPTER
XVIII.

âHumility, that low, sweet root,

From which all heavenly virtues shoot.â

—​
Moore.

The
week of their partial separation passed
more rapidly than Elsie and Annis had thought
possible, yet they were very glad when it was
over and they were again almost constantly
together.

When lessons were done on the morning
that Annis came back to stay, Elsie carried
her off to the sewing-room, saying their party
dresses were finished and Aunt Kitty wanted
to see them tried on to make sure that no
alteration was needed.

Both were found to fit perfectly, they were
very neatly made and very beautiful and
becoming.

âOh, arenât they just too lovely for anything!â
cried Annis, gazing at Elsie, then
turning to survey her own graceful little figure
in the glass.

âYou look so sweet in yours, Annis,â Elsie
said, her eyes full of genuine, loving admiration
as they went from the dress up to the
bright, happy face of the wearer. âLet us
run and show ourselves to mamma and Cousin
Mildred. I think they are in mammaâs boudoir.â

The ladies were found, and their verdict was
entirely satisfactory; they could see no room
for improvement in the dresses.

âOr the faces either,â Rose said in a whispered
aside to Mildred.

âBoth are very sweet and winsome, but
Elsieâs far the more beautiful of the two,â
Mildred returned, in the same low tone, but
with a loving look at her little pet sister.

Then the gentlemen came in, and they two
admired and commended.

âNow, little girls,â Mr. Dinsmore said,
âyour ponies and my horse are standing
ready saddled and bridled at the door, and if
you will exchange this finery for your riding-habits,
we will take a gallop. Annis is equal
to that now, I think.â

âOh, thank you! Cousin Horace,â she exclaimed
in delight. Then to Elsie, as they ran
gayly to do his bidding, âWeâll doff our
finery willingly enough for that, wonât we?â

âYes, indeed! Iâm so glad you enjoy riding,
Annis. I always did; especially with papa for
my escort.â

They had their ride, enjoyed it greatly too;
then an hour for needle-work or anything they
chose to do, before dinner.

In the afternoon they were starting out for
a walk together about the grounds. Annis,
who was a little in advance of Elsie, called back
to her from the veranda. âThe sun has gone
under a cloud; do you think thereâs any danger
of rain before we get back?â

âI guess not,â Elsie answered.

Her papaâs study-door was ajar and she
quite near it as she spoke.

âElsie!â came in grave, reproving tones
from within.

âSir!â and she hastened to him.

He was writing and for a moment seemed
oblivious of her presence.

âI am here, papa,â she said softly as he
paused to dip his pen in the ink.

âI am not pleased with you,â he remarked,
without looking at her.

âO papa! why?â The sweet voice was
tremulous with pain and surprise.

âI cannot be pleased with you when you
are not careful to obey me.â

âPapa, I have intended to be so; I—​I donât
know what I have done that—​that you bade me
not.â

âThink a moment. What was it you said
as you passed the door just now?â

âOnly three words, papa, in answer to
Annis, âI guess not.ââ

âAh! and what did I say to you the other
day about using guess in that way?â

âYou forbade me,â she faltered, her eyes
filling with tears. âO papa, please forgive me
this once! Iâll try never to forget again. Iâm
sorry, very sorry, dear papa.â

He laid down his pen, turned toward her and
held out his arms.

She sprang into them, put hers about his
neck, and laid her cheek to his.

âThis once,â he said, caressing her softly,
âbut my little girl must be careful not to forget
again.â

âYouâd have to punish me another time?â

âYes.â

âI—​I think—​â

âWell?â

âIâm afraid I ought to be punished this time
to help me to remember. But oh, please donât
say I canât go to the party!â

âNo, I shall not do that, it shall be free forgiveness
this time. I think you are sorry
enough to remember in future. Doubtless you
think your papa is very strict and particular
about your mode of expressing yourself, but
some day you will thank me for it. Now go
for your walk; we have kept Annis waiting
quite long enough.â

âThank you, dear papa,â she said, holding
up her face for another kiss, âI think you are
very, very kind!â

âWhy, what kept you so long?â asked
Annis, as Elsie joined her on the veranda.
âI thought you were all ready and right behind
me.â

âPapa called me into his study; he had
something to say to me,â Elsie answered,
with a blush, and turning away her face that
Annis might not see it and the tears in her
eyes. âIâm sorry to have kept you waiting,
cousin,â she added in her own sweet, gentle
tones.

âNever mind; it doesnât signify, and I
didnât mean to complain,â Annis said with
cheerful good humor. âOh, thereâs Mr. Travilla!â
as a horseman was seen coming up the
drive. âLetâs wait and speak to him.â

They stood still looking toward him, and in
a moment he had dismounted close beside them,
and was shaking hands and asking if they and
all the family were well.

âIâll put yoâ hoss in de stable, Massa Travilla,â
said a servant, coming up and taking
the bridle from his hand.

âYes, if you please, Dick. I may perhaps
stay some little time.â

âOh, yes, sir, you must stay to tea!â Elsie
said. âYou have not been here for several
days, and we cannot let you leave us after a
call only.â

âThank you, my dear,â he returned, with a
pleased look. âYou are setting out for a
walk? I wish you would invite me to go with
you.â

âOh, we should be glad, very glad to have
you!â both answered, in a breath.

So he went with them and made himself very
entertaining, telling them several amusing anecdotes,
and giving them various items of useful
information.

When they returned to the house Mr. Dinsmore
met them on the veranda, shook hands
with his friend, and stood talking with him for
several minutes.

While her father was thus engaged Elsie drew
quietly near his side, and taking unobserved
possession of his hand carried it to her lips.

He paused an instant in his talk, bent down
and kissed her, looking with tender, loving
eyes into hers, that were half filled with repentant
tears. âMy darling!â he said softly, then
straightening himself went on with what he had
been saying, but kept her hand in a close, loving
clasp.

âYou will, of course, stay and take supper
with us, Travilla?â he said, leading the way
into the house, still with Elsieâs hand in his.

âAnd oh, Mr. Travilla!â exclaimed Annis,
âdonât you want to see our party dresses?
Theyâre finished, and are just the loveliest
things that ever you saw!â

âYes,â he said, âI am much interested
in the appearance you two little ladies are to
make at the party.â

So he was taken directly to Elsieâs dressing-room,
where the dresses were exhibited to his
admiring eyes.

Mr. Travilla stayed until very nearly Elsieâs
bed-time, and Mildred and the others lingered
a little after he was gone, so that the little
girl began to fear she would miss the usual
private bit of chat with her father; and she
was particularly anxious for it to-night, for her
tender little heart was still sore at thought of
his words, âI am not pleased with you.â

But at last she was left alone with him, even
Rose having disappeared from the room in response
to a call from the nursery.

The instant the door closed on the last of
them, Mr. Dinsmore turned to his child with
outstretched hand and a kind, fatherly smile,
saying, âCome, daughter dear! we have not
many minutes left before it will be time for
you to go to bed.â

âPapa, O papa!â she said, hastening to him
and hiding her face on his breast, âare you
quite, quite pleased with me now?â

âYes, darling, your fault is entirely forgiven,
and now let it be forgotten. I think it
will not be repeated, and I am glad to be able
to say it is a rare thing for my little girl to
be guilty of the slightest act of disobedience.
You havenât told me about your afternoonâs
walk. Was it pleasant?â

âOh, very nice!â she replied, lifting her
head to wipe away her tears, and give him a
grateful, loving look. âMr. Travilla was with
us and told us such nice stories. He is almost
as entertaining and instructive in conversation
as you yourself, papa.â

âAlmost!â he said, laughing. âWell, I
can swallow the flattery, because of the large
admixture of filial love in it.â

âIs it flattery when we are perfectly sincere,
papa?â she asked.

âNot gross flattery,â he said, ânot meant
as such at all in this case, I am sure; love makes
my little girl see her father through rose-colored
glasses.â

âBut donât you like it?â she asked naÃ¯vely.

âYes; I must confess I do,â he returned,
with a look of amusement.

Annis was with Mildred, talking about the
coming party. It would be quite an event in
the childâs life, and though very unwilling to
miss it, she felt some shrinking and timidity at
the prospect of meeting so many strange people
in a strange place.

âIâm afraid I wonât behave right, Milly,â
she said, a little anxiously. âI wish you could
tell me just how.â

âForget yourself, dear, and think only how
to add to the enjoyment of others. Be modest
and retiring—​though I need hardly tell you that—​but
donât be troubled with the idea that
people are watching you; they will have something
else to attend to, and a little girl like you
is not likely to be noticed in so large a company.â

âThatâs nice!â Annis remarked with satisfaction.
âI think it will be fun to watch the
doings of the grown-up folks and listen to their
talk, without anybody taking notice of it—​it
will be almost as good as being invisible.â

âAh, donât be too sure of a great deal of
fun to be gained in that way; some of the talk
at such gatherings is apt to be too insipid to
be worth hearing; if nothing worse.â

âMilly, I donât believe you care much for
parties,â Annis said, half in wonder and surprise,
half inquiringly.

âNo; I did once, but got my fill of them
long ago; quiet home pleasures with those I
love and who love me are now far more to my
taste. Still we owe something to neighbors and
friends outside of our family, and one must not
give up society altogether.â

âYouâve made me feel more comfortable
about going,â remarked Annis.

âWhy, I thought you were quite desirous to
go! quite pleased with the prospect!â Mildred
returned in surprise.

âYes, I did want to go, and yet I felt half
frightened at the thought of seeing so many
grand ladies and gentlemen all together. I was
afraid I shouldnât behave right at all. Itâs very
comfortable to think I can look at them and
hardly be seen myself.â

âYou would not like to think your dress
would miss being seen?â Mildred said, playfully.

âNo, indeed! it is so pretty.â

âI wish mother could see you in it!â

âYes; and you in yours, Milly,â glancing
at a beautiful evening-dress that had just come
from the mantuamakerâs. âI wonder what they
are doing at home!â

âProbably getting ready for bed; Fan at
least. I think she would not envy you your
dress if it must be worn by its possessor to a
large party.â

âNo, sheâs so bashful; poor dear Fan!â

âNow, daughter,â Mr. Dinsmore said as
they left the dinner-table on the all-important
day, âI want you to go and lie down; sleep
all the afternoon if you can. And I should
advise Annis to do the same.â

Elsie obeyed of course, Annis followed his
advice, and both felt very fresh and bright when
the time came for them to be arrayed for the
party.

Aunt Chloe undertook the dressing of both,
âso dat Miss Mildred neednât hab no botheration
âbout it,â and found no difficulty in accomplishing
her task to the entire satisfaction
of all concerned.

The two were dressed exactly alike except
that Elsie wore a white sash and Annis a blue
one.

When the last finishing touch had been given,
they went into the library to show themselves
to Mr. Dinsmore.

âAre you satisfied with us, papa?â Elsie
asked, as they presented themselves before him.

âPerfectly,â he said, glancing from one to
the other with a pleased smile, then bestowing
a kiss upon each. âI hope you may enjoy
yourselves very much indeed.â

âThank you, sir! And now Iâm going up
to Mildred,â Annis said, running gayly from
the room.

Elsie looked wistfully at her father. âYou
are all ready, papa, arenât you?â

âYes,â he said, drawing her to his knee,
âand as it will be far past your usual bedtime
when we come home to-night, we must have
our good time together now. Did you take
your nap?â

âOh, yes, sir, mammy says I slept more
than two hours.â

âThat is well; I could hardly have consented
to let you go on any other condition, because
you are not strong enough to bear much loss of
sleep. It is quite possible I may not be near
you in the refreshment-room at Pinegrove, so I
tell you now that you are not to eat any rich
cake or preserves, or any salad.â

Elsie laughed. âWhy, papa,â she said, giving
him a hug, âyou never let me eat such
things at any time!â

âNo, that is true, and yet I thought it as
well to remind you lest you should be tempted
to yield to hospitable urgency.â

âPapa, I would not dis—​â But a sudden
recollection made her pause and drop her eyes,
while a crimson tide swept over the fair face
and neck.

âI have not a doubt that my dear little girl
fully intends to be perfectly obedient,â he said
kindly, lifting the sweet, downcast face and
pressing a kiss upon the ruby lips.

At that instant the door opened and Rose
entered in full evening-dress.

âWill I do, my dear?â she asked; âdoes
your wifeâs attire meet your approval?â

âI am altogether satisfied with both it and
her,â was the gallant rejoinder. âAre the
others ready?â

It was Annis, just coming in at the door,
who answered. âMilly says they will be down
in five or ten minutes, Cousin Horace. Elsie,
shaânât we go and put on our wraps?â

Mrs. Dinsmore was hurrying away. Her
husband called after her. âMy dear, wrap up
well; for the night is cold. I have ordered the
two close carriages, but wraps will not come
amiss.â Then taking Elsieâs hand, he went
with her and Annis to their rooms to see that
they were warmly clad for the ride.

âWeâll have plenty of room in two carriages,
wonât we?â Annis said, as they all gathered
in the entrance hall.

âYes; room enough to avoid crushing the
ladiesâ dresses I trust,â replied Mr. Dinsmore.
âCome, Mildred, you, Annis and the doctor
step into this one, and my wife, my daughter
and I will take the other.â

On reaching Pinegrove they found the house
ablaze with lights and many of the guests already
arrived. The ladies were shown to a dressing-room
where a servant-woman was in waiting,
to help them off with their cloaks and perform
any other needed service.

Rose and Mildred here showed themselves
not a whit less solicitous about the appearance
of the two little girls than in regard to their
own. Sashes and stray ringlets were readjusted
and each trim little figure subjected to a careful
scrutiny to make certain that the best effect
was secured, ere they descended to the reception-rooms.

The young people were in a parlor by themselves,
and thither Annis and Elsie were conducted
by one servant, while another showed
the ladies and gentlemen into the drawing-room,
announcing them by name.

The host and hostess came forward to meet
them with cordial greeting, then Mildred, with
an emotion of pleasure, found herself beside
Mrs. Travilla; she was sure now that the evening
would pass pleasantly to her.

There were also many other intelligent,
agreeable people present, and the room was soon
full of the hum of many voices conversing in
tones more or less subdued.

Mr. Travilla sauntered round the room chatting
with one and another of his many friends
and acquaintances, then passed into that appropriated
to the children. They seemed to be
very merry. His entrance was greeted with
applause from the boys and looks of delight on
the part of the girls; for he was a general
favorite.

âWill you allow me to take this vacant seat
by your side, little lady?â he asked, addressing
Elsie.

âOh, yes, indeed, sir! I shall be happy to
have you do so,â she returned, looking up into
his face with one of her sweetest smiles.

âWhat is the game?â he asked. âMay I
take part in it?â

âItâs consequences, and weâre having fine
fun. Of course weâll be glad to have you join
us, sir,â answered several voices.

So he stayed and took part in that and several
succeeding games, apparently enjoying the
sport as thoroughly as the youngest of them
all.

When the time came for the refreshments to
be served, he conducted Elsie and Annis to the
supper-room and waited upon them there.

Elsie was glad her father happened to be so
near at hand as to be able to tell her what she
might eat; and Annis was wise enough to follow
her cousinâs example in avoiding rich and
indigestible food.

Their party were among the first to leave,
yet it was so late that the two mothers felt
anxious about their babes, and the little girls
were conscious of fatigue; Elsie especially so.

Her father perceived it with concern as she
came down from the dressing-room and he
caught sight of the pale, tired little face half
concealed by her hood.

He handed Rose to the carriage, then lifted
Elsie tenderly and placed her in it, seated himself
by her side, and took her in his arms.

âThere, darling, lay your head down on
fatherâs shoulder,â he said. âYou must go
to bed as soon as we get home, and lie there as
long as you like to-morrow morning. There
shall be no lessons; nothing to prevent my
tired little girl from taking all the rest she
needs.â

âPapa, youâre so good to me!â she murmured,
dropping asleep almost before the words
had fairly left her lips.

CHAPTER
XIX.

âDear as the vital warmth that feeds my life;

Dear as these eyes that weep in fondness oâer thee.â

—​
Thomas Otway.

â
She
is very weary, poor darling!â Rose
said softly.

âYes,â her husband answered in the same
low tones. âShe is perfectly healthy I think,
but not of a vigorous constitution naturally,
and has never fully recovered her strength since—​that
long and terrible illness.â

His voice was tremulous with emotion as he
referred to that time of trial—​those long-past
days so full of grief, anxiety and remorse that
their memory must ever be painful to him.

âI fear I hardly did right in allowing this
dissipation,â he went on after a momentâs
pause, âbut I thought her better able to bear
it.â

âDo not be too anxious and troubled, my
dear husband,â Rose said in a gentle, affectionate
tone, laying her hand lightly on his arm;
âI think the dear child will be quite restored
by a few hours of sound, refreshing sleep. And
I am sure she has enjoyed the evening greatly.
I caught sight of her face several times, and it
was so bright and happy! So do not reproach
yourself because you did not deny her this
pleasure.â

âMy dear wife! my sweet comforter!â he
returned. âHow is it with you, my love? are
you much fatigued?â

âOh, no! only enough so to feel that home
and bed will be enjoyable when reached. I
have had a very pleasant evening, and hope you
can say the same.â

âYes; it is pleasant to meet oneâs friends
and acquaintances in that way now and
then.â

Elsie awoke only partially when the carriage
stopped at their own door, and her father carried
her to her room in his arms.

âGet her to bed as quickly as you can, Aunt
Chloe,â he said; âand in the morning darken
the room and keep her asleep as long as possible.
Annis, my dear,â turning to her, âI
fear you too must be very tired?â

âOh, no, sir, only a little. I think I must
be a great deal stronger than Elsie.â

âIâm glad to hear it. Well, go to bed now,
and donât feel that there is the least occasion to
rise from it until you choose.â

âThatâs very kind in you, Cousin Horace,â
she said, kissing him good-night. âI daresay
I shall want a good nap in the morning.â

She withdrew to her room, wide enough awake,
and not too weary to prepare herself for bed.

Mr. Dinsmore stayed and assisted Aunt
Chloe in her labors. He could not persuade
himself to leave his darling child, until he saw
her resting comfortably on her couch. Then
he bent over her with a tender caress and a
murmured blessing.

ââThe Lord bless thee and keep thee. The
Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be
gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance
upon thee, and give thee peace.ââ

âDear papa,â she said, putting her arm
about his neck, âthat is such a sweet blessing!
doubly sweet because my father asks it of God
for me. And may he give it to you, too, dear
papa.â

She was so tired that she fell asleep again
with the last word—​âpapaâ—​still trembling
on her lips.

Mr. Dinsmoreâs first act on leaving his room
the next morning was to steal softly to Elsieâs
bedside and bend over her.

She was still sleeping, the sound, refreshing
sleep of healthful childhood; the rose had returned
to her cheek, the slightly parted lips
were ruby-red. Evidently she was none the
worse for the last nightâs fatigue, and he turned
away with a sigh of relief.

Two hours longer she slept, then awoke to
find her father standing close at her side. The
full red lips parted in the sweetest of smiles,
and the soft dark eyes lifted to his were luminous
with love and joy called forth by the fond
affection they read in his.

âGood-morning, papa!â she said in her
sweet, silvery tones. âIt is morning, isnât it?
though the light is so faint.â

âYes; I had the room partially darkened
that my tired little girl might sleep off her
fatigue.â

âThank you, sir! my dear, kind father!
May I get up now?â

âYes; or will you take your breakfast in
bed?â

âIâd rather get up and be dressed first, if
you please, papa.â

âYou are quite rested?â

âYes, sir, quite. I feel very well.â

âI am more thankful than words can express,â
he sighed, caressing her with hand and
lip. âYou seemed so completely overcome
last night that I have been haunted with the
fear that something more than fatigue ailed
you.â

âMy dear papa!â she said again, stroking
his face as he leaned over her, âmy dear, kind,
loving papa! I was only very tired, that was
all, and I didnât know I was that till just as I
was putting on my wraps to come home, Iâd
had such a nice time, but all at once, when the
fun stopped, I felt as if the strength had all
gone out of me.â

The murmur of their voices had reached
Annis, who was busy with her toilet.

âGood-morning,â she said, opening the door
a very little and peering in through the crack.

âGood-morning,â Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie
both responded. âHave you slept well? and
do you feel rested?â

âYes, thank you, I never felt better in my
life. But Iâm ashamed to have slept so late.
Do you know what time it is, Elsie?â

âNo.â

âTen oâclock.â

Annisâs tone was full of a sort of dismayed
astonishment. Elsie started up in such haste
and sprang out of bed so nimbly that her father
laughed to see her.

âNo need of such haste, darling,â he said,
ânor for you to feel troubled, Annis; we older
people have only just breakfasted. Aunt Chloe
must make haste with your toilet, Elsie, and in
the mean while breakfast shall be laid for you
and Annis in your boudoir; and when you have
satisfied your appetite you may come to me in
the study. I will leave you until then.â

It was a very delicious little breakfast the
children found awaiting them in the pretty
boudoir, and they brought to it appetites keen
enough to make it most enjoyable.

Then the one went to her father, the other to
her sister to spend the next half hour.

By that time the large, roomy family carriage
was at the door, and ladies, gentlemen and
children took a delightful drive; for the sun
shone brightly and the air was just cold enough
to be pleasant and bracing to mind and
body.

It was now the last of November, and from
this time until the beginning of the Christmas
holidays ladies and children were much occupied
with preparations for them; principally
shopping and making up pretty things as
Christmas gifts to relatives and friends.

Elsie and Annis were somewhat disposed to
neglect lessons for this more fascinating employment,
but Mr. Dinsmore would by no
means permit it; he was firm in his determination
that every task should be thoroughly well
learned each day before the fancy work might
be touched, or a shopping expedition undertaken.
Nor would he allow any curtailment of
the usual daily out-door exercise.

They occasionally ventured a slight complaint
that it was very difficult to fix their
thoughts on lessons when so greatly interested
in other things; but he was inexorable.

âIt can and must be done,â he would say,
gently but firmly, addressing his own daughter
more particularly; âthat a thing which ought
to be done is difficult, is no reason for excusing
ourselves from making the necessary effort to
do it. As I have told you before, my child,
the determined effort to concentrate your
thoughts is excellent mental discipline for
you.â

He was not very busy at this time, and spent
some hours each day—​generally those in which
the children were conning their tasks—​in reading
to his wife and Mildred, while they plied
the needle; all three in this way renewing their
acquaintance most agreeably with Shakspeare,
Wordsworth, Scott, Dickens, and other poets
and novelists.

The book in hand was generally laid aside
when the little girls joined them, but occasionally
Mr. Dinsmore read on when he thought
the passage unobjectionable even for minds so
immature as theirs. Sometimes, too, the books
were discussed in their hearing, arousing their
interest and curiosity more than their elders
realized.

Mr. Dinsmore had always strictly forbidden
novels to Elsie, telling her she should read
Scottâs, Dickensâ and others of the better class
when he considered her old enough, but not
till then.

One evening as they were all gathered in the
parlor, Dr. Landreth and Mr. Travilla being of
the party also, the talk ran for some time upon
the characters and incidents of âKenilworthâ
and âIvanhoe,â then of âBarnaby Rudge,â
âOliver Twistâ and âDavid Copperfield.â

Elsie, seated upon her fatherâs knee, listened
with growing interest. âPapa,â she whispered,
with her arm about his neck, her eyes
gazing pleadingly into his, as a pause in the
conversation gave her an opportunity, âmaynât
I read those books?â

âSome day; several years hence,â he said,
softly stroking her hair and smiling into the
beseeching eyes.

âOh, but I mean now, papa! I—â

âNo, my child,â he said, with grave decision,
âthey are not suited to your tender years.
And as you have no lack of reading matter that
is, and which interests as well as instructs you,
I think my prohibition ought not to be felt as
a very severe trial.â

Christmas fell on Tuesday that year. Elsieâs
guests were invited to come to the Oaks on
Monday, the twenty-fourth, to dinner, and to
remain until the following Saturday night. It
was her own choice not to have them there on
Sunday.

âBecause, papa,â she said, âyou know I
should find it very difficult to keep the Sabbath
day holy with a company of gay young friends
to entertain; indeed Iâm afraid I could not do
it.â

âYes, I fear so too,â he returned, âand
besides you will be, by that time, in need of
rest from the care and trouble of entertaining.â

Then remembering how ill able she was to
bear late hours, he, after a momentâs reflection,
bade her mention in each note of invitation that
the parents need not fear that their children
would be injured by loss of necessary sleep, as
early hours would be kept except on Christmas
eve, and even then their sports should not
continue later than ten oâclock.

Her extreme fatigue from the Pinegrove
party made him very glad he had taken this
precaution. No mother ever watched more
tenderly and untiringly over a childâs welfare
than he over that of this darling only daughter.
And no childish heart was ever more full of
grateful filial love than Elsieâs.

Glowing accounts, heard through the servants,
of the grand preparations going on at the
Oaks soon made Enna regret her haste in rejecting
her brotherâs invitation, and the regret
deepened as time went on, till at length she resolved
that she couldnât and wouldnât miss the
fun and the feasting in store for Elsieâs guests;
so she coaxed and wheedled her mother into
writing a note to Mrs. Rose Dinsmore saying
they might expect Enna; she would come to
dinner on Monday, and probably remain through
the week.

This note was handed Rose at the breakfast-table
on Saturday. She glanced over it,
laughed a little, then read it aloud.

Mr. Dinsmore smiled sarcastically. Elsie
sighed, and Annis looked provoked. Evidently
Enna would not be the most welcome of the
expected guests.

But it was entirely the fault of her own ill-temper
and selfishness.

âWell, daughter,â Mr. Dinsmore said
cheerily, for Elsieâs sigh, though neither loud
nor deep, had reached his ear, âdonât let this—​shall
I say unfortunate?—​turn of affairs spoil
your pleasure. It may be that Enna will show
herself in a new character. At all events we
have still two days of grace.â

âOh, yes, sir!â she responded, her face resuming
its accustomed sweet and joyous expression,
âand I think weâll enjoy our shopping
to-day. I have my list made out and I hope
weâll be able to get everything; because we
could hardly take time to go in again on Monday.â

âNo, certainly not, at least not without
tiring you too much, as you expect to have a
gay and long evening with your young guests.â

âAnd Monday morning must be devoted to
labelling presents and trimming the Christmas
tree,â remarked Rose.

âHow many are going to the city this
morning?â asked Mr. Dinsmore.

âAll except babies and servants,â answered
his wife.

âThen shall I order the family carriage to be
at the door in fifteen minutes after prayers?â

âYes, if you please; it will be best to start
as early as we can; though our shopping to-day
is not likely to be very arduous; we have
already bought everything the selection of
which would require much time and taste.â

Mr. Dinsmore remarked that he had directed
two of the servants to go into the woods that
morning to get the Christmas tree. Then he
proposed that it should be set up in a parlor not
in constant use, trimmed that evening, and the
room door locked until the proper hour of exhibition
on Monday.

âMy dear, I believe yours is the better
plan,â said Rose. âDo you not think so,
Cousin Mildred?â

âYes, decidedly so, if we do not fatigue
ourselves too much in the city to-day.â

âCan we help?â the little girls were asking.

âOh, no!â returned the older people in
chorus, âyou are to have the pleasure of the
surprise of seeing the finished work on Christmas
eve.â

âYes, there is one thing they can do,â Mr.
Dinsmore said; âlabel the presents they give
to others.â

They were well pleased with the suggestion;
indeed seemed in a mood to be pleased with
everything except the prospect of Ennaâs company
the following week, and that they resolutely
refused to contemplate.

They enjoyed their drive, their shopping,
the home-coming after it, and the good dinner
that followed; then a restful chat between
themselves and with the older people—​plans for
the entertainment and amusement of the expected
guests being the staple of discourse—​and
a romp with the babies.

A gallop about the grounds on the Shetland
ponies and the labelling of their presents filled
up the most of their time for the remainder of
the day and evening, and they went early to
bed to be ready for the full enjoyment of the
coming Lordâs day with its sacred duties and
pleasures.

CHAPTER
XX.

âHaste thee, my nymph, and bring with thee

Jest and youthful jollity,

Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles,

Nods and becks and wreathed smiles.â

—​
Miltonâs LâAllegro.

Monday
came—​clear, bright, and warm for
the season.

âAs lovely a day as we could have asked
for,â Annis said, and Elsie responded, âYes,
indeed! I think everybody will come, for no
regrets have been sent in and there is no excuse
to be found in weather or the state of the
roads.â

âI donât believe anybody is anxious for an
excuse,â said Annis. âI havenât a doubt
theyâre all glad you invited them.â

All their preparations being already made, the
children spent nearly all the morning in out-of-door
sports, making the most of the good
weather, and coming in just in time to be
dressed for dinner at as early an hour as any
of the invited guests could be expected.

They all came; both older and younger,
ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys—​excepting
Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore, of Roselands, who had
accepted a prior invitation.

It had been foreseen that in such case the
house would be so full that Elsie and Annis
would each be constrained to accept a bed-fellow,
and Annis had expressed a strong preference
for sharing Elsieâs room and bed, giving
up hers to two of the new-comers; and so it
was arranged; Carrie Howard and Lucy Carrington
being installed in Annisâs room, immediately
on their arrival.

They had scarcely taken possession when the
Roselandsâ carriage drove up and deposited
Adelaide, Walter, and Enna.

âI meant to be among the first,â Adelaide
said, as Rose hastened to meet her at the door
with a warm, sisterly greeting, âbut Enna delayed
us so with her whims and tempers that I
presume we are the very last.â

âYes, you are a few minutes behind the
Carringtons, who came after everybody else but
you; but never mind, itâs better late than
never, and you are in full time for dinner.
Come let me have the pleasure of showing you
to your room. I am sorry to have to ask you
to take Enna in with you, but we are so full
that we have no separate room to offer
her.â

âThere is no need of apology,â Adelaide returned
good-humoredly; âand I think it is a
much better plan than it would be to put her
with any one else. Come, Enna, you are to go
with me. Didnât you hear?â

âYes; but what if I donât choose to?â the
child answered, with a pout.

âIn that case you can return by the way you
came,â said Mr. Dinsmore, appearing on the
scene. âHow do you do, Adelaide?â

âVery well, thank you,â she said, moving
on down the hall with him and Rose, leaving
Enna to follow or not as she pleased.

Enna hung back, muttering that âshe
wouldnât stay to be abused and treated like a
nobody.â

âNo, donât,â said Walter teasingly, âstand
on your dignity and go home. I wish you
would; for I know weâll have a great deal
better time without you.â

âYou hateful boy! I shanât go one step!â
she exclaimed, stamping her foot at him and
rushing after Adelaide and the others.

âI say, En,â he called after her, with a
grin, âyouâd better be on your good behavior,
or Santa Claus will pass you by.â

âMarse Walter, shall I show you to yoâ
room, sah?â asked a servant who had all this
time stood respectfully waiting.

âYes, Dick; I suppose Iâd better see if Iâm
all right for dinner.â

âNow, Enna,â Adelaide said, turning to the
pouting child, as the door of their room closed
upon Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore, leaving them
alone together, âyou must behave yourself
decently or you shall go home at once, whether
you will or no.â

Enna was by no means willing to miss the
fun and gifts or the feasting which she knew
were in store for those who should share the
hospitalities of the Oaks for the next few days,
and being well aware that Adelaide was quite
capable of carrying out her threat, especially if
assisted by their Brother Horace, she reluctantly
decided to banish her ill humor and submit
quietly, if not quite pleasantly, to the arrangements
that had been made for her.

Going down to the drawing-room they found
the whole company of old and young gathered
there; and presently dinner was announced.

It was a grand affair of many courses, and
when they left the table the short winter day
was drawing to a close. There was no wine
upon the table, for the Dinsmores of the Oaks
were strictly temperate in principle and practice,
but the most fragrant and delicious coffee
was served with the last course.

After that the gentlemen who did not smoke
withdrew with the ladies to the drawing-room,
the lads went out into the grounds to amuse
themselves there until dark, and Elsie, taking
the little girls to her apartments, showed them
her baby house, with its family of dolls, a number
of other costly toys, a cabinet of curiosities,
books, and pictures. There was no lack of
material for their entertainment, and tongues
ran fast as they talked of what they were handling
and of the Christmas gifts they had received
before leaving home or expected to have
sent them to-morrow.

As Elsieâs doating father was constantly adding
to her store of pretty things, there were
some which were new even to Enna.

She regarded them with curiosity at first,
then with an envious eye; in sullen silence for
a time; but at length, in a pause of the conversation,
she remarked, âI donât think itâs
fair, Elsie, that you should have so much
more of everything nice than anybody else
has.â

âI do then!â exclaimed Carrie Howard,
âbecause sheâs so nice herself. Besides I know
that with all her blessings sheâs had her trials
too.â

âWhat?â cried Enna, snappishly.

âYou for one,â returned Carrie, laughing.

âThank you, Miss Howard, but I donât belong
to her,â snapped Enna, growing very red
and angry.

This sally was greeted with a general laugh,
which only had the effect to increase Ennaâs
anger, though Elsie did not join in it.

âDonât be vexed, Enna, they are only teasing
you a little,â she said in a gentle, persuasive
tone. âI wouldnât mind it.â

âBut I will! and I shanât stay here to be
insulted! I believe you just put them up to
it, you hateful thing!â And the angry child
marched out of the room, holding her head high,
as she had seen her mother do when similarly
affected.

Everybody felt relieved, and the gay, mirthful
chat and light, careless laugh were resumed.

Elsie alone was slightly disturbed by Ennaâs
behavior. She was somewhat abstracted for a
moment while considering the question whether
what had occurred was of such a nature that
she must report it to her father in obedience
to his command; but having decided in the
negative, she recovered her accustomed sweet
serenity and gave her whole attention to promoting
the enjoyment of her remaining guests.

âGirls,â she said presently, âwouldnât you
like to see my baby brother, and Cousin Mildredâs
little Percy?â

âOh, yes!â they all answered, Annis adding
to the stranger guests, âTheyâre both so
pretty and sweet.â

Elsie led the way to the nursery, where they
found the little fellows, each in the arms of his
mother, and in a state of mind and condition of
dress to show off to advantage.

Elsie and Annis, to say nothing of the
mothers, were very fond of both the babes, and
enjoyed the exhibition quite as much as did the
visitors.

Enna had betaken herself to the drawing-room,
and in answer to Adelaideâs query why
she had left her mates, asserted that they were
all as cross and hateful as they could be.

âAh!â returned Adelaide indifferently.
âWell, I have noticed that people are very apt
to get a return of the treatment they give.â
And with that she resumed her chat with a lady
sitting on her other side, and left Enna to
amuse herself as she best could.

The child found it dull enough sitting there,
or wandering about the room unnoticed, but
was too proud to go back to the society of those
she had left in a pet.

Herbert Carrington, Lucyâs twin brother,
was the only other child in the room just then.
He sat in a window overlooking that part of
the grounds where the other boys were sporting,
and was watching them with wistful eyes,
probably feeling the lameness which prevented
him from joining them a sore trial. But he
was a patient sufferer and very seldom uttered
a word of complaint.

Elsie, in Ennaâs place, would have gone to
him and tried to cheer and entertain him; but
the latter only looked toward him and turned
away with a face of disgust, despising the poor
lad for the physical infirmity which was not his
fault, but his sad misfortune.

But it began to grow dark; lamps were
lighted, and the boys came in.

The children were growing eager for the
opening of the doors of the room where the
Christmas tree was, and indeed some of the
older people were somewhat impatient to see
it, and to learn the nature of the fruits it bore.
All were ready to accept the invitation to do so
on leaving the tea-table.

It was a fine, large tree reaching from floor
to ceiling, with wide spreading branches almost
bending beneath the weight of glittering ornaments,
toys, candies, fruits, and many more
costly things.

When there had been sufficient time for
everybody to see and thoroughly appreciate its
present appearance, the work of distribution
began, Mr. Travilla taking down the presents,
calling aloud the name on each, and Mr. and
Mrs. Dinsmore and Adelaide handing them to
the owners.

No one—​member of the family, guest, or servant—​had
been forgotten or neglected. The
gifts had been carefully chosen to suit the circumstances
and tastes of each recipient, and
seemed to afford very general satisfaction.
Even Enna could for once find no cause or
excuse for grumbling, having received a pair of
very beautiful bracelets from Elsie; necklace,
pin, and ear-rings to match from Mr. Dinsmore
and Rose; besides some smaller gifts from other
relatives.

Fortunately she did not know that some of
Elsieâs presents—​in particular a set of pink
coral—​necklace and bracelets—​from her father,
and an opal ring from Mr. Travilla, were far
more costly than her own.

Annis thought she fared wonderfully well;
receiving a pair of gold bracelets from Elsie, a
gold chain for her neck from Mr. Dinsmore,
and a gold locket enamelled with blue forget-me-nots
from Mildred; also, a pearl ring from
Mr. Travilla, one set with a topaz from Dr.
Landreth, and a dozen beautiful handkerchiefs
from Rose.

The other gifts of jewelry were a moonstone
ring to Mildred, from her husband, and a sardonyx
from Mr. Dinsmore to Rose.

These four happening to be grouped together
with Mr. Travilla, Annis, and Elsie, Mildred
said, looking down at her new ring, which her
husband had just slipped upon her finger,
âThis is very pretty, my dear; but had you
any motive for selecting this particular kind of
stone? Precious stones are said to have a language
as well as flowers, are they not?â

âYes, and moonstone is said to protect from
harm and danger,â returned the doctor, laughingly.

âAnd sardonyx?â asked Rose.

âInsures conjugal felicity,â replied her husband,
with a fond look into her sweet face.

âO Mr. Travilla! whatâs the language of
this?—​opal is it?â asked Elsie.

âYes, my little friend, it is an opal, and is
said to denote hope and to sharpen the faith
and sight of the possessor.â

âThank you!â she exclaimed heartily, gazing
down at it with a pleased, happy face.

âAnd what is the language of pearls?â
asked Annis, looking admiringly at hers.

âPurity, and they are said to give clearness
to both physical and mental vision.â

âOh, I like that!â she said, âand I think
you were very, very kind to give it to me.â

Elsie had stolen close to her fatherâs side and
slipped one hand into his.

He bent down to look smilingly into her eyes
and give her a gentle kiss.

âPapa,â she said softly, âthank you very
much for your lovely present.â

âWelcome, my darling, and many thanks to
you for my beautiful present from you.â

It was a small but very fine painting by one
of the old masters. She had given a beautiful
lace set—​collar and under-sleeves—​to her
mamma and one to Mildred.

The presents having all been distributed, the
ladies and gentlemen adjourned to the drawing-room,
leaving the children in possession of the
parlor where the tree stood.

âLetâs play games!â cried a chorus of
voices in which several boyish ones were conspicuous.

Elsie asked what they would have, suggesting
a number of the quieter kind; but none of
those seemed to suit; evidently the majority at
least were in a romping mood.

âHot—​butter—​beans,â proposed Walter;
âthatâs good fun and neednât be so very noisy
either.â

No dissenting voices being raised, Elsie
asked, âWhat shall we hide?â

âHereâs a mouse made of gray canton
flannel,â said Annis, taking it from where it
lay at the foot of the tree. âI should think
that it would do very well.â

âYes; and as you have it in your hand, you
will hide it first.â

âYes, if nobody else wants to. Now all
cover your eyes, please, and donât look till I
say, âHot—​butter—​beans! please to come to
supper.ââ

The game was continued for some time with
the understanding that the hiding must be done
in that room; then as the good places seemed
to have all been used, they took in the next
room and the spacious entrance hall beyond.

At length Elsie was the finder, and it became
her turn to hide the mouse. With it in her
hand she stole softly into the hall and glanced
around from floor to ceiling.

It was a very large and handsome apartment,
the ceiling lofty, the floor of tessellated marble,
the walls frescoed and adorned with two or three
fine paintings and several pieces of choice
statuary.

Glancing up at one of those last, occupying a
niche several feet above the floor, the child
thought what a good hiding-place for the mouse
might be made of that niche; she could surely
slip the little thing in behind the feet of the
statue, where it could not be seen, and who
would ever think of looking for it there?

She was not tall enough to reach up to the
place while standing on the floor, but softly
moved a chair near and stepped upon it.

Even then she could not reach easily, not
without standing on the edge of the chair, and
just as she seemed to have attained her object
it slipped from under her; she caught wildly at
the statue to save herself from falling, and she
and it came down together with a terrible
crash, upon the marble floor.

CHAPTER
XXI.

âAt Christmas play, and make good cheer,

For Christmas comes but once a year.â

—​
Tusser.

The
whole house was aroused and terrified
by the sudden crashing sound, succeeded by
perfect stillness, and members of the family,
guests, and servants came rushing into the hall,
most of them in wild excitement, not knowing
but the next thing might be the falling in of
the roof, or the tumbling of the walls about
their ears.

Mr. Dinsmore, who happened to be standing
close by the drawing-room door at that end of
the hall, was the foremost of the crowd, and saw
with a thrill of terror and despair his darling
only daughter lying apparently insensible upon
the floor, killed as he thought by the crushing
weight of the statue, which seemed to rest upon
her prostrate form.

In an instant he was at her side, his terror
somewhat abated as he perceived that it had
missed her, though by but a hairâs breadth, and
that she was making an effort to rise.

âMy child! my darling!â he said tremulously,
stooping over her and gently raising her
in his arms, âare you much hurt?â

âNo, papa; not much I think,â she murmured
faintly, for the fall had partially stunned
her, âbut O papa, Iâve broken your lovely
statue, and Iâm so sorry!â

âNever mind that; what do I care for it in
comparison with you!â he said almost indignantly,
making his way through the crowd of
frightened, anxious guests and servants.

âIs she much hurt?â

âHow did it happen?â

âHow did she come to fall?â everybody was
asking of her father or of each other, as they
fell back from the drawing-room door to let
him enter.

He did not seem to hear or heed them: his
attention was wholly occupied with her.

âAm I giving you pain?â he asked in tenderest
tones.

âVery little,â she answered, and her voice
sounded quite natural now.

He sat down with her on a sofa, Rose, Mildred,
Dr. Landreth, and Mr. Travilla gathering
round.

âWhere are you hurt, dear child?â the
doctor asked.

âOnly my knee, sir, and I donât think itâs
more than bruised,â she said, looking up into
his face with a faint smile, âand Iâm ashamed
to have frightened you all so.â

But her head dropped on her fatherâs shoulder
as she spoke and she grew deathly pale.

Her fatherâs face reflected the pallor of
hers as the thought darted into his mind
that she might have received some internal
injury.

âShe is faint from the shock to her nervous
system,â the doctor said. âBetter carry her
to her room and lay her on her bed.â

The advice was followed at once, her father
lifting her again in his arms and carrying her
as gently and tenderly as possible, the doctor
and Rose following at his request.

The last named soon returned to the drawing-room,
where the guests were waiting in
almost silent expectancy, with the good news
that the doctor found no serious injury, the
shock of the fall and a few not very bad bruises
were all he could discover. He thought she
would be about again next day.

Rose added that Mr. Dinsmore wished to be
excused for a short season, and hoped they
would enjoy themselves as if nothing had happened
to disturb them.

âI should have her put to bed at once and
get to sleep as soon as possible,â Dr. Landreth
said as he left Elsieâs room.

âYes, it shall be done,â Mr. Dinsmore
answered. âAunt Chloe, undress her immediately.
I will help you. There, put these
away carefully,â handing her the necklace and
bracelets he just unclasped from his daughterâs
neck and arms. Then to Elsie, âKeep as
quiet as you can, dearest, and let papa and
mammy do it all.â

âDear papa, you seem to have no reproof at
all for me!â she said, looking lovingly into his
eyes.

âThat can wait till to-morrow,â he
answered with playful look and tone. âI am
sorry for my little pet that her Christmas eve
should be so spoiled for her,â he added presently,
giving her a tender caress.

âBut it was my own fault, papa, and Iâm
afraid Iâve spoiled yours and other peopleâs
too.â

âWell, well, accidents will happen; and you
shall tell me all about it to-morrow if you feel
equal to the task. Now I shall sit beside you
until you go to sleep.â

âHow nice, dear papa!â she exclaimed, âit
more than pays for my slight hurts and my
fright, for oh, I was frightened when I felt
myself falling.â

âThere! donât talk about it any more to-night,â
he said, holding her close to his heart
for an instant, then laying her in her bed.

âPapa,â she asked, âmust I say my prayers
in bed?â

âFor to-night I think you must; and they
need not be very long; we are not heard for our
much speaking.â

It was not long ere she slept; until then he
sat beside the bed, holding her hand in his and
singing softly one of her favorite hymns.

Then enjoining it upon the old nurse to
watch her carefully, and if she woke and seemed
in pain to send at once for him, he returned to
his guests.

He wanted her without a bed-fellow that
night that he might feel free to go to her when
he would, so Annis occupied a couch in Mildredâs
dressing-room.

Elsie was still sleeping sweetly when her
father came in and stood by her bed the last
thing before seeking his own, and he always
found her so when he stole softly in again two
or three times during the night.

She woke at her usual hour in the morning,
and hearing him moving quietly about in the
next room, called softly to him, âMerry
Christmas, dear papa.â

âAh, my darling! a merry Christmas and
happy New Year to you!â he responded, coming
quickly to her side. âYou are looking
very bright,â he added joyously, bending down
to kiss forehead, lips, cheeks, and eyes. âDo
you feel no ill effects from your fall?â

âNo, sir. May I get up now, and come to
you in the study when I am dressed?â

âYes; if you feel quite able. Aunt Chloe,â
as the old nurse came in, âbring Miss Elsie a
glass of good, rich iced milk and let her drink
it before she rises.â

âYes, sah, Iâse do dat berry ting,â returned
Aunt Chloe. âHow is you, honey?
well ânuff to get out ob bed dis Christmas
morninâ?â

âYes, mammy; but why donât you catch
me? arenât you afraid youâll miss your Christmas
gift?â

âYah, yah, chile! not a bit! âspect youâs
got it all ready anâ couldnât keep it from
your ole mammy ef you tried. Now Iâse off
after dat milk. But fust I hopes, darlinâ,
youâll hab de merriest of Christmases and de
happiest New Year de good Lord eber give
you.â

âThank you, dear old mammy; and may
you have the same,â Elsie responded, looking
affectionately after her nurse as she hurried
from the room.

Her father stayed with her till he had seen
her drain the glass of sweet rich milk which
Aunt Chloe brought, then left her to be dressed.

Going through the hall on the way to his
study, he passed the scene of last nightâs accident.
The statue had been replaced in its
niche by the servants, but it was a wreck, the
nose crushed, an arm and a foot broken.

He had valued it in the past, but his only
emotion as he glanced at it now was one of
heartfelt thankfulness that it had fallen beside
rather than upon his child.

Half an hour later she came to him looking
so bright and happy, so sweet and fair, that his
pulses bounded with joy at the sight.

She ran into his outstretched arms, put hers
about his neck and pressed her sweet lips to his
again and again. âDear, dear papa, how I
love you!â she said, laying her soft cheek to
his. âI do believe almost any other father
would have scolded and punished me too, last
night.â

âNot a father who loved you as I do. But
how did it all happen? I cannot think what
you could have been doing there.â

Then she told him all about it, adding, âI
saw the statue just now and it is quite ruined.
O papa, I am so sorry!â

âNever mind that; if this accident teaches
you a lesson on the folly and danger of climbing
up and reaching in that way—​such a lesson
that you will never try it again—​I shall not
mourn over the loss; but consider your safety
cheaply purchased by it. But do you know
what you have brought on yourself by this
escapade?â

âWhat, papa?â she asked with a startled
look up into his face. His tone was so grave it
half frightened her.

âYour fatherâs presence with you and your
mates whenever there is any romping game to
be played.â

âOh,â she cried, clapping her hands, âthat
will be
so
nice! And will you join us in the
games?â

âPerhaps. Now let us have our reading. I
have chosen the sweet story of our Saviourâs
birth and the visit of the angels to the shepherds,
as the most appropriate to the day.â

âYes, papa, surely it is,â she said, a sweet,
tender gravity overspreading her lovely countenance,
while the soft eyes were luminous with
love and joy. âI have been thinking of it all
the morning, and thanking God in my heart for
the gift of his dear Son. And this is my verse
for to-day: âGod so loved the world, that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life.â O papa, isnât that a
sweet, sweet verse? and wasnât it wonderful
love?â

A little before the breakfast hour Mr. Dinsmore
and Elsie went to the drawing-room, where
they found Rose, Mildred, and Annis.

No one else was there at the moment, though
very soon Dr. Landreth and Mr. Travilla came
in; then one guest after another until nearly
all were present.

The two ladies and Annis embraced Elsie in
turn, saying how glad they were to see her
looking so well in spite of her accident, and
how alarmed about her they had been.

âAre you quite sure that you feel none the
worse for it?â asked Rose.

âNo, mamma; I am so very sorry to have
broken that lovely statue.â

âIt is a pity,â Rose said with a slight smile,
âbut I am sure your papa does not want you
to grieve in the very least over it, and my query
referred altogether to bodily injury.â

âPlease excuse me, mamma,â Elsie said,
âIâm afraid my misunderstanding was partly
wilful. I have a few bruises, but they scarcely
hurt me unless they are touched.â

Inquiries, condolences, and Christmas greetings
and good wishes were showered upon her
as the other visitors gathered in, until at length
Enna remarked with a disdainful toss of the
head, âDear me! Elsie, what a fuss everybody
does make over you, just because you had a
trifling accident—​a fall off a chair!â

âA fall off a chair, Miss Enna,â said Mr.
Travilla, âhas sometimes proved a very serious
affair; and if that statue had fallen on instead
of alongside of our little friend, it would without
doubt have broken some of her bones, if
nothing worse.â

âIâm glad it didnât then; âtwould have
spoiled all our fun, for of course Horace would
have sent us all home at once.â

âWell, Enna, one thing can be said in your
praise—​that you are no hypocrite,â exclaimed
Carrie Howard, with a scornful curl of the lip,
âif you
are
utterly heartless, you donât try to
hide it with a pretence of sensibility and kindness.â

âYou are well answered and reproved for
once, Enna,â remarked Mr. Dinsmore with
grave displeasure and disgust.

The morning was so fine that the family and
guests spent the greater part of it in the open
air, riding, driving, or walking. Elsie generously
gave up her phaeton to Carrie and Lucy—​the
other little girls to take their turn afterward—​the
larger ponies to the boys; but her
father and Mr. Travilla drove her and Annis
out in the carriage of the latter.

There was a great deal of candy about, every
one having received a box of it when the gifts
were distributed, and some of the little people
ate so much that evening and on getting up in
the morning that they brought little appetite to
their breakfast; but Elsie had not yet tasted it.

âWhat is that?â her father asked, seeing a
paper parcel in her hand as she came out to
take her drive.

âMy box of candy, papa. I thought it
would be nice to hand round to you all, and
perhaps you would let me eat some too. I
havenât had any at all yet.â

âYes,â he said, handing her into the carriage,
âyou may eat a little now, and shall have
a larger quantity after dinner.â

âCousin Horace,â remarked Annis, who
was already seated in the carriage, âI do think
Elsie is the best girl in the world! I donât believe
I could have resisted the temptation to
taste a little candy, when everybody around me
was eating it, as she did last night.â

âYes,â he said, looking fondly at his little
girl, âshe is a good, obedient child.â

Elsieâs face flushed with pleasure at his words
and her eyes sparkled.

Of course there was a grand Christmas dinner
at the Oaks, where, in addition to a great variety
of toothsome viands, there was âthe feast of
reason and the flow of soul.â

Innocent pleasures were provided in abundance
for the afternoon and evening of that day
and all the others to the end of the week; intellectual
conversation, music of a high order,
tableaux vivans, acting of charades, and others
too numerous to mention.

There was very little jarring among the participants,
old or young. Enna behaved uncommonly
well, probably because either Mr. Dinsmore
or Mr. Travilla was almost always present;
often both were; and in their occasional
absences, Rose, Adelaide, or Mildred was sure to
be near enough to see and hear all that went
on.

Thus Elsie was secured from ill-usage and
from being burdened with the responsibility of
providing amusement for her guests.

Both she and Annis enjoyed the week greatly,
yet felt a sense of relief when on Saturday
evening the last of their guests had departed,
leaving them to the full enjoyment of each
otherâs society and that of the usual quiet home
circle. The older guests had gone too, with
the exception of Adelaide and Mr. and Mrs.
Travilla, but they seemed almost to belong to
the family.

CHAPTER
XXII.

âHow firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,

Is laid for your faith in his excellent word!

What more can he say than to you he hath said,

You who unto Jesus for refuge hath fled.â

—​
Kirkham.

â
The
last Sunday of the old year!â Mrs
Travilla said in a low, meditative tone, more as
if thinking aloud than addressing her companions.

It was evening and all the family at the Oaks
were gathered about the fire in the parlor usually
occupied by them when alone. It was not
so large as the drawing-room and seemed cosier
for a small company.

âYes, a solemn thought,â said Rose; âthe
last Sunday and the last hours of the old year
seem most appropriate seasons for a glance
backward at the path we have already trod, and
forward over that which still lies before.â

âYes, looking back to see wherein we have
stepped aside out of the strait and narrow way
that leads to eternal life, and forward with the
resolve that with Godâs help we will walk more
steadily in it; that we will run in the way of
his commandments.â It was Mildred who
spoke.

âAnd not at our shortcomings only,â resumed
the old lady, âbut also at Godâs great
mercies in the past and all his great and precious
promises for the future. âLo, I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the world.â
âI will never leave thee nor forsake thee.â
âAnd even to your old age I am he, and even
to hoar hairs I will carry you.â âThis God is
our God forever and ever, he will be our guide
even unto death.â

âI want to testify to you all to-night that in
a life of threescore and ten I have found him
ever faithful to his promises; goodness and
mercy have followed me all the days of my life
thus far, and shall surely do so to the very end.

âI have not been without trials—​many and
sometimes very sore; having seen the grave
close over a beloved husband and five dear children—​but
he has sustained me under them all.
Oh, it is in the darkest hours the star of his
wondrous love shines forth in its greatest power
and splendor, and we learn the sweetness of
resting wholly upon him! As my days, so has
my strength been; because the eternal God was
my refuge, and underneath were the everlasting
arms.â

âAh!â said Mildred, breaking the silence
that had fallen upon them with the last words
of her dear old friend, âall we want to make
us supremely happy is faith enough to believe
every word our Master says, to trust him fully
with both our temporal and spiritual interests,
and to keep all his sweet commands.â

âSuch as what, love?â asked her husband
softly, sitting close by her side.

âI was thinking of the opening verses of the
forty-third chapter of Isaiah,â she answered.
âIn the first and second verses he says, âO
Israel, fear not; for I have redeemed thee; I
have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.
When thou passest through the waters, I will
be with thee; and through the rivers, they
shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned,
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.â

âAnd again in the fifth, âFear not, for I
am with thee.â Could we miss being happy if
we fully obeyed so much as this one command,
âFear not,â and fully believed and trusted in
these precious promises?â

âI think not,â said Mr. Dinsmore, âand
what right have we to disobey in being afraid
of anything—​loss, accident, sickness, death, the
enmity and malice of temporal or spiritual
foes?—​when he bids us fear not! And again
he says, âBe careful for nothing.â âTake no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or
what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on.ââ

He paused, and Mrs. Travilla added another
quotation.

ââBut seek ye first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness, and all these things shall be
added unto you.ââ

âAnd,â said Rose, âPaul tells us, âGodliness
is profitable unto all things, having
promise of the life that now is, and of that
which is to come.ââ

âPapa,â said Elsie, âmaynât we see how
many of these little commandments we can remember?â

âShall we?â he asked, glancing around the
little circle.

All agreed that it would be a pleasant and
profitable exercise, and Mrs. Travilla, as the
oldest person present, began, the others following
as a text occurred to them.

ââMy son, give me thy heart.ââ

ââCome unto me,â the word of Jesus,â Rose
said, âand he bids us bring to him others
who have need of healing; âBring him hither
to me,â he said of the boy who had a dumb
and deaf spirit. âLet him that heareth say
come.ââ

âAnd having come,â said Mildred, âwe are
to be strong in the Lord and in the power of
his might, and to grow in grace and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.â

ââCasting all your care upon him, for he careth
for you,ââ was the doctorâs text.

Then Mr. Travilla: ââNot slothful in business;
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.ââ

Mr. Dinsmoreâs: ââRejoicing in hope;
patient in tribulation; continuing instant in
prayer.ââ

Elsieâs: ââA new commandment I give unto
you, that ye love one another: as I have loved
you, that ye also love one another.ââ

Annis repeated: ââLove as brethren, be pitiful,
be courteous.ââ

Adelaide: ââIn lowliness of mind let each
esteem other better than themselves.ââ

Then it went round again.

ââLet patience have her perfect work.ââ

ââSet your affection on things above, not
on things on the earth.ââ

ââLet your conversation be without covetousness,
and be content with such things as ye
have.ââ

ââBe not forgetful to entertain strangers.ââ

ââUse hospitality one to another without
grudging.ââ

ââAs we have there opportunity, left us do
good unto all men, especially unto them who are
of the household of faith.ââ

ââChildren, obey your parents in the Lord:
for this is right. Honor thy father and mother.ââ
This came from Elsieâs sweet lips,
and as she repeated the command her arm crept
lovingly around her fatherâs neck; for she was,
as usual, close at his side.

ââFight the good fight of faith, lay hold on
eternal life,ââ Annis repeated.

Then Mrs. Travilla: ââLet us run with patience
the race that is set before us.ââ

Rose: ââIn everything give thanks.ââ

Mildred: ââYe believe in God, believe also
in me.ââ

Dr. Landreth: ââBear ye one anotherâs
burdens.ââ

Mr. Travilla: ââRejoice with them that do
rejoice, and weep with them that weep.ââ

Adelaide: ââComfort ye, comfort ye, my
people, saith your God.ââ

Mr. Dinsmore: ââProvide things honest in
the sight of all men.ââ

Dr. Landreth: ââEvery man shall bear his
own burden.ââ

A slight pause followed the last text, and
then Mrs. Travilla broke the silence.

âIn all these and many more we learn his
will concerning us,â she said, âand he tells us
âIf ye love me, keep my commandments.â
âHe that hath my commandments and keepeth
them, he it is that loveth me.â Obedience—​to
a parent, and God is our Father; to a Master,
and Jesus is our Lord and Master—​is the
test of love.

ââWe love him because he first loved usâ;
and obey him not that we may be saved, but
because we are saved.

ââVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that
heareth my word, and believeth on him that
sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
come into condemnation; but is passed from
death unto life.â

ââLooking unto Jesusâ—​trusting in him
alone for salvation, trying to be like him, and to
know, to do, and suffer all his holy will—​this is
what it is to be a Christian; a follower of God—​not
as a slave—​but as a dear child. âBe ye
therefore followers of God as dear children.ââ

âWhosoever shall do the will of God, the
same is my brother, and my sister and mother,â
read Mr. Dinsmore from his open Bible.

âLet us search out something more in regard
to that will.â

âPlease read the fourth and fifth verses of
the first chapter of Ephesians,â said Mrs. Travilla.

He turned to it and read: âAccording as he
hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
the world, that we should be holy and without
blame before him in love: Having predestinated
us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure
of his will.â

âWhat a blessed will!â she commented—​âto
predestinate us to the adoption of children!—​us!
rebels against his authority, enemies
by wicked works. And then it was his will to
give his only begotten and well-beloved Son to
die that we might live. He said, âLo, I come
to do thy will, O God.ââ

ââAnd this is the will of God, even your
sanctification,ââ quoted Mildred. âWhat
Christian heart but must rejoice in that!â

Then Rose read: ââAnd this is the fatherâs
will which hath sent me, that of all which he
hath given me I should lose nothing, but
should raise it up again at the last day. And
this is the will of him that sent me, that every
one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him,
may have everlasting life: and I will raise him
up at the last day.â Oh!â she exclaimed,
âshall we not rejoice in his will?â

Mr. Travillaâs Bible lay open before him.
âHere,â he said, âin second Peter, third
chapter and ninth verse, we read, âThe Lord is
not slack concerning his promise, as some men
count slackness, but is long suffering to us-ward,
not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance.ââ

Then turning to Ezekiel, eighteenth chapter,
ââCast away from you all your transgressions,
whereby ye have transgressed, and make you
a new heart and a new spirit, for why will ye
die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure
in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord
God: wherefore turn yourselves and live ye.ââ

CHAPTER
XXIII.

âWhen I am filled with sore distress

For some surprising sin,

Iâll plead thy perfect righteousness

And mention none but thine.â

—​
Watts.

The
next day the little party at the Oaks
was greatly reduced in size, Mr. Travilla and
his mother having gone to their own home; the
doctor, Mildred, and Annis to pay a visit of a
week to some relative of his living in the
next county; so that Adelaide was the only remaining
guest.

Elsie missed Annis very much; especially
when alone in her own apartments; therefore,
spent most of her time with Rose and Adelaide,
or in her papaâs study. She liked to be with him
better than anywhere else, even when he was
too busy to notice her, and must not be spoken
to; and he was always pleased to have her by
his side. She had the freedom of his study,
too, whether he were there or not.

Regular lessons were not to go on during
Annisâs absence; but Elsie read history with
her father for an hour every morning, and spent
another over her music and drawing.

On Monday, the last day of the old year, as
she sat on his knee, after their early morning
reading and prayer together, he told her that
âto-morrow evening—​New Yearâs night,â the
Carletons were to give a large party, similar to
the one they had attended at Pinegrove. âAnd
we are all invited to it,â he added.

Her face flushed with pleasure. âWill you
let me go, papa?â she asked, and he read in
her eyes that she was very desirous to do so.

âI have something to say to you before I
answer that question,â he said, softly stroking
her hair, and looking with grave tenderness
into the beseeching eyes. âYou are not very
strong, and bore the fatigue of the Pinegrove
party so ill, that I fear the effect upon your
health if I should allow you to attend another.

âHealth is one of Godâs good gifts, and as
such we have no right to throw it away simply
for our own pleasure. It is a Christian duty to
take care of it; because we can serve God better
with strong, healthy bodies, than with feeble,
sickly ones. The Bible bids us, âWhether
therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do,
do all to the glory of God.â Do you think, my
child, that you can obey this command in going
to the party, when you know it is likely to injure
your health?â

âIâm afraid not, papa,â she answered, in a
low, reluctant tone.

âVery well; I leave it to your own conscience;
you shall decide for yourself, whether
you will go or stay.â

âThen, I shall stay, papa, because you have
made it plain to me that I ought. But,â she
sighed, âit will seem very lonesome while you
and mamma are gone.â

âNo; we will not go early, and I shall see
you safe in your bed before starting.â

âThen, I shall not care so much,â she said.
âI am pretty sure to go to sleep as soon as my
head touches the pillow. Papa, are we to have
any company to-morrow?â

âNone, by invitation; the house has been so
full for some time past, that your mamma and I
feel that it will be pleasant to take our New
Yearâs dinner with only our own little family;
for we hardly consider your aunt Adelaide as
other than one of ourselves.â

âI think it will be nice,â she said, with satisfaction;
âthough Iâd be glad if we could have
Cousin Milly, and the doctor, and Annis.â

âSo should I,â he responded; âthey have
come to seem a part of our family.â

So New Yearâs day passed very quietly at
the Oaks, yet very pleasantly too. Elsie received
some handsome presents from her papa,
Rose, Adelaide, and Mr. Travilla. She enjoyed
that, and also presenting the gifts she had prepared
for them.

Her father rode out with her shortly after
breakfast, and on their return they found Mr.
Travilla in the drawing-room making his New
Yearâs call. There were several other gentlemen
doing the same, and indeed there was
quite a stream of callers all the morning.

Refreshments were offered to all—​cake,
candies, fruits, lemonade, and hot coffee—​all of
the finest—​but no wine or other intoxicating
beverage.

Elsie was allowed a little cake, a little candy,
and as much fruit and lemonade as she wished.
She was well content with these, and the
pleasure of listening to the talk and watching
the callers come and go.

Mr. Travilla devoted himself a part of the
time to her entertainment, and that was something
she always enjoyed greatly.

âAre you going to the party to-night?â he
asked.

Elsie shook her head. âPapa thinks I could
not bear the fatigue without injury to my
health, so it wouldnât be right for me to go.
But he left it to my own conscience, he said,
and let me decide for myself.â

âDid he, indeed?â Mr. Travilla seemed
both surprised and pleased. âWell,â he said,
âI think you were very right and wise to decide
as you did.â

Elsie thought it very kind in her father to
let her decide for herself, and also to promise
not to leave her until she was in bed for the
night; and, in the fulness of her gratitude,
offered to go to bed an hour earlier than
usual.

âDear child!â Rose exclaimed, âthat
would be asking quite too much of you; and
we really donât care to be among the first arrivals.â

âNo,â remarked Adelaide, âweâll be there
long enough if we are the very last. Iâm growing
tired of parties.â

Mr. Dinsmore had not responded to Elsieâs
proposition as yet, except by a pleased smile
and tender caress.

âIt would be no very great sacrifice, mamma,â
Elsie said, âfor somehow I feel pretty
tired to-night. Papa and I took quite a long
walk this afternoon, and Iâm not sorry now
that Iâm to stay at home.â

âHome is a good place for tired people, isnât
it, daughter? and bed the best part of it?â her
father said, repeating his caresses. âSo I accept
your generous offer, and shall be glad to
see you in bed at the early hour you have
named.â

âWell,â said Adelaide, âI suppose if we
go early we need not stay very late.â

âThere is no need for you to go any earlier
than you wish,â replied her brother. âI shall
order the carriage for whatever hour you and
Rose fix upon.â

âMamma and auntie, Iâd like to see you
when you are dressed,â Elsie said; âbut, I suppose,
that wonât be till Iâm in bed.â

Both ladies promised to come into her bedroom
and exhibit themselves before donning
their wraps. They came in together and found
her already in bed, but not asleep.

âOh!â she cried, sitting up to take a good
view, âhow nice and pretty you both look! I
hope you will enjoy the party very much indeed.â

âAnd what have you to say of me?â asked
her father, presenting himself before her.

âThat Iâm very proud of my handsome
papa,â she answered, ending a hasty survey of
his whole person, with a look of love and delight
up into his face, as he stood gazing fondly
down upon her.

âLove makes my little girl blind to any imperfection
in her father,â he said, taking her
in his arms for a momentâs petting and fondling
ere he bade her good-night. âNow, go to
sleep,â as he laid her down and tucked the
covers carefully about her.

The next afternoon, Mr. Dinsmore and the
two ladies, feeling the need of rest and sleep—​for
they had returned very late from the party—​each
indulged in a nap.

Elsie, who was not sleepy, thought the house
had never before seemed so quiet and lonely;
she missed Annis more than she had on any
previous day. She would have gone out for a
walk, but a steady rain forced her to remain
within doors.

She wandered slowly, aimlessly, and with
noiseless footsteps from room to room. At
length entering her fatherâs study she seated
herself in the chair he had occupied not long
before, beside his writing-desk.

A book, a copy of âOliver Twist,â lay open
upon the desk, and as her eye fell on the
printed page, she read at a glance enough to
arouse within her an absorbing interest in its
contents; and never stopping to look at the title
or to consider whether or no it was such a work
as she would be permitted to examine, she read
on, hastily, eagerly, to the bottom of the page;
turned it quickly, and perused the next and the
next; so intensely interested as to be utterly
oblivious of everything but the story, until a
slight sound causing her to look up, she found
her father standing close at her side, regarding
her with a countenance of mingled astonishment
and grieved, stern displeasure.

Instantly her eyes fell beneath his gaze, while
her face crimsoned with shame and embarrassment.

He gently took the book from her and pointing
to a large easy-chair on the farther side of
the room, said, âSit there till I have time to
attend to you.â

His tone was very grave and sad, and she
heard him sigh deeply as she hastily and silently
obeyed.

He paced the floor for some minutes, then
seated himself at the desk, and for the next
half hour the room seemed painfully still; the
slight scratching of his pen and an occasional
half-stifled sob from Elsie, the only sound save
the ceaseless patter of the rain outside.

The childâs tender conscience reproached her
bitterly, and the loving little heart ached with
a heavy burden of remorse, because of the pain
she had given to that of her almost idolized
father.

âOh, could it be
possible
that she had been
guilty of such disobedience to so kind and dear
a father! a father whose dear delight it was to
heap favors and caresses upon her. How could
she so wound him!â

And worse than all was the disobedience to her
heavenly Father, whose command, âChildren,
obey your parents,â she knew so well, and had
thought she loved to keep. Silently, and with
bitter, repentant tears, she confessed her sin to
Him, and asked to be forgiven for Jesusâ sake.

But she dared not address her earthly father
until he should first speak to her. She trembled
with fear of the punishment he might inflict.
What would it be? Would he visit her transgression
with the rod? She thought it not unlikely,
she felt that she deserved that and more.
Oh, how dreadful if, in addition, he should deny
her for days and weeks the seat upon his knee,
which was one of her dearest privileges; the
caresses and tender, loving words she so revelled
it! How could she bear it!

The time of waiting for his verdict seemed
very long, would it ever come to an end? And
yet, when at last he laid aside his pen and
turned in her direction, she trembled and
shrank from the ordeal that was before her.

âElsie!â His tone was exceedingly grave
and stern.

âSir!â she answered, in a voice full of
tears.

âCome here to me!â

She obeyed instantly.

âO father! papa!â she sobbed, falling on
her knees at his feet, âIâve been a very wicked,
disobedient child! I deserve to be severely
punished, but I—​â She could not go on for
the sobs that were well-nigh choking her.

He lifted her gently, and drew her to him.
âI cannot tell you,â he said in moved tones,
âhow deeply, how sorely, I am pained to find
that I cannot trust my daughter, the dear darling
of my heart, as I fondly believed I could!
to find that she is but an eye-servant, obeying
me carefully in my presence, but disobeying
my most express commands when she thinks I
shall not know it.â

âO papa!â she cried, in a voice of anguish,
hiding her face on his breast, while her whole
frame shook with bitter, bursting sobs, âIâd
rather you would give me the severest whipping
than say that! Oh, please believe that it
is the very first time I ever did such a thing!
You know all about every time Iâve disobeyed
you.â

âI do believe it,â he answered; âI have
never had reason to doubt my daughterâs
word.â

She lifted her face and looked up gratefully,
though humbly, through her tears.

âI am unutterably thankful to be able to say
that,â he went on. âAnd I am inclined to be
the more lenient toward you, because I feel that
I am partly to blame for leaving temptation in
your way; especially after allowing you to hear
enough about these stories of Dickensâ to greatly
excite your curiosity and interest. Therefore
the only punishment I shall inflict is a prohibition
of your visits to this room in my absence
from it. You may come in as freely as heretofore
when I am here to see what you do, but
at other times—​until I see fit to remove the
prohibition—​you are not to cross the threshold.â

Elsieâs tears fell fast; she felt her fatherâs
prohibition keenly, because it meant want of
trust in her; yet she could but acknowledge
that it was a far lighter punishment than she
had expected or deserved.

âDear papa, you are very, very kind not to
punish me more severely,â she said, as he
lifted her face, and tenderly wiped away her
tears with his own fine, soft handkerchief;
then, catching sight of his face, âO papa,
papa! donât look so grieved and sad!â she
cried, clinging about his neck, with a fresh
burst of sobs and tears.

âMy child, I must look as I feel,â he sighed,
holding her close to his heart. âI cannot be
other than sad after such a discovery as I have
made to-day.â

âOh, all the pain ought to be mine!â she
sobbed, âI ought to bear it all! I want to!â

âBut you cannot,â he said. âLet that
thought deter you from all future acts of disobedience.
Sin always brings sorrow and suffering,
and that seldom to the evil-doer alone;
usually the innocent suffer with the guilty.â

âThat is the very worst part of my punishment,â
she sobbed. âBut, oh, wonât you believe,
papa, that I am very, very sorry for having
disobeyed you, and do not intend ever to
do so again?â

âYes; I do believe that; and in proof of it,
shall not forbid you to go freely to the library;
though there are novels there, and they are not
kept under lock and key.â

âI donât deserve it,â she said, very humbly
and gratefully. âO papa, I donât know how
I could be so wickedly disobedient to such a
dear, good, kind father as you!â

âAnd to an infinitely better and kinder
Father,â he added, in low, reverent tones. âI
would have you more concerned because of
your sin as against Him than against me.â

As he talked on for several minutes in the
same strain, her distress became so great that he
found it necessary to try to comfort her with
assurances from Godâs word of his willingness
to forgive those who are truly penitent, and
who come to him for pardon pleading the
merits and atoning blood of his dear Son.

Opening the Bible he read to her, âIf any
man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation
for our sins.â âI, even I, am He
that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
own sake, and will not remember thy sins.â

âPapa, pray for me,â she pleaded, amid
her sobs and tears; âask God to forgive my
sins and take away all the evil that is in me.â

And he did, kneeling with her, his arm
around her, her head against his breast.

âNow, my darling,â he said, as he drew her
to his knee again, âbe comforted, remembering
that precious assurance of His word, âIf we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.ââ

âSuch sweet, comforting words, papa,â she
said. Then after a momentâs silence, âI donât
mean to try to excuse my wrong-doing, papa,
but just to tell you how I happened to disobey
you so. A mere glance at the open page interested
me so greatly in the story that I
thought of nothing else till you were there beside
me.â

âWant of thought has done a great deal of
mischief in the world, my child,â was his grave
comment.

CHAPTER
XXIV.

âI shall the effect of this good lesson keep,

As watchman to my heart.â

—​
Shakspeare.

Mr. Travilla
spent the evening at the Oaks,
arriving shortly before tea and remaining until
Elsie had gone to her rooms for the night.

He noticed that his little friend was not her
usual merry, happy self. Her sweet face bore
traces of tears, and as he watched her furtively
he was sure that now and then her eyes filled,
and that she found it difficult to conceal her
emotion. Once or twice, too, she slipped out
of the room for a few moments; to recover
control of her feelings; so he thought.

She was very quiet, scarcely speaking at all,
unless addressed, but clung to her father even
more closely than usual, her eyes often seeking
his with a wistful, pleading look, to which
he responded with a gentle caress, while his
manner toward her was full of grave tenderness.

âShe has displeased him in some way (absurdly
and almost tyrannically strict as he is),
and is morbidly remorseful for it,â was the
conclusion Mr. Travilla came to, and he quite
longed to cheer and comfort her.

Elsie on her part was disappointed that she
had to go away for the night without a few last
minutes alone with her father. But just as she
was ready for bed he came in, took her on his
knee, assured her that he was now not in the
least angry with her, and comforted her again
with sweet and appropriate texts of Scripture,
telling of Godâs willingness to forgive those who
truly repent of sin.

âYes, papa,â she said, with fast falling tears.
âI know Jesus has forgiven me, but it
breaks my heart to think I could so dishonor
him! He says, âIf ye love me keep my commandments,â
and I have failed to-day, and yet
I do love him! Iâm sure I do! and you too, dear
papa. Can you believe it after I have disobeyed
you so?â she asked, with her arm about his
neck, her eyes, dim with tears, gazing beseechingly
into his.

âMy darling, precious child, I havenât a
doubt of it!â he said, folding her close to his
heart. Then laying her in her bed, he kissed
her good-night and left her to her slumbers.

Mr. Dinsmore always kept his little daughterâs
secrets even from Rose. He thought it
quite unnecessary to tell of any trouble between
himself and his child, and if Rose occasionally
perceived that something was wrong between
them, she made no remark and asked no question,
noticed it in no way except by redoubling her
kindness to both.

She had made the same observation that Mr.
Travilla had that evening, and drawn pretty
nearly the same conclusion. Her husband had
been displeased with his little girl, but there had
been a reconciliation, and the child would soon
recover her wonted cheerfulness and gayety.

Elsie did seem very much like her usual self
the next morning, and when her lessons were
done joined her mamma in the parlor, bringing
some needlework with her.

Adelaide had concluded her visit to the Oaks,
and she and her brother had left a few moments
before to drive over to Roselands.

So Rose and Elsie were alone together for a
little while; but presently Mr. Travilla joined
them. He and Rose fell into desultory chat,
to which Elsie was an interested listener. The
talk turned at length upon engravings, and Rose
spoke of a small, but very fine one, lately
bought by her husband, which Mr. Travilla had
not yet seen.

âI want you to look at it,â Rose said.
âElsie dear,â turning to her little step-daughter,
âwill you run to your papaâs study and bring
me his portfolio? I think it is in that.â

Elsieâs face crimsoned, and she seemed greatly
confused and embarrassed. âMamma, I—​I—​please
donât ask me to,â she stammered, then
burst into tears.

Rose was greatly surprised. âWhat is it,
dear?â she asked, with tender concern.

âPapa—​papa has—​forbidden me to go there,
except when—​when he is present,â sobbed the
little girl, dropping her work to hide her blushing
face in her hands.

âThen never mind, dear child, I should
not have asked you if I had known that,â Rose
said, in an undertone full of sympathy and affection.
âI shall go myself.â

Excusing herself to Mr. Travilla, she left the
room.

He seemed scarcely to hear her excuse, so entirely
was he taken up with pitying tenderness
toward the weeping, mortified, embarrassed
child.

âMy dear little friend,â he said, drawing
near and softly touching the shining curls of
the bowed head, âwhat can I do to help and
comfort you?â

âYou are very kind,â she sobbed, âbut no
one can help me.â

âI have some influence with your papa,â he
said, âand would gladly use it in your behalf,
if—​if your trouble is that you have angered or
displeased him. But I know he loves you very,
very dearly, and surely, whatever you may have
done, he will forgive and take you back into
favor, if you tell him you are sorry.â

âPapa is not angry with me now,â she said,
wiping away her tears, and looking up earnestly
into her friendâs face, âbut,â and again her
face flushed crimson and her eyes fell, while
the tears rolled down her cheeks—​âoh, you
would hardly believe how very, very naughty
and disobedient I was yesterday!â

âNo, I donât know how to believe it. But
your papa is—​â

He left the sentence unfinished; but Elsie
knew intuitively his thought—​that her father
was very strict and severe; and with a sudden
generous resolve to prove that he was not, she
told Mr. Travilla the whole truth, though deeply
ashamed to have him know of her wrong-doing.

âOh, it is dreadful, to think my dear father
canât trust me!â she sobbed, in conclusion;
âbut you see he was not severe with me, Mr.
Travilla. If he had given me a hard whipping
beside, it wouldnât have been any more than I
deserved.â

âA delicate, dear little girl like you!â he
exclaimed. âI should never have respected
him again if he had.â But the last words were
spoken so low and indistinctly that Elsie did
not catch them.

âA very bad, disobedient little girl, Mr.
Travilla,â she sighed. âOh, I couldnât have
believed I ever would disobey papa so!â

âDo you know,â he said gently, âyour remorse
seems to me altogether out of proportion
to the offence—​just reading a little in a forbidden
book. Why as a boy I was often guilty
of far worse deeds, yet thought myself rather a
good sort of fellow after all.â

Elsie understood this remark as merely an
effort to comfort her by making light of her
wrong-doing, and answered it with a grateful
look.

âNow, my dear, I wouldnât fret about it
any more,â he said, smoothing her hair with
gentle, caressing hand. âI feel sure your
papa will soon trust you as fully as ever.
I

should at this moment trust you to any extent;
and I assure you I think you the best little girl
I ever knew.â

Elsie looked up in incredulous surprise.
âYou are very, very kind, sir! but papa does
not think so: he knows me better.â And another
tear rolled quickly down her cheek.

âI hope,â Mr. Travilla said, meditatively,
âhe wonât think it necessary to deny you the
promised visit to Ion, because of this.â

âI did not know about that,â she returned,
half inquiringly. âI thought our holidays
were to be over as soon as Annis comes back.â

âYes, but we had arranged that you were to
bring you books with you, spend the mornings
at your tasks, and enjoy, for the rest of the day,
whatever pleasures my mother and I might be
able to provide. I think we could make it
pleasant for you.â

âOh, I am sure of it! and I should like to go
so much!â she exclaimed, âbut I donât think
papa will let me now; and I am sure I do not
deserve that he should.â

âWell, we wonât despair,â he said cheerfully.
âI know he doesnât allow any coaxing from
you, but that is not forbidden to me, and if
necessary, I shall try my powers of persuasion.â

A call to the nursery had detained Rose, thus
giving them time for this little talk; but now
she was returning; they heard her light step
coming down the hall, her voice and that of old
Mr. Dinsmore in conversation.

âGrandpa! Oh, please excuse me, Mr. Travilla!
I donât want him to see that—​that—​Iâve
been crying,â Elsie exclaimed, and slipped out
of the room by one door as they entered by another.

Her eyes were so full of tears that she did
not see that her father was near until he had
her in his arms.

âWhat is the matter?â he asked tenderly.

Her only answer was a fresh burst of tears
and sobs.

They were near the door of her boudoir. He
took her hand, led her in there, sat down on a
sofa and drew her to his knee.

âTell me what ails you,â he said, and she
knew by his tone that he would have the whole
story; there was no escape for her; though,
indeed, she was now and always ready enough to
pour out all her griefs into his sympathizing ear.

So she told of her mammaâs request and the
confession it had forced from her, that she was
forbidden to go to his study in his absence;
ending with, âO papa, please, please remove
the prohibition and punish me some other way!
wonât you, dear papa?â

âWhat other way?â

âI donât know,â she answered, hiding her
face on his shoulder.

âShall I lock you up for a week on bread
and water?â

âOh, no, no! that would be worse; everybody
would know I had been very naughty.
But I—​I believe Iâd almost rather you—​would
whip me; for nobody need know about it, and
it would be all over in a few minutes.â

âI shall not do that,â he said, very decidedly,
and in a moved tone, pressing her closer to his
breast and touching his lips to her cheek; âhow
could I? You must bear the punishment I have
decreed, but you shall have no other; and I
hope it will not be long before I can trust you
as fully as ever.â

âPapa, canât you do it now?â she asked imploringly;
âwonât you remove your prohibition?â

âNo, not now; not for days or weeks.â

Then she wept very bitterly.

âMy little daughter,â he said, tenderly wiping
away her tears, and smoothing the hair back
from her heated brow, âI am very, very sorry
for you; but do you feel so sure of your strength
to resist the temptation before which you fell
yesterday, that you wish me to expose you to it
again?â

âNo, papa, oh, no!â she said, with a look of
new comprehension in the eyes she lifted to his;
âbut is that why you refuse?â

âYes, daughter; for I have not the least
doubt that you fully intend to be obedient to me
at all times, whether I am present or absent.â

âO papa, thank you! thank you very much!â
she said, putting her arms about his neck, while
her face grew almost bright. âI thought your
prohibition meant doubt that I intended to be
good and obedient, but now I donât want it removed;
because—​because I—​am not sure I
could withstand temptation,â she added, humbly,
a vivid blush suffusing her face.

That evening Mr. Dinsmore told Elsie of the
intended visit to Ion, adding that it was to be
made the next week.

âAnd will you let me go after I have been
so naughty, papa?â she asked, in glad surprise.

âHave I ever punished you twice for the
same fault?â he inquired.

âNo, sir; oh, no!â

âThen why should you expect it in this instance?â

âI donât know, papa, only that I—​I feel
that I am so very, very undeserving of such a
pleasure,â she murmured, hanging her head
and blushing painfully.

âThat question is not under consideration,â
he said, gently lifting the downcast face that he
might kiss the sweet lips again and again; âwe
all have very many blessings that we do not deserve.â

CHAPTER
XXV.

âThe mountain rill

Seeks with no surer flow the far, bright sea,

Than my unchanged affections flow to thee.â

—​
Park Benjamin.

The
Landreths and Annis returned to the
Oaks on Monday of the next week, and on
Tuesday all went to Ion, where the rest of the
week was spent most delightfully.

There was a large dinner party the first day,
but after that they were the only guests, and
their host and hostess quite laid themselves out
for their entertainment.

Rose and Mildred enjoyed many a nice, quiet
chat with Mrs. Travilla in the mornings, while
the little girls were busy with their tasks; the
afternoons, when the weather permitted, were
spent in the open air, walking, riding, or driving;
and in the evenings all gathered about the
fire, and lively conversation, enigmas, stories,
games, and music made the time fly so fast that
the little folks could scarcely believe the clock
was right when it told them their hour for
going to bed had come.

Annis would sometimes have lingered if Elsie
might have done so too; but that Mr. Dinsmore
would not allow; so with a pleasant good-night
to all they went away together; for
they shared the same room and enjoyed it
greatly.

On Saturday evening they returned to the
Oaks, and on Monday the old round of duties
and pleasures was taken up again.

One stormy afternoon, as the little girls sat
together in Elsieâs dressing-room, pleasantly
busied in millinery and mantua-making for the
family of dolls, Annis said, âI read âOliver
Twistâ while we were at Holly Hall.â

Elsie looked up in surprise. âDid you?
Would your father and mother let you read
such books?â

âWell,â returned Annis, blushing, âI
never heard them mention âOliver Twistâ at all,
and I peeped into it one day and found it so
interesting I just couldnât help going on and
reading the whole story. I thought why
shouldnât I read what Milly and Brother
Charlie and Cousin Horace and Cousin Rose
do?â

âPapa says,â returned Elsie slowly, âthat
I might as well ask why the baby may not eat
everything that we older ones do.â

âI suppose he means that our minds havenât
cut their teeth yet,â said Annis, laughing.
âBut donât you wish you were grown up
enough to read novels?â

âI donât know; Iâd like to read them dearly
well, but I love to be papaâs little girl and sit
on his knee.â

âYouâll do that when youâre grown up,â
remarked Annis, with a wise nod of her pretty
head. âIâll tell you the story of âOliver Twistâ
if you want me to.â

The offer was a tempting one, Elsie did want
so very much to know what became of Oliver
finally, and all about several of the other characters
in whom she had become interested;
for one minute she hesitated; then said firmly,
âIt wouldnât be right for me to hear it,
Annis dear, without papaâs leave, and that I
shouldnât even dare to ask. But I thank you
all the same.â

âElsie, you are so good and obedient that
you often make me feel ashamed of myself,â
Annis said, with a look of hearty, affectionate
admiration into her cousinâs face.

The fair face crimsoned. âNo, no, Annis,
I am not! indeed I am not!â she exclaimed
in tremulous tones, the tears springing to her
eyes.

âOh, I know youâre a hypocrite and only
pretend to be good!â returned Annis, laughingly.
âBut there, I hear Milly calling me,â
and hastily laying aside her work away she ran.

âI wonder if I ought to tell her,â Elsie
said to herself, wiping away a tear. âOh, I
donât want her to know! but Iâm afraid it
isnât right to let her think me so much better
than I am.â

Just then there was a gentle tap at the door
leading into her boudoir. She rose quickly
and opened it.

âO Mr. Travilla! I am glad to see you,
sir!â she said, offering her hand.

He took it and lifted it gallantly to his lips.

âExcuse me for coming in without an invitation,
my little friend,â he said. âI knocked
at the other door, but no one seemed to hear,
so I came on to this one.â

âPlease always feel free to do so, Mr.
Travilla,â she answered; âI think you have
almost as much right as papa. Wonât you
take this easy-chair?â

âThank you, my dear,â he said, accepting
the invitation. âAnd now if you will allow me
another of your papaâs privileges—​that of taking
you on my knee, you will make me very
happy.â

âAm I not growing too large and heavy,
sir?â she asked, passively submitting to his
will.

âNo, not at all; I only wish you belonged
to me so that I could have you here every
day.â

âMr. Travilla, I thought you would never
think well of me again, never love me any
more, after you learned how very naughty I
was one day a few weeks ago,â she murmured,
blushing and hanging her head.

âMy dear little girl,â he said, stroking her
hair, âthat did not lessen my good opinion of
you; on the contrary, your sorrow for what
seemed to me but a slight misdemeanor, and
your frank confession of it, raised you in my
esteem, if that were possible; for I have long
thought you very nearly perfect.â

She shook her head, the blush deepening on
her cheek. âAh, sir, you make me feel like
a hypocrite! And Annis has been talking so
too, and I—​â

She hesitated, a troubled, anxious look on
her sweet, innocent face.

âWhat is it, dear child?â he asked, âanything
I can help you with?â

âI was wondering if—​if I ought to tell
Annis about my—​my naughtiness that day.â

âI am quite sure you are under no obligation
to do so,â he said, âand perhaps it would
be better not to tell her.â

Elsie looked relieved.

âAh,â he exclaimed, drawing something
from his pocket, âI am forgetting the particular
errand on which I came. Here is a book that
you will enjoy, I think; and with your fatherâs
approval; for I submitted it to him before
bringing it to you.â

Elsie accepted the gift with warm thanks and
looks of delight which well repaid him for his
thoughtful kindness.

Annis came back presently, and after a little
chat with her, Mr. Travilla left them to enjoy
the book together.

Mr. Dinsmoreâs prohibition had not been removed,
and Elsie still felt it keenly, though,
while carefully observing it, she said nothing
on the subject, to her papa or any one else.

One morning she and Annis came in from a
walk about the grounds, and while Annis
went on into the house, Elsie lingered on the
veranda, petting and playing with a favorite
dog.

Looking round at the sound of horseâs hoofs
on the drive, she saw Dr. Landreth just reining
in his steed at the foot of the veranda steps.
The day being quite cold, there was no servant
just at hand, though usually several could be
seen lounging near this, the principal entrance
to the mansion; so he called to her.

âElsie, my dear, I have ridden back from
the gate to recover my note-book, which I
think I must have left on the table in your
fatherâs study. Will you run and get it for
me?â

Elsie felt her cheeks grow hot. What
should she do? She was almost certain her
father was not in the house. Must she explain
to the doctor why she could not go into his
study when he was not there? No; she would
summon a servant to do the errand; though
that would take longer than to do it herself, and
the doctor seemed in haste, and would wonder
and probably be vexed at the delay. But it
could not be helped, she dared not, would not
disobey her father. All this passed through
her mind in an instant.

âI will get it as quickly as I can, sir,â she
said, and hurried into the house.

She rapped lightly on the study-door, then
opened it and peeped in. It was just possible
her papa might be there.

Yes, oh joy! there he was, sitting by the
fire reading the morning paper, and looking
up from it, âI am here; come in, daughter,â
he said pleasantly.

âThe doctor sent me for his note-book,
papa,â she said, glancing about in search of it.

âYes, there it is on my writing-desk.â

âMay I come back when I have given it to
him, papa?â she asked, as she took it up and
turned to go.

âYes; you may always come in when I am
here; your father loves to have you with him.â

There was a flash of joy in the beautiful
eyes looking into his, and the doctor thought,
as he took the note-book from her hand, that
he had never seen a brighter, happier face.

âMany thanks, my dear,â he said, lifting his
hat with a bow and smile, then turned his
horseâs head and galloped away.

Elsie looked after him for a moment, then
hastened back to her father.

He greeted her entrance with a smile full of
fatherly love and pride.

âTake off your hat and cloak,â he said,
âand ring for a servant to carry them away.â

She did so, then came and stood close at his
side, putting her arm around his neck, and laying
her cheek to his.

âMy papa! my own dear, dear papa!â she
murmured lovingly.

âMy precious little daughter!â he responded,
laying down his paper and drawing her to his
knee. âI thought I saw a cloud on my darlingâs
face as she peeped in at the door yonder a few
moments since. What troubled you, dearest?
Tell papa all about it.â

âI was afraid you were not here, and so I
couldnât come in to do the doctorâs errand; and
I didnât want to tell him so. I didnât want
him to know why. It does seem, father, as if
Iâm in danger of having everybody find out
about my naughtiness and—​and my punishment,â
she said, blushing and hanging her
head, the troubled look again on her face.

He did not answer immediately, but sat for
some minutes silently caressing her hair and
cheek. Then, âMy little girl,â he said, in
low, tender accents, âI think I may fully trust
you now. I remove the prohibition, and give
you full permission to come in here when you
will as freely as ever.â

âDear, papa, thank you! oh, thank you very
much!â she cried joyfully, repaying him with
the sweetest kisses and smiles.

âDo you love me very much?â he asked.

âOh, more than tongue can tell! I always
did; always shall; Iâm sure,
sure
I can never
love anybody else half so dearly!â

âSuppose I should again become as cold,
stern, and severe to my little girl as I once was?â
he said, with a tremor of pain and remorse in
his tones, and pressing her close to his heart as
he spoke.

âI should love you still, papa,â she answered,
tightening her clasp of his neck, and showering
kisses on his face; âbut, oh, donât ever be
so! it would break my heart if you should
quit petting me, and not let me sit here and hug
and kiss you.â

âDonât fear it, my precious one,â he said
with emotion; âyou could scarcely suffer more
than I from a cessation of these sweet love passages
between us.â

CHAPTER
XXVI.

ââMid pleasures and palaces though I may roam,

Be it ever so humble, thereâs no place like home.â

Winter
sped rapidly away to our friends at
the Oaks, each day so full of agreeable, useful
employment and quiet pleasures, that they found
it all too short; time never hung heavy on their hands, ennui was unknown to them.

No unusual or startling event marked the
course of the weeks and months. Mildred and
Annis kept up a steady correspondence with
mother and sisters, and now and then the letters
from Pleasant Plains seemed to bring with them
a touch of homesickness; but it would pass off
directly, leaving the victims as light-hearted
and happy as before.

So, until Spring had fairly set in and they
knew that April suns and showers were bringing
out the buds and leaves, and waking the
flowers in garden and woods even in their
northern home; then, in spite of a very strong
affection for these relatives and kind entertainers,
a very sincere regret at the thought of
parting from them, they were seized with a
great and unquenchable desire for home—​home
and mother—​they longed for all the dear ones,
but mother most of all.

The business affair which had called Dr.
Landreth South had now been brought to a
prosperous issue, and as there was no longer
any necessity for remaining, an early day was
set for their departure.

The doctor and his wife, conversing together
in the privacy of their own apartments one
bright sunshiny morning, had just settled this
question, when Annis came running in.

Mildred, with the brightest, happiest face
she had worn for days, was dandling little
Percy on her knee, telling him between rapturous
kisses, âHe shall go home to dear grandpa
and grandma, so he shall, the darling pet!â

âO Milly, are we going home soon?â cried
Annis breathlessly.

âYes; next week, your brother says.â

âIf you think you can be ready by that
time,â added the doctor.

âI!â exclaimed Annis, âIâd be ready in an
hour if you and Milly would. Oh, Iâm so glad,
so glad! I must run and tell Elsie.â

âAnd donât you hope she will be as glad as
you are?â asked the doctor jocosely.

âOh, it will be hard to leave Elsie!â she
said, stopping short, with a look of distress. âI
wonder if we couldnât persuade Cousin Horace
to let us take her along to spend the summer
at our house.â

âTry it, Annis; thereâs nothing like trying,â
remarked the doctor with mock gravity.
âBut I advise you to extend your invitation to
him; or, better still, to the whole family; youâll
have more chance of success.â

âI wish they could and would all go with
us,â Mildred said.

âSo do I, my dear; but I know that it
wouldnât suit Dinsmore to be absent from the
plantation, just at present.â

âThen why did you advise me to invite him?â
asked Annis in a piqued tone.

âBecause in my opinion one might as well
ask for the gift of his entire fortune as for leave
to carry his little girl so far from him.â

âO Brother Charlie! didnât father and
mother let me come just as far away from them?
and to stay away just as long?â

âReally, I had not thought of that!â laughed
the doctor. âWell, ask Mr. Dinsmore;
but if he says no, make allowance for the fact
that he has but one daughter, while your father
and mother rejoice in a goodly number.â

âIâll go and do it this minute!â she exclaimed
with energy and determination. âBut first
Iâll invite them all; shaânât I, Milly?â she
asked, looking back from the doorway.

âYes, tell them nothing could give greater
pleasure to us or mother and the rest at home.â

Running lightly down the broad stairway into
the spacious hall below, Annis heard a sound
of cheerful voices, mingled with peals of merry
child laughter, coming from the veranda beyond.

The air was warm and balmy with the breath
of flowers, and doors and windows stood wide
open, giving to the passer-by delightful glimpses
of the grounds lovely with the verdure and
bloom of spring.

From the veranda the view was more extended,
and thither the whole family had betaken
themselves for the full enjoyment of it, and of
the sweet, fresh air. Here Annis found them;
Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore sitting side by side,
little Horace on his fatherâs knee, and Elsie
romping and playing with him, laughing merrily
herself, and making him laugh, while the
parents looked on with pleased and happy faces.

âAh, Annis, will you come and join us?â
Mr. Dinsmore said, catching sight of the little
girl as she stepped from the open doorway.

âThank you, Cousin Horace,â she returned,
coming forward in eager haste. âI have some
news to tell.â

âAh! then let us have it.â

Elsie stopped her romping, stood still, and
turned to listen.

âIt is that we are to start for home next
week; and, O Cousin Horace, we want to take
you all with us!â and she concluded with Mildredâs
message.

The expression of Elsieâs face changed rapidly
as Annis spoke; at first it was full of regret
at the prospect of losing her cousinsâ companionship;
then of pleasure at the thought of going
with them.

âO papa, can we?â she asked eagerly.

âNo, daughter; it would not suit me to leave
home at present. But we all thank you and
Mildred very much for your kind invitation,â
he added to Annis, âand are very sorry to hear
that we are to lose you so soon.â

âYes, Annis; ah, what shall I do without
you!â exclaimed Elsie.

âCousin Horace, I wish you could go and
would,â said Annis; âbut if you canât, you
will let Cousin Rose and little Horace and Elsie
go, wonât you?â

âMy dear,â he said, turning to his wife,
âhow would you like to go as far as Philadelphia
with them? Your mother has been very urgent
of late for a visit from you and the boy,â
with a fatherly, smiling glance at his little son,
âand this would be an excellent opportunity.â

âI should so much prefer to have you with
me,â Rose answered with hesitation.

âIf you want to make a long visit your wisest
course will be to go without me,â he returned
with a smile. âI will follow some
weeks later and bring you home.â

âI must take time to think of it,â she said.
âAnd Elsie? You will let me take her with
me?â

âAnd let her go on with us?â put in Annis.

âI am inclined to think I should not risk
much in leaving the decision of both questions
with her,â he said, with a tenderly, affectionate
glance into the sweet face of his little girl.

âLeave you, papa! to go so far away and
stay so long?â she exclaimed, springing to his
side, and clasping her arms tight about his
neck. âOh, no, no, no! never unless you
make me do it!â

âMake you!â he said, holding her close to
his heart with a low, happy laugh, âI donât
know what could induce me to permit it. My
wifeâs parents have some claim on her and their
little grandson,â he added, looking fondly at
Rose, âbut you, daughter, belong entirely to
me, and here you must stay while I do.â

She heard his verdict with a gleeful laugh,
gave him another hug and kiss, then turned to
Annis, and putting her arms about her, âO
Annis dear!â she said in tremulous tones, the
tears filling her eyes, âwhat shall I do without
you?â

âLook forward to another happy time together
at some future day,â suggested Mr.
Dinsmore cheerily. âAnd now if you will don
your riding-habits, we will have a gallop. I
have ordered the ponies and a horse for myself,
and they will be here very shortly.â

The little girls were both very fond of riding,
and smiles banished tears from their faces as
they hastened to do his bidding.

He exerted himself, and with good success,
through the few remaining days of Annisâs stay,
to keep them so busily and pleasantly employed
that there should be little time for the indulgence
of vain regrets.

Rose was not long in deciding to avail herself
of this good opportunity to visit her parents,
and as they made their preparations for
the journey, the heart of each proud young
mother was full of fond anticipations, of the delight
she should feel in showing her lovely baby
boy to his grandparents, aunts, and uncles.

âThey will hardly know Percy at home;
he has grown and improved so much!â Mildred
said to her husband.

âVery much indeed! yet I think they will
not be long in doubt of his identity,â the doctor
responded with a proud, loving glance,
from wife to son and back again; âhe has his
motherâs eyes and smile.â

When the appointed day came it found all in
readiness for the journey.

Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie accompanied the
travellers to the city, saw them on board the
train and took leave of them there.

âO papa!â Elsie said, sobbing on his breast
as they drove homeward, âpartings are so dreadful!—​partings
from those you love and donât
expect to see again for a long, long while.â

âYes, darling; I feel them to be so myself,
and I know it must be harder still for a little
one like you with such a loving, tender heart,â
he answered, soothing her with caresses.

âHow selfish I am, dear papa!â she exclaimed,
lifting her head to look into his face, and
noting its sad expression, âhow thoughtless to
forget how hard it must be for you to see
mamma and little brother go away.â

âSelfishness is quite foreign to your nature,
I think, dear daughter,â he returned, âand
though I do feel keenly the parting from those
dear ones, the weeks of separation cannot look
nearly so long to me as they do to one of your
age. But we will look forward to the happy
meeting we hope for at the end of those weeks.
And we have each other still,â he added with a
cheery smile. âShould not that be enough to
make us at least tolerably happy?â

âOh, yes! dear, dear papa! How much
worse to be parted from you than from all the
rest of the world! I will not cry any more,â
she said with determination, wiping away her
tears and smiling sweetly into the eyes that
were gazing so fondly into hers.

She kept her word, exerting herself to be
cheerful and to win her father from sad
thoughts by loving caresses and sweet, innocent
prattle.

He seconded her efforts, and before they
reached home they were laughing and jesting
right merrily.

But as they crossed the threshold she said
with quivering lip and tremulous voice, âPapa,
how very lonely it seems! and it will be still
more so in my own room; without Annis and
away from you.â

âThen suppose you spend all your time with
me.â

âOh, may I!â she asked, looking up delightedly
into his face.

âEvery moment from the time you are dressed
in the morning till you retire at night. That
is, if you wish it, and can contrive to learn your
lessons by my side in the hours when I am indoors.
In that case you may go with me when
and wherever I go.â

âOh, how nice, dear papa!â she cried, clapping
her hands and dancing about in her delight.

âYes,â he said, sitting down and taking
her in his arms to pet and fondle her. âI
think we shall be very happy together even
without any one to help us enjoy ourselves.
We were in former days, were we not,
darling?â

âYes, indeed, papa! when we first came to
this sweet home, and each of us was all the
other had. Let us pretend weâve gone back to
those old times just for a little while. Wouldnât
it be a nice variety?â

âIt seemed a very nice variety then, and
you may pretend it as strongly as you please,â
he said, with an amused, indulgent smile.

THE END.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

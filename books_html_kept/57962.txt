INTRODUCTION.

As
it has been my endeavour, throughout this history, to
leave nothing unexplained that may assist the reader
in understanding the different subjects that have been treated
in the course of it, I think myself obliged to say a few
words concerning the manner of arranging this Appendix.
With regard to the Natural History, it must occur to every
one, that, however numerous and respectable they may be
who have dedicated themselves entirely to this study, they
bear but a very small proportion to those who, for amusement
or instruction, seek the miscellaneous and general
occurrences of life that ordinarily compose a series of travels.

By presenting the two subjects promiscuously, I was apprehensive
of incommoding and disgusting both species of
readers. Every body that has read Tournefort, and some
other authors of merit of that kind, must be sensible how
unpleasant it is to have a very rapid, well-told, interesting
narrative, concerning the arts, government, or ruins of Corinth,
Athens, or Ephesus, interrupted by the appearance of
a nettle or daffodil, from some particularity which they
may possess, curious and important in the eye of a botanist,
but invisible and indifferent to an ordinary beholder.

vi

To prevent this, I have placed what belongs to Natural
History in one volume or appendix, and in so doing I hope
to meet the approbation of my scientific botanical readers,
by laying the different subjects all together before them,
without subjecting them to the trouble of turning over
different books to get at any one of them. The figures,
landscapes, and a few other plates of this kind, are illustrations
of what immediately passes in the page; these descriptions
seldom occupy more than a few lines, and therefore
such plates cannot be more ornamentally or usefully
placed than opposite to the page which treats of them.

Some further consideration was necessary in placing the
maps, and the Appendix appeared to me to be by far the
most proper part for them. The maps, whether such as are
general of the country, or those adapted to serve particular
itineraries, should always be laid open before the reader,
till he has made himself perfectly master of the bearings
and distances of the principal rivers, mountains, or provinces
where the scene of action is then laid. Maps that
fold lie generally but one way, and are mostly of strong paper,
so that when they are doubled by an inattentive hand,
contrary to the original fold they got at binding, they break,
and come asunder in quarters and square pieces, the map
is destroyed, and the book ever after incomplete; whereas,
even if this misfortune happens to a map placed in the
Appendix, it may either be taken out and joined anew, or
replaced at very little expence by a fresh map from the
bookseller.

I shall detain the reader but a few minutes with what
I have further to say concerning the particular subjects of

vii

Natural History of which I have treated. The choice I
know, though it may meet with the warmest concurrence
from one set of readers, will not perhaps be equally agreeable
to the taste of others. This I am heartily sorry for.
My endeavour and wish is to please them all, if it were possible,
as it is not.

The first subject I treat of is trees, shrubs, or plants; and
in the selecting of them I have preferred those which, having
once been considered as subjects of consequence by the
ancients, and treated largely of by them, are now come, from
want of the advantage of drawing, lapse of time, change
of climate, alteration of manners, or accident befallen the
inhabitants of a country, to be of doubtful existence and
uncertain description; the ascertaining of many of these is
necessary to the understanding the classics.

It is well known to every one the least versant in this part
of Natural History, what a prodigious revolution has happened
in the use of drugs, dyes, and gums, since the time of
Galen, by the introduction of those Herculean medicines
drawn from minerals. The discovery of the new world,
besides, has given us vegetable medicines nearly as active
and decisive as those of minerals themselves. Many found
in the new world grow equally in the old, from which
much confusion has arisen in the history of each, that will
become inextricable in a few generations, unless attended
to by regular botanists, assisted by attentive and patient
draughts-men ignorant of system, or at least not slaves to
it, who set down upon paper what with their eyes they see
does exist, without amusing themselves with imagining, according
to rules they have themselves made, what it regularly

viii

should be. One drawing of this kind, painfully and attentively
made, has more merit, and promotes true knowledge more
certainly, than a hundred horti sicci which constantly produce
imaginary monsters, and throw a doubt upon the whole.
The modern and more accurate system of botany has fixed
its distinctions of genus and species upon a variety of such
fine parts naturally so fragil, that drying, spreading, and
pressing with the most careful hands, must break away and
destroy some of those parts. These deficient in one plant,
exiting in another in all other respects exactly similar, are
often, I fear, construed into varieties, or different species, and
well if the misfortune goes no farther. They are precisely
of the same bad consequence as an inaccurate drawing,
where these parts are left out through inattention, or design.

After having bestowed my first consideration upon these
that make a principal figure in ancient history, which are
either not at all or imperfectly known now, my next attention
has been to those which have their uses in manufactures,
medicine, or are used as food in the countries I am
describing.

The next I have treated are the plants, or the varieties of
plants, unknown, whether in genus or species. In these I
have dealt sparingly in proportion to the knowledge I yet
have acquired in this subject, which is every day increasing,
and appears perfectly attainable.

The history of the birds and beasts is the subject which
occupies the next place in this Appendix; and the

ix

rule I follow here, is to give the preference to such
of each kind as are mentioned in scripture, and concerning
which doubts have arisen. A positive precept that
says, Thou shalt not eat such beast, or such bird, is absolutely
useless, as long as it is unknown what that bird and
what that animal is.

Many learned men have employed themselves with success
upon these topics, yet much remains still to do; for it
has generally happened, that those perfectly acquainted
with the language in which the scriptures were written,
have never travelled nor seen the animals of Judea, Palestine,
or Arabia; and again, such as have travelled in these
countries, and seen the animals in question, have been either
not at all, or but superficially acquainted with the original
language of scripture. It has been my earnest desire
to employ the advantage I possess in both these requisites, to
throw as much light as possible upon the doubts that have
arisen. I hope I have done this freely, fairly, and candidly;
if I have at all succeeded, I have obtained my reward.

As for the fishes and other marine productions of the Red
Sea, my industry has been too great for my circumstances.
I have by me above 300 articles from the Arabian gulf alone,
all of equal merit with those specimens which I have here
laid before the public. Though I have selected a very few
articles only, and these perhaps not the most curious, yet
as they are connected with the trade of the Red Sea as it
was carried on in ancient times, and may again be resumed,
and as of this I have treated professedly, I have preferred
these, as having a classical foundation, to many others more

x

curious and less known. Engraving in England has advanced
rapidly towards perfection, and the prices, as we may
suppose, have kept proportion with the improvement. My
small fortune, already impaired with the expence of the
journey, will not, without doing injustice to my family, bear
the additional one, of publishing these numerous articles,
which, however desirable it might be, would amount to
a sum which in me it would not be thought prudent to
venture.

If Egypt had been a new, late, and extraordinary creation,
the gift of the Nile in these latter times, as some modern
philosophers have pretended, the least thing we could
have expected would have been to find some new and extraordinary
plants accompany it, very different in figure
and parts from those of ancient times, made by the
old unphilosophical

way, the
fiat
of the Creator of the universe. But
just the contrary has happened. Egypt hath no trees, shrubs,
or plants peculiar to it. All are brought thither from Syria,
Arabia, Africa, and India; and these are so far from being
the gift of the Nile, as scarcely to accustom themselves to
suffer the quantity of water that for five months covers the
land of Egypt by the inundation of that river.

Even many of those that the necessities of particular
times have brought thither to supply wants with which
they could not dispense, and those which curious hands
have brought from foreign countries are not planted at
random; for they would not grow in Egypt, but in chosen
places formerly artificially raised above level, for gardens,
and pleasure ground, where they are at this day watered
by machinery; or upon banks above the calishes, which

xi

though near the water, are yet above the level of its annual
inundation. Such is the garden of Mattareah, sometimes
filled with exotic plants from all the countries around,
from the veneration or superstition, pilgrims and dervishies,
the only travellers of the east, have for that spot, the supposed
abode of the Virgin Mary when she fled into Egypt,
sometimes, as at present, so neglected as to have scarce one
foreign or curious plant in it.

The first kind of these adventitious productions, and the
oldest inhabitant of Egypt brought there for use, is the sycamore,
called Giumez
1
by the Arabs, which from its size,
the facility with which it is sawn into the thinnest planks,
and the largeness of these planks corresponding to the immense
size of the tree, was most usefully adapted to the
great demand they then had for mummy-chests, or coffins,
which are made of this tree only: in order to add to its
value, we may mention another supposed quality, its
incorruptibility
,
very capable of giving it a preference, as coinciding
with the ideas which led the Egyptians to those fantastic
attempts of making the
body eternal
.

This last property, I suppose, is purely imaginary, for
though it be true, tradition says, that all the mummy-chests,
which have been found from former ages, were made of
sycamore, though the same is the persuasion of latter times,
and the fact is so far proven by all the mummy-chests now
found being of that wood, yet I will not take upon me to
vouch, that incorruptibility is a quality of this particular

xii

tree. I believe that seasoned elm, oak, or ash, perhaps even
fir, laid in the dry sands of Egypt perfectly screened from
moisture, and defended from the outward air, as all mummy-chests
are, would likewise appear incorruptible; and my
reason is, that having got made, while at Cairo, a case for a
telescope of sycamore plank, I buried it in my garden after
I came home from my travels, so as to leave it covered by
half a foot of earth; in less than four years it was entirely
putrid and rotten. And another telescope case of the cedar
of Lebanon appeared much less decayed, though even
in this last there were evident signs of corruption. But even
suppose it true, that these planks have been found incorruptible,
a doubt may still arise, whether they do not owe this
quality to a kind of varnish of resinous materials with
which I have seen almost all the mummy-chests covered,
and to which materials the preservation of the mummy itself
is in part certainly owing. The sycamore is a native of
that low warm stripe of country between the Red Sea and
mountains of Abyssinia; we saw a number of very fine
ones before we came to Taranta; they are also in Syria about
Sidon, but inferior in size to the former; they do not seem
to thrive in Arabia, for want of moisture.

All the other vegetable productions of Egypt have been
in a fluctuating state from one year to another. We find
them in Prosper Alpinus, and by his authority we seek for
them in that country. In Egypt we find them no more;
through neglect, they are rotten and gone, but we meet
them flourishing in Nubia, Abyssinia, and Arabia Felix, and
these are the countries whence the curious first brought
them, and from which, by some accident similar to the first,
they may again appear in Egypt.

xiii

Prosper Alpinusâs work then, so far from being a collection
of plants and trees of Egypt, may be said to be a treatise
of plants that are not in Egypt, but by accident; they
are gleanings of natural history from Syria, Arabia, Nubia,
Abyssinia, Persia, Malabar, and Indostan, of which, as far as
I could discern or discover, seven species only remained
when I was in Egypt, mostly trees of such a growth as to
be out of the power of every thing but the ax.

The plant that I shall now speak of, the Papyrus, is a
strong proof of this, and is a remarkable instance of the
violent changes these subjects have undergone in a few
ages. It was at the first the repository of learning and of
record; it was the vehicle of knowledge from one nation
to another; its uses were so extended, that it came to be
even the food of man, and yet we are now disputing what
this plant was, and what was its figure, and whether or
not it is to be found in Egypt.

A gentleman
2
at the head of the literary world, who
from his early years has dedicated himself to the study of
the theory of this science, and at a riper age has travelled
through the world in the more agreeable pursuit of the
practical part of it, hath assured me, that, unless from bad
drawings, he never had an idea of what this plant was till
I first gave him a very fine specimen. The Count de Caylus
says, that having heard there was a specimen of this
plant in Paris, he used his utmost endeavours to find it,
but when brought to him, it appeared to be a cyperus of

xiv

a very common, well-known kind. With my own hands,
not without some labour and risk, I collected specimens
from Syria, from the river Jordan, from two different places
in Upper and Lower Egypt, from the lakes Tzana and
Gooderoo in Abyssinia; and it was with the utmost pleasure
I found they were in every particular intrinsically the
same, without any variation or difference, from what this
plant has been described by the ancients; only I thought
that those of Egypt, the middle of the two extremes, were
stronger, fairer, and fully a foot taller than those in Syria
and Abyssinia.

Of PLANTS, SHRUBS, and TREES.

PAPYRUS.

The
papyrus is a cyperus, called by the Greeks Biblus.
There is no doubt but it was early known in Egypt,
since we learn from Horus Apollo, the Egyptians, wishing
to describe the antiquity of their origin, figured a faggot,
or bundle of papyrus, as an emblem of the food they first
subsisted on, when the use of wheat was not yet known in
that country. But I should rather apprehend that another
plant, hereafter described, and not the papyrus, was what
was substituted for wheat, for though the Egyptians sucked
the honey or sweetness from the root of the papyrus, it does
not appear that any part of this cyperus could be used for
food, nor is it so at this day, though the Ensete, the plant to
which I allude, might, without difficulty, have been used for
bread in early ages before the discovery of wheat; in several
provinces it holds its place at this day.

The papyrus seems to me to have early come down from
Ethiopia, and to have been used in Upper Egypt immediately
after the disuse of hieroglyphics, and the first paper made

2

from this plant was in Seide. By Seide was anciently meant
Upper Egypt, and it is so called to this day; and the Saitic,
probably the oldest language known in Egypt after the
Ethiopic, still subsists, being written in the first character
that succeeded the hieroglyphics in the valley or cultivated
part of Egypt.

Early, however, as the papyrus was known, it does not
appear to me to have ever been a plant that could have existed
in, or, as authors have said, been proper to the river Nile;
its head is too heavy, and in a plain country the wind must
have had too violent a hold of it. The stalk is small and
feeble, and withal too tall, the root too short and slender to
stay it against the violent pressure of the wind and current,
therefore I do constantly believe it never could be a plant
growing in the river Nile itself, or in any very deep or rapid
river.

Pliny
3
, who seems to have considered and known it perfectly
in all its parts, does not pretend that it ever grew in
the body of the Nile itself, but in the calishes or places
where the Nile had overflowed and was stagnant, and
where the water was not above two cubits high. This
observation, I believe, holds good universally, at least it did
so wherever I have seen this plant, either in the overflowed
ground in the Seide, or Upper Egypt, or in Abyssinia
where it never grew in the bed of a river, but generally in
some small stream that issued out of, or into some large
stagnant lake or abandoned water-course. It did not even

3

trust itself to the weight of the wave of the deepest part of
that lake when agitated by the wind, but it grew generally
about the borders of it, as far as the depth of the water was
within a yard.

Pliny says it grew likewise in Syria, and there I saw it
first, before I went into Egypt; it was in the river Jordan,
between the situation of the ancient city Paneas, which
still bears its name, and the lake of Tiberias, which is probably
the lake Pliny alludes to, where he says it grew, and
with it the calamus odoratus, one of the adventitious plants
brought thither formerly by curious men (as I conjecture)
which now exists no more, either in Syria or Egypt. It
was on the left hand of the bridge called the Bridge of the
Sons of Jacob. The river where it grew was two feet nine
inches deep, and it was then increased with rain. It grew
likewise, as Guilandinus
4
tells us, at the confluence of the
Tigris and the Euphrates. I apprehend that it was not
thus propagated into Asia and Greece till the use of it, as
manufactured into paper, was first known.

When that was still admits of some difficulty. Pliny says
that Varro writes it came not into general use till after the
conquest of Egypt by Alexander; yet it is plain from Anacreon
5
,
AlcÃ¦us, Ãschylus, and the comic poets, that it was
known in their time. Plato and Aristotle speak of it also,
so do Herodotus and Theophrastus
6
. We also know it was
of old in use among the Ionians, who probably brought it

4

in very early days directly from Egypt. Numa, too, who lived
300 years before Alexander, is said to have left a number
of books wrote on the papyrus, which a long time after his
death were found at Rome.

All this might very well be; the writers of those early
ages were but few, and those that then were, had all of
them, more or less, connection by their learning with Egypt;
it was to them only Egypt was known, and if they learned to
write there, it was not improbable, that from thence too they
adopted the materials most commodious for writing upon.

With Aristotle began the first arrangement of a library.
Alexanderâs conquest, and the building of Alexandria, laid
open Egypt, its trade and learning, to the world. Papyrus
then, or the paper made from it, was the only materials
made use of for writing upon. A violent desire of amassing
books, and a library, immediately followed, which we may
safely attribute to the example set by Aristotle.

The Ptolemies, and the kings of Pergamus, contended
who should make the largest collection. The Ptolemies,
masters of Egypt and of the papyrus, availed themselves of
this monopoly to hinder the multiplication of books in
Greece. The other princes probably smuggled this plant,
and propagated it wherever it would grow out of Egypt. And
Eumenes king of Pergamus set about bringing to perfection
the manufacture of parchment, which, long before, the Ionians
had used from the scarcity of paper; for whatever resemblance
there might be in names, or whatever may be
inferred from them, writing upon skins or parchment was

5

much more ancient than any city or state in Greece and
in use probably before Greece was inhabited. The Jews
we know made use of it in the earliest ages. At this very
time which we are now speaking of, we learn from Josephus
7
,
that the elders, by order of the high priest, carried
a copy of the law to Ptolemy Philadelphus in letters of
gold upon skins, the pieces of which were so artfully
put together that the joinings did not appear.

The ancients divided this plant into three parts, the head
and the small part of the stalk were cut off, then the woody
part, or bottom, and the root connected with it, and there remained
the middle. All these had separate uses. Pliny
8

says the upper part, which supported the large top itself,
with the flowers upon it, was of no sort of use but to adorn
the temples, and crown the statues of the gods; but it would
seem that it was in use likewise for crowning men of merit.
Plutarch
9
says, that Agesilaus preferred being crowned
with that to any other, on account of its simplicity, and
that parting from the king he had sought to be crowned
with this as a favour, which was granted him. AthenÃ¦us
10
,
on the contrary, laughed at those that mixt roses in the
crown of papyrus, and he says it is as ridiculous as mixing
roses with a crown of garlic. The reason, however, he gives
does not hold, for papyrus itself smells no more of mud, as
he supposes, than a rose-bush; nay, the flower of the papyrus
has something agreeable in its smell, though not so
much so as roses. If he had said that the head of the papyrus

6

resembled withered grass or hay, and made a bad contrast
with the richness and beauty of the rose, he had said well.
But notwithstanding what Pliny has written, the head of the
papyrus was employed, not only to make crowns for statues
of the gods, but also to make cables for ships. We are told
that Antigonus made use of nothing else for ropes and cables
to his fleets, before the use of spartum, or bent-grass, was
known, which, though very little better, still serves that purpose
in small ships on the coast of Provence to this day.
The top of the papyrus was likewise used for sewing and
caulking the vessels, by forcing it into the seams, and afterwards
covering it with pitch.

Pliny
11
tells us, that the whole plant together was used
for making boats, a piece of the acacia tree being put in the
bottom to serve as the keel, to which plants were joined, being
first sewed together, then gathered up at stem and stern, and
the ends of the plant tied fast there, âConseritur bibula
Memphitis cymba papyro;â and this is the only boat they
still have in Abyssinia, which they call Tancoa, and from
the use of these it is that Isaiah describes the nations, probably
the Egyptians, upon whom the vengeance of God was
speedily to fall. I imagine also that the junks of the Red
Sea, said to be of leather, were first built with papyrus and
covered with skins. In these the Homerites trafficked
with their friends the Sabeans across the mouth of the Red
Sea, but they can never persuade me, however generally
and confidently it has been asserted, that vessels of this
kind could have lived an hour upon the Indian ocean.

7

The bottom, root, or woody part of this plant, was likewise
of several uses before it turned absolutely hard; it was
chewed in the manner of liquorice, having a considerable
quantity of sweet juice in it. This we learn from Dioscorides;
it was, I suppose, chewed, and the sweetness sucked
out in the same manner as is done with sugar-cane. This is
still practised in Abyssinia, where they likewise chew the
root of the Indian corn, and of every kind of cyperus; and
Herodotus tells us, that about a cubit of the lower part of
the stalk was cut off and roasted over the fire, and eaten.

From the scarcity of wood, which was very great in Egypt
for the reasons I have already mentioned, this lower part
was likewise used in making cups, moulds, and other necessary
utensils; we need not doubt too, one use of the
woody part of this plant was to serve for what we call
boards or covers for binding the leaves, which were made
of the bark; we know that this was anciently one use of
it, both from AlcÃ¦us and Anacreon.

In a large and very perfect manuscript in my possession,
which was dug up at Thebes, the boards are of papyrus
root, covered first with the coarser pieces of the paper, and
then with leather, in the same manner as it would be done
now. It is a book one would call a small folio, rather than
by any other name, and I apprehend that the shape of the
book where papyrus is employed was always of the same
form with those of the moderns. The letters are strong,
deep, black, and apparently written with a reed, as is practised
by the Egyptians and Abyssinians still. It is written on
both sides, so never could be rolled up as parchment was,
nor would the brittleness of the materials when dry, support

8

any such frequent unrolling. This probably arises
from their having first written upon papyrus, after the use
of stone was laid aside, and only adopted skins upon their
embracing the Jewish religion. The Ethiopians, indeed,
write upon parchment, yet use the same form of books as
we do. The outer boards are made of wood and covered
with leather. It was the law only they say they were in
use to preserve in one long roll of parchment, upon the foreside
of which it was written; it being indecent and improper
to write any part of it on the back, or a less honourable
place of the skin: And such was the roll we have just
mentioned as presented to Ptolemy, where such pains were
taken in joining the several skins together, for this very
reason.

The manner paper was made has been controverted; but
whoever will read Pliny
12
attentively, cannot, as I imagine,
be long in doubt. The thick part of the stalk being cut in
half, the pellicle between the pith and the bark, or perhaps
the two pellicles, were stript off, and divided by an iron instrument,
which probably was sharp-pointed, but did not
cut at the edges. This was squared at the sides so as to be
like a ribband, then laid upon a smooth table or dresser, after
being cut into the length that it was required the leaf
should be. These stripes, or ribbands of papyrus, were
lapped over each other by a very thin border, and then
pieces of the same kind were laid transversely, the length
of these answering to the breadth of the first. The book

9

which I have is eleven inches and a half long, and seven
inches broad, and there is not one leaf in it that has a ribband
of papyrus of two inches and a half broad, from
which I imagine the size of this plant, formerly being
fifteen feet long, was pretty near the truth. No such plant,
however, appears now; I do not remember to have ever seen
one more than ten feet high. This is probably owing to
their being allowed to grow wild, and too thick together,
without being weeded; we know from Herodotus
13
, that
the Egyptians cut theirs down yearly as they did their harvest.

These ribbands, or stripes of papyrus, have twelve different
names in Pliny
14
, which is to be copious with a vengeance.
They are, philura, ramentum; scheda, cutis, plagula,
corium, tÃ¦nia, subtegmen, statumen, pagina, tabula, and
papyrus. After these, by whatever name you call them,
were arranged at right angles to each other, a weight was
placed upon them while moist, which compressed them,
and so they were suffered to dry in the sun.

It was supposed that the water of the Nile
15
had a gummy
quality necessary to glue these stripes together. This
we may be assured is without foundation, no such quality
being found in the water of the Nile. On the contrary, I
found it of all others the most improper, till it had settled,
and was absolutely divested of all the earth gathered in its
turbid state. I made several pieces of this paper, both in

10

Abyssinia and Egypt, and it appears to me, that the sugar
or sweetness with which the whole juice of this plant is
impregnated, is the matter that causes the adhesion of these
stripes together, and that the use of the water is no more
than to dissolve this, and put it perfectly and equally in
fusion.

There seemed to be an advantage in putting the inside
of the pellicle in the situation that it was before divided,
that is, the interior parts face to face, one long-ways, and
one cross-ways, after which a thin board of the cover of a
book was laid first over it, and a heap of stones piled upon
it. I do not think it succeeded with boiled water, and it
was always coarse and gritty with the water of the Nile.
Some pieces were excellent, made with water that had settled,
that is, in the state in which we drink it; but even
the best of it was always thick and heavy, drying very soon,
then turning firm and rigid, and never white; nor did I
ever find one piece that would bear the strokes of a mallet
16
,
but in its greenest state the blow shivered and divided
the fibres length-ways; nor did I see the marks of any
stroke of a hammer or mallet in the book in my custody,
which is certainly on Saitic or Hieratic paper. I apprehend
by a passage in Pliny
17
, that the mallet was used only when

11

artificial glue or gum was made use of, which must have
been as often as they let these stripes of the ribband or
pellicle dry before arranging them.

Pliny
18
says, the books of Numa were 830 years old
when they were found, and he wonders, from the brittleness
of the inside of the paper, it could have lasted so long.
The manuscript in my possession, which was dug up at
Thebes, I conjecture is near three times the age that Pliny
mentions; and, though it is certainly fragil, has substance
and preservation of letter enough, with good care, to last as
much longer, and be legible.

If the Saitic paper was, as we imagine, the first invented,
it should follow, contrary to what Isidore advances,
that it was not first invented in Memphis, but in Upper
Egypt in Seide, whose language and writing obtained in
the earliest age, though Lucan seems to think with Isidore,

Nondum flumineas Memphis contexere biblos

Noverat.
——

Lucan
, lib. iii.

After the hieroglyphics were lost, perhaps some time before,
we know nothing the Egyptians adopted so generally
as paper, and there were probably
19
religious reasons that
impeded in those early days the people from falling upon

12

the most natural, the skins of beasts. However this be,
it is certain under the Egyptians, naturally averse to novelty
and improvement, paper arrived to no great perfection till
taken in hands by the Romans. The Charta Claudia was
thirteen inches wide, the Hieratica, or Saitica, eleven, and
such is the length of the leaf of my book in the Saitic dialect,
that is, the old Coptic, or Egyptian of Upper Egypt. I have
no idea what the Emporetic paper was, which obtained that
degree of coarseness and toughness, as to serve for shopkeepersâ
uses to tie up goods, unless it was like our brown paper
employed to the same purposes.

If the date of the invention of this useful art of making
paper is doubtful, the time when it was lost, or superseded
by one more convenient, is as uncertain. Eustathius says
it was disused in his time in the 1170. Mabillon endeavours
to prove it existed in the 9th, and even that there existed
some Popish bulls wrote upon it as late as the 11th century.
He gives, as instances, a part of St Markâs Gospel preserved
at Venice as being upon papyrus, and the fragment of Josephus
at Milan to be cotton paper, while Maffei proves this
to be just the reverse, that of St Mark being cotton, and the
other indisputably he thinks to be Egyptian papyrus, so that
Mabillonâs authority as to the bulls of the pope may be fairly
questioned.

The several times I have been at these places mentioned,
I have never succeeded in seeing any of these pieces; that of
St Mark at Venice I was assured had been recognized to be
cotton paper; it was rendered not legible by the warm saliva
of zealots kissing it from devotion, which I can easily
comprehend must contain a very corrosive quality, and the

13

Venetians now refuse to shew it more. I have seen two
detached leaves of papyrus, but do not believe there is another
book existing at the present time but that in my possession,
which is very perfect. I gave Dr Woide leave to
translate it at Lord Northâs desire; it is a gnostic book, full of
their dreams.

The general figure of this plant Pliny has rightly said to
resemble a Thyrsus; the head is composed of a number of
small grassy filaments, each about a foot long. About
the middle, each of these filaments parts into four, and in
the point, or partition, are four branches of flowers; the head
of this is not unlike an ear of wheat in form, but which in
fact is but a chaffy, silky, soft husk. These heads, or flowers,
grow upon the stalk alternately, and are not opposite to, or
on the same line with each other at the bottom.

Pliny
20
says it has no seed; but this we may be assured is
an absurdity. The form of the flower sufficiently indicates
that it was made to resolve itself into the covering of one,
which is certainly very small, and by its exalted situation,
and thickness of the head of the flower, seems to have needed
the extraordinary covering it has had to protect it from
the violent hold the wind must have had upon it. For the
same reason, the bottom of the filaments composing the
head are sheathed in four concave leaves, which keep them
close together, and prevent injury from the wind getting
in between them.

14

The stalk is of a vivid green, thickest at the bottom, and
tapering up to the top
21
; it is of a triangular form. In the
Jordan, the single side, or apex of the triangle, stood opposed
to the stream as the cut-water of a boat or ship, or the sharp
angle of a buttress of a bridge, by which the pressure of
the stream upon the stalk would be greatly diminished. I
do not precisely remember how it stood in the lakes in Ethiopia
and Egypt, and only have this remark in the notes I
made at the Jordan.

This construction of the stalk of the papyrus seems to reproach
Aristotle with want of observation. He says that no
plant had either triangular or quadrangular stalks. Here we
see an instance of the contrary in the papyrus, whose stalk
is certainly and universally triangular; and we learn from
Dioscorides that many more have quadrangular stalks, or
stems of four angles.

It has but one root, which is large and strong
22
, Pliny
says, as thick as a manâs arm: So it was, probably, when
the plant was fifteen feet high, but it is now diminished in
proportion, the whole length of the stalk, comprehending
the head, being a little above ten, but the root is still hard
and solid near the heart, and works with the turning loom
tolerably well, as it did formerly when they made cups of it.
In the middle of this long root arises the stalk at right angles,
so when inverted it has the figure of a T, and on each side
of the large root there are smaller elastic ones, which are of
a direction perpendicular to it, and which, like the strings of

15

a tent, steady it and fix it to the earth at the bottom. About
two feet, or little more, of the lower part of the stalk is
cloathed with long, hollow, sword-shaped leaves, which cover
each other like scales, and fortify the foot of the plant.
They are of a dusky brown, or yellow colour. I suppose the
stalk was cut off below, at about where these leaves end.

The drawing represents the papyrus as growing. The
head is not upright, but is inclined, as from its size it always
must be in hot countries, in which alone it grows. In all
such climates, there is some particular wind that reigns
longer than others, and this being always the most violent,
as well as the most constant, gives to heavy-headed trees, or
plants, an inclination contrary to that from which it
blows.

This plant is called el Berdi in Egypt, which signifies nothing
in Arabic, and I suppose is old Egyptian. I have been
told by a learned gentleman
23
, that in Syria it is known by
the name of Babeer, which approaches more to the sound of
papyrus, and paper; this I never heard myself, but leave it
entirely upon his authority.

BALESSAN, BALM, or BALSAM.

The
great value set upon this drug in the east remounts
to very early ages; it is coeval with the India
trade for pepper, and the beginning of it consequently
lost in the darkness of the first ages. We know from
scripture, the oldest history extant, as well as most infallible,
that the Ishmaelites, or Arabian carriers and merchants, trafficking
with the India commodities into Egypt, brought with
them balm as part of the cargo with pepper; but the price
that they paid for Joseph was silver, and not a barter with
any of their articles of merchandise.

Strabo alone, of all the ancients, hath given us the true
account of the place of its origin, âNear to this, that historian
says, is the most happy land of the Sabeans, and they are
a very great people. Among these, frankincense, myrrh,
and cinnamon grow, and in the coast that is about Saba
the balsam also.â Among the myrrh-trees behind Azab

17

all along the coast to the Straits of Babelmandeb is its native
country. It grows to a tree above fourteen feet high,
spontaneously and without culture, like the myrrh, the coffee,
and frankincense tree; they are all equally the wood of the
country, and are occasionally cut down and used for fuel.
We need not doubt but that it was early transplanted into
Arabia, that is, into the south part of Arabia Felix, immediately
fronting Azab, the place of its nativity. The high
country of Arabia was too cold to receive it, being all
mountainous; water freezes there.

Balessan

Balessan.

There is an anecdote relating to Sir William Middleton,
who was surprised and taken prisoner by the Turks in the
first attempt to open the trade of the Red Sea, that when
about to set
24
out for Sanaa, corruptly called Zenan, the residence
of the Imam, or prince of Arabia Felix, he was by
the people desired
25
to take his fur cloak along with him to
keep him from the cold; he thought they were ridiculing
him upon what he had to suffer from the approaching
heat, which he was convinced in the middle of Arabia
must be excessive.

The first plantation that succeeded seems to have been
at Petra, the ancient metropolis of Arabia, now called Beder,
or Beder Hunein, whence I got one of the specimens from
which the present drawing is made.

Josephus
26
, in the history of the antiquities of his country,
says, that a tree of this balsam was brought to Jerusalem by

18

the queen of Saba, and given, among other presents, to Solomon,
who, as we know from scripture, was very studious
of all sort of plants, and skilful in the description and distinction
of them. Here it seems to have been cultivated
and to have thriven, so that the place of its origin came to
be forgotten.

Notwithstanding this positive authority of Josephus,
and the great probability that attends it, we are not to put
it in competition with what we have been told from scripture,
as we have just now seen, that the place where it grew, and
was sold to merchants, was Gilead in Judea, more than 1730
years before Christ, or 1000 before the queen of Saba; so
that reading the verse, nothing can be more plain than that
it had been transplanted into Judea, flourished, and had become
an article of commerce in Gilead long before the period
Josephus mentions: âAnd they sat down to eat bread, and
they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company
of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels,
bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry it
down to Egypt
27
.â Now, the spicery, or pepper, was certainly
purchased by the Ishmaelites at the mouth of the Red Sea,
where was the market for Indian goods, and at the same
place they must have bought the myrrh, for that neither
grew nor grows any where else than in Saba or Azabo
east to Cape Gardefan, where were the ports for India, and
whence it was dispersed all over the world.

19

The Ishmaelites, or Arabian carriers, loaded their camels
at the mouth of the Red Sea with pepper and myrrh. For
reasons not now known to us, they went and completed their
cargo with balsam at Gilead, so that, contrary to the authority
of Josephus, nothing is more certain, than 1730 years before
Christ, and 1000 years before the queen of Saba came
to Jerusalem, the balsam-tree had been transplanted from
Abyssinia into Judea, and become an article of commerce
there, and the place from which it originally was brought,
through length of time, combined with other reasons, came
to be forgotten.

Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny, Solinus,and Serapion,
all say that this balsam came only from Judea. The words
of Pliny are, âBut to all other odours whatever, the balsam
is preferred, produced in no other part but the land of
Judea, and even there in two gardens only; both of
them belonging to the king, one no more than twenty
acres, the other still smaller
28
.â

At this time I suppose it got its name of Balsamum Judaicum,
or, Balm of Gilead, and thence became an article
in merchandise and fiscal revenue, which probably occasioned
the discouragement of bringing it any more from
Arabia, whence it very probably was prohibited as contraband.
We shall suppose thirty acres planted with this tree
would have produced more than all the trees in Arabia do
at this day. Nor does the plantation of Beder Hunein

20

amount to much more than that quantity, for we are still to
observe, that even when it had been as it were naturalised
in Judea, and acquired a name in the country, still it bore
evident marks of its being a stranger there; and its being
confined to two royal gardens alone, shews it was maintained
there by force and culture, and was by no means a native
of the country. And this is confirmed by Strabo, who
speaks of it being in the kingâs palace or garden at Jericho.
This place being one of the warmest in Judea, shews likewise
their apprehensions about it, so that in Judea, we may
imagine it was pretty much in the state of our myrtles in
England, which, though cultivated in green-houses in all
the rest of the island, yet grow beautifully and luxuriantly
in Devonshire and Cornwall, the western parts of it.

Diodorus Siculus says, it grew in a valley in Arabia Felix;
he should have said on a number of gentle, sloping hills
in Arabia Deserta, which have a very small degree of elevation
above the plain, but by no means resemble a valley.
This place was the scene of three bloody battles between
Mahomet and his kinsmen the Beni Koreish, who refused
to be converts to his religion, or acknowledge his divine
legation. These are at large described by several of the historians
of that nation, with circumstances and anecdotes,
as well interesting and entertaining, as elegantly told. They
shew plainly that Mahometâs tribe, the Beni Koreish, did not
receive their fanatical manners and disposition from Mahomet
and his religion, but were just as obstinate, ignorant, and
sanguinary when they were Pagans, as they were afterwards
when converted and became Mahometans. The last of these
battles, which was decisive in Mahometâs favour, gave him
the sovereignty of Mecca, and was attended with the extirpation
of some of the principal families in this tribe.

21

At this time the balsam is supposed, by being sold in Judea,
and not accessible by reason of the commotions in Arabia,
to have become almost forgotten in that last part,
where the trade from Abyssinia, its native country, was likewise
interrupted by this innovation of religion, and by Mahometâs
profanation of the Caaba, or temple of the sun, the
ancient resort of the Sabean merchants carrying on the trade
of India. This interval the impostor thought proper for a
pretended miracle; he said, that, from the blood of the Beni
Koreish slain, there had sprung up this grove of trees, from
the juice of which all the true believers on his side received
a cure for their wounds, however fatal they appeared, nay,
some of them were revived from even death itself. Since
that time it has maintained its reputation equal to that which
it had in antiquity.

Prosper Alpinus says, that one Messoner a eunuch, governor
of Cairo in the year 1519, caused bring from Arabia
forty plants, which he placed in the garden of Mattareah,
where he superintended them. Every day he went to that
garden to pay his devotions to the Virgin Mary. It was
many times renewed, and has as often perished since. Bellonius
says, that in his time there were ten plants at Mattareah,
and he is of opinion, that in all ages they grew
well in Arabia, which is not true, for those at Beder are
constantly supplied with new plants so soon as the old
ones decay. There was none existing at Mattareah the
two several times I visited Cairo, but there were some of
the Christians still living there that remembered one plant
in that garden.

22

There were three productions from this tree very much
esteemed among the ancients. The first was called Opobalsamum,
or, Juice of the Balsam, which was the finest kind,
composed of that greenish liquor found in the kernel of
the fruit: The next was Carpo-balsamum, made by the expression
of the fruit when in maturity. The third was
Xylo-balsamum, the worst of all, it was an expression or decoction
of the small new twigs of a reddish colour. These
twigs are still gathered in little faggots and sent to Venice,
where I am told they are an ingredient in the Theriac, or
of some sort of compound drug made in the laboratories
there: But the principal quantity of balsam in all times
was produced by incision, as it is at this day. Concerning
this, too, many fables have been invented and propagated.

Tacitus says, that this tree was so averse to iron that
it trembled upon a knife being laid near it, and some pretend
the incision should be made by ivory, glass, or stone.
There is no doubt but the more attention there is given
to it, and the cleaner the wound is made, the better this
balsam will be. It is now, as it probably ever has been,
cut by an ax, when the juice is in its strongest circulation
in July, August, and beginning of September. It is then
received into a small earthen bottle, and every dayâs produce
gathered and poured into a larger, which is kept closely corked.
The Arabs Harb, a noble family of Beni Koreish, are the
proprietors of it, and of Beder, where it grows. It is a station
of the Emir Hadje, or pilgrims going to Mecca, half way
between that city and Medina.

Some books speak of a white sort brought by the caravans
from Mecca, and called Balsam of Mecca, and others

23

a balsam called that of Judea, but all these are counterfeits
or adulterations. The balsam of Judea, which I have already
mentioned, was long ago lost, when the troubles of
that country withdrew the royal attention from it; but, as
late as Galenâs time, it not only existed, but was growing
in many places of Palestine besides Jericho, and there is no doubt
but it is now totally lost there.

When Sultan Selim made the conquest of Egypt and Arabia
in the year 1516, three pound was then the tribute ordered
to be sent to Constantinople yearly, and this proportion
is kept up to this day. One pound is due to the governor
of Cairo, one pound to the Emir Hadje who conducts the
pilgrims to Mecca, half a pound to the basha of Damascus,
and several smaller quantities to other officers, after which,
the remainder is sold or farmed out to some merchants,
who, to increase the quantity, adulterate it with oil of
olives and wax, and several other mixtures, consulting only
the agreement of colour, without considering the aptitude
in mixing; formerly we were told it was done with art, but
nothing is easier detected than this fraud now.

It does not appear to me, that the ancients had ever seen
this plant, they describe it so variously; some will have it
a tree, some a shrub, and some a plant only; and Prosper
Alpinus, a modern, corroborates the errors of the ancients,
by saying it is a kind of vine, (viticosus). The figure he
has given of it is a very bad one, and leaves us entirely in
doubt in what class to place it. The defect of the plant in
Judea and in Egypt, and the contradiction in the description
of the ancients as to its figure and resemblance, occasioned

24

a doubt that the whole plants in these two countries, and
Arabia also, had been lost in the desolation occasioned by
the Mahometan conquest; and a warm dispute arose between
the Venetians and Romans, whether the drug used by the
former in the Theriac was really and truly the old genuine
opobalsamum? The matter was referred to the pope, who
directed proper inquiry to be made in Egypt, which turned
out entirely in favour of the Venetians, and the opobalsamum
continuing as formerly.

A very learned and tedious treatise was published by
Veslingius, in the year 1643, at Padua, where this affair
was discussed at full length. As both parties of the disputants
seem to argue concerning what it is from the misunderstood
reports of what it was, I shall content myself briefly
with stating what the qualities of the opobalsamum are,
without taking pains to refute the opinions of those that
have reported what the opobalsamum is not.

The opobalsamum, or juice flowing from the balsam-tree,
at first when it is received into the bottle or vase
from the wound from whence it issues, is of a light, yellow
colour, apparently turbid, in which there is a whitish
cast, which I apprehend are the globules of air that pervade
the whole of it in its first state of fermentation; it then appears
very light upon shaking. As it settles and cools, it
turns clear, and loses that milkiness which it first had when
flowing from the tree into the bottle. It then has the colour
of honey, and appears more fixed and heavy than at
first. After being kept for years, it grows a much deeper
yellow, and of the colour of gold. I have some of it, which,
as I have already mentioned in my travels, I got from the

25

Cadi of Medina in the year 1768; it is now still deeper in colour,
full as much so as the yellowest honey. It is perfectly
fluid, and has lost very little either of its taste, smell, or
weight. The smell at first is violent and strongly pungent,
giving a sensation to the brain like to that of volatile salts
when rashly drawn up by an incautious person. This lasts
in proportion to its freshness, for being neglected, and the
bottle uncorked, it quickly loses this quality, as it probably
will at last by age, whatever care is taken of it.

In its pure and fresh state it dissolves easily in water.
If dropt on a woollen cloth, it will wash out easily, and
leaves no stain. It is of an acrid, rough, pungent taste,
is used by the Arabs in all complaints of the stomach
and bowels, is reckoned a powerful antiseptic, and of use in
preventing any infection of the plague. These qualities it
now enjoys, in all probability, in common with the various
balsams we have received from the new world, such as the
balsam of Tolu, of Peru, and the rest; but it is always used,
and in particular esteemed by the ladies, as a cosmetic: As
such it has kept up its reputation in the east to this very day.
The manner of applying it is this; you first go into the tepid
bath till the pores are sufficiently opened, you then anoint
yourself with a small quantity, and, as much as the
vessels will absorb; never-fading youth and beauty are said
to be the consequences of this. The purchase is easy enough.
I do not hear that it ever has been thought restorative after
the loss of either.

The figure I have here given of the balsam may be depended
upon, as being carefully drawn, after an exact examination,

26

from two very fine trees brought from Beder
Hunein; the first by the Cadi of Medina at Yambo; the second
at Jidda, by order of Yousef Kabil, vizir or minister to
the sherriffe of Mecca. The first was so deliberately executed,
that the second seemed of no service but to confirm
me in the exactitude of the first. The tree was 5 feet 2
inches high from where the red root begins, or which was
buried in the earth, to where it divides itself first into
branches. The trunk at thickest was about 5 inches diameter,
the wood light and open, and incapable of polishing, covered
with a smooth bark of bluish-white, like to a standard
cherry-tree in good health, which has not above half that
diameter; indeed a part of the bark is a reddish brown; it
flattens at top like trees that are exposed to snow-blasts or
sea-air, which gives it a stunted appearance. It is remarkable
for a penury of leaves. The flowers are like that of
the acacia-tree, white and round, only that three hang upon
three filaments, or stalks, where the acacia has but one.
Two of these flowers fall off and leave a single fruit; the
branches that bear this are the shoots of the present year;
they are of a reddish colour, and tougher than the old wood:
it is these that are cut off and put into little faggots, and
sent to Venice for the Theriac, when bruised or drawn by
fire, and formerly these made the Xylo-balsamum.

Concerning the vipers which, Pliny says, were frequent
among the balsam trees I made very particular inquiry;
several were brought me alive, both to Yambo and Jidda.
Of these I shall speak in another place, when I give the
figure, and an account of that animal so found.

27

SASSA, MYRRH, and OPOCALPASUM.

At
the time when I was on the borders of the Tal-Tal,
or Troglodyte country, I sought to procure myself
branches and bark of the myrrh-tree, enough preserved to
be able to describe it and make a design; but the length and
ruggedness of the way, the heat of the weather, and the
carelessness and want of resources of naked savages always
disappointed me. In those goat-skin bags into which I had
often ordered them to put small branches, I always found
the leaves mostly in powder; some few that were entire seemed
to resemble much the acacia vera, but were wider towards
the extremity, and more pointed immediately at the
end. In what order the leaves grew I never could determine.
The bark was absolutely like that of the acacia vera;
and among the leaves I often met with a small, straight,
weak thorn, about two inches long.

These were all the circumstances I could combine relative
to the myrrh-tree, too vague and uncertain to risk a
drawing upon, when there still remained so many desiderata
concerning it; and as the king was obstinate not to let me

28

go thither after what had happened to the surgeonâs mate
and boatâs crew of the Elgin Indiaman
29
, I was obliged to
abandon the drawing of the myrrh-tree to some more fortunate
traveller, after having in vain attempted to procure
it at Azab, as I have already mentioned.

At the same time that I was taking these pains about
the myrrh, I had desired the savages to bring me all the
gums they could find, with the branches and bark of the
trees that produced them. They brought me at different
times some very fine pieces of incense, and at another time
a very small quantity of a bright colourless gum, sweeter on
burning than incense, but no branches of either tree,
though I found this latter afterwards in another part of
Abyssinia. But at all times they procured me quantities of
gum of an even and close grain, and of a dark brown colour,
which was produced by a tree called Sassa, and twice
I received branches of this tree in tolerable order, and of
these I made a drawing.

Some weeks after, while walking at Emfras, a Mahometan
village, whose inhabitants are myrrh merchants, I saw a
large tree with the whole upper part of the trunk, and the
large branches, so covered with bosses and knobs of gum, as
to appear monstrously deformed, and inquiring farther about
this tree, I found that it had been brought, many years before,
from the myrrh country, by merchants, and planted
there for the sake of its gum, with which these Mahometans
stiffened the blue Surat cloths they got damaged from Mocha,
to trade in with the Galla and Abyssinians. Neither

29

the origin of the tree which they called Sassa, nor the gum,
could allow me to doubt a moment that it was the same as
what had been brought to me from the myrrh country, but
I had the additional satisfaction to find the tree all covered over
with beautiful crimson flowers of a very extraordinary and
strange construction. I began then a drawing anew, with
all that satisfaction known only to those who have been conversant
in such discoveries.

I took pieces of the gum with me; it is very light. Galen
complains that, in his time, the myrrh was often mixed
with a drug which he calls Opocalpasum, by a Greek name,
but what the drug was is totally unknown to us at this
day, as nothing similar to the Greek name is found in the
language of the country. But as the only view of the savage,
in mixing another gum with his myrrh, must have
been to increase the quantity, and as the great plenty in
which this gum is produced, and its colour, make it very
proper for this use, and above all, as there is no reason to
think there is another gum-bearing tree of equal qualities
in the country where the myrrh grows, it seems to me next
to a proof, that this must have been the opocalpasum of
Galen.

I must however confess, that Galen says the opocalpasum
was so far from being an innocent drug, that it
was a mortal poison, and had produced very fatal effects.
But as those Troglodytes, though now more ignorant
than formerly, are still well acquainted with the properties
of their herbs and trees, it is not possible that the
savage, desiring to increase his sales, would mix them

30

with a poison that must needs diminish them. And we may
therefore without scruple suppose that Galen was mistaken
in the quality ascribed to this drug, and that he might have
imagined, from tenderness to the profession, that people
died of the opocalpasum who perhaps really died of the
physician: First, Because we know of no gum or resin that
is a mortal poison: Secondly, Because, from the construction
of its parts, gum could not have the activity which violent
poison has; and considering the small quantities in which
myrrh is taken, and the opocalpasum could have been but
in an inconsiderable proportion to the myrrh, to have killed,
it must have been a very active poison indeed: Thirdly,
these accidents from a known cause must have brought
myrrh into disuse, as certainly as the Spaniards mixing arsenic
with bark would banish that drug when we saw people
die of it. Now this never was the case, it maintained its
character among the Greeks and the Arabs, and so down to
our days; and a modern physician, Van Helmont, thinks
it might make man immortal if it could be rendered perfectly
soluble in the human body. Galen then was mistaken
as to the poisonous quality of the opocalpasum. The
Greek physician knew little of the Natural History of Arabia,
less still of that of Abyssinia, and we who have followed
them know nothing of either.

This gum being put into water, swells and turns white,
and loses all its glue; it very much resembles gum adragant
in quality, and may be eaten safely. This specimen
came from the Troglodyte country in the year 1771. The
Sassa, the tree which produces the opocalpasum, does not
grow in Arabia. Arabian myrrh is easily known from Abyssinian

31

by the following method: Take a handful of the
smallest pieces found at the bottom of the basket where the
myrrh was packed, and throw them into a plate, and just
cover them with water a little warm, the myrrh will remain
for some time without visible alteration, for it dissolves
slowly, but the gum will swell to five times its original
size, and appear so many white spots amidst the myrrh.

Emfras, as I have said, is a large village something more
than twenty miles south from Gondar, situated upon the
face of a hill of considerable height above the lake Tzana,
of which, and all its islands, it has a very distinct and pleasant
view; it is divided from the lake by a large plain, near
which is the island of Mitraha, one of the burying-places of
the kings. The inhabitants of the lower town, close on the
banks of the small river Arno, are all Mahometans, many
of them men of substance, part of them the kingâs tent-makers,
who follow the camp, and pitch his tents in the
field; the others are merchants to the myrrh and frankincense
country, that is, from the east parallel of the kingdom
of Dancali to the point Cape Gardefan, or Promontorium
Aromatum; they also bring salt from the plains, on the
west of the kingdom of Dancali, where fossile salt is dug;
it is on the S. E. border of the kingdom of TigrÃ©. These
Mahometans trade also to the Galla, to the westward of the
Nile; their principal commodity is myrrh and damaged cargoes
of blue Surat cloth, which they unfold and clean, then
stiffen them with gum, and fold them in form of a book as
when they were new.

This gum, which is called Sassa, they at first brought
from the myrrh country behind Azab, till ingenious and

32

sagacious people had carried plants of the tree to their different
villages, where they have it growing in great perfection,
and more than supply the uses of the merchants.

This tree grows to a great height, not inferior to that of
an English elm; that from which this draught was made
was about two feet diameter; the gum grows on all sides of
the trunk, in quantity enough almost to cover it, in form
of large globes, and so it does on all the principal branches.
These lumps are sometimes so large as to weigh two pound,
though naturally very light.

The bark of the tree is thin and of a bluish colour, not
unlike that of a cherry-tree when young, or rather whiter.
The wood is white and hard, only the young branches
which carry the flower are red. The leaves are joined to
the sides of the small branches by a small pedicle of considerable
strength, the leaves are two and two, or opposite to
each other, and have no single leaf at the point; they are
strongly varnished both on one side and the other, the back
rather lighter than the foreside of the leaf. The branches
that carry the leaves have about an inch of the stalk bare,
where it is fixed to the larger branch. There are generally
fourteen leaves, each of about three quarters of an inch
long. At the top of the branch are knots out of which
come three small stalks, bare for about an inch and a half,
then having a number of small tubes, which, when they
open at the top, put forth a long pistil from the bottom of
the tube. The top of the tube, divided into five segments,
or petals, arrives about one third up the pistil, and makes
the figure of a calix or perianthium to it. From this tube
proceeds a great number of very small capillaments of a

33

pink colour, at the end of each of which hangs a purple
stigma. At the top of this pistil is a large bunch of still
finer fibres, or capillaments, with stigmata likewise, and at
the end the pistil is rounded as if forming a fruit; without
a very distinct drawing, it would be difficult to make a description
that should be intelligible.

Nothing can be more beautiful, or more compounded,
than the formation of this flower, though it has no odour;
the head is composed of about thirty of these small branches
now described, which make a very beautiful mass, and
is of a pink colour of different shades. At sun-set, the
leaves on each side of the branch shut face to face like the
sensitive tribe. I never saw any seed or fruit that it bore,
nor any thing like the rudiments of seed, unless it be that
very small rotundity that appears at the end of the pistil,
which seem to bear no proportion to so large a tree.

ERGETT YâDIMMO.

The
two beautiful shrubs which I have here given to
the reader are called by the name of Ergett, which we
may suppose, in Abyssinian botany, to be the generic name
of the mimosa, as both of these have the same name, and
both of the same family, of which there are many varieties
in Abyssinia.

This first is called the Bloody Ergett, as we may suppose
from the pink filaments of which this beautiful and uncommon
flower is in part composed, and which we may
therefore call Mimosa Sanguinea. The upper part of the
flower is composed of curled, yellow filaments, and the bottom
a pink of the same structure. I never saw it in any other
state. Before the blossoms spread it appears in the
form here exhibited. The pink, or lower part, in its unripe
state, is composed of green tubercules, larger and more detached
than where the yellow flower is produced, whose tubercules
are smaller and closer set together. I need not say the

35

leaves are of the double pinnated kind, as that and every thing
else material can be learned from the figure, full as perfectly
as if the flower was before them; none of the parts, however
trifling and small, being neglected in the representation,
and none of them supposed or placed there out of order,
for ornament, or any other cause whatever: a rule which I
would have the reader be persuaded is invariably observed
in every article represented in this collection, whether tree or
plant, beast, bird, or fish.

ERGETT EL KRONE.

The
next of this species of Ergett or Mimosa, is called in
Abyssinia Ergett el Krone, or the Horned Ergett; I apprehend
the figure of the pods have given it that appellation.
Its flower in size and form very much resembles
the acacia vera, only that it is attached to the branch
by a long and strong woody stalk, which grows out at the
bottom of the branch bearing the leaves, and is sheltered
as in a case by the lower part of it. The branches of it are
all covered with very short, strong, sharp-pointed thorns,

36

whose point is inclined backward towards the root. Its pods
are covered with a prickly kind of hair, which, when touched,
stick in your fingers and give very uneasy sensations. The
pods are divided into thirteen divisions, in each of which
are three round seeds, hard and shining, of a dusky brownish
colour. The flower has scarcely any smell, nor do I
know that it is of any utility whatever. Both these beautiful
shrubs were found upon the banks of the river Arno,
between Emfras and the lake Tzana. The soil is black
mould, with a great mixture or composition of rotten putrified
leaves, thinly covering the rock in the temperate
part of Abyssinia. What I have to observe of both these
shrubs is, that they shut their leaves upon the violent rains
of winter, and are never fully expanded till the sun and
fair season again return.

ENSETE.

The
Ensete is an herbaceous plant. It is said to be a native
of Narea, and to grow in the great swamps and
marshes in that country, formed by many rivers rising there,

37

which have little level to run to either ocean. It is said that
the Galla, when transplanted into Abyssinia, brought for
their particular use the coffee-tree, and the Ensete, the use
of neither of which were before known. However, the general
opinion is, that both are naturally produced in every
part of Abyssinia, provided there is heat and moisture. It
grows and comes to great perfection at Gondar, but it most
abounds in that part of Maitsha and Goutto west of the Nile,
where there are large plantations of it, and is there almost,
exclusive of any thing else, the food of the Galla inhabiting
that province; Maitsha is nearly upon a dead level, and the
rains have not slope to get off easily, but stagnate and prevent
the sowing of grain. Vegetable food would therefore
be very scarce in Maitsha, were it not for this plant.

Some who have seen my drawing of this plant, and at the
same time found the banana in many parts of the east,
have thought the Ensete to be a species of the Musa. This
however, I imagine, is without any sort of reason. It is true,
the leaf of the banana resembles that of the Ensete, it bears
figs, and has an excrescence from its trunk, which is
terminated by a conical figure, chiefly differing from the
Ensete in size and quantity of parts, but the figs of the
banana are in shape of a cucumber, and this is the
part which is eaten. This fig is sweet though mealy, and
of a taste highly agreeable. It is supposed to have no seeds,
though in fact there are four small black seeds in every fig
belonging to it. But the figs of the Ensete are not eatable;
they are of a tender, soft substance; watery, tasteless, and in
colour and consistence similar to a rotten apricot; they are
of a conical form, crooked a little at the lower end, about
an inch and a half in length, and an inch in breadth where

38

thickest. In the inside of these is a large stone half an inch
long, of the shape of a bean or cushoo-nut, of a dark
brown colour, and this contains a small seed, which is seldom
hardened into fruit, but consists only of skin.

The long stalk that bears the figs of the Ensete springs
from the center of the plant, or rather is the body or solid
part of the plant itself. Upon this, where it begins to bend,
are a parcel of loose leaves, then grows the fig upon the body
of the plant without any stalk, after which the top of the
stalk is thick-set with small leaves, in the midst of which it
terminates the flower in form of the artichoke; whereas in
the banana, the flower, in form of the artichoke, grows at
the end of that shoot, or stalk, which proceeds from the
middle of the plant, the upper part of which bears the row
of figs.

The leaves of the Ensete are a web of longitudinal fibres
closely set together; the leaves grow from the bottom,
and are without stalks; whereas the banana is in shape like
a tree, and has been mistaken for such. One half of it is
divided into a stem, the other is a head formed of leaves,
and, in place of the stem that grows out of the Ensete, a
number of leaves rolled together round like a truncheon,
shoots out of the heart of the banana, and renews the upper
as the under leaves fall off; but all the leaves of the banana
have a long stalk; this fixes them to the trunk, which
they do not embrace by a broad base, or involucrum, as
the Ensete does.

But the greatest differences are still remaining. The
banana, has, by some, been mistaken for a tree of the

39

palmaceous tribe, for no other reason but a kind of similarity
in producing the fruit on an excrescence or stalk
growing from the heart of the stem; but still the musa is
neither woody nor perennial; it bears fruit but once, and
in all these respects it differs from trees of the palmaceous
kind, and indeed from all sort of trees whatever. The Ensete,
on the contrary, has no naked stem, no part of it is
woody; the body of it, for several feet high, is esculent;
but no part of the banana can be eaten. As soon as the
stalk of the Ensete appears perfect and full of leaves, the
body of the plant turns hard and fibrous, and is no longer
eatable; before, it is the best of all vegetables; when boiled,
it has the taste of the best new wheat-bread not perfectly
baked.

The drawing which I have given the reader was of an
Ensete ten years old. It was then very beautiful, and had no
marks of decay. As for the pistil, stamina, and ovarium,
they are drawn with such attention, and so clearly expressed
by the pencil, that it would be lost time to say more about
them. I have given one figure of the plant cloathed
with leaves, and another of the stem stript of them, that
the curious may have an opportunity of further investigating
the difference between this and the musa.

When you make use of the Ensete for eating, you cut
it immediately above the small detached roots, and perhaps
a foot or two higher, as the plant is of age. You strip the
green from the upper part till it becomes white; when
soft, like a turnip well boiled, if eat with milk or butter it
is the best of all food, wholesome, nourishing, and easily
digested.

40

We see in some of the Egyptian antique statues the
figure of Isis sitting between some branches of the banana
tree, as it is supposed, and some handfuls of ears of
wheat; you see likewise the hippopotamus ravaging a
quantity of banana tree. Yet the banana is merely adventitious
in Egypt, it is a native of Syria; it does not even exist
in the low hot country of Arabia Felix, but chooses some
elevation in the mountains where the air is temperate, and
is not found in Syria farther to the southward than lat. 34Â°.

After all, I do not doubt that it might have grown in
Mattareah, or in the gardens of Egypt or Rosetto; but it is
not a plant of the country, and could never have entered
into the list of their hieroglyphics; for this reason,
it could not figure any thing permanent or regular in
the history of Egypt or its climate. I therefore imagine
that this hieroglyphic was wholly Ethiopian, and that the
supposed banana, which, as an adventitious plant, signified
nothing in Egypt, was only a representation of the Ensete,
and that the record in the hieroglyphic of Isis and
the Ensete-tree was something that happened between harvest,
which was about August, and the time the Ensete-tree
became to be in use, which is in October.

The hippopotamus is generally thought to represent a
Nile that has been so abundant as to be destructive. When
therefore we see upon the obelisks the hippopotamus destroying
the banana, we may suppose it meant that the extraordinary
inundation had gone so far as not only to destroy
the wheat, but also to retard or hurt the growth of the
Ensete, which was to supply its place. I do likewise conjecture,

41

that the bundle of branches of a plant which Horus
Apollo says the ancient Egyptians produced as the food on
which they lived before the discovery of wheat, was not the
papyrus, as he imagines, but this plant, the Ensete, which
retired to its native Ethiopia upon a substitute being found
better adapted to the climate of Egypt.

KOL-QUALL.

In
that memorable day when leaving the Samhar, or low
flat parched country which forms the sea-coast of Abyssinia,
and turning westward, we came to the foot of that stupendous
mountain Taranta, which we were to pass in order to
enter into the high land of Abyssinia, we saw the whole
side of that prodigious mountain covered from top to bottom
with this beautiful tree. We were entering a country
where we daily expected wonders, and therefore, perhaps,
were not so much surprised as might have been supposed
at so extraordinary a sight. The fruit was ripe, and being
carried on the top of the branches, the trees that stood thick

42

together appeared to be covered with a cloth or veil of the
most vivid crimson colour.

The first thing that presented itself was the first shoot
of this extraordinary tree. It was a single stalk, about
six inches measured across, in eight divisions, regularly
and beautifully scolloped and rounded at the top, joining
in the centre at three feet and a half high. Upon the outside
of these scollops were a sort of eyes or small knots, out of
every one of which came five thorns, four on the sides and
one in the centre, scarce half an inch long, fragil, and of no
resistance, but exceedingly sharp and pointed. Its next process
is to put out a branch from the first or second scollop
near the top, others succeed from all directions; and this
stalk, which is soft and succulent, of the consistence of the
aloe, turns by degrees hard and ligneous, and, after a few
years, by multiplying its branches, assumes the form as in the
second plate. It is then a tree, the lower part of which is
wood, the upper part, which is succulent, has no leaves; these
are supplied by the fluted, scolloped, serrated, thorny sides of
its branches. Upon the upper extremity of these branches
grow its flowers, which are of a golden colour, rosaceous,
and formed of five round or almost oval petala; this is succeeded
by a triangular fruit, first of a light green with a
slight cast of red, then turning to a deep crimson, with streaks
of white both at top and bottom. In the inside it is divided
into three cells, with a seed in each of them; the cells are of
a greenish white, the seed round, and with no degree of humidity
or moisture about it, yet the green leaves contain a
quantity of bluish watery milk, almost incredible.

Upon cutting two of the finest branches of a tree in its
full vigour, a quantity of this issued out, which I cannot
compute to be less than four English gallons, and this was
so exceedingly caustic, that, though I washed the sabre that
cut it immediately, the stain has not yet left it.

When the tree grows old, the branches wither, and, in
place of milk, the inside appears to be full of powder, which
is so pungent, that the small dust which I drew upon striking
a withered branch seemed to threaten to make me
sneeze to death, and the touching of the milk with my
fingers excoriated them as if scalded with boiling water;
yet I everywhere observed the wood-pecker piercing the
rotten branches with its beak, and eating the insects, without
any impression upon its olfactory nerves.

The only use the Abyssinians make of this is for tanning
hides, at least for taking off the first hair. As we went west,
the tree turned poor, the branches were few, seldom above
two or three ribs, or divisions, and these not deeply indented,
whereas those of Taranta had frequently eight. We afterwards
saw some of them at the source of the Nile, in the
cliff where the village of Geesh is situated, but, though upon
very good ground, they did not seem to thrive; on the
contrary, where they grew on Taranta it was sandy, stony,
poor earth, scarce deep enough to cover the rock, but I
suspect they received some benefit from their vicinity to
the sea.

Some botanists who have seen the drawing have supposed
this to be the euphorbia officinarum of LinnÃ¦us; but, without
pretending to great skill in this matter, I should fear there

44

would be some objection to this supposition: First, on account
of the flower, which is certainly rosaceous, composed
of several petals, and is not campaniform: Secondly,
That it produces no sort of gum, either spontaneously or
upon incision, at no period of its growth; therefore I imagine
that the gum which comes from Africa in small pieces,
first white on its arrival, then turning yellow by age,
is not the produce of this tree, which, it may be depended
upon, produces no gum whatever.

Juba the younger is said, by Pliny, to have given this
name to the plant, calling it after his own physician, brother
to Musa physician to Augustus. We need not trouble ourselves
with what Juba says of it, he is a worse naturalist
and worse historian than the Nubian geographer.

RACK.

This
is a large tree, and seems peculiar to warm climates.
It abounds in Arabia Felix, in Abyssinia, that is, in the
low part of it, and in Nubia. The first place I saw it in was

45

in Raback, a port in the Red Sea, where I discovered this
singularity, that it grew in the sea within low-water mark.
When we arrived at Masuah, in making a plan of the harbour,
I saw a number of these in two islands both uninhabited,
and without water, the one called Shekh Seide, the
other Toulahout. These two islands are constantly overflowed
by salt water, and though they are strangers to fresh,
they yet produce large Rack-trees, which appear in a flourishing
state, as if planted in a situation designed for them
by nature.

Rack

The Arabians, it is said, make boats of this tree. Its
wood is so hardened by the sea, and also so bitter in taste,
that no worm whatever will touch it. Of this tree the Arabians
also make tooth-picks, these they sell in small bundles
at Mecca, and are reputed to be favourable to the teeth,
gums, and breath.

The reader will have observed frequent mention of some
trees found in the desert which our camels would not eat.
These are the Rack-tree, and the doom, or palma thebaica
cuciofera
30
. These grow where they find salt springs in
the sand; the desert being so impregnated with fossile salt
in every part of it, that great blocks and strata of it are
seen everywhere appearing above ground, especially about
lat. 18Â°.

46

The Rack something resembles the ash on its first appearance,
though in the formation of its parts it is widely
different. Its bark is white and polished, smooth, and without
furrows. Its trunk is generally 7 or 8 feet before it
cleaves into branches. I have seen it above 24 feet in height,
and 2 feet diameter.

Its leaves are, two and two, set on different sides, that is,
each two perpendicular to each other alternately. The small
branches that bear flowers part from the inside of the leaf,
and have the same position with the leaves; that is, suppose
the lowest pair of leaves and branches are on the east or west
side of the tree, the pair above them will be on the north
and south, and the next to these will be on the west as before.
The leaves are long and very sharp-pointed; in the
inside a deep green, and in the out a dirty white of a green
cast; they have no visible ribs either in the inside or out.
The cup is a perianthium of four petals, which closely confine
the flower, and is only a little flat at the top. The
flower is composed of four petals deeply cut, in the interstices
of which is a small green fruit divided by a fissure in the
middle; its colour is deep orange, with lights of gold colour,
or yellow, throughout it. It has no smell, tastes very
bitterly, and is never seen to be frequented by the bees. It
is probable that a tree of this kind, thoâ perhaps of another
name, and in greater perfection, and therefore more fit for
use, may be found in some of our West India islands between
lat. 15Â° and 18Â°, especially where there are salt springs
and marshes.

Geshe el Aube

GIR GIR, or GESHE EL AUBE.

This
species of grass is one of the acquisitions which my
travels have procured to botany. It was not before
known; and the seed has not, as far as I know, produced
any plant but in the garden of the king of France. It
grows plentifully near Ras el Feel, not far from the banks
of the large river Guangue, of which I have spoken in my
return from Abyssinia into Egypt. It begins to shoot in the
end of April, when it first feels the humidity of the air. It
advances then speedily to its full height, which is about 3
feet 4 inches. It is ripe in the beginning of May, and decays,
if not destroyed by fire, very soon afterwards.

The leaf is long, pointed, narrow, and of a feeble texture.
The stock from which it shoots produces leaves in great abundance,
which soon turn yellow and fall to the ground.
The goats, the only cattle these miserable people have, are
very fond of it, and for it abandon all other food while it
is within their reach. On the leaves of some plants I
have seen a very small glutinous juice, like to what we see

48

upon the leaves of the lime or the plane, but in much less
quantity; this is of the taste of sugar.

From the root of the branch arises a number of stalks,
sometimes two, but never, as far as I have seen, more than
three. The flower and seed are defended by a wonderful
perfection and quantity of small parts. The head when in
its maturity is of a purplish brown. The plate represents
it in its natural size, with its constituent parts dissected and
separated with very great attention. As they are many,
each have a number affixed to them.

Kantuffa

KANTUFFA.

This
thorn, like many men we meet daily in society, has
got itself into a degree of reputation and respect
from the noxious qualities and power of doing ill which it
possesses, and the constant exertion of these powers. The
Abyssinians, who wear coarse cotton cloths, the coarsest of
which are as thick as our blankets, the finest equal to our
muslin, are in the same degree annoyed with it. The soldier
screens himself by a goatâs, leopard, or lionâs skin, thrown
over his shoulder, of which it has no hold. As his head
is bare, he always cuts his hair short before he goes to battle,
lest his enemy should take advantage of it; but the
women, wearing their hair long, and the great men, whether
in the army or travelling in peace, being always cloathed,
it never fails to incommode them, whatever species of
raiment they wear. If their cloak is fine muslin, the least
motion against it puts it all in rags; but if it is a thick, soft
cloth, as those are with which men of rank generally travel,
it buries its thorns, great and small, so deep in it that

50

the wearer must either dismount and appear naked, which
to principal people is a great disgrace, or else much time
will be spent before he can disengage himself from its
thorns. In the time when one is thus employed, it rarely
fails to lay hold of you by the hair, and that again brings
on another operation, full as laborious, but much more
painful than the other.

In the course of my history, when speaking of the king,
Tecla Haimanout II. first entering Gondar after his exile
into TigrÃ©, I gave an instance that shewed how dangerous
it was for the natives to leave this thorn standing; and of such
consequence is the clearing of the ground thought to be,
that every year when the king marches, among the necessary
proclamations this is thought to be a very principal one,
âCut down the Kantuffa in the four quarters of the world,
for I do not know where I am going.â This proclamation,
from the abrupt stile of it, seems at first absurd to stranger
ears, but when understood is full of good sense and information.
It means, Do not sit gossiping with your hands before
you, talking, The king is going to Damot, he certainly will
go to Gojam, he will be obliged to go to TigrÃ©. That is not
your business, remove nuisances out of his way, that he may
go as expeditiously as possible, or send to every place where
he may have occasion.

The branches of the Kantuffa stand two and two upon the
stalk; the leaves are disposed two and two likewise, without
any single one at the point, whereas the branches bearing
the leaves part from the stalk: at the immediate joining of
them are two thick thorns placed perpendicular and parallel

51

alternately; but there are also single ones distributed in all
the interstices throughout the branch.

The male plant, which I suppose this to be, has a one-leaved
perianthium, divided into five segments, and this falls
off with the flower. The flower is composed of five petals,
in the middle of which rise ten stamina or filaments, the
outer row shorter than those of the middle, with long stigmata,
having yellow farina upon them. The flowers grow
in a branch, generally between three and four inches long,
in a conical disposition, that is, broader at the base than the
point. The inside of the leaves are a vivid green, in the outside
much lighter. It grows in form of a bush, with a multitude
of small branches rising immediately from the ground,
and is generally seven or eight feet high, I saw it when
in flower only, never when bearing fruit. It has a very
strong smell, resembling that of the small scented flower called
mignionet, sown in vases and boxes in windows, or rooms,
where flowers are kept.

The wild animals, both birds and beasts, especially the
Guinea-fowl, know how well it is qualified to protect them.
In this shelter, the hunter in vain could endeavour to molest
them, were it not for a hard-haired dog, or terrier of the
smallest size, who being defended from the thorns by the
roughness of his coat, goes into the cover and brings them
and the partridges alive one by one to his master.

GAGUEDI.

The
Gaguedi is a native of Lamalmon; whether it was
not in a thriving state, or whether it was the nature of
the tree, I know not, but it was thick and stunted, and had
but few branches; it was not above nine feet high, though it
was three feet in diameter. The leaves and flower, however,
seemed to be in great vigor and I have here designed them
all of their natural size as they stood.

The leaves are long, and broader as they approach the end.
The point is obtuse; they are of a dead green not unlike the
willow, and placed alternately one above the other on
the stalk. The calix is composed of many broad scales
lying one above the other, which operates by the pressure
upon one another, and keeps the calix shut before
the flower arrives at perfection. The flower is monopetalous,
or made of one leaf; it is divided at the top
into four segments, where these end it is covered with a
tuft of down, resembling hair, and this is the case at the top
also. When the flower is young and unripe, they are laid
regularly so as to inclose one another in a circle. As they

53

grow old and expand, they seem to lose their regular form,
and become more confused, till at last, when arrived at its
full perfection, they range themselves parallel to the lips
of the calix, and perpendicular to the stamina, in the same
order as a rose. The common receptacle of the flower is
oblong, and very capacious, of a yellow colour, and covered
with small leaves like hair. The stile is plain, simple, and
upright, and covered at the bottom with a tuft of down,
and is below the common receptacle of the flower.

As this flower is of a complicated nature, I have given
two figures of it, the one where the flower is seen in face,
the other in the outside. The stamina are three short filaments
inserted in the segment of the flower near the summit.

I have observed, in the middle of a very hot day, that the
flowers unbend themselves more, the calix seems to expand,
and the whole flower to turn itself towards the sun in the
same manner as does the sun-flower. When the branch is cut,
the flower dries as it were instantaneously, so that it seems
to contain very little humidity.

WANZEY.

This
tree is very common throughout all Abyssinia. I
do not know the reason, but all the towns are full of
them; every house in Gondar has two or three planted
round it, so that, when viewed first from the heights, it
appears like a wood, especially all the season of the rains;
but very exactly on the first of September, for three years
together, in a nightâs time, it was covered with a multitude
of white flowers. Gondar, and all the towns about, then
appeared as covered with white linen, or with new-fallen
snow. This tree blossoms the first day the rains cease. It
grows to a considerable magnitude, is from 18 to 20 feet
high. The trunk is generally about 3 feet and a half from
the ground; it then divides into four or five thick branches,
which have at least 60Â° inclination to the horizon, and not
more. These large branches are generally bare, for half
way up the bark is rough and furrowed. They then put
out a number of smaller branches, are circular and fattish

55

at the top, of a figure like some of our early pear-trees. The
cup is a single-leaved perianthium, red, marked very regularly
before it flowers, but when the flower is out, the edges
of the cup are marked with irregular notches, or segments,
in the edge, which by no means correspond in numbers or
distances to those that appeared before the perfection of the
flower.

The flower itself consists of one leaf of the funnel-fashioned
kind, spreads, and, when in its full perfection, folds
back at the lips, though it has in some flowers marks or depressions
which might appear like segments, yet they are
not such, but merely accidental, and the edge of most
of the flowers perfectly even, without any mark of separation.

The pistil consists of a very feeble thread; in the top it
is bisected, or divided, into two; its apex is covered with a
small portion of yellow dust. There are two, and sometimes
three, of these divisions. The fruit is fully formed in
the cup while the flower remains closed, and like a kind of
tuft, which falls off, and the pistil still remains on the point
of the fruit; is at first soft, then hardens like a nut, and is
covered with a thin, green husk. It then dries, hardens into
a shell, and withers. The leaf is of a dark green, without
varnish, with an obtuse point; the ribs few but strong,
marked both within and without. The outside is a greenish
yellow, without varnish also.

I do not know that any part of this tree is of the smallest
use in civil life, though its figure and parts seem to be

56

too considerable not to contain useful qualities if fairly investigated
by men endued with science. I have several times
mentioned in the history of the Galla, that this and the
coffee-tree have divine honours paid them by each and all
of the seven nations. Under this tree their king is chosen;
under this tree he holds his first council, in which he marks
his enemies, and the time and manner in which his own
soldiers are to make their irruption into their country.
His sceptre is a bludgeon made of this tree, which, like a
mace, is carried before him wherever he goes; it is produced
in the general meetings of the nation, and is called
Buco.

The wood is close and heavy, the bark thick; there is
then a small quantity of white wood, the rest is dark brown
and reddish, not unlike the laburnam, and the buco is stript
to this last appearance, and always kept plentifully anointed
with butter.

FAREK, or BAUHINIA ACUMINATA.

This
beautiful shrub was found on the banks of a
brook, which, falling from the west side of the
mountain of Geesh down the south face of the precipice
where the village is situated, is the first water that runs
southward into the lake Gooderoo, in the plain of Assoa.
It is the water we employed for common uses, not daring
to touch that of the Nile, unless for drinking and dressing
our food; it grew about 20 yards from this water, on the
side of the cliff, not 400 yards from the fountain of the
Nile itself. The name it bears here is Farek, which is, I
suppose, given it from the division of the leaf.

This shrub is composed of several feeble branches: to
what height it grows I do not know, having never seen it
before, nor were there many others where I found it. The
longest branch of this was not four feet high. It grew on
good black mold, but of no great depth, having at the bottom

58

a gritty or sandy stone, and seemed in full perfection.
The branch is of its natural size; on one of the smaller or
collateral branches is the flower full blown, with two others
that are buds. The parts are separated and designed
with care.

The first figure is the flower in its entire state, seen in
front, the stamina of course fore-shortened. The second is
an angular three-quarter view of the calix. The third is a
back view of the calix. The fourth is the calix inclosing the
stamina and pistil, round which last they form a fruit or grain.
The fifth is the flower stript of its calix, where is seen the germ,
the stamina, and the pistil. The sixth is the stamina magnified
to twice their size. The seventh is the lower leaf. The
eighth, the upper leaf of the flower. The ninth, the germ, or
rudiment of the fruit, with the pistil joined to it, at the
bottom of which there is a small cavity. The tenth is the
seed or fruit entire. The eleventh represents the inside of
the seed cut in half.

The leaves of this shrub are of a vivid green, and are
joined to the branch by a long pedicle, in the inside of
which are the rudiments of another, which I suppose
begin to sprout when the large one is injured or falls
off.

Though very little acquainted with the scientific part of
botany myself, its classes, genera, and species, and still less
jealous of my reputation in it, I cannot conceive why my
single attention, in charging myself with a number of seeds
in distant countries, and giving part to the garden at Paris,
should lead to a conclusion that I was so absolutely uninstructed

59

in the science for which at least I had shewn this
attachment, that I could not distinguish the plant before us
from the acacia vera. Is the knowledge of botany so notoriously
imperfect in England, or is the pre-eminence so
established in France, as to authorise such a presumption of
ignorance against a person, who, from his exertions and enterprise,
should hold some rank in the republic of letters
among travellers and discoverers?

A compliment was paid me by the Count de Buffon, or
by superior orders, in return for the articles I had presented
to the kingâs cabinet and garden at Paris, that the plants
growing from the seeds which I had brought from Abyssinia
should regularly, as they grew to perfection, be painted, and
sent over to me at London. The compliment was a handsome
one, and, I was very sensible of it, it would have
contributed more to the furnishing the kingâs garden with
plants than many lectures on botany, ex cathedra, will ever
do.

But it was not necessary to shew his knowledge for the
sake of contrasting it with my ignorance, that Mr Jussieu
says this bauhinia is by Mr Bruce taken for an acacia vera.
Now the acacia vera is a large, wide-spreading, thorny, hard,
red-wooded, rough-barked, gum-bearing tree. Its flower,
though sometimes white, is generally yellow; it is round or
globular, composed of many filaments or stamina; it is the
Spina Egyptiaca, its leaves, in shape and disposition, resembling
a mimosa; in Arabic it is called Saiel, Sunt, Gerar;
and if M. de Jussieu had been at all acquainted with the history
of the east, he must have known it was the tree of every desert,
and consequently that I must be better acquainted

60

with it than almost any traveller or botanist now alive.
Upon what reasonable ground then could he suppose, upon
my bringing to him a rare and elegant species of bauhinia,
which probably he had not before seen, that I could not
distinguish it from an acacia, of which I certainly brought
him none?

A large species of Mullein likewise, or, as he pleases to
term it, Bouillon Blanc, he has named Verbascum Abyssinicum;
and this the unfortunate Mr Bruce, it seems, has called
an aromatic herb growing upon the high mountains. I do
really believe, that M. de Jussieu is more conversant with
the Bouillon Blancs than I am; my Bouillons are of another
colour; it must be the love of French cookery, not English
taste, that would send a man to range the high mountains
for aromatic herbs to put in his Bouillon, if the Verbascum
had been really one of these.

Although I have sometimes made botany my amusement,
I do confess it never was my study, and I believe from
this the science has reaped so much the more benefit. I have
represented to the eye, with the utmost attention, by the best
drawings in natural history ever yet published, and to the
understanding in plain English, what I have seen as it appeared
to me on the spot, without tacking to it imaginary
parts of my own, from preconceived systems of what it
should have been, and thereby creating varieties that never
existed.

When I arrived at the Lazaretto at Marseilles, the Farenteit,
as it is called in Nubia, or the Guinea-worm, the name
it bears in Europe, having been broken by mismanagement in

61

my voyage from Alexandria, had retired into my leg and
festered there. The foot, leg, and thigh, swelled to a monstrous
size, appearance of mortification followed, and the surgeon,
with a tenderness and humanity that did honour to
his skill, declared, though reluctantly, that if I had been a man
of weak nerves, or soft disposition, he would have prepared
me for what was to happen by the interposition of a friend
or a priest; but as from my past sufferings he presumed my
spirit was of a more resolute and firmer kind, he thought
saving time was of the utmost consequence, and therefore
advised me to resolve upon submitting to an immediate amputation
above the knee. To limp through the remains of
life, after having escaped so many dangers with bones unbroken,
was hard, so much so, that the loss of life itself
seemed the most eligible of the two, for the bad habit of
body in which I found myself in an inveterate disease, for
which I knew no remedy, and joined to this the prejudice
that an Englishman generally has against foreign operators
in surgery, all persuaded me, that, after undergoing amputation,
I had but very little chance of recovery, besides long
and great suffering, want of sleep, want of food, and the
weakness that attends lying long in sick-bed, had gradually
subdued the natural desire and anxiety after life; every day
death seemed to be a lesser evil than pain. Patience, however,
strong fomentations, and inward applications of the
bark, at length cured me.

It was immediately after receiving my melancholy sentence,
that, thinking of my remaining duties, I remembered
I had carried abroad with me an order from the king to
procure seeds for his garden. Before I had lost the power
of direction, I ordered Michael, my Greek servant, to take

62

the half of all the different parcels and packages that were
lying by me, made up for separate uses, and pack them so
as they might be sent to Sir William Duncan the kingâs physician,
then in Italy, to be conveyed by him to Lord Rochfort,
secretary of state. I by the same conveyance accompanied
these with a short letter, wrote with great difficulty,—that
it appearing, beyond leaving room for hope, that my
return was to be prevented by an unexpected disease, I begged
his Majesty to receive these as the last tender of my duty
to him.

Michael, who never cared much for botany, at no period
was less disposed to give himself trouble about it than
now; his master, friend, and patron was gone, as he
thought; he was left in a strange country; he knew not at
word of the language, nor was he acquainted with one person
in Marseilles, for we had not yet stirred out of the lazaretto.
What became of the seeds for a time I believe neither
he nor I knew; but, when he saw my recovery advancing,
fear of reproof led him to conceal his former negligence.
He could neither read nor write, so that the only
thing he could do was to put the first seed that came to
hand in the first envelope, either in parchment or paper,
that had writing upon the back of it, and, thus selected, the
seeds came into the hands of M. de Jussieu at Paris. By
this operation of Michael, the verbascum became an aromatic
herb growing on the highest mountains, and the
bauhinia acuminata became an acacia vera.

The present of the drawings of the Abyssinian plants was
really, as it was first designed, a compliment but it turned out
just the contrary, for, in place of expecting the publication

63

that I was to make, in which they would naturally be a part,
the gates of the garden were thrown open, and every dabbler
in botany that could afford pen, ink, and paper, was put in
possession of those plants and flowers, at a time when I had
not said one word upon the subject of my travels.

Whether this was owing to M. de Jussieu, M. de Thouin,
or M. Daubenton, to all, or to any one of them, I do not
know, but I beg they will for a moment consider the great
impropriety of the measure. I suppose it would be thought
natural, that a person delineating plants in a foreign country
with such care, risk, and expence as I have done, should
wish to bring home the very seeds of those plants he had
delineated in preference to all others: supposing these had
been the only seeds he could have brought home, and generosity
and liberality of mind had led him to communicate
part of them to M. de Jussieu, we shall further say, this
last-mentioned gentleman had planted them, and when
the time came, engraved, and published them, what would
he think of this manner of repaying the travellerâs attention
to him? The bookseller, that naturally expected to be the
first that published these plants, would say to the traveller
whose book he was to buy, This collection of natural history
is not new, it has been printed in Sweden, Denmark,
and France, and part of it is to be seen in every monthly
magazine! Does M. de Jussieu think, that, after having
been once so treated, any traveller would ever give one seed
to the kingâs garden? he certainly would rather put them
in the fire; he must do so if he was a reasonable man, for
otherwise, by giving them away he is certainly ruining
his own work, and defeating the purposes for which he had
travelled.

64

When I first came home, it was with great pleasure I
gratified the curiosity of the whole world, by shewing them
each what they fancied the most curious. I thought this
was an office of humanity to young people, and to those
of slender fortunes, or those who, from other causes, had
no opportunity of travelling. I made it a particular duty
to attend and explain to men of knowledge and learning
that were foreigners, everything that was worth the time
they bestowed upon considering the different articles that
were new to them, and this I did at great length to the
Count de Buffon, and Mons. Gueneau de Montbeliard, and
to the very amiable and accomplished Madame dâAubenton.
I cannot say by whose industry, but it was in consequence
of this friendly communication, a list or inventory (for they
could give no more) of all my birds and beasts were published
before I was well got to England.

From what I have seen of the performances of the artists
employed by the cabinet, I do not think that they have anticipated
in any shape the merit of my drawings, especially
in birds and in plants; to say nothing milder of them, they
are in both articles infamous; the birds are so dissimilar from
the truth, that the names of them are very necessarily wrote
under, or over them, for fear of the old mistake of taking
them for something else. I condescend upon the Erkoom as a
proof of this. I gave a very fine specimen of this bird in
great preservation to the Kingâs collection; and though I
shewed them the original, they had not genius enough to
make a representation that could with any degree of certainty
be promised upon for a guess. When I was at
Paris, they had a woman, who, in place of any merit, at
least that I could judge of, was protected, as they said, by

65

the queen, and who made, what she called, Drawings; those
of plants were so little characteristic, that it was, strictly speaking,
impossible, without a very great consideration, to know
one plant from another: while there was, at same time, a
man of the greatest merit, M. de Seve, absolutely without
employment; thoâ, in my opinion, he was the best painter of
every part of natural history either in France or England.

KUARA.

This
beautiful tree, now presented to the reader, is the
production of the south and S. W. parts of Abyssinia.
It is very frequent, and, with the ebony, almost the only wood
of the province of Kuara, of which it bears the name; indeed
in all Fazuclo, Nuba, and Guba, and the countries where
there is gold. It is here designed in its natural size both
leaves, flowers, and fruit, the whole so plainly, that it is
needless to descant upon its particular parts, well known to
naturalists. It is what they call a Corallodendron, probably

66

from the colour of its flowers or of its fruit, both equal in
colour to coral.

Its fruit is a red bean, with a black spot in the middle of
it, which is inclosed in a round capsula, or covering, of a
woody nature, very tough and hard. This bean seems to
have been in the earliest ages used for a weight of gold
among the Shangalla, where that metal is found all over
Africa; and by repeated experiments, I have found that,
from the time of its being gathered, it varies very little
in weight, and may perhaps have been the very best
choice that therefore could have been made between the
collectors and the buyers of gold.

I have said this tree is called Kuara, which signifies the
Sun. The bean is called Carat, from which is derived the
manner of esteeming gold as so many carats fine. From
the gold country in Africa it passed to India, and there came
to be the weight of precious stones, especially diamonds; so
that to this day in India we hear it commonly spoken of gold
or diamonds, that they are of so many carats fine, or weight.
I have seen these beans likewise from the West-Indian islands.
They are just the same size, but, as far as I know, are not yet
applied to any use there.

WALKUFFA.

This
tree grows in the Kolla, or hottest part of Abyssinia.
It does not flower immediately after the rains, as
most trees in Abyssinia do, that is, between the beginning
of September and the Epiphany, when the latter rains in
November do still fall in violent periodical showers, but it
is after the Epiphany, towards the middle of January, that
it first appears covered with blossoms. However beautiful,
it has no smell, and is accounted destructive to the bees, for
which reason it is rooted out and destroyed in those countries
that pay their revenue in honey. It resembles the
Kentish cherry-tree in appearance, especially if that tree
has but a moderate, not overspreading top. The wood immediately
below its bark is white, but under that a brownish
yellow, something like cedar; the old trees that I have
seen turn darker, and are not unlike to the wood of the laburnum,
or pease-cod tree. The natives say it does not swim
in water. This however I can contradict upon experiment.
The wood, indeed, is heavy, but still it swims.

68

Although the painting of this tree, which I here exhibit,
is neither more nor less accurate in the delineation of its
parts than every other design of natural history given in
this work to the public, yet the inimitable beauty of the
subject itself has induced me to bestow much more pains
upon it than any other I have published, and, according to
my judgment, it is the best executed in this collection. All
its parts are so distinctly figured, the flower exposed in such
variety of directions, that it supersedes the necessity of describing
it to the skilful botanist, who will find here every
thing he possibly could in the flower itself. This is a great
advantage, for if the parts had been ever so studiously and
carefully reserved in a
hortus siccus
as they are spread upon
the paper, it would have been impossible not to have lost
some of its finer members, they are so fragil, as I have often
experienced in different attempts to dry and preserve it.

The flower consists of five petals, part of each overlapping
or supporting the other, so that it maintains its regular figure
of a cup till the leaves fall off, and does not spread
and disjoin first, as do the generality of these rosaceous
flowers before they fall to the ground. Its colour is a pure
white, in the midst of which is a kind of sheath, or involucrum,
of a beautiful pink colour, which surrounds the pistil,
covering and concealing about one-third of it. Upon the
top of this is a kind of impalement, consisting of five white
upright threads, and between each of these are disposed
three very feeble stamina of unequal lengths, which make
them stand in a triangular oblong form, covered with yellow
farina.

Wooginoos
or
Brucea Antidysenterica.

The pistil is a yellow tube, divided at the top into five
segments, and fixed at the bottom in what appears to be the
rudiment of a fruit; but I never saw this in any state of
perfection, and the Abyssinians say it never produces anything
but a small, round, black seed, concerning which I
can say no further. The perianthium consists of five sharp-pointed
segments, which inclose the flower when not arrived
to maturity, in a conical pod of a light-green colour,
which colour it likewise keeps in its more advanced state
when spread. I do not know any other name it has but
that of Walkuffa, nor do I know the signification of that
name in any language.

WOOGINOOS, or BRUCEA ANTIDYSENTERICA.

This
shrub, the branch of which is before us, is a production
of the greatest part of Abyssinia, especially
the sides of the valleys in the low country, or Kolla. It is
indeed on the north side of Debra Tzai, where you first descend
into the Kolla. This drawing was made at Hor-Cacamoot,

70

in Ras el Feel, where the Wooginoos grows abundantly,
and where dysenteries reign continually, Heaven
having put the antidote in the same place where grows
the poison.

Some weeks before I left Gondar I had been very much
tormented with this disease, and I had tried both ways of
treating it, the one by hot medicines and astringents, the
other by the contrary method of diluting. Small dozes of
ipecacuanha under the bark had for several times procured
me temporary relief, but relapses always followed. My
strength began to fail, and, after a severe return of this disease,
I had, at my ominous mansion, Hor-Cacamoot, the valley
of the shadow of death, a very unpromising prospect,
for I was now going to pass through the kingdom of Sennaar
in the time of year when that disease most rages.

Sheba, chief of the Shangalia, called Ganjar, on the
frontiers of Kuara, had at this time a kind of embassy or
message to Ras el Feel. He wanted to burn some villages
in Atbara belonging to the Arabs Jeheina, and wished Yasine
might not protect them: they often came and sat with
me, and one of them hearing of my complaint, and the apprehensions
I annexed to it, seemed to make very light of both,
and the reason was, he found at the very door this shrub,
the strong and ligneous root of which, nearly as thick as a
parsnip, was covered with a clean, clear, wrinkled root, of
a light-brown colour, and which peeled easily off the root.
The bark was without fibres to the very end, where it
split like a fork into two thin divisions. After having
cleared the inside of it of a whitish membrane, he laid it to
dry in the sun, and then would have bruised it between two

71

stones, had we not shewn him the easier and more expeditious
way of powdering it in a mortar.

The first doze I took was about a heaped tea-spoonful
in a cup of camelâs milk; I took two of these in a day,
and then in the morning a tea-cup of the infusion in camelâs
milk warm. It was attended the first day with a violent
drought, but I was prohibited from drinking either water
or bouza. I made privately a drink of my own; I took a
little boiled water which had stood to cool, and in it a small
quantity of spirits. I after used some ripe tamarinds
in water, which I thought did me harm. I cannot say
I found any alteration for the first day, unless a kind of
hope that I was growing better, but the second day I found
myself sensibly recovered. I left off laudanum and ipecacuanha,
and resolved to trust only to my medicine. In
looking at my journal, I think it was the 6th or 7th day
that I pronounced myself well, and, though I had returns
afterwards, I never was reduced to the necessity of taking
one drop of laudanum, although before I had been very
free with it. I did not perceive it occasioned any extraordinary
evacuation, nor any remarkable symptom but that
continued thirst, which abated after it had been taken some
time.

In the course of my journey through Sennaar, I saw that
all the inhabitants were well acquainted with the virtues of
this plant. I had prepared a quantity pounded into powder,
and used it successfully everywhere. I thought that the
mixing of a third of bark with it produced the effect more
speedily, and, as we had now little opportunity of getting
milk, we made an infusion in water. I tried a spiritous

72

tincture, which I do believe would succeed well. I made
some for myself and servants, a spoonful of which we used
to take when we found symptoms of our disease returning,
or when it was raging in the place in which we chanced
to reside. It is a plain, simple bitter, without any aromatic
or resinous taste. It leaves in your throat and pallet something
of roughness resembling ipecacuanha.

This shrub was not before known to botanists. I brought
the seeds to Europe, and it has grown in every garden, but
has produced only flowers, and never came to fruit. Sir
Joseph Banks, president to the Royal Society, employed Mr
Miller to make a large drawing from this shrub as it had
grown at Kew. The drawing was as elegant as could be
wished, and did the original great justice. To this piece of
politeness Sir Joseph added another, of calling it after its
discovererâs name, Brucea Antidysenterica: the present figure
is from a drawing of my own on the spot at Ras el
Feel.

The leaf is oblong and pointed, smooth, and without collateral
ribs that are visible. The right side of the leaf is a
deep green, the reverse very little lighter. The leaves are
placed two and two upon the branch, with a single one at
the end. The flowers come chiefly from the point of the
stalk from each side of a long branch. The cup is a perianthium
divided into four segments. The flower has four
petals, with a strong rib down the center of each. In place
of a pistil there is a small cup, round which, between the
segments of the perianthium and the petala of the flower,
four feeble stamina arise, with a large stigma of a crimson

73

colour, of the shape of a coffee-bean, and divided in the
middle.

CUSSO, BANKESIA ABYSSINICA.

The
Cusso is one of the most beautiful trees, as also one
of the most useful. It is an inhabitant of the high
country of Abyssinia, and indigenous there; I never saw it in
the Kolla, nor in Arabia, nor in any other part of Asia or
Africa. It is an instance of the wisdom of providence, that
this tree does not extend beyond the limits of the disease of
which it was intended to be the medicine or cure.

The Abyssinians of both sexes, and at all ages, are troubled
with a terrible disease, which custom however has enabled
them to bear with a kind of indifference. Every individual,
once a month, evacuates a large quantity of worms; these are
not the tape worm, or those that trouble children, but they
are the sort of worm called Ascarides, and the method of
promoting these evacuations, is by infusing a handful of dry

74

Cusso flowers in about two English quarts of bouza, or the
beer they make from teff; after it has been steeped all night,
the next morning it is fit for use. During the time the patient
is taking the Cusso, he makes a point of being invisible
to all his friends, and continues at home from morning
till night. Such too was the custom of the Egyptians upon
taking a particular medicine. It is alledged that the want of
this drug is the reason why the Abyssinians do not travel,
or if they do, most of them are short-lived.

The seed of this is very small, more so than the semen
santonicum, which seems to come from a species of worm-wood.
Like it the Cusso sheds its seed very easily; from this
circumstance, and its smallness, no great quantity of the
seed is gathered, and therefore the flower is often substituted.
It is bitter, but not nearly so much as the semen santonicum.

The Cusso grows seldom above twenty feet high, very
rarely straight, generally crooked or inclined. It is planted
always near churches, among the cedars which surround
them, for the use of the town or village. Its leaf is about
2¼ inches long, divided into two by a strong rib. The two
divisions, however, are not equal, the upper being longer
and broader than the lower; it is a deep unvarnished green,
exceedingly pleasant to the eye, the fore part covered with
soft hair or down. It is very much indented, more so than
a nettle-leaf, which in some measure it resembles, only is
narrower and longer.

These leaves grow two and two upon a branch; between
each two are the rudiments of two pair of young ones, prepared

75

to supply the others when they fall off, but they are terminated
at last with a single leaf at the point. The end
of this stalk is broad and strong, like that of a palm-branch.
It is not solid like the gerid of the date-tree, but opens in
the part that is without leaves about an inch and a half
from the bottom, and out of this aperture proceeds the
flower. There is a round stalk bare for about an inch
and a quarter, from which proceed crooked branches, to the
end of which are attached single flowers; the stalk that carries
these proceeds out of every crook, or geniculation; the
whole cluster of flowers has very much the shape of a cluster
of grapes, and the stalks upon which it is supported
very much the stalk of the grape; a very few small leaves
are scattered through the cluster of flowers.

The coral itself is of a greenish colour, tinged with purple;
when fully blown, it is altogether of a deep red or purple;
the flower is white, and consists of five petals, in the
midst is a short pistil with a round head, surrounded by eight
stamina of the same form, loaded with yellow farina. The
cup consists of five petals, which much resemble another
flower; they are rounded at the top, and nearly of an equal
breadth every way.

The bark of the tree is smooth, of a yellowish white, interspersed
with brown streaks which pass through the whole
body of the tree. It is not firm or hard, but rather stringy
and reedy. On the upper part, before the first branch of
leaves set out, are rings round the trunk, of small filaments,
of the consistence of horse hair; these are generally fourteen
or sixteen in number, and are a very remarkable characteristic
belonging to this tree.

76

As the figure of this plant is true and exact beyond all
manner of exception, I cannot but think it may be found in
latitudes 11 or 12Â° north in the West Indies or America; and
having been found a gentle, safe, and efficacious medicine in
Abyssinia, it is not doubted but the superior skill of our
physicians would turn it to the advantage of mankind in
general, when used here in Europe. In consequence of
the established prerogatives of discoverers, I have named
this beautiful and useful tree after Sir Joseph Banks, President
of the royal Society.

TEFF.

This
grain is commonly sown all over Abyssinia, where
it seems to thrive equally on all sorts of ground; from
it is made the bread which is commonly used throughout
Abyssinia. The Abyssinians, indeed, have plenty of wheat,
and some of it of an excellent quality: They likewise make

77

as fine wheat-bread as any in the world, both for colour
and for taste; but the use of wheat-bread is chiefly confined
to people of the first rank. On the other hand, Teff
is used by all sorts of people from the king downwards, and
there are kinds of it which are esteemed fully as much as
wheat. The best of these is as white as flour, exceedingly
light, and easily digested. There are others of a browner
colour, and some nearly black; this last is the food of soldiers
and servants. The cause of this variation of colour
is manifold; the Teff that grows on light ground having
a moderate degree of moisture, but never dry; the lighter
the earth is in which it grows, the better and whiter the
Teff will be; the husk too is thinner. That Teff, too, that
ripens before the heavy rains, is usually whiter and finer,
and a great deal depends upon sifting the husk from it after
it is reduced to flour, by bruising or breaking it in a stone-mill.
This is repeated several times with great care, in
the finest kind of bread, which is found in the houses of
all people of rank or substance. The manner of making it
is by taking a broad earthen jar, and having made a lump
of it with water, they put it into an earthen jar at some distance
from the fire, where it remains till it begins to ferment,
or turn sour; they then bake it into cakes of a circular
form, and about two feet in diameter: It is of a spungy,
soft quality, and not a disagreeable sourish taste. Two
of these cakes a-day, and a coarse cotton cloth once a-year,
are the wages of a common servant.

Teff

At their banquets of raw meat, the flesh being cut in
small bits, is wrapt up in pieces of this bread, with a proportion
of fossile salt and Cayenne pepper. Before the company
sits down to eat, a number of these cakes of different

78

qualities are placed one upon the other, in the same manner
as our plates, and the principal people, sitting first down,
eat the white Teff; the second, or coarser sort, serves the second-rate
people that succeed them, and the third is for
the servants. Every man, when he is done, dries or wipes
his fingers upon the bread which he is to leave for his
successor, for they have no towels, and this is one of the
most beastly customs of the whole.

The Teff bread, when well toasted, is put into a large
jar, after being broken into small pieces, and warm water
poured upon it. It is then set by the fire, and frequently
stirred for several days, the mouth of the jar being close covered.
After being allowed to settle three or four days, it
acquires a sourish taste, and is what they call Bouza, or
the common beer of the country. The bouza in Atbara
is made in the same manner, only, instead of Teff, cakes of
barley-meal are employed; both are very bad liquors, but
the worst is that made of barley.

The plant is herbaceous: from a number of weak leaves
proceeds a stalk of about twenty-eight inches in length,
not perfectly straight, smooth, but jointed or knotted at particular
distances. This stalk is not much thicker than that
of a carnation or jellyflower. About eight inches from the
top, a head is formed of a number of small branches, upon
which it carries the fruit and flowers; the latter of which
is small, of a crimson colour, and scarcely perceptible by
the naked eye, but from the opposition of that colour. The
pistil is divided into two, seemingly attached to the germ
of the fruit, and has at each end small capillaments forming
a brush. The stamina are three in number, two on the

79

lower side of the pistil, and one on the upper. These are,
each of them, crowned with two oval stigmata, at first green,
but after, crimson. The fruit is formed in a capsula, consisting
of two conical, hollow leaves, which, when closed, seems
to compose a small conical pod, pointed at the top. The
fruit, or seed, is oblong, and is not so large as the head of
the smallest pin, yet it is very prolific, and produces these
seeds in such quantity as to yield a very abundant crop in
the quantity of meal.

Whether this grain was ever known to the Greeks and
Romans, is what we are no where told. Indeed, the various
grains made use of in antiquity, are so lamely and
poorly described, that, unless it is a few of the most common,
we cannot even guess at the rest. Pliny mentions
several of them, but takes no notice of any of their qualities,
but medicinal ones; some he specifies as growing in
Gaul, others in the Campania of Rome, but takes no
notice of those of Ethiopia or Egypt. Among these there
is one which he calls Tiphe, but says not whence it came;
the name would induce us to believe that this was Teff,
but we can only venture this as a conjecture not supported.
But it is very improbable, connected as Egypt and
Ethiopia were from the first ages, both by trade and religion,
that a grain of such consequence to one nation should
be utterly unknown to the other. It is not produced in
the low or hot country, the Kolla, that is, in the borders of
it; for no grain can grow, as I have already said, in the
Kolla or Mazaga itself; but in place of Teff, in these borders,
there grows a black grain called Tocusso. The stalk
of this is scarce a foot long; it has four divisions where the
grain is produced, and seems to be a species of the meiem

80

msalib, or gramen crucis, the grass of the cross. Of this
a very black bread is made, ate only by the poorest sort;
but though it makes worse bread, I think it makes better
bouza.

Some have thought, from the frequent use of Teff, hath
come that disease of worms which I have mentioned in the
article Cusso. But I am inclined to think this is not the case,
because the Gibbertis, or Mahometans, born in Abyssinia,
all use Teff in the same proportion as the Christians, yet
none of these are troubled with worms. And from this I
should be led to think that this disease arises rather from
eating raw meat, which the Mahometans do not, and
therefore are not affected with this disorder as the Christians
are.

81

Of Quadrupeds.

I believe
there is in the world no country which produces
a greater number, or variety of quadrupeds,
whether tame or wild, than Abyssinia. As the high country
is now perfectly cleared of wood, by the waste made in
that article from the continual march of armies, the mountains
are covered to the very top, with perpetual verdure,
and most luxuriant herbage.

The long rains in summer are not suddenly absorbed by
the rays of the sun: a thick veil defends the ground when
it is in the zenith, or near it, affording heat to promote vegetation
without withering it by destroying the moisture,
and by this means a never-failing store of provender is
constantly provided for all sorts of cattle. Of the tame or
cow-kind, great abundance present themselves everywhere,
differing in size, some having horns of various dimensions;

82

some without horns at all, differing also in the colour and
length of their hair, by having bosses upon their backs, according
as their pasture or climate varies. There are kinds also
destined to various uses; some for carriage, like mules
or asses, some to be rode upon like horses; and these are not
the largest of that kind, but generally below the middle
size. As for that species bearing the monstrous horns, of
which I have often spoke in my narrative, their size is not
to be estimated by that of their horns; the animal itself is
not near so big as a common English cow; the growth of
the horn is a disease which proves fatal to them, because
encouraged for a peculiar purpose. Whether it would be
otherwise curable, has not yet, I believe, been ever ascertained
by experiment. But the reader may with confidence
assure himself, that there are no such animals as carnivorous
bulls in Africa, and that this story has been invented
for no other purpose but a desire to exhibit an animal worthy
of wearing these prodigious horns. I have always wished
that this article, and some others of early date, were blotted
out of our philosophical transactions; they are absurdities
to be forgiven to infant physic and to early travels, but they
are unworthy of standing among the cautious, well-supported
narratives of our present philosophers. Though we
may say of the buffaloe that it is of this kind, yet we cannot
call it a tame animal here; so far from that, it is the
most ferocious in the country where he resides; this, however,
is not in the high temperate part of Abyssinia, but in
the sultry Kolla, or valleys below, where, without hiding
himself, as wild beasts generally do, as if conscious, of superiority
of strength, he lyes at his ease among large spreading
shady trees near the clearest and deepest rivers, or the
largest stagnant pools of the purest water. Notwithstanding

83

this, he is in his person as dirty and slovenly as he is
fierce, brutal, and indocile; he seems to maintain among his
own kind the same character for manners that the wolf
does among the carnivorous tribe.

But what is very particular is, this is the only animal
kept for giving milk in Egypt. And though apparently
these are of the same species, and came originally from Ethiopia,
their manners are so entirely changed by their migration,
difference of climate or of food, that, without the exertion
of any art to tame them, they are milked, conducted
to and fro, and governed by children of ten years old, without
apprehension, or any unlucky accident having ever happened.

Among the wild animals are prodigious numbers of the
gazel, or antelope kind; the bohur, sassa, secho, and madoqua,
and various others; these are seldom found in the cultivated
country, or where cattle pasture, as they chiefly feed
on trees; for the most part, they are found in broken ground
near the banks of rivers, where, during the heat of the day,
they conceal themselves, and sleep under cover of the
bushes; they are still more numerous in those provinces
whose inhabitants have been extirpated, and the houses ruined
or burnt in time of war, and where wild oats, grown
up so as to cover the whole country, afford them a quiet
residence, without being disturbed by man. Of this I
have mentioned a very remarkable instance in the first
attempt I made to discover the source of the Nile, (vol.
III. p. 439.) The hyÃ¦na is still more numerous: enough has
been said about him; I apprehend that there are two species.
There are few varieties of the dog or fox kind. Of these

84

the most numerous is the Deep, or, as he is called, the Jackal;
this is precisely the same in all respects as the Deep of Barbary
and Syria, who are heard hunting in great numbers,
and howling in the evening and morning. The true Deep, as
far as appears to me, is not yet known, at least I never yet
saw in any author a figure that resembled him. The wild
boar, smaller and smoother in the hair than that of Barbary
or Europe, but differing in nothing else, is met frequently in
swamps or banks of rivers covered with wood. As he is
accounted unclean in Abyssinia, both by Christians and Mahometans,
consequently not persecuted by the hunter, both
he and the fox should have multiplied; but it is probable
they, and many other beasts, when young, are destroyed by
the voracious hyÃ¦na.

The elephant, rhinoceros, giraffa, or camelopardalis,
are inhabitants of the low hot country; nor is the lion,
or leopard, faadh, which is the panther, seen in the high and
cultivated country. There are no tigers in Abyssinia, nor, as
far as I know, in Africa; it is an Asiatic animal; for
what reason some travellers, or naturalists, have called him
the tiger-wolf, or mistaken him altogether for the tiger, is
what I cannot discover. Innumerable flocks of apes, and
baboons of different kinds, destroy the fields of millet every
where; these, and an immense number of common rats,
make great destruction in the country and harvest. I never
saw a rabbit in Abyssinia, but there is plenty of hares; this,
too, is an animal which they reckon unclean; and not being
hunted for food, it should seem they ought to have increased
to greater numbers. It is probable, however, that the
great quantity of eagles, vultures, and beasts of prey, has

85

kept them within reasonable bounds. The hippopotamus
and crocodile abound in all the rivers, not only of Abyssinia,
but as low down as Nubia and Egypt: there is no good
figure nor description extant, as far as I know, of either
of these animals; some unforeseen accident always thwarted
and prevented my supplying this deficiency. There are
many of the ass kind in the low country towards the frontiers
of Atbara, but no Zebras; these are the inhabitants of Fazuclo
and Narea.

RHINOCEROS.

Naturalists
seem now in general to be agreed that
there are two species of this quadruped, the first having
two horns upon his nose, the second one. It is also a
generally received opinion, that these different species are
confined to distant places of the old continent; that with one
horn is thought to be exclusively an inhabitant of Asia,
that with two horns to be only found in Africa.

86

Whether this division is right in all its parts, I shall
not advance. That there is a rhinoceros in Asia with
one horn is what we positively know, but that there is
none of the other species in that part of the continent does
not appear to me as yet so certain. Again, there is no sort
of doubt, that though the rhinoceros with two horns is an
inhabitant of Africa, yet is it as certain that the species
with one horn is often found in that country likewise,
especially in the eastern part, where is the myrrh and cinnamon
country, towards Cape Gardefan, which runs into the
Indian ocean beyond the Straits of Babelmandeb. And if I
was to credit the accounts which the natives of the respective
countries have given me, I should be induced to believe that
the rhinoceros of the kingdom of Adel had but one horn.
They say this is the case where little rain falls, as in Adel,
which, though within the tropics, is not liable to that several
months deluge, as is the inland part of the country
more to the westward. They say further, that all that woody
part inhabited by Shangalla, corresponding to TigrÃ© and SirÃ©,
is the haunt of the rhinoceros with two horns. Whether
this is really the case I do not pretend to aver, I give the
reader the story with the authority; I think it is probable;
but as in all cases where very few observations can be repeated,
as in this, I leave him entirely to the light of his own
understanding.

The animal represented in this drawing is a native of
Tcherkin, near Ras el Feel, of the hunting of which I have
already spoken in my return through the desert to Egypt,
and this is the first drawing of the rhinoceros with a double
horn that has ever yet been presented to the public. The
first figure of the Asiatic rhinoceros, the species having but

87

one horn, was painted by Albert Durer, from the life, from
one of those sent from India by the Portuguese in the beginning
of the sixteenth century. It was wonderfully ill-executed
in all its parts, and was the origin of all the monstrous
forms under which that animal has been painted,
ever since, in all parts of the world. Several modern philosophers
have made amends for this in our days; Mr Parsons,
Mr Edwards, and the Count de Buffon, have given
good figures of it from life; they have indeed some faults,
owing chiefly to preconceived prejudices and inattention.
These, however, were rhinoceroses with one horn, all Asiatics.
This, as I have before said, is the first that has been
published with two horns, it is designed from the life, and
is an African; but as the principal difference is in the horn,
and as the manners of this beast are, I believe, very faithfully
described and common to both species, I shall only
note what I think is deficient in his history, or what I can
supply from having had an opportunity of seeing him alive
and at freedom in his native woods.

It is very remarkable, that two such animals as the elephant
and rhinoceros should have wholly escaped the description
of the sacred writers. Moses, and the children of
Israel, were long in the neighbourhood of the countries
that produced them, both while in Egypt and in Arabia.
The classing of the animals into clean and unclean, seems
to have led the legislator into a kind of necessity of describing,
in one of the classes, an animal, which made the food
of the principal Pagan nations in the neighbourhood. Considering
the long and intimate connection Solomon had
with the south-coast of the Red Sea, it is next to impossible
that he was not acquainted with them, as both David his

88

father, and he, made plentiful use of ivory, as they frequently
mention in their writings, which, along with
gold, came from the same part. Solomon, besides, wrote
expressly upon Zoology, and, we can scarce suppose, was ignorant
of two of the principal articles of that part of the
creation, inhabitants of the great Continent of Asia east from
him, and that of Africa on the south, with both which territories
he was in constant correspondence.

There are two animals, named frequently in scripture,
without naturalists being agreed what they are. The one
is the behemoth, the other the reem, both mentioned as
the types of strength, courage, and independence on man,
and as such exempted from the ordinary lot of beasts, to be
subdued by him, or reduced under his dominion. Thoâ this
is not to be taken in a literal sense, for there is no animal
without the fear or beyond the reach of the power of man,
we are to understand this as applicable to animals possessed
of strength and size so superlative as that in these qualities
other beasts bear no proportion to them.

The behemoth, then, I take to be the elephant; his history
is well known, and my only business is with the reem,
which I suppose to be the rhinoceros. The derivation of
this word, both in the Hebrew and the Ethiopic, seems to
be from erectness, or standing straight. This is certainly no
particular quality in the animal itself, who is not more,
or even so much erect as many other quadrupeds, for, in
its knees it is rather crooked; but it is from the circumstance
and manner in which his horn is placed. The horns
of all other animals are inclined to some degree of parallelizm,
with his nose, or
os frontis
. The horn of the rhinoceros

89

alone is erect and perpendicular to this bone, on which
it stands at right angles, thereby possessing a greater purchase,
or power, as a lever, than any horn could possibly
have in any other position.

This situation of the horn is very happily alluded to in
the sacred writings: âMy horn shalt thou
exalt
like the
horn of an unicorn
31
:â and the horn here alluded to is
not wholly figurative, as I have already taken notice of in
the course of my history
32
, but was really an ornament, worn
by great men in the days of victory, preferment, or rejoicing,
when they were anointed with new, sweet, or fresh oil,
a circumstance which David joins with that of erecting
the horn.

Some authors, for what reason I know not, have made
the reem, or unicorn, to be of the deer or antelope kind,
that is, of a genus whose very character is fear and weakness,
very opposite to the qualities by which the reem is
described in scripture; besides, it is plain the reem is not of
the class of clean quadrupeds; and a late modern traveller,
very whimsically, takes him for the leviathan, which
certainly was a fish. It is impossible to determine which
is the silliest opinion of the two. Balaam, a priest of Midian,
and so in the neighbourhood of the haunts of the
rhinoceros, and intimately connected with Ethiopia, for
they themselves were shepherds of that country, in a transport,
from contemplating the strength of Israel whom he
was brought to curse, says, they had as it were the strength

90

of the reem
33
. Job
34
makes frequent allusion to his great
strength, and ferocity, and indocility. He asks, Will the
reem be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? that is,
Will he willingly come into thy stable, and eat at thy manger?
And again, Canst thou bind the reem with a band
in the furrow, and will he harrow the vallies after thee
35
?
In other words, Canst thou make him go in the plow or
harrows?

Isaiah
36
, who of all the prophets seem to have known
Egypt and Ethiopia the best, when prophecying about the
destruction of Idumea, says, that the reem shall come down
with the fat cattle; a proof that he knew his habitation was
in the neighbourhood. In the same manner as when foretelling
the desolation of Egypt, he mentions as one manner
of effecting it, the bringing down, the fly
37
from Ethiopia
to meet the cattle in the desert, and among the bushes,
and destroy them there, where that insect did not ordinarily
come but on command
38
, and where the cattle fled every
year to save themselves from that insect.

The Rhinoceros, in Geez, is called ArwÃ© Harish, and in
the Amharic, Auraris, both which names signify the large
wild beast with the horn. This would seem as if applied
to the species that had but one horn. On the other hand,
in the country of the Shangalla, and in Nubia adjoining, he
is called Girnamgirn, or horn upon horn, and this would
seem to denote that he had two. The Ethiopic text renders

91

the word Reem, ArwÃ© Harish, and this the Septuagint translates
Monoceros, or Unicorn.

If the Abyssinian rhinoceros had invariably two horns,
it seems to me improbable the Septuagint would call him
Monoceros, especially as they must have seen an animal of
this kind exposed at Alexandria in their time, then first mentioned
in history, at an exhibition given by Ptolemy Philadelphus
at his accession to the crown, before the death of
his father, of which we have already made mention.

The principal reason of translating the word Reem, Unicorn,
and not Rhinoceros, is from a prejudice that he must
have had but one horn. But this is by no means so
well-founded, as to be admitted as the only argument for
establishing the existence of an animal which never has
appeared, after the search of so many ages. Scripture
speaks of the horns of the unicorn
39
, so that, even from this
circumstance, the reem may be the rhinoceros, as the Asiatic,
and part of the African rhinoceros, may be the unicorn.
It is something remarkable, that, notwithstanding Alexanderâs
expedition into India, this quadruped was not known
to Aristotle
40
. Strabo and AthenÃ¦us both speak of him
from report, as having been seen in Egypt. Pausanius calls
him an Ethiopic bull; the same manner the Romans called
the elephants
Lucas bovis
, Lucanian oxen, as being first seen
in that part of Magna Grecia. Pompey exhibited him first

92

in Italy, and he was often produced in games as low as
Heliogabalus.

As all these were from Asia, it seems most probable they
had but one horn, and they are represented as such in the
medals of Domitian. Yet Martial
41
speaks of one with two
horns; and the reality of the rhinoceros so armed being
till now uncertain, commentators have taken pains to persuade
us that this was an error of the poet; but there can
be now no doubt that the poet was right, and the commentators
wrong, a case that often happens.

I do not know from what authority the author of the Encyclopedia
42

refers to the medals of Domitian, where the rhinoceros,
he says, has a double horn; in all those that have been
published, one horn only is figured. The use made of these
horns is in the turning-loom; they are made into cups, and
sold to ignorant people as containing antidotes against poisons;
for this quality they generally make part of the presents of
the Mogul and kings of Persia at Constantinople. Some modern
naturalists have scarce yet given over this prejudice;
which might have had a possibility of truth while the
Galenical school flourished, and vegetable poisons were
chiefly used; but it is absurd to suppose, that what might
discover solanum, or deadly night-shade, upon contact,
would have the like effect upon the application of arsenic;
and from experience I can pronounce, that a cup of this
is alike useless in the discovery or either. The handles

93

of daggers are always, in Abyssinia, made of this horn, and
these being the only works to which they are applied, is one
of the reasons why I have said we should not rashly pronounce
that the Asiatic rhinoceros has but one horn, merely
because the foremost, or round horn, is the only one of
the many that have been sent from India. In Abyssinia
we seldom see the hunters at the pains to cut off or bring
to market the second horn of the rhinoceros they have slain,
because, being flat, in place of round, it has not diameter or
substance enough to serve for the uses just spoken of; so that
the round horn is the only one that appears either at Gondar
or Cairo; and if we were to judge from this circumstance,
the African rhinoceros is unicorn for the same reason as
we do the Asiatic. The horns of this animal are hard and
solid, of a reddish brown on the outside, a yellow inclining
to gold within, and the heart a spot of black, which occupies
the space of near two inches where the diameter of
the horn is five. The surface takes a perfect polish, but
when dried is very liable to splinter and crack. It likewise
warps with heat, and scratches easily. And this was the
reason that, though exceeding beautiful when new, it never
would endure any time when made into the form of a
snuff-box, but warped and split with the heat of the pocket,
though this I believe was chiefly owing to the lamina, or
flat pieces into which it was cut, being always left too thin.
The foremost of these horns crook inward at the point, but
by no means with so sudden a curve as is represented by the
Count de Buffon. How sensible the animal is in this
part, may be known from the accident I was eye-witness
to in hunting him at Tcherkin, where a musquet-ball
breaking off a point of that horn, gave him such a
shock, as to deprive him for an instant of all appearance

94

of life. Behind the foremost, or crooked horn, is
the flat straight one, and again immediately behind that I
have seen distinctly the rudiments of a third, and the horn
full an inch long. If we may judge by its base, it would
seem this third horn was intended to be as long as the other
two.

The hunters of these large beasts are called Agageer,
from Agaro, to kill, by cutting the hams or tendon of Achilles
with a sword. I have already described the manner of
this hunting. These Agageers, the only people that have an
opportunity of observing, if they would only tell what they
do observe truly, say, they frequently see rhinoceroses
with three horns grown; that this last is round, but
does not crook at the point, and is not quite so long as
are the other two, nor tapered so much as the foremost
or crooked one; but this I leave entirely upon their veracity.
I never did see the animal myself, nor three
grown-horns adhering to each other, as I have seen two.
So if this is truth, here is a third species of this quadruped.
They say the third horn is only upon the male, and does
not grow till he is advanced in years; the double horn
which I have is fixed to a strong muscle or cartilage; when
dry, exceedingly tough. It comes down the
os frontis
, and
along the bone of the nose; but not having observed accurately
enough at the time the carcase was lying before me,
I do not remember how this muscle terminated or was
made fast, either at the occiput or on the nose. It has been
imagined by several that the horn of the rhinoceros and the
teeth of the elephant were arms which nature gave them
against each other: that want of food, and vexation from being
deprived of their natural habits, may make any two

95

beasts of nearly equal strength fight or destroy each other,
cannot be doubted; and accordingly we see that the Romans
made these two animals fight at shows and public games:
but this is not nature, but the artifice of man; there must
be some better reason for this extraordinary construction of
these two animals, as well as the different one of that of so
many others. They have been placed in extensive woods and
deserts, and there they hide themselves in the most inaccessible
places; food in great plenty is round about them; they
are not carnivorous, they are not rivals in love; what motive
can they have for this constant premeditated desire of fighting?

I have said the rhinoceros does not eat hay or grass, but
lives entirely upon trees; he does not spare the most thorny
ones, but rather seems to be fond of them; and it is not a
small branch that can escape his hunger, for he has the
strongest jaws of any creature I know, and best adapted to
grinding or bruising any thing that makes resistance. He
has twenty-eight teeth in all, six of which are grinders, and
I have seen short indigested pieces of wood full three inches
diameter voided in his excrements, and the same of the elephant.

But besides these trees, capable of most resistance, there
are in these vast forests within the rains, trees of a softer consistence,
and of a very succulent quality, which seem to be
destined for his principal food. For the purpose of gaining
the highest branches of these, his upper lip is capable of
being lengthened out so as to increase his power of laying
hold with this in the same manner as the elephant does
with his trunk. With this lip, and the assistance of his

96

tongue, he pulls down the upper branches which have most
leaves, and these he devours first; having stript the tree of
its branches, he does not therefore abandon it, but placing
his snout as low in the trunk as he finds his horn will enter,
he rips up the body of the tree, and reduces it to thin
pieces, like so many laths; and when he has thus prepared
it, he embraces as much of it as he can in his monstrous
jaws, and twists it round with as much ease as an ox would
do a root of celery, or any such pot-herb or garden-stuff.

Such, too, is the practice of the elephant; we saw, at every
step in these immense forests, trees in different progresses
of this operation, some divested of their leaves and branches,
and cut over as far down the trunk as was soft, and
pliable, and was capable of being snapped off by one bite,
without splitting or laceration; others, where the trunk was
cut into laths or ribbands, some of which were ate in part,
others prepared, but which had been left from satiety or apprehension
of danger, a feast without labour for the next
that should find it. In some places we saw the trees all consumed,
but a stump that remained about a foot from the
ground, and these were of the most succulent kind, and
there we distinctly perceived the beginning of the first laceration
from the bottom; and what, beside the testimony
of the hunters, confirmed this fact beyond doubt was, that
in several places large pieces of the teeth of elephants, and
horns of the rhinoceros were brought to us, partly found
lying on the ground at the foot of these trees, and part sticking
in them.

Neither the elephant nor rhinoceros eat grass; if their food
depended upon that, many times in the year they must be

97

reduced to a state of starving, for the grass is naturally parched
up in some seasons, and at others burnt purposely by the
Shangalla. It is true, that in Europe their chief food is
hay; trees cannot be every day spoiled for them in the
quantity they would need. But this is not their natural
food, more than the sugar and the aquavitÃ¦ that are given
them here.

The roughness of the tongue of the rhinoceros is another
matter in dispute: it is said to be so rough, that the animal
with that can lick off the flesh of a manâs bones. Others
say, the tongue is so soft that it resembles that of a calf.
Both of these are in some measure true, but aggravated by
the reporters. The tongue of the young Rhinoceros is soft,
for the skin is much tougher and thicker too, than that of
a calf, and has apparently some furrows or wrinkles in it,
but it has no pustules nor rudiments of any that are discernible,
nor indeed has any use for them. On the other
hand, the tongue and inside of the upper lip of the old Rhinoceros
are very rough, and this appears to me to arise
from the constant use he makes of these parts in seizing
the branches of trees which have rough barks, particularly
the acacia. It is, when pursued, and in fear, that we see
he possesses an astonishing degree of swiftness, considering
his size, the apparent unwieldyness of his body, his great
weight before, and the shortness of his legs. He is long,
and has a kind of trot, which, after a few minutes, increases
in a great proportion, and takes in a great distance; but
this is to be understood with a degree of moderation. It is
not true, that in a plain he beats the horse in swiftness. I
have passed him with ease, and seen many worse mounted
do the same, and though it is certainly true, that a horse

98

can very seldom come up with him, this is owing to his
cunning, but not his swiftness. He makes constantly from
wood to wood, and forces himself into the thickest part of
them. The trees that are frush, or dry, are broke down,
like as with a cannon shot, and fall behind him and on his
side in all directions. Others that are more pliable, greener,
or fuller of sap, are bent back by his weight and velocity
of his motion. And after he has passed, restoring themselves
like a green branch to their natural position, they
sweep the uncautious pursuer and his horse from the
ground, and dash them in pieces against the surrounding
trees.

The eyes of the Rhinoceros are very small, and he seldom
turns his head, and therefore sees nothing but what
is before him. To this he owes his death, and never escapes,
if there is so much plain as to enable the horse to
get before him. His pride and fury, then, makes him lay
aside all thoughts of escaping but by victory over his enemy.
He stands for a moment at bay, then, at a start, runs
straight forward at the horse, like the wild boar, whom in
his manner of action he very much resembles. The horse
easily avoids him, by turning short to aside, and this is the
fatal instant: The naked man, with the sword, drops from
behind the principal horseman, and unseen by the Rhinoceros,
who is seeking his enemy the horse, he gives him a
stroke across the tendon of the heel, which renders him incapable
of further flight or resistance.

In speaking of the great quantity of food necessary to
support this enormous mass, we must likewise consider the
vast quantity of water which he needs. No country but

99

that of the Shangalla, which he possesses, deluged with six
months rains, and full of large and deep basons, made in
the living rock, and shaded by dark woods from evaporation;
or watered by large and deep rivers, which never fall
low or to a state of dryness, can supply the vast draughts of
this monstrous creature; but it is not for drinking alone that
he frequents wet and marshy places; large, fierce, and strong
as he is, he must submit to prepare to defend himself against
the weakest of all adversaries. The great consumption
he constantly makes of food and water necessarily confines
him to certain limited spaces; for it is not every place
that can maintain him, he cannot emigrate, or seek his defence
among the sands of Atbara.

The fly, that unremitting persecutor of every animal that
lives in the black earth, does not spare the rhinoceros, nor
is afraid of his fierceness. He attacks him in the same manner
as he does the camel, and would as easily subdue him,
but for a stratagem which he practises for his preservation.
The time of the fly being the rainy season, the whole black
earth, as I have already observed, turns into mire. In the
night when the fly is at rest, he chooses a convenient place,
and there rolling himself in the mud, he clothes himself
with a kind of case, which defends him against his adversary
the following day. The wrinkles and plaits of his
skin serve to keep this muddy plaster firm upon him, all
but about his hips, shoulders, and legs, where it cracks and
falls off by motion, and leaves him exposed in those places
to the attacks of the fly. The itching and pain which follow
occasion him to rub himself in those parts against the
roughest trees, and this is at least one cause of the pustules

100

or tubercules which we see upon these places, both on the
elephant and rhinoceros. The Count de Buffon, who believes
these pustules to be natural parts of the creature, says,
in proof of this, that they have been found in the fÅtus of
a rhinoceros. I do not pretend to disbelieve this; it may be,
that these punctures happening to the old female at the
time she was with young, the impression of her sufferings
might have appeared upon the young one. However this
is, I cannot conceal that I have heard, not from hunters only,
but men worthy of credit, that this is the origin of these
protuberances; and many rhinoceroses, slain in Abyssinia,
are known to have been found at the season of the fly, with
their shoulders and buttocks bloody and excoriated. It is
likewise by no means true, that the skin of the rhinoceros
is hard or impenetrable like a board. I should rather suspect
this to be disease, or from a different habit acquired by
keeping; for in his wild state he is slain by javelins thrown
from indifferent hands, which I have seen buried three feet
in his body. A musket shot will go through him if it meets
not with the intervention of a bone; and the Shangalla kill
him by the worst and most inartificial arrows that ever were
used by any people practising that weapon, and cut him to
pieces afterwards with the very worst of knives.

I have said that, in the evening, he goes to welter in the
mire. He enjoys the rubbing himself there so much, and
groans and grunts so loud, that he is heard at a considerable
distance. The pleasure that he receives from this enjoyment,
and the darkness of the night, deprive him of his
usual vigilance and attention. The hunters, guided by his
noise, steal secretly upon him, and, while lying on the

101

ground, wound him with their javelins mostly in the belly
where the wound is mortal.

A surgeon of the Shaftesbury Indiaman was the first who
observed and mentioned a fact which has been rashly
enough declared a fable
43
. He observed on a rhinoceros
newly taken, after having weltered and coated itself in mud,
as above mentioned, several infects, such as millepides, or
scolopendra, concealed under the ply of the skin. With all
submission to my friendâs censure, I do not think he is in
this so right or candid as he usually is; not having been
out of his own country, at least in any country where he
could have seen a rhinoceros newly taken from weltering
in the mud, he could not possibly be a judge of this fact as
the officer of the Shaftesbury was, who saw the animal in
that state. Every one, I believe, have seen horses and cows
drinking in foul water seized by leeches, which have bled
them excessively, and swelled under the animalâs tongue to
a monstrous size. And I cannot say, with all submission to
better judgment, that it is more contrary to the nature of
things, that a leech should seize an animal, whose custom
is to welter in water, than a fly bite and deposit his eggs in
a camel in the sun-shine on land. But further I must bear
this testimony, that, while at Ras el Feel, two of these animals
were slain by the Ganjar hunters in the neighbourhood.
I was not at the hunting, but, though ill of the flux,
I went there on horseback before they had scraped off their
muddy covering. Under the plies of one I saw two or three
very large worms, not carnivorous ones, but the common

102

large worm of the garden. I saw likewise several animals
like earwigs, which I took for young scolopendrÃ¦, and two
small, white, land-snail shells. I sought no further, but
was told a number of different insects were found, and some
of them that sucked the blood, which I take to be a kind
of leech. There is then no sort of reason to accuse this
gentleman of telling a falsehood, only because he was a
better observer, and had better opportunities than others
have had, and it is indeed neither just nor decent; on the
contrary, it is a coarse manner of criticising, to tax a man
with falsehood when he speaks as an eye-witness, and has
said nothing physically impossible.

The rhinoceros shewn at the fair of St Germain, that
which the Count de Buffon and Mr Edwards saw, kept clean
in a stable for several years, I shall believe had neither worms
nor scolopendrÃ¦ upon it, neither does this officer of the
Shaftesbury report it had; but he says, that one covered with
mud, in which it had been weltering, had upon it animals
that are commonly found in that mud; and this neither
Mr Parsons nor Mr Edwards, nor the Count de Buffon, ever
had an opportunity of verifying.

Chardin
44
says, that the Abyssinians tame and train the
rhinoceros to labour. This is an absolute fable; besides,
that we have reason to believe the animal is not capable of
instruction, neither history not tradition ever gave the
smallest reason to make us believe this, nor is there any
motive for attempting the experiment, more than for believing

103

it ever was accomplished. Tractable as the elephant,
is, the Abyssinians never either tamed or instructed him;
they never made use of beasts in war, nor would their country
permit this training; so much the contrary, as we have
already seen, that Ptolemy Philadelphus, and his successor
Ptolemy Evergetes, did every thing in their power to persuade
them to take the elephant alive, that they might tame
them; but, as he was a principal part of their food, they never
could succeed; and the latter prince, for this very purpose,
made an expedition into Abyssinia, and was obliged to extirpate
these hunters, and settle in their place a colony of his own
at Arkeeko near Masuah, which he called Ptolemais Theron
for that very reason; after which, he himself tells us in the
long Greek inscription he left in the kingdom of Adel, that he
had succeeded so far, by means of his colony of Greeks, as to
train the Ethiopic elephant so as to make him superior to those
in India; but this he could never do by employing Abyssinians.

It is a general observation made in every part where
this animal resides, that he is indocile, and wants talents;
his fierceness may be conquered, and we see, with a moderate
degree of attention, he is brought to be quiet enough; but
it is one thing to tame or conquer his fierceness, and another
to make him capable of instruction; and it seems apparently
allowed to be his case, that he has not capacity. A
steady, uniform fierceness in the brute creation, is to be subdued
by care and by hunger, this is not the case with
him, his violent transports of fury upon being hungry, or
not being served in the instant with food, seems to bar this
manner of taming him. His behaviour is not that of any
other animal; his revenge and fury are directed as much
against himself as against an enemy; he knocks his head

104

against the wall, or the manger, with a seeming intention to
destroy himself, nay, he does destroy himself often. That
sent from India to Emanuel king of Portugal, in the year
1513, and by him presented to the pope, was the cause the
ship
45
that carried him was sunk and lost, and the one that
was shewn in France purposely drowned itself going to Italy.

The rhinoceros and the elephant are the principal food
of the Shangalla. The manner of preparing the flesh I
have already described, and shall not repeat. He is ate
too with great greediness by all the inhabitants of the
low country, and Atbara. The most delicate part about
him is supposed to be the soles of his feet, which are
soft like those of a camel, and of a gristly substance;
the rest of the flesh seems to resemble that of the hog, but
is much coarser. It smells of musk, and is otherwise very
tasteless; I should think it would be more so to the negroes
and hunters, who eat it without salt. The only hair about
it is at the tip of its tail; they are there few and scattered,
but thick as the lowest wire of a harpsichord; ten of these,
fastened side by side, at the distance of half an inch from
each other, in the figure of a manâs hand, make a whip
which will bring the blood every stroke.

This rhinoceros was thirteen feet from the nose to its
anus; and very little less than seven feet when he stood,
measuring from the sole of his fore-foot to the top of the
shoulder. The first horn was fourteen inches. The second

105

something less than thirteen inches. The flat part of the
horn, where it was bare at its base, and divested of hair,
was four inches, and the top two inches and a half broad.
In the middle it was an inch and quarter thick; it was shaped
like a knife; the back two inches, and, when turned,
measured one fourth of an inch at the edge.

It seems now to be a point agreed upon by travellers and
naturalists, that the famous animal, having one horn only
upon his forehead, is the fanciful creation of poets and
painters; to them I should willingly leave it, but a Swedish
naturalist, Dr Sparman, who has lately published two volumes
in quarto, in which he has distinguished himself
by his low illiberal abuse of learned foreigners, as much
as by the fulsome flattery he has bestowed on his own
countrymen, has shewed an inclination to revive this antiquated
fable. I do not, for my own part, believe the authority
will be thought sufficient, or have many followers.
The publisher, by way of apology, as suppose, for his rusticity
and ill-manners, says, that he was employed in labour
to earn a sufficient sum upon which to travel. What labour
he applied to is not said; it was not a lucrative occupation
surely, or the Doctor was not an able labourer, as
the sum produced was but 38 dollars, and I really think
his knowledge acquired seems to be pretty much in proportion
to his funds.

Kolbe mentions what would seem a variety of the rhinoceros
at the Cape. He says it has one horn upon its nose,
and another upon his forehead. This the Count de Buffon
thinks is untrue, and, from other circumstances of the narrative,
supposes that Kolbe never saw this rhinoceros, and

106

has described it only from hearsay. Though this, too, is
Doctor Sparmanâs opinion, yet, unwilling to let slip an opportunity
of contradicting the Count de Buffon, he taxes it
as an improper criticism upon this rhinoceros of Kolbe: he
says the description is a just one, and that a man of the
Countâs learning should have known that the forehead and
nose of all animals were
near
each other. Although he has given
a strange drawing of the skeleton of the head of a rhinoceros,
where the nose and the forehead are very distinctly
different, yet, in another drawing, he has figured his rhinoceros
bicornis, with a head seemingly all nose, and much
liker an ass than any thing we have seen pretended to be
a rhinoceros ever since the time of Albert Durer. He pretends
that, in his travels at the Cape, he saw an animal of
this form, which had two horns upon his forehead, or his
nose, whichever he pleases to call them. If such an animal
does really exist, it is undoubtedly a new species; it has
not the armour or plaited skin, seen in every rhinoceros
till this time. He tells us a heap of wonderful stories
about it, and claims the honour of being the first discoverer
of it; and really, I believe, he is so far in the right, that
if he can prove what he says to be true, there is no man that
will pretend to dispute this point with him. Besides its
having a skin without plaits, it has two horns on the forehead,
so loose that they clash against one another, and make
a noise when the animal is running: then he has one of
these only that are moveable, which he turns to one side or
the other when he chooses to dig roots; an imagination
scarcely possible, I think, to any one who has ever seen a
rhinoceros. With these loose and clashing horns he diverts
himself by throwing a man and horse into the air; and,
though but five feet high, at other times he throws a loaded,

107

covered waggon, drawn by two oxen, over hedges into
the fields.

This rhinoceros very luckily is not carnivorous, for he
is among the swiftest of animals, and smells and scents people
at a great distance; and yet, with all these advantages,
though his constant occupation, according to Dr Sparman,
seems to be hunting waggons and men also, he never was
so successful as to kill but one man, as far as was ever
known.

HYÃNA.

There
are few animals, whose history has passed under
the consideration of naturalists, that have given occasion
to so much confusion and equivocation as the HyÃ¦na
has done. It began very early among the ancients, and
the moderns have fully contributed their share. It is not
my intention to take up the readerâs time with discussing
the errors of others, whether ancient or modern. Without

108

displaying a great deal of learning to tell him what it
is not, I shall content myself with informing him what it
is, by a good figure and distinct relation of what in his
history hath been unknown, or omitted, and put it in
the readerâs power to reject any of the pretended HyÃ¦nas
that authors or travellers should endeavour to impose
upon him. At the same time, I shall submit to his
decision, whether the animal I mention is a new one, or
only a variety of the old, as it must on all hands be allowed
that he is as yet undescribed.

Most of the animals confounded with him are about
six times smaller than he is, and some there are that do not
even use their four legs, but only two. The want of a
critical knowledge in the Arabic language, and of natural
history at the same time, has in some measure been the occasion
of this among the moderns. Bochart
46
discusses
the several errors of the ancients with great judgment, and
the Count de Buffon
47
, in a very elegant and pleasant manner,
hath nearly exhausted the whole.

I do not think there is any one that hath hitherto written
of this animal who ever saw the thousandth part of
them that I have. They were a plague in Abyssinia in every
situation, both in the city and in the field, and I think
surpassed the sheep in number. Gondar was full of them
from the time it turned dark till the dawn of day, seeking
the different pieces of slaughtered carcases which this cruel

109

and unclean people expose in the streets without burial,
and who firmly believe that these animals are Falasha from
the neighbouring mountains, transformed by magic, and
come down to eat human flesh in the dark in safety. Many
a time in the night, when the king had kept me late in the
palace, and it was not my duty to lie there, in going across
the square from the kingâs house, not many hundred
yards distant, I have been apprehensive they would bite me
in the leg. They grunted in great numbers about me,
though I was surrounded with several armed men, who
seldom passed a night without wounding or slaughtering
some of them.

One night in Maitsha, being very intent on observation,
I heard something pass behind me towards the bed, but upon
looking round could perceive nothing. Having finished
what I was then about, I went out of my tent, resolving directly
to return, which I immediately did, when I perceived
large blue eyes glaring at me in the dark. I called upon
my servant with a light, and there was the hyÃ¦na standing
nigh the head of the bed, with two or three large bunches
of candles in his mouth. To have fired at him I was in
danger of breaking my quadrant or other furniture, and he
seemed, by keeping the candles steadily in his mouth, to wish
for no other prey at that time. As his mouth was full, and
he had no claws to tear with, I was not afraid of him, but
with a pike struck him as near the heart as I could judge.
It was not till then he shewed any sign of fierceness; but,
upon feeling his wound, he let drop the candles, and endeavoured
to run up the shaft of the spear to arrive at me, so
that, in self defence, I was obliged to draw out a pistol from
my girdle and shoot him, and nearly at the same time my

110

servant cleft his skull with a battle-ax. In a word, the hyÃ¦na
was the plague of our lives, the terror of our night-walks,
the destruction of our mules and asses, which above all others
are his favourite food. Many instances of this the
reader will meet with throughout my Travels.

The hyÃ¦na is known by two names in the east, Deeb
and Dubbah. His proper name is Dubbah, and this is the
name he goes by among the best Arabian naturalists. In
Abyssinia, Nubia, and part of Arabia, he is, both in writing
and conversation, called Deeb, or Deep, either ending with
a b or p; and here the confusion begins, for though Dubbah
is properly a hyÃ¦na, Dabbu is a species of monkey;
and though Deeb is likewise a hyÃ¦na, the same word signifies
a jackal; and a jackal being by naturalists called a
wolf, Deeb is understood to be a wolf also. In Algiers this
difference is preserved strictly; Dubbah is the hyÃ¦na; Deeb
is the jackal, which run in flocks in the night, crying like
hounds. Dubb is a bear, so here is another confusion, and
the bear is taken for the hyÃ¦na, because Dubb, or Dubbah,
seems to be the same word. So Poncet, on the frontiers of
Sennaar, complains, that one of his mules was bit in the
thigh by a bear, though it is well known there never was
any animal of the bear-kind in that, or, I believe, in any
other part of Africa. And I strongly apprehend, that the
leopards and tigers, which Alvarez and Don Roderigo de
Lima mention molested them so much in their journey to
Shoa, were nothing else but hyÃ¦nas. For tigers there are
certainly none in Abyssinia; it is an Asiatic animal. Though
there are leopards, yet they are but few in number, and are
not gregarious, neither, indeed, are the hyÃ¦nas, only as they

111

gather in flocks, lured by the smell of their food; and of
these it would seem there are many in Shoa, for the capital
of that province, called Tegulat, means the City of the
HyÃ¦na.

If the description given by M. de Buffon is an elegant
and good one, the draught of the animal is no less so. It
is exactly the same creature I have seen on Mount Libanus
and at Aleppo, which makes me have the less doubt that
there are two species of this animal, the one partaking more
of the dog, which is the animal I am now describing, the
other more of the nature of the hog, which is the hyÃ¦na of
M. de Buffon. Of this the reader will be easily satisfied, by
comparing the two figures and the measures of them. The
same distinction there is in the badger.

The animal from which this was drawn was slain at Teawa,
and was the largest I had ever seen, being five feet
nine inches in length, measuring from his nose to his anus;
whereas the hyÃ¦na exhibited by M. de Buffon was not
half that, it being only three feet two inches nine lines in
length. Notwithstanding the great superiority in size by
which the hyÃ¦na of Atbara exceeded that of M. de Buffon,
I did not think him remarkable for his fatness, or that he owed
any of his size to his being at that time in more than ordinary
keeping; on the contrary, I thought the most of those
I had before seen were in a better habit of body. As near
as I could guess, he might weigh about 8 stone, horsemanâs
weight, that is, 14 pound to the stone, or 112 pound.

The length of his tail, from the longest hair in it to its
insertion above the anus, was one foot nine inches. It was

112

composed of strong hair of a reddish, brown colour, without
any rings or bands of blackness upon the points. In
the same manner, the mane consisted of hairs exactly similar
both in colour and substance, being longer as they approached
the neck, where they were about seven inches
long; and though it was obvious that, upon being irritated,
he could raise them upon his back, yet they were not rigid
enough, and were too long to have the resistance of bristles
of the hog or boar. This mane reached above two inches
beyond the occiput between his ears, but then turned short,
and ended there.

From the occiput to his nose he was one foot three inches
and a half. The length of the nose, from the bottom of
the forehead, was five inches and a half, in shape much
like that of a dog, the whole head, indeed, more so than
that of the wolf or any other creature. The aperture of
the eye was two inches nearly; that of the mouth, when
not gaping or snarling, about four inches and a half. The
ear, from its base to its extreme point, was nine inches and
a quarter; it was mostly bare, or covered with very thin,
short hair. From the inside of one ear to that of the other,
measured across the forehead, was seven inches and a half.
From the edge of the opening of one eye to that of the other,
measured in the same manner, it was three inches nearly.
From the sole of the fore-foot, as it stood on the ground,
to the top of the back above the shoulder, it was three feet
seven inches; but his back was smooth and plain, not rising
or curved as the hyÃ¦na of M. de Buffon appears to have
been. The fore-leg was two feet in length, the foot flat,
and four inches broad. From the sole of the foot to the
middle of the fore joint was six inches and a half, and this

113

joint seemed to be ill-made, and as it were crooked and half
bent. He has four toes, and a straight nail between each
of them, greatly resembling that of a dog, strong and
black, but by no means calculated for tearing animals, and
as little for digging, by which occupation he is said chiefly
to get his food.

He stands ill upon his hind-legs, nor can his measure there
be marked with precision. It is observable in all hyÃ¦nas,
that when they are first dislodged from cover, or obliged to
run, they limp so remarkably that it would appear the hind-leg
was broken, and this has often deceived me; but, after
they have continued to run some time, this affection goes
entirely away, and they move very swiftly. To what this
is owing it is impossible for me to say. I expected to have
found something likely to be the origin of it in the dissection
of this animal given by M. de Buffon, but no such
thing appears, and I fear it is in vain to look for it elsewhere.

I apprehend from the sole of his hind-foot to the joining
of the thigh at his belly, was nearer two feet seven inches
than any other measure. The belly is covered with
hair very little softer and shorter than that of his back. It
grows shorter as it approaches his hind-legs. His colour is
of a yellowish brown, the head and ears the lightest part
of him. The legs are marked thick with black bands which
begin at the lower hinder joint, then continue very dark in
colour till the top of the thigh, where they turn broad and
circular, reaching across the whole side. Over the shoulder
are two semicircular bands likewise, then come very frequent
bands down the outside of the fore-leg in the same

114

manner as the hind. The inside of all his legs are without
marks, so are the neck, head, and ears, but a little above
the thorax is a large black streak which goes up along the
throat, and down to the point of the lower jaw. His nose
is black, and above the point, for some inches, is of a dark
colour also.

The HyÃ¦na is one of those animals which commentators
have taken for the Saphan, without any probability
whatever, further than he lives in caves, whither he retires
in the summer to avoid being tormented with flies. Clement
48

of Alexandria introduces Moses saying, You shall
not eat the hare, nor the hyÃ¦na, as he interprets the word
saphan; but the HyÃ¦na does not chew the cud; they are
not, as I say, gregarious, though they troop together upon
the smell of food. We have no reason to attribute extraordinary
wisdom to him; he is on the contrary brutish, indolent,
slovenly, and impudent, and seems to possess much
the manners of the wolf. His courage appears to proceed
from an insatiable appetite, and has nothing of the brave
or generous in it, and he dies oftener flying than fighting;
but least of all can it be said of him that he is a
feeble folk
,
being one of the strongest beasts of the field.

Upon the most attentive consideration, the animal here represented
seems to be of a different species from the hyÃ¦na
of M. de Buffon. This of Atbara seems to be a dog, whereas
the first sight of the hyÃ¦na of M. de Buffon gives the idea of
a hog, and this is the impression it seems to have made upon

115

the first travellers that describe him. Kempfer
49
calls him
Taxus Porcinus, and says he has bristles like a hog.

We have an example of variety of this sort in the badger.
There is a sow of that kind, and a dog. The dog is carnivorous,
and the sow lives upon vegetables, though both of
them have been suspected at times to eat and devour animal
food.

The hyÃ¦na about Mount Libanus, Syria, the north of Asia, and
also about Algiers, is known to live for the most part upon large
succulent, bulbous roots, especially those of the fritillaria, and
such large, fleshy, vegetable substances. I have known large
spaces of fields turned up to get at onions or roots of those
plants, and these were chosen with such care, that, after having
been peeled, they have been refused and left on the ground
for a small rotten spot being discovered in them. It will be
observed the hyÃ¦na has no claws either for seizing or separating
animal food, that he might feed upon it, and I therefore
imagine his primitive manner of living was rather upon
vegetables than upon flesh, as it is certain he still continues
his liking to the former; and I apprehend it is from
an opportunity offering in a hungry time that he has ventured
either upon man or beast, for few carnivorous
animals, such as lions, tigers, and wolves, ever feed upon
both.

As to the charge against him of his disturbing sepulchres,
I fancy it is rather supposed from his being unable

116

to seize his living prey that he is thought to attach himself
to the dead. Upon much inquiry I never found one example
fairly proved. The graves in the east are built over
with mason-work; and though it is against the law of the
Turks to repair these when they fall down, yet the body
is probably consumed long before that happens; nor is
the hyÃ¦na provided with arms or weapons to attempt it in
its entire state; and the large plants and flowers, with
fleshy bulbous roots, are found generally in plenty among
the graves.

But the hyÃ¦na of Atbara seems long to have abandoned
his primitive food of roots, if that was ever his, and to have
gone largely and undeniably into the slaughter of living
creatures, especially that of men. Indeed, happily for himself,
he has adopted this succedaneum; for as to roots or
fruit of any kind, they are not to be found in the desert
country where he has chosen his domicil; and he has no
difficulty from the sepulchres, because whole nations perish
without one of them being buried. Add to this, that the
depravity of human nature, the anarchy and bad government
of the country, have given him greater opportunities
than anywhere else in the world to obtain frequent and
easy victories over man.

It is a constant observation in Numidia, that the lion avoids
and flies from the face of man, till by some accident
they have been brought to engage, and the beast has prevailed
against him; then that feeling of superiority imprinted by
the Creator in the heart of all animals for manâs preservation,
seems to forsake him. The lion, having once tasted
human blood, relinquishes the pursuit after the flock. He

117

repairs to some high way or frequented path, and has been
known, in the kingdom of Tunis, to interrupt the road to
a market for several weeks; and in this he persists till
hunters or soldiers are sent out to destroy him.

The same, but in a much greater extent, happens in Atbara.
The Arabs, the inhabitants of that country, live in
encampments in different parts of the country, their ancient
patrimony or conquest. Here they plow and sow, dig wells,
and have plenty of water; the ground produces large crops,
and all is prosperity so long as there is peace. Insolence
and presumption follow ease and riches. A quarrel happens
with a neighbouring clan, and the first act of hostility,
or decisive advantage, is the one burning the others
crop at the time when it is near being reaped. Inevitable
famine follows; they are provided with no stores, no stock
in hand, their houses are burnt, their wells filled up, the
men slain by their enemies, and many thousands of the
helpless remainder left perfectly destitute of necessaries;
and that very spot, once a scene of plenty, in a few days is
reduced to an absolute desert. Most of the miserable survivors
die before they can reach the next water; they have
no subsistence by the way; they wander among the acacia-trees,
and gather gum. There, every day losing their
strength, and destitute of all hope, they fall spontaneously,
as it were, into the jaws of the merciless hyÃ¦na, who finding
so very little difference or difficulty between slaying the living
and devouring the dead, follows the miserable remains
of this unfortunate multitude, till he has extirpated
the last individual of them. Thence it comes that we find
it remarked in my return through the desert, that the
whole country is strewed with bones of the dead; horrid

118

monuments of the victories of this savage animal, and of
man more savage and cruel than he. From the ease with
which he overcomes these half-starved and unarmed people,
arises the calm, steady confidence in which he surpasses
all the rest of his kind.

In Barbary I have seen the Moors in the day-time take
this animal by the ears and pull him towards them, without
his attempting any other resistance than that of his drawing
back: and the hunters, when his cave is large enough to
give them admittance, take a torch in their hand, and go
straight to him; when, pretending to fascinate him by a
senseless jargon of words which they repeat, they throw a
blanket over him, and haul him out. He seems to be stupid
or senseless in the day, or at the appearance of strong light,
unless when pursued by the hunters.

I have locked up a goat, a kid, and a lamb with him all
day when he was fasting, and found them in the evening,
alive and unhurt. Repeating the experiment one night, he
ate up a young ass, a goat, and a fox, all before morning, so
as to leave nothing but some small fragments of the assâs
bones.

In Barbary, then, he has no courage by day; he flies
from man, and hides himself from him: But in Abyssinia
or Atbara, accustomed to manâs flesh, he walks boldly in
the day-time like a horse or mule, attacks man wherever he
finds him, whether armed or unarmed, always attaching
himself to the mule or ass in preference to the rider. I may
safely say, I speak within bounds, that I have fought him above
fifty times hand to hand, with a lance or spear, when

119

I had fallen unexpectedly upon him among the tents, or in
defence of my servants or beasts. Abroad and at a distance
the gun prevented his nearer approach; but in the night,
evening, or morning, we were constantly in close engagement
with him.

This frequent victory over man, and his daily feeding
upon him without resistance, is that from which he surely
draws his courage. Whether to this food it is that he owes
his superior size, I will not pronounce. For my own part, I
consider him as a variety of the same rather than another
species. At the same time I must say, his form gave me distinctly
the idea of a dog, without one feature or likeness
of the hog, as was the case with the Syrian hyÃ¦na living
on Mount Libanus, which is that of M. de Buffon, as plainly
appears by his drawing.

I have oftentimes hinted in the course of my Travels at
the liking he has for mules and asses; but there is another
passion for which he is still more remarkable, that is, his
liking to dogâs flesh, or, as it is commonly expressed, his aversion
to dogs. No dog, however fierce, will touch him in
the field. My greyhounds, accustomed to fasten upon the
wild boar, would not venture to engage with him. On the
contrary, there was not a journey I made that he did not
kill several of my greyhounds, and once or twice robbed
me of my whole flock: he would seek and seize them in the
servants tents where they were tied, and endeavour to carry
them away before the very people that were guarding
them.

120

This animosity between him and dogs, though it has
escaped modern naturalists, appears to have been known to
the ancients in the east. In Ecclesiasticus (chap. xiii. ver. 18.)
it is said, âWhat agreement is there between the hyÃ¦na
and the dog?â a sufficient proof that the antipathy was so
well known as to be proverbial.

And I must here observe, that if there is any precision in
the definition of LinnÃ¦us, this animal does not answer to it,
either in the cauda recta or annulata, for he never carries his
tail erect, but always close behind him like a dog when afraid,
or unless when he is in full speed; nor is the figure given
by M. de Buffon marked like the hyÃ¦na of Atbara, though,
as have I said, perfectly resembling that of Syria, and the
figure I have here given has, I believe, scarcely a hair misplaced
in it. Upon the whole, I submit this entirely to my
reader, being satisfied with having, I hope, fully proved
what was the intent of this dissertation, that the saphan is
not the hyÃ¦na, as Greek commentators upon the scripture
have imagined.

JERBOA.

I have
already observed that the Arabs have confounded
the Saphan with several other animals that have no
sort of resemblance to it; there are two of these very remarkable,
the Fennec and Jerboa, of which I am now to treat.
As I have given excellent figures of both, by drawings taken
from the creatures alive, I have no doubt I shall prevent
any confusion for the future, and throw some light
upon sacred scripture, the greatest profit and use that can
result from this sort of writing.

If the rabbit has been frequently confounded with the
saphan, and stood for it in the interpretation of the Hebrew
text, the same has likewise happened to another animal, the
Jerboa, still more dissimilar in form and in manners from the
saphan, than even the rabbit itself, and much less known.
The Jerboa is a small harmless animal of the desert, nearly
the size of a common rat: the skin very smooth and shining,
of a brown tinged with yellow or gold colour, and the ends
of the hairs tipt with black. It lives in the smoothest plains
or places of the desert, especially where the soil is fixed gravel,

122

for in that chiefly it burrows, dividing its hole below
into many mansions. It seems to be apprehensive of the
falling in of the ground; it therefore generally digs its hole
under the root of some spurge, thyme, or absinthium, upon
whose root it seems to depend for its roof not falling in and
burying it in the ruins of its subterraneous habitation. It
seems to delight most in those places that are haunted by
the cerastes, or horned viper. Nature has certainly imposed
this dangerous neighbourhood upon the one for the good
and advantage of the other, and that of mankind in general.
Of the many trials I made, I never found a Jerboa in the
body of a viper, excepting once in that of a female big with
young, and the Jerboa itself was then nearly consumed.

The Jerboa, for the most part, stands upon his hind-legs;
he rests himself by sitting backwards sometimes, and I have
seen him, though rarely, as it were lie upon all four; whether
that is from fatigue or sickness, or whether it is a natural
posture, I know not. The Jerboa of the Cyrenaicum
is six inches and a quarter in length, as he stands in the
drawing. He would be full half an inch more if he was
laid straight at his length immediately after death. The
head, from his nose to the occiput, is one inch two lines.
From the nose to the foremost angle of the eye, six lines.
The opening of the eye itself is two lines and a quarter;
his ears three quarters of an inch in length, and a quarter
of an inch in breadth; they are smooth, and have no hair
within, and but very little without; of an equal breadth
from bottom to top, do not diminish to a point, but are
rounded there. The buttocks are marked with a semicircle
of black, which parts from the root of the tail, and ends
at the top of the thigh. This gives it the air of a compound

123

animal, a rat with birdâs legs, to which the flying posture
still adds resemblance. From this stroke to the center of
the eye is three inches, and to the point of his toe the same
measure; his tail is six inches and a quarter long, seems
aukwardly set on, as stuck between his buttocks, without
any connection with his spine; half of it is poorly covered
with hair of a light or whiter colour than his body; the other
half is a beautiful feather of long hair, the middle
white, the edges jet black: this tail, which by its length
would seem an incumbrance to him, is of a surprising advantage
in guiding and directing him in his jumping.

From the shoulder to the elbow of the fore-foot is half
an inch: from the elbow to the joining of the paw,
5/8ths of an inch. The claw itself is curved, and is something
less than a quarter of an inch. It has very long mustachoes,
some of them standing backward, and some of
them forward from his nose; they are all of unequal
lengths, the longest an inch and a half; his belly is
white: he seems to be of a very cleanly nature, his hair always
in great order. From his snout to the back part of
the opening of the mouth is half an inch; his nose projects
beyond his under jaw three quarters of an inch. He
has four toes in his hind-foot, and a small one behind his
heel, where is a tuft of hair coloured black. The fore-foot
hath three toes only.

The ancients have early described this animal; we see
him in some of the first medals of the Cyrenaicum, sitting
under an umbellated plant, supposed to be the silphium,
whose figure is preserved to us on the silver medals of Cyrene.
The high price set upon it is mentioned by several historians,

124

but the reason of that value, or the use of the plant,
I have never yet been able to comprehend. I suppose it was
an adventitious plant, which the curiosity and correspondence
of the princes of that state had probably brought
from some part of Negroland, where the goats are brousing
upon it at this day with indifference enough, unconscious
of the price it bore in the time of the Ptolemies.

Herodotus
50
, Theophrastus
51
, and Aristotle
52
, all mention
this animal under the name of Î´Î¹ÏÎ¿Ï
Ï, Î³Î±Î»Î±Î¹ Î´Î¹ÏÎ¿Î´ÎµÏ or,
two-footed rats. This animal is found in most of the parts
of Arabia and Syria, in every part of the southern deserts
of Africa, but no where so frequently, and in such numbers,
as in the Cyrenaicum, or Pentapolis. In my unfortunate
journey there, I employed the Arabs, together with
my servants, to kill a number with sticks, so as that the
skins might not be injured by shot. I got them dressed in
Syria and in Greece, and sewed together, making use of
the tail as in ermine for the lining of a cloak, and they
had a very good effect; the longer they wore, the glossier
and finer appearance the skins made. The Jerboa is very
fat and well-coloured; the buttocks, thighs, and part of
the back, are roasted and ate by the Arabs. I have eaten
them; they are not distinguishable from a young rabbit
either in colour or taste; they have not even the strong
taste the rabbit has. Some writers have confounded these
two animals together; at least they have mistaken this for

125

the saphan, and the saphan for the rabbit. This, however,
is plainly without foundation. These long legs, and the
necessity of leaping, demand the plain ground, where nature
has always placed this creature.

The Arabs Ibn Bitar, Algiahid, Alcamus, and Damir, and
many others, have known the animal perfectly, though
some of them seem to confound it with another called the
Ashkoko. Ibnalgiauzi says, that the Jerboa is the only
kind that builds in rocks, which from ten thousand examples
I am sure he does not, nor is he any way made for it,
and I am very certain he is not gregarious. They have a
number of holes indeed in the same place, but I do not remember
ever to have seen more than two together at a
time. The Arab Canonists are divided whether or not he
can be lawfully eaten. Ibnalgiauzi is of opinion he cannot,
nor any other animal living under the ground, excepting
the land crocodile, which he calls El Dabb, a large lizard,
said to be useful in venereal pursuits, Ata and Achmet, Benhantal,
and several others, expressly say, that the eating of
the Jerboa is lawful. But this seems to be an indulgence,
as we read in Damir, that the use of this animal is granted
because the Arabs delight in it. And Ibn Bitar says, that
the Jerboa is called Israelitish, that the flesh of it is dried in
the outward air, is very nourishing, and prevents costiveness,
from which we should apprehend, that medicinal considerations
entered into this permission likewise. However this
may be, it seems to me plain, such was not the opinion of the
old translators of the Arab version from the Hebrew; they
once only name this animal expressly, and there they say it
is forbidden. The passage is in Isaiah,
126
âThey that sanctify
themselves and purify themselves in the gardens
behind one tree in the midst, eating swineâs flesh,
and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed
together, saith the Lord
53
.â The Hebrew word signifies
mouse, and so our English translation renders it. But the
Arabic version calls it expressly the Jerboa, and classes it
with the abomination and swineâs flesh, that is, in the class
of things in the highest degree forbidden.

There is little variety in this animal either in size or colour,
in the wide range that they inhabit. Towards Aleppo
they have broader noses than the African ones, their bodies
also thicker, and their colour lighter; a thing we always see
in the Syrian animals, compared to the African. The first
of these I saw was in London, in the hands of Dr Russel,
who has wrote the history of Aleppo, of whom I have before
made mention. Haym published an account of the Jerboa,
so does Dr Shaw, but there exists not, that I know, one good
figure of him, or particular description.

The figure given us by Edwards is thick and short, out of
all proportion. His legs are too short, his feet too large, he
wants the black mark upon his heel, the nails of his forefeet
are greatly too long, and there is certainly a latitude
taken in the description, when his head is said very much
to resemble that of a rabbit. Dr Hasselquist has given us a
kind of description of him without a figure. He says the
Arabs call him Garbuka, but this is not so, he goes by no
other name in all the east, but that of Jerboa, only the letter
J, sometimes by being pronounced Y, for Jerboa he is
called Yerboa, and this is the only variation in name.

127

The Arabs of the kingdom of Tripoli make very good
diversion with the Jerboa, in training their grey-hounds,
which they employ to hunt the gazel or antelope after instructing
him to turn nimbly by hunting this animal. The
prince of Tunis, son of Sidi Younis, and grandson of Ali Bey,
who had been strangled by the Algerines when that capital
was taken, being then in exile at Algiers, made me a
present of a small grey-hound, which often gave us excellent
sport. It may be perhaps imagined a chace between
these two creatures could not be long, yet I have often
seen, in a large inclosure, or court-yard, the greyhound
employ a quarter of an hour before he could master his
nimble adversary; the small size of the creature assisted him
much, and had not the greyhound been a practised one,
and made use of his feet as well as his teeth, he might
have killed two antelopes in the time he could have killed
one Jerboa.

It is the character of the saphan given in scripture, that
he is gregarious, that he lives in houses made in the rock,
that he is distinguished for his feebleness, which he supplies
by his wisdom: none of these characteristics agree
with the Jerboa, and therefore though he chews the cud in
common with some others, and was in great plenty in
Judea, so as to be known by Solomon, yet he cannot be the
saphan of the scripture.

128

FENNEC.

This
beautiful animal, which has lately so much excited
the curiosity, and exercised the pens rather than the
judgment of some naturalists, was brought to me at Algiers
by Mahomet Rais, my drugoman or janizary, while
consul-general to his Majesty in that regency.

Mahomet Rais bought it for two sequins from an acquaintance,
a Turkish oldash, or foot-soldier, just then returned
from Biscara, a southern district of Mauritania CÃ¦sariensis,
now called the Province of Constantina. The soldier said
they were not uncommon in Biscara, but more frequently
met with in the neighbouring date territories of Beni Mezzab
and Werglah, the ancient habitations of the Melano-GÃ¦tuli;
in the last mentioned of which places they hunted
them for their skins, which they sent by the caravan to

129

sell at Mecca, and from whence they were after exported to
India. He said that he had endeavoured to bring three of
them, two of which had escaped by gnawing holes in the
cage. I kept this for several months at my country-house
near Algiers, that I might learn its manners. I made several
drawings of it, particularly one in water-colours of its
natural size, which has been the original of all those bad
copies that have since appeared. Having satisfied myself of
all particulars concerning it, and being about to leave Algiers,
I made a present of him to Captain Cleveland, of his
majestyâs ship PhÅnix, then in that port, and he gave him
to Mr Brander, Swedish consul in Algiers. A young man,
Balugani, of whom I have already spoken, then in my service,
in which, indeed, he died, allowed himself so far to be
surprised, as, unknown to me, to trace upon oiled paper a
copy of this drawing in water-colours, just now mentioned.
This he did so servilely, that it could not be mistaken, and
was therefore, as often as it appeared, known to be a
copy by people
54
the least qualified to judge in these matters.
The affectation of the posture in which it was sitting, the
extraordinary breadth of its feet, the unnatural curve of
the tail, to shew the black part of it, the affected manner of
disposing its ears, were all purposely done, to shew particular
details that I was to describe, after the animal itself should
be lost, or its figure, through length of time, should be less-fresh
in my memory.

London Publishâd Dec.

st
1789. by G. Robinson & Co.

Doctor Sparman, with his natural dullness, and a disingenuousness
which seems partly natural, partly acquired,

130

and improved by constant plagiarisms, from the works of
others, pretends in favour of his country and countrymen,
to steal this into a Swedish discovery. He says that Mr Brander
has published an account of it in some Swedish transactions,
a book I never saw, but that being long importuned
by his friend Mr Nicander, to give the figure of the animal
itself to be published, he constantly refused it.

Whether this fact is so or not, I do not pretend to give
my opinion: if it is, I cannot but think Mr Branderâs conduct
in both cases was extremely proper. The creature itself
passed, by very fair means, from my possession into Mr Branderâs,
who cannot doubt that I would have given it to him
in preference to Mr Cleveland, if I had known he thought it
of the least consequence; he was then, as having had the animal
by just means in his possession, as much entitled to describe
him as I was; or as the Turk, the prior possessor,
who gave him to me, had he been capable, and so inclined.
On the other hand, Mr Brander likewise judged very properly
in refusing to publish the drawing at the request of
Mr Nicander. The drawing was not justly acquired, as it
was obtained by a breach of faith, and seduction of a
servant, which might have cost him his bread. It was conducted
with a privacy seldom thought necessary to fair dealing,
nor was it ever known to me, till the young man began
to be dangerously sick at Tunis, when he declared it voluntarily
to me, with a contrition, that might have atoned
for a much greater breach of duty.

Dr Sparman attempts to conceal these circumstances. He
says Mr Brander told him, that I saw this animal at Algiers,
and that I employed the same painter that he did to make

131

the drawing of him, and speaks of a painter found at Algiers
as readily as if he had been at the gates of Rome or
Naples. These are the wretched subterfuges of low minds,
as distant from science as they are from honour and virtue.
Why, if the animal was equally known to Mr Brander
and me, did he not, when writing upon it, give his
name, his manners, the uses to which he was destined, and
the places where he resided? why send to Algiers for an
account of him, after having him so long in his possession,
since at Algiers he was probably as great a stranger as he
was at Stockholm? why call him a fox, or pronounce his
genus, yet write to Algiers for particulars to decide what
that genus was?

The Count of Buffon
55
, content with the merit of his own
works, without seeking praise from scraps of information
picked up at random from the reports of others, declares
candidly, that he believes this animal to be as yet anonyme,
that is, not to have a name, and in this, as in other respects,
to be perfectly unknown. If those that have written concerning
it had stopt here likewise, perhaps the loss the public
would have suffered by wanting their observations would
not have been accounted a great detriment to natural history.

Mr Pennant
56
, from Mr Branderâs calling it a fox,
has taken occasion to declare that his genus is a dog. Mr
Sparman, that he may contribute his mite, attacks the description
which I gave of this animal in a conversation with

132

the Count de Buffon at Paris. He declares I am mistaken
by saying that it lives on trees
57
; for in consequence, I suppose,
of its being a fox, he says it burrows in the ground,
which, I doubt very much, he never saw an African fox
do. His reason for this is, that there is a small animal
which lives in the sands at Camdebo, near the Cape of Good
Hope, which is rose-coloured, and he believes it to be the
animal in question, for he once hunted it till it escaped by
burrowing under ground, but he did not remark or distinguish
his ears
58
.

I do really believe there may be many small animals
found at Camdebo, as well as in all the other sands of Africa;
but having seen the rest of this creature during the whole
time of a chace, without remarking his ears, which are his
great characteristic, is a proof that Dr Sparman is either
mistaken in the beast itself, or else that he is an unfortunate
and inaccurate observer. There is but one other
animal that has ears more conspicuous or disproportioned
than this we are now speaking of. I need not name him to a
man of the professorâs learning. The Doctor goes on in a
further description of this animal that he had never seen.
He says his name is Zerda, which I suppose is the Swedish
translation of the Arabic word Jerd, or Jerda. But here Dr
Sparman has been again unlucky in his choice, for, besides
many other differences, the Jerd, which is an animal well
known both in Africa and Arabia, has no tail, but this perhaps
is but another instance of the Doctorâs ill fortune; in

the first case, he overlooked this animalâs ears; in the second,
he did not perceive that he had a tail.

The Arabs who conquered Egypt, and very soon after
the rest of Africa, the tyranny and fanatical ignorance of
the Khalifat of Omar being overpast, became all at once
excellent observers. They addicted themselves with wonderful
application to all sorts of science; they became very
skilful physicians, astronomers, and mathematicians; they
applied in a particular manner, and with great success, to
natural history, and being much better acquainted with
their country than we are, they were, in an especial manner,
curious in the accounts of its productions. They paid
great attention in particular to the animals whose figures
and parts are described in the many books they have left
us, as also their properties, manners, their uses in medicine
and commerce, are let down as distinctly and plainly as
words alone could do. Their religion forbade them the use
of drawing; this is the source of the confusion that has happened,
and this is the only advantage we have over them.

I believe there are very few remarkable animals, either
in Africa or Arabia, that are not still to be found described in
some Arabian author, and it is doing the public little service,
when, from vanity, we substitute crude imaginations of
our own in place of the observations of men, who were natives
of the country, in perpetual use of seeing, as living with
the animals which they described. There cannot, I think,
be a stronger instance of this, than in the subject now before
us; notwithstanding what has been as confidently as
ignorantly asserted, I will venture to affirm, that this animal,
so far from being
unknown
, is particularly described in all

134

the Arabian books; neither is he without a name; he has
one by which he invariably passes in every part of Africa,
where he exists, which in all probability he has enjoyed as
long as the lion or the tiger have theirs. He is white, and
not rose-coloured
59
; he does not burrow in the earth, but
lives upon trees; he is not the jerda, but has a tail, and his
genus is not a dog, for he is no fox. Here is a troop of errors
on one subject, that would give any man a surfeit of
modern description, all arising from conceit, the
cacoethes scribendi
,
too great love of writing, without having been at the
pains to gain a sufficient knowledge of the subject by fair
inquiry and a very little reading.

The name of this quadruped all over Africa is El Fennec;
such was the name of that I first saw at Algiers; such it is
called in the many Arabian books that have described it.
But this name, having no obvious signification in Arabic, its
derivation has given rise to many ill-founded guesses, and
laid it open to the conjectures of grammarians who were
not naturalists. Gollius says, it is a weasel, and so say all
the Arabians. He calls it
mustela fÃ¦naria
, the hay weasel,
from fÅnum, hay, that being the materials of which he
builds his nest. But this derivation cannot be admitted, for
there is no such thing known as hay in the country where
the Fennec resides. But supposing that the dry grass in all
countries may be called hay, still fÅnum, a Latin word,
would not be that which would express it in Africa. But
when we consider that long before, and ever after Alexanderâs
conquest, down as low as the tenth century, the language

135

of these countries behind Egypt was chiefly Greek,
an etymology much more natural and characteristic will
present itself in the word ÏÎ¿Î¹Î½Î¹Î¾, a palm tree, whence comes
phÅnicus, adjective, of or belonging to the palm or date-tree.

Gabriel Sionita
60
says, the Fennec is a white weasel
that lives in Sylvis Nigrorum, that is, in the woods of the
Melano-GÃ¦tuli, where indeed no other tree grows but the
palm-tree, and this just lands us in the place from which
the Fennec was brought to me at Algiers, in Biscara, Beni-Mezzab,
and Werglah. It will be observed, that he does
not say it is an animal of Nigritia; for that country
being within the tropical rains, many other trees grow
besides the palm, and there the date does not ripen;
and by its very thin hair, and fine skin, this creature is
known at first sight to belong to a dry, warm climate. But
to leave no sort of doubt, he calls him GÃ¦tulicus, which
shews precisely what country he means. There, in the
high palm-trees, of which this country is full, he writes,
the Fennec builds its nest, and brings up its young. Giggeius
tells us, that their skins are made use of for fine pelisses;
Ibn Beitar, that quantities of this fur is brought from
the interior parts of Africa, and Damir and Razi say, that
their skins are used for summer pelisses
61
.

After leaving Algiers I met with another Fennec at Tunis;

136

it had come last from the island of Gerba
62
, and had
been brought there by the caravan of Gadems, or Fezzan.
I bought one at Sennaar, from whence it came I know not.
I kept it a considerable time in a cage, till finding it was
no longer safe for me to stay at Sennaar, I trusted it by way
of deposit in the hands of a man whom it was necessary to
deceive, with the expectation that I was to return, and only
going for a few days to the camp of Shekh Adelan. It was
known by Mahomet Towash, and several people at Sennaar,
to be frequently carried to Cairo, and to Mecca, with paroquets,
and such curiosities which are brought by the great
caravan from the Niger which traverses the dreary desert
of Selima, and takes the date villages in its way eastward.

All these animals found at separate times did exactly
resemble the first one seen at Algiers. They were all known
by the name of Fennec, and no other, and said to inhabit
the date villages, where they built their nests upon trees
perfectly conformable to what the Arabian authors, whether
naturalists or historians, had said of them.

Though his favourite food seemed to be dates or any
sweet fruit, yet I observed he was very fond of eggs: pigeons
eggs, and small birds eggs, were first brought him, which
he devoured with great avidity; but he did not seem to
know how to manage the egg of a hen, but when broke for
him, he ate it with the same voracity as the others. When
he was hungry, he would eat bread, especially with honey

137

or sugar. It was very observable that a bird, whether confined
in a cage near him, or flying across the room, engrossed
his whole attention. He followed it with his eyes where-ever
it went, nor was he at this time to be diverted by
placing biscuit before him, and it was obvious, by the great
interest he seemed to take in its motions, that he was accustomed
to watch for victories over it, either for his pleasure
or his food. He seemed very much alarmed at the
approach of a cat, and endeavoured to hide himself, but
shewed no symptom of preparing for any defence. I never
heard he had any voice; he suffered himself, not without
some difficulty, to be handled in the day when he seemed rather
inclined to sleep, but was exceedingly unquiet and
restless so soon as night came, and always endeavouring his
escape, and though he did not attempt the wire, yet with his
sharp teeth he very soon mastered the wood of any common
bird-cage.

From the snout to the anus he was about ten inches
long, his tail five inches and a quarter, near an inch on the
tip of it was black. From the point of his fore-shoulder to
the point of his fore-toe, was two inches and 7/8ths. He was
two inches and a half from his occiput to the point of his
nose, the length of his ears three inches and 3/8ths. These
were doubled, or had a plait on the bottom on the outside;
the border of his ears in the inside were thick-covered
with soft white hair, but the middle part was bare, and of
a pink or rose colour. They were about an inch and a
half broad, and the cavities within very large. It was very
difficult to measure these, for he was very impatient at having
his ears touched, and always kept them erect, unless
when terrified by a cat. The pupil of his eye was large

138

and black, surrounded by a deep blue iris. He had strong,
thick mustachoes; the tip of his nose very sharp, black, and
polished. His upper jaw reached beyond the lower, and had
four grinders on each side of the mouth. It has six fore-teeth
in each jaw. Those in the under jaw are smaller than
the upper. The canine, or cutting teeth, are long, large, and
exceedingly pointed. His legs are small, and his feet very
broad; he has four toes armed with crooked, black, sharp
claws; those on his fore-feet more crooked and sharp than
behind. All his body is nearly of a dirty white, bordering
on cream colour; the hair of his belly rather whiter, softer,
and longer than, the rest, and on it a number of paps, but
he was so impatient it was impossible to count them. He
very seldom extended or stiffened his tail, the hair of which
was harder. He had a very sly and wily appearance. But
as he is a solitary animal, and not gregarious, as he has no
particular mark of feebleness about him, no shift or particular
cunning which might occasion Solomon to qualify
him as wise; as he builds his nest upon trees, and not on
the rock, he cannot be the saphan of the scripture, as some,
both Jews and Arabians, not sufficiently attentive to the
qualities attributed to that animal, have nevertheless erroneously
imagined.

ASHKOKO.

This
curious animal is found in Ethiopia, in the
caverns of the rocks, or under the great stones in
the Mountain of the Sun, behind the queenâs palace at
Koscam. It is also frequent in the deep caverns in the
rock in many other places in Abyssinia. It does not burrow,
or make holes, as the rat and rabbit, nature having interdicted
him this practice by furnishing him with feet, the
toes of which are perfectly round, and of a soft, pulpy, tender
substance; the fleshy parts of the toes project beyond the
nails, which are rather broad than sharp, much similar to
a manâs nails ill grown, and these appear rather given him
for the defence of his soft toes, than for any active use in
digging, to which they are by no means adapted.

His hind foot is long and narrow, divided with two deep
wrinkles, or clefts, in the middle, drawn across the centre,
on each side of which the flesh rises with considerable protuberancy,
and it is terminated by three claws, the middle
one is the longest. The forefoot has four toes, three disposed

140

in the same proportion as the hind foot; the fourth, the
largest of the whole, is placed lower down on the side of
the foot, so that the top of it arrives no farther than the
bottom of the toe next to it. The sole of the foot is divided
in the centre by deep clefts, like the other, and this
cleft reaches down to the heel, which it nearly divides.
The whole of the forefoot is very thick, fleshy, and soft, and
of a deep black colour, altogether void of hair, though the
back, or upper part of it, is thick-covered like the rest of its
body, down to where the toes divide, there the hair ends,
so that these long round toes very much resemble the fingers
of a man.

In place of holes, it seems to delight in less close, or more
airy places, in the mouths of caves, or clefts in the rock, or
where one projecting, and being open before, affords a
long retreat under it, without fear that this can ever be removed
by the strength or operations of man. The Ashkoko
are gregarious, and frequently several dozens of them sit
upon the great stones at the mouth of caves, and warm
themselves in the sun, or even come out and enjoy the freshness
of the summer evening. They do not stand upright
upon their feet, but seem to steal along as in fear, their
belly being nearly close to the ground, advancing a few steps
at a time, and then pausing. They have something very
mild, feeble like, and timid in their deportment; are gentle
and easily tamed, though, when roughly handled at the
first, they bite very severely.

This animal is found plentifully on Mount Libanus. I
have seen him also among the rocks at the Pharan Promontorium,

141

or Cape Mahomet, which divides the Elanitic from
the Heroopolitic Gulf, or Gulf of Suez. In all places they
seem to be the same, if there is any difference it is in favour
of the size and fatness, which those in the Mountain
of the Sun seem to enjoy above the others. What is his
food I cannot determine with any degree of certainty.
When in my possession, he ate bread and milk, and seemed
rather to be a moderate than voracious feeder. I suppose
he lives upon grain, fruit, and roots. He seemed too timid
and backward in his own nature to feed upon living food,
or catch it by hunting.

The total length of this animal as he sits, from the point
of his nose to his anus, is 17 inches and a quarter. The
length of his snout, from the extremity of the nose to the
occiput, is 3 inches and 3/8ths. His upper jaw is longer
than his under; his nose stretches half an inch beyond his
chin. The aperture of the mouth, when he keeps it close
in profile, is a little more than an inch. The circumference
of his snout around both his jaws is 3 inches and 3/8ths;
and round his head, just above his ears, 8 inches and 5/8ths;
the circumference of his neck is 8 inches and a half, and
its length one inch and a half. He seems more willing to
turn his body altogether, than his neck alone. The circumference
of his body, measured behind his forelegs, is 9
inches and three quarters, and that of his body where greatest,
eleven inches and 3/8ths. The length of his foreleg and
toe is 3 inches and a half. The length of his hind thigh
is 3 inches and 1/8th, and the length of his hind leg to the
toe taken together, is 2 feet 2 inches. The length of the
forefoot is 1 inch and 3/8ths; the length of the middle toe
6 lines, and its breadth 6 lines also. The distance between

142

the point of the nose and the first corner of the eye is one
inch and 5/8ths; and the length of his eye, from one angle
to the other, 4 lines. The difference from the fore angle of
his eye to the root of his ear is one inch 3 lines, and the
opening of his eye 2 lines and a half. His upper lip is
covered with a pencil of strong hairs for mustachoes, the
length of which are 3 inches and 5/8ths, and those of his eye-brows
2 inches and 2/8ths.

He has no tail, and gives at first sight the idea of a rat,
rather than of any other creature. His colour is a grey
mixt with a reddish brown, perfectly like the wild or warren
rabbit. His belly is white, from the point of the lower
jaw, to where his tail would begin, if that he had one. All
over his body he has scattered hairs, strong and polished
like his mustachoes, these are for the most part two inches
and a quarter in length. His ears are round, not pointed.
He makes no noise that ever I heard, but certainly
chews the cud. To discover this, was the principal reason
of my keeping him alive; those with whom he is acquainted
he follows with great assiduity. The arrival of any living
creature, even of a bird, makes him seek for a hiding-place,
and I shut him up in a cage with a small chicken,
after omitting feeding him a whole day; the next morning
the chicken was unhurt, thoâ the Ashkoko came to me with
great signs of having suffered with hunger. I likewise made
a second experiment, by inclosing two smaller birds with
him, for the space of several weeks; neither were these
hurt, though both of them fed, without impediment, of the
meat that was thrown into his cage, and the smallest of
these a kind of tit-mouse, seemed to be advancing in a sort
of familiarity with him, though I never saw it venture to

143

perch upon him, yet it would eat frequently, and at the same
time, of the food upon which the Ashkoko was feeding;
and in this consisted chiefly the familiarity I speak of,
for the Ashkoko himself never shewed any alteration of behaviour
upon the presence of the bird, but treated it with
a kind of absolute indifference. The cage, indeed, was
large, and the birds having a perch to sit upon in the upper
part of it, they did not annoy one another.

In Amhara this animal is called Ashkoko, which I apprehend
is derived from the singularity of those long herinacious
hairs, which, like small thorns, grow about his back,
and which in Amhara are called Ashok. In Arabia and Syria
he is called Israelâs Sheep, or Gannim Israel, for what
reason I know not, unless it is chiefly from his frequenting
the rocks of Horeb and Sinai, where the children of Israel
made their forty years peregrination; perhaps this name obtains
only among the Arabians. I apprehend he is known
by that of Saphan in the Hebrew, and is the animal erroneously
called by our translators Cuniculus, the rabbit or
coney.

Many are the reasons against admitting this animal,
mentioned by scripture, to be the rabbit. We know that
this last was an animal peculiar to Spain, and therefore
could not be supposed to be either in Judea or Arabia.
They are gregarious indeed, and so far resemble each other,
as also in point of size, but in place of seeking houses in the
rocks, we know the cuniculusâ desire is constantly sand.
They have claws, indeed, or nails, with which they dig
holes or burrows, but there is nothing remarkable in them,
or their frequenting rocks, so as to be described by that circumstance;

144

neither is there any thing in the character of
the rabbit that denotes excellent wisdom, or that they supply
the want of strength by any remarkable sagacity. The
saphan then is not the rabbit, which last, unless it was
brought to him by his ships from Europe, Solomon never
saw. It was not the rabbitâs particular character to haunt
the rocks. He was by no means distinguished for feebleness,
or being any way unprovided with means of digging
for himself holes. On the contrary, he was armed with
claws, and it was his character to dig such, not in the
rocks, but in the sands. Nor was he any way distinguished
for wisdom, more than the hare, the hedge-hog, or any of
his neighbours.

Let us now apply these characters to the Ashkoko. He
is above all other animals so much attached to the rock,
that I never once saw him on the ground, or from among
large stones in the mouth of caves, where is his constant residence;
he is gregarious, and lives in families. He is in
Judea, Palestine, and Arabia, and consequently must have
been familiar to Solomon. For David describes him very
pertinently, and joins him with other animals perfectly
known to all men: âThe hills are a refuge for the wild
goats, and the rocks for the saphan, or ashkoko
63
.â And
Solomon says, âThere be four things which are little upon
the earth, but they are exceeding wise
64
:â—âThe saphannim
are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in
the rocks
65
.â Now this, I think, very obviously fixes the
Ashkoko to be the saphan, for this weakness seems to allude

145

to his feet, and how inadequate these are to dig holes
in the rock, where yet, however, he lodges. These are, as
I have already observed, perfectly round; very pulpy, or
fleshy, so liable to be excoriated or hurt, and of a soft fleshy
substance. Notwithstanding which, they build houses in
the very hardest rocks, more inaccessible than those of the
rabbit, and in which they abide in greater safety; not by exertion
of strength, for they have it not, but are truly as Solomon
says, a feeble folk, but by their own sagacity and judgment,
and are therefore justly described as wise. Lastly, what
leaves the thing without doubt is, that some of the Arabs,
particularly Damir, say, that the saphan has no tail; that
it is less than a cat, and lives in houses, that is, not houses
with men, as there are few of these in the country where
the saphan is; but that he builds houses, or nests of straw,
as Solomon has said of him, in contradistinction to the rabbit,
and rat, and those other animals, that burrow in the
ground, who cannot be said to build houses, as is expressly
said of him.

The Christians in Abyssinia do not eat the flesh of this
animal, as holding it unclean, neither do the Mahometans,
who in many respects of this kind in abstinence from wild
meat, have the same scruple as christians. The Arabs in
Arabia Petrea do eat it, and I am informed those on Mount
Libanus also. Those of this kind that I saw were very fat,
and their flesh as white as that of a chicken. Though I
killed them frequently with the gun, yet I never happened
to be alone so as to be able to eat them. They are quite
devoid of all smell and rankness, which cannot be said of
the rabbit.

146

I have no doubt that the El Akbar and the El Webro of
the Arabs, are both the same animal. The El Akbar only
means the largest of the Mus-montanus, under which they
have classed the Jerboa. The Jerd, and El Webro, as also
the Ashkoko or Akbar, answer to the character of having
no tail.

BOOTED LYNX.

This
is a very beautiful species of Lynx, and, as far as
I know, the smallest of the kind. His body from the tip
of the nose to the anus being only 22 inches. His back, neck,
and forepart of his feet are of a dirty grey. His belly is of a
dirty white, spotted with undefined marks, or stains of
red. Below his eyes, and on each side of his nose, is a reddish
brown,the back of his ears being of the same colour, but
rather darker; the inside of his ears is very thickly clothed
with fine white hair, and at the end is the pencil of hairs
distinctive of this genus. On the back of his forefeet,
he has a black streak or mark, which reaches from his heel

147

two inches up his leg. On his hinder foot he has the same,
which reaches four inches from the heel, and ends just below
the first joint, and from this circumstance I have given
him his name.

Lynx.

His tail is 13 inches long, the lower part of it, for 6 inches,
is occupied with black rings. Between these rings his tail
is nearly white, the rest much the same colour as his back.
From his nose to his occiput is 4 inches and three quarters.
From one eye to the other, measuring across his nose, is one
inch and three quarters. From the base of one ear to that of
the other, is 2 inches and 2/8ths. The aperture of the eye
three quarters of an inch, and of a yellow iris. The length
of his ear from its base to the point of the pencil of hairs
at the top of it, 4 inches and three quarters. From the sole
of his forefoot to his shoulder, as he stands, 13 inches and
three quarters. From the sole of his hind foot, to the top
of his rump, 15 inches and a quarter.

He has very much the appearance of a common cat, both
from the length of his tail, and the shape of his head, which
however is broader, and his neck thicker than that of a
domestic animal. He is an inhabitant of Ras el Feel, and,
small as he is, lives among those tyrants of the forest, the
elephant and rhinoceros. I do not mean that he has any
hunting connections with them, as the jackal with the lion,
I rather think he avails himself of what is left by the hunters
of the carcases of those huge beasts. But the chief of
all his food is the Guinea-hen, of which the thickets and
bushes of this country are full. For these he lurks chiefly
at the pools of water when they drink, and in this act of
violence I surprised him. He is said to be exceedingly

148

fierce, and to attack a man if any way pressed. At this time
he mounts easily upon the highest trees; at other times he is
content with hiding himself in bushes, but in the season of
the fly he takes to holes and caverns in the ground. I
never saw its young ones, nor did I ever hear any noise it
makes, for the shot killed him outright, but did not in the
least disfigure him; so that the reader may depend upon
this representation of him as I have given it, with all possible
truth and precision.

149

Of BIRDS.

The
number of birds in Abyssinia exceeds that of other
animals beyond proportion. The high and low countries
are equally stored with them, the first kind are the
carnivorous birds. Many species of the eagle and hawk,
many more still of the vulture kind, as it were overstock
all parts of this country. That species of glede called
Haddaya, so frequent in Egypt, comes very punctually into
Ethiopia, at the return of the sun, after the tropical rains.
The quantity of shell-fish which then covers the edges of
the desert, and leaves the salt springs where they have been
nourished, surprised by the heat, and deserted by the moisture,
are the first food these birds find in their way. They
then are supplied in the neighbouring Kolla, by the carcases
of those large beasts, the elephant, rhinoceros, and giraffa,
the whole tribe of the deer kind, and the wild asses

150

that are slain by the hunters, part of which only are used
in food.

The vast quantity of field-rats and mice that appear after
harvest, and swarm in the cracks, or fissures in the
ground, are their next supply. But above all, the great
slaughter made of cattle upon the march of the army,
the beasts of burden which die under carriage and ill treatment,
the number of men that perish by disease and by the
sword, whose carcases are never buried by this barbarous
and unclean people, compose such a quantity, and variety
of carrion, that it brings together at one time a multitude
of birds of prey, it would seem there was not such a
number in the whole earth. These follow the camp, and
abide by it; indeed, they seem another camp round it, for,
besides those that ventured among the tents, I have seen the
fields covered on every side as far as the eyes could reach,
and the branches of the trees, ready to break under the pressure
of their weight.

This unclean multitude remain together in perfect peace
till the rains become constant and heavy; which deprive
them of their food by forcing the hunters and armies to retire
home. Nor are other circumstances wanting equally
obvious, which account for the great number of birds that
live on insects. The fly, of which we have already spoken
so often, reigns in great swarms from May to September
on the plains, and in all the low country down to the sands
of Atbara. These are attended by a multitude of enemies,
some of whom seek them for food; others seem to persecute
them from hatred, or for sport, from the multitude
they scatter upon the ground, without further care concerning

151

them. Honey is the principal food of all ranks of people
in Abyssinia, and consequently a multitude of bees are
produced everywhere. Part of these are kept in large cages,
or baskets, hung upon the trees; others attach themselves
to the branches, others build nests in the soft wood
of the trees, especially the Bohabab, whose large and fragrant
flower furnishes them with a honey which it strongly
perfumes. The honey generally borrows its colour from
the flowers and herbs from whence it is gathered. At Dixan
we were surprised to see the honey red like blood, and
nothing can have an appearance more disgusting than this,
when mixed with melted butter. There are bees which
build in the earth, whose honey is nearly black, as has been
observed by the jesuit Jerome Lobo, I willingly place this
truth to his credit, the only one, I think, I can find in his
natural history, a small atonement for the multitude of
falsehoods this vain and idle romancer has told on every
occasion. Nor are the granivorous birds fewer in number
or worse provided for; all the trees and shrubs in Abyssinia
bear flowers, and consequently seeds, berries, or fruit, of
some kind or other; food for all or some particular species
of birds. Every tree and bush carries these likewise in all
stages of ripeness, in all seasons of the year.

This is, however, not to be understood as meaning that
any tree produces in the same part, fruit or flowers more
than once a-year; but the time of each partâs bearing is
very particularly distributed. The west side of every tree
is the first that blossoms, there its fruit proceeds in all
stages of ripeness till it falls to the ground. It is succeeded
by the south, which undergoes the same process. From
this it crosses the tree, and the north is next in fruit; last

152

of all comes the east, which produces flowers and fruit
till the beginning of the rainy season. In the end of April
new leaves push off the old ones without leaving the tree
at any time bare, so that every tree in Abyssinia appears to
be an evergreen. The last I saw in flower was the coffee-tree
at Emfras the 20th of April 1770: from this time till
the rains begin, and all the season of them, the trees get
fully into leaf, and the harvest, which is generally in these
months throughout Abyssinia, supplies the deficiency of
the seed upon bushes and trees. All the leaves of the trees
in Abyssinia are very highly varnished, and of a tough leather
like texture, which enables them to support the constant
and violent rains under which they are produced.

This provision made for granivorous birds, in itself so
ample, is doubled by another extraordinary regulation.
The country being divided by a ridge of mountains, a line
drawn along the top of these divides the seasons likewise;
so that those birds to whom any one food is necessary become
birds of passage, and, by a short migration, find the same
seasons, and the same food, on the one side, which the rains
and change of weather had deprived them of on the other.

There is no great plenty of water-fowl in Abyssinia,
especially of the web-footed kind. I never remember
to have seen one of these that are not common in most
parts of Europe. Vast variety of storks cover the plains
in May, when the rains become constant. The large indigenous
birds that reside constantly on the high mountains
of Samen and Taranta, have most of them an extraordinary
provision made against the wet and the weather; each feather
is a tube, from the pores of which issue a very fine dust

153

or powder, in such abundance as to stain the hand upon
grasping them. This I shall presently mention in the description
of one of these birds, the golden eagle of Lamalmon.
In looking at this dust through a very strong magnifying
power, I thought I discerned it to be in form of a
number of fine feathers.

Though all the deep and grassy bogs have snipes in them,
I never once saw a woodcock: swallows there are of many
kinds, unknown in Europe; those that are common in
Europe appear in passage at the very season when they take
their flight from thence. We saw the greatest part of them
in the island of Masuah where they lighted and tarried two
days, and then proceeded with moon-light nights to the south-west.
But I once saw in the country of the Baharnagash,
in the province of TigrÃ©, the blue forked-tailed swallow,
which builds in the windows in England, making his nest
out of season, when he should have been upon his migration;
this I have already taken notice of in my journey
from Masuah to Gondar.

There are few owls in Abyssinia; but those are of an
immense size and beauty. The crow is marked white and
black nearly in equal portions. There is one kind of raven;
he, too, of a large size, his feathers black intermixed
with brown; his beak tipt with white, and a figure like a
cup or chalice of white feathers on his occiput, or hinder
part of his head. I never saw either sparrow, magpie, or
bat in Abyssinia. Pigeons are there in great numbers, and
of many varieties; some of them very excellent for eating. I
shall hereafter describe one of them whose name is Waalia.
All the pigeons but one sort are birds of passage, that one lives

154

in the eaves of houses or holes in the walls, and this is not
eaten, but accounted unclean for a very whimsical reason;
they say it has claws like a falcon, and is a mixture from
that bird. The same sort of imagination is that of
the Turks, who say, that the Turkey, from the tuft of
black hair that is upon his breast, partakes of the nature of
the hog. This pigeonâs feet are indeed large, but very different
in formation from that of the falcon.

There are no geese in Abyssinia, wild or tame, excepting
what is called the Golden Goose, Goose of the Nile, or Goose
of the Cape, common in all the South of Africa: these
build their nests upon trees, and when not in water, generally
sit upon them.

I have already spoken of fishes, and have entered very
sparingly into their history. These, and other marine productions
of the Arabian Gulf, or even the small share that I
have painted and collected, would occupy many large volumes
to exhibit and describe, and would cost, in the engraving,
a much larger sum than I have any prospect of ever
being able to afford.

NISSER, or GOLDEN EAGLE.

I have
ventured from his colour to call this bird the
Golden Eagle, by way of distinction, as its Ethiopic
name, Nisser, is only a generic one, and imports no more
than the English name, Eagle. He is called by the vulgar
Abou Duchân, or Father Long Beard, which we may imagine
was given him from the tuft of hair he has below his
beak.

I suppose him to be not only the largest of the eagle kind,
but surely one of the largest birds that flies. From wing
to wing he was 8 feet 4 inches. From the tip of his tail to
the point of his beak when dead, 4 feet 7 inches. He weighed
22 pounds, was very full of flesh. He seemed remarkably
short in the legs, being only four inches from the
joining of the foot to where the leg joins the thigh, and
from the joint of the thigh to the joining of his body 6

156

inches. The thickness of his thigh was little less than 4
inches; it was extremely muscular, and covered with
flesh. His middle claw was about 2 inches and a half long,
not very sharp at the point, but extremely strong. From
the root of the bill, to the point, was 3 inches and a quarter,
and one inch and three quarters in breadth at the root. A
forked brush of strong hair, divided at the point into two,
proceeded from the cavity of his lower jaw at the beginning
of his throat. He had the smallest eye I ever remember to
have seen in a large bird, the aperture being scarcely half
an inch. The crown of his head was bare or bald, so was
the front where the bill and scull joined.

This noble bird was not an object of any chace or pursuit,
nor stood in need of any stratagem to bring him within
our reach. Upon the highest top of the mountain Lamalmon,
while my servants were refreshing themselves
from that toilsome rugged ascent, and enjoying the pleasure
of a most delightful climate, eating their dinner in
the outer air with several large dishes of boiled goats
flesh before them, this enemy, as he turned out to be to
them, appeared suddenly; he did not stoop rapidly from a
height, but came flying slowly along the ground, and sat
down close to the meat within the ring the men had made
round it. A great shout, or rather cry of distress, called me
to the place. I saw the eagle stand for a minute as if to recollect
himself, while the servants ran for their lances and
shields. I walked up as nearly to him as I had time to do.
His attention was fully fixed upon the flesh. I saw him
put his foot into the pan where was a large piece in water
prepared for boiling, but finding the smart which he had

157

not expected, he withdrew it, and forsook the piece which
he held.

There were two large pieces, a leg and a shoulder, lying
upon a wooden platter, into these he trussed both his claws,
and carried them off, but I thought he looked wistfully at
the large piece which remained in the warm water. Away
he went slowly along the ground as he had come. The
face of the cliff over which criminals are thrown took him
from our sight. The Mahometans that drove the asses, who
had, as we have already observed in the course of the journey,
suffered from the hyÃ¦na, were much alarmed, and assured
me of his return. My servants, on the other hand,
very unwillingly expected him, and thought he had already
more than his share.

As I had myself a desire of more intimate acquaintance
with him, I loaded a rifle-gun with ball, and sat down close
to the platter by the meat. It was not many minutes before
he came, and a prodigious shout was raised by my attendants,
He is coming, he is coming, enough to have discouraged
a less courageous animal. Whether he was not quite so
hungry as at the first visit, or suspected something from my
appearance, I know not, but he made a small turn, and sat
down about ten yards from me, the pan with the meat being
between me and him. As the field was clear before me, and
I did not know but his next move might bring him opposite
to some of my people, and so that he might actually get the
rest of the meat and make off, I shot him with the ball
through the middle of his body about two inches below the
wing, so that he lay down upon the grass without a single
flutter. Upon laying hold of his monstrous carcase, I was

158

not a little surprised at seeing my hands covered and tinged
with yellow powder or dust. Upon turning him upon his
belly, and examining the feathers of his back, they produced
a brown dust, the colour of the feathers there. This dust
was not in small quantities, for, upon striking his breast, the
yellow powder flew in fully greater quantity than from a
hair-dresserâs powderpuff. The feathers of the belly and breast,
which were of a gold colour, did not appear to have any thing
extraordinary in their formation, but the large feathers in the
shoulder and wings seemed apparently to be fine tubes, which
upon pressure scattered this dust upon the finer part of the feather, but
this was brown, the colour of the feathers of the back.
Upon the side of the wing, the ribs, or hard part of the feather,
seemed to be bare as if worn, or, I rather think, were
renewing themselves, having before failed in their function.

What is the reason of this extraordinary provision of nature
is not in my power to determine. As it is an unusual
one, it is probably meant for a defence against the climate
in favour of those birds which live in those almost inaccessible
heights of a country, doomed, even in its lower parts,
to several months of excessive rain. The pigeons we saw
upon Lamalmon, had not this dust in their feathers, nor
had the quails; from which I guess these to be strangers, or
birds of passage, that had no need of this provision, created
for the wants of the indigenous, such as this eagle is, for
he is unknown in the low country. That same day I shot
a heron, in nothing different from ours, only that he was
smaller, who had upon his breast and back a blue powder,
in full as great quantity as that of the eagle.

BLACK EAGLE.

This
beautiful bird was the first subject that suffered
the loss of liberty, after the king and whole army
had vindicated theirs, had passed the Nile in circumstances
scarcely within the bounds of credibility, had escaped all
the deep-laid schemes of Fasil, and by a train of accidents
almost miraculous, passed triumphantly on before him after
the battle of Limjour, having joined Kefla Yasous,
advanced and encamped at Dingleber the 28th of May
1770.

This bird, who from the nobleness of his kind was appositely
enough thought to be a type of the king, fell by
a fate, in which he still more resembled him, overpowered
by the strength and number of a species of birds in character
infinitely below him. It has been repeatedly observed
in the course of my narrative, that an inconceivable

160

number of birds and beasts of prey, especially the former,
follow an Abyssinian army pace by pace, from the first
day of its march till its return, increasing always in prodigious
proportion the more it advances into the country.
An army there leaves nothing living behind, not the
vestige of habitation, but the fire and the sword reduces
everything to a wilderness and solitude.

The beasts and birds unmolested have the country to
themselves, and increase beyond all possible conception.
The slovenly manner of this savage people, who after a
battle neither bury friends nor enemies, the quantity of
beasts of burden that die perpetually under the load of
baggage, and variety of mismanagement, the quantity of
offal and half-eaten carcases of cows, goats, and sheep,
which they consume in their march for their sustenance, all
furnish a flock of carrion sufficient to occasion contagious
distempers, were there not such a prodigious number of
voracious attendants, who consume them almost before putrefaction.
In their voracious stomachs lies the grave of
the bravest soldier, unless very high birth or office, or very
extraordinary affection in their attendants, procure them a
more decent, though more uncommon fate, a sepulchre
in a neighbouring church-yard. There is no giving the
reader any idea of their number, unless by comparing them
to the sand of the sea. While the army is in motion they
are a black canopy, which extend over it for leagues. When
encamped, the ground is discoloured with them beyond the
sight of the eye, all the trees are loaded with them. I need
not say that these are all carrion birds, such as the vulture,
kite, and raven, that is a species to which nature has refused

161

both the inclination and the power of feeding upon living
subjects.

By what accident this small eagle, who was not a carrion
bird, came among these cowardly and unclean feeders,
is more than I can say; but it met the fate very common
to those who assort with bad company, and those of sentiments
and manners inferior to their own. One of these,
a kite, vulture, or raven, I know not which, struck the
poor eagle down to the ground just before the door of the
kingâs tent, and hurt him so violently, that he had scarcely
strength to flutter under the canopy where the king was
sitting; pages and officers of the bed-chamber soon seized
him. It was not long before they made the application that
the king was to be dethroned by a subject, and Fasil was
in everybodyâs mouth. The omen was of the kind too unpleasant
to be dwelt upon; the sensible people of the attendants
hurried it away, and it of course came to me with
all the circumstances of the accident, the moral of that tale,
and twenty prophecies that were current to confirm it. I
confess my own weakness; at first it made a strong impression
upon me. In the moment the passage of Shakespeare
came into my mind,

———âOn Tuesday last,

âA falcon towâring in his pride of place,

âWas by a mousing owl hawkâd at and killâd.â

And this recollection occupied my mind so forcibly, that I
stood for a moment speechless, and as it were rivetted to the
ground. This behaviour, unusual in me, who used always

162

to laugh at their presages, and prophecies, was observed by
the page that brought me the bird, and was reported to
the king; and though he did not speak of it that time, yet
some days after, when I was taking my leave of him on
his retreat from Gondar to TigrÃ©, he mentioned it to me:
said we were mistaken, for the omen referred to Powussenâ
of Begemder, and not to Waragna Fasil.

After sketching his genteel and noble manner while
alive, our unfortunate prisoner found his death by the
needle, was put out of sight, and carried to Gondar, where
the drawing was finished. He was altogether of a dark
brown, or chesnut, leading to black. The whole length,
from the extremity of the tail to the nose, was two feet
four inches. The breadth, from wing to wing, four feet
six inches. He was very lean, and weighed something less
than five pounds. The fourth feather of his wing after the
three largest, was white. The feathers of the lower side of
his tail were of a bluish brown, checkered with white, and
those of the upper side of the tail were black and white
alternately. His thighs were thick-covered with feathers,
and so were his legs, down to the joining of the foot. His
feet were yellow, with strong black claws. The inside of
his wings was white, with a mixture of brown. His leg, from
the joining of the foot, was three inches. His beak, from
the point to where the feathers reached, was two inches and
a quarter. The length of his crest from the head to the
longest feather, five inches. The eye was black, with a cast
of fire colour in it, the iris yellow, and the whole eye exceedingly
beautiful. He seemed wonderfully tame, or
rather sluggish, but whether that was from his nature or

163

misfortune I cannot be a judge, never having seen another.

Rachamah

RACHAMAH.

This
bird is met with in some places in the south of
Syria and in Barbary, but is no where so frequent as in
Egypt and about Cairo. It is called, by the Europeans, Poule
de Faraone, the hen or bird of Pharaoh. It is a vulture of
the lesser kind, not being much larger than our rook or
crow, though, by the length of its wings, and the erect manner
in which it carries its head, it appears considerably
larger. In Egypt and all over Barbary it is called Rachamah,
and yet it has been very much doubted what bird this was,
as well as what was the origin of that name. Some of the
Arabs will have it derived from Archam, which signifies
variegated, or of different colours. It has been answered,
that this is not the derivation, as archam in Arabic signifies
variegated, or of more colours than two or three blended

164

together, whereas this is in its feathers only black and white,
separate from one another, and cannot be called variegated.
But I must here observe, that this is by no means a proper
interpretation of the Arabic word. Among many examples
I could give, I shall adduce but one. There is a particular
kind of sheep in Arabia Felix, whose head and part of the
neck are black, and the rest of the beast white; it is chiefly
found between Mocha and the Straits of Babelmandeb. This
in Arabic is called Rachama, for no other reason but because
it is marked black and white, which are precisely the two
colours which distinguish the bird before us.

But I still am induced to believe the origin of this birdâs
name has an older and more classical derivation than that
which we have just spoken of. We know from Horus Apollo,
in his book upon Hieroglyphics, that the Rachma, or she-vulture,
was sacred to Isis, and that its feathers adorned the
statue of that goddess. He says it was the emblem of parental
affection, and that the Egyptians, about to write an
affectionate mother, painted a she-vulture. He says further,
that this female vulture, having hatched its young
ones, continues with them one hundred and twenty days,
providing them with all necessaries; and, when the stock
of food fails them, she tears off the fleshy part of her
thigh, and feeds them with that and the blood which
flows from the wound. Rachama, then, is good Hebrew,
it is from Rechem, female love, or attachment, from an
origin which it cannot have in men. In this sense we
see it used with great propriety in the first book of Kings
66
,

165

in Isaiah
67
, and in Lamentations
68
, and it seems particularly
to mean what the Egyptians made it a hieroglyphic of in
very ancient ages, and before the time of Moses, maternal
affection towards their progeny. No mention is here made
of the male Rachama, nor was he celebrated for any particular
quality.

From this silence, or negative personage in him, arose a
fable that there was no male in this species. Horus Apollo
69
,
after naming this bird always in the feminine gender, tells
us roundly, that there is no male of the kind, but that the
female conceives from the south wind. Plutarch
70
, Ammianus
71
,
and all the Greeks, say the same thing; and
Tzetzes
72
, after having repeated the same story at large,
tells us that he took it all from the Egyptians, so there
seems to be little doubt either of the origin or meaning
of the name.

The fathers in the first ages, after the death of Christ, seem
to have been wonderfully pressed in point of argument before
they could have recourse to a fable like this to vindicate
the possibility of the Virgin Maryâs conception without
human means. Tertullian
73
, Orgines
74
, Bazil
75
, and Ambrosius
76
,
are all wild enough to found upon this ridiculous
argument, and little was wanting for some of these

166

learned ones to land this fable upon Moses, who probably
knew it as a vulgar error before his time, but was very far
from paying any regard to it; on the contrary, it is with
the utmost propriety and precision, that, speaking to the
people, he calls it Rachama in the feminine, because he
was then giving them a list of birds forbidden to be ate
77
,
among which he selected the female vulture, as that was
best known, and the great object of idolatry and superstition;
and the male, and all the lesser abominations of that
species, he included together in the word that followed
his

kind; though the English translator, by calling the female
vulture
him
, has introduced an impropriety that there was
not the least foundation for. That Moses was not the author
of or believer in this Egyptian fable, is plain from a
verse in Exodus, where, at another time, he speaks of this
bird, as a male, and calls him Racham, and not Rachama.

It will not be improper that I here take notice, that the
English translator, by his ignorance of language, has lost all
the beauty and even the sense of the Hebrew original. He
makes God say, âYe have seen what I did unto the Egyptians,
and how I bore you on eagles wings, and brought you unto
myself
78
â. Now, if the expression had been really Eagle, the
word would have been Nisr, and would have signified nothing;
but, in place of eagle, God says Vulture, the emblem of
maternal affection and maternal tenderness towards his children,
which has a particular connection with, âbrought you
unto myself;â so that the passage will run thus, Say to the

167

children of Israel, See how I have punished the Egyptians,
while I bore you up on the wings of the Rachama,
that is, of parental tenderness and affection, and brought
you home to myself. It is our part to be thankful that the
truths of Holy Scripture are preserved to us entire, but
still it is a rational regret that great part of the beauty of
the original is lost.

Notwithstanding all that has been said, this bird has been
mistaken nearly by all the interpreters Hebrews, Syrians, and
Samaritans; the Greeks, from imaginations of their own,
have thought it to be the pelican, the stork, the swan, and
the merops. Bochart, after a variety of guesses, acknowledges
his own ignorance, and excuses it by laying equal
blame upon others. Hitherto, says he, we have not been
able to condescend upon what bird this was, because those
that have wrote concerning it were as ignorant in the natural
history of things as they were skilful in the interpretation
of words.

The point of the beak of this bird is black, very sharp
and strong for about three quarters of an inch, it is then
covered by a yellow, fleshy membrane, which clothes it as
it were both above and below, as likewise the forepart of
the head and throat, and ends in a sharp point before, nearly
opposite to where the neck joins the breast; this membrane
is wrinkled, and has a few hairs growing thinly scattered
upon the lower part of it. It has large, open nostrils,
and prodigious large ears, which are not covered by
any feathers whatever. The body is perfect white from
the middle of the head, where it joins the yellow membrane,
down to the tail. The large feathers of its wing

168

are black; they are six in number. The lesser feathers
are three, of an iron-grey, lighter towards the middle,
and these are covered with three others lesser still, but of the
same form, of an iron rusty colour; those feathers that cover
the large wing-feathers are at the top for about an
inch and a quarter of an iron-grey, but the bottom is pure
white. The tail is broad and thick above, and draws to a
point at the bottom. It is not composed of large feathers,
and is not half an inch longer than the point of its wings.
Its thighs are cloathed with a soft down-like feather, as far
as the joint. Its legs are of a dirty white, inclining to
flesh colour, rough, with small tubercules which are soft
and fleshy. It has three toes before and one behind; the
middle of these is considerably the longest; they are armed
with black claws, rather strong than pointed, or much
crooked. It has no voice that ever I heard, generally goes
single, and oftener sits and walks upon the ground than
upon trees. It delights in the most putrid and slinking
kind of carrion, has itself a very strong smell, and putrifies
very speedily.

It is a very great breach of order, or police, to kill any
one of these birds near Cairo. But as there are few of its
species in Egypt, and its name is the same all over Africa
and Arabia, it seems to me strange that the Arabian or Hebrew
writers should have found so much difficulty in discovering
what was the bird. It lays but two eggs, and
builds its nest in the most desert parts of the country. More
of its history or manners I do not know. The books are
full of fanciful stories concerning it, which the instructed
reader at first sight will know to be but fable.

ERKOOM.

It
would appear that this bird is part of a large tribe, the
greatest variety in which lies in his beak and horn.
The horn he wears sometimes upon the beak, and sometimes
upon the forehead above the root of the beak. These are
the only parts that appear in collections. I gave to the cabinet
of the king of France the first bird of this kind seen
entire, and I have here exhibited the first figure and description
of it that ever was seen in natural history, drawn from
the life. In the east part of Abyssinia it is called Abba
Gumba, in the language of TigrÃ©; on the western side of
the TacazzÃ¨ it is called Erkoom; the first of its names is
apparently from the groaning noise it makes, the second
has no signification in any language that I know.

At Ras el Feel, in my return through Sennaar, I made
this drawing from a very entire bird, but slightly wounded;

170

it was in that country called Teir el Naciba, the bird
of destiny. This bird, or the kind of it, is by naturalists
called the Indian crow, or raven; for what reason it is thus
classed is more than I can tell. The reader will see, when I
describe his particular parts, whether they agree with those
of the raven or not. There is one characteristic of the raven
which he certainly has, he walks, and does not hop
or jump in the manner that many others of that kind do;
but then he, at times, runs with very great velocity, and,
in running, very much resembles the turkey, or bustard,
when his head is turned from you.

The colour of the eye of this bird is of a dark brown,
or rather reddish cast; but darker still as it approaches the
pupil; he has very large eye-lashes, both upper and lower,
but especially his upper. From the point of the beak
to the extremity of the tail is 3 feet 10 inches; the breadth
from one point of the wing to the other extended, is 6 feet,
and the length 22 inches. The length of the neck 10
inches, and its thickness 3 inches and a half; the length
of the beak measuring the opening near the head straight
to the point, 10 inches; and from the point of the beak
to the root of the horn 7 inches and 3/8ths. The whole
length of the horn is 3 inches and a half. The length
of the horn from the foot to the extremity where it joins
the beak, is 4 inches. The thickness of the beak in
front of the opening is one inch and 7/8ths. The thickness
of the horn in front is one inch and 5/8ths. The horn in
height, taken from the upper part of the point to the beak,
2 inches. The length of the thighs 7 inches, and that of
the legs 6 inches and 5/8ths. The thickness in profile 7 lines,
and in front 4 lines and a half. It has three toes before
and one behind, but they are not very strong, nor seemingly

171

made to tear up carcases. The length of the foot
to the hinder toe is one inch 6 lines, the innermost is one
inch 7 lines, the middle 2 inches 2 lines, and the last outer
one 2 inches one line.

This bird is all of a black, or rather black mixed with
soot-colour; the large feathers of the wing are ten in number,
milk-white both without and within. The tip of his wings
reaches very nearly to his tail; his beak and head measured
together are 11 inches and a half, and his head 3 inches
and a quarter. At his neck he has those protuberances
like the Turkey-cock, which are light-blue, but turn red
upon his being chased, or in the time the hen is laying.

I have seen the Erkoom with eighteen young ones; it
runs upon the ground much more willingly than it flies,
but when it is raised, flies both strong and far. It has a
rank smell, and is said to live in Abyssinia upon dead carcases.
I never saw it approach any of these; and what convinces
me this is untrue, is, that I never saw one of them
follow the army, where there was always a general assembly
of all the birds of prey in Abyssinia.

It was very easy to see what was its food, by its place of
rendezvous, which was in the fields of teff, upon the tops
of which are always a number of green beetles, these he
strips off by drawing the stalk through his beak, and which
operation wears his beak so that it appears to be serrated,
and, often as I had occasion to open this bird, I never found
in him any thing but the green scarabeus, or beetle. He
has a putrid or stinking smell, which I suppose is the reason
he has been imagined to feed upon carrion.

172

The Erkoom builds in large, thick trees, always, if he
can, near churches; has a covered nest like that of a magpie,
but four times as large as the eagleâs. It places its nest
firm upon the trunk, without endeavouring to make it
high from the ground; the entry is always on the east side.
It would seem that the Indian crow of Bontius is of this
kind: it is difficult, however, of belief, that his natural
food is nutmegs; for there seems nothing in his structure
or inclination, which is walking on the ground, that is necessary
or convenient for taking such food.

ABOU HANNES.

The
ancient and true name of this bird seems to be lost.
The present one is fancifully given from observation of
a circumstance of its Åconomy; translated, it signifies, Father
John, and the reason is, that it appears on St Johnâs day,
the precise time when first the fresh water of the tropical
rains is known in Egypt to have mixed with the Nile, and to

173

have made it lighter, sweeter, and more exhaleable in dew,
that is in the beginning of the season of the tropical rains,
when all water-fowl, that are birds of passage, resort to Ethiopia
in great numbers.

Abou Hannes.

st
1789. by G. Robinson & Co.

As I have observed this bird has lost its name, so in the
history of Egypt and Ethiopia we have lost a bird, once very
remarkable, of which now nothing remains but the name,
this is the Ibis, to which divine honours were paid, whose
bodies were embalmed and preserved with the same care as
those of men. There still remain many repositories full of
them in Egypt, and appear everywhere in collections in
the hands of the curious. Though the manner that these
birds are prepared, and caustic ingredients, with which the
body is injected, have greatly altered the consistency of their
parts, and the colour of their plumage, yet it is from these,
viewed and compared deliberately, and at leisure, that I
am convinced the Abou Hannes is neither more nor less
than the Ibis.

Several authors, treating of this bird, have involved it in
more than Egyptian darkness. They have first said it was
a stork, then the hÃ¦matopus, or red-legged heron; they then
say its colour is of a fine shining black, its beak and legs of
a deep red. Some have said it was from it that men learned
the way to administer clysters, others, that it conceived
at the beak, and even laid eggs that way, and that its flesh
is sweet and red like that of a salmon. Ail these and many
more are fables. We know from Plutarch, that in the
plumage, it is black and white like the pelargus. And the
mummy pits, by furnishing part of the bird itself, confirm
us in the opinion.

174

The Abou Hannes has a beak shaped like that of a curlew,
two-thirds of which is straight, and the remaining
third crooked; the upper part of a green, horny substance,
and the lower black. From the occiput to where it joins
the beak is four inches and a half. Its leg, from the lower
joint of the thigh to the foot, is six inches, the bone round
and strong, according to the remark of Cicero, and from
the lower joint of the thigh, to where it joins the body, is
five inches and a half. The height of the body as it stands,
from the sole of its foot to the middle of the back, is nineteen
inches. The aperture of the eye is one inch. Its feet
and legs are black; has three toes before, armed with sharp,
straight claws: it has a toe also behind. Its head is brown,
and the same colour reaches down to the back, or where
the back joins with the neck. Its throat is white, so are
its breast, back, and thighs. The largest feathers of its
wings are a deep black for thirteen inches from the tail,
and from the extremity of the tail, six inches up the back
is black likewise.

Now the measures of the beak, the tibia, the thigh-bone,
and the scull, compared with the most perfect of the embalmed
birds taken from the mummy pits, do agree in every
thing as exactly as can be expected. The length of the beak
in my drawing seems to exceed that of the embalmed bird,
but I will not be positive; this small error is not in the design,
though the white feathers are scorched in the embalmed
birds, yet there is no difficulty in perceiving the
colour distinctly; there is less in distinguishing the black
upon the wings and above its rump. The measure of both
so exactly agree that they can scarcely be mistaken.

The reason, we are told, why this bird was held in such
veneration in Egypt, was the great enmity it had to serpents,
and the use of freeing the country from them; but
for my own part, I must confess, that as I know, for certain,
there are no quantity of serpents in Egypt, as the reason of
things is that they should be few, so I can never make
myself believe they ever were in such abundance, as to need
any particular agent to distinguish itself by destroying them.
Egypt Proper, that is the cultivated and inhabited part of it,
is overflowed for five months every year by the Nile, and it
is impossible vipers can abound where there is such long and
regular refrigerations. The viper casts his skin in May, and
is immediately after in his renewed youth and fulness of
vigour. All this time he would be doomed in Egypt to live
under water, or hid in some hole, and this is the time when
the Ibis is in Egypt, so that the end of his coming would be
frustrated by the absence of his enemy. The vipers have
their abode in the sandy desert of Libya, where even dew
does not fall, where the sand is continually in motion, parched
with hot winds, and glowing with the scorching rays of
the sun. There the Ibis could not live ; the country is not
inhabited by man, and consequently vipers there would be
no nuisance. Nay, we know these vipers of Libya are
an article of commerce in Egypt. The Theriac is composed
of them at Venice and at Rome, and they are dispersed
for the uses of medicine throughout the different parts of
the world.

Now, in this light, the Ibis could not live among them,
nor would he be of benefit even if he could; but as we
have it from a number of credible historians that the Ibis
was plentiful in Egypt, that vipers, at least, in some part of

176

it, were so frequent as to be a nuisance, and that we know
as surely two other things, that neither the vipers are a
nuisance, nor is the Ibis in Egypt at this day, we must look
for some change in the Åconomy of the country which can
account for this.

We know in a manner not to doubt, that in ancient times
Egypt was inhabited, and extended to the edges of the Libyan
Desert; nay, in some places, considerably into it; large
lakes were dug in this country by their first kings, and these,
filled in the time of the Nileâs inundation, continued immense
reservoirs, which were let out by degrees to water
the plantations and pleasure-ground that had been created
by man, in what was formerly a desert. Nothing in fact
was wanting but water, and these large lakes supplied this
want abundantly, by furnishing water of the purest and
most perfect kind: in the neighbourhood of these artificial
plantations, there can be no doubt the viper must be a
nuisance. Being indigenous in this his domicil, it is not
probable he would quit it easily, and any deficiency of them
in number would not have failed to be supplied from the
deserts in the neighbourhood. The prodigious pools of
stagnant water would bring the Ibis thither, and place him
near his enemy, and after man had once discerned his use,
gratitude would soon lead him to reward him.

But after, when these immense lakes, and the conduits
leading to them, were neglected, and the works ruined
which conducted these artificial inundations, and covered
the deserts of Libya with verdure; when war and tyranny,
and every sort of bad government, made people fly from
the country, or live precariously and insecure in it, all this

177

temporary paradise vanished: the land was overflowed no
more; the sands of the desert resumed their ancient station;
there were no inhabitants in the country, no pools of water
for the Ibis, nor was the viper a nuisance. The Ibis retired
to his native country Ethiopia, in the lower part of which,
that is, in a hot country full of pools of stagnant water,
he remains, and there I found him.

It is probable in Egypt he had increased greatly by the
quantity of food and good entertainment he had. Upon these
failing, he probably died and wore out of Egypt; and in
the proportion in which he was at first created, which seems
to have been a slender one, he remained in his native Ethiopia,
for his emigration and increase in Egypt was merely
accidental. This, I apprehend, is the true cause why the Ibis
is now no longer known in Egypt; but I am satisfied
to restore him to natural history, with at least a probable
conjecture, why he is now unknown in those very regions
where once he was worshipped as a god. His figure appears
frequently upon the obelisks among the hieroglyphics,
and further confirms my conjecture that this is the bird.

The Count de Buffon has published the bird, which he
calls the white
79
Ibis of Egypt, the half of his head crimson,
with a strong beak of a gold colour, liker to that of a
toucan, and long, purple, weak legs, and a thick neck; in
short, having none of the characters of the bird it is intended
to represent.

178

The reader may be assured there is no such Ibis in Egypt;
none ever appeared from the catacombs but what were
black and white, as historians have described
80
, so that this
is so disguised by the drawing and colouring as not to be
known, or else it came from some other country than
Egypt.

MOROC.

I have
already said in the introduction which immediately
precedes the history of birds, that among those
that live upon insects there are some that attach themselves
to flies in general, and others that seem to live upon
bees alone: Of this last sort is the bird now before us. I
never saw him in the low country where the fly is, nor indeed
anywhere but in the countries where honey is chiefly
produced as revenue, such as the country of the Agow,
Goutto, and in Belessen.

Bee Cuckoo

He seems to pursue the bees for vengeance or diversion
as well as for food, as he leaves a quantity of them scattered
dead upon the ground without seeking further after
them, and this pastime he unweariedly pursues without interruption
all the day long; for the Abyssinians do not look
so near, or consider things so much in detail, as to imagine
all the waste which he commits can make any difference
in their revenue.

His name is Maroc, or Moroc, I suppose from Mar, honey,
though I never heard he was further concerned in
the honey than destroying the bees. In shape and size he
seems to be a cuckoo, but differs from him in other respects.
He is drawn here of his natural size, and in all respects so
minutely attended to, that I scarcely believe there is a feather
amissing.

The opening of his mouth is very wide when forced
open, reaching nearly to under his eyes. The inside of his
mouth and throat are yellow, his tongue sharp-pointed. It
can be drawn to almost half its length out of its mouth
beyond the point of its beak, and is very flexible. Its head
and neck are brown, without mixture. It has a number of
exceeding small hairs, scarcely visible at the root of his beak.
His eye-brows are black likewise. His beak is pointed, and
very little crooked; the pupil of his eye is black, surrounded
with an iris of a dusky dull red. The fore part of his
neck is light-yellow, darker on each side than in the middle,
where it is partly white; the yellow on each side reaches
near the shoulder, or round part of the wing; from this
his whole bread and belly is of a dirty white to under the
tail; from this, too, his feathers begin to be tipt gently with

180

white, as are all those that cover the outside of his wing;
but the white here is clear, and the size increases with the
breadth and length of the feathers. The large feathers of
his wing are eight in number, the second in size are six. The
tail consists of twelve feathers; the longest three are in the
middle, they are closely placed together, and the tail is of
an equal breadth from top to bottom, and the end of the
feathers tipt with white. Its thighs are covered with feathers
of the same colour as the belly, which reach more
than half way down his leg; his legs and feet are black,
marked distinctly with scales. He has two toes before and
one behind, each of which have a sharp and crooked claw.
I never saw his nest; but in flying, and while sitting, he perfectly
resembles the cuckoo. I never heard, nor could I learn
from any others, that he had any voice or song. He makes
a sharp, snapping noise, as often as he catches the bees,
which is plainly from closing his beak.

Jerome Lobo, whom I have often mentioned, describes
this bird, and attributes to him a peculiar instinct, or faculty
of discovering honey; he says, when this bird has
discovered any honey he repairs to the high-way, and when
he sees a traveller, he claps with his wings, sings, and by a
variety of actions invites him to follow him, and flying
from tree to tree before him, stops where the honey is
discovered to be, and there he begins to sing most melodiously.

The ingenious Dr Sparman could not omit an opportunity
of building a story upon so fair a foundation. He too
gives an account of a cuckoo in size and shape resembling
a sparrow, and then gives a long description of it in Latin,

181

from which it should not resemble a sparrow. This he calls
Cuculus Indicator
81
. It seems it has a partition treaty at
once both with men and foxes, not a very ordinary association.

To these two partners he makes his meaning equally
known by the alluring sound, as he calls it, of Tcherr
Tcherr, which we may imagine, in the Hottentot language
of birds, may signify Honey; but it does not sing,
it seems, so melodiously as Jerome Loboâs bird. I cannot
for my own part conceive, in a country where so many
thousand hives of bees are, that there was any use for
giving to a bird a peculiar instinct or faculty of discovering
honey, when, at the same time, nature had denied him the
power of availing himself of any advantage from the discovery,
for man seems in this case to be made for the service
of the Moroc, which is very different from the common
ordinary course of things; man certainly needs him not,
for on every tree and on every hillock he may see plenty of
combs at his own deliberate disposal. I cannot then but think,
with all submission to these natural philosophers, that the
whole of this is an improbable fiction, nor did I ever hear a
single person in Abyssinia suggest, that either this, or any
other bird, had such a property. Sparman says it was not
known to any inhabitant of the Cape, no more than that of
the Moroc was in Abyssinia; it was a secret of nature, hid
from all but these two great men, and I most willingly
leave it among the catalogue of their particular discoveries.

182

I have only to add, that though Dr Sparman and his
learned associates, that feed upon the crumbs from other
peopleâs tables, may call this bird a cuckoo, still I hope he
will not insist upon correcting my mistake, as, in the article
of the fennec, by ignorantly tacking to it some idle fable of
his own, that he may name it Cuculus Indicator.

SHEREGRIG.

This
bird is one of those called Rollier in French, and
Rollier in English, without either nation being able to
say what is its signification in either language. In the
French it is the name of a tribe, always as ill delineated as
it is described, because scarce ever seen by those that either
describe, or delineate it; in Latin it is called Merops. Its true
name, in its native country, is Sheregrig, and by this name

183

it is known in Syria, and Arabia, and in the low country
of Abyssinia, on the borders of Sennaar, wherever there
are meadows, or long grass, interspersed with lofty or shady
trees.

Sheregrig.

There are two different kinds of this bird in Syria considerably
varying in colours, the brown of the back being
considerably darker in that of the Syriac, and the blue
much deeper, chiefly on its wings; the back of the head,
likewise brown, with very little pale-blue throughout
any part of it, and wanting the two long feathers in the
tail. It is a fly-catcher, or bee-eater, of which these long
feathers are the mark. It is said by Dr Shaw, and writers
that have described it, to be of the size of a jay, to which
indeed the Syrian bird approaches, but this before us seems
the least of his kind, and weighs half an ounce more than
a blackbird. It is consequently true, as Dr Shaw, says, that
it has a smaller bill than a jay, because the bird itself is
smaller, neither is there any disproportion in the length of
its legs. Shaw says, it is called Shagarag, which, he imagines,
by a transmutation of letters, to be the same with
Sharakrak of the Talmudists, or Shakarak of the Arabian
authors, and is derived from sharak, to shriek or squall.

But all this learning is very much misplaced; for from
the brightness of the colour, it is derived from a word which
signifies
to shine
. Its belly and inside of its wings are of a
most beautiful pale blue. The shoulder, or top of its wings,
a dark blue. The middle of the wing is traversed by a
band of light blue; the extremity of the wing, and the
largest feathers, are of a dark-blue. The two feathers of its

184

tail, where broad, are of a light blue, but the long sharp
single ones are of a dark blue, like the tips of the wings.
Its bill is strong and well made, and has a pencil of hairs as
whiskers. Round where the beak joins the head, the feathers
are white; the eye black, and well proportioned, surrounded
by a light flame-coloured iris. The back is of a
very light brown inclining to cream colour, and of a cast
of red. The feet are flesh-coloured and scaly, has three
toes before and one behind, each with a sharp claw.

Notwithstanding what has been said as to the derivation
of its name, I never heard it scream or make any sort
of noise. It has nothing of the actions of either the magpie
or the jay. Buxtorf interprets the sheregrig by merops
the bee-eater, and in so doing he is right, when he applies
it to this bird, but then he errs in mistaking another bird
for it, called Sirens, a fly-catcher, very common in the Levant,
which appear in great numbers, making a shrill, squaling
noise in the heat of the day; and of these I have seen, and designed
many different sorts, some very beautiful, but they fly
in flocks, which the sheregrig does not; he attaches himself
equally to swarms of bees and flies, which he finds in the
woods upon the trees, or in holes in the ground among the
high grass. Of these there are great swarms of different
kinds in the low part of Abyssinia.

The Count de Buffon has published two figures of this
bird, one from a specimen I gave him from Abyssinia
82
, the
other from one stuffed, which he received from Senegal
83
,

185

so that we know the bird possesses the whole breadth of
Africa nearly on a parallel. I may be allowed to say, that,
when I gave him mine, I did not expect he would so far have
anticipated my publication as to have exhibited it as a part
of the kingâs cabinet till he had heard my idea of it, and
what further I could relate of its history more than he had
learned from seeing the feathers of it only. When I saw
the draught, it put me in mind of the witty poem of Martial:
A man had stole some of his verses, but read them so
ill, that the poet could not understand them well enough
to know they were his own—

Sed male dum recitas incipit esse tuum.

The bird is so ill-designed that it may pass for a different
species. It is too short in the body; too thick; its neck too
short and thick; its legs, the pupil and iris of the eye, of a
Wrong colour; its tail affectedly spread. These are the
consequences of drawing from stuffed subjects. The brown
upon the back is too dark, the light-blue too pale, too much
white upon the side of its head. These are the consequences
of having a bad painter; and the reader, by comparing
my figure with those drawn by Martinet in Buffon, may
easily perceive how very little chance he has to form a true
idea of any of these birds, if the difference is as great between
his other drawings and the original, as between my
drawing and his. De Seve would have given it a juster picture.

WAALIA.

This
pigeon, called Waalia, frequents the low parts of
Abyssinia, where it perches upon the highest trees, and
sits quietly in the shade during the heat of the day, so that
it is difficult to discover it, unless it has been seen to
alight. They likewise fly extremely high, in great flocks,
and for the most part affect a species of the beech-tree, upon
the mast or fruit of which they seem chiefly to live for food.
They are rarely seen in the mountainous part of the country
unless in their passage, for in the beginning of the
rainy season, in the Kolla, they emigrate to the south and
S. W. In this direction they are seen flying for days together.
It is supposed the high country, even in the fair
season, is too cold for them; and their seeking another habitation
towards the Atlantic Ocean, where it is warm, and
where the rains do not fall so copiously in that season as
they do in the Kolla in Abyssinia, makes this conjecture still
more probable.

They perch for most part upon the tops of trees, beyond
the sphere of the action of Abyssinian powder; but they sit so
close together that I have sometimes shot six or more at the
discharge of a single barrel. The rest immediately plunge
down almost to touch you, apparently ignorant whence so
unaccustomed a sound comes; there, if you are a good
marksman, and alert, you have another chance, though but
a short one, for they immediately tower to an immoderate
height, and never alight in sight unless they are wounded.
They are exceedingly fat, and by far the best of all pigeons;
when they fall from a height, without life, upon their back,
I have known the flesh on each side of their breast-bone separated
by the concussion, and the fat upon their rump
bruised like the pulp of an orange.

Although this is undoubtedly a pigeon, the Abyssinians
do not eat it; nay, after it is dead they will not touch it, for
fear of defiling themselves, any more than they would do a
dead horse. The waalia is less than the common blue pigeon,
but larger than the turtle-dove. Its whole back, and
some of the short feathers of its wings, are of a beautiful
unvarnished green, lighter and livelier than an olive. Its
head and neck are of a deader green, with still less lustre. Its
beak is of a bluish white, with large nostrils; the eye black,
with an iris of dark orange. The pinion, or top of its
wing, is a beautiful pompadour. The large feathers of the
wing are black; the outer edge of the wing narrowly
marked with white; the tail a pale, dirty blue; below the
tail it is spotted with brown and white. Its thighs are
white, with small spots of brown; its belly a lively yellow.
Its legs and feet are a yellowish brown. Its feet stronger
and larger than is generally found in this kind of bird. I

188

never heard it coo, or make any noise. I killed this, and
many others, in our road to Tcherkin. In M. de Buffonâs
collection I see a bird resembling this, coming from the
west of Africa, as I remember; but his birds in general
are so very ill-drawn, and his coloured ones so shamefully
daubed, that nothing certain can be founded upon resemblance.

TSALTSALYA, or FLY.

The
insect which we have here before us is a proof
how fallacious it is to judge by appearances. If we
consider its small size, its weakness, want of variety or beauty,
nothing in the creation is more contemptible and insignificant.
Yet passing from these to his history, and to the
account of his powers, we must confess the very great
injustice we do him from want of consideration. We

189

are obliged, with the greatest surprise, to acknowledge, that
those huge animals, the elephant, the rhinoceros, the lion and
the tiger, inhabiting the same woods, are still vastly his inferiors,
and that the appearance of this small insect, nay,
his very sound, though he is not seen, occasions more trepidation,
movement, and disorder, both in the human and
brute creation, than would whole herds of these monstrous
animals collected together, though their number was in a
tenfold proportion greater than it really is.

The necessity of keeping my narrative clear and intelligible
as I proceeded, has made me anticipate the principal
particularities relating to this insect. His operations are
too materially interwoven with the history of this country,
to be left apart as an episode. The reader will find the
description
84
of its manners in that part of my history which
treats of the Shepherds, and in several places throughout the
narrative he will meet with accounts of the consequences of
its wonderful influence. Providence, from the beginning
it would seem, had fixed its habitation to one species of
soil, being a black fat earth, extraordinary fruitful; and
small and inconsiderable as it was, it seems from the first
to have given a law to the settlement of the country. It
prohibited absolutely those inhabitants of the fat earth,
called Mazaga, domiciled in caves and mountains, from enjoying
the help or labour of any beasts of carriage. It deprived
them of their flesh and milk for food, and gave rise
to another nation, whose manners were just the reverse of
the first. These were the Shepherds, leading a wandering

190

life, and preserving these immense herds of cattle by conducting
them into the sands beyond the limits of the black
earth, and bringing them back again when the danger from
this insect was over.

We cannot read the history of the plagues which God
brought upon Pharaoh by the hands of Moses, without
stopping a moment to consider a singularity, a very principal
one, which attended this plague of the fly. It was not till
this time, and by means of this insect, that God said, he
would separate his people from the Egyptians. And it
would seem, that then a law was given to them, that fixed
the limits of their habitation. It is well known, as I have
repeatedly said, that the land of Goshen, or Geshen, the possession
of the Israelites, was a land of pasture, which was
not tilled or sown, because it was not overflowed by the
Nile. But the land overflowed by the Nile was the
black earth of the valley of Egypt, and it was here
that God confined the flies; for he says, it shall be a sign
of this separation of the people, which he had then made,
that not one fly should be seen in the sand or pasture
ground, the land of Goshen, and this kind of soil has ever
since been the refuge of all cattle emigrating from the
black earth to the lower part of Atbara. Isaiah, indeed, says,
that the fly shall be in all the desert places, and consequently
the sands; yet this was a particular dispensation of providence,
to answer a special end, the desolation of Egypt, and
was not a repeal of the general law, but a confirmation of
it; it was an exception, for a particular purpose, and a limited
time.

191

I have already said so much of this insect, that it would
be tiring my readerâs patience to repeat any thing concerning
him. I shall therefore content myself, by giving a very
accurate design of him, only observing, that, for distinctness
sake, I have magnified him something above twice the natural
size. He has no sting, though he seems to me to be rather
of the bee kind; but his motion is more rapid and sudden than
that of the bee, and resembles that of the gad-fly in England.
There is something particular in the sound, or buzzing of
this insect. It is a jarring noise, together with a humming;
which induces me to believe it proceeds, at least in part,
from a vibration made with the three hairs at his snout.

The Chaldee version is content with calling this animal
simply Zebub, which signifies the fly in general, as we express
it in English. The Arabs call it Zimb in their translation,
which has the same general signification. The Ethiopic
translation calls it Tsaltsalya, which is the true name of
this particular fly in Geez, and was the same in Hebrew.

The Greeks have called this species of fly Cynomya,
which signifies the dog-fly, in imitation of which, those, I
suppose, of the church of Alexandria, that, after the coming
of Frumentius, were correcting the Greek copy, and making
it conformable to the Septuagint, have called this fly Tsaltsalya
Kelb, to answer the word Cynomya, which is dog-fly.
But this at first sight is a corruption, apparently the language
of strangers, and is not Ethiopic. It is the same as if we
were to couple the two nominative substantives Canis and
Musca, to translate Cynomya. Canis is indeed a dog, and
Musca is a fly, but these two words together, as I have now
wrote them, could never be brought to signify dog-fly. It is

192

the same in the Ethiopic, where Tsaltsalya alone signifies
dog-fly, without the addition of any other word whatever.
What is the derivation of this is doubtful, because there are
several words, both in the Ethiopic and Hebrew, that are
exceedingly apposite and probable. Salal, in the Hebrew,
signifies to buzz, or to hum, and, as it were, alludes to the
noise with which this animal terrifies the cattle: and Tsaltsalya
seems to come from this, by only doubling the radicals.
tâTsalalou, in Amharic, signifies to pierce with violence;
from this is derived Tsalatie, the name of a javelin
with a round point, made to enter the rings of a coat of
mail, which, by its structure, is impervious to the round
cutting points of the ordinary lance or javelin. In the book
of Job
85
this seems to mean a trident, or fishing-spear, and
is vaguely enough translated Habergeon in the English
copy. I do not know that this insect, however remarkable
for its activity and numbers, has ever before been described
or delineated.

EL ADDA.

There
is no genus of quadrupeds that I have known in
the east so very numerous as that of the lizard, or of
which there are so many varieties. The eastern, or desert
parts of Syria, bordering upon Arabia Deserta, which still
have moisture sufficient, abound with them beyond a possibility
of counting them. I am positive that I can say,
without exaggeration, that the number I saw one day in
the great court of the Temple of the Sun at Baalbec amounted
to many thousands; the ground, the walls and stones of
the ruined buildings, were covered with them, and the various
colours of which they consisted made a very extraordinary
appearance, glittering under the sun, in which they
lay sleeping, or basking. It was in vain, in a place so full of
wonders as Baalbec, to think of spending time in designing
lizards. I contented myself with collecting and preserving
those I could catch entire, many of which have perished

194

by the accidents of the journey, though some of very
great beauty have escaped, and are in my collection in great
preservation.

As I went eastward towards the desert, the number of this
animal decreased, I suppose, from a scarcity of water; for
example, at Palmyra, thoâ there were ruins of ancient buildings,
and a great solitude, as at Baalbec, the lizards were
few, all of the colour of the ground, without beauty or variety,
and seemingly degenerated in point of size.

The Arabian naturalists and physicians were better acquainted
with the different species of this animal than any
philosophers have been since, and in all probability than any
strangers will ever be; they lived among them, and had an
opportunity of discovering their manners and every detail
of their private Åconomy. Happy if succeeding the Greeks
in these studies, they had not too frequently left observation
to deviate into fable; the field, too, which these various
species inhabit is a very extensive one, and comprehends all
Asia and Africa, that is, great portion of the old world, every
part of which is, from various causes, more inaccessible at
this day, than after the Arabian conquest. It is from the
Arabian books then that we are to study with attention the
descriptions given of the animals of the country. But very
great difficulties occur in the course of these disquisitions.
The books that contain them are still extant, and all the animals
likewise exist as before; but, unfortunately, the Hebrew,
the Syriac, and the Arabic, are languages very ambiguous
and equivocal, and are in terms too loose and vague
for modern accuracy and precise description, and especially
so in that of colours; besides, that unbounded liberty of transposition

195

of letters, and syllables of words, in which the writers
of those languages have indulged themselves, from notions
of elegance, seem to require, not only a very skilful
and attentive, but also a judicious and sober-minded reader,
that does not run away with whimsical, or first conceptions,
but weighs the character of his author, the common idioms
of language which he uses, and opportunities of information
that he had concerning the subjects upon which
he wrote, in preference to others that may have treated the
same, but who differ from them in facts.

The small lizard here described is a native of Atbara
beyond the rains, in that situation where we have said the
island and city of MeroÃ« formerly were. It seemed also to
be well known by the different black inhabitants that came
from the westward by the great caravan which crossed the
desert north of the Niger, and is called the Caravan of Sudan,
of which I have often spoken, as being the only barbarians
who seem to pay the least attention to any articles of natural
history. These bring to Cairo, and to Mecca, multitudes
of green paroquets, monkeys, weasels, mice, lizards, and serpents,
for the diversion and curiosity of the men of note in
Arabia, or of the Beys and the women of the great at Cairo.
This lizard is called El Adda, it burrows in the sand,
and performs this operation so quickly, that it is out of
sight in an instant, and appears rather to have found a hole,
than to have made one, yet it comes out often in the heat
of the day, and basks itself in the sun; and if not very much
frightened, will take refuge behind stones, or in the withered,
ragged roots of the absinthium, dried in the sun to nearly
its own colour.

196

Almost the whole of this large tribe of lizards is, by
the Arabians, described as poisonous. Experiment has detected
the falsehood of this, in very many species; the same
idea has led them to attribute to them medicinal virtues in
the same proportion, and, I am apt to believe, with nearly as
little reason; at least, though the books prescribing them
are in everybodyâs hands, the remedy is not now made use
of in the places where those books were wrote; and this
affords a strong proof that the medicine was never very
efficacious.

The El Adda is one of the few which the Arabs in all
times have believed to be free of poisonous qualities, and
yet to have all the medicinal virtues that they have so abundantly
lavished upon the more noxious species. It has
been reputed to be a cure for that most terrible of all diseases,
the Elephantiasis; yet this distemper is not, that I know,
in the hotter parts of Africa, and certainly this lizard is not
an inhabitant of the higher or colder parts of Abyssinia,
which we may call exclusively the domicil of the elephantiasis.
It is likewise thought to be efficacious in cleansing
the skin of the body, or face, from cutaneous eruptions, of
which the inhabitants of this part of Africa are much more
afraid than they are of the plague; it is also used against
films, and suffusions on the eyes. I never did try the effect
of any of these, but give their history solely upon the authority
of the Arabian authors.

I have drawn it here of its natural size, which is 6-1/6 inches.
Though its legs are very long, it does not make use of
them to stand upright, but creeps with its belly almost
close to the ground. It runs, however, with very great velocity.

197

It is very long from its shoulder to its nose, being
nearly two inches. Its body is round, having scarce any
flatness in its belly. Its tail too is perfectly round, having
no flatness in its lower part. It is exceedingly sharp-pointed,
and very easily broke, yet I have seen several
where the part broke off has been renewed so as scarcely to
be discernible. It is the same length, 2-1/6 inches, between
the point of the tail and the joint of the hinder leg, as was
between the nose and the shoulder of the foreleg. Its forehead
from the occiput is flat, its shape conical, not pointed,
but rounded at the end in the shape of some shovels or
spades. The head is darker than the body, the occiput
darker still; its face is covered with fine black lines, which
cross one another at right angles like a net. Its eyes are
small, defended with a number of strong black hairs for
eye-lashes. Its upper jaw is longer, and projects considerably
over the under; both its jaws have a number of short,
fine, but very feeble teeth, and when holding it in my hand,
though it struggled violently to get loose, it never attempted
to make use of its teeth; indeed it seems to turn its
neck with great difficulty. Its ears are large, open, and nearly
round. Its body is a light-yellow, bordering on a straw-colour,
crossed with eight bands of black, almost equally
distant, except the two next the tail. All these decrease both
in breadth and length from the middle towards each extremity
of the animal. The scales are largest along the
back, they are very close, though the divisions are sufficiently
apparent. Their surface is very polished, and seems as
if varnished over. Its legs from the shoulder to the middle
toe are nearly an inch and three quarters long; its feet are
composed of five toes, the extremity of each is armed with

198

a brown claw of no great strength, whose end is tipt with
black.

I have heard some of the common people call this lizard
Dhab: This we are to look upon as an instance of ignorance
in the vulgar, rather than the opinion of a naturalist
well informed; for the Dhab is a species perfectly well
known to be different from this, and is frequently met with
in the deserts which surround Cairo.

CERASTES, or HORNED VIPER.

There
is no article of natural history the ancients have
dwelt on more than that of the viper, whether poets,
physicians, or historians. All have enlarged upon the particular
sizes, colours, and qualities, yet the knowledge of their
manners is but little extended. Almost every author that has
treated of them, if he hath advanced some truths which he
has left slenderly established by proof or experiment, by way of

199

compensation, hath added as many falsehoods so strongly
asserted, that they have occasioned more doubt than the
others have brought of light, certainty, and conviction.

Lucan, in Catoâs march through the desert of the Cyrenaicum
in Search of Juba, gives such a catalogue of these venomous
animals, that we cannot wonder, as he insinuates,
that great part of the Roman army was destroyed by them;
yet I will not scruple to aver this is mere fable. I have travelled
across the Cyrenaicum in all its directions, and never
saw but one species of viper, which was the Cerastes, or
Horned Viper, now before us. Neither did I ever see any of
the snake kind that could be mistaken for the viper. I apprehend
the snake cannot subsist without water, as the Cerastes,
from the places in which he is found, seems assuredly
to do. Indeed those that Lucan speaks of must have
been all vipers, because the mention of every one of their
names is followed by the death of a man.

There are no serpents of any kind in Upper Abyssinia
that ever I saw, and no remarkable varieties even in Low,
excepting the large snake called the Boa, which is often
above twenty feet in length, and as thick as an ordinary
manâs thigh. He is a beast of prey, feeds upon antelopes,
and the deer kind, which having no canine teeth, consequently
no poison, he swallows whole, after having broken
all its bones in pieces, and drawn it into a length to be more
easily mastered. His chief residence is by the grassy pools
of rivers that are stagnant. Notwithstanding which, we
hear of the Monk Gregory telling M. Ludolf, that serpents
were so frequent in Abyssinia, that every man carried with
him a stick bent in a particular manner, for the more commodiously

200

killing these creatures, and this M. Ludolf recommends
as a discovery. And Jerome Lobo, among the
rest of his fables, has some on this subject likewise. A cold
and rainy country can never be a habitation for vipers.
We see, on the contrary, that their favourite choice are deserts
and burning sand, without verdure, and without any
moisture whatever.

The very learned, though too credulous, Prosper Alpinus,
says, that many have assured him, that near the lakes contiguous
to the sources of the Nile there is a number of basiliscs,
about a palm in length, and the thickness of a middle finger;
that they have two large scales, which they use as wings,
and crests and combs upon their head, from which they are
called Basilisci or Reguli, that is, crowned, crested, or kingly
serpents; and he says that no person can approach these
lakes without being destroyed by these crested snakes.

With all submission to this naturalistâs relation, I should
imagine he could not have heard the description of these
lakes from many travellers, if all those that approached them
were killed by the basiliscs. I shall only answer for this,
that having examined the Lake Gooderoo, those of Court
Ohha, and Tzana, the only lakes near the sources of the
Nile, I never yet saw one serpent there, whether crowned or
uncrowned, nor did I ever hear of any, and therefore believe
this account as fabulous as that of the Acontia and other
animals he speaks of in this whole chapter
86
. The basilisc
is a species of serpent, frequently made mention of in

201

scripture, though never described, farther than that he cannot
be charmed so as to do no hurt, nor trained so as to delight
in music; which all travellers who have been in Egypt
know is exceedingly possible, and frequently seen. âFor,
behold, I will send basiliscs among you, saith the scripture,
which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the
Lord
87
â. And
88
âThou shalt tread upon the lion and basilisc
89
&c.â

I shall mention one name more, under which the Cerastes
goes, because it is equivocal, and has been misunderstood
in scripture, that is Tseboa, which name is given it
in the Hebrew, from its different colours and spots. And
hence the Greeks
90
have called it by the name of HyÃ¦na,
because it is of the same reddish colour, marked with
black spots as that quadruped is. And the same fable is applied
to the serpent and quadruped, that they change their
sex yearly.

Some philosophers, from particular system, have judged
from a certain disposition of this animalâs scales, that it is
what they term, Coluber, while others, from some arrangement
of the scales of its tail, will have it to be what they call
Boa. I enter not into the dispute, it is here as faithfully
represented as the size will permit, only I shall observe that,

202

unless Boa means something more than I know it does,
the name is ill chosen when applied to any species of poisonous
serpents, because it is already the proper name of the
large snake, just mentioned, that is not viviparous, and has
no poison. Pliny and Galen say, that the young vipers are so
fierce as to become parricides, and destroy their mother upon
their birth. But this is surely one of the ill-grounded fancies
these authors have adopted. The Cerastes is mentioned
by name in Lucan, and without warranting the separate
existence of any of the rest, I can see several that are but
the Cerastes under another term. The thebanus ophites,
the ammodytes, the torrida dipsas, and the prester
91
, all of
them are but this viper described from the form of its parts,
or its colours. Cato must have been marching in the night
when he met this army of serpents. The Cerastes hides itself
all day in holes in the sand, where it lives in contiguous
and similar houses to those of the jerboa, and I have already
said, that I never but once found any animal in this viperâs
belly, but one jerboa in a gravid female cerastes.

I kept two of these last-mentioned creatures in a glass
jar, such as is used for keeping sweetmeats, for two years,
without having given them any food; they did not sleep,
that I observed, in winter, but cast their skins the last days of
April.

The Cerastes moves with great rapidity, and in all directions,
forward, backward, and sideways. When he inclines
to surprise any one who is too far from him, he creeps with

203

his side towards the person, and his head averted, till judging
his distance, he turns round, springs upon him, and
fastens upon the part next to him; for it is not true what
is said, that the Cerastes does not leap or spring. I saw one
of them at Cairo, in the house of Julian and Rosa, crawl
up the side of a box, in which there were many, and there
lye still as if hiding himself, till one of the people who
brought them to us came near him, and though in a very
disadvantageous posture, sticking as it were perpendicular to
the side of the box, he leaped near the distance of three feet,
and fastened between the manâs forefinger and thumb, so as
to bring the blood. The fellow shewed no signs of either
pain or fear, and we kept him with us full four hours, without
his applying any sort of remedy, or his seeming inclined
to do so.

To make myself assured that the animal was in its perfect
state, I made the man hold him by the neck so as to force
him to open his mouth, and lacerate the thigh of a pelican,
a bird I had tamed, as big as a swan. The bird died in about
13 minutes, though it was apparently affected in 50 seconds;
and we cannot think this was a fair trial, because a very
few minutes before, it had bit the man, and so discharged
part of its virus, and it was made to scratch the pelican by
force, without any irritation or action of its own.

The Cerastes inhabits the greatest part of the eastern continent,
especially the desert sandy parts of it. It abounds in
Syria, in the three Arabias, and in Africa. I never saw so
many of them as in the Cyrenaicum, where the Jerboa is
frequent in proportion. He is a great lover of heat; for thoâ

204

the sun was burning hot all day, when we made a fire at
night, by digging a hole, and burning wood to charcoal in
it, for dressing our victuals, it was seldom we had fewer
than half a dozen of these vipers, who burnt themselves to
death approaching the embers.

I apprehend this to be the aspic which Cleopatra employed
to procure her death. Alexandria, plentifully supplied
by water, must then have had fruit of all kinds in its
gardens. The baskets of figs must have come from thence,
and the aspic, or Cerastes, that was hid in them, from the adjoining
desert, where there are plenty to this day; for to
the westward in Egypt, where the Nile overflows, there is no
sort of serpent whatever that I ever saw; nor, as I have before
said, is there any other of the mortal kind that I know
in those parts of Africa adjoining to Egypt, excepting the
Cerastes.

It should seem very natural for any one, who, from
motives of distress, has resolved to put a period to his
existence, especially women and weak persons unaccustomed
to handle arms, to seek the gentlest method to free
themselves from that load of life now become insupportable.
This, however, has not always been the case with
the ancients. Aria, Petusâs wife, stabbed herself with a
dagger, to set her husband an example to die, with this memorable
assurance, after giving herself the blow, âPetus, it
is not painful.â Porcia, the wife of Brutus, died by the
barbarous, and not obvious way of perishing, by swallowing
fire; the violent agitation of spirits prevailing over the momentary
difference in the suffering. It is not to be doubted
but that a woman, high-spirited like Cleopatra, was also above

205

the momentary differences in feeling; and had the way in
which she died not been ordinary and usual, she certainly
would not have applied herself to the invention of a new
one. We are therefore to look upon her dying by the bite
of the Cerastes, as only following the manner of death which
she had seen commonly adopted by those who were intended
to die without torment.

Galen speaking of the Aspic in the great city of Alexandria,
says, I have seen how speedily they (the aspics) occasioned
death. Whenever any person is condemned to die
whom they wish to end quickly and without torment, they
put the viper to his breast, and suffering him there to creep
a little, the man is presently killed. Pausanias speaks of
particular serpents that were to be found in Arabia among
the balsam trees, several of which I procured both alive
and dead, when I brought the tree from Beder Hunein;
but they were still the same species of serpent, only some
from sex, and some from want of age, had not the horns,
though in every other respect they could not be mistaken.
Ibn Sina, called by Europeans Avicenna, has described this
animal very exactly; he says it is frequent in Shem (that is
the country about and south of Damascus) and also in
Egypt; and he makes a very good observation on their
manners; that they do not go or walk straight, but
move by contracting themselves. But in the latter part of
his description he seems not to have known the serpent he
is speaking of, because he says its bite is cured in the same
manner as that of the viper and Cerastes, by which it is
implied, that the animal he was describing was not a Cerastes,
and the Cerastes is not a viper, both which assertions
are false.

206

The general size of the Cerastes, from the extremity of its
snout to the end of its tail, is from 13 to 14 inches. Its
head is triangular, very flat, but higher near where it joins
the neck than towards the nose. The length of its head,
from the point of the nose to the joining of the neck, is
10/12ths of an inch, and the breadth 9/12ths. Between its horns
is 3/12ths. The opening of its mouth, or rictus oris 8/12ths.
Its horns in length 3/12ths. Its large canine teeth something
more than 2/12ths and ½. Its neck at the joining of the head
4/12ths. The body where thickest 10/12ths. Its tail at the joining
of the body 2/12ths and ½. The tip of the tail 1/12th. The
length of the tail one inch and 3/12ths. The aperture of the
eye 2/12ths, but this varies apparently according to the impression
of light.

The Cerastes has sixteen small immoveable teeth, and in
the upper jaw two canine teeth, hollow, crooked inward,
and of a remarkable fine polish, white in colour, inclining
to blueish. Near one fourth of the bottom is strongly fixed
in the upper jaw, and folds back like a clasp knife, the point
inclining inwards, and the greatest part of the tooth is
covered with a green soft membrane, not drawn tight, but as
it were wrinkled over it. Immediately above this is a slit
along the back of the tooth, which ends nearly in the middle
of it, where the tooth curves inwardly. From this aperture
I apprehend that it sheds its poison, not from the point,
where with the best glasses I never could perceive an aperture,
so that the tooth is not a tube, but hollow only half
way; the point being for making the incision, and by its
pressure occasioning the venom in the bag at the bottom of
the fang to rise in the tooth, and spill itself through the slit
into the wound.

207

By this flat position of the tooth along the jaw, and its
being defended by the membrane, it eats in perfect safety;
for the tooth cannot press the bag of poison at the root
while it lies in this position, nor can it rise in the tube to
spill itself, nor can the tooth make any wound so as to receive
it, but the animal is supposed to eat but seldom, or
only when it is with young.

The viper has but one row of teeth, none but the canine
are noxious. The poison is very copious for so
small a creature, it is fully as large as a drop of laudanum
dropt from a vial by a careful hand. Viewed through a
glass, it appears not perfectly transparent or pellucid. I
should imagine it hath other reservoirs than the bag under
the tooth, for I compelled it to scratch eighteen pigeons
upon the thigh as quick as possible, and they all died nearly
in the same interval of time; but I confess the danger attending
the dissection of the head of this creature made
me so cautious, that any observation I should make upon
these parts would be less to be depended upon.

People have doubted whether or not this yellow liquor
is the poison, and the reason has been, that animals who
had tasted it did not die as when bitten, but this reason
does not hold in modern physics. We know why the saliva
of a mad dog has been given to animals and has not
affected them; and a German physician was bold enough
to distil the pus, or putrid matter, flowing from the ulcer
of a person infected by the plague, and taste it afterwards
without bad consequences; so that it is clear the poison
has no activity, till through some sore or wound it is admitted
into circulation. Again, the tooth itself, divested of

208

that poison, has as little effect. The viper deprived of his
canine teeth, an operation very easily performed, bites without
any fatal consequence with the others; and many instances
there have been of mad dogs having bit people cloathed
in coarse woollen stuff, which had so far cleaned the
teeth of the saliva in passing through it, as not to have left
the smallest inflammation after the wound.

I forbear to fatigue the reader by longer insisting upon
this subject. A long dissertation would remain upon the
incantation of serpents. There is no doubt of its reality.
The scriptures are full of it. All that have been in Egypt
have seen as many different instances as they chose. Some
have doubted that it was a trick, and that the animals so
handled had been first trained, and then disarmed of their
power of hurting; and fond of the discovery, they have rested
themselves upon it, without experiment, in the face of all antiquity.
But I will not hesitate to aver, that I have seen at
Cairo (and this may be seen daily without trouble or
expence) a man who came from above the catacombs,
where the pits of the mummy birds are kept, who has
taken a Cerastes with his naked hand from a number of
others lying at the bottom of the tub, has put it upon
his bare head, covered it with the common red cap he
wears, then taken it out, put it in his breast, and tied
it about his neck like a necklace; after which it has been
applied to a hen, and bit it, which has died in a few minutes;
and, to complete the experiment, the man has taken it by the
neck, and beginning at his tail, has ate it as one would do a
carrot or a stock of celery, without any seeming repugnance.

209

We know from history, that where any country has been
remarkably infested with serpents, there the people have been
screened by this secret. The Psylli and Marmarides of old
undoubtedly were defended in this manner,

Ad Quorum cantus mites JacuÃ©re CerastÃ¦.

Sil. Ital.
lib. iii.

To leave ancient history, I can myself vouch, that all the
black people in the kingdom of Sennaar, whether Funge or
Nuba, are perfectly armed against the bite of either scorpion
or viper. They take the Cerastes in their hands at all times,
put them in their bosoms, and throw them to one another
as children do apples or balls, without having irritated them,
by this usage so much as to bite. The Arabs have not this
secret naturally, but from their infancy they acquire an exemption
from the mortal consequences attending the bite of
these animals, by chawing a certain root, and washing themselves
(it is not anointing) with an infusion of certain plants
in water.

One day when I was with the brother of Shekh Adelan,
prime minister of Sennaar, a slave of his brought a Cerastes
which he had just then taken out of a hole, and
was using it with every sort of familiarity. I told him my
suspicion that the teeth had been drawn, but he assured me
they were not, as did his master Kittou, who took it from
him, wound it round his arm, and at my desire ordered the
servant to carry it home with me. I took a chicken by the
neck, and made it flutter before him; his seeming indifference
left him, and he bit it with great signs of anger, the
chicken died almost immediately; I say his seeming indifference,

210

for I constantly observed, that however lively the
viper was before, upon being seized by any of these barbarians
he seemed as if taken with sickness and feebleness, frequently
shut his eyes, and never turned his mouth towards
the arm of the person that held him. I asked Kittou how
they came to be exempted from this mischief? he said,
they were born so, and so said the grave and respectable men
among them. Many of the lighter and lower sort talked
of enchantments by words and by writing, but they all
knew how to prepare any person by medicine, which were
decoctions of herbs and roots.

I have seen many thus armed for a season do pretty
much the same feats as those that possessed the exemption
naturally, the drugs were given me, and I several times
armed myself, as I thought, resolved to try the experiment,
but my heart always failed me when I came to the trial;
because among these wretched people it was a pretence they
might very probably have sheltered themselves under, that
I was a Christian, that therefore it had no effect upon me.
I have still remaining by me a small quantity of this root,
but never had an opportunity of trying the experiment.

The reader will attend to the horn which is placed over
the eye in the manner I have given the figure of it, it is
fluted, and has four divisions. He will likewise observe the
tooth as viewed through a glass. He may suppose the
black represents a painterâs pallet, for the easier discerning
the white tooth, which could not otherwise appear distinctly
upon the white paper.

BINNY.

Although
the fish we find in the east are generally
more distinguished for their beauty and variety of
colours, or for their uncouth forms, rather than for the
goodness of the fish itself, this before us appears to be an exception;
though it is not without singularities, yet its form
and colour are very simple, and, for the elegance of its taste,
may vie with any fish caught in any river which runs
either into the Mediterranean or Ocean. Whether it is the
Latus, or the Oxyrinchus of antiquity, both fishes of the
Nile, so famous that divine honours were paid them, by
large cities, nomes, or districts situated upon that river, is
what I am not naturalist enough to discover. Such as it
is, in all its parts, I have placed it before the reader faithfully.

212

By the disproportion in the length of its jaws, I should
imagine this to be a fish of prey, though a circumstance
concerning the bait with which it is taken seems to contradict
this. The fish from which this drawing was made
weighed 32 pounds English, but is often caught of 70
pounds and upwards, as I have been told by the fishermen,
for I never saw one larger than the one I am now describing.
The largest of this kind are caught about Rosetto and
the mouth of the river, but they are very numerous, higher
up as far as Syene and the first cataract. This was caught
at Achmim, the ancient Panopolis, and the manner in which
this is performed is very uncommon and ingenious, and by
the few trials that I saw is also very successful.

They take a quantity of oil, clay, flour, and honey, with
straw, and some other thing that makes it stick together,
they knead or tread it with their feet till it is perfectly mixed.
They then take two handfuls of dates, and break
them into small pieces about the bigness of the point of
the finger, and stick them in different parts of this mixture,
which begins now to have such consistency as to adhere
perfectly together, and appears in form like a Cheshire
cheese. In the heart of this cake they put seven or eight
hooks, with dates upon them, and a string of strong whip-cord
to each. The fisherman then takes this large mass
of paste, and putting it upon a goatâs skin blown with wind,
rides behind it out into the middle of the stream; there he
drops it in the deepest part of the river, then cautiously
holding the ends of each of the strings slack, so as not to
pull the dates and the hooks out of the heart of the composition,
he gets again ashore upon his skin a little below
where he had sunk the solid mass.

213

When arrived on the shore, he carefully separates the
ends of the strings, and ties them, without straining, each
to a palm branch made fast on shore, to the end of every
one of which hangs a small bell. He then goes and feeds
his cattle, digs ditches, or lies down and sleeps as his business
calls him. The oil resists the water for some time, at
last the cake begins to dissolve, pieces fall off, the broken
dates dipped in the honey flow down the stream, and the
large fish below catch ravenously at them as they pass. The
fish follow these pieces up the stream, gathering them as
they go along till they get to the cake at last, when altogether,
as many as are assembled, fall voraciously to seek
the dates buried in the composition; each fish that finds
a date swallows it, together with an iron hook, and feeling
himself fast, makes off as speedily as possible; the consequence
is, endeavouring to escape from the line by which
he is fastened, he pulls the palm branch, and rings the
bell fastened to it.

The fisherman runs immediately to the bell, and finding
thereby the particular line, hauls his prisoner in, but does
not kill him; the hook being large, it generally catches him
by the upper jaw, which is considerably longer than the under.
He then pulls him out of the water, and puts a
strong iron ring through his jaw, ties a few yards of cord
to it, and fastens him to the shore, so he does with the
rest. Very rarely one hook is found empty. Those that
want fish at GirgÃ©, a large town opposite, or at Achmim itself,
come thither as to a fish-market, and every man takes
the quantity he wants, buying them alive. Fish when dead
do not keep here, which makes that precaution necessary.
We bought two, which fully dined our whole boatâs crew;

214

the fisherman had then ten or twelve fastened to the shore,
all of which he pulled out and shewed us.

I apprehend that formerly this method of fishing was
oftener practised, and better known than it is now, for I
have seen, in several fishing towns, a tree, in which there
was a fish with a ring through its nose, and beside it a bell.
I likewise imagine that this is the fish which Mr Norden
says the Kennouss caught at Syene, and which he calls a
Carp; but as I have already observed, streams are not the
haunt of leather-mouthed, or sucking fish, as is the carp, but
rather of such as are powerfully furnished with fins, as this is,
to struggle with, and traverse the current in all its directions.
I believe the carp to be a fish of northern climates; I have
never even seen them in these, they are certainly not in Ethiopia
whence the Nile comes; their name, Cyprinus, seem to
indicate they belong to Greece. They are found in the island
of Cyprus, but whether exclusively from the rest of the
islands is what I cannot determine.

This fish has two fins upon its back; the first has a sharp
short thorn before it, and is composed of seven longer ones,
sharp pointed, but much weaker in shape, resembling the
latine sail of a boat. The one behind it is composed of
eleven small pliable bones, but not armed with any defence.
The belly has two fins, made of pliable, unarmed bones
likewise, and on its side near the gills it has two others of
the same kind. The tail is forked into two sharp thin narrow
divisions, that below are considerably shorter than above.
Below its throat is a parcel of long bones hanging
down like a beard, which grow longer as they approach the
tail, the last being the largest of all.

The whole body of this fish is covered with silver scales
much resembling silver spangles, they lie close together.
There is no variety of colour upon the whole fish excepting
a shade of red upon the end of the nose, which is fat
and fleshy. His eye is large and black, with a broad iris of
white stained with yellow. It has a number of small teeth
very sharp and closely set, nature has probably given him
this quantity of fins to save him from the crocodile, whom
by his size he seems destined to feed.

CARETTA, or SEA-TORTOISE.

Among
the natural productions of the Red Sea, which
either have been or are at present articles of commerce,
I shall just speak a little of that species of the Testudo
or Tortoise, called the Caretta or Hawkâs-bill. It is greatly inferior
in size to the West Indian or American sea-tortoise. The
extreme length of the shell of this was 3 feet 7 inches, and

216

which was esteemed a large one. Simple as it is, I do
not know one good figure of it. This which I have
submitted to the reader may be depended upon for its exactness,
otherwise the animal is well known, and has often been
described.

Its back is covered like the rest of other turtles, with a
bony substance, and this again is covered by lamina, or
scales of a thin transparent texture, variegated with dark
brown streaks, disposed in each scale as radii proceeding
from a centre. The outer rows of the great scales are irregular
pentagons. The row that runs down the middle
between these are regular hexagons, and round the whole
circumference the large scales are inclosed by a kind
of quadrangular frame firmly united; the broadest and
largest of these scales being nearest the tail. The lowest
of all, as it were in the centre of the lowest part of the
figure, is notched, the centre of this division answering
to a line drawn through the middle of the oval, and the
head or occiput.

This fish lays a multitude of eggs. Some have said that
these are laid among stones, contrary to the practice of the
large sea-turtle, which lays them upon sand. All I can say to
this is, that I have seen them but seldom, and always upon
sand, but never among stones. The fish itself is a very dry and
coarse food, very different from that delicate species which
comes from the West Indies, if the difference does not lie a great
deal in the cookery. At the time that I ate of this animal,
I was going to view the junction of the Indian Ocean without
the Straits of Babelmandeb, and the wind setting in contrary,

217

we were in great fear of not being able to return, as
the reader will have seen in our voyage. Particularly, I did
not observe any of the green fat, so well known to our epicures,
nor indeed any fat at all. When roasted, it tasted to
me much like old veal new killed. It is only an inhabitant
of the mouth of the Gulf. They seldom come up the length
of Mocha; when they do, they are few in number, are probably
sick, and not able to bear the agitation of the waves
from the south-westers.

The Egyptians dealt largely with Rome in this elegant
article of commerce. Pliny tells us, the cutting them for
fineering or inlaying, was first practised by Carvilios Pollio,
from which we would presume that the Romans were ignorant
of the Arabian and Egyptian art of separating the
lamina by fire, placed in the inside of the shell when the
meat is taken out; for these scales, though they appear
perfectly distinct and separate, do yet adhere, and oftener
break than split where the mark of separation may be
seen distinct. Martial
92
says, that beds were inlaid with it.
Juvenal
93
, and Apuleius, in his tenth Book mentions that the
Indian bed was all over shining with tortoise-shell in the
outside, and swelling with stuffing of down within. The immense
use made of it in Rome may be guessed by what we
learn from Velleius Paterculus
94
, who says, that when Alexandria
was taken by Julius CÃ¦sar, the magazines, or ware-houses,
were so full of this article, that he proposed to have
made it the principal ornament of his triumph, as he did

218

ivory afterwards when triumphing for having happily finished
the African war.

This, too, in more modern times, was a great article in
the trade to China, and I have always been exceedingly surprised,
since near the whole of the Arabian Gulf is comprehended
in the charter of the East India Company, that
they do not make an experiment of fishing both pearls and
tortoises; the former of which, so long abandoned, must
now be in great plenty and excellence, and a few fishers put
on board each ship trading to Jidda, might surely find very
lucrative employment with a long-boat or pinnace, at the
time the vessels were selling their cargo in the port, and
while busied in this gainful occupation, the coasts of the
Red Sea might be fully explored.

Of PEARLS.

The
ships which navigated the Red Sea brought gold
and silver from Ophir and Tarshish; they brought
myrrh, frankincense, and ivory, from Saba, and various
kinds of spices from the continent of Asia, across the Indian
ocean. If we judge by the little notice taken of them in very
ancient times, the treasures which lay nearer home, in their
own seas, and upon their own shores, were very little sought
after, or spoken of, in the days when the navigation of the
Arabian gulf was at its height. We are not, however, to believe
that the pearl fishery, even in those days, was totally
neglected; but foreign trade was grown to such a magnitude,
and its value so immense, that we are not to be surprised, that
articles that were only a matter of ornament and luxury,
or of domestic use, and did not enter into the medium of

220

commerce, were little spoken of, however closely followed
and well understood.

We gather from scripture, the only history of these early
times to be depended upon, that precious stones were imported
from the southern coast of Africa. This trade, however
great it might be, is mentioned but slightly, and as it
were accidentally, being absorbed in the very great articles
of commerce then spoken of. In the same manner we
read of the beauty and excellence of pearls cursorily introduced,
often by allusions and comparisons throughout the
sacred books, but always in a manner which sufficiently
shews the great intrinsic estimation in which they were
held.

Pearls are found in all the four quarters of the
world, but in no degree of excellence, excepting in the
east of Africa and in Asia. They are in every part of the
Red Sea, they are in the Indian Ocean, in that low part of
the coast of Arabia Felix called the Baherein, which joins
to the Gulf of Persia. There are banks where they are found
about Gombron to the eastward of that Gulf, or in the flat
coast there; and in the seas which wash the island of Ceylon,
many have been found of the greatest beauty and price; and
for number, they are nowhere so plentiful as in the Baherein,
between the coast of Arabia Felix and the island of Ormus,
whence they are transported to Aleppo, then sent to
Leghorn, and circulated through Europe, and this above all
others is the market for seed pearls.

The oyster is currently reported to be the species of fish
where this precious guest is lodged, and many a weary

221

search and inquiry I have made after these oysters in the
Red Sea, despairing always to see a pearl, till we had first
found an oyster. The fact, however, turned out to be, that
there are no such fish as oysters in the Arabian Gulf, and
though our success in finding pearls was small, yet we got
from the natives of the coast a sufficient number as well as information,
to put it beyond doubt to what fish this beautiful
and extraordinary production belonged.

Pearls are produced only in shells that are bivalves, that
is, which have an upper and lower shell closing by a hinge
in a manner little differing from the oyster. It is commonly
said by the fishermen, that all bivalves in the Red Sea
have pearls of some kind in them. This is a very rude and
large view of the matter, for though it is true that some excrescences,
or secretions, of the nature of pearls, may be
found in the bisser, and the large bivalves with which this
sea abounds, yet it is well known to all conversant in these
matters, that many of the pearl shell itself (I shall not call it
an oyster, for it is not one) are found without any pearl or
likeness of pearl in them; being, I suppose, not yet arrived
to that age when the extravasation of that juice which
forms the pearl happens.

There are three shell fish in the Red Sea which regularly
are sought after as containing pearls. The first is a mussel,
and this is of the rarest kind, whether they are now failed
in number, or whether they were at any former time frequent,
is now unknown. They are chiefly found in the
north end of the Gulf, and on the Egyptian side. The only
part I have ever seen them was about Cosseir, and to the
northward of it, where I must observe there was an ancient

222

port, called Myos Hormos, which commentators have called
the Port of the Mouse, when they should have translated
it, the Harbour of the Mussel. This fish contains often pearls
of great beauty for lustre and shape, but seldom of a white
or clear water. Pliny relates this to be the case in the Italian
seas, and also in the Thracian Bosphorus, where he observes
they are more frequent.

The second sort of shell which generally contains the
pearl is called Pinna. It is broad and semicircular at the
top, and decreases till it turns sharp at the lower end, where
is the hinge. It is rough and figured on the outside, of a
beautiful red colour, exceedingly fragil, and sometimes
three feet long. In the inside it is cloathed with a most
beautiful lining called Nacre, or mother-of-pearl, white, tinged
with an elegant blush of red. Of this most delicate
complexion is the pearl found in this fish, so that it seems
to confirm the sentiments of M. Reamur on the formation of
pearls, that they are formed of that glutinous fluid which
is the first origin of the shell, that it forms the pearl of the
same colour and water that is communicated to it from
that part of the shell with which it is more immediately in
contact, and which is generally observed in the pinna to be
higher in colour as it approaches the broadest, which is the
reddest end.

Upon the maturest consideration, I can have no doubt
that the pearl found in this shell is the penim or peninim
rather, for it is always spoken of in the plural, to which allusion
has been often made in scripture. And this derived
from its redness is the true reason of its name. On the
contrary, the word pinna has been idly imagined to be derived

223

from penna, a feather, as being broad and round at
the top, and ending at a point, or like a quill below. The
English translation of the scripture, erroneous and innacurate
in many things more material, translates this peninim
by rubies
95
, without any foundation or authority, but because
they are both red, as are bricks and tiles, and many
other things of base and vile materials. The Greeks have
translated it literally pina, or pinna, and the shell they call
Pinnicus; and many places occur in Strabo, Elian, Ptolemy,
and Theophrastus, which are mentioned famous for this
species of pearl. I should imagine also, that by Solomon
saying it is the most precious of all productions, he means,
that this species of pearl was the most valued, or the best
known in Judea. For though we learn from Pliny that the
excellency of pearls was their whiteness, yet we know the
pearls of a yellowish cast are those esteemed in India to this
day, as the peninim, or reddish pearl was in Judea in the
days of Solomon.

The third sort of pearl-bearing shell is what I suppose
has been called the Oyster; for the two shells I have
already spoken of surely bear no sort of likeness to that
shell-fish, nor can this, though most approaching to it, be
said any way to resemble it, as the reader will judge by a
very accurate drawing given of it, now before him.

224

Bochart says these are called Darra, or Dora in Arabic,
which seems to be the general word for all pearls in
scripture, whereas the peninim is one in particular. In the
Red Sea, where it holds the first rank among pearls, it is
called Lule single, or
96
Lulu el Berber,
i. e.
the pearl of
Berber, Barabra, or Beja, the country of the Shepherds,
which we have already spoken of at large, extending from
the northern tropic, southward, to the country of the Shangalla
or Troglodytes. Androsthenes says, the ancient name
of these pearls was Berberis, which he believes to be an Indian
word, and so it is, understanding, as the ancients did,
India to mean the country I have already mentioned between
the tropics.

The character of this pearl is extreme whiteness, and
even in this whiteness Pliny justly says there are shades
or differences. To continue to use his words, the clearest
of these are found in the Red Sea, but those in India have
the colour of the flakes, or divisions of the lapis specularis.
The most excellent are those like a solution of alum, limpid,
milky like, and even with a certain almost imperceptible
cast of a fiery colour. Theophrastus says, that these pearls
are transparent, as indeed the foregoing description of Pliny
would lead us to imagine; but it is not so, and if they were,
it is apprehended they would lose all their beauty and value,
and approach too much to glass.

It has been erronenously said, that pearl shells grow
upon rocks, and again, that they are caught by nets. This

225

is certainly a contradiction, as nobody would employ nets
to gather fish from among rocks. On the contrary, all kinds
of pearl are found in the deepest, stillest water, and softest
bottom. The parts of most of them are too fine to bear the
agitation of the sea among rocks. Their manners and
Åconomy are little known, but, as far as I have observed,
they are all stuck in the mud upright by an extremity, the
mussel by one end, the pinna by the small sharp point, and
the berberi, or lule, by the hinge or square part which projects
from the round.

In shallow and clear streams I have seen small furrows
or tracts, upon the sandy bottom, by which you could trace
the mussel, from its last station, and these not straight, but
deviating into traverses and triangles, like the course of a
ship in a contrary wind laid down upon a map, the tract of
the mussel probably in pursuit of food. The general
belief is, that the mussel is constantly stationary in a state
of repose, and cannot transfer itself from place to place.
This is a vulgar prejudice, and one of those facts that are
mistaken for want of sufficient pains, or opportunity, to make
more critical observation. Others finding the first opinion a
false one, and that they are endowed with power of changing
place like other animals, have, upon the same foundation,
gone into the contrary extreme, so far as to attribute
swiftness to them, a property surely inconsistent with their
being fixed to rocks. Pliny and Solinus say, that the mussel
have leaders, and go in flocks, and that their leader is
endowed with great cunning, to protect himself and his flock
from the fishers, and when he is taken, the others fall an
easy prey. This however I think we are to look upon as a
fable. Some of the most accurate observers having discovered

226

the motion of the mussel, which is indeed wonderful,
and that they lie in beds, which is not at all so, have added
the rest to make their history complete.

It is observed that pearls are always the most beautiful in
those places of the sea where a quantity of fresh water falls.
Thus in the Red Sea they were always most esteemed that
were fished from Suakem southward, that is in those parts
corresponding to the country anciently called Berberia, and
Azamia, from reasons before given; on the Arabian coast,
near the island Camaran, where there is abundance of fresh
water; and the island of Foosht, laid down in my map, where
there are springs; there I purchased one I had the pleasure
to see taken out of the shell. It has been said that the fish
of these shells are good, which is an error; they were the only
shell-fish in the Red Sea I found not eatable. I never saw
any pearl shells on either side southward of the parallel of
Mocha in Arabia Felix. As it is a fish that delights in repose,
I imagine it avoids this part of the gulf, as lying open
to the Indian Ocean, and agitated by variable winds.

In that part of my narrative where I speak of my return
through the Desert of Nubia, and the shells found there, I
have likewise mentioned the mussel found in the salt springs
that appear in various parts of that desert. These likewise
travel far from home, and are sometimes surprised by the
ceasing of the rains, at a greater distance from their beds
than they have strength and moisture to carry them. In
many of these shells I have found those kind of excrescences
which we may call Pearls, all of them ill-formed, foul,
and of a bad colour, but of the same consistence, and lodged

227

in the same part of the body as those in the sea. The mussel,
too, is in every respect similar, I think larger, the outer skin
or covering of it is of a vivid green. Upon removing this,
which is the epidermis, what next appears is a beautiful
pink, without gloss, and seemingly of a calcareous nature.
Below this, the mother-of-pearl, which is undermost, is a
white without lustre, partaking much of the blue, and very
little of the red, and this is all the difference I observed between
it and the pearl-bearing mussel in the Red Sea; but
even this latter I always found in still water, soft bottom,
and far from stony or rocky ground. None of these pearl
mussels, either in the Red Sea or the desert, have any appearance
of being spinners, as they are generally described
to be.

I have said that the Baherein has been esteemed the
place whence the greatest quantity of pearls are brought.
I would be understood to mean, that this has been the reputed
greatest regular market from antiquity to the present
time. But Americus, in his second navigation, says, that he
found an unknown people of that continent, who sold him
above 54 pound weight for 40 ducats
97
. And Peter the Martyr
says, that Tunacca, one of the kings of that country,
seeing the great desire the Spaniards had for pearls, and the
value they set upon them, sent some of his own people in
search of them, who returning the fourth day, brought
with them 12 pounds of pearls, each pound 8 ounces. If
this is the case, America surely excells both Africa and Asia
in the quantity of this article.

228

The value of pearls depends upon size, regularity of
form, (for roundness is not always requisite) weight, smoothness,
colour, and the different shades of that colour. Suetonius
says, that CÃ¦sar gave to Servilia, Marcus Brutusâs mother,
a pearl worth about L. 50,000 of our money. And
Cleopatra, after vaunting to her lover, Mark Antony, that
she would give him a supper which should cost two hundred
and fifty-thousand pounds, for this purpose dissolved
one of the pearls which she carried in her ears, which amounted
to that price, and drank it. The other, it is said,
was carried afterwards to Rome by Augustus CÃ¦sar, sawn
in two, and put in the ears of Venus Genetrix.

The price of pearls has been always variable. Pliny seems
to have over-rated them much, when he says they are the
most valuable and excellent of all precious stones. He must
probably have had those just mentioned in his view, for
otherwise they cannot bear comparison with diamonds,
amethysts, rubies, or sapphires.

It has been observed to me by the pearl fishers in the
east, that when the shell is smooth and perfect, there they
have no expectation of a pearl, but are sure to find them
when the shell has begun to be distorted and deformed.
From this it would seem, as the fish turned older, the vessels
containing the juice for forming the shell, and keeping
it in its vigour, grew weak and ruptured; and thence, from
this juice accumulating in the fish, the pearl was formed,
and the shell brought to decay, perfectly in the manner, as
I have before said, supposed by M. Reamur.

229

In Scotland, especially to the northward, in all rivers running
from lakes, there are found mussels that have pearls
of more than ordinary merit, though seldom of large size.
I have purchased many hundreds, till lately the wearing of
real pearls coming into fashion, those of Scotland have increased
in price greatly beyond their value, and superior
often to the price of oriental ones when bought in the east.
The reason of this is a demand from London, where they
are actually employed in work, and sold as oriental. But
the excellency of all glass or paste manufactory, it is likely,
will keep the price of this article, and the demand for it
within bounds, when every lady has it in her power to wear
in her ears, for the price of sixpence, a pearl as beautiful in
colour, more elegant in form, lighter and easier to carry, and
as much bigger as she pleases, than those famous ones of
Cleopatra and Servilia. I shall only further observe, that the
same remark on the shell holds in Scotland as in the east.
The smooth and perfect mussel shell rarely produces a
pearl, the crooked and distorted shell seldom wants one.

I shall here mention a very elegant sort of manufactory,
with which I cannot positively say the ancients were acquainted,
which is fineering, or inlaying with the inside of
the shell called mother-of-pearl, known to the dealers in
trinkets all over Europe, and in particular brought to great
perfection at Jerusalem. That of Peninim, though the most
beautiful, is too fragil and thin to be employed in large
pieces. It is the nacre, or mother-of-pearl taken from the
Lulu el Berberi, or what is called Abyssinian oyster, principally
used in those fine works. Great quantities of this shell are
brought daily from the Red Sea to Jerusalem. Of these all

230

the fine works, the crucifixes, the wafer-boxes, and the beads,
are made, which are sent to the Spanish dominions in the
new world, and produce a return incomparably greater
than the staple of the greatest manufactory in the old.

Sir Joseph Banks shewed me a slip of paper which he got from an Italian gentleman,
made, if I remember, of a cyperus found in the river or lake of Thrasymene. I do not recollect
the process, but the paper itself was infinitely superior to any I had seen attempted, and
seemed to possess a great portion of flexibility, and was more likely to answer the purposes
of paper than even the old Egyptian, if it had been dressed up and finished.

It is to be observed here, it is the Greek text that calls it Basilisc. The Hebrew for
the most part calls it Tsepha, which are a species of serpents real and known. Our English
translation, very improperly, renders it Cockatrice; a fabulous animal, that never did
exist. I shall only further observe, that the basilisc, in scripture, would seem to be a
snake, not a viper, as there are frequent mention made of their eggs, as in Isaiah, chap. lix.
ver. 5. whereas, it is known to be the characteristic of the viper to bring forth living
young.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

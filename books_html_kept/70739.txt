Rev. William A. Sunday

(The Worldâs Famous Evangelist)

His Early Life, a Dramatic Portrayal of His
Conversion, and the Disintegration of the
Old White Stocking Baseball Team,
of Which He was a Member

Rev. âBillyâ Sunday (as he is familiarly known) was
born in a log cabin in the backwoods of Story County,
Iowa, November 19, 1862. Not long after his birth his
father went to the Civil War and never returned. Billy
remained home until he was about fourteen years of age,
and as a hired hand later lived with Colonel John Scott,
former Lieutenant Governor of Iowa, and was enabled
to acquire a high-school education. He tried various lines
of work, from a hired hand at sixteen years old to a furniture
polisher, driver of a hearse, member of a volunteer
hose company, railroad fireman, ball player, student and
now evangelist.

MR. SUNDAYâS REMARKABLE CONVERSION.

âTwenty-seven years ago I walked down a street in
Chicago in company with some ball players who were
famous in this worldâsome of them are dead nowâand
[10]

we went into a saloon. It was Sunday afternoon and we
got tanked up and then went and sat down on a corner.
I never go by that street without thanking God for saving
me. It was a vacant lot at that time. We sat down on a
curbing. Across the street a company of men and women
were playing on instrumentsâhorns, flutes and slide trombonesâand
the others were singing the gospel hymns
that I used to hear my mother sing back in the log cabin
in Iowa and back in the old church where I used to go
to Sunday school.

âAnd God painted on the canvas of my recollection
and memory a vivid picture of the scenes of other days
and other faces.â

âWONâT YOU COME?â

âMany have long since turned to dust. I sobbed and
sobbed and a young man stepped out and said: âWe are
going down to the Pacific Garden mission. Wonât you
come down to the mission? I am sure you will enjoy it.
You can hear drunkards tell how they have been saved
and girls tell how they have been saved from the red light
district. I arose and said to the boys: âIâm through.
Weâve come to the parting of the ways,â and I turned my
back on them. Some of them laughed and some of them
mocked me; one of them gave me encouragement; others
never said a word. Twenty-seven years ago I turned and
left that little group on the corner of State and Madison
streets, walked to the little mission, fell on my knees and
staggered out of sin and into the arms of the Saviour.

[11]

I went over to the west side of Chicago where I was
keeping company with a girl now my wife, Nell. I married
Nell. She was a Presbyterian, so I am a Presbyterian.
Had she been a Catholic, I would have been a
Catholicâbecause I was hot on the trail of Nell.

The next day I had to go out to the ball park and practice.
Every morning at 10 oâclock we had to be out there
and practice. I never slept that night. I was afraid of the
horse-laugh that the gang would give me because I had
taken my stand for Jesus Christ.

I walked down to the old ball grounds. I will never
forget it. I slipped my key into the wicket gate and the
first man to meet me after I got inside was Mike Kelley.

Up came Mike Kelley. He said: âBill Iâm proud of youâreligion
is not my long suit, but Iâll help you all I can.â
Up came Anson, Pfeffer, Clarkson, Flint, McCormick,
Burns, Williamson and Dalrymple. There wasnât a fellow
in that gang who knocked, every fellow had a word
of encouragement for me.

That afternoon we played the old Detroit club. We
were neck and neck for the championship. That club
had Thompson, Richardson, Rowe, Dunlap, Hanlon and
Bennett, and they could play ball. I was playing right
field and John G. Clarkson was pitching. He was as fine
pitcher as ever crawled into a uniform. There are some
pitchers today, OâToole, Bender, Wood, Mathewson, Johnson,
Marquard, but I do not believe any one of them
stood in the class with Clarkson.

[12]

We had two men out and they had a man on second
and one on third, and Bennett, their old catcher was at
the bat. Charley had three balls and two strikes on him.
Charley couldnât hit a high ball. I donât mean a Scotch
high-ball, but he could kill them when they went about
his knee.

I hollered to Clarkson and said: âOne more and we got
âem.â

You know every pitcher digs a hole in the ground where
he puts his foot when he is pitching. John stuck his foot
in the hole and he went clear to the ground. Oh, he could
make them dance. He could throw over-handed, and the
ball would go down and up like that. He is the only man
on earth I have seen do that. The ball would go by so
fast that a thermometer would drop two degrees. John
went clear down, and as he went to throw the ball his
right foot slipped, and the ball went low instead of high.

I saw Charley swing hard and heard the bat hit the
ball with a terrific blow. Bennett had smashed the ball
on the nose. I saw the ball rise in the air and knew it
was going clear over my head.

I could judge within ten feet of where the ball would
light. I turned my back to the ball and ran.

The field was crowded with people and I yelled: âStand
back!â and the crowd opened like the Red Sea opened for
the rod of Moses. I ran on, and as I ran I made a prayer; it
wasnât theological, either, I tell you. I said: âGod, if
you ever helped mortal man, help me to get that ball, and
you havenât got much time to make up your mind, either.â

[13]

I ran and jumped over the bench and stopped. I
thought I was close enough to catch it. I looked back
and saw it going over my head, and I jumped and shoved
my left hand out and the ball hit it and stuck. At the rate
I was going, the momentum carried me on and I fell under
the feet of a team of horses. I jumped up with the
ball in my hand. Up came Tom Johnson. He was afterwards
Mayor of Cleveland. âHere is $10.00 Bill; buy yourself
the best hat in Chicago. That catch won me $1,500.
Tomorrow go and buy yourself the best suit of clothes
you can find in Chicago.â

An old Methodist minister said to me a few years ago:
âWhy, William, you didnât take the $10.00 did you.â I
said: âYou bet I did.â

Listen! Mike Kelley was sold to Boston for $10,000.
Mike got half of the purchase price. He came up to me
and showed me a check for $5,000. John L. Sullivan
the champion fighter, went around with a subscription
paper and the boys raised over $12,000 to buy Mike a
house.

They gave Mike a deed to the house and they had
$1,500 left and gave him a certificate of deposit for that.
His salary for playing with Boston was $4,700 a year.
At the end of that season Mike had spent the $5,000
purchase price and the $5,000 he received as salary and
the $1,500 they gave him and had a mortgage on the
house. And when he died in Pennsylvania they went
around with a subscription to get money enough to put
[14]

him in the ground. Mike sat there on the corner with me
twenty-seven years ago, when I said: âGoodbye, boys,
Iâm through.â

A. G. Spalding signed up a team to go around the world.
I was the first man he asked to sign a contract and Captain
Anson was the second.

I was sliding to second base one day. I always slid
head first, and I hit a stone and cut a ligament loose in
my knee.

I got a doctor and had my leg fixed up and he said to
me: âWilliam, if you donât go on that trip I will give you
a good leg.â I obeyed and I have as good a leg today as
I ever had. They offered to wait for me at Honolulu and
Australia.

Spalding said: âMeet us in England, and play with us
through England, Scotland and Wales.â I didnât go.

Ed Williamson, our old short-stop, was a fellow weighing
225 pounds, and a more active man you never saw.
He went with them, and while they were on the ship
crossing the English channel a storm arose. The captain
thought the ship would go down. Then he dropped on
his knees and promised God to be true, and God spoke
and the waves were still. They came back to the United
States and Ed. came back to Chicago and started a saloon
on Dearborn Street.

I would go there and give tickets for the Y. M. C. A.
meetings and would talk with him, and would cry like a
baby, I would get down and pray for him. When he died
[15]

they put him on the table and cut him open and took out
his liver. It was so big it would not go in a candy bucket.

Ed Williamson sat there on the street corner with me
twenty-seven years ago when I said, âGoodbye, boys, Iâm
through.â

Frank Flint, our old catcher, who caught for nineteen
years, drew $3,200 a year on an average. He caught
before they had chest protectors and masks and gloves.
He caught bare-handed. Every bone in the ball of his
hand was broken. You never saw a hand like Frank
had. Every bone in his face was broken and his nose and
cheekbones, and the shoulder and ribs had all been
broken.

Iâve seen old Frank Flint sleeping on a table in a stale
beer joint and Iâve turned my pockets inside out and said:
âYouâre welcome to it, old pal.â

He drank on and on, and one day in winter he staggered
out of a stale beer joint and stood on a corner and was
seized with a fit of coughing.

The blood streamed out of his nose, his mouth and his
eyes. Down the street came a woman. She took one
look and said: âMy God, is it you, Frank?â And the old
love came back.

The wife called two policemen and a cab and started
with him to her boarding house. They broke all speed
regulations. She called five of the best physicians, and
they listened to the beating of his heartâeight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteenâand the doctor said:
[16]

âHe will be dead in about four hours.â She said: âFrank
the end is near,â and he said: âSend for Bill.â

They telephoned me and I came. When I reached his
bedside he said to me: âThereâs nothing in the life of
years ago I care for now. I can hear the grandstand
hiss when I strike out. I can hear the bleachers cheer
when I make a hit that wins the game, but there is nothing
that can help me now, and if the umpire calls me
out now, wonât you say a few words over me, Bill?â

He struggled as he had years ago on the diamond when
he tried to reach homeâbut the great Umpire of the universe
yelled: âYouâre out.â And the great gladiator of
the diamond was no more.

Frank Flint sat on the street corner drunk with me
twenty-seven years ago in Chicago when I said: âIâll
bid you goodbye, boys, Iâm going to Jesus.â Say men, did
I win the game of life, or did they?

BEACON LIGHTS ON BILLYâS TRAIL.

I owe God everything. I owe the devil nothing except
the best fight I can put up against him.

The church needs more of God and less dress and strife
over money.

Judas bought a ticket to hell for thirty pieces of silver,
and it wasnât a round-trip ticket, either.

Every saloon gives the devil a better chance to land
your boy in hell.

[17]

You breed more infidels with your âdivine philosophyâ
than all the Ingersols in the world.

The church doesnât need new members as much as she
needs to have the old bunch made over.

A lot of people, from the way they live, make you think
theyâve got a ticket to heaven on a Pullman parlor car,
and have ordered the porter to wake âem when they get
there. But theyâll get side-tracked almost before theyâre
started.

HARD TO KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN.

âSomebody says: âBut you donât know my circumstances,
Mr. Sunday. Iâm handicapped by my parents.
Iâm handicapped by poverty.â Listen! Go down tonight
and get down your books and read of the men of history
who have crept and crawled from the sewers of poverty
and the quagmires of squalor. Obscurity never kept Benjamin
Franklin walking the streets of Philadelphia gnawing
at his loaf. Obscurity didnât keep Edison working as
a telegraph operator at $60.00 a month. Obscurity didnât
keep David herding sheep. If gold and diamonds werenât
so hard to get they wouldnât be worth so much. Obscurity
didnât keep Grant in a tannery. Obscurity didnât keep
Garfield on the towpath of a canal. If youâve got it in
you, squalor and want canât keep you down.â

âIf you are going to win out you must have grit. That
means you must be able to say ânoâ when asked to do
[18]

wrong, so loud it will stagger hell. Or âyesâ so loud it
will gladden the angels of God. Put up your dukes and
fight the devil.â

HONOR YOUR WIFE BEFORE SHE DIES.

âDonât wait until your wife dies before you brag on her.
Tell her that coffee was fine. Tell her how you like those
biscuitsânot those big four-story ones, but the little flat
fellows with crust on both sidesâthatâs the kind I like.
Think of the days you bought her gumdrops and candy
hearts with reading on them. I wish I had all the money
Iâve spent on candy hearts with reading on them. Youâve
bought âem, too, you fellows, havenât you? Ha, ha! Thought
so! (Here Mr. Sunday recited the poem, âKiss Her.â)
Some fellows pet dogs more than they pet their wives.

âPlay with the children. You say, âBill, I havenât any.â
I say, âThen get some.ââ

TWO PICTURES OF AMERICAN HOMES.

I think one of the prettiest pictures ever looked upon
is to see a father with the religion of Jesus Christ in his
heart, and a mother with the religion of Jesus Christ in
her heart, and to see them throw their arms about their
eldest child, and the oldest child throw his arms about
their next oldest child, and that child take the next oldest
child by the hand, and on until the youngest and all
with happiness in their hearts and songs on their lips,
start for heaven.

[19]

And I think the blackest, darkest picture ever looked
upon is to see a father without the religion of Jesus Christ
in his heart, and a be-frizzled society woman without the
religion of Jesus Christ in her heart, and the next oldest
child, and on down until the baby in the cradle, and to
see that father and mother lock arms and all start to hell,
like many of them are doing today.

KIND WORDS TO HELP CHILDREN.

There are fewer things more important in the home
than conversation. Think of the good you can do in your
home with your voice. You use it to give pain, but the conversation
in your home ought to be loving. In many
homes they have no conversation. There is no affectionate
greeting in the morning when the children start for
school, no little kiss to linger on their lips, and when they
come home at noon, hungry, there is no kind greeting.
The old man never says a word unless he growls for you
to pass something, and so far as anyone would know, you
would be in a deaf and dumb asylum. No fireside chats
with the children.

You are down at some fool club, some lodge; you are
off to some literary social, beer and wine-drinking hell,
and you let your children go to the devil. You turn them
over to some nurse, whose only interest in the child is so
many dollars per week.

[20]

EVANGELIST PAYS TRIBUTE TO WIFE.

Sunday humorously complimented his wife at the tabernacle
meeting Thursday night. He quoted âBattlingâ
Nelsonâs statement that Mrs. Sunday was worth $10,000,000.00,
but said Bat had the estimate too low.

Sunday began by speaking of the traits of various nations.
âScotch bloodâ he said, âstands for persistency,
stick-to-it-iveness, faithfulness and bulldog tenacity. I
guess I ought to know, for Maâs full-blooded Scotch, and
I donât know what Iâd do without her.â

SEVERELY SCORES âSMART SETâ BUNCH.

And of the women in our âsmart setâ nowadays. Too
much can not be said in condemnation of them. Too
much time is spent by them outside of their homes. They
have thrown to the wind all womanly modesty and prudence.
They are flattered and cajoled, and they look upon
themselves as sort of an especial form upon which to
hang the latest creation of a Worth or a Redfern. They
have digestive apparatus with which to digest highly seasoned
foods which some rich husband can buy and cram
into their gullets. And they lend their presence to vaudeville,
and have vaudeville performances in their homes,
and their children are allowed to witness performances
which border on the obscene. And they indulge in gambling
to such an extent, poker, roulette wheels, champagne,
[21]

and all the whole long list, my friends, and they are more
familiar with poker chips and gambling devices and frivolity
than they are with their Bible, the English language
or classic literature.

âNo man lives to himself alone. When you go to hell
youâre going to drag someone else down with you, and if
you go to heaven youâre going to take someone else with
you. You say you hate sin. Of course you do if you have
respect. You never saw anyone in this town who hates
sin worse than I, or loves a sinner more than I. Iâm fighting
for the sinners. Iâm fighting to save your soul, just
as a doctor fights to save your life from a disease.â

âIf there is a father that hits the booze, he doesnât want
his son to. If he is keeping someone on the side, he
doesnât want his son to. In other words, you would not
want your son to live like you if you are not living right.â

âLook on the bright side. Every time you smile you
put a crimp in the undertakerâs business, keep the hearse
standing in the shed, keep the embalming fluid out of
your veins, and keep the quartet from singing âLead,
Kindly Light.ââ

[22]

SUNDAYâS BRIGHT WORD PICTURES IN HIS SERMON TO MOTHERS.

Father Gives up but Mother Doesnât.

âFathers often give up. The old man often goes to
boozing, becomes dissipated, takes a dose of poison and
commits suicide, but the mother will stand by the home
and keep the little band together if she has to manicure
her fingernails over a washboard to do it. If men had
half as much grit as the women, there would be different
stories written about a good many homes. Look at her
work! It is the greatest in the world; in its far-reaching
importance it is transcendently above everything in the
universeâher task in molding hearts and lives and shaping
character. If you want to find greatness, donât go
toward the throne; go to the cradle, and the nearer you
get to the cradle, the nearer to greatness. The launching
of a boy or girl to live for Christ is greater work than to
launch a battleship.â

BRAVEST BATTLE FOUGHT IN WORLD.

âThe bravest battle that ever was fought,

Shall I tell you where and when?

On the maps of the world youâll find it notâ

âTwas fought by the mothers of men.

âNay, not with cannon or battle shot.

With sword or nobler pen.

Nay, not with eloquent word or thought,

From mouths of wonderful men.
[23]

âBut deep in a walled up womanâs heartâ

Of woman that would not yield,

But bravely, silently bore her partâ

Lo, there is the battlefield.

âNo marshaling troops, no bivouac song,

No banner to gleam and wave;

But oh! these battles, they last so longâ

From babyhood to the grave.â

âThere is a mighty power in a motherâs kissâinspiration,
courage, hope, ambition. One kiss made Benjamin
West a painter, and the memory of it clung to him through
life. One kiss will drive away the fear in the dark and
make the little one brave. It will give strength where
there is weakness.â

ONE ACT, ONE WORD WILL BLIGHT CHILD.

âThere is power enough in a word or act to blight a
boy, and through him, curse a community. There is
power enough in a word or act to tincture the life of that
child so it will become a power to lift the world to Jesus
Christ. The mothers will put in motion influences that
will either touch heaven or hell. Talk about greatness!
Oh, you wait until you reach the mountains of eternity,
then read the mothersâ names in Godâs hall of fame, and
see who they have been in this world. I want to tell you
women, fooling away your time hugging and kissing a
poodle dog, caressing a Spitz, drinking a society bran
[24]

mash and a cocktail, and playing cards, is mighty small
business to moulding the life of a child.â

âWhen God gave the office of mother to women it was
just like giving you his own right hand. Think of what
importance is attached to it! Think of the motherâs
power! There is more power in a motherâs hand than in
a kingâs scepter.â

TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO MOTHERâS LOVE.

âI once read the story of an angel who stole out of
heaven and came to this world one bright sunshiny day;
roamed through the field, forest, city and hamlet, and as
the sun went down, plumed his wings for the return flight.
The angel said: âNow that my visit is over, before I return
I must gather some mementoes of my trip.â He looked at
the beautiful flowers in the garden and said, âHow lovely
and fragrant,â and plucked the rarest roses, made a bouquet,
and said, âI see nothing more beautiful and fragrant
than these flowers.â The angel looked further and saw
a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked child, and said, âThat baby
is prettier than the flowers; I will take that, too;â and,
looking beyond to the cradle, he saw a motherâs love pouring
out over her babe like a gushing spring, and the angel
said, âThe motherâs love is the prettiest thing I have seen;
I will take that too.â And with these three treasures the
heavenly messenger winged his flight to the pearly gates,
saying: âBefore I go in I must examine the mementoes of
[25]

my trip to the earth.â He looked at the flowers; they had
withered. He looked at the babyâs smile; it had faded.
He looked at the motherâs love; it shone in all its pristine
beauty. Then he threw away the withered flowers, cast
aside the faded smile, and with the motherâs love pressed
to his breast, swept through the gates into the city, shouting
that the only thing he had found that would retain its
fragrance from earth to heaven is a motherâs love.â

EVERY CHILD IS A TRUST TO MOTHER.

âEvery child is put in a motherâs arms as a trust from
God, and she has to answer to God for the way she deals
with that child. No mother on Godâs earth has any right
to raise her children for pleasure. She has no right to
send them to dancing school and haunts of sin. You have
no right to do those things that will curse your children.
That babe is put in your arms to train for the Lord. No
mother has any more right to raise her children for pleasure
than I have to pick your pockets or throw red pepper
in your eyes. She has no more right to do that than a
bank cashier has to rifle the vaults and take the savings
of the people. One of the worst sins you can commit is to
be unfaithful to your trust.â

âThe biggest place in the world is that which is being
filled by the people who are in close touch with youth.
Being a king, an emperor or a president is mighty small
business compared to being a mother, or the teacher of
[26]

children, whether in a public school or in a Sunday school,
and they fill places so great that there isnât an angel in
heaven that wouldnât be glad to give a bushel of diamonds
to boot to come down here and take their place. Commanding
an army is little more than sweeping a street
or pounding an anvil compared with the training of a
boy or girl.â

SAYS MEN ARE WHAT MOTHERS MAKE THEM.

âEmerson said: âMen are what their mothers make
them.â They are what their mothers make them, and if
the mothers of today were true to their trust, then they
could send their boys to college and need not be afraid
of them coming back infidels, like many of them do. There
is no power on earth that can lift to heaven or shove to
hell like the touch of a motherâs hand. Everywhere men
have been brought back from the valley of the shadow
of death simply by the touch of motherâs hand.â

SONGS OF MOTHER SWEETEST TO HEAR.

âThere is power in a motherâs song, too. Itâs the best
music the world ever heard. There is no brass band or
pipe organ that can hold a candle to motherâs song, the
kind she sings gets tangled up in your heart strings. There
would be a disappointment in the music of heaven to me
if there were no mothers there to sing. The song of an
angel or a seraph would not have much charm for me.
[27]

What would you care for an angelâs song if there is no
motherâs song? The song of a mother is sweeter than that
ever sung by minstrel or written by poet. Talk about
sonnets! You ought to hear the mother sing when her babe
is on her breast, when her heart is filled with emotion.
Her voice may not please an artist, but it will please any
one who has a heart in him. The songs that have moved
the world are not the songs written by the great masters.
I think when we reach heaven it will be found that some
of the best songs we will sing there will be those we
learned at motherâs knee.â

âThere is power in a motherâs love. A motherâs love
must be like Godâs love. How God could ever tell the
world that He loved it without a motherâs help has often
puzzled me. If the devils in hell ever turned pale, it was
the day when motherâs love flamed up for the first time in
a womanâs heart. If the devil ever got âcold feet,â it was
that day, in my judgment.â

âTo teach a child to love the truth and hate a lie, to love
purity and hate vice, is greater than inventing a flying
machine that will take you to the moon, or to the North
pole. Unconsciously, you set in motion influences that
will damn or bless the old universe and bring new worlds
out of chaos and transform them for God.â

[28]

GATHERING UP THE SUNBEAMS.

âIf we knew the baby fingers pressed against the window pane,

Would be cold and still tomorrow, never trouble us again,

Would the bright eyes of our darling catch the frown upon our brow?

Would the prints of little fingers vex us then as they do now?

Let us gather up the sunbeams lying all around our path,

Let us keep the wheat and roses, casting out the thorns and chaff!

We shall find our sweetest comforts in the blessings of today, and

With patient hand removing all the briers from our way.â

START CHILDREN RIGHT, ONLY SOLUTION.

âWhen God wants to throw a world out into space he
is much concerned about it. The first mile that world
takes settles its course for eternity. When God throws a
child out into the world he is mighty anxious that it gets
a right start. The Catholics are right when they say: âGive
us the children until they are ten years old, and we donât
care who has them after that.â The Catholics are not
losing any sleep about losing men and women from their
church membership. It is the only church that has ever
shown us the only sensible way to reach the massesâthat
is, by getting hold of the children. Thatâs the only way
on Godâs earth you will ever solve the problem of reaching
[29]

the masses. You get the boys and girls started right
and the devil will hang crepe on his door, bank his fires,
and hell will be âfor rent.â

âThere is power in a motherâs smile. See the boy, how
he will outdo himself if he knows his mother is watching
him, and it makes the hard places easy and the dark
places light. A long face and a gloomy look are about
the last things you ought to give to your children if you
want to inspire and cheer them.â

DANCING WORST OF AMUSEMENTS.

The dance is the hotbed of iniquity, and I denounce it
as the rottenest, most hellish, vice-producing institution
that ever wriggled from the depths of perdition.

The dance is simply a hugging match set to music.

Dancing is not an innocent amusement. It has caused
the downfall of more girls than anything else.

Three-fourths of the fallen women in big cities, fell because
of the dance.

Youâd just as soon husk corn by moonlight as to dance
with your own wife. Itâs the other fellowâs wife, some
other fellowâs sister that you want to dance with.

A man will wallow and get so low heâll have to climb
a hill to get into hell, then make a bluff at reforming and
society takes him in. Then at the dance heâll breathe
promises into the ears of some innocent young girl, gain
her confidence and then ruin her.

[30]

You say you need exercise and thatâs why you dance.
All right, then, let women dance with women, and men
with men.

The dance brings vice and virtue into such close contact
that virtue loses.

Any church that encourages dancing is too low down to
deserve the name of church.

If there are variations of hell, the dancer will crack
brimstone in the hottest spot.

If there was nothing but card players and dancers in
the church, how it would stink and rot!

DECLARES BALLROOM PERMITS LIBERTIES.

You grant men liberties on the ball room floor that if
any man attempted in your home and your husband
found you at it, he would have no trouble in securing a
divorce, and if he shot the man, no jury in the world
would convict him for it.

If I found any man hugging Mrs. Sunday as a man does
in a dance, Iâd clear for action like a battleship, and give
him HIS.

Where do you find your most accomplished dancers?
In the brothels.

When a girl gets so low that sheâll smoke and drink, she
is on the toboggan slide and going to hell fast.

[31]

And you fellows like to âsit outâ a dance. I always did
think it was a foolish proposition to gallop a mile to get
a hug.

The round and square dances look alike to me. It
doesnât take very long to cut the corners off.

There was a time in America when the stately cotillion
seemed to satisfy, but it is too slow now for the hot blood
of the Twentieth Century. The young people must have
something that will chase hurdles through their veins.

WHAT BILLY SAID ON MOTHERHOOD.

âI donât believe there is an angel in heaven that would
not come to earth and be honored with motherhood if
God would grant them that privilege. Like produces like
in animals and in human beings. Blood will tell in
horses, sheep, quadruped and in human beings. A consumptive
mother will produce a consumptive child, and
the same is true of its paternity. It is time to lay aside
mock modesty. You canât trifle with Godâs rules. Society
has just about put maternity out of fashion. When
you stop to consider the average society woman I do not
think maternity has lost anything. The child of affluence
is turned over to nurses at birth and is fed on prepared
foods and knows nothing of its mother. The children of
humbler homes are raised by their mothers, instead of
being turned over to governesses. These mothers spend
their time in bridge parties, gadding, and fondling pet
[32]

dogs; no wonder men go to the clubs. No man wants to
play second fiddle to a bow-legged bulldog. I am sure I
would not!â

TOO MANY GIRLS ARE NOT IN LOVE.

âThere are too many girls marry for other causes than
love. I think ambition, indolence, avarice, laziness and
indifference lead more girls to the altar than love. Girls
not actuated by the noblest of human feeling, but simply
willing to pay the price for a good time. They are not
moved by the nobler desires of manhood and womanhood.
Maternity is the highest possible gift of God to
woman. The up-to-date women pride themselves on
their criminal knowledge. Some girls marry for society,
some marry for home, some marry for ease, some marry
to reform man; he wouldnât marry you to reform youâyou
little fool. It is no easier to make a kingly husband
out of a beer-soaked, cigaret-smoking specimen of a man
than a prostitute can make a queenly wife.â

HIGH SPOTS IN BILLYâS SERMON TO WOMEN.

Up to Women to Save World.

âWoman lives on a higher plane morally than man. No
woman was ever ruined that some brute of a man did not
take the initiative. Women have kept themselves purer
than men. I believe a good woman is the best thing this
side of heaven, and a bad woman the worst thing this
side of hell. I think they rise higher and sink lower than
[33]

men. I think she is the purest on earth or the most degraded
on earth. Our homes are on the level with women.
Towns are on the level with homes. Nations are on the
level with towns. What our women are, the towns will
be. What the town is the men will be. The devil and
women can damn this world, and Jesus and women can
save this world. The womanhood of the world has to
settle the destiny of the world. I believe there is something
unfinished in the makeup of a girl with the absence
of religion. The average girl of today no longer looks
forward to motherhood as the crowning glory of womanhood.â

GIVES ADVICE ON PICKING A HUSBAND.

âSay, girls, donât simper and look silly when you speak
about love. There is nothing silly about it although some
folks are silly because they are in love; love is the noblest
and purest gift to man and womanhood. Donât let your
actions advertise âMan Wanted Quick.â That is the surest
way not to get a real one. You might get something
with pantaloons on, but that is not a man. Some men
should be arrested for going around and being disguised
as men. Donât get excited and try to hurry things along.
If the man wants you heâll come around in his good time;
and donât try to do half the courting. Donât bestow the
love that God gave you to bestow upon a baby on a poodle
dog. Dogs are all right in their places, but their place is
out in the kennel.â

[34]

DONâT LET GIRLS MARRY INFIDELS.

âDonât teach your girls,âmothers,âthat the only thing
in the world is to marry. A girl is a big fool to marry an
infidel. God says be ye not unequally yoked with unbelievers.
If she does she will have a hard life as sure as
she lives. The offsprings of such marriages either follow
in the footsteps of their father, and go to hell, or cling to
their mother and are sneered at all their life by their
father.â

âTHY KINGDOM COME.â

If you really pray âThy Kingdom Comeâ you will pray
with your hands, feet and money as well as with your
voice, every day.

Your religion should mean that youâre going to bring
about the conversion of the world before you sit down to
breakfast.

The minister who prays with a true appreciation of
âThy Kingdom Comeâ donât cater to the small highbrow
bunch of his church. He puts the cookies on the bottom
shelf.

The man who truly prays âThy Kingdom Comeâ wonât
slip coppers in the collection plate and then go home with
his head up singing âJesus Paid It All.â

When we really mean what we are praying, the old
devil wonât own an inch of this world. We wonât need
[35]

any penitentiary then, or jails or have any murders, or
young girls robbed of their womanhood.

God never meant anybody to offer up a prayer that was
measured in square miles.

Some people here are so busy singing about the streets
of glory that they forget to sweep the snow off their
own streets.

Talk about non-church goersâit makes me sick. Why
donât you talk about the non-going church?

The proof of the pudding is not found in smelling the
bag or chewing the strings. There are lots of church
members who only smell the bag and chew the rag.

Christianity must be a good thing or why would they
try to counterfeit it. You never heard of a counterfeit infidel.

The man who refuses to be a Christian because there
are hypocrites in the church is a fool.

You can find about everything in the ordinary church
from a humming bird to a turkey buzzard.

I could no more shock some of you fellows than I could
pour something on a skunk and make him smell good.

The inconsistency you talk about is in your life, not in
the Bible.

Talk to people on business and theyâll talk sense; talk
to them on religion and theyâll talk nonsense.

Christianity is the one thing that allows the angel to
take hold of you and strangle the animal in you.

[36]

HOT SHOTS ON CARDS AND GAMBLING.

If you have a deck of cards and a Bible in your home,
throw the deck in the alley. Either throw the cards out
and keep the Bible, or throw out the Bible and keep the
cards.

Whatâs the difference between a game of cards and a
game of checkers? Just as much difference as between
heaven and hell.

It is said nine-tenths of the gamblers are taught in their
homes by their mothers, and 80 per cent by Christian
people.

I believe that cards and dancing are doing more to
damn the spiritual life of the church than the grog-shops,
though you canât accuse me of being a friend of that stinking,
dirty, rotten, hell-soaked business.

I believe more people backslide on account of the social
side than on account of the saloon.

Lots of church members have cards on their tables as
often as food.

A billiard table is the first cousin to a saloon.

The saloonkeepers and gamblers laugh every time they
read the announcement of a euchre or card party in the
newspapers, for they know it will only be a question of
time until they get the players.

You have no right to find fault with the city officials
because they donât suppress gambling when it is carried
on right in your home.

[37]

WAITING FOR THE OPENING OF THE TABERNACLE.

[38]

[39]

EVANGELIST PUTS TABOO ON THEATER.

The theater, as conducted today, is one of the rottenest
institutions outside of hell.

It is upon the charred souls of women that most of the
men who are a power in the theatrical world have climbed
to their height.

The theater is corrupting, educationally, commercially
and morally.

It is almost impossible to find in the theater decency
and purity.

The church and the theater have nothing in common.

The only way to reform the theater is to turn it into
something else.

The rogue and scoundrelism and manâs infidelity form
the groundwork of most plays.

The day is long past when any number of serious-minded
citizens look to the theater for inspiration or instruction.

If it were not for the leg shows the theater would go
bankrupt.

Booth and Garrick would not allow their own children
to go to the theater.

Smiling religionâthatâs what we want.

The devil canât laughâpoor devil.

God enjoys a little fun. He made the parrot, donkey,
monkey and some of you folks.

The Lord wants the best; why canât he have it?

[40]

Some men are so rotten and vile they ought to be disinfected
and take a bath in carbolic acid and formaldehyde
every five minutes.

To see some people you would think that the essentials
of Christianity is to have a face so long you could eat oatmeal
out of a gas pipe. Religion is not cramp colic.

I want to lift the burden tonight from the heads of unoffending
womanhood and hurl it at the heads of offending
manhood.

Some people have just enough religion to give them
goosepimples. Get in the game. Some of you have just
enough religion to get to the edge of life but not faith
enough to plunge in.

Donât find fault with your physician until after you
have tried his remedy; donât find fault with God until you
have tried him.

I know some fellows here who are afraid to come to
the Tabernacle and do one thing decent before going to
Hell. I despise a religious coward.

Society takes no notice of sin at first; it waits for the
mute evidences of that sin.

BILLY PUTS TABOO ON WEDDING KNOTS.

Although an ordained minister, in all of his twenty-seven
yearsâ experience as an evangelist, Mr. Sunday has
united but one couple in marriage. And that, he declares,
he did very reluctantly.

[41]

In nearly every city where Billy has a campaign, he is
besieged by young men and young women who want him
to marry them. But Billy states that there is absolutely
nothing doing in that line. He has performed his first
and last marriage ceremony, and says he will stick to
plain evangelism, and leave the marrying part to other
ministers.

EVERY PALACE IS NOT A HOME.

âI have walked and ridden and driven over the hills
and through the valleys and looked at your beautiful
homes and your spacious lawns and your happy children;
you can build your palaces and amass your fortunes; your
sideboards can groan beneath the weight of gold and silver,
cut glass and hand-painted china; and you can let
your little ones play over your Brussels carpet or your
Persian or Axminster rugs; and you can have a retinue
of servants to wait upon you and do your bidding and
satisfy your slightest desire; and you can loll upon your
oriental divans and breathe the perfumed air and watch
the sparkling water as it spurts from fountains; and you
can look at your rare paintings and ransack Europe in
order to find the masterpieces; and you can lie there with
some one to fan you, and take your afternoon siesta; and
you can sit and gormandize upon all the viands that the
earth can produce; and your chef may be a Frenchman
whose ability would command a princely fortune even in
the homes of the crowned heads of Europe.

[42]

âBut, after all, if you sit behind the tapestry and look
out through the plate-glass and wait for the staggering
reeking, vomiting, spewing, drink-soaked, drunken sot of
a son, or you wait for the coming of the steps of a girl
who has lost her virtue, I tell you, all that wealth can
bring you will fly and you will think you are sitting in a
sepulchre and the rich furniture will simply become the
bones of other days and other faces, for nothing can make
happy the father or the mother who has a drunken sot of
a boy, as many of them have today, and nothing can make
happy the father or the mother of a girl who has sold her
womanhood for gain. And I tell you, not only should our
homes be the center of all that is pure, but all that is
cheerful and bright.â

DRAWING THE LINE ON CHRISTIANS.

Too many of you kneel at the communion table and
then beat down the wages of your employes so their children
go to bed hungry at night.

What God wants is workers and boosters; not knockers
and iconoclasts.

Every time a lazy man looks towards heaven, the
angels close the door.

It would be a Godsend if the church could smell a little
gunpowder. A little persecution would be a good thing to
get rid of the parasites and driftwood in the churches.

Enthusiasm for Jesus Christ is like the measles and
diphtheriaâitâs catching.

[43]

You sing âCalvary in Heaven,â and yet you put the
wrong figures on the ledger book; you profess brotherly
love, and yet slander your neighbor.

There is no use trying to build a revival on a bottle of
booze and on skullduggery and intrigue. Iâm just trying
to clear away the debris now.

A lot of people will wear out ten pair of holdbacks and
only one pair of tugs working for God.

Too many churches are frauds, four-flushers, excess
baggage and false alarms.

The dude who splutters and splurges and spends his
daddyâs dough, is the missing link between man and the
monkey.

You say religion causes insanity; I say youâre a liar!

You tell the doctor, who says you need beer for your
health that heâs a liar.

Knowledge is of no benefit unless you use it.

The world is being born into sin 20 to 1 faster than into
the spirit of God.

Religion doesnât make anybody mad; itâs hell that
makes men mad.

Any fool can criticise; it needs neither brains nor heart
to find fault.

Churches in New York City have 50,000 less members
today than a year ago.

All denominations are failing to reach the multitude.

Youâre either a patriot or a traitor to Godâs cause in this
revival.

[44]

The man with real red blood in his veins scorns the
path of roses our modern churches have made to accept
Christ.

Criticism is the scales on which you weigh yourself.

THE PREACHERS AND THE LAYMEN.

Lots of churches will sidestep the man with two dollars,
but who ever heard of a man with five hundred
thousands being turned out of church.

Lots of sermons today are nothing but a book review
with a little religion tacked on the end.

A poor sinner couldnât find Jesus Christ in some of the
churches with a searchlight.

Weâve got too many preachers breaking their necks,
trying to please the worldly gang that is going to increase
their salaries.

Nobody nowadays is afraid of God; the picture of Jesus
Christ is fading from the world; the word of God has been
discarded as being too crude for this enlightened age.

Many churches are nothing but social clearance houses.

There are lots of people in this city who would rather
have their friends go to hell than be saved by my preaching.

The best Christian will be the best citizen everywhere.

An employer is a thief if he takes advantage of his employe
by not paying him for the honest work he does;
[45]

the employe is a thief who does not give honest toil for
honest wages.

Public opinion is not always competent to judge
whether or not a man is worthy.

BELSHAZZARâS FEAST.

What the Bible says.

âBelshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand
of his lords and drank wine before the thousands.

âBelshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to
bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar
had taken out of the temple which was in
Jerusalem; that the king and his princes, his wives and
his concubines might drink therein.

âThey drank wine and praised the gods of gold, and of
silver, of brass, of iron, of wood and of stone.

âIn the same hour came forth fingers of a manâs hand
and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster
of the wall of the kingâs palace; and the king saw part of
the hand that wrote.

âThen the kingâs countenance was changed and his
thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were
loosed and his knees smote one against another.

âThe king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
Chaldeans and the soothsayers.

[46]

âThen came the kingâs wise men; but they could not
read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation
thereof.

âThen was Daniel brought before the king, and the king
said: âIf thou canst read the writing thou shalt be clothed
with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and
shalt be third ruler of the kingdom.â

âThen Daniel answered and said before the king, âLet
thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another;
yet I will read the writing and make known unto the king
the interpretation.â

âAnd this is the writing that was written: MENE, MENE,
TEKEL, UPHARSIN.â

BELSHAZZARâS FEAST.

âBillyâ Sundayâs Version.

Belshazzarâs feast was no common beer, pretzel and
dill pickle blow-out, but the real goods. Nude and lewd
women wormed and wriggled their way through the banquet
hall. The bunch began to get soused and the revelry
increased.

Then came the obscene song, the drunken hiccough, the
slavering lip, and the guffaw of idiotic laugh bursting
from the lips of princes, flushed, reeling and bloodshot,
while mingled with it all were the hurrahs for great Belshazzar.

Then from the atmosphere flashed an armless hand
which wrote upon the frieze in words that blazed like
[47]

fire and glistened like gold. Terror froze Belshazzar to
the very soul. His countenance changed, his thoughts
troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loose
and his knees smote together. I tell you old âBelâ was
about all in.

In a few moments he hoarsely cried: âBring in the astrologers,
the Chaldeans and the soothsayers (weâd call
âem mediums today). And in came the Magi and when
they couldnât decipher the heiroglyphics, Belshazzar
cried, âGive âem the hook.â

Then he sent for Daniel on his motherâs advice.

I can see him say: âPut her there Dan,â as he slapped
his hand in Danielâs, and say, âMy mawâs be tellinâ me
about you. This bunch has got on my nerves. The four-flushers
have been feedinâ and fatteninâ around here and
canât read that writing. If youâll do it Iâll give you a chain
and a ring of gold.â

But Daniel said: âNothinâ doing on the chain and ring
proposition, Bel.â Then Daniel read the writing. âMENE,
MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.â

A REMARKABLE PRAYER.

Sunday says Devil Growls when 10,000 Confess their Wrongs.

âOh, Jesus, isnât this a great spectacle? This must make
you smile, Jesus. I know it does me. And devil, this
sight must make you growl. I can hear you saying,
âWhatâs Bill Sunday doing up there? Look at that crowd
[48]

of 10,000 people standing because theyâre sorry they
broke any of Godâs commandments. Weâve got to get
busy or weâll lose thousands. Come on all you devils,
get out of hell. Get out I say.â

âAnd Jesus, Iâll bet all those devils are trembling when
they look up here, and Iâll bet all the angels in heaven
are rejoicing and shouting with joy. I can see mothers
and fathers up there saying, âGet back, Moses, get back
Solomon, get back David, you havenât got any children
down there. Let me look and see if my boy or girl is in
that audience. Yes, there she is down in section 27; yes,
there is my boy over by post 14; thank God for that.â

âAnd, oh, Jesus, if any preacher here tonight has got
cold feet, help him to stiffen up; give him backbone so he
can fight for you. And, Jesus, bless these preachers, thank
them for deepening the spirit here tonight. Bless all
newspaper boys who are giving us such wonderful reports.
Bless all in their offices that we met the other dayâall
of the clerks, stenographers, printers, pressmen and
from the men that own the papers down to the boys that
sell the papers on the street.

âAnd, Jesus, bless this choir, bless the ushers, bless the
Chief, the Mayor, the Governor, help the state officials,
Jesus. And bless this old state and this city and may we
have a rousing time here. Guide us and keep us for your
sake, Jesus, amen, amen, amen and amen. Good night.â

[49]

âHITTING THE SAWDUST TRAIL.â

The meaning âto hit the sawdust trail,â has a beautiful
and appropriate meaning. It was first used when Sunday
and his party were in the midst of a campaign among
the lumbermen on Puget Sound. At the tabernacle at
Bellingham, Washington. The floor of the tabernacle was
covered with the sawdust from the lumber camp and the
lumbermen, when any of their men went down front to
speak to Rev. Sunday, called it âHitting the Trail.â

In the lumber camps in the mountains there is a trail
that leads through the fastness of the wooded mountain
side covered by wood chips, so as to make it conspicuous
by night as well as by day. The woodsmen some time
wander far away from camp and are lost in the primeval
forest. In their wanderings, if they can âhit the trail,â
they are saved, as it leads to the safety and shelter of the
camp. So on the pathway of life if you can, âhit the
trail,â of Godâs mercy through the Lord Jesus Christ you
are led to safety. So these rude lumbermen called the
giving up of self to God and going down the sawdust
isle of the tabernacleââHitting the Trail.â

The phrase stuck to the Sunday party ever since and
it has a thrilling touch of the wildwood and a meaning
that is very appropriate and beautiful when taken in the
language of the backwoods.

[50]

TRYING TO SERVE GOD AND THE DEVIL.

It would almost be a blessing if a wave of scarlet fever
or small-pox could visit some city just after a revival and
sweep into heaven thousands who had been converted
before they were given a chance to backslide.

Lots of people never get any place to backslide from.

The man who keeps his store open on Sunday is an anarchist.
I donât mean the hotel man or the restaurant
proprietor, for some things are an absolute necessity.

You never saw a dancing, card-playing and theatre-gadding
church member that amounted to the snap of
your finger.

Belonging to a church wonât save you. A thief can be
a church member.

Thereâs too much playing tag with God, and hide-and-seek
with the devil nowadays.

Thereâs too much joining the church today and too little
joining Jesus.

Even preachers, elders, deacons and stewards may not
be members of the body of Christ, but merely church
members.

INCONSISTENT CHURCH MEMBERS.

Donât start a Christian life and compromise on a pack
of cards.

Religion is not for time, money, applause or politics,
but for God first, last and all the time.

[51]

There never was an honest draft from an honest heart
that was refused at the bank window of heaven.

If you worked for God as hard as you do for the devil,
you wouldnât be up against it.

If youâre a backslider, youâre a liar, a perjurer and
youâve broken your marriage vows with God.

Many men may be true to their business, to their lodge
and to their wives, but dirty liars to God.

You can graduate from the best university on Godâs
dirt and make a cold storage plant out of your brain, but
without Jesus you arenât worth a cent.

There is as much connection between some church
members and Jesus as there is between a wooden leg and
the man that wears it.

Life is just chuck full of half-done things.

CHRISTIANS CANâT LIVE DOUBLE LIVES.

It donât make any difference with God whether the one
who sins wears a coat or petticoat; plug hat or a hairpin.

This double-standard business is the curse of humanity
today. God demands the same standard of purity in man
as he does in woman.

There are a lot of lobsters here tonight who, if their
wives lived the lives they did, would be down at the court
house whining for divorces tomorrow morning.

[52]

You canât cut the week up into seven parts, call six
secular and one Sunday when you go to church and listen
to a little sermonette, and expect to be saved.

You are a blackguard liar when you say every man
and woman have a price. Most men are honest; most
women are virtuous. Itâs the dishonest man and the
woman with no virtue that are in the minority.

Lots of people start on a royal race in life, but compromise
at the finish in a mouse hole.

A HIGH TRIBUTE TO THE CHRISTIAN CHARACTER OF GEN. LEE.

Billy Sunday paid the following tribute to the Christian
character of General Robert E. Lee, commander of the
Confederate forces in the Civil War:

âThere is no man I so delight to honor as the man who
is true. There is no woman I so delight to honor as the
woman who is true. There is no one I so abhor as a man
or woman whose words are untruth and whose promises
are as vapor. I may differ from a man in politics or religion,
and if he is living up to his highest ideals, even if
I think those ideals wrong, I respect him and I will do
my best to clear up his errors and lead him to the sunlit
hills of Godâs pardon.

âAt the beginning of the Civil War General Robert E.
Lee said to General Scott that he was a Union man at
heart, but that his native state of Virginia had seceded
[53]

and that as a loyal son he felt he must cast his fortunes
with the Confederacy. As the war proceeded, Lee saw the
bright hopes of the Confederacy fade, saw its government
overturned and broken at his feet. When the end
came he was a prematurely old man, his health fled, his
fortune gone, his property at Arlington confiscated. At
that time of despair there came to him the officers of the
Louisiana Lottery company, offering to make him its
president.

ââBut, gentlemen,â he said, âI donât know anything about
the lottery business.â

ââThat makes no difference,â they said, âwe do. We
want the use of your name, and we will give you $10,000
a year.â

âGeneral Lee buttoned his coat over his sunken breast,
brushed back his gray hair from his forehead, and said:
âGentlemen, my good name and my self respect are all
that is saved from the wreck, and they are not for sale.
You cannot buy Robert E. Lee.â

âMy father was a Union soldier. I am a loyal American,
but I say that Robert E. Lee was one of the noblest
Christian characters this country has ever produced, and
that Stonewall Jackson was another.â

EXPOSES FALSEHOOD OF âGRAFTâ STORIES.

Billy Sunday takes frequent raps at those who knock
him and accuse him of grafting. Wednesday night he
became reminiscent for a few minutes and referred to his
[54]

turning down big offers from baseball teams, to become
a Y. M. C. A. secretary.

âWhen I turned down offers of $500.00 and even $1,000
a month from ball teams, to make $83.00 as a Y. M.
C. A. secretary, they never called me a grafter, and in
those days we were up against hard times,â he said. âFor
six months I got no salary; I went hungry at noon and
walked to and from work to save car fare.

âThen thereâs another lie they tell about me and it is
that I own a saloon in Chicago. I donât know what all
they tell about me, but I do not and never did own a
single piece of property in Chicago.â

WOMEN HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS MEN.

âGod has marked out the same path for men and for
women to follow. Away with the hellish doctrine of a
double standard of living in this twentieth century. It
makes no difference whether the one who sins wears a
plug hat or a petticoat. Young fellow, your sister has as
good a right to live as you do, as you have. She has as
good a right to walk up street smoking a cigaret as you
have. Your wife has as good a right to line up before a
bar and put 10 beers under her belt as you have. She has
as good a right to go to the corner grocery in the evening
and sit around and put her feet up on the stove and settle
the questions of the day, as you have. She has as good a
right as you have to walk down street with a half a plug
[55]

of Lorillardâs sticking out of her mouth and spit enough
to drown a jackrabbit as you have. I wouldnât clean out
your old spittoon for you. Iâd throw it at your old head.
Yes, sir. Mop up your own slop, you old hog.â

[56]

WHEN THE TABERNACLE SERVICES ARE OVER.

[57]

SAYS BACKSLIDERS LIKE GROUNDHOGS.

âThe invitation is never given at a revival but there are
those who will respond to it and for a time will live as
Christians should. Then, when the revival is over and
the routine of everyday life begins, they slip gradually
back into their former ways. They are like the groundhog.
When spring comes the groundhog awakes from his
winterâs sleep and emerges into the sunlight and lives an
active life until the storms of winter come again. Then he
crawls into his hole of hibernation and falls into a sleep
of months. Oh, it is easy to think of things divine when
the revival is on and there is inspiration on every side
and the bands are playing and the crowds are marching.
These groundhog people have family prayer then, and
they attend to their religious duties faithfully, but when
the revival is over they begin to relapse into their old
ways.â

TRUE TO LODGE; FALSE TO CHRIST.

âThey tell me a lodge man will share his last dollar
with a needy person, die for the widow or the orphan,
put his head on the track ahead of the Twentieth Century
Limited or allow himself to be shot to pieces before
[58]

he would be false to the vows he took amid the scent of
the orange blossoms. That sounds like a good man; but
there are lots of men who will be true in all these things,
and false to Jesus Christ. They will go to church and
partake of the communion, then will go out and line up
in front of some bar or tell smutty stories. True in business,
true in society, true in the home, but a perjurer in
the sight of God. If you are such a man you are a backsliderâa
backslider, sir, and a liar.â

âGirls, you are a fool if you will walk along the street
with a fellow who smokes a cigaret as he walks with you.
He wouldnât walk with you if you smoked one.â

SUNDAY ADVISES SOCIETY WOMEN TO SAVE SOULS.

âNo doubt you women have a retinue of servants and
havenât dirtied your hands in dishwater for so long that
you have forgotten how it feels. But you have souls to
save, and donât wait until just before the undertaker
backs up to your door.â

Mr. Sunday took Van Dykeâs sketch, âThe Lost Word,â
as a theme for his talk. He related how Hermas, the
pagan, after accepting Christianity for several years,
grew tired of it and sold the Word of Jesus for gold, pleasure
and worldly success. He demonstrated to the club
women that, if they had ever known Jesus, they could
read their heartâs biography.

[59]

âWithout that word you are nonentities!â said Sunday,
âWithout that word you are lost. And you canât find it
in society. Do as society wants you to do, and you will
not be doing as Jesus wants you to do. If ease, comfort,
luxury and the chasing of the phantoms of pleasure have
led you away from the old landmarks and moorings, get
back, my friends, get back.â

The man that bucks the jackpot until 3 oâclock in the
morning is just as good as the church member that plays
for a prize.

Thereâs nothing too hard for God.

If your heart is full of sin youâll never be satisfied until
you get others to sin likewise.

Bad as is physical leprosy, moral leprosy is ten thousand
times worse.

Suppose every young man in the city who is a moral
leper were compelled and impelled by some uncontrollable
impulse to make public the sins youâve committed.

Thereâs a day of judgment coming when God will peel
off the bark and find many full of wormholes.

Suppose all had glass doors in our hearts. I think we
would want stained glass windows, heavy tapestry and
thick curtains.

God never made Hell for man. God made Hell for the
devil. If you follow the devil you must go to the abode
of the devil.

You may live in the most beautiful house and the world
passes by your door not knowing of the sadness and sorrow
[60]

within. But it will out. If the world never finds it
out, itâll meet you at the throne of God.

Itâs the men of means, wealth and leisure that support
dens of vice.

The devil will let you have an easy time until God asks
you to do personal work.

Some people think it is beneath their dignity to do personal
work for God.

If it is beneath your dignity to do personal work, then
you are above Christ.

If you havenât got religion enough to smile, thereâs a
leak in your fountain.

I pity that boy or that girl who has no incentive from a
father or mother to be a Christian.

Sissy, that fellow wouldnât go with you to reform you.

Those most likely to be affected by your sins are those
nearest and dearest to you.

Society needs a new division of anathemas. Stop hurling
your anathemas at that girl and hurl them at that
fellow.

If we only knew the secrets in the hearts and lives of a
great many we envy, we would be filled with sadness and
sorrow.

I wish to God the church were as afraid of imperfection
as it is of perfection.

If the saloon is no place for a boy itâs no place for a
man either. Youâll get whatâs coming to you, too, before
Iâm through if you stand with that damnable bunch.

[61]

I had to say no to fifteen or twenty cities to come here.

The curse of the church is not so much sins of commission
as sins of omission.

Two things I try to doâstrengthen the faith and clarify
the vision of those that believe; help bring the unsaved to
Christ.

Nobody begins to live until they become a Christian.
Youâre not ready to die unless youâre ready to live.

You can learn something from some politiciansâenergy
and organization.

It wonât be long until the entire State of Iowa is cleared
of the liquor traffic. Only twenty counties remain wet
and these are going dry with a rapidity almost dazzling.

Itâs hard for you to teach the baby how to walk; itâs
harder for the baby to learn how to walk.

I never saw a revival movement yet until Godâs people
fell on their knees and renewed their vows of Christianity.

Personal work is a difficult form of work; more difficult
than preachings, singing, attending conventions.

Some things must be faultless to be valuable.

Love is the greatest thing in the world; character the
grandest.

You can bury a man, but his character will beat the
hearse back from the graveyard.

Donât your hearts say, you must forsake sin before you
can expect pardon?

[62]

I will preach with all the power I have against sin, but
I will never âbawlâ a man out.

God is doing His best to keep men out of hell; men are
doing their best to get into hell.

God cannot and will not put the good and bad in the
same place.

What did Jesus ever do that was not for the good of
humanity?

Jesus Christ never preached a funeral sermon; that
was out of his line.

If you are in favor of something Jesus is against, then
he does not want you.

Jesus Christ is against all wrong. Are you?

Jesus stands for a square deal all around.

Are you against the saloon? Jesus Christ is.

Jesus Christ was the bravest man who ever lived. I
am tired of hearing him referred to as a dough-faced
person.

Something is expected of a Godless person that is not
of a sinner.

I do not care a rap for your claps or applause unless
your acts take the form of living your Christianity.

Without faith there would not be a factory or a bank
here.

Nothing was ever accomplished without men first believing
something.

The man who is a Christian has life more abundantly
than an infidel.

Christ turned houses of mourning into houses of joy.

[63]

You act as though you had reached the apex and written
âfinisâ after everything you do. We havenât learned
the a b câs of what is yet to come in this old world.

Thereâs a law of gravitation in character as well as in
matter.

A saloonkeeper does not enjoy a prayer meeting.

With everything wicked men can do today they try to
check religion. Yet religion never will be stopped. You
might as well try to dam Niagara Falls with toothpicks.

For twenty-seven and a half years I have been a Christian.
I defy the devil or anyone else on earth or in hell
to prove that I donât live what I preach.

A motorman might as well try to run his car up yonder
hill by blowing his breath against the front vestibule as
to expect salvation without Jesus Christ.

You canât stop religion by making fun of it.

If itâs wrong for me to hit the booze, itâs wrong for you.

God says, if you give me a chance, old man, I can make
you sober and keep you sober.

Take out of this town what Christianity has done for it
and its real estate would not be worth ten cents by Christmas.

Do not be deluded to believing that all you need is sincerity
of thought. A man may believe he can handle
nitro-glycerine with impunity, but if he does he will be
slivered into atoms.

I know Jesus made good with me. Has he with you?

[64]

Wherever Jesusâ teachings have gone joy has followed.

Jesus Christ has crowned womanhood and placed garlands
on her head.

Some men bequeath disease and cravings for drink to
their children.

If Paul and Silas had looked as gloomy as some of you
coming to the Tabernacle that man in jail would not be
liberated yet.

Jesus bled and died to save you. Whosoever will.

I am traveling to heaven according to a time-card, the
gospel schedule.

[65]

BILLY SUNDAY AT THE AGES OF 14 AND 18 YEARS.

[66]

CONSOLATION FOR THE OLD MAIDS.

âTake this from Uncle Fuller: âDonât worry if you
donât marry, there are worse things in the world than
being an old maid, and one of them is marrying the wrong
man. Love is the divinest gift of God to man and woman.
Some of the noblest women in the world have been old
maids; they are not old maids, simply ladies-in-waiting,
but I tell you girls I would rather be an old maid, with
dogs, cats, furniture and bric-a-brac than to be yoked to
a profane, cigaret smoking, cursing, whisky-soaked, jug-handle
for a husband.ââ

TAKES RAP AT GIRLS WHO FLIRT.

âI wish I could make a girl that flirts see herself as
others see her. If you make eyes at a man on the street he
will pay you back. It means that if you donât care any
[67]

more than that for yourself why should he? It takes a
whole lot of nerve for a fellow to look a girl in the face and
say: âWill you be my wife and partner and help me fight
the battle during life?â But I think it means a whole lot
more to the girl who has to answer and fight that question;
but the fool girl loafs around, waits to be chosen
and takes the first chance she gets and seems to think that
if they get made one the laws of man can make them two
again. The divorce laws are damnable and pernicious.â

DRINKING AND MATRIMONY.

No man ever intended being a drunkard. He started
out a moderate drinker.

If any young buck would come and ask to take my
daughter out on a midnight joy ride, so help me God, I
certainly would land on him.

If these automobiles and carriages could talk, thereâd
be something doing.

The reason weâve got so many little whip-poor-will
widows nowadays is that they married men to reform
them.

Girls, you sell yourselves too cheap. Youâll keep company
with some miserable young buck whoâll dodge into
a doorway so as not to be embarrassed by the look of
recognition from some fallen woman on the street, just
to have âsteadyâ company.

[68]

SAYS SOCIETY TO BLAME FOR SINNERS.

I say, you card playing women for little prizes such as
a dinky cream pitcher or pair of silk hose (maybe youâve
got âem on now) are responsible for many of the gamblers,
because you started âem.

The purer life for men and women will never come till
the girls raise the standard of their company. Then weâll
clean up some of these young bucks around town.

I believe the man who will seduce an innocent young
girl and sell her into a life of shame, ought to be shot on
the spot.

Society takes no notice of an innocent flirtation. It
waits till the mute evidence of a girlâs downfall cannot be
concealed, then gasps in horror and turns her out.

Society is responsible for the sins of those you saw
starting toward hell and didnât warn âem.

Societyâs to blame for many a blithering drunkard, for
starting him drinking at a fashionable party.

SOME EXTRA SHOTS TO THE OUTFIELD.

If I can send one girl from the red light back to home,
mother and God, then Iâll be repaid for having stood all
your bitter raillery and your mockery. Mock you old
devil, mock.

Gehazi was the first grafter mentioned in the Bible.

If by some power I could yank a string and pull from
you all the clothes you are wearing that are not paid for,
[69]

some of you would have left only a celluloid collar and
pair of socks.

Many a fool today, when told what to do to keep out
of hell, gets mad at God.

Some fellows are so rotten that they ought to be disinfected
for two years and then given a bath in carbolic
acid and formaldehyde before they should be allowed to
speak to a decent woman.

Christian Scientists, I notice, always answer the call
for dinner just as quick as I do.

Donât condemn your doctor until you try his remedies.

The devilâs no fool. If you get to playing tag with him
heâll touch you on the shoulder, say âtag, youâre it,â and
get your goat. Heâs never idle. He never gets the rheumatiz,
peritonitis, gout or appendicitis.

BILLYâS SKETCH OF LEPER BATHING IN JORDAN.

Billy Sundayâs impersonation of the leper Naaman,
entering the waters of the Jordan river to dip seven times,
given Thursday night in his sermon on âThe Moral
Leper,â in the language of the vaudeville press agent,
was a âbell-ringer.â

Billy, in the role of Naaman, made things so realistic
that his vast audience could almost expand their imagination
enough to see the muddy waters of the river, the
slippery bank and the frightened and shivering Naaman,
[70]

endeavoring to bolster up enough courage to plunge in
and take his seven dips to be cured of leprosy.

Billy cautiously approached the waterâs edge, stuck one
toe in to ascertain the temperature of the water, drew it
back with a shiver and an âU-u-gh, but thatâs cold!â Then
he stopped to explain that Naaman was not accustomed
to such surroundings, but was used to a porcelain bath
tub at home and to a âcrooked-handle dingaramusâ to
rub his back with. With this Billy went through the contortions
of a man trying to reach the hollow of his back
with a brush or sponge.

SAYS WATER MADE NAAMAN SHIVER.

He told of a big âsnake doctorâ stinging Naaman on the
shoulder, emitting an unearthly screech and slapping one
hand to the offended spot. Then he tried the water again.
He got part way in, slipped, stubbed his toe and went hobbling
about on his left foot, holding the other in both
hands as his facial contortions told of Naamanâs pain
after getting hurt. He shivered again, let his teeth chatter
with a loud âb-r-r-r,â as he again went into the water,
pinched his nose shut after taking a long breath, squinted
his eyes and âduckedâ under the surface, coming up spluttering,
spitting and choking.

Then Billy told of the spots of leprosy on Naaman beginning
to itch. He nearly had every one in the tabernacle
scratching arms and legs as he vigorously rubbed
[71]

various spots on his body, and scratched âem. Then he
resumed his ducking stunt. After the seventh dip, he told
of Naamanâs flesh being covered with the delicate skin
of a babe and of him emerging from the river no longer
a leper. Here Sunday ended his monologue with the exclamation,
âGee, wonder what Mrs. Naaman and the kids
will say when I come home and they see me cured.â

SNAPSHOTS FROM SUNDAYâS SERMONS.

God never owned a slave. All the service you render
for God is or should be prompted by gratitude.

Itâs hell and damnation that put men and women in the
asylums and jails.

If my vehemence and exertions amaze you, your apathy
and laziness stagger me.

If God could get possession of all the flesh and blood
that belongs to Him, He could create a commotion in
this city in 48 hours.

Some people work only with their mouths. But God
wants that part of you thatâs on the ground as well as in
the air.

Christianity and red whiskey donât stay in the same
hide together.

Bill Shakespeare was onto his job when he said âWhat
fools these mortals be.â

The Lordâs having just as bad a time today with the
folks here as with the old Jews out there in the wilderness.

[72]

It gives me prostration to see how some people do
things in this world. Itâs no wonder the devilâs got a
mortgage on the world and is about ready to foreclose it.

Some churches have 500 in the congregation and about
25 turn out at prayer meeting. Where are the other 475?
They have just as much right to be there as the 25.

Faith is like a headlight on a train.

I donât believe one-half the people in the churches were
ever converted or had an experience.

I believe in experimental religion.

Faith is above all other graces; it honors God and
brings blessings to the individual.

The average preacher donât pray much more than five
minutes each day; the average churchgoer not more than
three minutes.

If we got what was coming to usâitâd be Hell for all of
us.

A TRIP THROUGH THE BIBLE WITH BILLY SUNDAY.

An Example of the Evangelistâs Power in Painting Word Pictures.

Twenty-seven years ago with the Holy Spirit as my
guide, I entered at the portico of Geneses and went into
the art gallery of the Old Testament, where, on the wall,
hung pictures of Enoch, Noah, Jacob, Abraham, Elijah,
David, Daniel and other famous prophets of old. Then
I passed into the music room of the Psalms, where the
[73]

spirit swept the keyboard of my nature and brought forth
the dirgeâlike a wail of the weeping prophet, Jeremiah,
to the grand exultant strain of the 24th Psalm and where
every reed and pipe in Godâs great organ of nature seemed
to respond to the tuneful harp of David, as he played for
King Saul in his melancholy moods.

Next I passed into the business office of Proverbs, then
into the chapel of Ecclesiastes, where the voice
of the preacher was heard; then over into the conservatory
of the songs of Solomon, where the Lily of the Valley
and the Rose of Sharon and sweet-scented spices perfumed
my life. Then I stepped into the prophetic room
and saw through telescopes various stars, some pointing
to far-off stars and others to nearby stars, but all concentrated
upon the bright and Morning Star which was to
rise above the moon-lit hills of Judea, while shepherds
guarded their flock by night.

From there I passed into the audience room and
caught a vision of the King from the standpoint of Matthew,
Mark, Luke and John. I then went into the Acts of
the Apostles, where the Holy Spirit was doing office work in
the formation of the Infant Church. From here I went to
the correspondence room where Matthew, Mark, Luke,
John, Paul, Peter, James and Judah sat at their desks,
penning their epistles to the church. Then I passed last
of all into the throne room of Revelations and the king
sitting high upon his throne.

[74]

DEFENDS DIVINE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE.

If the Bible were the dreams of men, it would have
gone down long ago. But it still stands like a light-house,
shining out into the darkness, surrounded by thousands
of dead birds, which have battered their brains out,
knocking it.

The biggest fool today is the man who sneers at the
word of God.

Godâs word canât be overthrown. It is too hard for the
tooth of time and will last forever.

Godâs plan in the beginning was that man should never
die and that no man should ever work. Now, because
of sin, white or black, Christian or skeptic, civilized or
savage, itâs work for you or over the hills to the poor
house.

You can say, if you want to, that your great-great-great-great-grandfather
was a monkey with a prehensile tail,
playing in the back alley, all right, but you canât connect
me with your monkey ancestors.

Why is it that corn that is fed to chickens makes
feathers; that fed to sheep makes wool; that fed to the
cow makes milk, and that which you eat goes into brain?

The men who undertake to overthrow the Bible will
find the biggest job they ever had on their hands, and a
lot of these lobsters have already gone to the mat for the
count.

Donât you feel like brutes; donât you feel lower than
snakes when you raise you voice against the Bible and
[75]

this campaign, which is working for the influence of
Christianity?

You can take all the books of all ages and nations,
and take out all that is good and noble in them, and
you canât produce a book which will touch the hem of the
Bible, which, is the word of God.

SPIRITUALISM ON THE GRILL.

Spiritualism is of the devil, pure and simple. I have no
quarrel with you if youâre a spiritualist, but I have with
that damnable doctrine.

Spiritualism is as old as the Egyptian mummies or the
sphinx. It had long, gray hair and walked on crutches of
decrepitude before Athens or Rome had a single mud hut
or Romulus and Remus had been nourished by the wolf.
It cannot work in the light, but needs darkness, because
its deeds are evil. I never knew a confirmed spiritualist
who had a normal physical body. Their religion is unclean.
Christian science is the worst tommyrot since the
Third Century.

STRAIGHT SHOTS FROM THE SHOULDER.

Bryan, clean as a houndâs toothâheâs a friend of mine,
tooâisnât afraid to put a Bible under his arm and preach
the word of God.

The churches used to be daffy over high-critic preachers.
Nowadays your high-critic preachers are wearing
[76]

out shoe leather and going blind reading the want columns,
trying to find jobs.

Down in Georgia they were having a dress ball. Huh!
Better call it an undress ball.

Religion will do more for the world than it is now, as
soon as God gets more than dimes and nickles to work
with.

Some ministers are as crazy after sensation as the âyellowestâ
newspaper that ever came off the press.

Some of you society women are so stuck-up with pride
that you canât lie straight in bed at night.

These long-winded prayers will never get anything for
Christ.

In nearly every church there is a little bunch that prays
and all the rest are going to the devil.

What Shakespeare says is âliteratwah,â but what Bill
Sunday says is âvulgwah.â

The worst thing that ever wriggled out of hell is a
church scrap.

I believe that some time in the life of every man and
woman there will come a time when they will pray.

âIâd like to see the day,â said Sunday, âwhen there
wouldnât be a store open on Saturday night. I canât see
to save my gizzard why itâs necessary. People can do
their shopping early. If theyâd close the stores Saturday
evening the same as on other days, the church attendances
would be doubled. But of course, when you do
[77]

anything to help humanity, some yellow dog has got to
block it. And you employers and proprietors sit around
in the churches and wonder why the attendance is so
small, when youâre to blame yourself by making your employes
work themselves to death so that they are too tired
to go to church.â

[78]

BILLY SUNDAY AT THE AGES OF 20 AND 22 YEARS.

[79]

OTHERS SUFFER FROM YOUR SINS.

âWhen you come staggering home, cussing right and
left and spewing and spitting, your wife suffers, your children
suffer, you infernal old devil. Donât think that you
are the only one that suffers. Youâre placing a stain on
your wife and your children. If youâre a dirty, low-down,
filthy, drunken, whisky-soaked bum youâll affect all with
whom you come in contact. If youâre a God-fearing man
you will influence all with whom you come in contact.
You canât live by yourself.

âPersonal liberty is not personal license. Our forefathers
did not fight and die for personal license, but for
personal liberty bounded by laws. Personal license is
the liberty of a red-handed anarchist. Personal license
is the liberty of a burglar, of a seducer, of a raper, of a
wolf that wants to remain in a sheep fold, or the fox in a
henroost.â

[80]

LESSONS FROM STORY OF PILATE.

Pilate was a pliable, plastic, rathole, stand pat, peanut,
lunch counter politician of his day.

Pilate sent Jesus to an innocent death to please the machine
politicians.

Away with your hell-born, stinking lie of Unitarianism
that Jesus was not a good man. He was either the Son
of God or a fraud and liar, and I believe Him to be the
Son of God.

God keeps no half-way house. Itâs either heaven or hell
for everyone.

A millionaire will go to hell just as fast as a hobo counting
the ties on a railroad, if he doesnât live true to God.

I challenge all the infidels on the earth to find one flaw
in the character of Jesus Christ.

Even if Jesus wasnât the Son of God I would worship
Him anyway, for he is my ideal. I canât conceive a
grander character.

MORAL TRUTHS BILLY GAVE TO MEN.

Lyman Beecher was the father of more brain than any
other man.

Itâs everybodyâs business how you live.

Law stands between you and personal liberty.

I brand that man with a black brand whose iniquities
are responsible for the fall of others.

[81]

No man lives to himself alone.

No man will argue that sin is a good thing.

It doesnât take boys long to get on the wrong track.

There are little frizzled top sissies who know more
about vice than their gray-haired grandmothers.

As a rule a man wants something better for his children
than he had himself.

You would not want your son to live like you, if you
are not living right.

A young buck that cusses will crush your daughterâs
honor like he would an eggshell.

If you never become religious, men, for Godâs sake stop
your cussing.

Like produces like in everything.... Blood
will tell.

SAYS THESE THREE WILL RUIN CITY.

âNo man can be a good husband, no man can be a good
father, no man can be a respectable citizen, no man can
be a gentleman, and cuss. You can hang out a sign of
gentleman, but when you cuss you might as well take it in.

âThere are three things which will ruin any town, open
license saloons, open stores on the Sabbath day and a
dirty, cussing, swearing gang of blacklegs on the streets.
Let a town be known for these three things, and these
alone, and you could never start a boom half big enough
to get one man there.â

[82]

âYou canât go anywhere any more, in a car, a depot, a
restaurant, but what you find some fiend with his foul-mouthed
oaths ready to spew them out. What an awful
place hell will be when it gets all of that bunch down
there.â

âSay, boys, if I was on a jury and you could prove to me
that a father had stolen a loaf of bread to keep his wife
from starving, you could keep me in the room until the
ants took me out through the keyhole before Iâd stick
him. That may not be law, I donât know, but youâll find
there is a big streak of humanity in Bill.â

DO GODâS WILL.

He told the women that it was not sufficient to be familiar
with all the poets and the books of etiquette to get
into heaven. The one essential thing is the doing of the
will of God, he said.

Mr. Sunday showed through the story of Lady Anne
Erskine of Rome, how the devil and Christ are bidding
for their soulsâthe devil offering beauty, pleasure, adulation
and ease; Jesus promising peace, joy and eternal
happinessâand it was left to them to choose.

BILLYâS KEYS TO SUCCESS.

âDig the foundation deep, young man;

Plant firm the outer wall.

Build it well what ere you do;

Build it straight and strong and true;

Build it clean and high and broad,

Build it for the eye of God.â

[83]

Have some definite aim in life. Donât drift âround and
âround like a log in a whirlpool.

Do the best you can and you will win; God could not
ask more than that.

Not only aim high, but muster up enough power to
pierce the opposition and to ring the bell.

Donât try to build character with a whisky bottle, a
pack of cards, a libertine life and cigarets. Put the Bible
and Jesus Christ in your life instead.

Be careful what you read. Donât read bad, worthless
books.

Donât assassinate every noble desire that comes to you.

Get a good introduction of yourself to yourself and find
out how little you really know.

Cut out the cigarets, boys, or theyâll cut you out. Just
take that from your Uncle Fuller.

Have the grit of Sampson in your system so that you
wonât tremble when the lions roar.

Donât have your veins filled with ice water. Get some
pepper, ginger and tabasco sauce into them.

Be a live wire. Be like the man with the itch; make
everybody scratch when they come near you.

Remember, youâre not measured by your size, but by
what you are.

If your pockets are empty, fill your heart with resolutions
and get into the game. Donât sit on the bleachers
and growl.

[84]

You canât determine success by the rattle of the cash
register.

The limbs of the tree of knowledge hang so low that
anybody with ambition can reach up and pluck the fruit.

Cities are whirlpools that whirl you into the jaws of
hell.

A FEW BUNTS TO LIVE STUDENTS.

Itâs a sad day for the young man when President Taftâs
overcoat wonât make him a vest, heâs so chesty.

Education is knowing what you want, knowing how to
get it, and knowing what to do with it after you get it.

If you find a fellow on the top of the hill, he never âlitâ
there; he climbed.

You canât measure manhood by a tape line around the
waist.

Parents, donât try to make your boy another âyou.â If
God had wanted another âyou,â he would have made you
twins.

You canât always tell the size of a man by the fuss he
makes. A frog makes more noise than a whale.

We can build universities, tax the people to support
them and furnish the best curriculum on Godâs dirt, but
we canât make something out of a nonentity.

When a girl is seventeen and is introduced to a young
man, she asks, âWho is he?â At twenty-two she asks,
âWhat is he?â and at thirty-five she cries, âFor Godâs
sake, where is he?â

[85]

If I had lived in Napoleonâs day I would have followed
his star for he could hit the ball.

You can hear more curbstone, barbershop and livery
stable theology in this city today than ever before.

All some men are fit for is to make one more when the
census count is taken.

The man who has nothing but money is the poorest man
on earth.

Itâs the false ideal that strews this world with wrecks.

SUNDAYâS TRIBUTE TO THE HOLIDAYS.

âIâm glad we celebrate the Fourth of July, when we can
uncork our enthusiasm and shoot firecrackers and eat
peanuts and drink red lemonade, for it makes us realize
that we are living in the greatest nation that manâs eye
ever saw or Godâs hand ever made. Iâm glad we have
Labor day, when the man who toils can have a holiday of
his own. Iâm glad we celebrate Easter to commemorate
the time when the Son of Man arose in conquering majesty.
Iâm glad we celebrate Thanksgiving, when we sit
at our sumptuously laden tables and recall that as a nation
we have never gone to bed hungry and that our granaries
have never been empty, and reflect that we have one
state that can raise corn enough to feed us all. America
can feed the world. I pay tribute to the man with the dinner
bucket, with bundles of muscle that knot like steel.
All these days are days of precious memories, days that
[86]

make the nation strong and great, days that make us better
men and women.â

âIf you are well prepared for life youâll never wear
out shoe leather hunting for a job, and youâll never become
blind reading the âHelp wantedâ ads.â

âWhat songs do the people go daffy over today? Listen
and Iâll tell you.â

âLove your neighbor as yourself,

But let his wife alone;

For if you donât heâll soon get wise,

And then youâll lose your own.â

And here Sunday named some of the popular songs he
said were causing divorces. Among them were: âMy
Wifeâs Gone to the Country,â âI Love My Wife, But Oh
You Kid,â and âIâll Trust My Wife With Fifty Men, But
With One?âNot On Your Life.â

Sunday pointed out five things which he stated he considered
necessary qualifications to win in life: Blood, environment,
grit, education and religion. He then added
that the first four without the fifth meant nothing at all,
and pleaded with his youthful audience to trust in God.

âIt takes more than a mortarboard cap, pipe, peg-top
trousers, a cane and your ârah, rah, rah,â to make a man
out of you. It takes character and determination. It pays
to feed the Bible to the children,â Sunday said.

[87]

BILLY SUNDAY AT THE AGES OF 24 AND 50 YEARS.

[88]

[89]

LIVING UP TO ONEâS PROFESSION.

You can summon all your card-playing, theatre-going
church members and they canât drive the devil out of a
boy as big as a peanut.

If you want the world to be better after awhile, then
keep the devil out of your boys and girls now.

I am an âamenâ Christian, but I donât shout it any
louder than I live it.

Youâre killing religion with your dignity today.

Lots of people would go to hell sure if they died out of
Lent season.

One-half the professing Christians amount to little or
nothing as a spiritual force.

SOME STRAY SHOTS FOR THE GALLERY.

Iâm a graduate of the university of poverty and have
taken several post-graduate courses there, too.

Some of you sing, âIâm standing on the solid rock,â
through a set of false teeth that you havenât paid for yet.

Nine-tenths of the church members are bench warmers.

âNot my will butââit costs some of you too much to
complete the other three wordsââThine be done.â Thatâs
why your spiritual batting average is only fifteen when it
ought to be nine hundred.

Iâd rather see a child in the mouth of a crocodile than
to see it dragged down by some immoral influence.

Go into the church and youâll find most of the bunch
nearer the theatre and card party than to Jesus.

[90]

The nearer to Jesus the more elbow room there is; the
farther away you find the biggest crowd.

SOME HOT ONES SHOT AT RANDOM.

You donât see the âS. R. O.â (standing room only) signs
in the churches; you have to go to the theatre to see them.

Show me a church where the minister hasnât any concern
in a spiritual revival, and I will show you a rich,
fashionable, third-rate amusement bureau with religion
left out.

Youâll spend more time and money getting a steer
ready for a business deal, than you will to start your boys
on a safe trip to heaven.

If youâre afraid to take your stand for fear of being
ridiculed by the miserable bunch that wonât trot square,
you ought to be ashamed to call yourself a man.

If you are in a business that religion hurts, you are a
moral pauper and in a mighty dirty, rotten, stinking business.

The trouble with a great many men is they have got all
their property and religion in their wivesâ name.

ONE OF âBILLYâ SUNDAYâS CHARACTERISTIC PRAYERS.

âWell, Lord, we pray Thou will help us. Iâm glad,
Jesus, that I can stand here today and say that after all
these years of trusting in Thee, Thou hast helped me.
Help them, God. We beseech Thee to help us here today.
[91]

Help us as we go along from day to day. Thereâll be
troubles, the way will be dark and dreary sometimes.
The sun will not always shine, thereâll be rain and dark
clouds, but theyâll soon clear away. It is the work of the
devil to make it hard for us. It is the devilâs work to make
us weak physically, so that it will be hard to bear the
strain of Godâs work. Oh, devil, why do you strike us
when weâre down? Why do you prey upon our weaknesses?
Why do you do it? You know, devil, you and I
are enemies. We always have been.

âThereâs no compromise between us. You know, devil,
Iâve never uttered a word, preached a sermon or written
a line that I didnât believe was right and that Iâll not
stand upon. I wouldnât take back a single thing I ever
said. And say, devil, if thereâs anything in my sermons
that doesnât hurt you, tell me, and Iâll take it out, and
Lord, if thereâs anything in my sermons that doesnât help
your work, tell me, and Iâll take it out. Iâve learned to
love these people Lord. Oh, their friendship and generosity
have been wonderful. I never saw such love and
kindness, Jesus. Iâve been overwhelmed by it. And now,
today, there may still be some who have not yet taken
their stand, and whoâll be the first to come down and take
me by the hand.â

[92]

SOME OF SUNDAYâS BOMBSHELLS.

If I ever accepted the pastorate of a church Iâd buy a
round trip ticket.

But believe me, Iâd skin the bunch while I was on the
job.

Too many people desert the prayer meeting for a card
party or a Dutch lunch.

Paul was an evangelist. Wherever he preached they
had to call out the cops to protect him. He always had
a riot or a revival.

We need a revival because the churches are critical,
cold, blown in the bottle, stamped on the corkâpetrified.
You canât scald a hog in ice-water.

The world would sink into hell before the Fourth of
July if it had to depend on âethicalâ revivals.

If you want to see this city as God wants it to be youâll
help. If you want it to be as hell and the devil wants it,
then knock.

There are two gangs in every churchâthe rubs and the
anti-rubs.

Some people have sat in their pews so long that they
are mildewed.

There are multitudes in heaven that have crept and
crawled out of the quagmire of filth and the cesspools of
iniquity and drunkenness.

It takes the combined efforts of the Trinity to keep you
out of hell.

[93]

Iâll do anything on earth to help a sinner. Iâll do anything
in the world to put the devil and all his cohorts in
hell.

Conversion must be effected by the influence of the
truth on the mind.

Truth resisted, loses its power on the mind that resists
and each resistance weakens the truth.

When God begins to show His power, then the devil
and all of the demons get busy.

Religion makes its appeal to your sensibility, not your
intellect.

The way into the kingdom is heart first, not head first.

God is not an explanation; God is a revelation.

Most people are converted at revival services.

If you are thirty and have not been converted, the
chances are that if you are not converted now, you will
never be converted.

If it werenât for revivals, just think what hell would be
like.

If you spurn Jesus Christ you are doing the same thing
which the Pharisees did.

Some say a revival is only temporary; so is a bath, but
it does you good.

Trouble with some fellows is that they have their religion
and property in their wivesâ names. Youâve got
to be something more than a brother-in-law to God.

If God had his way thereâd be no saloons.

[94]

The history of the church is a history of revivals; when
any preacher talks against revivals, heâs a damn scoundrel.

What the Church of God needs today is a baptism of
horse sense.

Some people never read the Bible from week-end to
week-end. No wonder they are dried up like an Egyptian
mummy.

Religion doesnât affect some poor old sinners any more
than shooting peas at the Rock of Gibraltar with a pop
gun.

If I can win a man over to Christianityâto keep a
drunkard sober, even just for a year, itâs worth every
dollar.

Some of the worst knockers I have in this county are
the preachersâsour grapes; thatâs the only way I can see
it.

Youâve been so dignified, stiff and worldly until youâve
grieved the Spirit of God.

Give the Lord a main line and see what heâll do these
days.

Never saw God bless a stingy gang yet.

I feel like a shouting Methodist. When you get a Presbyterian
shouting thereâs something doing.

I am pleading for the old-fashioned Pentacostal revival.
My evangelism is 2,000 years old; as old as the nails in
the cross.

[95]

If a city sags morally, the reason is not with God, but
with her citizenship. Theyâd rather have a dirty, rotten
town.

The biggest coward in America today, the biggest coward
we have in the profession of Christian religion, who
is afraid to come out and declare himself in a campaign
like this is the business man. He is afraid of some saloon
keeper, some brewer, some gambler and others of that
kindâtheyâre afraid they will lose their trade by it, and
by the eternal God they ought to be punished before the
moon changes.

I believe you are getting ready to place this town on
the map as a place where the name of God and decency
are revered.

Over your head, the devil and the angels of God are
locked in a struggle for your soul.

When you work for Jesus you must expect to be abused.

Heaven wants to save you, earth to cheat you and hell
to damn you.

You are just as good as you want to be and not a whit
better.

You havenât got money enough in your bank vault to
hire me to come here if I didnât care for the welfare of
your souls.

If man wrote the Bible weâd never been told that Noah
got drunk. Man would have left such things out, but God
didnât. He put everything in whether pleasant or unpleasant.

[96]

When you swell up like a poisoned pup and think you
are complimenting God by being present here tonight,
then Godâs got nothing for you.

Some of the biggest heathens this side of hell are right
here tonight.

âNo tradeâ is the passport by which 90 per cent of the
men are entering the prisons and penitentiaries.

You may be lower down in the sight of God than the
one whom you condemn.

The devil believes in God and in hell. Heâs more orthodox
than some preachers I know who preach that
there is no hell.

How can you pray when you look at the throne of God
through the bottom of a beer glass.

Some people pray as though they never expected anything
and theyâre not disappointed.

How can you pray and say âThy will be done,â when
you have the booze wagon drive up to your back gate
twice every week.

SUNDAYISMS.

I wish to God we all could see what a common sense
proposition religion really is.

Graft has a stranglehold on religion today.

A preacher told me that in a certain town an undertaker
came to him and offered a rake-off if heâd throw the
funerals his way.

[97]

The church member that rents his property for a saloon
is as bad as the saloon keeper himself.

Something has to be done to save this nation.

We are trying to apologize for manâs condition today
on an economic basis.

A free nation cannot endure if it is dominated by grafters,
special interests, thieves and crooks.

The constitution was cradled in prayer.

You spend a whole lot of money for flowers at the funeral
of your wife that you might have spent for a hired
girl.

Itâs a good thing for you Iâm not God for about fifteen
minutes. Iâd keep the undertaker busy unless you squared
up.

I could no more shock some of you folks than I could
pour something on a skunk to make it smell sweet.

It makes no difference whether you kneel before God
as a millionaire or a hoboâitâs a case of sin and salvation.

I donât care whether you hot-footed it to the Tabernacle
tonight or rode in an auto.

God puts no premium on laziness. You can bank on
thatâJesus Christ is the center, circumference and nucleus
of the Old and New Testament.

I believe that no man disbelieves in hell unless he finds
himself on the straight road to hell.

I wonder God is doing as well as He is with the bunch
He has to work with.

[98]

The new idea in religion says the world is getting better
and better. Thatâs not true. The world is getting
worse and worse.

Donât storm and fuss at God about the plans of redemption
when you donât know beans about a housefly.

The greatest scientists, the greatest painters, the greatest
inventors, the greatest astronomers, have all been
Christians.

If you are a member of a Masonic lodge, give me your
hand or take off that badge. Especially do I challenge
you if you are a Knight Templar, with your sword drawn
in defense of the gospel I am preaching.

AT A PRAYER MEETING, MR. SUNDAY OFFERED THE FOLLOWING PRAYER,
PLEADING TO GOD TO GIVE HIM STRENGTH TO CARRY ON HIS WORK.

âOh Jesus, weâre not making an excuse. Weâre not
trying to offer an excuse for not doing things as perhaps
we might have done. But our voice is hoarse, we feel
the strain of his campaign, our health is not the best, and
we pray to Thee for more strength with which to battle
down the forces of sin and hell. But Jesus, weâre willing
to fight for you, no matter how bad we feel. Weâll
stick to it, Jesus as long as you will let us. But, Jesus,
donât you think for a minute weâre trying to give some excuse.
Weâre tired, but on the job, and we want to stick
to it, so help us all and give us strength for Your sake.
Amen.â

[99]

FAITH OF GREAT MEN.

Washington, in the snow at Valley Forge, knelt down
and prayed for victory; Abraham Lincoln got down on
his knees at the White House and prayed to God; Burke,
Bismarck, Gladstone, Garfield, the immortal and martyred
McKinley, Hays and Roosevelt all had faith in God and
have prayed to him in times of war or trouble. Cleveland,
Harrison and Woodrow Wilson believe in the Bible.
Milton, Longfellow, Shakespeare and all other famous
poets drew their inspirations from the Bible; famous artists
dipped their brushes into the light of heaven and why
canât we all have that same faith?

BIBLE ABOVE ALL.

Man has assailed the Bible for ages. All who have undertaken
the job have found it the biggest one they ever
tackled and have been compelled to go to the mat and
take the count. But the Bible has withstood the ravages
of time, and today it stands buttressed about with the
demolished theories of speculators like the lonely light-house
on the distant island, the sands about her covered
with the bodies of seabirds that have battered their lives
out against her light windows. The conflicts of the ages
have swayed around this old book and the shores of time
have been strewn with broken and demolished theories
while the old ship Zion speeds on her way as strong as
ever with the banner floating from her mast.

[100]

SUNDAY KNOCKS OUT SOME âHOMEâ RUNS.

On Training Children at Home.

Blood tells: the time to start training the boy right is
seventy-five years before he is born.

The reason there are so many nickel theatres and hell-holes
in the wall is because the home is not made attractive
enough to retain the boy and girl.

Of all the devil-inspired sentences this is the limit:
âChildren should be seen and not heard.â

The biggest mistake we ever made was to take from the
teachers the right to lick the kids.

I believe the downfall of most men and women can be
traced to some defect in the home.

A home must be something more than four walls and a
roof.

The biggest monstrosity God ever looked at is the
mother with her children playing about her feet and they
not getting an inspiration of Jesus.

Weâre neglecting the home for the club, the lodge, the
card party, the literary society and the social function.

If a firm advertised for a bookkeeper it would expect
something else than just a man on legs; something else
than just a slot machine to shove its salary into every
Saturday night.

UP TO MOTHERS.

God pity us. If mothers had failed as fathers have,
God would have dumped you into hell long ago.

God bless the women. I believe in womenâs rights.

[101]

If some of you women had to get to heaven on the testimony
of your washerwomen, would you make it?

If you see a kid with its stockings hanging down like the
skin on a rhinoceros, and a dirty nose, it donât take a
prophet to say, âMaâs gone to the club.â

Outlawism is not settled by the street mobâit is settled
in the home.

I havenât much faith in the woman who talks heaven
and makes her home a hell.

Donât tell the children what you donât mean.

Donât talk about your neighbors or anybody else.

Donât hurt your childrenâs self-respect by punishing
them in the presence of company. Wait until the company
is gone, then dust both hemispheres.

Donât lie to your children, and then wonder where they
learned to lie.

Donât be a fool, and if youâve got plenty of income,
overdress your children and send them to school to make
the children of some poor, conscientious man dissatisfied
because their dad canât give them as nice clothes.

ELECTRIC FLASHES.

The young man or woman who is ashamed of his or
her father or mother, is a fool and too low down for me
to spit on.

To hear boys cuss youâd think cussing was a part of the
school curriculum.

[102]

The woman who tries to rid herself of the responsibilities
of maternity, is as red-handed and black-hearted a
murderess as she who chokes to death her 12-months old
babe.

Of all the contemptable, triple-extract of hell, God-forsaken,
hell-born, infamous, vile, stinking and damnable
people, the murderer who disguises under the title of
doctor is the worst.

A gambler, if he wins, is a thief, and if he loses, heâs a
fool. So heâs both a thief and a fool, no matter how you
look at it.

If a church runs a lottery, then itâs a thief.

There are three ways of spreading news, telephone, telegraph
and tell-a-woman. But thatâs really an insult,
for some of these old he-gossipers have got the women
backed off the boards.

I pity the woman whoâll slap Jesus in the face to please
some miserable society gang.

The dance hall has proved to be the biggest graveyard
this side of hell for young girls.

The fellow who lives purely for the gratification of his
lust, is so low down heâd have to take an airship to reach
hell.

The most useless woman on Godâs dirt is the society
woman.

Itâs a good thing to have money and all it will buy, but
itâs a better thing to sit down and think whether youâve
got what money canât buy.

[103]

Weâre making money by the bucketfuls in this country,
and weâre going to hell in carload lots and on excursion
rates, too.

Citizens who will not live on a level with the Ten Commandments
ought to be in the penitentiary. Public
opinion does not always judge correctly.

SUNDAY ON EVOLUTION.

âThe Bible says: âIn the beginning G-O-D, God!â I donât
know when that beginning was, but in the beginning God!
whether it was 6,000 years ago or a hundred of millions
of years ago, as some cranks now claim, created the
heaven and the earth. I donât believe the doctrine of evolution.
Did this tabernacle evolute? No: common sense
will tell you that. Did flowers evolute? If things have
evoluted, why havenât they been improved upon during all
these years? Flowers found today along the Nile grew
there in exactly the same form centuries ago. Have they
evoluted? You can put a gold belt around a hog, tie his
sides up with ribbons and heâll still squeal for slop. Heâs
the same old hog. Has he evoluted? If you believe
human beings evoluted from the ape, all right. If you
believe that your great-great-great-great-grandfather was
a monkey with a prehensile tail around the limb of a
cocoanut tree, all right; but donât connect your monkey
ancestors with me. Listen here, Iâm going to stick by that
bookâthe Bible if I die the very next instant.â

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE.

Late
events have proved that, notwithstanding the
dreams of visionary philosophers and the hopes of philanthropists,
the Millennium is not yet arrived; the lamb
cannot yet lie down in peace with the lion. Science has
performed miracles to procure comforts and luxuries for
man; literature and art have exerted their genial influence
over his life and manners; and commerce has brought
nations, geographically remote from each other, into the
most intimate relations. And yet the roots of all evilsâinterests,
passions, and ambitionsâare as actively alive in
promoting discord, as at the darkest periods of the worldâs
history.

Encouraged by the evident advantages arising from the
absence of war, a kindly but enthusiastic body of enlightened
men came forth to preach a new description of crusade,
a crusade for universal peace; and yet, years after the
promulgation of this holy mission, a nation, by far the
largest in geographical extent, thinks its time arrived,
throws off the mask, and boldly avows that, while other
iv

peoples have been fostering plans of universal amity and
brotherhood, it has been ever insidiously working out its
schemes for the subjugation of all the rest to its arbitrary
power.

The way in which Great Britain has met this, has been
attended by a lesson which I trust she will never forget.
It has proved to her, that if she is anxious to maintain the
proud station which her patriots, sages, warriors, and merchants
have raised her to, she must not only be a producer,
a manufacturer, and a carrier; she must not only be intelligent
and wealthy; she must be physically as well as morally
strong, able to assert her own rights and support those of
the weak and oppressed. Most lamentably has she suffered
from not attending to this. Like another Quixote, she has
rushed upon the enemy of humanity with the nobleness of
her nature, unprovided with everything but wealth, courage,
and faith in a good cause.

In his eloquent history of the Peninsular war, Sir William
Napier had pronounced an emphatic opinion upon the state
in which England was ever found at the commencement of a
new contest; that her parsimony always left her bare of

matÃ©riel
, men, and leaders. To the neglect of this warning
from a practical soldier, may we attribute most of our disasters
in the Crimea. We have gone headlong into a game
of which we seem to have known neither the moves nor the
chances. Our generation had little more real knowledge of
war, than schoolboys who fight with wooden swords under
v

the standard of a pocket-handkerchief tied to a stick. It is
not necessary for England to be essentially a warlike nation;
it is not her part in the worldâs progress; she is far more a
creator than a destroyer; but she must ever preserve a
consciousness of strength about her, that she knows will
secure her from aggression and insult. And let no one
imagine that this sense of strength will make her quarrelsome
or unduly sensitive; every observer must know that
the brave and powerful man is always the most peaceful:
he fears nobody, and therefore he is slow to take offence.

I by no means wish to convert Britain into a LacedÃ¦mon;
I would not have war to be the main business of our lives;
but all should cheerfully contribute to the keeping up of such
a military force as should make our country respected, even
by those who are regardless of all but physical power. Then
how commanding would be her march among nations! No
people in the world is so morally strong; how divine then
would be her influence, if others were made completely
aware that she had the power to enforce right as well as to
perceive it, to protect the injured as well as to pity them!
Witness the advent of a good and strong man into a company
of quarrelsome brawlers! it is like the appearance of
Neptune above the waves when the storm was scattering
and destroying the Trojan fleet.

But if it be necessary that we should always have a
powerful armed force ready for action, it is equally important
that that force should be acquainted with its trade.
vi

Lapped in peace, and surrounded by visions of wealth,
Englishmen have said, âWe fear not war, we know we are
always in possession of the sinews of it.â But they have
found themselves mistaken: a soldier can no more be made
in a day by the influence of money, than a lawyer can; half
a century of official duties will not make a general, nor will
all the experiences of the hunting-field teach a dashing
nobleman to lead on a charge of cavalry, with a due regard
to human life or a judgment that may insure success. In
all the disasters we have encountered in the Crimea, the
courage and physical strength of our soldiers have signalized
themselves, even beyond our hopes; but the readers of
historyâparticularly that part of it which relates to warâperceive
at once that our leaders have been wanting in that
genius or knowledge which has distinguished great captains.
With all our respect for the fine and gentlemanly qualities
of the lamented Lord Raglan, we cannot subdue a conviction
that if a Hannibal, an Alexander, a CÃ¦sar, a Belisarius,
a Turenne, a CondÃ©, a Marlborough, or even a Suwarrow,
1

had been at the head of such a gallant band, Sebastopol
would have been subdued long ago. I do not think that
either Buonaparte or his conqueror was eminently distinguished
in this branch of the art of war. It is not
often that a man can, like Clive, go from the desk to the
battle-field, and at once become a great general; or that so
young a man as Wolfe can take a Quebec. In guerilla or
vii

partisan warfare, unprepared but enthusiastic men sometimes
make successful leaders; but to handle great masses
of troops, or to besiege strongly-fortified cities, whatever a
generalâs genius may be, he must have a training in the
active practice of his profession.

It is not my place to write a dissertation upon the
military art; I have only to draw attention to the knowledge
of sieges, which form so prominent a part of it.
Neither does it come within my plan, or the limits allowed
me, to treat of the science of fortification; mine is but to
employ âthe philosophy which teaches by example,â and
exhibit the âGreat Sieges of History.â And valuable is
the lesson to all,âto the student of the art of war, to the
soldier at the cannonâs mouth, to the minister who plans
expeditions, and to the people who furnish the means for
them. There is scarcely a siege in this volume barren of
instruction; the principal of all being, that little can be
achieved in these mortal conflicts by either besieged or
besiegers, without energy constantly strained to the highest
pitch, sleepless watchfulness, keen and anxious observation,
consummate prudence, undaunted courage, firmness that is
proof against attack or accident, great physical powers of
endurance, and
MILITARY GENIUS
. When armies are opposed
upon the wide field of a country, the game of chess
may be played out by tacticians, or by great chance, success
may be obtained by a dashing
coup de main
; but in important
sieges, man is like the stag brought to bay, every faculty
viii

is forced into intense action, and the slightest error, the
faintest relaxation, may produce irretrievable ruin, with such
consequences as no other event presents. In great battles,
armies may be annihilated; but in captured cities peoples
are immolated and humanity is degraded by the wild indulgence
of its most brutal passions.

It is more than curious, it is wonderful, to observe how
many sieges will be found in this volume, whose fate has
been decided by means with which the art of war, as taught
in the schools, had nothing to do; and it is always the
captain of the greatest genius who seizes upon every unforeseen
discovery, any extraordinary accident, any suddenly-perceived
natural advantage, to defeat the best-concerted
and most scientific plans of his adversary: in one instance
the fortune of an assault is changed by suspending a pig
over the walls by a string fastened to his leg.

To induce students of the military art to read this work,
I shall satisfy myself with relating one fact. When Prince
Eugene was before Belgrade, he was surprised by the
appearance of an immense Turkish host in his rear, which
commenced their intrenchments, and prepared to sit down
comfortably to watch, annoy, and, with good opportunity,
to attack him. But Eugene had been an abbÃ© before he
was a soldier, and had read âCÃ¦sarâs Commentaries.â He
recollected that CÃ¦sar had once been circumstanced exactly
as he then was, and he determined to act as CÃ¦sar had
done. He allowed his enemies all to come up, but before
ix

they had quite established themselves in their new abode,
he led his whole force to a night assault, and though
superior numbers and unforeseen accidents increased the
difficulties, he defeated and dispersed the Turkish army,
and the city in consequence surrendered. Had Prince
Eugene not read CÃ¦sar, it is more than probable he would
never have taken Belgrade.

For my humble part in this eventful story, I have much
indulgence to request. To give such an account of the
Great Sieges of History as the subject deserved, in one
volume, was a thing impossible; and yet that was my task.
The details of most of the sieges I have been obliged to
curtail, and to entirely omit some which, I fear, may be
looked for by those who are locally interested in them.
Nevertheless, I have spared neither labour nor research;
and if earnestness of purpose and honesty of intention merit
approbation, I may, I trust, hope for as much as such a
work deserves.

In the arrangement of the sieges, after taking the first
one to which each place had been subjected in chronological
order, I judged it best to carry on the account so as to give
a continuous sketch of the sieges, or, in other words, of the
history of the country or city in question. After the first
perusal, such a book as this will be considered a work of
reference, and, in that view, this plan must be the best.
For the same reason I have admitted many sieges that
cannot be classed as âgreat,â because they formed connecting
x

links between the large ones. Without them, the
unlearned reader would be surprised, when next his attention
was drawn to a city which had cost one power immense
sacrifices to obtain, to find it in the possession of another.

As no two historians or chronologers agree about ancient
dates, I have had much trouble in settling the periods at
which sieges out of the regular pale of history took place.
In such cases my best plan was to adopt the opinion of the
highest authority, and, wherever there was a doubt, and his
name was available, I have followed Archbishop Ussher.

In accordance with my plan, I have in no instance considered
myself a scientific instructor. I have said that the
perusal of this book might be beneficial to military students,
but I have not contemplated that all young men of that
class were to become only engineers. It is the part of the
engineer to carry on his operations in accordance with the
rules he has been taught; but it is the higher duty of the

Captain
to be alive to the
CHANCES
of the siege, as well as
observant of its scientific progress. It has been my business
to relate the events, and, to a commander of genius, these
are as rich in instruction as the mere school-rules of his
awful art.

THE

GREAT SIEGES OF HISTORY.

Of
all the collisions between the members of the human
race for the furtherance of ambition, the maintenance of
liberty, or the assertion of disputed rights, we consider the
prominent sieges of history to be the most interesting and
instructive. We know of no situation in which the higher
virtues have been put to a severer test; in which courage,
firmness, endurance, patriotism, fidelity, humanity, have
shone with purer and more unmitigated lustre. In the
pages we are about to lay before our readers will be found
accounts of actions and sufferings of which the uninitiated
in history can scarcely suppose their fellow-men to be
capable: not brilliant actions of short-lived devotion performed
before applauding multitudes, not torments endured
with hopes of celestial recompense, but protracted, continuous
exertions, amidst privations, disease, famine, and
death in every hideous shape, prompted by love of country,
or fidelity to a cause honestly embraced.

As throughout nature Providence has pleased to establish
an antagonism which carries on the great scheme in harmony,
by setting creature against creature, in no instance
does man show his vast superiority more strongly over the
lower animals than in the defence or attack of his great
gregarious abodes. There are numerous animals who, like
man, draw up in battle array and dew fields with blood, but
none that can bring into play such high qualities as are
exhibited in our sieges, from one of a Scotch border tower
to Sebastopol. In no case is the difference between reason
and instinct more evident. The beaver of to-day constructs
2

and fortifies his dwelling exactly upon the same plan as the
first beaver after creation, whereas the science of fortification
and siege has kept equal pace with manâs enlightenment.
There is no doubt this portion of the art of war attained
perfection in the seventeenth century: circumstances of
time and place may modify it, but the great principles were
then established; the accessories since obtained by scientific
discoveries have only added power to the means of destruction,
they have not advanced the art itself. We do not
hesitate for a moment to say that a Turenne, CondÃ©, Vauban,
Marlborough, or Eugene, would vindicate their genius for the
great art of war as proudly and successfully at the present
time as they did in their own glorious day: when knowledge
of any kind has reached a certain point, all the difference
is in the men who employ it. The fate of nations at
that period depended upon sieges; soldiers of fortune of
highly cultivated intellect were engaged in the study and
practice of them; and though our readers will find many of
these awful contests much more set off with striking incidents
and more replete with horrors, they will meet with none
so scientifically carried on, both as to defence and attack,
as those of the latter part of the seventeenth century.

The historian of sieges has an immense advantage over
the chronicler of battles. The commander in a great battle
can, after the contest is over, give his own account of his
views, manÅuvres, expedients, and impulsive perceptions,
but no other person engaged can possibly describe anything
beyond what occurred at the point to which his own individual
exertions were confined. The brave soldier, with his
blood warmed by energetic action, his mind excited by a
love of honour and fame, and his heart, though true as his
sword, throbbing with a natural love of life, through the
dun smoke sees nothing but the enemy before him, and
thinks of nothing but the means of destroying him. It is
his duty to execute, and not to contemplate; and the careful
reader of a Gazette can generally give a better description
of the battle it announces than any soldier engaged in it.
Physical and material causes out of number combine to produce
this fact.

But the history of a siege is a very different affair. A
place is attacked scientifically and cautiously, to prevent
3

discomfiture; it is defended with watchful precaution, to
avoid surprises, and loss of husbanded means. Chess is
not played with the rash spirit of a Christmas round game.
Both parties have leisure to note every event that advances
or retards their great object; and if the contest be a protracted
one, such calamitous circumstances are sure to arise
as will give to it the deepest feeling of human interest. As,
in the history of the world, the accounts of its periods of
trouble occupy a thousand times more space than its records
of peace and prosperity, so sieges, having given birth to
more suffering than perhaps any other cause attributable to
man alone, we have, in greatest abundance, most appalling
descriptions of these frightful struggles, in which human
beings seem to have been gathered together into corners to
prove all they were capable of performing or enduring.
That a great siege is the sublime view of men acting in
masses, is proved by two of the most exalted poets of the
world having each chosen one as the subject most worthy
of his genius. To us humble narrators, Homerâs âSiege of
Troyâ and Tassoâs âSiege of Jerusalemâ are of inestimable
value, as, independently of their poetic beauties, pointing
out clearly the different modes of carrying on a siege at
periods so remote from each other. Notwithstanding all
the splendour bestowed by the presence of gods, demigods,
and heroes, Homerâs siege is of the most primitive kind.
Abortive attacks upon the walls, unsupported by machinery
or any attempt at art, not even the palpable one of escalade,
together with vain efforts to get into the city, and continual
skirmishes and duels with the besieged in their sorties,
seem to have comprised all the art of war exercised by the
cunning Greeks in this their great early invasion of a
foreign territory, or rather of a city, as the expedition to
Colchis preceded it by a generation: the sires of Homerâs
heroes manned the Argo. All the strength of the defenders
consisted of the watchful and constant use of spear and
shield in repulsing the attacks of the enemy; and their
courage was displayed in daily excursions, in war-chariots
and on foot, upon the plains surrounding the beleaguered
city. In Tasso we see the art of war as it was practised in
his time in Europe, and as it has been practised in Asia for
several centuries. To avoid an anachronism, there is no
4

gunpowder; but he employs every other accessory of machinery,
towers, and the Greek fire, with missiles of various
kinds, unknown to the Homeric age. But we must not
allow general remarks to anticipate narration.

To attempt to give even a sketch of all the sieges of
history, in addition to involving a great chance of sameness,
would require many volumes; we shall therefore confine
ourselves to accounts, as intelligible and graphic as we can
make them, of such of these great human conflicts as have
changed the fate of empires, forwarded or impeded the progress
of peoples, or have been illustrated by the actions of
men of world-spread celebrity. But, whilst only giving the
details of important sieges, we shall not pass by the
innumerable interesting incidents with which the accounts
of minor sieges abound: it is, indeed, not uncommon to
meet, in contests unimportant to the world, with the noblest
and most extraordinary acts of devotedness or courage of
which individual man is capable.

BACTRA.

A.C. 2134.

In
all arts the East has led the van, and has evidently
been as far advanced before the Western nations in the great
one of fortifying its cities as in most others. The first siege
we can obtain any account of is that of Bactra, and we are
told it was so fortified by nature and art, that Ninus, at the
head of four hundred thousand men, would never have been
able to take it, if a stratagem had not been suggested to him
by Semiramis, the wife of one of his officers. This account
proves that fortifying cities was not then a new invention,
for it is not likely that such a degree of perfection could
have been attained by a first attempt. Everything in the
East seems to have been upon a gigantic scale: the cities
were immense in extent, the height of the walls and towers,
and the depth and width of the surrounding moats or ditches,
almost incredible. And yet, modern research is stamping
5

the astounding accounts of historians and topographers with
the broad seal of truthâeverything in the East
was
on a
gigantic scale: where human life and human labour, in
densely-populated countries, were without restriction at the
command of vain and ambitious despots, the Pyramids, the
walls of Babylon, and the palaces of Baalbec cease to be
miracles.

Ninus, king of Assyria, one of the most ancient of the
great disturbers of the peace of mankind called conquerors,
was desirous of putting the crown to his glory by the conquest
of Bactriana, now Corassan. Nothing in the open
country could resist an army of four hundred thousand men;
but Bactra, the capital, for a length of time withstood all
his endeavours. As the defence of a city consisted in its
walls, ditch, and advantages of position only, so the means
of attack were correspondingly simple; and we are not
surprised at the inhabitants holding out for a time which in
modern warfare would be impossible. We are told that the
genius of Semiramis conceived a stratagemâwhat we do not
learnâby which the city was at length taken, and her
master, in a truly eastern manner, showed his gratitude by
seeking a cause for putting her husband to death, and
making her his wife. Some accounts do not hesitate to say
that the lady, at least as ambitious as Ninus, repaid him by
removing him as he had removed her first husband, in order
to reign alone.

AÃ.

A.C. 1451.

As
an account falling in most with the spirit of uninspired
history, we select a short description of the taking
of AÃ¯ by the Israelites, under Joshua.

Whilst night concealed from the inhabitants of AÃ¯ all that
was passing beneath their walls, Joshua placed a body of
troops behind the city, with orders to set fire to it when he
should give the signal. At daybreak, Joshua presented
himself before AÃ¯, and feigned to attempt an escalade.
6

The inhabitants appeared upon their walls, and the Israelites,
dissembling fear, withdrew from the attack. The inhabitants
issued immediately from the city to pursue them,
incautiously leaving their gates open. At the given signal
the troops in ambush advanced, marched in at the unguarded
gates, and set fire to the place. The Canaanites, on perceiving
the flames, gave up all as lost, and flying away, were
nearly exterminated by their conquerors.

THEBES, IN BÅOTIA.

A.C. 1252.

The
history of this famous siege has been rendered immortal
by the tragic muse; few of our readers can require
to have its details repeated to them. The unfortunate
Ådipus, on quitting his kingdom, left it to the government
of his two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, who agreed to
mount the throne alternately. Eteocles, as the elder,
reigned first; but, at the termination of his year, he was so
enamoured of the power he had tasted, that he violated his
oath, and endeavoured to exclude his brother from the
throne. Polynices took up arms, and sought on all sides
for partisans to assist him against the usurper; Adrastus,
king of the Argives, roused all Greece in his favour. The
contest was long and sanguinary, and the chief loss fell
upon the adherents of Polynices. After many fruitless
battles beneath the walls of Thebes, the brothers resolved
to terminate their quarrel by a single combat. The two
armies were drawn up as witnesses of the fight, and as
securities for its fairness. The unnatural enemies entered
the prescribed lists, and attacked each other with such
deadly animosity, that both fell dead upon the spot. It is
feigned that, when their bodies were burnt, the spirit of
hatred remained unextinct even in their remains, and that
the flames separated as they arose. Their antipathy was
preserved in their posterity, breaking out into needless but
bloody wars. In such a work as this, principally intended
7

for the young, it was impossible to pass by so memorable a
siege; otherwise, we conceive the whole history of Ådipus
and his race to be one of the most unpleasing handed down
to us by the Greeks.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 518.

The second siege of this celebrated city is much more
satisfactory.

The LacedÃ¦monians, upon becoming masters of Thebes,
made the inhabitants but too sensible of the weight of their
yoke. Pelopidas, too noble to submit quietly to slavery,
conceived the design of delivering his country; he addressed
himself to the banished citizens, and he found them enter
freely into his views. Many of his friends in the city were
eager to share his enterprise; and one of them, named
Charon, offered his house as a retreat for the conspirators.
When they had secretly taken the most prudent precautions
to insure success, Pelopidas drew near to the city. Before
entering it, he held a council, in which it was agreed that
all should not depend upon one cast of the dice, but that a
small number should try their fortune first. Pelopidas and
eleven of his brave companions accepted this perilous commission;
they warned Charon of their approach, and proceeded
towards Thebes, dressed as sportsmen, followed by
hunting-dogs, and carrying in their hands nets and weapons
of the chase. Before entering the city, they discarded their
hunting appointments, assumed the guise of simple countrymen,
and slipped in at various gates, all directing their
course to the house of Charon. Philidas, one of the conspirators,
that same evening gave a grand entertainment, at
which Philip and Archias, the LacedÃ¦monian governors,
were the most honoured guests. When these two were
sufficiently warmed with wine to be insensible to anything
but their pleasures, the conspirators proceeded to action,
and, dividing themselves into two bodies, commenced by the
easy immolation of Philip and Archias. Pelopidas and his
party went straight to the house inhabited by Leontidas,
one of the tyrants, who, on being roused from his sleep,
seized his sword and struck the first conspirator that
approached him dead at his feet; but he found a more
8

successful opponent in Pelopidas: the brave Theban quickly
laid the tyrant by the side of his unfortunate compatriot.
After this bold attempt, the banished Thebans speedily
joined the patriotic little band, and laid siege to the citadel.
The LacedÃ¦monians were soon forced to capitulate; and
this memorable enterprise, conceived by the genius of
Pelopidas, and executed almost entirely by his own hand,
procured the liberty of Thebes. We are sorry we cannot
add, that that liberty was secured: the glory or prosperity
of Thebes is an anomaly in history, it belongs principally
to one generation. Pelopidas was the friend and companion
of Epaminondas, with which great manâone of the greatest
of all antiquityâthe sun of Thebes arose and set.

THIRD SIEGE, A.C. 334.

After the celebrated battle of ChÃ¦ronea, which laid the
liberties of Greece at the feet of the ambitious Philip of
Macedon, that king placed a garrison in Thebes; but
scarcely had the inhabitants learnt the death of Philip, when
they arose in mass, and slaughtered the Macedonians.
Alexander, the son of Philip, afterwards styled the Great,
passed through the Straits of ThermopylÃ¦, rendered immortal
by Leonidas and his Spartans, entered Greece, and marched
directly towards the revolted city. On the way, he said to
those who accompanied him, âDemosthenes in his harangues
called me a child when I subdued Illyria; he styled me a
giddy youth when I punished the Thessalians: we will now
show him, under the walls of Athens, that I am a man
grown.â His appearance in BÅotia, like the rest of the
actions of his life, was carried into effect as soon as decided
upon. When he reached the walls of Thebes, he was satisfied
with requiring that PhÅnix and Prothulus, the principal
promoters of the insurrection, should be given up to him.
The Thebans, however, insultingly replied by demanding
Philotas and Antipater, Alexanderâs generals and friends;
and the young monarch found himself under the painful
necessity of proceeding to extremities. Thebes had rendered
such services to his father, that he proceeded to the infliction
of punishment with great reluctance. A memorable
battle ensued, in which the Thebans fought with ardour and
9

courage; but, after a protracted struggle, the Macedonians
who were left in the citadel, taking the Thebans in the rear,
whilst the troops of Alexander charged them in front, they
were almost all cut to pieces. Thebes was taken and
pillaged. In the sack of this city, a lady of high quality
exhibited an instance of courage and virtue too extraordinary
to be passed by in silence. A Thracian officer, struck by
her beauty, employed violence to satisfy his passion; and
then characteristically proceeded to the indulgence of his
avarice, by demanding of her where she had concealed her
treasures. The lady, whose name was Timoclea, told him
that she had cast them all into a well, which she pointed out
to him. Whilst he was leaning over the brink, looking with
greedy avidity for the treasure, she suddenly exerted all her
strength, pushed him in, and beat him to death with stones.
Timoclea was arrested, and led before Alexander; but, with
all his errors, the young Macedonian had too much generosity
of character not to be struck by such an action, and
he pardoned her. We wish we could say he was equally
lenient towards the Thebans; but the unfortunate city was
razed to the ground, and thirty thousand of its inhabitants
were sold into slavery.

He here, however, first displayed that love of letters, and
veneration for men distinguished in them, which characterized
him during his short but brilliant career; for, amidst the
general destruction, he ordered the house in which the lyric
poet Pindar was born to be held as sacred as a temple, and, at
the same time, sought out and provided for all the descendants
of the family of the bard of Thebes.

The history of this city is a remarkable one. Although
not ranking so high as Sparta or Athens, it was raised to
an equal importance by the courage, talents, and high moral
character of one man. Epaminondas is, perhaps, the noblest
specimen Greece has handed down to us of the
hero
, in all
senses: and to his career was bounded the glory of his
native city; it rose with him, and with him expired.

TROY.

A.C. 1184.

The
next siege we meet with is the most celebrated in
history or fiction, not so much on its own account, as from
its good fortune in having the greatest poet the world has
produced as its chronicler. If Homer had not placed this
great siege in the regions of fable by his introduction of
immortals into the action, it would still be a myth, as is all
we know of Greece at the period at which it took place.
Hypercritics have, indeed, endeavoured to make over the
whole of it to the muses who preside over fiction; but we
cannot accede to their decision. There is a vital reality in
the characters of Homer, which proves that they did exist
and act; a blind old bard might sing the deeds of heroes,
and perhaps clothe those deeds with some of the splendour
of his genius; but we have no faith in his having created
the men, any more than he did the immortals, who belonged
to the mythology of his country long before he was born.
There is nothing in the âsong of Troy divineâ that is
dissonant with the character of the age; so far to the contrary,
we believe the poet has given a more faithful picture
of the heroes, and the events connected with them, than any
historian has done. Achilles is as perfect from the hands of
Homer, as Alexander from the pen of Quintus Curtius or
Arian. If we disperse the mist of diablerie which surrounds
Macbeth, we shall find him a human character, acted upon
by human passions, independently of the witches; and so
with Homerâs heroes: they are all most essentially real
men, notwithstanding the gorgeous mythology that attends
them, and act as they would have done without immortal
intervention. We have as perfect faith in the history of
the siege of Troy, as in most of the pages of what has
been termed the âgreat lie.â Independently of the work
of genius for ever associated with it, the siege of Troy is a
memorable epoch in human annals.

11

Tyndarus, the ninth king of LacedÃ¦mon, had, by Leda,
Castor and Pollux, who were twins, besides Helena, and
Clytemnestra the wife of Agamemnon, king of MycenÃ¦.
Having survived his two sons, the twins, he became anxious
for a successor, and sought for a suitable husband for his
daughter Helena. All the suitors bound themselves by oath
to abide by the decision of the lady, who chose Menelaus,
king of Sparta. She had not, however, lived above three
years with her husband before she was carried off by
Alexander or Paris, son of Priam, king of the Trojans. In
consequence of this elopement, Menelaus called upon the
rulers of the European states of Greece, and more particularly
upon those who had been candidates for her hand, to
avenge this Asiatic outrage. All answered to the summons,
though some, like Ulysses, unwillingly. As every one knows,
the siege lasted ten years; which only goes to prove the discordant
parts of which the besieging army was composed:
had there been union beneath a completely acknowledged
head, the city could not have held out so long by many
years. But Agamemnon was like Godfrey of Bouillon in
the Crusadesâhe was only a nominal chief, without a particle
of real power over the fiery and rude leaders of the troops of
adventurers composing the army. This necessity for union
is the principal lesson derived by posterity from the siege of
Troy; but to the Asiatics of the period it must have been a
premonitory warning of what they had to dread from the
growing power of the Greeks. Divested of fable, and as
many of the contradictions removed as possible, we believe
the above to be the most trustworthy account of this celebrated
affairâno one would think of going into the details
after Homer. According to Bishop Ussher, the most safe
chronological guide, the siege of Troy took place 1184 years
before the birth of Christ, about the time that Jephtha ruled
over the Jews. This last circumstance cannot fail to bring
to the minds of our readers the extraordinary fact that the
involuntary parental sacrifices of Iphigenia and the âdaughter
of Jephtha, Judge of Israel,â were contemporary. The
period of the war of Troy, standing on the verge between
fable and history, is a very useful one to be retained in the
memory.

12

JERUSALEM.

No
city in the world has enjoyed so much veneration as
well as attention as Jerusalem, and yet no city has been
subjected to more violence. Almost held in as much reverence
by the Mahometans as the Christians, the possession of
the Holy City was equally a devotional object as a territorial
one, with the followers of both creeds. Jerusalem has been
besieged more than twelve times, and, as in such contests,
religion only seems to embitter enmities and enhance
cruelties, the state of this otherwise favoured city can have
been no object of envy.

FIRST SIEGE, A.C. 1051.

After the death of Joshua, the tribes of Juda and Simeon,
having united their forces, marched upon this already important
place with a formidable army. They took the lower
city, and, faithful to the orders of Moses, slaughtered all who
presented themselves to their fury. The upper city, called
Sion, checked their victorious progress. The efforts of the
Hebrews, during nearly four centuries, failed whilst directed
against this citadel. The glory of carrying it was reserved
for David. This hero, proclaimed king by all the tribes,
wished to signalize his accession to the throne by the capture
of Jerusalem; but the Jebusites, who inhabited it, feeling
convinced that their city was impregnable, only opposed his
army with the blind, the lame, and the crippled. Enraged
by this insult, David made them pay dearly for their rude
pride. He ordered a general assault; and Joab, mounting
the breach at the head of a chosen troop, overthrew the
infidels, pursued them to the fortress, entered with them,
and opened the gates to the king. David drove out the inhabitants,
repaired the walls, strengthened the fortifications,
and established his abode in the city, which, from that time,
became the capital of the kingdom of the Jews.

13

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 976.

In the reign of Rehoboam, the grandson of David, Shishak,
king of Egypt, laid siege to Jerusalem, threatening to raze
it with the ground if any opposition were offered to his arms.
The indignant people were eager to attack the enemy of
their religion and their country, but Rehoboam, as cowardly as
a warrior as he was imperious as a monarch, opened the
gates of his capital to the haughty Egyptian, and quietly
witnessed the pillage of it.

THIRD SIEGE, A.C. 715.

In the first year of the reign of Ahaz, king of Juda, Rezin,
king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, presented themselves
in warlike array before Jerusalem. Their design was
to dethrone Ahaz and put an end to the dynasty of David.
But their ambitious project was checked by the sight of the
fortifications, and, after a few vain attempts, they retreated
with disgrace.

Some time after, the Holy City was attacked by a much
more redoubtable enemy. Sennacherib, king of Assyria,
claimed of Hezekiah the tribute which his weak father,
Ahaz, had consented to pay; and after having overrun
Ethiopia, besieged him in his capital. The fate of Jerusalem
seemed pronounced, and the kingdom was about to fall into
the power of a haughty and irritated conqueror; but the
hand of Providence intervened; a miraculous slaughter of
the Assyrians took place in one night, and the army of
Sennacherib retreated precipitately.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.C. 603.

Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took Jerusalem by
force, and gave it up to pillage. He placed King Joachim
in chains, and afterwards released him upon his promising
to pay tribute; but that prince soon violated his engagement.
Nebuchadnezzar reappeared, Jerusalem was again
taken, and Joachim expiated his perfidy and revolt by his
death.

The impious Zedekiah, one of his successors, proud of an
14

alliance contracted with the Egyptians, against the opinion
of the prophet Jeremiah, ventured, as Joachim had done,
to endeavour to evade the yoke of the Chaldeans. Nebuchadnezzar,
upon learning this, marched against him, ravaged
Judea, made himself master of the strongest places, and
besieged Jerusalem for the third time. The king of Egypt
flew to the assistance of his ally; but Nebuchadnezzar met
him in open fight, defeated him, and compelled him to seek
shelter in the centre of his states. Jerusalem, which had
given itself up to a violent, transitory joy, became a prey to
new terrors. The king of Babylon renewed the siege, and
Zedekiah determined to behave like a man who has everything
to gain and nothing to lose. The city was blockaded,
the enemy stopped all supplies, and laid waste the country
round. An immense population was shut up in the capital,
which the circumvallation soon reduced to a frightful state
of famine. A single grain of wheat became of incredible
value, and water, which an extraordinary drought had rendered
scarce, was sold for its weight in gold. A pestilence
likewise, no less formidable than the famine, made terrible
ravages. The streets were blocked up with dead bodies
left without sepulture, whose fetid odour became fatal to
the living. Desolation and despair stifled all the feelings
of nature; mothers were seen slaughtering their infants, to
release them from such calamities, and afterwards expiring
upon their bleeding bodies.

The enemy in the mean time pushed on the siege most
warmly: the rams never ceased to batter the walls; and vast
wooden towers were erected, from the summits of which
enormous stones were launched upon the heads of those
whom famine and pestilence had spared. But even in this
extremity the Jews persisted in their defence; Zedekiah
concealing his alarm under a firm countenance, reassuring
them by his words, and animating them by his example.
The more impetuous the enemy, the more furious became
the citizens. They opposed force by force, and art quickly
destroyed whatever art devised. Eighteen months passed
in this way, without any attention being paid to the voice
of Jeremiah, who continued to press the inhabitants to
throw open their gates, and by concession disarm the wrath
of a power that must in the end overcome them. At length
15

the enemy effected a great breach, and it became necessary
to yield. Zedekiah marched out at a secret gate at the
head of the soldiery, but he was overtaken, loaded with
chains, and led away into captivity, after witnessing the
massacre of his children, and after being deprived of the
light of day, which had too long shone upon his sacrileges.
The conqueror made his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem;
he bore away all the riches of the temple, immolated the
greater part of the inhabitants, and led the rest into slavery,
after reducing the temple and the principal quarters of the
city to ashes. Such was the first destruction of Jerusalem,
richly merited by the impiety and vices of its inhabitants,
1,468 years after its foundation by Melchisedech, and nearly
five hundred years after David wrested it from the power of
the Jebusites.

Many years after, Zerubbabel rebuilt it by permission of
Cyrus, king of Persia; Nehemiah reinstated the fortifications.
It submitted to Alexander the Great; and after
death had carried off that conqueror, withstood several
sieges for a time; but these were of trifling importance,
though they generally terminated in the plunder of the
Temple. This was the state of the Holy City up to the
time of the great Pompey.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.C. 63.

The Jews having refused a passage to the Roman army
which was marching against Aristobulus, Pompey, highly
irritated, set himself down before their capital. The sight
of this place, which nature and art appeared to have rendered
impregnable, made him, for the first time, doubtful of
the good fortune which had so often crowned his exploits.
He was in this state of incertitude when the Jews of the
city, with that want of true policy which distinguished them
in all ages, divided themselves into two factions. The one
favourable to the Romans proving to be the stronger, opened
the gates to Pompey, whilst the other, consisting of the
partisans of Aristobulus, retired to the Temple, to which the
Roman general quickly laid siege. He raised vast terraces,
upon which he placed balistÃ¦ and other machines of war,
the continual play of which drove away the defenders of the
16

walls. But the Jews, whom nothing seemed to astonish,
rendered the efforts of the Romans useless by their valour
and perseverance. They defended themselves with so much
art and intrepidity, that in the course of three months the
Romans were only able to take one tower. But at length
the vigorous obstinacy of the legions was crowned with its
usual success; the Temple was taken by assault, Cornelius
Faustus, son of the dictator Sylla, at the head of a brave
troop, being the first to enter the breach. All who ventured
to show themselves were massacred. Several sacrificers
were immolated in the performance of their ministry.
All who could escape the fury of the enemy either precipitated
themselves from the nearest rocks, or, gathering
together their wealth, after setting fire to it, cast themselves
into the flames. Twelve thousand Jews perished in
this unfortunate instance. Pompey respected the treasures
of the Temple, and crowned his victory by forbearance and
generosity.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.C. 37.

Herod the Great had been declared king of the Jews by
the Romans; but Jerusalem refused to acknowledge him.
This prince, aided by Sosius, whom Antony had sent to him
with several legions, marched against that city, at the head
of a numerous army. He laid siege to it, raised three
platforms, which dominated over the towers, poured from
their summits a continuous shower of darts, arrows, and
stones upon the besieged, and unceasingly battered the
ramparts with rams and other machines he had brought
with him from Tyre. But the Jews, still intrepid, despised
death, and only sought to inflict it upon their assailants.
If a wall was destroyed, another arose as if by magic. If a
ditch was dug, it was rendered useless by a countermine,
and they constantly appeared in the midst of the besiegers
when least expected. Thus, without being depressed, either
by frequent assaults or by the famine which now made
itself cruelly felt, they resisted during five months the
united efforts of the Romans and the Jewish partisans of
Aristobulus. At length, both the city and the Temple were
carried by assault. Then death assumed one of his most
17

awful characters. The Romans bathed themselves in the
blood of an obstinate enemy; and the Jews of the kingâs
party, rejecting every feeling of humanity, immolated to
their fury every one of their own nation whom they met in
the streets and houses, or even found in the temple. Herod,
however, by means of prayers, promises, and menaces, at
length obtained a cessation of this horrible butchery, and
to prevent the pillaging of the city and the Temple, he
generously offered to purchase them of the Romans with
his own wealth. This capture of Jerusalem occurred thirty-seven
years before Christ, on the very day on which Pompey
had carried it by assault twenty-seven years before.

SEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 66.

Towards the end of the reign of Nero, in the sixty-sixth
year of the Christian era, under the pontificate of Mathias,
the son of Theophilus, began the famous war of the Jews
against the Romans. The tyranny, the vexations, the sacrileges
of the governors were the causes of it. Tired of
groaning so long under a foreign yoke, the Jewish nation
believed they had no resource left but in despair. Fortune
at first appeared favourable to them; the Romans were
beaten several times: but Vespasian, whom the Roman
emperor had charged with this war, was soon able, by the
exercise of skill, prudence, and valour, to attract fortune to
his standards, and to keep her there. After having subdued
the whole of Palestine, he was preparing to commence
the blockade of Jerusalem, when his army recompensed his
virtues with the empire. The new emperor assigned to his
son Titus the commission of subduing the rebels and laying
siege to the capital.

Jerusalem, built upon two very steep mountains, was
divided into three parts,âthe Upper City, the Lower City,
and the Temple, each having its separate fortifications. The
Temple was, so to say, the citadel of the two cities. Several
thick and very lofty walls rendered access to it impracticable;
by the side of it stood a fortress which defended it,
called Antonia. A triple wall, which occupied the space of
three hundred stadia, surrounded the entire city: the first
of these walls was flanked by ninety very lofty and strong
18

towers; that of the middle had only fourteen, and the
ancient one sixty. The noblest of these towers were called
Hippicos, Phazael, and Mariamne, and could only possibly
be taken by famine. At the northern extremity was, still
further, the palace of Herod, which might pass for a strong
citadel. It thus became necessary for Titus, to make himself
master of Jerusalem, to form several successive sieges;
and whatever part the assailants carried, they seemed to
leave the strongest untouched. Such was the place which
Titus came to attack with soldiers accustomed to war and
victory; and, in spite of their valour, it is more than probable
he would have failed, if cruel intestine divisions had
not marred all the noble efforts of the unfortunate city.

A troop of brigands, headed by Eleazar, of the sacerdotal
tribe, whom impunity had allowed to gather together, threw
themselves into Jerusalem. These lawless men, who assumed
the well-sounding name of the Zealots, profaned the
Temple with the greatest crimes, and subjected the citizens
to most of the misfortunes of a city taken by assault by a
cruel enemy. This faction, as might be expected, however,
soon became divided, and turned its arms against itself. A
wretch named John of Giscala supplanted Eleazar, and
made himself sole chief of the Zealots. The latter, jealous
of the authority of his rival, separated himself from him,
and, having recovered an interest with a considerable number
of partisans, took possession of the interior of the
Temple, and thence made attacks upon the troops of John.
On another side, Simon, the son of Gioras, whom the people
in their despair had called in to their succour, seized upon
the supreme authority, and held almost the whole city under
his power. These three factions carried on a continual
strife with each other, of which the people were always the
victims: there was no security in their dwellings, and it was
impossible to leave the city, of which the factions held all
the means of egress. All who dared to complain or to
speak of surrendering to the Romans, were immediately
killed; fear stifled speech, and constraint kept even their
groans within their own hearts. When Titus had reconnoitred
the place, brought up his army, and commenced
operations, these tyrants, seeing the danger which threatened
them equally, suspended their divisions and united
19

their forces, with the hope of averting the storm. They
made, in rapid succession, several furious sorties, which
broke through the ranks of the Romans, and astonished
those warlike veterans; but such trifling advantages were
not likely to affect such a man as Titus: he made another
tour of the city to ascertain upon what point it could be best
assailed, and, after his foresight had taken all necessary precautions
to insure success, he set his machines to work,
ordered the rams to maintain an incessant battery, and commanded
a simultaneous attack upon three different sides.
With great exertions, and after a contest of fifteen days, he
carried the first wall, in spite of the spirited resistance of the
besieged. Animated by this success, he ordered the second
to be attacked; he directed his rams against a tower which
supported it, obliged those who defended it to abandon it,
and brought it down in ruins. This fall made him master
of the second rampart five days after he had taken the first;
but scarcely had he time to congratulate himself upon this
advantage, when the besieged fell upon him, penetrated his
ranks, caused the veterans to waver, and retook the wall.
It became necessary to recommence the attack upon it: it
was contested during four days upon many points at once,
and the Jews were at length compelled to yield. Titus by
no means wished for the destruction of Jerusalem, and with
a view of leading the inhabitants back to their duty by intimidation,
he made a review of his troops. There has
seldom been a spectacle more capable of inspiring terrorâthe
mind cannot contemplate these conquerors of the world
passing in review before such a man as Titus, without something
like awe. But the seditious Jews, for they seldom
deserve a better name, would not listen to any proposals
for peace. Being convinced of this, the Roman general
divided his army, for the purpose of making two assaults
upon the fortress Antonia; he nevertheless, before proceeding
to this extremity, made one more effort to bring the
rebels to reason. He sent to them the historian Josephus,
as more likely than any other person to persuade them, he
being a Jew, and having held a considerable rank in his
nation. This worthy envoy made them a long and pathetic
discourse to induce them to have pity on themselves, the
sacred temple, the people, and their country; he pointed
20

out to them all the evils that would fall upon them if they
did not listen to his prudent advice; he recalled to their
minds the misfortunes which had overwhelmed their fathers
when they had ceased to be faithful to their God, and the
miracles which had been worked in their favour when they
had observed his commands: he bore witness to the truthfulness
of his own feeling by ending his harangue with a
flood of tears. The factions, however, only laughed at him
and his eloquence; and yet many of his hearers were convinced,
and, endeavouring to save themselves, sold all they
had for small pieces of gold, which they swallowed for fear
the tyrants should rob them of them, and made their way to
the Roman ranks. Titus received them with kindness, and
permitted them to go whither they wished. As these continued
to escape daily, some of the Roman soldiers learned
the secret of the concealed gold, and a report prevailed in the
camp that the bodies of these fugitives were filled with
treasures. They seized some of them, ripped them open,
and searched among their entrails for the means of satisfying
their abominable cupidity. Two thousand of these miserable
wretches perished in this manner. Titus conceived
such a horror at this, that he would have punished the
perpetrators with death, if their numbers had not exceeded
those of their victims. He continued to press the siege
closely: after having caused fresh terraces to be erected, to
replace those the enemy had destroyed, he held a council
with his principal officers: most of them proposed to give a
general assault; but Titus, who was not less sparing of the
blood of his soldiers than he was prodigal of his own, was of
a contrary opinion. The besieged, he said, were destroying
one another; what occasion could there be to expose so
many brave warriors to the fury of these desperate ruffians?
He formed the project of surrounding the place with a wall,
which would not allow the Jews to make any more sorties.
The work was distributed among all the legions, and was
completed in three days. It was then that the miserable
factions began for the first time to despair of their safety.

If the troubles without the walls were great, those which
consumed the unhappy city were still more terrible. Who
can paint, exclaims Josephus, the fearful effects of the
famine which devoured these unfortunates? It increased
21

every day; and the fury of the seditious, more redoubtable
than this scourge itself, increased with it. They held no
property sacred; everything was torn from the unhappy
citizens. A closed door denoted provisions within: they
forced it open, and snatched the morsels from the mouths
about to swallow them, with brutal violence. They struck
down old men; they dragged women by the hair, without
regard to either age, sex, or beauty; they spared not lisping
innocence. Such as still had any portion of food, shut
themselves up in the most secret places of their dwellings,
swallowed the grain without crushing it, or glutted themselves
with raw flesh, for fear the odour of cooking it should
attract the inhuman inquisitors. Fleshless men, or rather
phantoms, with dried-up visages and hollow eyes, dragged
themselves along to corners, where famine speedily relieved
them by death. So great was the number of the dead, that
the living had neither strength nor courage to bury them!
There were no more tearsâthe general calamities had dried
up the source of them! No more sighs were heard; hunger
had stifled all the feelings of the soul! A famished multitude
ran hither and thither, and seized eagerly upon that which
would have been rejected by the most unclean animals. At
length, a woman, noble and rich, after being despoiled of everything
by her own want and the greedy fury of the mob, weary
of preparing food for these insatiable brigands, and left herself
without a morsel of nourishment, consumed by a devouring
hunger, proceeded, in her fury, to the most unheard-of
crimes. Stifling in her heart the cry of nature, she tore
from her bosom the infant she was supporting with her milk,
and, casting upon the innocent babe fierce and terrible
glances, âUnhappy little wretch!â exclaimed she, âwhy
wast thou born amidst war, famine, and seditious tumult?
Why dost thou still live? What fate awaits theeâservitude?
No; famine prevents it; and the implacable tyrants
who oppress us are still more to be dreaded than either the
one or the other. Die, then! and be food for thy famished
mother!â At these words, the maddened parent slaughtered
her child, cooked it, ate part of it, and carefully concealed
the rest. The mob, attracted by the odour of this
abhorrent feast, rushed in from all parts, and threatened to
kill the woman if she did not instantly show them the food
22

she had prepared. âI have saved you a good portion of it,â
said she, pointing to the mangled remains of her child. At
this spectacle, even they recoiled; human for the first time,
they remained silent and motionless; they could not believe
their eyes. âIt is my boy!â cried she; âI killed him:
surely you can eat after me. Are you more delicate than a
woman, or more tender than a mother? If ferocity has not
stifled every scruple within youâif you do hold such food
in horror, I will devour the rest myself.â Base and degraded
as they were, terrified at such a crime, they slunk
away from the house, cursing so detestable an action. The
report soon spread throughout the city; and every one was
as horror-struck as if he himself had perpetrated the frightful
deed. All wished for death, and envied those whom
famine had carried off without witnessing such a catastrophe.
The news reached the Roman camp; and Titus determined
to put an end to such crimes by a general assault.

An escalade of the Temple was undertaken, but the besieged
repulsed the Romans. The latter set fire to the porticos,
and the flames gained the galleries without the Jews making
the least attempt to extinguish them. At length the besieged
determined to make one last effort, and deliver themselves,
if possible, from an enemy who pressed them so
closely, or perish with swords in their hand, selling the
little life they had left dearly. They made an impetuous
sortie from a gate of the Temple, fell upon the Romans,
broke through their ranks, and would have driven them to
their camp, if Titus, who beheld the combat from the summit
of the fortress Antonia, had not flown promptly to
the succour of the vanquished. Fresh troops changed the
fortune of the day; the Jews were overwhelmed by numbers,
and constrained to shut themselves up in the Temple:
the prince commanded an assault for the next day. But, at
that moment, a soldier, without having received orders for
the attempt, and as if moved by a supernatural impulse,
prevailed upon a companion in arms to lift him up, and
threw a blazing brand into one of the windows of that vast
and superb edifice. The fire immediately caught some combustible
matter; the Jews perceived it, and uttering loud
cries, made strong but useless efforts to stop the conflagration.
Titus himself, with his army, hastened to assist in
23

extinguishing it. The excited soldier only thought of completing
his work, and, with another brand, defeated the
wishes and endeavours of his general: the flames consumed
everything, and this famous temple was reduced to ashes in
the second year of the reign of Vespasian. The Romans
made a great carnage; but the revolters, by a fresh attack,
retarded their destruction for a short time, and took up
cantonments in the city, and in the three towers, Hippicos,
Phazael, and Mariamne. The conquerors prepared to
besiege them, but, at the sight of the machines, the revolters
became intimidated, and sought for safety in precipitate
flight, leaving the Romans masters of everything: they
plundered the city, killed tens of thousands of the inhabitants,
and spread flame and destruction in all quarters.
Titus was declared imperator, an august title, which he
richly merited by his valour and generalship: he entered
Jerusalem in triumph, and admired the beauty and solidity
of the fortifications, but, with the exception of the three
towers, he caused them all to be destroyed. The accounts
given by some historians of the numbers of the slain and
the prisoners appear to us incredible; one statement avers
that there were eleven hundred thousand of the former, and
ninety-seven thousand of the latter. John was found concealed
in one of the city sewers, and was condemned to
perpetual imprisonment by the Romans. Simon was forced
to surrender, after a valiant defence; he formed part of the
triumph of the victor, and was afterwards publicly executed
at Rome. Eleazar, who retired to an untenable fortress,
destroyed himself. Jerusalem, which yielded in magnificence
to no city of Asiaâwhich Jeremiah styles
the admirable
city
, and David esteems
the most glorious and most
illustrious city of the East
, was thus, in the seventieth year
of the Christian era, razed to the ground, and presented
nothing but a heap of stones. The emperor Adrian afterwards
destroyed even its ruins, and caused another city to
be built, with the name of Ãlia, from his own, so that there
should be nothing left of the ancient Jerusalem. Christians
and Jews were equally banished from it; paganism exalted
its idols, and Jupiter and Venus had altars upon the tomb
of Christ. Amidst such reverses, the city of David was
nearly forgotten, when Constantine restored its name, recalled
24

the faithful, and made it a Christian colony. The
length and importance of this siege may be accounted for
by the strength of the fortifications. Its founders, says
Tacitus, having foreseen that the opposition of their manners
to those of other nations would be a source of war,
had given great attention to its defences, and, in the early
days of the Roman empire, it was one of the strongest
places in Asia.

The admirable account given by Josephus of the Roman
armies may serve as a lesson to all peoples until the arrival
of that happy millennium, when the lion shall lie down with
the lamb, and war shall be no more; that is, when man
has completely changed his nature, and has ceased to be
governed by his passions.

He says: âNow here we cannot but admire the precaution
of the Romans, in providing themselves with such household
servants as might not only serve at other times for the
common offices of life, but might also be of advantage to
them in their wars. And, indeed, if any one does but attend
to their military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that
their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition
of their valour, and not the bare gift of fortune; for they do
not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do
they then put their hands first into motion, while they
avoided so to do in time of peace; but, as if their weapons
did always cling to them, they have never any truce from
warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish
them to use them; for their military exercises differ not at
all from the real use of their arms, but every soldier is every
day exercised, and that with great diligence, as if it were in
time of war, which is the reason why they bear the fatigue
of battles so easily; for neither can any disorder remove
them from their usual regularity, nor can fear affright them
out of it, nor can labour tire them: which firmness of conduct
makes them always to overcome those that have not the
same firmness; nor would he be mistaken that should call
those their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody
exercises. Nor can their enemies easily surprise them with
the suddenness of their incursions; for, as soon as they have
marched into an enemyâs land, they do not begin to fight till
they have walled their camp about; nor is the defence they
25

can raise rashly made, or uneven; nor do they all abide in
it, nor do those that are in it take their places at random;
but if it happens that the ground is uneven, it is first
levelled: their camp is four-square by measure, and carpenters
are ready in great numbers with their tools, to erect
their buildings for them.â

Such was the
system
of the great ânation of the sword,â
differing, perhaps, but little, except in the scale upon which
it operated, from that of Sparta. The machines employed
by the Romans were the artificial tower, with its drawbridges,
catapultÃ¦, balistÃ¦, and rams; the weaponsâjavelins, darts,
arrows, pikes, stones, swords, and daggers, with the shield
or buckler.

EIGHTH SIEGE, A.D. 613.

In the reign of Heraclius, a countless host of Persiansâfire-worshippersâunder
the leadership of Sarbar, poured like
a torrent upon Palestine, and carried their ravages to the
gates of Jerusalem, of which they took possession. Nearly
a hundred thousand Christians perished on this occasion:
the great eastern inundations of hordes of barbarous conquerors,
being always effected by numbers, necessarily
produce an amount of carnage in the vanquished which is
sometimes staggering to our belief. But the loss most felt
by the Christians, was that of the holy cross, which the
conqueror carried away with him, in a case sealed with the
seal of Zacchariah, then Patriarch of Jerusalem. The Holy
Sepulchre and the churches were given up to the flames.

NINTH SIEGE, A.D. 635.

The Roman emperor soon regained possession of the
city; but scarcely was it beginning to recover the shock sustained
from the fire-worshippers, when it became the prey of
a much more powerful race of fanatics. In 635, the Saracens,
under the command of Khaled, the most redoubtable general
of Arabia, laid siege to it. The first attack lasted ten days,
and the Christians defended themselves with heroic courage.
During four months, every day brought its sanguinary conflict;
but at length, the unfortunate citizens, being without
hope of succour, yielded to the perseverance of the Mussulmans,
26

and by the means of the Patriarch Sophronius, capitulated
with the Caliph Omar in person. The following are
the conditions of this treaty, which afterwards served as a
model to the Mahometans: âIn the name of the All-Merciful
God, Omar Ebn-Alkhetlab, to the inhabitants of
Ãlia (the name given to it by its restorer, Ãlius Adrianus).
They shall be protected; they shall preserve their lives and
their property. Their churches shall not be destroyed, but
they shall erect no new ones, either in the city or its territories:
they alone shall enjoy the use of them. They shall
not prevent Mussulmans from entering them, by day or
night; the doors of them shall be open to passers-by and to
travellers. If any Mussulman, who may be travelling,
should pass through their city, he shall be entertained gratis
during three days. They shall not teach the Koran to their
children, they shall not speak publicly of their own religion,
and shall make no efforts to induce others to embrace it.
They shall not prevent their kindred from becoming Mussulmans,
if they should be so disposed; they shall show respect
to Mussulmans, and shall rise up when they wish to be
seated. They shall not be clothed like Mussulmans; they
shall not wear the same caps, shoes, or turbans. They shall
not part their hair as the Mussulmans do; they shall not
speak the same language, or be called by the same names.
On horseback, they shall use no saddles; they shall carry
no sort of arms, and shall not employ the Arabian language
in the inscriptions upon their seals. They shall not sell
wine; they shall be distinguished by the same description of
clothes, wherever they go, and shall always wear girdles.
They shall erect no crosses upon their churches, and they
shall not exhibit their crosses or their books publicly in the
streets of the Mussulmans. They shall not ring their bells,
but shall content themselves with tolling them. They shall
never take a domestic who has served a Mussulman.â
They were obliged to ratify this act of servitude, and to open
the gates to the Saracens, who took possession of their
conquest.

TENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1099.

We now come to one of the most remarkable sieges of
this extraordinary city. In the eleventh century, after a lapse
27

of four hundred years, during which it had passed from the
hands of the Saracens to those of the Seldjouc Turks, Jerusalem,
a Mahometan city, was beleaguered by the great
band of Christian adventurers who had left Europe for the
express purpose of delivering it. This is not the place to
dilate upon the subject of the Crusades; it is our business
to describe some of the sieges to which they gave rise.

Most readers are acquainted with the calamities of
various kinds which the Christians had to endure before
they could set an army down beneath the walls of this great
object of their enterprise. We shall take our account of
this awful struggle from the pages of a highly-accredited
historian, satisfied that no effort of our own could make it
more interesting or instructive.

With the earliest dawn, on the 10th of June, 1099, the
Crusaders ascended the heights of Emmaus. All at once
the Holy City lay before them. We can compare the cry
of the Crusaders, at this sight, to nothing but that of
âLand! land!â uttered by the companions of Columbus
when they completed their great discovery. âJerusalem!
Jerusalem!â was shouted from every lip, but was soon
repeated with bated breath and bended knee, when all that
belonged to that city recurred to the minds of the brave
adventurers. The rear ranks rushed through those that
preceded them, to behold the long-desired object, and their
war-cry, âGod wills it! God wills it!â re-echoed from the
Hill of Sion to the Mount of Olives. The horsemen
alighted humbly from their steeds, and walked barefoot.
Some cast themselves upon their knees, whilst others kissed
the earth rendered sacred by the presence of the Saviour.
In their transports they passed from joy to sorrow, from
sorrow to joy. At one moment they congratulated each
other at approaching the great end of their labours; in the
next they wept over their sins, over the death of Christ, and
over his profaned tomb; but all united in repeating the
oath they had so many times made, of delivering the city
from the sacrilegious yoke of the Mussulmans.

At the time of the Crusades, Jerusalem formed, as it does
now, a square, rather longer than broad, of a league in circumference.
It extended over four hills: on the east the
Moriah, upon which the mosque of Omar had been built, in
28

the place of the Temple of Solomon; on the south and west,
the Acra, which occupied the whole width of the city; on
the north, the Bezetha, or the new city; and on the north-west,
the Golgotha, or Calvary, which the Greeks considered
the centre of the world, and upon which the Church
of the Resurrection was built. In the state in which Jerusalem
then was, it had lost much of its strength and extent.
Mount Sion no longer rose within its precincts, and dominated
over the walls between the south and the west. The
three valleys which surrounded its ramparts had been in
many places filled up by Adrian, and access to the place
was much more difficult, particularly from the north.
Jerusalem, however, had had to sustain several sieges whilst
under the domination of the Saracens, and its fortifications
had not been neglected.

Whilst the Crusaders had been so slowly advancing
towards the city, the caliphâs lieutenant, Istekhar-Eddaulah,
ravaged the neighbouring plains, burnt the villages, filled up
or poisoned the cisterns, and made a desert of the spot upon
which the Christians were doomed to be given up to all
sorts of miseries. He brought in provisions for a long
siege, and called upon all Mussulmans to repair to the defence
of Jerusalem. Numberless workmen were employed,
day and night, in constructing machines of war, raising the
fallen walls, and repairing the towers. The garrison of the
city amounted to forty thousand men, and twenty thousand
inhabitants took up arms.

On the approach of the Christians, some detachments left
the city, to observe the march and plans of the enemy.
They were repulsed by Baldwin du Bourg and Tancred,
the latter hastening from Bethlehem, of which he had just
taken possession. After pursuing the fugitives to the gates
of the Holy City, he left his companions, and strayed alone
to the Mount of Olives, whence he contemplated at leisure
the city promised to the arms and devotion of the pilgrims.
He was disturbed in his pious contemplations by five Mussulmans,
who left the city for the purpose of attacking him.
Tancred did not seek to avoid the combat; three Saracens
fell beneath his powerful arm, and the other two fled back
to Jerusalem. Without hastening or retarding his steps,
Tancred rejoined the army, which, in its enthusiasm, was
29

advancing without order, and descended the heights of
Emmaus, singing the words of Isaiahââ
Jerusalem, lift up
thine eyes, and behold the liberator who cometh to break thy
chains!
â

On the day after their arrival, the Crusaders formed the
siege of the place. The Duke of Normandy, the Count of
Flanders, and Tancred, encamped upon the north, from the
gate of Herod to the gate of Sedar, or St. Stephen. Next
to these Flemings, Normans, and Italians, were placed the
English, commanded by Edgar Atheling; and the Bretons,
led by their duke, Alain Fergent, the Sire de ChÃ¢teau
Giron, and the Viscount de Dinan. Godfrey, Eustache, and
Baldwin du Bourg, established their quarters between the
west and the north, around the extent of Calvary, from the
gate of Damascus to the gate of Jaffa. The Count of
Toulouse planted his camp to the right of Godfrey, between
the south and the west; he had next him Raimbard
of Orange, William de Montpellier, and Gaston de BÃ©aru:
his troops extended at first along the declivity of Sion, but
a few days after he erected his tents upon the top of the
mountain, at the very spot where Christ celebrated the
Passover with his disciples. By these dispositions the Crusaders
left free the sides of the city which were defended,
on the south by the valley of Gihon, or SiloÃ«, and towards
the east by the valley of Josaphat.

Every step around Jerusalem recalled to the pilgrims
some remembrance dear to their religion. This territory,
so revered by the Christians, had neither valley nor rock
which had not a name in sacred history. Everything they
saw awakened or warmed their imagination. But that
which most inflamed the zeal of the Crusaders for the
deliverance of the city, was the arrival among them of a
great number of Christians, who, deprived of their property
and driven from their houses, came to seek succour and an
asylum amidst their brethren of the West. These Christians
described the persecutions which the worshippers of Christ
had undergone at the hands of the Mussulmans. The
women, children, and old men were detained as hostages;
all who were able to bear arms were condemned to labour
exceeding their strength. The head of the principal hospital
for pilgrims, together with a great number of Christians,
30

had been thrown into prison. The treasures of the churches
had been plundered to support the Mussulman soldiery.
The patriarch Simeon was gone to Cyprus, to implore the
charity of the faithful to save his flock from threatened
destruction, if he did not pay the enormous tribute imposed
by the oppressors of the Holy City. Every day the Christians
of Jerusalem were loaded with fresh outrages; and
several times the infidels had formed the project of giving
them up to the flames, and completely destroying the Holy
Sepulchre, with the Church of the Resurrection. The
Christian fugitives, whilst making these doleful recitals to
the warlike pilgrims, earnestly exhorted them to attack
Jerusalem. In the early days of the siege, an anchorite,
who had fixed his retreat upon the Mount of Olives, came
to join his entreaties to those of the banished Christians, to
persuade the Crusaders to proceed to an immediate assault;
he urged his suit in the name of Christ, of whom he declared
himself the interpreter. The Crusaders, who had neither
ladders nor machines of war, gave themselves up to the
counsels of the pious hermit, and believed that their courage
and their good swords would suffice to overthrow the ramparts
of the Saracens. The leaders, who had seen such
prodigies enacted by the valour and enthusiasm of the
Christian soldiers, and who had not forgotten the prolonged
miseries of the siege of Antioch, yielded without difficulty
to the impatience of the army; in addition to which, the
sight of Jerusalem had exalted the spirits of the Crusaders,
and rendered the least credulous hopeful that God would
second their bravery by miracles.

At the first signal, the Christian army advanced in good
order towards the ramparts. Never, say historians, was so
much ardour witnessed in the soldiers of the Cross; some,
serried in close battalions, covered themselves with their
bucklers, which formed an impenetrable vault over their
heads, and gave their utmost efforts to shake the walls
with pikes and hammers; whilst others, ranged in long
files, remained at some distance, employing slings and cross-bows
to drive away the enemies from the ramparts.
Boiling oil and pitch, immense stones and enormous timbers,
fell upon the first ranks of the Christians, without stopping
their labours. The outward wall had already crumbled
31

beneath their blows, but the interior wall presented an
invincible object. Escalade was the only means left. This
bold method was attempted, although they could only find
one ladder long enough to reach the top of the walls. The
bravest mounted it, and fought hand to hand with the
Saracens, who were astonished at such audacity. The
Crusaders would most probably have entered Jerusalem
that very day, if they had had the necessary war instruments
and machines; but the small number who were able to
attain the top of the walls could not maintain themselves
there. Bravery was useless; Heaven did not accord the
miracles promised by the hermit, and the Saracens at length
forced the assailants to retreat.

The Christians returned to their camp, deploring their
imprudence and their credulity. This first reverse taught
them that they could not reckon upon prodigies, and that
they must, before they could expect to succeed, construct
some machines of war. But it was difficult to procure the
necessary wood in a country which presented nothing but
barren sand and arid rocks. Several detachments were sent
to search for wood in the neighbouring plains. Chance led
them to the discovery of some immense beams in the depths
of a cavern, and Tancred had them transported to the camp.
They demolished all the houses and churches that had
escaped the flames; and every stick of wood that the
Saracens had not destroyed, was employed in the construction
of the machines. Notwithstanding the discoveries, the work
did not keep pace with the impatience of the Crusaders, or
prevent the evils which threatened the Christian army. The
great summer heats commenced at the very time the pilgrims
arrived before Jerusalem. A blazing sun, and southern
winds laden with the sands of the desert, heated the atmosphere
to an intolerable degree. Plants and animals perished;
the torrent of Cedron was dried up; all the cisterns around
were either choked or poisoned. Beneath a sky of fire,
in a burning and arid country, the Christian army soon
found itself a prey to all the horrors of thirst.

The fountain of SiloÃ«, which only flowed at intervals,
could not suffice for the multitude of pilgrims. A skin of
fetid water, fetched three leagues, was worth two silver
deniers. Overcome by thirst and heat, the soldiers were
32

seen digging the soil with their swords, thrusting their
hands into the freshly-turned earth, and eagerly carrying
the humid particles to their parched lips. During the day,
they anxiously looked for night; and during the night,
panted for dawn, in the ever-disappointed hope that the
return of the one or the other would bring some degree of
freshness or some drops of rain. Every morning they were
to be seen gluing their burning lips to the marbles which
were covered with dew. During the heat of the day the
most robust languished under their tents, without having
even strength to implore Heaven for relief.

The knights and barons were in no respect exempt from
the scourge under which the army suffered; and many of
them daily exchanged for water the treasures obtained from
the infidels. âThe grief of this extreme thirst,â says the
old translator of William of Tyre, âwas not so great for
the foot soldiers as for the horsemen; the foot soldier
could content himself with a little, but the horsemen could
only satisfy their horses with copious draughts. As to the
beasts of burden, there was no more account taken of them
than of so many dead creatures; they were allowed to
wander away at will, and died of thirst.â

In this state of general misery, the women and children
dragged themselves about the country in search of a spring
or cooling shades which had no existence. Many of these,
wandering too far from the army, fell into the ambuscades
of the Saracens, and lost either their lives or their liberty.
When a pilgrim discovered a spring or a cistern in a
secluded spot, he concealed it from his companions, or forbade
their approaching it. Violent quarrels arose in consequence,
and it was not uncommon to see the soldiers of
the Cross contending, sword in hand, for a little muddy
water. The want of water was so insupportable, that
famine was scarcely perceived or thought of: the heats of
thirst and of the climate made them careless of food.

If the besieged had then made a spirited sortie, they
would have easily triumphed over the Crusaders; but the
latter were defended by the remembrance of their exploits,
and, however great their distress, their name alone still
inspired terror among the Saracens. The Mussulmans
might, likewise, well believe that their enemies could not
33

long resist the double scourge of hunger and thirst. In
fact, their situation became so dreadful, that the object of
their enterprise was lost to their minds; they not only
forgot the Holy City, but their God. And then came
thoughts of the homes they had left; and many, deserting
the colours they had fought so bravely under, fled away to
the ports of Palestine and Syria, to watch for an opportunity
of returning to Europe.

The leaders were fully aware there was no other remedy
for the ills they laboured under but the capture of Jerusalem;
but the labours of the siege went on slowly; they
had not yet enough wood for the construction of machines;
they wanted labourers and the necessary implements. We
cannot help being here struck with the difference between
an army governed by one strong mind and will, and one
under fifty commanders, as this of the Crusaders was.
When Titus wanted a wall built round the city, his legions
did it in three days; the Crusaders complained of scarcity
of labourers for the erection of a few machines. From the
first Crusade to the last, this was the cause of failure;
every captain was a private adventurer; he acknowledged
no sovereign commander, and was at all times governed by
what he thought to be his own private interests: there was
scarcely ever any unity of view or action.

The wisest and the bravest, in such a critical situation,
were beginning to despair of the success of the holy enterprise,
when they were cheered by a succour as welcome as
it was unexpected. They learned that a Genoese fleet had
entered the port of Joppa, laden with provisions and munitions
of all kinds. This news spread joy throughout the
Christian army; a body of three hundred men left the camp
to go and meet the convoy, which Heaven appeared to have
sent to the Crusaders in their misery. The detachment,
after having beaten the Saracens they met with on their
passage, entered the city of Joppa, which had been abandoned
by its inhabitants, and was occupied by the Genoese.
The Crusaders learnt that the Genoese fleet had been surprised
and burnt by that of the Saracens, but that they had
had time to secure the provisions, and a great number of
implements and tools. All that was saved was safely conveyed
to the camp; and it afforded the Crusaders additional
34

joy to find that the welcome supply was attended by a great
number of Genoese engineers and carpenters.

As wood was still short for the construction of the
machines, a Syrian conducted the Duke of Normandy and
the Count of Flanders to a mountain situated thirty miles
from Jerusalem. It was here the Christians found the
forest of which Tasso speaks in the âJerusalem Delivered.â
The trees of this forest were not forbidden to the axe of the
Crusaders, either by the enchantment of Ismen, or the arms
of the Saracens: cars drawn by oxen transported it in
triumph to the walls of Jerusalem.

All the leaders except Raymond of Toulouse were in
want of money to pay for the labours they had commanded.
The zeal and charity of the pilgrims came to their relief;
many offered all they had left of the booty conquered from
the enemy; knights and barons themselves became laborious
workmen; all at length were employedâeverything in the
army was in movement: women, children, and even the
sick, shared the labours of the soldiers. Whilst the most
robust were occupied in the construction of rams, catapultas,
and covered galleries, others fetched in skins the water they
drew from the fountain of Elperus, on the road to Damascus,
or from the rivulet which flowed on the other side of Bethlehem,
towards the desert of St. John; some prepared the
skins which were to be stretched over the machines to make
them proof against fire; whilst others traversed the neighbouring
plains and mountains, to collect branches of the
olive and fig trees to make hurdles and fascines.

Although the Christians had still much to suffer from
thirst and the heat of the climate, the hope of soon seeing
an end to their labours gave them strength to support them.
The preparations for the assault were pressed on with
incredible activity; every day some new formidable machine
threatened the ramparts of the Saracens. Their construction
was directed by Gaston of BÃ©arn, of whose bravery
and skill historians speak loudly. Among these machines
were three enormous towers of a new form, each having
three stages: the first destined for the workmen who
directed the movements of it, and the second and third for
the warriors who were to make the assault. These rolling
fortresses rose to a greater height than the walls of the
35

besieged city; on the top was a species of drawbridge, which
could be lowered on to the ramparts and form a road into
the place.

But these powerful means of attack were not the only
ones which were to second the efforts of the Crusaders.
The religious enthusiasm which had already performed such
prodigies, again lent its influence to augment their ardour
and confidence in victory. The clergy, spreading themselves
through the quarters, exhorted the pilgrims to penitence and
concord. Misery, which always gives birth to complaints
and murmurs, had soured their hearts; it had sown divisions
between the leaders and the soldiers, who at other
times had quarrelled for cities and treasures, but for whom
now things the most common had become objects of jealousy
and strife. The solitary from the Mount of Olives added
his exhortations to those of the clergy; and, addressing the
princes and people,ââYou who are come,â said he, âfrom
the far regions of the West to worship the God of armies,
love each other like brethren, and sanctify yourselves by
repentance and good works. If you obey the laws of God,
He will render you masters of the holy city; if you resist
Him, all His anger will fall upon you.â The solitary advised
the Crusaders to make the tour of Jerusalem, invoking
the mercy and protection of Heaven.

The pilgrims, persuaded that the gates of the city were
not less likely to open to devotion than bravery, listened
with docility to the exhortations of the hermit, whose counsel
they conceived to be the language of God himself. After
a rigorous fast of three days, they left their quarters, in
arms, and marched barefooted, with heads uncovered,
around the walls of the holy city. They were preceded by
their priests clothed in white, bearing the images of saints,
and singing psalms and spiritual songs; the ensigns were
unfurled, and the drums and trumpets called the echoes from
the hills and valleys. It was thus the Hebrews had formerly
made the tour of Jericho, whose walls crumbled away
at the sound of their instruments.

The Crusaders set out from the valley of Rephraim, which
is opposite Calvary; they advanced towards the north, and,
on entering the valley of Josophat, saluted the tombs of
Mary, St. Stephen, and
the first elect of God
. Whilst continuing
36

their march towards the Mount of Olives, they contemplated
with respect the grotto in which Christ shed the
sweat of blood, and the spot where the Saviour of the world
wept over Jerusalem. When they arrived at the summit of
the mountain, the most imposing spectacle presented itself
to their eyes: on the east they beheld the plains of Jericho,
the shores of the Dead Sea, and the banks of the Jordan;
on the west, the holy city lay at their feet, with its territory
strewn with sacred ruins: assembled on the very spot
whence Christ ascended into Heaven, and where they
anxiously looked for the vestiges of his steps, they listened
to the exhortations of their priests and bishops. Arnoul de
RohÃ©s, chaplain to the Duke of Normandy, addressed them
in a pathetic discourse, conjuring them to redouble their
zeal and perseverance. In terminating his address, he
turned towards Jerusalem: âYou behold,â said he, âthe
heritage of Christ defiled by the impious: here is at length
the worthy reward of all your labours: these are the places
in which God will pardon you all your sins and bless your
victories.â At the voice of the orator, who pointed to the
Church of the Resurrection and the rocks of Calvary ready
to receive them, the defenders of the Cross humbled themselves
before God, and fixed their looks intensely upon
Jerusalem.

As Arnoul pressed them in the name of Christ to pardon
injuries and to love one another, Tancred and Raymond,
who had long had differences, embraced in the presence
of the whole army; the soldiers and other leaders followed
their example. The rich promised to assist with their alms
the poor and the orphans who bore the cross. All forgot
their fatal discords, and swore to remain faithful to the
precepts of evangelic charity.

Whilst the Crusaders were thus giving themselves up to
transports of devotion and piety, the Saracens assembled
upon the ramparts raised high in the air crosses, which they
loaded with outrages; they insulted the ceremonies of the
Christians by their gestures and clamours. âYou hear,â
exclaimed Peter the hermit, âyou hear the menaces and
blasphemies of the enemies of the true God; swear to defend
Christ, a prisoner and crucified a second time by the infidels.
You behold him expiring a second time on Calvary for the
37

redemption of your sins.â At these words, the cenobite
was interrupted by the cries and groans of indignation which
arose on all parts around him. âYes, I swear by your
piety,â continued the orator, âI swear by your arms, the
reign of the impious draws near to its end. The army of the
Lord has only to appear, and all that vain mass of Mussulmans
will fade away like a shadow. To-day full of pride
and insolence, to-morrow they will be frozen with terror,
and will fall motionless before you, as did the guardians of
the sepulchre, who felt their weapons escape from their
hands, and sunk dead with fear when an earthquake announced
the presence of a God upon Calvary, where you
are about to mount to the breach. Yet a few moments, and
those towersâthe last bulwarks of the infidelsâwill be the
asylum of Christians; those mosques, which rise upon Christian
ruins, will serve as temples to the true God, and Jerusalem
will once again listen to nothing but the praises of
the Lord.â

At these last words of Peter, the most lively transports
burst from the Crusaders; they embraced again and again,
with tears pouring down their embrowned cheeks, exhorting
each other to support the evils and fatigues of which they
were about to receive the glorious reward. The Christians
then came down from the Mount of Olives to return to their
camp, and, taking their route towards the south, saluted on
their right the tomb of David, and passed close to the Pool
of SiloÃ«, where Christ restored sight to the blind; they perceived
at a distance the ruins of the palace of Juda, and
marched along the declivity of Mount Sion, where other
remembrances added to their enthusiasm. Towards evening,
the Christian army regained their quarters, repeating the
words of the prophet,ââ
They of the West shall fear the
Lord, and they of the East shall behold His glory
.â When
they had re-entered the camp, most of the pilgrims passed
the night in prayer; the leaders and the soldiers confessed
their sins at the feet of their priests, and received their
God, whose promises filled them with confidence and
hope.

Whilst matters were going on thus in the camp, the most
profound silence reigned around the walls of Jerusalem,
only broken by the voices issuing from hour to hour from
38

the minarets of the mosques, to call the faithful to prayer.
The infidels flocked in crowds to their temples to implore
the protection of their prophet, and swore by the mysterious
stone of Jacob to defend a city, which they called
the house
of God
. The besieged and the besiegers were stimulated
by the same ardour to fight and shed their blood: the former
to preserve Jerusalem, the latter to make the conquest
of it. The hatred which animated them was so violent, that,
during the whole of the siege, no deputed Mussulman came
to the camp of the Christians, and the Christians never
once deigned to summon the garrison to surrender. Between
such enemies, the shock must be terrible and the
victory implacable.

It was resolved, in a council of the leaders, to take advantage
of the enthusiasm whilst it was at its height, and
execute the assault. As the Saracens displayed a great
number of machines on the sides of the city which appeared
to be most threatened by the Christians, it was determined
to change the dispositions of the siege, and that the principal
attack should be directed towards the points where
the enemy had made no preparations for defence.

During the night Godfrey removed his quarters to the
eastward, towards the gate of Cedar, not far from the valley
in which Titus encamped when his soldiers penetrated into
the galleries of the temple. The rolling tower, and the
other machines of war which the Duke of Lorraine had
caused to be built, were transported, with incredible efforts,
in front of the walls he wished to attack. Tancred and the
two Roberts drew up their machines between the gate of
Damascus and the angular tower, which was afterwards
called
Tancredâs Tower
.

At break of day the Saracens, on beholding these new
dispositions, were seized with astonishment and terror.
The Crusaders might have taken advantage of the confusion
inspired in this change; but upon a steep ground it was
difficult to bring their machines close to the walls. Raymond,
in particular, who was charged with the attack on the south,
found himself separated from the ramparts by a ravine,
which it was necessary for him to fill up. He caused it to
be proclaimed by a herald that he would pay a denier to
every person who would cast three stones into it. A crowd
39

of people instantly flocked to the aid of the soldiers,âa
shower of darts and arrows from the ramparts producing no
effect upon the ardour and zeal of the labourers. At length,
by the end of the third day, all was completed, and the
leaders gave the signal for a general assault.

On Thursday, the 14th of July, 1099, as soon as day
appeared, the clarions resounded in the camp of the Christians;
all the Crusaders flew to arms; all the machines were
put in motion at once; pedereros and mangonnels vomited a
shower of stones against the enemy; whilst, protected by
the tortoises and covered galleries, the rams were brought
up close to the walls. The archers and cross-bowmen kept
up a continuous discharge at the ramparts, whilst the bravest,
covered with their bucklers, planted ladders in places where
the walls appeared most assailable. On the south, the east,
and the north of the city, the three rolling towers advanced
towards the ramparts, amidst tumultuous noise, and the
shouts of the workmen and soldiers. Godfrey appeared
upon the highest platform of his wooden fortress, accompanied
by his brother Eustache, and Baldwin du Bourg.
He animated his men by his example; every javelin he
hurled, say the historians of the times, carried death to a
Saracen. Raymond, Tancred, the Duke of Normandy, and
the Count of Flanders fought amongst their soldiers; the
knights and men-at-arms were animated by the same ardour
as the principal leaders, and eagerly sought every point
where danger threatened most.

Nothing could equal the fury of the first charge of the
Christians, but it everywhere met with an obstinate resistance.
Arrows, javelins, boiling oil, the Greek fire, and
fourteen machines, which the besieged had had time to
oppose to those of their enemies, repelled on all sides the
attack and the efforts of the assailants. The infidels, issuing
by a breach made in their rampart, attempted to burn the
machines of the besiegers, and spread disorder throughout
the Christian army. Towards the end of the day the towers
of Godfrey and Tancred could not be made to move; Raymondâs
had sunk into ruins. The combat had lasted twelve
hours without victory appearing to be at all inclined to
favour the Crusaders;ânight separated the combatants.
The Christians returned to their camp, trembling with rage
40

and grief; the leaders, particularly the two Roberts, could
not console themselves, from the idea
that God had not yet
thought them worthy to enter the Holy City, and worship the
tomb of his Son
.

The night was passed on both sides in a state of anxious
inquietude, each deploring their losses, and trembling at
the prospect of fresh ones. The Saracens expected a
surprise; the Christians feared that the Saracens would
burn the machines they had left at the foot of the ramparts.
The besieged were employed in repairing the breaches made
in their walls; the besiegers in attempting to put their machines
in a state for another attack. The following day
brought the same combats and the same dangers as the
preceding one. The leaders endeavoured to revive the
courage of the Crusaders by their speeches. The priests
and bishops went among the tents of the soldiers, announcing
the certain succour of Heaven. The Christian army,
filled with new confidence in victory, appeared under arms,
and advanced in silence towards the points of attack, whilst
the clergy walked in procession round the city.

The first shock was impetuous and terrible. The Christians,
indignant at the resistance they had met with the
day before, fought with fury. The besieged, who had learnt
the arrival of an Egyptian army, were animated by the
hopes of victory; formidable machines covered their ramparts.
Javelins were heard hissing on all sides; stones and
large timbers, launched by the Christians and the infidels,
met in the air with a fearful crash, and fell upon the assailants.
From the height of their towers the Mussulmans
incessantly hurled blazing torches and fire-pots. The
wooden fortresses of the Christians approached the walls
amidst a conflagration which seemed spreading in all directions.
The infidels directed most of their efforts against
the tower of Godfrey, upon which glittered a cross of gold,
the sight of which provoked their fury and their insults.
The Duke of Lorraine had seen one of his esquires and
several of his soldiers fall by his side; himself a mark for all
the arrows and darts of the enemy, he fought on amidst the
dead and the wounded, never ceasing to shout encouragement
to his companions in arms. The Count of Toulouse,
who attacked the city on the south side, opposed all his
41

machines to those of the Mussulmans; he had to contend
with the Emir of Jerusalem, who animated his troops by
his words, and showed himself upon the walls, surrounded
by the
Ã©lite
of the Egyptian soldiery. Towards the north,
Tancred and the two Roberts appeared at the head of their
battalions. Motionless upon their rolling fortress, they
looked impatient to be wielding lance and sword. Already
their rams had, upon several points, shaken the wall,
behind which the Saracens closed their ranks, and presented
themselves as a last rampart to the attack of the
Crusaders.

In the midst of the combat, say the historians, two female
magicians appeared upon the ramparts of the city, appealing
to the elements and the powers of hell. They were not
able to avoid the death they invoked upon the Christians,
and fell beneath a shower of arrows and stones. Two
Egyptian emissaries, who had come from Ascalon to exhort
the besieged to defend themselves, were surprised by the
Crusaders as they were seeking to obtain entrance into the
city. One of them fell, covered with wounds; the other,
after having revealed the secret of his mission, was launched,
by means of a machine, on to the ramparts where the
Saracens were fighting.

The combat had lasted half the day, without the Crusaders
being able to entertain any hope of penetrating into
the place. All their machines were on fire; they wanted
water, but more particularly vinegar, which alone had the
power to extinguish the kind of fire launched at them by
the besieged. In vain the bravest exposed themselves to
the greatest dangers, to prevent the destruction of all the
wooden machines and the rams; they fell, buried under the
ruins, and the raging flames devoured even their bucklers
and their vestments. Many of the most intrepid warriors
had found death at the foot of the ramparts; a great
number of those mounted on the towers had been placed

hors de combat
; others, covered with sweat and dust,
smothered with heat, and staggering under the weight of
their armour, began to lose courage. The Saracens, who
perceived this, uttered loud cries of joy. In their blasphemies,
they reproaching the Christians with adoring a
God who was not able to help them. The assailants deplored
42

their lot, and, believing themselves abandoned by
Christ, remained motionless on the field of battle.

But the combat was about to change its character. All
at once the Crusaders beheld, on the Mount of Olives, a
horseman, waving his buckler, and giving the Christian
army the signal to enter the city. Godfrey and Raymond,
who perceived him first, and at the same moment, cried out
that St. George was come to the succour of the Christians.
The tumult of the fight allowed of neither reflection nor
examination, and the sight of the celestial horseman fired
the besiegers with fresh ardour. They returned to the
charge; even the women, the children, and the sick crowded
into the
mÃªlÃ©e
, bringing water, food, and arms, and uniting
their efforts with those of the soldiers to get the rolling
towers, the dread of the enemy, nearer to the walls. That
of Godfrey advanced, amidst a terrible discharge of stones,
arrows, and Greek fire, and let fall its drawbridge upon the
wall. Fiery darts flew at one and the same time against
the machines of the besiegers, and against the sacks of
straw and hay, and the bales of wool which covered the
inner walls of the city. The wind kindled the fires, and
drove the flames full upon the Saracens, who, enveloped in
fire and smoke, recoiled at the aspect of the lances and
swords of the Christians. Godfrey, preceded by the two
brothers Lethalde and Engelbert of Tournay, and followed
by Baldwin du Bourg, Eustache, Raimbaud, CrÃ©ton, Guicher,
Bernard de St. Vallier, and Amenjeu dâAlbret, broke through
the enemy, pursued them, and rushed with them into Jerusalem.
The brave men who had fought upon the platform
of the tower with their intrepid leader, followed them into
the streets, and massacred all they met with on their
passage.

SIEGE OF JERUSALEM.âGODFREY OF BOUILLON.

At the same time a report was spread in the Christian
army, that the holy pontiff Adhemar, and several Crusaders
who had died during the siege, had appeared at the head of
the assailants, and unfurled the banners of the Cross upon
the towers of Jerusalem. Tancred and the two Roberts,
animated by this account, made fresh efforts, and threw
themselves into the place, accompanied by Hugh de St. Paul,
Gerard de Roussillon, Louis de Mousson, Conon and Lambert
de Montargis, and Gaston de BÃ©arn. A crowd of
43

heroes follow them closely; some enter by a half-open
breach, others scale the walls with ladders, many spring
from the wooden towers. The Mussulmans fly on all sides,
and Jerusalem resounds with the victory-cry of the Crusaders,

God wills it! God wills it!
The companions of
Godfrey and Tancred hew down the gate of St. Stephen
with axes, and the city lies open to the crowd of Crusaders,
who press upon each other, and dispute the honour of
inflicting the last blow upon the infidels.

Raymond alone met with some resistance. Made aware
of the victory of the Christians by the cries of the Mussulmans,
the clash of arms, and the tumult from the interior of
the city, he roused the courage of his soldiers. These brave
men, impatient to join their companions, abandoned their
tower and their machines, which they could no longer move.
They planted their ladders, and sticking their swords into
the walls as steps, they mounted to the ramparts; they were
preceded by the Count de Toulouse, Raymond Pelet, the
Bishop of Bira, the Count de Die, and William de Sabran.
Nothing could now stop them; they dispersed the Saracens,
who, with their Emir, flew for refuge to the fortress of
David; and soon all the Crusaders in Jerusalem met together,
embraced, wept with joy, and gave all their attention
to securing their victory.

In the mean time despair had for a moment rallied the
bravest of the Saracens; they fell with impetuosity upon
the Christians, who were advancing in disorder, bent upon
pillage. The latter were beginning to give way before the
enemy they had conquered, when Evrard de Preysaie, whose
bravery Ralph of CaÃ«n has celebrated, revived the courage
of his companions, placed himself at their head, and once
more carried terror among the infidels. From that moment
the Crusaders had no longer an enemy to contend with.

History has remarked that the Christians entered Jerusalem
on a Friday, at three oâclock in the afternoon, which
was the day and the hour at which Christ expired for the
salvation of mankind. This memorable epoch ought to have
recalled to their hearts a feeling of mercy; but, irritated by
the menaces and long insults of the Saracens, exasperated
by the various ills they had undergone during the siege, and
the resistance they had met with, even in the city, they
44

filled the Jerusalem they came to deliver, and which they
considered as their future country, with blood and mourning.
The carnage was soon general, such as escaped the swords
of the soldiers of Godfrey and Tancred, becoming the victims
of the ProvenÃ§als, equally thirsty for blood. The Saracens
were indiscriminately massacred in the streets and in their
houses; Jerusalem had no asylum for the vanquished; some
tried to escape death by precipitating themselves from the
ramparts, whilst others ran in crowds to seek refuge in the
palaces, the towers, and particularly in the mosques, but
nowhere could they escape the murderous pursuit of the
Christians.

The Crusaders, masters of the Mosque of Omar, in which
the Saracens had defended themselves for a short time,
repeated the scenes of carnage which had followed and
sullied the conquest of Titus. Foot and horse entered the
sacred structure
pÃªle-mÃªle
with the vanquished. Amidst the
most horrible tumult the place re-echoes with cries and
groans of death; the conquerors trampled upon heaps of
slain in pursuit of such as endeavoured to escape. Raymond
dâAgiles, an eye-witness, says that beneath the
portico and in the front court of the Temple the blood
ascended to the knees and the bridles of the horses. To
paint this terrible spectacle, which war presented twice in
the same place, it will suffice to say, in the words of
Josephus, that the number of the slain exceeded by far
that of the soldiers who immolated them to their vengeance,
and that the echoes of the mountains neighbouring the
Jordan repeated the groans and cries that issued from the
Temple.

The imagination turns with disgust from these horrible
pictures, and can scarcely, amid the carnage, contemplate
the Christians of Jerusalem whose chains the Crusaders
had broken. They crowded from all parts to meet the conquerors;
they shared with them the provisions they had
been able to keep from the Saracens; and all together were
thankful to the God who had crowned the arms of the
Christians with such a triumph. The hermit Peter, who,
five years before, had promised to arm the West for the
deliverance of the Christians of Jerusalem, must have
experienced inexpressible delight in witnessing their gratitude
45

and joy. They appeared to consider no one among
the Crusaders but him; they recalled his words and his
promises; it was to him they addressed their songs of
praise; it was him they proclaimed their liberator; they
related to him all they had suffered during his absence;
they could scarcely believe that he stood before them; and,
in their enthusiasm, they expressed astonishment that God
should have employed one man alone to rouse so many
nations and effect such prodigies.

The sight of the brethren they had delivered, no doubt,
reminded the pilgrims that they had come for the purpose
of worshipping the tomb of Jesus Christ. The pious
Godfrey, who had abstained from slaughter as soon as the
victory was certain, quitted his companions, and, followed
by two attendants, repaired, without arms and barefoot, to
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The news of this purpose
of devotion soon spread through the Christian army,
and immediately all fury, all vengeance, were appeased; the
Crusaders, stripping off their blood-stained vestments, made
Jerusalem resound with their sobs and groans, and, led by
the clergy, they marched in a body, barefoot and with
uncovered heads, towards the Church of the Resurrection.

When the Christian army was thus assembled upon
Calvary, night began to fall; silence reigned in the public
places and upon the ramparts; nothing was to be heard in
the Holy City but canticles of penitence, and the words of
Isaiah, â
You who love Jerusalem, rejoice you with her!
â
The Crusaders evinced so much devotion that, according to
the remark of a modern historian, it might be thought that
these men who had just taken a city by assault, and committed
a horrible carnage, really came from a long retreat
and a profound meditation upon religious mysteries. These
inexplicable contrasts are often remarked in the history of
the Crusades. Some writers have fancied they found in
them a pretext for an accusation against the Christian
religion; others, not less blind or less prejudiced, attempt
to excuse the deplorable excesses of fanaticism: the impartial
historian is satisfied with relating them, and sighs in
silence over the weaknesses of human nature.

Besides, this pious fervour was soon burnt out, and only
suspended the scenes of carnage for awhile; policy and
46

cupidity soon led to fresh horrors, and fanaticism most ably
seconded them. All whom humanity or lassitude of carnage
had spared, or even some who had been saved in the hopes
of a rich ransom, were slaughtered. The Saracens were
forced to precipitate themselves from the tops of their
houses; they perished by thousands in the flames; they
were dragged into the public places, and immolated upon
the heaps of slain which already encumbered them. Neither
the tears of women, the cries of infants, nor the aspect of
the Holy Places, where Christ had pardoned his executioners,
had power to soften the irritated conquerors. The
carnage was so great, that heaps of bodies were not only
seen in the palaces, the temples, and the streets, but were
found in the most secluded and solitary places. Such was
the delirium of vengeance, cupidity, and fanaticism, that
the scenes did not disgust beholders who might be supposed
to be impartial: contemporary historians describe
them without offering a word of excuse, and throughout
their recitals of revolting events, a single expression of
horror or pity does not escape them. We, however, cannot
pursue the frightful details further. The carnage lasted
for a full week, and the Oriental and Latin historians agree
in stating that the numbers of Mussulmans slain in Jerusalem
amounted to more than seventy thousand! The
Jews experienced no more mercy than the Saracens: they
took refuge in their synagogue; the Crusaders set fire to
the building, and all perished in the flames.

Such was the ever-memorable capture of Jerusalem by
the Crusaders. The reflections it gives rise to are too
numerous, too complicated, and too interesting to be ventured
upon in such a work as this; we must be satisfied
with having given principally, in the words of an elegant
historian, an account of the siege. We perceive the same
weapons, the same machines, the same natural objects of
offence and defence, that are to be found in other sieges.
The terraces of Titus became the rolling towers of the
Middle Ages; but the ancient instruments, the ram, catapultÃ¦,
and the cross-bow, were still in full force. Although
there was a body of English in the army, we hear nothing
of their national weapon, the long-bow. Jerusalem, from
its situation, was wanting in a moat or ditch; if it had had a
47

broad one, it would have very much increased the difficulties
of the besiegers. Objects in themselves apparently unconnected
with the art of war, seem to have been freely made
use of; boiling oil, melted pitch, and huge beams were had
recourse to by the besieged. We likewise hear of the
Greek fire, but there are not so many miracles attached to
its effects as in some sieges. The Asiatics despised no
natural means of defence that offered themselves; in one of
the minor sieges of the Crusades, they adopted a very ingenious
and effective mode of annoyance. The country round
was famous for the production of honey, and the citizens
had vast apiaries. When the ladders were planted, and
the Crusaders commenced the assault, the inhabitants
brought all the bee-hives they could collect, and precipitated
them and their swarms of little armed warriors amidst
the assailing host. The effect may be more easily imagined
than described.

ELEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1187.

The siege we have last described gave birth to one of the
shortest-lived and most troublous monarchies that is to be
found in the pages of history. One or two good monarchs
are met with in its short annals of eighty-eight years, the
rest were either wicked or imbecile, and only hastened the
fall which naturally attended its peculiar construction and
existence. The state of Jerusalem when the errors of its
rulers brought upon it the vengeance of Saladinâperhaps
the greatest man that ever figured in the East,âwas disgraceful
beyond description; the two great principles which
really drew the Crusaders from their homes,â
military glory
and cupidity
, during the few years of this kingdom upon
which all the world was supposed to have its attention fixed,âwere
in constant operation to precipitate its downfall.
The stormy passions, inseparable from a feudal government,
had weakened all the resources of the nominal government.
The king was a shadow, totally without power: he could
neither avenge his own injuries, nor those of either the
state or religion. Want of bravery was the only crime he
could punish: because cowards found no patrons amongst
the barons: they were useless to them, and they were heedless
48

of their fate. The king was totally without the first
prerogatives of royalty; he had not the power to support
justice or make the laws of nations respected: the kingdom
was covered with strong castles, whose commanders scarcely
acknowledged any fealty to the king; the summits of the
mountains were crowned with threatening towers, and the
caverns at their feet even were converted into fortresses, in
which the barons commanded as masters, and made peace or
war at their will. The military orders, given up to profligacy,
luxury, and thirst of wealth, were divided among
themselves, and frequently shed blood in quarrels that were
most fatal to the Christians. Discord prevailed between the
clergy of Jerusalem and the knights of the Temple and of
St. John; the military orders were not subject to ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, and the clergy, accustomed to give laws to
princes, could not endure the haughty independence of these
warriors. The Hospitallers built houses in front of the
Church of the Resurrection, for the purpose of annoying the
clergy, and even went so far as to amuse themselves with
shooting arrows at the holy fathers as they entered the
church.

The inhabitants and the Crusaders seldom agreed long
together; booty being the object of every new-comer,
the people were his readiest victims, under the pretence of
defending them against the infidels. The maritime cities
were divided into ruinous national parties; the barons and
knights were weakened by idleness and debauchery, and
could only be roused to exertion by the hopes of plunder
and booty: the love of glory and the cause of Christ were
forgotten. They no longer asked what enemy they were to
attack, what ally they were to defend, but what province
was to be given up to pillage. Some of the leaders, even in
the most perilous circumstances of the state, abandoned
their standards, and sold their inaction or their neutrality.
Others went so far as even to plunder the Christian provinces,
or sell their active services to the Saracens.

Religion had lost all hold upon menâs minds, and principally
by the immorality of the churchmen. It was said by
a respectable historian, that there was scarcely one chaste
woman in Jerusalem. The leaders of the Christian colonies
and the heads of the church set the example of licentiousness;
49

from the throne to the lowest grade of society, all
were vitiated, but particularly those who, from their rank or
their holy functions, ought to have set an example. A
people so degenerated could not be expected to save the
kingdom, when attacked by such a man as Saladin.

To repeat the causes which had exasperated this powerful
prince would trench too much upon the province of general
history; suffice it to say, that the conduct of the Christians
was a tissue of weakness, perfidy, and occasional insane
rashness; they were under no strong-handed or prudent
government, they showed themselves subject to no moral
restraints.

Politic, brave, cool, but severe when provoked, Saladin was
the last man the Christians should have made an enemy of.
Irritated by their total want of good faith, and their perpetual
invasions of his territory when they thought he was
distant or engaged with other objects, he at length determined
to subdue them, and that effectually, by taking their
capital city.

After gaining the sanguinary battle of Tiberias, and
taking every city in Palestine before which he thought it
worth his while to sit down, the victorious Sultan advanced
towards Jerusalem. The moment appeared to be come at
which this religiously important city must fall again into the
power of the Mussulmans, and they implored Mahomet to
grant this crowning triumph to the arms of Saladin. After
having taken Gaza, and several fortresses in the neigbourhood,
the Sultan collected his whole army and surrounded
the holy city. A queen in tears, the children of the warriors
killed at the battle of Tiberias, a few fugitive soldiers,
and some pilgrims recently arrived from the West, were the
only guardians of the Holy Sepulchre. A great number of
Christian families who had left the devastated provinces of
Palestine filled the city; but, far from bringing it any
assistance, they only served to augment the trouble and
consternation.

When close to the walls, Saladin summoned before him
the principal inhabitants, and said to them: âI know, as
well as you do, that Jerusalem is the house of God, and I
do not wish to profane its sanctity by the effusion of blood:
abandon its walls, and I will give up to you a part of my
50

treasures; I will give you as much land as you can cultivate.â
âWe cannot,â they replied, âcede willingly a city
in which our God died; still less can we yield it to you.â
Saladin, irritated by their refusal, swore upon the Koran to
level the towers and ramparts of Jerusalem, and to avenge
the death of the Mussulmans slaughtered by the companions
and the soldiers of Godfrey de Bouillon.

At the moment Saladin was speaking to the deputies, an
eclipse of the sun all at once left the heavens in darkness,
and appeared to be a sinister presage for the Christians.
Nevertheless, the inhabitants, encouraged by the clergy,
prepared to defend the city. They had chosen as leader
Baleau dâIbelin, who had been present at the battle of
Tiberias. This old warrior, whose experience and virtue
inspired confidence and respect, immediately set about
repairing the fortifications and disciplining the new defenders
of Jerusalem. As he wanted officers, he created
fifty knights from among the citizens; all the Christians in
a condition to fight took up arms, and swore to shed their
blood in the cause of Christ. There was no money to defray
the expenses of the war, but all means of obtaining it
appeared legitimate amidst the danger which threatened
the city of God. The churches were spoiled, and the people,
terrified at the approach of Saladin, beheld without scandal
the precious metal which covered the chapel of the Holy
Sepulchre converted into coin.

The standards of Saladin were speedily seen floating over
the heights of EmÃ¤us; the Mussulman army pitched its
camp on the same places as were occupied by the tents of
Godfrey, Tancred, and the two Roberts, when they besieged
the Holy City. The Christians at first opposed a warm resistance,
and made frequent sorties, in which they held in one
hand the lance or the sword, and in the other a shovel, with
which they threw dust in the eyes of the Saracens. A great
number of citizens received the palm of martyrdom, and ascended,
say the historians, into the celestial Jerusalem.
Many Mussulmans fell under the swords of their adversaries,
and went to inhabit the
banks of the river which
waters Paradise
.

Saladin, after being encamped some days on the west of
the city, directed his attacks on the north, and mined the
51

ramparts which extend from the gate of Josophat to that of
St. Stephen. The bravest of the citizens made a sortie, and
endeavoured to destroy the machines and works of the besiegers,
encouraging each other by repeating the words of
Scripture,ââ
A single one of us will put ten infidels to
flight; and ten will scatter ten thousand.
â They performed
prodigies of valour, but they could not retard the progress
of the siege; repulsed by the Saracens, they slowly retired
to the city, whither their return brought discouragement and
terror. The towers and ramparts seemed ready to fall at
the first assault. Despair then seized upon the inhabitants,
who saw before them no defence but tears and prayers.
Instead of flying to arms, the soldiers ran to the churches;
the promise of a hundred pieces of gold could not detain
them one night on the threatened ramparts. The clergy
made processions through the streets, to invoke the assistance
of Heaven; some beat their breasts with stones,
others lacerated their bodies with scourges, crying
Mercy!
mercy!
Nothing was heard in Jerusalem but groans; â
but
our Sir Jesus Christ
,â says an old chronicle, â
would not
listen to them; for the luxury and impurity which were in
the city did not allow orisons or prayers to mount up before
God
.â The despair of the inhabitants inspired them with a
thousand contrary projects at once: sometimes they formed
the resolution of leaving the city, and seeking a glorious
death in the ranks of the infidels: at others, they placed all
their hopes in the clemency of Saladin.

Amongst the general trouble and agitation, the Greek
and Syrian Christians, and the Melchite Christians, endured
with much pain the authority of the Latins, and laid to
their charge all the misfortunes of the war. A plot was
discovered, in which they had resolved to deliver Jerusalem
to the Mussulmans: this discovery increased the general
alarm, and determined the principal men of the city to ask
a capitulation of Saladin. Accompanied by Baleau dâIbelin,
they went to propose to the Sultan to give up the place
upon the conditions he had offered before the siege. But
Saladin remembered that he had sworn to take the city by
assault, and to put all the inhabitants to the sword. He
sent back the deputies without giving them any hope;
Baleau dâIbelin returned to him several times, renewed his
52

supplications and prayers, but found Saladin still inflexible.
One day, when the Christian deputies were conjuring him
warmly to accept their capitulation, he turned towards the
place, and, pointing to the standards which floated over the
walls,ââHow can you ask me,â said he, âto grant conditions
to a captured city?â Notwithstanding this, the
Saracens were repulsed; and Baleau, animated by the advantage
obtained by the Christians, replied to the Sultan,ââYou
see, Jerusalem does not want for defences; if we cannot
obtain any mercy from you, we will adopt a terrible
resolution, and the excess of our despair shall fill you with
fright. Those temples and palaces you are so anxious to
conquer shall be destroyed, and all our wealth, which excites
the ambition and cupidity of the Saracens, shall be given up
to the flames. We will lay level the mosque of Omar, and
the mysterious stone of Jacob, the object of your worship,
shall be broken and ground into dust. Jerusalem contains
five thousand Mussulman prisoners: they shall perish by
the sword. We will, with our own hands, slaughter our
women and our children, and thus spare them the disgrace
of becoming your slaves. When the Holy City shall be
nothing but a mass of ruinsâone vast tomb, we will leave
it, followed by the angry manes of our friends and neighbours;
we will leave it, fire and sword in hand; not one of
us will gain Paradise, without having sent to Hell ten Mussulmans.
We shall thus obtain a glorious death, and shall
yield our last breath in calling down upon you the maledictions
of the God of Jerusalem.â

This speech produced a great effect upon Saladin, and he
invited the deputies to return next day. He consulted the
doctors of the law, and they decided that he might accept
the proposed capitulation without violating his oath. The
conditions were signed on the morrow, in the tent of the
Sultan; thus Jerusalem again fell under the domination of
the Infidels, after having been eighty-four years in the hands
of the Christians. The Latin historians had remarked that
the Crusaders had entered Jerusalem on a Friday, at the
same hour that Christ had suffered death to expiate the
crimes of the human race. The Saracens retook the city on
a Friday, the anniversary of the day on which, according to
their belief, Mahomet ascended from Jerusalem to Heaven.
53

This circumstance, which might have induced Saladin to sign
the capitulation proposed to him, did not fail to add new
splendour to his triumph with the Mussulmans, and caused
him to be looked upon as the favourite of the prophet.

All the warriors in Jerusalem obtained permission to
retire to Tyre or to Tripoli. The conqueror granted their
lives to the inhabitants, and permitted them to purchase
their liberty. All Christians, with the exception of Greeks
and Syrians, received an order to quit Jerusalem within four
days. The ransom was fixed at ten pieces of gold for men,
five for women, and two for children. Those who had not
the means to purchase their freedom remained slaves.

These conditions had at first been received with joy by the
Christians; but when the time arrived for their leaving
Jerusalem, their grief at quitting the Holy Places became
intense; they watered the tomb of Christ with their tears,
and reproached themselves with not having died to defend
it; they ran, unconsciously, from Calvary to the various
churches they were never to see again, shedding torrents of
tears; they embraced each other, weeping, in the streets, and
deploring their fatal divisions. Such as could not pay
their ransom, and could only leave Jerusalem as the slaves
of the Saracens, gave themselves up to the wildest despair.
But so great, in these deplorable moments, appeared their
attachment to a religion whose precepts in happier times
they had completely neglected, that the outrages offered to
their worship afflicted them more than their own proper
misery. A cross of gold having been torn from the dome of
the church of the Templars, and dragged through the
streets by the Saracens, all the Christians burst into cries
of grief and indignation, and, although disarmed, Jerusalem
was on the point of rising against its conquerors.

At last the fatal day arrived on which the Christians were
to leave Jerusalem. All the gates of the city were closed,
except that of David, through which the Christians were to
go out. Saladin, seated upon a lofty throne, saw all the people
pass before him. The patriarch, followed by the clergy,
appeared the first, bearing the sacred vases, the ornaments
of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and treasures of which,
says an Arabian author, God alone knows the value. The
Queen of Jerusalem, accompanied by the barons and knights,
54

came next. Saladin respected her grief, and addressed some
kind words to her. The Queen was followed by a great
number of women, bearing their children in their arms, and
uttering the most pitiable cries. Several of them drew near
to the throne of Saladin: âYou see at your feet,â said they,
âthe wives, the mothers, and the daughters of the warriors
you detain prisoners; we are leaving for ever our country,
which they have defended with glory; they assisted us in
supporting life; losing them we have lost our last hope; if
you would deign to restore them to us, they would soften
the miseries of our exile, and we should be no longer without
a support upon earth.â Saladin was touched by their
prayers, and promised to mitigate the misfortunes of so
many unhappy families. He restored the sons to mothers,
and the husbands to wives, who were found among the captives.
Many Christians had abandoned their valuable goods
and property, in order to bear away upon their shoulders
some of their parents weakened by age, and others their
friends, the infirm, and the sick. Saladin was affected by
this spectacle, and rewarded the virtue and piety of his
enemies with gifts and alms; he took pity upon all these
unfortunates, and permitted the Hospitallers to remain in
the city to tend to the sick, as well as such as serious maladies
prevented from moving.

When the Saracens commenced the siege, the Holy City
contained more than a hundred thousand Christians. The
greater part of them purchased their freedom: Baleau
dâIbelin, the depositary of the treasures destined to defray
the expenses of the siege, employed all that was left in the
liberation of the citizens. Malec-Adel, the brother of the
Sultan, paid the ransom of two thousand captives. Saladin
followed his example by setting free great numbers of poor
and orphans. There only remained in slavery about fourteen
thousand Christians, among whom were four or five
thousand children, too young to be aware of the extent of
their misfortune, but whose fate the faithful deplored the
more, from the probability that these innocent victims of
war would be brought up in the idolatry of Mahomet.
From this period Jerusalem has remained in the hands of
the Mahometans.

We have given these interesting sieges in greater detail
55

than we shall be able to afford to most others; but we feel
satisfied our readers will be pleased at being made acquainted
with as many particulars as possible regarding a city which
occupies so prominent a place in the religious and civil
history of the world. We were fortunate, likewise, in
having an historian
2
to refer to who had devoted great
part of his life and his superior talents to the history of the
wars of which the two latter sieges form a part. We have
adopted, in the sieges of Jerusalem, the plan we shall follow
in other cases; we have given the sieges in one series,
thinking that the best way to impress the general history of
the places in young minds, as likewise of showing, by something
like a consecutive account, the causes of wars, defeats,
and successes.

SAMARIA.

Samaria
, the capital of the kingdom of Israel, and the
rival of Jerusalem, sustained several memorable sieges.
Adad, King of Syria, entered into Palestine in the reign of
Achab, and encamped before the walls of Samaria. He soon
reduced the city to the last extremity. Adad, reckoning
upon the certainty of conquering the states of Achab, offered
that king peace upon the conditions of his giving up his
treasures, his wives, and his children. Achab, being without
resource, consented to his demands; but on the morrow,
Adad having added propositions still more hard, the king
resolved to defend himself to the last. At the moment
Adad thought victory within his grasp, the footmen of the
Prince of Israel advanced, attacked his vanguard, killed
many of them, and pursued the rest to the camp. Achab
with his troops fell upon the infidels, put them to flight, and
enriched himself with their spoils.âA.C. 907.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 906.

The following year Adad returned into Palestine with a
more formidable army. Achab marched to meet him, and
gave him battle. The Syrians were routed, and lost, it is
said, a hundred thousand men. Adad was made prisoner.

56

THIRD SIEGE, A.C. 891.

In the reign of Joram, the son of Achab, the capital of
Israel once more beheld a formidable Syrian army at its
gates. This siege was long and celebrated. Adad surrounded
the city on all sides; no supplies could be brought
in; the public magazines were exhausted, and the famine
became so excessive that an assâs head was sold for ninety
pieces of silver; and twelve bushels of pigeonsâ dung, which
was used instead of salt, was worth five. Such distress
made Joram fear that in their despair the people would open
the gates to the enemy. To encourage the soldiers and
watch the people, he every day visited the walls and the
fortifications. Whilst thus employed, a woman cast herself
at his feet. âMy lord and my king,â said she, uttering
fearful cries, âin the name of God, save an unfortunate!â
âWhat would you with me?â replied the monarch; âif the
Lord does not save you, think you that I, who am but a
simple mortal, can? What have you to say to me?â
âLord, the woman you see with me said: âGive me your
son, and let us eat him to-day; to-morrow we will eat mine.â
I killed my son, and we ate him, but this wicked woman,
notwithstanding her promise, has concealed her child, and
robbed me of the food that is my due.â On hearing this
horrid recital, the King of Israel tore his vestments, and exposed
to the eyes of everybody the hair shirt he wore next
his skin. This prince, reduced to despair, threw the cause
of so many evils upon Elijah, and wished to put him to
death. But the man of God promised him that the next
day the abundance should be so great that a measure of
pure meal should be sold for less than one sicle, or thirty
sols; but the prophet gained no believers. An officer upon
whose arm the king was leaning, turned him into ridicule:
âIf the All-powerful,â said he, âwere to open the heavens,
and shower down provisions, this would not be possible.â
âYou will see,â replied Elijah, âbut you will enjoy no part
of it.â Four lepers, who dwelt near the gates of the city,
urged on by despair, went to the camp of the Syrians in
hopes of meeting with death, but what was their astonishment
to find no one there? The enemy, struck by a sudden
panic, and thinking they heard the noise of a great army
57

advancing, had taken to flight, and left everything behind
them. The lepers, after having satisfied their hunger, and
put aside a great quantity of gold and silver, hastened to
announce this happy news to the king. Joram feared it was
a trick. At length, after being assured of the flight of the
infidels, the people rushed in crowds to the camp, and the
word of the prophet was fulfilled in all its circumstances.
The king set the officer who had mocked the prophet, at
the gate of the city, and the unfortunate man was smothered
by the crowd of people, without being able to take a
part in the unlooked-for abundance.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.C. 721.

Salmanazar, King of Assyria, learning that Hosea had
made himself king of Israel, which country he considered
tributary to his power, and wished to shake off the yoke,
besieged Samaria, and carried it by assault after a blockade
of three years. Hosea was made prisoner, and carried away,
with the greater part of his subjects, into Assyria. Thus
ended the kingdom of Israel, or of the ten tribes.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.C. 120.

Samaria, however, became again peopled, and continued
to dispute precedency with Jerusalem till the government of
Hyrcanus, son of Simon Maccabeus. This great sacrificator
took it by escalade, after a siege of a year, and completely
destroyed the city and fortifications. But Herod the Great
rebuilt it, increased its extent considerably, and named it
Sebasta, out of compliment to Augustus.

58

ROME.

In
our account of the early sieges of Rome, notwithstanding
our conviction that many of the events related of
them are apochryphal, we shall adhere to the version which
was the delight of our boyhood. We do not believe the
ancient history of Rome to be more fabulous than that of
other countries. One of the great objects of history is to
form character by placing acts of patriotic devotion or private
virtue in the most attractive light; and we believe that
the firmness of a Mutius ScÃ¦vola, the devotedness of a
Curtius, or even the apologue of Menenius Agrippa, will be
more beneficial to the young mind than the bare skeletons
left by the scepticism of German historians. We venerate
truth, but we have seen and read nothing to convince us
that the fine old tales of Livy were not founded upon
something
;
and if in their passage to us a colouring has been
added to make virtue more attractive and vice more repulsive,
let us not reject them because they are too pleasing; the
hard world youth have before them will prove quite chilling
enough to their better sympathies: let them be allowed to
enter it with hearts alive to the good, the great, and the
elevating.

FIRST SIEGE, A.C. 747.

From the way in which what is called Rome, as a nation,
was got together, it was naturally in a constant state of
warfare. The spirit in which it was founded pervaded and
ruled over it to its fall: it was at all times a nation of the
sword; and when that sword was blunted by having conquered
the known world, its conquests all crumbled away:
when Rome ceased to be an aggressor, she instantly ceased
to be great. Rome, of course, commenced this aggressive
career with wars upon her neighbours, a cause for quarrel
being quickly and easily found where everything was to be
gained and little to be lost. Thus, the rape of the Sabine
59

women produced the first siege of the nascent city,âa violation
not only of the laws of nations, but of the laws of even
the rudest state of nature, created its first enemies. The
Sabines of Cures, animated by a warm desire for vengeance,
presented themselves before Rome; their design was to
blockade it, when chance rendered them masters of the citadel
by the treachery of Tarpeia. She covenanted, as her
reward for betraying the capital, for what they wore on
their arms, meaning their ornamental bracelets; but they,
disgusted with her action, threw their bucklers upon her and
smothered her. After her, the rock from which criminals
were precipitated was called the Tarpeian,âa proof that
there was at least some foundation for that now disputed
legend. The two peoples then came to close action, and
victory remained long undecided: the Romans gave way at
the first charge, but were rallied by the voice of Romulus,
and recommenced the fight with obstinacy and success.
The carnage was about to become horrible, when the Sabine
women, for whose honour so much blood was being spilt,
threw themselves between the combatants, with dishevelled
hair, holding in their arms the fruits of their forced marriages,
and uttering piercing cries. Their voices, their tears,
their supplicating posture, relaxed the fury of the fight, and
calmed the animosity of the combatants; the Sabine women
became mediators between their relations and their husbands.
Peace was made on the condition that the two
people should from that time be one, and that the two kings
should reign together.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 507.

Tarquin the Superb, not being able to recover by artifice
the throne from which he had been expelled, sought to employ
force. He had the address to interest several neighbouring
nations in his cause;âwhen they had a chance of
success, Rome had always plenty of enemies around her.
Porsenna, King of Clusium, then the most powerful
monarch of Italy, raised a numerous army in his defence,
and laid siege to Rome. In an assault, the two consuls
were wounded, and the consequently disordered Romans
could not withstand their opponents. The Etruscans attacked
60

a bridge, the capture of which must lead to that of
the city; but Horatius, surnamed Cocles from having lost
an eye, alone opposed himself to the troops of Porsenna,
whilst his companions broke down the bridge behind him.
When they had completed the work, he threw himself into
the Tiber and swam ashore.

The King of Clusium, having failed in his attempt, undertook
to reduce the place by famine; but the bold action of
a young Roman soon made him change his design. Mutius
ScÃ¦vola, animated by the same spirit that had governed
Cocles, was determined to relieve his country from this
dreaded enemy. He went to the Clusian camp, disguised as
an Etruscan, entered the kingâs tent, and meeting with that
princeâs secretary superbly dressed, poniarded him instead
of Porsenna. He was arrested, led before the king, and
strictly interrogated, whilst the instruments of torture were
ostentatiously displayed in his sight. Mutius, with a haughty
air, and without being the least intimidated by their menaces,
exclaimed, â
I am a Roman; I know how to suffer, I know
how to die!
â At the same time, as if he wished to punish
the hand which had so ill served him, he held it in the flame
of a brazier till it was consumed, looking all the while at
Porsenna with a firm and stern glance. âThere are thirty
of us,â said he, âall sworn to rid Rome of her implacable
enemy; and all will not make such a mistake as I have.â
The king, astonished at the intrepid coolness of the young
Roman, concluded a treaty of peace, which delivered Rome
from the most formidable enemy she had had to encounter.
Among the hostages given by the Romans, was ClÅlia, a
Roman maiden, possessed of courage beyond her sex or age.
She persuaded her companions to escape by swimming across
the Tiber. They succeeded, in spite of the numerous arrows
discharged upon them on their passage. The boldness of
the action met with high praise in Rome; but they were
sent back to Porsenna, that public faith might not be violated.
That prince, however, was so much pleased with
such virtuous spirit, that he restored the generous maidens
to freedom, and made his alliance still more close with a city
that could produce heroines as well as heroes. Now all the
best incidents of this siege are deemed apochryphal; and yet,
who will dare to tell us that the well-authenticated accounts
61

of the vices of the declining empire are equally instructive
and ameliorating? We cannot render minds we are forming
too familiar with pictures of the noble and the good, nor
keep from them too carefully representations of the wicked
and debasing.

THIRD SIEGE, A.C. 488.

Caius Marcius Coriolanus, exiled from Rome by the seditious
Tribunes and by his own indomitable pride, so far
forgot all patriotic feelings as to engage the Volscians to
make war against his country. Here we beg to draw the
attention of our young readers to the very different conduct
of Themistocles, his contemporary, under similar circumstances.
The Volscians, proud of the assistance of such a
distinguished hero, made him their general: he took the
field with vengeance in his heart. After a great number of
victories, he marched straight to Rome, for the purpose of
laying siege to it. So bold a design threw the patricians
and the people equally into a state of the greatest alarm.
Hatred gave way to fear: deputies were sent to Coriolanus,
who received them with all the haughtiness of an enemy
determined upon making his will the law. The Roman
generals, instead of boldly meeting him in the field, exhorted
him to grant them peace; they conjured him to have pity on
his country, and forget the injuries offered to him by the
populace, who were already sufficiently punished by the
evils he had inflicted upon them. But they brought back
nothing but the stern reply, âthat they must restore to the
Volscians all they had taken from them, and grant them the
right of citizenship.â Other deputies were dismissed in the
same manner. The courage of these Romans, so proud and
so intrepid, appeared to have passed with Coriolanus over to
the side of the Volscians. Obedience to the laws was at an
end; military discipline was neglected: they took counsel
of nothing but their fear. At length, after many tumultuous
deliberations, the ministers of religion were sent to
endeavour to bend the will of the angry compatriot. Priests,
clothed in their sacred habiliments advanced with mournful
steps to the camp of the Volscians, and the most venerable
amongst them implored Coriolanus to give peace to his
country, and, in the name of the gods, to have compassion on
62

the Romans, his fellow-citizens and brothers: but they
found him equally stern and inflexible. When the people
saw the holy priests return without success, they indeed
supposed the republic lost. They filled the temples, they
embraced the altars of the gods, and gathered in clusters
about the city, uttering cries and lamentations: Rome presented
a picture of profound grief and debasement. Veturia,
the mother of Coriolanus, and Volumnia, his wife,
saved their unhappy country. They presented themselves
before him, and conjured him by all that he held most sacred,
to spare a city which had given him birth, and which still
contained his mother, his wife, and his children. His
mother was a woman of great spirit,âa Roman, almost a
Spartan mother: she had, from his boyhood, stimulated him
to the performance of noble and heroic deeds: she might be
called the parent of his glory, as well as of his vigorous
person. Coriolanus loved his mother tenderly, almost
idolized her, and could not resist her tears. He raised the
siege, and delivered Rome from the greatest alarm it had
ever experienced.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.C. 387.

A colony of Gauls, confined for room in their own
country, entered upper Italy, under the command of
Brennus, three hundred and eighty-seven years before
Christ, and laid siege to Clusium, in Tuscany. Accustomed
already to command as a master in Italy, Rome sent three
ambassadors to Brennus, to inform him that that city was
under the protection of the Roman republic. Offended by
the rude reply of the Gauls, the ambassadors retired indignantly,
but violated the rights of nations by entering
Clusium, and assisting in the defence of it. Brennus,
highly irritated, demanded satisfaction, and Rome refused
to give it. He marched directly against that already superb
city. The two armies met on the banks of the river Allia,
within half a league of Rome. The Romans, being the less
in numbers, extended their ranks, in order not to be surrounded,
and by that means weakened their centre. The
Gauls, perceiving this, fell with fury on the cohorts of the
centre, broke through them, and attacked the wings, whose
63

flanks this opening left exposed. Already conquered by
the terror inspired by this bold manÅuvre, which bespoke
a people accustomed to military tactics, the wings of the
Roman army took to flight without drawing sword, and the
main body, bewildered by the general rout which ensued,
took refuge in Veii, instead of regaining Rome, which
offered them the nearest asylum. Thousands of Romans fell
under the sword of the Gauls; and if these people had
marched straight to the city, instead of lingering to share
the spoil, the Roman name would have been at an end.
They remained three days engaged in distributing the spoil,
and these three days saved Rome, whither the fugitives bore
the news of the disaster the army and the consuls had sustained.
They rendered the republic aware of what it had
to expect from the victorious Gauls. The Senate, in the
general alarm, took advantage of the time the barbarians
employed in rejoicings for their victory. Not finding a
sufficient force to defend the city, they threw all the men
capable of bearing arms into the Capitol, and sent away all
useless mouths; the old men, women, and children took
refuge in the nearest cities. There only remained in Rome
a few pontiffs and ancient senators, who, not being willing
to survive either their country or its glory, generously
devoted themselves to death, to appease, according to their
belief, the anger of the infernal gods. These venerable
men, in order to preserve to the last sigh the marks of
a dignity which they believed would expire with them, put
on their sacred vestments or their consular robes, placed
themselves at the doors of their houses, in their ivory
chairs, and awaited with firmness the decree which Destiny
was about to pronounce on Rome. Brennus arrived three
days after his victory. Surprised at finding the gates open,
the walls without defence, and the houses without inhabitants,
he suspected some ambush or stratagem. The continued
silence and calm at length reassured him. He placed
his points of guard; then, whilst spreading his troops
through the quarters of the city, the first objects that met
his eyes were the venerable old men who had devoted themselves
to death. Their splendid habits, their white beards,
their air of grandeur and firmness, their silence even,
astonished Brennus, and inspired a religious fear in his
64

army. A Gaul, less touched with this august spectacle and
more daring than the rest, ventured to pluck insolently the
beard of an ancient senator. The spirited old man dealt
him a heavy blow with his ivory staff on the head. The
irritated soldier killed the senator, and this became the
signal for slaughter; all were massacred in their chairs, and
the inhabitants who had not escaped were put to the
sword. Brennus attacked the Capitol, but he was repulsed
with loss. Despairing of taking it by force, he had recourse
to blockade, to reduce it by famine. In order to avenge
himself for the resistance offered by the Romans, he set
fire to the city; and soon Rome presented nothing but its
hills surrounded with smoking ruins.

The Gauls, inflated with their success, believed the whole
country to be in a state of terror, and they preserved neither
order nor discipline; some wandered about the neighbourhood
for the purpose of plunder, whilst others spent both days
and nights in drinking. They thought the whole people shut
up in the Capitol, but Rome found an avenger in Camillus.
This great man, exiled by his ungrateful fellow-citizens,
had retired to Ardea. He prevailed upon the young men
of that city to follow him. In concert with the magistrates,
he marched out on a dark night, fell upon the Gauls stupified
with wine, made a horrible slaughter, and thus raised
the depressed courage of his fellow-citizens. They flocked
in crowds to his standard, and, looking upon Camillus as
their only resource, they chose him as their leader. But he
refused to do anything without the order of the Senate and
the people shut up in the Capitol. It was almost impossible
to gain access to them. A young Roman, however, had the
hardihood to undertake this perilous enterprise, and succeeded.
Camillus, declared dictator, collected an army of
more than forty thousand men, who believed themselves
invincible under so able a general.

The Gauls, meanwhile, perceived the traces left by the
young man, and Brennus endeavoured, during the night, to
surprise the Capitol by the same path. After many efforts,
a few succeeded in gaining the summit of the rock, and
were already on the point of scaling the walls; the sentinel
was asleep, and nothing seemed to oppose them. Some
geese, consecrated to Juno, were awakened by the noise
65

made by the enemy, and began to cry as they do when disturbed.
Manlius, a person of consular rank, flew to the
spot, encountered the Gauls, and hurled two of them from
the rock. The Romans were roused, and the enemy were
driven back; most of them either fell or were thrown from
the precipice, and very few of the party engaged regained
their camp. The sleepy sentinel was precipitated from the
Capitol, and Manlius was highly rewarded. Much irritated
at his defeat, Brennus pressed the place still more closely,
to augment the famine, which had begun to be felt even in
his camp, since Camillus had made himself master of the
open country. An accommodation was soon proposed; it
was agreed that Brennus should receive a thousand pounds
weight of gold, on condition of his raising the siege and
leaving the lands of the republic. The gold was brought,
but when it was to be weighed, the Gauls made use of false
weights. The Romans complained of this; but Brennus,
laughing at their remonstrances, threw his sword and baldric
into the scale, which counterpoised the gold, adding raillery
to injustice. âWoe be to the conquered!â said he, in a
barbarous tone. At that very moment Camillus reached
the capital, and advanced with a strong escort towards the
place of conference. Upon learning what had passed, âTake
back this gold to the Capitol,â said he to the Roman deputies;
âand you, Gauls,â added he, âretire with your weights
and scales; it is with steel only that Romans should redeem
their country.â The parties soon proceeded to blows; Camillus
brought up his troops, and a furious charge ensued.
The Romans, maddened by the sight of their ruined country,
made incredible efforts. The Gauls could not withstand
them; they were broken, and fled on all sides. Brennus
rallied them, raised the siege, and encamped a few miles
from Rome. Camillus followed him with characteristic
ardour, attacked him afresh, and defeated him. Most of
the Gauls were either killed on the field of battle, or massacred
in detail by the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages;
so that, it is said, a single one did not remain to carry
back to his country the news of their defeat. Thus Rome
was saved by the valour and ability of an illustrious exile,
who, forgetting the injustice and ingratitude of his country,
richly merited the title of
its second founder
.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.C. 211.

This siege, although so short a one as to occupy but little
space in our narration, belongs to a very interesting period in
the Roman history: it occurred in the course of what are
called the Punic wars, which were the contests of two of
the most powerful states then in existence, for supremacy.
Rome and Carthage were like two suns; they had become too
powerful for both to retain their splendour in one hemisphere.
They were really the noblest conflicts in which
Rome was engaged; there was a rivalry in generals and
soldiers worthy of being sustained by the great republic;
and though Rome was in the end the conqueror, and her
generals were great, it is doubtful whether she can exhibit
in her annals so perfect a captain as Hannibal. The Carthaginians
suffer, in the opinion of posterity, in another way;
the Romans were not only the victors, but the historians;
Punic bad faith is proverbial in the Roman language, but
we strongly suspect that a Carthaginian Polybius or Livy
would have found as many sins against the laws of nations
committed by the one party as the other. The man was
the painter, and not the lion. Whether it is from want of
sympathy with a mere nation of the sword, we know not;
but, notwithstanding the great men who illustrated Romeâs
armies and senate, we cannot help taking part with Hannibal
and his countrymen throughout these wars. Much as we
like Cato the Censor in other respects, we cannot but view
him, with his figs and his â
delenda est Carthago
,â as a
spiteful old fellow, whom we should very much have liked
to see disappointed.

After various and great successes, of which it is not our
business to speak, Hannibal, to terrify the Romans, presented
himself before their city. The consuls, who had
received orders to watch that the republic should receive no
injury, felt it their duty to encounter him. When they
were on the point of engaging, a violent storm compelled
both parties to retire; and the same thing occurred several
times; so that Hannibal, believing that he saw in this event
something supernatural, said, according to Livy, that sometimes
fortune and sometimes his will was always wanting to
make him master of Rome. That which still more surprised
67

him was, that whilst he was encamped at one of the gates of
the city, the Romans sent an army out of one of the other
gates into Spain; and that the very field in which he was
encamped was sold at the same time, without that circumstance
having diminished the value of it. In order to
avenge himself, he put up to auction the goldsmithsâ shops
which were around the most public place in Rome, and then
retired.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.C. 87.

War being declared against Mithridates, king of Pontus,
was the signal of discord between Marius and Sylla. These
two rivals, whose animosity knew no bounds, demanded at
the same time the command of the army. Sylla obtained it
from the Senate, and immediately went to place himself at
the head of his troops. Marius took advantage of his absence,
and, with the assistance of the tribune Sulpicius,
he so excited the people against the nobles, that Sylla
was deprived of his command which was conferred upon
him. Sylla, far from obeying the sentence of the people,
marched straight to Rome with his army, consisting of forty
thousand men. This was the first time, since Coriolanus,
that this great city had been besieged by one of its own
citizens. Destitute of everything, its only defence being a
few soldiers got together in haste by Marius, it did not
make a long resistance. Sylla entered as an enemy; the
multitude mounted upon the roofs of the houses, armed
with anything they could lay hold of, and poured such a
shower of stones and tiles upon the heads of his soldiers,
that they could not advance. Sylla, forgetful of what he
owed to his country and to himself, cried out to his men to
set fire to the houses; and, arming himself with a blazing
brand, gave them the example. Marius, too weak to contend
with his rival, abandoned to him the centre of the empire.
The conqueror affected great moderation, prevented the
pillage of his country, reformed the government, raised
the authority of the Senate upon the ruins of that of the
people, put to death Sulpicius, with ten other senators, partisans
of his rival, and embarked for Asia.

This second absence replunged Rome into fresh misfortunes;
the faction of the people, of which Marius was
68

the soul, excited by Cinna, took courage again. This
consul, having won over some tribunes, caused so much
trouble, that he was driven from the city and deprived of the
consulate; but he succeeded in gaining to his quarrel a
large army encamped in the Campania, and almost all the
peoples of Italy. Marius, who had taken refuge in Africa,
recrossed the sea, and came to join Cinna; he was immediately
declared pro-consul. It was proposed to give him
fasces and lictors, but he rejected them: âSuch honours,â
said he, âwould not become a banished man.â His party
held a council, and it was determined to go and attack
Rome: Sylla had set them the example.

Rome, always victorious against external enemies, but
always weak against domestic attacks, saw herself besieged
by four armies, commanded by Marius, Cinna, Sertorius,
and Carbo. Masters of all the passages, they subjected the
city to famine, and reduced its inhabitants to extremity.
Pompeius Strabo came at last, but too late, to the succour
of his country with an army. Rome, in a state of consternation,
and seeing herself on the verge of ruin, sent deputies
to the enemies to invite them to enter the city. A council
was held. Marius and Cinna, after having marked out
their victims, gave the city up to all the horrors of war. A
multitude of virtuous Romans were immolated to the vengeance
of the two leaders; Marius inundated his country
with the purest blood of the republic. Birth and riches
were unpardonable crimes; a nod of this tyrantâs head was
an order for death. This ferocious and barbarous man,
after having exercised the most horrible cruelties, died a
short time after this victory, in the middle of Rome itself,
of which he had been the preserver and the executioner.

SEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 408.

When we compare the date of the last siege with that of
this, and glance over the events which had taken place
between them, we feel great surprise that no siege of Rome
should have intervened. It would appear that the Eternal
City was guarded by some supernatural power, through
shocks and changes of empires, from feeling convulsions, of
which it really was the centre. Through the period of the
69

empire, Rome may be said never to have been invaded by a
foreign enemy, or by its own children in revolt. The empire
changed masters, at times, as a conjurer shifts his balls, and
men of all countries occupied its throne; but, in all these
revolutions, Rome itself was held sacred.

Alaric, king of the Goths, entered Italy, and advanced
towards Rome to lay siege to it. On his route, a pious
solitary came to throw himself at his feet, imploring him
with tears to spare that city, which had become the centre
of the Christian world. âRather,â replied the prince, âit
is not my will that leads me on; I incessantly hear a voice
in my ears, which criesââOn, Alaric, on! and sack Rome!ââ
He reduced it to the most frightful extremity, by closing
every passage for provisions, and by making himself master
of the navigation of the Tiber. Pestilence was soon added
to famine. Rome was nothing but one vast cemetery: it
became necessary to treat with the king of the Goths.

The deputies of Rome declared that the Roman people
were willing to accept peace upon reasonable conditions;
but rather than its glory should be stained, they would give
battle. âVery good!â replied Alaric, with a loud laugh;
âit is never so easy to cut the hay as when the grass is
thickest!â They were forced to lay aside their ancient
pride, and submit to circumstances. The conqueror ordered
them to bring to him all the gold, silver, valuable furniture,
and foreign slaves that were in the city. âAnd what will
you leave, then, to the inhabitants?â asked the deputies.
âLife!â replied Alaric. After long contestations, it was
agreed that Rome should pay five thousand pounds weight
of gold, thirty thousand pounds weight of silver, four thousand
silken tunics, three thousand skins coloured scarlet,
three thousand pounds weight of spices, and, as hostages,
give up the children of the most noble citizens. When
these conditions were complied with, the king of the Goths
raised the siege.

EIGHTH SIEGE, A.D. 410.

Two years after, Alaric, constantly provoked to vengeance
by the perfidies of the Romans, presented himself again
before the Capitol, and besieged Rome very closely. The
70

siege was long, but very few circumstances relating to it
have been preserved. On the 24th of August, the Gothic
prince entered the city, of which some traitors had opened
the gates to him during the night. Rome was sacked by
the furious soldiery; its wealth, its valuable furniture, its
public edifices, its temples, its private houses, became the
prey of the flames. The blood of the citizens inundated the
streets and public places; the women were dishonoured,
and then immolated upon the bodies of their slaughtered
husbands and fathers; children were destroyed upon the
bosoms of their mothers. Heaven seemed to arm itself in
concert with the Goths to punish Rome: lightning reduced
to dust what the flames had spared.

The Goths, however, respected the churches; these holy
places were an inviolable asylum for all who sought refuge
in them. An officer having entered a house which served
as a depÃ´t for the church of St. Peter, and finding nobody
in it but a woman advanced in age, asked her if she had any
gold or silver. âI have a great deal,â she replied; âI will
place it before your eyes.â At the same time, she displayed
a great number of precious vases. âThey belong to St.
Peter,â said she; âcarry away, if you dare, these sacred
riches; I cannot prevent you. I abandon them to you;
but you must render an account of them to him who is the
master of them.â The barbarian did not dare to lay an impious
hand upon this deposit, and sent to ask the kingâs
orders relative to them. Alaric commanded all the vases to
be taken to the basilica of the church of St. Peter; and
that that woman, with all the Christians who would join
her, should be conducted thither likewise. It was a spectacle
as surprising as it was magnificent, to see a long train
of soldiers, who, holding in one hand their naked swords,
and supporting with the other the precious vases they bore
on their heads, marched with a respectful countenance, and
as if in triumph, amidst the greatest riot and disorder.

The Christian women signalized their courage in a most
striking manner on this melancholy day. A widow, respectable
from her age and birth, and who had lived in retirement
with an only daughter, whom she brought up in a life of
piety, was assailed by a troop of soldiers, who, in a threatening
manner, demanded her gold. âI have given it to the
71

poor,â replied she. The angry barbarians rewarded her
answer with blows. Insensible to pain, she only implored
them not to separate her from her companion, whose beauty
she feared might expose her to insults more cruel than
death itself. Her appeal was so touching, that the Gothic
soldiers conducted them both safely to the basilica of St.
Paul.

A young officer, struck with the beauty of a Roman lady,
after having made every effort in vain to induce her to comply
with his wishes, drew his sword, and pretending that he
would cut off her head, inflicted a slight wound, in the hope
that she would be overcome by the fear of death; but this
noble woman, so far from being terrified at the sight of her
own blood, presenting her neck to her enemy, exclaimed,ââStrike
again, and strike better!â The sword fell from the
hand of the barbarian; he conducted his captive to the
church of St. Peter, and commanded the guards to give her
up to nobody but her husband. Thus Rome, 1,163 years
after its foundation, lost in a single day that splendour
which had dazzled the world. It was not, however, destroyed,
and was soon repeopled again; but from that
period of humiliation, this queen of cities and of the world
became the sport and the prey of the barbarians who sacked
it in turn.

After the taking of Naples in 538, Belisarius shut himself
up in Rome, and prepared to sustain a siege, if Vitiges
would undertake to attack him. The new monarch, at the
head of a hundred and fifty thousand men, marched towards
the capital of Italy, asking of every one he fell in with on
his route, whether Belisarius were still in Rome. âPrince,
be satisfied on that point,â replied a priest; âthe only
part of the military art Belisarius is ignorant of, is flight.â
This general had constructed a fort upon a bridge, at a mile
from Rome, and had provided it with a sufficient garrison;
but these base cowards, seized with fear at the approach of
the Goths, took to flight, and dispersed themselves over the
Campania. The next day, at dawn, Vitiges crossed the
bridge with a great part of his army. As he advanced, he
met Belisarius, who, at the head of a thousand horse, had
come to reconnoitre; his surprise was excessive at seeing
the enemy; but without being daunted by their numbers, he
72

halted, and received them at the head of his little troop.
Here the valour and exploits of Belisarius approach the
marvellous: in the hottest of the
mÃªlÃ©e
, the brave leader of
the Romans was recognised by some deserters, who cried
out from several quarters at once: âAt the bay horse, comrades!âaim
at the bay horse!â Assailed on all sides, he
became a mark for every arrow. Inflamed with a generous
courage, he drove off some, overthrew others, and cut down
all that impeded his passage. The Romans, seeing the
danger of their general, flew to his aid, surrounded him,
warded off every blow directed against him, and made him a
rampart of their bucklers and their bodies. The terrified
Goths turned bridle, and were pursued to their camp; the
rest of the army, however, stopped the career of the conquerors,
and forced them to fly in their turn to a neighbouring
height, where they rallied. The combat was then
renewed; and the Romans, too inferior in numbers, would
scarcely have effected a retreat, but for the heroic valour of
an officer named Valentinus. This new Cocles alone withstood
the Gothic cavalry, and gave time to his comrades to
regain the city; but the inhabitants shut the gates against
them. In vain Belisarius shouted his name, and pressed to
be admitted; the inhabitants were persuaded that he had
perished in the fight, and could not otherwise recognise his
countenance, from the blood and dust which disfigured it;
they therefore paid no regard to his orders. In this extremity,
Belisarius re-animated his little band, and turned
with fury upon the enemy, who were close at his heels. The
Goths, imagining that he was at the head of fresh troops
from the city, stopped their pursuit, turned their horsesâ
heads, and regained their camp. Belisarius re-entered the
city in triumph, where he was received with transports of
the most lively joy. Rome believed itself from that time
safe from all reverses, beneath the Ã¦gis of this intrepid
general. In this combat the Goths lost the
Ã©lite
of their
cavalry.

On the eighteenth day of the siege, at sunrise, the Goths,
led on by Vitiges, marched towards the gate Salaria. At the
sight of their machines, Belisarius broke into a loud laugh,
whilst the inhabitants were frozen with fear. The Goths
had reached the bank of the ditch, when the Roman general,
73

seizing a bow, took aim at a Gothic commander covered with
a cuirass, and pierced him quite through the neck. This act
was highly applauded by his troops, whose triumph was
doubled by a second aim as fortunate as the first. Belisarius
then commanded his soldiers to make a general discharge at
the oxen which drew the machines. In an instant they
were covered and transpierced with an iron shower. The
astonished and discomfited Goths were forced to terminate
their attack.

Although the attempts of Vitiges seemed generally to fail,
he was on the point of taking Rome, to the north of the
mole or tomb of Adrian, since called the castle of St. Angelo.
It was necessary for the Goths to possess themselves of this
place, to cross the Tiber. In spite of the arrows of the
Romans, they had applied their ladders and begun to ascend,
when the defenders of the mole bethought themselves of
breaking off the numerous marble statues with which this
monument was ornamented, and rolled the fragments upon
the heads of the besiegers, who, beaten from their ladders
by these enormous masses, were constrained to abandon
their enterprise.

The next day, Belisarius dismissed all useless mouths from
the city; he enrolled a great number of artisans; he changed
the locks and bolts of the city gates twice a month; and
caused instruments to be played upon the walls during the
night. A Goth, remarkable for his height and famous for
his exploits, covered with his cuirass, and with his helmet on
his head, advanced from the ranks opposite the gate Salaria,
and setting his back against a tree, kept up a continuous
discharge of arrows at the battlements. An immense javelin,
launched from a ballist, pierced him through cuirass, body
and all, and penetrating half its length into the tree, nailed
this redoubtable warrior to it. Although we are arrived at
a well-authenticated period of history, we must confess the
following account trenches upon the marvellous: but, as we
know truth is sometimes more wonderful than fiction, we do
not hesitate to repeat it. A Massagete horseman named
Chorsamantes, one of Belisariusâs guards, accompanied by a
few Romans, was pursuing a body of sixty horse on the
plains of Nero. His companions having turned rein, in order
not to approach too near to the enemyâs camp, he continued
74

the pursuit alone. The Goths, seeing him thus deserted,
turned round upon him: he killed the boldest of them,
charged the others, and put them to flight. Chorsamantes
pursued them to their intrenchments, and, more fortunate
than prudent, he regained Rome in safety, and was received
with loud acclamations. Some time after, having been
wounded in a rencontre, he swore to avenge himself, and
kept his word. He went out alone, and made his way to
the camp of the Goths. They took him for a deserter; but
when they saw him shooting at them, twenty horsemen
came out for the purpose of cutting him in pieces. He at
first met them with the greatest audacity, and even checked
them; but soon, environed on all parts, furious at the aspect
of peril, and always the more redoubtable from the numbers
of his enemies, he fell, covered with wounds, upon a heap
of men and horses he had slain.

In a severe combat which was afterwards fought, the
Goths were repulsed with loss. Rutilus, a Roman officer,
pierced by a dart, which was half-buried in his head, as if
insensible to the pain, continued the pursuit of the enemy.
He died the moment the dart was extracted. Another
officer, named Azzes, returned from a charge with an arrow
sticking close to his right eye. A skilful leech, named Theoclistes,
cured him. TragÃ n, the commander of a body of
troops, whilst endeavouring to break through a battalion of
Goths, received an arrow in his eye; the wood broke off at
the moment of striking, and fell, but the steel, being quite
buried, remained in the wound, without giving TragÃ n much
pain. Five days afterwards, the steel began to reappear,
pierced through the cicatrice, and fell out apparently of
itself. Tarmut, a barbarian captain, an ally of the Romans,
being left almost alone on the field of battle, was assailed by
a crowd of enemies; but, armed with two javelins, he laid
at his feet all who ventured to approach him. At length,
covered with wounds, he was near sinking from weakness,
when he saw his brother Ennes, chief of the Isaurians, approach
with a troop of horse, and throw himself between
him and his assailants. Reanimated by this unhoped-for
succour, he recovered sufficient strength to gain the city,
still armed with his two javelins. He only survived this
astonishing effort of courage two days. Such were the
75

principal exploits during the siege of Rome by Vitiges, who
was obliged to raise it, after a year and nine days of useless
attempts. Sixty-nine battles were fought, all very bloody,
and almost all to the advantage of the Romans: they cost
the king of the Goths more than the half of his numerous
army. Belisarius had but a small force; Rome might have
been taken easily: it had yielded to much weaker armies,
but Belisarius was in Rome, and that great general, fertile
in resources, was alone worth whole legions.

NINTH SIEGE, A.D. 544.

In the year 544, Totila, king of the Goths, and master of
part of Italy, formed the blockade of Rome, and kept the
passages so well, that no provisions could be got in, either
by land or sea. He stopped the entrance by the Tiber at a
place where its bed was narrowest, by means of extraordinarily
long beams of timber, laid from one bank to the
other, upon which he raised, at the two extremities, towers
of wood, which were filled with soldiers. The famine soon
became so horrible, that wheat was sold at seven pieces of
gold per bushel, which is nearly ninety shillings of our
money, and bran at about a quarter of the sum; an ox, taken
in a sortie, was sold at an unheard-of price. Fortunate was
the man who could fall in with a dead horse, and take undisputed
possession of it! Dogs, rats, and the most impure
animals, soon became exquisite and eagerly-purchased dainties.
Most of the citizens supported themselves upon
nettles and wild herbs, which they tore from the foot of the
walls and ruined buildings. Rome seemed to be only inhabited
by pale, fleshless, livid phantoms, who either fell dead
in the streets or killed themselves.

A father of five children, who demanded bread of him
with piercing cries, told them to follow him, and for a moment
concealing his grief in the depths of his heart, without
shedding a tear, without breathing a sigh, he led them on
to one of the bridges of the city; there, after enveloping his
head in his cloak, he precipitated himself into the Tiber in
their presence.

That which was most frightful in this extremity of misery,
was the fact that the leaders themselves were the cause of
76

the public want: they devoured the citizens by their sordid
avarice. The immense masses of wheat, which they had
been a long time collecting, were only distributed at their
weight in gold; and very shortly most of the wealth of
Rome was concentrated amongst monsters, worthy of the
severest punishment.

Belisarius, whose generous spirit mourned over the misfortunes
of Rome, attempted all sorts of means to succour
the unfortunate capital. He caused a large number of
barks to be constructed, furnished with boarding all round,
to protect the soldiers from the arrows of the enemy. These
boards were pierced at certain distances, to afford facility
for launching their own bolts and arrows. He caused these
barks to be laden with great quantities of provisions,
placed himself at the head of them, and, leading with some
fire-boats, he ascended the Tiber, and set fire to one of the
enemyâs towers. But his enterprise not being seconded, he
could not succeed in throwing provisions into the city; grief
at his failure produced a sickness which brought him to the
brink of the grave. Some Isaurian soldiers, who guarded
the gate Asinaria, having slipped along the ramparts in the
night by means of a cord, came and offered Totila to give up
the city to him. The king having assured himself of their
fidelity, and of the possibility of the enterprise, sent with
them four of the bravest and strongest Goths, who, having
got into the city, opened a gate and admitted the besiegers.
Bessus, who commanded in the place, fled away with his
troops at the first alarm. In the house of this governor
were found heaps of gold and silver, the fruits of his cruel
monopolies.

At daybreak the king of the Goths repaired to the church
of St. Peter, to return thanks to God for his success. The
deacon Pelagius, who awaited him at the entrance of the
holy temple, prostrated himself humbly before him, and
implored him to save the lives of the inhabitants. Totila,
who knew how to pardon as well as to conquer, granted the
sacred minister what he asked, and forbade his soldiers,
under the strongest penalties, to shed the blood of any one.
When this order was given, the Goths had already slain
twenty soldiers and sixty citizens. These were the only
victims of the brutality of the victors; but if he spared the
77

lives of the inhabitants, he deprived them of all means to
support them. Rome was abandoned to pillage for several
days, and nothing was left to the citizens but the bare walls
of their houses. Senators, formerly opulent and proud,
were seen covered with miserable rags, reduced to beg their
bread from door to door, and live upon the alms they received
from the barbarians.

Totila was preparing to demolish Rome; he had already
levelled a third of the walls, and was about to set fire to
the most superb edifices of the city, when he received a
letter from Belisarius, which diverted him from his design.
âTo found cities,â said this great man, âto maintain
flourishing cities, is to serve society and immortalize ourselves;
to overthrow and destroy them, is to declare
ourselves the enemies of mankind, and dishonour ourselves
for ever. By the agreement of all peoples, the city into
which you have entered, in consequence of your victory, is
the greatest and most magnificent under heaven. It is not
the work of a single man, or a single army. During more
than thirteen centuries, a long line of kings, consuls, and
emperors have disputed the glory of embellishing it, and
the superb edifices it presents to your eyes are so many
monuments which consecrate their memories; to destroy
them is to outrage the past centuries, of which they eternize
the remembrance, and to deprive future ages of a magnificent
spectacle. My lord, reflect that fortune must declare
itself in favour of you or my master. If you remain the
conqueror, how you will regret having destroyed your most
splendid conquest! If you should succumb, the treatment
you have inflicted upon Rome will serve as a rule by which
Justinian will treat you. The eyes of the universe are upon
you; it awaits the part you are about to take, to accord you
the title which will be for ever attached to the name of
Totila.â Persuaded by this eloquent appeal, the king of
the Goths contented himself with depopulating the city of
Rome, in which he did not leave a single inhabitant.

Forty days after the retreat of Totila, Belisarius transported
himself to Rome, with the design of repeopling that
famous city, and repairing its ruins. He soon put it in a
state to sustain a new siege. Upon learning this, the king
of the Goths quickly returned, and during three days made
78

several attacks upon the city; but Belisarius repulsed them
all, and forced him to retire with great loss.

TENTH SIEGE, A.D. 549.

In 549, Totila, without being discouraged by his defeat,
once more laid siege to the capital of Italy. Diogenes, who
commanded there, had had wheat sown within the inclosure
of the walls, which might have supported the garrison some
time. But the city was again betrayed by the Isaurians.
The soldiers of that nation, dissatisfied with not having
received their pay for some years, and having learnt that
their companions had been magnificently rewarded by Totila,
resolved to follow their example. They agreed with the
king of the Goths to open the gate confided to their guard,
which perfidy they executed at the time appointed. Totila
caused his trumpets to be sounded at the side opposite to that
by which he entered the city. The garrison immediately
hastened where the danger seemed most pressing, and by
this artifice the Goths met with no resistance. The commander
of the Roman cavalry, named Paul of Cilicia, seeing
that the city was taken, shut himself up, with four hundred
horse, in the mausoleum of Adrian, and took possession of
the bridge which leads to the church of St. Peter. He was
attacked by the Goths, whose efforts he so warmly repulsed,
that Totila determined to reduce his party by famine.
This intrepid little band remained a day and a night without
taking food, and then determined to die with honour. After
taking a last farewell, and embracing each other, they opened
the gates with a determination to fall upon the enemy like
desperate men, when Totila proposed moderate and honourable
conditions to them. They accepted them, and all took arms
under his banner. Totila, become master of Rome a second
time, restored it to its pristine splendour, and re-established
as many of the citizens as could be found.âNarses, the
general of the empire, having conquered and killed Totila,
retook Rome, which opposed but a feeble resistance.

ELEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1084.

We have seen Rome besieged in its early days, when its
walls were of mud; we have seen it besieged by its own
79

sons, by the Gauls, by the barbarians; but it was still, as a
warlike city, the head of a kingdom, a republic, an empire.
We have now to see it besieged in a new character,âas the
seat of the head of the Christian world. As if Rome was
destined always to be royal, she took the same place with
regard to the Church she had occupied as a temporal
power; and every reader of history will allow that there has
not been much less ambition, strife, and political chicanery
in the latter state than in any of the former. From its foundation,
Rome has always been Rome, seldom or never at
rest, either within itself or with its neighbours.

âThe long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been
recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of the haughty
Gregory VII. Henry III., king of Germany and Italy,
and afterwards emperor of the West, and the pope had degraded
each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal
or spiritual throne of his antagonist. After the defeat
and death of his Swabian rebel, Henry descended into Italy
to assume the imperial crown, and to drive from the Vatican
the tyrant of the Church. But the Roman people adhered
to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by
supplies of men and money from Apulia; and the city was
thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany. In
the fourth year he corrupted, it is said, with Byzantine gold,
the nobles of Rome. The gates, the bridges, and fifty
hostages were delivered into his hands; the anti-pope,
Clement III., was consecrated in the Lateran; the grateful
pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican, and the
emperor fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the successor
of Augustus and Charlemagne. The ruins of the Septigonium
were still defended by the nephew of Gregory; the
pope himself was invested in the castle of St. Angelo, and
his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his Norman
vassal. Their friendship had been interrupted by some
reciprocal injuries and complaints; but on this pressing
occasion, Guiscard was urged by the obligation of his oath,
by his interest,âmore potent than oaths,âby the love of
fame, and his enmity to the two emperors. Unfurling the holy
banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the
apostles; the most numerous of his armies, thirty thousand
foot and six thousand horse, was instantly assembled, and
80

his march from Salerno to Rome was animated by the public
applause and the promise of the divine favour. Henry,
invincible in sixty-six battles, trembled at his approach;
recollecting some indispensable affairs that required his
presence in Lombardy, he exhorted the Romans to persevere
in their allegiance, and hastily retired, three days before the
entrance of the Normans. In less than three years, the son
of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of delivering the
pope, and of compelling the two emperors of the East and
West to fly before his victorious arms. But the triumph of
Robert was clouded by the calamities of Rome. By the
aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated
or scaled, but the imperial faction was still powerful and
active; on the third day the people rose in a furious tumult,
and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or
revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage. The Saracens
of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and the auxiliaries of his
brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning
the holy city of the Christians; and many thousands of the
citizens, in the sight and by the allies of their spiritual
father, were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a
spacious quarter of the city, from the Lateran to the
Colosseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to
perpetual solitude.â
3

TWELFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1527.

The emperor Charles V., irritated against the pope,
Clement VII., his mortal enemy, charged the duke of
Bourbon, in 1527, to seek every means in his power to
avenge him upon the pontiff. The duke was a renegade
Frenchman, of considerable military skill, and a restless disposition.
He had quarrelled with his master, Francis I.,
and was deemed of so much consequence as to be countenanced
by Francisâs rival, Charles V., and to be intrusted
with the highest military command he could confer. The
duke was at the head of fourteen thousand men, who loved
and adored him, and who swore, BrantÃ´me says, âto follow
him wherever he went, were it to the devil.â Followed by
81

these troops, he marched towards Rome, and immediately
laid siege to it. The soldiers, animated by the desire of
pillage, mounted to the assault with incredible energy,
Bourbon encouraging them by his example. But as this
prince, with characteristic ambition, was endeavouring to be
the first upon the ramparts, he was killed by a musket-shot.
The fall of the general, so far from relaxing the valour of
his soldiers, excited their vengeance; they rushed more
fiercely to the assault of the walls, they mowed down their
defenders like grass, quickly made themselves masters of
Rome, and committed the most frightful ravages.

This superb city, taken so many times by the barbarians,
was never pillaged with more fury than it was by the hands
of Christians. The Pope took refuge in the castle of
St. Angelo, and was besieged with such rancour, that a
woman was hung for passing up to him a basket of lettuce
by a cord suspended from the castle. Cardinal Pulci, who
was shut up with the Pope, made an attempt to escape,
which cost him his life. He had scarcely left the castle
when he fell from his horse; his foot hung in the stirrup,
and the animal dragged him at speed over the bridge of the
castle. After being blockaded for a month, and reduced to
great want of provisions, the Pope was forced to capitulate
with the prince of Orange, who had succeeded the duke of
Bourbon in the command of the imperial troops. He agreed
to pay four hundred thousand ducats, and to place himself
at the disposal of the Emperor. Charles V. affected regret
at the detention of the Pontiff.

Eight days before this event, a man dressed as a hermit,
of about sixty years of age, went through the streets of
Rome, about midnight, sounding a handbell, and pronouncing
with a loud voice the following words: âThe anger of
God will soon fall upon this city!â The Pope obtained
nothing from the examination he made of this man; the
severest tortures could draw no more from him than this
terrifying oracle: âThe anger of God will soon fall upon
this city!â When the prince of Orange became master of
the city, he liberated him from prison, and offered him a
considerable sum of money. He, however, refused reward,
three days after disappeared, and was never again heard of.

The imperial army left Rome, loaded with a booty of more
82

than eighteen millions of crowns, every private soldier having
an immense sum. The obsequies of the duke of Bourbon
were celebrated with great pomp, and his body was conveyed
to Gaeta.

THIRTEENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1796â1799.

The temporal power of the popes had long ceased to be an
object of jealousy for Christian princes: the small extent of
their states, the respect which was entertained for their
ministry, and their abstinence from military enterprises, preserved
peace in a city which had formerly, and for many
centuries, made the world tremble with the terror of its
arms. Louis XIV. and Louis XV. had satisfied themselves
with seizing the Venaissian county, to punish the popes for
some affronts offered to their crowns; and the pontiffs, conscious
of their weakness, had acknowledged their errors and
disavowed the acts of their ministers. But it was not thus
when the French revolution broke out. Pius VI., irritated
at seeing at once both his annates and the Venaissian county
wrested from his hands, entered into the league of the kings
against France. In no city were the French more hated
than in Rome. Basseville, the French envoy, was massacred
in a riot, which the government of the Pope had allowed to
be got up with more than suspected negligence. The troops
of the Pope were preparing to unite themselves with those
of the other powers of Italy, when Buonaparte was seen to
enter that country, in 1796, as a conqueror. His victories
seemed to foretell the destruction of the Holy See. Republican
enthusiasm was awakened on the banks of the Tiber;
nothing was talked of but rebuilding the Capitol and founding
a new Roman republic.

The French general had conquered the duchy of Urbino,
Romagna, and the march of Ancona. The terrified Pope
sued for peace: Buonaparte granted him at first a truce, and
then a peace. The Pope yielded to the republic the legations
of Bologna and Ferrara, which the French had already
conquered, and all the shores of the Adriatic Gulf, from the
mouths of the Po to Ancona. A month after, the Pope weakly
allowed some of his subjects to take up arms, in consequence
of a supposed reverse suffered by Buonaparte. The latter
83

contented himself with chastising some villages of Ferrara,
which had excited the revolt. A third time Buonaparte
pardoned him, and his pardon was ratified by the French
Directory: Joseph Buonaparte was appointed ambassador to
Rome. Party spirit was, however, too strong; the apparent
moderation of the French could not bring the court of Rome
to pacific sentiments. Its hatred against France was kept
alive by the queen of Naples, who threw open the ports of
the Mediterranean to the English. In addition to this, a
long hesitation to acknowledge the Cisalpine republic; then
the nomination of General Provera to command the army of
the Pope, and a course of proceedings which announced the
intention, but which did not give the means, of entering
into a fresh war: the French ambassador forced the Pope to
declare himself in a positive manner. Everything seemed
appeased; there was a calm, but it was such a one as precedes
the eruption of a volcano. On the 28th of December,
1797, a fresh seditious movement broke out in Rome; some
men assembled round the house of the ambassador, uttering
revolutionary cries. Scarcely had they preluded by a few acts
of apparent insurrection, when the troops of the Pope came
up, dispersed the rioters, and pursued them into the palace of
the ambassador, whither their fear had driven them. Joseph
Buonaparte insisted upon his residence being respected, and
promised to give up the guilty; but he was answered by a
shower of balls, by which his windows were broken to pieces.
He interposed everywhere between those who struck and
those who were stricken. One of his friends, the Adjutant-General
Duphot, who was to have married his sister-in-law
the next day, was an object of his greatest care; but he was
assassinated close to his side: his inanimate body was
stabbed by the ruffians in a hundred places: the French
had great difficulty in rescuing it from the hands of these
furious men. The court of Rome offered the French ambassador
all kinds of reparation; but the latter thought it
not prudent or dignified to remain longer in a palace which
had been so shamefully violated, where he and his whole
family had been insulted, and whose floors were still stained
with the blood of his friend. Cardinal Doria in vain had
recourse to the Spanish ambassador to pacify him: the whole
French legation quitted Rome. The Consistory believed, in
84

this peril, that the court of Naples would keep its word, and
would hasten to send its promised succours; but it received
nothing but an excuse, to amuse or appease the French
government, till the Neapolitan army was on its march.
The Directory, however, was inflexible: a month had scarcely
passed away when a French army, led by General Alexander
Berthier, was at the gates of Rome, and had taken possession
of the castle of St. Angelo. On the 17th of February,
1798, the anniversary of the Popeâs election, an insurrection
broke out in the capital. His palace was invested, but
respect checked the insurgents at the entrance. They
met with resistance nowhere; they abstained from violence
or insult towards the Pope, but they declared Rome free;
they claimed for themselves the honour of being of the blood
of the Catos and Scipios; and the boasted descendants of
Camillus threw open the gates to the Gauls. A deputation
arrived at the French camp; General Berthier mounted the
steps of the Capitol, and saluted a new Roman republic;
but the Romans had no longer the virtues of their fathers:
no thing can bear less resemblance to another, than modern
Romans do to ancient Romans. Consuls, tribunes, and
popular laws, were once more to be seen in Rome; and these
decrees wanted nothing but to be applied to a people who
entertained a love of the republic. Its reign was short and
tempestuous; and the French Directory took no measures calculated
to gain the affection of the Romans. The aged Pope was
sent to France, but died on the road; the wealth and the
master-pieces of art were carried off, the people became dissatisfied,
and a fresh insurrection quickly broke out against
the men they had so recently hailed as their liberators: they
were obliged to be suppressed with the strong hand. Whilst
Buonaparte was in Egypt, the king of Naples supposed the
time most fit for an outbreak of the Italian states, to liberate
themselves from the domination of the French. He marched
at the head of seventy thousand Neapolitans, the real command
of whom was intrusted to the Austrian general Mack,
and entered the Roman territory. The French army which
occupied it only consisted of sixteen thousand men, disseminated
over all the points. Championnet, who commanded
them, thought it best to retire to Upper Italy. The king
of Sicily and General Mack entered Rome on the 25th of
85

November, 1798; Championnet gathered together his army
and stood his ground. Mack, after several days of hesitation,
ventured to attack him on the other side of the Tiber.
The French, though vastly inferior in numbers, repulsed the
Neapolitans; in three days, they made eleven thousand
prisoners. Mack beheld his columns flying in the greatest
disorder; and, being unable to rally them, abandoned the
capital of the Christian world, covered himself with the
Teverone, and was pursued by the French, who possessed
themselves successively of Capua and Naples. This occupation
lasted but a short time; the French under SchÃ©rer
being beaten in Upper Italy, abandoned Naples and Rome,
to defend themselves against the Austrians and the Russians.
Ferdinand went back to Naples, and occupied Rome till it
returned to its obedience to Pius VII.

Rome has since that time been more than once humbled
by the French; but as nothing like a siege has taken place,
the events of its further history do not fall within our
plan.

NINEVEH.

A.C. 747.

We
must now take a retrograde step, and turn our eyes
upon a city, the name of which will ever be famous on its
own account, and from its connection with the Scriptures.
And yet the siege of Nineveh furnishes but few particulars
for narration: it is, however, a remarkable circumstance,
that, according to the best chronologers, Rome was founded
the very year that Nineveh was destroyed.

Sardanapalus, king of Assyria, surpassed all his predecessors
in effeminacy, luxury, and cowardice. He never
went out of his palace, but spent all his time among his
women, dressed and painted in the same manner as they
were, and employed, in imitation of them, in the labours of
the distaff. His whole glory consisted in his treasures, and
all his time was devoted to the indulgence of infamous and
criminal pleasures.

Arbaces, governor of Media, having found means to get
86

into his palace and behold Sardanapalus in the midst of his
infamous seraglio, was so disgusted with the idea that so
many brave men should be subject to such an effeminate
being, that he immediately formed a conspiracy against him.
Belesis, governor of Babylon, and several others entered into
it. On the rumour of this revolt, the king hid himself in
the innermost recesses of his palace. Being afterwards
obliged to take the field with some forces his captains had
got together, he at first gained three successive victories
over the enemy, but was in the end overcome and pursued
to the gates of Nineveh. He here shut himself up, convinced
that the rebels would never be able to take a city so wonderfully
fortified by nature and art, and so abundantly stored
with provisions. The siege proved of very great length. It
had been declared by an ancient oracle, that Nineveh could
never be taken unless the river became an enemy to the city.
This buoyed up Sardanapalus, because he looked upon the
thing as impossible. But when he saw that the Tigris by a
violent inundation had thrown down twenty stadia of the
city wall, and by that means opened a passage to the enemy,
he understood the meaning of the oracle, and looked upon
himself as lost. He resolved, however, to die in such a manner
as, in his opinion, would cover the infamy of his scandalous
life. He ordered a vast pile of wood to be collected
in his palace, and setting fire to it, burnt himself, his
women, his eunuchs, and his treasures. AthenÃ¦us makes
these treasures amount to a thousand myriads of talents of
gold, and ten times as many talents of silver (about fourteen
hundred millions sterling), which, without reckoning anything
else, appears to exceed credibility.

We cannot wonder that the Assyrian empire should fall
under such a man; but it was not till after it had passed
through various augmentations, diminutions, and revolutions,
common to most great states during a course of ages. This
empire had subsisted above 1,450 years. Of the ruins of
this vast empire were formed three considerable kingdoms:
that of the Medes, which Arbaces, the head of the conspiracy,
restored to its liberty; that of the Assyrians of
Babylon, which was given to Belesis, governor of that city;
and that of the Assyrians of Nineveh, whose first king took
the name of Ninus the Second.

87

A hundred years after the death of Sardanapalus, under
the reign of Saracus, named Cyndauladanus, Nebopalassar,
general of his armies, revolted against him, for the purpose
of obtaining his throne. He allied himself with Cyaxares,
king of the Medes. Their united forces besieged Saracus
in Nineveh; they took the city, killed the monarch, and
entirely destroyed that celebrated place, A.C. 648.

AZOTH, or AZOTUS.

A.C. 670.

As
the siege of Azoth, although the longest recorded in
history, affords but little matter for relation, we will indulge
our young readers with a few of the circumstances which
preceded it.

After the death of Tharaca, the last Ethiopian king who
reigned in Egypt, the Egyptians, not being able to agree
about the succession, were two years in a state of anarchy,
during which there were great disorders among them. At
last, twelve of the principal noblemen, conspiring together,
seized upon the kingdom, and divided it among themselves
into as many parts. It was agreed by them that each
should govern his own district with equal power and
authority, and that no one should attempt to invade or seize
the dominions of another. They thought it necessary to
make this agreement, and to bind it with the most solemn
oaths, to elude the prediction of an oracle, which had foretold
that he among them who should offer his libation to
Vulcan out of a brazen bowl, should gain the sovereignty
of Egypt. They reigned together fifteen years in the
utmost harmony: and, to leave a lasting monument of their
concord to posterity, they jointly, and at a common expense,
built the famous labyrinth, which was a pile of building
consisting of twelve large palaces, with as many edifices
underground as appeared above it.

One day, as the twelve kings were assisting at a solemn and
periodical sacrifice offered in the temple of Vulcan, the priest
88

having to present each of them a golden bowl for the libation,
one was wanting. Upon this Psammetichus, without any
design, supplied the place of this bowl with his brazen
helmet, of which each wore one, and with it performed the
ceremony of the libation. This accident struck the rest of
the kings, and recalled to their memory the prediction of
the oracle above-mentioned. They thought it therefore
necessary to secure themselves against his attempts, and,
with one consent, banished him into the fenny parts of
Egypt.

After Psammetichus had passed several years there,
awaiting a favourable opportunity to revenge himself for
this affront, a messenger brought him advice that brazen
men were landed in Egypt. These were Grecian soldiers,
Carians and Ionians, who had been cast upon the coast of
Egypt by a storm, and were completely covered with
helmets, cuirasses, and other arms of brass. Psammetichus
immediately called to mind an oracle which had answered
him, that he should be succoured by brazen men from the
sea-coast. He did not doubt that the prediction was now
fulfilled. He made a league with these strangers; engaged
them by great promises to stay with him; privately levied
other forces, and put these Greeks at their head. Giving
battle to the eleven kings, he defeated them, and remained
sole possessor of Egypt.

As this prince owed his success to the Ionians and
Carians, he settled them in Egypt, from which all foreigners
had been excluded; and by assigning them sufficient lands
and fixed revenues, he made them forget their native
country. By his order Egyptian children were put under
their care, to learn the Greek tongue; and on this occasion,
and by this means, the Egyptians began to have a correspondence
with the Greeks; and from that era the Egyptian
history, which till then had been intermixed with pompous
fables, by the artifices of the priests, begins, according to
Herodotus, to speak with greater truth and certainty.

As soon as Psammetichus was settled on the throne, he
engaged in war against the king of Assyria, on the subject
of the boundaries of the two empires. This war was of long
continuance. Ever since Syria had been conquered by the
Assyrians, Palestine, being the only country that separated
89

the two kingdoms, was the subject of continual discord, as
afterwards it was between the Ptolemies and SeleucidÃ¦.
They were eternally contending for it, and it was alternately
won by the stronger. Psammetichus, seeing himself the
peaceable possessor of all Egypt, and having restored the
ancient form of government, thought it high time for him
to look to his frontiers, and to secure them against the
Assyrians, his neighbours, whose power increased daily.
For this purpose he entered Palestine at the head of an
army.

Perhaps we are to refer to the beginning of this war an
incident related by Diodorus, that the Egyptians, provoked
to see the Greeks posted on the right wing by the king
himself, in preference to them, quitted his service to the
number of upwards of two hundred thousand men, and
retired into Ethiopia, where they met with a good settlement.

Be this as it may, Psammetichus entered Palestine, where
his career was stopped by Azotus, one of the principal cities
of the country, which gave him so much trouble, that he was
forced to besiege it twenty-nine years before he could take
it. This is the longest siege mentioned in history. This
was anciently one of the five capital cities of the Philistines.
The Egyptians having seized it some time before, had fortified
it with such care that it was their strongest bulwark on
that side. Nor could Sennacherib enter Egypt till he had
made himself master of this city, which was taken by Tartan,
one of his generals. The Assyrians had possessed it
hitherto, and it was not till after the long siege just now
mentioned that the Egyptians recovered it.

The extraordinary length of this siege ceases to surprise
us, when we consider that a siege was nothing but a badly-guarded
blockade, where that was expected from lassitude
and famine which could not be obtained by either bodily
strength, which necessarily failed against stone walls, or by
military art, which had not yet learnt how to overthrow
them, or even to scale them.

TYRE.

We
now come to the sieges undergone by one of the
most interesting cities of antiquity. How many of our
youthful associations are connected with this great commercial
cityâthe birthplace of Dido, the city in the labours
of whose siege we have accompanied Alexander! And yet
it appears to us that there is one reflection belonging to
Tyre which should strike an Englishman more forcibly than
even his schoolday remembrances of it. Tyre was the
greatest commercial city of antiquity, as England is the
greatest commercial nation of modern times. It was, as
England is, a great entrepÃ´t between two divisions of the
world, a situation, whether of Tyre, Thebes, Palmyra, Alexandria,
Venice, or England, which more than compensates
for barrenness of soil, inconveniences of climate, or many of
the evils from which other fortunate countries are exempt.
If wealth be manâs principal object, a great â
carrying
â
country is the place where industry and enterprise are most
likely to meet with a reward. But in the extract we are
about to make, our readers will see, what all history tells,
that no countries are so likely to become luxurious, sensual,
and corrupt, as those states which commerce has gorged
with wealth. The fate of Tyre is an eloquent lesson to
England.

Tyre was built by the Sidonians, two hundred and forty
years before the temple of Jerusalem; for this reason it is
called by Isaiah âthe daughter of Sidon.â It soon surpassed
its mother city in extent, power, and riches. It
was besieged by Shalmaneser, and alone resisted the united
fleets of the Assyrians and the PhÅnicians, which greatly
heightened its pride. Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Tyre,
at the time that Ithobalous was king of that city, but did
not take it till thirteen years after. But before it was conquered
the inhabitants had retired, with most of their effects,
into a neighbouring island, where they built a new city.
91

The old one was razed to the very foundation, and has
since been no more than a village, known by the name
of âPalÃ¦ Tyrus,â or ancient Tyre; but the new city rose
to greater power than the former.

Tyre was in the most flourishing condition at the time of
Alexander the Great. That city boasted of being the inventor
of navigation. The inhabitants, by their skill and
industry, made their port the great mart of commerce, and
by their courtesy conciliated all who came to it: it was
deemed the common city of all nations, and the centre of
commerce.

With the exception of Tyre, Syria and Palestine were
already subdued by the Macedonians. Upon Alexanderâs
advancing towards it, the Tyrians sent him an embassy, with
presents for himself and refreshments for his army. They
were willing to have him for their friend, but not for their
master; so that when he expressed a wish to enter the city,
in order to offer a sacrifice to Hercules, its tutelar god, they
refused him admission. This ill suited the haughty spirit
of the young conqueror, and he resolved to obtain by force
what was refused as a courtesy. The Tyrians, on their side,
confident in their wealth and strength, resolved to maintain
the position they had assumed. Tyre was at that time
situated on an island, about a quarter of a league from the
continent; it was surrounded by a strong wall a hundred
and fifty feet high, which was washed by the sea. The
Carthaginians, who were a colony from Tyre, promised to
assist in the contest, which greatly increased the confidence
of the Tyrians. The island resounded with warlike preparations;
machines were fixed on the ramparts and towers,
the young men were armed, and workshops were built for
the artificers, of whom there were great numbers in the
city. They likewise made great store of iron grapples, to
throw on the enemyâs works and tear them away; as also
cramp-irons, and other instruments invented for the defence
of cities.

Alexander had strong reasons for wishing to subdue Tyre.
He could not invade Egypt with safety whilst the Persians
were masters of the sea; and he could not think of leaving
behind a large extent of country, whose inhabitants were
but doubtful friends. He likewise was apprehensive of
92

commotions and intrigues at home whilst he was pursuing
Darius. The conquest of Tyre would make the whole of
PhÅnicia safe, would dispossess Persia of half its navy, and
would lay open to him the isle of Cyprus and all Egypt.

It was impossible to approach the city near enough to
storm it, without making a causeway from the mainland to
the island, and this seemed to be attended with insurmountable
difficulties. The little arm of the sea was exposed to
the west winds, which sometimes raised such storms as must
sweep away any works of art. Besides, the city being surrounded
by the waves, and the wall projecting into the sea
at the lower part, scaling-ladders or batteries could only be
fixed in the ships; and the machines could not be expected
to do much execution from unsteady galleys upon tumultuous
waves.

Obstacles, however, only increased the determination of
Alexander. But as his ships were few and at a distance, he
at first attempted to come to an accommodation. He sent
heralds to propose a peace; but these the Tyrians killed,
contrary to the laws of nations, and threw them from the
top of the walls into the sea. Alexander, highly exasperated,
immediately set about making a dyke. He found
materials in the stones and rubbish of old Tyre; and Mount
Libanus, so famous for its cedars, furnished him with piles
and other timbers.

No general excelled Alexander in the art of urging his
soldiers to any undertaking he wished to be executed, and,
under his own personal supervision, the dyke advanced
rapidly; the piles were driven with ease into the slime, which
served as mortar to the stones, and they were too far from
the city to meet with interruption. But as they advanced
into deep water, the difficulties of operation became greater,
and the workmen were constantly annoyed by the darts
and arrows from the walls. Being masters of the sea, the
Tyrians attacked the people and injured the works in boats,
jeering them with crying, âSee what capital beasts of burden
these conquering heroes make!â and then asking âwhether
their master thought himself greater than Neptune; and
whether he thought he could prevail over that god?â

But these taunts only inflamed the soldiers; the work
went on without delay, and the Tyrians were at length
93

alarmed at discovering what a vast undertaking the sea had
concealed from them: the bold and level surface appeared
above the waves, and approached the city. The inhabitants
then came in shoals of barks, to annoy the workmen with
darts, javelins, and even fire; and the Greeks were forced
to stay their labour to defend themselves from the missiles
cast from the swiftly-moving boats. Skins and sails were
then had recourse to screen them, and two wooden
towers were raised at the head of the bank, to prevent the
approach of the enemy.

On the other side the Tyrians made a descent upon the
shore, out of view of the camp, landed some soldiers, and
cut to pieces the men engaged in carrying the stones; some
Arabian peasants likewise killed about thirty Macedonians
on Mount Libanus, and took several prisoners. These
small losses induced Alexander to divide his troops into
separate bodies.

The besieged were not backward in either exertions,
inventions, or stratagems. They took a transport vessel,
and filling it with vine-branches and other dry materials,
they made a large inclosure near the prow, which they filled
with sulphur, pitch, and other combustible matters. In
the middle of this inclosure they set up two masts, to each
of which they fixed two sailyards, whence hung kettles
full of oil and other unctuous substances. To raise the
prow, they loaded the latter part of the vessel with stones
and sand, and putting it out to sea, by means of their galleys
towed it towards the towers. They then ignited this
ancient fire-ship, the sailors who were in it leaping into the
sea and swimming away. The fire quickly caught the
towers and the works at the head of the causeway, and the
sails, flapping about, threw oil upon the fire, and increased
its violence. To prevent the Macedonians from extinguishing
the flames, the Tyrians, from their galleys and
boats, kept up a continual discharge of darts and burning
torches. Several Macedonians were either shot or burnt to
death on the causeway, whilst others, throwing down their
arms or tools, leaped into the sea. But as they swam, the
Tyrians, preferring to have them as prisoners, maimed their
hands with clubs and stones, and, after disabling them,
carried them off. At the same time the besieged, in their
94

small boats, beat down the edges of the causeway, tore up
the stakes, and burnt the rest of the engines.

But Alexander, unlike Buonaparte, was never discouraged
by apparent failures. His exertions to repair the causeway
and construct fresh machines quite astonished the enemy.
As every general should be during great operations,
Alexander was present and superintended every part of
the works. The dyke was nearly completed, when an impetuous
wind drove the waves with such fury against it,
that the cement and all gave way, and the water, rushing
between the stones, broke it in the middle. As soon as the
great heap of stones which supported the earth was thrown
down, the whole sunk at once as into an abyss.

Even Alexander for a moment debated whether he should
abandon his enterprise or not; but his indomitable genius
prevailed, and the soldiers began a new mole with as much
alacrity as if they had but that moment arrived before the
city.

Alexander became aware that he could neither complete
the causeway nor take the city whilst the Tyrians were
masters at sea. He therefore assembled all his galleys before
Sidon. The fame of his victory at Issus brought him
a considerable accession of naval force; several Asiatic
monarchs hastening to pay their court to the conqueror, by
supplying him with that of which he stood most in need.

The king, whilst his soldiers were preparing the ships and
engines, took some troops of horse and his own regiment of
guards, and marched towards a mountain of Arabia, called
Antilibanus. His affection for his old tutor Lysimachus,
who followed him in this expedition, exposed him to one of
those dangers which we often find great men, as well as
heroes of romance, running into. Lysimachus was evidently
a courtier as well as an able tutor, for he knew his
pupilâs weak point, and called him Achilles and himself
PhÅnix. When the king arrived at the foot of the mountain,
he leaped from his horse and began to walk. His troops got
a considerable distance in advance of him. It became late,
but Alexander would not leave his tutor, who was corpulent
and short of breath, and was soon, with the exception of a few
soldiers, separated from his little army. He was compelled
to spend the whole night in this unguarded state very near
95

to a numerous body of the enemy. His good fortune, however,
prevailed,âhe passed the night in safety, and coming
up with his troops in the morning, he advanced into the
country, took all the strong places, either by force or capitulation,
and, on the eleventh day returned to Sidon, where
he found a welcome reinforcement of four thousand Greeks
from Peloponnesus.

The fleet being ready, Alexander, with some chosen soldiers
of his guard, embarked and sailed towards Tyre, in
order of battle. He himself was on the extremity of the
right wing, which extended towards the main ocean, accompanied
by the kings of Cyprus and PhÅnicia; the left was
commanded by Craterus. The Tyrians were at first inclined
to give battle, but on beholding the strength of the Grecian
line, they thought it best to keep their fleet in port and
endeavour to prevent the enemy from entering. When
Alexander saw this, he advanced nearer the city, and, finding
it impossible to force the port towards Sidon, on account of
the narrowness of the entrance and the number of galleys
there posted with their prows turned towards the main ocean,
he only sunk three of them which lay without, and afterwards
came to an anchor with his whole fleet pretty near the
mole, where his ships rode in safety.

While all these things were going on, the construction of
the mole was prosecuted with great vigour. The workmen
threw in whole trees, with all their branches on them, and
laid great stones over them; upon these they placed other
trees, covering the latter with a kind of unctuous earth,
which served instead of mortar. Heaping more trees and
stones upon these in the same manner, the whole formed one
entire body. This causeway was made wider than the
former, so that the towers which were built in the middle
would be out of the reach of the darts and arrows discharged
by the boats from the sides. The besieged, on the other
hand, did all in their power to stop the progress of the
work. But nothing was more useful to them than the
operations of their divers, who, swimming under water,
came unperceived quite up to the bank, and with hooks,
drew such branches to them as projected beyond the work,
and pulling forward with great strength, forced away
everything that was over them. But, notwithstanding
96

all obstacles, the Macedonian perseverance prevailed, and
the dyke was brought to perfection. Military engines of all
kinds were placed upon the causeway, in order to shake the
walls; and showers of darts, arrows, stones, and burning
torches were poured upon the besieged.

Alexander ordered the Cyprian fleet to take its station
before the harbour which lay towards Sidon, and that of
PhÅnicia before the harbour on the side of the causeway
facing Egypt, towards the part where his own tent was
pitched, and then made preparations for attacking the city
on every side. The Tyrians on their part prepared for a
vigorous defence. They had erected towers on the parts of
the walls next the causeway, of prodigious height and proportionate
width, composed of large stones cemented with
mortar. The access to any other part was almost as difficult,
immense stones being placed along the foot of the wall,
to keep the enemy from approaching it. These must be
removed; and the Macedonians found the task the more
difficult from being unable to stand firmly upon their legs
on board the ships. Besides, the Tyrians advanced with
covered galleys, and cut the ropes which held the Grecian
ships at anchor; so that Alexander was obliged to cover in
like manner several vessels of thirty rowers each, and to station
these across, to secure the anchors from the attacks of
the Tyrian galleys; but the divers cutting the cables of
these, the king ordered the anchors to be secured by iron
chains. After this, the large stones were drawn away into
deep water by cable ropes, where they could do no harm.
The foot of the wall being thus cleared, the vessels had very
easy access to it, so that the Tyrians were invested on all
sides, and attacked by sea and land.

The Macedonians had joined (two-and-two) galleys of
four banks of oars, in such a manner that the prows were
fastened, and the sterns so far distant from one another as
was necessary for the pieces of timber between them to be
of proper length. After this, they threw from one stern to
the other sailyards, which were fastened together by planks
laid across, that the soldiers might stand firmly on that space.
The galleys being thus equipped, they rowed towards the
city, and shot, under cover, against those who defended the
walls, the prows serving them as so many battlements. The
97

king ordered them to advance about midnight, in order to
surround the walls and make a general assault. The
Tyrians now gave themselves up for lost, when on a sudden
the sky was overspread with such thick clouds as quite took
away the faint glimmerings of light which before darted
through the gloom. The sea rose by insensible degrees, and
the billows, being swelled by the fury of the winds, raised a
dreadful storm. The vessels dashed against each other with
so much violence, that the cables which fastened them
together were either loosened or broken to pieces; the
planks, splitting with a horrible crash, carried off the soldiers
with them; the tempest was so furious, that it became
impossible to steer or manage galleys thus fastened together.
The soldier was a hinderance to the sailor, and the sailor to
the soldier; and, as frequently happens on such occasions,
those took the command whose business it was to obey;
fear and anxiety throwing all things into confusion. But
the rowers exerted themselves with such vigour, that they
succeeded in getting the ships ashore, although in a shattered
condition.

At this critical minute, thirty ambassadors arrived from
Carthage without bringing any of the succour that had been
so boastingly promised by that state. There was, however,
some validity in their excuse: they had war at home; the
Syracusans were laying waste all Africa, and had pitched
their camp not far from the walls of Carthage. The Tyrians,
though their hopes were thus frustrated, were not dejected;
they only took the wise precaution to send their women and
children to Carthage, that they might be in a condition to
defend themselves to the last extremity, and bear courageously
the worst calamities that could befall them, when
they had placed in security that which they held dearest in
the world.

There was in the city a brazen statue of Apollo, of enormous
size: this colossus had formerly stood in the city of
Gela, in Sicily. The Carthaginians having taken it about
the year 412 before Christ, had given it by way of present
to the city of Tyre, which they always considered as the
mother of Carthage. The Tyrians had set it up in their
city, and worship was paid to it. During the siege, in consequence
of a dream which one of the citizens had, the
98

Tyrians imagined that Apollo was determined to leave them,
and go over to Alexander. Immediately they fastened with a
gold chain his statue to the altar of Hercules, to prevent
the deity from leaving them.

Some of the Tyrians proposed the restoring of an old
sacrifice which had been discontinued many years; this was,
that of a child of free-born parents to Saturn. The Carthaginians,
who had borrowed their superstitions from the
Tyrians, preserved it till the destruction of their city; and
had not the old men, who were invested with much authority
in Tyre, opposed the design, this cruel custom would
have prevailed over every sentiment of humanity.

The Tyrians, finding their city every moment exposed to
be taken by storm, resolved to fall upon the Cyprian fleet,
which lay at anchor on the side towards Sidon. They took
the opportunity to do this when the seamen of Alexanderâs
fleet were dispersed in various directions, and when he himself
was withdrawn to his tent pitched on the sea-shore.
Accordingly, they came out about noon, with thirteen galleys,
all manned with choice soldiers accustomed to sea-fights,
and, rowing with all their might, came thundering on the
enemyâs vessels. Part of them they found empty, and the
rest had been manned in great haste. Some of these they
sunk, and drove several against the shore, where they were
dashed to pieces. The loss would have been still greater,
had not Alexander, the instant he heard of the sally, advanced
at the head of the whole fleet, with all imaginable
despatch, against the Tyrians. They did not, however,
await his coming, but withdrew into the harbour, after
having lost some of their ships.

And now, the engines being in full play, the city was
warmly attacked, and as vigorously defended. The besieged,
taught and animated by the imminent danger and the
extreme necessity to which they were reduced, invented
daily new arts to defend themselves and repulse the enemy.
They warded off all the darts discharged from the balistas,
by the assistance of turning-wheels, which either broke
them to pieces or carried them another away. They deadened
the violence of the stones that were hurled at them, by
setting up sails and curtains made of soft substances, which
easily gave way. To annoy the ships which advanced against
99

the walls, they fixed cranes, grappling-irons, and scythes to
joists or beams; then, straining their catapultas (enormous
cross-bows), they laid these great pieces of timber upon them
instead of arrows, and shot them off on a sudden at the
enemy. These crushed some by their great weight, and the
hooks, or pensile scythes, with which they were armed, tore
others to pieces, and did considerable damage to the ships.
They also had brazen shields, which they drew red-hot out
of the fire, and filling them with burning sand, hurled them
from the top of the wall upon the enemy. There was
nothing the Macedonians so much dreaded as this last
invention; for the moment the burning sand got to the flesh
through the crevices in the armour, it pierced to the very
bone, and stuck so close that there was no pulling it off; so
that the soldiers, throwing down their arms, and tearing their
clothes to pieces, were exposed naked and defenceless to the
shot of the enemy.

Discouraged by this vigorous defence, Alexander debated
whether he had not better raise the siege and go into Egypt.
His conquests had been obtained quickly, and we can suppose
nothing more annoying to a man like âMacedoniaâs madmanâ
than a protracted siege. We cannot even fancy Buonaparte
a good captain at a siege; ambitious men, with views
always in advance of their present position, must think every
moment lost that detains them before the walls of a fortification.
On the other side, Alexander considered it would
be a blemish to his reputation, which had done him
greater service than his arms, should he leave Tyre behind
him as a proof that he was not invincible. He therefore
resolved to make a last effort, with a greater number of
ships, which he manned with the flower of his army.
Accordingly, a second naval engagement was fought, in
which the Tyrians, after a contest of great spirit, were
obliged to draw off their whole fleet towards the city. The
king pursued their rear very closely, but was not able to
enter the harbour, being repulsed by arrows shot from the
walls: however, he either took or sunk a great number of
their ships.

Alexander, after giving both army and fleet two daysâ
rest, made another assault. Both attack and defence were
now more vigorous than ever. The courage of the combatants
100

increased with the danger; and each side, animated by
the most powerful motives, fought like lions. Wherever
the battering-rams had beaten down any part of the wall,
and the bridges were thrown out, instantly the Argyraspides
mounted the breach with the utmost valour, being headed
by Admetus, one of the bravest officers in the army, who
was killed by the thrust of a partisan, as he was encouraging
his soldiers. The presence of the king, and especially the
example he set, fired his troops with more even than their
usual bravery. He himself ascended one of the towers,
which was of a prodigious height, and there was exposed to
the greatest danger his courage had ever made him hazard: for,
being immediately known by his insignia and the richness
of his armour, he served as a mark for all the arrows of the
enemy. On this occasion he performed wonders; killing
with javelins several of those who defended the wall; then
advancing nearer to them, he forced some with his sword,
and others with his shield, either into the city or the sea;
the tower where he fought almost touching the wall. He
soon passed on to it, by the assistance of floating bridges; and,
followed by his principal officers, possessed himself of two
towers, and the space between them. The battering-rams
had already made several breaches; the fleet had forced the
harbour, and some of the Macedonians had seized the towers
that were abandoned. The Tyrians, seeing the enemy
masters of their rampart, retired towards an open place called
the Square of Agenor, and there stood their ground; but
Alexander, marching up with his regiment of body-guards,
killed part of them, and obliged the rest to fly. At the
same time, the city being taken on the side which lay
towards the harbour, the Macedonians made great slaughter,
being highly exasperated at the long resistance of the
besieged, and the barbarities that had been exercised upon
some of their comrades.

The Tyrians, finding themselves overpowered in all quarters,
acted as men generally do on such occasions: some ran
to the temples, to implore the assistance of their gods;
others, shutting themselves up in their houses, escaped the
sword of the victor by a voluntary death; whilst the brave
remainder rushed upon the enemy, resolved to sell their
lives at the dearest rate. At first, the citizens resorted to
101

the customary defence of assaulted cities, and threw stones,
bricks, tiles, and everything that came to hand upon the
advancing Greeks. The king gave orders to kill all the inhabitants
except such as had taken refuge in the temples,
and to set fire to every part of Tyre. Although this order
was published by sound of trumpet, scarcely a person bearing
arms availed himself of the asylum pointed out. The temples
were principally filled by the young women and children
who had not gone to Carthage: the old men calmly awaited
at the doors of their houses the swords of the exasperated
soldiery. The Sidonians in Alexanderâs army, or rather
fleet, saved great numbers; for, remembering their common
origin, Agenor having founded both Tyre and Sidon, they
had been accustomed to consider the Tyrians as compatriots,
and did not desert them in their hour of need, though policy
had compelled them to assist in bringing it on. They conveyed
them privately on board their ships, and gave them a
home in Sidon. The extent of the slaughter may be imagined,
when we learn that six thousand soldiers were cut to pieces
on the ramparts. Of all great conquerors, we are disposed
to like Alexander the best; he had so many fine redeeming
qualities, and was such a rare combination of the high gifts
of valour and wisdom; therefore we write with regret,
that on this occasion the savage warrior prevailed over
the civilized Greek, and he immolated, by having them
nailed to crosses, two thousand men who were left after
the soldiers had glutted their revenge. He pardoned the
Carthaginian ambassadors, who had come to their ancient
metropolis to offer up their annual sacrifice to Hercules.
The number of prisoners, who were all sold into slavery,
amounted to thirty thousand. Notwithstanding the length
and obstinacy of the siege, the loss of the Macedonians was
trifling.

Alexander offered a sacrifice to Hercules, and celebrated
gymnastic games in honour of the great demigod. He had
the golden chains removed from the statue of Apollo, and
ordered that worship should thenceforward be offered to him
under the name of Philoalexander. The city of Tyre was
taken about the end of September, after a seven monthsâ
siege.

The fate of Tyre is said to be intimately associated with
102

the prophecies of Isaiah, and a great historian makes the
following remarks, which we are much afraid find illustration
in the histories of most great commercial
states:â

âOne of Godâs designs, in the prophecies just now cited,
is to give us a just idea of a traffic whose only motive is
avarice, and whose fruits are pleasures, vanity, and the corruption
of morals. Mankind look upon cities enriched by
commerce like that of Tyre (and it is the same by private
persons) as happier than any other; as worthy of envy,
and as fit, from their liberty, labour, and the success of their
application and conduct, as to be proposed as models for the
rest to copy after; but God, on the other hand, exhibits
them to us under the shameful image of a woman lost to all
sense of virtue, whose only view is to seduce and corrupt
youth; who only soothes the passions and flatters the
senses; who abhors modesty and every sentiment of honour;
and who, banishing from her countenance every indication
of shame, glories in her ignominy. We are not to infer
from this that traffic is sinful in itself; but we should separate
from the essential foundation of trade, which is just and
lawful, when rightly used, the passions and extravagantly
ambitious and selfish views of men, which intermix with it,
and pervert the order and the end of it.â

THIRD SIEGE, A.C. 313.

It would be imagined that a city so laid waste as Tyre
was by Alexander, could not easily or shortly recover strength
to contend against any enemy, and yet we find Tyre, only
nineteen years after, maintaining itself for fifteen months
against Antigonus, one of Alexanderâs captains, who had
been present at its great siege. But the fugitives from
Sidon and other parts, the women and children from Carthage,
with, most likely, many enterprising strangers,
thought the traditions of Tyre too great and tempting to
allow it to be long abandoned; and if not so glorious as it
had been, this queen of commercial cities soon became a
highly respectable mart, though its trade was reduced
within much narrower limits: it had embraced the world; it
was now confined to the neighbouring countries, and it
had lost the empire of the sea. Seconded by the famous
103

Demetrius Poliorcetes, his son, Antigonus presented himself
before the place with a numerous fleet, which made him
master of the sea, and cut the besieged off from supplies of
provisions. As the siege was too protracted to accord with
the other views of Antigonus, he left the operations under
the command of Andronicus, one of his generals, who, by
pressing the Tyrians very closely, and by making frequent
assaults, obliged them at length to capitulate. This important
conquest was made
A.C.
313.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 638.

The curse that was said to be upon Tyre was removed
after a considerable time: it received the gospel at an early
period, and was for ages a flourishing city. Before the discovery
of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, a place
so situated as Tyre was could not fail of being a mart of
trade; and as soon as the back of a conqueror, attracted by
its wealth, was turned, it was quickly partially re-peopled
and its industry revived.

But at length came the great Mussulman eruption;
Mahomet and his generals led their triumphant armies
through Asia with that astonishing rapidity and success
which have ever attended eastern conquests. In the West,
a conquest may be compared to a shower, which, insidiously
and with time, permeates the soil; in the East, it is a flood
or an avalanche, which overwhelms, devastates, and changes
everything in a moment.

Whilst the intrepid Amrou was making Syria tremble
with the fame of his victories, the perfidious Ioukinna accelerated
the triumphs of Mohammedanism by his stratagems.
The master of a fleet which had come to the succour of
Tripoli, he hoisted the Roman standard, and presented
himself before Tyre. His arrival caused much joy, for he
was supposed to bring ammunition and troops to put the place
in a state of defence. He landed with nine hundred men,
and was admitted into the city, but being betrayed by one
of his own people, the little band were surrounded and taken
prisoners. Their lives were only saved by a new subject of
alarm. JÃ«zid, a Saracen captain, appeared off Tyre with a
force of two thousand men. The governor, with his garrison,
104

went out to meet him, and, whilst the two parties were on
the walls, Ioukinna and his soldiers were set at liberty by a
Roman, who was looking for an opportunity to win the
favour of the Saracens. Ioukinna conveyed the intelligence
of his freedom to the soldiers he had left on board the fleet;
they joined him, and he informed JÃ«zid of what was going
on in Tyre. JÃ«zid not only defeated the governor and his
party, but cut off his retreat. The gates were thrown open,
and the Saracens, within and without, made a frightful
slaughter of the inhabitants. Most of those who escaped
embraced Islamism, to avoid death or slavery.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1123.

The Venetians, who for several ages had enjoyed the
commerce of the East, and dreaded breaking useful relations
with the Mussulmans of Asia, had taken but very little part
in the first crusade, or the events which followed it. They
awaited the issue of this great enterprise, to associate themselves
without peril with the victories of the Christians;
but at length, jealous of the advantages which the Genoese
and Pisans had obtained in Syria, they became desirous of
likewise sharing the spoils of the Mussulmans, and equipped
a formidable expedition against the infidels. Their fleet,
whilst crossing the Mediterranean, fell in with that of the
Genoese returning from the East, attacked it with fury, and
put it to flight in great disorder. After having stained the
sea with the blood of Christians, the Venetians pursued
their route towards the coasts of Palestine, where they met
the fleet of the Saracens, which had come out from the ports
of Egypt. A furious engagement ensued, in which the
Egyptian vessels were dispersed, and covered the waves with
their wrecks.

Whilst the Venetians were thus destroying the Mussulman
fleet, an army, sent by the caliph from Cairo, was
beaten by the Christians under the walls of Jaffa. The
doge of Venice, who commanded the fleet, entered the port
of PtolemaÃ¯s (Acre), and was conducted in triumph to
Jerusalem. Whilst celebrating the double victory gained
over the infidels, it was determined to turn this important
expedition to advantage. In a council held in presence of
105

the regent of Jerusalem and the doge of Venice, it was proposed
to besiege the city of Tyre, or that of Ascalon. As
opinions were divided, it was determined to consult God,
according to the superstitions of the time, and be guided by
the expression of his will. Two strips of parchment, upon
which were written the names of Tyre and Ascalon, were
deposited upon the altar of the Holy Sepulchre. Amidst
an immense crowd of spectators, a young orphan advanced
towards the altar, took one of the two strips, and it proved
to be that of the city of Tyre.

The Venetians, more devoted to the interests of their
commerce and their nation than to those of the Christian
kingdom, demanded, before they laid siege to Tyre, that
they should have a church, a street, a free oven, and a
national tribunal in all the cities of Palestine. They demanded
still further advantages; among which was one-third
of the conquered city. The conquest of Tyre seemed so
important, that the regent, the chancellor of the kingdom,
and the great vassals of the crown, accepted without hesitation
the conditions of the Venetians; in an act, which
history has preserved, they engaged not to acknowledge as
king of Jerusalem either Baldwin du Bourg, or any other
prince who should refuse to subscribe to it.

When they had thus shared by treaty a city they had not
yet conquered, they commenced their operations for the
siege. The Christian army left Jerusalem, and the Venetian
fleet the port of PtolemaÃ¯s, towards the beginning of spring.
The historian of the kingdom of Jerusalem, William of Tyre,
was for a long time archbishop of this celebrated commercial
city, and he pauses here to describe the ancient wonders of
his metropolis. In his recital, at once religious and profane,
he invokes by turns the evidence of Isaiah and Virgil; after
speaking of King Hyram and the tomb of Origen, he does
nor disdain to celebrate the memory of Cadmus and the
country of Dido. The good archbishop particularly vaunts
the industry and the commerce of Tyre, the fertility of its
territory, its dyes, so celebrated in all antiquity; its sand,
which changed itself into transparent vases, and its sugar-canes,
which began to be sought for by all regions of the
universe. The city of Tyre, in the time of Baldwin, was no
longer that sumptuous city, whose rich merchants, according
106

to Isaiah, were princes; but it was still considered as the
best-peopled and most commercial of the cities of Syria. It
stood upon a delightful shore, screened by mountains from
the blasts of the north; it had two large moles, which, like
long arms, advanced into the sea, to inclose a port to which
storm or tempest could find no access. The city of Tyre,
which had stood out during more than seven months against
the victorious Alexander, was defended on one side by a
stormy sea and steep rocks, and on the other by a triple
wall, surmounted by high towers.

The doge of Venice at once penetrated into the port, and
closed up all issue or access on the side of the sea. The
patriarch of Jerusalem, and Pontius, count of Tripoli, regent
of the kingdom, commanded the land army; the king, Baldwin
du Bourg, being at that time a captive to the Saracens. In the
early days of the siege, the Christians and the Mussulmans
fought with obstinate ardour, but with equal success; the
disunion of the infidels, however, soon powerfully assisted
the efforts of the Franks. The caliph of Egypt had yielded
half of the place to the sultan of Damascus, in order to
engage him to defend it against the Christians. The Turks
and the Egyptians were divided amongst themselves, and
refused to fight together; the Pranks took advantage of
these divisions, and daily gained a superiority. After a
siege of a few months, the walls crumbled away before the
machines of the Christians; provisions began to be short in
the place; the Mussulmans were about to capitulate, when
discord in turn disunited the Christians, and was on the
point of rendering useless the prodigies of valour and all the
labours of a long siege.

The land army loudly complained that it had to support
alone both battles and fatigues; the horse and foot threatened
to remain as motionless under their tents as the
Venetians in their ships. To remove the cause of their
complaints, the doge of Venice came into the Christian
camp with his sailors, armed with their oars, and declared
himself ready to mount to the breach. From that time a
generous emulation inflamed the zeal and the courage of
both soldiers and seamen; and the Mussulmans, being
without hope of succour, were obliged to succumb, after a
siege of five months and a half. The standards of the king
107

of Jerusalem and the doge of Venice floated together over
the walls of Tyre; the Christians made their triumphal
entrance into the city; whilst the inhabitants, according to
the terms of the capitulation, with their wives and children,
departed from it. On whichever side our sympathies may
be, the end of a great siege is a melancholy object of contemplation;
nothing can convey a sadder idea to the mind
than this compulsory exodus of a people.

The day on which the news of the conquest of Tyre was
received at Jerusalem, was a festival for the inhabitants of
the Holy City.
Te Deum
and hymns of thanks were
chanted, amidst the ringing of bells and the shouts of the
people; flags were flying over the towers and ramparts of
the city; branches of the olive and wreaths of flowers were
hung about the streets and public places; rich stuffs ornamented
the outsides of houses and the doors of churches.
The old talked about the former splendour of the kingdom
of Judah, and the young virgins repeated in chorus the
psalms in which the prophets had celebrated the city of
Tyre.

The doge of Venice, on returning to the Holy City, was
saluted by the acclamations of the people and the clergy.
The barons and magnates did all in their power to detain
him in Palestine; they even went so far as to offer him
Baldwinâs crown, some believing that that prince was dead,
and others acknowledging no king but at the head of an
army and on the field of battle. The doge declined the
crown, and, satisfied with the title of prince of Jerusalem,
led back his victorious fleet to Italy.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.D. 1188.

Tyre is most conspicuously associated with great names;
next to having had the glory of checking the career of
Alexander for seven months, it may reckon that of having
successfully resisted the greatest Saracen general that,
perhaps, ever lived.

Whilst a new crusade was being earnestly preached in
Europe, Saladin was following up the course of his victories
in Palestine. The battle of Tiberias and the capture of
Jerusalem had spread so great a terror, that the inhabitants
108

of the Holy Land were persuaded the army of the Saracens
could not be resisted. Amidst general consternation, a
single city, that of Tyre, defied all the united forces of the
East. Saladin had twice gathered together his fleets and
his armies to attack a place of which he so ardently desired
the conquest. But all the inhabitants had sworn rather to
die than surrender to the Mussulmans; which generous
determination was the work of Conrad, who had just arrived
in that place, and whom Heaven seemed to have sent to
save it.

Conrad, son of the marquis of Montferrat, bore a name
celebrated in the West, and the fame of his exploits had
preceded him into Asia. In his early youth he had distinguished
himself in the war of the Holy See against the
emperor of Germany. A passion for glory and a thirst for
adventures afterwards led him to Constantinople, where he
quelled a sedition which threatened the imperial throne,
and, with his own hand, killed the leader of the rebels on
the field of battle. The sister of Izaac Angelus and the
title of CÃ¦sar were the rewards of his courage and his
services; but his restless character would not allow him to
enjoy his good fortune in quiet. Amidst peaceful grandeur,
roused all at once by the fame of the holy war, he stole
away from the tenderness of a bride and the gratitude of
an emperor, to fly into Palestine. Conrad landed on the
shores of PhÅnicia a few days after the battle of Tiberias.
Before his arrival, the city of Tyre had named deputies to
demand a capitulation of Saladin; his presence revived the
general courage, and changed the aspect of affairs. He
caused himself to be appointed commander of the city, he
widened the ditches, repaired the fortifications; and the
inhabitants of Tyre, attacked by sea and land, become all at
once invincible warriors, learnt, under his orders, how to
repel the fleets and armies of the Saracens.

The old marquis of Montferrat, the father of Conrad, who,
for the sake of visiting the Holy Land, had left his peaceful
states, was at the battle of Tiberias. Made prisoner by the
Mussulmans, he awaited, in the prisons of Damascus, the
time when his children would deliver him or purchase his
liberty.

Saladin sent for him to his army, and promised the brave
109

Conrad to restore his father to him, and give him rich possessions
in Syria, if he would open the gates of Tyre. He
at the same time threatened to place the old marquis de
Montferrat in the front of the ranks of the Saracens, and
expose him to the arrows of the besieged. Conrad replied
with haughtiness, that he despised the presents of infidels,
and that the life of his father was less dear to him than
the cause of the Christians. He added that nothing should
impede his endeavours, and that if the Saracens were barbarous
enough to put to death an old man who had surrendered
on his parole of honour, he should think it a glory to
be descended from a martyr. After this reply the Saracens
recommenced their assaults, and the Tyrians defended themselves
with firmness and courage. The Hospitallers, the
Templars, and most of the bravest warriors left in Palestine,
hastened within the walls of Tyre, to share in the honour of
so great a defence. Among the Franks who distinguished
themselves by their valour, was a Spanish gentleman, known
in history by the name of â
The Green Knight
,â from the
colour of his armour. He alone, say the old chroniclers,
repulsed and dispersed whole battalions; he fought several
single combats, overthrowing the most intrepid of the Mussulmans,
and made the Saracens wonder at and admire his
bravery and skill in arms.

There was not a citizen in the place who would not fight;
the children, even, were so many soldiers; the women animated
the men by their presence and by their words. Upon
the waters, at the foot of the ramparts, fresh combats were
continually taking place. In all parts the Saracens met
with the same Christian heroes who had so often made them
tremble.

Despairing of taking the city of Tyre, Saladin resolved to
raise the siege, in order to attack Tripoli, and was not more
fortunate in that expedition. William, king of Sicily, being
informed of the misfortunes of Palestine, had sent succours
to the Christians. The great Admiral Margarit, whose
talents and victories had obtained for him the name of the
King of the Sea and the New Neptune, arrived on the
coast of Syria with sixty galleys, three hundred horse and
five hundred foot-soldiers. The Sicilian warriors flew to
the defence of Tripoli, and, led on by the Green Knight, who
110

had so distinguished himself at Tyre, forced Saladin to
abandon his enterprise.

Thus was Saladin foiled; but the fate of Tyre was only
deferred: towards the end of the Crusades, which European
passions and interests had made abortive, the Sultan Chalil,
after taking and destroying PtolemaÃ¯s, sent one of his emirs
with a body of troops to take possession of Tyre; and that
city, seized with terror, opened its gates without resistance.
The conquerors likewise possessed themselves of Berytus,
Sidon, and all the other Christian cities along the coast.
These cities, which had not afforded the least succour to
PtolemaÃ¯s in the last great struggle, and which believed
themselves protected by a truce, beheld their population
massacred, dispersed, or led into slavery; the fury of the
Mussulmans extended even to the stones; they seemed to
wish to destroy the very earth which the Christians had
trod upon; their houses, their temples, the monuments of
their piety, their valour, their industry,âeverything was
condemned to perish with them by the sword or by fire.

Such was the character of the wars miscalled Holy; and
the impartial student of history is forced to confess, that in all
that degrades humanity, such as cruelty, cupidity, ambition,
and false glory, the Crusaders at least kept pace with the
Mahometans; in bad faith, with regard to treaties, truces,
and pledged honour, the Christians by far exceeded the
Mussulmans.

SARDIS.

A.C. 502.

After
the battle of Thymbra between Cyrus and CrÅsus,
which was one of the most considerable events in antiquity,
as it passed the empire of Asia from the Assyrians of Babylon
to the Persians, Cyrus, the conqueror, marched directly
upon Sardis, the capital of Lydia. According to Herodotus,
CrÅsus did not believe that Cyrus meant to shut him up in
the city, and therefore marched out to give him battle. He
says the Lydians were the bravest people in Asia. Their
principal strength consisted in their cavalry; and Cyrus, in
order to render this force ineffective, caused his camels to
advance against the horse; and the latter animals, having an
instinctive dread or dislike for the former, would not face
them. The horsemen dismounted and fought on foot; after
an obstinate contest, the Lydians were forced to retreat into
their capital city, Sardis, which Cyrus immediately besieged,
causing his engines to be brought up and his scaling-ladders
to be prepared, as if he meant to take it by assault. But
this was a feint; he had been made acquainted with a private
way into the city by a Persian slave, who had formerly
been in the service of the governor, and at night he quietly
made himself master of the citadel. At break of day, he
entered the city without resistance. Perceiving that the
Chaldeans quitted their ranks and began to disperse themselves,
his first care was to prevent the city from being
plundered. To effect this required nothing less than the
perfect ascendancy which Cyrus had obtained over his
troops. He informed the citizens that the lives of themselves
and their children, with the honour of their women,
were perfectly safe, provided they brought him all their gold
and silver. This condition they readily complied with, and
CrÅsus, the proverbially richest man in the world, was
one of the first to lay his wealth at the foot of the conqueror.

112

The siege of Sardis has nothing remarkable in it, except
the change of empires which followed it; but there are
several anecdotes connected with it, which our young readers
would not forgive us for omitting.

When Cyrus had given all proper directions concerning
the city, he had a private conversation with the king, of
whom he asked what he now thought of the oracle of Delphi,
and of the god who presided over it, whom CrÅsus held in
great veneration. CrÅsus acknowledged that he had justly
incurred the indignation of that god, by having shown a
distrust of the truth of his answers, and by having put him
to the trial by an absurd and ridiculous question; and he
then added, that he had still no reason to complain of him,
for that, having consulted him that he might know what
to do in order to lead a happy life, the oracle had given
him as answer, that he should enjoy a perfect and lasting
happiness when he had come to the knowledge of himself.
âFor want of this knowledge,â said he, âand believing myself,
through the excessive praises bestowed upon me, to be something
very different from what I am, I accepted the title of
generalissimo of the whole army, and unadvisedly engaged
in war against a prince infinitely my superior in all respects.
But now that I am instructed by my defeat, and begin to
know myself, I believe that I am going to be happy; and if
you prove favourable to me,âand my fate is in your hands,âI
shall certainly be so.â Cyrus, touched with compassion at
the misfortunes of the king, who was fallen in a moment
from so great an elevation, and admiring his equanimity
under such a reverse of fortune, treated him with a great
deal of clemency and kindness, suffering him to enjoy both
the title and authority of king, under the restriction of not
having the power to make war; which was, as CrÅsus said,
relieving him of the great burden of royalty, and leaving
him the power of leading a happy life. Thenceforward Cyrus
took him with him upon all his expeditions, either out of
esteem for him, and to have the benefit of his counsels, or
out of policy, and to be more secure of his person. We
consider this to have been a sad realization of poor CrÅsusâs
dream of happiness.

There are other wonders connected with this event, about
which we can only say that great historians have related
113

them. For our own parts, we are not so sceptical regarding
the remote events of history as some readers and
authors are. We see, constantly, matters that must some
day belong to history, put in as false a light by the
passions and interests of contemporaries, as if they were
viewed through the mist of past ages. Again, that which
is wonderful is not necessarily untrue. When Marco Paolo
returned from his long pilgrimage, his accounts were all
received as fables; now, almost all of them prove to be
bare truth. We shall never reject a story told by a respectable
historian, on account of its being a little miraculous,
provided it be amusing, instructive, and elevating, and at
the same time a thing with which well-educated youth
ought to be acquainted.

The only son CrÅsus had living was dumb. This young
prince, seeing a soldier about to cut down the king, whom
he did not know, with his scimitar, made such a violent
effort to save his fatherâs life, that he broke the string which
had confined his tongue, and cried out,ââSoldier! spare the
life of CrÅsus!â

The account of Cyrusâs conversation, given above, is from
Xenophonâs CyropÃ¦dia; the following, which greatly differs
from the circumstances attending it, is from Herodotus.âHow
are we to choose? The CyropÃ¦dia is by some writers
looked upon as little more than a romance; and Herodotus
abounds in apocryphal stories.

CrÅsus being a prisoner, was condemned by the conqueror
to be burnt alive. Accordingly, the funeral pile was
prepared, and the unhappy prince, having been laid thereon,
and on the point of execution, recollecting the conversation
he had formerly had with Solon, was wofully convinced of
the truth of that philosopherâs admonition, and in remembrance
thereof, cried out three times,ââSolon! Solon!
Solon!â Cyrus, who with his court was present, was
curious to know why CrÅsus pronounced the name of that
philosopher with so much vehemence in his extremity.
âMighty king,â replied CrÅsus, âwhen Solon in search of
wisdom visited my court, I tried every means to dazzle him,
and impress upon him the immense extent of my wealth.
When I had displayed it all before him, I asked which man
in all his travels he had found the most truly happy, expecting,
114

after what he had seen, he would name me. But he
replied, âOne Tellus, a citizen of Athens, a very honest and
good man, who, after having lived all his days without indigence,
having always seen his country in a flourishing
condition, has left children who are universally esteemed,
has had the satisfaction of seeing those childrenâs children,
and at last died gloriously in fighting for his country.â I
was surprised to find that my gold and silver had so little
weight; but, supposing I at least might claim the next rank,
I asked him, âWho of all he had seen was most happy after
Tellus?â Solon replied,ââCleobis and Biton, two brothers,
of Argos, who had left behind them a perfect pattern of
fraternal affection, and of the respect due from children to
parents. Upon a solemn festival, when their mother, a
priestess of Juno, was to go to the temple, the oxen that
were to have drawn her not being ready, the two sons put
themselves into the yoke and drew their motherâs chariot
thither, a distance of five miles. The mothers of the place,
ravished with admiration, congratulated the priestess upon
having such sons. She, in the transports of her joy and
thankfulness, earnestly entreated the goddess to reward her
children with the best thing Heaven can bestow. Her
prayers were heard. When the sacrifice was over, her two
sons fell asleep in the temple, and there died in a soft and
sweet slumber. In honour of their piety, the people of
Argos consecrated statues to them in the temple of Delphi.â
âWhat then,â said I, in a tone of discontent, âyou do not
reckon me amongst the happy at all?â Solon replied,
calmly: âKing of Lydia, the gods have given us Grecians a
spirit of moderation and reserve, which has produced amongst
us a plain, popular kind of philosophy, accompanied with a
certain generous freedom, void of pride or ostentation, and
therefore not well suited to the courts of kings. This philosophy,
considering what an infinite number of vicissitudes
and accidents the life of man is liable to, does not allow us
to glory either in any prosperity we enjoy ourselves, or to
admire happiness in others, which perhaps may prove only
transient or superficial. The life of man seldom exceeds
seventy years, which make up in all six thousand two hundred
and fifty days, of which no two are exactly alike; so
that the time to come is nothing but a series of various
115

accidents which cannot be foreseen. Therefore, in our
opinion, no man can be esteemed happy but he whose happiness
the gods continue to the end of his life; as for others,
who are perpetually exposed to a thousand dangers, we account
their happiness as uncertain as the crown is to a
person engaged in battle who has not yet won the victory.ââ

Upon hearing this, Cyrus reflected upon the uncertainty
of sublunary things, and was touched with compassion for
the princeâs misfortunes. He caused him to be taken from
the pile, and treated him as long as he lived with kindness
and respect. Thus had Solon the honour of saving the life
of one king, and of giving a wholesome lesson of instruction
to another.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 502.

Under the reign of Darius Ochus, the Athenians, seduced
by the persuasions of Aristagoras, embarked in an ill-fated
expedition against the city of Sardis. We say ill-fated,
although they burnt the city, with the exception of the
citadel, because this unprovoked attack was the source of all
the subsequent wars between Greece and Persia, which
produced so many calamities to both countries. The city
being principally built of reeds, was soon fired, and as
quickly destroyed; but the citadel proved impregnable.
The Lydians and Persians, highly exasperated, drove the
Athenians and Ionians back to Ephesus, and destroyed
many of their ships. Darius being informed of the burning
of Sardis, and of the part the Athenians had taken in the
affair, resolved from that time to make war upon Greece;
and, that he might never forget this resolution, he commanded
one of his officers to cry out to him with a loud
voice, every night, when he was at supper: âSire, remember
the Athenians!â In the burning of Sardis, a temple of
Cybele, the peculiar goddess of that country, was consumed,
which was the reason the Persians, in their invasions of
Greece, destroyed every sacred edifice that fell in their
power.

116

BABYLON.

A.C. 538.

Cyrus
stayed in Asia Minor till he had entirely subdued
all the nations that inhabited it, from the Ãgean sea to the
river Euphrates. Thence he proceeded to Syria and Arabia,
which he also subjected. After which he entered Assyria,
and advanced towards Babylon, the only city of the East
that stood out against him.

The siege of this important place was no easy enterprise.
The walls of it were of a prodigious height, and appeared to
be inaccessible, without mentioning the immense number of
people within them for its defence. The city was said to
be stored with sufficient provisions for twenty years. But
Cyrus was not a leader to be discouraged by difficulties.
Despairing of taking the city by assault, he made the Babylonians
believe that he meant to reduce it by famine. To
this end, he caused a line of circumvallation to be drawn
quite round the city, with a wide and deep ditch, and, that
his troops might not be over-fatigued, he divided his army
into twelve bodies, and assigned each of them its month for
guarding the trenches. The besieged, thinking themselves
free from all danger on account of their fortifications and
magazines, insulted Cyrus from the top of their walls, and
laughed at all his attempts, and all the trouble he gave himself,
as so much unprofitable labour.

As soon as the ditch was completed, he began to think
seriously of his vast design, which he had communicated to
nobody. Providence soon furnished him with as fit an
opportunity for this purpose as he could desire. He was
informed that a great festival was to be celebrated in the
city, and that the Babylonians, on account of that solemnity,
would pass the whole night in drinking and debauchery.

Belshazzar, the king, took more interest in this public rejoicing
than any other person, and gave a magnificent entertainment
117

to the chief officers of the kingdom and the ladies
of the court. When flushed with wine, he ordered the gold
and silver vessels which had been taken from the temple of
Jerusalem to be brought out; and as an insult to the God
of Israel, he, his whole court, and all his concubines, drank
out of these sacred vessels. God, who was displeased at
such insolence and impiety, at the instant made him sensible
whom it was he offended, by a sudden apparition of a hand,
writing certain characters upon the wall. The king, terribly
surprised and frightened at this vision, immediately sent for
all the wise men, diviners and astrologers, that they might
read the writing to him, and explain the meaning of it. But
they all came in vain, not one of them being able to expound
the characters. The obvious reason of this was that the
characters were in the Hebrew or Samaritan language, which
the Babylonians did not understand. The queen-mother
Nitocris, a princess of great merit, coming, upon hearing of
this prodigy, into the banqueting-room, endeavoured to
compose the mind of the king her son, advising him to send
for Daniel, with whose abilities in such matters she was
well acquainted, and whom she had employed in the government
of the state.

Daniel was therefore immediately sent for, and spoke to
the king with the freedom and liberty becoming a prophet.
He put him in mind of the dreadful manner in which God
had punished the pride of his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar,
and the flagrant abuse he made of his power, when he acknowledged
no law but his own will, and thought himself empowered
to exalt and to abase, to inflict destruction and
death, wheresoever he would, only because such was his
will and pleasure. âAnd thou his son,â said he to the
king, âhast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest
all this, but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of
heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house
before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy
concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised
the gods of silver and of gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone,
which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose
hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou
not glorified. Then was the part of the hand sent from
him, and this writing was written. And this is the writing
118

that was written:
Mene, Tekel, Upharsin
. This is the
interpretation of the thing:
Mene
, God hath numbered thy
kingdom, and finished it;
Tekel
, thou art weighed in the
balances, and art found wanting;
Peres
, thy kingdom is
divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.â This interpretation
might be expected to increase the consternation
of the company; but they found means to dispel their fears,
probably from a persuasion that the calamity was not
denounced as present or immediate, and that time might
furnish them with expedients to avert it. This, however,
is certain, that for fear of disturbing the general joy of the
present festival, they put off the discussion of serious matters
to another time, and sat down again to their banquet, and
continued their revellings to a very late hour.

Cyrus, however, well informed of the confusion that was
generally occasioned by this festival, both in the palace and
the city, had posted a part of his troops on that side where
the river entered into the city, and another part on that side
where it went out; and had commanded them to enter the
city that very night, by marching along the channel of the
river as soon as ever they found it fordable. Having given
all necessary orders, and exhorted his officers to follow him,
by representing to them that he marched under the guidance
of the gods, in the evening he made them open the great
receptacles or ditches, on both sides of the city, above and
below, that the water of the river might run into them. By
this means, that part of the Euphrates was, for a time,
emptied; and its channel became nearly dry. Then the two
bodies of troops, according to their orders, went into the
channel, the one commanded by Gobryas, and the other by
Gudatas, and advanced without meeting any obstacle. The
invisible guide, who had promised to open all the gates to
Cyrus, made the general negligence and disorder of that
riotous night subservient to his design, by leaving open the
gates of brass which were made to shut up the descents from
the quays to the river, and which alone, if they had not been
left open, were sufficient to defeat the whole enterprise.
Thus did these two bodies of troops penetrate into the very
heart of the city without any opposition, and meeting together
at the royal palace, according to their agreement, surprised
the guards, and cut them to pieces. Some of the
119

company that were within the palace opening the doors to
ascertain the cause of the noise they heard without, the
soldiers rushed in, and quickly made themselves masters of
it. Meeting the king, who came towards them sword in
hand, at the head of those that were in the way to succour
him, they killed him, and put all that attended him to
death. The first thing the conqueror did was to thank the
gods for having at last punished that impious king. These
words are Xenophonâs, and are very worthy of attention, as
they so perfectly agree with what the Scriptures have
recorded of the impious Belshazzar.

The taking of Babylon put an end to the Babylonian
empire, after a duration of two hundred and ten years, from
the beginning of the reign of Nabonassur. Thus was the
power of that proud city brought low just fifty years after
she had destroyed the city of Jerusalem and her temple.
And herein were accomplished those predictions which the
prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel had denounced
against her. There is still one more, the most important
and the most incredible of them all, and yet the Scripture
has set it down in the strongest terms, and marked it out
with the greatest exactness; a prediction literally fulfilled
in all its points: the proof still actually subsists, is the most
easy to be verified, and indeed of a nature not to be contested.
What
4
I mean is the prediction of so total and absolute a
ruin of Babylon, that not the least remains or traces should
be left of it.

In the first place, Babylon ceased to be a royal city, the
kings of Persia choosing to reside elsewhere. They delighted
more in Susa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, or any other place, and
did themselves destroy a great part of Babylon. We are
informed by Strabo and Pliny, that the Macedonians, who
succeeded the Persians, did not only neglect it, and forbear
to embellish it, or even repair it, but that, moreover, they
built Seleucia in the neighbourhood, on purpose to draw
away its inhabitants, and cause it to be deserted. Nothing
can better explain what the prophet had foretold: âIt shall
not be inhabited.â Its own masters endeavour to make it
desolate. The new kings of Persia, who afterwards became
120

masters of Babylon, completed the ruin of it by building
Ctesiphon, which carried away all the remainder of the inhabitants;
so that from the time the curse was pronounced
against that city, it seems as if those very persons who
ought to have protected it had become its enemies.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 510.

So much connection is generally placed between some of
the prophetic writings of the Bible and the destruction of
the city of Babylon, that we have deemed it necessary to
quote in the preceding siege considerably from an established
historian on that point. But we must remember that the
Scriptures, though intended for the blessing of mankind,
are Hebrew books, and that the Jews of the time of the
Prophets principally adduced, could not be expected to speak
otherwise than they have done against their masters the
Babylonians. That the ruin of this great city was not so
sudden or so complete is proved by its being able to sustain
the siege of which we are about to speak.

Babylon endured with great impatience the yoke of the
Persians, and made a strong effort to break its chains, in the
reign of Darius, son of Hystaspes. After four years of
secret necessary preparation, the Babylonians raised the
standard of revolt and provisioned their city. In order to
economize their food, they adopted the barbarous precaution
of exterminating all useless mouths; they strangled both
the women and the children, only permitting the citizens to
preserve such of their wives as they were most attached to,
and a single maid-servant. From the height of their walls,
the besieged, proud of the strength of their ramparts and
their murderous magazines, insulted the Persians in the
most opprobrious manner. During eighteen months, every
art of war, with the valour of a warlike nation, were vainly
employed against the revolted city. Darius was beginning
to despair of success, when Zopyrus, one of the greatest
nobles of Persia, presented himself before him, covered with
blood, and with his nose and ears cut off. âWho has treated
you thus?â exclaimed the king. âYourself, my lord,â
replied Zopyrus, âand my desire to serve you.â He then
explained his design to him, and the plan he had formed to
121

deliver up Babylon to him. Filled with surprise and admiration,
Darius gave him liberty to pursue his own course,
with a promise to second him. Zopyrus proceeded towards
the city, and, on gaining the walls, entreated refuge for one
of the victims of the cruelty of Darius, exhibited his wounds,
and solicited permission to avenge himself upon an enemy
with whose designs he was fully acquainted. His blood and
his wounds removed all suspicion; the citizens confided in his
word, his courage, and what he termed his misfortunes, and
they put him in command of as many troops as he demanded.
In the first sortie, he and his band killed a thousand Persians;
some days after, two thousand; a third, four thousand
strewed the field of battle. Babylon resounded with the
praises of Zopyrus; he was termed the preserver of the city.
He was made generalissimo of the troops, and the guarding
of the walls was intrusted to him. At the time agreed
upon, Darius drew close to Babylon; the faithful Zopyrus
opened its gates to his master, and placed in his hands a
city which he might never have obtained by famine or force.
The king loaded Zopyrus with honours, and gave him, for
life, the revenue of the city his stratagem had been the
means of subduing. When contemplating the physical deficiencies
his devotion had created, the grateful monarch was
accustomed to say he would rather miss the taking of ten
Babylons than permit so faithful a servant to mutilate
himself in that manner. In order to prevent similar revolts,
great part of the walls were destroyed, and the hundred
gates were removed.

Of the importance Babylon retained nearly two hundred
years after the above event, we may judge by the splendour
of Alexanderâs triumphal entrance into that city. Babylon
was given up to the Macedonian conqueror immediately
after the battle of Arbela, without the trouble of drawing
a sword. The reputation of his victories gained him many
such bloodless conquests. As it is not a siege, it does not
come within our plan to relate more concerning the surrender
of this city; but we are sure our younger readers will excuse
our departure from our course, to describe the above-named
triumph.

Alexander entered the city at the head of his whole
army, as if he had been marching to a battle. The walls of
122

Babylon were lined with people, notwithstanding the greatest
part of the citizens were gone out to meet him, from the
impatience they had to see their new sovereign, whose
renown had outstripped his march. Bazophanes, governor
of the fortress and guardian of the treasures, strewed the
streets with flowers, and raised on both sides of the way
silver altars, which smoked not only with frankincense, but
the most fragrant perfumes of every kind. Last of all came
the presents which were to be made to the king; consisting
of herds of cattle, a great many horses, with lions and
panthers in iron cages. After these the Magi walked,
singing hymns in the manner of their country; then the
Chaldeans, accompanied by Babylonian soothsayers and
musicians; the latter being accustomed to sing the praises
of their kings to their instruments, and the Chaldeans to
observe the motions of the planets and the vicissitudes of
the seasons. The rear was brought up by the Babylonish
cavalry, of which both men and horses were so sumptuous
that imagination can scarcely conceive their magnificence.
The king commanded the people to walk after his infantry,
whilst he, surrounded by his guards, and seated on a
chariot, entered the city, and rode to the palace in a kind
of triumph. The next day he took a view of all Dariusâs
money and moveables, and divided the immense wealth he
found, with a liberal hand, amongst his army; both leaders
and the meanest foot-soldiers shared in the rich prize, which
only made them the more anxious to follow their great
captain to new conquests.

Of the nearly fatal effects of the luxury of Babylon upon
Alexander and his army it is not our province to speak.

123

CORIOLI.

A.C. 493.

Although
we cannot undertake to notice every siege of
the cities of Italy which assisted the regular but rapid rise
of the Roman power, we shall make it a point not to pass
by such as have any interesting association attached to them;
and what English youth, with a Shakespeare in his fatherâs
library, is not familiar with Coriolanus in Corioli?

The Volscians tormented the Romans by continual attacks.
In order to punish them, the siege of Corioli was resolved
upon. It was one of their strongest places. In a sortie,
the besiegers repulsed the Romans, and drove them back to
their own camp. Furious at such a defeat, Marcius, a young
patrician, with a handful of brave companions, returned to
the charge, made the Volscians give way in their turn, penetrated
with them into the city, and gave it up to pillage.
That was the age when military talents were sure of their
reward. After the taking of the city, the consul Cominius,
before the whole army, ordered Caius Marcius to take a
tenth of the booty, before any division was made of the rest,
besides presenting him with a fine horse and noble trappings
as a reward for his valour. The army expressed their approval
of this by their acclamations; but Marcius, stepping
forward, said, âThat he accepted of the horse, and was
happy in the consulâs approbation; but as for the rest, he
considered it rather as a pecuniary reward than as a mark
of honour, and therefore desired to be excused receiving it,
as he was quite satisfied with his proper share of the booty.
One favour only in particular I desire,â continued he, âand
I beg I may be indulged in it. I have a friend among the
Volscians, bound with me in the sacred rites of hospitality,
who is a man of virtue and honour. He is now among the
prisoners, and from easy and opulent circumstances is reduced
to servitude. Of the many misfortunes under which
124

he labours, I should be glad to rescue him from one, which
is that of being sold for a slave.â His request, of course, was
granted, and his friend was liberated. Here we cannot
refrain from noting an error in one whom it is our pride to
think almost faultless. Whilst giving one of the most faithful
delineations of an historical character in Coriolanus that
ever was exhibited on a stage, Shakespeare makes him say,
when asked for the name of the friend he wished to
serve,â

âBy Jupiter, forgot.â

I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.â

Have we no wine here?â

Now, this is not Coriolanus, nor consistent with the hero,
who did not forget gratitude in the hour of triumph: he who
remembered the friend would not have forgotten his name so
lightly. We have seen John Kemble, as he pitched his
shield to his armourer, produce great effect by this little
speech; but stage effect is a poor compensation for the violation
of truth of character.

VEII.

A.C. 371.

The
Veientes were the most powerful of the twelve
peoples who inhabited Etruria. Their capital, Veii, situated
on a steep rock, was only twelve miles from Rome; and the
inhabitants were, for more than three hundred and fifty
years, the most persevering enemies of the growing republic.

The Romans, tired of seeing their projects constantly
thwarted by the Veientes, declared war against them, after
a truce of twenty years; and in order the better to carry
out that great design, resolved to lay siege to their capital.
Situated upon a steep rock, abundantly provided with everything,
famine alone could reduce it. The task was a long
one, but it did not terrify the Romans. It became necessary
to defend the soldier from the rigours of winter, and tents
125

made of skins were erected, which proved as good as houses
to them. This being an innovation, the tribunes of the
people opposed it strongly, but a check soon silenced their
vain clamours. The Veientes, in a sortie, took the besiegers
by surprise, burnt their machines, and destroyed most of
their works. All orders of the Romans swore not to leave
the camp till the city was taken. The horsemen, whom the
republic was bound to supply with horses, offered to find
them at their own expense. The senate, only anxious for
the glory and interest of the state, charmed with this unanimous
zeal, assigned for the first time a pay to the horsemen,
and to all the volunteers who would repair to the siege.
The works were quickly re-established, with the addition of
much more considerable new ones. Rome was beginning to
look for the most favourable results, when the hatred of the
military tribunes, L. Virginius and M. Sergius, who commanded
the army, almost annihilated their hopes. The
Capenates and the Falerii, neighbours of the Veientes,
armed secretly, and surprised and attacked the camp of the
Romans. The two tribunes carried their quarrel so far as
to separate and divide the army into two parts. Whilst in
this state, the enemy fell upon Sergius. The besieged, in
concert with them, made a sortie and attacked him on their
side. The astonished Romans fought feebly, and soon
sought safety in flight. All were in disorder, and the rout
became general. Virginius might have saved his colleague,
but he preferred enjoying the spectacle of his defeat. The
exasperated senate obliged them both to abdicate their commands;
they were brought to trial, and very heavily fined
for so great a crime. The Falerii returned to the charge,
but they were repulsed with great loss. In the mean time,
the siege did not advance, and the efforts of the Roman
armies terminated in ravaging the lands of their enemies.
The following year, the war was still more unsuccessful.
Under vain pretences of religion, the military tribunes, with
whom the Romans were dissatisfied, were deposed, and a
dictator was chosen, as was the custom on all the pressing
emergencies of the republic. M. Furius Camillus, whose
rare valour and high capacity had been displayed more than
once in command, was raised to this supreme dignity. The
presence of this great man soon restored the military discipline,
126

which had been weakened by the disunion of the
leaders, and brought good fortune back to the standards of
Rome. The city was pressed more closely, and the forts
which the besieged had destroyed were reconstructed.
Camillus defeated the Falerii and the Capenates, and after
that victory, he pushed on the attack with additional ardour.
At length, despairing of succeeding by force, he had recourse
to sapping and mining. His soldiers, by dint of hard labour,
opened for themselves a subterraneous passage into the
castle; thence, dispersing themselves about the city, whilst
the general amused the besieged by an assault, some charged
those who defended the walls, whilst others broke down the
gates, and let the army into the place in crowds. The terrified
citizens knew not which way to fly; all issues were
occupied by their enemies. Some were crushed beneath the
ruins of the houses, others were consumed by the flames;
the image of death was everywhere. The furious soldiery
immolated all that came in their way; nothing was heard
but cries and lamentations. The dictator put an end to the
carnage, and disarmed the prisoners, but in accordance with
his promise, gave the city up to the pillage of his victorious
troops. The republic received the news of this victory with
transports of the liveliest joy, and all orders of the state vied
with each other in doing honour to the triumph of Camillus.âAnd
yet they afterwards banished him.

SIEGE OF VEII.

FALERII.

A.C. 394.

The
Romans and the Falerii were at war. Camillus
being named dictator, attacked these people and besieged
their capital. Before the circumvallation of the place was
completed, a schoolmaster came out of the city and placed
all his pupils in the hands of the Romans, as the readiest
means of inducing the inhabitants to surrender. The indignant
dictator ordered the perfidious master to be stripped,
had his hands tied behind him, and, arming the boys with
127

rods, commanded them to flog the treacherous pedagogue
back to the city. Plutarch says that Camillus was much
shocked at this action of the schoolmaster, and said to those
around them,ââWar at best is a savage thing, and wades
through a sea of violence and injustice; yet even war itself
has its laws, which men of honour will not depart from; nor
do they pursue victory so as to avail themselves of acts of
villany and baseness. A great general should rely upon
his own virtue, and not upon the treachery of others.â

It is said that the magistrates of the place were so affected
by the magnanimity of the dictator, that they brought him
the keys of the city.

PLATÃÃ.

A.C. 431.

When
we compare the intestine wars of the Greeks with
the sweeping conquests of the East, we are struck with the
vast disproportion in the numbers of combatants engaged,
and we are brought to the conviction that acts of heroism,
devotedness, and patriotism seem more common and more
brilliant where men are but few, than when they are in great
masses. The siege of PlatÃ¦Ã¦ was carried on on both sides
by such a small number of combatants, that the issue might
be supposed to have but very little interest; and yet, what
a charm there is about everything that relates to Greece!
Its feuds are the most important wars in history; its warriors
and statesmen the most renowned in the universe,
although the territories in question would not equal in
revenue those of great English nobles or millionnaires, and
the men in fact were not above influential burgesses.

The Peloponnesian war began by the Thebans attacking
PlatÃ¦Ã¦, a city of BÅotia, in alliance with the Athenians.
Some traitors opened the gates to them. The citizens of
PlatÃ¦Ã¦, attacking them in the night, killed them all, with the
exception of two hundred whom they made prisoners. The
Athenians being informed of what had taken place at
PlatÃ¦Ã¦, immediately sent thither both men and provisions.
Two or three years after, the LacedÃ¦monians laid siege to
128

PlatÃ¦Ã¦, under the command of Archidamus, their king. He
began by inclosing the city within a circumvallation formed
of great trees, the branches of which were intertwined; then
he erected a platform or cavalier to arrange his batteries on,
in the hope of soon carrying the place, on account of the
small number of the besieged. They were but four hundred,
but all determined to die rather than submit to the law of a
conqueror. When the PlatÃ¦ans saw the enormous lines
begin to rise, they built up a wall of wood upon the top of
the walls of the city opposite the platform, in order to maintain
a superiority over the besiegers. The crevices in this
wall were filled up with wood and bricks taken from the
demolition of the neighbouring houses; then they mined the
platform. The LacedÃ¦monians, perceiving this, abandoned
that project, and contented themselves with constructing
another rampart in the form of a crescent, to serve as a
retreat when the first wall should be forced, and to oblige
the enemy to undertake a second labour. The besiegers
having set up their machines, gave a violent shock to the
fortifications. The PlatÃ¦ans used every exertion to weaken
the effect of these batteries: they broke the stroke of the
ram with cords, which turned aside the blow by seizing the
ram by the head and throwing it up by main strength. They
made use, likewise, of another artifice,âfastening by the
two ends a huge beam with long iron chains which were
fixed to two large pieces of wood, which extended on one
side and were supported upon the wall; when the machine
began to play, they raised this beam, and letting it fall
crosswise upon the point of the ram, it broke its force
and rendered it harmless. At length the LacedÃ¦monians,
astonished at such a resistance, despaired of forcing the
place, and, after having vainly attempted to set fire to it,
they converted the siege into a blockade, and surrounded
the city with a wall of brick, covered both within and without
by a deep ditch, and strengthened at regular distances
with high and well-defended towers. During the winter,
the besieged, seeing no hopes of succour and being short of
provisions, formed the resolution of cutting their way
through the enemyâs troops; but half of them, confounded at
the extent of the peril, lost courage at the moment of
undertaking it. The rest, amounting to two hundred and
129

eighty soldiers, persisted in their design, and had the good
fortune to succeed. These intrepid warriors commenced by
ascertaining the height of the walls by counting the rows of
bricks, which was done at several times and by various persons,
to avoid mistake; they then made their ladders in
proportion. All precautionary measures being taken, the
besieged chose a dark, stormy, and rainy night for their
attempt. After having passed the first ditch, they drew
near the walls without being discovered. They marched at
a short distance from each other, to avoid the clashing of
their arms, which were very light, in order to allow them to
be more active; and they only wore one shoe, to prevent
their slipping in the mud. A great number of them succeeded
in mounting the wall, armed only with a cuirass and
dagger, but as they were advancing toward the towers, a tile
which one of them accidentally threw down, betrayed them.
A loud cry was immediately given from the tops of the
towers, and the whole camp rushed towards the walls,
ignorant, from the darkness of the night, of what could be
the matter. Those who remained in the city gave an alarm
in another direction, to create a diversion; so that the enemy,
in doubt, knew not which way to take. They, however,
lighted torches on the side towards Thebes, to show that the
danger was in that direction. The inhabitants, to render this
signal useless, lighted others at the same time in various
places. The PlatÃ¦ans who were upon the walls got possession
of the two towers, defended the approach to them with
arrows and darts, and thus favoured the passage of their
companions. They descended the last, and hastened to the
ditch, to pass as the others had done. At this moment, a
body of three hundred men came out to meet them. The
bold fugitives contrived to elude them, and even killed
several: they all reached Athens in safety, with the exception
of one archer, who was taken at the side of the ditch.
Those who were left in the city defended themselves for a
considerable time with courage; but at length, after having
endured all the evils of a long siege, exhausted rather than
vanquished, they surrendered at discretion. They were
slaughtered without pity, and their wives were reduced to
slavery. The following year, the city was completely razed
to the ground.

BYBLOS.

A.C. 454.

We
should have passed by this siege as unimportant, had
we not been struck by the great disproportion of the parties
engaged, and consequently, by the fact of the superiority of
a few brave well-disciplined troops over an unmanageable
multitude.

Inarus, a prince of Libya, favoured by the Athenians,
proclaimed himself king of Egypt, at the time that country
was under the subjection of Artaxerxes Longimanus, king
of Persia. Irritated at the revolt, Artaxerxes sent three
hundred thousand men to quell it. He gave the command
of this army to Megabyzus. Inarus could not resist such
an inundation, and he at once abandoned Egypt and shut himself
up, with a few of his countrymen and six thousand
Athenians, in Byblos, a city of the isle of Prosopitis. This
city, surrounded by the waters of the Nile, was constantly
revictualled by the Athenians, and for a year and a half the
Persians made useless efforts to gain possession of it. Tired
of such protracted labours, the Persians formed the plan of
turning, by numerous cuttings, the arm of the Nile in which
the Athenian fleet lay. They succeeded; and Inarus, terrified
at the probable consequences, surrendered upon composition;
but the bold bearing of the Athenians, their
admirable discipline, and the order of their battalions, made
the host of Persians afraid to attack them. They were
offered an honourable capitulation; they accepted it, gave
up Byblos, and returned to Greece, proud of having been
thought invincible by a multitude of barbarians.

131

ATHENS.

A.C. 480.

During
the invasion of Xerxes, all the Grecian cities in
his passage were subdued or felt the disastrous effects of his
vengeance. The Athenians, too proud to submit, and too
weak to defend themselves alone by land, sent to consult
the oracle at Delphi. The god replied: â
It is only within
walls of wood the city will find safety
.â Themistocles persuaded
the people that Apollo ordered them to instantly
quit their city, and embark on board a good fleet, after having
provided places of security for their wives and children. In
consequence of this advice, they embarked, after having sent
their aged, their women, and their children, to Trozene, in the
Peloponnesus. We cannot imagine a more affecting spectacle
than the departure of this fleet; the unfortunate inhabitants
kept their eyes, bathed in tears, fixed upon their
abandoned homes till distance or darkness rendered them
invisible. The very animals shared the common grief,
running along the shore, and seeming to call back their
masters by their cries. It is said that a dog belonging to
Xantippus, the father of Pericles, threw himself into the sea,
and swam by the side of his vessel till it reached Salamis,
where it sunk exhausted upon the beach and died. This
imaginative people erected a monument to this faithful dog,
called âThe Grave of the Dog.â In the mean time, the
Persian army entered Athens, forced the citadel, defended
to the last by a small number of self-devoted men, and
reduced the superb city to ashes.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 404.

After the battle of PlatÃ¦Ã¦, the citizens of Athens returned
to their country, and built a superb city upon the ruins of
the ancient one. By recovering its splendour, it attracted
132

the jealousy of its rival Sparta, the capital of LacedÃ¦monia.
This was the commencement of the famous Peloponnesian
war. In the twenty-ninth year of this war, Lysander, having
conquered the Athenians at Ãgospotamos, marched directly
against Athens. Though without vessels, without provisions,
without hope, the Athenians defended themselves for eight
months, and then surrendered, conquered alone by famine.
The Spartans disgraced themselves by destroying the walls
of the first city of Greece to the sound of musical instruments;
and they established a government of thirty
tyrants, in order to subdue the spirit of the unfortunate
inhabitants.

This servitude did not last long; Athens was delivered
from the yoke of the Thirty, by means of five hundred soldiers,
raised by a simple Syracusan orator, named Lysias, out of
veneration for the common country of eloquence. The
expulsion of the thirty tyrants took place the same year that
the kings were expelled from Rome.

After being opposed strongly to Philip, and submissive to
Alexander, Athens was taken successively by his successors,
Antipater, Demetrius, and Antigonus; its wealth being a
rich bait for these captains, whose vanity was continually
wounded by the haughtiness of the city, which gave rise to
aggressions often but little merited.

THIRD SIEGE, A.C. 87.

Archelaus, a general of Mithridates, king of Pontus,
entered Athens by means of a sophist named Aristion, to
whom he gave the principal authority of the place. The
Athenians claimed the assistance of the Romans, and Sylla
took the matter upon his own hands.

Upon Syllaâs arrival in Greece, all the cities opened their
gates to him, with the exception of Athens, which, subject
to Aristion, was obliged unwillingly to oppose him. When
the Roman general entered Attica, he divided his forces into
two bodies, the one of which he sent to besiege Aristion, in
the city of Athens, and with the other he marched in person
to the port PirÃ¦us, which was a kind of second city, where
Archelaus had shut himself up, relying upon the strength
of the place, the walls being sixty feet high, and all of hewn
133

stone. This had been the work of Pericles, during the
Peloponnesian war.

The height of the walls did not amaze Sylla. He employed
all kinds of engines in battering them, and made continual
assaults. If he would have waited a little, he might have
taken the higher city without striking a blow, for it was
reduced to the last extremity by famine; but being in haste
to return to Rome, where he apprehended changes might
happen in his absence, he spared neither danger, attacks,
nor expense, to hasten the conclusion of this war. Without
enumerating the rest of the warlike stores and equipage,
twenty thousand mules were perpetually employed in working
the machines alone. Wood falling short, from the great
consumption of it in the machines, which were constantly
being broken, in consequence of the vast weight they carried,
or burnt by the enemy, he did not spare the sacred groves.
He cut down the beautiful avenues of the Academy and the
LycÃ¦um, and caused the high walls which joined the port
to the city to be demolished, for the sake of the ruins, which
were useful to him in the works he was carrying on.
Having occasion for a great deal of money, both for the
expenses of the war, and as a stimulus to the soldiers, he had
recourse to the hitherto inviolable treasures of the temples,
and caused the finest and most precious gifts, consecrated
at Epidamus and Olympia, to be brought thence. He wrote
to the Amphyctions, assembled at Delphi, âThat they
would act wisely in sending him the treasures of the god,
because they would be more secure in his hands; and that if
he should be obliged to make use of them, he would return
the value after the war.â At the same time he sent one of
his friends, named Caphis, a native of Phocis, to Delphi, to
receive all those treasures by weight. When Caphis arrived
at Delphi, he was afraid, through reverence for the god, to
meddle with the consecrated gifts, and bewailed with tears,
in the presence of the Amphyctions, the necessity imposed
upon him. Upon which some person there having said that
he heard the sound of Apolloâs lyre from the interior of the
sanctuary, Caphis, whether he really believed it or not, was
willing to take advantage of the circumstance to impress
Sylla with a religious awe, and wrote him an account of it.
Sylla, deriding his simplicity, replied, âThat he was surprised
134

he should not comprehend that singing was a sign of
joy, and by no means of anger and resentment; and, therefore,
he had nothing to do but to take the treasures boldly,
and be assured that the god saw him do so with pleasure,
and gave them to him himself.â Plutarch, on this occasion,
notices the difference between the ancient Roman generals
and those of the times we now speak of. The former,
whom merit alone had raised to office, and who had no other
views from their employments but the public good, knew
how to make the soldiers respect and obey them, without
descending to use low and unworthy methods for that purpose.
They commanded troops that were steady, disciplined,
and well enured to execute the orders of their generals,
without reply or delay. Truly kings, says Plutarch, in the
grandeur and nobility of their sentiments, but simple and
modest private persons in their train and equipage, they
put the state to no other expense, in the discharge of their
offices, than was reasonable and necessary, conceiving it
more shameful in a captain to flatter his soldiers than to
fear his enemies. Things were much changed in the time
we now speak of. The Roman generals, abandoned to insatiable
ambition and luxury, were obliged to make themselves
slaves to their soldiers, and to buy their services by gifts
proportioned to their avidity, and often by the toleration
and impunity of the greatest crimes.

Sylla was exceedingly anxious about this siege, and was,
as we have said, in great want of money. He was desirous
of depriving Mithridates of the only city he held in Greece,
which might almost be considered as a key to Asia, whither
the Romans were eager to follow the king of Pontus. If he
returned to Rome without achieving this conquest, he
would find Marius and his faction more formidable than ever.
He was besides sensibly galled by the keen raillery which
Aristion vented every day against him and his wife Metella.

It is difficult to say whether the attack or defence was
conducted with the most vigour; for both sides behaved
with incredible courage and firmness. The sallies were
frequent, and were, in character, almost battles, in which the
slaughter was great, and the loss generally not unequal.
The besieged were supported by several seasonable reinforcements
by sea.

135

What did them most damage was the secret treachery of
two Athenian slaves, who were in the PirÃ¦us. These slaves,
whether out of affection for the Roman interest, or desirous
of providing for their own safety in case the place were taken,
wrote upon leaden balls all that was going forward within,
and threw them from slings to the Romans; so that, how
prudent soever were the measures adopted by Archelaus,
none of them succeeded. He resolved to make a general
sally; the traitor slung a leaden ball, inscribed, âTo-morrow,
at such an hour, the fort will attack your works, and the
horse your camp.â Sylla laid ambushes, and repulsed the
besieged with loss. A convoy of provisions, sadly wanted,
was to be thrown into the city by night; upon advice,
conveyed in the same way, the provisions were intercepted.

Notwithstanding all these disappointments, the Athenians
defended themselves bravely. They found means either to
burn most of the machines erected against their walls, or,
by undermining them, to throw them down, and break them
to pieces. The Romans, on their side, behaved with no less
vigour. By means of mines, they made a way to the bottom
of the walls, under which they hollowed the ground; and
having propped the foundation with beams of wood, they
afterwards set fire to the props, with a great quantity of
pitch, sulphur, and tar. When these beams were burnt,
part of the wall fell down with a horrible noise, and a large
breach was opened, through which the Romans advanced to
the assault. This battle was contested with great obstinacy,
but at length the Romans were obliged to retire.

The next day they renewed the attack. The besieged
had built a fresh wall during the night, in the form of a
crescent, in the place of that which had been destroyed, and
the Romans found it impossible to force it.

Sylla, discouraged by so obstinate a defence, resolved to
make no more assaults, but to take the place by famine.
The city, on the other hand, was at the last extremity. A
bushel of barley had been sold for a thousand drachmas
(about Â£25 sterling). The inhabitants did not only eat the
grass and roots which they found about the citadel, but the
flesh of horses, and the leather of their shoes, which they
boiled soft. In the midst of the public misery, the tyrant
passed his days and nights in revelling. The senators and
136

priests went to throw themselves at his feet, imploring him
to have pity on the city, and to obtain a capitulation from
Sylla; he had them dispersed with a shower of arrows, and
in that brutal manner drove them from his presence.

He did not demand a cessation of arms, or send a deputation
to Sylla, till reduced to the last extremity. As those
deputies made no proposals, and asked nothing of him to
the purpose, but ran on in praise of Theseus, Eumelpus,
and the exploits of the Athenians against the Medes, Sylla
was annoyed by their discourse, and interrupted them by
saying:ââGentlemen orators, you may go back, and keep
your rhetorical flourishes for yourselves; for my part, I was
not sent to Athens to be made acquainted with your ancient
prowess, but to chastise your modern revolt.â

During this audience, some spies having entered the city
by chance, overheard some old men talking in the Ceramicus,
and blaming the tyrant exceedingly for not guarding
a part of the wall, which was the only place where the
enemy might easily take the city by escalade. At their
return to the camp, they related what they had heard to
Sylla. The parley had been to no purpose. Sylla did not
neglect the intelligence given him. The next night he went
in person to take a view of the place, and finding the wall
actually accessible, he ordered ladders to be raised against
it, began the attack there, and having made himself master
of the walls, after a weak resistance, he entered the city.
He would not suffer it to be set on fire, but abandoned it
to be plundered by the soldiers, who in several houses
found human flesh, which had been dressed to be eaten. A
dreadful slaughter ensued. The following day all the slaves
were sold by auction, and liberty was granted to the citizens
who had escaped the swords of the soldiers, but their
numbers were but few. Sylla at once besieged the citadel,
where Aristion, and those who had taken refuge there, were
soon so much reduced by famine that they were forced to
surrender. The tyrant, his guards, and all who had been in
any office under him, were put to death. Some few days
after, Sylla made himself master of the PirÃ¦us, and burnt
all its fortifications, especially the arsenal, which had been
built by Philo, the celebrated architect, and was a wonderful
fabric. Archelaus, by means of his fleet, had retired to
137

Munichia, another port of Attica. To do this commander
justice, he deserved to have conquered, for he had failed in
neither courage nor skilful exertions during the siege.
With his own hand he set fire to one of the Roman galleries,
and destroyed all the machines upon it. On another
occasion, his soldiers being repulsed, took to flight, and he
in vain endeavoured to rally them. He was soon left so
completely alone, that he had to be drawn up the wall by
ropes. His bravery formed a strong contrast with the
cowardice and infamous debaucheries of Aristion.

Sylla restored the Athenians their liberty, but not that
consideration generally the companion of power. During
several ages Athens was still considered the common country
of tasteful knowledge; people went thither for the purpose
of instructing themselves in the arts of thinking and speaking
correctly. By degrees her talents were extinguished,
and her renown was eclipsed. Succumbing by turn to all
the barbarians who invaded the Roman empire, she changed
masters as often as she saw enemies at her gates. The Turks
destroyed what were left of her splendid edifices. Twice
the Venetians paid the honours of a siege to Setine, built
upon its ruins. After so much destruction and so many
sieges, the traveller can scarcely discover the ruins of Athens
upon the soil where formerly stood that celebrated city.

138

SYRACUSE.

A.C. 414.

Syracuse
was the most flourishing republic of Sicily.
That powerful, rich, and populous city, situated on the
eastern coast of the island, consisted of five quarters,
inclosed within strong walls, and fortified with towers;
they formed so many places, and presented nearly the figure
of a triangle. Towards the sea, the island of Ortygia contained
the citadel, and commanded the two ports: it communicated
by a bridge with Achradina, the handsomest
and the best fortified of all the quarters. Above Achradina
was the quarter of Tyche, and that of Neapolis, separated
one from the other by a wall, which, advancing in a point
towards the west, terminated at a height named EpipolÃ¦.
A vast belt of walls inclosed all these quarters: this wall
was defended by two forts,âEuryalus and Labdalon.

In the sixteenth year of the Peloponnesian war, the
Segestians, oppressed by the Selenartians, came to implore
the assistance of Athens. Never had that republic been so
powerful. In accordance with the advice of Alcibiades, the
people lent a favourable ear to the prayers of the deputies.
They equipped a fleet of a hundred and fifty ships, and gave
the command of it to Alcibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus.
They set sail for Syracuse, entered the principal port during
the night, and landed near Olympia without being perceived.
The Syracusans, full of confidence and courage,
had resolved to defend themselves to the last. The unexpected
appearance of the enemy disconcerted them a little,
but they soon threw off this first terror, and drew up in
battle array beneath their walls. The signal being given,
and each party equally in earnest, the conflict was long and
obstinate. A storm intimidated the Syracusans; they gave
way, and retired into the city, after a spirited resistance.
This check seemed only to reanimate their ardour. They
139

repaired and augmented the fortifications, and confided the
whole military authority to Hermocrates, a man equally
illustrious by his valour and his experience.

The Athenians obtained possession of EpipolÃ¦, in spite of
the frequent sorties of the besieged, and surrounded the
city with a wall of circumvallation. Nicias, by the recall of
Alcibiades and the death of Lamachus, who was killed in an
action, found himself without colleagues, and sole master of
all the operations. Casting aside his habitual tardiness, he
brought his fleet into both the ports, and pressed the
siege on with energy by sea and land. Syracuse, thus
blockaded, was reduced to the last extremity. The
despairing citizens were already thinking of surrendering,
when Gylippus, a LacedÃ¦monian captain, sent to their
relief with a good body of troops, made his appearance.
Hope was again revived, and, in anticipation, they proclaimed
the Spartan the father and liberator of Syracuse.
This general did not disappoint the expectations of his
allies. He sent word to the Athenians that he allowed
them five days to evacuate Sicily. Nicias did not condescend
to make any reply to such a message, but some of
his soldiers asked the herald whether the appearance of a
LacedÃ¦monian cloak and a miserable stick could change the
fortunes of armies. Preparations for battle were made on
both sides. Port Labdalon was carried by assault, and all
the Athenians who defended it were put to the sword.
Every day some skirmish or more serious action occurred,
in which Gylippus had always the advantage. Nicias was
forced to go into cantonments towards Plemmyrium, in
order to protect his baggage and to support his fleet.
The LacedÃ¦monians attacked and carried his forts, and
took possession of his baggage, at the same time that the
Syracusans obtained a serious advantage over his fleet.
Nicias was in a state of perfect consternation; he had informed
the Athenians of the miserable state of his army
since the landing of the Spartans, and they had promised
him succours, but they did not arrive, and his situation
became alarming. He was on the point of succumbing to
his fate, when an Athenian fleet of seventy-three galleys,
commanded by Demosthenes, sailed proudly into port. This
general immediately planned and attempted some attacks,
140

but his temerity cost him dear. He lost a great number of
soldiers, and quickly destroyed all the hopes his arrival had
created; the Athenians were reduced to greater extremities
than ever, and they resolved to raise the siege after risking
another naval engagement. Victory still was favourable to
the besieged, who deprived their enemies of the means of
flight even, by blockading their ships in the greater port.
They then turned their thoughts to escape by land; but
Hermocrates, being informed of their intention, barred every
passage: the unfortunate fugitives, having set out on their
march in the night-time, fell into ambuscades laid for them
in all directions. They defended themselves in a manner
worthy of their name, but, overpowered by numbers, fatigue,
and hunger, they were forced to surrender at discretion.
They were thrown into the public prisons.

The Syracusan people were brutally elated with victory,
and sullied their triumph by the cruelty exercised upon the
two Athenian leaders, Nicias and Demosthenes. They were
sentenced to be flogged with rods, and then to be executed.
The wiser and more prudent Syracusans exceedingly disapproved
of this severity, and Hermocrates, the general whose
prudence, skill, and valour had brought about the happy
issue of the contest, remonstrated strongly with the people;
but they were too much excited to listen to him, and would
not allow him even to finish his speech. And here we meet
with one of those incidents which, removed from common
occurrence, render the histories of the two great nations of
antiquity so delightful. Just as the noisy crowd silenced
their victorious general, an ancient Syracusan, venerable for
his great age and his respected character, who in the siege
had lost two sons, the only heirs of his name and estate,
was borne by his servants to the tribunal, and by his appearance
at once procured a profound silence. âYou here behold,â
said he, âan unfortunate father, who has felt, more
than any other Syracusan, the fatal effects of this war by
the death of two sons, who formed all the consolation and
were the only support of my old age. I cannot, indeed,
forbear admiring their courage, and rejoicing at their felicity,
in sacrificing to their countryâs welfare a life of which they
would one day have been deprived by the common course of
nature; but then I cannot but be strongly affected by the
141

wound which their death has made in my heart, nor forbear
hating and detesting the Athenians, the authors of this
unhappy war, as the murderers of my children. But, however,
I cannot conceal one circumstance, which is, that I am
less sensible to my private affliction than to the honour of
my country; and I see it ready to expose itself to eternal
infamy by the barbarous advice which is now given you.
The Athenians, indeed, merit the worst treatment, and every
kind of punishment that can be inflicted on them, for so
unjustly declaring war against us; but have not the gods,
the just avengers of crimes, punished them and avenged us
sufficiently? When their generals laid down their arms
and surrendered, did they not do this in the confidence of
having their lives spared? And if we put them to death,
will it be possible for us to avoid the just reproach of having
violated the laws of nations, and dishonoured our triumph
by the most barbarous cruelty? What! will you suffer
your glory to be thus sullied in the face of the whole world,
and have it said that a nation who first dedicated a temple
in their city to Clemency, found not any in yours? Surely
victories and triumphs do not give immortal glory to a city;
but the exercising of mercy towards a vanquished enemy,
the using of moderation in the greatest prosperity, and,
fearing to offend the gods by a haughty and insolent pride.
You, doubtless, have not forgotten that this Nicias, whose
fate you are going to pronounce, was the very man who
pleaded your cause in the assembly of the Athenians, and
employed all his credit and the whole power of his eloquence
to dissuade his country from embarking in this war. Should
you, therefore, pronounce sentence of death upon this worthy
general, would it be a just reward for the zeal he showed for
your interest? With regard to myself, death would be less
grievous to me than the sight of so horrid an injustice committed
by my countrymen and fellow-citizens.â

The people seemed moved to compassion by this speech,
especially as when the venerable old man first ascended the
tribunal, they expected to hear him cry aloud for vengeance
on those who had brought his calamities upon him, instead
of suing for their pardon. But the enemies of the Athenians
having expatiated with vehemence upon the unheard-of
cruelties which their republic had exercised upon several
142

cities belonging to their enemies, and even to their ancient
allies; the inveteracy which their commanders had shown
against Syracuse, and the evils they would have subjected it
to had they been victorious; the afflictions and groans of
numberless Syracusans who bewailed the death of their
children and near relations, whose names could be appeased
no other way than by the blood of their murderers: on these
representations, the people returned to their sanguinary
resolution. Gylippus used his utmost endeavours, but in
vain, to have Nicias and Demosthenes delivered up to him,
especially as he had taken them, in order to carry them to
LacedÃ¦mon. But his demand was rejected with haughty
scorn, and the two generals were put to death. Shameful
cruelties were likewise inflicted upon the meaner prisoners.

Such was the issue of this improvident war, set on foot by
the influence of the restless ambitious Alcibiades. It lasted
two years; and Athens had been led to form great hopes
from the result of it. There are few characters young
readers are more likely to be led astray in than that of
Alcibiades. The instances of his spirit, generosity, personal
beauty, and above all, his love for his master Socrates,
make more impression upon plastic minds, than what is told
of almost any other person in history. But, if he had
shining qualities, he was deficient in all that were solid,
virtuous, and serviceable to the state. He availed himself
of his popularity to carry out his ambition; his apparent
generosity was selfishness disguised; his courage was always
ill-directed; and, whether we consider such a man as a
public character or a private citizen, our young readers may
depend upon it, it is one of the most dangerous.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 400.

Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, having declared war
against the Carthaginians, obtained several victories over
them. But this tyrant was soon punished by the siege
which Himilco, the Carthaginian general, laid to Syracuse,
with a fleet of two hundred vessels, and an army of a hundred
thousand foot and three thousand horse. Dionysius was
not in a condition to stop the torrent which threatened him
with destruction; but pestilence served him more effectually
143

than any number of troops could have done: this army and
its generals faded away beneath the awful scourge, as it were
instantaneously. The tyrant, taking advantage of the
miserable state to which disease had reduced the Carthaginians,
attacked them with spirit, defeated them without
trouble, took or burnt most of their vessels, and made a vast
booty.

THIRD SIEGE, A.C. 212.

In the year 212 before Christ, the Syracusans, excited by
seditious magistrates, declared war against Rome, breaking
the treaties entered into by Hiero II. and the great republic.
The consul Marcellus, being in Sicily, advanced
towards Syracuse. When near the city, he sent deputies to
inform the inhabitants that he came to restore liberty to
Syracuse, and not to make war upon it; but he was refused
admission to the city. Hippocrates and Epicydes went out
to meet him, and having heard his proposals, replied
haughtily, that if the Romans intended to besiege their city,
they should soon learn the difference between Syracuse and
Leontium. Marcellus then determined to besiege the place,âby
land on the side of Hexapylum, and by sea on that of
the AchradinÃ¦, the walls of which were washed by the waves.
He gave Appius the command of the land forces, and reserved
that of the fleet for himself. The fleet consisted of
sixty galleys of five benches of oars, filled with soldiers,
armed with bows, slings, and darts, to scour the walls.
There were a great number of other vessels, laden with all
sorts of machines usually employed in the sieges of fortified
places. The Romans, carrying on their attacks at two
different places, the Syracusans were at first in great consternation,
apprehensive that nothing could oppose so terrible
a power and such mighty efforts. And it had, indeed,
been impossible to resist them, but for the assistance of one
single man, whose wonderful genius was everything to the
Syracusans: this was Archimedes. He had taken care to
supply the walls with all things necessary for a good defence.
As soon as his machines began to play on the land side, they
discharged upon the infantry all sorts of darts, with stones
of enormous weight, which flew with so much noise, force,
and rapidity, that nothing could withstand their shock.
144

They beat down and dashed to pieces all before them, and
occasioned terrible disorder in the ranks of the besiegers.
Marcellus succeeded no better on the side of the sea:
Archimedes had disposed his machines in such a manner as
to throw darts to any distance. Though the enemy lay far
from the city, he reached them by means of his larger and
more formidable balistÃ¦ and catapultÃ¦. When these overshot
their mark, he had smaller, proportioned to the distance,
which put the Romans into such confusion as almost paralyzed
their efforts. This was not the greatest danger.
Archimedes had placed lofty and strong machines behind
the walls, which suddenly letting fall vast beams with an
immense weight at the end of them upon a ship, sunk it
to the bottom. Besides this, he caused an iron grapple to
be let out by a chain, and having caught hold of the head of
a ship with this hook, by means of a weight let down within
the walls, it was lifted up, set upon the stern, and held
so for some time; then, by letting go the chain, either by a
wheel or a pulley, it was let fall again with its whole weight
either on its head or its side, and thus sunk. At other times,
the machines, dragging the ship towards the shore, by
cordage and hooks, after having made it whirl about a great
while, dashed it to pieces against the points of the rocks
which projected under the walls. Galleys, frequently seized
and suspended in the air, were whirled about with rapidity,
exhibiting a dreadful sight to the spectators, after which,
they were let fall into the sea, and sunk to the bottom with
their crews.

Marcellus had prepared, at great expense, machines called

sambucÃ¦
, from their resemblance to a musical instrument of
that name. He appointed eight galleys of five benches for
that purpose, from which the oars were removed, half on the
right side and half on the left; these were joined together
two-and-two on the sides without oars. This machine consisted
of a ladder of the breadth of four feet, which, when
erect, was of equal height with the walls. It was laid at
length upon the sides of the two galleys joined together,
and extended considerably beyond their beaks: upon the
masts of these vessels were affixed pulleys and cords. When
set to work, the cords were made fast to the extremity of
the machine, and men upon the stern drew it up by pulleys;
145

others at the head assisting in raising it with levers. The
galleys afterwards being brought forward to the foot of the
walls, the machines were applied to them. The bridge of
the
sambuca
was then let down, no doubt after the manner
of a drawbridge, upon which the besiegers passed to the
walls of the place besieged. This machine had not the
expected effect. Whilst it was at a considerable distance
from the walls, Archimedes discharged a vast stone upon it,
weighing ten quintals,
5
then a second, and immediately
after a third, all of which, striking against it with dreadful
force and noise, beat down and broke its supports, and gave
the galleys upon which it stood such a shock, that they
parted from each other. Marcellus, almost discouraged and
at a loss what to do, retired as fast as possible with his galleys,
and sent orders to the land forces to do the same. He
called also a council of war, in which it was resolved, the
next day before dawn, to endeavour to approach close to the
walls. They were in hopes, by this means, to shelter themselves
from the machines, which, for want of a distance proportioned
to their force, would be rendered ineffectual. But
Archimedes had provided against all contingencies. He had
prepared machines long before, that carried to all distances
a proportionate number of darts and ends of beams, which
being very short, required less time for preparing them, and
in consequence, were more frequently discharged. He had
besides made small chasms or loopholes in the walls, at
little distances, where he had placed scorpions,
6
which, not
carrying far, wounded those who approached, without being
perceived but by their effect. When the Romans had gained
the foot of the walls, and thought themselves very well
covered, they found they were exposed to an infinite number
of darts, or overwhelmed with stones, which fell directly
upon their heads, there being no part of the wall which did
not continually pour that mortal hail upon them. This
obliged them to retire. But they were no sooner removed
to some distance, than a new discharge of darts overtook
them in their retreat, so that they lost great numbers of
146

men, and almost all their galleys were disabled or beaten to
pieces, without being able to revenge their loss upon their
enemies, for Archimedes had placed most of his machines in
security behind the walls; so that the Romans, says Plutarch,
repulsed by an infinity of wounds, without seeing the
place or hand from which they came, seemed to fight in
reality against the gods.

Marcellus, though at a loss what to do, and not knowing
how to oppose the machines of Archimedes, could not forbear,
however, jesting upon them. âShall we persist,â said
he, to his workmen and engineers, âin making war with
this Briareus of a geometrician, who treats my galleys and
sambucÃ¦ so rudely? He infinitely exceeds the fabled giants
with their hundred hands, in his perpetual and surprising
discharge upon us.â Marcellus had reason for complaining
of Archimedes alone; for the Syracusans were really no
more than members of the engines and machines of that
great geometrician, who was himself the soul of all their
powers and operations. All other arms were unemployed;
for the city at that time made use of none, either offensive
or defensive, but those of Archimedes. Marcellus, at length
observing the Romans to be so much intimidated, that if
they saw upon the walls a small cord only or the least piece
of wood, they would immediately fly, crying out that Archimedes
was going to discharge some dreadful machine upon
them, renounced his hopes of being able to make a breach in
the walls, gave over his attacks, and turned the siege into a
blockade. The Romans perceived that they had no other
resource but to reduce the great number of people in the
city by famine, and that they must stop every supply, both
by sea and land. During the eight months in which they
besieged the city, there was no kind of stratagem they did
not invent, nor any act of valour they left untried, except,
indeed, the assault, which they never ventured to attempt
again. So much power has sometimes a single man, or a
single science, when rightly applied. Deprive Syracuse of
only one old man,âthe great strength of the Roman arms
must inevitably take the city: his sole presence checks and
disconcerts all their designs. We here see what cannot be
repeated too often,âhow much interest princes have in protecting
arts, favouring the learned, or encouraging science
147

by honourable distinctions and actual rewards, which never
ruin or impoverish a state. We say nothing in this place of
the birth or nobility of Archimedes; he was not indebted to
them for the happiness of his genius and profound knowledge;
we consider him only as a learned man, and an excellent
geometrician. What a loss would Syracuse have
sustained, if, to have saved a small expense and pension,
such a man had been abandoned to inaction and obscurity!
Hiero was careful not to act in this manner. He knew all
the value of our geometrician; and it is no vulgar merit in
a prince to understand that of other men. He paid it due
honour; he made it useful, and did not stay till occasion or
necessity obliged him to do so: it would then have been too
late. By a wise foresight, the true character of a great prince
and a great minister, in the very arms of peace he provided
all that was necessary for supporting a siege, and making
war with success, though at that time there was no appearance
of anything to be apprehended from the Romans, with
whom Syracuse was allied in the strictest friendship. Hence
were seen to arise in an instant, as out of the earth, an
incredible number of machines of every kind and size, the
very sight of which was sufficient to strike armies with
terror and confusion. There are amongst those machines
some of which we can scarcely conceive the effects, and the
reality of which we might be tempted to call in question, if
it were allowable to doubt the evidence of writers, such, for
instance, as Polybius, an almost contemporary author, who
treated of facts entirely recent, and such as were well known
to all the world. But how can we refuse to give credit to
the uniform consent of Greek and Roman historians, whether
friends or enemies, with regard to circumstances of
which whole armies were witnesses and experienced the
effects, and which had so great an influence on the events of
the war? What passed in this siege of Syracuse shows how
far the ancients had carried their genius and art in besieging
and in supporting sieges. Our artillery, which so perfectly
imitates thunder, has not more effect than the machines of
Archimedes had, if indeed it has so much. A burning
glass is spoken of, by the means of which Archimedes is said
to have burnt part of the Roman fleet. That must have
been an extraordinary invention; but, as no ancient author
148

mentions it, it is no doubt a modern tradition without
foundation. Burning-glasses were known to antiquity, but
not of that kind.
7

After Marcellus had resolved to confine himself to the
blockade of Syracuse, he left Appius before the place with
two-thirds of his army, advanced with the other into the
island, and brought over some cities to the Roman interest.
At the same time, Himilco, general of the Carthaginians,
arrived in Sicily with a great army, in hopes of reconquering
it, and expelling the Romans. Hippocrates left Syracuse
with ten thousand foot and five hundred horse to join him,
and carry on the war in concert against Marcellus; Epicydes
remained in the city, to command there during the
blockade. The fleets of the two states appeared at the same
time on the coasts of Sicily; but that of the Carthaginians,
seeing: itself weaker than the other, was afraid to venture a
battle, and soon sailed back to Carthage. Marcellus had
continued eight months before Syracuse with Appius, according
to Polybius, when the year of his consulship expired.

Marcellus employed a part of the second year of the siege
in several expeditions in Sicily. On his return from Agrigentum,
upon which he had made an ineffectual attempt, he
came up with the army of Hippocrates, which he defeated,
killing above eight thousand men. This advantage kept
those on their duty who had entertained thoughts of going
over to the Carthaginians. After this victory, he turned
his attention again towards Syracuse; and having sent off
Appius to Rome, who went thither to demand the consulship,
he put Q. Crispinus in his place.

In the beginning of the third campaign, Marcellus, almost
absolutely despairing of being able to take Syracuse by
force, because Archimedes continually opposed him with
invincible obstacles, or by famine, because the Carthaginian
fleet, which was returned more numerous than before, easily
threw in convoys, deliberated whether he should remain
before Syracuse, or direct his endeavours against Agrigentum.
But before he came to a final determination, he thought it
proper to try whether he could not make himself master of
Syracuse by some secret intelligence. There were many
149

Syracusans in his camp, who had taken refuge there in the
beginning of the troubles. A slave of one of these secretly
carried on an intrigue in which four score of the principal
persons were concerned, who came in companies to consult
with him in the camp, concealed in barks, under the nets of
fishermen. The conspiracy was on the point of taking effect,
when a person named Attalus, through resentment for not
having been admitted into it, discovered the whole to Epicydes,
who put all the conspirators to death.

This enterprise having thus miscarried, Marcellus found
himself in new difficulties. He was filled with grief and
shame at the idea of raising a siege which had consumed so
much time, and cost the republic so many men and ships.
An accident, however, supplied him with a resource, and
gave a new life to his hopes. Some Roman vessels had
taken one DÃ¦mippus, whom Epicydes had sent to negotiate
with Philip, king of Macedon. The Syracusans expressed
a great desire to ransom this man, and Marcellus was not
averse to it. A place near the port of Trozilus was fixed
upon for the conference regarding the amount. As the
deputies went thither several times, it came into the mind
of a Roman soldier who accompanied them to consider the
wall with great attention. After having counted the stones,
and examined the measure of each of them, upon a calculation
of the height of the wall, he found it to be much lower
than it was accounted, and concluded that with ladders of a
moderate length it might be easily scaled. Without loss of
time, he communicated this to Marcellus, who knew that
the general is not always the only shrewd man in an army,
and, taking his advice, assured himself, with his own eyes,
of the fact. Having caused ladders to be prepared, he took
the opportunity of a festival that the Syracusans celebrated
for three days in honour of Diana, during which the inhabitants
gave themselves up entirely to rejoicings and banquets.
At the time of night when he conceived they would be heavy
and sleepy after their debauch, he ordered a thousand chosen
troops to advance with their ladders towards the wall.
When the first had got to the top without disturbing the
watch, others followed, encouraged by the boldness and
success of their leaders. The Syracusans proved to be either
drunk or asleep, and the thousand soldiers soon scaled the
150

wall. Having thrown down the gate of the Hexapylum,
they took possession of the quarter of the city called EpipolÃ¦.
It then became no longer time to deceive but to
terrify the people. The Syracusans, awakened by the noise,
began to rouse themselves and prepare for action. Marcellus
ordered all his trumpets to be sounded at once, which
so alarmed them that the inhabitants took to flight, believing
every quarter of the city to be in the hands of the enemy.
The strongest and the best part, however, called Achradina,
was not yet taken, being separated by its walls from the rest
of the city. Marcellus, at daybreak, entered the new city
by the quarter called Tyche. Epicydes, having hastily
drawn up some troops, which he had in the isle adjoining
Achradina, marched against Marcellus; but finding him
stronger than he expected, after a slight skirmish, he fell
back, and shut himself up in Achradina. All the Roman
captains and officers crowded around Marcellus, to congratulate
him upon his success. As to himself, when he had,
from an eminence, considered the loftiness, beauty, and
extent of the city, he is said to have shed tears, and to have
deplored the unhappy condition it was about to experience.
He called to mind the two powerful Athenian fleets which
had formerly been sunk before this city, and the two
numerous armies cut to pieces with the illustrious generals
who commanded them: the many wars sustained with so
much valour against the Carthaginians; the many tyrants
and potent kings, Hiero particularly, whose memory was
still recent, who had signalized himself by so many royal
virtues, and, still more, by the important services he had
rendered the Roman people, whose interests had always
been as dear to him as his own. Moved by that reflection,
he deemed it incumbent upon him, before he attacked
Achradina, to send to the besieged to exhort them to surrender
voluntarily, and prevent the ruin of their city. His
remonstrances and exhortations had no effect.

To prevent being harassed in his rear, he first attacked a
fort called Euryclus, which lay at the bottom of the new
town, and commanded the whole country on the land side.
After having carried it, and placed therein a strong garrison,
he gave all his attention to Achradina. During these proceedings,
Hippocrates and Himilco arrived. The first, with
151

the Sicilians, having placed and fortified his camp near the
great harbour, and given the signal to those who were in
Achradina, attacked the old Roman camp, in which Crispinus
commanded; Epicydes at the same time made a sally upon
the posts of Marcellus. Neither of these enterprises was
successful. Hippocrates was vigorously repulsed by Crispinus,
who pursued him to his intrenchments, and Marcellus
obliged Epicydes to shut himself up in Achradina. Being
autumn, a plague incidental to the season killed a great
many of the inhabitants of the city, and was even more
destructive in the Roman and Carthaginian camps. The
distemper was not severe at first, but the communication
with the infected, and even the care taken of them, served
to spread the contagion. Death, and the spectacle of interment,
continually presented mournful objects to the eyes of
the living: nothing was heard, night or day, but groans and
lamentations. At length, the being accustomed to the evil
had hardened their hearts to such a degree, that they not
only ceased to grieve for the dead, but even neglected to
bury them. Nothing was to be seen but dead bodies, by
the eyes of those who hourly expected to be the same. The
Carthaginians suffered more than either the Romans or
Syracusans. Having no place to retire to, their generals,
Hippocrates and Himilco, both perished, with almost all
their troops. Marcellus, from the first breaking out of the
disease, brought his troops into the city, where the roofs and
shade were of great service to them; but, notwithstanding,
he lost no inconsiderable number of his men.

In the mean time, Bomilcar, who commanded the Carthaginian
fleet, and had made a second voyage to Carthage, to
bring a new supply, returned with a hundred and thirty
ships and seven hundred transports. He was prevented by
contrary winds from doubling the Cape of Pachynus. Epicydes,
who was afraid that if these winds continued, this
fleet might be discouraged, and return to Africa, left Achradina
to the care of the generals of the mercenary troops,
and went to Bomilcar, whom he persuaded to try the event
of a naval battle, as soon as the weather would permit.
Marcellus, seeing that the troops of the Sicilians increased
every day, and that if he stayed and suffered himself to be
shut up in Syracuse, he should be pressed by sea and land,
152

resolved, though not so strong in ships, to oppose the passage
of the Carthaginian fleet. As soon as the high winds abated,
Bomilcar stood out to sea, in order to double the cape;
but when he saw the Roman ships advancing in good order,
on a sudden, on what account is not known, he took to
flight, sent orders to the transports to return to Africa, and
sought refuge himself in Tarentum. Epicydes, completely
disappointed in his great hopes, and apprehensive of returning
into a city already half-taken, made all sail for Agrigentum,
rather with the design of awaiting the event of the
siege than of making any new attempt from that point.
When it became known in the camp of the Sicilians that
Epicydes had quitted Syracuse, and the Carthaginians Sicily,
they sent deputies to Marcellus, after having sounded the
disposition of the besieged, to treat upon the conditions on
which Syracuse should surrender. It was agreed with
unanimity enough on both sides, that what had appertained
to the kings should belong to the Romans, and that the
Sicilians should retain all the rest, with their laws and
liberty. After these preliminaries, they demanded a conference
with those to whom Epicydes had intrusted the
government in his absence. They told them they had been
sent by the army to Marcellus and the inhabitants of Syracuse,
in order that all the Sicilians, as well within as without
the city, might have the same fate, and that no separate
convention might be made. Having been permitted to enter
the city and confer with their friends and relations, after
having informed them of what they had already agreed with
Marcellus, and giving them assurances that their lives would
be safe, they persuaded them to begin by removing the
three governors Epicydes had left in his place, which was
immediately put in execution. After this, having assembled
the people, they represented that if the Romans had undertaken
the siege of Syracuse, it was out of affection, not
enmity, to the Syracusans; that it was not till after they
had been apprised of the oppression they suffered from Hippocrates
and Epicydes, those ambitious agents of Hannibal,
and afterwards of Hieronymus, that they had taken arms,
and begun the siege of the city, not to ruin it, but to destroy
its tyrants; that, as Hippocrates was dead, Epicydes no
longer in Syracuse, his lieutenants were slain, and the Carthaginians
153

dispossessed of Sicily, both by sea and land, what
reason could the Romans now have for not inclining as
much to preserve Syracuse, as if Hiero, the sole example of
fidelity towards them, were still alive? That neither the
city nor the inhabitants had anything to fear but from
themselves, if they let slip the occasion for renewing their
amity with the Romans; that they never had so favourable
an opportunity as the present, when they were just delivered
from the violent government of their tyrants; and that the
first use they ought to make of their liberty was to return
to their duty.

This discourse was perfectly well received by everybody. It
was, however, judged proper to create new magistrates before
the nomination of deputies; the latter of whom were chosen
from the former. The deputy who spoke in their name, and was
instructed solely to use the utmost endeavours that Syracuse
might not be destroyed, addressed himself to Marcellus, in
a long but sensible speech, laying the whole blame of the
war upon Hippocrates and Epicydes. âFor the rest,â said
he, still continuing to address Marcellus, âyour interest is
as much concerned as ours. The gods have granted you
the glory of having taken the finest and most illustrious
city possessed by the Greeks. All we have ever achieved
worthy of being recorded, either by sea or land, augments
and adorns your triumph. Fame is not a sufficiently
faithful chronicler to make known the greatness and
strength of the city you have taken; posterity can only
judge of these by its own eyes. It is necessary that we
should be able to show to all travellers, from whatever part
of the universe they come, sometimes the trophies we have
obtained from the Athenians and Carthaginians, and sometimes
those you have acquired from us; and that Syracuse,
thus placed for ever under the protection of Marcellus, may
be a lasting and an eternal monument of the valour and
clemency of him who took and preserved it. It is unjust
that the remembrance of Hieronymus should have more
weight with you than that of Hiero. The latter was much
longer your friend than the former your enemy. Permit
me to say, you have experienced the good effects of the
amity of Hiero, but the senseless enterprises of Hieronymus
have fallen solely upon his own head.â The difficulty was
154

not to obtain what they demanded from Marcellus, but to
preserve tranquillity and union amongst those in the city.
The deserters, convinced that they should be delivered up
to the Romans, inspired the foreign soldiers with the same
fear. Both the one and the other having, therefore, taken
arms whilst the deputies were still in the camp of Marcellus,
they began by cutting the throats of the newly-elected
magistrates, and, dispersing themselves on all sides, they
put to the sword all they met, and plundered whatever fell
in their way. That they might not be without leaders,
they appointed six officers; three to command in Achradina
and three in the Isle. The tumult being at length appeased,
the foreign troops were informed, from all hands, that it
was concluded with the Romans that their cause should be
entirely distinct from that of the deserters. At the same
instant, the deputies who had been sent to Marcellus
arrived, and fully undeceived them. Amongst those who
commanded in the Isle, there was a Spaniard, named
Mericus. Means were found to corrupt him: he gave up
the gate near the fountain Arethusa, to soldiers sent by
Marcellus in the night to take possession of it. At daybreak
the next morning, Marcellus made a false attack on
the Achradina, to draw all the forces of the citadel, and the
Isle adjoining to it, to that side, and to enable some vessels
he had prepared to throw troops into the Isle, which would
be unguarded. Everything succeeded according to his plan.
The soldiers whom those vessels had landed in the Isle,
finding almost all the posts abandoned, and the gates by
which the garrison of the citadel had marched out against
Marcellus still open, they took possession of them after a
slight encounter. Marcellus having received advice that he
was master of the Isle, and of part of Achradina, and that
Mericus, with the body under his command, had joined his
troops, ordered a retreat to be sounded, that the treasures
of the kings might not be plundered. These did not prove
so valuable as was expected.

The deserters having escaped,âa passage being purposely
left free for them,âthe Syracusans opened all the gates of
Achradina to Marcellus, and sent deputies to him with
instructions to demand nothing further from him than the
preservation of the lives of themselves and their children.
155

Marcellus having assembled his council and some Syracusans
who were in his camp, gave his answer to the
deputies in their presence: âThat Hiero, for fifty years,
had not done the Roman people more good than those who
had been masters of Syracuse some years past had intended
to do them harm; but that their ill-will had fallen upon
their own heads, and they had punished themselves for their
violation of treaties in a more severe manner than the
Romans could have desired; that he had besieged Syracuse
during three years, not that the Roman people might reduce
it into slavery, but to prevent the chiefs of the revolters
from continuing to hold it under oppression; that he had
undergone many fatigues and dangers in so long a siege,
but that he thought he had made himself ample amends by
the glory of having taken that city, and the satisfaction of
having saved it from the entire ruin it seemed to deserve.â
After having placed a body of troops to secure the treasury,
and safeguards in the houses of the Syracusans who had
withdrawn to the camp, he abandoned the city to be plundered.
It is reported that the riches that were pillaged in
Syracuse at this time exceeded all that could have been
expected at the taking of Carthage itself. An unhappy
accident interrupted the joy of Marcellus, and gave him a
very sensible affliction. Archimedes, at a time when all
things were in this confusion in Syracuse, shut up in his
closet like a man of another world, who has no interest in
what is passing in this, was intent upon the study of some
geometrical figure, and not only his eyes, but the whole
faculties of his soul, were so engaged in this contemplation,
that he had neither heard the tumult of the Romans, universally
busy in plundering, nor the report of the cityâs
being taken. A soldier suddenly came in upon him, and
bade him follow him to Marcellus. Archimedes desired
him to stay a minute till he had solved his problem, and
finished the demonstration of it. The soldier, who cared
for neither the problem nor the demonstration, and was vexed
at the delay, which, perhaps, kept him from plunder, drew
his sword and killed him. Marcellus was exceedingly
afflicted when he heard the news of his death. Not being
able to restore him to life, he paid all the honours in his
power to his memory. He made a diligent research after
156

all his relations, treated them with great distinction, and
granted them peculiar privileges. He caused the funeral of
Archimedes to be performed in the most solemn manner,
and ordered a monument to be erected to him among those
of the great persons who had most distinguished themselves
in Syracuse. There are other accounts of the manner of
his death, but all agree that it was accidental, contrary to
the wish of Marcellus, and took place immediately after the
capture of the city.

Archimedes by his will had desired his relations and
friends to put no other epitaph on his tomb, after his death,
than a cylinder circumscribed by a sphere; that is to say,
a globe, or spherical figure, and to set down at the bottom
the proportions which these two solids, the containing and
the contained, have to each other. He might have filled up
the bases of the columns of his tomb with relievos, whereon
the whole history of the siege of Syracuse might have been
carved, and himself appeared like another Jupiter, thundering
upon the Romans. But he set an infinitely higher
value upon the discovery of a geometrical demonstration,
than upon all the so much celebrated machines he had
invented. Hence he chose rather to do himself honour in
the eyes of posterity, by the discovery he had made of the
relation of a sphere to a cylinder of the same base and
height; which is as two to three.

The Syracusans, who had been in former times so fond of
the sciences, did not long retain the esteem and gratitude
they owed a man who had done so much honour to their
city. Less than a hundred and forty years after, Archimedes
was so perfectly forgotten by the citizens, notwithstanding
the great services he had done them, that they
denied his having been buried at Syracuse. It is Cicero
who informs us of this circumstance. At the time he was
quÃ¦stor in Sicily, his curiosity induced him to make a
search after the tomb of Archimedes, a curiosity worthy of
a man of Ciceroâs genius. The Syracusans assured him
that his search would be to no purpose, and that there was
no such monument amongst them. Cicero pitied their
ignorance, which only served to increase his desire of
making the discovery. At length, after several fruitless
attempts, he perceived, without the gate of the city, facing
157

Agrigentum, amongst a great number of tombs, a pillar,
almost entirety concealed by thorns and brambles, through
which he could discern the figure of a sphere and a cylinder.
Those who have any taste for antiquities may easily imagine
the joy of Cicero upon this occasion. Adopting the words
of Archimedes, he exclaimedââI have found what I looked
for.â The place was immediately ordered to be cleared, and
a passage opened to the column, on which was found the
inscription, still legible, though some of the lines were
obliterated by time. So that, says Cicero, on finishing this
account, the greatest city of Greece, and the most flourishing
of old in the study of the sciences, would not have
known the treasure it possessed, if a man, born in a country
which it considered almost as barbarous, a man of Aspinum,
had not discovered for it the tomb of its citizen, so highly
distinguished by the force and penetration of his mind.
We trust our readers will excuse our having gone into more
details in our account of this siege than of most others, but
we consider it one of the most interesting of antiquity.
We do not often meet with the genius of an Archimedes,
or the virtues of a Marcellus, to mitigate the horrors of a
siege.

AGRIGENTUM.

A.C. 409.

Ambition
and thirst of plunder having led the Carthaginians
into Sicily, their general opened the campaign by
laying siege to Agrigentum, an opulent and well-fortified
city. In order to construct terraces and causeways, the
besiegers destroyed the tombs which environed the city,
which sacrilege cost both parties very dear, for the effluvia
which escaped the violated graves bred a most destructive
pestilence. Thousands of soldiers were carried off daily,
and among them Hannibal, the general of the Carthaginians,
fell an early victim to the disease. We think we scarcely
need remind our young readers that this was not the great
Hannibal: they all know how he died. The multitude beheld,
158

in this affliction, a punishment from the gods for the
profanation of the ashes of the dead. To render them
again propitious, prayers and offerings were made, and even
a young child was sacrificed to Saturn. Notwithstanding
these pious vows, famine, a no less redoubtable scourge,
was added to the calamities of the besieged, who, without
hope and without resources, began to speak of surrendering.
The Carthaginians refused to make any terms with them.
Only one resource was left to the unfortunate Agrigentines;
that of abandoning their city and taking refuge in the neighbouring
states. They must either leave their aged and
sick to the mercy of a barbarous enemy, or remain and
perish all together. Necessity prevailed over humanity;
never was exhibited a stronger scene of desolation than of
the Agrigentines, so recently happy and wealthy, departing
for ever from their homes, abandoning their sick or aged
relations, their property, and all they held dear. In their
misfortunes they received a friendly welcome from their
neighbours, the inhabitants of Gela, whilst the cruel Carthaginians
pillaged the city, and massacred every inhabitant
who had been left behind.

Agrigentum was one of those cities from which enormous
wealth and the easy indulgence in every luxury had banished
temperance and morality. The inhabitants were more addicted
to drunkenness than any people of Greece. There is
a story told of a company of young men who were intoxicated
to such a degree as to be convinced by one of their party
they were in a ship in distress, and, in compliance with his
advice, threw all the splendid furniture of the room out of
the windows, to save the vessel from sinking. Almost the
only virtue this people had was hospitality.

We cannot dismiss the subject of Agrigentum without
reverting to the tyrant Phalaris and his brazen bull. Perillo,
a goldsmith, by way of paying his court to Phalaris, a tyrant
of Agrigentum, made him a present of a brazen bull of
excellent workmanship, hollow within, and so constructed,
that the voice of a person shut up in it, sounded exactly like
the bellowing of a bull. The artist pointed out to the tyrant
what an admirable effect this must produce, were he to shut
up a few criminals in it, and make a fire underneath. Phalaris,
struck with the horror of this idea, and perhaps curious
159

to try the experiment, told the goldsmith that he himself
was the only person worthy of animating his bull, as he
must have studied the notes that made it roar to the greatest
advantage, and that it would be unjust to deprive him of any
part of the honour of the invention. Upon which, he
ordered the goldsmith to be shut up, and a great fire to be
kindled round the bull, which immediately began to roar, to
the admiration and delight of all Agrigentum. Cicero says
this bull was carried to Carthage, at the above taking of
Agrigentum, and was restored again by Scipio, after the
destruction of the former city. Empedocles, the philosopher,
born in Agrigentum, has a memorable saying concerning his
fellow-citizens: âThat the Agrigentines squandered their
money as excessively every day, as if they expected not to
live till the morrow; and that they built edifices to live in,
as if they fancied they should never die.â

In the first Punic war, Agrigentum, of which the Carthaginians
had made a place of arms, was taken by the Romans,
after a siege of seven months,âA.C. 262.

Some years after, the Carthaginians retook Agrigentum
in a few days, and completely razed it to the ground. It
was, however, afterwards rebuilt, and is now called Gergenti.

BYZANTIUM.

A.C. 408.

Byzantium
is one of those cities of the world that are so
admirably placed with regard to natural advantages, that
posterity can never too much admire the policy and discernment
of their founders. When we say that the Constantinople
with which science and late events have made
Englishmen so familiar, is the offspring of Byzantium, if not
the city itself, we have no cause to dilate further on that
head.

The first memorable siege of Byzantium was undertaken
by Alcibiades, when the fickle and ungrateful Athenians
160

had recalled him to the head of their armies. His triumphs
were as rapid as his wishes: he prevailed in the Peloponnesus,
subdued the revolting cities, and laid siege to Byzantium.
Alcibiades is another of the commanders we can scarcely
fancy at a siege: an eager, sanguine, impetuous man, with
ambitious views boiling in his brain, is not at home in such
enterprises, whatever may be his talents. Tired of the
length of the siege, and despairing of taking Byzantium by
force, he had recourse to stratagem. He gave it out that
the Athenians recalled him, embarked his army, and set sail.
During the night he returned, landed a great part of his
soldiers at a distance from the city, and himself appeared, in
a menacing position, with his fleet, before the port of Byzantium.
The Byzantines rushed to the shore to drive off the
fleet, which Alcibiades, by his manÅuvres, made them believe
was their most imminent danger. In the mean time, the
troops landed during the night drew near the walls on the
other side, and took possession of the city before the inhabitants
were aware even of their approach.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 341.

The Byzantines were in great peril when Philip, the father
of Alexander the Great, besieged Perinthus. Byzantium
having granted some succours to that city, Philip divided his
army, and laid siege to it likewise. The Byzantines were
reduced to the last extremity when Phocion came to their
assistance. The grateful Perinthians and Byzantines decreed
a crown of gold to the people of Athens.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 196.

The emperor Severus, enraged with the Byzantines, laid
siege to their city. They defended themselves with great
resolution and firmness, and employed all kinds of stratagems
to drive off their enemy, but they could not prevent
the attacks of famine. Decimated by this horrible calamity,
they were constrained to open the gates to the Romans.
The conquerors exercised the rights of war in all their
rigour; the city was plundered, and most of the citizens
were slaughtered.

161

RHODES.

A.C. 352.

The
beautiful island of Rhodes, with all its delightful
mythological associations, its roses and its splendid scenery,
has not escaped the horrors of war; it has been besieged
several times, and in all instances in connection with great
names and great events.

Mausolus, king of Caria, subdued Rhodes. After his
death, the Rhodians revolted, and besieged Artemisia, his
widow, in Halicarnassus. This king and queen are rendered
immortal in the European word
mausoleum
, derived from
the splendid monument so called, one of the seven wonders
of the world, which she built to his memory. She gave
prizes to poets for panegyrics written to commemorate his
virtues; but still further did her grief carry her,âshe resolved
to give him a yet more extraordinary tomb. Having
collected his ashes left by the burning of his body, and
caused the bones to be beaten in a mortar, she mingled some
of the powder every day in her drink, till she had consumed
it all, meaning by this to make her own body the sepulchre
of her husband. Notwithstanding her active, energetic
spirit, her grief proved too strong for her, and she died
lamenting him, two years after his decease.

This princess ordered the inhabitants of Halicarnassus to
meet the Rhodians with open arms, as if they meant to
deliver up their city to them. The deceived Rhodians landed
their men, and left their ships empty, for the purpose of
entering the place. In the mean time, Artemisia ordered
out her own galleys, which seized the fleet of the enemy,
and, having thus deprived them of the means of retreat, she
surrounded the Rhodians and made a general slaughter of
them. This intrepid queen then sailed towards Rhodes. The
citizens, perceiving their vessels coming home crowned with
flowers, admitted the Carian fleet into their port, amidst
162

cries and exclamations of joy. Their surprise may be supposed
when they recognised their unwelcome visitors.
Artemisia insisted upon having the authors of the revolt put
to death, and returned home in triumph. We cannot leave
this remarkable princess without mentioning the extraordinary
part she played in the immortal battle of Salamis. She,
from her country, was of course against the Greeks, and,
with her vessels, formed part of the fleet of Xerxes. She
strongly advised Xerxes to avoid a naval engagement; the
Greeks, she said, were more accustomed to the sea than the
Persians were, and would have a great advantage upon that
element. Although her advice was not listened to, she did
her duty so nobly in the fight, that Xerxes exclaimed,ââThat
if the men appeared like women before the Greeks,
the women fought like heroes.â In order to escape the
Greeks, who pursued her warmly, she hoisted a Greek flag,
and to complete the deception, attacked a Persian vessel
commanded by Clamasithymus, king of Calydna, her personal
enemy, and sunk it. After this, the Greeks, believing
her to be of their party, offered her no more molestation.

SECOND SIEGE.

Demetrius Poliorcetes was commanded by his father,
Antigonus, to punish Rhodes, which held the first rank
among the Sporades isles. Demetrius presented himself
before Rhodes with a numerous fleet; he knew that he was
about to contend with skilful warriors, experienced in sea-fights,
and possessing more than eight hundred machines of
war as redoubtable as his own
helepolis
. Demetrius was an
extraordinary character: equally addicted to pleasure and
business, he never let the one interfere with the other; if
embarked in indulgence, he prided himself upon carrying it
further than any other man; but if thoroughly engaged in
an affair of state, or prosecution of a war, none of the
blandishments of pleasure could turn him aside from the
great business in hand.

The Rhodians, who had foreseen the tempest, had applied
to all the princes their allies, particularly to Ptolemy, king
of Egypt, whom they informed that it was for having favoured
his pretensions they were subjected to this invasion. Our
163

young readers will not fail to observe that Antigonus, the
father of Demetrius, and Ptolemy, king of Egypt, were two
of Alexanderâs generals, and were now endeavouring to carry
out their masterâs will, and proving themselves âmost deserving
of his empire,â by tearing it to pieces.

The preparations on each side were immense. Demetrius
had a fleet of two hundred ships of war, and more than a
hundred and seventy transports, bearing forty thousand men,
without including the cavalry and the assistance he received
from pirates. He had, likewise, a thousand small vessels,
laden with provisions and other accommodations for an
army. Rhodes was extremely rich; and the expectation of
booty lured vast numbers to the ranks of Demetrius. This
prince was celebrated for his skill in attacking fortified
places, and for his ingenuity in constructing machines. He
brought a great number of the latter with him.

Upon landing, Demetrius took a survey, in order to ascertain
the most favourable point for an assault; he likewise
ordered the country round to be laid waste on all sides; he
cut down the trees and demolished the houses, in the parts
adjacent to Rhodes, and employed them as materials to
fortify his camp with a triple palisade.

The Rhodians, on their part, prepared for a vigorous
defence. All persons in alliance with them, possessed of
military merit, threw themselves into the city, for the
purpose of gaining honour as well as of serving them;
the besieged being as celebrated for their valour and constancy,
as the besieger was for his consummate art in
attacking fortified places.

After they had dismissed all useless mouths from the
city, they found their force to consist of six thousand
citizens and a thousand strangers. All slaves who should
distinguish themselves were promised the rights of denizens,
the public paying their masters the full value for them. It
was likewise publicly declared that all who lost their lives
in action should be honourably interred; that their parents,
wives, and children should be provided for, and their
daughters portioned in marriage; and that when their sons
should be of an age capable of bearing arms, they should be
presented with a complete suit of armour, on the public
theatre, at the great solemnity of the Bacchanalia. This
164

decree inspired all ranks, particularly the wealthy and the
makers of war-machines, with incredible zeal.

The besieged sent out three good sailers against a small
fleet of sutlers and merchants, laden with provisions for
the enemy; they sunk some vessels, burnt others, and
carried all prisoners likely to pay a ransom into the city.
The Rhodians gained a great deal of money by this, the
stipulated prices of prisoners being high.

This siege is said to be the masterpiece of Demetrius,
both as to the use of acquired skill and invention. To make
himself master of the port and of the towers which defended
its entrance, he began his operations by sea. To facilitate
his approach to the place he meant to batter, he caused two
tortoises to be erected on two flat-bottomed vessels joined
together. One of these was more solid and strong than
the other, in order to cover the men from the enormous
masses which the enemy discharged from their catapultas
on the walls: the other was of a lighter structure, and
intended to shield the soldiers from the flights of arrows
and darts. Two towers of four stories each were erected at
the same time, which exceeded in height the towers which
defended the entrance to the port, and which were intended
to be used in battering the latter with volleys of stones and
darts. Each of these towers was placed upon ships strongly
bound together.

Demetrius likewise caused a kind of floating barricado to
be erected in front of these tortoises and towers, on a long
beam of timber, four feet thick, through which stakes,
armed at the end with large spikes of iron, were driven.
These stakes were disposed horizontally, with their spikes
projecting forward, in order to prevent the vessels of the
port from shattering the work with their beaks.

He likewise selected some of his largest vessels, on the
sides of which he erected a rampart of planks, with little
windows easy to be opened. He there placed the best
Cretan archers and slingers in his army, and furnished them
with an infinite number of bows, small balistas or cross-bows,
slings and catapultas, with other engines for shooting,
in order to gall the workmen of the city employed in raising
and repairing the walls of the port.

The Rhodians, seeing the besiegers turn all their efforts
165

towards that quarter, were not less industrious to defend it;
in order to accomplish which design, they raised two
machines upon an adjoining eminence, and formed three
others, which they placed in large ships of burden at the
mouth of the little haven. A body of archers and slingers
was likewise posted on each side of these situations, with a
prodigious quantity of stones, darts, and arrows of all
kinds. The same orders were also given with respect to
the ships of burden in the great port.

When Demetrius was advancing with his ships and all
his armament to begin the attack on the ports, such a
violent tempest arose as rendered it impossible for him to
accomplish any of his designs that day; but the sea
growing calm about night, he took advantage of the
darkness, and advanced without being perceived by the
enemy to the great harbour: he made himself master of
a neighbouring eminence, about five hundred paces from the
wall, and posted thereon four hundred soldiers, who fortified
themselves immediately with strong palisades.

The next morning Demetrius caused his batteries to
advance with sound of trumpets and the shouts of his
whole army, and they at first produced all the effect he
proposed from them. A great number of the besieged
were slain in this attack, and several breaches were opened
in the mole which covered the port: but they were of little
advantage to the besiegers, who were always repulsed by the
Rhodians; and after a loss nearly equal on both sides,
Demetrius was obliged to retire from the port, with his ships
and machines, to be out of the reach of the enemyâs arrows.

The besieged, who had learned to their cost what advantage
might be taken of the night, caused several fire-ships
to sail out of the port during the darkness, in order to burn
the tortoises and wooden towers which the enemy had
erected: but as, unfortunately, they were not able to force
the floating barricado which sheltered them, they were
obliged to return into port. The Rhodians lost some
of their fire-ships in this expedition, but the mariners
saved themselves by swimming.

The next day, the prince ordered a general attack to be
made upon the port and the walls of the place, with the
sound of trumpets and the shouts of the whole army,
166

thinking by those means to spread terror among the
besieged; but they were so far from being intimidated, that
they sustained the attack with incredible vigour, and displayed
the same intrepidity for the eight days that it
continued: actions of astonishing bravery were performed
on both sides during that interval.

Demetrius, taking advantage of the eminence which his
troops had seized, gave orders for erecting upon it a battery
of several engines, which discharged great stones of a
hundred and fifty pounds in weight against the walls and
towers, the latter of which tottered with the repeated
shocks, and several breaches were soon made in the walls.
The troops of Demetrius advanced with spirit to seize the
mole which defended the entrance into the port; but as this
post was of the utmost importance, the Rhodians spared
no pains to repulse the besiegers, who had already made a
considerable progress. This they at last effected by a
shower of stones and arrows, which they discharged upon
their enemies with so much rapidity, and for such a length
of time, that the latter were obliged to retire in confusion,
after losing a great number of their men.

The ardour of the besiegers was not at all diminished by
this repulse, indeed, they appeared more animated than
ever against the Rhodians. They began the scalade by the
land and sea at the same time, and employed the besieged
so effectually, that they scarcely knew to what quarter to
run for the defence of the place. The attack was carried
on with the utmost fury on all sides, and the besieged
defended themselves with the greatest intrepidity. Numbers
were thrown from the ladders to the earth, and
miserably bruised; several even of the principal officers got
to the top of the wall, where they were covered with
wounds and taken prisoners; so that Demetrius, notwithstanding
all his valour, thought it necessary to retreat, in
order to repair his engines, which, with the vessels that
bore them, were almost entirely destroyed.

After the princeâs retreat, immediate care was taken to
bury the dead; the beaks of the ships, with the other spoils
that had been taken from the enemy, were carried to the
temples, and the workmen were indefatigable in repairing
the breaches of the walls.

167

Demetrius having employed seven days in refitting his
ships and repairing his engines, set sail again with a fleet
as formidable as the first, and steered with a fair wind
directly for the port, which he was most anxious to gain, as
he conceived it impracticable to reduce the place till he had
made himself master of that. Upon his arrival, he caused a
vast quantity of lighted torches, flaming straw, and arrows
to be discharged, in order to set fire to the vessels that
were riding there, while his engines battered the mole
without intermission. The besieged, who expected attacks
of this nature, exerted themselves with so much vigour and
activity, that they soon extinguished the flames which had
seized the vessels.

At the same time they caused three of their largest ships
to sail out of the port, under the command of Exacestes, one
of their bravest officers, with orders to attack the enemy,
employ the utmost efforts to reach the vessels that carried
the tortoises and wooden towers, and to charge them in
such a manner with the beaks of their own, as might either
sink them or disable them. These orders were executed
with surprising expedition and address; and the three
galleys, after they had broken through the floating barricado,
drove their beaks with so much violence into the sides
of the enemyâs barks, on which the machines were erected,
that the water was immediately seen to enter through
several openings. Two of them were already sunk, but the
third was towed along by the galleys, and joined the main
fleet; and, dangerous as it was to attack them in that situation,
the Rhodians, through a blind and precipitate ardour,
ventured to attempt it. But the inequality was too great
to allow them to come off with success; Exacestes, with the
officer who commanded under him, and some others, after
having fought with all the bravery imaginable, were taken
with the galley in which they were; the other two regained
the port, after sustaining many dangers, and most of the
men also arrived there by swimming.

Unfortunate as the last attack had proved to Demetrius,
he was determined to undertake another; and in order to
succeed in that design, he commanded a machine of a new
invention to be built, of thrice the height and breadth of
those he had lately lost. When this was completed, he
168

caused it to be placed near the port, which he was resolved
to force; but at the instant they were preparing to work it,
a dreadful tempest arose at sea, and sunk it to the bottom,
together with the vessels on which it had been raised.

The besieged, who were careful to improve all opportunities,
employed the time afforded them by the tempest in
regaining the eminence near the port, which the enemy had
carried in the first assault, and where they afterwards fortified
themselves. The Rhodians attacked it, and were
repulsed several times; but the forces of Demetrius, who
defended it, perceiving fresh troops continually pouring upon
them, and that it was in vain for them to expect any relief,
were obliged at last to surrender themselves prisoners, to
the number of four hundred men.

This series of fortunate events was succeeded by the
arrival of five hundred men from Cnessus, a city of Crete,
to the assistance of the Rhodians, and also of five hundred
more, whom Ptolemy sent from Egypt, most of them being
Rhodians, who had enlisted themselves amongst the troops
of that prince.

Demetrius being extremely mortified to see all his batteries
on the side of the harbour rendered ineffectual,
resolved to employ them by land, in order to carry the place
by assault, or reduce it to the necessity of capitulating.
He therefore prepared materials of every kind, and formed
a machine called
helepolis
, which was larger than any that
had ever been invented before. The basis on which it stood
was square, and each of its sides was seventy-five feet wide.
The machine itself was an assemblage of large square beams,
riveted together with iron; and the whole mass rested upon
eight wheels, that were made proportionable with the superstructure.
The felloes of the wheels were three feet thick,
and were strengthened with large iron plates. In order to
facilitate and vary the movements of the helepolis, castors
were placed under it, so that it could be moved in any
direction. From each of the four angles a large column of
wood was carried up to the height of about one hundred and
fifty feet, inclining towards each other. The machine was
composed of nine stories, whose dimensions gradually lessened
in the ascent. The first story was supported by forty-three
beams, and the last by no more than nine. Three sides of
169

the machine were plated over with iron, to prevent its being
damaged by the fires launched against it from the city. In
the front of each story were little windows, whose form and
dimensions corresponded with the nature of the arrows that
were to be shot from the machine. Over each window was
a kind of curtain made of leather, stuffed with wool: this
was let down by a machine; and the intention of it was to
break the violence of whatever might be discharged against
it. Each story had two large staircases, one for the ascent
of the men, and the other for their descent.

This machine was moved forward by three thousand four
hundred of the most powerful men in the army; but the art
with which it was built greatly facilitated the motion.

Demetrius likewise gave directions for the building of a
great number of other machines, of different magnitudes
and for various purposes; he also employed his seamen in
levelling the ground over which his machines had to move,
which was a hundred fathoms in length. The number of
artisans and labourers employed on these works amounted
to nearly thirty thousand men, which enabled them to be
completed with astonishing rapidity.

The Rhodians were not indolent during these formidable
preparations, but employed their time in raising a counter
wall on the tract of ground where Demetrius intended to
batter the walls of the city with the helepolis; and for this
purpose they demolished the wall which surrounded the
theatre, as also several neighbouring houses, and even some
temples, having solemnly promised the gods to build magnificent
structures for the celebration of their worship
after the siege should be raised.

When they learnt that the enemy had quitted the sea,
they sent out nine of their best ships of war, divided into
three squadrons, commanded by three of their best officers.
These returned with a rich prize of some galleys and several
smaller vessels, with a great number of prisoners. They
had likewise seized a galley richly laden, in which were
large quantities of tapestry and other furniture, with a
variety of rich robes, sent by Phila as a present to her
husband Demetrius, accompanied with letters from her own
hand. The Rhodians sent the whole, even the letters, to
Ptolemy, which exceedingly exasperated Demetrius. In
170

this proceeding, says Plutarch, they did not imitate the
polite conduct of the Athenians, who, having once seized
some of the couriers of Philip, with whom they were at war,
opened all the packets but those of Olympias, which they
sent to Philip with the seals unbroken. There are some
rules of decency and honour which ought to be inviolably
observed, even with enemies.

While the ships of the republic were employed in taking
the above-named prizes, a great commotion arose in Rhodes
respecting the statues of Antigonus and Demetrius, which
had been erected to their honour in the city, and till the
present war had been held in much respect. Some of the
citizens, in a public meeting, expressed a wish to have the
statues of princes who had brought so much trouble upon
them destroyed; but the people, who were, for a wonder,
more moderate on this occasion than their chiefs, would not
allow that purpose to be executed. This was prudent and
judicious in the Rhodians; much importance was attached
to statues in ancient times, and in case the city should be
taken, Demetrius would be better pleased to find his and
his fatherâs statues still respected.

Demetrius, having tried several mines without effect, from
their being all discovered by the watchful activity of the
besieged, gave orders and made preparation for a general
assault, and the helepolis was moved to a situation whence
the city might be battered with most effect. Each story of
this formidable building was furnished with catapultas and
balistas proportioned in their size to the dimensions of the
place. It was likewise supported and fortified, on two of
its sides, by four small machines called tortoises, each of
which had a covered gallery, to secure those who should
either enter the helepolis, or issue out of it to execute
orders. On the two other sides was a battering-ram of a
prodigious size, consisting of a piece of timber thirty fathoms
in length, armed with iron terminating in a point, and as
strong as the beak of a galley. These engines were mounted
on wheels, and were driven forward to batter the walls during
the attack, with incredible force, by nearly a thousand men.

When everything was ready, Demetrius ordered the
trumpets to sound and the general assault to be given on
all sides, both by sea and land. In the heat of the attack,
171

and when the walls were already shaken by the battering-rams,
ambassadors arrived from the Cnidians, earnestly
soliciting Demetrius to suspend the assault, and giving him
hopes that they should prevail upon the Rhodians to consent
to an honourable capitulation. A suspension of arms was
accordingly granted, but the Rhodians refusing to capitulate
on the conditions proposed to them, the attack was
renewed with so much fury, and all the machines co-operated
so effectually, that a large tower, built with square
stones, and the wall that flanked it, were battered down.
The besieged fought with the utmost bravery in the breach,
and repulsed their enemies.

In this conjuncture the vessels which Ptolemy had
freighted with three hundred thousand measures of corn
and different kinds of pulse, for the Rhodians, arrived very
seasonably in the port, notwithstanding all the efforts of the
enemyâs ships which cruised in the neighbourhood to intercept
them. A few days after this relief, two other small
fleets sailed into the port, one of which was sent by
Cassander, with one hundred thousand bushels of barley;
the other came from Lysimachus, with four hundred thousand
bushels of wheat, and as much barley. This seasonable
and abundant supply, which was received when the city
began to feel the want of provisions, inspired the besieged
with new courage, and they resolved not to surrender till
the last extremity.

Whilst in this state of renewed spirits, they attempted to
fire the enemyâs machines, and with this view, a numerous
body of soldiers marched out of the city towards midnight,
with torches and flaming brands. These troops advanced to
the batteries, and set them on fire, whilst clouds of arrows
were poured from the walls to annoy those who endeavoured
to extinguish the flames. The besiegers lost great numbers
of men on this occasion, from being incapable in the night
to see or avoid the volleys of arrows discharged upon them.
Several plates of iron happening to fall from the helepolis
during the action, the Rhodians advanced with the hopes of
setting it on fire; but, as the troops within quenched it with
water as fast as the flames were kindled, they could not effect
their design. Demetrius, however, alarmed for his machines,
caused them to be removed to a distance.

172

Being curious to know what number of machines the
besieged had employed in casting arrows, Demetrius caused
all that had been shot from the place in the course of that
night to be collected; and when they were counted and a
proper computation made, he found that the inhabitants
must have more than eight hundred engines of different
dimensions, for discharging fires, and about fifteen hundred
for arrows. He was struck with consternation at the number,
as he had never thought the city could have made such
formidable preparations. He buried his dead, gave strict
charge with respect to the care of the wounded, and promptly
repaired his injured machines.

The besieged took advantage of the temporary absence of
the machines to fortify themselves against a fresh attack.
To this purpose, they opened a wide and deep ditch behind
the breach, to obstruct the passage of the enemy into the
city; after which, they raised a substantial wall, in the form
of a crescent, along the ditch, which would create still more
trouble.

Alive to every expedient, they at the same time detached
a squadron of their best sailing ships, which captured a great
number of vessels laden with provisions for Demetriusâs
army. This supply was soon followed by a numerous fleet
of small vessels, freighted with corn and other necessaries,
sent them by Ptolemy, with fifteen hundred men commanded
by Antigonus of Macedonia.

Demetrius, having repaired his machines, caused them all
to advance towards the city, when a second embassy arrived
from the Athenians, and some other states of Greece, on the
same subject as the former, but with as little success. The
king, whose imagination was fruitful in expedients, ordered
fifteen hundred of his best troops, under the command of
Alcimus and Mancius, to enter the breach at midnight, and
force the intrenchments behind it. They were then to possess
themselves of the parts near the theatre, where, if they
could but once make themselves masters, they could maintain
their ground. In order to facilitate the execution of so
important and dangerous an expedition, and amuse the
enemy with false attacks, he at the same time caused all
the trumpets to sound a charge, and the city to be attacked
on all sides, both by sea and land, that the besieged, finding
173

employment in all parts, the fifteen hundred men might have
an opportunity of forcing the intrenchments which covered
the breach, and afterwards of seizing all the advantageous
posts about the theatre. This feint had all the success the
prince expected from it. The troops having shouted from
all quarters, as if they were advancing to a general assault,
the detachment commanded by Alcimus entered the breach,
and made such a vigorous attack upon those who defended
the ditch and the crescent which covered it, that, after they
had killed a great number of their enemies and thrown the
rest into confusion, they seized the posts adjacent to the
theatre, where they maintained themselves.

The alarm was very great in the city, and all the chiefs
who commanded there despatched orders to their officers
and soldiers, forbidding them to quit their posts or make
the least movement whatever. After which, they placed
themselves at the head of a chosen body of their own
troops, and of those newly arrived from Egypt, and with
them poured upon the detachment which had advanced as
far as the theatre; but the obscurity of the night rendered
it impracticable to dislodge them from the posts they had
seized; and the day no sooner appeared, than a universal
cry of the besiegers was heard from all quarters, by which
they endeavoured to animate those who had entered the
place, and inspire them with a resolution to maintain their
ground, where they might soon expect succours. This
dreadful cry drew floods of tears and dismal groans from the
populace, women and children, who concluded all to be
inevitably lost. The battle, however, was contested with
great vigour near the theatre; and the Macedonians defended
their posts with an intrepidity that astonished their
enemies, till at last, the Rhodians prevailing by their numbers
and perpetual supplies of fresh troops, the detachment,
after having seen Alcimus and Mancius slain on the spot,
were obliged to submit to superior force, and abandon an
advantage it was no longer possible to maintain. Great
numbers of them fell on the spot, and the rest were taken
prisoners.

The ardour of Demetrius was rather augmented than
abated by this check, and he was making the necessary dispositions
for a new assault, when he received letters from
174

his father, Antigonus, by which he was directed to take all
possible measures for the conclusion of a peace with the
Rhodians. He then wanted some plausible pretext for
suspending the siege, and chance furnished him with it. At
that very instant, deputies from Ãtolia arrived in the camp,
to solicit him anew to grant a peace to the Rhodians, to
which they found him not so averse as before.

If what Vegetius relates of the helepolis be true,âand,
indeed, with a small variation, Vitruvius seems to confirm it,âit
might possibly be another motive that contributed not
a little to dispose Demetrius to a peace. He was preparing
to advance his helepolis against the city, when a Rhodian
engineer contrived an expedient to render it utterly useless:
he opened a mine under the walls of the city, and continued
it to the way over which the tower was to pass toward the
walls the next day. The besiegers, not expecting a stratagem
of that nature, moved the tower on to the place undermined,
which being incapable of supporting so enormous a
load, sunk in under the machine, which buried itself so deep
in the earth, that it was impossible to draw it out again.
This was one inconvenience to which all these formidable
machines were obnoxious; and the two authors cited
declare that the accident determined Demetrius to raise the
siege; and it is at least very probable that it contributed
not a little to his taking that resolution.

The Rhodians, on their part, were as desirous of an accommodation
as himself, provided it could be effected on
reasonable terms. Ptolemy, in promising them fresh succours
much more considerable than the former, had earnestly
exhorted them not to lose a favourable opportunity, if it
should offer itself. Besides which, they were sensible of the
extreme necessity of putting an end to a siege which must
prove fatal at last. This consideration induced them to
listen with pleasure to the proposals made them, and the
treaty was concluded soon after, upon the following terms:
That the republic of Rhodes and all its citizens should retain
the enjoyment of their rights, privileges, and liberty, without
being subjected to any power whatever. The alliance they
had had with Antigonus was to be confirmed and renewed,
with an obligation to take up arms for him in any war in
which he should be engaged, provided it was not against
175

Ptolemy. The city was also to deliver a hundred hostages,
to be chosen by Demetrius, for the effectual performance
of the stipulated articles. When these hostages were given,
the army decamped from before Rhodes, after having besieged
it a year.

Demetrius, upon being reconciled with the Rhodians, was
desirous, before his departure, to give them a proof of his
good feeling, and accordingly made them a present of all the
machines of war he had employed in that siege. Considering
that Rhodes was an island, and that these cumbersome, unwieldy
engines could not have been taken away without
great difficulty, we moderns are inclined to think there was
not much generosity in the gift; but the result proves we
are wrong. The machines were sold for three hundred
talents (about three hundred thousand crowns), which the
Rhodians employed, with an additional sum of their own, in
constructing the famous Colossus, which was reputed one of
the seven wonders of the world. It was a statue of the sun,
of so stupendous a size, that ships in full sail passed between
its legs; the height of it was seventy cubits, or one hundred
and five feet, and few men could clasp its thumb within their
arms. It was the work of Chares of Lindus, and employed
him for the space of twelve years. Sixty-six years after its
erection, it was thrown down by an earthquake.

The Rhodians expressed their gratitude to Ptolemy in a
most extravagant manner: they planted a grove, built a
temple in it to his glory, and paid him divine honours under
the title of
Sotor
, the Saviour, by which he is distinguished
in history from the other Ptolemies, kings of Egypt.

We cannot leave Rhodes, without a remark or two upon
the love Demetrius bore to the arts, and the height to which
they appear to have been cultivated in that island.

Rhodes, at the time of the siege, was the residence of a
celebrated painter named Protogenes, a native of Caunus, a
city of Caria, which was then subject to the Rhodians. The
apartment in which he painted was in the suburbs when
Demetrius first besieged the city; but neither the presence
of the enemy, nor the noise of arms, which perpetually rung
in his ears, could induce him to quit his habitation or discontinue
his work. Demetrius was surprised at his firmness
and persistency, and asked him the cause of it. âIt is,â replied
176

the painter, âbecause I am sensible you have declared
war against the Rhodians, and not against the arts.â Nor
was he deceived in this opinion; for Demetrius actually
showed himself their protector. He planted a guard round
his house, that the artist might enjoy tranquillity, or, at
least, be secure from danger; he frequently went to see him
work, and was boundless in his admiration of his application
and skill.

The masterpiece of this painter was
Jalysus
, an historical
piece of a fabulous hero of that name, whom the Rhodians
acknowledged as their founder. Protogenes devoted seven
years to this picture. When Apelles first saw it, he was so
astonished and delighted that he seemed struck dumb: he
at length, however, broke out into the warmest commendation:
âProdigious work, indeed! admirable performance!
It has not, however, the graces I give my works, and which
have raised their reputation to the skies.â Pliny says that
whilst Protogenes was working at this picture, he practised
the most rigid abstinence, in order that the delicacy of his
taste and imagination might not be affected by his diet.
This picture was carried to Rome, and consecrated in the
Temple of Peace, where it remained in the time of Pliny;
but it was destroyed at last by fire. Pliny, indeed, pretends
that Rhodes was saved by this picture, because, as it hung in
the only quarter by which it was possible for Demetrius to
take the city, he rather chose to abandon his conquest than
expose so precious a monument of art to the danger of being
consumed by the flames. This would appear to be carrying
his love of painting to a surprising length; but the incidents
we are told of the enthusiastic worship of the Greeks for
refinement and taste, if they do not convince us of their own
identical truth, at least prove to us the extent to which that
love must have been felt by a people who could even invent
such.

One of the figures of the picture was a dog, much admired
by good judges, and which had cost the painter great pains,
without his being able to express his idea to his own satisfaction,
though pleased with the rest of the work. His wish
was to represent the dog panting, and with his mouth foaming,
as after a long chase; and yet, with all his skill, he could
not content himself: art was more visible than it ought to
177

be. He was desirous that the foam should not appear to be
painted, but actually flowing from the mouth of the dog.
He frequently retouched it, and suffered a degree of torture
from his anxiety to express the simple effects of nature which
he had in his mind. All his attempts were in vain, till, in
a fit of rage, and with an imprecation, he threw the sponge
he was accustomed to wipe his palette with at the pictureâand
chance accomplished what art had not been able to execute.

This painter is censured for being too difficult to be
pleased, and for retouching his pictures too frequently. It
is certain, that although Apelles almost considered him as
his master, and allowed him a number of excellent qualities,
yet he condemned in him the defect of not being able to lay
down the pencil and consider his work finished. âWe
ought,â says Cicero, âto know how far we should go: and
Apelles justly censured some painters for not knowing when
to have done.â

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1521.

Rhodes, like the rest of Greece, submitted to the empire
of the Romans, and, when that had been annihilated
by the barbarians, it passed under the yoke of the all-conquering
Mahometans. In 1308, Foulques de Villard, grand
master of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, formed the
project of conquering this island, in order to make it the
head-quarters of his order. Seconded by several of the sovereigns
of Europe, he landed on the isle, beat the Saracens
and the Greeks in several encounters, and, after four years
of fatigue and danger, made himself master of Rhodes. The
knights placed the isle in a formidable state of defence, and,
under their auspices, it became happy and flourishing. These
precautions were quite necessary, for Greeks, Saracens, and
Turks were continually attempting to gain footing in this
beautiful place. Mahomet the Second, the great conqueror
of Constantinople, wished to besiege it; but his generals were
beaten, and he himself died, while proceeding on this expedition.
The glory of taking Rhodes was reserved for Soliman
the Second, whose troops approached the isle in 1521.
Villiers de lâIsle-Adam, grand master of the Knights of St.
John, reigned there at that time: he was an intrepid,
courageous, skilful captain, of great experience, and fertile
178

in resources. He had, at most, six thousand warriors to
oppose to two hundred thousand men. But, like their leader,
these warriors were filled with the most heroic valour, and
preferred death to slavery. Rhodes was invested, and the
trenches were opened out of the reach of the cannon.
When the Turks ventured nearer, and erected a battery,
their works were speedily destroyed by the artillery of the
place. The frequent sorties of the knights filled up their
works. The discouragement became so general among the
Turks, that Soliman was obliged to show himself to his
troops, and animate their operations by his presence.

What had been written to him of the ill-behaviour of his
soldiers, and what he learnt of their cowardice on his arrival,
determined him to make them appear before him disarmed,
and to surround them by the troops he had brought with
him. âIf I had,â said he, in a haughty, contemptuous tone,
and casting terrible glances on all around him, âif I had to
address soldiers, I would have permitted you to appear before
me with your arms; but as I am reduced to the necessity
of speaking to wretched slaves, more weak and more timid
than women, it is not just that men so base should dishonour
the marks of valour. I should like to know if, when you
landed in the isle, you flattered yourselves that these crusaders
would be still more cowardly than yourselves, and
that they would servilely hold out their hands for the irons
with which it would please you to load them? To undeceive
you, please to learn that in the persons of these knights, we
have to fight with the most intrepid among the Christians,
and most thirsting for Mussulman blood. It is their courage
which has excited ours; in attacking them, I have thought
I had met with an enterprise and perils worthy of my valour.
Is it to you, then, base and effeminate troops, that I am to
look for a conquest; you who fly from an enemy before you
have seen him, and who would already have deserted, if the
sea which surrounds you had not presented an insurmountable
obstacle? Before experiencing such a disgrace, I will
inflict such severe justice upon all cowards, that their
punishment shall restrain within their duty such as might
be tempted to imitate them.â Scarcely had Soliman ceased
to speak, than the soldiers drew their swords, as if to massacre
those of their comrades who had excited the indignation of the
179

Sultan. These unfortunate wretches, who saw death suspended
over their heads, implored with loud cries the mercy
of their sultan. Their commander, as agreed upon with him,
supported their prayers. âWell,â said Soliman to Peri, the
general, âI suspend, to your prayers, the punishment of the
guilty; it remains for them to find pardon on the bastions
and bulwarks of the enemy.â This mixture of severity and
clemency affected all hearts; the greatest perils appeared to
be beneath the valour of the soldiers who had been the most
discouraged. Officers and soldiers, to efface the least traces
of their murmurs, hastened to signalize themselves under the
eye of their master; and that armed multitude, till that
time to be little dreaded, became at length most formidable.
The soldiers and pioneers pushed on the trenches without
relaxation; they worked day and night; the grand master,
finding them supported by large detachments, did not
think it prudent to continue the sorties, in which he lost
more by the death of one knight, than Soliman did by that
of fifty janissaries. Thus the infidels, having nothing to
fear but from the fire of the place, behaved with so much
spirit that they carried their works up to the counterscarp;
and, to render their lines more solid, they covered
them without with posts and planks, bound well together.
The batteries were then increased, and continued incessantly
playing against the city, but without success, for their balls
scarcely grazed the parapets of the walls. They were
warned of this by a Jew, who served them as a spy in
Rhodes. They immediately changed their batteries, which
from that time fired more effectively. Seeing that the place
might be said to be covered and buried under its fortifications,
the Turks resolved to build two cavaliers of a greater
height than its works, which should command the city and
its boulevards. Soldiers and pioneers, by order of the general,
brought, during several days, earth and stones, which they
placed between the gates of Spain and Auvergne, opposite
to the bastion of Italy. These two points lay open to the
cannon of the place: thousands of men perished here; but
such losses were deemed nothing. At length two seeming
hills appeared to rise up, higher by twelve feet than the
walls, and which completely commanded them. The German
post was the first attacked. The Turks pointed their
180

cannon towards the walls, and it was thought impossible
they could stand against these destructive machines. The
grand master went to the spot, and ordered the wall to be
supported within by earth, beams, posts, and fascines; and,
as the artillery placed over the gate of his palace, on an
elevated spot, bore directly upon the infidels, the Christian
cannoniers poured their shot upon them, and knocked to
pieces their bastions and their parapets. New ones were
obliged to be constructed; the cannon of the city battered
them down immediately, whilst the Turkish artillery, on the
contrary, badly served and pointed, fired over the walls,
without doing any injury. Disheartened by the little effect
produced by their batteries, the Sultanâs officers transported
them against the tower of St. Nicholas. They played upon
it with twelve guns; but they had the mortification to see
their cannon dismounted and their batteries ruined by those
of the tower. To guard against this effect of the skill of the
Christian cannoniers, they resolved to fire only by night,
and during the day they buried their cannon under the
gabions in the sand: on the approach of darkness, they
were placed upon the platform. More than five hundred
balls were fired against the point of the wall looking towards
the west, and brought it down into the ditch. The Turks
congratulated themselves upon the success of this nocturnal
battery, and felt certain of carrying the fort at the first
assault; they were astonished, however, to see behind the
ruins a new wall, terraced with its parapets, and bristling
with artillery which prevented all approach to it. Soliman
caused all the principal bastions of the place to be attacked,
and the Ottoman cannon, which battered them day and
night during a whole month, did them considerable damage.
The numbers of knights and citizens in Rhodes began to
diminish fast. They were in want of powder; the grand
master caused some to be made, and hopes were entertained
that this feeble succour would enable them to hold out for
a long time against the Mahometan emperor. Up to this
time, the war had only been carried on by artillery; and
although that of the Turks, in the multitude of fiery mouths
and abundance of powder, was very superior, they were
not yet masters of an inch of ground in the bastions or
advanced works of the place. The retirades and intrenchments
181

dug by the knights, supplied the places of the battered-down
walls. These new works could only be taken by
assault; and to mount to it, it was necessary to attempt the
descent of the ditch, or to fill it up. Soliman having an
immense number of pioneers in his army, formed several
detachments of them, with orders to throw earth and stones
into the ditch. But the knights, by means of casemates,
removed, by night, all the rubbish the Turks had brought
during the day. Other Turkish pioneers were employed
in digging mines in five different places, each one of which
led to the bastion opposite to it. Some of these were detected
by the vigilance of the famous De Martinengere, to whom is
due the invaluable invention of discovering, by means of
stretched skins, where mining is being carried on. The
Turks had worked with so much address, that the different
branches of these mines went from one to another, and all,
to produce the greater effect, ended at the same place. Two
of these mines sprang, one after the other, under the English
bastion. Their explosion was so violent, that they threw
down more than six toises of the wall, the ruins of which
filled up the ditch. The breach was so large and so easy,
that several battalions flew to the assault, with loud cries,
sabre in hand. They at once gained the top of the bastion,
and planted seven flags, and would have rendered themselves
masters of it, if they had not met with a traverse behind it,
which stopped them. The knights, recovered from the astonishment
caused by the fearful noise of the exploded mine,
rushed to the bastion, and charged the Turks with muskets,
grenades, and stones.

The grand master, at the moment of the explosion of this
volcano, was in a neighbouring church, imploring, at the
foot of the altar, the aid of God. He judged, by the horrible
noise he heard, that the explosion of the mine would be
followed by an assault. He arose at the very moment the
priests, to commence the office, were chanting this preliminary
prayerâ
Deus, in adjutorium meum intende!
(Lord, come to
my help!) âI accept the augury,â cried the pious general;
and turning towards some knights who accompanied him,
âCome, my brothers,â said he, âlet us change the sacrifice
of our praises into that of our lives, and let us die, if it be
necessary, in defence of our holy faith.â As he spoke, pike in
182

hand, he advanced with a menacing air. He mounted the
bastion, met the Turks, and struck down and killed all who
came in his way or resisted him. He tore down the enemyâs
ensigns, and regained the bastion in a moment. Mustapha,
Solimanâs general, rallied the fugitives and led them back
towards the enemy, by dint of blows as well as menaces.
He marched forward himself with the greatest audacity.
The combat was renewed, and the
mÃªlÃ©e
became bloody.
Steel and fire were equally employed on both parts; they
slaughtered each other hand to hand, or at a distance, by
musket-shots or sword-cuts. They even proceeded to
struggle body to body, and the stronger or more adroit
killed his enemy with dagger-thrusts. The Turks, at once
exposed to arquebusses, stones, grenades, and fire-pots, at
length abandoned the breach and turned their backs. In
vain their chiefs, by menaces and promises, endeavour to
reanimate their valour. They do not listen to him. All
fly, all disperse, and Mustapha himself turns unwillingly
from the foe, after having lost more than three thousand
men. It was with such inveteracy that the superiority was
contested up to the 24th of September, when Soliman issued
the order for a general assault. At daybreak the Mahometans,
divided into four bodies, or rather four armies,
advanced on four sides boldly towards the breach, in spite
of the thunders which poured from the place, in spite of a
deluge of balls, arrows, darts, and stones. Nothing could
stop them. The knights crowded to the point of conflict;
they repulsed the assailants; they precipitated them from
the walls; they overthrew the ladders. The infidels returned
to the charge with more impetuosity than ever, but all their
efforts were useless: the knights were invincible. The
priests, monks, old men, and even the children, all insist
upon taking their share of the peril, and at length repulse
the enemy. The women do not yield in exertions to the
pioneers, or in courage to the soldiers. Many lost their
lives in defending their husbands. A Greek woman, exceedingly
handsome, the mistress of an officer who commanded
in a bastion, and who was just killed, frantic at the death
of her lover, and resolved not to outlive him, after having
tenderly embraced two young children she had had by him,
and imprinted the sign of the cross upon their browââIt
183

is better, my children,â said she, with the tears streaming
from her eyes, âit is better for you to die by my hands than
by those of our pitiless enemies, or that you should be
reserved for infamous pleasures, more cruel than death.â
Frantic with grief and rage, she seized a knife, slaughtered
them, and threw their bodies into the fire; then clothing
herself in the garments of her lover, stained with his blood,
with his sabre in her hand, she rushed to the breach, killed
the first Turk who opposed her, wounded several others, and
died fighting with the bravery of a hero. The ill success of
so many assaults rendered Soliman furious. He ordered
Mustapha to be shot with arrows, and several other captains
would have undergone the same fate if they had not persuaded
him that he might still succeed in his undertaking.
Incessant combats and attacks were carried on up to the
middle of winter. At length the Ottomans triumphed;
Rhodes, almost entirely destroyed, had no means of resistance
left. Most of the knights had been killed defending
the fortifications. The grand master, Villiers de lâIsle-Adam,
seeing with the deepest grief that all his resources
were exhausted, felt that it would be madness to resist
longer. He resolved to surrender; but his persuasion that
he who makes the first proposals loses an advantage, made
him positively determine to wait till the Turks should
propose capitulation. His project succeeded. Deceived by
the continued brave defence, the Turks were ignorant of
the real state of the place, and offered the besiegers more
honourable conditions than they might have expected. This
famous isle, which had been for nearly three centuries the
bulwark of Christianity, was wrested from the hands of its
few surviving defenders, the wreck of a society of heroes.
As soon as the capitulation was signed, Soliman entered the
city for the purpose of expressing to lâIsle-Adam his admiration
of his noble defence. After a long conversation the
conqueror retired, saying, âAlthough I came here alone, do
not imagine I was without an escort; I had the parole of
the grand master and the faith of his knights, a security
stronger than a whole army.â Soliman did not abuse his
victory. He treated the grand master generously; he visited
him, pitied him, and consoled him as that last of a race of
heroes deserved.

GAZA.

A.C. 332.

Alexander
besieged Gaza, one of the keys of Egypt, for
two months. We do not think we should have noticed this
siege, had it not been for the strange manner in which
Alexander dismissed all the good feelings which so frequently
distinguished him, after the conquest. Alexander
is one of those great historical personages, who have so
many fine redeeming qualities, that we feel inclined to
pardon their errors and excuse even their crimes; but in
this instance he sunk into a mere brutal and revengeful
conqueror. He had an inclination to be compared to
Achilles, and he boasted of being the son of Jupiter; but
this siege proved that he was not invulnerable, like the
former, nor exempt from human accidents, as the offspring
of an immortal; he received two wounds in this siege, which
perhaps was the cause of his wrath. He treated the inhabitants
with the utmost cruelty, putting ten thousand to the
sword. Betis, the governor of Gaza, was taken in one of
the last assaults. Alexander was either angry or jealous at
the courage with which he had seen him face death, and
ordered him to appear before his throne: âWretch!â cried
he, âthou shalt not die sword in hand, as thou didst hope;
expect to suffer all the torments vengeance can contrive.â
To imitate Achilles, who dragged the body of Hector three
times round the walls of Troy behind his chariot, he ordered
the unfortunate Betis to be pierced through the heels, and
to be fastened to a chariot, which he drove round the walls
of Gaza; thus depriving the brave governor of the little life
left by his wounds.

Demetrius lost a great battle on the plains of Gaza,
against Ptolemy, one of Alexanderâs officers, who had made
himself king of Egypt,âA.C. 312.

185

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 633.

Amrou, commander of the Saracens, presented himself
before Gaza in the year 633 of the Christian era. The
governor of the place haughtily asked him, in an interview,
what brought him into Syria? âThe order of God and of
my master,â replied Amrou. They soon proceeded to action:
the troops of Gaza were cut to pieces; Amrou took the
governor prisoner, and Gaza opened its gates to him.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1799.

Gaza was taken by Buonaparte, in his Egyptian expedition;
but as there is no striking circumstance to give
interest to the siege, we shall content ourselves with
recording the fact.

PERSEPOLIS.

A.C. 330.

Ever
insatiable of glory, Alexander laid siege to Persepolis,
the capital of the Persian empire. At his approach,
the inhabitants deserted the city, and fled away into the
deserts, and the conqueror entered without the least obstacle.
The Macedonian soldiery, greedy of booty, pillaged the city,
and destroyed the few inhabitants they met with. But
Alexander stopped the carnage, and gave orders that the
virtue of the women should be respected. Almost all the
treasures and magazines of the Persians were collected in
Persepolis, which had been their capital from the time of
Cyrus. The amount of wealth is so enormous, that a modern
historian is afraid to repeat what the ancients have stated:
it appears to be a subject for the imagination rather than of
calculation or comparison. So rich a booty gave rise to the
idea of celebrating this event by a festival. Tables were
spread in the streets; the soldiers gave themselves up to
rejoicings and the enjoyment of good cheer, whilst their
186

prince presided at a grand banquet given to his officers
and friends. ThaÃ¯s, an Athenian courtezan, the mistress of
Ptolemy, who was afterwards king of Egypt, had gained the
privilege of being admitted to the royal table by her wit and
gaiety, and was accustomed to address the conqueror of
Asia with the utmost freedom. When wine had sufficiently
warmed the guests, ThaÃ¯s exclaimedââNoble lord! thanks
to your invincible courage, Greece is avenged; you are
master of Persia, and we are quaffing the wines of Darius
in the palace of the Persian kings. The pleasures I enjoy
in this superb abode make amends for the fatigues I have
endured whilst you subdued Asia. There is only one thing
wanting to complete my felicity. Great prince, why will
you not permit the women who have had the honour to
follow your warriors to make one glorious blaze of the
dwelling of Xerxes, the barbarian who burnt and destroyed
my country? I should consider myself a thousand times
too fortunate if I could myself set fire to it in your presence,
and to let it be known to all ages, that a woman in
the train of the great Alexander had more nobly avenged
Greece than Miltiades or Themistocles had done!â The
guests applauded this boastful appeal. The king rose from
table with his head crowned with flowers, and seizing a
blazing torch, rushed to the execution of the suggested
sacrifice. The Macedonians, following the example of their
king and ThaÃ¯s, spread themselves in all directions with
their flaming brands, and soon produced an awful conflagration.
But scarcely had the first flame cast its glare around,
than Alexander became aware of his folly, and gave earnest
orders for the extinguishing of the fire; but it was too lateâthe
palace was consumed.

187

LACEDÃMON.

A.C. 272.

The
restless, ambitious, insatiable Pyrrhus, king of
Epirus, laid siege to LacedÃ¦mon. He arrived in the evening,
with all his army, and only postponed the attack till the
next day;âthis delay saved Sparta. As soon as night came,
the LacedÃ¦monians met to deliberate upon the propriety of
sending their wives and daughters to the island of Crete;
but the women strongly opposed such a determination. One
of them, named Archidamia, entered the senate, sword in
hand, and addressing the assembly in the name of all the
rest, she proudly demanded why the senators had so bad an
opinion of her and her companions, as to imagine they could
love or endure life after the ruin of their country.

It was resolved that they should not leave the city. As
the men were employed, with vigour and celerity, in digging
a trench parallel with the camp of the enemy, to enable them
to dispute the approach to the city, the women and girls came
to join them, and after having exhorted those who would
have to fight, to take repose during the night, they measured
the length of the trench, and undertook, as their share, a
third part of it, which they finished in the course of the day.
This trench was nine feet wide, six deep, and nine hundred
long. In all the attacks which took place till Pyrrhus was
constrained to raise the siege, these courageous women conducted
themselves in a manner worthy of the reputation of
their mothers of former days.

188

ARGOS.

A.C. 272.

The
same ambitious, quarrelsome prince fell upon Argos,
at a time when it was divided by the factions of Aristias
and Aristippus. The Argives at first sent to Pyrrhus to beg
him to evacuate their territories. He promised to do so,
but that very same night entered their gates, aided by the
treachery of Aristias. A great part of his troops had already
spread themselves throughout the city, when an act of imprudence
deprived him of his victory and his life. Whoever reads
the life of Pyrrhus will observe the importance he always
attached to his elephantsâengines of war, if we may so call
them, introduced for a time into Europe by the conquests
of Alexander. He had tried to terrify the Romans with
these monstrous animals, but without success. So partial
was he to these bulky assistants, that he insisted upon their
being brought into LacedÃ¦mon, though the gates were not
large enough, or the streets sufficiently wide, to make them
at all available. Alarmed by the noise created by the confusion
the elephants produced, the Argives flew to arms, and
their houses became so many citadels, from which they
poured all sorts of missiles down upon the troops of the
king of Epirus. The elephants so completely blocked up
the way, as to prevent the entrance of fresh troops, and were
of more injury to their masters than to the Spartans. Abandoned
by his people, Pyrrhus maintained his character for
personal valour by the brave manner in which he fought his
way through the enemy. An Argive attacked him, and
hurled his javelin at him; but the point was blunted by the
thickness of his cuirass. The furious prince was about to
strike him dead, when the mother of the Argive, who beheld
the fight from the roof of her house, threw a tile at Pyrrhus,
which, striking him on the head, stretched him senseless on
the ground. One of the soldiers of Antigonus coming up,
189

was rejoiced to find their great enemy in such a state, and
immediately cut off his head. His soldiers, deprived of their
leader, were soon put to the rout. Thus perished, by the
hand of an old woman, a captain famous for his exploits
against both Rome and Carthage, and whose victorious arms
had made Greece tremble more than once.

MESSINA.

A.C. 264.

The
power of the Romans had struggled during nearly
five hundred years against the peoples of Italy; and it was
not till after many and severe toils that they succeeded in
laying the foundations of an empire which was doomed to
embrace nearly the known universe. Rome, mistress of
those vast countries which extend from the Rubicon to the
southern extremity of Italy, became anxious to carry her
conquests abroad. She ventured to attack the forces of
Carthage, at that time the most flourishing republic in existence.
The union of the Carthaginians with Hiero, king
of Syracuse, for the destruction of the Messinians and the
siege of Messina, were the pretexts for the first war between
these two ambitious republics, whilst the conquest of Sicily
was the real object. Messina having placed itself under the
protection of Rome, Appius Claudius was ordered to march
to the succour of that oppressed city; but a strait of the
sea had to be crossed, and the Romans, without maritime
experience, had nothing but boats, rudely constructed, very
much resembling Indian canoes. Was it possible for such
a fleet to resist that of the Carthaginians, well equipped and
numerous, besides being accustomed to the domination of
the seas? Appius at once perceived his weakness; and yet
it was necessary that he should arrive at Messina quickly, as
the enemy was pressing it very closely. In this embarrassment,
the consul had recourse to an ingenious stratagem:
he pretended to endeavour to cross the strait, but seeming
to be terrified at the sight of the Carthaginians, he took to
flight suddenly, and feigned to abandon the enterprise. The
190

Carthaginians, fully persuaded that he would not return, but
was gone back to Rome, retired, as if there was nothing more
to be feared. Appius, taking advantage of this belief, crossed
the strait in the night-time, and arrived safely in Sicily. The
place at which he landed was close to the camp of the Syracusans;
and the consul exhorted his troops to fall at once
upon the enemy, promising them an easy victory;âin fact,
it proved so. The army of Hiero could not sustain the impetuous
shock of the Romans: it fled, and abandoned the
entrances of Messina to the conquerors. The consul was
received like a liberator from heaven; and the joy of the
citizens was the greater, from their having been in utter
despair. Appius, taking advantage of his victory, attacked
the camp of the Carthaginians; but he was repulsed with
some loss, and forced to retreat. He was pursued, which
was what he desired and expected; he faced about, and
fortune seemed to change with the situation of the place.
The Carthaginians could not stand against the courage of
the Romans, but took to flight in their turn, after losing
many men. And thus Rome commenced the first Punic
war.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1282.

Stung almost to madness by the celebrated Sicilian Vespers,
Charles of Anjou collected all the troops in his power,
set forward on his march, accompanied by an apostolic
legate, and invested Messina, which he pressed closely. The
unfortunate inhabitants, upon the point of having their city
carried by assault, offered to capitulate. They promised to
return to their duty, if the monarch would forget the past,
and engage not to give to the French either places or magistracy
in their city. Charles replied, that he intended to
govern as to him should seem best; and that, if they did not
promptly submit, they might prepare to be treated in the
same manner as they had treated the French. The Messinese,
irritated by this disheartening reply, swore that they
would rather devour their own children than become slaves
for ever. It was in vain that endeavours were made to bring
them back to a more prudent line of conduct; the most
terrible menaces were equally vain: they would listen to
nothing: they declared that it would be better to die like
191

brave men, than to be given up to the executioner like base
malefactors. Old men, women, and children, all took up
arms in the common cause. The king continued to press
the siege very warmly; but the Messinese, animated by a
generous despair, defended themselves with such heroic
valour, that they gave Don Pedro of Arragon time to come
to their succour. This prince, at the head of a fleet of fifty
galleys, which had for admiral Roger Doria, the greatest seaman
of his age, advanced into the strait of Messina, for
the purpose of carrying off the French fleet, which lay there
without defence. Charles, being informed of this project,
thought it evident he should be ruined if he continued the
siege; so he retreated without obtaining his revenge; but
he could not save his vessels, of which the enemy took
twenty-nine, and burnt thirty.

This war lasted many years, and was almost always unfortunate
for the house of Anjou, which was at length
obliged to share Sicily with that of Arragon, and to content
itself with Calabria, Apulia, the Terra di Lavoro, and the
Abruzzi, under the title of the kingdom of Naples.

We cannot leave the beautiful island of Sicily, where such
interesting sieges have detained us so long, without offering
our young readers a reflection upon the fate of that earthly
paradise. From the shores of the Mediterranean to the
summit of Etna, Sicily may be said to produce all that is
desirable in most of the climates of the earth, and that almost
spontaneously. But it is this spontaneity that we think
creates its misfortune: Providence neither favours countries,
nor limits its blessings to them, without countervailing checks
or advantages. Sicily, from the time of the tyrants of Syracuse,
under whom it was at least reckoned for something in the
world, has always been under the subjugation of foreigners:
successively enslaved by the Romans, the Vandals, the
Arabs, the Normans; under the vassalage of the popes, the
French, the Germans, and the Spaniards; always hating its
masters; revolting against them, without making any efforts
worthy of liberty; and continually exciting seditions, only
to change its chains;âsuch is the history of Sicily; and only
because it is one of the richest spots in the worldâis the
granary of the country that owns itâand produces this best
of all wealth, as we have said, almost spontaneously. Where
192

man is not constrained to gain his bread by the sweat of his
brow, he degenerates; the worst of passions are engendered
by idleness; and from the indulgence of them follows that
loss of self-respect which makes him indifferent to liberty,
careless of his rights, and the willing victim of the highest
bidder to his vices. It is a curious fact, but no less a fact,
that the most productive countries in the world are seldom
ruled over by the inhabitants indigenous to them.

CORINTH.

A.C. 244.

Antigonus
Deson, king of Macedon, had taken possession
of the isthmus and citadel of Corinth, which were called
the fetters of Greece, because he who was the master of
them dominated over that country. Aratus, chief of the
AchÃ¦ans, formed the project of depriving him of this important
place; and the following is the manner in which he had
the good fortune to succeed. Erginus, an inhabitant of
Corinth, having come to Sicyon, formed an intimacy with a
well-known banker, a friend of Aratus. In the course of
conversation, they happened to speak of the citadel of
Corinth, and Erginus said that, going to see his brother
Diocles, who was in garrison there, he had remarked, on the
steepest side, a little path, cut crosswise in the rock, which
led to a place where the wall was very low. The banker
asked him, with a laugh, if he and his brother had a mind
to make their fortunes? Erginus guessed what he meant,
and promised to sound his brother upon the subject. A few
days after he returned, and undertook to conduct Aratus to
the spot where the wall was not more than fifteen feet high,
and, with his brother, to aid him in the rest of the enterprise.
Aratus promised to give them sixty thousand crowns
if the affair succeeded; but the money must be deposited
with the banker, for the security of the two brothers, and as
Aratus had it not, and would not borrow it for fear of betraying
his secret, the generous AchÃ¦an took the greater part
193

of his gold and silver plate, with his wifeâs jewels, and
placed them in pledge with the banker, for the whole sum.
Several accidents delayed this noble enterprise; but nothing
daunted the intrepid defenders of liberty. When all was
ready, Aratus ordered his troops to pass the night under
arms, and taking with him four hundred picked men, the
most part of whom were ignorant of what they were going
to do, and who carried ladders with them, he led them
straight to the gates of the city, by the side of the walls of
the Temple of Juno. It was a beautiful moonlight night,
which made them justly fear they should be discovered.
Fortunately, there arose on the side towards the sea a thick
mist, which covered all the environs of the city, and created
a complete darkness. There all the troops sat down, and
took off their shoes, in order that they might make less noise
in marching, and might ascend the ladders better. In the
mean time, Aratus, with seven brave, determined young men,
equipped as travellers, slipped into the city without being
perceived, and in the first place killed the sentinel and the
guards on duty. They then applied their ladders to the
walls, and Aratus made a hundred of the most resolute
ascend with him, desiring the others to follow as best they
could. He drew up the ladders, descended into the city,
and, at the head of his troops, marched, full of joy, straight
towards the citadel, without being perceived. As they
advanced, they met a guard of four men, who carried a light.
The shade concealed the adventurers, and, crouching against
some walls, they waited for these soldiers, who, on passing
before the AchÃ¦ans, were attacked all at once. Three of them
lost their lives; the fourth, wounded by a sword in the
head, fled away crying that the enemy was in the city. A
moment after, all the trumpets sounded the alarm, and the
whole city was roused by the noise. The streets were soon
filled with people, who ran hither and thither; and were illuminated
by a multitude of flambeaux, which were lighted
everywhere, both down in the city, and upon the walls, the
ramparts, and the citadel. Aratus, without being dismayed,
held on his way, climbing, with difficulty, the steep sides of
the rocks, from having missed the path which led to the wall
in a winding, circuitous manner. But, as if by a miracle,
the clouds passed from before the moon, and revealed to
194

him the whole labyrinth, till he had gained the bottom of
the fortifications. Then, by a similar fortunate chance, the
clouds gathered again, and the moon being concealed,
replunged both besieged and besiegers into profound darkness.
The three hundred soldiers whom Aratus had left
without, near the Temple of Juno, having obtained entrance
into the city, which they found filled with confusion and
tumult, and not being able to find the path their leader
had taken, clung close to the foot of a precipice, under the
shadow of a great rock which concealed them, and waited in
that retired place to see how fortune should dispose of their
fate. The general of the AchÃ¦ans in the mean time was
fighting valiantly upon the ramparts of the citadel. They
heard the noise of this combat, but could not tell whence it
came, from the cries of the warriors being repeated a thousand
times by the surrounding echoes. The Macedonians
defended themselves with vigour: Archelaus, who commanded
for King Antigonus, thought to overwhelm the AchÃ¦ans by
charging them in the rear. He placed himself at the head
of a good body of troops, and, with sound of trumpet,
marched against Aratus, filing before the three hundred
concealed soldiers, without seeing them. The AchÃ¦ans
allowed him to pass on; then, rising all at once, as from an
ambuscade in which they had been placed on purpose, they
fell upon his party, killed many of them, put the rest to
flight, and came to the succour of their general, uttering
loud cries of victory. The moon once again shone forth in
its splendour, and by favour of its light, the soldiers of
Aratus united, and made so vigorous a charge that they
drove the enemy from the walls, and when the first rays of
the sun gleamed upon the citadel, it was as if to shed glory
upon their victory. The Corinthians flocked to the standard
of Aratus, who refused to sheath the sword till he had taken
prisoners all the soldiers of the king of Macedon, and thus
secured both his conquest and the liberty of Corinth.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 145.

The consul Mummius, having succeeded Metellus in the
command of the Roman troops, prosecuted the war against
the AchÃ¦ans with much vigour, and in order to subdue
195

them by one great effort, he laid siege to Corinth. This
city, in addition to its advantageous situation and its natural
strength, was defended by a numerous garrison, composed
of experienced and determined soldiers. These troops, perceiving
that a corps-de-garde was negligently kept, made a
sudden sortie, attacked it vigorously, killed a great many,
and pursued the rest to their camp. This trifling success
singularly inflamed the courage of these warriors, but it
became fatal to them; for DicÃ¦us, their leader, having rashly
given battle to the Romans, who feigned to dread his forces,
fell into an ambush laid by the consul, was beaten, took to
flight, and lost the greater part of his men. After this rout,
the inhabitants lost all hopes of defending themselves.
Without counsel, without a leader, without courage, without
concert, no citizen put himself forward to rally the wrecks
of the defeat, to make a show of resistance, and oblige the
conqueror, who wished to terminate the war quickly, to
grant them tolerable conditions. All the AchÃ¦ans, and
most of the Corinthians, abandoned, during the night, their
unfortunate country, and sought refuge in other lands.
Mummius entered the city without resistance, and gave it
up to pillage. The furious and greedy soldiery immolated
all who stood in the way of the sword, and bore away everything
that could feed their avarice. Women and children
were sold by auction, like flocks of sheep. Statues, pictures,
valuable furniture, all the superb ornaments of this opulent
city, were sent to adorn the proud capital of the universe.
The towers and walls were levelled with the ground; all the
houses were set fire to, and during several days the whole
city was nothing but one vast conflagration. It is pretended,
but perhaps without foundation, that the gold, silver, and
brass melted together in this fire, formed a new and precious
metal, whose name became proverbial as Corinthian brass.
It was in obedience to his masters, and not for his private
interest, that the conqueror acted in this manner. Mummius
was as disinterested a man as he was a great captain. To his
virtues he joined that warlike simplicity so common among
the Romans of his time, who made it their glory to be ignorant
of the arts of refinement, or indeed of anything which
did not relate to the great arts of defending their country
or fighting to promote its glory. He employed trustworthy
196

persons to transport several pictures and statues of the most
excellent masters to Rome. Had they been lost or injured,
nothing could have replaced them; and yet the consul,
whilst recommending care to be taken of them, said very
seriously that if these things were damaged, others must be
found in their place, and at the expense of those who undertook
to convey them!

The AchÃ¦an league was buried under the ruins of Corinth;
and Rome, always inexorable towards obstinate courage,
which preferred dangerous liberty to tranquil servitude,
reduced the whole of Achaia to a province.

TARENTUM.

A.C. 212.

Some
years after the entrance of Hannibal into Italy, the
Tarentines, an inconstant, fickle people, believing Rome
without resources, opened their gates to the Carthaginians;
but they could not force the citadel, which was held by a
Roman garrison. These soldiers kept the enemy at bay for
a length of time. Rome, having regained its superiority,
turned its attention to Tarentum, and resolved to punish it
for its infidelity. The consul Q. Fabius laid siege to it,
and found means to terminate his important enterprise very
speedily. Hannibal had placed in the city a body of
Brutians, the commander of whom was passionately in love
with a woman whose brother served in the army of the
consul. This brother, with the consent of his general,
threw himself into Tarentum, and, aided by the caresses of
his sister, gained the confidence of the officer. In a party
of pleasure, he prevailed upon him to deliver up to the
Romans the quarter of the city intrusted to his guard.
When measures were ready, the soldier made his escape and
informed Fabius of his success. The consul gave the concerted
signal to the Romans who defended the citadel, and
to the Brutians, and placed himself, with a chosen body of
197

troops, immediately opposite the place agreed upon. The
noise of trumpets and of loud cries issued at the same
moment from the citadel, the port, and the vessels at anchor.
The consul, concealed at his post, maintained a profound
silence. The general officer who guarded the quarter of the
city near which Fabius was in ambush, seeing all quiet,
thought he had nothing to fear, and flew towards the side
whence the tumult came. The consul perceiving this,
planted his ladders against that part of the wall where the
Brutian cohorts were posted, and entered quietly into the
city. He broke down the nearest gate, which gave access
to more troops, and advanced towards the public place. The
besieged defended themselves there for some time; but,
overwhelmed by numbers, they were obliged to disperse.
A great carnage ensued. Tarentum was pillaged; and, it
is said, eighty-seven thousand pounds weight of gold
rewarded the victors. Fabius had the wisdom to be satisfied
with the money and rich moveables; with the exception
of a single brazen statue from the hand of Lysippus, he let
the statues and pictures remain, using this memorable
expression: âLet us leave the voluptuous Tarentines their
angry gods, whom they have so ill served.â Had all
Roman generals followed the example of Fabius, and left
objects of luxury and indulgence to the peoples they had
corrupted, Rome would not, in its turn, have fallen a victim
to sensuality and the corruption employed to support it.

TUNIS.

A.C. 334.

The
mercenaries employed by Carthage for its defence
not receiving their pay, revolted, to the number of a hundred
thousand, and took possession of Tunis, of which they made
a place of arms. During three years they had great advantages
over the Carthaginians, and several times appeared
before the gates of Carthage, with a threat of besieging
it. At length Amilcar Barca was placed at the head of
the troops of the republic; and this general surprised the
198

army of the rebels, and besieged them in their camp. The
famine soon became so terrible, that they were constrained to
eat each other. After having suffered for a long time, they
gave up their leaders, who were put to death. Amilcar
afterwards marched straight to Tunis, where the rest of the
rebels were, under the command of a seditious chief named
Mathos. Tunis was carried, all the rebels were killed, and
Mathos, their leader, terminated by a shameful death a life
stained by barbarous cruelties.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1159.

Abdoulmoumen had rendered himself redoutable by his
victories, and the whole of northern Africa trembled before
this terrible and fortunate leader. Tunis alone was free;
it seemed to brave the conqueror, who threatened its ramparts.
The Arab monarch was anxious to subdue this
proud city. As, in order to approach it, it was necessary to
cross vast deserts, he gathered together great masses of
corn, which he caused to be buried in wells upon the route
he was to take. He left Morocco at the head of a hundred
thousand men, and summoned the governor to surrender. This
nobleman, faithful to the king of Sicily, his master, replied
by a vigorous sortie, in which the barbarians were repulsed.
This first success announced a continuation of triumphs;
but, in the night, seventeen of the principal inhabitants
escaped from the city, and offered to open the gates to
Abdoulmoumen. This infamous treachery rendered that
prince master of a place which might have defied all his
efforts.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1270.

The numberless disasters which accompanied the first
expedition of Louis IX. against the infidels had not at all
abated the ardour of that monarch, and he never laid down
the cross after his return from Palestine. The sad news
which he daily received from thence only served to inflame
his zeal the more; and at length, in 1270, he resolved to
make fresh efforts to liberate the Holy City, and the unfortunate
Christians it contained, from the yoke of the Mussulmans.
Most of his nobles were eager to accompany
199

their prince, the faithful Joinville being almost the only one
who refused to share the perils of his good lord and master.
He said, in full assembly, that the last Crusade had ruined
him; and that the king could not be advised to undertake
this new expedition, without his councillors incurring
mortal sin. The good seneschal was so weak and debilitated,
that he could not bear the weight of his harness or get on
horseback. The French army, consisting of sixty thousand
men, embarked at Aigues-Mortes, on the first of July.
They steered towards the coast of Barbary, where they
soon arrived.

On the western coast of Africa, opposite Sicily, is a
peninsula, whose circumference is about forty-two miles.
This peninsula advances into the sea between two gulfs, of
which the one on the west offers a commodious port. The
other, between the east and the south, communicates by a
canal with a lake which extends three leagues into the land,
and which modern geographers call the Gouletta. It was
there that stood the great rival of Rome, spreading itself to
the two shores of the sea. The conquests of the Romans,
the ravages even of the Vandals, had not utterly destroyed
the once proud city of Carthage; but in the seventh
century, after being invaded and desolated by the Saracens,
it became little more than a heap of ruins; a hamlet upon
the port, called Marsa, a tower on the point of the cape, a
tolerably strong castle upon the hill of Byrsa,âthis was
all that remained of that city whose power dominated so
long over the Mediterranean and the coasts of Asia and
Africa, and contended in three wars with Rome for empire
and glory.

At five leaguesâ distance from this remarkable site, towards
the south-east, a little beyond the Gouletta, stands Tunis, a
place so ancient that Scipio made himself master of it
before he attacked Carthage. At the time of Louisâ
invasion, Tunis was one of the most flourishing cities of
Africa. It contained ten thousand houses and three large
faubourgs; the spoils of nations, the produce of an immense
commerce had enriched it, and all that the art of fortification
could invent, had been employed in defending the access
to it.

At the sight of the Christian fleet, the inhabitants of the
200

coast of Africa were seized with terror, and all who dwelt
on the Carthage coast fled away either towards the mountains
or Tunis, abandoning several vessels in the port. The
officer sent by the king to reconnoitre, reported that there
was no living being on the strand or in the port, and that
no time was to be lost. But the king was made over-prudent
by the remembrance of past disasters, and it was
determined not to land till the morrow.

The next day, at dawn, the coast appeared covered with
Saracens, most of them on horseback. This did not at all
delay the landing of the Crusaders: at the approach of the
Christians, instead of opposing them, the multitude of
Saracens disappeared, which, for the former, was a most
fortunate circumstance, for, according to an eye-witness,
they were in such disorder that a hundred men might have
stopped the whole army.

When the army had landed, it was drawn up in order of
battle, and according to the laws of war, a herald read with
a loud voice a proclamation by which the conquerors took
possession of the territory. Louis himself had drawn up
this proclamation, which began with these words: âJe vous
dis le ban de notre Seigneur JÃ©sus Christ, et de Louis, roi
de France, son sergent.â

The baggage, provisions, and munitions of war were landed.
A vast inclosure was marked out, and the tents
were pitched. Whilst employed in the ditches and
intrenchments, to defend the army from a surprise, a party
was sent to take possession of the tower at the point of the
cape. The next day five hundred sailors planted the
standard of the lilies upon the castle of Carthage. The
hamlet of Marsa, which was close to the castle, falling at
the same time into the hands of the Crusaders, they sent
their women and children thither, and the army remained
under canvas.

Louis IX. had formed a strange idea that he could convert
the inhabitants of Tunis; but this pious illusion soon
faded away. The Mussulman prince replied to his proposal,
that he would come and meet him at the head of a hundred
thousand men, and would ask baptism of him on the field of
battle; the Moorish king added, that he had arrested all
the Christians residing in his states, and that every one
201

should be massacred if the Christian army dared to insult
his capital.

These bravadoes had no effect upon Louis; the Moors
inspired no terrors, and did not conceal their own fears at
the sight of the Crusaders. Never venturing to face their
enemy, their bands, sometimes scattered, hovered about the
Christian army, seeking to surprise wanderers from the
camp; and sometimes united, they fell upon the advanced
posts, launched a few arrows, just exhibited their naked
swords, and then relied upon the swiftness of their horses
for safety. They often had recourse to treachery: three of
them came to the Christian camp, and said they wished to
embrace the Christian faith; and a hundred others followed
them, expressing the same intention. They were received
with open arms; but, watching their opportunity, they fell,
sword in hand, upon some unguarded Frenchmen; but upon the
alarm being given, were surrounded, and most of them killed,
The three first comers threw themselves on their knees and
implored the compassion of the chiefs. The contempt such
enemies were held in obtained their pardon, and they were
kicked out of the camp.

Rendered bold by the inactivity of the Christian army,
the Mussulmans at length presented themselves several
times in the plains. Nothing would have been more easy
than to attack and conquer them, but Louis had resolved to
await the arrival of his brother, Charles of Anjou, before he
began the war: a fatal resolution, that ruined everything.
The Sicilian monarch, who had principally promoted this
ill-starred expedition, was doomed to complete by his delay
the evil he had commenced by his counsels.

So much time being afforded them, the Mussulmans
flocked from all parts of Africa to defend the cause of
Islamism. Thus the army of the Moors became formidable;
but it was not this crowd of Saracens that the Crusaders
had most to fear. Other dangers, other misfortunes threatened
them: the army wanted water; they had none but
salt provisions; the soldiers could not support the climate
of Africa; winds prevailed, which, coming from the torrid
zone, appeared to be accompanied by a devouring flame.
The Saracens on the neighbouring mountains stirred up the
sand with certain instruments, and the hot dust fell in
202

clouds upon the plain where the Christians were encamped.
At length dysentery, the malady of hot climates, attacked
them, and the plague, which seemed to spring up of itself
from the burning soil, spread its contagion among them.

The men were under arms night and day, not to defend
themselves against an enemy who always ran away, but to
avoid surprises. Most of the Crusaders sunk under the
awful combination of fatigue, famine, and sickness. Some
of the most renowned warriors of France fell a prey to the
one or the other. They could not bury the dead; the ditches
of the camp were filled with carcasses, thrown in
pÃªle-mÃªle
,
which added to the corruption of the air and the spectacle
of the general desolation.

Information was brought that the king of Sicily was about
to embark with his army. This gave great joy, but did not
mitigate the evils. The heats became insupportable; want
of water, bad food, the diseases, and chagrin at being shut
up in a camp without being allowed to fight, completed the
discouragement of both soldiers and leaders. Louis endeavoured
to animate them by his words and his example, but
he himself was seized with the dysentery. His sons, Prince
Philip, the duke de Nevers, and the king of Navarre, with
the legate, all experienced the effects of the contagion. The
duke de Nevers, who was much beloved by the king, was
so dangerously ill that he was transported on ship-board.
Louis was constantly asking news of his son, but his attendants
preserved a mournful silence. At length it was
announced to the king that his son was dead, and, notwithstanding
his piety and resignation, he was deeply affected.
A short time after the Popeâs legate died, much regretted
by the clergy and the soldiers of the cross, who looked upon
him as their spiritual father.

In spite of his sufferings, in spite of his griefs, Louis was
constantly engaged in the care of his army. He issued his
orders as long as he had strength, dividing his time between
the duties of a Christian and those of a monarch. At
length the fever increased; no longer able to attend to the
wants of the army, or even to exercises of piety, he had a
crucifix placed before him, and in silence implored the aid
of Him who had suffered for mankind.

DEATH OF LOUIS THE NINTH.

The whole army was in mourning; the commonest soldiers
moved about in tears; the prayers of all were offered up for
the preservation of so good a king. After giving most
pious and salutary advice to his son Philip, both as a man
and a king, and after taking an affectionate leave of his
family, this good, religious, and exemplary man, but most
mistaken monarch, expired at three oâclock in the evening
of the 25th of August, 1270.

On the very day of the death of Louis IX., his brother,
the duke of Anjou, landed with his army near Carthage.
The trumpets and instruments of war resounded on the
beach, but a solemn silence prevailed in the camp, and no
one went to meet the Sicilians, whom they had looked for
with so much impatience. Sad presentiments took possession
of Charles; he preceded his army, flew to the tent of
his brother, and found his body stretched upon its bed of
ashes. Charles prostrated himself at his feet, which he
bathed with his tears, calling upon him sometimes as his
brother, sometimes as his lord. He remained in this attitude
a long while, without heeding any of the persons who
surrounded him, constantly addressing Louis as if he were
living, and reproaching himself in accents of despair for not
having heard, for not having imbibed the last words of the
most affectionate of brothers, of the best of kings.

The death of Louis restored the confidence of the
Saracens; they took the mourning they observed in the
camp for discouragement, and flattered themselves with an
approaching triumph over their enemies. But their hopes
were of very short existence. During the sickness of Philip,
now king, Charles of Anjou took the command of the army,
and renewed the war with spirit. The soldiers he had
brought with him were eager for battle, the diseases became
less violent, and the Crusaders, so long confined to their
camp, revived at the idea of the perils of war. Several
battles were fought round the Lake of Gouletta, which it
was necessary for them to possess before they could invest
Tunis. The Moors, who only a few days before had threatened
the Christians with extermination or slavery, could
not stand for a moment the shock of the Christian chivalry;
not unfrequently the arbalisters were sufficient to disperse
innumerable multitudes. Horrible howlings, the noise of
drums and other loud instruments, announced their approach;
203

clouds of dust, pouring down from the neighbouring
heights, announced their retreat and concealed their flight.
In two rencontres, however, they were caught, and left a
great number of dead on the field. Another time their
camp was seized and plundered. The sovereign of Tunis
could not depend upon his army for the defence of his
states, and he himself gave no example of bravery or conduct
to his soldiers. He remained constantly in subterranean
grottos, to escape at once from the burning rays of
the sun and the perils of the fight. Pressed by his fears,
he saw no safety but in peace, and resolved to purchase it,
if at the expense of all his treasures. His ambassadors
came to the camp several times, charged with proposals, and
were directed particularly to endeavour to seduce the king
of Sicily. The Tunisian monarch was cunning and fortunate
in this idea; venality was the weak side of Charles, and the
other Crusaders were not immaculate in that respect. After
much debating in the Christian council, a truce for ten
years was signed, on the 31st of October, between the
leaders of the crusade and the king of Tunis. All prisoners
were to be restored on both sides, and all the Christians
previously in chains were to be set at liberty. The sovereign
of Tunis engaged not to require of the Franks any of the
duties imposed in his kingdom upon foreign commerce.
The treaty granted all Christians the faculty of residing in
the states of Tunis, with permission to build churches, and
even preach their faith. The Mussulman prince was to pay
an annual tribute of forty thousand golden crowns to the
king of Sicily, and two hundred and ten thousand ounces of
gold for the expenses of the war to the leaders of the
Christian army.

This was all in favour of the king of Sicily, and loud
murmurs soon arose in the army. But what must have
been the feelings of a real hero when he came amongst
them? By an agreement with Louis, Edward of England
was to take part in this expedition, and arrived in the camp
only a few days after the signing of the truce, with the
Crusaders of England and Scotland. The French and
Sicilians were prodigal in their demonstrations of welcome
and respect, and received him with great honours; but when
he learnt they had made such a disgraceful peace, he retired
205

to his tent, and refused to be present at any of the councils
of the Christian leaders.

The Crusaders became impatient to leave this arid and
unhealthy soil, and the army embarked for Sicily. But as
if this expedition was doomed to be unfortunate, a violent
tempest overtook the fleet when about to enter the port of
Trapani. Eighteen large ships and four thousand Crusaders
were submerged, and perished in the waves. Most of the
leaders lost their arms, their horses, and their equipments.
But as the crowning misfortune, and as if to point out the
will of Heaven in the case, the whole of the money paid by
the king of Tunis went to the bottom.

Of all this vaunted expedition, Edward of England was
the only leader who kept his word and followed up his purpose.
He went to Palestine in the spring, and, as every
reader of history knows, distinguished himself there greatly.
Edward I., when prince, may be said to have been the last
Crusader of royal rank who appeared in Palestine. Here
let me remark an inadvertency I was about to commit; I
wrote Edward, prince of Wales, whereas his son, Edward
of Caernarvon, was the first eldest son of our kings who
bore that title. This is a common error with us. Shakspeare
calls Louis, the father of Louis IX., dauphin when prince,
whereas that title did not belong to the sons of French
monarchs till more than a hundred years after Louisâ invasion
of England.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1535.

Muley-Hassan, king of Tunis, driven from his states by
Barbarossa, the terror of the Mediterranean, came to implore
the aid of Charles V. That prince, touched by the
prayers of the Barbary monarch, swore to replace him on
his throne. He assembled a fleet of three hundred ships,
on board of which were twenty-five thousand foot and two
thousand horse, set sail from Cagliari, and arrived at Porto-Farina,
formerly Utica. As that port was not very secure,
the fleet again weighed anchor, and brought to within
cannon-shot of the Gouletta. The whole Christian army
landed without the least opposition on the part of the
Mussulmans. The generals pitched their tents between
206

Carthage and the Water Tower, and surrounded it with
wide deep lines, fortified with redoubts. This was the
exact spot on which Louis IX. had formerly placed his
camp. The trenches were opened, and three batteries were
raised against the fortress. Whilst the place was being
cannonaded by land, the galleys advanced by turns and delivered
their broadsides; the grand caique of Malta and a
Portuguese galleon destroyed a part of the fortifications and
dismounted the batteries of the town. The place being
open in several places, it was determined to carry it by the
sword. The Christians mounted to the assault, forced the
breaches, gained the bulwarks and the top of the tower, and
took possession of them. Chasse-Diable, and Sinan the
Jew, leaders of the defenders of the Gouletta, being unable
to resist the imperial conquerors, retired into Tunis, where
their arrival spread terror and despair. The emperor entered
this fortress, followed by Muley-Hassan, to whom he said,
âThis is the door by which you will re-enter your states.â

Barbarossa was terrified at the successes of Charles V.
With the Gouletta he lost eighty-seven galleys, and more
than three hundred pieces of bronze ordnance, inclosed in
that citadel. He held a council with the Turks, and pointed
out to them the dangers to which they were exposed. They
had two enemies equally to fear,âthe inhabitants and the
Arabs, who detested their domination; the twenty-five
thousand Christian slaves in Tunis must necessarily be expected
to revolt, and open the gates to the Spaniards.
With regard to these slaves, he declared he was resolved to
put them all to death. Sinan the Jew represented to
Barbarossa that he would render himself odious to all
nations; that he would lose the ransom of the most considerable
of the slaves, and that he must not have recourse
to such a cruel measure till the last extremity. Barbarossa
consented to suspend the horrible project he had formed;
but he had the slaves loaded with fresh chains, shut them
up in the castle, and placed under them a number of barrels
of gunpowder. He passed the rest of the night in an agony
of fear and hope, and in expectation of the day which was
to decide his fate. He left Tunis the next morning, at the
head of eighty thousand men, and encamped in a plain a
full league from the city. The two armies were soon in
207

face of each other. The Arabs at first attacked the
Christians with great spirit; but scarcely had they sustained
the first discharge of the artillery, than they broke their
ranks, and drew with them the Moors, and even the Turks.
Barbarossa did his utmost to rally them, but they were deaf
to his voice, and only took counsel of the terror with which
they were seized. Barbarossa, trembling with rage, sounded
a retreat, rallied the fugitives, and passed the night under
arms beneath the walls of the city. Whilst he was deliberating
if he should go again and offer battle to the Christians,
or shut himself up in Tunis, some Turks came to inform
him that the slaves had broken their chains, and had made
themselves masters of the castle. Barbarossa hastened
thither, and was met by musket-shots and a shower of
stones. Transported with fury, he cried out that all was
lost, as the slaves were masters of the castle and of his
treasures. He immediately left Tunis at the head of a
body of Turks, and contrived to place himself in safety.

The emperor was ignorant of this revolution; on approaching
Tunis, he was informed of it by some Moors. In
an instant the imperialists dispersed themselves throughout
the city, massacred all who came in their way, carried off all
the women and children that were reserved for slavery, and
abandoned themselves to all the excesses which accompany
cruelty, avarice, and lubricity. The booty was so considerable,
that there was not a single soldier who did not make
his fortune. It is said that more than two hundred thousand
persons perished in the sack of this unfortunate city;
some expired under the sword of the conqueror; others,
thinking to avoid death by flight, met with it in the burning
sands of the deserts, where they died consumed by heat and
thirst.

The emperor, master of Tunis, re-established Muley-Hassan
on his throne; but that unfortunate prince did not enjoy it
long. Muly Hameda, his eldest son, tore the diadem from
his head; Hameda himself was deposed by his uncle Abdou-melek,
afterwards recalled by his subjects. After having gone
through these various changes, he reigned peaceably till the
year 1570, when Ulachali, dey of Algiers, one of the successors
of Barbarossa, took possession of the kingdom of
Tunis, which became nothing but a nest of pirates.

208

CARTHAGENA.

A.C. 216.

The
younger Scipio, charged with the prosecution of the
war in Spain, after the death of his father and his uncle,
evinced, from the early age of twenty-four, the wisdom and
prudence of a consummate captain. Anxious to weaken
Carthage, he undertook the siege of Carthagena, one of its
most important colonies. This strong city served the Carthaginians
at once as magazine, arsenal, and entrepÃ´t; they
kept within its walls the hostages which answered for the
fidelity of Spain. Scipio made all his preparations during
the winter; in the spring, he blockaded Carthagena with his
fleet, at the same time that he invested it by land. On the
day following, the armies, both by land and sea, commenced
hostilities. Scipio ordered his soldiers to mount to the
assault; and they executed his orders with ardour and celerity.
Mago, the brother of Hannibal, who commanded in
the place, had but a thousand soldiers, and thought himself
lost. He armed the citizens, picked out two thousand of
the best, and made a sortie. Victory was for a long time
doubtful; but the Carthaginians were driven back within
their walls. This first defeat would have produced the most
complete discouragement in Carthagena, if the Romans had
not been forced, by the height of the walls, to abandon the
escalade and sound a retreat. This untoward circumstance
restored hopes of succour to the besieged; but they were
not unacquainted with the activity of Scipio. Whilst the sea
was at ebb, he placed five hundred men with ladders along
the lake where the walls of Carthagena were lowest; he
surrounded these walls with fresh troops, and exhorted them
to fight like Romans. The ladders were applied, and the
soldiers shortly filled the whole extent of the walls. The
besieged, although astonished, kept a good face everywhere,
and defended themselves with courage. The sea retired,
209

and left the lake everywhere fordable. This phenomenon
seemed a marvel to the Romans; they hastened to climb
the walls of Carthagena, destitute on that point of defenders,
and penetrated into the city without meeting an
obstacle. The confused Carthaginians rushed to the citadel,
and the Romans entered with them. Mago and his troops
surrendered to Scipio, and the city was given up to pillage.
During this scene of horror, a young person of exquisite
beauty was brought to Scipio; her graces attracted the eyes
and admiration of all who were present. Scipio inquired
what were her origin and family; and he learnt that she was
affianced to Allucius, prince of the Celtiberians, who loved
her exceedingly.

He immediately sent for that prince, together with the
parents of the young beauty. As soon as Allucius arrived,
Scipio took him on one side, and said: âWe are both young;
which circumstance enables me to speak more freely to you.
My people who brought your affianced wife to me, told me
that you loved her tenderly; and her great beauty leaves me
no room to doubt that you do. Thereupon, reflecting that
if, like you, I were about to form an engagement, and were
not entirely occupied with the affairs of my country, I should
wish that so honourable and legitimate a purpose should
find favour; and I am extremely happy in the present conjuncture,
to be able to render you such a service. She
whom you are about to espouse has been among us as if she
had been in the house of her father and mother; I have
preserved her so as to make her a present worthy of you and
of me. The only gratitude I require for this inestimable
gift is, that you should become the friend of the Roman
people. If you deem me a man of worth, if I have appeared
so to the people of this province, be assured that there are
in Rome many far better than I, and that there does not
exist upon the earth a nation you ought more to dread as an
enemy or court as a friend than mine.â Allucius, penetrated
with joy and gratitude, kissed the hands of Scipio,
and implored the gods to bless him for such purity and
kindness. Scipio then sent for the parents of the lady, who
had brought a large sum of money for her ransom. When
they found that he had restored her without a ransom, they
conjured him to accept of that sum as a present, and declared
210

that that fresh favour would heighten their joy and satisfy
their gratitude. Scipio could not resist their earnest entreaties:
he accepted the gift, and ordered it to be laid at
his feet. Then, addressing Allucius, he said: âI add this
sum to the dowry you are to receive of your father-in-law,
and beg you to accept it as a nuptial present.â The young
prince, charmed with the virtue and generosity of Scipio,
published throughout his province the praises of so magnanimous
a conqueror. He said that a young hero had
come into Spain, who resembled the gods; for he subdued
all, more by the splendour of his virtues and his benefits,
than by the power of his arms. Having made levies in the
country he governed, he returned to Scipio some days after,
with fourteen hundred horsemen. To render the evidence
of his gratitude more durable, Allucius caused the noble
action of Scipio to be inscribed upon a silver shield, and
presented it to him,âa gift more glorious than any
triumph!

UTICA.

A.C. 203.

What
immortality do great men confer upon places by
noble actions! A vessel sailing along the northern coasts
of Africa, the curious traveller asks the name of a port, and
he is told it is Biserta. The information creates no sensation,
till, turning to his hand-book, he finds that that which
is now Biserta, was Utica! Then, mark the change! Scipio,
Cato, yea, even Joseph Addison, if he be an Englishman, all
rush upon his mind at once, and he would stop the ship in
her course, if it were possible, to allow him to contemplate
at leisure a spot rendered sacred by heroism, patriotism, and
genius!

Scipio Africanus having entered upon the country dominated
over by the Carthaginians, turned all his attention
towards Utica, with the purpose of making a place of arms
of it advantageous to his ulterior plans; he attacked it at
once, both by land and sea. Carthage exerted itself earnestly
211

to save a city which might be said to protect the
capital of its empire. Asdrubal raised a numerous body of
troops, and Syphax, king of Numidia, fixed his camp within
sight of that of the Roman general. The rival of Rome
flattered itself with the hope of soon putting Scipio to flight;
but that skilful captain quickly dispersed these smiling
expectations. He at once conceived the great project of
burning both camps; and this was the happy manner in
which he executed it. He amused Syphax with proposals for
an accommodation. A crowd of Roman officers disguised as
slaves went with the deputies into the enemyâs camps, to
observe the entrances and the places of issue, and to ascertain
what sort of watch was kept day and night. After
having taken measures and precautions according to the
information thus gained, he silently attacked the intrenchments
of the king of Numidia, in the obscurity of the night,
and the soldiers set fire to the barracks, covered with mats,
reeds, and dry wood. The whole camp appeared to be in a
blaze; and the Numidians and Carthaginians, thinking the
fire the effect of accident, were more intent at first upon
extinguishing it than upon defending themselves. Scipio
attacked the lines of Asdrubal, whilst the flames were consuming
those of Syphax. The enemies who were occupied
in suppressing the fire, were put to the sword; forty thousand
men were left dead upon the spot, and seven thousand
were reserved for slavery. The news of this defeat spread
consternation amongst the Carthaginians. Asdrubal and
Syphax raised fresh troops, whilst the Roman general pressed
the siege of Utica. This second army obliged him to suspend
his attacks; but another victory, more glorious than
the first, maintained the reputation of the Roman general.
Carthage, in despair, recalled Hannibal,âits only and last
resource. The arrival of this great man entirely suspended
the siege of Utica; but his defeat by Scipio terminated the
war.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 46.

CÃ¦sar, conqueror at Thapsus, pursued Scipio into Utica,
and invested it. This city would not have fallen an easy
conquest, if Cato, who had shut himself up in it, together
with most of the senators opposed to tyranny, had found in
212

all hearts a courage and a patriotism equal to his own. In
vain this noble Roman endeavoured to awaken in those
around him the sublime sentiments which had animated the
early citizens of Rome; in vain he went through the streets
to calm the alarms of the people,âthe dread of the conqueror
closed all ears against his exhortations: love of country had
given place to love of life. Despairing then of defending
Rome by defending Utica, he gave his whole care to the
preservation of the senators, the companions of his misfortunes,
whom the inhabitants wished to give up to CÃ¦sar.
When he had taken all the necessary precautions, he prepared
to terminate his days in a manner worthy of himself.
Some of his friends exhorted him to have recourse to the
clemency of the dictator. âHe who is conquered,â said he,
âmay servilely flatter the hand which has subdued him.
Cato is invincible; he acknowledges neither master nor conqueror.â
He then assembled his friends, and, after a long
conversation upon the state of affairs, he strictly forbade his
son ever to take any part in the government. âYou cannot
do so,â said he, âin a manner worthy of the name you
bear; and to do it in any other way, would be to cover
yourself with eternal ignominy.â He then took a bath, and
whilst in it, remembered Statilius, his friend, who had refused
to escape with the other senators. He had charged
the philosopher Apollonius to persuade him to save himself.
âHave you succeeded with Statilius,â said he,ââcan he
have gone without bidding me farewell?â âHe! no,â
replied the philosopher; âhe is intractable: he declares he
will positively remain here, and imitate you in everything.â
âIt will soon,â replied Cato, with a smile, âbe seen how
that will be.â After his bath, he gave a magnificent banquet
to all his friends and the magistrates of Utica. They
sat long at table, and the conversation was animated, lively,
and learned, chiefly turning upon points of moral philosophy.
Demetrius, a Peripatetic philosopher, undertook to refute,
after the principles of his sect, the two Stoic paradoxes:
âThe wise alone are free; all the vicious are slaves.â But
Cato replied to him with a fire, a vehemence, and in a tone
of voice which betrayed his intentions, and changed the suspicions
his friends had entertained into certainty. All at
once, a dismal silence prevailed; sadness was painted in
213

every countenance, and no one durst venture to raise his
tear-dewed eyes towards Cato. This tender friend perceived
the effect his rigid philosophy had produced; he changed the
subject, and, to drive away melancholy ideas, he spoke of
those who had just left them, showing the anxious inquietude
he experienced respecting them. After the repast, he walked
about for some time, according to his usual custom, and then
retired to his apartment. There he spoke more affectionately
than he had before done, to his son and his friends, which
revived and strengthened the idea they had conceived of his
determination. When he went into his inner chamber, he
threw himself upon the bed, and meditated for a long time
upon Platoâs dialogue on the immortality of the soul. He
had already read a considerable part of it, when, turning his
eyes upon his bolster, he perceived that his sword was not
in its customary place; his son had had it removed whilst
they were at supper. Cato called to a slave, and asked him
what had become of his sword. The slave made no answer,
and his master resumed his reading. A few minutes after;
he made the same question, without any eagerness or warmth,
but like a man who has no particular desire. At last, when
he had finished his reading, seeing that nobody seemed disposed
to obey him, he called all his slaves, one after the
other, and in the tone of a master, said that he insisted upon
having his sword; he even went so far as to give one of them
so violent a blow, that he made his hand bloody. âWhat!â
cried he, indignantly, âwhat! are my son and my people
conspiring to deliver me up to my enemy, without arms and
without defence?â At this moment, his son, coming into
the apartment with his friends, burst into tears. He threw
himself at his feet, he embraced his knees, and conjured him
to depart from his purpose. Cato, angry at seeing his son
in such an attitude of supplication, and darting at him
glances denoting displeasure,ââSince when,â cried he, âam
I fallen into imbecility, to make it necessary for my son to be
my curator? I am treated like an insane man; I am not
allowed to dispose of my own person; I am to be disarmed
too! Brave and generous son, why do you not chain up
your father till CÃ¦sar arrives, so that that enemy of his
country may find him destitute of defence? Do I stand in
need of a sword, if I wished to deprive myself of life? Could
214

I not hold my breath? could I not dash my head against
the wall? If a man really wish for death, there are a thousand
ways of obtaining it.â A young slave then brought
him back his sword. Cato drew it, examined it, and finding
that the point was quite straight and sharp, he exclaimed,ââNow,
then, I am my own master.â He laid down his
sword, took up his book, and read it through again from
beginning to end; he then fell into so profound a sleep, that
the anxious friends who listened at the door heard him
snore; but the fatal moment approached. Cato called for
his freed-man, and asked him if all was quiet; and when he
was assured that it was, he threw himself upon the bed as
if to take his repose for the night; but the moment he was
left alone, he plunged the sword into his body a little below
the breast. The blow did not kill him at once; he struggled
a little, and fell off the bed on to the ground. At the noise
of his fall, his people rushed in, and, as he still breathed, his
surgeon bound up the wound. But the instant he recovered
his senses, he tore away the bandages, and with them
dragged out his bowels, and expired. âOh, Cato!â cried
CÃ¦sar, when he heard of his noble end, âI envy thee the
glory of thy death, since thou hast envied me that of sparing
thy life.â And he entered triumphantly into Utica.

Without entering into the question of suicide in general,
or that which would lead to a much longer digression than
we can afford,âthe strange mania for self-destruction which
possessed the Romans of this age,âwe cannot help observing
that this celebrated death of Cato reads more like a dramatic
scene than a reality. Why, if his son and his friends had
been in earnest, when they knew of his intention, they ought
to have bound him, hand and foot, and never have left him
alone a minute. The manâs mind was weakened with
trouble, and he ought to have been treated like a maniac.
Such is the modern, or common sense view of the case; but
the noblest of the Romans thought far otherwise. Stoicism,
the favourite philosophy of the day, taught them to despise
life without honour and freedom; and there must have been
something exalted in this creed, for, whilst we constantly
find great public men, for public reasons, laying violent
hands upon themselves, we do not learn that the practice
extended to persons affected by disappointed passions, or
215

suffering under private calamities. We called it a maniaâwhen
we glance at this one point of history, it can be called
nothing else: Cato, Brutus, Cassius, Antony, Cleopatra,
Porcia, all playing in one short scene of the great drama;
all contemporaries, and acted upon, in some way, by each
other, all destroyed themselves, and all without a common-sense
reason for doing so.

ABYDOS.

A.C. 201.

We
now come to a siege which, from being unconnected
with any rise or fall of empires, or being made or resisted
by any extraordinary personages, may be passed by without
particular notice by many readers of history; and yet what
horrors are crowded into this short scene; what a picture
it presents for human nature to shudder at!

Philip, king of Macedon, father of Perseus, who proved
last monarch of that country, was at war with the Rhodians.
The inhabitants of Abydos made common cause with that
commercial people, who often came to visit the shores of the
Dardanelles. Philip was successful in his passage through
Thrace and the Chersonesus, where many cities surrendered
to his arms, but Abydos shut its gates against him, and prepared
for a bold resistance. We need not, in our time, go
into any description of the situation of this city: the East
is now more familiar to the inhabitants of central England
than Cornwall or the isles of Scotland. But Abydos was
of more importance in the days of Philip than now; the
Dardanelles may still be of consequence as keys to the
straits, but this was then a wealthy commercial city and
entrepÃ´t. Nothing of what is usually practised in such
warlike proceedings was omitted in this siege. No place
was ever defended with more bravery; but this bravery, in
the end, degenerated into brutality and fury. Confiding in
their own strength, the Abydenians repulsed the first
attacks of the Macedonians with the greatest vigour. On
216

the side next the sea, the machines no sooner came forward
than they were immediately either dismounted by the balistÃ¦
or consumed by fire. Even the ships on which they were
mounted were in danger, and were saved with difficulty.
On the land side they also defended themselves for some
time with great courage, and did not despair even of defeating
the enemy. But, finding that the outer wall was
sapped, and that the Macedonians were carrying their mines
under the inner one, they sent deputies to Philip, offering
to surrender upon the following terms:âThat such forces
as had been sent to them by the Rhodians and King Attalus
should return to their respective sovereigns, under his safe
conduct; and that all free citizens should retire whithersoever
they pleased, with the clothes they had then on. Philip
answered coolly, that the Abydenians had only to choose
whether they would surrender at discretion, or continue to
defend themselves bravely. This report being made by the
deputies, the besieged, in transports of despair, assembled to
debate what was best to be done. They came to the following
resolutions:âFirst, that the slaves should be all set
free, to animate them to defend the city; secondly, that all
the women should be shut up in the Temple of Diana, and
all the children, with their nurses, in the Gymnasium; that
they should bring into the great square all the gold and
silver in the city, and carry all the rest of the valuable effects
to the vessels of the Rhodians and the Cyzicenians. These
resolutions having passed unanimously, another assembly
was called, in which they chose fifty of the wisest and most
ancient of the citizens, but who at the same time had vigour
enough left to execute what might be determined on; and
they were made to take an oath, in presence of all the inhabitants,
that the instant they saw the enemy master of the
inner wall, they would kill the women and children, set fire
to the galleys laden with their effects, and throw into the
sea all their gold and silver, which they had heaped together:
then, sending for their priests, they took an oath either to
conquer or die, sword in hand; and, after having sacrificed
the victims, they obliged the priests and priestesses to pronounce
before the altar the greatest curses on those who
should break their oath. This being done, they left off
countermining, and resolved, the instant the wall should fall,
217

to fly to the breach, and to fight till the last. Accordingly,
the inward wall tumbling down, the besieged, true to the
oath they had taken, fought in the breach with such unparalleled
bravery, that, though Philip had perpetually sustained
with fresh soldiers those who had mounted to the assault,
yet, when night separated the combatants, he was still
doubtful with regard to the success of the siege. Such Abydenians
as marched first to the breach, over heaps of slain,
fought with fury, and not only made use of their swords and
javelins, but after their arms were broken to pieces, or forced
out of their hands, they rushed headlong upon the Macedonians,
knocked some down, and broke the long spears of
others, and with the pieces struck their faces and such parts
of their bodies as were uncovered, till they made them absolutely
despair of the event. When night put an end to the
slaughter, the breach was quite covered with the dead bodies
of the Abydenians; and those who had escaped were so
overwhelmed with fatigue, and had received so many wounds,
that they could hardly support themselves. Things being
come to this dreadful extremity, two of the principal citizens,
being unable to bring themselves to execute the awful task
they had undertaken, and which now came before them as a
horrid reality, agreed that, to save their wives and children,
they should send to Philip by daybreak all their priests
and priestesses, clothed in their pontifical habits, to implore
his mercy, and open the gates to him. Accordingly, next
morning, the city was surrendered to Philip, whilst the
greatest part of the Abydenians who survived vented millions
of imprecations against their two fellow-citizens, but more
particularly against the priests and priestesses for delivering
up to the enemy those whom themselves had devoted to death
with the most solemn oaths. Philip marched into the city,
and seized, without opposition, all the rich effects which the
Abydenians had collected together. But now he beheld a
spectacle which might have terrified even an ambitious
monarch or a conqueror. Among these ill-fated citizens,
whom despair had made furious and distracted, some were
smothering their wives and children, and others stabbing
them with their own hands; some were running after them
to strangle them, others were plunging them into wells,
whilst again others were precipitating them from the tops
218

of houses; in a word, death appeared in all its variety of
terrors. Philip, penetrated with horror and grief at this
spectacle, stopped the soldiers, who were eager to plunder,
and published the strange declaration that he would allow
three days to all who were resolved to lay violent hands on
themselves. He was in hopes that in that interval they
would change their determination: but their resolution was
fixed. They thought it would be degenerating from those
who had lost their lives in defending their country, if they
should survive them. The individuals of every family killed
one another, and none escaped this murderous sacrifice but
a few whose hands were tied, or were otherwise kept, by
force, from destroying themselves. And Philip, during the
three days, satisfied his ideas of humanity by refraining from
plundering the city he saw burning, and by beholding a
people destroy each other, whom he might have saved with
a word!

CREMONA.

A.C. 200.

A
numerous army of Gauls laid siege to Cremona. The
prÃ¦tor Lucius Furius marched to the succour of the allies of
the Romans, in the absence of the consul. He gave battle
the moment he arrived. The Gauls fought bravely, but at
length took to flight, and retired in disorder to their camp.
The Romans followed them thither, attacked the camp, and
took it. Out of thirty-five thousand combatants, scarcely
six thousand were saved. Eighty standards and two hundred
chariots filled with booty were the trophies and the
ornaments of this triumph. Amilcar, a Carthaginian general,
who had joined the barbarians, fell in this engagement,
together with three of the most distinguished Gaulish
leaders.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 69.

Vespasian was just raised to the empire, but he still had
to tear the diadem from the brow of the barbarous Vitellius,
219

and maintain the choice of the legions with the sword. The
new emperor sent Primus, one of his lieutenants, and a very
skilful general, against the tyrant of Rome. After several
advantages, Primus attacked two legions posted before
Cremona. The Roman legions fought against each other
like the most determined enemies. Primus was near losing
the battle; but his courage rallied his troops when on the
point of giving way, he brought them back to the charge,
and gained a complete victory. His army was eager to enter
Cremona, but was prevented by the arrival of six legions of
the opposite party. A fresh nocturnal combat instantly
ensued between the victorious soldiers and their newly-arrived
enemies. Success was doubtful; in the obscurity of
night, address and courage were equally useless; they
slaughtered each other indiscriminately,âtheir blows fell as
frequently upon their friends as upon their foes. At length,
however, the moon shed her beams over the bloody scene,
and gave a more certain direction to the fury of the combatants;
the troops of Primus had this friendly light at
their backs. In this situation, the legions opposed to them,
deceived by the shade, aimed their arrows badly, and shot
them short of the mark. Primus profiting by this advantage,
encouraged his soldiers, redoubled his exertions, and
added the prudence of a consummate captain to the bravery
of an enterprising soldier. Nothing could resist him; his
enemies fled before him; and Primus was victor a second
time. This carnage was signalized by one of those tragical
events which are only met with in civil wars: a son killed
his own father without knowing him; he recognised him as
he was expiring, and, transported with grief, he gave himself
up to despair, cursing the war which had made him an involuntary
parricide. The victorious troops were indefatigable;
believing that nothing was done till all was done,
they attacked and carried the camp which surrounded Cremona.
This place must have fallen into their hands, and
the inhabitants surrendered, in the hopes of meriting some
clemency by a prompt and voluntary submission; but they
were deceivedâthe greedy legions would not be disappointed
of their booty. Cremona was pillaged, its walls were razed,
its citizens were slaughtered, its edifices were burnt, and
the city was almost entirely destroyed by troops which ought
220

to have respected the ancient allies of the Roman people and
the citizens of the same empire.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1702.

Cremona was besieged in 1702, by Prince Eugene.
Marshal de Villeroi was at the time within the walls. Son
of the governor of Louis XIV., Villeroi had always enjoyed
the favour of the monarch. He was of very imposing and
agreeable person, exceedingly brave, a worthy man, magnificent
in everything he undertookâbut no general. He was a
courtier, and Louis and Madame de Maintenon had the
weakness to send him against some of the best generals the
world ever saw. Prince Eugene, who had beaten him at
Chiari, still maintained his superiority over him. At length,
in the depth of winter, whilst the marshal was one day
comfortably asleep in Cremona, a city sufficiently strong,
and provided with a good garrison, he was awakened by a
discharge of musketry; he arose in all haste, and was
quickly on horseback. The first thing he met was a
squadron of the enemy, by whom he was in an instant
brought to the ground. A German officer, judging by his
uniform that he was a general, made him his prisoner. As
soon as he was on his feet he whispered to the officer, âI
am the Marshal de Villeroi; I will give you ten thousand
pistoles, and the command of a regiment, if you will conduct
me to the citadel.â âI have for a long time,â replied the
officer, âserved the emperor, my master, and I will not
begin betraying him to-day.â He led him to the most
remote
corps-de-garde
. The Marquis de Crenan, a lieutenant-general,
was mortally wounded close to the marshal. Villeroi,
a prisoner, showed great regret at not being free, and declared
that he envied him his fate. He was immediately
taken out of the city, without knowing what was going on
there.

Prince Eugene was already in Cremona. A priest, named
Cassoli, the prevÃ´t of Sainte-Marie-la-Neuve, had introduced
the Germans by a sewer. Four hundred soldiers, by means
of this sewer, had gained the house of the priest, and had
immediately killed the guards of two of the gates. Prince
Eugene then entered with four thousand men. And all
221

this had been done without the Spanish governor having the
least suspicion, and before Marshal de Villeroi was awake.
The secrecy, order, diligence, and all the possible precautions
which distinguish an able commander, had secured the success
of the enterprise. The Spanish governor showed himself in
the streets at the head of a few soldiers, but was speedily
killed by a musket-shot. All the general officers were either
killed or taken, with the exception of the Count de Revel
and the Marquis de Praslin. And yet the prudence of
Prince Eugene was confounded. The Chevalier dâEntragues
was that day to review, in the city, the royal regiment of
the marine, of which he was colonel. These soldiers were
already assembled at one extremity of the city, precisely
at the moment Prince Eugene entered by the other.
DâEntragues began by hastily scouring through the streets
with his soldiers, and resisting all the Germans he met with,
which gave time for the rest of the garrison to come up.
Officers and soldiers,
pÃªle-mÃªle
, some badly armed, and some
half-naked, without commanders, without order, filled the
streets and public places, fought in confusion, or intrenched
themselves from street to street, or from place to place.
Two Irish regiments, which formed part of the garrison,
stopped the efforts of the Imperialists. Never was city
surprised with more art and prudence, and never was one
better defended by courage and promptness. The garrison
consisted of five thousand men; Prince Eugene had not
introduced more than four thousand. A large detachment
of his army was expected to arrive by the bridge over the
Po; his measures were well taken, but another event
deranged them all. The bridge over the Po, badly guarded
by a hundred French soldiers, was to be seized by the
German cuirassiers. At the instant Prince Eugene entered
the city, it became necessary that as the cuirassiers had
entered by the southern gate, near to the sewer, they should
go out of Cremona immediately at the north, by the gate of
the Po, and should hasten to the bridge. They went thither,
but the guide who conducted them was killed by a musket-shot
from a window, and the cuirassiers mistook one street
for another, which made their passage much longer. In
this short interval the Irish threw themselves into the gate
of the Po, and fought and repulsed the cuirassiers. This
222

resistance at first perplexed Prince Eugene. He sent
Macdonald, one of their compatriots, to them, who had
been the first man that entered the city. âSir,â said he,
addressing the commanding officer, âPrince Eugene has
sent me here to say, that if you are willing to change your
party, and come over to that of the Imperialists, he will
promise you better pay and more considerable pensions than
you have in the French service. The affection I bear for
all persons of my nation, and for you, sir, in particular,
obliges me to exhort you to accept the offers I make you
from this general; if you refuse, I do not see how you are
to escape certain destruction. With the exception of your
solitary post, we are masters of the whole city; and this is
why his highness only waits for my return to attack you
with the greatest part of his forces, and cut you to pieces.â
âSir,â replied the commander, âif his highness waits your
return to attack us and cut us to pieces, he is not likely to
do so very quickly; for I arrest you as a prisoner, not considering
you the envoy of a great general, but as a suborner.
It is by such conduct we would merit the esteem of the
prince who sent you, and not by a treachery unworthy of a
man of honour.â At these words the combat was renewed
with fresh fury. Eugene finding Macdonald did not return,
at once comprehended that he was arrested; and being unwilling
to resort to force, he conceived another stratagem to
make them lay down their arms. He went to Marshal
Villeroi: âYou have passed through the city, monsieur,â
said he, âand you must have remarked that we are masters
of it. There are still some of your tirailleurs firing from
the ramparts; if that continues, they will oblige me to put
them all to the sword: order them to surrender.â The
marshal easily perceived that the princeâs affairs were not
going on so well as he could wish, and only coolly repliedââI
have the misfortune not to be at liberty, and therefore
can order nothing.â Eugene made a fresh attempt upon
the Irish, who still opposed a wall of fire and steel to the
Germans. The Baron de Freibourg was charged with this
attack. Mahoney, commanding a battalion of Dillon, seized
the bridle of this officerâs horse, exclaiming, âGood quarter
for M. de Freibourg.â But the latter, looking at him with
contempt, replied, âThis is not a day for clemency; do
223

your duty, and I will do mine.â He spoke, and a discharge
of musketry stretched him dead on the pavement. The
Marquis de Praslin, during this engagement, broke down
the bridge over the Po, so that the Germans could not
obtain the succours they looked for, and the city was saved.
Prince Eugene, after fighting all day, being still master of
the gate by which he had entered, at length retired, taking
with him Marshal Villeroi and several officers prisoners, but
having missed Cremona. His activity and prudence had
given him the place, but the valour of the Irish and the
French prevented his keeping it.

In the revolutionary war, Cremona was three times an
object of attack and defence, but had no siege sufficiently
interesting to claim a place in our pages.

CARTHAGE.

A.C. 146.

The
siege of Carthage seemed to seal the fate of that
great and ambitious republic. Whilst we have had to
record so many sieges of Rome, we have only one to
describe of her great rival, and that closed the career of
that rival. Proud, wealthy, and, as the Romans would add,

false
Carthage, was never annoyed by the invasion of her
capital, till Rome had so risen in the ascendant that
Carthage must necessarily sink: and then she did sink, like
a tropical sun, without twilight. Whether it is with the
great captain, Hannibal, or with the powerful nation to
which he did so much honour, that our sympathies are attached,
we cannot say, but we acknowledge to feeling a
greater interest for the Carthaginians throughout all the
Punic wars than we do for the Romans. Besides, Carthage
has no native historians, it was blotted from the map of
nations, and we have reason to receive with suspicion much
that the Latin, or even the Greek writersâfor Carthage was
generally at variance with Greeceâmay say on the subject
of âPunica fides.â

224

Before we commence this memorable siege, it will be well
to give our readers a short account of what Carthage was
at this period. At the beginning of the war, Carthage contained
seven hundred thousand inhabitants. It stood at
the bottom of a gulf, surrounded by the sea, and in the form
of a peninsula, whose neck,âthat is, the isthmus which
joined it to the continent,âwas twenty-five stadia, or a
league and a quarter, in breadth. The peninsula was three
hundred and sixty stadia, or eighteen leagues round. On
the west side there projected from it a long strip of land,
half a stadium, or twelve fathoms, broad, which, advancing
into the sea, divided it from a morass, and was fenced on all
sides with rocks and a single wall. On the south side,
towards the continent, where stood the citadel called Byrsa,
the city was surrounded with a triple wall thirty cubits
high, exclusive of the parapets and towers, with which it
was flanked all round at equal distances, each interval being
fourscore fathoms. Every tower was four stories high, and
the stalls but two; they were arched, and in the lower part
were stalls to hold three hundred elephants, with their
fodder; and over these were stables for four thousand
horses, and lofts for their food. There likewise was room
enough to lodge twenty thousand foot and four thousand
horse. All these were contained within the walls alone.
In one place only the walls were weak and low, and that
was a neglected angle, which began at the neck of land
above mentioned, and extended as far as the harbours, which
were on the west side. Of these there were two, which
communicated with each other, but had only one entrance,
seventy feet broad, shut up with chains: the first was
appropriated to the merchants, and had several distinct
habitations for the seamen; the second, or inner harbour,
was for ships of war, in the midst of which stood an island,
called Cothon, lined, as the harbours were, with large quays,
in which were distinct receptacles for sheltering from the
weather two hundred and twenty ships. Over these were
magazines or storehouses, wherein was lodged everything
necessary for arming and equipping fleets. The entrance to
each of these receptacles was adorned with two marble
pillars of the Ionic order; so that both the harbour and the
island represented on each side two magnificent galleries.
225

In the island was the admiralâs palace; and as it stood opposite
to the mouth of the harbour, he could thence discover
whatever was doing at sea, though no one could see
what was being transacted in the inward parts of the
harbour. The merchants, in like manner, had no prospect
of the men-of-war, the two ports being separated by a
double wall, each having a particular gate that led to the
city, without passing through the other harbour. So that
Carthage may be divided into three parts: the harbour,
which was double, and was called Cothon, from the little
island of that name; the citadel, named Byrsa; and the city
properly so called, where the inhabitants dwelt, which lay
round the citadel, and was called Megara.

The existence of Carthage constantly reminded the Romans
of the fatal days of CannÃ¦ and Thrasymenus; Rome
dreaded to see her rival rise again from the state of humiliation
to which her arms had reduced her. To free themselves
from all apprehension for the future, the senate determined
to annihilate Carthage, and sent thither a formidable army,
under the command of the two consuls. In this circumstance,
we find one of the most striking instances of political
expediency overpowering the sense of justice in a great
mind. Cato the Censor, a wise, good, and just man, was the
principal promoter of this infamous infraction of the rights
of nations and humanity. To judge of Cato by all the other
parts of his character, we might as well expect to see
FÃ©nelon presiding over an
auto-da-fÃ¨
, as to find the great
censor constantly urging the necessity for the destruction of
Carthage.

At the approach of the Romans, the Carthaginians sent
out deputies to offer to give up to the great republic, themselves
and all that belonged to them. Hannibal, it is true,
had long been dead; but one would think his very remembrance
would have stimulated such a populous nation to
some show of resistance to the tyranny of a people they had
more than once beaten. Hostages and all their arms were
demanded as proofs of their submission. This severe order was
complied with: a long train of chariots arrived at the Roman
camp, bearing an immense quantity of arms and machines of
war. The most respectable old men of the senate of Carthage,
with the most venerable priests, followed this melancholy
226

cortÃ¨ge
, to endeavour to excite compassion. âI praise
your promptitude,â said Censorinus, one of the consuls;
âand the senate now commands you to leave Carthage, which
it is determined to destroy, and to remove your abode whithersoever
it may please you, provided it be four leagues
from the sea-shore.â This was a clap of thunder for the
deputies. In vain they endeavoured to soften the Romans
by their prayers and tears; they were forced to carry this
terrible reply back to Carthage. At this news, despair and
rage possessed the citizens, and it was resolved to sacrifice
everything for the defence of their country. Asdrubal had
the command of the troops, and every expedition was employed
to fabricate new arms and machines. Temples,
palaces, and all public places became so many workshops;
men, women, children, and the aged worked in them day
and night. Grave historians say that hemp for the manufacture
of ropes being deficient, the women cut off their hair
and supplied a substitute in abundance. But we consider
this to be one of the pleasing âliesâ of history. If we
calculate how many of our fair damsels must be shorn of
this their principal ornament to make one cable, we may
judge of the probability of the story. During two years, the
Romans made but little progress; they even experienced
several checks and losses. It seemed to require another
Scipio to terminate the wars in which the heroes of his
family had been so successful. No name is more honoured in
Roman history than that of Scipio; and our young readers
must be particularly careful not to confound the various
persons who bore it with one another; for there were many
Romans, and most of them of superior character, who were
honoured with it. The real family name was Cornelius,
and the addition Scipio was what we should now call a
sobriquet, or nickname, given to the first so called for serving
as a staff to his blind father; Scipio being the Latin for
a walking-stick. Many boasted names and titles have a less
honourable source. This Scipio was, of course, not the conqueror
of Hannibal; he is therefore termed Scipio Africanus
the younger. He was the son of the great Paulus
Ãmilius, the conqueror of Perseus, and was adopted by the
son of the first Scipio Africanus, and called Scipio Ãmilianus,
according to the laws of adoption. The two families, by
227

marriages and adoptions, were almost one. Scipio Africanus
the younger is one of the finest characters of antiquity; and
if the reputation of Polybius the historian were not fully
established for its truthfulness, we might almost suspect the
picture we have of it to be too favourable. But really great
historical characters escape from the charge of partiality in
their biographers by means of their actions; history tells us
how they affected the periods at which they lived, and either
bears out or contradicts the record of the individuals. Where
there are several persons in remote history of one name,
their conspicuous actions are not unfrequently all given to
one. There were many Hercules, but all their labours are laid
upon the broad shoulders of one of them: so with the Scipios:
the younger Africanus is such a favourite with ancient
writers, that modern readers sometimes confound him with
his senior of that name. We shall only observe, that though
quite capable of such an action, it was not he who restored
Allucius his beautiful bride.

Scipio, being proclaimed consul, immediately took the
command of the army before Carthage. He found everything
in disorder; discipline was relaxed, and luxury of every
kind was indulged in. These evils were his first care; but
these he speedily cured by the best of all possible means,âthe
example of his own attention to his duties, and his temperate
mode of living.

As soon as that first of military requisites, discipline, was
re-established, he at once proceeded to action. Having ordered
his troops to provide themselves with axes, levers, and scaling-ladders,
he led them, in the dead of the night and without
noise, to the district of the city called Megara, where,
commanding them to give a sudden and general shout, he
commenced the attack with great vigour. Not expecting a
night assault, the Carthaginians were at first in the utmost
terror; they, however, defended themselves so courageously,
that Scipio could not carry out his escalade; but, perceiving
a tower that was forsaken, and which stood very near the
city walls, he detached thither a party of intrepid and active
soldiers, who, by the help of pontoons, got from the tower
on to the walls, and thence into Megara, the gates of which
they broke down. Scipio entered it immediately after, and
drove the enemy out of that post. Terrified at this unexpected
228

assault, and imagining that the whole city was taken,
they fled into the citadel, whither they were followed even by
those forces that were encamped without the city, who abandoned
their camp to the Romans, and were glad to find a
place of safety.

At daybreak, Asdrubal, perceiving the ignominious defeat
of his troops, in order to be revenged upon the Romans and
to deprive the inhabitants of all hopes of accommodation and
pardon, brought all the Roman prisoners he had taken, upon
the walls, in sight of both armies. There he put them to
the most exquisite tortures, plucking out their eyes, cutting
off their noses, ears, and fingers; tearing their skin from
their bodies with iron rakes or harrows, and then threw them
from the top of the battlements. Such inhumanity filled the
Carthaginians even with horror; he, however, did not spare
them, but murdered many senators who had ventured to
oppose his cruelty and tyranny. This was a worthy descendant
of the Carthaginians who in the first Punic war
tortured Regulus.

Scipio, finding himself master of the isthmus, burnt the
camp the enemy had deserted, and built a new one for his
troops. It was of a square form, surrounded with strong and
deep intrenchments, and fenced with large palisades; on the
side which faced the Carthaginians, he built a wall twelve
feet high, flanked at proper distances with towers and redoubts;
and on the middle tower he erected a very high
wooden fort, whence everything could be seen that was
going on in the city. This wall was equal to the whole
breadth of the isthmus,âthat is, twenty-five stadia. The
enemy, who were within bow-shot of it, employed their utmost
efforts to put a stop to this work; but as the whole
army were engaged in it night and day without intermission,
it was finished in twenty-four days. Scipio reaped a double
advantage from this work: first, his forces were lodged
more safely and commodiously; secondly, he cut off all
supplies of provisions from the besieged, to whom none could
now be brought but by sea, which was attended with many
difficulties, arising from the frequency of tempests and the
good guard kept by the Roman fleet. This proved one of
the chief causes of the famine which raged soon after in the
city. Besides, Asdrubal distributed the corn that was
229

brought only among the thirty thousand men who served
under him, caring little what became of the rest of the
inhabitants.

To complete their distress for provisions, Scipio attempted
to stop up the mouths of the haven by a mole, beginning at
the neck of land which was near the harbour. The besieged
at first looked upon this attempt as ridiculous, and amused
themselves with laughing at and insulting the workmen; but
at last, seeing them make an astonishing progress every day,
they began to be afraid, and to adopt measures to defeat the
undertaking. Every one, even the women and children,
went to work, but so privately, that all that Scipio could
learn from the prisoners was, that they had heard a great
noise in the harbour, but did not know the cause of it. At
length, all things being ready, the Carthaginians opened on
a sudden a new outlet on the other side of the haven, and
appeared at sea, with a numerous fleet built with the old
materials found in their magazines. It is generally allowed
that, had they attacked the Roman fleet directly, they must
infallibly have taken it; because, as no such attempt was
expected and every man was elsewhere employed, the Carthaginians
would have found it without rowers, soldiers, or
officers. But the ruin of Carthage, says the historian, was
decreed. Having offered a kind of bravado to the Romans,
they returned into the harbour.

Two days after, they brought forward their ships with an
intention of fighting in good earnest, but found the enemy
ready for them. This battle was to determine the fate of
both parties. The conflict was long and obstinate, each
exerting themselves to the utmost,âthe one to save their
country, now reduced to the last extremity, and the other
to complete their victory. During the fight, the Carthaginian
brigantines, running along under the large Roman
ships, broke to pieces sometimes their sterns, and at other
times their rudders and oars; and when briskly attacked,
retreated with surprising swiftness, and returned as quickly
to the charge. At last, after the two armies had fought with
equal success till sunset, the Carthaginians thought proper
to retire; not that they believed themselves overcome, but in
order to begin the fight again on the morrow. Part of their
ships not being able to run swiftly enough into the harbour,
230

because the mouth of it was too narrow, took shelter under
a very spacious terrace, which had been thrown up against
the walls to unload goods, on the side of which a small rampart
had been raised during the war, to prevent the enemy
from possessing themselves of it. Here the fight was again
renewed with more vigour than ever, and lasted till late at
night. The Carthaginians suffered very much, and the few
ships that got off sailed for refuge to the city. As soon as
morning dawned, Scipio attacked the terrace and carried it,
though with much difficulty; after which, he made a lodgment
there, fortified himself on it, and built a brick wall
close to those of the city, and of the same height. When it
was finished, he commanded four thousand men to get on
the top of it, and to discharge a perpetual shower of darts
and arrows upon the enemy, which did great execution,
because the two walls being of equal height, almost every
missile took effect. Thus ended this campaign.

During the winter quarters, Scipio endeavoured to overpower
the enemyâs troops without the city, who very much
harassed the convoys that brought his provisions, and
protected such as were sent to the besieged. With this
purpose, he attacked a neighbouring fort called Nepheris, in
which they were accustomed to shelter themselves. In the
last action an immense number of soldiers, and peasants
who had been enlisted, were cut to pieces, and the fort
was carried with great difficulty, after a siege of two-and-twenty
days. The capture of this fort was followed by the
surrender of almost all the strongholds in Africa, and contributed
very much to the taking of Carthage itself, into
which, from that time, it was almost impossible to bring any
provisions.

Early in the spring, Scipio attacked, at one and the same
time, the harbour called Cothon, and the citadel. Having
possessed himself of the wall which surrounded this port, he
threw himself into the great square of the city that was near
it, whence was an ascent to the citadel, up three streets, on
each side of which were houses, from the tops whereof a
shower of darts was discharged upon the Romans, who were
obliged, before they could advance further, to force the
houses they first came to, and post themselves in them, in
order to dislodge thence the enemy who fought from the
231

neighbouring houses. This combat, which was carried on
from the tops and from every part of the houses, continued
six days, during which a dreadful slaughter was made. To
clear the streets and make way for the troops, the Romans
dragged aside, with hooks, the bodies of such of the inhabitants
as had been slain, or precipitated from the tops of the
houses, and threw them into pits, the greater part of them
being still alive and panting. In this toil, which lasted six
days and as many nights, the soldiers were relieved from
time to time by fresh ones, Scipio being the only person
who did not appear to take rest; he was in all places, and at
all hours, scarcely allowing himself time to take food enough
to support nature.

There was every reason to believe that the siege would
last much longer, and occasion a still greater effusion of
blood. But on the seventh day there appeared a company
of men in the posture and habit of supplicants, who desired
no other conditions than that the Romans would please to
spare the lives of all those who should be willing to leave
the citadel; which request was granted, only excepting the
deserters. Accordingly, there came out fifty thousand men
and women, who were sent into the fields under a strong
guard. The deserters, who were about nine hundred, finding
they would not be allowed quarter, fortified themselves
in the Temple of Ãsculapius, with Asdrubal, his wife, and
two children; where, though their numbers were so small,
they might have held out a long time, because the temple
stood on a very high hill, upon rocks, and the ascent was by
sixty steps. But, at last, exhausted by hunger and watching,
oppressed with fear, and seeing their destruction at
hand, they lost all patience; and abandoning the lower part
of the temple, they retired to the uppermost story, resolved
not to quit it but with their lives.

In the mean time, Asdrubal, being desirous of saving his
own life, came down privately to Scipio, bearing an olive
branch in his hand, and threw himself at his feet. Scipio
exhibited him immediately to the deserters, who, transported
with rage and fury at the sight, vented frightful imprecations
against him, and set fire to the temple. Whilst it was
kindling, we are told that Asdrubalâs wife, dressing herself
as splendidly as possible, and placing herself with her two
232

children in sight of Scipio, addressed him with a loud voice:
âI call not down,â said she, âcurses upon thy head, O
Roman! for thou only takest the privilege allowed thee by
the laws of war: but may the gods of Carthage, and thou
in concert with them, punish, according to his deserts, the
false wretch who has betrayed his country, his gods, his wife,
his children!â Then, addressing herself to Asdrubal, âPerfidious
wretch!â said she, âthou basest of men! this fire
will presently consume both me and my children; but as to
thee, unworthy general of Carthage, goâadorn the gay
triumph of thy conquerorâsuffer, in the sight of all Rome,
the tortures thou so justly deservest.â She had no sooner
pronounced these words than she seized her children, and,
cutting their throats, threw them into the flames, and afterwards
rushed into them herselfâin which she was imitated
by the deserters.

When Scipio saw this famous city, which had been so
flourishing for seven hundred years, and might have been compared
to the greatest empires, on account of the extent of its
dominions both by sea and land; its mighty armies; its
fleets, elephants, and riches; while the Carthaginians were
even superior to other nations by their courage and greatness
of soul; as, notwithstanding their being deprived of
arms and ships, they had sustained, for three whole years,
all the hardships and calamities of a long siege; seeing, I
say, the city entirely ruined, historians relate that he could
not refuse his tears to the unhappy fate of Carthage. He
reflected that cities, nations, and empires are liable to revolution
no less than private men; that the like sad fate had
befallen Troy, anciently so powerful; and, in later times,
the Assyrians, Medes, and Persians, whose dominions were
once of so great an extent; and very recently, the Macedonians,
whose empire had been so glorious throughout the
world. Full of these mournful ideas, he repeated the following
verses from
Homer:â

âThe day shall come, that great avenging day,

Which Troyâs proud glories in the dust shall lay;

When Priamâs powers, and Priamâs self shall fall,

And one prodigious ruin swallow all.ââ
Pope.

Thereby denouncing the future destiny of Rome, as he himself
233

confessed to Polybius, who desired Scipio to explain
himself on that occasion.
8

The fate of Carthage was similar to that of most empires
or states that have grown inordinately wealthy, either by
conquest or commerce: indulgence follows wealth, and
luxury, sensuality, and vice follow indulgence. To support
these requires more than that which attained them; to
industry succeeds corruptionâand then, good-night!

Carthage being taken, Scipio gave the plunder of it (the
gold, silver, statues, and other offerings, which should be
found in the temples, excepted) to his soldiers for some days.
He afterwards bestowed several military rewards on them,
as well as on the officers, two of whom, Tiberius Gracchus
and Caius Tannius, had particularly distinguished themselves:
they had been the first to scale the walls. After
this, adorning a small ship, an excellent sailer, with the
spoils of the enemy, he sent it to Rome with the news of the
victory.

TOULOUSE.

A.C. 106.

In
the year of Rome 646, Cepio, a man so covetous of
wealth as to think both peculation and sacrilege justifiable
in the pursuit of it, was sent into Transalpine Gaul. This
general commenced his operations by attacking Tolosa, now
Toulouse. The Roman garrison had been placed in irons.
Cepio was admitted by treachery into the city, which he
delivered up to pillage. Nothing was spared, sacred or
profane; all became the prey of the soldiery. It is said that
the consulâs share of the booty amounted to nearly two
millions sterling, principally taken from the temples. It is
to be remembered, when we feel astonished at this amount
of wealth, that Tolosa was an ancient and very flourishing
city, by its position connected with Greece, and sharing
considerably in the Mediterranean trade. Notwithstanding
its favourable position for commerce, during the last eight
234

hundred years, Toulouse has been more celebrated for its
love of the arts and its patronage of the Belles Lettres than
for its industrial or trading enterprise. Historians held out
the sacrilegious plunder of Cepio as a lesson to other conquerors;
for they say he was punished in a striking manner:
the Romans were defeated everywhere, and the life of Cepio
proved such a continuous series of disasters, that when a
man was unfortunate, it became a proverb to say he had
âAurum Tolosanumâ (he was possessed of Toulouse gold).

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1217.

The next siege of Toulouse is connected with one of the
blackest pages in human history, the horrid war, or crusade
as it is termed, against the Albigeois. The licentiousness
of the clergy and the barefaced venality and ambition of the
hierarchy led people to look with jealousy at the doctrines
by which these men supported their influence; and the consequence
necessarily was, that many seceded from the
Church, and formed sects, or shades of belief, according to
their intelligence, or perhaps passions. This, in fact, was
the commencement of the Reformation, which, though kept
under by the power of the Church, silently but unceasingly
worked its way, till the ostentatious extravagance of Leo X.
and the exasperated genius of Luther, nearly three hundred
years after, brought it to a head. The rich provinces of the
south of France were the first melancholy scenes of the
series of persecutions, under the name of a religion of
peace, which have since, in wars, assassinations, and
autos-da-fÃ¨
,
in dungeons and inquisitions, tortures and the stake,
disgraced humanity.

Raymond, count of Toulouse, was the richest prince in
Europe when Innocent III. set on the dogs of rapine, by
preaching a crusade against him and his beautiful country.
In the crusades to the Holy Land many more had been
attracted by the fabulous accounts of the riches of the
East, than by any care about the redemption of the holy
places, so, in this European crusade, the wealth of Toulouse
was the principal incentive to the adventurers who flocked
to the plunder. At that period, individual enterprise was
perhaps stronger than at any other: a prince of Lorraine had
235

become king of Jerusalem; a high-sounding title, though
barren of everything but care: a few Norman knights had
made themselves masters of Sicily and of part of the south
of Italy: William of Normandy, and his wonderful success,
were not forgotten; so that, directly there was a chance of
territorial plunder, particularly under the sanction of the
Church, the unscrupulous, restless, needy spirits of the age
were all roused to action, and eager to obtain the first prize.
One of the worst of this class, Simon de Montfort, was the
leader of this infamous league. A French author describing
him, says, âhe would have been the hero of his age, if he
had not been
ambitious
,
barbarous
,
perfidious
, and
revengeful
.â
Plutarch would never have introduced the word
hero
, as in
any way compatible with such a character. And here we take
leave to warn our young readers against the partiality they
may conceive for Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester,
who figured in the reign of our Henry III., from reading a
pleasing tale by Mr. James. His De Montfort is a fiction,
the real man was of the same character as his father; he
was an adventurer, and his quarry was England, as Toulouse
had been that of his predecessor.

In vain Count Raymond, the sovereign of the unfortunate
Albigeois, endeavoured to defend them; he was crushed beneath
the same anathema, and was obliged to fly before De
Montfort. Subdued, a wanderer, and a proscribed heretic,
the count was reduced to the most deplorable condition,
and abandoned Toulouse to the conqueror. The Toulousians
gave up their city very unwillingly. Suffering under the
odious yoke, they recalled their ancient master. Montfort,
informed of this revolution, hastened to the scene of action,
came to the walls, and endeavoured to enter by the Nalbonnais
Castle. But he there found intrepid warriors and
impregnable fortifications. Finding his first attack, from
which he had expected much, fail, he commenced the siege
in form; he fought several bloody battles, made many terrible
assaults, and spared neither fatigue nor stratagem for more
than four months. But he made himself master of the
place by means of a horrible piece of treachery, devised and
executed by Bishop Foulquet. The latter proposed to all
the inhabitants, in the name of the God of peace, to go
forth and meet De Montfort, for the purpose of coming to
236

terms. That atrocious commander received them at the
head of his knights, and made prisoners of most of them.
The war, however, continued with various success, and
Toulouse was again in the hands of the inhabitants.
Whilst besieging it, this scourge was removed by a death
he merited. An enormous stone, cast from a mangonel,
and aimed by a woman, struck him senseless to the earth.
He was borne to his tent, and expired almost immediately.
Thus, like Pyrrhus, perished the ever infamous Simon de
Montfort, by an ignoble missile, launched by a woman.

Count Raymond, who was very aged, shortly after died,

and the priests refused his body sepulture
: his coffin remained
for many years outside the door of a church. His
toleration was his principal crime in the eyes of his clerical
persecutors; a great part of his misfortunes may be attributed
to the weakness of his character, but far more to the
attractions held out to unscrupulous adventurers by his
wealth. When we come to the siege of BÃ©ziers, we shall
again have to turn to this horrible page of history.

SINOPE.

A.C. 71.

There
is very little to relate of this siege; but the interest
it has acquired by a recent melancholy event, and the contrast
between Lucullus and the emperor of Russia, entitle
it to a notice.

Irritated by the presumption and vanity of Tigranes, who
refused to give up his father-in-law Mithridates, after
Lucullus had conquered him, the Roman consul marched
into Pontus, and took its cities as fast as he came to them.
Among these was Sinope, known to classical readers as the
birthplace and residence of the Cynic Diogenes, and of
which Mithridates, king of Pontus, had made his capital.
Lucullus easily made himself master of the place; he treated
the inhabitants with the greatest humanity, restoring them,
the moment the Roman power was acknowledged, their
liberty and their civic privileges.

237

PARIS.

A.C. 52.

We
now come to treat of one of the most conspicuous
cities the world has ever seen. Upon opening such a subject,
we feel strongly tempted to dilate upon all that belongs to
this great city; but our business is with sieges, and we shall
find enough of them to fill more than the space allotted
to us.

Julius CÃ¦sar had made the conquest of a part of Gaul,
and Labienus, his lieutenant, keeping along the banks of
the Seine, determined to take possession of Lutetia, the
capital of the Parisians. It was not then the vast city
which astonishes by its extent, its population, its wealth, its
luxury, and its pleasures. Confined to that which is now
called LâIle du Palais, or Le CitÃ©, it then presented nothing
to the eye but a collection of rustic cabins; but its situation,
in the middle of a river; its natural fortifications, which
made the approach to it difficult and dangerous, with the
well-known valour of its inhabitants, who preferred death
to slavery, rendered it quite worthy of the efforts of the
Romans. At the report of their approach, all the neighbouring
peoples assembled in arms, under the orders of a
distinguished personage, named Camulogenes. Notwithstanding
his extreme old age, he knew and practised all the
duties of a great captain. He at first avoided a pitched
battle, in order to give his troops, who were much more
courageous than disciplined, time to be formed. He took
every advantage of his knowledge of the ground to make
himself master of favourable opportunities. There was
at that time upon the left bank of the Seine, above
Lutetia, a large marsh, whose waters flowed into the river,
of which he made a rampart. Labienus endeavoured to
force him, but was repulsed; he might, indeed, have lost all
his legions there, had he not made a speedy retreat. Irritated
238

at this check, the Roman general fell upon Melun,
whose inhabitants were in the army of Camulogenes, sacked
that hamlet, crossed the Seine there, and following the right
bank of the river, presented himself again before Lutetia.
The Gaulish general, in order to prevent his taking the city
and fortifying himself in it, set fire to it, and destroyed the
bridges. Protected by the marsh, he remained in his camp
opposite to the Romans, from whom he was separated by
the river. In the mean time the nations who peopled the
frontiers of the Parisii took up arms, for the purpose of
overwhelming the Romans at once. Labienus had brought
fifty large boats with him from Melun. At nightfall he
despatched them, with orders to descend the river as silently
as possible till they came below Lutetia, nearly at the spot
where now stands the village of Anteuil, and to wait there
without making the least movement. His design was to
cross the Seine at that place. In order to deceive the
Gauls, he sent towards the confluence of the Seine and the
Maine five cohorts, who had charge of all the baggage, and
were attended by some barks, filled with sailors. These
soldiers marched with as much noise as possible, and the
rowers struck the water with all their strength, in order to
attract the attention of the Gauls. This stratagem was
successful, and the Parisians had no idea of the movement
of Labienus, until at daybreak they perceived that general
advancing towards them on their side of the river. They
were immediately in motion, and rushed forward to meet
the Romans. The battle was fought in the plain where
now stand the villages of Issi and Vangirard. It was warm
and obstinate. The Gauls fought with a courage worthy of
greater success. Camulogenes set them the example; though
bent beneath the weight of years, this hero appeared, in the
midst of his warriors, to regain all the vigour of youth; he
was ever found at the post of danger, and threw himself
fearlessly into the thickest of the
mÃªlÃ©e
. This first defender
of Parisian liberty met with the death great men desire; he
expired fighting for his country, amidst a heap of dead
which his arm had immolated. The victory of the Romans
was complete, and Labienus derived much glory from his
achievement.

239

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 885.

From that time Lutetia, or Paris, became a famous city.
Rome brought thither its intelligence and its errors, its
wisdom and its vices, its wealth and its luxury, its laws and
its abuses. But the Parisians, formerly so simple and so
brave, changed all at once into sages, lost with their rustic
virtue that intense love of liberty which had animated them.
During nearly nine centuries they were no longer known
than by the different masters they submitted to, and by the
consideration they enjoyed among the peoples of Gaul.
They were the head of them. Paris was the centre of the
Roman dominions in that part of the empire; the Roman
governors resided there. Emperors even preferred Lutetia
to the most brilliant cities; Julian the Apostate, who embellished
it with monuments, never called it anything but his
âdear Lutetia.â When Clovis had laid the foundation of
the French monarchy, Paris became the capital of his states.
Under the reign of this prince and his successors, its extent
was so enlarged as to comprise all the space contained
between the two arms of the Seine. The irruptions of the
barbarians rendered the fortification of it necessary. No
entrance could be had to it but by two bridges: each of
these was defended by a strong tower, situated nearly where
the great and little ChÃ¢telet have since been built. In 885
the importance of these precautions was recognised; a
swarm of Normans, eager for booty and thirsting for blood,
besieged Paris, which they had often before uselessly attacked.
Their army consisted of forty thousand men, and
more than seven hundred boats covered the Seine for two
leagues; fire-ships, towers, cavaliers, all the machines invented
for the destruction of cities, were employed by these
barbarians. They gave six assaults. The Parisians received
them with the greatest courage, were animated by the
example of the Count Eudes, whose great qualities afterwards
raised him to the throne of the Franks, and by the exhortations
of Bishop Gauzlin. This prelate, with helm on head,
a quiver at his back, and an axe at his girdle, fought in the
breach, within sight of a cross he had planted upon the
rampart. He met with death whilst immolating a host of
240

enemies. Anscheric, who succeeded him upon the episcopal
seat, inherited his courage and his love of his country. He
continued to lead the besieged, ably seconded by Ebole, the
nephew of Gauzlin. This intrepid abbot spread astonishment
and terror wherever he directed his arms, nature having
endowed him with prodigious strength. In the second
assault he rushed to the breach, armed with a javelin which
looked like a great spit, with which he pierced the Normans,
crying out to his compatriots, âTake these to the kitchen,
they are all ready spitted.â At length, after eighteen
months of successless efforts, the barbarians made a last
attempt; they came in crowds to the foot of the walls; they
were not expected, and many had already gained the parapets,
and were crying victory. At that moment a soldier of
moderate height, but of extraordinary valour, named Gerbaut,
followed only by five men as brave as himself, killed the first,
hurled the others into the ditch, snatched up the ladders,
and saved the city. Charles le Gros, who had made but
little effort to succour his faithful subjects, treated with the
Normans, and induced them to retire, upon promising to
pay them seven hundred poundsâ weight of silver in the
course of a few months. This cowardly composition, made
by a king at the head of an army, excited the general disgust
of the Franks. He allowed the Normans to pillage
his finest provinces. He was deposed at the diet of Tibur,
in 888, and died the same year in indigence, deserted by
everybody.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1411.

Paris became in after-ages the sanguinary theatre of civil
wars, which, under the reign of weak princes, desolated the
kingdom. These unhappy times commenced under the
pusillanimous administration of Charles VI. The hatreds
which divided the nobles broke out openly: France was
divided into two factions, almost equally powerful,âthat of
the duke of Orleans, which was called the
Armagnacs
; and
that of the duke of Burgundy, called the Burgundians.
Almost all the Parisians were of the latter party. The first
wore, as a distinctive mark, a white cross at right angles;
the second, a red cross oblique, called the cross of St. Andrew.
241

These two parties soon made cruel war upon each
other. The Armagnacs marched towards Paris, the hopes of
plundering that great city exciting the ardour and cupidity
of the troops. Everything yielded to their first efforts: at
their approach, most of the garrisons distributed in the
neighbouring places sought safety in flight. St. Denis was
the only city that defended itself for a few days. Jean de
ChÃ¢lons, prince of Orange, commanded in the place; the
fear of its being carried by assault obliged him to capitulate;
he marched out with his garrison, under a promise of not
bearing arms for four years. The treachery of Colonel De
Paysieux rendered the OrlÃ©anais masters of St. Cloud, and
of the passage of the Seine above Paris. That city, entirely
closed in on the north side, already experienced a scarcity of
provisions; the troops spread about the environs daily perpetrated
the most horrid cruelties. Houses of pleasure,
villages, fields of corn, were all on fire; massacres and violences
of every kind, the most horrible sacrileges, the most
guilty excesses, were the sports of these pitiless destroyers.
Among these brigands was Montagu, archbishop of Sens,
who, instead of a mitre, wore a bassinet; for a dalmaique,
a habergeon; for a chasuble, a steel gorget; and instead
of a cross, carried an axe. Nevertheless, with the danger from
without, the fury of the Parisians increased daily, excited
above all by the fanaticism of the priests of the capital. All
the pulpits resounded with declamations against the Armagnacs.
The besiegers were excommunicated. The OrlÃ©anais,
in reply to this anathema, struck the duke of Burgundy and
his adherents with excommunication. The archbishop of
Sens, the bishops of Paris, OrlÃ©ans, and Chartres, with
several doctors of this age of ignorance, had dictated this
dreaded decree. It was thus they sported with religion to
justify the horrors committed on both sides. Every festival,
the curÃ©s of Paris interrupted the sacrifice of the mass, to
renew the thunders launched against the Armagnacs; they
even made a difficulty of administering baptism to the
children of those they believed favourable to that party.
People did not dare to appear in the streets without the red
scarf and the cross of St. Andrew. Priests wore them at
the altar; the church pictures were decked with them; not
even children newly born were exempt from displaying this
242

distinctive mark of the dominant faction. They carried the
madness so far as to make the sign of the cross according to
the form of the crucifixion of St. Andrew. The people murmured
at being shut up within the walls, whilst the enemy
triumphed at their gates; seditious cries announced that
they wanted to fight; and it became necessary to obey this
blinded populace. The count de St. Paul and the prevÃ´t
Des Essarts, at the head of a detachment of Parisians, badly
armed and without order, made a sortie by the gate of St.
Denis; they were beaten, although six times more numerous
than their adversaries, and precipitately re-entered the city
by the gate St. HonorÃ©, after having lost four hundred of
their men. This humiliating disgrace completed the despair
of the vanquished: in a transport of rage, they made a
second sortie from the other side of the city. Goi, one of
the officers of militia, led them to the castle of Wicestre
(now BicÃªtre), a pleasure-house, which the duke de Berry
prided himself with having ornamented with all the embellishments
the art of that age could furnish. As no troops
appeared to stop these contemptible warriors, they gave free
way to the madness which governed them: the gates of this
palace were broken open; they plundered the valuable furniture;
they even took away the glass windows, which were
then an object of luxury reserved for the houses of the great.
This brutal expedition was crowned by the firing of the
building. Among the inestimable loss caused by the conflagration,
persons of taste particularly regretted a chronological
series of the portraits of the kings of France of the
third race, most of them original.

Whilst both parties were giving themselves up to these
horrible excesses, the duke of Burgundy formed the idea of
delivering the capital. This prince, at the head of his own
troops, and a few companies of English headed by the earl
of Arundel, crossed the Seine at the bridge of Melun, where
three thousand Parisians awaited him, and made his
entrÃ©e

into Paris, surrounded by fifteen thousand horsemen. The
streets, filled with an innumerable multitude, resounded
with acclamations; all were eager to load him with honours
and to evince their gratitude. Amidst their transports of
joy, however, the Parisians beheld with much pain squadrons
of English mixed with the French troops. Secretly indignant
243

at seeing the conservation of the capital, the security
of the king, and the safety of the state, committed to the
suspicious protection of a rival nation, not one of them would
give lodging to these foreigners, who were obliged to pass
the night upon their horses. The next day they were distributed
with much trouble among the bourgeois, and principally
among those whose attachment was doubtful. The
appearance of everything was changed by the arrival of the
Burgundian prince. The numbers of the OrlÃ©anais diminished
daily; in the frequent sorties that were made, they
hardly sufficed to guard their posts, till at length St. Cloud,
the most important of them, was carried by assault. In
this affair they lost nine hundred of their best soldiers,
whilst only twenty of the Burgundians were killed. The
duke of OrlÃ©ans lost all hopes of entering Paris: his army
was melting away; winter was coming on; and he had
nothing left but a disgraceful retreat. He called a council
of war, in which the necessity for raising the blockade was
acknowledged by all. On the very evening of the day of the
taking of St. Cloud, the OrlÃ©anais army loaded themselves
with all the booty they could carry away, they pillaged the
treasures of the queen, deposited for safety in the abbey of
St. Denis, which they had till that time respected, crossed
the Seine, and marched without halting to Etampes. Information
of this nocturnal retreat was not conveyed to
Paris till it was too late to pursue them.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1429.

Paris, which since the invasion of the English had been a
prey to their tyranny, did not dare to declare in favour of
Charles VII., who had just been crowned at Rheims. The
king attempted to enter the capital, followed by his whole
army. All the small neighbouring places vied with each
other in their eagerness to receive him. He took possession
of St. Denis, and occupied the posts of La Chapelle, Aubervilliers,
and Montmartre. His generals, confiding in the
intelligence they maintained with some in the city, resolved
to attempt an assault on Sunday, 8th of September, 1429.
They approached the gate of St. Denis with the design of
persuading the English that they meant to attack the capital
244

at that point; at the same time, a considerable detachment
presented itself before an intrenchment which the enemy
had raised before the rampart of the hog-market, upon which
is built the quarter now called La Butte-Saint-Roch. The
boulevard was carried at once. Whilst the English, led by
the bishop of ThÃ©rouanne, LâIle-Adam, Crequi, and Bonneval,
were hastening thither, numerous voices shouted out in
various quarters of Paris, for the purpose of terrifying the
people,ââAll is lost! all is lost! The royalists are masters
of the city! Let every one look to himself!â This
ruse

produced the effect the English had expected: the people,
in a state of consternation, precipitately sought refuge in
their houses, and delivered the English from the suspicions
they had conceived. In the mean time the royalists, finding
the people made no movement in their favour, judged it
prudent to retreat. Joan of Arc, who had joined the party
in order to animate the French by her presence, accustomed
by her successes never to recede, would not consent to give
up the affair; she persisted in wishing to fill up the ditch filled
with water, of which she did not at all know the depth. She
was crying aloud for fascines to be brought to her, when she
was wounded by an arrow from a cross-bow, in the thigh.
Obliged by the pain of the wound and the quantity of blood
she lost to recline behind the shelter of a little eminence,
she remained there till evening, when the duke of AlenÃ§on
was compelled to force her to return to St. Denis. Charles,
conceiving the capture of Paris impossible, thought it best
to retreat: his army decamped, and took the road to
Lagni-sur-Marne, which had declared for him.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1465.

The duke de Berry, brother of Louis XI., at the age of
sixteen escaped from the court, and joined the duke of
Brittany, for the purpose of exciting a revolution which
might prove favourable to him. The princes of the blood
and the nobles, who waited for some outbreak to make war
against the king, immediately issued manifestoes, in which
they invited the noblesse, and all good citizens, âto take up
arms, to obtain relief for the poor distressed people.â This
specious pretext procured for this union of rebels the name
245

of âThe League for the Public Good.â The princes soon
found themselves at the head of a pretty considerable
army; and in order to commence by something brilliant,
capable of giving credit to the revolt, after having gained
several small places, they resolved to make a general
assault upon the capital. But Paris was too well fortified
to make the success of such an enterprise at all probable.
The count de Charolais, the head of the leagued troops,
drew up his soldiers in order of battle within sight of the
ramparts. He believed this display would disconcert the
zeal and fidelity of the inhabitants; but nothing could
shake them. The marshal De Rohan made a sortie, and did
not return until he had skirmished long and successfully.
Some days after, the enemy attacked the faubourg Saint
Lazare, the barriers of which were upon the point of being
forced, when the citizen-militia coming up, courageously
repulsed the rebels, who, harassed at the same time by the
artillery from the ramparts, retired in disorder.

The battle of MontlhÃ©ry suspended for a time the project
of the princes. But scarcely was that celebrated contest
decided, than the count de Charolais made fresh attempts
upon the capital. Our readers will the better understand
the hardihood and persistency of the countâs attacks, when
reminded that he was the son of the duke of Burgundy,
and was afterwards known as âCharles the Bold.â As the
royalists were masters of St. Cloud and Charenton, the
leader of the enemyâs troops caused bridges of boats and
casks tied together to be hastily constructed, upon which
his army crossed the Seine at various times. He thus
inclosed within a half-circle all the northern part of the
environs of Paris, extending from St. Cloud to Charenton,
of which he took possession without much trouble. Louis XI.
and his troops were encamped on the southern side. The
loss of Charenton might have intercepted the supply of
provisions to the capital, but such prudent measures had
been taken, that during the whole of the siege no deficiency
in food was felt. The princes at first had recourse to
negotiations, but they proved useless; and both sides
renewed hostilities, which were warm and frequent. Sorties
were made every day, and these combats generally terminated
in favour of the kingâs troops. The honour of
246

this was principally due to the fair sex of the capital: âFor
the warriors,â says Philip de Commines, âbeheld the ladies
at all times; giving them a desire to show their prowess in
their sight.â The enemy had placed their advanced posts
at Bercy, which was then called âLa Grange-aux-Merciers.â
They were obliged to abandon them, and retire to Conflans,
the head-quarters of the count de Charolais. The royal
army occupied the opposite bank of the Seine. Several
batteries, which defended the access to it, were erected
there. The leagued princes undertook to throw a bridge of
boats across the river, opposite the Port-Ã -lâAnglais. The
king immediately constructed a bulwark, from which
artillery, incessantly hurling its mortal thunders, prevented
them from advancing. At the same time, a Norman archer,
whose name history ought to have preserved, threw himself
into the Seine, and contrived to reach the head of the
bridge, of which he cut the cables that fastened it to the
shore, and abandoned it to the current. This series of ill-fortune
induced the League general to resume the interrupted
negotiations, and at length, after numerous contentions
and delays, a treaty of peace was concluded at
Conflans, which delivered Paris from its besiegers. The
capital signified its joy by brilliant festivals. The king, to
reward its fidelity, confirmed all its privileges: he honoured
with his presence a banquet at the HÃ´tel de Ville, at which
many citizens and their wives were admitted to the table of
the monarch, with the princes and nobles.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.D. 1589â1594.

The flame of civil wars, of which Francis II. had beheld
the first sparks, had set all France in a blaze during the
minority of Charles IX. Religion was the motive of these
wars among the people, and the pretext among the great.
The queen-mother, Catherine de Medici, who joined to the
most boundless ambition the artful policy of her country,
had more than once hazarded the safety of the kingdom to
preserve her authority; arming the Catholics against the
Protestants, and the Guises against the Bourbons, that they
might destroy each other. In this age of troubles, the
great, who had become too powerful, were factious and formidable;
247

and the French, animated by that party fury
which a false zeal inspires, were, for the most part, fanatics
and barbarians. Passions or interests armed every hand:
one-half of the nation made war against the other half.
The greatest cities were taken, retaken, and sacked, in turn.
Prisoners of war were put to death in a manner till that
time unheard of. The churches were reduced to ashes by
the Reformers, the temples by the Catholics. Poisonings
and assassinations were looked upon as only the legitimate
vengeance of clever enemies. The crowning horror of all
these excesses was the massacre of St. Bartholomew. On
that ever-execrable day, a young king of twenty-three
commanded, in cool blood, the death of more than a
million of his subjects, and himself set the example of
murder. Charles IX. did not long survive this abuse of
sovereign power. Henry III. quitted furtively the throne
of Poland, to return to his country and plunge it once more
into troubles. Of the two brothers, notwithstanding what
we have said of Charles IX., Henry III. was the worse:
there is no more detestable character in history than this
prince, who rather resembles a Heliogabalus or a Commodus,
than a king of chivalric France: in the great
massacre he had been, if possible, more active than his
brother.

He found in his states two dominant parties; that of the
Reformers, reviving from its ashes, more violent than ever,
and having at its head Henry the Great, then king of Navarre;
and that of the League, a powerful faction, formed by the
princes of the house of Guise, encouraged by the popes,
fomented by Philip II. of Spain, whose dangerous policy
procured him the name of the Demon of the South,
increasing every day by the artifices of the monks, under
the veil of zeal for the Catholic religion, but whose principal
aim was rebellion. Its leader was the duke of Guise,
surnamed le BalafrÃ©, from a scar on his cheek, a prince of a
brilliant reputation, and who, having more shining qualities
than good ones, seemed, in this season of confusion, born
to change the destinies of France. Henry III., who
perhaps might have crushed both these parties by a judicious
exercise of the regal power, absolutely strengthened them
by his own weakness. He thought to exhibit a great feat
248

of policy by declaring himself the head of the League;
whereas he only proved himself the slave of it. He was
forced to make war for the interests of the duke de Guise,
whose object was to dethrone him, against the king of
Navarre, his brother-in-law and presumptive heir, who only
wished to re-establish him in all the rights of his rank.
Some successes against the Reformers carried the credit of
the too-powerful BalafrÃ© to its height. This prince, inflated
with his own glory, and strong in the weakness of the king,
came to Paris in opposition to the royal command. Then
arrived the celebrated day of the
barricades
, in which the
people defeated the guards of Henry, and obliged him
himself to fly from his capital. Guise did still more; he
forced the king to hold the States-General of the kingdom
at Blois, and took his measures so well, that he was near
sharing the royal authority, with the consent of the representatives
of the nation, and with an appearance of the
most respectable formalities. Roused by a danger so
pressing, Henry III. caused this redoutable enemy, and the
cardinal de Lorraine, his brother, still more violent and
ambitious than the duke, to be assassinated at the castle of
Blois. That which happened to the Protestant party after
the St. Bartholomew, now happened to the League; the
death of the leaders reanimated the faction. On all parts
the Leaguers threw off the mask. Paris closed its gates:
nothing was thought or talked of but vengeance. Henry III.
was considered as the assassin of the defenders of religion,
as an odious, insupportable tyrant, and not as a king who
had punished too audacious subjects. The king, pressed on
all sides, was at length obliged to seek a reconciliation with
Henry of Navarre; in the course of 1589 these two princes
encamped in conjunction before Paris.

We cannot describe without a groan the excesses to which
the capital gave itself up on learning the death of the duke
de Guise: the shops closed, the people in crowds in the
streets, arms in hand, seeking everywhere the duke
dâAumale, to place him at the head of the League, knocking
down the kingâs arms wherever met with, and imprisoning
every one suspected of fidelity to him. A kind of vertigo or
spirit of fury took possession of all the citizens without
exception; they willingly allowed themselves to be dragged
249

into the most detestable rebellion. The churches were hung
with mourning, and the depositaries of the Word of God proclaimed
aloud the martyrdom of the BalafrÃ© and his brother.
âThose unworthy ministers,â says an historian of the time,
âonly mounted the pulpit to put forth, instead of the
Scriptures, a series of bitter insults against the sovereign,
and by the vomitings of an iliad of maledictions, they increased
the fury of revolt. The people never came out
from their infamous sermons without their brain being on
fire, their feet prepared for running, and their hands for
fighting, like so many wild beasts, against all who did not
wear the badge of the League. The colporteurs of the palace
cried nothing but an execration of the life of Henry III.,
the self-called king. They said that France was sick, and
that she could never be cured without giving her a draught
of French blood.â

The leaders of the sedition sought, however, to colour the
public excesses with some specious pretexts. They caused a
request to be presented to the faculty of Theology at Paris,
in which it was said âthat the princes of the house of
Lorraine had always deserved well of the Catholic church
during their lives, and that, being protectors of the faith,
the king had put them to death; that the monarch must be
declared to have forfeited his crown, and his subjects be
released from their fidelity; that that prince was a hypocrite,
a favourer of heresy, a persecutor of the Church, having
bathed his hands in the blood of a cardinal, without respect
to his person or his sacred character.â The Sorbonne, on
the 7th of January, issued a decree, which allowed and even
ordered all that this request stated. Lefebvre the dean,
and several other doctors, refused to sign this abominable
sentence; but the majority prevailed, and gave it all the
authority that was desired. The principal Leaguers, armed
with this fatal document, tried to lay the foundations of an
authority, which the same caprice which gave it to them
might deprive them of an instant after. The heads of the
sixteen quarters of Paris, all scoundrels, and for the most
part the issue of low families, were revered like so many
sovereigns. These monsters governed Paris; they were its
oracles, and put in motion the arms of all the rebels. They
also determined to have the Parliament. Bussy le Clere,
250

governor of the Bastille, who had been a master-at-arms,
took upon himself the task of ordering that august company
to enregister the decree of the Sorbonne. On the 16th of
January he entered the assembly of French senators with
fifty of his satellites, and, pistol in hand, presented to them
a request, or rather an order, no longer to recognise the
royal house. The refusal being unanimous, he selected the
most conspicuous and led them away at once to the Bastille,
where the barbarous manner in which he treated them
procured him the sobriquet of âGrand Penitentiary of the
Parliament.â

Very shortly, the duke de Mayenne, brother and heir to
the power of the duke de Guise, arrived in Paris with a
reinforcement of troops. This prince, intrepid and intelligent,
but indolent, was still employed in placing the capital
in a state of defence, when the two kings of France and
Navarre appeared at its gates with an army of forty thousand
men. Henry III. took possession of the bridge of St. Cloud,
and formed the blockade of the faubourg St. HonorÃ© and
the whole quarter of the Louvre as far as the river; the
king of Navarre, on the other side, besieged the faubourg
St. Marceau to that of St. Germain. The consternation and
the fury of the Parisians were extreme when they found
themselves surrounded in this manner by the royal troops.
The priests recommenced their seditious declamations; to
strike the vulgar, they caused little figures of wax to be made,
representing the two monarchs, which they placed upon the
altar during mass, and pricked them with knives. All priests
carried arms, and mounted guard with the other citizens.
But this aimless and blind fury could not have protected
the capital from the just anger of the king, had it not been
prevented by the most infamous of crimes. Jacques Clement,
a priest and Dominican, devoted himself, as he said, to
the task of killing the tyrant. He communicated his project
to the doctors, the Jesuits, the leaders of the League, and
the principals of the Sixteen; all encouraged him, all promised
him the greatest dignities, if he survived this generous
action; and if he became a martyr to it, a place in Heaven,
above the apostles. On the 31st of July he went to St. Cloud,
where the kingâs quarters were. He was arrested by the
sieur de Coublan, and conducted to the procureur-gÃ©nÃ©ral
251

De la Guesle. This magistrate introduced him the next day
into the kingâs apartment. With a simple and respectful
air he presented the king an intercepted letter to the president
De Harley. The monarch having read it, and being
separated from the Dominican by La Guesle, asked him if he
had nothing else to say to him. âI have many important
things to reveal to the king,â replied Clement, âbut I can
only do it in a whisper to his own ear.â âSpeak out!â
cried the procureur-gÃ©nÃ©ral two or three times, as he began
to mistrust the good father. âSpeak aloud, and before me;
there is no one here in whom the king has not confidence.â
Henry then told him to approach. The villain obeyed, and
instead of communicating secrets, plunged a knife, expressly
forged for the purpose, into his bowels, and left it sticking
in the wound. The astonished king immediately drew out
the knife, and springing upon the assassin, stabbed him in
the forehead. La Guesle put the finishing stroke with his
sword. His body was thrown out at the window, torn in
pieces, burnt, and his ashes cast into the Seine.

In proportion as this parricide spread consternation in
the army, so did it give cause of triumph to the Parisians.
A relation of the martyrdom of Brother Jacques Clement
was printed; he was canonized, and lauded at Rome from
the very pulpit in which the funeral oration of Henry III.
ought to have been pronounced. The object was by such
means to incite fresh assassinations. The king died of his
wound on the 2nd of August, at two oâclock in the morning;
and Henry of Bourbon, king of Navarre, whom he had proclaimed
his successor as he was dying, was acknowledged by
a part of the army, and by all who deserved the name of
Frenchmen. The new monarch was obliged to interrupt the
attacks upon Paris to disperse the different armies of the
League; and it was not till after he had rendered himself
master of the places which served as magazines to the
capital, that he formed the blockade of it with less than
twenty thousand men. He commenced by attacking the
faubourgs: his army, divided into ten bodies, attacked ten
different quarters of Paris. In order to witness the operations,
he placed himself in the abbey of Montmartre, and at
midnight gave the signal. The artillery was immediately
heard to roar on both sides. âThere is nobody,â says
252

Sully, âwho would not have supposed that that immense
city was about to perish by fire, or by an infinite number of
mines ignited in its entrails; there perhaps never was a
spectacle more capable of inspiring horror. Dense masses
of smoke, through which pierced at intervals sparks or long
trains of flame, shrouded all the surface of that sort of world
which, by the vicissitudes of light and darkness, appeared
either plunged in black night or covered with a sea of fire.
The roar of the artillery, the clash of arms, the cries of
combatants, added everything to this scene that can be
imagined that is terrifying; and the natural horror of night
redoubled it still more. This lasted two whole hours, and
ended by the reduction of all the faubourgs, even of that of
St. Antoine, though, from its extent, it was obliged to be
attacked from a great distance.â

The kingâs success did not relax the mad courage and the
blind fury of the Parisians; the leaders set the same springs
to work that had been employed the preceding year: sacrilegious
sermons, the confirmation of the Sorbonne, and the
excommunication of the king.

As soon as Henry IV. had closed all the issues from the
city, provisions began to fail, and more than two hundred
thousand persons of all conditions were reduced to the most
awful extremity, but without losing any of that factious
ardour which had seized all minds. To animate the people
still further, a kind of regiment of ecclesiastics was formed,
to the number of thirteen hundred; they appeared on the
bridge of Notre Dame in battle-array, and made a general
review, which was called the Procession of the League.
The leaders carried in one hand a crucifix, and in the other
a halbert, the rest having all sorts of arms.

The Popeâs legate, by his presence, approved of a proceeding
at once so extraordinary and so laughable; but one
of these new soldiers, who was no doubt ignorant that his
arquebuss was loaded with ball, wishing to salute the legate
in his carriage, fired into it, and killed his almoner. The
legate, in consequence of this accident, made as speedy a
retreat as possible; but the people exclaimed that it was a
great blessing for the almoner to be killed in such a holy
cause. Such was the frightful persuasion of this populace,
whom impunity had rendered formidable. They believed
253

themselves invincible under the orders of the duke de
Nemours, a skilful, courageous, and prudent general, whom
the duke de Mayenne, his brother, had left in Paris during
his absence; they were backed by three or four thousand
good troops, and by several nobles of high courage. They
every day skirmished against the royal army, or fought
small battles; the Chevalier dâAumale, of the blood of
Lorraine, being always at the head of their sorties, and
imparting his impetuous valour to his followers. Henry IV.
satisfied himself with repulsing these attacks, convinced that
famine would soon open the gates of the capital to him.

In fact, this terrible scourge began to make rapid progress;
there was neither wheat, barley, nor oats left; more than
fifty thousand persons had already died of want; the sad
remains of this numerous population, nobles, plebeians, rich
or poor, languidly crawled through the streets to seek for
and devour the grass and weeds that grew in them. Mules,
horses, cats, dogs, all the domestic animals,âeven beasts that
are reckoned unclean,âserved for food. The leather of shoes
was sold for its weight in gold; it was boiled and devoured
in secret, for fear some wretch, stronger and more hungry,
should tear it from the mouth of the purchaser. Mothers
were seen feeding upon the flesh of their children, and
miserable beings flew like vultures upon a newly-dead body
that had fallen in the streets. The Spanish ambassador to
the League advised that bread should be made of the ground
bones of the dead, and his plan was eagerly adopted; but
this shocking aliment cost the lives of most of those who
partook of it. In this general desolation, the priests and
monks enjoyed the comforts of abundance; on visiting their
abodes, there was generally enough for the present discovered,
and, in many instances, a good provision for the
future. At length the leaders of the League, to appease the
people, who now never ceased crying, âBread or peace!â
charged the bishop of Paris and the archbishop of Lyons
with proposals to the king. âI am no dissembler,â said the
monarch, âI speak plainly and without deceit what I think.
I should be wrong if I told you I did not wish for a general
peace; I do wish for it, I ardently desire it, that I may
have the power of enlarging and settling the limits of my
kingdom. For a battle I would give a finger, for a general
254

peace I would give two. I love my city of Paris; it is my
eldest daughter; I am jealous of her. I am anxious to confer
upon her more good, more kindness, more pity than she
could ask of me; but I desire that she should owe them to
me and to my clemency, and not to the duke de Mayenne
or the king of Spain. When you ask me to defer the capitulation
and surrender of Paris till a universal peace, which
cannot take place till after many journeys, backwards and
forwards, you ask for a thing highly prejudicial to my city of
Paris, which cannot wait so long. So many persons have
already died of hunger, that if a further delay of ten or
twelve days took place, vast numbers must die, which would
be a great pity (
une Ã©strange pitiÃ©
). I am the father of my
people, and I am like the mother of old before Solomon, I
would almost prefer having no Paris at all to having it ruined
and dissipated by the death of so many Parisians. You,
Monsieur le Cardinal, ought to have pity on them; they are
your flock. I am not a remarkably good theologian; but
I know enough of divinity to be able to tell you that God is
not pleased that you should treat thus the poor people he
has consigned to you. How can you hope to convert me to
your religion, if you set so little store by the safety and
lives of your flock? It is giving me but a poor proof of
your holiness; I am but little edified by it.â

Of all the monarchs that ever lived, we like to hear
Henry IV. of France speak. His words come forth with
that unstudied frankness which proves that they flow from a
manly heart and a right mind. He had his faultsâwhat
human creature has not? but neither the annals of France
nor England describe a king with whom we would rather
have sat in council; have followed his white
panache
in
the battle-field; have crossed the hand of friendship, or
chatted in a ladyâs bower, than with the good, valiant, and
witty BÃ©arnais. We verily think that delightful word of the
French language,
bonhomie
, was coined to express the character
of Henry IV.

âSuch,â says the historian, âwere the words and sentiments
of this generous prince; the evils which oppressed his
people penetrated his compassionate and tender heart. He
could not endure the idea,â says Sully, âof seeing that city,
of which Providence had destined him the empire, become
255

one vast cemetery; he held out his hands to all he could
secretly assist, and shut his eyes upon the supplies of provisions
which his officers and soldiers frequently stole in,
whether out of compassion for relations or friends, or for
the sake of the heavy prices they made the citizens pay for
them.â

He could have carried Paris by the sword; and his
soldiers, the Huguenots in particular, demanded that favour
of him with loud cries; but he resisted all their entreaties.
The duke de Nemours having turned out a vast number of
useless mouths, the council advised the king to refuse them
a passage. Henry, deeply affected by their melancholy fate,
gave orders to let them go where they liked.

âI am not astonished,â said he, âthat the chiefs of the
League, or the Spaniards, should have so little compassion on
these poor people, they are but their tyrants; but as for me,
I am their father and their king, and I cannot behold them
without being moved to my inward heart.â But he was
deceived, if he thought these kindnesses would make any
impression upon the Parisians. They availed themselves of
his benevolence, without ceasing to regard him as the author
of all the public calamities; and when, a short time after,
the prince of Parma and the duke de Mayenne, at the head
of an army, obliged him to pause in his enterprise, they insulted
him who had only raised the siege because he was too
sensible to the misfortunes of the besieged.

Paris persisted in its revolt to the month of March, 1594;
when the duke de Brissac, who had joined the League because
Henry III. had told him that he was good for nothing,
either by land or sea, negotiated with Henry IV. and opened
the gates of Paris to him, for the reward of the baton of a
marshal of France. Henry IV. made his
entrÃ©e
, which only
cost the lives of a small body of lansquenets, and of two or
three citizens, who endeavoured to induce the people to take
up arms against a king who was willing to treat them as a
father.

Of the policy or propriety of Henryâs changing his religion,
to insure the peaceful possession of his throne, it is
not our province to speak.

When Brissac had thrown open the gates, Henryâs troops
marched in in silence, keeping close and careful order, and
256

took possession of the squares, public places, and great
thoroughfares. After the prÃ©vÃ´t des marchands and De
Brissac had presented the keys to him, he advanced at the
head of a large troop of the nobility, with lances lowered:
his march was a triumph, and, from that day, he considered
himself among the Parisians, as in the midst of his children.
âLet them alone!â cried he, to those who wished to drive
back the crowd; âlet them alone! they want to see a king.â
His clemency extended to all classes, even to his worst
enemies, the fanatical preachers. The Spanish garrison
quitted Paris the day of his
entrÃ©e
, with the honours of war;
Philipâs ministers departing with them. The king placed
himself at a window to see them pass, and when they were
at a distance, he laughingly cried to them: âMake my
compliments to your master, gentlemen, but donât come
back any more.â He received the Bastille by capitulation,
welcomed the repentant and submissive Sorbonne, and joined
to the parliament of Paris the magistrates of the parliament
he had established at ChÃ¢lons and Tours.

The ridiculous yet bloody war of the Fronde, though it
maddened and for a time half-starved the Parisians, and
although its two parties were headed by a CondÃ© and a
Turenne, does not furnish us with a regular siege.

HENRY THE FOURTH ENTERS HIS CAPITAL.

SEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1814.

When the inordinate ambition of Buonaparte, and, still
more, his misfortunes in Russia, had banded all Europe
against him, Paris may be said to have again experienced a
short siege.

When Napoleon opened the campaign on the 25th of
January, he confided the command of the capital to his
brother Joseph. His enemies were numerous and powerful.
The English advanced on the south; a hundred and fifty
thousand men, under Schwartzenberg, poured into France
by way of Switzerland; a large army of Prussians, commanded
by Blucher, arrived from Frankfort; and a hundred
thousand Swedes and Germans penetrated into Belgium,
under Bernadotte. Here was work cut out for even the
genius of a Hannibal; and Buonaparte seemed to be duly
roused by the perils which surrounded him. He redoubled
257

his activity and energy, and never had his strategic calculations
been more skilful. He was near destroying the two
most formidable armies of his enemies by isolating them, and
attacking them by turns. But Buonaparteâs successes became
fatal to him, by inspiring him with too much confidence:
he would not listen to the proposals of the allies for France
to return within her ancient limits, and revoked the powers
he had given to the duke of Vicenza to conclude a peace at
ChÃ¢tillon. Wherever he did not command in person, the
allies triumphed: the English entered Bordeaux, which
declared for the Bourbons; the Austrians occupied Lyons;
and the united armies marched towards Paris. Napoleon
then subscribed to the demands of the Congress; but it was
too late: the conferences were broken up. Joseph received
orders to defend Paris to the last extremity; the emperor
depended upon him, and conceived the almost wildly brave
project of cutting off the retreat of the allies, by marching
rapidly behind them to St. Dizier. By this march he lost
precious time; but by it, if he had been seconded, Napoleon
might have saved his crown. The two grand armies of the
allies had effected their junction, and drew near to the
capital. To secure the success of the emperorâs manÅuvres,
it ought to have been defended till his arrival; but timid
councillors surrounded the regent, Maria Louisa, and persuaded
her to retire to the Loire. In vain Talleyrand and
Montalivet expressed a courageous opinion, and represented
to the empress that the safety of France was in Paris: fear
alone was listened to; Maria Louisa quitted the capital, and
transported the regency to Blois. In the mean time Napoleon
approached Paris by forced marches; but it was no
longer time: Marshals Marmont and Mortier, on the 30th
of March, fought a desperate battle under the walls of the
city with forces very inferior to the allies. Ignorant of the
emperorâs proximity, Joseph gave orders for a capitulation;
he abandoned his post, and set out for OrlÃ©ans. On the
31st of March, the allies entered Paris. Napoleon was hastening
to the defence of his capital, when, on the 1st of
April, he received this terrible news; he immediately fell
back upon Fontainebleau, where his army took up a position.
There he learnt that the senate, till that time guilty
of so much servility and adulation towards him, had proclaimed
258

him a tyrant, and that, guided by Talleyrand, it had
declared Napoleon deposed from the throne, the hereditary
right of his family abolished, and the French people and the
army liberated from their oath of fidelity to him.

The capitulation of 1814, and the celebrated day of the
Barricades, July, 1830, do not come under the head of
sieges.

RIMINI.

A.C. 49.

CÃ¦sar
, forgetting his virtues in order to sacrifice everything
to his ambition, prepared to march against his country.
But this was not done without a mental struggle. When
he arrived on the banks of the Rubicon, he was a prey to a
thousand conflicting thoughts; he stopped all at once, and
turning to his friends, said: âWe have it still in our power
to retract; but if we cross this rivulet, the enterprise must
be carried out by force of arms.â According to Suetonius,
there appeared at that moment a man of extraordinary
height, playing upon a rustic flute, and the soldiers flocked
round him to listen to him. This wonderful man, seizing a
trumpet, applied it to his mouth, and sounding a charge,
crossed the river. This was most likely a
ruse
of CÃ¦sarâs to
encourage his troops; be that as it may, he immediately
cried out,ââForward! let us go whither the voice of the
gods and the injustice of our enemies call us;âthe die is
cast!â And he crossed the Rubicon. The short siege and
the capture of Rimini were the consequences of this determination,
followed by the civil war between CÃ¦sar and
Pompey, which annihilated the liberties of Rome.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 538.

Vitiges, king of the Ostrogoths, appeared before Rimini,
and laid siege to it. He brought towards the walls an enormous
tower, at the top of which was a large drawbridge, to
259

be let down when within reach of the parapets. The inhabitants
were in a terrible fright; but the commander
rendered the tower useless by having the ditch widened
during the night; and by a spirited and unexpected attack
upon the enemyâs camp, he raised as much dread among
them as the machine had created in Rimini. Some of the
bravest of the Goths fell in this sortie, and their leader
turned the siege into a blockade. The arrival of Belisarius
compelled him to abandon the enterprise altogether.

MARSEILLES.

A.C. 49.

The
inhabitants of Marseilles being under great obligations
to Pompey, were not willing to open their gates to
CÃ¦sar. Irritated by this affront, CÃ¦sar laid siege to their
city. It was long, because that great general did not at
first conduct it in person; but as soon as he presented himself
before the place, it surrendered. The conqueror was
satisfied with disarming the citizens, and ordering them to
bring to him all the money in the public treasury.

SECOND SIEGE, A.C. 310.

Notwithstanding his repeated abdications, Maximian
Hercules was again anxious for power, and, for the third
time, to remount the throne of the CÃ¦sars. In order to
engage the Gauls to declare in his favour, he caused a report
of the death of Constantine to be circulated. This report
had not time to be accredited, for Constantine, at the head
of a numerous army, presented himself before Marseilles,
into which place Maximian had retired. He at once led on
an assault, and would have taken the city if his ladders had
not proved too short. Several soldiers, however, succeeded
in gaining the top of the walls, but the emperor, to spare the
blood of the troops and of the inhabitants, sounded a retreat.
Maximian appeared upon the walls; Constantine drew near
260

to them, and represented to the ex-emperor the injustice
and futility of his proceedings. Whilst the old man was
pouring forth invectives, some of the inhabitants, unknown
to him, opened one of the gates, and admitted the soldiers of
Constantine. They seized Maximian, led him before the
emperor, and terminated this short and foolish war.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1544.

The constable De Bourbon, wishing by his services to
merit the favour of Charles V., to whom that perfidious
prince had sold himself, undertook the siege of Marseilles.
âThree cannon-shot,â said he, âwill so astonish the good
citizens, that they will come with halters round their necks
to present me the keys.â But, far from surrendering, the
Marseillese swore to defend themselves to the last extremity.
The women took part in the most painful labours of the
defence; their ardour was so great, that the countermines
which they dug on the side of the attack were called, to
perpetuate the memory of the fact, âThe Ladiesâ Trench.â
A cannon-ball, fired from the city, killed two gentlemen, and
a priest who was celebrating mass. The constable De Bourbon,
attracted by the noise created by this accident, hastened
to the spot, and asked what was the cause of the
tumult. The marquis de Pescaira, his rival, coolly replied,ââIt
is only the consuls of Marseilles, Monsieur, who have
brought us the keys.â Bourbon well deserved this raillery,
for they had already been forty days before a place which he
had boasted would surrender as soon as he appeared. Rendered
furious by the cannon-ball and the joke, he gave orders
for the fire of the artillery to be doubled, and soon a breach
was made sufficient for an assault. The engineers who were
sent to reconnoitre reported that there was behind it a deep
ditch, filled with combustibles, and defended by a great
number of soldiers. Pescaira gave a description of it to the
council of war, and added, maliciously,ââYou see, gentlemen,
that the Marseillese keep a well-spread table, in order
to entertain properly all who have any desire to visit them;
if you have any inclination to sup in Paradise, go there, in
heavenâs name; but, for my part, I donât feel disposed to go
thither yet. We should do much better, I think, to return
261

to Italy, where the French may be before us.â The
hatred in which the constable De Bourbon was held caused
this advice to be approved of. Francis I. came to the relief
of the city with an army of forty thousand men. Instructed
in the school of misfortune, he obstinately refused to give
the Imperialists battle, and contented himself with depriving
them of all means of subsistence. His army destroyed all
the mills: that of DâAubagne was the only one left.
Francis I. was convinced that the retreat of his enemy was
inevitable if this mill were destroyed, and he ordered Barbesieux,
who commanded in Marseilles, to undertake it. This
general thought the thing impossible, because the post was
so well guarded and so near to the Imperialists. Montluc,
young, enterprising, and full of resources, thought that,
with courage, secrecy, and diligence, it was possible to succeed.
Barbesieux laughed at what he called a fanfaronnade;
but as it was only at the risk of a hundred and twenty men,
he gave his consent. Everything succeeded; the mill was
forced and destroyed; and the detachment came off unhurt.
This little expedition had a singular influence over the fate
of Marseilles. Deprived of provisions, the Imperialists
quickly retired, and the constable had the double disgrace of
failing against a place whilst fighting against his prince and
his country.

262

ALEXANDRIA.

A.C. 46.

The
conqueror of Darius, wishing to raise a monument
to his own glory, resolved to build a new city in Egypt,
which should become the centre of the commerce of the
world, and the capital of his vast empire. He named it
Alexandria. This was likewise part of the wise policy of
Alexander; either he, or some of the sages who attended him,
were excellent judges of situation for a city, and he preferred
leaving such a monument behind him to any other. He
laid the foundation of, if he did not build, many cities in
the course of his conquests; and this was not the only one
called Alexandria. The happily-selected situation of this
city, not far from the Mediterranean and the Nile, in the
centre of Egypt, then renowned for its commercial relations
with India and the oriental coasts of Africa, soon rendered
it worthy of its high destiny. Under Ptolemy, son of
Lagus, one of his lieutenants, who had become his successor
in the kingdom of Egypt, Alexandria soon astonished the
world by its population and its riches. The Romans, extending
their conquests, became first the protectors, then
the masters of Egypt. Antiochus, king of Syria, wished to
oppress the children of Ptolemy Philopater, and to take
possession of Egypt; the Roman people, offended at this
proceeding, sent Popilius LÃ¦nus to summon the king of
Syria to immediately evacuate the states of a king, their
ally. He came up with Antiochus as he was besieging
Alexandria, and ordered him to evacuate Egypt immediately.
As soon as he saw the Roman ambassador, Antiochus saluted
him with much respect, but made no direct reply to his
demand. Popilius went straight up to him, and tracing a
circle around the king in the sand, âPrince,â said he, âI
must have an answer to the will of the Roman people before
you leave that circle.â Astonished at this noble pride,
263

Antiochus replied that he was ready to obey. Thus Egypt
was delivered from war. Respect for the Roman name
alone gave it, for this once, peace, and preserved it its
sovereigns.

After having defeated Pompey, CÃ¦sar entered Alexandria,
to endeavour to regulate the affairs of Egypt, then embroiled
by the ambition of Cleopatra. During his abode there,
Achilles, minister of King Ptolemy, disgusted at his proceedings,
raised an army of twenty thousand disciplined
Egyptian troops, and offered battle to the great dictator.
CÃ¦sar had only three thousand foot and eight thousand
horse. Without giving a momentâs consideration to his
weakness, and relying entirely on his constant good fortune,
he made a sortie from Alexandria, where the Egyptians besieged
him, and drove them to a distance from the walls.
He fought several battles with the same results, but, weakened
in the end by his own successes,âfor, though victorious,
he in each conflict necessarily lost some men,âhe ceased to
be the conqueror. It was in the course of this war that the
celebrated Alexandrian library was burnt, the collecting of
which had been the work of many kings, and consisted of
more than four hundred thousand volumes. It was likewise
after a contest in which he had been worsted, that he had
to swim for his life, which he did with one hand, holding, it
is said, his âCommentariesâ in the other. CÃ¦sar did not
escape the fascinations of Cleopatra: as she did by all who
came within the circle of her machinations, she made him
subservient to her ambitious views: she had one son by
him, named CÃ¦sarion, afterwards sacrificed to the jealousy
of Augustus. After passing through many dangers, he
received succour, and was triumphant; he defeated the
Egyptians, under their king Ptolemy Bacchus, who drowned
himself in the Nile.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 260.

Under Gallus, Alexandria, whose population amounted to
three hundred thousand freemen, and as many slaves, became
the theatre of a frightful civil war, which lasted twelve
years. All communication was cut off between the different
parts of that unfortunate city; every street was inundated
264

with blood; the major part of the better sort of houses were
converted into citadels, and these horrible disorders were
not appeased till after most of the inhabitants had perished
by the sword, pestilence, or famine.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 611.

ChosroÃ«s, eleventh king of Persia, after having conquered
Syria, Palestine, and the greater part of Asia, attacked
Egypt, surprised Pelusium, and advanced as far as Alexandria
without obstacle. The city might certainly have
been supported by its fleet, but the archbishop and prefect
had employed all the vessels in carrying themselves and
their enormous wealth to a place of safety in the isle of
Cyprus. ChosroÃ«s entered this second city of the Greek
empire in triumph, and found in it almost incalculable riches.
Heraclius sued for peace, which ChosroÃ«s granted, but only
with a view of preparing for a fresh war. This recommenced
in 627. The haughty ChosroÃ«s was conquered; his
own son caused him to be killed, and restored to the emperor
Heraclius all his fatherâs conquests. Thus Egypt returned,
but for a very short time, under the Roman domination.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 640.

Mahomet, who was destined to subdue, by his arms and
his religion, half the globe as then known, had made himself
master of Arabia. His successors thought it their duty to
extend his opinions and his conquests. Amrou, the lieutenant
of the caliph Omar, took possession of Palestine, and entered
Egypt. He employed thirty days in the siege of Pelusium,
and then advanced to the ruins of Heliopolis. Thence he
proceeded to ancient Memphis, called the Widow of her
Kings, after she was eclipsed by her rival Alexandria: her
palaces and temples were sinking into ruins. The two
banks of the Nile, here three thousand feet wide, were
united by two bridges of sixty-three boats, connected by
the little isle of Honda, standing in the middle of the river,
and covered with gardens and delightful habitations. At
the eastern extremity of the bridge was the city of Babylon,
and the camp of a Roman legion defended the passage of
265

the river and the second city of Egypt. Amrou laid siege
to this fortress, which might be considered as a part of
Memphis. After a siege of seven months, the place was
carried by assault. The Greeks, on retiring from Upper
Egypt, occupied all the important places of the Delta, but
were driven out of them in twenty-two days by Amrou. At
length Amrou commenced the siege of Alexandria. This
first commercial city in the world was abundantly supplied
with all the means of defence and subsistence: the sea was
always open to it. If Heraclius could have been roused from
his lethargy, considerable reinforcements might have been
sent to support the besieged. Alexandria itself furnished
excellent means of defence; the two great sides of the long
square which it forms being covered by the sea and the lake
Mareotis, the fronts of attack were narrow, and easily
defended. Amrou, however, never ceased to excite the
courage of the besiegers by sending them fresh reinforcements
daily. The Egyptians at the same time, tired of the
domination of the Greeks, and believing they should be better
treated by new masters, devoted themselves to the service of
Amrou. The Saracens fought like lions. In every conflict
the scimitar and the banner of Amrou were in the first rank;
he made all the reconnaissances of the place with his own
eyes, and planned all the attacks. Approaching one day,
accompanied only by a single slave and one of his principal
officers, too near the walls, he was taken prisoner, and conducted
to the presence of the prefect of Egypt. This
magistrate, on examining his haughty countenance and
hearing his audacious language, at first entertained a suspicion,
which became a certainty, that it was Amrou he had
fortunately become possessed of, and ordered him to be
beheaded. This order was about to be executed, when the
slave, who understood Greek, gave him a box on the ear,
and told him that he, one of the meanest of Mussulmans,
ought to know how to behave more respectfully to his superiors.
This extraordinary act of presence of mind saved the
life of Amrou. The Turkish officer, taking his cue from
the slave, then said that they were sent by their general to
demand an interview, and that if it could be granted the
next day, and the Romans would make any reasonable proposals,
he had no doubt peace might be brought about.
266

The governor was the dupe of this story. The prefect, being
now persuaded that Amrou was no more than a simple
soldier, revoked his order, and sent back the Mussulmans,
who had come, he believed, with pacific dispositions. The
Romans were soon made aware of their folly by the cries of
joy of the Mussulmans at the safe return of their brave
general. Instead of coming to the peaceful appointment
next day, Amrou appeared with all his troops at the foot of
the wall, and commenced the labours of the siege. Heraclius
then sent him an ambassador, to prevail upon him to leave
Egypt, upon very advantageous conditions. Amrou, who
was superintending the construction of machines to batter
the great tower, surveyed the envoy with surprise and contempt.
After listening to him in profound silence, âDost
thou see,â said he, âthat column which stands before us?
We will leave Egypt when thou hast swallowed it.â On
the instant he commanded an attack upon the tower, and
his soldiers entered it, in spite of the brave resistance of the
Romans. The governor, however, sent up such strong reinforcements,
that the Mussulmans were driven for the time
from the tower they were so anxious to obtain. During
fourteen months, every day was marked by combats or
attacks upon the intrenchments. At length Amrou gave a
general assault, and his troops responded so well to his
expectations and generalship, that the Christians were beaten
in all quarters, and abandoned the place. The Turks lost
twenty-five thousand men before Alexandria. At the moment
of their entry into the city, the inhabitants, to escape
their barbarities, endeavoured to gain their vessels and get
out to sea. Amrou pursued them, leaving only troops
enough in Alexandria for a common guard. Informed of
this circumstance, the Romans re-entered the port, surprised
the city, and massacred the Mussulmans. On learning this,
Amrou returned, found the Romans masters of the citadel,
attacked them, and forced them, after a sanguinary conflict.
Such as escaped death then abandoned to its barbarous conquerors
this powerful city, the magazine of Constantinople,
which it fed, and the centre of the commerce of the East
with Europe. Egypt submitted to the conqueror. âI have
taken,â said Amrou, in his despatch to the caliph, âthe
great city of the West; it is impossible for me to describe
267

to you all its riches, all its magnificence; I shall content
myself with telling you that it contains four thousand palaces,
four thousand baths, four hundred theatres, twelve thousand
shops for vegetables and fruits, and forty thousand tributary
Jews. The city was taken by force, without either treaty
or capitulation, and the Mussulmans are impatient to gather
the fruits of their victories.â The commander of the
faithful rejected with firmness all ideas of pillage, and
ordered his lieutenant to preserve Alexandria and its wealth
for the use and propagation of Islamism. Amrou asked him
if he must equally respect the famous library of Serapeon,
containing more than five hundred thousand volumes, the
only archives of the learning of the ancient Egyptians, and
of the progress of human knowledge up to the invasion of
the Mussulmans. To this the caliph replied: âEither that
which the books of which thou speakest contain, agrees
with the Koran, or it does not agree. If it agrees with it,
the Koran suffices; if it does not agree, they are pernicious:
burn them.â Amrou obeyed with regret. During six
months the fragments of these books served to heat the
baths of Alexandria. This irreparable loss deprived the
human race of a mass of useful knowledge, dried up an
abundant source of improvement, and contributed greatly to
the spreading of the darkness and ignorance in which Europe
was plunged for six hundred years.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.C. 645.

Alexandria was tranquil under the government of its conqueror,
but after the death of Omar, Amrou was recalled.
The Greek emperors feeling keenly the loss of Egypt, took
advantage of this circumstance to make a descent upon its
coasts. At the sight of their ancient compatriots, the Alexandrians
rose, took up arms, drove out the infidels, and
opened their gates to the Greeks. Amrou, being informed
of this revolt, returned from Libya, chastised Alexandria,
and drove the Christians from its walls. Persuaded that
such an example would be sufficient to restrain the Egyptians,
he again set out for Tripoli; but the Greeks returned
once more, and took possession of the port and the city of
Alexandria. Amrou, exceedingly irritated, came back; but
268

he had sworn, this time, to dismantle this indocile city. He
kept his word; he protected the Alexandrians as much as he
could from the fury of the soldiery; but he razed the walls,
diminished its extent, and left the inhabitants to exist amidst
the ruins of their country.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.D. 1171.

Egypt belonged for three centuries to the Fatimite
caliphs; but this race degenerated: divided among themselves
for the possession of power, one of its two branches
had the imprudence to call in the sultan of Damascus to its
aid. After several battles, the latter was the conqueror, but
he kept his conquest for himself. Saladin, his son, became,
in 1171, sultan of Egypt. The descendants of this great man
were, in their turn, displaced by the Mamelukes and their
beys, a singular kind of militia, continually recruited by
slaves from Mount Caucasus; themselves choosing their
sultans, as the prÃ¦torian guards had done, and, like them,
disposing of power. Egypt was conquered by the Ottomans.
Selim I. contented himself with weakening, for the time,
the influence of the Mamelukes; but, always ambitious, they
resumed, by degrees, their authority under his weak successors,
and only left the Ottoman Porte a shadow of power in
the provinces over which they tyrannized.

SEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1799.

Buonaparte, imitating Alexander, with a view of clearing
a passage from Egypt to the possession of India,
embarked with a large force, and after having treacherously
obtained Malta, appeared off Alexandria. It is rather a
singular circumstance, that more than a century before this
expedition took place, Leibnitz, a German philosopher,
addressed a long and interesting document to Louis XIV.,
pointing out to him the great advantages that would result
to France from the conquest of Egypt. This document was
still in existence, and it is believed that it assisted in inducing
Buonaparte to leave his European conquests and achieve
something extraordinary in the East. His career in Egypt
was successful, and, among other places, he took Alexandria,
269

our present subject; but there was nothing in the details of
the short siege of it interesting enough to stop us. Nelsonâs
defeat of his fleet, and his check by Sir Sidney Smith, at
Acre, sent the great conqueror of the age back again to his
country, with a far smaller crop of laurels than he had
anticipated.

LYONS.

A.D. 197.

Albinus
, a Roman general, revolted against the emperor
Severus, and encamped his rebel troops near Lyons. The
emperor marched against him, and the battle commenced the
instant the armies came in sight of each other. The conflict
was terrible, but Albinus was conquered, and forced to take
refuge in Lyons. The conquerors followed him thither, and
plundered and ravaged the city. Albinus, finding all was
lost, plunged his sword into his own body; but as he was
not dead when the adverse party took Lyons, they enjoyed
the savage satisfaction of cutting off the head of a man who
could not have lived an hour.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1793.

The majority of the Lyonnais had witnessed the revolution
of the 10th of August with great regret. Devoted
to commerce and the arts, Lyons must necessarily have preferred
a stable and tranquil government to the storms of a
revolution. Political agitations, the emigration of the nobles,
the proscriptions of the rich, were at every instant drying
up the springs of its commerce, paralyzing its industry, and
deteriorating the products of its manufactures. When
private interests were thus injured, it could not be expected
that the Lyonnais should feel much revolutionary ardour;
they were certain to follow the ideas of the most moderate
party. The Convention was recognised, the Republic proclaimed;
but the rich trembled at the opening of the clubs;
270

they were terrified at seeing municipal powers pass into the
hands of proletaires; their minds revolted at hearing propositions
for murder and carnage, the reward of their generosity
in paying a loan of many millions. Their horror for
the men who oppressed them was soon displaced by a desire
for vengeance. Two parties declared themselves in Lyons:
that of the Municipals, supported by the
Montagne
; and that
of the Sections, composed of pure republicans and disguised
royalists. Both sides assembled, and both spoke of preparations
for defence and of measures for attack. Each party
designated its enemies, watched its partisans, exaggerated
its injuries and causes of alarm; minds were heated, and
hearts divided. People became accustomed to consider as
irreconcilable enemies all who did not embrace the opinions
of the party they had espoused. The storm, which had been
growling for a length of time, burst forth on the 29th of
May, 1793. Two commissioners from the Convention were
sitting with ChÃ¢lier at the municipality; they had made a
place of arms of it. On their side, the Sectionaries had
gathered together all their columns. There were three
attempts at accommodation, but they all failed through the
perfidy of ChÃ¢lier. A battalion of the Lyonnais approached
the municipality, sent for under the pretence of conciliation.
The signal for carnage was given; ChÃ¢lier ordered a discharge
of artillery and musketry. The unfortunate Lyonnais
were obliged to abandon the bodies of their friends;
the whole city was in arms. Two columns left the Place de
Bellecourt, and besieged the HÃ´tel de Ville, defended by
eighteen hundred men and two pieces of cannon; the besiegers
did not amount to two thousand. The combat lasted
two hours; the HÃ´tel de Ville was carried. The Lyonnais
had in their power the men who appeared to have meditated
their ruin. There was still more carnage after the victory;
the soldiers were obliged to defend their prisoners against
the fury of the people. Among them were the two commissioners
from the Convention; but liberty was soon restored
to them, on condition of their giving an honest account of
the provocations which had brought on the combat. These
representatives, four days after, notwithstanding a favourable
account had been given, described the Lyonnais to the Convention
as rebels, and demanded vengeance for the national
271

representation having been unacknowledged, degraded, and
insulted in their persons. In the mean time, the Lyonnais
had chosen fresh magistrates, and these had created a commission
to try the prisoners made in the contest on the 29th
of May. ChÃ¢lier was condemned to death; the rest were
spared, and kept as hostages. The Lyonnais endeavoured
at this moment to prove their love for their country, by concurring
with all their power for the defence of the frontiers.
Kellermann, the general of the army of the Alps, demanded
of this city some pieces of artillery and articles of provisions.
Although threatened with a siege, the Lyonnais were moved
by the wants of the very soldiers who were soon to be employed
against them. Kellermann was so affected by such
kindness, that he became their constant intercessor, but one
that was never listened to. Two untoward events then
happened which accelerated the misfortunes of the Lyonnais.
The moderate party had been crushed in the Convention
by the 31st of May. Marseilles sent an army to the
succour of Lyons, on the very day when treachery, conducted
with great art, had given Toulon up to the English.
It was feared, for a moment, that the whole south of France
would detach itself from the north, and that Lyons would
make common cause with Marseilles and Toulon, and all
give themselves up to foreigners. Kellermann despatched
Carteau against the Marseillais, with a body of troops very
inferior in numbers to theirs, but which was to be recruited

en route
, with the national guards and the volunteers of the
country. Carteau followed the left bank of the RhÃ´ne,
secured the bridge of St. Esprit and Avignon, met the Marseillais
army at Salon, and afterwards at SeptÃªmes, where he
entirely defeated them. The succours expected from the
south by the Lyonnais were thus annihilated. Lyons made
some efforts at conciliation; a deputy replied to them in
these words: âRebels, confess your crime, open your gates,
show yourselves obedient, be disarmed, and prove yourselves,
by your repentance, worthy of the clemency of the Convention.â
The Lyonnais had no faith in this clemency, and
could not avert the storm: the siege was resolved upon.
Kellermann, then called from the army of the Alps, brought,
with much regret, the greater part of it to act against the
second city of France. The rivalry and jealousy of the
272

neighbouring cities, with the obedience of the country to the
orders of the Convention, soon augmented this army; sixty
thousand men surrounded Lyons, of which fifteen thousand
were disciplined troops. The besiegers received a hundred
pieces of cannon, which were served by skilful gunners.
Kellermann, according to the system of the time, had with
him two commissioners from the Convention, Dubois-CrancÃ©
and Gauthier. During civil troubles, party animosities are
more ardent in councils than in camps; the rigour of political
principles there yields more easily to the generous
sentiments which a military life establishes reciprocally
between soldier and soldier. Kellermann endeavoured for a
long time to bend the inflexibility of the commissioners; he
could not succeed. In the mean time, the Lyonnais never
ceased to express their devotion to the National Convention;
they accepted the constitution of 1793 in primary assemblies,
they celebrated the anniversary of the 10th of August, burnt
all feudal titles, and invited Kellermann to be present at that
fÃªte. They kept up with him a regular correspondence,
although they refused to hold any with the Conventional
commissioners; they sought to reunite themselves with the
neighbouring departments; but terror had combined all the
inhabitants against them. At length, on receiving the last
propositions of the Conventional deputies, which were equivalent
to surrendering themselves at discretion, they replied:
âCitizens, representatives of the people, your propositions
are still more atrocious than your conduct; we await you;
you will not reach us but over heaps of slain, or the cause of
liberty and the republic will triumph.â From that time all
hope of accommodation vanished; the parties prepared for
attack and defence. Warlike enthusiasm fired every heart
in Lyons; the young man who would not have devoted
himself to all the dangers of the good cause, would have been
expelled from his family as well as from the city. Women
appeared upon the breach; a public military chest was
formed. The insufficiency of the current coin was covered
by the notes of the principal merchants; a considerable
quantity of provisions of all kinds was brought in, at great
expense, but by no means abundant enough for so immense
a population. Lyons, situated at the confluence of the SaÃ´ne
and the RhÃ´ne, is dominated on the north by the heights
273

which cover a part of its faubourgs; an engineer named
Chennelette traced a plan for redoubts over all this front:
they were erected with astonishing celerity. The houses
were embattlemented, batteries were built, artillery was
cast, powder was manufactured; everything denoted a determination
for a vigorous resistance. All who held in
Lyons either administrative or military posts, knew that
there existed no capitulation for them; and they prepared
for defence to the death.

The part of the city situated on the south was occupied
by the rich commercial houses; the RhÃ´ne covered all this
front; but, on the opposite side, the bank is uncovered; the
buildings, badly protected by the batteries erected on the
quay of the RhÃ´ne, were left exposed to the destructive fire
which the besiegers would soon direct against them. The

corps dâarmÃ©e
of the Centre, commanded by Kellermann,
formed the principal attack to the east of the isthmus,
between the union of the RhÃ´ne and the SaÃ´ne, at the faubourg
of La Croix-Rousse. On the north, the quarter of
FouviÃ¨res, comprised in the great creek formed by the
course of the waters of the SaÃ´ne, was attacked by the faubourg
of Vaise. Another attack at the confluence of the
two rivers confined the besieged within the lands newly
recovered from the waters by the engineer Purache. The
besieging troops were established in the villages of Oullins
and Sainte-Foi. In the latter days of the siege, the approaches
came up to the point of the isthmus, and the
batteries of the besiegers cut off all that part of the city
from the inhabitants. On the south, upon the left bank of
the RhÃ´ne, which defended that front, batteries for bombs
and firing red-hot shot were placed. Lyons had armed
about twenty-five thousand men, commanded by PrÃ«cy, an
old soldier, Virieu, an ex-constituent, and Nervo. The
civil and administrative authorities, who necessarily took a
great part in the resolutions formed, and even in the operations,
were not admitted entirely into the secrets of the
military leaders, and the threads of the correspondences
which were maintained out of the city were not in their
hands: there the insurrection was combined with the movements
of the enemiesâ armies in Savoy. It was proposed
that the Prussians and Austrians should drive the French
274

from the lines of Weissemberg, whilst a
corps dâarmÃ©e
, commanded
by the prince de CondÃ©, should surprise Huninguen,
cross Franche-ComtÃ© without stopping for sieges, and should
advance towards Lyons. But the ill-success of the preceding
year had made these powers circumspect upon such bold
questions. This movement failed, as did another, which was
to originate in an auxiliary gathering of emigrants, got
together in Switzerland. The Helvetic body persisted in its
neutrality, and refused to allow the passage of these troops.
The Lyonnais had taken up important military positions;
their posts advanced considerably beyond the extent of the
city, so as to favour their communications with Montbrison
and Saint-Etienne, whence they drew their provisions. They
occupied the bridge of Oullins, at a league from Lyons, with
the heights of Sainte-Foi and those of La Croix-Rousse.

It was with great reluctance that the national battalions
gathered around Lyons and turned their arms against their
fellow-citizens. In the first council of war assembled at the
commencement of the siege, all voices inclined towards conciliation,
and were against force and violence. The representative
commissioners, armed with the decree of the
National Convention, were obliged to exert all the preponderance
of their terrible authority. General Kellermann
told them in writing, that, whilst deferring to their requisition,
he charged himself with no responsibility. The siege
was rather a surrounding attack, than a system carried
through according to the rules of art. The Lyonnais, to
protect their houses from the fire of the besiegers, had carried
their exterior works very far out; they had taken
advantage of every building for placing posts and cannon.
All these posts were daily attacked, defended, taken, disputed,
and retaken. In these combats in detail, the losses
were equal, the success balanced, and the results nothing.
The persistency of the Lyonnais leaders was supported by
the hope and expectation of a powerful diversion, to be
effected by the Piedmontese army. This army, by a general
movement upon its whole front, had descended from the
mountains which separate Savoy from Piedmont, and had
effected an invasion in Faussigny, Tarantasia, and Mauritta.
The army of the Alps being weakened, had retired. Lyons
might hope to be some day relieved by the approach of a
275

foreign army. The situation of the French army in Savoy
became so embarrassing, that Kellermann was obliged to
leave the conducting of the siege to General Du Muy. A
few days sufficed for repulsing the Piedmontese. The Convention
at this time ordered that Lyons should be set fire
to. During several days and nights, the batteries of the three
attacks, east, north, and south, poured upon the city a deluge
of fire; bombs and red-hot balls carried fire and destruction
into all quarters; the public establishments and the beautiful
houses of Bellecourt were either battered down by balls
or consumed by fire; the quarter of Saint-Clair was the
first exposed to the conflagration. Every one was on the
watch; all were united in Lyons to endeavour to stop the
progress of it. A general cry of horror and indignation
arose when the arsenal was seen to be on fire. More than a
hundred houses were consumed; magazines of munitions and
forage became the prey of the flames. This disaster appeared
to be not the effect of the bombs, but the crime of
some base incendiary. During the bombardment, traitors
gave signals to point out the best places at which to aim.
We tremble to relate an instance of a new species of crime.
A man bearing the title of a representative of the people,
caused bombs to be showered upon the HÃ´tel-Dieu,âof all
the hospitals in France, the one which was perhaps the best
conducted. In this asylum, the wounded belonging to the
city, and those who were taken prisoners, received equal
attention,âa touching lesson of humanity for the Conventional
commissioners, who never failed to have all the rebels
shot who fell into their hands. The Lyonnais could not
believe that there was premeditation in this fire. They
hoisted a black flag over the hospital; but instead of averting
the bombs, this signal seemed only to attract them. At
this period, the besieged began to be sensible of the horrors
of famine, their connection with Le Forez being then cut
off. The mills having been destroyed by the bombardment,
the women proposed that all the barley or wheaten bread
should be reserved for the combatants, whilst they should be
satisfied with half a pound of oaten bread delivered to them
daily. Very soon everything eatable was exhausted. Reduced
to this cruel extremity, the besieged thought to gain
relief by sending from their walls all the persons useless for
276

the defence of the city. A colleague of Dubois-CranÃ©e
committed an act of inhumanity scarcely credible: his own
sister, an inhabitant of Lyons, came to the camp of the
besiegers, exhausted by hunger and followed by her family.
âLet her go back,â cried the Conventional commissioner,ââlet
her go back and ask the rebels for bread!â

The reiterated efforts of the besiegers rendered them
masters of La Croix-Rousse, which dominates over the city
very closely. Fresh requisitions had collected new battalions
of national guards in the department of the SaÃ´ne.
An army was formed of these, which pressed the works at
the point of the isthmus towards Oullins and Sainte-Foi.
These reinforcements placed the army in a condition to
attempt a general attack in open day upon the two fronts of
the west and the south. The besiegers gained possession of
the two quarters of the Point Perrache and the Brotteaux,
and set fire to them before they retired. At this period also,
the Lyonnais lost all hopes of receiving succours from the
Piedmontese; General Kellermann had succeeded, by skilful
manÅuvres, in driving them back over Mont-Cenis. This
advantage decided the fate of Lyons; the Conventional
commissioners conveyed the news into the city with a proclamation.
The public misfortunes, the sufferings from
famine, the fatigues of the service, the carelessness of the
people in a quarrel in which the leaders were the only persons
threatened, together with lassitude, had changed the minds
of the multitude. The sections of Lyons assembled; they
insisted upon hearing the reading of the proclamation; and
named commissioners to enter into negotiations. The
leaders of the enterprise felt that it was time to yield. PrÃ«cy
and Virieu, accompanied by three thousand men, whom
necessity or the just fear for the future attached to them,
marched out by the gate of Vaise. Their purpose was, to
keep along the banks of the SaÃ´ne for a time, to cross it at
Riottier, and to advance towards the frontiers of Switzerland
through the department of LâAin. But the Conventionalists
were aware of this project. The weak remains of
the Lyonnais army at first met with but few obstacles; but
they were soon pursued by large bodies of cavalry: their
retreat became a disorderly flight; they threw themselves
into the thickest woods; instead of rejoicing in their silence,
277

the sound of the tocsin came upon their ears from all parts,
and that was for them the tocsin of death. Countrymen,
armed with forks and scythes, surrounded every issue of the
forests, waited for, and massacred men already conquered by
hunger and despair. The column led by M. de Virieu was
entirely destroyed, and not more than fifty or sixty escaped
of that of PrÃ«cy. The next day, the 9th of October, the
republican army took possession of all the abandoned posts
of Lyons, which city it entered without opposition. The
Convention decreed that the walls and public buildings
should be destroyed, and the name of the city changed to

Ville Affranchie
. Of three thousand five hundred and
twenty-eight of the insurgents, as they were called, who
were brought to trial on account of this siege, one thousand
six hundred and eighty-two were either shot or beheaded.
In 1794, however, on the destruction of the faction of the
Jacobins, the Convention decreed that the city should resume
its ancient name, and that measures should be taken to
restore its manufactures and commerce. In 1795, the friends
of those who were so wantonly put to death in 1793, revenged
their fate by a general massacre of the judges of the
revolutionary tribunal, and of all the Jacobins who were
then confined in the prisons of Lyons.

278

PALMYRA.

A.D. 273.

Palmyra
, with its transitory splendour, and its total
annihilation, its association with two extraordinary men,âLonginus
and Odenathus, and perhaps a still more extraordinary
woman,âZenobia, has been the subject of the poetâs
song, the theme of the historian, and a source of deep reflection
for the statesman or the philosopher. The history of
Palmyra is a short but highly interesting episode in the
annals of mankind, illustrated, in the course of a very few
years, by the valour and ability of Odenathus, the wisdom
and cultivated taste of Longinus, and the splendid beauty,
great talents, and masculine mind of Zenobia. As it is said
the sun of the glory of Thebes rose and set with Epaminondas,
so the splendour of Palmyra is so connected with
the name of Zenobia, that they seem to us to have been
entirely co-existent; we look at the nascent prosperity of
Palmyra before her birth, as a preparation for her future fortune;
and we contemplate the vast ruins of the city as so
many monuments remaining undestroyed to perpetuate her
memory. No great city was ever so completely identified
with a person as Palmyra with Zenobia.

Of the siege itself, even Gibbon has given but a meagre
account; and yet, what reader would have pardoned us, if
we had neglected to notice the fall of the gorgeous capital
of the Queen of the East?

Palmyra was one of those great commercial entrepÃ´ts
which became important by natural position. Before the
great maritime discoveries, an oasis in the deserts which
divided the East from the West, as soon as commerce began
to flourish, or the power of the West to desire the luxuries
of the East, was certain to be wealthy if the industry of
the inhabitants responded to its natural advantages. The
destruction of the temples of Palmyra might be due to the
279

cruel vengeance of Aurelian; but the neglect of the commercial
position is owing to the rise of Venice and other
trading nations, in the middle ages, and the great maritime
and scientific discoveries of modern times.

As we cannot hope to improve upon the great author of
âThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,â we shall give
most of this short siege in his own words.

âAfter the victories of Trajan, the little republic, grown
wealthy by its commerce, sunk peaceably into the bosom of
Rome, and flourished more than one hundred and fifty years
in the subordinate, though honourable rank of a colony. It
was during that peaceful period, if we may judge from a few
remaining inscriptions, that the wealthy Palmyrenians constructed
those temples, palaces, and porticos of Grecian
architecture, whose ruins, scattered over an extent of several
miles, have deserved the curiosity of our travellers. The
elevation of Odenathus and Zenobia appeared to reflect new
splendour on their country, and Palmyra, for a while, stood
forth the rival of Rome; but the competition was fatal, and
ages of prosperity were sacrificed to a moment of glory.

âModern Europe has produced several women who have
sustained with glory the weight of empire; but if we except
the doubtful achievements of Semiramis, Zenobia is perhaps
the only female whose superior genius broke through the
servile indolence imposed on her sex by the climate and
manners of Asia. She claimed her descent from the Macedonian
kings of Egypt, equalled in beauty her ancestor
Cleopatra, and far surpassed that princess in chastity and
valour. Zenobia was esteemed the most lovely as well as
the most heroic of her sex. She was of dark complexion
(for in speaking of ladies, such things are not trifles), her
teeth were of pearly whiteness, and her large black eyes
sparkled with uncommon fire, tempered with the most
attractive sweetness. Her voice was strong and harmonious;
her understanding was strengthened and adorned by study;
she was not ignorant of the Latin tongue, but possessed in
equal perfection the Greek, the Syriac, and the Egyptian
languages. She had drawn up for her own use an epitome
of Oriental history, and familiarly compared the beauties
of Homer and Plato, under the tuition of the sublime
Longinus.

280

âThis accomplished woman gave her hand to Odenathus,
who, from a private station, raised himself to the dominion
of the East. She soon became the friend and companion of
a hero. In the intervals of war, Odenathus passionately
delighted in the exercise of hunting; he pursued with ardour
the wild beasts of the desertâlions, panthers, and bears;
and the ardour of Zenobia in that dangerous amusement
was not inferior to his own. She had inured her constitution
to fatigue, disdained the use of a covered carriage,
generally appeared on horseback in a military habit, and
sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of the
troops. The success of Odenathus was in a great measure
ascribed to her incomparable prudence and fortitude. Their
splendid victories over the Great King, whom they twice
pursued as far as the gates of Ctesiphon, laid the foundation
of their united fame and power. The armies which they
commanded, and the provinces which they had saved, acknowledged
not any other sovereigns than their invincible
chiefs. The senate and people of Rome revered a stranger
who had avenged their captive emperor; and even the
insensible son of Valerian accepted Odenathus for his legitimate
colleague.

âAfter a successful expedition against the Gothic plunderers
of Asia, the Palmyrenian prince returned to the city
Emessa, in Syria. Invincible in war, he was there cut off by
domestic treason, and his favourite amusement of hunting
was the cause, or at least the occasion, of his death. His
nephew MÃ¦onius presumed to dart his javelin before that
of his uncle; and, though admonished of his error, repeated
the same freedom. As a monarch, and as a sportsman,
Odenathus was provoked, took away his horse, a mark of
ignominy, and chastised the rash youth by a short confinement.

âThe offence was soon forgotten, but the punishment was
remembered; and MÃ¦onius, with a few daring associates,
assassinated his uncle in the midst of a great entertainment.
Herod, the son of Odenathus, though not of Zenobia, a young
man of a soft and effeminate temper, was killed with his
father. But MÃ¦onius obtained only the pleasure of revenge
by this bloody deed. He had scarcely time to assume
the title of Augustus, before he was sacrificed by Zenobia to
the memory of her husband.

281

âWith the assistance of his most faithful friends, she immediately
filled the vacant throne, and governed with manly
counsels, Palmyra, Syria, and the East, above five years.
By the death of Odenathus, the authority was at an end
which the senate had granted him only as a personal distinction;
but his martial widow, disdaining both the senate
and Gallienus, obliged one of the Roman generals who was
sent against her, to retreat into Europe, with the loss of his
army and his reputation. Instead of the petty passions
which so frequently perplex a female reign, the steady administration
of Zenobia was guided by the most judicious
maxims of policy. If it was expedient to pardon, she could
calm her resentment; if it was necessary to punish, she
could impose silence on the voice of pity. Her strict
economy was accused of avarice; yet, on every proper occasion,
she appeared magnificent and liberal. The neighbouring
states of Arabia, Armenia, and Persia dreaded her
enmity and solicited her alliance. To the dominions of
Odenathus, which extended from the Euphrates to the
frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the inheritance of
her ancestors, the populous and fertile kingdom of Egypt.
The emperor Claudius acknowledged her merit, and was
content that, while
he
pursued the Gothic war,
she
should
assert the dignity of the empire in the East. The conduct,
however, of Zenobia was attended with some ambiguity; nor
is it unlikely that she had conceived the design of erecting
an independent and hostile monarchy. She blended with
the popular manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of
the courts of Asia, and exacted from her subjects the same
adoration that was paid to the successors of Cyrus. She
bestowed on her three sons a Latin education, and often
showed them to the troops adorned with the imperial purple.
For herself she reserved the diadem, with the splendid but
doubtful title of Queen of the East.

âWhen Aurelian passed over into Asia, against an adversary
whose sex alone could render her an object of contempt,
his presence restored obedience to the provinces of Bithynia,
already shaken by the arms and intrigues of Zenobia. Advancing
at the head of his legions, he accepted the submission
of Aucyra, and was admitted into Tyana, after an obstinate
siege, by the help of a treacherous citizen. The
282

generous though fierce temper of Aurelian abandoned the
traitor to the rage of the soldiers: a superstitious reverence
induced him to treat with lenity the countrymen of Apollonius,
the philosopher. Antioch was deserted on his approach,
till the emperor, by his salutary edicts, recalled the fugitives,
and granted a general pardon to all who, from necessity
rather than choice, had been engaged in the service of the
Palmyrenian queen. The unexpected mildness of such a
conduct reconciled the minds of the Syrians, and, as far as
the gates of Emessa, the wishes of the people seconded the
terror of his arms.

âZenobia would have ill deserved her reputation, had she
indolently permitted the emperor of the West to approach
within a hundred miles of her capital. The fate of the
East was decided in two great battles; so similar in almost
every circumstance, that we can scarcely distinguish them
from each other, except by observing that the first was
fought near Antioch, and the second near Emessa. In both,
the queen of Palmyra animated the armies by her presence,
and devolved the execution of her orders on Zabdas, who
had already signalized his military talents by the conquest
of Egypt. The numerous forces of Zenobia consisted, for
the most part, of light archers and of heavy cavalry, clothed
in complete steel. The Moorish and Illyrian horse of
Aurelian were unable to sustain the ponderous charge of
their antagonists. They fled in real or affected disorder,
engaged the Palmyrenians in a laborious pursuit, harassed
them by a desultory combat, and at length discomfited this
impenetrable but unwieldy body of cavalry. The light
infantry, in the mean time, when they had exhausted their
quivers, remaining without protection against a closer onset,
exposed their naked sides to the swords of the legions.
Aurelian had chosen these veteran troops, who were usually
stationed on the Upper Danube, and whose valour had been
severely tried in the Alemannic war. After the defeat of
Emessa, Zenobia found it impossible to collect another army.
As far as the frontier of Egypt, the nations subject to her
empire had joined the standard of the conqueror, who detached
Probus, the bravest of his generals, to possess himself
of the Egyptian provinces. Palmyra was the last resource
of the widow of Odenathus. She retired within the walls of
283

her capital, made every preparation for a vigorous resistance,
and declared with the intrepidity of a heroine, that the last
moment of her reign and her life should be the same.

âIn his march over the sandy desert between Emessa and
Palmyra, the emperor Aurelian was perpetually harassed
by the Arabs; nor could he always defend his army, and
especially his baggage, from those flying troops of active and
daring robbers, who watched the moment of surprise, and
eluded the slow pursuit of the legions. The siege of Palmyra
was an object far more difficult and important, and the
emperor, who with incessant vigour pressed the attacks in
person, was himself wounded with a dart. âThe Roman
people,â says Aurelian, in an original letter, speak âwith
contempt of the war which I am waging against a woman.
They are ignorant both of the character and the power of
Zenobia. It is impossible to enumerate her warlike preparations,
of stones, of arrows, and of every species of missile
weapons. Every part of the walls is provided with two or
three balistÃ¦, and artificial fires are thrown from her military
engines. The fear of punishment has armed her with a
desperate courage. Yet still I trust in the protecting deities
of Rome, who have hitherto been favourable to all my undertakings.â
Doubtful, however, of the protection of the gods
and of the events of the siege, Aurelian judged it more
prudent to offer terms of an advantageous capitulation; to
the queen, a splendid retreat; to the citizens, their ancient
privileges. His proposals were obstinately rejected, and the
refusal was accompanied with insult.

âThe firmness of Zenobia was supported by the hope that
famine would soon compel the emperor to repass the desert;
and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the
East, and particularly the Persian monarch, would arm in
defence of their most natural ally. But fortune, and the
perseverance of Aurelian, overcame every obstacle. The
death of Sapor, which happened about this time, distracted
the councils of Persia, and the inconsiderable succours that
attempted to relieve Palmyra, were easily intercepted, either
by the arms or the liberality of the emperor. From every
part of Syria, a succession of convoys safely arrived in the
camp, which was increased by the return of Probus, with his
victorious troops, from the conquest of Egypt. It was then
284

that Zenobia resolved to fly. She mounted the fleetest of
her dromedaries, and had already reached the banks of the
Euphrates, about sixty miles from Palmyra, when she was
overtaken by the pursuit of Aurelianâs light horse, seized,
and brought back a captive to the feet of the emperor.
Her capital soon after surrendered, and was treated with
unexpected lenity. The arms, horses, and camels, with an
immense treasure of gold, silver, silk, and precious stones,
were all delivered to the conqueror, who, leaving only a garrison
of six hundred archers, returned to Emessa, and employed
some time in the distribution of rewards and punishments
at the end of so memorable a war, which restored to
the obedience of Rome those provinces that had renounced
their allegiance since the captivity of Valerian.

âWhen the Syrian queen was brought into the presence
of Aurelian, he sternly asked her how she had presumed to
rise in arms against the emperors of Rome? The answer of
Zenobia was a prudent mixture of respect and firmness.
âBecause I disdained to consider as Roman emperors an
Aureolus or a Gallienus. You alone I acknowledge as my
conqueror and my sovereign.â But as female fortitude is
commonly artificial, so it is seldom steady or consistent.
The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of trial;
she trembled at the angry clamours of the soldiers, who
called aloud for her immediate execution; she forgot the
generous despair of Cleopatra, which she had proposed as
her model; and ignominiously purchased life by the sacrifice
of her fame and her friends. It was to their counsels, which
governed the weakness of her sex, that she imputed the guilt
of her obstinate resistance; it was on their heads she
directed the vengeance of the cruel Aurelian. The fame of
Longinus, who was included amongst the perhaps innocent
victims of her fear, will survive that of the queen who betrayed,
or the tyrant who condemned him. Genius and
learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered soldier,
but they had served to elevate and harmonize the
soul of Longinus. Without uttering a complaint, he calmly
followed the executioner, pitying his unhappy mistress and
bestowing comfort on his afflicted friends.

âReturning from the conquest of the East, Aurelian had
already crossed the straits which divide Europe from Asia,
285

when he was provoked by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians
had massacred the governor and garrison which he
had left among them, and again erected the standard of
revolt. Without a momentâs deliberation, he once more
turned his face towards Syria. Antioch was alarmed by his
rapid approach, and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the
irresistible weight of his resentment. We have a letter of
Aurelian himself, in which he acknowledges that old men,
women, children, and peasants had been involved in that
dreadful execution, which should have been confined to
armed rebellion; and although his principal concern seems
directed to the re-establishment of a temple of the Sun, he
discovers some pity for the Palmyrenians, to whom he grants
the permission of rebuilding and inhabiting their city. But
it is easier to destroy than to restore. The seat of commerce,
of arts, and of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an
obscure town, a trifling fortress, and at length a miserable
village. The present citizens of Palmyra, consisting of thirty
or forty families, have erected their mud cottages within the
spacious court of a magnificent temple.

âSince the foundation of Rome, no general had more nobly
deserved a triumph than Aurelian, nor was a triumph ever
celebrated with superior pride and magnificence. The pomp
was opened by twenty elephants, four royal tigers, and above
two hundred of the most curious animals from every climate
of the North, the East, and the South. They were followed
by sixteen hundred gladiators, devoted to the cruel amusements
of the amphitheatre. The wealth of Asia, the arms
and ensigns of so many conquered nations, and the magnificent
plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were exposed
in exact symmetry or artful disorder. The ambassadors of
the most remote parts of the earth,âof Ethiopia, Arabia,
Persia, Bactriana, India, and China, all remarkable by their
rich or singular dresses, displayed the fame and power of the
Roman emperor, who exposed likewise to the public view
the presents that he had received, and particularly a great
number of crowns of gold, the offerings of grateful cities.
The victories of Aurelian were attested by the long train of
captives who reluctantly attended his triumph,âGoths,
Vandals, Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and
Egyptians. Each people was distinguished by its peculiar
286

inscription, and the title of Amazons was bestowed on ten
martial heroines of the Gothic nation who had been taken
in arms. But every eye, disregarding the crowds of captives,
was fixed upon the Queen of the East and the emperor
Tetricus. The latter, as well as his son, whom he had created
Augustus, was dressed in Gallic trousers, a saffron tunic,
and a robe of purple. The beauteous figure of Zenobia was
confined by fetters of gold; a slave supported the gold
chain which encircled her neck, and she almost fainted
under the intolerable weight of jewels. She preceded, on
foot, the magnificent chariot in which she once hoped to
enter the gates of Rome. It was followed by two other
chariots, still more sumptuous, of Odenathus and of the
Persian monarch. The triumphal car of Aurelian (it had
formerly been used by a Gothic king) was drawn on this
memorable occasion either by four stags or by four elephants.
The most illustrious of the senate, the people, and the army
closed the solemn procession. Unfeigned joy, wonder, and
gratitude swelled the acclamations of the multitude; but
the satisfaction of the senate was clouded by the appearance
of Tetricus; nor could they suppress a rising murmur that
the haughty emperor should thus expose to public ignominy
the person of a Roman and a magistrate.

âThe triumph over, Aurelian behaved generously to his
beautiful and royal captive. He presented Zenobia with an
elegant villa at Tibur or Tivoli, above twenty miles from the
capital; the Syrian queen insensibly sunk into a Roman
matron, her daughters married into noble families, and her
race was not extinct in the fifth century.â

287

MILAN.

A.D. 338.

UraÃ¯as
, nephew of Vitiges, besieged Milan in 338. That
city, then a magnificent one, was esteemed the second of the
West. With the assistance of ten thousand Franks, furnished
by Theodebert, king of Austrasia, UraÃ¯as pressed the
siege warmly during six months. The Goths, masters of
the city, delivered it up to pillage, made the garrison prisoners,
put the inhabitants to the sword, and carried off the
women into captivity.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1139.

In this year the inhabitants of Milan revolted against
Frederick Barbarossa. The angry emperor immediately
laid siege to that city. The cruel conqueror drove out all
the inhabitants, razed the most beautiful of the edifices with
the ground, demolished the gates, its triumphal arches, its
baths, its most magnificent houses, and sowed salt upon its
ruins, to denote that it should never be rebuilt. His cruel
design was disappointed; Milan soon arose again from her
ashes.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1499.

During the wars of the French in the Milanese, in the
reign of Louis XII., the Chevalier Bayard fell in with an
Italian party in the neighbourhood of Milan, and attacked
it warmly. On his arriving at the gates of Milan, a French
gendarme cried out to him with a loud voice, âTurn, man-at-arms,
turn!â Bayard, transported by the desire of
conquering, was deaf to these repeated cries, and entered
the city at full gallop, as if, says an historian, he meant to
take that capital alone. Soldiers, people, even women, fell
upon him. Cajazzo, whom his valour astonished, ordered
288

his men-at-arms to cover him from these assaults, and made
him his prisoner. He took him to his own house, and afterwards
to sup with the duke of Milan. Ludovic, who had
witnessed the extraordinary feats of the Chevalier from his
palace windows, spoke of the brave Frenchman with great
admiration, and with a view of ascertaining his character,
conversed freely with him. âMy brave gentleman,â said
the duke, âwhat brought you hither?â âThe desire of
conquering, my lord,â replied Bayard. âAnd pray did you
think of taking Milan alone?â âNo,â rejoined the knight,
âbut I reckoned upon being followed by my companions.â
âThey and you together,â said Ludovic, âcould not do it.â
âWell,â said Bayard, with his characteristic frankness, âI
must admit they are wiser than I have been; they are free,
and I am a prisoner, although to one of the bravest and
most generous of men.â The prince then asked him, with
an air of disdain, âWhat is the strength of the French
army?â âFor our parts,â replied Bayard, âwe never
think of counting our enemies; but what I can assure you
is, that my masterâs soldiers are all picked men, before whom
yours will have no chance.â Ludovic, very much piqued,
replied that effects gave a very different idea of his troops,
and that a battle would soon proclaim both his right and
their courage. âWould to God,â cried Bayard, âthat it
were to-morrow, and I were free!â âYou are free,â
replied the prince; âI like your frankness and your courage,
and, to the first benefit, I beg to add whatever you desire.â
Bayard, penetrated with so much kindness, threw himself
on his knees before the duke, and begged him to pardon, in
favour of his duty, all that might have appeared too bold in
his speech. He then requested to have his horse and his
arms, and returned to the French camp, to give a highly
favourable account of the generosity of Ludovic.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1706.

Prince Eugene had made himself master of Milan, but he
could not be sure of keeping it without occupying the
citadel. The marquis de la Florida was the governor of it.
Prince Eugene summoned him to surrender, at the same
time threatening to grant no quarter if he did not capitulate
289

within four-and-twenty hours. âI have defended twenty-four
places for my masters, the kings of Spain,â replied the
governor, âand I have made up my mind to be killed on the
breach of the twenty-fifth.â This bold reply, which was
known to be the expression of a strong mind, caused the
prince to renounce the project of attacking the castle by
force, and he was satisfied with blockading it.

Milan was besieged by the king of Sardinia in 1733, by
Don Philip of Spain in 1745, by Buonaparte in 1796, by
Suwarrow in 1799, and by Buonaparte in 1800; but there is
nothing interesting in the details of any of these sieges.

TOURNAI.

A.D. 438.

Towards
the middle of the fifth century, Clodio, first of
the race of Merovingian kings of the Franks in Gaul, entered
Belgium, surprised the Roman troops, defeated them, and
laid siege to Tournai, even then a powerful city. But it
could not withstand the conqueror long; he took it, and
gave it up to pillage.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1340.

After the naval victory gained by Edward III. of England,
near Ecluse, that prince presented himself before Tournai.
French authors say his army amounted to a hundred and
twenty thousand men, which appears an immense number
for that period; but Edward was assisted by so many
Belgians, and other nations at feud with France, that
his forces were great, though principally composed of
foreigners. Proud of his strength, he feared no obstacles.
But Godemar Dufay, the governor of the city, had prepared
for a long defence, and Edwardâs plans being known,
Dufay had a numerous and well-disciplined garrison. He
was likewise assured of the good-will of the inhabitants, and
290

was seconded by the
Ã©lite
of the chivalry of France.
Philip VI. soon came himself to animate his brave subjects,
and with several battalions, encamped between Lille and
Douay. As soon as he began operations, Edward became
aware of the rashness of his enterprise; and he sent a challenge
to the French king to fight him in single combat, a
hundred against a hundred, or in a general battle. This
letter was addressed to Philip de Valois, without any other
title. Philip replied, âA letter has been brought to our
camp, addressed to Philip de Valois, in which letter were
several requests which you make to the said Philip de
Valois. As it is not for us, we do not reply to it; but we
take advantage of the coming of your herald to remind you
that you are our liegeman; that by attacking us, and
raising the cities of Flanders against their count and
against us, their sovereign and yours, you commit an act of
rebellion, perjury, and felony, and for which, with the help
of God, we hope to subdue you and to punish you. Besides,
you propose a duel on very unequal terms; you offer to
hazard your own person only against both the kingdom of
France and the person of its king. If you will increase the
stake, and put also the kingdom of England on the issue of
that duel, we will, though the terms would be then
very unequal, willingly accept of the challenge.â All this
was intended, no doubt, to stimulate the troops on both
sides; we do not believe that either of these royal heroes
was in earnest. Both sides were tired of the contest, after
a siege of about twelve weeks. The inhabitants grew short
of provisions, and Edwardâs forces decreased daily by death
and desertion. In this situation, they listened to the friendly
intercession of Joan, countess dowager of Hainault; a truce
was concluded, and Tournai was saved.

Dazzled with the glories of Crecy and Poitiers, we English
are accustomed to be too proud of the reign of Edward III.,
that âmighty victor, mighty lord;â whereas few events in
our history produced more or longer-endured misery to two
great countries than Edwardâs unjust claim to the crown of
France: unjust, because it was in opposition to the laws of
that country, by which all such cases must be settled. This
calamitous war lasted a hundred years, and, we have no
doubt, by the enmity being thus carried down from father
291

to son, created that unnatural antipathy between two
neighbouring nations which is now so happily being
removed by their being united in a good and holy cause.
For our part, we never take up the thin strip of a sword,
which is all time has left of the weapon of this hero, without
reflecting on the evil he did and prepared, and turning,
with the poet, to his âfuneral couch, with not one to grace
his obsequies!â

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1513.

Henry VIII., king of England, in his famous expedition
into France, attacked Terouanne, a town situated on the
frontiers of Picardy. This siege is chiefly remarkable for
the manner in which Fontrailles, a French officer, contrived
to bring in a supply of provisions and ammunition. Henry
and his nobles, together with the emperor Maximilian, who
was with the English army, carried on the siege so languidly,
that the town was more in danger from famine than from its
foes. The above-named officer appeared at the head of eight
hundred horsemen, each of whom carried a sack of gunpowder
behind him and two quarters of bacon. With this
small force he made a sudden irruption into the English
camp, and advanced to the fosse of the town, where each
horseman threw down his burden. They immediately
returned at the gallop, and were so fortunate as again to
break through the English, and to suffer little or no loss.
But the English had soon their revenge. The famous
battle of Guinegate shortly followed, in which the French
made such good use of their spurs, and in which the pride of
their chivalry, Bayard, Bussy dâAmboise, Clermont, Imbrecourt,
and others were taken prisoners. After this defeat,
Henry made the mistake of returning to the siege of so
inconsiderable a town as Terouanne. The place capitulated,
and he demolished the fortifications. The army then
advanced against Tournai.

This city, by its ancient charters, was exempt from the
burden of a garrison, and when Louis XII. sent to ask
them if they needed troops to defend their city, they made
this boastful and silly reply: âTournai est tournÃ©, et jamais
nâa tournÃ©, et encore ne tournera. Si les Anglais viennent,
ils trouveront Ã  qui parlerââ(Tournay is turned, and never
292

has turned, and, still further, never will turn. If the
English come, they will find somebody to speak to). And
so the burgesses undertook the defence themselves. But
the fate of Terouanne alarmed them, and in a very short
time the place was surrendered. Over its gates was
engraved this proud motto: âTu nâas jamais perdu ta
virginitÃ©.â Never having been taken, it was what is called
a maiden city; which honour it now lost. One of our
countrymen, who was always anxiously looking out for personal
advantages, derived benefit from this capture. The
bishop of Tournai was lately dead; and although a new
bishop was elected, he was not installed; so the king
bestowed the administration of the see upon his favourite,
Wolsey, and put him in immediate possession of the
revenues.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1581.

At this date Tournai was besieged by Spanish forces
under the command of the prince of Parma. The Seigneur
dâEtrÃ©el commanded in the city, but his garrison was weak.
The citizens, for the most part Protestants, were obliged to
perform the duties of soldiers. The Spanish general invested
the place, and formed the attack on the side where the
ditch is dry, opposite the longest of the curtains, between
the gates of St. Martin and of Valenciennes, which was
defended by a salient ravelin and a large platform. As soon
as the trenches were opened, three batteries were established
against these three works. The besieged kept up a warm
fire from the tops of the bulwarks, and signalized themselves
by some vigorous sorties. The Princess dâEpinoi,
the wife of the governor, who filled with distinction the
place of her husband, inflamed their ardour, and acquitted
herself with incredible energy of all the functions of a most
vigilant commander. The prince of Parma made all haste to
terminate the approaches, in order to get at the body of the
place. It required but few days to carry the trenches to a
great length. His batteries played furiously. He debouched
in the fosse; it being dry, he carried, without
trouble, the mine up to the wall, which, by both sapping
and mining was speedily brought down. The defenders of
Tournai, redoubling their ardour, opposed fresh barriers to
293

the Spanish impetuosity, and presented themselves wherever
the danger was most imminent. At the end of a few
days, the breach was found large enough to give an assault.
It was given. The resistance and the attack were equally
murderous. In the midst of the combatants the Princess
dâEpinoi was particularly conspicuous. Nothing could
resist the power of her arm. Flying in the face of peril
and death, she continued to cry to the soldiers: âIt is I;
it is the wife of your governor who marches at your head,
and braves death for the service of her country. Follow
my example. I would rather quit life than the breach!â
She spoke, and rushed amidst the carnage. She was
wounded in the arm. The sight of her blood only animates
her: she redoubles her efforts; all fly, all disperse before
her. The besieged, zealous to imitate her, eagerly follow
her, and fight with such ardour, that the Spaniards are
repulsed and retreat, after having lost a vast number of
men. The hopes of prompt succour alone supported the
citizens of Tournai; but as soon as they found their expectations
frustrated, they perceived it was impossible to defend
themselves longer, and resolved to surrender. On the
29th of November, the garrison was permitted to march
out, with its arms and its baggage. The city redeemed
itself from pillage; and the intrepid Amazon who had so
bravely defended it, left Tournai, with her arm still in a
scarf, amidst the enthusiastic acclamations of the royal
army, and, in some sort, with all the appearance of a
glorious triumph.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1667.

No monarch ever went to war more wantonly and unnecessarily
than Louis XIV. Inflated with vanity and self-love,
intoxicated with flattery, he seemed to look upon
military glory as the only thing wanting to his fame and his
happiness. But never did monarch receive a much stronger
rebuke from an overruling Providence! He was taught
that the prosperity of nations is not to be trifled with for
the gratification of one manâs pride; and the wars he undertook
so rashly and wickedly proved to be the sources of
misery to which his arrogant self-sufficiency would have led
him to believe he could not be subjected.

294

In 1666, Louis XIV. lost his mother, Anne of Austria;
Philip IV., her father, had died the preceding year. When
Louis married Maria Theresa, that princess had formally
renounced all right of succession to Spain or the Austrian
dominions; but Louis, now heedless of this renunciation,
immediately laid claim to Flanders, to the exclusion of
Charles II., the minor son of Philip IV. The pretence he
assigned was, that the queenâs dowry not having been paid,
her renunciation was null and void, and he invoked a custom
of Brabant, by which eldest daughters inherited in preference
to younger sons. He supported these claims by a numerous
army; won over the emperor Leopold, by giving him hopes
he might share the spoils of Charles II., and took the field
at the head of his household. Turenne commanded under
him; Vauban, and his minister Louvois, accompanied him.
We have often, when contemplating this siege of Tournai,
wondered what Louis could really think of himselfâwhat
he imagined his position actually was in the scale of humanity.
He proceeded to the infliction of war upon an
unoffending peopleâof war, the direst evil we know or can
fancy,âwith all the âpride, pomp, and circumstanceâ of a
barbarous Eastern despot. Darius, when he met Alexander,
was scarcely surrounded with so much splendour, and perhaps
not so many indulgent comforts, and, what is still
more striking, did not in the eyes of his people so completely
violate all that the civilized world deems moral or worthy of
being an example. He was accompanied by his queen and
his then adored mistress, the fascinating Montespan, with
whom he lived in a state of double adultery. His court was
with him in all its splendour; he had his historian to record
the exploits of his generals and his armies, and his poets to
sing his praises and attribute every success to his divine
presence. Here was a beleaguered town, suffering all the
horrors of a siege, with almost the certainty of being taken;
there was an army appearing to invade the rights of another
nation in mere wantonness, indulging in voluptuous vice,
and, in contrast with the town, passing its nights in festivity,
song, music, and dancing; vice and cruelty, pleasure and
suffering, throwing each other into the strongest relief.

Louisâ army consisted of thirty-five thousand men. It
was on this occasion that the minister Louvois introduced
295

the improvement of supporting armies by magazines. Whatever
siege the king undertook, to whichever side he directed
his arms, supplies of all kinds were ready, the lodgings of
the troops were provided, and the marches regulated. The
king had only to present himself before the cities of Flanders
to subdue them: he entered Charleroi as he would have
entered Paris; Bergues-Saint-Veux, Ath, Furnes, ArmentiÃ¨re,
and Coutrai, opened their gates at the approach of
the French battalions. Tournai showed signs of resistance.
It was besieged in form, the artillery brought to bear upon
it, and two days after the trenches had been opened it capitulated.
The citadel was then closely pressed, and that
likewise surrendered on the morrow. The conqueror had
both city and citadel fortified; and MÃ©grigni made the
latter, of which he was governor, one of the best places in
Europe.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.D. 1745.

Louis XV. opened the campaign against the Allies with
great spirit. Marshal Saxe laid siege to Tournai, which
was defended by a Dutch garrison, and supported by an
English army under the duke of Cumberland. De Saxe
was so ill as to be obliged to go through his duties in a
litter; but he had posted his army admirably. On the
11th of May the Allies commenced the attack, and De Saxe
prepared to meet them. The English, Austrians, and Dutch
amounted to a number very nearly equal to the French.
After a long resultless cannonade, the English advanced to
endeavour to carry the village of Fontenoi, in front of De
Saxeâs centre, and succeeded so well, that the battle was
supposed to be lost, and the king was advised to retreat;
but he refused, and the Marshal guaranteed the victory.
De Saxe saw the English were ill supported by their allies.
After a terrible slaughter by his judiciously-placed artillery,
the French cavalry came up, and determined the fate of
day. The English left nine thousand men on the field, and
Tournai was taken.

SEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1794.

At the commencement of the campaign of 1794, General
Pichegru made every possible effort to approach Tournai
296

and besiege it in regular form, but all in vain; he, on every
occasion, had to contend with troops superior to his own,
beneath its walls. When, however, he had gained several
victories, and the Imperialists had been conquered at
Fleurus, the allies withdrew from Tournai, which fell into
the hands of the French. It was not by causing men to be
massacred before places that the French made their conquests,
but by beating the enemy in the open field. This
campaign suffices to convince military men of the vices of
the ancient tactics, which began by laying sieges and sacrificed
so many men in the trenches. A well-fortified place is
impregnable whilst defended by a good army; but there is
no fortress that can hold out, when the troops which ought
to defend it are beaten. In the revolutionary wars, the
French only besieged the cities that were absolutely necessary
to assure the position of their armies. The king of
Prussia alone formed a just idea of this new manner of
making war. In 1794, he wrote to the emperor of Austria:
âIt is impossible to save your territories from invasion; the
French have fresh armies continually springing up; and, do
not deceive yourself, their generals have a good kind of
tactics, which disconcerts ours and always puts it at fault.â
The above passage is certainly from a French author, but it
contains much truth.

297

ORLEANS.

A.D. 451.

Attila
, king of the Huns, entered Gaul in 451, with fire
and sword, followed by a countless host of barbarians. After
spreading everywhere terror, death, and carnage, he appeared
before Orleans. The only defence of this city
consisted in the valour of its people and the active zeal of
Saint-Agnan, its bishop. Before the Huns had crossed the
Seine, he hastened to raise the walls on that side, he collected
as much provision as possible, flew to Arles to press
the Roman general Ãtius to succour Orleans, and then shut
himself up within its walls, determined to perish with his
flock if the Romans did not second their courage. The Huns
arrived and attacked the part of the city situated on the
right bank of the Loire, with fury. They reiterated their
assaults, they multiplied their efforts, whilst Agnan, having
employed all human means, was prostrate at the foot of the
altar, imploring the All-Powerful. Heaven appeared to
listen to his prayers; a tempestuous rain, which lasted three
days, interrupted the attacks. When it had ceased, the
barbarians recommenced their assaults, broke down the
gates, and were already rushing into the city, when the
Roman trumpets were heard. Ãtius and Theodoric entered
Orleans from the other side of the Loire at the same instant
that Attila entered by the opposite gate. The Huns, imagining
they were conquerors, dispersed themselves in the
wild disorder of pillage, through the streets and houses.
The barbarians were stopped, surrounded, pursued, and
massacred in all directions. In vain Agnan endeavoured to
excite pity for these ferocious men; their character was too
well known: they gave none; they met with none. Attila,
conquered at the moment he thought himself victorious,
retired, darting upon the prey which had escaped him,
furious but powerless glances of disappointment and rage.

298

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1429.

We come now to an interesting siege, one connected with
many stirring associations for both French and English
readers. The miserable condition into which France had
fallen at the period of the unjust invasion of our Henry V.,
can scarcely be conceived. An insane king, ambitious grasping
princes, bold, poor, and selfish nobles, all conspired to
oppress a sunken and degraded people. With us, Henry V.
has a false amiability thrown round his character; except in
his bravery and shrewd sense, the historical Henry V. has
not much resemblance to the heroic, gay, dissipated but
good-natured, Hal of Shakespeare. He and his English
rendered themselves hateful to the French, whom they
treated as a conquered nation. The early death of Henry
made matters still worse. His brother Bedford, with Talbot,
Salisbury, and other eminent leaders, upheld the English
cause in France for many years, and with occasional success;
but the one great directing will and power was gone; where
there are many, however able they may be, disunions will
take place, and even a good cause will fail. For Englishmen
who are proud of the valour and ability of their heroes of all
ages, the page now before us is a melancholy one to turn
over. Better knights never laid lance in rest; wiser and
more prudent men never met in council, than some of the
leaders in these ill-starred wars; and yet all seem to be
striving against fate, and that fate was that their cause was
unjust.

At the period of this siege, the two great actors in the
late events, Henry V. of England and Charles VI. of France,
were dead. Henryâs son was an infant; Charlesâs was still
worse: the infant was under the good tutelage of his brave
and good uncles, whilst Charlesâs son, for a long time called
only the dauphin, was a weak, dissipated, indolent youth, a
willing prey to mistresses and favourites. By the treaty of
Troyes, signed by Henry V. and Charles VI., the crown
belonged to Henry VI.; but the bulk of the French nation
deemed such a compulsory engagement binding upon no
one, and all eagerly waited the opportunity for throwing off
the odious foreign yoke.

For a long time the council of the king of England, to
299

assist in ruining the party of Charles VII., disinherited, as
they said, by the treaty of Troyes, had fixed their eyes upon
Orleans; but numberless considerations had retarded the
siege of that city. At length, on the 8th of October, 1428,
ten thousand English approached to reconnoitre the environs
of the place, after having rapidly conquered ChÃ¢teau-Neuf,
Rambouillet, BÃ©tancourt, Rochefort, and all the neighbouring
places. Gaucourt, the governor of the city, made a
vigorous sortie, and repulsed the enemy. They went and
sacked some more places, and on the 12th of the same
month reappeared before Orleans, on the side of the Sologne.
The garrison was weak, but it had as leaders intrepid warriors,
the Gaucourts, the Dunois, the Lahires, the Xaintrailles,
a crowd of noblesse of that name and that merit, who
all inspired the lowest soldiers with the heroic valour which
animated them. The inhabitants even, resolved to bury
themselves under the ruins of their city rather than submit
to a foreign yoke, had become so many heroes. The women
partook of this martial ardour, and devoted themselves enthusiastically
to the service of their country.

The
tÃªte du pont
, on the side of the Sologne, was defended
by a fortress called
Les Tourelles
, in front of which a bulwark
had been commenced. It was by this intrenchment the
earl of Salisbury, the general of the English army, made his
first attacks. The faubourgs, set fire to on the approach of
the enemy, were not yet entirely consumed. This barrier
stopped them at first, but they soon elevated a bastille upon
the ruins of the convent of the Augustines, and erected
batteries, which kept up a constant discharge against the
walls of the city, the Tourelles, and the boulevard, of which
they wished to make themselves masters. The cannon made
a large breach, and it was resolved to mount it sword in
hand. On the 21st of October, the trumpets sounded the
signal, and, as if by one motion, the warriors planted their
ladders at the foot of the ramparts. They sprang up with
incredible intrepidity; but they were received with a firmness
equal to it, and both sides fought with the same fury.
National hatred and a desire for vengeance added to the
natural desire to conquer. Whilst the besieged hurled their
foes into the fosses, launched fire-pots, rolled stones of an
enormous size upon them, encircled them with rings of
300

red-hot iron, poured torrents of boiling oil, and burning
ashes, the women of the city, not less active, in the words of
a chronicler, âbrought them everything that could assist
in the defence; and to refresh their great labour, bread,
wine, meats, fruits, and vinegar, with white towels to wipe
them. Some were seen, during the assault, repulsing the
English with lance-thrusts from the entrance to the boulevard,
and beating them down into the fosses.â Such a
furious resistance disconcerted Salisbury; he sounded a
retreat, and ordered a mine to be instantly commenced. It
was soon finished, and they were preparing to spring it.
The besieged perceived it, and despairing of maintaining a
post threatened on all sides, they set fire to it, in the sight
of the English, and retired into the fortress of the Tourelles.
To defend this for a short time, they raised a new boulevard
on the bridge even, of which they destroyed two arches.
Notwithstanding all this, they could not long withstand the
multiplied efforts of the English. The fort of the Tourelles
was carried, and that advantageous post offered the besiegers
a commodious and redoubtable position. The OrlÃ©annais
then directed all their batteries against that part of their
city for which they had so boldly fought. The enemy, on
their side, neglected no means to maintain it, and both
exhausted, in attack or defence, all the resources the most
heroic valour could furnish.

It was then the middle of autumn. Salisbury foreseeing
that the siege would be long, resolved to encircle the place
with a belt of many forts, which, placed at regular distances,
would render the entrance of succours or convoys next to
impossible. To draw up his plan according to the situation
of the city, he repaired to the Tourelles, from whence a view
could be obtained of the whole environs of Orleans. He
was earnestly employed on this examination, when a cannon-ball
carried away one of his eyes and half of his face. After
having exhorted the principal officers to continue the siege
according to the plan he had traced for them, he was transported
to Meun, where he soon after died. The earl of
Suffolk, the lord Pole his brother, Talbot, Glansdale, and
other leaders, were clothed with his authority; and these
captains, full of respect for their general, continued their
operations according to the instructions he had given them.

301

Every day the besiegers and the besieged received reinforcements.
The garrison, which at first scarcely amounted
to twelve hundred men, was now composed of three thousand
combatants; and the English army, which at the commencement
only reckoned ten thousand warriors, was increased to
twenty-three thousand soldiers, who thought themselves invincible.
The city, which had been attacked on the side of
the Sologne alone, was now invested almost entirely on
that of the Beauce. Opposite to the principal avenues of
Orleans were erected six large bastilles, which communicated
with each other by sixty less considerable redoubts, constructed
in the intervals. It was impossible to enter the
place without passing under the artillery of the forts. More
than once the French leaders forced the quarters of the
enemyâs army to introduce convoys. The rigour of the
season did not at all interrupt the works. Only on Christmas-day
the English proposed a suspension of arms, and
begged the besieged to send them some musicians, to celebrate
that great festival with proper solemnity. The generals
made each other presents. The earl of Suffolk sent the
bastard of Orleans some refreshments in exchange for a
plush robe which he had given him. Up to the beginning
of Lent, nothing remarkable took place. Having desolated
the country round, the English began to be in want of provisions.
In the early part of February, the duke of Bedford
sent a convoy, escorted by two thousand five hundred
men, under the conduct of the brave Fastolfe. The count
de Clermont having collected nearly three thousand soldiers,
to whom he added a detachment of the garrison of Orleans,
resolved to carry off this convoy. He came up with the
English at Rouvray, a village of the Beauce. Fastolfe
9
halted,
made an intrenchment of the waggons which contained the
provisions, and only left two issues, at one of which he
placed his archers. The French army, more courageous
than prudent, wished that same night to force this intrenchment,
302

with an impetuosity that has often proved fatal to
their countrymen. The French insisted upon fighting on
horseback; the Scots would only fight on foot. This deficiency
of discipline produced the effect that might have been
expected. After an obstinate conflict, the English were
conquerors. A hundred and twenty nobles of high rank
were left dead upon the field; and the other leaders returned
to the city, quite crest-fallen, with scarcely five hundred followers.
This battle was called âLa journÃ©e des harengs,â
because the convoy conducted by Fastolfe consisted principally
of barrels filled with this fish, which, being broken by
the French artillery, their savoury contents were strewed
over the field of battle.

In proportion with the triumph of the English in this little
battle was the depression of the feeble and voluptuous Charles,
then lying encamped at Chinon. Despairing of his fortunes,
the timid monarch deliberated whether he had not better
seek refuge in Dauphiny. It was his own opinion, and his
servile counsellors concurred in it. He was already about
to carry this resolution into effect, when two heroines roused
the courage of the prince from its effeminate slumbers. The
queen, a princess above her sex and her rank, and the fair
Agnes
10
Sorel, employed the influence their charms had
over him to detain the king, who could but blush to think
he had less magnanimity than his wife or his mistress.

In the mean time Orleans seemed daily sinking into the
last extremity. The besieged could no longer look for relief
to a prince who was in no condition to assist them, and who,
indeed, scarcely preserved a shadow of royalty. There only
remained one chance of saving the city, and that was to
place it in sequestration in the hands of the duke of
Burgundy. The envoys, among whom was Xaintrailles, went
at once to the duke, who agreed to the proposal, and came
with them to Paris, with the design of persuading the duke
of Bedford to accept it. But the regent replied that he
303

would only treat with the city upon the condition of its
surrender to the English. This intelligence roused the
indignation and revived the courage of the OrlÃ©annais; they
resolved to defend themselves to the last breath.

Whilst terrified France looked for nothing but the blow
which was to consummate its ruin, that Invincible Power
which sometimes seems to attach the greatest events to the
most apparently weak causes, prepared her an avenger. A
girl, of about seventeen years of age, was strongly persuaded
that God destined her to be the preserver of her country.
Our readers will please to observe we speak of La Pucelle
according to the opinion entertained of her by the French
of her own day, because it was that opinion which produced
the revolution which astonishes us: if the majority of the
French nation had not had faith in the mission of Joan of
Arc, the miracle would not have been effected. Born near
the banks of the Meuse, at Dom-Remy, a village of Lorraine,
her poor but honest parents had given her an education
conformable to the simplicity of her situation. Jeanne
dâArc, or, as we call her, Joan of Arc, had from her childhood
been brought up with a horror for the English; she
constantly made it the subject of her prayers that the
monarchy should be delivered from the eternal enemies who
tyrannized over it. Her zeal becoming more ardent with
her years, at thirteen she had trances, in which she declared
she had conversed with St. Michael, St. Marguerite, and
St. Catherine, who told her that God had appointed her to
drive out the English and bring about the coronation of the
dauphin. With this enthusiasm she possessed all the virtues
of which a simple mind is susceptible: innocence, piety,
candour, generosity, and courage. Her rustic life had
strengthened her naturally robust frame; she had the
exterior, and even the natural graces of her sex, without experiencing
the infirmities which characterize the weakness of it.

After several years of revelations, Joan, urged more and
more by that inward voice which excited her to arm for her
country, formed the resolution of presenting herself to
Baudricourt, governor of Vaucouleurs, a small city of the
neighbourhood:ââMaster captain,â said she, âknow that
God has for some time past often given me to know, and
has commanded me to go to the
gentil dauphin
, who ought,
304

it is true, to be king of France, and that he should place
under me men-at-arms, and that I should raise the siege of
Orleans, and lead him to be crowned at Reims.â The
astonished Baudricourt supposed her to be mad, and wanted
to have her exorcised by the curÃ© of the place. Joan continued
to urge him for six months, and at length the governor,
subdued by her importunities, armed her at all points, gave
her in charge to two gentlemen with their servants, and
dismissed her, saying, âGo, come of it what may!â Towards
the end of February she arrived at Chinon, where the
dauphin then was. It was precisely the moment when the
vacillating Charles appeared to be sinking under the weight
of his ill fortune.
11
She announced herself at the court of
the monarch. During two days it was deliberated whether
she should be heard or not; but at length curiosity prevailed,
and she was admitted. The king, without any mark
of superior dignity, mingled with the crowd of courtiers, on
purpose to prove her. Joan distinguished him, pointed him
out, and in spite of the cries âYou are mistaken! you are
mistaken!â continued to exclaim, â
That is he! that is he!
â
They all admire her noble boldness; they surround her, and
gaze on her with astonished looks. Charles himself cannot
explain what passes in his heart at the aspect of this unknown
girl: âGentil dauphin,â said the heroine, without
being the least disconcerted, âmy name is
Jeanne la Pucelle
.
The King of Heaven has sent me to succour you; if you
will please to give me men of war, by divine grace and force
of arms I will raise the siege of Orleans, and will lead you
to Reims to be crowned, in spite of all your enemies. This
is what the King of Heaven has ordered me to tell you, and
it is His will that the English should return to their own
country, and leave you peaceful in yours, as being the only
true and legitimate heir of it; that if you make this offering
to God, He will make you much greater and more flourishing
than your predecessors have ever been; and He will take it
ill of the English if they do not retire.â

305

Thus spoke La Pucelle; the fire of her words, the
naÃ¯vetÃ©

of her manner, her simple but precise replies, everything
convinced. The king caused her to be examined by matrons,
by theologians, and by his parliament. Yoland of Arragon,
queen of Sicily, accompanied by the ladies De Gaucourt, De
TiÃ©nes, and several others of the first distinction, visited
Joan, and pronounced her to be as pure as she had described
herself. The theologians, after many interrogations, decided
that she was inspired. The parliament of Poitiers, after the
most scrupulous observations, required that she should
manifest the truth of her revelations by some prodigy. âI
did not come to Poitiers,â she haughtily replied, âto perform
miracles; but conduct me to Orleans, and I will give you
certain signs of my mission.â This firm reply so astonished
her judges, that all with one voice declared that this heavenly
instrument which the All-Powerful had sent to their country
ought to be instantly employed. Charles ordered a splendid
and complete suit of armour to be made for her, gave her a
standard, squires, pages, an intendant, a chaplain, and a train
becoming the state of a great warlike leader. The new
Amazon placed herself at the head of a considerable convoy
destined for Orleans; and her warriors soon felt themselves
inspired with her enthusiasm. She set out, followed by
Marshal De Boussac, Gilles de Rais, the admiral De Couland,
Ambroise de LotÃ©, and Lahire, and arrived on the 29th of
April within sight of the place. Dunois came to meet her;
he begged her to satisfy the desire the inhabitants had to
behold their liberator: she yielded to his entreaties, and she
entered the city as if in triumph. A thousand cries of joy
were heard; at that moment the OrlÃ©annais believed themselves
invincible, and in fact were so. Everything was
changed; the English, to that day conquerors, trembled at
the name of Joan of Arc; they as firmly believed her to be
a sorceress as the French believed her to be celestially
inspired. âEnglish,â wrote the heroine to them, âyou who
have no right to this kingdom of France, God commands
you by me, Jeanne la Pucelle, to abandon your forts and
to retire.â The couriers were arrested, and no reply was
made to this awful summons but insults. Joan, outraged
but dreaded, now prepared to prove her mission. On
Wednesday, the 4th of May, she selected a body of troops,
306

and, filled with an ardour more than human, she precipitated
herself upon the enemyâs forts, and carried them after
an assault of four hours. She then thought of gaining possession
of the boulevard and fort of the Tourelles, where the

Ã©lite
of the English were cantoned, under the orders of the
celebrated Glansdale. After having made her dispositions
during the night, she gave the signal as the first rays of day
appeared. The ready troops follow her, mount with her to
the breach, fight with ardour, press, pierce through, and
overthrow the English, who, nevertheless, defend themselves
with great courage. The French were on the point of carrying
all before them, when Joan, wounded in the neck, was
obliged to retire to put a dressing to her wound. Her
absence extinguished the courage of the assailants; the
soldiers missed the warlike illusion which rendered them
victorious. Each began to desire to place himself in safety:
even Dunois judged it most prudent to do so. All at once
La Pucelle reappears! She rushes to the foot of the fort,
and there plants her standard. Her intrepidity passes into
all hearts; the efforts of her followers are redoubled, their
fatigues and fears are forgotten, the English fly, the boulevard
is carried!

On the morrow the vanquished English draw up in order
of battle on the side of La Beauce; the French, still led on,
still animated by their heroine, present themselves in the
same order, resolved to fight, although inferior in numbers.
But their enemies, till that time so proud and so terrible,
did not dare to stand before them; they precipitately retreated,
leaving behind them their sick, their baggage, their
provisions, their artillery, and nearly five thousand dead.
Thus, contrary to all hopes and expectations, the city of
Orleans was relieved on the 8th of May, 1419. Public
gratitude exhausted itself, so to say, to prove to Joan of
Arc how deeply the greatness of her benefits was felt; the
king ennobled her, with her father, her three brothers, and
all her posterity. A statue was erected to her on the bridge
of the city she had saved, and, to eternize the memory of
this fortunate event, a festival was established, which is still
celebrated every year on the 8th of May. At this festival
an eulogy is pronounced on Joan of Arc, who, from the
period of the raising of the siege, has been styled the Maid
307

of Orleans. During the troubles of the Revolution, ignorant
and barbarous men overthrew, in Orleans, the statue of a
heroine who had preserved their city from the yoke of the
English, and roused the spirit in France which shortly
afterwards expelled the invaders from their soil; it was,
however, reinstated by Buonaparte, during his consulship,
on which occasion he did not forget to introduce a pungent
reflection upon his and Joanâs enemies, the English.

The momentary gratitude was such as we have above
described it; but what was the conduct of the king she had
saved, when she became a captive? After she had fulfilled
her mission, and effected the consecration of the king at
Reims, she wished to retire, âto be taken back,â as she
said, âto her father and mother, and keep their sheep and
tend to their cattle.â But Charlesâs captains had found the
value of the enthusiasm she created, and refused to let her
go. She, however, never was again as she had been; if she
had had any faith in the divinity of her mission, with its
completion it was gone. She was wounded at the siege of
Paris, and was afterwards taken prisoner. As no Englishman
can speak of her death without a blush, we will pass over
that in humbled silence; but what shall we say for her king,
who owed her so much, who heard of her imprisonment and
death with the utmost indifference, and did not make the
least effort to save her, or mitigate the horrors of her punishment?
It was twenty-five years before he bethought himself
of doing her memory justice: but Charles VII. was then
a very different man from what he had been when he was so
deeply indebted to Joan of Arc.

Joan of Arc is one of those remarkable characters who
have achieved miracles by working upon the current superstitions
of the times they lived in. To what a degree they
were superstitious, we may judge by the one instance of the
duchess of Gloucester, the wife of the kingâs uncle, being
tried and punished to the full extent the court durst venture,
for dabbling in witchcraft. Acknowledging the immense
benefit Joanâs efforts produced, and at the same time admitting
the spirit and intelligence with which she carried
out her plans, when we look at the pretence under which
she operated, we are made sceptical, as we are in all such
cases, of the first moving cause. In fact, we think it much
308

more probable that the keen-witted Dunois should have
trained a bold, shrewd girl to impose upon a weak young
king and a superstitious people, than for an instant to
imagine there was anything supernatural in her mission, or
even that she devised a scheme entirely herself. Shakespeare
generally follows the chronicles pretty faithfully; and the
manner in which Dunois introduces her to the notice of the
king is very suspicious. We do not take Shakespeareâs
view of her character, but we are quite as much at variance
with those poets who throw a veil of perfection and sickly
sentimentality over it. In our opinion, Joan is a person
who almost unwittingly effected wonders; neither she nor
Dunois contemplated the extent of the good she did for
France. Had she appeared under any banner but that of
superstition, we should not have said a word against the faith
that is placed in her; but no student of history should allow
that pretence to pass without the closest investigation. As
a high-spirited, intelligent, persevering, patriotic woman, she
has much of our admiration, but as the inspired Maid of
Orleans, she has none.

Her intervention was critically timed. The nobles were
beginning to be ashamed of allowing a foreign power to
dominate over the fair fields of France; the patience of the
people under an oppressive yoke was exhausted; the English
leaders, brave and wise as they were, were many and
divided, under a minor king of weak character even when a
man. In addition to these causes all beginning to operate
favourably for France, Charles VII. was becoming of an
age to perceive his legitimate course, and if he had not
shaken off the trammels of sloth and pleasure, occasionally
showed some little scintillations of what he afterwards
became. When paying tribute to the memory of Joan of
Arc as the regenerator of France, the French should not
forget another remarkable woman to whom they are indebted:
Agnes Sorel employed no magic but beauty and
good sense, and yet the rousing of the king to a sense of
his duty was as much due to her as the rousing of the people
was due to Joan.

PAVIA.

A.D. 476.

Orestes
having undertaken to dethrone Nepos, the
emperor of the West, raised an army, merely showed himself,
and the weak monarch abandoned the diadem. The
fortunate rebel encircled the head of his son Romulus
Augustulus with it. The Roman empire of the West was
in its last period of decay. Odoacer, at the head of an
army of Goths, Heruli, Scyrri, and Thuringians, came to
give it the last blow, and to reign over its vast wreck.
Terror and confusion preceded him. All fled, all dispersed
at his approach. The plains were deserted, the cities opened
their gates to him. Orestes, too weak to withstand him,
shut himself up in Pavia. Odoacer pursued him thither,
carried the city by storm, made a frightful carnage, and set
fire to the churches and houses. Orestes was taken and
decapitated on the 28th of August, 476, the very day on
which, one year before, he had dragged Nepos from his
throne. Augustulus, abandoned by everybody, stripped
himself of his dangerous dignity, and delivered up the
purple to his conqueror, who, out of compassion for his age,
left him his life, with a pension of six thousand golden
pence, that is, about three thousand three hundred pounds
sterling. Thus disappeared the empire of the West, after
having subsisted five hundred and six years from the battle
of Actium, and twelve hundred and twenty-nine from the
foundation of Rome. Scarcely was its fall perceived, scarcely
a look was fixed upon its last moments; it might be compared
to an old man who dies of caducity.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 572.

Alboin, king of the Lombards, entered Italy for the purpose
of founding a state. Pavia alone ventured to oppose
310

him. The new conqueror laid siege to it; and that city,
after a vigorous resistance of three years, reduced to the
last extremity, was forced to surrender at discretion. The
conqueror, exasperated by the obstinacy of the defence, had
resolved to put all the inhabitants to the sword, but their
submission disarmed his vengeance. He entered Pavia, not
as a conqueror, but as a pacific king; forbade murder, violation,
or pillage, and made that important place the capital
of his new empire.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 774.

Two centuries of profound peace had rendered Pavia one
of the most flourishing cities of the universe, when it beheld
the standards of Didier, king of the Lombards, floating at
its gates. This grasping prince, jealous of the power of
Pope Adrian, sacked every place belonging to the Pontiff.
The holy father fulminated horrible excommunications; but
these arms were too weak to stop the usurper, and the Pope
had recourse to Charlemagne. That monarch crossed the Alps,
combated the enemies of the court of Rome, and made such
a carnage of them, that the field of battle took the name of

the Plain of the Dead
. Didier sought refuge in Pavia. He
had provided that capital with everything necessary for a
long resistance. Charlemagne blockaded it, and left the
command of his troops to his uncle Bernard; he then took
the road to Rome, where he was received as the liberator of the
Holy See. After having made a sojourn there, he returned
to his army before Pavia, and pressed the siege so vigorously,
that it opened its gates after an heroic defence of six months.
Didier, his wife and children, were made prisoners and
banished to LiÃ©ge. Thus finished the kingdom of the Lombards,
which had subsisted two hundred and six years.
Charlemagne added to the titles of Emperor of the Franks
and Patrician of the Romans, that of King of the Lombards.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1524.

Francis I. of France, after a brilliant campaign, in which
he drove back the Imperialists from Provence to the
Milanese, very unwisely employed his army in sieges, instead
311

of pursuing his enemies with vigour to the other side of the
Carnic Alps. Accumulating errors, he weakened an army
of forty thousand men by dividing it; detaching from it a
body of ten thousand soldiers upon an expedition into the
kingdom of Naples. He thus left his enemy time to recover,
and to remain master, by means of the armies he was able to
raise in Germany and Naples. After having taken Milan,
he commenced the siege of Pavia. That city, well fortified,
had for governor Antonio de Leva, a great captain, commanding
a numerous and warlike garrison. The French
monarch attacked the place with vigour, but he evinced indecision
in his points of attack. The siege was protracted;
Pavia was reduced to extremity; the garrison mutinied more
than once for want of pay; the governor was even in dread
of seeing the city delivered up to the French by his unruly
troops; but his genius, equally firm and fertile in resources,
contrived to keep them to their duty. Lannoi, viceroy of
Naples for Charles V., was informed of the distress of Pavia.
The taking of that place might complete the disbanding of
the Imperial troops for want of money and subsistence; he
felt that this was the moment to venture to attack his enemy,
and to attempt an action, hazardous without doubt, but
which might re-establish the affairs of Charles V. in Italy.
He set out then, accompanied by the marquis de Pescara
and the constable De Bourbon. At his approach, the French
monarch called a council; prudence would have commanded
him to avoid an engagement, to raise the siege, and to refresh
and enlarge his army: âSire,â said La TrÃ©mouille to him,
âthe true honour in war is to succeed. A defeat can never
be justified by a battle; you risk your army, your person,
and your kingdom, and you risk nothing by raising the siege.â
The monarch was deaf to the counsels of wisdom; his
romantic spirit fancied that his honour would be compromised.
The admiral Bonnevet promised so to dispose his
troops that he should conquer his enemies, that the Imperialists
should not dare to attack him, and that Pavia should
fall into his hands. The king followed this fatal and pernicious
advice. The troops were nearly equal in numbers on
both sides, each reckoning about thirty thousand men. The
Imperialists first fell upon the rear-guard of the French,
placed at the castle and in the park of Mirabel. They
312

expected to carry it if the king did not come to its assistance;
and, if he did come, they should make him lose the
advantage of the position in which he was fortified. What
Lannoi anticipated, happened. Scarcely did the French
monarch perceive the danger of his brother-in-law the duke
of AlenÃ§on, who commanded the rear-guard, than, impatient
to signalize himself, he rushed forward at the head of his
cavalry, and fell upon the Imperialists. His artillery, placed
with much skill by Gaillon de Genouillac, and served with
great spirit, fired at first with such success, that every volley
carried away a file. The Spanish infantry, being unable to
resist this terrible fire, precipitately broke their ranks, to
seek shelter, in great disorder, in a hollow way. Such a
brilliant commencement dazzled Francis; he forgot that he
owed all his success to his artillery, believed himself already
the conqueror, and came out from his lines. This inconsiderate
movement placed the prince between his own artillery
and the fugitives, and rendered his cannon useless.
The face of the battle was changed in a moment; the viceroy
advanced with the gendarmerie and a body of arquebusiers;
the king was pressed on all sides. The French
gendarmerie did not, in this battle, sustain its ancient reputation;
it was beaten and almost destroyed by two thousand
Biscayans, of astonishing agility, who, separating by platoons
of ten, twenty, or thirty men, attacked it with inconceivable
celerity and address. They were seen, all at once, making
a discharge, disappearing at the moment they should be in
turn attacked, and re-appearing unexpectedly, again to disappear.
It is said that Antonio de Leva had, for some time,
trained these arquebusiers to fight thus in platoons, between
the squadrons of the Spanish cavalry, and that he had borrowed
the manÅuvre from the Greeks. A stratagem of
Pescaraâs contributed still further to the success of the day.
This general having approached the enemyâs camp a little
before the commencement of the battle, returned to his own
to announce that the king of France had just published in
his army a prohibition, under a capital punishment, to grant
quarter to any Spaniard. This information, although false,
produced so strong an impression upon his troops, that
almost all the Imperialists swore to spare the life of no
Frenchman, and to die sooner than surrender. This oath
313

rendered the Spaniard equally invincible in fight, and ferocious
after victory. The French monarch sustained the
powerful charges of the enemy like a hero. Francis of
Lorraine, and Richard De la Pole, the last heir of the house
of Suffolk, endeavoured, with some companies of lansquenets,
to disengage him; but they were killed, and the
soldiers instantly turned their backs. Bonnevet perished
fighting, and was regretted by nobody. Louis de la TrÃ©mouille
shared the same fate; nearly nine thousand warriors,
all gentlemen, were left lifeless on the field of battle. The

mÃªlÃ©e
was terrible around the king. Left almost alone in
the midst of a host of enemies, he inspired terror in all who
ventured to approach him. He had already immolated five
of his assailants, when his horse was killed, the monarch fell,
and a rush was made to seize him. Springing up, he recovered
himself, and killed two more Spaniards. At this
moment, Molac de Kercado, first gentleman of the chamber,
perceived the peril of his master, and dispersed or killed all
who stood in the way of his zeal. He placed himself before
his exhausted sovereign, protected him with his sword, and
checked the savage impetuosity of the Spanish soldiery; but
Kercado fell whilst defending the king, who refused to surrender
to anybody but the viceroy of Naples: âMonsieur
de Lannoi,â said he, âthere is the sword of a king who
deserves consideration, since, before parting with it, he has
employed it in shedding the blood of several of your people,
and who is not made prisoner by cowardice, but by a reverse
of fortune.â Lannoi fell on his knees, received the arms of
the king with respect, and kissed his hand, whilst presenting
him with another sword, saying, âI beg your majesty
to accept of mine, which has spared the blood of many of
your subjects. It is not becoming in an officer of the
emperor to behold a king disarmed, although a prisoner.â
Francis was conducted, after the action, across the field of
battle, to the place he was to be confined in. The Imperialists
made him observe that all his Swiss guards had fallen
in their ranks, and that they lay dead close to one another.
âIf all my troops had done their duty,â said he, much
affected by this spectacle, âas well as these brave fellows, I
should not be your prisoner, but you would be mine.â
Francis announced this defeat to his mother in the energetic
314

words: âMadame, all is lost but honour.â Whilst the
kingâs wounds were being dressed, a Spanish soldier,
approaching him respectfully, said: âKnowing we should
have a battle, Sire, I cast a golden bullet, which I destined
for your majesty, and six silver ones, for the principal officers
of your army. The six have been used, but yours is left,
because I could not find the opportunity I watched for. I
implore you, Sire, to accept of it, and to keep it to form part
of your ransom.â The king took it, thanked the Spaniard,
and praised his intelligence and generosity. The emperor
issued a decree, by which he forbade any rejoicings on account
of the victory; but this moderation was only apparent.
Francis was taken to Madrid. Charles assembled a council
to consider how the captive king ought to be treated. âAs
your brother and your friend,â replied the bishop of Osma;
âhe must be restored to liberty, without any other condition
than that of becoming your ally.â Charles did not follow
this wise counsel; he behaved towards the king like a
Corsair with a rich prisoner. Francis recovered his liberty
thirteen months after, by an onerous treaty, in which he
gave up his claims to the Milanese, Genoa, and Asti. He
was also to have ceded his rights to the duchy of Burgundy,
but when Lannoi came to demand that province in the name
of the emperor, Francis, as his only reply, required him to
be present at an audience of the deputies of Burgundy, who
told the king that he had not the power to dismember a
province of the French monarchy. Francis I. preserving a
continual desire to avenge himself for the disgrace before
Pavia, entered into all the leagues that were formed against
Charles V. The emperor derived but little advantage from
this event, the most decisive and glorious of his reign. A
modern writer has discovered the reason of this. Money
constitutes the sinews of war, and the emperor could not
pay his troops. He assembled the Cortes of Castille at
Madrid, and all orders refused him assistance: the clergy,
because they had no power to dispose of the goods consecrated
to religion; the nobility would have derogated from
their privilege, if they had paid a tribute; and the third
estate, because, not having yet had it in their power to pay
a gratuitous gift which had been demanded of them of four
hundred thousand ducats, it was impossible for them to
315

furnish fresh sums. The emperor, although very much dissatisfied,
pretended to find these reasons good, although they
defeated all his designs.âNapoleon, with that jealousy which
he always professed to have for the honour of France, when
master of Spain, caused the unfortunate king, his victim, to
restore the sword and armour of Francis I., which were preserved
at Madrid as a monument of this victory.

Pavia experienced something approaching to sieges in
1655, 1733, and 1745, but they furnish no details worth
relating. In 1796, likewise, it was captured, without any
trouble, by Buonaparte, who took the opportunity for uttering
one of his glorious fanfaronnades: âIf the blood of a
single Frenchman,â said he, âhad been shed, I would have
caused a column to be erected over the ruins of the city,
upon which should have been inscribedâ
Here stood the
City of Pavia
!â

RAVENNA.

A.D. 488.

Thedoric
besieged Odoacer in Ravenna, but, too weak
to carry the city by force, he resolved to reduce it by
famine. Ravenna, being well supplied with provisions, and
its port being accessible to light barks, the siege was protracted
to two years and a half. Odoacer made frequent
sorties by night, and never returned without having signalized
his courage. Theodoric, master of all the neighbouring
country, at length succeeded in closing the port.
Famine then began to be sensibly felt; a bushel of wheat
was worth six pieces of gold (more than three pounds sterling);
and the inhabitants were reduced to the extremity of
eating everything that could be converted into aliment.
Odoacer, obliged to treat with his rival, contented himself
with sharing with Theodoric the title of king. On the 5th
of March, 491, the king of the Goths entered Ravenna.
Such was, in Italy, the foundation of the kingdom of the
Ostrogoths, which only subsisted sixty years. Odoacer was
treated for some time with all the respect due to his dignity,
316

but that prince, worthy of a better fate, was massacred soon
after, with his son SilÅnes, by Theodoric himself, in the
midst of a banquet.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 540.

Belisarius, after having deprived Vitiges of the greater
part of the places which that prince possessed in Italy,
besieged him in Ravenna, which he soon reduced to a state
of famine. It was here Belisarius was so near losing his
life by an arrow, which was intercepted by a devoted follower,
who sacrificed himself to save his master. The city was on
the point of surrendering, when two senators arrived from
Constantinople, charged with a message from Justinian to
his victorious general, directing him to make peace with the
king of the Goths. Belisarius was indignant at being thus
deprived of the honour of conquering Italy. Under different
pretexts he amused the senators, and pressed the siege more
closely. Belisarius is one of the fine characters of history
upon whom the young imagination loves to dwell. He was
of the stamp of Plutarchâs heroes; he was brave, magnanimous,
good; and after being eminently successful, was as
eminently unfortunate, not from any falling off in himself,
but from his masterâs weakness and ingratitude. Such being
our feeling for Belisarius, we experience regret in being told
that, in his eagerness to take Ravenna, he condescended to
practices we think unworthy of such a man: he poisoned
the waters; circulated, by means of miscreants, reports in
Ravenna disadvantageous to Vitiges; and contrived to have
the city granaries set on fire by an incendiary. These may
come within the line of the proverb, âAll is fair in war;â
but there is nothing heroic in them; they would have become
Justinian better than his really great general. The Goths,
believing themselves betrayed by their prince, offered not
only to give up the city, but even proposed to Belisarius to
become their king. Although this extraordinary man might
have accepted the crown without dishonour, he only affected
to listen to it that he might the more speedily terminate the
war. Ambassadors came from Vitiges with offers of surrendering
on any terms he would please to impose. Belisarius
entered Ravenna, secured the person of Vitiges, and
sent him and his treasures to the emperor.

317

ANTIOCH.

Antioch
, now Anthakia, was a celebrated city, the capital
of Syria. It was seated on the river Orontes, now called
Assi, fifteen miles east of the Mediterranean, and forty miles
south-west of Aleppo. We have been thus particular,
because Antioch is not only a conspicuous city in the history
of the early Christian church, but because it has undergone
some of the most remarkable sieges to be found in this
volume.

FIRST SIEGE, A.D. 540.

ChosroÃ«s, king of Persia, having spread terror and dismay
throughout Syria by the capture of Sour (ancient Tyre) and
other places, presented himself before Antioch. The attack
and defence were equally warm and terrible in their results.
The besieged surrendered, after having exhausted all their
resources, and admitted the Persians within their walls.
The confusion was horrible in this populous and unfortunate
city. Men, women, and children crowded over each other
to escape the murderous sword of the conqueror; the streets
could not afford passage wide enough for the multitude.
The soldiers of the garrison, mingled with the fugitives,
overthrew the unhappy citizens, trampled them under their
horsesâ feet, and crushed them to death in their own city and
by their own troops. The conquerors, spread throughout all
the quarters, indulged in a license almost unheard of even in
such scenes: they pillaged and sacked the houses; they
pulled down and burnt all the public edifices; they profaned
and plundered the churches; they insulted and violated the
virgins consecrated to God; and the maidens and women
whose virtue they outraged were immolated before the eyes
of their husbands and parents. ChosroÃ«s himself animated
his troops to the carnage, and excited them to plunder. He
took possession of the gold and silver vases of the great
church, and sent into Persia all the valuable statues, rare
318

pictures, and precious objects that decorated that superb city.
When despoiled of all its ornaments and deprived of its
wealth, he ordered it to be reduced to ashes. This cruel
order was so punctually obeyed, that only one single quarter
escaped the flames. Thus was for the first time destroyed,
in the month of June, 540, a city which, by its size, wealth,
and population, rivalled Rome and Constantinople. Such
of the inhabitants as escaped the sword of the conqueror
were by him reduced to slavery, and sold by public auction
in Persia.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 638.

Antioch, however, soon arose again from its ruins, under
the protection of the emperors of the West. Great and well-situated
cities are not easily destroyed past recovery. Antioch
became once more rich and populous; but it seemed to
be its fate to succumb to the attacks of barbarians. It was
again besieged about a hundred years after the above-stated
catastrophe, by the Saracens, before the eyes of Prince Constantine,
son of the emperor Heraclius. The infidels approached
a bridge at a short distance from Antioch, called
the Bridge of Iron. Two towers, each furnished with three
hundred soldiers, were intrusted with the defence of it.
These degenerate Romans surrendered their posts to the
enemy; Constantine, in despair, could trust neither the
courage nor the fidelity of his troops. Very unlike the
Romans of the days of Pyrrhus, who would have thought
themselves dishonoured by taking advantage of a crime, this
prince resorted to the baseness of assassination as the surest
means of averting the storm which threatened Antioch. He
hoped to terminate the war by assassinating the caliph who
directed the enterprises of the Saracens. An assassin was
sent to Medina. Trembling at the sight of Omar, the
wretch confessed his intentions, and the name of the person
who employed him. Omar, so far from losing his life, acquired
the honour of pardoning the man who attempted it:
the Christian prince acquired the disgrace of having
attempted a crime, and failed in it. The two armies encamped
near Antioch. A general, named Nestorius, commanded
the Romans: endowed with the valour of a soldier,
he for a moment forgot that his life belonged to his army,
319

and challenged the bravest of the Mussulmans to single
combat. Dames, who had acquired the reputation of being
invincible at the siege of Aleppo, presented himself. His
horse stumbling whilst he was engaged with his enemy,
Dames was seized and conveyed a prisoner to the tent of the
challenger. Nestorius, proud of this chance victory, was
desirous of a fresh triumph. He offered a second challenge,
which was accepted by Dehac. The two champions fought
for a long time with equal success; when, exhausted by
fatigue, and their horses being jaded and breathless, they
separated to recruit their strength. During the second
conflict, Dames, having deceived the slaves who guarded
him, contrived to escape, and rejoined his comrades. A few
days after, the two armies engaged, and the Romans were
cut to pieces after a severe and bloody battle. A fresh
perfidy of Youckinna, formerly governor of Aleppo, contributed
greatly to the defeat of the Romans. This traitor
guarded in Antioch Derar and two hundred other Mussulman
prisoners. At the moment of the combat, he set them
at liberty, joined them to the troop he commanded, and
ranged himself under the standard of Mahomet. At the
sight of these new enemies, the Roman legions lost all courage;
they fancied the whole population of Antioch was
pouring out upon them. The field of battle was strewed
with dead. The inhabitants of Antioch, finding themselves
without resource, capitulated; to avoid being pillaged, they
paid the conqueror three hundred thousand pieces of gold,
amounting to about one hundred and seventy thousand
pounds sterling,âa sum which seems to us incredibly small
from such a city so circumstanced. Abou-ObÃ©idah entered
Antioch on the 21st of August. As he dreaded for his
soldiers the pleasures of this voluptuous city more than he
feared the Roman armies, he only allowed them to remain
there three days.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1097.

After a disastrous march, in which they had met with
many unexpected accidents and reverses, as well as triumphs,
the great army of the Crusaders, under Godfrey of Bouillon
and his chivalrous companions, advanced towards Antioch.

320

As we have seen in a former siege, the approach to this
great city of the East was guarded by a bridge over the
Orontes, on which were placed two towers covered with
iron. But nothing could resist the van led by the duke of
Normandy: the Normans soon took the bridge and passed
the river. Terror was spread amongst the Mussulmans, who
all flocked to the city as a place of refuge. The whole
Christian army drew up in battle-array, with trumpets
sounding and ensigns flying, and then encamped within a
mile of Antioch.

The aspect of this city, so celebrated in the annals of
Christianity, revived the religious enthusiasm of the Crusaders.
It was within the walls of Antioch that the
disciples of Christ had first assumed the name of Christians,
and that the apostle Peter was named the first pastor of the
nascent church. Antioch was as much celebrated in the
annals of the Roman empire as in those of the church. The
magnificence of its buildings, and its having been the abode
of several emperors, had acquired for it the name of the
Queen of the East. Its situation in a pleasant and fertile
country was, in all ages, attractive to foreigners. Within
two leagues, on the west, was a lake abounding in fish, which
communicated with the Orontes; on the south were the
faubourg and the fountain of Daphne, so celebrated in
pagan poetry. Not far from it arose the mountain of
Orontes, covered with gardens and houses of pleasure; and
on the north was another mountain, sometimes called the
Black Mountain, on account of its forests, and sometimes the
Water Mountain, on account of its numerous springs. The
river Orontes flowed at the foot of the ramparts of Antioch,
on the western side, and paid its tribute to the sea three
or four leagues from the city.

The walls inclosed four hills, separated by a torrent,
which threw itself into the river. Upon the western hill
was built a very strong citadel, which dominated the city.
The ramparts of Antioch, which were as solid as a rock,
were three leagues in circumference, and along them were
built no less than three hundred and sixty strong towers.
Broad ditches, the river Orontes, and marshes, still further
protected the inhabitants of Antioch, and prevented all
access to the city. At the approach of the Christians, most
321

of the inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces and cities
sought refuge in Antioch, with their families and their
property. Accien, the grandson of Malek-Schah, who had
obtained the sovereignty of the city, had shut himself up in
it with twenty thousand foot and seven thousand horse.

The siege of Antioch presented so many obstacles and
dangers, that the Crusaders deliberated whether they ought
in prudence to undertake it. The first who spoke in the
council thought it would be rash to commence a siege at
the approach of winter. They did not at all dread the arms
of the Saracens, but rains, frosts, storms, disease, and famine.
They advised the Crusaders to wait for the succours promised
by Alexius, and the return of the spring, by which
time the army would have repaired its losses, and would
have received under its standards fresh reinforcements from
the West. This advice was listened to very impatiently by
most of the leaders, who insisted upon the necessity of
taking advantage of the terror experienced by the Mussulmans.
They should have, they said, the caliph of Bagdad
and the king of Persia both upon them: delay would
strengthen the enemyâs army more than it would theirs;
they wanted no Greeks to assist them; and as to a little
rain and cold, it was an insult to the soldiers of Christ to
suppose they could not bear them!âwhy it was like comparing
them to birds of passage, who fly away and hide
themselves at the coming of winter! What need have they
to fear famine and want? Had not the Crusaders, till that
time, made war provide for itself? Victory had always
supplied the wants of the Christians, and abundance awaited
them in the city of Antioch, which would speedily open its
gates.

This speech prevailed with the most eager and the most
brave, and those who were of a different opinion were silenced
by the fear of being accused of timidity. Godfrey and the
legate, Adhemar, were both in favour of immediate attack.
The council decreed that the siege of Antioch should be
immediately commenced, and that same day the whole
Christian army advanced to the walls. Now, our readers,
in contemplating the army of the Crusaders, must not suppose
that, like any other army so joined, there was any
spirit of unity in it. It was assembled on various principles:
322

a few, and very few, were brought so far on their way to
Jerusalem by a purely religious motive; many, like Robert
of Normandy, were seduced by a wild chivalric love of
adventure, and a thirst for that military renown which was
so great an object with the age; but the bulk of this host
were men who had cast their all in an expedition which promised
unbounded wealthâthe leaders looked for dominions
and states, the soldiers for booty. They had, literally, emigrated;
their desire was to establish themselves in the
fabulously-represented rich countries of the East, and they
had neither hope nor intention to revisit Europe. There
was no acknowledged leader to direct proceedings or to
check want of discipline. We have an idea that Godfrey of
Bouillon was the leader; but in no point of fact was he so;
the leaders were all governed by their own interests; and if
Godfrey had thwarted those of Bohemond, Raymond de St.
Gilles, Robert of Normandy, Robert of Flanders, or any
other chief of rank, they would have paid no more attention
to his authority than to that of one of his horse-boys. From
this want of unity in the body, and unity of purpose, arose
almost all the disasters of the Crusades, of which silly
and wicked enterprises the reader will find an excellent
epitome in the account of this interesting siege. As we
said at the commencement of this work, the camp of the
Crusaders before Antioch was exactly like that of the Greeks
before Troy; and, strange to say, great resemblances might
be traced in the characters of the leaders, from Agamemnon
and Godfrey, Achilles and Tancred, Ulysses and Bohemond,
to Thersites and BarthÃ©lemi, the discoverer of the lance.

Bohemond and Tancred took their posts at the east, opposite
the gate of St. Paul, to the right of the Italians, the
Normans, the Britons, the Flemings, and the French, commanded
by the two Roberts; the count de Vermandois and
the count de Chartres encamped towards the north, before
the gate of the Dog; the count de Toulouse, the bishop of
Puy, and the duke of Lorraine, with their troops, occupied
the space from the gate of the Dog to the spot where the
Orontes, turning towards the west, approaches the walls of
Antioch. The Crusaders neglected to cover the southern
part, defended by the mountain of Orontes, as they likewise
did the western side of the city, which the river defended,
323

and by which the besieged could make sorties or receive
succours.

The Turks shut themselves up close within their walls;
all was quiet, all was silent. The Crusaders attributed this
to terror, and heedlessly spread themselves over the delightful
country, enjoying all the sweets of its climate and
productions. Abundance of provisions, the beautiful sky of
Syria, the fountain and groves of Daphne, famous in all
antiquity for the worship of Venus and Adonis, soon made
them lose sight of the Holy Land, and bred license and
corruption among the soldiers of Christ.

Whilst thus forgetful of discipline, as well as of their
purpose, they were attacked by the garrison of Antioch,
which surprised them, some lounging luxuriously in their
camp, and others wandering about the country. All whom
the hopes of pillage or the love of pleasure had seduced into
the neighbouring villages and orchards, met with slavery
or death. Young Alberon, archdeacon of Metz, son of
Conrad, count of Lunebourg, paid with his life for indulging
in amusements very little in accordance with the austerity
of his profession. He was found by the Turks, stretched
upon the grass, playing at dice with a Syrian courtesan.
Two strokes of the sabre removed the heads of the players,
which were pitched into the camp of the Crusaders, with
those of a great number of Christians. The latter deplored
their fault, and swore to avenge themselves.

The desire of repairing one error led them into another.
They resolved to scale the walls of Antioch, before they had
provided themselves with either ladders or machines of war.
Vengeance and fanaticism animated both leaders and soldiers,
but they could make no impression upon the walls of
the city, or disturb the security of its inhabitants. Several
other assaults proved equally useless. Experience, for whose
lessons they always paid so dearly, taught them that they
must invest the place, and prevent the arrival of any foreign
succour.

They established a bridge of boats across the Orontes,
and passed over some troops towards the western side of the
city. All methods were had recourse to to check the sorties
of the enemy; sometimes fortresses of wood were erected
close to the ramparts, sometimes they planted balistÃ¦, which
324

launched large stones at the besieged. To close the gate of
the Dog they were obliged to heap large beams, stones, and
pieces of rock against it. At the same time they intrenched
their camps, and took every precaution against surprise from
the Saracens.

The blockade of the city was now their object; but, as in
all such cases, the tediousness of a siege did not accord with
the impatience of warriors with an ulterior object in view.
On their arrival before Antioch, they thought they should
never again know want, and they wasted in a few days provisions
for several months; they thought about nothing but
meeting the enemy in the field of battle, and, confident of
victory, they neither provided against the rigours of winter
nor against a fast-approaching want of provisions.

The latter was not long in arriving. As soon as winter
set in, the unfortunate Crusaders found themselves a prey
to all sorts of calamities. Torrents of rain fell every day,
and the plains, which had recently been so delightful, were
almost covered with water. The camp, particularly in the
valley, was submerged several times; tempests and rains
carried away the pavilions and tents; humidity relaxed the
bows; rust gnawed the lances and swords. Most of the
soldiers were left destitute of clothes. Contagious complaints
carried off men and animals. Rains, cold, famine,
and epidemics made such ravages, that, according to William
of Tyre, the Crusaders wanted time and space to bury their
dead.

Amidst the general distress, Bohemond and the duke of
Normandy were charged with the task of scouring the
country in search of provisions. In the course of their
incursions they beat several detachments of the Saracens,
and returned to the camp with considerable booty. The
provisions they brought, however, could not long supply a
numerous army. Fresh incursions were made every day,
and every day they became less fortunate. All the countries
of Upper Syria had been ravaged by the Turks and the
Christians. The Crusaders on these parties often put the
Saracens to flight; but victory, which was almost always
their only resource in the moment of want, could not bring
back abundance into the camp. As a completion of their
misery, all communication with Constantinople was cut off;
325

the Pisan and Genoese fleets no longer coasted along the
shores occupied by the Christians. The port of St. Simeon,
situated at three leagues from Antioch, now saw no vessel
arrive from Greece or the West. The Flemish pirates who
had taken the cross at Tarsus, after gaining possession of
Laodicea, had been surprised by the Greeks, and several
weeks before had been made prisoners. The most melancholy
future threatened the Christians; they talked of
nothing but the losses they had experienced, and the evils
which hung over them; every day the most afflicting news
was spread through the army.

It was related that the son of Sweno, king of Denmark,
who had taken the cross, and who was leading to the holy
war fifteen hundred knights, had been surprised by the
Turks whilst advancing rapidly across the defiles of Cappadocia.
Attacked by an enemy superior in numbers, he had
defended himself during a whole day, without being able, by
his courage or the axes of his warriors, to repulse the attack
of the infidels. Florine, daughter of Eudes I., duke of
Burgundy, who accompanied the Danish hero, and to whom
he was to be married after the taking of Jerusalem, had
valiantly fought by his side. Transpierced by seven arrows,
and fighting still, she was endeavouring, with Sweno, to
open for herself a passage to the mountains, when they were
overwhelmed by their enemies. They fell together upon
the field of battle, after having seen all their knights and
faithful servants perish around them. âSuch was the news
brought to the Christian camp,â says William of Tyre,
âfull of sadness and grief, and with which, more than before,
were the hearts of all oppressed.â

Famine and disease increased; the Syrians who brought
provisions were so extortionate in their prices, that the
common soldiers could not purchase any. And not the
smallest of their griefs was the daily, almost hourly loss of
companions, countrymen, partakers of toils and dangers, to
whom a common lot and object had endeared them. Desertion
was soon added to the other evils. Most of the army
began to lose all hope of reaching the Holy City or even of
subduing Antioch; and some went to seek an asylum under
Baldwin, in Mesopotamia, whilst others stole away to the
cities of Cilicia, subject to the Christians.

326

The duke of Normandy retired to Laodicea, and did not
return until he had been thrice summoned by the army, in
the name of the religion of Christ. Tactius, the general of
Alexius, left the camp with his troops, promising to return
with reinforcements and provisions. His departure was not
regretted, and no hopes were built upon his promises. The
desertion became common even with the most brave and the
most zealous; not only did the stout warrior, the viscount
de Melun, whose use of the axe in battle had gained him
the name of âthe carpenter,â turn his back upon famine and
his suffering comrades, but even the devotion of Peter the
Hermit, the great cause of this monstrous removal of the
West to the East, was not proof against the misery all
endured, and he fled away secretly. This desertion, says a
chronicler, caused great scandal among the Christians, âand
did not astonish them less than if the stars had fallen from
the heavens.â But the indefatigable Tancred, the truest
knight of all the Crusades, pursued them, and brought back
both the carpenter and the hermit. Peter was bitterly
reproached, and was compelled to swear on the Gospel never
to repeat his offence.

But Peter might have urged a better plea than fear for
his flight: the Christian camp was the resort of all the vices.
âStrange and inconceivable spectacle,â says an eye-witness,
âbeneath the tents of the deliverers of Sion, were strangely
grouped famine and voluptuousness, impure love, a mad
passion for play, and all the excesses of debauchery mingled
with the most horrid images of death.â The pilgrims seemed
so debased by their misfortunes as to disdain the consolations
of piety and virtue. The clergy exerted themselves,
and punishments were devised; but of what use could these
prove, when many of the priesthood were as guilty as the
soldiers, and when those who ought to have carried out the
inflictions of the law, themselves hourly merited them?

Syrian spies, likewise, stole into the camp, who circulated
in the neighbouring cities exaggerated accounts of the distress,
the despair, and the vices of the Christians. In order
to deliver the army from this annoyance, Bohemond, whom
Mr. Gibbon too favourably styles the Ulysses of the Crusades,
devised a plan fit even to disgust barbarians. He
commanded some Turks, who were his prisoners, to be
327

brought to him. These he ordered to be immediately executed,
and their bodies to be roasted over a large fire, like
meat preparing for the supper of himself and his people;
directing it to be answered, if any one asked what was the
cause of the preparations and the smell: âThe princes and
governors of the camp have decreed in council that, from
this day forward, all Turks or spies found in the camp shall,
in this manner, be forced to make meat of their bodies, as
well for the princes as the army.â Bohemondâs servants
followed his instructions, and the strangers in the camp
were soon attracted by the report and the stench to the
prince of Tarentumâs quarters. âWhen they saw what was
going on,â says an ancient author, âthey were marvellously
terrified, and fled away to circulate through Syria an account
of the cannibalism of the Christians.â Bohemondâs plan,
however, succeeded; no more spies were seen in the camp.

The bishop of Puy carried into execution, about the same
time, a
ruse
of a much more agreeable nature. He caused
the neighbouring lands to be ploughed and sown with corn,
not only for the benefit of the army, but to prove to the
Saracens that they had no intention of abandoning the siege.

Winter at length departed; the contagious diseases
abated, the princes and monasteries of Armenia sent in provisions;
with the departure of famine hope revived, and,
strange to say, all these ameliorations were looked upon as
the fruits of their own amendments!

Ambassadors from Egypt then made their appearance, and
the Crusaders had recourse to all sorts of expedients to
impose upon their visitors. Their most splendid habiliments,
their most costly arms were exhibited, and the nobles and
knights displayed their skill and courage in jousts and
tournaments, and their graces in the danceâbehind lingered
want and privations; in the eyes of the strangers all was
joy and festivity. The Egyptians professed great friendship
for the Crusaders, with admiration of their military virtues:
their master made vast promises, and said they had liberty
to enter the Holy City, provided they went without arms,
and only staid one month. If the Crusaders submitted to
these conditions, the caliph of Egypt would be their firmest
support; but if they scorned his friendship, the peoples of
Ethiopia and Egypt, all who inhabit Asia and Africa, from
328

the Strait of Gades to the gates of Bagdad, would rise at the
voice of the legitimate vicar of the Prophet, and show the
warriors of the West the power of their arms.

To this speech a spirited reply was instantly made, rejecting
all Mussulman favours, expressing a reliance upon God
for the delivery of the holy places, of which, they said, the
Christians were determined to be the guardians and the
masters: âGo, and tell him who sent you, that the Christians
encamped before Antioch neither fear the peoples of Ethiopia,
Egypt, nor Bagdad, and that they only form alliances with
powers which respect the laws of justice and the standard of
Christ.â

This was the sentiment of the Crusaders; but they, nevertheless,
did not entirely reject alliance with the caliph.
They sent deputies and presents back with the ambassadors.

Scarcely had they departed, when the Christians gained a
fresh victory over the Turks. The sultans of Aleppo and
Damascus, with the emirs of CÃ¦sarea, Emessa, and Hierapolis
had raised an army of twenty thousand horse, to succour
Antioch. This army was already approaching the city,
when it was stopped and cut to pieces by Bohemond and
the count de St. Gilles, who had gone out to meet it. The
Turks lost two thousand men and a thousand horses; and
the city of Harem, in which they endeavoured to find safety,
likewise fell into the hands of the Christians. At the
moment the Egyptian ambassadors were embarking at Port
St. Simeon, four camels brought them the heads and the
spoils of two hundred Mussulmans. The conquerors threw
two hundred other heads into the city of Antioch, the garrison
of which was anxiously looking out for succours. A
number of heads were also stuck on pikes round the walls.
This they did in revenge for some gross insults the Saracens
had lavished upon an image of the Virgin which had fallen
into their hands.

The Crusaders had soon occasion to display their valour
in a much more perilous and sanguinary combat. A fleet
of Genoese and Pisans entered the port of St. Simeon; this
caused the greatest joy, and the soldiers rushed in crowds
towards the port, to get news from Europe and obtain necessaries
and provisions. As they returned, laden with what
they had acquired, and mostly unarmed, they were attacked
329

by a body of four thousand Saracens, who laid wait for them
on their passage. In vain Bohemond, the count de St.
Gilles, and Bishop Adhemar hastened to their assistance; the
Christians could not sustain the shock of the infidels, and
retreated in great disorder.

The report of this defeat soon reached the camp, and
Godfrey immediately summoned all to arms. Followed by
his brother Eustace, the two Roberts and the count de Vermandois,
he crossed the Orontes, and went in pursuit of the
pursuers. When he came up with the Saracens, he shouted
to his companions âto follow his example,â and fell, sword
in hand, upon the ranks of the Mussulmans. Accustomed
to distant fight, and to employ the bow and arrow, these
could not stand against the sword and the lance of the Crusaders:
they took to flight, some towards the mountains,
and some towards the city. Accien, who, from the towers
of his palace, had beheld the victorious attack of the Crusaders,
sent a numerous detachment to assist his flying troops.
He accompanied them to the gate of the bridge, which he
caused to be shut after them, telling them it should not be
re-opened till they had gained the victory.

This fresh body of Saracens was quickly beaten in its turn.
The Turks had no other hope but that of regaining the city;
but Godfrey had placed himself upon an eminence between
the fugitives and the gates. It was there the carnage began;
the Christians were animated by their victory, the Saracens
by their despair and the cries of the inhabitants assembled
on the ramparts. Nothing can paint the tumult of this fresh
combat. The clash of arms and the shouts of the soldiers
drowned the voices of the commanders; they fought hand
to hand, in perfect disorder, whilst clouds of dust hung over
the field of battle. Chance directed the blows of both the
conquerors and the conquered; the Saracens pressed upon
each other, and embarrassed their own flight. The confusion
was so great that many Crusaders were killed by their
companions in arms. A vast number of Saracens fell beneath
the swords of the Christians, almost without resistance;
more than two thousand were drowned in the Orontes.
âThe old men of Antioch,â says William of Tyre, âwho contemplated
this sanguinary catastrophe from the top of their
walls, lamented that they had lived so long; and women,
330

witnesses of the death of their sons, wept that they had ever
been mothers.â The slaughter lasted the whole day, and it
was not till towards evening that Accien allowed the gates
to be opened to the miserable remains of his troops.

The leaders and soldiers of the Christian army had performed
prodigies of valour. Bohemond, Raymond, Tancred,
Adhemar, Baldwin du Bourg, and Eustace had constantly
shown themselves at the head of their warriors. The whole
army concurred in admiration of the marvellous lance-thrusts
and feats of arms of the count de Vermandois and the two
Roberts. Robert of Normandy maintained, alone, a conflict
with an infidel chief at the head of his people. With one
blow of his sabre he split his head to the shoulder, and laid
him at his feet, exclaiming: âI devote thy impure soul to
the powers of hell!â âTancred,â says Ralph of Caen, âdistinguished
himself among the most intrepid of the knights.
In the heat of the
mÃªlÃ©e
, the Christian hero, as modest as he
was brave, made his squire swear not to reveal the exploits
of which he was a witness.â Godfrey, who in this battle
had displayed the skill of a great captain, likewise signalized
his bravery and strength by actions which history and poetry
have celebrated. No armour could resist his trenchant
blade; lances, casques, and cuirasses flew in splinters beneath
its stroke. A Saracen of surpassing stature singled him out
in the
mÃªlÃ©e
, and, at his first blow, shivered Godfreyâs buckler
to pieces. Indignant at this audacity, Godfrey raised himself
in his stirrups, rushed upon his enemy, and dealt him so
terrible a blow on the shoulder, that he split his body into
two parts, âthe first of which,â say the historians, âfell to the
earth, and the other was carried by his horse into the city,
to the horror and consternation of the inhabitants.â

Notwithstanding these prodigious exploits, the Christians
sustained a considerable loss. Whilst celebrating the valour
of the Crusaders, contemporary history is astonished at the
multitude of martyrs whom the Saracens sent to heaven,
and who, on arriving in the abode of the blessed with crowns
upon their heads and palms in their hands, addressed God
in these words: âWhy have you not defended our blood,
which has flowed for you this day?â

PROWESS OF THE CRUSADERS BEFORE ANTIOCH.

The Saracens passed the night in burying their dead near
a mosque without the walls. Their sad duty performed, they
331

retired. The Christians, however, knew that the Mussulmans
never despoiled the bodies of their countrymen before
they inhumed them, and flocked in crowds to the plunder of
them. They tore up the bodies, and stripped them of the
arms and clothes with which they were covered. They then
returned to exhibit to their fellows in the camp the silk
stuffs, bucklers, lances, javelins, and rich swords found in
the graves. This spectacle did not in the least disgust
the knights and barons. The day after the battle, among
the spoils of the vanquished, they contemplated with
pleasure fifteen hundred heads separated from their
trunks, which were paraded in triumph through the army,
and reminded them of their victory and of the loss of the
infidels.

All these heads cast into the Orontes with the bodies of
the Mussulmans who the preceding day had been drowned
in the river, went to convey the news of the victory to the
Genoese and Pisans at Port St. Simeon.

The leaders now thought of nothing but taking advantage
of the terror with which they had inspired the Mussulmans.
Masters of the cemetery, they pulled down the mosque, and
employed the stones, even of the tombs, to build a fortress
before the gate of the bridge by which the besieged made
their sorties. Raymond, who had been accused of want of
zeal for the holy war, constructed this fort and took charge
of the perilous post. It was proposed to raise a new fortress
near the first, and as none of the leaders came forward
to erect it, Tancred offered his services,âa generous and
loyal knight; he had nothing left but his sword and his
renown. He asked his companions for money, and undertook
the danger of the enterprise. All were eager to second
his courageous devotion; the works he directed were soon
finished; and from that time the besieged were closely shut
up within the inclosure of their walls.

The Crusaders having thus blockaded the city, seized the
Syrians who had been accustomed to bring provisions to
Antioch, and only spared their lives upon their swearing to
supply the Christian army. Learning that Accien had sent
away a great many of his horses to a valley some leagues
from the city, they repaired thither by by-roads, and
gained possession of the rich booty. Two thousand horses
332

and as many mules were led in triumph to the Christian
camp.

Many of the Genoese and Pisans were skilful engineers,
and they were employed in directing the labours of the
siege. Machines of war were built, and Antioch was threatened
on all sides. Whilst despair supplied the place of
courage with the Saracens, zeal and emulation increased
among the Crusaders; many whom want or fear had driven
away, returned to their standards, and sought every opportunity
of wiping out the disgrace of their desertion. The
besiegers no longer thought of repose, and breathed nothing
but fight. The women seconded the valour of the warriors;
some fought by their sides in the ranks, whilst others supplied
them with food and munitions when they were
engaged. The children even formed bands, and went through
their military exercises. The inhabitants of Antioch opposed
their children to those of the Christians, and several
times these young combatants engaged in the presence of
the besiegers and the besieged, who took an interest in the
fight, and animated their party by voice and gesture when
they appeared to give way.

There was formed at the same time another militia, much
more formidable to the Saracens. The mendicants and vagabonds
who followed the army were employed in the labours
of the siege, under the orders of a captain, who took the
title of
Truand
King, or King of the Beggars. They received
pay from the general chest; and as soon as they were
in a condition to purchase arms and clothes, the king denied
them as his subjects, and made them enter into one of the
corps of the army. This measure, whilst removing the vagabonds
from their dangerous idleness, made useful auxiliaries
of them. As they were accused of violating graves and
feeding on human flesh, they inspired great horror and fear
among the infidels, who fled away at their approach.

Antioch was so warmly pressed, and the garrison had so
little means of defence, that the Crusaders expected every
day to be masters of it. Accien demanded a truce, and
promised to surrender if not speedily succoured. The Crusaders,
always full of blind confidence, had the imprudence
to accept the proposals of the governor. As soon as they
had made a truce with the Saracens, the leaders of the army,
333

who seldom agreed anywhere but in the field of battle, and
whom danger even could not always unite, were on the
point of declaring war among themselves.

Baldwin, prince of Edessa, had sent some magnificent
presents to Godfrey, the two Roberts, the count de Vermandois,
and the counts of Blois and Chartres; he had
distributed sums of money to the whole army; but in
bestowing his largesses, he had purposely left out Bohemond
and his soldiers. This was quite enough to create a division.
Whilst the Christian army was loud in the praises of the
liberality of Baldwin, the prince of Tarentum and his warriors
breathed nothing but complaints and murmurs.

At the same time, a richly ornamented tent, which an
Armenian prince destined for Godfrey, and which, falling
into the hands of Pancratius, was sent to Bohemond, became
a fresh subject of trouble and discord. Godfrey
haughtily claimed the present which had been intended for
him; Bohemond refused to give it up. Both parties proceeded
to abuse and threats; they were eager to have
recourse to arms, and Christian blood was about to flow in
a contemptible quarrel. But at length the prince of Tarentum,
abandoned by the greater part of the army and conquered
by the prayers of his friends, surrendered the tent to
his rival, consoling his vexation with the hope that the
chance of war would soon bestow upon him a much richer
booty.

Whilst these quarrels occupied the Christian army, the
inhabitants of Antioch received reinforcements and prepared
for a fresh resistance. When they had obtained all they
stood in need of, they broke the truce and recommenced the
war with all the advantages a foolishly-granted peace had
given them.

Antioch, after a seven monthsâ siege, would have escaped
the hands of the Christians, if cunning, policy, and ambition
had not done more for their cause than patience and valour
had been able to do. Bohemond, whom the hopes of bettering
his fortunes had drawn into the crusade, was always on
the watch to realize his projects. The success of Baldwin
had roused his jealousy, and pursued him even in his sleep.
He ventured to cast his eyes upon Antioch, and was sufficiently
favoured by circumstances to find a man who had it
334

in his power to place that city in his hands. This man, who
was named
Phirous
, was the son of an Armenian, a maker
of cuirasses. Of a restless, uneasy character, he was constantly
in hopes of changing his condition. He had abjured
the Christian religion in a spirit of inconstancy and with the
expectation of advancing his fortune. He was endowed
with wonderful coolness, with unconquerable audacity, and
was always ready to do that for money which could scarcely
be expected from the most ardent fanaticism. To satisfy
his ambition and avarice, nothing appeared unjust or impossible.
Being active, cunning, and insinuating, he had obtained
the confidence of Accien, who admitted him to his
counsels. The prince of Antioch had confided the command
of three of his principal towers to him. He at first defended
them with zeal, but without any advantage to his fortune:
he grew weary of a sterile fidelity as soon as he was
brought to think that treachery might be more profitable to
him.

In the intervals between the battles he had had frequent
opportunities of seeing the prince of Tarentum. These two
men divined each otherâs character at first sight, and were
not long in coming to an understanding. Phirous complained
of the outrages he had received from the Mussulmans;
he lamented having abandoned the religion of Christ,
and wept over the persecutions the Christians of Antioch
endured. There required no more than this to make such a
man as the prince of Tarentum acquainted with the secret
thoughts of the renegade. He commended his remorse,
approved of his sentiments, and made him most magnificent
promises. Then Phirous opened his heart to him. They
swore a mutual and inviolable attachment, and promised to
keep up an active correspondence. They afterwards saw
each other several times, but always with the greatest
secrecy. At every interview, Bohemond told Phirous that
the fate of the Crusaders was in his hands, and that it only
remained with himself to obtain an immense recompense
from them. On his side, Phirous protested that he had a
great desire to serve the Crusaders, whom he looked upon
as his brothers; and to assure the prince of Tarentum of his
fidelity, or to excuse his treachery, he said that Christ had
appeared to him and advised him to give Antioch up to the
335

Christians. Bohemond had no need of a similar protestation.
He had no trouble in believing what he wished for
with so much ardour; and when he had agreed with Phirous
upon the means by which the projects they had a long time
meditated should be executed, he called an assembly of the
principal leaders of the Christian army. He dwelt with
great warmth upon the evils which to that period had desolated
the Crusaders, and the yet greater evils with which
they were still threatened. He added that a powerful army
was advancing to the succour of Antioch; that they could
not retreat without shame and danger; and that there was
no safety for the Christians but in the conquest of the city.
The place, it was true, was defended by inexpugnable ramparts;
but they must be aware that all victories are not
gained by arms or in the field of battle; that those which
were obtained by address were neither the least important nor
the least glorious. They who could not be conquered might
be seduced, and enemies might be overcome by an adroit
and generous enterprise. Among the inhabitants of Antioch,
widely differing in morals and religion, opposite in interests,
there must be some to be found who would be accessible to
baits of gold or to brilliant promises. It concerned a service
of such importance to the Christian army, that all sorts
of attempts were justifiable. The possession even of Antioch
itself did not appear to him to be too much to hold out as a
reward to him who should be skilful or fortunate enough to
throw open the gates to the Crusaders.

Bohemond did not explain himself more clearly, but
several of the leaders, who, perhaps, entertained the same
views, easily fathomed his meaning. Raymond, in particular,
spoke strongly against the artful insinuations of the
prince of Tarentum. âWe are all,â said he, âbrothers and
companions in arms, and it would be unjust, that after
having all run the same risk, one alone should gather the
fruit of our labours. As for myself,â added he, casting a
look of anger and contempt at Bohemond, âI have not
traversed so many countries, and braved so many perils; I
have not been prodigal of my blood, my soldiers, and my
treasures, to pay with the price of our conquests some gross
artifice, some disgraceful stratagem, the invention of which
should be left to women.â As none of the Crusaders were
336

actuated by a more palpable ambition, or by meaner or more
sordid views than Bohemond of Tarentum and Raymond of
Toulouse, they were upon all occasions at variance, and by
their wrangling laid their characters open to the whole army.
Raymondâs vehement words produced all the effect that
might be expected among warriors accustomed to conquer
by arms, and who valued no advantage that was not purchased
by bravery. Most of the leaders rejected Bohemondâs
proposals, and joined their railleries to those of Raymond.
Bohemond, with his Ulyssian tact, did his best to conceal
his vexation and malice. He left the council with a smile
on his lip, perfectly satisfied that necessity would soon bring
the Crusaders to his opinion.

He made it his first business to spread, by means of
emissaries, the most alarming reports throughout the camp.
Some of the leaders went out to reconnoitre, and to learn if
there were any foundation for these rumours. They speedily
returned, announcing the approach of Kerbogha, sultan of
Mossoul, with an army of two hundred thousand men. This
army, which had threatened Edessa and ravaged Mesopotamia,
was within seven daysâ march of Antioch. At this
account the fears of the Crusaders were redoubled.
Bohemond went among the ranks, exaggerating the peril;
he affected more distress and terror than the rest, but in
his heart he rejoiced at the idea of soon seeing his hopes
accomplished. The leaders again assembled to deliberate
upon the measures that ought to be taken under such
perilous circumstances. Two opinions divided the council.
Some proposed that they should raise the siege, and go and
meet the Saracens; others, that the army should be divided
into two bodies, one of which should march against Kerbogha,
and the other remain in charge of the camp. This
last advice was about to prevail, when Bohemond demanded
permission to speak. He had not much difficulty in demonstrating
the difficulties of both plans. If they raised the
siege, they would be placed between the garrison of Antioch
and a formidable army. If they continued the blockade,
and half the army only went to meet Kerbogha, they would
certainly risk a double defeat. âThe greatest perils,â added
the prince of Tarentum, âsurround us. Time presses;
to-morrow, perhaps, it will be too late to act; to-morrow we
337

shall have lost the fruit of all our labours and all our victories.
But no, I cannot think so; God, who has conducted
us hither, will not permit that we should have fought in his
cause in vain. He will save the Christian army, he will
lead us to the tomb of His Son. If you will listen to the
proposal I am about to make to you, to-morrow the standard
of the cross shall float over the walls of Antioch, and we
shall march in triumph to Jerusalem.â

On finishing these words, Bohemond exhibited the letters
of Phirous, in which he promised to surrender the three
towers he commanded. Phirous declared that he was ready
to fulfil his promises, but that he would have nothing to do
with any one but the prince of Tarentum. He required, as
the price of his services, that Bohemond should remain
master of Antioch. The Italian prince affirmed that he had
already given considerable sums to Phirous; that he alone
had obtained his confidence, and that a reciprocal confidence
was the surest guarantee of success in so difficult an enterprise.
âAs to the rest,â added he, âif a better means of
saving the army can be found, I am ready to approve of it,
and will willingly renounce my share of a conquest upon
which the safety of all the Crusaders depends.â

The peril daily became greater; it was disgraceful to fly,
imprudent to fight, and dangerous to temporize. Fear put
all the interests of rivalry to silence. The greater the opposition
the leaders had at first shown to the proposals of
Bohemond, the more abundant did they now find the reasons
for adopting them. A divided conquest was no conquest;
besides, a partition of Antioch might give birth to a thousand
differences in the army, and lead to its ruin. They
only gave away that which they did not possess, and they
gave it to secure the lives of the Christians. Better one
should profit by the labours of all, than that all should
perish out of opposition to the good fortune of one. Besides,
the taking of Antioch was not the great object of the
Crusade; they had taken arms to deliver Jerusalem. Every
delay was contrary to what religion hoped for from its
soldiers, and to what the West expected from its bravest
knights. All the leaders, except the inflexible Raymond,
united in granting the principality of Antioch to Bohemond,
and conjured him to press the execution of his project.

338

The moment he left the council, Bohemond informed
Phirous of what had taken place, and the latter sent him his
son as a hostage. The execution of the plan was fixed for
the next day. To leave the garrison of Antioch in the greater
security, the Christians were to quit their camp and direct
their march towards the route by which Kerboghaâs army
was expected, and were to return to the walls of Antioch
during the night. The next day, at dawn, the troops
received orders to prepare for their departure; they left the
camp a few hours before nightfall, with trumpets sounding
and ensigns flying, and after a short march retraced their
steps, and came in silence towards Antioch. At a signal
given by the prince of Tarentum, they halted in a valley
west of the city, near the tower of the Three Sisters, commanded
by Phirous. It was there that the secret of the
great enterprise which was to open the gates to them was
revealed to the Christian army.

These deeply-laid plans, however, were very near failing.
At the moment the army left the camp, a report was circulated
in Antioch that a plot was on foot. The Christians
and newly-converted Mussulmans were suspected, and the
name of Phirous was heard coupled with accusations of
keeping up an intelligence with the besiegers. He was
obliged to appear before Accien, who interrogated him
sternly, with his eyes fixed upon him, to read his purpose in
his countenance: but Phirous dispersed all suspicions by
his self-possession. He himself proposed measures for
detecting the traitors, if there were any; and advised his
master to change the commanders of the principal towers.
This advice was highly approved of, and Accien said he
would follow it the next day. At the same time orders were
issued to place all the Christians in the city in chains
during the darkness of night. The renegade was then sent
to his post, loaded with praises for his exactitude and fidelity.
As night approached, everything appeared tranquil in Antioch,
and Phirous, thinking his danger was over, awaited the
Crusaders in the tower he had engaged to surrender.

As his brother commanded a tower next to his, he went
to him, and endeavoured to draw him into the plot.
âBrother,â said he, âyou know that the Crusaders are
gone to meet Kerbogha. When I reflect upon the miseries
339

they have endured, and upon the death which threatens
them, I cannot help entertaining a kind of pity for them.
You are not ignorant that the Christian inhabitants of
Antioch, after having suffered all sorts of outrages, are to
be massacred by the orders of Accien. I cannot help
pitying them, nor can I forget that we were born of the
same religion, and were formerly brethren.â These words
did not produce the effect Phirous expected. âI am astonished,â
replied his brother, âthat you should pity men who
ought to inspire you with nothing but horror. Before the
Crusaders arrived before Antioch, we were loaded with
blessings. We have since passed our lives amidst dangers
and alarms. May all the ills they have brought us recoil
upon themselves! As for the Christians residing among us,
donât you know that they are almost all traitors, and only
wish to deliver us to the swords of our enemies?â At these
words he cast a threatening glance upon Phirous. The
renegade saw that he was at least suspected. He acknowledged
no brother in the man who refused to be his accomplice,
and, as his only reply, plunged his dagger into his heart.

The decisive moment arrived. The night was dark, and
a storm which had risen, considerably augmented the
obscurity. The wind, which shook the roofs of the houses,
together with the incessant peals of thunder, prevented the
soldiers from hearing any noise round the ramparts. The
sky looked inflamed towards the west, and the sight of a
comet, which appeared above the horizon, seemed to
announce to the superstitious minds of the Crusaders the
moment destined for the destruction of the infidels. They
awaited the signal with impatience. A Lombard, named
Payen, sent by Bohemond, ascended the tower by a ladder
of leather. Phirous received him, told him all was prepared,
and, to convince him of his fidelity, pointed to the dead
body of his brother. Whilst they were talking, an officer of
the garrison came to visit the posts. He presented himself
with a lantern before the tower. Phirous, without showing
the least fear, concealed Bohemondâs messenger, and went
forward to meet the officer. He received praises for his
vigilance, and then hastened to send back Payen. The
Lombard rejoined his comrades, and conjured Bohemond,
on the part of Phirous, not to lose a moment.

340

But all at once a panic seized the soldiers: at the moment
of execution, they perceived the full extent of the danger.
Not one came forward to mount the ladder. In vain
Godfrey and the prince of Tarentum employed by turns
promises and threats: both leaders and soldiers remained
motionless. Bohemond then ascended by a rope ladder,
with the hope that his example would be followed by some
of the bravest; but nobody felt it his duty to meet the risk.
He arrived alone on the tower, where Phirous reproached
him warmly for his tardiness. Bohemond redescended in
haste, and told the soldiers all was ready to receive them.
His words, but still more his example, at length revived the
courage of the men. Sixty Crusaders prepared for the escalade.
Encouraged by one Foulcher of Chartres, whom the
historian of Tancred compares to an eagle conducting his
young ones and flying at their head, they seized the ladder
of leather and ascended the tower. Among these sixty was
the count of Flanders, with many of the principal leaders.
Sixty others soon followed the steps of the first, and these
were followed by such numbers, and so precipitately, that
the parapet to which the ladder was fastened gave way, and
fell with a crash into the ditch. Those who were near the
summit of the walls fell upon the lances and swords of their
companions. All was confusion and disorder among the
assailants; the leaders of the enterprise nevertheless looked
on with a tranquil eye. Phirous, over the bloody body of
his brother, embraced his new companions, gave up to their
swords another brother who was with him, and put them in
possession of the three towers confided to his command.
Seven other towers soon fell into their hands. Phirous then
called upon all the Christian army to advance; he fastened
a fresh ladder to the rampart, by which the most impatient
ascended, and pointed out to others a gate they could break
in, and by which they entered the city in crowds.

Godfrey, Raymond, and the count of Normandy were
soon in the streets of Antioch with their battalions. All
the trumpets were sounded, and the four hills of the city
resounded with the terrible cry, â
Dieu le veut! Dieu le
veut!
â At the first report of the tumult, the Christian
inhabitants of Antioch believed their last hour to be come,
and that the Mussulmans were about to cut their throats.
341

The latter, half-asleep, crawled from their houses to inquire
the cause of the noise they heard, and died without knowing
who were the traitors, or by what hand they were struck.
Some, when aware of the danger, fled towards the mountain
upon which the citadel was built; whilst others rushed out
at the gates of the city. All who could not fly fell beneath
the swords of the conquerors.

Notwithstanding the confusion, Bohemond did not fail
to take possession of Antioch; and when day appeared,
his red flag was seen floating over one of the highest towers
of the city. At sight of this, the Crusaders left in charge
of the camp uttered loud shouts of joy, and flocked to the
city to partake of the new conquest. The slaughter of the
Mussulmans was pursued with fury. The Christians, who
had suffered much, exhibited their chains to their liberators,
and increased their thirst for blood: the public places were
covered with dead bodies, and blood flowed down all the
streets. Every house and thing that was not marked with
a cross was the object of their fury; all who did not pronounce
the name of Christ were massacred without mercy.

In a single night, more than ten thousand of the inhabitants
of Antioch perished; many who attempted to escape
were brought back to either death or slavery. Accien,
finding he was betrayed, and not daring to place confidence
in any of his officers, resolved to fly towards Mesopotamia,
and meet Kerbogha. After leaving the gates, he was proceeding
without any escort, through forests and over mountains,
when he fell in with some Armenian woodcutters.
These men recognised the prince of Antioch, and as he was
without a train, and bore upon his countenance the marks
of depression and grief, they judged the city must be taken.
One of them went up to him, snatched his sword from him,
and plunged it into his heart. His head was brought to the
new masters of Antioch, and Phirous was able to contemplate
without fear the features of him who, the evening
before, might have commanded his death. After having
received great wealth as the reward of his treachery, the
renegade re-embraced the Christianity he had abandoned,
and followed the Crusaders to Jerusalem. Two years after,
his ambition not being satisfied, he returned to the religion
of Mahomet, and died abhorred by both Mussulmans and
342

Christians, whose cause he had by turns embraced and
betrayed.

When tired of slaughter, the Christians turned their
attention towards the citadel; but that, being situated upon
an almost inaccessible mountain, set their efforts at defiance.
They satisfied themselves with surrounding it with machines
of war and soldiers, and proceeded to indulge in all the
intoxication inspired by their victory. The pillage of
Antioch yielded immense treasures; and, although provisions
did not abound, they gave themselves up to intemperance
and debauchery.

These things took place in the early part of June, 1098;
the siege had commenced in the month of October, the
preceding year. After this success, for we cannot call it a
victory, three days quickly passed away in rejoicings and
festivity; but the fourth was a day of fear and of mourning.

A formidable army of Saracens approached Antioch. All
the powers of the East were roused by the successes of the
Christians, and Asia Minor seemed to be in arms to repel
the attack of Europe. Kerbogha, sultan of Mossoul, commanded
the Mussulman forces. This formidable leader had
gained great experience in civil wars. Despising the
Christians and confident in himself, the true model of the
fierce Circassian celebrated by Tasso, he already considered
himself the liberator of Asia. Three sultans, the governor
of Jerusalem, and twenty-eight emirs, marched in his train.
Animated by the thirst of vengeance, the Mussulman
soldiers swore by their prophet to exterminate the Christians;
and, three days after the taking of Antioch, the army
of Kerbogha pitched their tents upon the banks of the
Orontes. Their approach was announced to the Christians
by the appearance of three hundred horsemen, who came
under the walls to reconnoitre. Anxiety and alarm instantly
succeeded to joy and excess; for they at once perceived
that they had not provisions for a siege. Troops were sent
to forage in all directions, but as the territory of Antioch
had been ravaged for several months, they returned, to the
consternation of their comrades, almost empty-handed.
The moment the infidels arrived, they attacked the advanced
posts of the Crusaders. In these early combats, the
Christians had to lament the loss of some of their bravest
343

warriors. Bohemond was wounded in a sortie. In vain
Tancred and Godfrey performed progidies of valour; the
Mussulmans drove the Christians into the city, in which
they were now, in their turn, besieged.

Placed between the vast Mussulman army and the garrison
of the citadel, the position of the Crusaders was
awful. Kerbogha took possession of the port of St. Simeon,
so that no provisions could reach them by sea, and famine
very quickly began to exercise cruel ravages upon the besieged.

At the very commencement of the siege, the commonest
necessaries were worth their weight in gold. A moderate-sized
loaf was worth a byzant, an egg as much as six
Lucchese deniers; a pound-weight of silver was given for
the head of an ox, of a horse, or of an ass. Godfrey gave
fifteen silver marks for a lean camel, and three marks for a
goat, which, at other times, would have been disdained by the
meanest soldier of his army. Our readers will not fail to
observe that these prices did not only bespeak the scarcity
of provisions, they announced the abundance of money;âthe
army was rich with the late plunder of the city. After
having slaughtered most of their horses, they were obliged
to have recourse to unclean animals. The soldiers and the
poor who followed the army lived upon leaves and roots;
some even went so far as to devour the leather of their
bucklers and shoes: the most destitute exhumed the bodies
of the Saracens, and, to support their wretched existence,
disputed his prey with Death. In this frightful distress,
agonized mothers could no longer support their children,
and with them died of despair and hunger. Princes and
knights, whose pride had been most conspicuous, were
debased to the asking of charity. The count of Flanders
went about the streets and to the houses of Antioch, begging
for the grossest food, and which he frequently could
not obtain. More than one leader sold his equipments and
his arms to purchase food for a single day. As long as the
duke of Lorraine had anything eatable left, he shared it
with his companions; at length he made the sacrifice of
his last war-horse, and was, like the other Crusaders,
reduced to the most cruel necessity.

Many of the Crusaders endeavoured to fly from a city
which presented nothing but the image and the prospect of
344

death; some fled towards the sea, through a thousand
dangers; others cast themselves amongst the Mussulmans,
where they purchased a morsel of bread by abandonment of
Christ and his religion. The soldiers lost courage at seeing
the count de Melun fly, for the second time: he could brave
any dangers in the field of battle, but he could not endure
hunger and misery. His desertion was preceded by that of
the count de Blois, who bore the standard of the Crusaders,
and presided in council. He had quitted the army two
days before the taking of Antioch; and when he learnt the
arrival of Kerbogha, marched towards Constantinople. The
deserters escaped during the darkness of night. Sometimes
they precipitated themselves into the ditches of the city, at
the risk of their lives; and others slipped down the rampart
with the aid of ropes. The Christians found themselves
every day abandoned by a great number of their companions;
which added to their despair. Heaven was invoked
against these cowards; God was implored that in another
life they might share the punishment of the traitor Judas.
The ignominious epithet of
rope-dancers
was affixed to their
names, and devoted them to the scorn of their contemporaries.
William of Tyre refuses to name any of these
fugitives, as he considers them razed from the Book of
Life. The ill-wishes of the Christians directed against these
fugitives were but too completely fulfilled; most of them
perished of want, and the rest were killed by the Saracens.

Stephen, count of Chartres, more fortunate than his companions,
arrived safely at the camp of Alexius, who was
advancing at the head of an army towards Antioch. To
excuse his desertion, he did not fail to paint in the darkest
colours the ills and perils of the Christians, and to make it
evident by his recital that God had abandoned the cause of
the Christians. The despair of some Latin pilgrims who
followed the army of the Greeks was so violent, that it
inspired them with horrible blasphemies. They demanded
with groans why the true God had permitted the destruction
of His people? why He had allowed to fall into the hands of
His enemies those who came to deliver the tomb of His
Son? Nothing was heard among the Latin Crusaders but
these strange speeches; the most violent in his despair being
Guy, the brother of Bohemond. In the excess of his grief,
345

he blasphemed more than any of the rest, and said he could
not understand the mysteries of Providence, which betrayed
the cause of the Christians.

The emperor Alexius, who had advanced as far as Philomelum,
terrified at all he heard, did not dare to continue
his march towards Antioch. He thought, says Anna Comnena,
that it would be rash to endeavour to succour a city
whose fortifications had been ruined by a long siege, and
had no defenders but soldiers reduced to the lowest misery.
Alexius still further reflected, adds the same historian, upon
the indiscretion and the inconstancy of the Franks, upon
their manner of making war without either art or rules;
upon the imprudence with which, after having conquered
their enemies, they allowed themselves to be surprised by
the very people they had conquered. He thought likewise
of the difficulty he should have in making his arrival known
to the Crusaders, and of the still greater difficulty of agreeing
with their leaders respecting the measures to be taken
in order to save them.

All these motives were one-sidedly reasonable. Alexius
hated the Crusaders quite as much as he did the Turks, and
no doubt rejoiced to see them destroy each other. He
returned towards Constantinople, dragging in his train half
the inhabitants of the countries he passed through, they
being afraid of being left to the mercy of the Mussulmans.

The news of this retreat completed the despair of the
Christians: hope was gone; deaths increased awfully; their
enfeebled hands could scarcely wield the lance or the sword;
they had neither the strength to defend their lives nor to
bury the dead. Amidst such frightful misery, no more tears
were seen to flow, no more groans were heard, the silence
was as complete in Antioch as if it had been perpetual night,
or that no one was left in it. The Crusaders were abandoned
even by the courage of despair. The last feeling of
nature, love of life, became fainter in their hearts every day;
they dreaded to meet each other in the public places, and
remained concealed in the interior of their houses, which they
looked upon as their tombs.

The towers and ramparts were almost without defence.
Bohemond, as lord of the place, in vain endeavoured by
words and exertions to keep up the courage of the Crusaders;
346

the summons of the serjeant-at-arms, or the trumpet-call,
was equally unresponded to. Whilst the army
without and the garrison of the citadel within renewed their
assaults daily, the Christian warriors remained motionless
in their dwellings. In order to rouse them, Bohemond set
fire to several quarters of the city, destroying, as a pompous
poet said, churches and palaces built with the cedar of
Lebanon, in which shone marble from the Atlas, crystal
from Tyre, brass from Cyprus, lead from Amathonte, and
steel from England. The barons, unable to command the
obedience of their soldiers, had not the strength to set them
an example. And then came the melancholy reflections of
home! They thought of their families, their castles, the
wealth, the comforts they had abandoned to carry on this
unfortunate war; they could not comprehend how such
reverses should happen to them, and that the enemies of
Christ should triumph, and almost, says William of Tyre,
accused God of ingratitude for having rejected so many
sacrifices made to the glory of His Son.

They offered to give up the city, upon being permitted to
return to their country; but Kerbogha would listen to
nothing but unconditional surrender, which implied all the
horrors of barbarous revenge. The European invasion of
Asia was such an extraordinary event, that the Saracens,
perhaps wisely, deemed a severe lesson necessary. If the
Roman Catholics of France were to invade England out of
reverence for St. Thomas of Canterbury, we should not think
such madmen deserving of much mercy.

But some of the leaders, who knew how the minds of
many of the Crusaders had been worked upon to undertake
the enterprise, had recourse in this extreme distress to
similar motives of action: they industriously circulated accounts
of visions and supernatural revelations, all pointing
to a happy issue.

In order to realize the promises of Heaven, a priest of the
diocese of Marseilles, named Pierre BarthÃ©lemi, appeared
before the council of the leaders, for the purpose of revealing
an apparition of St. Andrew, which had been repeated three
times whilst he was asleep. The holy apostle had said to
him,ââGo to the church of my brother Peter, at Antioch:
near the high altar you will find, on digging the earth, the
347

iron of the lance which pierced the side of our Redeemer.
In three days, that instrument of eternal salvation shall be
manifested to His disciples: that mystic iron, borne at
the head of the army, will effect the delivery of the Christians
and pierce the hearts of the infidels.â

Adhemar, Raymond, and the other leaders affected to
believe this tale. The report of it was soon spread throughout
the army. The soldiers said solemnly to each other,
that nothing was impossible to the God of the Christians;
they likewise believed that the glory of Christ was interested
in their safety, and that God ought to perform miracles to
save his disciples and defenders. During three days the
Christian army prepared itself by fasting and prayer for the
discovery of this holy lance.

On the morning of the third day, twelve Crusaders chosen
from amongst the most respectable of the clergy and knights,
repaired to the great church of Antioch, accompanied by a
vast number of labourers provided with the necessary tools.
They began to dig the ground under the high altar; the
greatest silence prevailed in the church; every instant the
spectators expected to behold the glittering of the miraculous
iron. The whole army, assembled outside the closed doors,
awaited impatiently the result of the search. The diggers
had worked during several hours, and had thrown out the
earth to the depth of twelve feet, without the appearance of
any lance. Night came on, and nothing was discovered;
and yet the impatience of the Crusaders seemed to be increased
rather than diminished by disappointment. The
labourers rested for a while, and then in the darkness of
the night resumed their operations. Whilst the twelve
witnesses were bent in prayer round the hole, BarthÃ©lemi
leaped into it, and in a very short time reappeared with the
sacred iron in his hand. Our readers will smile at this poor
trick; but let them glance at the superstitions of the period,
and they will be satisfied that historians have not deceived
them with respect to this lance or its miraculous effects. A
cry of joy was uttered by all present; it was repeated by
the anxious army at the doors, and soon resounded through
every quarter of the city. The iron to which so many hopes
were attached, was exhibited in triumph to the Crusaders; it
appeared to them a celestial weapon with which God himself
348

would disperse His enemies. Enthusiasm gave fresh
life to the Crusaders, and seemed to restore strength to the
soldiers. The horrors of the famine were forgotten; the
numbers of their enemies were despised: the most pusillanimous
thirsted for the blood of the Saracens; and all
demanded with loud cries to be led out to battle.

The leaders of the army who had thus excited the enthusiasm
of the soldiers were too prudent to let it slumber.
They sent deputies to the Saracens to offer them either a
single combat or a general engagement. Peter the Hermit,
who had, in the lance-scene, evinced more exaltation than
any one, was selected for this embassy. Although received
with contempt in the camp of the infidels, he spoke with
none the less haughtiness and pride: âThe princes assembled
in Antioch,â said he to the Saracen leaders, âhave sent me
to you, to demand justice. These provinces, marked with
the blood of martyrs, have belonged to Christian peoples,
and as all Christian peoples are brothers, we are come into
Asia to avenge the outrages of those who are persecuted,
and to defend the heritage of Christ and his disciples.
Heaven has allowed the cities of Syria to fall for a time into
the power of infidels, as a chastisement for the offences of
his people; but learn that the vengeance of the Most High
is at length appeased; learn that the tears and repentance
of the Christians have wrested the sword from the hand of
divine justice, and that the God of armies is risen to combat
for us. Nevertheless, we still consent to speak of peace; I
conjure you, in the name of the all-powerful God, to abandon
the territories of Antioch, and return into your own country.
The Christians promise you, by my voice, not to interrupt
your retreat. We will put up vows that the true God may
touch your hearts, and show you the truth of our faith.
If Heaven deigns to listen to us, how delightful it will be
to us to give you the name of brethren, and to conclude
with you a durable peace! But if you are unwilling to
receive either the advantages of peace or the blessings of
the Christian religion, let the fate of arms decide the justice
of our cause. As the Christians do not wish to be surprised,
and as they are incapable of stealing a victory, they offer
you the choice of the battle.â

On finishing these words, Peter fixed his eyes upon the
349

countenance of the leader of the Saracens: âChoose,â said
he, âthe bravest of thy army, and let them fight with a
similar number of the Crusaders; fight thyself with one of
the Christian princes, or give the signal for a general battle.
Whichever be thy choice, thou shalt soon learn what thy
enemies are, and shalt know who is the God we serve.â

Kerbogha, who was acquainted with the situation of the
Christians, but who knew nothing of the kind of succour
they had received in their distress, was extremely surprised
at such language. He remained for some time mute with
astonishment and rage; but at length recovering himself:
âReturn,â cried he to Peter, âreturn to those that sent
thee, and tell them that the conquered receive conditions,
and do not dictate them. Miserable vagabonds, attenuated
wretches, phantoms can inspire fear in none but women.
The warriors of Asia are not to be terrified with words.
The Christians shall soon learn that the land we tread on
belongs to us. Nevertheless, I am desirous of showing them
some pity, and if they will acknowledge Mahomet, I may be
able to forget that the city, ravaged by hunger, is already in
my power; I may leave it in their power, and give them
clothes, food, womenâall they stand in need of; for the
Koran commands us to pardon those who submit to its laws.
Tell thy companions to be quick, and profit to-day by my
clemency; to-morrow they shall not leave Antioch but by
the sword. They will then see if their crucified God, who
could not save himself from the cross, can save them from
the fate which is prepared for them.â

This speech was warmly applauded by the Saracens, whose
fanaticism it rekindled. Peter wanted to reply, but the
sultan of Mossoul, laying his hand upon his sabre, commanded
the miserable mendicants, who united insolence to
blindness, to be driven out of his camp. The Christian
deputies retired in haste, and several times ran great risk
of their lives in passing through the army of the infidels.
On his return to Antioch, Peter gave the assembled princes
and barons an account of his mission; and they prepared
for the great contest. The heralds-at-arms visited the
various quarters of the city, and the impatient valour of the
Crusaders was promised battle on the ensuing day.

The priests and bishops exhorted the Christians to render
350

themselves worthy of fighting in the cause of Christ: the
whole army passed the night in prayer and acts of devotion.
Injuries were forgiven, alms were bestowed; all the churches
were filled with warriors, humbling themselves before God,
and asking absolution for their sins. The evening before, a
considerable quantity of provisions had been discovered, and
this unexpected abundance was looked upon as a kind of
miracle. The Crusaders repaired their strength by a frugal
repast: towards midnight, all the bread and flour that remained
in Antioch served for the sacrifice of the mass. A
hundred thousand warriors approached the tribunal of penitence,
and received, with all the marks of piety, what they
believed to be the God for whom they had taken up arms.

At length day appeared; it was the festival of St. Peter
and St. Paul. The gates of Antioch were thrown open, and
the Christian army marched out, divided into twelve bodies,
which reminded them of the twelve apostles. Hugh the
Great, although weakened by a long illness, appeared in the
foremost ranks, bearing the standard of the Church. All
the princes, knights, and barons were at the head of their
men-at-arms. The count of Toulouse was the only leader
not in the ranks; detained in Antioch, in consequence of a
wound, he was charged with keeping the garrison in check
whilst the battle was fought.

Raymond of Agiles, one of the historians of the Crusade,
bore the holy lance, and exhibited it to the soldiers. Bishop
Adhemar marched by his side, announcing to the Crusaders
the assistance of the heavenly legions which God had promised
them. A part of the clergy advanced in procession
at the head of the army, singing the martial psalm: âLet
the Lord arise, and let his enemies be dispersed.â The
bishops and priests who remained in Antioch, surrounded
by the women and children, from the heights of the ramparts,
blessed the arms of the Crusaders, and raising their hands
towards heaven, prayed the Lord to save His people, and
confound the pride of his enemies. The banks of the
Orontes and the neighbouring mountains seemed to reply to
these invocations, and resounded with the war-cry of the
Crusaders,
Dieu le veut! Dieu le veut!

Amidst this concert of acclamations and prayers the
Christian army advanced into the plain. To consider only
351

the state to which it was reduced, it had rather the appearance
of a vanquished army than of one which was marching
to victory. A great number of the Crusaders were almost
without clothes. Most of the knights and barons marched
on foot. Some were mounted on asses, and some on
camels; and, which is worthy of note on such a day, Godfrey
Bouillon was obliged to borrow a horse of the count of
Toulouse. In the ranks were sickly attenuated men,
marching with difficulty, and only supported by the hope of
either conquering or dying in the cause of Christ.

All the plains near Antioch were covered with Mussulman
battalions. The Saracens had divided their army into
fifteen bodies, arranged in
Ã©chelons
. In the midst of all
these bodies, that of Kerbogha looked like an inaccessible
mountain. The Saracen general, who had no expectation
of a battle, at first supposed that the Christians were coming
to implore his clemency. A black flag, hoisted on the
citadel of Antioch, which was the signal agreed upon to
announce the resolution of the Crusaders, soon convinced
him that he had not to deal with supplicants. Two thousand
men of his army, who guarded the bridge of Antioch,
were cut to pieces by the count de Vermandois. The fugitives
carried terror to the tent of their general, who was
playing at chess at the time. Roused from his false security,
Kerbogha ordered the head of a deserter, who had announced
to him the speedy surrender of the Christians, to be struck
off, and prepared for battle.

On leaving Antioch, the Christian army advanced westward,
towards the point where the mountains approach the
Orontes. Drawn up in battle-array on a vast space where
the mountains formed a half-circle around them, and secured
them from surprise, their line extended into the plain a
league from the city. Hugh, the two Roberts, the count
de Belesme, and the count of Hainault placed themselves at
the head of the left wing; Godfrey was on the right wing,
supported by Eustache, Baldwin du Bourg, Tancred, Renaud
de Toul, and Erard de Puyset. Adhemar was in the centre,
with Gaston de BÃ©arn, the count de Die, Raimbaut of
Orange, William of Montpellier, and Amenjeu dâAlbret.
Bohemond commanded a body of reserve, ready to fly to any
point where the Christians should require help. When
352

Kerbogha saw the dispositions of the Christians, he ordered
the sultans of Nicea, Damascus, and Aleppo to make the
tour of the mountain, and afterwards reascend the Orontes,
so as to place themselves between the Christian army and
the city of Antioch. He at the same time drew up his
army, to receive the Christians and repulse their attack.
He placed his troops partly on the heights, partly in the
plain. His right wing was commanded by the emir of
Jerusalem, and his left by one of the sons of Accien. For
himself, he remained upon a lofty hill, to give his orders,
and watch the movements of the two armies.

At the moment the battle began, Kerbogha was seized
with fear, and he sent to the Christian princes to propose a
combat between a given number on each side, to prevent
the general carnage. But this offer, which he had rejected
the day before, was not likely to be adopted by the leaders
of an army full of ardour and confident of victory. The
Christians did not doubt that Heaven would declare for
them, and this persuasion must render them invincible. In
their enthusiasm they looked upon the most natural events
as prodigies which announced the triumph of their arms.
A ball of fire, which the evening before had passed over
Antioch, and burst over the Saracen camp, appeared to
them a certain forerunner of victory. As they left Antioch,
a slight rain refreshed the hot air of the season and the
climate, and appeared in their eyes a fresh proof of the
favour of Heaven. A strong wind, which added speed to
their javelins and impeded those of the enemy, was for them
like the wind of celestial anger, raised to disperse the infidels.
Animated by these persuasions, the Christian army was
impatient for the fight. They marched towards the enemy
in perfect order: a profound silence prevailed, broken alone
by the voices of the commanders, the hymns of the priests,
and the exhortations of Adhemar.

All at once the Saracens commenced the attack; they
discharged a shower of arrows, and rushed upon the Christians,
uttering barbarous howlings. In spite of their
impetuous charge, their right wing was quickly repulsed
and broken by the Christians. Godfrey met with greater
resistance in their left wing; he, however, succeeded in
shaking it, and throwing their ranks into disorder. At the
353

moment the troops of Kerbogha began to give way, the
sultan of Nicea, who had made the tour of the mountain
and returned along the banks of the Orontes, fell upon the
rear of the Christians with such impetuosity as to threaten
the destruction of the body of reserve under Bohemond.
The Crusaders, who fought on foot, could not stand against
the first charge of the Saracen cavalry. Hugh the Great,
when warned of the danger of Bohemond, abandoned the
pursuit of the fugitives and flew to the succour of the
reserve. Then the fight was renewed with fresh fury.
Kilidj-Arslan, who had to avenge the disgrace of several
defeats, as well as the loss of his states, fought like a lion
at the head of his troops. A squadron of three thousand
Saracen horsemen, all bristling with steel, and armed with
clubs, carried disorder and terror into the ranks of the
Christians. The standard of the count de Vermandois was
borne off and retaken, covered with the blood of Crusaders
and infidels. Godfrey and Tancred, who flew to the aid of
Hugh and Bohemond, signalized their strength and courage
by the death of many Mussulmans. The sultan of Nicea,
whom no reverse could subdue, still sustained the shock of
the Christians. In the heat of the fight he caused lighted
flax to be cast among the heath and dried grass which
covered the plain. A conflagration quickly ensued, which
encircled the Christians with volumes of fire and smoke.
Their ranks were for a moment broken, and they paid
no attention to the voices of their leaders. The sultan
of Nicea was about to gather the fruit of his stratagem, and
victory was on the point of escaping from the hand of the
Christians.

At that moment, say the historians, a squadron was seen
coming down from the mountains. It was preceded by
three horsemen clothed in white, and covered with shining
arms: âBehold!â shouted Bishop Adhemar, âbehold the
celestial succour that was promised you. Heaven declares
for the Christians; the holy martyrs, George, Demetrius,
and Theodore, are come to fight for us.â Immediately all
eyes were turned towards the celestial legion. A new
ardour took possession of the hearts of the Crusaders, who
were persuaded that God himself was come to their succour;
the war-cry
Dieu le veut
was shouted with as much vigour
354

as at the commencement of the battle. The women and
children animated the warriors by their acclamations from
the battlements; and the priests continued to pray and sing
aloud their hymns and sacred songs of encouragement to
the host.

Every Crusader became a hero; nothing could resist their
impetuous shock. In a moment the Saracens were shaken
everywhere, and only fought in wild disorder. They made
an effort to rally on the other side of a torrent, and again on
an elevated spot, whence their clarions and trumpets
resounded; but the count de Vermandois attacked them in
this last intrenchment, and quickly put them to the rout.
There was shortly no safety for them but in flight. The
banks of the Orontes, the woods, the plains, the mountains,
were covered with fugitives, who abandoned their arms and
their baggage.

Kerbogha, who had prematurely announced the defeat of
the Christians to the caliph of Bagdad and the sultan of
Persia, fled with all speed towards the Euphrates, escorted
by a small number of his most faithful soldiers. Several
emirs had fled before the end of the battle. Tancred and
some others, mounted upon the horses of the conquered,
pursued till nightfall the sultans of Aleppo and Damascus,
the emir of Jerusalem, and the dispersed wreck of the
Saracen army. The conquerors set fire to the intrenchments,
behind which the enemyâs infantry had taken refuge.
A great number of Mussulmans perished there in the
flames.

According to many contemporary historians, the infidels
left a hundred thousand dead on the field of battle. Four
thousand Crusaders lost their lives on this glorious day, and
were placed in the list of martyrs.

The Christians found abundance in the tents of their
enemies; fifteen thousand camels and a vast number of
horses fell into their hands. In the camp of the Saracens,
where they passed the night, they admired at leisure the
luxury of the Orientals, and examined with surprise the
tent of the king of Mossoul, in all parts of which glittered
gold and precious stones, and which, divided into long
streets, flanked by high towers, resembled a fortified city.
They employed several days in carrying into Antioch the
355

spoils of the conquered. The booty was immense, and
every soldier found himself richer than when he left
Europe.

The Saracen army was composed of newly-raised troops,
from nations generally at feud one with another; and of the
twenty-eight emirs who accompanied Kerbogha, scarcely
any two were disposed to act in concert, or acknowledge
the authority of one leader. On the contrary, strange to
say, the most perfect union prevailed on that day among
the Christians.

When the danger was past, the holy lance, which had
given so much confidence to the Crusaders during the battle,
lost all its miraculous influence, and no longer enjoyed their
veneration. As it remained in the hands of the count of
Toulouse and the ProvenÃ§als, to whom it at first attracted
a great number of offerings, the other nations were unwilling
to leave them the advantage of a miracle which augmented
their consideration and wealth. Some time after, when the
Christians had undergone new disasters, the subject of the
holy lance was brought before the army by either sceptics
or rivals, and BarthÃ©lemi was urged on by friends and foes,
as well as by his own vanity, to undergo the ordeal of fire to
prove his truth and the authenticity of the miracle. This
resolution satisfied the army, and all the pilgrims were convoked
to be witnesses of the judgment of Heaven. On the
day fixed, which happened to be Good-Friday, a funeral
pile was constructed of olive-branches in the centre of a vast
plain. Most of the Crusaders were assembled, and everything
was prepared for the redoubtable trial. The flame
had already risen to the height of twenty cubits, when
BarthÃ©lemi appeared, accompanied by the priests, who
advanced in silence, barefoot, and clothed in their sacerdotal
habits. Covered with a simple tunic only, the priest of
Marseilles carried the holy lance, surrounded with floating
streamers. When he had arrived within a few paces of the
pile, one of the principal clergy, in a loud voice, pronounced
these words: âIf this man has seen Jesus Christ face to
face, and if the Apostle Andrew has revealed to him the
holy lance, may he pass safe and sound through the flames;
if, on the contrary, he is guilty of falsehood, may he be
burnt, together with the lance which he bears in his hands.â
356

At these words all present reverently bowed, and responded
as with one voice, âThe will of God be done!â BarthÃ©lemi
threw himself on his knees, called Heaven to witness the truth
of what he said, and recommending himself to the prayers of
the priests and bishops, he rushed through the pile, where
an opening of about two feet wide had been left for his
passage. For a moment all lost sight of him. Several of the
pilgrims began to weep, when he was seen to issue on the
opposite side to that on which he had entered. He was
immediately surrounded and pressed upon by a numberless
crowd, who cried âMiracle,â and contended for the honour
of touching his garment. But BarthÃ©lemi was covered with
mortal wounds; he was carried in a dying state to the tent
of the count of Toulouse, where he expired a few days
after, protesting his innocence and his veracity, He was
buried on the spot where the pile had stood. Raymond de
St. Grilles and the ProvenÃ§als persisted in looking upon him
as an apostle and a martyr; but most of the pilgrims were
satisfied with the
judgment of God
, and the miraculous lance
ceased to work prodigies.

We have taken this account principally from Michaud,
the elegant author of the âHistory of the Crusades,â and
Gibbon; and we do not fear incurring the censure of our
readers for giving it so much in detail, it being, in our
opinion, the most interesting siege in all history.

357

NAPLES.

Mortally
chagrined at not being able to charm Ulysses
to his destruction, the siren Parthenope drowned herself
from pure spite; she was buried on the spot where Naples
now stands, and gave her name to that city, one of the most
beautifully situated in the world. Naples has undergone a
great many sieges,âso many, that of some we shall be able
to give but a very short notice.

FIRST SIEGE, A.D. 536.

Belisarius besieged Naples. That city, admirably situated,
was defended by good ramparts and a numerous garrison.
Its inhabitants had resolved to perish rather than surrender,
and for twenty days all the assaults of the Roman general
were in vain. He was about to abandon the enterprise,
when a happy chance offered him the success he had ceased
to hope for. An Isaurian soldier was curious to see the
structure of an aqueduct which Belisarius had caused to be
cut off at a considerable distance from the city, and there
found a rock pierced with a channel large enough to
allow water to flow through it, but not sufficiently wide
to enable a man to pass. He thought that by enlarging this
channel it would be possible to gain entrance into the city,
and hastened to inform his general of the discovery. Belisarius
secretly charged some Isaurians with the task, which
they performed in a few hours, making a passage for an
armed man. Belisarius, with his usual humanity, anxious
to save life, had an interview with one of the principal
citizens, and in vain endeavoured to persuade him to escape
the cruelty of the soldiery by a surrender. Reduced to
employ force, the Roman general selected that evening a
body of four hundred men, completely armed, and as soon
as it was dark led them, each being provided with a lantern,
towards the aqueduct. They were preceded by two trumpets,
which were to be sounded as soon as they were in the place.
358

Belisarius ordered the ladders to be ready for an escalade
at the same time, all the troops being under arms. When
the detachment had entered the aqueduct, the greater part
of them were seized with a panic, and retraced their steps,
in spite of the efforts of their conductors to urge them on.
Belisarius had them replaced by two hundred of the bravest
men of his army, when the others, ashamed of their
cowardice, followed close upon their heels. The aqueduct,
covered by a brick vault, penetrated far into the city; and
the soldiers, without knowing it, were already beneath the
streets of Naples, when they arrived at the mouth of the
channel, in a basin, whose sides were high and impracticable
to armed men. Their embarrassment was extreme; more
continued coming, and there was not sufficient room for
them in so small a place. One of the soldiers, more active
and bold than the rest, took off his arms, climbed to the top,
and found himself in the miserable ruins of an old building,
inhabited by an old woman: he threatened to kill her if she
opened her mouth. He then threw a cord down, the end
of which he fastened to an olive-tree, and by this species of
ladder the band of soldiers gained the top of the basin two
hours before day. They advanced towards the wall on the
northern side, surprised the guards of two towers, and put
them to the sword. Masters of this part of the wall, they
gave the signal agreed upon with the trumpets, and Belisarius
immediately had the ladders planted. They were
found to be too short; but he ordered two to be tied
together, and by that means reached the parapets. The
Romans spread themselves through the city, where they
met with little resistance. The soldiers gave themselves up
to blind indiscriminate cruelty. Belisarius succeeded at
length in putting a stop to this frightful course, by threatening
some and entreating others. After having abandoned
the booty to them as a recompense for their valour, he
re-established quiet in the city, and caused children to be
restored to their parents, and wives to their husbands.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 543.

Totila laid siege to Naples. To intimidate the garrison,
the king of the Goths caused Demetrius, the Roman general,
359

taken prisoner in a convoy, to be led close to the walls,
loaded with chains and a cord about his neck, and compelled
him to cry aloud to the besieged, that the emperor was not
in a condition to send them any succours. This speech, but
still more the famine which raged in the city, induced the
Neapolitans to surrender.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 818.

Sicon, prince of Beneventum, declared war against the
Neapolitans, and after a long siege, reduced them to the
rank of tributaries.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1253.

Naples had yielded itself up to the Pope, upon which,
the emperor Conrad laid siege to it, and shortly brought it
back to a sense of its duty.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1381.

Pope Urban VI. having excommunicated Joan, the first
queen of Naples, intrusted the execution of the sentence to
Charles de Duras, whom that queen, a few years before, had
declared her legitimate heir. This prince appeared at the
gates of Naples, in which city he had many partisans. A
great number of the inhabitants came over the walls to bring
refreshments to his troops, by whom he learnt that the city
was divided into three factions, the most powerful of which
demanded him for king. Two Neopolitan knights serving
in Charlesâs army, took a novel means of obtaining entrance
to a besieged city. It had always been deemed that the sea
formed a sufficient defence at what was called the Gate Conciara,
and it was neither closed nor guarded. The knights,
under the guidance of some deserters, swam close under the
ramparts and entered the open gate without obstruction. They
then advanced into the market-place, crying aloud, âLong
live Charles Duras and Pope Urban!â Followed by the
populace, they opened the market gate and admitted Charles
and his army. The next day he laid siege to the castle, in
which the queen had taken refuge. Joan, reduced to the
360

last extremity by famine, having no vessel in which to escape,
and no resource but in her husband, Otho of Brunswick,
who was made prisoner by Charles, was obliged to surrender.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.D. 1442.

Alphonso, king of Arragon, the implacable enemy of RenÃ© of
Anjou, who was a kind of titular king of Naples, laid siege to the
capital of that country. This RenÃ© is a character somewhat
associated with our national historical recollections, being the
father of Margaret of Anjou, one of the most remarkable of
our queens. Alphonso was pressing the siege warmly, when
a mason, named Anello, informed him that he was acquainted
with an aqueduct by which it would be possible to penetrate
to a house close to the gate of Capua; and if a number of
soldiers and officers were introduced into that house, they
could easily render themselves masters of that gate. The
king determined to make the attempt, and appointed two
companies of infantry for the service. Anello, stimulated
by the hope of a great reward, placed himself at their head
and conducted them to the
regard
(opening) of the aqueduct,
more than a mile from the city. They proceeded in single
files, with large lanterns, and armed with cross-bows and
partizans. Whilst Alphonso drew nearer to the walls to
watch the event of this expedition, Anello and his troop
followed the aqueduct till it brought them to the house of a
tailor, near the gate of St. Sophia, where they issued by
means of a dry well, to the amount of forty. Not daring to
force the guard, they were compelled to terrify the wife and
daughter of the owner of the house, in order to keep them
quiet. Whilst they were so engaged, the tailor came home,
and, surprised at seeing his house filled with soldiers, he
turned sharply round and ran out, exclaiming, âThe enemies
are in the city!â The forty adventurers then, judging they
could no longer hesitate, attacked the guard of the gate of
St. Sophia; but they met with such resistance, that RenÃ©
had time to come up, when he killed part of them and forced
the rest to retreat. Alphonso, not seeing the signal agreed
upon, imagined that the enterprise had failed, and was returning
to his camp, when he heard the noise of a conflict
carried on in the city, and retraced his steps towards the
361

walls. RenÃ© had reinforced the guard and placed the gate
of St. Sophia in safety; but three hundred Genoese charged
with the defence of that of St. Januarius, abandoned their
post the moment they heard the enemy was in the city.
A gentleman named Marino Spezzicaso, a partisan of the
house of Arragon, threw down several cords from the walls,
by means of which, Pierre de Cardonna, general of the army
of Alphonso, climbed up the walls, and was soon followed by
a great number of his bravest men. Whilst he was traversing
the streets, shouting the war-cry of Arragon, he met an officer
named Brancazzo, going on horseback to join King RenÃ©. He
stopped him, made him prisoner, took from him his horse, and
mounting it, led on a party of Arragonese to attack RenÃ©.
That prince, on beholding him, believed that the enemy
really had possession of the city, and, listening to nothing
but the dictates of his courage, he attacked the advancing
troop and put them to flight. But they soon rallied and
returned to the charge. RenÃ©, obliged to give way to numbers,
opened with his sword a passage for himself to the
New Castle. So the king of Arragon made himself master
of Naples by means of an aqueduct, as Belisarius had done
when he took it from the Goths, ten centuries before. RenÃ©,
being without hope or resources, embarked for Provence,
whilst Alphonso entered Naples in triumph, in imitation of
the ancient Romansâin a chariot drawn by four white
horses. All paid homage to his good fortune and his valour,
and the kingdom of Naples was reunited to that of Sicily,
from which it had been separated a hundred and sixty
years.

SEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1503.

Ferdinand, king of Castille and Arragon, having, in contempt
of treaties of the most solemn kind, invaded the part
of the kingdom of Naples and Sicily that belonged to France,
charged his great captain Gonsalvo with the siege of the
capital of that state. At the approach of the Spaniards, the
French, who placed no confidence in the inhabitants, retreated
to the fortresses of the ChÃ¢teau-neuf and the Åuf.
Gonsalvo attacked the first of these, and it made a vigorous
resistance. The garrison had resolved to bury themselves
under the ruins of the place rather than surrender; and
362

without doubt the Spanish general would have failed in his
enterprise if he had only employed ordinary means. But
he had in his army a soldier called Peter of Navarre, from
the name of his country, who opened the gates and destroyed
the ramparts of the castle by the help of a new species of
thunder, if we may so term it. This soldier, a very intelligent
man, had been, in 1487, with an expedition in which
the Genoese employed, but without success, those terrible
volcanoes called
mines
. He examined the
fourneau
of one
of these mines, and observed that the want of effect in this
invention did not arise from any fault in the art, but from
that of the workmen, who had not taken their dimensions
correctly. He perfected this secret, and communicated it to
Gonsalvo, who begged him to put it to the test. Peter of
Navarre took his measures so well, that his mine had all the
effect he could expect; he then pierced several others, which
succeeded with such precision that the New Castle was
blown up, and all its defenders were either cut to pieces or
buried under the ruins of the walls. The governor
of the castle of the Åuf, a brave gentleman from Auvergne
named Chavagnac, were not discouraged by the melancholy
fate of his compatriots; he was in vain summoned
to surrender: he replied that nothing more glorious
could happen to him than to die for his master, with his
sword in his hand. Peter then commenced some fresh
mines, which were sprung with the same terrible consequences
as the former: the walls crushed the greater part of
the soldiers, and the rest perished in sight of a Genoese
fleet which came to their succour.

EIGHTH SIEGE, A.D. 1557.

The greatest captains have often been reproached with
avoiding engagements. Their firmness in despising the
railleries of the multitude and the scoffing opinions of their
rivals, have in almost all cases placed the seal upon their
reputations. Francis, duke of Guise, at the head of a French
army and some troops furnished by Pope Paul IV., undertook
the conquest of Naples. This general, too skilful not
to be certain that the expedition could not succeed if it were
not begun with some complete advantage, did all in his
363

power to bring the Spaniards to a general action: he offered
them so many favourable opportunities, that their officers
could not pardon their leader, the duke of Alva, for neglecting
them. The duke called a council of war, in which he
said, in an animated yet haughty tone,ââI have always
prayed God, gentlemen, to inspire my soldiers with a determined
firmness and a fiery courage, so that, without fearing
or reasoning, they would rush headlong to meet death, and
expose themselves to any dangers when commanded to do
so. But I ask other qualities of officers: much prudence
and great phlegm, to moderate the impetuosity of the soldiersâthat
is the way by which they attain the rank of
great captains. I will not conceal from you that I have been
displeased with your ardour, because I have thought it immoderate
and opposed to reason. To point out to you the
occasions on which a great general should give battle, I will
tell you it is when his object is to succour a strong place
reduced to extremity, which may form the security of a province;
when he knows that the enemy must receive succours
which will render them his superior, or even his equal; when,
at the beginning of a war, it is desirable to give reputation
to his arms, to strengthen the fidelity of wavering subjects,
retain allies, and prevent covert enemies from declaring
themselves; when fortune not discontinuing to favour us,
our enemies are in such consternation that they dare not
stand before us; and lastly, when, pressed by famine and
disease, and hemmed in on all sides, we must either conquer
or die.

âA great captain will never hazard a considerable action
if he is not sure of drawing great advantages from it, or
unless he is forced into it: tell us what the dangers are
which surround us, or what fruit our country can derive
from the loss of our lives or of our blood? Suppose we are
victorious over the duke of Guise, and the French are cut
to pieces, what shall we be the better for it? Is it that the
cities of the dominions of the Pope will be united to those
of Philip? Is it that the baggage of the French will
enrich us? If, on the contrary, the always uncertain fate
of arms should prove to be against us, what misfortunes
would not our rashness bring upon us? Do not, then, let
us trouble ourselves about conquering Guise; he is flying
364

before us. Could a murderous battle procure us anything
more solid or more glorious? We gain a complete victory,
without shedding a drop of blood. Our name alone serves
as a defence and a rampart to all Italy.

âIf this manner of making war did not appear to me
suited to circumstances, I should remember what I did in
Saxony; I would cross the greatest rivers, I would not
shrink from wetting my feet with the sea: but whilst I find
victory in the retreat of my enemy, I will remain faithful to
my maxims, and will endeavour to combat your audacity
and rashness. In a word, I will not risk a kingdom against
a cassock of cloth of gold, which is all Guise can lose.â

The conjectures of the Spanish general were all verified.
The French expedition had the most fatal issue.

It may be said that this speech contains the history of
no siege; but Fabius Maximus was no less admirable than
Scipio; and he who consumes his enemy in vain enterprises,
is not a less able general than he who annihilates him in a
battle. Military men will find more instruction in the
motives which determined the duke of Alva not to risk a
battle, than they would by the description of a siege.

Since the commencement of the French revolution,
Naples has been the scene of several important political
events, and has more than once succumbed to the power of
the French; but as there has been no regular siege, these
do not come within the scope of our plan.

365

EDESSA.

A.D. 503.

The
inhabitants of Edessa have, or rather had, a legend
that Christ promised their king Abgarus that their city
should never be taken. This gave them such confidence,
that they on all occasions braved the most formidable
enemies. In 503 of the Christian era, Cavadez, king of
Persia, approached Edessa at the head of an army. The
confidence of the inhabitants was so little shaken by the
appearance of this formidable host, that they left their
gates wide open during a whole day, and, such is the
influence of superstition, the Persians did not make the
least attempt to violate the prohibition. It is related that,
on this occasion, children even went to the camp of the
Persians, and insulted them with impunity. Cavadez
proposed an accommodation; but without effect. This
prince was preparing his batteries, when the inhabitants
made so furious an assault upon him, that, without losing a
single man, they repulsed his army with great slaughter.
Ashamed of his defeat, the great king regained his dominions
at quickest speed.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 544.

ChosroÃ«s, son of the above king, presented himself before
Edessa, but without any better success. Upon the point of
abandoning his enterprise, he made it known, by a herald,
that he meant to sell all the prisoners he had taken at
Antioch. The whole city of Edessa, animated by the zealous
and active charity which religion inspires, was in a state of
eager impatience to redeem these unhappy victims of war.
Every one wished to contribute in proportion to, or even
beyond their fortune, to this pious purpose. Each person
carried his offering to the great church, which was speedily
366

filled with treasures of various kinds. Courtesans from
their vices, honest peasants from their labours, if they had
but a goat or a sheep, contributed cheerfully to the liberation
of their fellow Christians. This generous emulation produced
a sufficient ransom for all the prisoners. But, as is
too often the case, this wealth, collected for holy purposes,
became so great as to attract the cupidity of Buzes, who
commanded the city for the emperor Justinian: when it
was collected, he appropriated the whole to himself, and
ChosroÃ«s took his prisoners to a better market.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 549.

Four years after, this prince again laid siege to Edessa,
and attacked it vigorously. But the besieged made a sortie,
in which, it is said, an officer named Arget killed, with his
own hand, twenty-seven of the enemy, and in which
ChosroÃ«s was repulsed. He then commenced, out of reach
of the city missiles, a platform, with the purpose of carrying
it up to the walls. The sight of this terrible work induced
the inhabitants to have recourse to prayer. The physician
Stephen endeavoured to bend the haughty monarch: âGreat
lord,â said he, âhumanity marks the character of good
kings. Victories and conquests will procure you other
titles, but kindnesses alone will secure you the name dearest
to your own age, and most honourable in the eyes of posterity.
If there is a city in the world which ought to
experience the effects of that kindness, it is that which you
now threaten to destroy. Edessa gave me birth. I restored
life to your father; I preserved and watched over your
infancy. Alas! when I advised the immortal Cavadez to
place you on his throne, and to deprive your brothers of it,
I was then preparing the ruin of my own country! Blind
mortals, we are often the artisans of our own misfortunes!
If you remember my services, I ask of you a recompense
which will be not less advantageous to you than to my compatriots.
By leaving them their lives, you spare yourself
the reproach of cruelty.â This well-timed and pathetic
discourse produced very little effect upon ChosroÃ«s; he
made such hard propositions, that the besieged fell back
upon their courage and their resources. They destroyed
367

the point of the terrace, by digging a chamber under it, and
filling it with the most combustible wood, steeped in oil of
cedar, sulphur, and bitumen; fire was easily set to this,
and the following night, columns of fire were seen bursting
from different parts of the platform. At the same time,
the Romans, the better to deceive the enemy, threw upon it
a number of fire-pots and ignited torches. The Persians,
not suspecting there was any other cause for the fire, came
in crowds from their camp to extinguish it, and were
received with showers of missiles from the walls. ChosroÃ«s
himself came to the scene of action, and was the first to
discover that the conflagration was in the entrails of his
platform. He ordered the whole army to throw earth upon
the top, to stifle the flames, and water to extinguish them;
but all in vain: when vent was stopped at one place, a
hundred more passages were opened in others, the water
thrown upon the sulphur and bitumen augmenting the
violence of the burning. In the midst of the confusion,
the garrison made a happy and vigorous sortie, producing
great slaughter among the Persians. At length the flames
burst from all parts, and the work was abandoned.

Six days after, ChosroÃ«s ordered the walls to be scaled,
early in the morning; but, after a severe contest, the Persians
were repulsed, and obliged to abandon their ladders, which
were drawn up over the walls by the besieged, amidst triumphant
laughter. On the same day at noon, the Persians
attacked one of the gates; but the garrison, the peasants
who had retired to the city, with the inhabitants, made a
sortie from the gate attacked, and again repulsed their
enemies. At length, the king of Persia, enraged at this
noble resistance, resolved upon a general assault. The
citizens crowded to defend their walls; every human being
in Edessa became a soldier; women, children, and old men,
were all eager to share the labours of the combatants, or to
furnish them with arms and refreshments. The Persians
gave way; ChosroÃ«s forced them back to the walls with
threats and blows; but, notwithstanding his efforts, they
yielded to the brave efforts of the besieged. Foaming with
vexation and rage, ChosroÃ«s regained his camp, and soon after
returned to his own states. During this furious attack, an
immense elephant, bearing upon his back a lofty tower,
368

filled with archers, advanced towards the wall like a terrible
machine, from the top of which poured a continuous shower
of darts and arrows. There was great chance of the wall
being escaladed at this spot, when a Roman soldier took it
into his head to suspend a pig by a cord, and dangle it before
the elephant. This animal appeared amazed at the horrible
noise made by the suspended pig; he at first looked at it
earnestly, and then, turning his back, retreated in such haste
as to place his masterâs troops in danger.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1097.

Although the means by which Edessa fell into the hands
of one of the Crusaders may not be, correctly speaking, a
siege, the circumstances are too interesting to be passed by
in silence.

Of all the Crusaders, Baldwin, the brother of Godfrey,
was one of the bravest, but at the same time the most
intractable. In fact, he had the honesty to confess what
many of his comrades really felt, but were ashamed to admit;
he came into Asia to make his fortune, and he lost no
opportunity for effecting that great purpose.

Seduced by the attractive picture drawn of the provinces
upon the banks of the Euphrates, by Pancratius, an ambitious,
restless Armenian prince, Baldwin, soon after the
siege of Nicea, abandoned the main army of the Crusaders,
and may literally be said to
have gone to seek his fortune
at
the head of fifteen hundred foot and two hundred horse, all
attracted by the hopes of plunder. He was the more free
for this undertaking, from having just lost his wife Gundechilde,
who had accompanied him to the Crusade. He
witnessed the magnificent obsequies bestowed upon her by
his fellow-adventurers, and then departed, unregretted, on
his expedition.

The cities of Turbessel and Ravendel were the first places
that opened their gates to the fortunate adventurer. These
conquests soon produced a division between Baldwin and
Pancratius, both being actuated by the same ambitious projects;
but this quarrel did not stop the march of the brother
of Godfrey a moment. The Crusader opposed open unhesitating
force to cunning; he told Pancratius, if he presumed
369

to be his rival, he should at once treat him as an enemy;
and thus banished the disappointed Armenian from the
theatre of his victories. Baldwin stood in need of neither
guide nor help in a country whose inhabitants all came out
to hail and meet him. His fame preceded his march; and
his exploits were canvassed in Edessa long before he drew
near to its walls.

This city, the metropolis of Mesopotamia, and so celebrated
in the history of the primitive church, having escaped
the invasions of the Turks and Persians, became the place
of refuge for all the neighbouring Christians, who brought
their wealth thither for security. A Greek prince, of the
name of Theodore, sent by the emperor of Constantinople,
was governor at the time, and maintained his position by
paying tribute to the Saracens. The approach and the
victories of the Crusaders produced a great sensation in
Edessa. The people united with the governor in calling
Baldwin to their aid. The bishop and twelve of the principal
inhabitants were deputed to meet the European adventurer.
They spoke to him of the wealth of Mesopotamia, of the
devotion of their fellow-citizens to the cause of Christ, and
conjured him to save a Christian city from the domination
of the infidels. Baldwin easily yielded to their entreaties,
and set forward on his march to cross the Euphrates.

He had the good fortune to escape the Turks, who laid
wait for him, and without drawing a sword, arrived safely in
the territories of Edessa. Having left garrisons in the places
which had surrendered to him, when he came near to this
great object of his ambition, he had really with him no more
than a body of a hundred horsemen. As he approached the
city, the whole population came out to meet him, bearing
olive-branches, and singing triumphant hymns. It was a
singular spectacle to behold such a small number of warriors
surrounded by an immense multitude, imploring their support,
and proclaiming them their liberators. They were
received with so much enthusiasm, that the prince or
governor took umbrage at it, and began to see in them
enemies much more dangerous than the Saracens. To attach
their leader to himself, and to engage him to support his
authority, he offered him vast wealth. But the ambitious
Baldwin, whether he expected to obtain more from the
370

affection of the people and the good fortune of his arms, or
whether he considered it disgraceful to be in the pay of a
petty foreign prince, refused the governorâs offers with contempt;
he even threatened to leave the city to its fate. The
inhabitants, to prevent his departure, assembled in a tumultuous
manner, and conjured him with loud cries to remain
amongst them; the governor himself made fresh efforts to
detain the Crusaders and interest them in their cause.
Baldwin gave them all clearly to understand that he would
never be at the trouble of defending states that were not his
own; and the prince of Edessa, who was old and childless,
determined to adopt him as his son, and to designate him as
his successor. The ceremony of adoption was gone through
in the presence of the Crusaders and the inhabitants.
According to the custom of the East, the Greek prince
caused Baldwin to pass between his shirt and his naked
flesh, giving him a kiss, in token of alliance and parentage.
The old wife of the governor repeated the same ceremony,
and from that time Baldwin, considered as their son and
heir, neglected nothing for the defence of a city which was
to belong to him.

An Armenian prince coming to the aid of Edessa, Baldwin,
seconded by this useful auxiliary, with his own horsemen
and Theodoreâs troops, thought himself in a condition
to take the field against the Turks. He was at first successful,
but, whilst his men were engaged in plunder, they
were attacked, and obliged to return to Edessa, where their
appearance spread consternation.

As a loser is never welcome, Baldwin and Theodore began
now to quarrel. But the people were all in favour of the
new prince, and after several disgraceful plots and tumults,
the Edessans hurled their old governor from the battlements,
dragged his bleeding body through the streets, rejoicing over
the murder of an old man as if they had gained a victory
over the infidels.

Although Baldwin affected to be passive in this horrid
business, he did not fail to seize the advantages that accrued
to him in consequence of it. He was proclaimed master
and liberator of Edessa. Seated on a bloody throne, and
dreading the inconstant humour of the people, he soon
inspired as much fear among his subjects as among his
371

enemies. But his firmness of character overcame domestic
seditions, and his prudence, tact, and valour speedily extended
his dominions. He purchased the city of Samoata
with the treasures of his predecessor, and took several other
cities by force of arms. As fortune favoured him in everything,
the loss even of his wife assisted his projects of aggrandizement.
He married the niece of an Armenian prince,
and, by this alliance, extended his possessions to Mount
Taurus. All Mesopotamia, with the two shores of the
Euphrates, acknowledged his authority, and Asia beheld a
Frank knight reigning without obstacle over the richest
provinces of the ancient kingdom of Assyria.

KAIBAR.

A.D. 682.

Remarkable
characters give consequence to insignificant
places; Richard CÅur de Lion, who had filled two continents
with his fame, was killed at the siege of a paltry
castle, and the name of Chaluze is preserved in history.
But Kaibar, a city of Arabia, is associated with, and saved from
oblivion by, the name of even a greater man than Richard.

The Jews spread throughout Arabia attempted to cross
the ambitious projects of Mahomet. They took up arms,
and shut themselves up in the strongly fortified city of
Kaibar. Although he had beaten them several times,
Mahomet knew that he must not lose his
prestige
, and at
once marched to attack them. Kaibar was carried, but the
conquest proved fatal to the conqueror. He lodged at the
house of one of the principal inhabitants, whose daughter,
named Zainab, gave him for supper a poisoned shoulder of
mutton. Mahomet vomited the meat; but such was the
activity of the poison that from that moment he became a
valetudinarian: he died from the effects of the poison three
years after. When questioned as to what could lead her to
the commission of such a crime, Zainab coolly replied,
372

â
I wished to know if Mahomet were really a prophet.
â Notwithstanding
such a death would discredit the holiness of
his mission, the followers of Mahomet do not deny this
poisoning.

CONSTANTINOPLE.

A.D. 559.

The
majesty of the Roman people no longer commanded
the respect of the universe, the valour of its legions no
longer spread terror among the barbarians, in the time of
Justinian. A king of the Huns, named Zabergan, ventured
to advance, in 559, to the very walls of Constantinople, and
to threaten the imperial city with pillage. There was but
a feeble garrison within its ramparts, but in the moment of
terror it was remembered that they possessed Belisarius.
That great man was instantly dragged from the obscurity in
which he languished. Called upon to drive from the walls
of the capital the dangers by which it was surrounded, he
resumed his genius, his activity, and his valour; no one could
perceive that years had cooled his ardour. His first care
was to surround his camp with a wide ditch, to protect it
from the insults of the Huns, and to deceive them with
regard to the number of his troops by lighting fires in all
parts of the plain. There was only one passage by which
the Huns could reach Constantinople, and that was through
a hollow way, bordered on each side by a thick forest.
Belisarius began by lining the two sides of this defile with
two hundred archers; he then advanced at the head of three
hundred soldiers, trained to conquer under his orders. He was
followed by the rest of his troops, who were ordered to utter
loud cries, and to drag along the ground large branches of
trees, so as to raise vast clouds of dust round them. Everything
succeeded; the barbarians, charged in flank, blinded
by the dust which the wind blew in their eyes, terrified by
the cries of the Romans, and the noise of their arms, and
373

attacked in front with vigour by Belisarius and his chosen
band, took to flight without striking a blow. This horde of
barbarians hastily departed, to carry the evils of plunder,
fire, and death elsewhere.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 670.

Whilst Heraclius was absent, combating the Persians, the
khan of the Abares appeared before Constantinople. For
once the inhabitants of that magnificent city evinced bravery,
and rendered the efforts of the khan useless. He regained
his deserts, after having witnessed the destruction of the
greater part of his troops.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 672.

Tezid, son of the caliph Moavias, proved no less unfortunate
in his expedition against Constantinople. His naval
force was entirely destroyed, and that loss compelled him to
raise the siege. Among the Mussulmans who signalized
their courage in this expedition, was the captain Aboux
Aioub, one of the companions of Mahomet in the battles of
Bedra and Ohod. He was buried at the foot of the walls of
the city. His tomb is the place at which the Ottoman
emperors are girded with the sword.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1203.

The great siege of Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders
is one of the most tempting subjects to dilate upon that
history affords. After casting a retrospective glance at this
city, or rather this empire, for, as Paris is said to be France,
so was Constantinople the empire of the East; and contemplating
its glories and disasters, from its foundation upon
Byzantium, by Constantine, to its capture by Mahomet II.,
of all the events connected with it, its siege and plunder by
a handful of Christian knights is one of the most extraordinary
and interesting. But to relate all the particulars
of this siege would require a volume, and we, alas! can only
afford a few pages to it. In this predicament we turn from
Michaud, who tells the tale admirably, to the quite as elegant
374

but more brief account of Gibbon, to whose words, or
nearly so, we shall confine ourselves.

Europe had taken up the cross for the fifth time: the
forces destined to act against the infidels were upon the
point of embarking for the Holy Land, when young Alexius,
son of Isaac Angelus, the emperor of Constantinople, came
to implore the succour of the Christian princes in favour of
his father. An ambitious brother had dethroned him, deprived
him of sight, and then confined him in a loathsome
prison. Touched by his prayers, but
still more by the advantages
he offered
, the Crusaders set sail for Constantinople.
Although this Crusade was got up by a pope, and professed
to be for the relief of Jerusalem, it was more honest in the
public exposition of its views than any other. After studying
the history of these most amazing expeditions deeply, we
are come to a conviction that real religion had but a very
small share in them: they were something like the voyages
of the Spanish adventurers to Columbusâs newly-discovered
world; the latter, likewise, went under the auspices of a
pope, and always hoisted the standard of the cross upon
taking possession of a previously unknown land, and to
which they had no earthly claim:âthe Crusades were capital
means for keeping up the influence of the popes, and the
fanatics they disseminated through society; but with the
princes, barons, and knights, they were nothing but expeditions
in search of fortune. That we may include safely
the great military orders in this, is proved by the wealth
they amassed.

But this fifth Crusade was an adventure commenced by
needy and ambitious men, into which the Venetians entered
with all the astuteness of usurious money-lenders. Every one
feels an interest in fine old Dandolo, but even his chivalric
character suffers by the recollection constantly present to
the mind, of the motives which brought his noble qualities
into action. This Crusade is one of the most instructive
passages of history. The real objects of the Crusaders being
made apparent by their conduct when success was obtained,
we need not hesitate to say that it was framed with a view
to wrong; being carried out by men of courage and ability,
it succeeded even beyond their hopes: but what was the
consequence? There was no principle of good in it; and
375

that which had begun so grandly came to a most âlame and
impotent conclusion.â It proved one of the shortest-lived
great revolutions in the annals of mankind.

âIn relating the invasion of a great empire, it may seem
strange that I have not described the obstacles which should
have checked the progress of the strangers. The Greeks,
in truth, were an unwarlike people; but they were rich,
industrious, and subject to the will of a single man,âhad
that man been capable of fear when his enemies were at a
distance, or of courage when they approached his person.
The first rumours of his nephewâs alliance with the French
and Venetians were despised by the usurper; his flatterers
persuaded him that in this contempt he was bold and sincere,
and each evening, on the close of the banquet, he thrice
discomfited the barbarians of the West. These barbarians
had been justly terrified by the report of his naval power;
and the sixteen hundred fishing-boats of Constantinople
could have manned a fleet to sink them in the Adriatic, or
stop their entrance in the mouth of the Hellespont. But all
force may be annihilated by the negligence of a prince or
the venality of his ministers. The great duke, or admiral,
made a scandalous, almost a public, auction of the sails, the
masts, and the rigging; the royal forests were reserved for
the more important purposes of the chase; and the trees,
says Nicetas, were guarded by the eunuchs, like the groves
of religious worship. From his dream of pride Alexius was
awakened by the siege of Zara, and the rapid advances of
the Latins; as soon as he saw the danger was real, he
thought it inevitable, and his vain presumption was lost in
abject despondency and despair. He suffered these contemptible
barbarians to pitch their tents within sight of his
palace, and his apprehensions were thinly disguised by the
pomp and menace of a suppliant embassy. The sovereign
of the Romans was astonished (his ambassadors were instructed
to say) at the hostile appearance of the strangers.
If these pilgrims were sincere in their views for the deliverance
of Jerusalem, his voice must applaud and his treasures
should assist their pious design; but should they dare to
invade the sanctuary of empire, their numbers, were they
ten times more considerable, should not protect them from
his just resentment. The answer of the doge and barons
376

was simple and magnanimous. âIn the cause of honour
and justice,â they said, âwe despise the usurper of Greece,
his threats, and his offers.
Our
friendship and
his
allegiance
are due to the lawful heir, to the young prince who is seated
among us, and to his father, the emperor Isaac, who has
been deprived of his sceptre, his freedom, and his eyes, by
the crime of an ungrateful brother. Let that brother confess
his guilt and implore forgiveness, and we ourselves will
intercede, that he may be permitted to live in affluence and
security. But let him not insult us by a second message: our
reply will be made in arms, in the palace of Constantinople.â

âOn the tenth day of their encampment at Scutari, the
Crusaders prepared themselves as soldiers and as Catholics
for the passage of the Bosphorus. Perilous indeed was the
adventure: the stream was broad and rapid; in a calm, the
current of the Euxine might drive down the liquid and
unextinguishable fire of the Greeks; and the opposite shores
of Europe were defended by seventy thousand horse and
foot in formidable array. On this memorable day, which
happened to be bright and pleasant, the Latins were distributed
in six battles or divisions: the first, or vanguard, was
led by the count of Flanders, one of the most powerful of
the Christian princes in the skill and numbers of his cross-bows.
The four successive battles of the French were commanded
by his brother Henry, the counts of St. Pol and
Blois, and Matthew of Montmorency, the last of whom was
honoured by the voluntary service of the marshal and nobles
of Champagne. The sixth division, the rear-guard and
reserve of the army, was conducted by the marquis of
Montferrat, at the head of the Germans and Lombards.
The chargers, saddled, with their long caparisons dragging
on the ground, were embarked in the flat
palanders
, and the
knights stood by the side of their horses in complete armour,
their helmets laced and their lances in their hands. Their
numerous train of serjeants and archers occupied the transports,
and each transport was towed by the strength and
swiftness of a galley. The six divisions traversed the Bosphorus
without encountering an enemy or an obstacle; to
land the foremost, was the wish; to conquer or die, was the
resolution of every division and of every soldier. Jealous of
the pre-eminence of danger, the knights in their heavy
377

armour leaped into the sea when it rose as high as their
girdle; the serjeants and archers were animated by their
valour; and the squires, letting down the drawbridges of
the
palanders
, led the horses to the shore. Before the
squadrons could mount and form and couch their lances, the
seventy thousand Greeks had vanished from their sight; the
timid Alexius gave the example to his troops; and it was
only by the plunder of the rich pavilions that the Latins
were informed they fought against an emperor. In the first
consternation of the flying enemy, they resolved by a double
attack to open the entrance of the harbour. The tower of
Galata, in the suburb of Pera, was attacked and stormed by
the French, while the Venetians assumed the more difficult
task of forcing the boom, or chain, that was stretched from
that tower to the Byzantine shore. After some fruitless
attempts, their intrepid perseverance prevailed; twenty ships
of war, the relics of the Grecian navy, were either sunk or
taken; the enormous and massy links of iron were cut
asunder by the shears or broken by the weight of the galleys;
and the Venetian fleet, safe and triumphant, rode at anchor
in the port of Constantinople. By these daring achievements,
a remnant of twenty thousand Latins preluded the
astounding attempt of besieging a capital containing above
four hundred thousand inhabitants, able, though not willing,
to bear arms in defence of their country. Such an account
would, indeed, suppose a population of near two millions;
but whatever abatement may be required in the numbers of
the Greeks, the
belief
of these numbers will equally exalt
the fearless spirit of their assailants.

âIn the choice of attack, the French and Venetians were
divided by their habits of life and warfare. The latter
affirmed with truth, that Constantinople was most accessible
on the side of the sea and the harbour; the former might
assert with honour, that they had long enough trusted their
lives and fortunes to a frail bark and a precarious element,
and loudly demanded a trial of knighthood, a firm ground,
and a close onset, either on foot or horseback. After a prudent
compromise of employing the two nations by sea and
land in the service best suited to their character, the fleet
covering the army, they both proceeded from the entrance to
the extremity of the harbour. The stone bridge of the river
378

was hastily repaired; and the six battles of the French
formed their encampment against the front of the capital,
the basis of the triangle which runs about four miles from
the port to the Propontis. On the edge of a broad ditch at
the foot of a lofty rampart, they had leisure to contemplate
the difficulties of their enterprise. The gates to the right
and left of their narrow camp poured forth frequent sallies
of cavalry and light infantry, which cut off their stragglers,
swept the country of provisions, sounded the alarm five or
six times in the course of each day, and compelled them to
plant a palisade and sink an intrenchment for their immediate
safety. In the supplies and convoys, the Venetians
had been too sparing, or the Franks too voracious; the usual
complaints of hunger and scarcity were heard, and perhaps felt;
their stock of flour would be exhausted in three weeks; and
their disgust of salt meat tempted them to taste the flesh of
their horses. The trembling usurper was supported by Theodore
Lascaris, his son-in-law, a valiant youth, who aspired to
save and rule his country. The Greeks, regardless of that
country, were awakened to the defence of their religion;
but their firmest hope was in the strength and spirit of
the Varangian guards of Danes and English, as they are
named by the writers of the times. After ten daysâ incessant
labour, the ground was levelled, the ditch filled, the
approaches of the besiegers were regularly made, and two
hundred and fifty engines of assault exercised their various
powers to clear the ramparts, to batter the walls, and to sap
the foundations. On the first appearance of a breach, the
scaling-ladders were applied; the numbers that defended the
vantage-ground repulsed and oppressed the venturous
Latins; but they admired the resolution of fifteen knights
and serjeants, who, having gained the ascent, maintained
their position till they were hurled down or made prisoners
by the imperial guards. On the side of the harbour, the
naval attack was more successfully conducted by the Venetians;
and that industrious people employed every resource
that was known and practised before the invention of
gunpowder. A double line, three bowshots in front, was
formed by the galleys and ships; and the swift motion of
the former was supported by the weight and loftiness of the
latter, whose decks, and poops, and turrets were the platforms
379

of military engines, that discharged their shot over
the heads of the first line. The soldiers who leaped from
the galleys on shore, immediately planted and ascended their
scaling-ladders, while the large ships, advancing more slowly
into the intervals and lowering a drawbridge, opened a way
through the air from their masts to the rampart. In the
midst of the conflict, the doge, a venerable and conspicuous
form, stood aloft in complete armour, on the prow of his
galley. The great standard of St. Mark was displayed
before him; his threats, promises, and exhortations urged
the diligence of the rowers; his vessel was the first that
struck, and Dandolo was the first warrior on the shore. The
nations admired the magnanimity of the blind old man, without
reflecting that his age and infirmities diminished the
price of life and enhanced the value of immortal glory. On
a sudden, by an invisible hand (for the standard-bearer was
probably slain), the banner of the republic was fixed on the
rampart; twenty-five towers were rapidly occupied; and, by
the cruel expedient of fire, the Greeks were driven from the
adjacent quarter. The doge had despatched the intelligence
of his success, when he was checked by the danger of his
confederates. Nobly declaring that he would rather die
with the pilgrims than gain a victory by their destruction,
Dandolo relinquished his advantage, recalled his troops, and
hastened to the scene of action. He found the six weary

battles
of the Franks encompassed by sixty squadrons of the
Greek cavalry, the least of which was more numerous than
the largest of their divisions. Shame and despair had provoked
Alexius to the last effort of a general sally; but he
was awed by the firm order and manly aspect of the Latins;
and after skirmishing at a distance, withdrew his troops in
the close of the evening. The silence or tumult of the night
exasperated his fears; and the timid usurper, collecting a
treasure of ten thousand pounds of gold, basely deserted his
wife, his people, and his fortune; threw himself into a bark,
stole through the Bosphorus, and landed in shameful safety
in an obscure harbour of Thrace. As soon as they were apprised
of his flight, the Greek nobles sought pardon and
peace in the dungeon where the blind Isaac expected each
hour the visit of the executioner. Again saved and exalted
by the vicissitudes of fortune, the captive, in his imperial
380

robes, was replaced on the throne and surrounded with
prostrate slaves, whose real terror and affected joy he was
incapable of discerning. At the dawn of day, hostilities
were suspended; and the Latin chiefs were surprised by a
message from the lawful and reigning emperor, who was impatient
to embrace his son and reward his generous deliverers.

âBut these generous deliverers were unwilling to release
their hostage till they had obtained from his father the payment,
or, at least, the promise of their recompense. They
chose four ambassadors,âMontmorency, our historian Villehardouin,
and two Venetians, to congratulate the emperor.
The gates were thrown open on their approach, the streets
on both sides were lined with the battle-axes of the Danish
and English guard; the presence-chamber glittered with
gold and jewelsâthe false substitutes of virtue and power.
By the side of the blind Isaac was seated his wife, the sister
of the king of Hungary; and by her appearance, the noble
matrons of Greece were drawn from their domestic retirement,
and mingled with the circle of senators and soldiers.
The Latins, by the mouth of Villehardouin, spoke like men
conscious of their merits, but who respected the work of
their own hands; and the emperor clearly understood that
his sonâs engagements with Venice and the pilgrims must be
ratified without hesitation or delay. Withdrawing into a
private chamber with the empress, a chamberlain, an interpreter,
and the four ambassadors, the father of young Alexius
inquired with some anxiety into the nature of his stipulations.
The submission of the Eastern empire to the pope;
the succour of the Holy Land; and a present contribution
of two hundred thousand marks of silver. âThese conditions
are weighty,â was his prudent reply: âthey are
hard to accept and difficult to perform. But no conditions
can exceed the measure of your services and deserts.â
After this satisfactory assurance, the barons mounted on
horseback and introduced the heir of Constantinople to the
city and palace. His youth and marvellous adventures engaged
every heart in his favour; and Alexius was solemnly
crowned with his father in the dome of St. Sophia. In the
first days of his reign, the people, already blessed with the
restoration of plenty and peace, were delighted by the joyful
catastrophe of the tragedy; and the discontent of the nobles,
381

their regrets and their fears, were covered by the polished
surface of pleasure and loyalty. The mixture of two discordant
nations in the same capital might have been pregnant
with mischief and danger; and the suburb of Galata,
or Pera, was assigned for the quarters of the Franks and the
Venetians. But the liberty of trade and familiar intercourse
was allowed between the friendly nations; and each day the
pilgrims were tempted by devotion or curiosity to visit the
churches and palaces of Constantinople. Their rude minds,
insensible perhaps of the finer arts, were astonished by the
magnificent scenery; and the poverty of their native towns
enhanced the populousness and riches of the first metropolis
of Christendom. Descending from his state, young Alexius
was prompted by interest and gratitude to repeat his frequent
and familiar visits to his Latin allies; and in the
freedom of the table, the gay petulance of the French sometimes
forgot the emperor of the East. In their most serious
conferences, it was agreed that the reunion of the two
churches must be the result of patience and time; but
avarice was less tractable than zeal; and a large sum was
instantly disbursed to appease the wants and silence the
importunity of the Crusaders. Alexius was alarmed by the
approaching hour of their departure; their absence might
have relieved him from the engagement he was yet incapable
of performing; but his friends would have left him naked
and alone, to the caprice and prejudice of a perfidious nation.
He wished to bribe their stay, the delay of a year, by undertaking
to defray their expense, and to satisfy in their name
the freight of the Venetian vessels. The offer was agitated
in the council of the barons, and after a repetition of their
debates and scruples, a majority of votes again acquiesced in
the advice of the doge and the prayer of the young emperor.
At the price of sixteen hundred pounds of gold, he prevailed
on the marquis of Montferrat to lead him with an army
round the provinces of Europe, to establish his authority and
pursue his uncle, while Constantinople was awed by the presence
of Baldwin and his confederates of France and Flanders.
The expedition was successful; the blind emperor exulted in
the success of his arms, and listened to the predictions of
his flatterers that the same Providence which had raised him
from the dungeon to the throne would heal his gout, restore
382

his sight, and watch over the long prosperity of his reign.
Yet the mind of the suspicious old man was tormented by
the rising glories of his son; nor could his pride conceal
from his envy, that whilst his own name was pronounced in
faint and reluctant acclamations, the royal youth was the
theme of spontaneous and universal praise.

âBy the recent invasion the Greeks were awakened from
a dream of nine centuries, from the vain presumption that
the capital of the Roman empire was impregnable to
foreign arms. The strangers of the West had violated the
city, and bestowed the sceptre of Constantine; their imperial
clients soon became as unpopular as themselves; the
well-known vices of Isaac were rendered still more contemptible
by his infirmities, and the young Alexius was hated as
an apostate, who had renounced the manners and religion of
his country. His secret covenant with the Latins was
divulged or suspected; the people, and especially the clergy,
were devoutly attached to their faith and superstition; and
every convent and every shop resounded with the danger of
the Church and the tyranny of the Pope. An empty treasury
could ill supply the demands of regal luxury and
foreign extortion; the Greeks refused to avert, by a general
tax, the impending evils of servitude and pillage; the
oppression of the rich excited a more dangerous and personal
resentment; and if the emperor melted the plate, and
despoiled the images of the sanctuary, he seemed to justify
the complaints of heresy and sacrilege. During the absence
of Marquis Boniface and his imperial pupil, Constantinople
was visited with a calamity which might be justly imputed
to the zeal and indiscretion of the Flemish pilgrims. In
one of their visits to the city, they were scandalized by the
aspect of a mosch, or synagogue, in which one God was worshipped
without a partner or a son. Their effectual mode
of controversy was to attack the infidels with the sword, and
their habitations with fire; but the infidels, and some
Christian neighbours, presumed to defend their lives and
properties; and the flames which bigotry had kindled consumed
the most orthodox and innocent structures. During
eight days and nights the conflagration spread above a
league in front, from the harbour to the Propontis, over the
thickest and most populous regions of the city. It is not
383

easy to count the stately palaces and churches that were
reduced to a smoking ruin, to value the merchandise that
perished in the trading streets, or to number the families
that were involved in the common destruction. By this
outrage, which the doge and barons in vain affected to disclaim,
the name of the Latins became still more unpopular,
and the colony of that nation, above fifteen thousand persons,
consulted their safety in a hasty retreat from the city
to the protection of their standard in the suburb of Pera.
The emperor returned in triumph; but the firmest and most
dexterous policy would have been insufficient to steer him
through the tempest which overwhelmed the person and
government of that unhappy youth. His own inclinations
and his fatherâs advice attached him to his benefactors; but
Alexius hesitated between gratitude and patriotism, between
the fear of his subjects and of his allies. By his feeble and
fluctuating conduct he lost the esteem and confidence of
both; and while he invited the marquis of Montferrat to
occupy the palace, he suffered the nobles to conspire and the
people to arm for the deliverance of their country. Regardless
of his painful situation, the Latin chiefs repeated their
demands, resented his delays, suspected his intentions, and
exacted a decisive answer of peace or war. The haughty
summons was delivered by three French knights and three
Venetian deputies, who girded on their swords, mounted
their horses, pierced through the angry multitude, and
entered with a fearless countenance the palace and presence
of the Greek emperor. In a peremptory tone they recapitulated
their services and his engagements, and boldly
declared that unless their just claims were fully and immediately
satisfied, they should no longer hold him either as a
sovereign or a friend. After this defiance, the first that
had ever wounded an imperial ear, they departed, without
betraying any symptoms of fear; but their escape from a
servile palace and a furious city astonished the ambassadors
themselves, and their return to the camp was the signal of
mutual hostility.

âAmong the Greeks all authority and wisdom were overborne
by the impetuous multitude, who mistook their rage
for valour, their numbers for strength, and their fanaticism
for the support and inspiration of Heaven. In the eyes of
384

both nations Alexius was false and contemptible: the base
and spurious race of the Angeli was rejected with clamorous
disdain; and the people of Constantinople encompassed the
senate, to demand at their hands a more worthy emperor.
To every senator, conspicuous by his birth or dignity, they
successively presented the purple,âby each senator the
deadly garment was repulsed; the contest lasted three days,
and we may learn from the historian Nicetas, one of the
members of the assembly, that fear and weakness were the
guardians of their loyalty. A phantom, who vanished in
oblivion, was forcibly proclaimed by the crowd; but the
author of the tumult and the leader of the war was a prince
of the house of Ducas, and his common appellation of
Alexius must be discriminated by the epithet of Mourzoufle,
which in the vulgar idiom expressed the close junction of
his black and shaggy eyebrows. At once a patriot and a
courtier, the perfidious Mourzoufle, who was not destitute
of cunning and courage, opposed the Latins both in speech
and action, inflamed the passions and prejudices of the
Greeks, and insinuated himself into the confidence and
favour of Alexius, who trusted him with the office of great
chamberlain, and tinged his buskins with the colours of
royalty. At the dead of night he rushed into the bedchamber
with an affrighted aspect, exclaiming that the
palace was attacked by the people and betrayed by the
guards. Starting from his couch, the unsuspecting prince
threw himself into the arms of his enemy, who had contrived
his escape by a private staircase. But that staircase terminated
in a prison. Alexius was seized, stripped, and loaded
with chains, and after tasting some days the bitterness of
death, he was poisoned, or strangled, or beaten with clubs,
at the command or in the presence of the tyrant. The
emperor Isaac Angelus soon followed his son to the grave,
and Mourzoufle, perhaps, might spare the superfluous crime
of hastening the extinction of impotence and blindness.

âThe death of the emperors and the usurpation of Mourzoufle
had changed the nature of the quarrel. It was no
longer the disagreement of allies who overvalued their services,
or neglected their obligations; the French and Venetians
forgot their complaints against Alexius, dropped a tear
on the untimely fate of their companion, and swore revenge
385

against the perfidious nation which had crowned his assassin.
Yet the prudent doge was still inclined to negotiate; he
demanded as a debt, a subsidy, or a fine, fifty thousand pounds
of gold,âabout two millions sterling; nor would the conference
have been abruptly broken, if the zeal or policy of
Mourzoufle had not refused to sacrifice the Greek church
to the safety of the state. Amidst the invectives of his
foreign and domestic enemies, we may discover that he was
not unworthy of the character which he had assumed, of the
public champion. The second siege of Constantinople was
far more laborious than the first; the treasury was replenished,
and discipline was restored by a severe inquisition
into the abuses of the former reign; and Mourzoufle, an
iron mace in his hand, visiting the posts, and affecting the
port and aspect of a warrior, was an object of terror to his
soldiers, at least, and to his kinsmen. Before and after the
death of Alexius, the Greeks made two vigorous and well-conducted
attempts to burn the navy in the harbour; but
the skill and courage of the Venetians repulsed the fire-ships;
and the vagrant flames wasted themselves without
injury in the sea. In a nocturnal sally, the Greek emperor
was vanquished by Henry, brother of the count of Flanders;
the advantages of number and surprise aggravated the shame
of his defeat; his buckler was found on the field of battle;
and the imperial standard, a divine image of the Virgin,
was presented as a trophy and a relic to the Cistercian
monks, the disciples of St. Bernard. Near three months,
without excepting the holy season of Lent, were consumed
in skirmishes and preparations, before the Latins were ready
or resolved for a general attack. The land fortifications had
been found impregnable; and the Venetian pilots represented
that on the shore of the Propontis the anchorage was unsafe,
and the ships must be driven by the current far away to the
straits of the Hellespont; a prospect not unpleasing to the
reluctant pilgrims, who sought every opportunity of breaking
the army. From the harbour, therefore, the assault was
determined by the assailants, and expected by the besieged;
and the emperor had placed his scarlet pavilions on a neighbouring
height, to direct and animate the efforts of his
troops. A fearless spectator, whose mind could entertain
the idea of pomp and pleasure, might have admired the long
386

array of two embattled armies, which extended above half a
league, the one on the ships and galleys, the other on the
walls and towers raised above the ordinary level by several
stages of wooden turrets. Their first fury was spent in the
discharge of darts, stones, and fire from the engines; but
the water was deep; the French were bold; the Venetians
were skilful; they approached the walls; and a desperate
conflict of swords, spears, and battle-axes was fought on the
trembling bridges that grappled the floating to the stable
batteries. In more than a hundred places the assault was
urged, and the defence was sustained, till the superiority of
ground and numbers finally prevailed, and the Latin trumpets
sounded a retreat. On the ensuing days the attack
was renewed with equal vigour, and a similar event; and in
the night the doge and the barons held a council, apprehensive
only for the public danger; not a voice pronounced the
words of escape or treaty; and each warrior, according to
his temper, embraced the hope of victory, or the assurance
of a glorious death. By the experience of the former siege
the Greeks were instructed, but the Latins were animated;
and the knowledge that Constantinople might be taken was
of more avail than the local precautions which that knowledge
had inspired for its defence. In the third assault, two ships
were linked together, to double their strength; a strong
north wind drove them on the shore; the bishops of Troyes
and Soissons led the van; and the auspicious names of the

Pilgrim
and the
Paradise
resounded along the line. The
episcopal banners were displayed on the walls; a hundred
marks of silver had been promised to the first adventurers;
and if their reward was intercepted by death, their names
have been immortalized by fame. Four towers were scaled;
three gates were burst open, and the French knights, who
might tremble on the waves, felt themselves invincible on
horseback, on the solid ground. Shall I relate that the
thousands who guarded the emperorâs person fled on the
approach and before the lance of a single warrior? Their
ignominious flight is attested by their countryman Nicetas:
an army of phantoms marched with the French hero, and he
was magnified to a giant in the eyes of the Greeks. While
the fugitives deserted their posts and cast away their arms,
the Latins entered the city under the banners of their
387

leaders: the streets and gates opened for their passage; and
either design or accident kindled a third conflagration, which
consumed in a few hours the measure of three of the largest
cities of France. In the close of the evening, the barons
checked their troops and fortified their stations; they were
awed by the extent and populousness of the capital, which
might yet require the labour of a month, if the churches and
palaces were conscious of their internal strength. But in
the morning, a suppliant procession, with crosses and images,
announced the submission of the Greeks, and deprecated
the wrath of the conquerors; the usurper escaped through
the Golden gate: the palaces of BlachernÃ¦ and Boucoleon
were occupied by the count of Flanders and the marquis of
Montferrat; and the empire, which still bore the name of
Constantine, and the title of Roman, was subverted by the
arms of the Latin pilgrims.â

We have not space, nor perhaps is it our province, to
detail the awful results to Constantinople of this success of
the barbarians, for such, notwithstanding our prejudices in
favour of the western warriors, were the daring band who
had, like pirates, made themselves masters of this magnificent
city. No fact in history is better proved than the state of
ignorant vandalism of the
pilgrims
, as the great historian so
falsely or ironically calls them. By whatever means they
had been gathered together, for whatever purposes they
might be intended, or whatever vile passions they gratified,
Constantinople, when taken by the Franks and the Venetians,
was the most glorious emporium of objects of high art
and fine taste the world had ever seen. With the conquerors
nothing was valuable but money, and to obtain this all was
sacrificed: precious works of art were melted for the sake of
the metals they were made of; others were mutilated to
facilitate division, and numberless others were destroyed in
hopes of finding treasures concealed within them. No building
was held sacred that would pay for the demolition; no
object remained in the place with which it was naturally
associated, if it was of the smallest value elsewhere. We
read with horror of the destruction of great cities and holy
places by the followers of Mahomet: no Mussulmans ever
exceeded in barbarous ignorance or cruel cupidity the band
of adventurers who plundered the treasures of ages in the
388

sack of Constantinople. Great historians have run riot in
the descriptions of these treasures; and so interesting are
they, that it is with the utmost reluctance we turn from
them without further notice. âBehold!â cries the justly
exasperated historian Nicetas, âbehold what you have done!
contemplate your exploits! you who term the Greeks vile,
and the Saracens barbarous! These barbarians have never
behaved towards your compatriots in this manner. They
have neither violated the women of the Latins, nor devoured
their riches, nor stained the holy sepulchre with horror and
carnage. You boasting talkers, you display the cross upon
your shoulders, and you, at all times, are ready to trample
it under foot for a little paltry gold and silver.â Tired
rather than satisfied with plunder, the conquerors proceeded
to the election of an emperor: Baldwin I. was crowned in
the year 1204. This new domination only lasted fifty-seven
years, under the name of the empire of the Latins. Under
Baldwin II., brother of Robert de Courtenay, the Greeks
revolted, drove out the Franks in 1261, and gave themselves
and the throne to Michael PalÃ¦ologus, whose posterity
reigned up to the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1453.

We come now to what some historians have termed the
greatest event of a period the most surprisingly conspicuous
in the history of mankind. We agree with them that the
subversion of the Christian empire of Constantinople by the
Turks was a
great
event, but not the
greatest
: the invention
of printing, the discovery of America, and the commencement
of the Reformation belong to the same half-century;
and either of these we conceive to be of much more importance
than whether Constantinople should be under such
degraded Christians as the Greeks, or be subjected to the
worshippers of the Prophet of Mecca.

Constantinople no longer preserved anything but the proud
remembrance of its ancient splendour. In that capital, once
so flourishing and so respected, there still breathed an
immense population; but that multitude, without force or
without courage, seemed only to be waiting to crouch
willingly under the strong hand that might be held forth to
389

enchain them. Frivolous acquirements, agreeable arts, preferred
by indolence and effeminacy to the exercise of essential
duties or useful labours, had annihilated love of country,
and dried up the springs of life of this unfortunate empire.
They wrote and they disputed: questions of philosophy and
theological quarrels were the sole concerns of the lazy
citizens, who had never stood in such pressing need of providing
for their own safety. Instead of being the heart of
an empire, the walls of Constantinople had become frontiers;
it had no dominions beyond them. The enemy appeared at
their gates: during the eight hundred years that Mahometanism
had progressed, the city had often been threatened,
and in vain; but the harvest was now ripe, the time was
come, and the sickle, in the hands of Mahomet II., was
employed in earnest workmanlike fashion. He began by
constructing the castle of the Dardanelles on the Bosphorus.
Constantine PalÃ¦ologus, who then reigned, in vain was
anxious to prevent this: his own subjects thwarted his correct
views; their presumption equalled their blindness; they
boasted that they could destroy that fortress the moment it
was any annoyance to them. Constantine is an exemplification
of the proverb, that it is not the last step of a journey
that creates the fatigue, nor the last ruler of an empire that
brings about its ruin: few of the predecessors of the emperor
had better qualities than he displayed in circumstances of
great emergency; and had they all been like him, those circumstances
would never have occurred. The subversion of
the empire was not due to the doctrines of Mahomet or the
valour of their followersâit was an internal decay, produced
by the vices and weaknesses of ages.

Five or six thousand men, taken from the very dregs of
the people, composed the national force, which was augmented
by a few European troops, under Justinian, a
Genoese. These were the only resource of a city inhabited
by men incapable of defending themselves, and who trusted
entirely to a few mercenary strangers, who still deigned to
protect them. All the Greeks individually boasted of their
country and its fame; and yet not one of them would have
sacrificed to its welfare his pleasures, his luxuries, his comforts,

or his opinions
. Threatened by the most frightful of
misfortunes, they awaited the fatal blow with an insensible
390

stupidity, like the animals who still continue feeding at the
foot of the altar which is about to be stained with their
blood. The emperor tried to induce them to contribute a
portion of their riches to the defence of the state: but he
could obtain nothing. In times of prosperity, princes had
levied tributes destined solely to swell their treasury or to
be wasted in superfluities. The people, plundered without
occasion, had unfortunately learnt to confound the abuse of
authority with the real wants of a government. As long as
the supreme power could make itself respected, it dared to
require all: it was no longer fearedâeverything was denied
to it. In this case the solitary virtue of Constantine was
powerlessâthe corruption was deep and universalâa
Hercules could not have cleansed the AugÃ¦an stable; and,
though endowed with many good qualities, Constantine was
not a Hercules. PalÃ¦ologus and his courtiers favoured, at
least in appearance, the union of the two churches of the
East and West. The holy father promised to send some
galleys and troops. The Greeks still further flattered themselves
that the exhortations of the pontiff would prevail
upon the Christian princes to undertake a crusade: that
was their last hope. Cardinal Isidore came to Constantinople
as legate from the Holy See. He celebrated divine
service in the church of St. Sophia, according to the liturgy
of Rome. This threw the whole city into a state of alarm.
The people flocked in crowds to the retreat of the monk
Gennadius, to consult with him what was to be done. The
solitary affixed his reply to the door of his cell. He declared
in this document that the agreement drawn up at Florence
was not orthodox. He at the same time announced the
greatest misfortunes to those who should adopt the
impious

reconciliation of the Greeks with the Latins. Immediately
the devotees, the nuns who were under the direction of
Gennadius, the abbots, the priests, the citizens, the soldiersâfor
the contagion spread to all ordersâjoined in one unanimous
anathema! The church of St. Sophia was considered
a defiled place. Communication with the Latins ceased:
they would prefer, they said, to see the turban of Mahomet
displayed, to the appearance of the Roman purple, or the
cardinalâs hat.

But now the sultan, having employed two years in preparations,
391

marched towards Constantinople at the head of an
army of four hundred thousand men. This fearful multitude
was composed, for the most part, of newly-conquered
nations, which he dragged after him. Out of all these he
had not more than thirty thousand horse and sixty thousand
foot of disciplined troops. The rest were nothing but a
collection of slaves, torn by force from the places of their
birth, without arms and almost naked, who were obliged to
be driven to the combat by strokes of the whip or the
scimitar. In all battles they were placed in front, in order
to fatigue the enemy with the shedding of blood: the regular
reserved troops were then to take advantage of their exhaustion;
in sieges they served as fascines, to fill up ditches.
Such was the manner of fighting with the Turks, so that
when they came in contact with the Christians, it was generally
remarked they had the disadvantage at the commencement
of a battle, but won it at last.

Whilst Mahomet was investing Constantinople by land,
his fleet, consisting of two hundred and fifty sail, advanced
to the Dardanelles. This prodigious number of vessels
could not, however, prevent four ships from the isle of Chio,
after having fought for a whole day against the united
strength of the Ottoman, and killed a thousand of their
men, from entering the port of Constantinople, and there
landing a few troops and some provisions. Enormous iron
chains barred the entrance of the Turkish ships. It is
affirmed that Mahomet, to surmount this obstacle, had
recourse to an expedient till that time unheard of, and
which has never been repeated since: he transported by
land eighty galleys in the course of one night, and at daybreak
launched them into the interior of the basin of the
port, before the eyes of the besieged, terrified and astonished
at this extraordinary spectacle. The manner in which
this transportation was effected, which savours of the marvellous,
proves to what an extent the conqueror carried his
despotism, and could overcome difficulty by his mere will.
The vessels were drawn, by means of machines and human
arms, along planks thoroughly greased, which covered a
space of road two leagues in length. The sultan had at his
command the most skilful engineers of Europe and Asia.
The progress of these vessels offered a most curious exhibition.
392

They were commanded by pilots, had their sails
unfurled as if upon the sea, and advanced over a hilly piece
of ground, by the light of torches and flambeaux, and to the
sound of trumpets and clarions, without the Genoese, who
inhabited Galata, daring to offer any opposition to the
passage. The Greeks, fully occupied in guarding their
ramparts, had no suspicion of the design of the enemy.
They could not comprehend what could be the object or the
cause of all the tumult that was heard during the whole
night from the sea-shore, till at dawn they beheld the
Mussulman standards flying in their port.

A Hungarian, who had not been able to procure employment
among the Greeks, founded for Mahomet some pieces
of artillery that would carry balls weighing two hundred
pounds. A modern author judiciously observes that each
of these balls would have required nearly a hundred pounds
of powder, of which only a fifteenth part would have taken
fire at the moment of the explosion. These enormous pieces
of ordnance appeared more formidable than they really were.
The use of artillery fired by gunpowder was not more than
a hundred years old; and, with a true Eastern imagination,
Mahomet II. wished to have the largest and most powerful
cannon that had ever been made. He was satisfied with
the answer to the first question he put to the Hungarian
artist. âAm I able to cast a cannon capable of throwing a
ball or stone of sufficient size to batter the walls of Constantinople?âââI
am not ignorant of their strength, but
were they more solid than those of Babylon, I could oppose
an engine of superior power: the position and management
of that engine must be left to your engineers.â On this
assurance a foundry was established at Adrianople. An
enormous piece of ordnance was produced within three
months; its bore was twelve palms, and it was capable of
throwing a ball or stone weighing six hundred pounds. It
was tried in a vacant place before the new palace of Adrianople;
but notice of its being fired was obliged to be published
on the preceding day, to prevent the effects of
astonishment and fear. The explosion is said to have been
heard over a circuit of a hundred furlongs; the ball was cast
by the gunpowder above a mile, and when it fell it buried
itself a fathom deep in the ground. To convey this cannon,
393

thirty waggons were linked together, and it was drawn by a
team of sixty horses: two hundred men walked by the sides
of it, to poise it and keep it steady; two hundred and fifty
men went before, to level the way and repair the bridges;
and it required two months to draw it a distance of one
hundred and fifty miles.

The Turks, masters of the port, established batteries on
the side next the sea, whilst the army pressed the city on the
land side. They employed trenches, mines, and countermines.
The besieged, who defended themselves with some
spirit at first, repaired the breaches with incredible diligence.
They even made some successful sorties. The hopes of
being succoured by Huniades supported them for some
time. Mahomet began to relax in his efforts; it is even
said that he had thoughts of raising the siege. At length,
however, he resolved to make one more attempt. Before
he proceeded to the general assault, he proposed to Constantine
to leave him the Peloponnesus, upon condition of
his giving up the imperial city. He was anxious, he said,
to prevent the destruction of Constantinople. The emperor
replied he would rather be buried beneath the ruins of his
capital. Both Christians and Mahometans prepared themselves,
by fast and prayer, for the action of that morrow
which was to decide the fate of the two empires. It was
the 29th of May. On the evening before, Mahomet gave
notice that he should abandon the plunder of the city to his
soldiers, only strictly commanding that they should not set
fire to any of the edifices.

The besieged from their walls contemplated with terror
the numbers of the enemy about to assail them. The disproportion
was so great, that every Christian calculated he
should have to combat fifty or sixty Turks. The sultan
commenced the attack about three oâclock in the morning,
by sending to the assault thirty thousand of his worst troops,
in order to fatigue the besieged, and that the heaped-up
bodies of this multitude might fill the ditches, and render
access to the parapets the more easy. The stick and the
scimitar were necessary to compel this forlorn hope to
march: they all perished. At sunrise Mahomet ordered
the trumpets to sound a fresh signal; the artillery thundered
from all quarters, and quickly drove away all who had
394

appeared on the walls. The Janissaries rushed to the
breach, uttering horrible cries. Mahomet rode behind his
troops upon a superb charger, in order to make them march
forward with the greater celerity. Never was greater courage
exhibited: the first Janissary who mounted the walls
of Constantinople was to be made a pacha, and be loaded with
wealth. Some climbed over the ruins of the walls, through
a shower of arrows, darts, stones, and fire-balls. Standing
on the tops of their ladders, others fought with the besieged,
who repulsed them with their pikes, whilst others raised
themselves upon the shoulders of their comrades to get to
the breach. The whole city was busied in succouring its
brave defenders; women, children, and old men brought
them stones, joists, and bars of red-hot iron to launch at the
Turks. The cannons, directed to the points where the
Turks were thickest, all at once opened their ranks, and
the Ottomans, who already touched the summit of the walls,
were hurled into the ditches. Tor two hours they fought
thus, with a fury equal to the danger of the besieged and
the value of the city to be conquered; a cloud of arrows,
dust, and smoke shrouded the combatants. Thirty Janissaries
at length succeeded in mounting the walls, and killed
and overthrew all who came in their way: they were soon
followed by a crowd of daring comrades, animated by their
example. In an instant the air resounded with cries of
victory: the Turks had penetrated to the port. Zagan
Pacha, who commanded the attack there, reproached the
sailors with being less brave than the land troops. Encouraged
by the success of the Janissaries, they made one more
furious charge upon the Greeks. The latter wavered in
their resistance; the sailors gained possession of a tower,
and hoisted the standard of the crescent, whilst other Turks
hewed an opening with their axes at several of the city
gates, through which the rest of the army poured in
crowds. Constantine, accompanied by a few of his guards
and some faithful servants, threw himself, sword in hand,
into the thickest of the Ottoman battalions. Less afflicted
by the loss of his crown than by the terror of being loaded
with irons and led in triumph through Asia, he continued
fighting bravely, when a Turk cut off the half of his face
with a stroke of his scimitar, and gave him the death he
395

was seeking. With him fell the empire of the East, which
had existed eleven hundred and forty-three years. One
Constantine had founded it; another of the same name, not
less brave but less fortunate, saw it perish. Mahomet caused
his body to be sought for, and rendered it all the honours
due to the sovereign of a great empire. More than forty
thousand men were killed in this dayâs conflict, and more
than sixty thousand loaded with chains. Neither age nor
sex, nor object ever so holy, was respected during three
days in this unfortunate city; palaces, cloisters, sacred edifices,
and private houses, were stained with the blood of their
wretched inhabitants, and disgraced by all the crimes that
barbarism, cruelty, and lust could devise. At the end of
three days, order and discipline succeeded to carnage.
Mahomet restored liberty to many of his captives, sent
them back to their houses, promised them his protection,
and engaged them to continue to cultivate the arts and
commerce in a city he had chosen as the capital of his
empire. This great event happened in the year 768 of the
Hegira, and in the year of Christ 1453; in the reign of
Charles VII. of France, and of Henry VI. of England.

A.D. 1807.

The course of the Mahometan conquests, and the spread
of their religion, constitute one of the great events of the
history of our globe. In about eight hundred years the
disciples of the humble prophet had subdued or extended
their influence over great part of Asia and the north of
Africa, and had now not only gained a footing in Europe, but
had taken its greatest capital. But here their great tide
of success seems to have stopped; it was their culminating
point. They have made partial conquests since; but, altogether,
not so much as was achieved by Mahomet II.

WEINSBERG.

A.D. 1138.

Our
only motive for noticing this unimportant siege is a
desire of relieving the attention of the reader, too long
fixed to perils of âthe imminent deadly breach,â by an
amusing anecdote.

In the year 1138, the duke of Wittemberg warmly
396

opposed the election of Conrad III., who was proclaimed
emperor; and when the new monarch had assumed the
diadem, he refused to acknowledge him, and shut himself
up in the little city of Weinsberg. The angry emperor
immediately laid siege to the place: the garrison resisted
his attacks with manly bravery, and only yielded to force
and greatly superior numbers. The conqueror, at first,
determined to submit all to fire and sword; but he relented
in favour of the women, to whom he granted permission to
depart, each carrying with her as much as she was able of
what she most valued in the world. The wife of the duke
took advantage of this indulgence to save the life of her
husband. She mounted him upon her shoulders, and all
the women of the city followed her example. When Conrad
saw them going out loaded with this precious burden, and
with the duchess at their head, he could not maintain either
his gravity or his anger against such a spectacle: he pardoned
the men for the sake of the women, and the city was
saved.

LISBON.

A.D. 1147.

Alphonso
, a prince of the house of Burgundy, having
assumed the title of king of Portugal, felt that he could not
truly be considered monarch of that country while his
capital remained in the hands of the Saracens. Too weak
to undertake the conquest himself, he made a religious
crusade of it, and English and Flemings, who had embarked
for the Holy Land, were induced by the prospect of greater
wealth without going so far to attain it, to take up his
cause. The great historian of the Crusades attributes this
dereliction to a religious feeling, which operated as well in
Portugal as in Palestine. We have no hesitation in agreeing
that the Crusaders were acted upon in both countries by
similar motives; in this case, it was too transparent to be
possibly mistaken. The new auxiliaries covered the sea
397

with their vessels, and blockaded the city, whilst Alphonso
besieged it by land with an army much more brave than
numerous. During five months, several assaults were
given and sanguinary battles were fought. Willing to
make one last and great attempt, Alphonso drew up
his soldiers in order of battle before the place, and,
making his dispositions for a general attack, said to them:
âWarriors, I am about to lead you to glory; dare to
conquer, and you will triumph. Advance boldly through
stones, arrows, and fire; brave death, and nothing can
resist your courage. Hasten, my friends, hasten to enrich
yourselves with the spoils of the Arabs. You, warriors of
the Cross, whom Heaven has sent, God will bless your
arms; noble pay and rich possessions will be the reward of
your valour.â He had scarcely finished speaking, when all
the soldiers rushed to the walls; scrambling over one
another up and over the ruins. Alphonso nobly supported
the title of their leader; the besieged vainly opposed force
to force, the Christians drove them in, in all quarters, and
broke down the gate called Alfama. In a moment they
were spread through the city; they massacred all found
with arms in their hands, pillaged the wealth of the infidels,
and planted the princeâs standard upon all the towers.
The capture of Lisbon soon rendered Alphonso king of all
Portugal.

DAMASCUS.

A.D. 634.

The
Saracens attacked Damascus, with the hopes of a
speedy capture, but the inhabitants made a brave resistance.
The garrison was with difficulty restrained within the walls.
At the moment the troops of the emperor Heraclius came
to the succour of the city, two brothers, commanders of
Damascus, made a vigorous sortie, pillaged the rear-guard
of the Saracens, and carried off their women. The most
398

important prisoner was Caulah, sister of Derar, one of the
early heroes of Mahometanism, whose fanatical zeal produced
such miraculous triumphs. Dazzled by the charms
of his prize, Peter, one of the commanders of Damascus,
wished to treat her as a conquered captive; but Caulah
repulsed him with contempt. As if by a pre-concerted
movement, she and her companions in misfortune seized the
tent-poles, and ranging themselves back to back, refused to
go to Damascus. Whilst hesitating to fight with women,
though thus armed and resolute, Caled,
the sword of God
,
came up, charged the Romans and made a horrible carnage:
the army of Heraclius was defeated at Ainadin. Caled
reappeared before Damascus, carried it by assault, and all
the inhabitants were given up to indiscriminate slaughter.
When Heraclius learned the fall of Damascus, he exclaimed,
âFarewell to Syria!â

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1149.

Being compelled by the interest they inspire, to give at
considerable length several of the sieges in which the
Crusaders were engaged, we cannot spare room for more
than a notice of that of Damascus, referring our readers
for details, which will repay the research, to the pages of
Michaud and Gibbon.

Louis VII., king of France, in company with Conrad III.,
emperor of Germany, who had led armies from Europe for
the recovery of the Holy Land, laid siege to Damascus, one
of the most delightfully situated and splendid cities in the
world. By its populousness and wealth, Damascus excited
the envy of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Tripoli, which were in
the hands of the Christians, and probably affected their
commerce. But it was neither the religion of the inhabitants
nor the beauty of its position that tempted the
Crusaders; it was enough for them to know that it was one
of the richest cities of the East: nothing so soon induced a
knight of the Cross to buckle on his spurs and take his
lance, as the prospect of the plunder of an Oriental city.
Damascus was well fortified on the east and on the south;
but on the north, a multitude of gardens, inclosed with
hedges and canals, formed its principal bulwark. And let
399

not our readers smile at such a fortification; when every
one of the innumerable hedges formed admirable ambuscades,
and when every one of the thousands of trees was
filled with archers instead of birds, the Crusaders found
these gardens no âbed of roses.â It was these places, cut
through by a vast number of sinuous paths, in which the
Crusaders had to make their first assaults; and it required
five days to carry all the positions, which were defended
with the greatest firmness by the Saracens. They would
have taken Damascus, if their usual enemy, Discord, had
not prevailed among the Crusaders: like the bear-hunters
of the fabulist, they quarrelled for the sovereignty of the
city before they had taken it. By the perfidious advice of
the Syrian barons, they abandoned the attack on the
northern side, to make others on the east and the south.
The Saracens immediately repossessed themselves of the
gardens, which was the only point on which the city was
weak: Damascus was missed, and the Crusaders disgracefully
raised the siege.

ST. JEAN DâACRE, or PTOLEMAIS.

A.D. 1191.

The
ill success of the first Crusades appeared to redouble
the zeal of the Christians for the recovery of the Holy Land.
Great misfortunes had attended many of the enterprises, but
vast numbers had been enriched by the plunder of magnificent
cities, and some of the leaders had acquired territorial
possessions. Rome, whose policy it was to keep up the
fanaticism, did all in its power to promote these wicked,
senseless expeditions, and never ceased calling the attention
of Europe to Jerusalem defiled by the infidels, and its holy
places profaned. These touching pictures, accompanied by
numerous promises of indulgence, had a prodigious effect:
France and England for a moment laid aside their quarrels;
and their kings, Philip and Richard, levied armies for the
delivery of the Holy Land. This was the golden age for
400

ambitious popes and greedy princes or adventurers. Whether
Celestine urged CÅur de Lion to undertake a mad
expedition to the East, or Innocent III. hounded on Simon
de Montfort to his massacre and plunder of the Albigeois,
the motives were the sameâthirst of power and influence in
the pontiffs, and solid gain of wealth in their tools.

Followed by their numerous battalions, accompanied by
their most powerful vassals, the two kings embarked and
met at Messina. The artful Tancred, king of Sicily, nearly
succeeded in his attempt to embroil the two monarchs; but
a religious moderation quieted the nascent storm. The
French directed their course towards St. Jean dâAcre, which
city, having an excellent port, was equally necessary to the
Christians to preserve Tyre and Tripoli, as it was to the
Saracens to secure a communication between Egypt and
Syria. For more than two years, Guy of Lusignan, king of
Jerusalem, had besieged this important place with forces
much less numerous than were employed in defending it.
With an army increased by torrents of Crusaders, with
which the West constantly inundated the East, and the
wreck of the army of the emperor Frederick, Guy ventured
to march against Saladin, who was advancing to succour
Acre. Never had the Christian legions evinced more ardour;
the combat was bloody, but the success doubtful. Each
claimed the honour of the victory; but certainly the loss
was least on the part of the Crusaders; they resumed the
siege, and the besieged continued to defend themselves with
the same vigour, when Philip Augustus arrived in the camp.
His presence added greatly to the hopes of the besiegers:
the walls of Acre were fast falling beneath the attacks of its
numerous assailants; the victorious soldiers would speedily
have achieved the long-delayed conquest, if the king of the
French had not checked their courage out of courtesy for
the English monarch: he thus lost the great opportunity of
which the infidels made good use; they repaired their
breaches; and with the strength of their walls their spirits
revived also. At length Richard arrived, dragging in his
train, bound in chains of silver, Isaac Comnenus, king, or
as he ostentatiously styled himself, emperor of Cyprus, which
island he had conquered during his voyage. A happy harmony
presided over the first proceedings of the kings of
401

France and England, who shared by turns both honour and
danger. The army calculated upon seeing Acre yield to the
first general assault. When the French monarch attacked
the city, Richard mounted the trenches. On the following
day the king of England conducted the assault, and Philip in
his turn provided for the safety of the besiegers. The emulation
which prevailed between the two nations and their
kings produced extraordinary acts of valour.

PtolemaÃ¯s, or Acre, saw indeed beneath its walls all the
illustrious captains and warriors that Europe could then
boast, and that in an age excelling most others in chivalric
bravery. The tents of the Franks covered a vast plain, and
their army presented a noble aspect. A spectator, on
glancing his eye along the shore at the towers of Acre and
the camp of the Christians, in which they had built houses
and traced streets, traversed incessantly by an immense
crowd, might have imagined he saw two rival cities which
were at war with each other. Each nation had its separate
quarter, and so many languages were spoken by the Crusaders,
that the Mussulmans could not find interpreters
enough to enable them to understand the prisoners. In
this confused multitude, each people had a different character,
different manners, and different arms; but at the signal
of battle, all were animated with the same zeal and the same
ardour. The presence of the two monarchs had re-established
discipline, and Acre must soon have surrendered, if
discord, that eternal enemy of the Christians, had not entered
their camp with Richard.

Conrad of Montferrat and Guy de Lusignan both claimed
the poor honour of being king of Jerusalem; and the
kings of England and France took opposite sides; indeed, it
was impossible for the headstrong self-willed Richard and
the astute politic Philip to remain long friends in the same
camp. Whenever Philip took the field, Richard played
Achilles, and sulked in his tent. The besieged had never
more than one of the monarchs to contend with at a time;
and the Christian army really became less redoubtable for
its accession of strength. Amidst their disputes, both
monarchs fell dangerously ill; and their hatred and suspicion
were so great, that each accused the other with having made
an attempt upon his life. As Saladin sent them refreshments
402

and physicians, and as they addressed frequent messages
to him, each monarch reproached the other with
keeping up an impious understanding with the Saracens.

They, however, began to be convinced that such dissensions
jeopardized the safety of the army and the interests of
the cause; the Jerusalem monarchy was amicably arranged,
and the siege was resumed with fresh vigour. But the
besieged had taken advantage of the respite granted to them
by the Christian cabals, and had strengthened their fortifications.
The besiegers were astonished at the opposition they
met with. We should have told our readers that Saladin,
with a numerous army, was on the heights above Acre; so
that the Christians were between the two fires of his forces
and the garrison of the city. Whenever the Crusaders
attacked Acre, Saladin made a skirmishing dash at their
camp. Many battles were fought at the foot of the hills;
but on the two occasions of general assaults on the city, the
Christians were obliged to return precipitately to defend
their tents.

But time must exhaust the resources of a city so strongly
beleaguered: the walls began to crumble under incessant
attacks, and war, famine, and disease weakened the garrison;
there were not soldiers enough to defend the walls and move
about the cumbrous machines; the place wanted provisions,
munitions of war, and Greek fire. The troops and the
people began to murmur against Saladin and the emirs; and
the commander of the garrison at length proposed a capitulation
to Philip Augustus; but he swore by the God of the
Christians that he would not spare a single inhabitant of
PtolemaÃ¯s if the Mussulmans did not restore all the cities
that had fallen into their power since the battle of
Tiberias.

Irritated by this determination, the chief of the emirs
retired, saying that he and his companions would rather
bury themselves beneath the ruins of the city than listen to
such terms, and that they would defend Acre
as a lion
defends his blood-stained lair
. On his return into the place,
he communicated his courage, or rather his despair, to every
heart. When the Christians resumed their assaults, they
were repulsed with a vigour that astonished them. âThe
tumultuous waves of the Franks,â says an Arabian author,
403

ârolled towards the place with the rapidity of a torrent;
they mounted the half-ruined walls as wild goats ascend the
steepest rocks, whilst the Saracens precipitated themselves
upon the besiegers like stones detached from the summits of
mountains.â In one general assault a Florentine knight of
the family of Buonaguisi, followed by a few of his men,
fought his way into one of the towers of the infidels, and
got possession of the Mussulman banner that floated from
it. Overpowered by numbers and forced to retreat, he
returned to the camp, bearing off the flag he had so heroically
won. In the same assault, Alberic Clement, the first
marshal of France of whom history makes mention, scaled
the ramparts, and, sword in hand, penetrated into the city,
where he found a glorious death. Stephen, count of Blois,
and several knights were burnt by the Greek fire, the boiling
oil, the melted lead, and heated sand which the besiegers
poured down upon all who approached the walls.

The obstinate ardour of the Mussulmans was sustained
during several days; but as they received no succour, many
emirs, at length despairing of the safety of PtolemaÃ¯s, threw
themselves by night into a bark, to seek an asylum in the
camp of Saladin, preferring to encounter the anger of the
sultan to perishing by the swords of the Christians. This
desertion, and the contemplation of their ruined towers, filled
the Mussulmans with terror. Whilst pigeons and divers
constantly announced to Saladin the horrible distresses of
the besieged, the latter came to the resolution of leaving the
city by night, and braving every peril to join the Saracen
army. But their project being discovered by the Christians,
they blocked up and guarded every passage by which the
enemy could possibly escape. The emirs, the soldiers, and
the inhabitants then became convinced that they had no
hope but in the mercy of the Christian leaders, and promised,
if they would grant them liberty and life, to give up sixteen
hundred prisoners, together with the wood of the true cross.
By the capitulation, they engaged to pay two hundred thousand
byzants of gold, and the garrison, with the entire
population, were to remain hostages for the execution of the
treaty.

A Mussulman soldier was sent from the city to announce
to Saladin that the garrison had been forced to capitulate.
404

The sultan, who was preparing to make a last effort to save
the place, learnt the news with deep regret. He summoned
a council to know if they approved of the capitulation; but
scarcely were the principal emirs assembled in his tent, when
they saw the standards of the Crusaders floating over the
walls of PtolemaÃ¯s.

The terms of the capitulation remained unexecuted;
Saladin, under various pretexts, deferring the payments.
Richard, irritated by a delay which appeared to him a breach
of faith, revenged himself upon his prisoners. Without pity
for disarmed enemies, or regard for the Christians he exposed
to sanguinary reprisals, he massacred five thousand
Mussulmans before the city they had so bravely defended,
and within sight of Saladin, who shared the disgrace of this
barbarity by thus abandoning his bravest and most faithful
warriors.

Such was the conclusion of this famous siege, which lasted
nearly three years, in which the Crusaders shed more blood
and exhibited more bravery than ought to have sufficed for
the subjugation of the whole of Asia. More than a hundred
skirmishes and nine great battles were fought before the
walls of the city; several flourishing armies came to recruit
armies nearly annihilated, and were in their turn replaced by
fresh armies. The bravest nobility of Europe perished in
this siege, swept away by sword or disease.

In this war, both sides exhibited their fanaticism to the
utmost extent; bishops and imaums equally promising remission
of sins and crowns of martyrdom. Whilst the king of
Jerusalem caused the book of the Evangelists to be borne
before him, Saladin would often pause on the field of battle
to offer up a prayer, or read a chapter from the Koran. The
Franks and the Christians mutually accused each other of
ignorance of the true God, and of outraging him by their
ceremonies. The Christians rushed upon their enemies,
shouting
Dieu le veut! Dieu le veut!
and the Saracens as
loudly responded by their war-cry of
Islam! Islam!

As it has been our constant wish to scatter a few flowers
among the melancholy scenes it is our task to paint, we
cannot omit a celebrated story connected with the siege of
Acre.

Among the bravest of the French knights was the all-accomplished
405

Raoul de Coucy. He tenderly loved the fair
Gabrielle de Vergy, and was by her as warmly loved in
return. Fearing to augment the torments which his mistress
underwent from the jealousy of her husband, the Seigneur
DufaiÃ«l, De Coucy enrolled himself among the heroes of the
Cross. Mortally wounded before Acre, he called his faithful
squire to his side, and charged him to convey to the lady
DufaiÃ«l, a letter from his own hand, together with the jewels
he had received from her. On the point of death, he likewise
made him promise, under the bond of an oath, to bear
his heart to the lady for whom alone it had ever breathed a
sigh. Raoul being dead, his faithful squire set out to execute
his last wishes: he crossed the seas, and reached Vermandois,
never, for a moment, abandoning the care of his precious but
sad charge. Arriving in the neighbourhood of the castle of
DufaiÃ«l it was his ill fortune to meet with its stern master,
the jealous tyrant of Gabrielle, by whom he was immediately
recognised. When closely interrogated, he described the
death of Raoul, and supposing with that all jealousy must be
at an end, told him likewise of the subject of his mission.
DufaiÃ«l eagerly seized the fatal deposit; transported with
jealousy, he returned to the castle, and caused the heart of
the unfortunate De Coucy to be served up to his lady in a
dish of hashed meat. She ate of it. âThat dish,â said he,
with a bitter smile, âmust appear very delicious to you, for
it is the heart of your lover.â At the same time he threw
upon the table the box, the letter, and the jewels. At the
sight of these, the lady DufaiÃ«l, convinced of the death of
her lover, and of the cruelty of her husband, fainted, and
only recovered to swear that that food should be her last.
A prey to the deepest despair, continually bathed in tears,
she persistently refused all aliment: in a very few days, grief
completed the sacrifice. Devoured by remorse, it is said
that the barbarous DufaiÃ«l survived her but a short time.

After the siege, Philipâs patience was exhausted by the
haughty assumption, and his envy excited by the heroic
exploits of Richard, and he returned to France, leaving a
body of troops under the command of his rival. We will
not venture into the wide field of CÅur de Lionâs miraculous
feats on this scene of action. Two of the greatest heroes of
history, Richard and Saladin, were matched against each
406

other, and, notwithstanding the superior sagacity and self-command
of Saladin, Richardâs extraordinary courage,
strength, and prowess maintained for him the character of
the bravest soldier of the age. But with all his valour and
exertions, he failed in the ostensible object of his enterprise:
circumstances of a various but imperative nature prevented
his reaching Jerusalem; he reluctantly turned his back upon
it, when within three leagues of it, and returned to Europe,
after concluding a truce with Saladin
for three years, three
months, three weeks, three days, and three hours.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1799.

Buonaparte, being informed of the coalition of the Ottomans
and the English to drive the French out of Egypt,
thought to be beforehand with them by carrying the war
into Syria. After taking Gaza and Jaffa, and gaining an
advantage over the Turks, on the 18th of March he arrived
before Acre. But the fortifications had been recently
repaired, under the direction of Sir Sidney Smith, the English
commodore, and a French engineer named PhÃ©lypeaux.
These fortifications consisted of curtains flanked with square
towers; the munitions were principally supplied by the
English ships. Thus Buonaparte was not only opposed to
Turks but to British sailors, led by one of those naval heroes
who so gloriously illustrated this war. Ahmet-Djezzar
Pasha was governor of Acre, a man addicted to cruelty,
and inspired with an inveterate hatred for the French. The
Turks easily allowed themselves to be shut up in the place,
confident of receiving constant supplies from their English
friends. The French were encamped upon an isolated height,
extending a league and a half to Cape Blanc. They found
abundant provisions in Nazareth and its neighbourhood. On
the 10th of March the trenches were opened at five hundred
toises from the body of the place; and, by the 28th, the
breach-batteries and counter-batteries were ready. For
want of siege artillery, field artillery was employed; in one
day, the French succeeded in making an opening in the
tower of attack; they had at the same time pushed on a
mine branch, to blow up the counterscarp. The mine was
sprung, and the French felt satisfied of its success. The
407

troops earnestly desired to be led to the assault. They
judged the breach would be similar to one in which they had
been successful at Jaffa; but scarcely had they rushed upon
it, than they found themselves stopped by a fosse fifteen feet
wide, backed by a good counterscarp. They planted their
ladders against it; the head of the grenadiers had already
descended; the breach was still eight feet from them; some
ladders were placed there. Adjutant Mailly mounted first,
but was struck dead by a ball. The fire of the place was
terrible; a simple tunnel had been formed upon the glacis;
the counterscarp was not touched; it impeded the French,
and forced a party of grenadiers intended to support the
first assailants to retreat. Adjutant-Generals Escale and
Langier were killed. A momentary panic seized the besieged,
and they were flying towards the port; but they as
suddenly rallied and returned to the breach. From the top
of the tower, they poured down upon the besiegers stones,
grenades, and all sorts of inflammable matters. The French
grenadiers regained their
boyaux
, foaming with rage. The
taking of Jaffa had led the French into a deceptive contempt
for these kinds of fortifications. They treated as a mere
field affair a siege which required all the resources of art.
At least so say the French authorities; Sir Sidney Smithâs
biographer, whilst doing perfect justice to the bravery and
efforts of the French, says that the fortifications, though
made the most of by PhÃ©lypeaux and Sir Sidney, were in a
very bad condition. Emboldened by this first success, the
Turks made several sorties, in which the loss was great on
both sides; that of the French, being, however, sensibly
increased by the death of their best engineer, Detroyes.
Djezzar made a sortie on the 7th of April; he marched in
three columns; at the head of each were English sailors
and marines, and all the batteries were served by cannoniers
of that nation. The French then perceived what was the
object of the sortie; the English wished to gain possession
of the first posts and the advanced works. Instantly, a fire
so well kept up was opened upon them from the
places
dâarmes
and the counterscarp, that all who had advanced
were either killed or wounded. The centre column exhibited
more firmness. It had been ordered to obtain possession of
the entrance to the mine. The commanding officer, Captain
408

Atfield, was shot whilst boldly leading on his men. The
English accounts say that the failure in this assault was owing
to the impetuosity, noise, and want of discipline of the
Turks. The English and Turks returned to the town without
having gained their object. The reverses of the parallels
remained covered by the English and their allies.

âThough hostilities were carried on with such vigour and
apparent rancour in the trenches and on the breach, yet there
were frequent suspensions of operations, and the distinguished
French generals, on such occasions, derived much
pleasure from visiting Sir Sidney on board the Tigre. On
one of these occasions, and after the besieging party had
made some progress, Generals Kleber and Junot were,
with Sir Sidney Smith, walking the quarter-deck of the Tigre,
in a very amiable mood of sociability, one on each side the
English commander.

âAfter a few turns in silence, Junot, regarding the battered
fortifications that lay before him, and they being
dwindled by distance into much insignificance, thus broke
out in the spirit of false
prophecy:â

ââCommodore, mark my words! three days hence, by this
very hour, the French tricolour shall be flying on the remains
of that miserable town.â

âSir Sidney very quickly replied: âMy good general,
before you shall have that town, I will blow it and you to
Jericho.â

ââ
Bien obligÃ©
,â observed Kleber, âvery much obliged,
indeed; it will be all in our way to India.â

ââWith all my heart!â rejoined Sir Sidney; âI shall be
most happy to assist you, Buonaparte, and your whole army,
forward in that style; and we will commence as soon as you
please.â

âThe offer, though so kindly made, was neither accepted
nor replied to.â
12

Buonaparte had been absent for a time on a successful
excursion against some of the small neighbouring cities. He
learnt, on his return, that Contre-amiral PÃ©rÃ©e had landed at
Jaffa three pieces of twenty-four pounds, and six of eighteen,
with munitions, which was the first siege artillery he had
409

received. He hoped with this to advance this so unexpectedly
difficult attack. On the 24th of April, the mine
destined to blow up the tower of attack was finished, and
the batteries began to batter Acre: fire was set to the mine,
but a
souterrain
, which was near the tower, diminishing the
resistance, a part of the effect was lost, and only a single side
of the tower was blown up, leaving it as difficult to climb as
before. Buonaparte, however, ordered thirty picked men to
effect a lodgment. The grenadiers gained the ruins of the
first stage, but the enemy, who occupied the superior stages,
poured upon them such showers of combustible matter as
compelled them to retreat. A second attack, made the next
day, had no better success. The French lost General
Cafarelli, one of their most distinguished leaders.

The ardour of the besieged and the besiegers was equal;
and the Turks prudently and gratefully availed themselves
of the intelligence of the English engineers, to augment their
means of defence. They every day received provisions and
ammunition from the English ships, and, on all trying
occasions, were materially assisted by bands of sailors, led by
enterprising officers.

The inhabitants, likewise, were willing and useful accessories
in carrying on the works. The French, on the contrary,
were obliged to husband the lives of their men, whose
numbers were daily lessened by the plague, that cruel scourge
of the East, and the burning sun of the climate.

Almost all the front pieces of attack of the besieged were
dismounted; to defend himself, Djezzar built a place of arms
in front of his right, and a second was established on his
left, opposite to his palace. By favour of their fire and of
the musketry, these works flanked the breach and the tower
advantageously. Four pieces of eighteen were placed
en
batterie
. On the 2nd of April, their fire was directed against
the breach, to extend the demolition of it. That evening,
twenty grenadiers were commanded to gain a lodgment
there; but the enemy, profiting by the
boyau
established in
the fosse, fusilladed the breach crosswise. Want of powder
by the 5th of April began to relax the fire of the French,
which, of course, redoubled the courage and efforts of the
besieged: they worked incessantly at the sapping, their
object being to cut off the communication of the besiegers
410

with a new mine. Buonaparte ordered four companies of
grenadiers, at ten oâclock in the evening, to throw themselves
into the outworks of Acre. The besieged were surprised,
and many were slaughtered; the French gained
possession of the works, and three of the cannon were
spiked; but the incessant, well-directed fire from the ramparts
rendered it impossible for them to stay long enough
to entirely destroy them. The garrison regained the works
immediately afterwards. At the end of two days, the Turks
succeeded in giving vent to a fresh mine, destined to blow
up the counterscarp established upon a breach of the curtain.
Two assaults given on the 5th and 6th of May were
equally fruitless. On the 7th, the French heard of the arrival
of a convoy of powder at Gaza. Buonaparte gave
orders to batter in breach the curtain on the right of the
tower of breach, and the breach itself. The curtain fell, and
offered a practicable opening. Buonaparte seized the advantage,
and ordered an immediate assault. Lannesâ division
rushed to the breach and gained possession of it; two hundred
men were already in the place; but the generalâs orders
were not executed with sufficient
ensemble
: the besieged,
issuing from their outer places of arms, filed into the fosses
right and left, and succeeded in establishing a cross-fire
upon the breach. Not having been dislodged from the
second tower dominating the left, they kept up a warm fusillade,
and launched all sorts of inflammable matter upon the
French. The troops who were scaling began to hesitate;
they stopped; indecision appeared in their ranks; and they
ceased to rush into the streets with the impetuosity they
evinced after gaining the breach. The fire of the houses, of
the barricades, of the streets, of Djezzarâs palace, which took
in front and crosswise those who descended from the breach
and those who entered the city, occasioned a retrograde
movement among the troops that had entered the place
and did not find themselves supported. They abandoned,
behind the rampart, two pieces of cannon and two mortars,
of which they had gained possession: the retrograde movement
was soon communicated to the whole column. General
Lannes succeeded in stopping it, and bringing the column
forward again. The
guides Ã  pied
, who were in reserve,
rushed to the breach, where both parties fought hand to hand,
411

with reciprocal animosity. The Turks and English regained
their position at the crown of the breach. The effect of the
first impulse, the French soldiersâ principal chance of victory,
was gone; General Lannes was severely wounded, and
General Rambaud had been killed in the city: the Turks
had had time to rally. At this moment, the besieged received
a considerable reinforcement of troops from the isle
of Rhodes: they were landed, and at once joined in the
contest: they fought from dawn till night; and all the advantage
being on the side of the besieged, the French found
it necessary to retreat.

The next day, the fire from the batteries continued.
Buonaparte repaired, at two oâclock in the morning, to the
breach, and ordered a fresh attack. The
Ã©claireurs
, the
grenadiers, and the carbiniers mounted to the breach, surprised
the enemyâs posts, and slaughtered numbers; but they
were stopped by fresh interior intrenchments, and forced to
retire. The fire from the batteries continued all the day.
At four oâclock in the afternoon, the grenadiers of the
twenty-fourth solicited and obtained the honour of mounting
first to the assault. These brave men marched coolly to the
wall; but a first, second, and third line of defence had been
established, which could not be forced without fresh dispositions.
Retreat was again sounded. The French had in
these assaults two hundred killed and five hundred wounded;
they greatly regretted the brave General Bon, who was killed
at the head of the grenadiers. This is principally the French
account of these two important days: let us hear what Sir
Sidney Smith says of them in his well-written despatch to
Lord
Nelson:â

âWe have been in one continued battle ever since the
beginning of the siege, interrupted only at short intervals by
the excessive fatigue of every individual on both sides. We
have been long anxiously looking for a reinforcement, without
which we could not expect to be able to keep the place
so long as we have. The delay in its arrival being occasioned
by Hassan Beyâs having originally had orders to join me in
Egypt, I was obliged to be very peremptory in the repetition
of my orders for him to join me here; it was not, however,
till the evening of the day before yesterday, the fifty-first
day of the siege, that his fleet of corvettes and transports
412

made its appearance. The approach of this additional
strength was the signal to Buonaparte for a most vigorous
and persevering assault, in hopes to get possession of the
town before the reinforcement to the garrison could disembark.

âThe constant fire of the besiegers was suddenly increased
tenfold; our flanking fire afloat was, as usual, plied to the
utmost, but with less effect than heretofore, as the enemy
had thrown up epaulments and traverses of sufficient thickness
to protect them from it. The guns that could be
worked to the greatest advantage were a French brass
eighteen-pounder, in the Lighthouse castle, manned from the
Theseus, under the direction of Mr. Scroder, masterâs mate;
and the last-mounted twenty-four pounder in the north
ravelin, manned from the Tigre, under the direction of Mr.
Jones, midshipman. These guns being within grape distance
of the head of the attacking column, added to the
Turkish musketry, did great execution. The Tigreâs two
sixtyeight-pound carronades, mounted on two dgermes
lying in the mole, and worked under the direction of Mr.
Bray, carpenter of the Tigre (one of the bravest and most
intelligent men I ever served with), threw shells into the
centre of this column with evident effect, and checked it
considerably. Still, however, the enemy gained ground, and
made a lodgment in the second story of the north-east tower,
the upper part being entirely battered down, and the ruins
in the ditch forming the ascent by which they mounted:
daylight showed us the French standard on the outer angle
of the tower. The fire of the besieged was much slackened
in comparison with that of the besiegers, and our flanking
fire was become of less effect, the enemy having covered
themselves in this lodgment and the approach to it by two
traverses across the ditch, which they had constructed under
the fire that had been opposed to them during the whole
night, and which were now seen, composed of sand-bags and
the bodies of their dead built in with them, their bayonets
only being visible above them. Hassan Beyâs troops were
in the boats, though, as yet, but halfway on shore. This
was a most critical point of the contest, and an effort was
necessary to preserve the place for a short time till their
arrival.

âI accordingly landed the boats at the mole, and took the
413

crews up to the breach, armed with pikes. The enthusiastic
gratitude of the Turks, men, women, and children, at the
sight of such a reinforcement at such a time, is not to be
described.

âMany fugitives returned with us to the breach, which
we found defended by a few brave Turks, whose most
destructive missile weapons were heavy stones, which, striking
the assailants on the head, overthrew the foremost down
the slope and impeded the progress of the rest. A succession,
however, ascended to the assault, the heap of ruins
between the two parties serving as a breastwork to both;
the muzzles of their muskets touching, and the spear-heads
of their standards locked. Djezzar Pasha, hearing the
English were on the breach, quitted his station, where,
according to the ancient Turkish custom, he was sitting to
reward such as should bring him the heads of the enemy,
and distributing musket-cartridges with his own hand. The
energetic old man, coming behind us, pulled us down with
violence, saying, if any harm happened to his English friends,
all was lost. This amicable contest as to who should defend
the breach, occasioned a rush of Turks to the spot, and thus
time was gained for the arrival of the first body of Hassanâs
troops. I had now to combat the pashaâs repugnance to
admitting any troops but his Albanians into the garden of
his seraglio, which had become a very important place, as
occupying the
terreplein
of the rampart. There were about
two hundred of the original thousand Albanians left alive.
This was no time for debate, and I overruled his objection by
introducing the Chifflick regiment of one thousand men, armed
with bayonets, disciplined after the European method under
Sultan Selimâs own eye, and placed by his imperial majestyâs
express command at my disposal. The garrison, animated
by the appearance of such a reinforcement, was now all on
foot; and there being consequently enough to defend the
breach, I proposed to the pasha to get rid of the object of
his jealousy, by opening his gates to let them make a sally
and take the assailants in flank. He readily complied; and
I gave directions to the colonel to get possession of the
enemyâs third parallel or nearest trench, and there fortify
himself by shifting the parapet outwards. This order being
clearly understood, the gates were opened and the Turks
414

rushed out; but they were not equal to such a movement,
and were driven back to the town with loss. Mr. Bray,
however, as usual, protected the town gate efficaciously with
grape from the sixtyeight-pounders. The sortie had this
good effect, that it obliged the enemy to expose themselves
above their parapets, so that our flanking fires brought down
numbers of them and drew their force from the breach, so
that the small number remaining on the lodgment were
killed or dispersed by our few remaining hand-grenades,
thrown by Mr. Savage, midshipman of the Theseus. The
enemy began a new breach, by an incessant fire directed to
the southward of the lodgment, every shot knocking down
whole sheets of wall, much less solid than that of the tower,
on which they had expended so much time and ammunition.
The group of generals and aides-de-camp, which the shells
from the sixtyeight-pounders had frequently dispersed, was
now reassembled on Richard CÅur de Lionâs Mount.
Buonaparte was distinguishable in the centre of a semicircle;
his gesticulations indicated a renewal of attack, and his
despatching an aide-de-camp showed that he waited only for
a reinforcement. I gave directions for Hassan Beyâs ships
to take their station in the shoal water to the southward,
and made the Tigreâs signal to weigh and join the Theseus
to the northward. A little before sunset, a massive column
appeared advancing to the breach with a solemn step. The
pashaâs idea was not to defend the breach this time, but
rather to let a certain number of the enemy in, and then
close with them according to the Turkish mode of war. The
column thus mounted the breach unmolested, and descended
from the rampart into the pashaâs garden, where, in a very
few minutes, the bravest and most advanced among them lay
headless corpses; the sabre, with the addition of a dagger in
the other hand, proving more than a match for the bayonet.
The rest retreated precipitately; and the commanding
officer, who was seen manfully encouraging his men to
mount the breach, and whom we have since learnt to be
General Lannes, was carried off wounded by a musket-shot.
General Rombaud was killed. Much confusion arose in the
town from the actual entry of the enemy, it having been impossible,
nay impolitic, to give previous information to everybody
of the mode of defence adopted, lest the enemy should
415

come to a knowledge of it by means of their numerous
spies.

âThe English uniform, which had served as a rallying-point
for the old garrison wherever it appeared, was now, in
the dusk, mistaken for French, the newly-arrived Turks not
distinguishing between one hat and another in the crowd;
and thus many a severe blow of a sabre was parried by our
officers, among which Colonel Douglas, Mr. Ives, and Mr.
Jones had nearly lost their lives as they were forcing their
way through a torrent of fugitives. Calm was restored by
the pashaâs exertions, aided by Mr. Trotte, just arrived with
Hassan-Bey; and thus the contest of twenty-five hours
ended, both parties being so fatigued as to be unable to
move.

âBuonaparte will, no doubt, renew the attack, the breach
being, as above described, perfectly practicable for fifty men
abreast; indeed the town is not, nor ever has been, defensible,
according to the rules of art; but according to every
other rule it must and shall be defended: not that it is in
itself worth defending, but we feel that it is by this small
breach Buonaparte means to march to other conquests. It
is on the issue of this contest that depends the opinion of
the multitudes of spectators on the surrounding hills, who
wait only to see how it ends, to join the victor; and with
such a reinforcement for the execution of his known projects,
Constantinople, and even Vienna, must feel the
shock.

âBe assured, my lord, the magnitude of our obligations
does but increase the energy of our efforts in the attempt
to discharge our duty; and though we may, and probably
shall be overpowered, I can venture to say that the French
army will be so much further weakened before it prevails,
as to be little able to profit by its dear-bought victory.

âI have the honour to be, &c. &c.,

â
W. Sidney Smith
.â

â
Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson.
â

Sir Sidney Smith was well aware of the nature of this
contest. Acre was of no consequence in itself; but the
opinion of the Syrians was of incalculable importance.
416

They were already so prepossessed with the irresistibility of
the French forces, that all efforts of defence had been
paralyzed. Had it not been for the stimulating influence
of British courage, Buonaparte would have met with no
opposition, and he and his generals would have been wholly
unimpeded in whatever plans of conquest, personal aggrandizement,
or political vengeance, they might have concerted.

Buonaparte was dreadfully annoyed at this check; he was,
perhaps, of all great generals on record, the one least qualified
for a siege. In the heat of his vexation he called for the
most cruel sacrifices on the part of his brave followers.

But we return to this singular siege, and still more singular
defence. The gallant antagonist of the future emperor was
fully aware of the advantage he had gained, and well knew how
to improve it. Rightly judging that the prejudice in favour
of the invincibility of the French must be considerably shaken
by the late events, and by the fatal check that was given to the
advancement of their arms, Sir Sidney wrote a circular letter
to the princes and chiefs of Mount Lebanon, and to the
shieks of the Druses, exhorting them to do their duty to
their sovereign by intercepting the supplies of the enemy.
This proceeding had all the success that might be expected.
Two ambassadors were sent to the commodore, informing
him that measures had been taken to cut off the supplies
till that time furnished to the French camp; and eighty
French prisoners, who had been captured in the defence of
their convoys, were placed at the disposal of the British.

Thus the French had scarcely a choice left but to mount
the breach. Accordingly General Kleberâs division was
ordered from the fords of the Jordan, where it had been
successfully opposed to the army of Damascus, to take its
turn in an attempt that had already cost the lives of the
flower of the French troops, with more than two-thirds of
their officers. But on the arrival of General Kleber and
his army, other employment was found for them.

In the sally before mentioned, made by the Chifflick regiment,
it had shown a want of steadiness in the presence of
the enemy, and was in consequence censured. The commandant,
Soliman Aga, being ordered by Sir Sidney Smith
to obtain possession of the enemyâs third parallel, availed
himself of this opportunity to retrieve the lost honour of
417

his regiment, and the next night carried his orders into
execution with so much ardour and resolution, that he not
only effected the service he was sent on, but established the
reputation of his corps. The third parallel was gained; but
the gallant Turk, wishing to elevate the character of his
regiment still more, attacked the second trench, but not
with the same success, as he lost some standards. He
however retained possession of the works long enough to
spike four of the guns and do them other mischief.

On Kleberâs arrival, therefore, instead of mounting the
breach, he was ordered to recover these works, which, after
a furious contest of three hours, and much loss of life, was
effected. Notwithstanding this very limited success, the
advantage evidently remained on the side of the besieged.
Indeed, the resistance displayed damped the zeal of the
French troops so seriously, that they could not be again
brought to the breach.

We gladly avail ourselves of Sir Sidney Smithâs despatch
to conclude this remarkable siege.

âAfter this failure the French grenadiers absolutely
refused to mount the breach any more over the putrid
bodies of their unburied companions, sacrificed in former
attacks by Buonaparteâs impatience and precipitation, which
led him to commit such palpable errors as even seamen
could take advantage of. He seemed to have no principle
of action but that of pressing forward; and appeared to
stick at nothing to obtain the object of his ambition,
although it must be evident to everybody else, that even if
he had succeeded in taking the town, the fire of the shipping
must drive him out of it again in a short time: however,
the knowledge the garrison had of the inhuman massacre at
Jaffa rendered them desperate in their personal defence.
Two attempts to assassinate me in the town having failed,
recourse was had to a most flagrant breach of the laws of
honour and war. A flag of truce was sent into the town by
the hand of an Arab dervish, with a letter to the pasha,
proposing a cessation of arms, for the purpose of burying
the dead bodies, the stench from which became intolerable.
It was natural we should gladly listen to this proposition,
and that we should consequently be off our guard during
the conference. While the answer was under consideration,
418

a volley of shot and shells on a sudden announced an assault,
which, however, the garrison was ready to receive; and the
assailants only contributed to increase the number of the
dead bodies in question, to the eternal disgrace of the
general who thus disloyally sacrificed them. Subordination
was now at an end; and all hopes of success having vanished,
the enemy had no alternative left but a precipitate retreat,
which was put in execution in the night between the 20th
and 21st instant. The battering-train of artillery (except
the carriages, which were burnt) is now in our hands,
amounting to twenty-three pieces. The howitzers and
medium twelve-pounders, originally conveyed by land with
much difficulty, and successfully employed to make the first
breach, were embarked in the country vessels at Jaffa, to be
conveyed coastwise, together with the worst among the two
thousand wounded, which embarrassed the march of the
army. This operation was to be expected; I took care,
therefore, to be between Jaffa and Damietta before the
French could get as far as the former place. The vessels
being turned to sea without seamen to navigate them, and
the wounded being in want of every necessary, even water
and provisions, they steered straight to his majestyâs ships,
in full confidence of receiving the succours of humanity; in
which they were not disappointed. I have sent them on to
Damietta, where they will receive such further aid as their
situation requires, and which it was out of my power to give to
so many. Their expressions of gratitude to us were mingled
with execrations on the name of their general, who had,
as they said, exposed them to peril unnecessarily. Two
thousand cavalry are just despatched to harass the French
rear, and I am in hopes to overtake their van in time to
profit by their disorder.â

A perusal of this siege redounds very little to the
honour of the great French general: he was beaten fairly
at every point, and on every occasion, by a seaman. Sir
Sidney was never taken by surprise or defeated in open
fight. The sailor joined to the ardour characteristic of
his profession, a coolness and foresight worthy of the
greatest captain; the French general exhibited none of
the talents of a superior tactician; his conduct was
impetuous and headstrong; he was evidently annoyed at
419

receiving a check where he did not expect it, and was
weak enough to show it by his actions: he was irritated
by the obstacle, but took the worst possible measures to
remove it.

Buonaparte told OâMeara, at St. Helena: âSir Sidney
dispersed proclamations among the troops, which certainly
shook some of them; and I, in consequence, published an
order stating that he was
mad
, and forbidding all communication
with him. Some days after he sent, by a lieutenant
or midshipman, a flag of truce, with a challenge to meet me
at some place which he pointed out, in order to fight a duel.
I laughed at this, and sent back intimation that when he
sent Marlborough to fight me, I would meet him. Notwithstanding
this, I like the character of the man.â This
little anecdote is quite characteristic of Buonaparte and
Sir Sidney; the wild chivalry of the sailor being not more
striking than the
fanfaronnade
of the future emperor. As
we have done frequently before, we will enliven our account
of âperils iâ the deadly breachâ with an anecdote. The following
is from the âMemoirs of Sir Sidney Smith.â

âThe seamen of the squadron took each their turn for
the military service on the walls of Acre. One of them had
observed, in his spell ashore, the body of a French general,
splendid in his uniform, that lay exposed in the very centre of
the ditch. This dwelt on the mind of the honest, thoughâthe
truth must be toldâsomewhat obtuse-minded tar. Indeed he
had never shown himself remarkable for either intellect or
activity, and held no higher office in the ship than a waister.
Yet, by some unexplained mental process, the fate and the
unburied corpse of the French general had fixed themselves
so strongly in his imagination, that he was determined, at
all risks, to give his glittering dead opponent the rites of
sepulture. The next day, though out of his turn, he asked
and obtained permission to take his spell on the walls.
Nothing divided the hostile intrenchments but this same
ditch, and so closely placed were the foes to each other, that
a moderate whisper could be easily heard from one embankment
to the other. Nothing appeared above these embankments
but a serried line of bayonets; for if a hat, or a head,
or anything tangible appeared on either side, it was saluted
with a volley of perforating-balls. It was about noon, and
420

the respective hostile lines were preserving a dead silence,
anxiously watching for the opportunity of a shot at each
other. Our seaman, who, without informing any one of his
intention, had provided himself with a spade and pickaxe,
suddenly broke the ominous silence by shouting out, in a
stentorian voice, âMounsiers, a-hoy! âvast heaving there a
bit, will ye? and belay over all with your poppers for a
spell.â And then he showed his broad unmeaning face over
the lines. Two hundred muskets were immediately pointed
at him; but seeing him with only the implements of digging,
and not exactly understanding his demand for a parley, the
French forbore to fire. Jack very leisurely then scrambled
over the intrenchment into the ditch, the muzzles of the
enemyâs muskets still following his every motion. All this
did not the least disturb his
sang-froid
; but going up to
the French general, he took his measure in quite a businesslike
manner, and dug a very decent grave alongside the
defunct. When this was finished, shaking what was so
lately a French general very cordially and affectionately by
the hand, he reverently placed him in his impromptu grave,
then shovelled the earth upon and made all smooth above
him. When all was properly completed, he made his best
sailorâs bow and footscrape to the French, shouldered his implements
of burial, and climbed over into his own quarters
with the same imperturbability that had marked his previous
appearance. This he did amidst the cheers of both
parties.

âNow our friend the waister seemed to think he had
done nothing extraordinary, and only remarked that he
should sleep well. A few days after, another gaudily-decorated
French general came on board the Tigre, on some
matters of negotiation, which, when completed, he anxiously
desired to see the interrer of his late comrade. The meeting
took place, and Jack was highly praised for his heroism in
a long speech, not one word of which, though interpreted to
him, could he comprehend. Money was then offered him,
which at first he did not like to take; but he at length
satisfied his scruples by telling the French officer he should
be happy to do the same thing for him as he had done for
his brother generalâfor nothing. The French general
begged to be excused; and thus ended the interview.â

DOVER.

A.D. 1216.

We
only introduce this little siege on account of a particular
circumstance attending it. Whilst the English invasions
of France have been more than one, and the sieges
and captures of her cities numerous, Dover we believe to be
the only English city that has been besieged by the French.
We of course except the Conquest, because we do not
consider William of Normandy a Frenchman at all: the
Normans, or Northmen, were a race of the most successful
adventurers of that age, and, not much more than a hundred
years before their expedition to England, had gained, in an
almost similar manner, an establishment in a remote province
of France.

The English barons, disgusted with the levity and tyranny
of John, very inconsiderately offered the crown of England
to Louis, son of Philip Augustus, and heir to the kingdom
of France. This prince, who did not want for spirit, in
spite of the anathemas of the court of Rome, under the
protection of which the weak John had placed himself,
embarked with an army on board a fleet of seven hundred
vessels, landed at Sandwich, and took possession of the
county of Kent, with the exception of Dover. This place
was well provided against an attack, and was governed by
Hubert du Bourg, an intrepid and skilful soldier. Louis
being unable to overcome his firm resistance, had recourse to
more seductive advances, offering him a considerable bribe;
but to his honour, Du Bourg repulsed it more indignantly
and quite as firmly as he had resisted his arms. The French
were obliged to raise the siege.

422

âThis England never did (nor never shall)

Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror.â

BAGDAD.

A.D. 1638.

Amurath
IV. had twice besieged Bagdad,âin 1625 and
1634; twice his generals had been compelled disgracefully
to raise the siege, when the sultan, in 1638, determined to
punish a city which had so roused his anger. During
thirty days his artillery thundered against its ramparts.
Cannon, steel, and fire spread desolation within the walls;
assault upon assault was given. The grand seignor
appeared, scimitar in hand, striking down such of his own
men as even advanced slowly. He killed the vizier
Mahommed, who appeared to him not sufficiently eager to
court danger. At length the city was carried. Thirty
thousand unarmed Persians were slaughtered before the
eyes of the cruel conqueror. This savage prince was about
to exterminate all the inhabitants of Bagdad, when a
musician threw himself at his feet, and spoke as follows:
âSublime emperor! will you permit so divine an art as
that of music to perish this day with me, with Schah-Culi,
your slave? Ah! preserve, by preserving me, a divine art
of which I have not yet discovered all the beauties.â This
speech made the sultan laugh, and casting a favourable look
upon the artist, he permitted him to prove his talents.
Schah-Culi immediately took up a
scheydor
, a kind of six-stringed
harp, and adapting his voice to the sounds of that
instrument, he sang the tragic capture of Bagdad and the
triumph of Amurath. The sultan at first appeared astonished;
fury was depicted in his countenance: he fancied himself
amidst his warriors, animating the combatants, and leading
them to victory. All at once the artist touched another
chord: by plaintive and affecting sounds he subdued the
heart of the implacable conqueror: the haughty sultan
melted into tears; his stern heart was, for the first time,
accessible to pity: he shudders at the barbarous orders he
423

had given to immolate so many thousand victims; he
revokes them, and puts a stop to the carnage. Overcome
by the charms of music, he restored liberty to the compatriots
of Schah-Culi, attached the musician to his personal
service, and loaded him with benefits.

CASSEL.

A.D. 1528.

Philip
of Valois, scarcely seated on his own throne,
turned his arms towards Flanders, to assist the count in
subduing his rebellious subjects. His noble army consisted
of thirty thousand men, among whom were fourteen thousand
gendarmes. Philip marched straight towards the city of
Cassel, and laid siege to it. The rebel army, much less
numerous than the French, was composed entirely of
infantry: they were fishermen, peasants, and artisans. A
small dealer in fish, named Colin Zannequin, was at their
head, a bold, daring man, in whom audacity and cunning
made up for deficiency in military experience. Such was
the singular champion opposed to the king of France; such
were the troops destined to contend with the proudest
nobility of Europe: and this ignoble assemblage was very
near destroying the haughty battalions which held them in
rather too much contempt. Never was any army more
determined or more insolent in its bearing than these newly-made
soldiers, encamped and intrenched within sight of
Cassel, upon an eminence very difficult of access. They had
the audacity to hoist upon one of the towers of the city a kind
of standard, upon which was painted a cock, with this

inscription:â

âQuand ce coq chantÃ© aura,

Le roi Cassel conquÃ©rera.â

[When this cock shall have crowed, the king shall conquer Cassel.]

Zannequin conceived a project which might, if successful,
have proved of great importance. In his character of a
dealer in fish, he went every day, with reckless confidence,
424

to exercise his trade in the royal camp. He sold his fish
at a moderate price, in order to get a footing, and afford
him an opportunity of seeing what was going on. He
found that they sat a long time at table, that they gambled
a great deal, that they danced, and they slept in the afternoon.
In short, such negligent guard appeared to be kept,
that the audacious Fleming conceived the design of carrying
off the king and all his quarter. On the 23rd of August,
1528, about two oâclock in the afternoon, at the time when
he knew the French were taking their daily nap, he divided
his troops into three bodies, ordered one to march quietly
to the quarter of the king of Bohemia, the second to advance
in silence against the
battle
commanded by the count of
Hainault, whilst he placed himself at the head of the third.
He entered the camp without shouting the war-cry, which
was at that time always done before commencing a battle,
and penetrated nearly to the kingâs tent, where too good a
watch was not kept. When they appeared, they were supposed
to be a reinforcement just arrived, and Renaud Delor,
a noble cavalier, came towards them with a smile, saying it
was not polite to disturb their friendsâ slumbers. He was
answered by a javelin through his heart. This proved the
signal for fight. The Flemings drew their swords and
slaughtered all they met. The alarm was soon spread
through the French camp; loud cries announced the danger,
and all flew to arms. The king was roused by a Dominican,
his confessor. He laughed at the worthy father, telling him
that fear disturbed his imagination; but Miles de Noyer,
who bore the oriflamme, soon rushed in, confirming the
news, and entreating the king to arm. But there was neither
squire nor knight to assist his majesty, and the duty was
performed by the clerks of his chapel. He sprang upon his
war-horse, and marched straight against the assailants.
Miles de Noyer stopped him, advising him to wait till his
troops should be sufficiently increased to turn the Flemings,
and afterwards take them in flank. This brave and prudent
knight then raised the royal standard on a point from which
it could be seen at a great distance. At this signal, the
cavalry drew up around their prince. The Flemings were
surrounded, broken, and then cut to pieces. Of sixteen
thousand men, who composed this army, not one gave ground,
425

but not one escaped. The French lost but few in the action:
armour was then very complete, and the ill-protected Flemings
had but little chance against the French chivalry. The
other rebel battalions dispersed immediately. Cassel was
taken, razed to the ground, and reduced to ashes. After
having restored peace, Philip returned to his own dominions,
saying to the count of Flanders: âBe more prudent and
more humane, and you will have fewer rebels.â This was
certainly a well-merited reproof; but it came very ill from
such a man as Philip of Valois.

ROMORANTIN.

A.D. 1356.

However
insignificant in itself, this siege commands a
place in our record, as being the first in which cannon were
employed. Our countryâs favourite hero, the Black Prince,
having entered Sologne with hostile intentions, laid siege to
Romorantin. The English were repulsed in their first
assault; but were not disheartened. They continued their
attacks, but still in vain, till some engineers advised an experiment
to be made with the newly-discovered gunpowder.
They planted some batteries of cannon so as to enable them
to throw into the place a number of inflammable missiles.
By this means they set fire to some buildings in the lower
court of the castle. The conflagration soon extended to one
of the towers. The besieged were then constrained to surrender
to the conqueror, and were made prisoners of war.
This is the first time that mention is made in history of
artillery being employed for besieging places. It was ten
years after the battle of Crecy, at which, it is said, cannon
were first used in the field.

426

LA ROCHELLE.

A.D. 1372.

The
English having made themselves masters of La
Rochelle, the inhabitants of that important city did not
endure the yoke without impatience. They were only
restrained by their fear of the military who garrisoned the
castle, which dominated over both the port and the city.
Jean Candorier, mayor of La Rochelle, proposed gaining
possession of it by a stratagem. âWe shall easily do so,
and to our honour,â said he, âfor Philip Monsel (the English
commander) is not over cunning.â Candorier invited
Monsel to dine with him, and took the opportunity of showing
him an order which desired him, in his quality of mayor,
to review the garrison and the armed burgesses. This order
was a fiction. The English commander, like most warriors
of the time, could neither read nor write. Candorier showed
the order so openly, and read it with a confidence that might
have imposed upon any one. On the day appointed for the
review, Monsel marched all his garrison out of the castle,
with the exception of about twelve men. Scarcely had he
passed the fortifications, than a body of armed citizens, placed
in ambuscade behind an old wall, got between him and the
citadel, whilst a body of two hundred men met him, in good
order, in front. The English, finding themselves surrounded,
yielded at discretion. The inhabitants then summoned the
few left in the citadel to place it immediately in their power.
Their number was so small that they complied without hesitation.
Charles V. rewarded the Rochellois with great
privileges.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1573.

During the various religious wars in France, the Reformers
had no more formidable rampart or place of refuge than La
Rochelle. Readers not well acquainted with French history,
427

and accustomed to look upon France as one kingdom ruled
by a despotic king, can form no idea of the real state of that
country quite up to the middle of the reign of Louis XIV.
In all the provinces of France there were strongly fortified
cities, mostly attached to the governments of these provinces.
It was the object of princes of the blood and of the high
nobles to obtain a government; after that, upon receiving
offence at court, or taking umbrage at even an imaginary
insult, they would retire to their fortified city, and set even
royalty at defiance. La Rochelle, Sedan, and some other
cities, were the great rallying-points of the Huguenots, and,
in them, the power of the monarchs was merely nominal.
In 1573, they were besieged in La Rochelle by the duke of
Anjou, afterwards the infamous Henry III., the most inveterate
enemy they ever had to encounter. The massacre
of St. Bartholomew has fixed an indelible stain upon the
reign of Charles IX.; but more of its horrors were due to
this, his successor, than to him. Henry of Anjou was more
after Catherine de Mediciâs own heart than her second son
Charles. This prince could boast of having in his army the
flower of the French nobility. In the course of eight months
they gave nine general assaults, and formed more than
twenty useless attacks. An English fleet endeavoured to
throw succours into the city, but it was repulsed, and forced
to renounce the enterprise. The Rochellois, notwithstanding,
continued to signalize their valour by the most intrepid
resistance. The duke of Anjou, returning from visiting a
mine, passed by a place within gun-shot of the city. A
soldier, recognising him, took a deliberate aim at him, and
would have ridded the world of a monster, but for the intervention
of his squire, Hubert Devins, who, seeing the danger
of the prince, rushed forward, and received the ball instead
of him. He was cured of his wound, and lived a long time
to enjoy the glory of such an action. Upon the duke being
chosen king of Poland, a general assault was given; but it
succeeded no better than its predecessors. The prince, who
had already lost more than twenty-four thousand men, then
resolved to terminate the siege by making peace. The
conduct of the royalists during the siege was the height of
extravagance, injustice, and ferocity: âThey sported there
with the lives of men,â says Matthieu the historian; âand I
428

have heard those say who were near the duke of Anjou,
that to pass away the time, when they were at a loss what to
do, they sent soldiers to the breach.â It is not to be wondered
at that an enterprise so conducted should have had a
bad end, and that the Rochellois, pretending to submit, to
save the honour of the court, should have really remained
masters of their city. Near the counterscarp, there was a
mill, called Labrande, of which Captain Normand had
obtained the proprietorship, upon condition that he should
have it guarded. He thought at first of fortifying it; but
finding he could not put it in a state of defence, he satisfied
himself with keeping a few soldiers in it in the daytime, who
retired at night, with the exception of one sentinel. Strozzi,
one of the Catholic generals, who fancied he could derive
some advantage from this mill, fixed upon a moonlight night
to attack it with a detachment and two culverins. A soldier
from the Isle of RhÃ©, named Barbot, sole defender of this
bad post, stood his ground, fired, with incredible celerity,
many arquebuse-shots at the assailants, and, by varying the
inflexions of his voice, made them believe that he had a considerable
number of comrades. Captain Normand kept
encouraging him from the top of a cavalier, speaking as if
there were an entire company in the mill, and telling them
to hold out bravely, and they should soon have assistance.
Barbotâs artillery being exhausted, he came forward and
demanded quarter for himself and his comrades; and, the
defence having been so respectable, it was granted. He
immediately laid down his arms, and revealed the whole garrison
in his own person. Strozzi, enraged at what he ought
to have thought heroic, wanted to have him hung for his
act of gallantry; but Biron, who was more moderate, satisfied
himself with condemning him to the galleys. These
men prided themselves upon fighting in a religious cause,
and in civilized times: the pagans of old Greece or Rome
would not have punished such a man at all. The soldier
was fortunate enough to escape by flight a punishment he
did not deserve.

429

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1627.

We come now to the most important siege of La Rochelle,
a siege which is likewise the great event of the life of so
remarkable a man as the Cardinal de Richelieu. Of all the
actions of this able, selfish, cruel minister, his policy in subduing
the Huguenots is, perhaps, the most defensible. The
Huguenots were not only what they pretended to be, a religious
party,âthey were a political party; and many men
carried on their schemes of rebellion or aggrandizement
under the shadow of their standard, who cared nothing for
religion of any kind. That this is the case in all religious
wars we are willing to admit, but it was particularly so in
France in the reign of Louis XIII. Louis himself was
superstitious enough; as most weak men are; but it would
have puzzled the Sorbonne itself to have told what was the

heart religion
of Louisâ minister.

Cardinal de Richelieu, who governed France and its king,
being very desirous to signalize his ministry by the conquest
of La Rochelle, ordered the siege of it to be prepared. In
the year 1627, an army of twenty-three thousand men, with
Louis XIII. at their head, presented itself before this last
asylum of the Protestants. The warlike cardinal conducted
all the operations in the name of the king. The city was
vast, well fortified, well situated, provided with numerous
artillery, full of munitions of all kinds, and defended by
inhabitants animated by religious zeal. They elected as
mayor, governor, and general of their city, Jean Guiton, a
man of great firmness and valour. He was scarcely clothed
with these important but perilous dignities, than he assembled
the inhabitants, and drawing a poniard, said: âI will
be your mayor, since you insist upon my being so, but only
upon condition that I may be permitted to plunge this poniard
into the heart of the first man who shall speak of surrendering.
I consent that it shall be employed in the same
manner upon me, if I should propose to capitulate; and I
require that this poniard shall remain for that purpose upon
the table of the chamber in which we assemble.â Richelieu
in the mean time continued his works for the blockade of
the place. A circumvallation of three leagues was formed,
protected by thirteen forts, flanked with redoubts, and bristling
430

with artillery. But the great object was to close the ports,
in order to exclude succour. Piles were sunk to embarrass
the entrance; a chain of immense force was stretched across
the mouth: but all these means proved useless. At length
the cardinal resolved to make a dyke. We beg our readers
to remember that whenever a grand national operation is
successful, the king or minister under whom it is effected
is almost sure to have the credit of it, although, perhaps,
perfectly innocent of any idea of the kind. This, we have
reason to believe, was the fact with respect to Richelieu and
his famous dyke, which might have been planned by any
soldier in the army. It will not bear a comparison with
Alexanderâs dyke at the siege of Tyre. Everybody, as is
usual in such cases, exclaimed against the project as absurd.
Louis MÃ©tÃ©zeau and Jean Tiriot alone ventured to undertake
the execution of it, and they were kindly set down by
their contemporaries as madmen. It was necessary to form
a canal of seven hundred and forty toises in width, in a place
where the current of the sea was very strong. Long posts
were sunk in the sea, at twelve feet distance from each
other, from the point of Coreille to Fort Louis: other posts,
quite as strong, connected them crosswise. Immense dry
stones were thrown into the intervals, to which the slime
and mud acted as cement. This dyke was so elevated, that
in the highest tides the soldiers were dry upon it; its thickness
was proof against cannon. It was, towards the bottom,
about twelve toises wide, and only about four at the top, so
that it resembled a glacis. At each extremity a fort was
built; an opening was left in the middle to allow passage
for the tides; but, in order to prevent the enemyâs vessels
from entering by this opening, forty vessels, filled with hewn
stones, were sunk, and a vast number of huge piles were
driven. This great and wonderful work, which required the
incessant labour of six months, was defended by several
batteries erected on firm ground, and by two hundred vessels
of all sizes, well armed, which lined the shore. The
advantage of this dyke was soon perceived: La Rochelle,
which till then had received all its munitions and provisions
by sea, became destitute in a very short time. The English
made two attempts to deliver or revictual the place, but were
obliged to renounce their undertaking. After a yearâs
431

blockade, the Rochellois, for some time reduced to subsist
upon grass, herbs, and shell-fish, began to be carried off in
great numbers by famine. Twelve thousand men had
already perished; whole houses were filled with dead bodies.
One day the mayor met a person attenuated by famine.
âHe has but one breath of life left,â said some one to him.
âAre you surprised at that?â replied he; âyou and I
must soon come to that, if we are not relieved.â âBut,â
added another, âhunger carries off so many daily, that we
shall soon have no inhabitants left.â âWell,â rejoined the
brave old man, ânever mind, so long as there is one left to
keep the gates shut.â Such was what Catholic historians
call the
obstinacy
, and Protestant ones the
firmness
, of the
commander of the Rochellois and his soldiers. Although
scarcely able to carry their muskets, they preferred death to
surrendering. They really had âbut one breath of life
left,â when, on the 28th of October, 1628, they were compelled
to capitulate. The royal troops took possession on
the 30th, and on the 1st of November the king made his
public entrance. The fortifications were demolished, the
ditches filled up, the inhabitants disarmed and made taxable;

echevinage
and the corporation of the city were abolished
for ever. For nearly two hundred years, La Rochelle
had scarcely acknowledged any sovereigns but its magistrates.
This conquest cost Louis forty millions of francs,
but not so many lives as might have been expected.

It is impossible to give an account of the siege of La
Rochelle in a work like this, proportioned to the means at
command; with half what we have at hand, we could compose
a volume. But this very abundance removes the
necessity for our going into detail: there are so many
interesting accounts of it before the public, that a longer one
from us is not required. Whilst Richelieu, Buckingham,
and Louis XIII.; whilst the religious wars between Catholics
and Huguenots, shall occupyâwe were going to say
stain
âthe
page of history, the siege of La Rochelle must be familiar
to most readers.

432

CASSOVIA.

A.D. 1389.

The
city of Cassovia, in Lower Hungary, was often the
theatre of the exploits of the Germans and the Turks, after
the entrance of the latter into Europe. In 1389, Amurath I.
conquered in these plains the Hungarians, the Wallachians,
the Dalmatians, and the Triballian confederates. After a
long and sanguinary battle, the sultan went to survey the
dead, and walked over the field of carnage. When he had
for some time contemplated these sad trophies of his successââI
am astonished,â said he to his grand vizier, who
accompanied him, âto see only young beardless men among
these dead, and not one old man.â

âIt is that that has given us the victory,â replied the
vizier; âyouth only listens to the wild fire which animates it,
and comes to perish at your feet; old age is more tranquil
and prudent.â

âBut that which still more surprises me,â said the grand
seignor, âis, that I have triumphed. I dreamt last night
that an unknown enemyâs hand pierced my side. Nevertheless,
thanks to God! thanks to His Prophet! I triumph,
and I live!â

He had scarcely pronounced these words when a Triballian
soldier, concealed among the dead, sprang up in a rage and
plunged his dagger into the sultanâs bowels. The murderer
was instantly cut to pieces. The proud sultan saw his
dream accomplished: a conqueror in thirty battles. He
expired two hours after, from the stroke of this assassin.

433

TROYES.

A.D. 1429.

The
Maid of Orleans had announced that her mission was
confined to two objects,âthe deliverance of Orleans and the
consecration of the king at Reims. After having gloriously
fulfilled her first promise, she employed the ascendancy she
had acquired to execute the second. Although the city of
Reims, and all the country from Chinon, where the king
then resided, was in the power of the English, the French
set forward on their march, with an army of twelve thousand
men. All the cities in their route opened their gates to
them, with the exception of Troyes, which endeavoured to
arrest their progress. A council of war being called, Joan
confidently assured them that, within three days, the king
should be received in Troyes.

JOAN OF ARC ADDRESSING THE KING.

âSay seven days, Joan,â cried the archbishop of Reims,
âsay seven, Joan; and we shall be right glad to see your
prediction fulfilled.â

âBefore three days are over,â exclaimed the Maid, âI
tell you the king will be master of Troyes.â

They prepared for the attack. Joan appeared before the
ramparts, advanced to the edge of the fosses, planted her
banner, and called aloud for fascines to fill them up. Terror
instantly seized the besieged; they believed their city taken,
although there was yet no breach. They capitulated; and
Charles entered triumphantly into that city where, eight
years before, his ruin had been contemplated by excluding
him from the throne. After the reduction of Troyes, Reims
was eager to receive the monarch, who repaired thither on
the 27th of July, 1429, and was consecrated the next day.

When this august ceremony was completed, Joan advanced
towards the king, with the tears streaming from her eyes,
and throwing herself at his feet, held his knees embraced
for some time; then, checking her emotion, she said,ââAt
434

last, gentle king, I have fulfilled the pleasure of God, who
willed that you should come to Reims to receive your worthy
consecration, by showing that you are king, and are he to
whom the kingdom belongs.â

She then supplicated him to permit her to return to her
native village; but she was still too useful to him to allow
her to depart: he entreated her, he even forced her to
continue her services. She yielded to his commands, and
experienced nothing but misfortunes afterwards.

BELGRADE.

A.D. 1439.

At
the confluence of the Danube and the Save stands the
city of Belgrade, the capital of Servia; its advantageous
situation upon a hill, the excellence of its port, the strength
of its castles, the soundness of its ramparts, caused it for a
long time to be considered one of the best bulwarks of
Hungary against Turkey; whilst its position and its wealth
made it a continual object of desire for the Ottoman
monarchs. The first sultan who attacked it was Amurath II.
Followed by the flower of his armies, he crossed the Danube
in 1439, halted before Belgrade, and thundered against it,
night and day, from cannons throwing balls of a hundred
pounds weight. In the first attacks the grand seignor battered
down a great part of the fortifications, but nothing
could intimidate the inhabitants, who were resolved to bury
themselves under the ruins of their city rather than surrender;
they presented themselves firmly at every breach,
and repulsed the Mussulmans with arquebuses and arrows.
For several days the Turks did not dare to approach the
ramparts; but at length one of their best captains having
placed himself at the head of the troops, succeeded in
gaining the edge of the ditch; from this advantageous position
he drove in the besieged, pursued them through the
breach, and gave a vigorous assault; the Turks spread themselves
through the city, and believed themselves masters.
But all at once the inhabitants rallied in despair, fell upon
435

the Turks close-handed, and killed the greater part of them.
Discouraged by this reverse, Amurath raised the siege and
returned to his own dominions.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1455.

Sixteen years after, Mahomet II. was anxious to crown
his exploits by the capture of Belgrade; he invested it by
land with an army of four hundred thousand men, at the
same time that his fleet blockaded it upon the Danube.
Ladislaus, king of Hungary, was encamped on the other
side of the river with a numerous army. Being convinced
that he should lose Belgrade if he did not in some way get
rid of the Turkish galleys, he embarked the
Ã©lite
of his
troops on a vast number of large boats, and fell upon the
Turks with such fury that he took twenty of their ships,
sunk others, and put the rest to flight. This victory
reopened his communication with Belgrade, and he sent in
the celebrated John Corvin, known under the name of
Huniades. This general was seconded by John Capestran,
a Cordelier, sent into Hungary by the Pope, to preach a
crusade. This monk appeared at the head of all the sorties,
a crucifix in his hand, inducing the warriors to perish rather
than give way, by constantly displaying to them the crown
of martyrdom suspended over their heads, if they fell by the
hands of the infidels. His words and example destroyed all
fear, and the troops he led always returned victorious. But
the Mussulman artillery had made a large breach; Mahomet
commanded an assault, led his troops to the edge of the
ditch, carried it, and rushed into the city without meeting
with much resistance. Thus were both parties situated,
just as in the former siege. This calm was a
ruse
of
Huniades. To surprise the Ottomans in the midst of their
fancied triumph, he drew up his troops upon a retired part
of the city; at the first sound of the trumpet the garrison
of the citadel had orders to join those who, by his direction,
had abandoned the breach. The signal was given, and the
Hungarians poured from all quarters. The Turks, attacked
in front, in rear, in flank, knew not which way to turn;
some perished in their astonishment, without offering any
defence; others precipitated themselves into the ditches,
436

and a small number succeeded in escaping through the
breach. In vain Mahomet endeavoured to rally them; his
obstinate valour was constrained to give way; the conqueror
of Constantinople was forced to raise the siege of Belgrade
shamefully, after losing an eye and his noble army.
Huniades survived this triumph but a short time; he
quickly died of his wounds.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1521.

So many useless efforts we might think would have for
ever discouraged the haughty Ottomans; but the more
necessary for them the conquest of Belgrade became, the
more it excited their ambition. Soliman II. once more
directed the Turkish arms against the city, in 1521; he at
first had it blockaded by his generals, and then repaired to
the scene of action, to animate his troops by his presence.
During six weeks the walls were mined, a continual fire of
artillery was kept up, and every day furious assaults were
given. At length the exhausted garrison was forced to
surrender, and on the 20th of August, 1521, Belgrade became
a Turkish city.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1688.

The Porte held peaceable possession of Belgrade for nearly
two hundred years, when the elector of Bavaria, who had
become general of the Hungarian armies under the emperor
Leopold, began by beating the Turks, who disputed the
passage of the Save with him, and pursued them up to the
walls of Belgrade, to which place he laid siege on the 30th
of July, 1688. After a constant cannonade of twenty-five
days, the walls were opened in several places, and the commander
was summoned to surrender. Upon his refusal,
the signal for a general assault was given, at six oâclock in
the morning of the 6th of September, and five different
breaches were attacked at the same time. At half-past ten
all the corps rallied to the cry of Emmanuel! (God is with
us); the Germans fell upon the Turks with such fury, that
the latter gave way and retreated before them. The combat
was terrible; the whole garrison, composed of nine thousand
437

determined and warlike men, united their efforts to check
the progress of the Christians; those who had fled, rallied
upon the breaches and fought with desperation. The Imperialists
began to waver, and yielded the victory step by step.
The elector perceiving this, flew to their head, followed by
Prince Eugene, sword in hand: âMy children, follow us!â
shouted the elector, âwe must conquer or die!â The
Germans return to the fight; Eugene mounts first to the
breach, at the head of the bravest. A Janissary splits his
helmet with a stroke of his sabre; the prince turns round
calmly, runs his enemy through, and resumes the fight.
The garrison is driven from the ramparts, and the assailants
penetrate into the city; the Turks endeavour to retreat to
the castle, but in great confusion; the Germans, who are
pursuing them, enter with them. The combat rages with
more fury than ever; the elector is wounded by an arrow in
the cheek. Danger redoubles his courage; no enemy can
stand against him, and soon his victory is complete. Blood
inundates Belgrade; neither age nor sex is respected; the
garrison is put to the sword; five thousand Janissaries
become the victims of the angry conqueror.âThe Germans
lost about four thousand men, but the army found motives
for consolation in an immense booty.

In this siege we see a prince, who was to become one of
the greatest generals the world has known, displaying the
character of a cool and brave swordsman. Eugene did not
flesh his maiden sword in this siege, but it took place early
in his career.

Voltaire claims Eugene as a Frenchman, although his
father, the count de Soissons, was the son of Charles
Emanuel, duke of Savoy, and his mother was an Italian,
one of the notorious nieces of Cardinal Mazarin. But as
he was born in Paris in 1663, and his father was settled in
France, we suppose we must yield the honour to that
country. But France set very little store by him in his
youth: he was first known as the Chevalier de Cavignan;
he next assumed
le petit collet
, and was styled the
AbbÃ© de
Savoie
. It is said that he asked the king for a regiment,
and that Louisâ refusal was accompanied with reproaches.
Being unable to succeed in his darling view in France, he
went to serve the emperor against the Turks, in 1683. The
438

two princes de Conti joined him in 1685. Louis XIV. then
commanded them all to return; but the AbbÃ© de Savoie was
the only one who refused to do so, simply saying he had
renounced France. When the king heard this, he said to
his courtiers, âDonât you think I have made a great loss?â
And the courtiers replied that the AbbÃ© de Savoie would
always be a wild fellow, incapable of anything. They
judged him by some youthful extravagances, which should
rarely be taken as proofs of what a man may be. Voltaireâs
character of him is so just, that we cannot refrain from
repeating it. âThis prince, too much despised by the court
of France, was born with the qualities which make a hero
in war, and a great man in peace; a lofty and just mind,
possessed of necessary courage both in the field and in the
cabinet. He committed faults, as what generals have not?
but they were concealed by the number of his great actions.
He shook the grandeur of Louis XIV. and the power of
the Ottoman; he governed the empire; and, in the course
of his victories and his ministry, showed an equal contempt
for pomp and wealth. He even cultivated letters, and protected
them at the court of Vienna, as much as was in his
power.â

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1690.

This famous conquest spread joy throughout the empire;
but scarcely had Leopold taken possession of Belgrade than
it was torn from him again. The grand vizier, Mustapha
Coprogli, presented himself before that city with an army,
which its valour, its zeal, and its exploits had rendered
formidable: he commenced by blockading it. Learning
that the Imperialists were coming to its aid, he opened the
trenches with half of his army, and destined the other to
dispute the passage of the Save with the Germans: this
strategic position was very critical. The grand vizier,
uncertain of success, awaited some event capable of forwarding
his plans. For eight days the artillery had thundered
against the place, without any considerable effect,
when a bomb fell upon a tower which served as a powder-magazine,
and blew it up, together with all the neighbouring
houses, and part of the walls. The Turks immediately
exclaimed that God had declared himself by this miracle;
439

and no longer doubting of his assistance, they flew to the
breach before the garrison had had time to repair the
damage. Although surprised, they resisted a long time
with great valour; but overwhelmed by numbers, having
killed many Turks, the garrison retired on the 8th of
October, by the Danube, to the amount of seven or eight
hundred men, commanded by General DâOspremont and the
duke de Croi. Six thousand soldiers, who could not make
their escape, were massacred by the Turks; most of the
inhabitants shared the same fate, and the barbarians did not
discontinue their cruelty till wearied with slaughter.

This disgrace astonished the court of Vienna, without
depriving it of hope; the duke de Croi appeared suddenly,
in 1694, under the walls of Belgrade, from which place the
Turkish army was absent. His batteries were placed in a
short time; his artillery and mines were so vigorously
worked, that in eight days he had reduced all the advanced
works to ashes, when the grand vizier made his appearance
with a powerful army; the siege was raised perforce, and
the conquest was reserved for Prince Eugene.

SIXTH SIEGE, A.D. 1717.

On the 8th of June, Prince Eugene, who had become the
terror of Europe and Asia by a series of triumphs, approached
Belgrade with an army of a hundred and fifty
thousand men. Several French princes accompanied him,
solely for the purpose of learning the art of sieges under so
great a captain. On the 16th the army encamped on the
heights of Visnitza, and the next day all the baggage
arrived, in spite of a cloud of Tartars who scoured the
country. The count de Palfi was directed to invest the
place.

Two days after, Eugene himself made a grand reconnaissance.
When scarcely at a quarter of a league from the
camp, twelve hundred Turks fell upon his escort. A Mussulman
officer recognised him, drew near to him, and followed
him, pistol in hand. He had already penetrated
through two ranks, when he paid for his temerity with his
life. The Turks proving too weak to take advantage of the
occasion, were soon dispersed, and left the prince to continue
440

his operations. Continual discharges of artillery from the
Turkish galleys and saiks which covered the Danube, impeded
the works of the besiegers, at the same time that this
flotilla prevented the complete blockade of Belgrade.
Eugene ordered it to be destroyed. A long and obstinate
combat ensued on the river; but the Ottomans were conquered,
and left the Germans masters of the navigation.
The city now was completely invested. Lines of circumvallation
and countervallation completed the system of
attack and defence. To connect his operations, the prince
threw bridges over the Save and the Danube; but they lasted
only a short time; being carried away by a violent storm.
The Turks endeavoured to profit by this accident to disturb
the quarters which were momentarily separated from the
main army, and attacked the redoubts of the Hessians, who
defended themselves with great courage. The first assault
upon the body of the place was not very successful; the
prince had charged Colonel De Merci to carry the advanced
works on the side of the river, where the approaches were
tolerably easy and the fortifications not very redoubtable.
At the moment of obeying his instructions, Colonel De Merci
was struck with apoplexy, and was carried back to the camp.
The prince was unwilling to trust this delicate mission to
any other hands, and took it upon himself. He succeeded,
but he incurred extreme danger: three balls passed between
him and the prince of Dombes, who accompanied him: their
hissing was so violent as to startle their horses. On the
22nd of July, all the batteries directed against the city were
completed: they were unmasked all at once. The garrison,
consisting of twenty thousand men, responded to the fire
with much spirit; but their pieces were soon dismounted,
and they were constrained to remain quiet spectators of the
devastation caused by the enemyâs cannon. All at once,
there appeared on the neighbouring heights more than a
hundred thousand Turks, marching in good order: this was
the army of the grand vizier. Prince Eugene was now in
exactly the same situation as CÃ¦sar at the siege of Aliso;
he blockaded Belgrade, but he was himself blockaded by all
the Ottoman forces, collected for the defence of that place.
Surrounded by land on all sides, he would have been lost if
his trenches had been forced. The Turks raised several
441

batteries, which began to play upon the besiegers on the
2nd of August. In the night between the 14th and 15th,
they opened a trench opposite to the centre of the Imperialists,
and pushed their works to within a hundred paces of
the lines of the Christian army. To prevent the attack upon
his intrenchments by attacking the intrenchments of the
Turks, was following the example of CÃ¦sar. Prince Eugene
decided upon doing so. In the centre of his army he placed
the infantry, under the command of Prince Alexander of
Wurtemberg; on the two wings he arrayed his cavalry; in
two lines, behind these bodies, were regiments of infantry,
to support them. The reserve remained in the trenches,
under the orders of the count de Seckendorf, and the
garde
du camp
was confided to the valour of General Vrard. To
deceive the Ottoman army, Belgrade was bombarded vigorously
during the whole evening of the 16th, the fire only
ceasing at midnight. At one oâclock, the report of three
bombs was heard: this was the signal for marching. The
first line immediately moved forward in silence, and advanced
towards the
flÃ¨che
14
of the intrenchments by the light of the
moon. Suddenly a thick fog arose, the right of this line
missed its way, and fell into one of the enemyâs
boyaux

(branch of a trench). But confusion had seized the Turks,
and they began to fly: the Janissaries, however, rallied
them, and the fight commenced. The error of the Germans
had separated them from the centre; and the Mussulmans
threw themselves into the interval, in spite of the efforts of
Prince Eugene, whose operations were defeated by the fog.
During several hours they fought at hazard, in profound
darkness. At length, however, the cloud dispersed, and,
with the return of light, the general became aware of the
danger his army was in. He flew to its aid, and charged the
Mussulmans at the head of his volunteers; the Turks resisted
bravely, and the battle was sanguinary; Eugene was
slightly wounded by a sabre-stroke: but, fighting under the
eyes of their general, his soldiers became heroes; they
attacked, overthrew, and crushed every obstacle opposed to
their valour. In an instant the Turks abandoned the centre.
442

The Bavarian infantry now signalized their courage: led on
by a French officer, named La Colonie, they cleared the
ditches, ravines, and parapets, surmounted every obstacle,
overtook the Turks, charged and broke their battalions,
pursued them from trench to trench, and took possession of
a battery of eighteen guns defended by twenty thousand
Janissaries and four thousand Turks: their intrepidity
secured the triumph of the Imperialists. By eleven oâclock
in the morning, the Turks, broken and beaten on all sides,
took to flight, leaving thirteen thousand dead upon the field
of battle, five thousand wounded, and as many prisoners.
This victory cost the Germans more than three thousand
men, but it procured them an immense booty; a hundred
and thirty guns, with all the munitions and provisions of the
Ottomans, who lost fifty-two colours, nine horse-tails, and
four trumpets. On the morrow, the governor of Belgrade
hoisted the white flag: he was permitted to march out without
arms or munitions. The conquerors found in the city two
hundred cannons and sixty-eight mortars.

SEVENTH SIEGE, A.D. 1739.

Experience has shown that all the armies which have gone
to any distance from the Danube, in the wars of Hungary,
have been unfortunate, because, at the same time, they have
left their means of subsistence behind them. The thirst for
command which tormented the Austrian generals in 1739,
made them forgetful of these old war maxims. The Imperial
army, scattered about in all directions, was formidable
nowhere. Multiplied contradictory orders augmented the
uncertainty of their generals, and, every day, gave rise to
fresh errors among them. General Oliver Wallis replaced,
upon this dangerous theatre, KÅningsheck, created grand
master of the empressâs household. Very little flattered by
this command, General Wallis wrote to the king of Prussia,
upon his nomination: âThe emperor has confided to me the
command of his army: the first who conducted it before me
is in prison; he whom I immediately succeed has been made
eunuch of the seraglio; my only chance is to lose my head
at the end of the campaign.â The Imperial army, sixty
thousand strong, assembled near Belgrade. That of the
443

Turks was twice as numerous. Wallis marched against the
enemy without having made the least disposition. He
attacked the Janissaries with his cavalry, in a hollow way:
whilst his horse defiled in this passage, they could not defend
themselves against the Janissaries posted among the vines
and in the hedges, near the village of Grotska; his cavalry
was beaten in this defile before his infantry could come up.
The latter were led to slaughter with the same imprudence,
the Turks firing upon them at their pleasure, and in safety.
The Imperialists retreated with the decline of day, having
sustained a loss of twenty thousand men. If the Turks had
pursued them, Wallis and his whole army must have been
destroyed. Stupified with this disgrace, Wallis continued
to heap error upon error. Although joined by General
Neuperg, with a large detachment, he did not think himself
in safety till within the trenches of Belgrade. Pursued
thither by the grand vizier, he again abandoned this city
to the Turks, and recrossed the Danube. The emperor,
discouraged by these losses, ordered Marshal Neuperg to
treat for peace. It cost the Austrian monarch the kingdom
of Servia, and Belgrade. Oliver Wallis was not much mistaken
in his prognostics: he was imprisoned in the fortress
of BrÃ¼nn, and Marshal Neuperg, although much less culpable,
in the fortress of Gratz.

EIGHTH SIEGE, A.D. 1789.

It is the fate of an important fortress, situated on the
extreme frontier of powerful and warlike states, to be always
exposed to the first blows struck in great quarrels. Belgrade
fell again, in 1789, into the hands of the Austrians, commanded
by Marshal Laudon.

Restored to the Turks by Austria, in 1791, this city
became, in 1798, the theatre of war between the Mussulmans
and the rebel Servians, who, disputing the possession of it,
fought even in the faubourgs.

444

CASTILLON.

A.D. 1452.

However
unimportant this siege may look in the âgreat
history,â we cannot refrain from giving it, as the scene of
the âlast fightâ of one of the bravest and most esteemed
heroes that do honour to our annals.

The army of Charles VII. of France, on the 13th of July,
1452, laid siege to Castillon, a little city of Perigord, on the
Dordogne, ten leagues from Bordeaux, then in the occupation
of the English. Marshals LohÃ©ac and Jalognes had the
conducting of it; Jean Biereau, grand master of the artillery,
commanded seven hundred cannoniers. This place,
surrounded by lines of circumvallation and an intrenched
camp, was brought to bay, when the brave English general
Talbot came to its aid. He at once put to flight a body of
free-archers. Seduced by this easy success, he marched
straight to the intrenchments of the French camp. Its
fortifications astonished him, without abating his courage:
he gave the assault. During two hours, he braved all the
efforts and the murderous fire of the French,âat eighty
years of age, he fought with all the ardour of youth: the
English gave way; twice he brought them back to the
charge, and twice he was repulsed. A fresh French corps
came up, fell upon the rear-guard of the English, and overwhelmed
it.

In vain Talbot, sword in hand, covered with blood and
dust, rode through the ranks, animating his men by
his words and his example. His war-horse, struck down
by a culverin, encumbered him in his fall. He was on the
point of expiring, when his son flew to his assistance.
âRetire!â cried the generous old man, âreserve your
young days for a more useful occasion. I die fighting for
my country; live, my son, to serve it.â

After uttering these words, he expired. His son, the
445

young Lord Lisle, fell a few minutes after, whilst endeavouring
to avenge his death. The English fled; and Castillon
surrendered the next day.

âThus perished Talbot, whom the English of that
day called their Achilles. He had, it is true, the valour
of one: he was not only brave, but an excellent negotiator,
a faithful subject, a sincere friend, and a generous
enemy.â

And this eulogy is written by a Frenchman! So pleased
were we with it, that we abstained from calling in Shakespeare,
who has immortalized this last scene of the gallant
Talbot and his son. When will Frenchmen do equal justice
to Nelson and Wellington? When perhaps they have been
dead as long as Talbot has.

LIEGE.

A.D. 1468.

We
offer this siege to our young readers as a sort of
illustration of one of Sir Walter Scottâs best novels. Sir
Walter has dealt freely with historical characters; he has
made most of them effective, but has not always adhered
quite faithfully either to men or events. But no novelist,âand
we should have said no dramatist, if a bust of Shakespeare
had not been looking down upon us,âever sketched
an historical character so happily as he has done that of
Louis XI.;âit is Louis himself! with all his pettinesses,
shrewdness, superstition, and duplicity.

Louis XI. had raised the LiÃ©geois against their suzerain,
the duke of Burgundy. In an over-cunning attempt at
policy, Louis had placed himself in the hands of the bold
Burgundian, who, irritated by the outbreak at LiÃ©ge, compelled
the imprudent monarch to hoist the cross of St. Andrew,
the ensign of the house of Burgundy, and lead his
army against the LiÃ©geois, whose revolt he had excited.
Made aware of the storm about to break over their ramparts,
the inhabitants prepared for a vigorous defence. Although
reduced to a feeble garrison of six hundred men, the burgesses
determined to withstand with courage the efforts of
446

an enemy who had sworn to ruin them. The duke of Burgundy
opened the trenches, and took up his lodging in one
of the faubourgs. The besieged, in a vigorous sortie, killed
eight hundred Burgundians, and put the rest of their infantry
to flight. Wild, provost of LiÃ©ge, who had led on this
attack, died of his wounds: the loss was irreparable,âno
one could replace him. The duke of Burgundy and the king
came up. They lodged in houses in the faubourgs, and
ordered many useless attacks and assaults. Several days
passed without any event of consequence. During this
short repose, the LiÃ©geois meditated carrying off the king
and the duke by surprise. In the darkness and silence of
night, the LiÃ©geois marched, led by the owners of the houses
in which the princes were lodged. A hollow way cut through
a rock covered their march. They killed some sentinels,
arrived at the lodgings without being discovered, and stopped
at a pavilion in which dwelt the count du Perche, son
of the duke dâAlenÃ§on. They missed the decisive moment.
The two princes were awakened and put upon their guard.
Three hundred men-at-arms were round them instantly.
The tumult was horrible. The clash of arms, the uncertainty
of the cause of the peril, the darkness, and the cries of the
combatants, augmented the confusion of this frightful
mÃªlÃ©e
.
The LiÃ©geois, conscious of the smallness of their numbers,
and feeling they must succumb, fought like lions at bay:
they perished, but sold their lives dearly. The king and the
duke of Burgundy met in the street, at the head of their
guards; their presence removed mutual suspicions. They
separated, after felicitating each other upon their good fortune
and intrepidity upon so perilous an occasion. This
fruitless attempt only increased the rage of the irritable
duke: he ordered an assault for the 30th of October. At
the given signal, towards daybreak, forty thousand men advanced
to the foot of the battlements, to the sound of warlike
instruments. Nobody appeared upon the walls to defend
them; the inhabitants had fled; women, children, and old
men awaited in consternation and silence the evils it would
please their implacable conqueror to pour upon them. The
Burgundians entered without resistance. The poor remains
of the population took refuge in the churches from the fury
of the soldiery. The duke triumphed: but what triumph
447

could satisfy his brutal nature? Priests were immolated at
the foot of the altar; sacred virgins, dragged from their
asylums, were violated and then massacred; soldiers went
from house to house with the lighted torch and naked sword
in their hands; they vented their fury upon defenceless
women and children; plunder was the least of their crimes.
The unfortunate fugitives perished in the woods of hunger
and destitution, or were pitilessly massacred; prisoners, too
poor to pay their ransom, were precipitated into the waters
of the Meuse. The city, when changed into a desert, presenting
no animated creature upon which the barbarous
conqueror could exercise his cruel vengeance, he directed
his resentment against inanimate objects. Four thousand
men of the country of Limbourg were commanded to set fire
to the public edifices, and to demolish all that the flames had
not devoured. LiÃ©ge soon became one heap of melancholy
ruins.

And this was Charles the Bold, or rather, as
tÃ©mÃ©raire

is better translated, âthe Rash!â to whom, as the
impersonation of brute courage, I dare say the Burgundians
have raised statues, as we have raised one to Richard I.,
just such another hero, who slaughtered his five thousand
Saracen captives before Acre! An intelligent foreigner
said: âYou propose a statue to Richard I.: you have one
of George IV.; where is Alfredâs?â

BEAUVAIS.

A.D. 1472.

This
siege brings the same actors on the stage, and we
are principally induced to offer it to our readers by the
circumstance of the detestable homicide meeting in it with
a reverse, and that partly occasioned by women.

Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, was engaged in an
inveterate war with Louis XI. Learning there was but a
weak garrison in Beauvais, he marched towards that city,
with the expectation of entering it without opposition; and
so it proved with the faubourgs, and the Burgundians
448

thought themselves masters of the place; but the citizens,
the moment they were aware of their danger, closed their
gates, and took their posts on the walls like men. Not
only these: the women and maidens insisted upon taking
part in this honourable defence. Led by Joan Hachette,
they ranged themselves on the parts of the walls the least
protected; and one of these heroines even obtained an
enemyâs standard, and bore it in triumph into the city.
The principal attack of the besiegers was directed against
the gate of Bresle: the cannon had already beaten it in;
the breach was open, and the city would have been taken, if
the inhabitants had not heaped together on the spot an
immense mass of fagots and combustible matters. The
flames of this pile proved an efficient check to the Burgundians.
The assault began at eight oâclock in the morning,
and was still raging, when, towards the decline of day, a
noble body of troops was seen entering by the Paris gate.
These brave fellows, having marched fourteen leagues without
halting, gave their horses and equipments to the care of
the women and girls, and flew to those parts of the walls
where the fight was hottest. The besiegers, though numbering
eighty thousand, could not resist the united valour
of the garrison and the new comers; they soon wavered, and
at length fled to their camp in disorder. More defenders
arrived by daybreak; the citizens received them as liberators;
they spread tables for them in the streets and public
places, cheered them with refreshments, and afterwards
accompanied them to the walls. The duke of Burgundy
then perceived, but too late, a great error he had committed.
Instead of investing Beauvais with a numerous army, he had
attacked it on one side only: succours and convoys arrived
from all parts. The duke himself began to experience the
horrors of famine; the French, scouring the country, intercepted
his convoys. Everything announced a fruitless
enterprise; but he resolved, before raising the siege, to
attempt a general assault. The besieged, under the orders
of Marshal De Rouault, prepared to receive him. The marshal
wanted to relieve La Roche-Tesson and Fontenailles; but as
they had arrived first, and had established themselves at the
gate of Bresle, which was the post of danger, they complained
of removal as of an affront, and obtained permission to
449

retain a post they had kept night and day. The trumpets
sounded, the cannon roared, the Burgundians advanced, fire
and sword in hand; they planted their ladders, mounted the
breaches, and attacked the besieged: the latter received
them with firmness; they precipitated them, they crushed
them, or beat them back from their walls. Raging like a
wild bull, Charles rallied his soldiers and led them back
to the assault; but they were again repulsed, with greater
loss than before. How willingly we may suppose, Charles
sounded a retreat. Had it not been for the excessive precaution
of some of the burgesses, his army must have been
entirely destroyed: they had walled up the gates on the side
next the Burgundians, which impeded the sortie. Charles
raised the siege on the 10th of July. Louis XI. rewarded
the valour and fidelity of the inhabitants by an exemption
from imposts. As the women had exhibited most ardour in
defence of Beauvais, he ordered that they should take precedence
of the men in the fÃªte which was celebrated every
year, on the 10th of July, in honour of their deliverance
from the power of a man known to be a sanguinary
conqueror.

GRENADA.

A.D. 1491.

Ferdinand V.
, king of Arragon, besieged Boabdil, the
last king of the Moors of Grenada, in his capital, with an
army of fifty thousand men. Grenada, surrounded by a
double wall, fortified by one thousand and thirty towers, had
two citadels, one of which served as a palace for the king.
An army of thirty thousand Moors was within the walls; it
had an immense and warlike population, and magnificent
stores of munitions and provisions seemed to render it impregnable.
Ferdinand did not attack Grenada according to
the usual system of sieges; he employed neither lines, nor
trenches, nor artillery: he surrounded his own camp with
walls and works. His sole aim was to starve the enemy,
and make himself master of all the passages; he rooted up
450

the trees, he burnt the houses, and in a moment changed a
delightful territory into a dry and arid desert. The garrison
endeavoured to make sorties, but it was overwhelmed by
numbers, and always proved unfortunate. The Saracens
flattered themselves that the rigours of winter would oblige
the Christians to depart; but their hopes were disappointed.
Ferdinandâs camp became a fortified city, furnished with
solid fire-proof houses. The Moors saw with grief that
nothing could discourage the Castilians. The rigours of
famine began to be felt, and cold augmented both public
and private misery. In this extremity it was determined to
treat with Ferdinand, and they consented to surrender, if
not relieved within sixty days. Scarcely had the Moorish
king signed the treaty than he repented of it; the thoughts
of descending from his throne plunged him into the deepest
grief, and yet he did not dare to retract, so great were the
evils that surrounded him. His army could not endure the
idea of submitting to the Christians, and the inhabitants
incessantly implored the assistance of God and of Mahomet.
Suddenly an Alfaique excited the people to revolt; at his
voice twenty thousand men took arms. Boabdil required
all his eloquence to restore order; he pointed out to them,
with tears in his eyes, that if they preferred life to a certain
death, they were bound by the stern necessity of observing
the capitulation. The sedition was appeased, but the public
despair was so great, that the king of the Moors, dreading
to see it renewed, hastened to surrender all his forts, and to
repair to the camp of the conqueror. Thus, after a duration
of seven hundred and sixty-two years, terminated the domination
of the Moors in Spain.

451

VIENNA.

Vienna
, from its geographical position and its political
importance, has been subjected to several sieges, and yet
has occasionally, like Rome, sometimes escaped those fearful
visitations when it might have expected them.

FIRST SIEGE, A.D. 1529.

After having subdued Asia, Soliman II. determined to
make Europe tremble by the terrors of his constantly victorious
arms. In 1529 this redoubtable conqueror entered
Hungary with fire and sword; he pillaged, ravaged, and
destroyed everything in his passage, and marched over these
melancholy ruins to lay siege to Vienna, the capital of
Austria and of the whole Western empire, since the house
of Austria was said to occupy the throne of Charlemagne.
The Ottoman army was immense, and was composed of the
brave Janissaries who had just subdued Persia. But Vienna
contained within its walls both warlike citizens and intrepid
soldiers. The sultan commenced his operations by mining
the walls. This immense labour was frequently interrupted
by the counter-mines of the besieged; but at length some
of these concealed volcanoes burst forth all at once, and
threw down a great part of the walls. In an instant the
Viennese, men, women, and children, flew to construct a
new rampart; and when the infidels came to the assault,
they were surprised to find themselves stopped, at a few
paces from the breach, by this barrier, which twenty pieces
of cannon and tens of thousands of defenders rendered
impregnable. They then turned their attention to another
side, where there had been only time to intrench with palisades.
At this point the bodies of the inhabitants served
as bulwarks. The combat here was terrible; rivers of blood
and heaps of slain rolled beneath the steps of the warriors.
Twice the Turks were repulsed with loss; twice the sultan
452

and his officers rallied them and led them back against the
enemy, and twice were they on the point of carrying the
city. During four hours they fought and immolated each
other, without being able to imagine to which side victory
would be favourable. At length the thunders which were
incessantly launched from all quarters of the place crushed
whole ranks of the infidels, and the invincible courage of
the inhabitants drove off an enemy who had more than once
shouted clamorous cries of victory. This first check only
seemed to inflame the valour of the Turks; on the 12th of
October, Soliman harangued them, and gave orders for a
general assault. They were preparing for it during a great
part of the night; and on the 13th, at break of day, all the
bodies of the Turkish army advanced in good order, armed,
some with blazing torches, others with muskets, arrows, and
axes, and a great number with ladders, and all sorts of machines
to force or to get over the walls. But they were
expected: the Austrians had placed on the walls all their
artillery, all their mortars, and all their soldiers. The city
was attacked on more than twenty points at once, and from
every one the infidels were obliged to retreat with great loss
and disgrace. The fight lasted for twelve hours, without
either side thinking of food or rest, and night alone put an
end to the fearful slaughter. Soliman, in despair, sounded
a retreat: he had vainly consumed forty days before Vienna,
and had lost more than forty thousand men in his different
assaults upon that city. As a crowning misfortune, snows,
frosts, and tempests made still greater havoc with his army
than the enemy had done. Even Soliman the Great, the
invincible Soliman, could not overcome these obstaclesâhe
raised the siege, and Vienna was saved.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1683.

The grand vizier, Kara Mustapha, charged with the
humiliation of the empire and Leopold its master, advanced
towards the capital of the states of that prince with terrible
preparations. Very unlike what we have seen in the former
siege, at the approach of the enemyâs legions the emperor
quitted Vienna, with two empresses, his mother-in-law and
his wife, with the archdukes and archduchesses, and sixty
453

thousand inhabitants. The country round exhibited nothing
but fugitives, equipages, carts laden with goods, the laggard
of all which became the prey of the Tartars, who pillaged,
ravaged, burnt, slaughtered, and led them away into slavery.
On the 7th of July, 1683, the city was invested, and all Europe
tremblingly watched the issue of this famous enterprise.

Vienna, bathed by the Danube on the north, was fortified
by twelve great bastions in the remainder of its inclosure.
The curtains were covered by good half-moons, without any
other outworks; the ditch was partly filled with water, and
partly dry, and the counterscarp was much neglected. The
side of the city which was bathed by the river had no
defence but strong walls, flanked by large towers, the whole
well terraced. In a plain of three leagues, environed by a
circle of mountains, the vizier fixed his camp, which he had
the audacity to leave undefended, except with lines of
circumvallation and countervallation. Everything was in
abundance in the campâmoney, munitions of war, and provisions
of all sorts. The different quarters boasted pachas
as magnificent as kings, and this magnificence was effaced
by that of the vizier; to use the phrase of an historian, âhe
swam in luxury.â The court of a grand vizier generally
consists of two thousand officers and domestics; Mustapha
had double that number. His park, that is to say, the
inclosure of his tents, was as large as the besieged city.
The richest stuffs, gold and precious stones, were there contrasted
with the polished steel of arms. There were baths,
gardens, fountains, and rare animals, as well for the convenience
as the amusement of the general, whose effeminacy
and frivolity did not in the least relax the operations of the
siege. His artillery, composed of three hundred pieces of
cannon, was not the less formidable; and the bravery of the
Janissaries was not at all enervated by the example of their
leader.

The count de Staremberg, a man perfect in the art of war,
the governor of Vienna, had set fire to the faubourgs, and to
save the citizens, he had destroyed their buildings. He had
a garrison estimated at sixteen thousand men, but which in
reality consisted of about eleven thousand at most. The
citizens and the university were armed; the students
mounted guard, and had a physician for their major. Starembergâs
454

second in command was the count de Capliers, the
emperorâs commissary-general, one of those men whom
knowledge, vigilance, and activity point out as fit for the
highest posts.

The approaches to Vienna were easy. The trenches were
opened on the 14th of July, in the faubourg of St. Ulric, at
fifty paces from the counterscarp; the attack was directed
against the bastion of the court, and that of Lebb. Two
days only advanced the works as far as the counterscarp,
where the ditch was dry. The duke of Lorraine, who had
posted himself in the isle of Leopoldstadt, using every exertion
to preserve there a communication with the city, then
found himself obliged to retreat by the bridges he had
thrown over the Danube, and which he broke down behind
him. The country houses, of which the island was full, then
lodged the Turks. This proceeding has been considered a
great mistake; but if it was one, the duke thoroughly
repaired it by his behaviour during the whole siege. With
an army which never amounted to thirty thousand men, he
covered Hungary, Moravia, Silesia, and Bohemia; he protected
Vienna; he checked Tekeli; and he stopped the progress
of more than forty thousand Turks and Tartars, who
scoured and devastated the country.

But he could not prevent the infidels from carrying on
the siege with vigour. With the Turks, there were daily
mounds raised, works advanced, new batteries, and a fire
which augmented every instant; with the Austrians, it was,
in an equal degree, a display of the most intrepid valour and
firm resistance. Staremberg, who at the first approaches had
been wounded by a fragment of stone struck off from the
curtain by a ball, though only half-cured, animated the whole
defence by his looks, his actions, and his humanity. He
treated all his soldiers like brothers; he praised and recompensed
all distinguished actions; and, not content with
being with them during the day, he passed the night upon a
mattress in the
corps de garde
of the emperorâs palace, which
adjoined a bastion of the court comprised in the attack. By
the 22nd of July, the besiegers were at the palisade, which
was only defended by the sword. They were so near, that
they grappled each other across the pikes in death-struggles.
The count de Daun, a general officer of distinguished merit,
455

had scythes fastened to long poles, which destroyed a vast
number of the infidels, but which could not diminish the
presumptuous confidence which animated them. So certain
were they of victory, that they came forward to make bravadoes
similar to those of which we read in ancient wars. A
champion of extraordinary stature advanced with a threatening
air, insulting with both voice and sabre. A Christian
soldier, unable to endure this affront, sprang out to encounter
him: he at first was wounded, but quickly wounded
and disarmed his enemy, cut off his head with his own scimitar,
and found fifty gold pieces stitched up in his vest.
One would suppose that this brave fellow would be rewarded;
not so: he remained a private soldier, and his name, which
the Romans would have consecrated in the
fasti
of history,
is not even known to us. The besieged, who beheld the
action from the top of the ramparts, drew a good augury
from it; it redoubled their constancy and courage.

The enemy did not obtain possession of the counterscarp
before the 7th of August, after twenty-three daysâ fighting,
with a great effusion of blood on both sides. The count de
Serini, nephew of the famous Serini whom Leopold had
brought to the scaffold, had retarded the taking of this work
by a thousand actions of bravery. There was no sortie in
which he was not conspicuous. His ardour on one occasion
prevented his feeling that he had received an arrow in his
shoulder. The Turks had come to the descent of the ditch; no
people equal them in turning up the ground. The depth of
their work was astonishing: the earth they threw out was
carried to the height of nine feet, surmounted by planks and
posts in the form of floors, beneath which they worked in
safety. Their trenches differ from those of Europeans in
shape: they are cuttings in the form of a crescent, which
cover one another, preserving a communication like the
scales of fish, which conceal a labyrinth from whence they
fire without inconveniencing those who are in front, and
whence it is almost impossible to dislodge them. When the
Janissaries had once entered them, they scarcely ever left
them. Their fire became progressively more active, whilst
that of the besieged relaxed: the latter began to husband
their powder, and grenades were short. The baron de
Kielmansegge invented a powder-mill and clay grenades,
456

which proved of great service. Industry employed all its
resources; but the hope of holding out much longer began
to diminish. The enemyâs mines, the continual attacks, the
diminishing garrison, the nearly exhausted munitions and
provisions, everything conspired to create the greatest
anxiety; and not content with so many real evils, they
invented imaginary ones. A report was spread that traitors
were working subterranean passages by which to introduce
the infidels. Every one was commanded to keep watch in
his cellar; and this increase of fatigue completed the weakness
of the defenders of Vienna, by robbing them of their
necessary rest. Others spoke confidently of incendiaries
hired to second the Turks. A young man found in a church
which had just been set fire to, although most likely innocent,
was torn to pieces by the people. But the Turkish
artillery was more to be dreaded than all these phantoms.
The inhabitants were incessantly employed in extinguishing
the fires which the bombs and red-hot balls kindled in the
city, whilst the outworks were falling in one continued crash.
The half-moon had already suffered greatly; the ramparts
presented in all parts vast breaches; and, but for the invincible
courage of the inhabitants and the soldiers, Vienna
must have been taken.

In this extremity, Leopold turned his eyes towards
Poland. John Sobieski, the terror of the Ottomans, and
perhaps the only sovereign of his age who was a great captain,
was supplicated to come to the assistance of the empire
and the whole Christian world. This monarch instantly
responded to the summons by marching thither at the head
of twenty-five thousand men. He traversed two hundred
leagues of country, and on the 5th of September he crossed
the bridge of Tuln with his army, five leagues above Vienna.
The Polish cavalry was remarkable for its horses, uniform,
and noble bearing. It might be said that they were equipped
at the expense of the infantry: among the latter, there
was one battalion extremely ill-clothed. Prince Lubomirski
advised the king, for the honour of the country, to order
them to pass in the night. Sobieski judged otherwise; and
when that troop was on the bridge, he said to the spectators,ââLook
well at them; that is an invincible troop of men,
who have taken an oath never to wear any clothes but those
457

of the enemy. In the last war they were all clothed in the
Turkish fashion.â âIf these words did not clothe them,
they cuirassed them,â pleasantly observes the AbbÃ© Cayer,
whose account we follow.

The Poles, after crossing the bridge, extended themselves
to the right, exposed during twenty-four hours to being cut
to pieces, if Kara Mustapha had taken due advantage of
their position. On the 7th, all the German troops joined
their allies, and the army was then found to amount to about
seventy-four thousand men. There were four sovereign
princes among them,âJohn Sobieski of Poland, Maximilian
Emanuel, elector of Bavaria, John George III., elector of
Saxony, and Charles V., duke of Lorraine; and twenty-six
princes of sovereign houses.

Vienna was driven to bay. The Turks and diseases carried
off, as if in concert, both officers and soldiers. Almost
all the leaders had disappeared; the warrior, exhausted by
fatigue and want of good food, dragged himself to the breach;
and he whom the fire of the enemy spared, expired with languor
and debility. The people, who had at first undertaken
the labours of the siege with such eagerness, now dreamt of
no other defence but prayer. They filled the churches, into
which bombs and cannon-balls constantly brought terror and
death. On the 22nd of August, it appeared certain that
they could not hold out more than three days, if the Turks
gave a general assault. From that melancholy period, one
mine seemed to precipitate itself upon another. The half-moon
was taken; breaches of from eighteen to twenty toises
laid open the two bastions and the curtain; soldiers served
instead of walls. A mine was advancing under the emperorâs
palace, already beaten to pieces with bombs, and close to the
bastion of the court. Other mines, like snakes, were winding
about in all directions; several were discovered; but the
Austrian miners were timid, and could not be persuaded to
go under ground when once they had heard the enemy at
work there. The artillery was no longer able to respond,
most of the cannons being either broken or dismounted.
Staremberg scarcely preserved a ray of hope, or rather, he
did not longer dare to hope; and the general who at the
commencement of the siege had said, âI will only surrender
the place with the last drop of my blood,â wrote to the duke
458

of Lorraine in this critical moment: âNo more time to be
lost, monseigneurâno more time to be lost.â Even the
most rapid activity would have been of no avail, but for the
stupid inaction of the grand vizier, who, for the sake of the
riches with which he thought Vienna filled, waited in the
expectation of its surrendering by capitulation. Such was
his blindness, that he was ignorant of the preparations of
the Christians when they were upon the point of overwhelming
him.

When about to march, Sobieski gave out the following
order of battle, written with his own hand: âThe
corps de
bataille
shall be composed of the imperial troops, to whom
we will join the regiment of cavalry of the Marshal De la
Cour, the Chevalier Lubomirski, and four or five squadrons
of our gendarmes, in the place of whom some dragoons or
other German troops shall be given. This corps shall be
commanded by M. the duke of Lorraine.

âThe Polish army will occupy the right wing, which will
be commanded by the grand-general Jublonowski, and the
other generals of that nation.

âThe troops of MM. the electors of Bavaria and Saxony
shall form the left wing, to whom we will give also some
squadrons of our gendarmes and of our other Polish cavalry,
in the place of whom they will give us some dragoons or
some infantry.

âThe cannons shall be divided; and in case MM. the
electors have not enough, M. the duke of Lorraine will
furnish them with some.

âThe troops of the circles of the empire will extend
along the Danube, with the left wing falling back a little
on their right; and that for two reasons: the first, to alarm
the enemy with the fear of being charged in flank; and the
second, to be within reach of throwing succours into the
city, in case we should not be able to drive the enemy as
soon as we could wish. M. the prince of Waldeck will
command this corps.

âThe first line will consist entirely of infantry, with
cannons, followed closely by a line of cavalry. If these two
lines were mixed, they would doubtless embarrass each
other in the passages of the defiles, woods, and mountains.
But as soon as they shall be on the plain, the cavalry will
459

take its posts in the intervals of the battalions, which will
be arranged with this view, particularly our gendarmes, who
will charge first.

âIf we were to put all our armies in three lines only, it
would require more than a German league and a half, which
would not be to our advantage; and we should be obliged
to cross the little river Vien, which must be our right wing:
it is for this reason we must make four lines; and this
fourth shall serve as a body of reserve.

âFor the greater security of the infantry against the
first charge of the Turkish cavalry, which is always impetuous,
it will be desirable to employ
spanchÃ©raistres
, or

chevaux de frise
, but very light, for convenience of carriage,
and at every halt place them in front of the battalions.

âI beg all the messieurs the generals, that as fast as
the armies shall descend from the last mountain, as they shall
enter the plain, every one will take its post as it is set down
in this present order.â

There were but five leagues between them and the
Turks, from whom they were separated by that chain of
mountains which surrounded the vast plain on which they
were encamped. Two routes presented themselves: one by
the more elevated part; the other, by the side where the
summit, sinking, became more practicable. The first was
fixed upon: it was true it was the more difficult, but it was
the shorter. On the 9th of September all the troops moved
forward. The Germans, after many attempts to bring up
their cannon, gave the matter up in despair, and left them
in the plain. The Poles had more spirit and perseverance.
By manual strength and address they contrived to get over
twenty-eight pieces, and these alone were used on the day
of battle. This march, bristling with difficulties, lasted
three days. At length they approached the last mountain,
called Calemberg. There was yet plenty of time for the
vizier to repair his faults: he had only to take possession of
this height, and mark the defiles, and he would have stopped
the Christian army. But he did not do so; and it was at
this moment that the Janissaries, indignant at so many
blunders, exclaimed: âCome on, come on, ye infidels! The
sight of your hats alone will put us to flight.â

This summit of Calemberg, still left free, discovered to
460

the Christians, an hour before nightfall, both the innumerable
hosts of the Turks and Tartars, and the smoking
ruins of Vienna. Signals incontinently informed the
besieged of the succour at hand. We must have suffered
all the dangers and miseries of a long siege, and have felt
ourselves, our wives, and our children doomed to the sword
of a victor, or slavery in a barbarous country, to have an
idea of the joy the city experienced. Sobieski, after having
examined all the positions of the vizier, said to the German
generals, âThat man is very badly encamped; he is an
ignorant fellow: we shall beat him.â The cannon, on both
sides, played the prelude to the grand scene of the morrow.
It was the 12th of September. Two hours before dawn, the
king, the duke of Lorraine, and several other generals, performed
a religious duty, very little practised in our time,âthey
received the communion; whilst the Mussulmans
were crying to the only and solitary God of Abraham,

Allah! Allah!

At sunrise, the Christian army descended with slow and
measured steps, closing their ranks, rolling their cannon
before them, and halting at every thirty or forty paces to
fire and reload. This front widened, and took more depth
as the space became greater. The Turks were in the
greatest astonishment. The khan of the Tartars drew the
vizierâs attention to the lances ornamented with banderoles
of the Polish gendarmerie, and said, âThe king is at their
head!ââand terror seized upon the heart of Kara
Mustapha. Immediately, after having commanded the
Tartars to put all their captives to death, to the amount of
thirty thousand, he ordered half of his army to march
towards the mountain, whilst the other half approached the
walls of the city, to give a general assault. But the
besieged had resumed their courage. The hope, and even
the certainty of victory, had rendered them invincible.

The Christians continued to descend, and the Turks moved
upwards. The action commenced. The first line of the
Imperialists, all infantry, charged with so much impetuosity,
that it gave place for a line of cavalry, which took part in
the intervals of the battalions. The king, the princes, and
the generals gained the head, and fought, sometimes with
the cavalry and sometimes with the infantry. The two other
461

lines urged the first on warmly, protected by the fire of the
artillery, which was incessant and very near. The field of
the first shock, between the plain and the mountain, was
intersected with vineyards, heights, and small valleys. The
enemy having left their cannon at the beginning of the
vineyards, suffered greatly from those of the Christians.
The combatants, spread over this unequal ground, fought
with inveteracy up to mid-day. At length the infidels, taken
in flank, and driven from hill to hill, retired into the plain,
lining their camp.

During the heat of the
mÃªlÃ©e
, all the bodies of the
Christian army having fought sometimes on the heights,
and sometimes in the valleys, they had necessarily doubled
over each other, and deranged the order of battle. A short
time was given to re-establish it; and the plain became the
theatre of a triumph which posterity will always feel difficulty
in believing. Seventy thousand men boldly attacked more
than two hundred thousand! In the Turkish army, the
pacha of Diarbeker commanded the right wing, the pacha
of Buda the left. The vizier was in the centre, having by
his side the aga of the Janissaries and the general of the
Spahis. The two armies remained motionless for some time,
the Christians in silence, whilst the Turks and Tartars emulated
the clarions with their cries. At length Sobieski gave
the signal, and, sabre in hand, the Polish cavalry charged
straight upon the vizier in the centre. They broke through
the front ranks, they even pierced through the numerous
squadrons which surrounded Mustapha. The Spahis disputed
the victory; but all the others,âthe Wallachians, the
Moldavians, the Transylvanians, the Tartars, and even the
Janissaries, fought without spirit. In vain the Ottoman
general endeavoured to revive confidence: they despised
him and disregarded his words. He addressed himself to the
pacha of Buda, and to other chiefs, but their only reply was
desponding silence. âAnd thou!â cried he then to the
Tartar prince, âwilt not thou assist me?â The khan saw
no safety but in flight. The Spahis were making their last
efforts: the Polish cavalry opened and dispersed them. The
vizier then turned his back, and spread consternation by
his flight. The discouragement extended to the wings,
which all the bodies of the Christian army pressed at once.
462

Terror deprived of both reflection and strength this immense
multitude of men, who ought, in an open plain like that they
fought on, to have completely enveloped and crushed their
enemy. But all dispersed, and all disappeared, as if by
magic; that vast camp, which the eye could not measure,
resembled a frightful desert. Night stopped the victorious
progress of the Christians, who remained upon the field of
battle till daybreak. At six oâclock in the morning, the
enemyâs camp was given up to the soldiery, whose cupidity
was at first suspended by a horrible spectacle; mothers lay
stretched about in all directions, with their throats cut,
many of them with their infants still clinging to their breasts.
These women were not like those who follow Christian
armiesâcourtesans, as fatal to health as to morals; these
were wives, whom the Turks preferred sacrificing thus to
exposing them to becoming the victims of unbridled conquerors.
They had spared a great part of the children.
Live or six hundred of these little innocent victims of war
were collected by the bishop of Newstadt, and were fed and
brought up in the Christian religion. The Germans and
the Poles were greatly enriched by the spoils of the Mussulmans.
It was upon this occasion the king wrote to the
queen, his wife: âThe grand vizier has made me his heir,
and I have found in his tents to the value of many millions
of ducats. So you will not have to say of me as the Tartar
wives say when they see their husbands return empty-handed:
âYou are not men, you come home without booty.ââ
Thus, without much bloodshed, the valour and skill of John
Sobieski saved Vienna, the empire, and religion. In fact, if
Vienna had been taken, as at Constantinople, churches
would have been changed into mosques, and nobody can say
where Mahometanism, which already was spread over so
much of the globe, might have ended. Staremberg came,
immediately after the victory, to salute the preserver and
liberator of Vienna, into which city the hero entered over
ruins, but amidst the acclamations of the people. His horse
could scarcely pierce through the crowd who prostrated
themselves before him, who would kiss his feet, calling him
their father, their avenger, the greatest of monarchs. Leopold
seemed to be forgottenâthey only saw Sobieski.

463

But, alas for the gratitude of peoples! Poland, whose
king thus successfully interfered between Mahometanism
and Christianity, to the shame of the European powers is
no longer a nation! The great error of its constitution,
which made the monarchy elective, created feuds, of which
three powerful neighbouring countries took advantage.
Poland was, by degrees, partitioned amongst them, and
Austria, which owed it so much, was one of the most eager
and greedy of the plunderers.

ALGIERS.

A.D. 1541.

The
never-ending piracies of Algiers had for centuries
made this city or state the object of the hatred of all
Christian princes, and the dread of all Christian peoples.
The opinion entertained by Europeans of the pirates of
Algiers can be compared to nothing but that inculcated of
the demons of another world. Among the most daring,
ambitious, and successful of this race of marauders was Barbarossa:
he aspired to something above the character of a
âsalt-water thief,â and intruded upon the lands as well as
the vessels and subjects of his opposite neighbour, Charles I.
of Spain, and V. of Germany.

The emperor was politic as well as brave; he watched for
an opportunity of avenging himself with safety; and he
thought he had found this when he learnt that the emperor
of the corsairs was gone to Constantinople. A volume
written upon the power of Barbarossa could not display it
so eloquently as the circumstance of the monarch, possessed
of more extensive territories in Europe than had been held
by one man since the time of Charlemagne, being obliged
to wait till this Cacus was absent from his den before he
would venture to assail it. Charles prided himself upon
being a brave knight, but this was a wide departure from
the laws of chivalry, which commanded all who acknowledged
them to send due notice to an enemy of an intended hostile
attack.

464

This absence appeared to Charles a favourable opportunity
for attempting the subjugation or destruction of Algiers.
It was the autumn of 1541, the season of storms at sea and
of diseases and plagues on the coast of Africa. Ambitious
princes do not often benefit by the study of history; they
think their own genius or their own power can overcome
obstacles that have been fatal to others; otherwise Charles
might have learnt what would be the issue of his enterprise
by turning to the melancholy story of the death of Louis IX.
of France. Neither did he want for prudent advice from
living counsellors. The great seaman Admiral Doria, who
was likewise an excellent general, and of approved valour,
when consulted by the emperor on the subject, said: â
Let
me persuade you from this enterprise; for, par Dieu, if we go
thither, we shall all perish.
â But Charles was never easily
turned aside from a favourite project by good advice, and he
replied: â
Twenty-two years of empire for me, and seventy-two
years of life for you, ought to be sufficient to make us
both die content.
â A few days after this advice had been
asked and refused, the emperor and his army embarked; and
upon their landing in Africa, were immediately assailed by
the diseases and subjected to the famine that had been predicted.
Before they commenced the attack, an eloquent
and politic gentleman was sent to the old eunuch Hasem,
who commanded in the absence of Barbarossa, to endeavour
to intimidate him, and, if that could not be effected, to
corrupt him. But this trustworthy governor replied, that
â
it was very foolish to attempt to give advice to an enemy, but
it would be still more foolish for the enemy to attend to that
advice when it was given
.â These dispositions reduced the
emperor to the necessity of attacking the place in form.
The defence of the Algerines was firm and vigorous; and
their valour, assisted by frightful tempests, compelled the
emperor to raise a siege in which his army was perishing
with famine and misery. When he returned to Europe,
Charles V. instantly sent Aretin a gold chain of the value of
a hundred ducats, to engage him to be silent on the subject
of his disaster. â
This
,â said Aretin, â
is but a poor present
for such an enormous piece of folly.
â Aretin, we should
inform our young readers, was an Italian writer, who by
some bold satires directed against princes and other conspicuous
465

characters, had elevated himself to the position of a
kind of European censor. As in most such cases, the persons
attacked really gave importance to satires which, if they had
been left alone, like other bubbles, would have burst very
innocuously. But the speculation answered: potentates
vied with each other in throwing sops to this Cerberus, whose
own life as a man, like, we fear, that of most other satirists,
was as obnoxious to censure as any of those he unscrupulously
attacked.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1682.

Although the following short passage cannot be said to
relate to a siege, yet as it concerns the introduction of an

arm
employed in sieges, particularly such as are maritime,
it becomes our duty to repeat it.

Louis XIV., ever anxious to extend what he and his nation
called his
glory
, turned his attention to the sea. He saw
what the Dutch, Portuguese, Spaniards, and English were
doing; he knew what Venice, Genoa, and other Italian states
had done on that element; and he deemed it inconsistent
with that universal fame to which he aspired, to neglect this
wide field of enterprise. With her coasts, and her possessions
on so many seas, France is legitimately a naval power,
and Colbert was not a minister to leave natural advantages
unemployed. When the reader of history pauses at this
period of the reign of Louis XIV., and contemplates his
grandeur,âwe may say true grandeur,âthe principal thing he
must be struck with is the astonishing influence of one great
master mind. When Mazarin died, he bequeathed Colbert
to Louis XIV., and never did dying minister bestow a richer
treasure upon his master: the portion of their ill-got wealth,
which Richelieu and Mazarin left to Louis XIII. and
Louis XIV., as an indemnity for the rest, was nothing when
compared with a bequest which we strongly suspect the
cunning Italian would not have ventured to make a gift
whilst living: he might avail himself of Colbertâs talents,
and take the credit of their efforts, but he would not have
proposed that he should assume the place while he lived,
which he knew it was for the kingâs interest he should occupy
when he was gone. The date standing at the head of this
466

passage is only one year before the death of Colbert, and of
the decline of all that was great in the reign of Louis XIV.
Mazarin died in 1661, Colbert in 1683; and in these twenty-two
years alone, out of a reign of more than seventy, did
Louis XIV. earn any part of the proud title which is claimed
for him.

Under the auspices of Colbert, Louis had a hundred
ships of the line built, and engaged sixty thousand sailors.
Although he restrained as much as possible these rude men
by stringent laws, he did not think it prudent to let them
remain idle in port. His squadrons, commanded by
Duquesne, swept the seas infested by the pirates of Algiers
and Tunis. To punish Algiers, he employed a new invention.
This fatal but admirable means of destruction was
that of
bomb-vessels
, with which maritime cities may be
reduced to ashes. There was a young man named Bernard
Renaud, known by the name of
Little Renaud
, who, without
having served, had become, by the influence of genius, an
excellent shipbuilder. Colbert, who always knew how to
discern and employ merit wherever he found it, had often
consulted him upon naval affairs, even in the kingâs presence.
It was by the cares and from the intelligence of Renaud
that a better plan of shipbuilding was shortly adopted. He
ventured to propose in council to have Algiers bombarded
by a fleet. Till that time no idea was entertained that
bomb-mortars could be placed upon anything but solid
ground. This proposition appeared ridiculous, and Renaud
met with all the contradictions and railleries that every
inventor must expect; but his firmness, and that eloquence
which men properly impressed with their inventions generally
have, made the king determine to permit a trial of this
novelty. Renaud had some vessels constructed, smaller
than usual, but stronger with regard to wood, without
upper decks, but with a false deck at the bottom of the
hold, upon which hollows were built for the reception of
mortars. He set sail with this preparation, under the orders
of old Duquesne, who was charged with the enterprise, but
who anticipated no success from it. But Duquesne and the
Algerines were equally astonished at the effects of these
bombs; a large part of the city was quickly battered to
pieces and consumed by them.

467

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1683.

Although punished, Algiers soon renewed its brigandages,
and Louis XIV. repeated his chastisement on the 30th of
the following June. Algiers, after being twice bombarded,
sent deputies to ask pardon and sue for peace. They
restored all their Christian slaves to liberty, andâwhich is
the severest punishment for corsairsâpaid a large sum of
money. When DâAmfreville, a naval captain, came to
Algiers to deliver all the Christian slaves, in the name of
the king of France, there were among them many Englishmen,
who, after they were on board, persisted in telling
DâAmfreville that it was out of consideration for the king of
England they were set at liberty. The French captain
called back the Algerines, and replacing the English on
shore, said, âThese people insist upon it that they are set
free in the name of their king; that being the case, my
king cannot take the liberty of offering them his protection:
I restore them to you, and it is for you to show what respect
you owe to the king of England.â The weakness of the
government of Charles II., and the respect in which most
nations then held Louis XIV., are both made evident by
this anecdote.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1689.

Six years after, Marshal DâEtrÃ©es once again bombarded
Algiers, always unfaithful to its treaties, and still supporting
a fearful power by robbery and rapine. Ten thousand bombs
ruined this retreat of corsairs despising the laws of nations;
six of their vessels were sunk in the port. They were thus
taught to respect the French flag, and the liberty of the
seas for great powers; but they did not cease to pillage with
impunity the subjects of weak states, without bombs or
vessels of war to make themselves feared.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1816.

Although the bombardment of Algiers by a naval force
can scarcely be termed a siege, as a conclusion to the above
history, a mention of that which took place under Lord
Exmouth is necessary.

468

Exasperated by many acts of wanton cruelty and daring
piracy on the part of the dey of Algiers, the greatest naval
country took into its hands the chastisement the corsairs
so richly deserved. With a comparatively small force with
what even great commanders had deemed necessary for the
undertaking, Lord Exmouth, by the most judicious management,
seconded by the skill and bravery of his officers and
men, in one short day brought these sanguinary marauders
to an expression of repentance, if not a feeling of it. A
treaty of peace was signed, under a salute of twenty-one
guns, on the following conditions, which had been dictated
by the Prince Regent of
England:â

â1. The abolition for ever of Christian slavery.

â2. The delivery to the admiralâs flag of all slaves in the
dominions of the dey, to whatever nation they may belong,
at noon to-morrow.

â3. To deliver, also to the British admiralâs flag, all money
received by him for the redemption of slaves since the commencement
of this year, at noon also to-morrow.

â4. Reparation has been made to the British consul for
all losses he may have sustained in consequence of his
confinement.

â5. The dey has made a public apology, in presence of his
ministers and officers, and begged pardon of the consul, in
terms dictated by the captain of the
Queen Charlotte
.â

The killed and wounded in this great settling-day between
civilization and barbarism, amounted to between 6,000
and 7,000 on the part of the Algerines, and to 141 killed
and 742 wounded on the side of the British and Dutch.

The bombardment of Algiers is deemed important as a
military experiment, proving the efficacy of ship artillery
against stone fortifications; but the distance, and the nature
of the sea, must never be forgotten in such calculations: the
season was the most favourable possible as regarded the
weather, and Lord Exmouth was enabled to bring his vessels
within fifty yards of the Mole, into which he poured his
destructive thunders. If Cronstadt had been as favourably
circumstanced in these respects as Algiers, we feel confident
Sir Charles Napier would not have come âbootless home.â

The operations of the French, in their war of conquest in
Algiers, do not come within the scope of our plan.

469

VALENCIENNES.

A.D. 1557.

Philip II.
, king of Spain, son and successor to the
emperor Charles V., who from the depths of his cabinet,
like another Tiberius, shook all Europe with his often cruel
policy, wishing to stop the rapid progress of Lutheranism
in the provinces of Flanders, put weapons into the hands of
executioners, and endeavoured to establish the Inquisition
in those happy and tranquil countries. This barbarous
tribunal, conforming so little with Scriptural precepts and
mildness, disgusted the Flemings, and gave birth to that
famous confederation, at the head of which was William of
Nassau, surnamed the Taciturn, prince of Orange. All the
confederates were clothed in grey, wore upon their caps
little wooden porringers, and round their necks a medal,
upon one side of which was the portrait of the king, and on
the reverse a
wallet
suspended from two hands, crossed and
pressed together in sign of faith, with this inscription:
â
Faithful to the king and to the wallet.
â This was in
allusion to the name of beggars, which the count of Barlemont
had given them. They exhibited themselves in this
guise before Marguerite of Austria, duchess of Parma and
gouvernante of the Netherlands. They presented, in a
manner sufficiently humble, a petition to this princess, in
which they asked for liberty of conscience, and the revocation
of the edict which established the Holy Office. An
answer to these prayers was eluded, and the yoke of the
Protestants, and even of the Catholics, was made so intolerably
heavy, that the people in all parts prepared for revolt.
The inhabitants of Valenciennes were the first to raise the
standard; they were almost all Huguenots, and had intimate
connections with what are called the heretics of
France. The gouvernante charged the seigneur de Noircarmes,
commanding in Hainault, to establish a sufficient
470

garrison in Valenciennes to restrain the audacity of the
burgesses. Noircarmes preferred employing mildness; before
he approached the walls of the city, he agreed to
undertake nothing, if the public exercise of heresy were
proscribed. The people consented to this, but retracted the
moment after. Noircarmes presenting himself at the gates,
for the purpose of entering the city and completing the
agreement, one of the populace had the temerity to shut
the gates in his face, and to drive him from them by a discharge
of arquebuses. Valenciennes was then declared to
be in a state of rebellion, and its siege was commanded.
The news soon spread. Some French Huguenots immediately
flew to the aid of the proscribed city, and these
were soon followed by three thousand foot and a few horse,
got together in the nearest cantons of Flanders. These
troops, provided with several pieces of cannon, advanced
under the orders of John Soreas, who had assembled them.
Noircarmes immediately got together a few companies of
infantry, with some horse, and set forward to combat this
rash and inexperienced body of soldiers. Their defeat was
the work of a moment: Soreas perished in the action, and
his followers were massacred. Some in vain attempted to
find refuge in Tournay; the peasants of the neighbourhood
pursued and dispersed them. Noircarmes, animated by
this success, after having subdued Tournay, advanced
towards Valenciennes. The rebels, still obstinate, rejected
all his propositions with disdain, and he was therefore forced
to think seriously of besieging the city. He quickly established
a formidable battery, which destroyed the ramparts,
and spread terror and despair among the besieged. They
had expected powerful assistance, but, frustrated in their
hopes, their courage was changed into consternation, and
after several rude attacks they surrendered at discretion.
Noircarmes imposed such laws as the gouvernante dictated.
The submission of Valenciennes for a time depressed the
spirits of the confederates, and the vigorous government of
Marguerite seemed to prognosticate obedience; but the
glorious results of these beginnings are of the best and
most instructive pages of history.

471

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1667.

One of the greatest military exploits of Louis XIV. was
the conquest of Valenciennes. Since the wars which had
procured liberty for Holland, the possessors of that city had
neglected nothing to render it impregnable. The project of
the French monarch was considered as the height of temerity.
In the first place, it was necessary to gain possession
of two half-moons on the right and on the left. Behind
these half-moons was a grand crown-work, palisaded,
frased (strengthened with pointed stakes), and surrounded
by a fosse intersected by many traverses. In this crown-work
there was yet a second, well covered and surrounded
with another fosse. After these had been mastered, there
was an arm of the Scheld to be crossed; this being done, a
fresh work was encountered, called a
pÃ¢tÃ©
; behind this pÃ¢tÃ©
flowed the great stream of the Scheld, deep and rapid, which
served as a fosse between the pÃ¢tÃ© and the wall; and this
wall was supported by large ramparts. All these works
were covered with cannon. A garrison of nearly four thousand
men, a great quantity of munitions of war and provisions,
the hatred of the citizens for the French and their
affection for their Spanish governor, seemed to promise a
long and firm resistance. At the head of a formidable army,
Louis XIV. advanced, seconded by his brother and the
marshals HumiÃ¨res, Schomberg, Feuillade, Luxembourg,
and Lorges. The celebrated Vauban directed all the
operations. On the 9th of March, 1677, they opened the
trenches. A few days after, the king called a council
upon the best means of attacking the outworks with greatest
regard to the lives of the soldiers. Vauban proposed to
assault them in open day; but all the marshals exclaimed
strongly against such a plan: Louvois condemned it, and
yet Vauban held firm to his opinion, with the confidence of a
man perfectly understanding all he advanced. âYou wish,â
said he, âto spare the blood of your soldiers, and this will be
best effected by fighting in the daylight, without confusion
and without tumult, without fear of one part of our men
firing upon another, as too frequently happens. Our object
is to surprise the enemy; and they are always in expectation
of an attack by night: we shall indeed surprise them when
472

they will be fatigued by watching all night, and they will
not be in a condition to resist our fresh troops. Add to
this, there may be men among our soldiers who have but
little courage, and night will favour their timidity; whereas,
during the day, the eye of the master inspires valour and
elevates men, particularly the French, above themselves.â
The king yielded to the reasoning of Vauban, in opposition
to his minister Louvois and five marshals of France.

On the evening of the 16th, the two companies of musketeers,
a hundred grenadiers of the kingâs household, a
battalion of the guards, and one of the regiment of Picardy,
were commanded to be in readiness, and on the 17th, at nine
oâclock in the morning, these warriors marched to the attack
of the crown-work, after having overcome the two advanced
half-moons. Nothing seemed able to resist them: they
mounted the intrenchments in all directions; they seized
them; they effected a lodgment. This was all that had been
required or hoped for in this attack; but the valour of the
musketeers was warmed, and could not be checked. There
was across the small arm of the Scheld, a bridge, which
communicated with the pÃ¢tÃ©. The passage over this bridge
was closed by a barrier of immense pieces of pointed timber,
with a wicket in the middle, through which only one man
could pass at a time. Whilst one party of the musketeers
was endeavouring to force the wicket, the rest climbed over
the barrier, and in spite of pikes and musketry, leaped down
on the other side, sword in hand. The enemy, surprised by
this extraordinary feat, abandoned the defence of the wicket.
The musketeers pursued them, and on reaching the pÃ¢tÃ©,
attacked it with great fury, and carried it in spite of its
defenders; but the cannon of the ramparts now threatened
destruction to the conquerors. The grey musketeers perceived
a little door; they broke it in, and discovered a private
staircase constructed in the thickness of the wall; they
rushed up this narrow passage and arrived at the top of the
pÃ¢tÃ©. They there remarked another door, which gave entrance
to a gallery built over the great canal of the Scheld.
They broke that in; they gained the ramparts, and intrenched
themselves. They then turned against the city the
cannon they found there, and, sheltered from their thunders,
descended into the place with the fugitives. They pursued
473

them from intrenchment to intrenchment, from street to
street; and they triumphed before the king could have imagined
the first work they attacked was taken. But this was
not the most astonishing part of this marvellous affair. It
was probable that young musketeers, carried away by the
ardour of success, should rush blindly upon the troops and
the citizensâthat they would perish, or that the city would
be plundered; but these warriors, scarcely adolescent, led
by a cornet named Moissac and a quarter-master named
Labarre, formed behind some waggons, and whilst the troops,
which came in crowds, were forming leisurely, other musketeers
got possession of some neighbouring houses, in order
to protect by their fire those who defended the bridge with
incredible bravery. They were three times charged by the
cavalry of the garrison; but notwithstanding the smallness
of their numbers, they maintained all they had won. The
infantry endeavoured to take them in rear, but they there
encountered the greater part of the black musketeers and
the grenadiers of the kingâs household, who repulsed them
vigorously. The citizens were astonished; the city council
assembled. They entered into a parley with Moissac, who
received and gave hostages. Deputies were sent to the
king; and all this was done without confusion, without
tumult, and without the commission of a fault of any kind.
The city was obliged to submit without capitulation. The
king made the garrison prisoners of war, and entered Valenciennes,
to his own great surprise, as master. This conquest
only cost him forty men. âI do not know,â says Larrey,
âif history furnishes many examples of an action so sharp
and prompt, and at the same time so fortunate, and of the
capture, in so short a time and with so little loss for the
conquerors, of a great and strong city which wanted nothing
for its defence. The whole looks like a miracle; and all was
attributed to the fortunate rashness of the musketeers.â
âIt was fortunate,â adds M. de St. Foix, âbecause coolness
and prudence completed that which impetuous courage
had begun. Everything in this affair is characteristic of
true valour, that valour which elevates man above himself,
and which often makes him triumph against all probability,
and in spite of the evident danger into which he seems to
precipitate himself.â

474

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1793.

In this siege the English have an interest, the duke of
York, second son of George III., having had the command
of the besiegers.

The allies, having taken CondÃ© in the month of April,
directed their forces against Valenciennes. General Ferrand
commanded in the place, with a garrison of nine thousand
men. To favour the siege, the allies posted an army of
observation in the plains of HÃ©rin, in front of the city, a
strong force on the other side of Valenciennes, and a third
between Lille and Tournay. At the moment that city was
invested, these faubourgs were attacked; that named Marli
was set fire to on the 24th of May, and taken the day following.
The allies opened the attack very close to the place.
The duke of York summoned the city on the 14th of June.
The governor replied: âThe garrison and myself will sooner
bury ourselves beneath the ruins than surrender the city.â
The bombardment instantly commenced. When the Tournay
side was in ashes, the allies transported their bombs to
the south-west, and then the conflagration became general;
there seemed to be no wish entertained to preserve either
the walls or fortifications. An opinion was general in the
city, that destruction rather than conquest was the object of
the allies, and despair became more tenacious than courage.
During the conflagration, the fire caught the arsenal,
which blew up. Treachery was suspected, and the subdirector
of the artillery, Monestier, destroyed himself. The
object of this was to raise the inhabitants, which it succeeded
in doing; but order was quickly restored by the two representative
commissioners. The works of the besiegers came
up to the walls by the 21st of July. A breach was made in
the bastion called the Huguenots, and a first assault upon
the covered way was repulsed. There was a second on the
26th, whilst the allies, with another body of ten thousand
men, assaulted in a different point, in which they gained
possession of an advanced work, which was blown up by
three mines. The fire drove them from the ramparts, and
the work was retaken; but a panic seized upon the garrison,
they became deaf to the voices of their officers, rushed
pÃªle-mÃªle

into the city, and nothing could bring them back to the
475

advanced work, which had been retaken and abandoned by
both parties. At this time, the duke of York addressed a
proclamation to the inhabitants and the soldiers, whilst he
sent a second to the municipality and the general. From
that moment the disorder was irreparable; the assembled
inhabitants, supported by the soldiers, compelled the council
of war to enter into a capitulation: it was signed on the
28th of July. The companies of the cannoniers of Douai
and Valenciennes alone took no part in this riot: they had
served with distinction. The allies lost a great many men
in the sieges of CondÃ©, Cateau Cambresis, and Valenciennes.

LEYDEN.

A.D. 1574.

We
offer as long a sketch of the siege of Leyden as our
limits will allow, this being a portion of history to which we
always turn with pleasure: the emancipation of the Netherlands
from the domination of Spain is one of the most noble
efforts in the annals of mankind.

The cruelties of the duke of Alva had alienated every heart
in Holland from the court of Spain, and had left none but
harsh means to his successor, Don Louis, of retaining the
provinces in their allegiance. Being desirous of distinguishing
his accession to power by a bold stroke, he sent Francis
Valdes to besiege Leyden. The environs of this city, intersected
in all directions by canals, presented incredible difficulties
to the making of the approaches. Our readers will
perceive this the more clearly when we state that it had
eight gates, fifty islands, and one hundred and forty-five
bridges, mostly built of freestone. The rapid waters of the
Rhine, which bathe its walls, assist in rendering Leyden
impregnable. Valdes had already been frequently repulsed
in his attacks, when Count Louis, entering Flanders, brought
him a formidable army. Valdes then once more presented
himself before Leyden, and regularly blockaded it. The
Hollanders, having fortified all the passages capable of retarding
the progress of the enemy, strengthened with troops
476

the village of Alful, which was built upon a canal, whose
sluices could stop or suspend the course of the waters; a
sanguinary battle was necessary to make himself master of
this point. Possessed of the neighbouring fortifications, the
Spanish general pressed Leyden very closely. Having a
belief that there was no garrison, the Spaniards threw letters
into the place, to persuade the inhabitants to surrender:
they received an answer over the walls, âthat they must
not expect anything of the kind as long as they could hear
the dogs of Leyden bark.â Resolved to defend their country
to the last extremity, the besieged made a furious sortie, and
attacked the garrison of the fort of Lamene; but their impetuosity
could not resist the numbers of the Spaniards,
and they were obliged to return to their walls. This check
did not in the least diminish their courage; they repaired
the walls of Leyden, and exhausted the resources of art to
create defences. Jean VanderdoÃ«s, a poet known in literature
by the name of
Janus Douza
, commanded in the city;
and, notwithstanding his possession of talents so opposite to
such a task, performed his difficult duties admirably. He
animated and supported his fellow-citizens amidst pressing
dangers. Notwithstanding his cares, there was a moment of
dissatisfaction. The people, in a seditious manner, demanded
food of their leaders; the governor answered coolly, âthat
it was perfectly indifferent to him whether he died by their
hands or those of the Spaniards; that if his flesh would
satisfy them, they were welcome to tear him to pieces and
eat him.â These words overwhelmed the murmurers with
confusion. The Seigneur de Ligne, governor of Harlem,
exhorted them to submit to the conditions offered by the
king of Spain; but the inhabitants replied: âWe know that
the project of the Spaniards is to subdue Leyden by famine;
but we are not afraid of that. When we have consumed all
our provisions, we will eat our left arms and defend ourselves
with the right against our tyrants; death is a thousand times
preferable to their odious despotism.â After this declaration,
a paper currency was fabricated, with this inscription:
â
For Liberty.
â This currency was faithfully exchanged for
money when the siege was terminated. But famine made
frightful ravages; and, if not promptly succoured, Leyden
must succumb. The States of Holland assembled, and after
477

long and earnest deliberation, it was resolved to inundate
the province. In the beginning of August, two dykes of the
Meuse and the Yssel were cut, between Rotterdam and
Gonda. In an instant, the smiling fields in the neighbourhood
of Delft, Gonda, Rotterdam, and Leyden were covered
with water. The Spaniards were astonished, but their forts
secured them, and the place remained besieged. The Hollanders
were anxious at least to take advantage of the
waters to convey provisions into Leyden; they constructed
boats in the shape of galleys, with oars, so that they might
the more easily force passages, and attack the forts of the
Spaniards. The Dutch admiral Boizot endeavoured to
break through the blockade and convey provisions into
Leyden, but the waters were not sufficiently high, except in
the rivers and lakes, which were well guarded, and he could
not approach the city. The Dutch waited with impatience
for the high tides, upon which the deliverance of the province
seemed to depend. Whilst the Spaniards were constantly
employed in securing their redoubts from inundation, by
closing up all their issues with earth and hay, the overflowing
ocean came rushing in in all its power, swept away these
feeble barriers, and made the environs of Leyden one vast
sea. The Hollanders immediately set sail; a fleet of a
hundred and fifty vessels, laden with provisions, advanced in
the best order, and surmounted every obstacle. The terrified
Spaniards retired to places of safety, but, in spite of all their
celerity, they could not evacuate their redoubts without
losing a great number of people. Driven from their fortifications
by the waters, and pursued by the enemy, some were
massacred, and the rest swallowed up by the waves. Strada
relates that a Spanish captain was seized by his clothes, with
long hooks, and made a prisoner, and thrown into a bark. This
bold man took advantage of the crew being engaged, sprang
up, seized a halbert, killed three of the Dutch soldiers, forced
the others to save themselves by swimming, and regained
his companions, with the bark and the provisions it contained.
The Spaniards lost fifteen hundred men in this
retreat from the waters. Leyden enjoyed the satisfaction
of being delivered from present dangers, but this was sadly
embittered by the recollection of having lost six thousand
citizens by famine and misery, during the blockade.

478

LIVRON.

A.D. 1574.

We
present this little siege as a monument of the feeling
entertained towards the infamous Catherine de Medici
and her darling son, Henry III., by many communities in
France.

When Henry III. left Poland as a fugitive, to occupy the
throne made vacant by the death of Charles IX., he created
Roger de St. Lary-Bellegarde, one of his minions, a marshal
of France. A short time after his promotion, the new general
was repulsed in three assaults which he made upon Livron,
a small Huguenot fortified place in Dauphiny, although he
attacked it with a good army, and it was defended but by a
few inhabitants. The women of the city thought him so
contemptible, that, to insult him, they plied their distaffs
on the breach. Henry, who passed near the city, stopped
for a few hours, to display his valour. The besieged, on
learning his arrival, made a general discharge of their artillery,
which they followed by continual hissings and hootings,
accompanied by cutting railleries against the monarch and
the queen his mother. âHa! ha! you massacrers! you
shall not poniard us in our beds, as you did the admiral!
Bring us a few of your laced, ruffled, and perfumed minions;
let them come and look at our women; they will see if they
look like a prey to be easily taken!â Henry ordered a fresh
assault to be made, but it was repulsed by the women
only, and the siege was raised shortly after this disgraceful
defeat.

479

CAHORS.

A.D. 1580.

Of
the numerous sieges on both sides which marked the
struggle of Henry IV. of France for his crown, we have
selected that of Cahors as best displaying the character of
that hero and the men and times he lived in.

Henry IV., whilst king of Navarre, resolved to gain possession
of Cahors. That city is surrounded on all sides by
the river Lot, which serves it as a fosse. It had a garrison
of two thousand men, and Vesins, its governor, was a soldier
of acknowledged valour and great experience. Its citizens,
always armed, were never off their guard. Henry assembled
his council of war, composed of valiant and tried captains,
and all pronounced the enterprise hazardous. Their representations
were useless. âEverything is possible to me,â
said he, âwith men as brave as those I consult.â On the
5th of May, he set out from Montauban, in excessively hot
weather, and arrived in the middle of the night within a
quarter of a league of Cahors. His troops there quenched
their thirst at a fountain which flowed under a nursery
of young walnut-trees. Twelve soldiers marched forward
for the purpose of fastening a petard to the gates of the city.
Fifty men, commanded by Captain Saint Martin, followed
them closely; Roquilaure came next, with forty gentlemen
and sixty soldiers; and after them, Henry of Navarre, with
nine hundred men. Twelve hundred arquebusiers, in six
platoons, closed the march. There were three gates to be
forced. The petard attached to the first made so small an
opening, that it was necessary to enlarge it with axes. The
first passed through with difficulty; but the soldiers who
followed them had time to file through in sufficiently great
numbers. A furious storm which raged at the time did not
permit the inhabitants to distinguish between the noise of
the thunder and the report of the petards, which had broken
480

down their gates. Henryâs soldiers, on first entering the
city, met with forty men and two hundred arquebusiers,
almost naked. The baron de Salignac cut them to pieces,
and advanced into Cahors; but he was stopped in his march
by the inhabitants, who, from the tops of the houses, hurled
stones, tiles, pieces of wood, and other missiles upon the
heads of his soldiers. In the mean time, the king of Navarre
entered Cahors by another gate, with which the petard had
succeeded better. At length day appeared, persons and
objects were distinguishable, and all either rushed to the
attack or stood firm in defence of the place. In all the
streets it became necessary to force barricades and repulse
a garrison much more numerous than the besiegers. Henry
commanded and fought everywhere at the same time; his
valour shrunk from no danger, though the blows of all the
enemies seemed to be directed against him. He broke two
partisans, and his armour was pierced in twenty places.
This terrible combat lasted five days and five nights. The
besieged, in full expectation of assistance, said not a word
about surrendering. The assailants, fatigued with the weight
of their armour and the excessive heat, maintained their
posts with the intrepid courage their leader knew how to
inspire. On the fourth day they learnt that the succours
promised to the city were drawing near. At this news, his
captains assembled round Henry, and conjured him to secure
a retreat before the enemy could reach Cahors. Henry, too
courageous to know what fear meant, and heedless of the
pain caused by his wounds, replied, with that coolness which
inspires confidence: âIt is decreed above what is to become
of me on this occasion. Remember that my retreat from
this city without having taken it, will be the retreat of my
life from my body. My honour is too deeply pledged to
allow me to act otherwise; therefore, only speak to me of
fighting, conquering, or dying.â Reanimated by these
words, his soldiers made fresh efforts; and fortune seconded
the efforts of the brave BÃ©arnais. He received a reinforcement
of a hundred horse and five hundred arquebusiers; he
secured his posts in the interior, and marched out to meet
the approaching enemy. He repulsed them; and on his
return to the city, the inhabitants having lost all hope, laid
down their arms. There were but few killed in Henryâs
481

army, but many wounded. The brave and virtuous Vesins
had perished early in the contest; he had a short time before
done himself great honour, by an act of rare generosity.
His bravery, degenerating sometimes into ferocity, had made
him numerous enemies; among these was a gentleman
named RÃ©gnier, of a mild and polished character. Their
neighbours and friends had exerted themselves in vain to
reconcile them. RÃ©gnier was a Huguenot, and Vesins a
Catholic. Whilst the cities of France were being stained with
the blood of Huguenots, RÃ©gnier retired to Cahors for safety.
But the king had made Vesins governor of that city, and
RÃ©gnier was living in daily expectation of being sacrificed to
the vengeance of his enemy, when his door was broken open,
and he saw Vesins, with a drawn sword in his hand, and with
the appearance of furious rage, enter, followed by two armed
soldiers. RÃ©gnier, believing his death certain, fell upon his
knees and implored the mercy of Heaven. Vesins in a
menacing voice ordered him to get up, follow him, and
mount a horse that was standing at the door. RÃ©gnier left
the city with his enemy, who conducted him as far as Guienne
without stopping and without speaking a single word to him.
They arrived together at the chÃ¢teau of RÃ©gnier, where
Vesins, without alighting from his horse, said to him: âI
had it in my power, as thou mayst see, to profit by the
opportunity I have been so long in search of; but I should
have been ashamed to avenge myself thus on a man so brave
as thou art; the peril must be equal when our quarrel is
settled; and it is on that account I have spared thy life.
Thou shalt always find me as disposed to terminate our
differences in a manner suitable to gentlemen, as thou hast
found me prompt to deliver thee from an inevitable death.â
âI have no longer, my dear Vesins,â replied RÃ©gnier,
âeither resolution, strength, or courage against you. Your
kindness has extinguished the heat of my enmity: it is
destroyed by your generosity, which I can never forget. I
will henceforward follow you whithersoever you go; I will
be always ready to employ in your service the life you have
given me, and the little bravery you attribute to me.â RÃ©gnier
wished to embrace his benefactor; but Vesins, preserving
all the asperity of his character, said: âIt is thy business
to see whether thou art my friend or my enemy; I only
482

saved thy life to put thee in a condition to make a choice.â
Without waiting for a reply, he put spurs to his horse, leaving
RÃ©gnier, stupified with this strange adventure, to wonder
at the greatness of soul and generosity of him whom he had
considered as his most cruel enemy.

ANECDOTE OF VESINS AND RÃGNIER.

MAESTRICHT.

Maestricht
, a city of the Netherlands, about four miles
in circumference, seated on the Meuse, opposite Wyck, with
which it communicates by a stone bridge, was looked upon
as one of the strongest fortified places in Europe, and, from
the importance of its position, has endured several remarkable
sieges.

FIRST SIEGE, A.D. 1576.

The inhabitants of Maestricht, in concert with their German
garrison, drove out the Spaniards in 1576. Their
intention was to unite themselves with the Dutch, who had
shaken off the yoke of Spain. Vargos, the general of
Philip II., hastened to endeavour to regain possession of the
place; of which he had the greater hopes from being still
master of Wyck. The conquered, humiliated by a disgrace
of which they were the more sensible from its having arisen
out of their own negligence, were eager to repair their fault
by instantly taking back what they had lost. As they saw
no other obstacle to their doing so but some pieces of cannon
placed upon the bridge which unites the two cities, they
formed, to avoid this danger, a most extraordinary resolution.
They placed before them all the women of Wyck. Provided
with this rampart, they advanced over the bridge, and,
covered with these singular bucklers, they fired boldly and
safely upon the citizens, who, not being able to defend themselves
without shooting their relations, or at least the women
of their party, quitted their post, took refuge in their houses,
and abandoned the field of battle to the Spaniards, who
thus remastered the city without receiving a single wound.

But Maestricht again revolted, and freed itself from the
Spanish yoke.

483

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1579.

Three years after the first revolt, this place was invested
by the celebrated prince of Parma, governor of Flanders.
This general, having secured his quarters and encamped in
face of Maestricht, directed a numerous park of artillery
against it. Mondragone was charged with the blockade on
the side of Wyck. In a short time the circumvallation was
secured; and, simultaneously, the Meuse was closed, both
below and above the city, by two bridges of boats, sufficiently
solid to deprive the enemy of all chance of entrance
to the place by water. These bridges served at the same
time as means of communication to the army spread over
both banks of the river. The trenches were opened. The
garrison, being small, could not risk many sorties, but they
made some with success. Two attacks were formed: one at
the Brussels gate, and the other opposite the curtain which
was between the gate of Hoxter and that of the Cross.
When the trenches were sufficiently advanced, Hierges set
his batteries playing. The Spaniards had already arrived at
the counterscarp, and were endeavouring to debouch in the
fosse, to fill it promptly and second the operations of the
artillery. The Brussels gate was defended by a good ravelin
and a large cavalier, which impeded the progress of the
besiegers greatly. It was battered by some pieces of large
cannon; but the audacity of the besieged seemed to increase
with their peril. The Spaniards on their part redoubled
their efforts; their ardour was indefatigable; they emulated
each other in braving dangers. Within the walls, the
citizens and the countrymen who had there sought refuge,
vied with the most practised soldiers in intrepidity. The
women themselves became redoubtable warriors: three
companies of them were formed, one of which was employed
at the counter-mines, and the others did garrison duty.
They appeared on the ramparts by the side of the bravest
soldiers; they cheerfully shared the painful labours of the
pioneers, and entered warmly into the repairs of old fortifications,
or the erection of new ones. The besiegers, however,
remained masters of the fosse, and the breach appeared
sufficiently practicable for an assault to be attempted. A
signal was given for one; but the Spaniards, after making
484

the most courageous efforts, were constrained to retire with
loss. The fire of the batteries increased; the works were
perfected; all sorts of means were employed to prevent the
enemy from repairing the breaches made in the ramparts of
the city. A second assault was prepared. To weaken the
resistance of the Flemings by dividing it, it was resolved to
give the assault at the two attacks. The trumpets sounded;
they rushed to the breaches; the parties met; the contest
began; one side impetuously attacking, the other as firmly
defending: victory remained doubtful; Herle, in the
Spanish ranks, and Tappin, the celebrated defender of
Maestricht, performing prodigies of valour. It was a hand-to-hand
fight,âpike to pike, and sword to sword. Some
barrels of powder caught fire, and blew up; in an instant
the ground was covered with mutilated bodies. The combat
ceased, and the besiegers were obliged to retreat, without
having been able to gain possession of the breach. This
fruitless attempt cost the Spaniards very dear. But the
greater part of the garrison had perished upon the walls, and
the remainder were in want of everything. Disease, fatigue,
watching, and famine, made awful ravages. No more confidence
could be placed in the succours promised by the prince
of Orange; and the inhabitants, determined to die rather
than surrender, had no resource but their bravery. The
ravelin which covered the Brussels gate annoying the
besiegers greatly, the prince of Parma determined to make
himself master of it. He ordered some fresh mines, and on
the 24th of June succeeded in winning it. The prince,
profiting by this advantage, caused the large cavalier constructed
at this point to be raised much higher, and turned
the fire against the place. The besieged, being without
repose and finding safety nowhere, began to despair of holding
out, without, however, being at all willing to subscribe
to the honourable capitulation offered them by the prince.
That general fell sick; the siege appeared to suffer by the
circumstance, and the attacks became weaker. In consequence
of this, the exhausted citizens relaxed in their vigilance.
The prince, who from his bed was still watchful,
learnt how matters stood, and immediately ordered an assault.
On the morning of the day designed for this last effort, a
soldier having crept through an ill-repaired breach, found no
485

one on the walls but some sentinels buried in sleep. He
informed the general of this. The troops were commanded
to follow him: the breach was mounted, and the city taken.
The carnage was so frightful, that scarcely four hundred persons
were spared. The life of the brave Tappin, the governor
of Maestricht, was however saved, out of respect for his
character. The besiegers lost two thousand five hundred
men; but a booty of a million of crowns of gold, and the
conquest of an important city, compensated for their fatigues
and perils.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1632.

In 1632 Maestricht was reduced by the prince of Orange,
and was confirmed to the Dutch in 1648.

FOURTH SIEGE, A.D. 1673.

On the 10th of June, Louis XIV. appeared before
Maestricht with an army of forty thousand men. This
place, esteemed one of the keys of the Netherlands and the
United Provinces, was defended by a garrison of five thousand
men, and by an intrepid governor, named Farjaux, a
Frenchman by birth, but in the service of Holland. On
the 17th the trenches were opened, and five batteries were
directed against the city. Vauban, who in this siege first distinguished
himself, employed the parallels invented by some
Italian engineers in the service of the Turks, before Candia.
He added places of arms in the trenches, to draw up troops
in battle order, and the better to rally them in the event of
sorties. Louis proved himself, in this famous expedition,
more particular and laborious than he had ever been. By
his example he accustomed a nation till that time accused
of having nothing but a brilliant courage which fatigue
easily exhausted, to patience in labour and endurance in
protracted operations. As long as the siege lasted, he was
up the whole night, from ten oâclock in the evening till five
in the morning. After having ordered everything he thought
necessary for the attack, he retired to his tent to take some
repose till dinner-time. On leaving table, he mounted on
horseback to make the tour of the lines and visit the
quarters: in consequence of this, the companions of his
labours went to the assaults and performed their duties in
486

the most exemplary manner. The most furious assault was
that of the 24th of June, and was made at the counterscarp
of the Tongres gate; in it the French and the Dutch were
by turns conquerors and conquered, whilst disputing an
advanced half-moon. The first company of musketeers was
commanded to fall upon this half-moon, whilst the second
precipitated itself upon the palisades between that post and
the hornwork. âThe signal was given,â says M. de Saint-Foix;
âthey marched, and in spite of the vigorous resistance
of the enemy, in spite of the fire of the
fourneaux

which were sprung, and the terrible reports of the grenades
which were incessantly cast among them, these works were
carried almost at the same moment.â Four bloody conflicts
were necessary; and they only triumphed in the last,
after losing many men. Night separated the combatants.
The action of the morrow was still more warm and murderous;
it was believed that the lodgments were secured,
and the musketeers had returned to the camp. The enemy
sprang a
fourneau
, which the French had not discovered,
in the half-moon: there was reason to think it was not the
only one. Farjaux, who had placed himself at the head of
the best troops of his garrison, profiting by this moment of
alarm, entered the work and drove out the French soldiers.
The musketeers were ordered to take it again, and they did
retake it. In an obstinate and sanguinary conflict, fifty-three
musketeers were wounded and thirty-seven killed,
with the famous count dâArtagnan, commander of the first
company. âThe musketeers who returned from this fight,â
says Pelisson, âhad all their swords blooded up to the
guards, and bent and notched with the blows they had
given.â So many repeated and terrible attacks destroyed
the defenders of Maestricht without weakening the courage
of the survivors. Farjaux in particular was determined to
hold out to the last minute; he preferred a glorious death
to life at the hands of a conqueror, and he formed the resolution
of making one more attempt. A mine was dug, and
set fire to with too much precipitation; the soldiers of
Farjaux were blown up by it instead of the French. This
accident so completely disconcerted the besieged, that even
their bold governor was forced to think of composition.
They were satisfied, on the 29th of June, with a favourable
487

capitulation. The remains of the garrison retired with the
honours of war, and the inhabitants retained their privileges.
This conquest cost France nearly eight thousand men; the
besieged lost more than three thousand.

FIFTH SIEGE, A.D. 1676.

Louis XIV., aware of the importance of his victory,
placed in the city a garrison of six thousand foot and twelve
hundred horse. Three years after, the prince of Orange laid
siege to Maastricht with an army of twenty-five thousand
men, whilst the duke of Villa-Hermosa on one side, and the
count de Waldeck on the other, intrenched in advantageous
posts, watched the operations of the French, and held themselves
in readiness to prevent their succouring the besieged.
The count de Calvo commanded in Maestricht, in the absence
of Marshal dâEstrades, the governor. This officer was
a Catalan, in the service of France; the king had not a braver
soldier; but as he had all his life served in the cavalry, he was
thought to be more in his place at the head of a squadron of
horse than of a garrison. As soon as the place was invested,
he assembled the principal officers: âGentlemen,â said he,
âI have served all my life as a cavalry officer, and have very
little acquaintance with the defence of cities. All that I
know is that I will never surrender. Concert among you
the means of an obstinate and insurmountable resistance,
and I will undertake to have them executed with as much
vigour as celerity.â The frankness of the commander won
all hearts, and the confidence he placed in his subalterns
elevated and expanded their minds. There was established,
without pride, mistrust, or jealousy, a communication of
ideas which saved the city, and which places the name of
Calvo among the few that will descend to posterity.

Calvo made a vigorous and considerable sortie, the commencement
of which was fortunate. The prince of Orange,
informed of what was going on in the trenches, flew to the
succour of his people with the greatest courage, drove back
the French with the sword to their gates, and being wounded
in the arm, exclaimed to those who had fought without spirit,
âThis is the way you should act, gentlemen! It is you
who have caused the wound for which you appear to entertain
488

so much regret.â Calvo first introduced the use of
back-handled scythes; his soldiers, armed with these in the
sorties, killed three men at a stroke. The trenches were
opened on the 19th of July, and the batteries were erected
on the 22nd: during eight days the firing never ceased.
At length a large breach was made in the Dauphin bastion,
and an assault was ordered for the 30th. It was terrible,
but proved useless. The Dutch retired with loss. The
next day the prince of Orange ordered a second attack, still
more sanguinary and quite as unsuccessful. A suspension
of arms was then entered into to bury the dead. Not at
all discouraged, the prince gave a third assault, and succeeded
in gaining the bastion. Scarcely had he gained a
lodgment, when the French sprang two mines, the bursting
of which they followed up by a furious sortie: they were,
however, repulsed, and the work remained in the hands of
the Dutch. Some days after they took another bastion, and
drew near to the counterscarp. Whilst the Hollanders were
preparing to pour their thunders upon this part of the fortifications,
the powder and grenades of the besieged were
suddenly set fire to. Taking advantage of the consequent
disorder, the enemy gained possession of the counterscarp:
they then prepared to attack the hornwork. Twice they
gave the assault, and twice they were driven back with loss.
The dragoons and the cavalry having dismounted to sustain
the infantry, discouraged by so many repulses, a third effort
was made. It was so terrible that the covered way was
choked with dead bodies, and the blood of the slaughtered
discoloured the waters of the fosse. But the assailants
were forced to regain their former posts, after having lost a
host of soldiers.

But now news was brought that Marshal Schomberg was
hastening to the succour of the place, and the prince of
Orange, having already lost twelve thousand men, did not
think it prudent to wait for him. He decamped in the
night of the 26th of August, after forty days of open
trenches, and, to make the more haste, embarked thirty
pieces of cannon, five hundred wounded, and a great
quantity of munitions on the Meuse. At daybreak, the
garrison perceiving the retreat of the Dutch, pursued them,
and took some prisoners.

489

SIXTH SIEGE, A.D. 1748.

âPeace is in Maestricht,â said the Marshal de Saxe. It
was with preparations for this siege that the campaign of
1748 commenced. It was necessary to secure all the passages,
to force an army to retreat, to render it powerless for
action, to deceive the enemy, and leave his own troops in
ignorance of his secret. Marshal Saxe succeeded in all
this; he only communicated his views to M. de Cremille;
he made the allies believe that his object was Buda, and he
went, at the head of twenty-five thousand men, to conduct
a convoy to Bergen-op-Zoom, feigning to turn his back
towards Maestricht. Three divisions advanced upon Tirlemont,
Tongres, and Luxembourg; and at length all four
took their route towards Maestricht. The enemy quitted
their posts precipitately, abandoned immense magazines,
and knew nothing of the designs of the count de Saxe until
it was too late to oppose them. The city was invested,
without a possibility of any succour being introduced. The
siege was pushed on with vigour. The baron dâAylva, the
governor, and the count de Marshal commanding the
Austrian garrison, displayed in vain all their skill to dispute
the ground, and drive back the besiegers. They were on
the point of submitting to the conqueror, when a courier,
despatched by the duke of Cumberland, came to announce
the cessation of hostilities, and to confirm the saying of
Marshal Saxe with which we commenced this article.

There is scarcely a siege on record which does not convey
a lesson to students in the military art, even to experienced
generals, and above all to kings or ministers directing a warâthe
lesson in this is secrecy before the attempt: had
Maurice de Saxe told all the world what was the object of
his preparations, he might as well have attempted to besiege
the moon as Maestricht.

Maestricht was besieged in vain by the French, under
Meranda, in 1793, but yielded to the troops of that country,
commanded by Kleber, in 1794, after eleven days of open
trenches.

490

ANTWERP.

The
great commercial city of Antwerp has been several
times subjected to sieges, of two of which only we think it
necessary to offer any details.

FIRST SIEGE, A.D. 1583.

The Netherlands, tired of the Spanish domination, made
the false step of getting rid of one evil by adopting another
quite as bad, and elected as their sovereign Francis of
France, who, known as the duke dâAlenÃ§on, had recently
assumed the title of duke dâAnjou. The worthy brother of
Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry III.âthe son of
Catherine de Mediciâthe duke of Anjou, might have been
thought the last prince to be selected for the purpose of
reigning over a people so situated as the Netherlanders were;
but France was the enemy of Spain, was the most powerful
neighbour they had, and the wily Catherine and wicked
Henry III. were liberal in their promises.

Very little satisfied with the name of leader and a limited
authority, the duke of Anjou soon made an effort to throw
off the yoke of the States, and to reign as monarch. His
first design was to gain possession of the citadel of Antwerp.
On the 17th of January, 1583, he left his palace early in
the morning, followed by several Frenchmen on horseback,
and passed out of the city, by the gate of St. James. He
had scarcely left the city, when those who accompanied him
pretended to quarrel among themselves, and fell sword in
hand upon the
corps de garde
, the soldiers of which they
massacred, or put to flight, and, at the same time, seized
upon that gate. All the citizens of that quarter hastened
to the spot, whilst the French took possession of the
Emperorâs gate, and of the curtain which was between those
two entrances. The troops who had been left in the city,
ran through the streets, exclaiming: âThe city is won! the
491

city is won! Vive la Messe! Vive la Messe!â which was
their rallying cry. Fifteen ensigns of foot and ten cornets
of horse came to their assistance. The Swiss were approaching
likewise. But an accident they might have prevented,
disconcerted the enterprise. They had forgotten to take
possession of the portcullis of the St. James gate; and the
citizens, on perceiving this omission, rushed to the top of it,
let it down, and thus impeded the entrance of the French.
The whole people took up arms, every man became a soldier.
The enraged citizens combined instantly to drive out an
enemy who aimed at their property and their lives. So
much in earnest were they, that they took the money from
their purses, and moulded or cut it into bullets with their
teeth, and loaded their guns with it. The women disputed
with the men the glory of defending their country. The
disconcerted French were surrounded, pursued, and completely
routed. In vain the duke endeavoured to withdraw
them from the rage of the Flemings: they were all killed,
wounded, or taken prisoners. Fifteen hundred were left on
the field of battle; among whom were persons of the most
illustrious houses in France: the Flemings did not lose a
hundred men.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1585.

This is considered one of the most remarkable sieges of
modern times, from its cause, the parties concerned, the
events, and the result.

The prince of Parma presented himself, in 1585, before
Antwerp, at the head of a powerful army. His operations
commenced by the attack of the forts of Lillo and Liestenstoech,
constructed by the Dutch upon the banks of the
Scheld. The Italians conceived a stratagem which very
much facilitated the capture of this last fort. They got together
a large number of waggons, loaded with green hay, to
which they set fire. The wind carried the smoke directly
towards the fort. Smothered and stifled by this cloud, the
garrison were constrained to draw a little on one side, and
the besiegers taking advantage of this short absence,
mounted the ramparts, and carried the place. The prince
was not so fortunate at Lillo. Mondragone, not having
attacked it briskly enough, allowed a reinforcement to enter,
492

by which six weeks and two thousand men were lost. This
enterprise was abandoned, and the Spaniards contented
themselves with masking the fort on the land side, and
stopping the excursions of the troops who were shut up in it.
The duke next undertook to close the Scheld. In the
month of September, he built two forts, opposite each other;
furnished them with artillery, and then began the construction
of a bridge, in appearance a chimerical project,
but upon which the success of the siege depended. The
Spanish general dug a broad and deep canal, two leagues in
length, to facilitate the transport of materials; this was called
the
Parma Canal
. To animate the labourers, the prince
fixed his quarters in the village of Beversen. The count de
Mansfeld, lieutenant-general, commanded on the Brabant
side, and was encamped at Stabrock. Mondragone was
intrenched on the banks of the river, opposite Lillo, where
he held the enemy in check. On all parts forts were built,
to secure the dykes, and prevent the Dutch from inundating
the country; communication between the city and the neighbouring
places was completely cut off, as was all means of
its receiving succour by the Scheld. The marquis de Roubais
was charged with the construction of the bridge. He exhibited
so much activity in this important work, that a speedy
completion of it was hoped for.

The besieged, terrified at the progress of the Spaniards,
were a prey to the most serious inquietudes. In this wealthy
place, every one trembled for his property, and yet could see
no means of escaping the storm which growled over their
heads. The firmest hearts were shaken. It was given out
that they would no longer sustain a siege which must cost
so much blood and treasure. Roused by this, Sainte-Aldegonde,
the mayor of Antwerp, ventured, though alone, to
combat this resolution. In speeches of fire he revived the
fallen courage of his fellow-citizens, he inspired them with
republican sentiments, and induced them to swear, with a
common voice, an eternal renunciation of the yoke of Philip
of Spain. An edict forbade, under pain of death, the least
approach to accommodation with the royalists. The greatest
ardour was evinced for the defence of their country. To
prolong the means of resistance, provisions were distributed
very economically, and every preparation that could be
493

devised was made to thwart the construction of the fatal
bridge which was to reduce Antwerp.

To prevent or retard this work, and destroy what was
done, several singular vessels were employed, which were to
be filled with fireworks. The redoubts the prince had
built on the banks of the river interfered with the cruises of
the Antwerp frigates; a vessel of enormous size was constructed,
provided with large guns, for the purpose of attacking
them. This immense mass in some sort resembled a
floating fortress. The besieged conceived such magnificent
hopes from this vessel, that they named it
The End of the
War
; a boastful title, of which the skill and activity of the
prince of Parma made the vanity known.

Already the staccadoes, which formed the butments of
each end of the bridge, approached completion, in spite of
the efforts of the citizens, who gave unceasingly brave and
sanguinary battle. In one of these conflicts, Roubais took
Teligny prisoner, a captain equally brave and skilful. The
count of Hohenloe was named in his place. This able officer
did everything possible, both by land and on the Scheld, to
impede the operations of the besiegers. But, notwithstanding
all his efforts, they at length succeeded in procuring a
sufficient number of vessels to close the river in the middle
of its course; and, on the 25th of February, 1585, the bridge
was entirely finished.

The spot for this famous bridge was chosen between the
villages of Ordam and Calloo, because the bed of the river
was narrower there than at any other part. Its course
made a marked elbow, which would prevent the vessels of
the enemy from sailing full upon the bridge. On commencing
it they had driven, on each side of the Scheld, long rows
of large piles, which were continued as far as the depth of
the river would permit. They were joined together transversely,
and in all their length, with very strong and solid
pieces of wood: this formed what they called
staccadoes
: that
of Calloo was two hundred feet long, and that of Ordam
nine hundred. The space left between them was twelve
hundred and fifty feet. Upon each of these was formed a
kind of place of arms, capable of containing a body of
troops sufficient to defend it, and to protect the vessels
which were to continue the bridge. These were lined by a
494

parapet, from which the soldiers, protected from the shots
of the enemy, could annoy them with their fire. The two
forts constructed at the two
tÃªtes du pont
, that is to say, at
the extremity of the staccadoes, on the land side, protected
the two flanks of them; for this purpose they were furnished
with a numerous artillery. Batteries also were
established in the places of arms. To these precautions
was added that of bristling, on both sides, the staccadoes
with large posts, terminating in sharp iron points. They
protruded a considerable distance; and great piles, driven
into the bed of the river, held them fast just above the water.
It was proposed by this to keep off the enemyâs vessels,
and weaken their attacks. When the staccadoes were completed,
the vessels were brought up that were intended to
close the remainder of the course of the Scheld in the deepest
and widest part. Thirty-two barks, sixty feet long and
twelve feet wide, were selected for this purpose; they were
placed at twenty-two feet from each other; they were
fixed in their positions by two good anchors each, and were
fastened together by a great number of strong chains.
Each bark was manned by thirty soldiers and four sailors,
and armed with two cannon at the extremities. The total
number of cannon distributed over the staccadoes and the
bridge amounted to ninety-seven. The bridge likewise was
protected by an outward defence, in order to secure it from
surprise. It was known that the garrison were preparing
fire-ships, with which they meant to assail the bridge. It
was likewise feared that the armed vessels in the besieged
city might attack it from above, at the same time that the
ships of the confederates might attempt it from below. To
secure it from this double danger, some large rafts were
made with a great number of masts solidly fastened together,
which were set afloat in the width of the bridge, and presented
a sort of rampart or large parapet to the enemy.
This immense work, which was two miles four hundred feet
in length, required for its construction seven months of
incessant fatigue and application. The engineers who had
the direction of it were named Jean Baptiste Plato and
Prosperce Barrochio. It was the latter who formed the
idea of the rafts which covered the bridge. The duke of
Parma, to reward them for their labours, made them
495

a present of all the materials, after the capture of
Antwerp.

The city, however, neglected nothing that might impede
or destroy this astonishing undertaking. It retained in its
service a celebrated Italian engineer, named Frederic Giambelli,
a native of Mantua. It was he who invented and
brought into play those destructive vessels since known by
the name of
infernal
machines. They were built of very
thick and solidly-joined timbers, among which were constructed
chambers for mines, proportioned to their size.
These were formed of good bricks and mortar, and required
but one light to set fire to the powder with which they
were filled. These terrible vessels were loaded with blocks
of stone, bullets of different calibres, in short, with all sorts
of materials of great weight, heaped together as closely as
possible, in order that the effect of the mine might be
increased by the resistance opposed to it. Giambelli employed
more than eight months in getting everything ready.
The large vessel of which we have before spoken was not so
soon completed. It was a ship with two very lofty decks:
the under one was armed with several large and small cannon;
the upper was a large place of arms, whereon were a
number of troops, who from the elevation of that deck could
keep up a warm fire of musketry. This enormous vessel had
but two large masts of equal size, placed at the two extremities,
and of nearly the same shape. To facilitate its approach
to the redoubts constructed by the royalists upon the banks
of the river, it was quite flat, and only sunk into the water
in proportion to its weight, being kept afloat upon a vast
raft of enormous beams, supported by empty barrels. Such
were the means to which the inhabitants of Antwerp had
recourse to keep open the navigation of the Scheld. They
had placed all their hopes in them. The confederates were
expected to aid their endeavours. A great number of armed
vessels awaited near Lillo the effects of the infernal machines,
with the view of acting at the same time. They
attempted to recapture the fort of Liestenstoech, and succeeded.

On the 4th of April at length appeared on the river
the two redoubtable machines called
Fortune
and
Hope
, followed
by some smaller vessels. They were left to the tide,
496

and, having nobody on board, they floated, abandoned to
themselves, and were carried by the reflux. Scarcely were
they in motion, than there burst from them a column of fire,
which, after having burnt for a few instants, appeared to sink
and be extinguished. The spectators were astonished. All
at once one of the smaller vessels blew up, when at a considerable
distance from the bridge, and produced no other
effect than a cloud of thick smoke. All that were constructed
in the same manner proved equally abortive. There
was nothing to be feared but from the two large vessels,
which insensibly drew nearer to their object. The first, the

Fortune
, ran upon the left bank of the river, burst with a
horrible crash, destroying the garrison of a neighbouring
redoubt and a number of soldiers dispersed about the environs.
However serious was the effect of this, that of the

Hope
promised to be more terrific, and, in fact, caused considerable
damage. This vessel had been guided to the point
of union of one of the staccadoes and the barks which formed
the bridge. It was at this spot it blew up. The air remained
for a long time darkened; the shock experienced by
the earth extended miles round; the Scheld rushed from its
bed, and threw its foaming waters over the neighbouring
country; the bodies of the miserable victims to this explosion
were so mutilated as to preserve no resemblance to the
human figure. The vast mass of stones and instruments of
death which were hurled abroad by this frightful volcano,
falling in all directions, a great number of unfortunates were
killed, wounded, or bruised in the most cruel manner. Five
hundred royalists perished, and thousands were either
lamed or dangerously hurt. The death of the marquis de
Roubais was the crowning incident of this fatal day. The
damage sustained by the bridge was not so great as was at
first feared; but the disorder was so great, that if the enemy
had attacked the work at that moment, all would have been
lost. They were quite ignorant of the effect of their own
machine; and the good face put upon the affair by the
besiegers led them to believe that the bridge had sustained
but little injury.

The citizens of Antwerp had now no hope but in the large
vessel which they had named
The End of the War
. It was
put to work. This vast castle drew near to one of the
497

redoubts built on the banks of the river, on the Brabant
side. The men on board commenced a brisk fire: they
amounted to more than a thousand; they supported the
effects of the lower cannon by a continual discharge of musketry;
they landed for the purpose of attacking a redoubt;
but in this they failed. The fort braved their batteries, and
their assaults proved useless. On the other side, their
enormous vessel was so knocked about by the artillery of
the redoubt, that they had much difficulty in repairing it,
and rendering it capable of being employed again. A second
attempt was as unfortunate as the first; and all the efforts
made afterwards, either to carry the works or break down
the bridge, proved equally fruitless. The most memorable
of the combats fought on these occasions was that of the
counter-dyke. The field of battle was only seventeen feet
wide. The townspeople were desirous of carrying it, at any
price. Animated by the example and exhortations of Sainte-Aldegonde
and the count of Hohenloe, they more than
once repulsed the royalists, and believed themselves masters
of the object of their generous efforts. But, overwhelmed
by the number of their enemies, rather than conquered,
they yielded their triumph, and retreated within the walls
of their city, having lost two thousand five hundred men
and thirty ships. After this bloody victory, which had
cost him more than a thousand men, the prince of Parma
took from the besieged all the neighbouring posts that
belonged to them, and shut them up closely in their city.
Despair was then at its height; the citizens had no other
prospect but the horrors of starvation from famine, which
began to be not only dreaded but felt, or the painful necessity
of yielding to the conqueror. The people assembled,
and openly opposed the leaders who wished to continue the
defence; and it became necessary to enter into negotiations.
Deputies were sent to the prince of Parma to arrange the
articles of surrender. Sainte-Aldegonde, who was at their
head, protracted for two months, under various pretexts,
the conclusion of the treaty, believing by this skilful delay
he should give time for the succours he expected to come
up. At length, on the 17th of August, 1585, the capitulation
was signed. The conqueror then made his public
entrance into the city, with all the pomp of a triumph.
498

Mounted on a superb courser, in complete armour, he marched
amidst bodies of cavalry and infantry, which opened and
closed this brilliant procession. Like other conquerors,
though he had obtained a sanguinary victory over a city
which was in arms for freedom of action and opinion, he
ended his triumph by offering up thanks to the God of
Battles, who holds defeat and victory in his hands.

MALTA.

A.D. 1565.

After
the conquest of Rhodes by Soliman II., its knights
retired to the island of Malta, which asylum was granted
to them by the emperor Charles V. In the hands of this
military order, Malta soon became the strong bulwark of
Christendom. The Mahometans were deeply interested in
taking this island, but more particularly in subduing its
defenders. Dragut laid siege to it in 1565, with an army
of more than thirty thousand men. Several assaults were
given, which the knights sustained with their usual bravery,
and the Ottoman general met with his death. Mustapha
Pacha, who succeeded him, attacked Fort St. Elmo, the
smallest of the city, with great impetuosity. One of the
knights, Abel de Bridiers de la Gardampe, received a shot
which struck him to the earth. He said to some of his
comrades, who offered to carry him to a place of safety to
have his wound dressed, âDo not consider me among the
living; your cares will be much better bestowed in defending
our brethren.â He then dragged himself as far as the
chapel, and having recommended himself to God, expired at
the foot of the altar. The knights who defended St. Elmo
having made an heroic defence, proposed to abandon it, and
were more intent on that purpose than pleased the governor
De la Valette. Such a determination damaged all his plans,
and he, somewhat ostentatiously, made some fresh levies to
take the place of those who thought of abandoning their
post. The enthusiasm became general, and all the Maltese
499

were desirous of enrolling themselves. The knights in the
fort were much chagrined at this; the embarrassment of
their situation was increased by a letter from De la Valette,
who wrote to them with much sternness and hauteur, that
he willingly gave them their dismissal; that for one knight
who appeared discouraged by the greatness of the danger,
ten intrepid soldiers presented themselves, who earnestly
asked to brave it; and that he was about to send this fresh
garrison to take their post. â
Return to the convent, my
brethren
,â added he, â
you will be more in safety there; and,
on our part, we shall be more at ease concerning the preservation
of an important place, upon which depends the salvation
of the isle and of our whole order.
â The knights felt very
sensibly the contempt with which they were treated. They
could not conceal from themselves that by giving up the
place to recruits they should be covered with shame.
âHow,â said they to each other, âshall we support the
sight of the grand master, and the reproaches of our
brethren, if the new garrison should be fortunate enough to
maintain itself in its post? What spot on the earth could
we then find to conceal our shame and our grief?â The
natural result of this reflection was to meet death rather
than be replaced by this militia, or to abandon the fort to
the Turks. Although the grand master foresaw, and even
prepared for this repentance, he at first would not be softened
by it. The knights, terrified at seeing their supplications
rejected, asked pardon in the most submissive terms, and
caused their prayers to be seconded by worthy men in full
possession of his confidence. He at last affected to be
appeased, and consented that these brave knights should
perish on the breach. It is probable that to the address
of De la Valette on this occasion the preservation of Malta
was due. This fort held out so long, that the pacha could
not refrain from saying, as he entered it, âWhat will the
father do, if the son, who is so small, has cost us so many
brave soldiers?â From that time he saw that the conquest
of Malta was impossible, and turned his thoughts to
retreating with credit. To intimidate the knights, he hung
the bodies of all of the order whom he found among the
dead, and more particularly those who had a faint breath of
life left. He ordered them to be opened, their hearts to be
500

taken out, their bodies to be cut into quarters, to be clothed
in their
soubrevestes
, and, after being fastened to planks, to
be cast into the sea. These mutilated bodies were carried
into the city by the waves. The grand master, Jean de la
Valette, could not restrain his tears. Animated by a just
but useless indignation, he employed reprisals, and cut the
throats of all his Turkish prisoners, commanding their
bloody heads to be thrown into the camp of their compatriots.
The preservation of Malta covered the knights
with glory.

VACHTENDONCK.

A.D. 1588.

This
little city, at a small distance from Venloo, but
whose advantages of situation, in a country that could be
flooded, and the fortifications which the Dutch had added to
its natural defences, rendered its capture difficult, was
besieged by the Spaniards, under the command of Pierre
Ernest de Mansfeld. Its weak garrison made a noble resistance.
Nevertheless, the works of the Spaniards advanced
so rapidly, the fire of the batteries, and the sapping and
mining were so effective, that on the 3rd of December the
besieged capitulated. The reason for our noticing this siege,
is the circumstance that it was the first time bombs were
used; they had been invented a short time before, by a man
of Venloo, a maker of artificial fireworks. The garrison and
the citizens, terrified at these globes of fire, which crushed
their houses and set fire to everything around them, made
but a feeble resistance after they had seen their effects.
This destructive arm has been perfected with time, and gave
birth to grenades, pot-grenades, and many other murderous
machines.

501

OSTEND.

A.D. 1601â1604.

This
celebrated siege, undertaken by the Spaniards, lasted
three years and seventy-eight days, and, up to the moment
of its termination, doubts were entertained of their success.
The besieged, constantly succoured both by sea and land,
were unable to tire out the courage and patience of the
besiegers, who pushed on their attacks without relaxation,
amidst the greatest obstacles. It would be difficult to count
the number of batteries they erected, the assaults they
made, or the mines they sprung. The last were so frequent,
that they might be said to work more beneath the earth
than upon its surface. All the resources of art were exhausted
in the attack and defence. Machines were invented.
The earth and the ocean by turns favoured the two parties,
seconding and destroying alternately the works of the
Spaniards and the Dutch, who advanced no work upon the
land which the sea did not appear to hasten to destroy.
This siege cost the Dutch more than seventy thousand men,
and more than ten millions of French money. Their adversary
likewise lost immensely. The slaughter was terrible
on both sides. Both parties were more eager to inflict death
upon their enemies than to save their own lives. At length
the besieged, after having seen nine commanders perish successively,
did not abandon the little heap of ruins on which
they had concentrated themselves, and which they contested
foot by foot, until it seemed to disappear from under them:
an honourable capitulation was granted. The enemy was
surprised to see march from untenable ruins more than four
thousand vigorous soldiers, whom the abundance they had
lived in during the whole siege had kept in the best health.
In addition to a numerous artillery, a prodigious quantity
of provisions and munitions was found in the city. The
archduke, who had begun this celebrated expedition, with
the infanta his wife, had the curiosity to go and view the
502

melancholy remains of Ostend. They found nothing but a
shapeless heap of ruins, and could trace no vestige of the
besieged place. Spinola, who had taken it, was loaded with
honours and elevated to the highest dignities. The Dutch,
who during the siege had taken Rhenberg, Grave, and
Ecluse, very easily consoled themselves for their loss; and
to mark by a public monument that they thought they had
received full amends, had a medal struck, with the inscription,

Jehova plus dederat quam perdidimus
:âGod has given
us more than we have lost.

In a work like this it would be impossible to pass by such
a siege as that of Ostend, but at the same time it is equally
impossible for us to do the subject justice: the interesting
details of this siege would fill a volume.

BERGEN-OP-ZOOM.

A.D. 1585.

This
celebrated fortified place has been several times
besieged. The Spaniards attacked it in 1585, when it was
defended by Morgan, an intelligent and brave English
captain. The duke of Parma, knowing all the difficulties of
the undertaking, thought to abridge them by attempting to
win over two English officers, who passed for being not very
delicate. These two soldiers discovered the dukeâs proposals
to their commander, who ordered them to carry on the negotiations.
They went into the enemyâs camp; and a detachment
of four thousand men was intrusted to their guidance,
to take possession of the place. They marched at the head
of them, between two soldiers, who had orders to poniard
them if they were treacherous, or if they did not introduce
them into the citadel. They did, in fact, introduce them;
but scarcely had forty men passed through the gate, when
the portcullis was let down. The Spaniards who were
within Bergen-op-Zoom did not dare to kill their guides,
whilst the artillery of the place opened its thunders upon
the detachment under the walls. The dishonour and the
defeat of this day both fell to the Spaniards, who, degenerating
from Castilian valour, were taken in their own snare.

503

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1622.

The court of Madrid had placed at the head of sixty
thousand men the famous Spinola. This general, to carry
out the intentions of his master, entered the territories of
Holland, and presented himself before Bergen-op-Zoom.
The Spaniards took their posts, erected their batteries,
thundered against the ramparts, gave many assaults, and
caused the timid among the besieged to tremble; but the
prince of Orange having thrown in succours, the besiegers
retired on the 2nd of October, with the loss of ten thousand
men, after two months of useless efforts, leaving Bergen-op-Zoom
her glorious title of a
Maiden City
.

THIRD SIEGE, A.D. 1747.

During more than a century this
Maiden
remained intact,
but in October, 1747, she was deprived of the proud title by
the illustrious and impetuous Lowendahl. In order not to
lose the fruits of the memorable day of Lanfeld, Louis XV.
commanded the siege of this important place. In describing
it, we will avail ourselves of the words of
Voltaire:â

âSiege was laid to Bergen-op-Zoom, a place esteemed
impregnable, less because the celebrated and ingenious
Cohorn had there displayed all his art, than from its being
constantly supplied with all it could want by the Scheld,
which forms an arm of the sea behind it. In addition to
these defences and a numerous garrison, there were lines
near the fortifications, and in those lines a body of troops,
which might at any moment assist the city. Of all the
sieges ever undertaken, this was, perhaps, the most difficult.
The count de Lowendahl, who had already taken a part of
Dutch Brabant, was charged with this enterprise. The
allies and the French, the besieged and the besiegers, were
all equally of opinion that the undertaking would fail:
Lowendahl was almost the only person who reckoned upon
success. The allies neglected nothing: the garrison was
reinforced; succours, provisions, and munitions, were thrown
in from the Scheld; the artillery was well served; the besieged
made frequent sorties; the troops from the lines were
constant in their attacks, and mines were sprung in several
504

places. The diseases to which the besiegers were subjected,
from being encamped in an unhealthy spot, materially
seconded the resistance of the city. These contagious
maladies placed more than twenty thousand men
hors de
combat
; but that deficiency was soon filled up.

âAt length, after three weeks of open trenches, the count
de Lowendahl made it apparent that there are occasions on
which the rules of art may be exceeded. The breaches were
not yet practicable. There were three works scarcely commenced,âthe
raveline of Edem and two bastions, one of
which was called the Cohorn, and the other the Pucelle.
The general determined to give the assault at all these three
points at the same time, and to carry the city.

âThe French, in pitched battles, often meet with their
equals, and sometimes with their masters in military discipline;
but they have none in those bold strokes and rapid
enterprises, in which impetuosity, agility, and ardour overcome
all obstacles. The troops were ordered to assemble
in profound silence, towards the middle of the night: the
besieged imagined themselves in perfect safety. The French
descend into the fosses, and go straight to the three breaches;
twelve grenadiers only render themselves masters of the
fort of Edem, kill all who attempt to defend themselves, and
compel the terrified remainder to lay down their arms. The
bastions of La Pucelle and Cohorn are assailed and carried
with the same spirit. The troops mount in crowds. Everything
is carried; they push on to the ramparts, and there
form: they then enter the city with fixed bayonets. The
marquis de Luzeac seizes the port gate; the commander of
the fortress of this port surrenders to him at discretion: all
the other forts do the same. The aged baron de Cromstron,
who commanded in the city, flies away towards the lines.
The prince of Hesse-Philipstadt endeavours to make some
resistance in the streets with two regiments, one Scotch and
the other Swiss; but they are cut to pieces. The remainder
of the garrison flies towards the lines, and carries terror to
the body to which they look for protection. All fly; arms,
provisions, and baggage, everything is abandoned: the city
is given up as legitimate plunder to the conquering soldiers.
A seizure was made, in the name of the king, of seventeen
large vessels lying in the port, laden with munitions of all
505

kinds, and provisions, which the cities of Holland had sent
to the besieged. Upon the chests which contained them
there was printed in large characters,
To the invincible
garrison of Bergen-op-Zoom
. Louis XV., on learning
the news of this event, made the count de Lowendahl a
marshal of France. The surprise of London was great, but
the consternation of the United Provinces was extreme.
The army of the allies was discouraged.â

The count de Lowendahl, in the letter he wrote the day
after the capture to Marshal de Saxe, estimated his loss
at four hundred men only, and that of the enemy at five
thousand.

MAGDEBURG.

A.D. 1631.

The
city of Magdeburg, capital of a duchy of the same
name in Lower Saxony, had entered into an alliance with
Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, and had granted him
a passage over its bridge of the Elbe, by which the Imperialists
were driven from the flat country. But the Austrian
general Tilly returned, and blockaded the place very closely.
The electors of Brandenburg and Saxony, disapproving of
the conduct of the inhabitants of Magdeburg, resolved to
maintain their connection with the emperor, and to assemble
their
arriÃ¨re-ban
, to oppose the king of Sweden. Tilly left
some troops to continue the blockade, and marched with the
bulk of his forces to Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where he joined
Torquato-Conti; he then crossed the electorate to attack
the Swedes, who were making progress in Mecklenburg.
But the fortune of Gustavus Adolphus had an ascendancy
over that of the imperial general. The king of Sweden left
Mecklenburg, crossed the Oder, took Lanesberg and
Frankfort, and then turned suddenly towards Berlin, for
the purpose of succouring Magdeburg, which Tilly was
now besieging in person. Gustavus Adolphus advanced
beyond Potsdam, and the Imperialists, who held Brandenburg
and Rathenau, fell back, at his approach, upon the
506

army which was besieging Magdeburg. The elector of
Saxony refused to grant the Swedes a passage over the
bridge of the Elbe, at Wittemberg, which prevented Gustavus
from succouring the city of Magdeburg, as he had
intended.

This unfortunate city, which neither Tilly nor Wallenstein
had been able to take by force, at length succumbed to
stratagem. The Imperialists had entered into a negotiation
with the Magdeburghers, by the intervention of the Hanseatic
cities; and they pretended during these conferences not
to fire upon the city. The Magdeburghers, at the same
time credulous and negligent, slumbered in this apparent
security; the citizens who had kept watch upon the ramparts,
retired, in great numbers, towards morning, to their
own houses. Pappenheim, who directed the siege, and who
had advanced his attacks up to the counterscarp of the fosse,
perceived this circumstance, and took advantage of it. He
made his dispositions one morning, when there were but
few people on the ramparts; he gave four assaults at once,
and made himself master of them, without meeting with
much resistance. At the same time, the Croats, who lay
near the Elbe, whose bed was then low, proceeded along it,
without departing far from its banks, and took the works
on the opposite side. As soon as Tilly was master of the
cannons of the rampart, he directed them in such a manner
as to sweep the streets, and the numbers of the Imperialists
increasing every minute, all the efforts the inhabitants could
make became useless. Thus was this city, one of the most
ancient and flourishing of Germany, taken when it least
expected it, and barbarously given up three consecutive days
to pillage. All that the unbridled license of a soldiery can
invent when there is no check upon its fury; all that the
most ferocious cruelty inspires men with, when blind rage
takes possession of their senses, was perpetrated by the
Imperialists in this desolated city. The soldiers, in troops,
with arms in their hands, rushed tumultuously through the
streets, massacring indifferently old men, women, and children,
those who attempted to defend themselves, and those
who made not the least resistance: the houses were pillaged
and sacked, the streets were inundated with blood and
covered with dead bodies; nothing was seen but heaps of
507

corpses, some still palpitating, lying in perfect nakedness;
the cries of the murdered and the shouts of their murderers
mingled in the air, and inspired horror and disgust. In this
cruel butchery perished nearly all the citizens: only fourteen
hundred were saved. These had shut themselves up in the
dome, and obtained their pardon of Tilly. To massacres,
very naturally succeeded conflagrations; the flames arose
from all parts, and in a few hours, private houses and public
edifices only formed one heap of ashes. It seems scarcely
credible, but only one hundred and forty houses were left
standing of this noble city. Twelve hundred maidens, it is
said, drowned themselves to avoid dishonour. All Germany,
friends as well as enemies, pitied the fate of this city, and
deplored the melancholy extirpation of its inhabitants. The
cruelty of the Imperialists created the more horror, from
history presenting but few examples of such shocking
inhumanity.

TURIN.

A.D. 1706.

Louis XIV.
having recalled the duke of VendÃ´me from
Italy, to place him at the head of the troops in Flanders,
substituted for him the duke de la Feuillade, the son of the
famous marshal who erected a statue to his king in the
Place des Victoires. Some few attacks had been already
made upon Turin. La Feuillade continued them with an
army of forty-six squadrons and a hundred battalions. He
hoped to take this city, and, as his reward, looked for a
marshalâs baton. The minister Chamillard, his father-in-law,
who was very partial to him, spared no means to assure
him the victory. âThe imagination,â says Voltaire, âis terrified
at the preparations for this siege. Readers not accustomed
to enter into these matters, will perhaps be glad to
find here of what these immense and useless preparations
consisted.

âA hundred and forty pieces of cannon were brought
up, and it is to be observed that each mounted cannon costs
508

about two thousand crowns.
15
There were a hundred and
ten thousand cannon-balls, a hundred and six thousand
cartridges of one fashion, and three hundred thousand of
another, twenty-one thousand bombs, twenty-seven thousand
seven hundred grenades, fifteen thousand sacks of earth,
thirty thousand pioneering instruments, and twelve hundred
thousand pounds of powder. Add to these munitions lead,
iron, and tin, cordage, everything required by miners, such
as sulphur, saltpetre, and tools of all kinds. It is certain
that the cost of all these preparations for destruction would
suffice for the foundation and the prosperity of a numerous
colony. Every siege of a great city requires equally enormous
expenses, and yet when a ruined village at home stands in
need of repair, it is neglected.

âThe duke de la Feuillade, full of ardour and activity,
more capable than most persons of enterprises which only
demand courage, but incapable of such as require skill,
thought, and time, pressed on the siege against all rules.
The Marshal de Vauban, the only general, perhaps, who
loved the state better than himself, had proposed to the duke
de la Feuillade to come and direct the siege as an engineer,
and to serve in his army as a volunteer; but the haughty
De la Feuillade took the offers of Vauban for pride concealed
under the mask of modesty. He was weak enough to be
piqued because the best engineer in Europe offered to give
him advice. He wrote, in a letter which I have seen: âI
hope to take Turin Ã  la Cohorn.â

âThis Cohorn was the Vauban of the alliesâa good
engineer, a good general, who had more than once taken
places fortified by Vauban. After writing such a letter,
Turin ought to have been taken. But, having attacked it
by the citadel, which was the strongest side, and not having
surrounded the whole city, succours and provisions had free
entrance. The duke of Savoy could come out when he
pleased; and the more impetuosity the duke de la Feuillade
exhibited in his reiterated and fruitless attacks, the longer
the siege seemed protracted. The duke of Savoy left the
city with some troops of cavalry, for the purpose of
deceiving De la Feuillade. The latter abandoned the siege
509

to run after the prince, who, being better acquainted with
the country, escaped the pursuit. La Feuillade missed the
duke of Savoy, and the siege stood still during his absence.

âIn the mean time, after the departure of the duke de
VendÃ´me, the duke of Orleans, nephew to the king, came
to take the command of the troops of observation. He
could not prevent Prince Eugene from joining the duke of
Savoy near Asti. This junction compelled him to unite
with the duke de la Feuillade, and to enter the camp before
Turin. There were but two parts to take; that of waiting
for Prince Eugene in the lines of circumvallation, or that of
going to meet him while he was still in the neighbourhood
of Vegliana. The duke of Orleans called a council of war,
composed of Marsin, who lost the battle of Hochstet,
La Feuillade, Albergotti, St. FrÃ©mont, and other lieutenant-generals.
âGentlemen,â said the prince to them, âif we
remain in our lines, we shall lose the battle. Our circumvallation
is five leagues in extent; we are not able to line
all our intrenchments. You see here the regiment of the
marine, which is not more than two menâs height: there
you may see places entirely unmanned. The Dora, which
passes through our camp, will prevent our troops from
rendering each other prompt assistance. When Frenchmen
wait to be attacked, they lose the greatest of their advantages,âthat
impetuosity and those first moments of ardour
which so often decide the fate of battles. Take my word,
we must march to meet the enemy.â The resolution was
agreed to, when Marsin drew from his pocket an order of
the kingâs, by which it was commanded that, in the event of
action being proposed, his opinion was to be deferred to;
and his opinion was, that they should remain in the lines.
The duke of Orleans saw that he had only been sent to the
army as a prince of the blood, and not as a general; and,
forced to follow the counsel of the marshal, he made all
necessary preparations for the battle, which was fought on
the 7th of September.

âThe enemy appeared to wish to form several attacks
at once. Their movements threw the whole French camp
into a state of uncertainty. The duke of Orleans desired
one thing; Marsin and Feuillade another: they disputed
and argued, but they decided upon nothing. At length
510

they allowed the enemy to cross the Dora. They advanced
with eight columns of twenty-five men deep: they must
instantly be opposed by battalions equally deep. Albergotti,
placed far from the army, upon the mountain of the Capuchins,
had with him twenty thousand men, and had in face
nothing but some militia, who did not dare attack him. He
was asked for twelve thousand men: he replied that he
could not spare them, and gave specious reasons for his
refusal. He was listened to, and time was lost. Prince
Eugene attacked the intrenchments, and, at the end of two
hours, forced them. The duke of Orleans, who exposed
himself with all the bravery of the heroes of his blood,
having received a dangerous wound in the arm, had retired
to have it dressed. He was scarcely in the hands of the
surgeon, when he was informed that all was lost, that the
enemy were masters of the camp, and that the rout was
general. Immediate flight was necessary. The lines, the
trenches, were abandoned, and the army dispersed. All the
baggage, provisions, munitions, and the military chest fell
into the hands of the conqueror. Marshal de Marsin,
wounded in the thigh, was made prisoner. A surgeon in
the service of the duke of Savoy amputated the limb, and
he died a few minutes after the operation. The Chevalier
Methuen, the English ambassador to the duke of Savoy,
the most frank, generous, and brave man his country
ever employed in an embassy, had upon all occasions fought
at the side of that prince: he saw the Marshal de Marsin
taken, and was a witness of his last moments. He told me
that Marsin said these very words, âAt least believe,
monsieur, that it was against my advice that we remained
in our lines.â These words appeared to contradict formally
what had passed in the council of war; and they were
nevertheless true: Marshal de Marsin, on taking leave at
Versailles, had represented to the king that the enemy must
be met, in case they appeared for the purpose of succouring
Turin; but Chamillard, intimidated by preceding defeats,
had caused it to be decided that they ought to wait and
not offer battle; and this order, given at Versailles, was
the cause of sixty thousand men being defeated and
dispersed.â

This defeat, which cost nine or ten thousand men killed
511

or made prisoners, was still more fatal to France by its
consequences; for it brought on the loss of Modena,
Mantua, Milan, Piedmont, and in the end, of the kingdom
of Naples.

ARRAS.

A.D. 1654.

Two
of the most illustrious generals, not only of France
but of the world, were opposed to each other before Arras.
The great CondÃ© had allowed party feeling so far to prevail
over his sense of duty as to lead him not only to deprive his
country of his services, but to turn them against it. It is
rather a remarkable fact, that one of the generals of whom
France has most to boast, earned his brightest laurels when
in arms against her. When his son was desirous of having
the history of his father painted in the gallery of Chantilly,
he found himself at a loss on account of the above-mentioned
circumstance. In order to avoid being quite silent on these
subjects, he ordered the muse of history to be portrayed
holding a book, upon the back of which was written,
Life of
the Prince de CondÃ©
. This muse was tearing leaves from
the book and throwing them on the ground, and on the
leaves appeared,ââSuccour of Cambrai,â âSuccour of
Valenciennes,â âRetreat from before Arras;â in short, all
the great actions of CondÃ© during his sojourn in the Low
Countries,âactions which would have been worthy of the
highest praise, if the hero who performed them had worn
another scarf.

CondÃ© proposed to the Spanish court to besiege Arras, to
avenge itself for the siege of Stenay. Arras contained a
garrison of little more than two thousand men; the army of
the archduke Leopold consisted of thirty-two thousand men,
Italians, Lorrains, Flemings, Spaniards, and discontented
Frenchmen. Alarmed at this enterprise, Mazarin had recourse
to Turenne, and an army of fourteen thousand men
was sent under his command to succour Arras. Six hundred
determined Frenchmen broke through the enemyâs lines, and
512

threw themselves into the place before the Spaniards had
completed their intrenchments. The army of Turenne, too
weak to venture to contend with the superior forces of the
enemy in an open country, awaited some time at Peronne for
the necessary provisions. Turenneâs first object was to
starve his enemy, and to occupy a position, the strength of
which might render his army respectable. His camp was
at first at Monchi-le-Preux, upon a height which commanded
a valley, watered on one side by the Scarpe, and on the other
by the Cogel. From this point he intercepted the enemyâs
communication with Douai, Bouchain, and Valenciennes;
the marquis de Beauvais, sent to Bapaume, prevented their
receiving anything from Cambrai. Two thousand men,
posted towards Lens, intercepted the passage of Lille, whilst
Lilleboane, with fifteen hundred men, was to scour the
country and block up the roads of Aire and Saint-Omer.
The Spanish army, thus inclosed, might have been forced by
famine to raise the siege, if it had been possible to stop up
the road of Saint-Pol; but that could not be accomplished.
The Spaniards opened their trenches on the 14th of July;
the besieged defended their ground so completely foot by
foot, that they had only lost a single hornwork at the end
of a month; still more, they had cost the besiegers two
thousand men. Marshal dâHocquincourt, having entered
Stenay, came to reinforce the viscount before Arras. On
his route he took Saint-Pol, and carried off a detachment of
five hundred men from the abbey of Saint-Eloi. Turenne,
who had been to meet him with fifteen squadrons, made on
his return a reconnaissance upon all the enemyâs lines to
the north: they were of two toises in width, and ten feet in
depth; in front was a fosse, nine feet wide and six feet deep.
Twelve rows of
trous de loup
, placed chequerwise, were between
the intrenchments and the
avant-fossÃ©
; little palisades
of a foot and a half high were planted in the intervals
of these, to prevent the approach of cavalry. The Spaniards,
commanded by the count de Fuensaldagne, occupied the
north of these long lines, on the road to Lens; the prince de
CondÃ© was on the opposite side with the French. The
archduke, with the Germans and the Flemings, extended to
the east, from the road of Cambrai to the Scarpe; Don Ferdinand
de Solis completed the investment from the west to
513

the south, with Italians and Lorrains. In a second reconnaissance,
the marshal went so close to the quarters of
Fuensaldagne, that some of his officers represented to him
that he would expose himself to an almost certain defeat if
the Spaniards availed themselves of the opportunity offered.
âOh! there is nothing to fear,â said Turenne; âthey will
employ more time in consulting and holding council than it
will take me to examine their lines.â He was right: the
Spaniards did not put themselves in motion till he was out
of sight. Terrified by these formidable lines, none of the
French generals dared attempt to succour Arras; Turenne
alone maintained that certainly some weak point would be
found if they were attacked by night; he often conversed
with his officers on the conduct to be observed on entering
intrenchments, and upon the means of overcoming all the
obstacles that art can oppose to valour. The court were of
the opinion of Turenne, and gave orders for an attack on the
24th of August.

The principal effort was to be made against the quarter of
Don Ferdinand de Solis, and on the part nearest to that of
Fuensaldagne: these points had been considered as the
weakest or the most remote from the prince de CondÃ©, whose
activity and talents they dreaded, and from the French,
whose vivacity and vigilance were likewise formidable. To
divert the attention of the enemy and divide their forces,
false attacks were to be made at the same time: one on the
quarter of the prince de CondÃ©, another upon the most distant
part of the camp of Fuensaldagne, and the third upon
the lines of the prince of Lorraine. At sunset, the armies
crossed the Scarpe upon four bridges, the soldiers being
provided with hurdles and fascines. The march was conducted
with good order and in profound silence; its precision
was such, that the troops arrived exactly at the time
appointed for forming a junction with Marshal dâHocquincourt.
Without waiting for him, marshals Turenne and De
la FertÃ© marched directly to the lines, from which they were
distant half a league: favoured by a dark night, in which the
moon only appeared at intervals, and lighted only by the fires
of the matches of the musketeers, they marched till within a
hundred paces of their works, without the enemyâs having
the least suspicion of the enterprise. Here the report of
514

three cannon gave the alarm, and a row of cresset-lights
appeared all along the lines of circumvallation. The Italians
were still preparing for fight, when the foot of Turenneâs
first line had already passed the
avant-fossÃ©
, covered the

puits
16
or wells, and pulled up the palisades. Meeting with
little resistance, the French easily gained the second fosse,
some troops even leaped over it before it was entirely filled
up with the fascines. Fiscia, a captain of the regiment of
Turenne, planted the colour of his company upon the parapet;
so much courage and good fortune were requisite to
keep up the spirits of the rest of the troops. In the darkness
they were afraid to advance; but at the cry of âVive
Turenne!â all were animated with equal ardour. Five battalions
broke in at several points at the same time, and
cleared the way for the cavalry. Marshal de la FertÃ© had
not been so fortunate on the quarter of the Spaniards; his
soldiers, repulsed, only penetrated the lines by favour of the
large gaps made by Turenneâs troops. As for Marshal dâHocquincourt,
arriving towards the end of the night in the midst
of the enemyâs consternation, he easily made himself a passage.
Forced in almost all directions, the Italians and the Lorrains
abandoned their posts, and, flying into the other quarters,
carried disorder and terror wherever they went.

At daybreak the prince de CondÃ©, crossing the quarter of
the archduke, advised him to retreat. To protect this
movement, CondÃ© marched with the cavalry to meet the
French, and check their victorious impetuosity. He at
first gained a not very difficult advantage over those engaged
in pillage, and then beat the Marshal de la FertÃ©, who
had imprudently descended from a height; but he did not
dare to pursue him. The marshal had been replaced upon
that height by a considerable body of troops. At seeing
this, CondÃ© took possession of a neighbouring elevation, to
wait for his infantry. His intention was then to attack the
column which appeared upon the height. Marshal Turenne
had there fortified himself. Some artillery and fresh troops
had joined him at this respectable post. CondÃ© led his
troops to the attack, but his soldiers were stopped by the
fire of Turenneâs cannon: in spite of all his efforts, the
515

prince was obliged to fall back. A sortie of the garrison of
Arras made him hasten his retrograde movement the more;
CondÃ© and Turenne, in face of each other, divined who their
opponent was by his manÅuvres. The prudent Turenne
did not pursue CondÃ©; the marquis de Bellefonds, not so
wise, attacked his rear-guard at the passage of the Scarpe,
and was repulsed with loss. Still formidable in the midst
of a reverse, CondÃ© left his intrenchments, like a general
quitting a camp he is tired of occupying, rallied his scattered
troops, and retired to Cambrai, always presenting a
bold and redoubtable front to his enemies. His fine retreat,
in which he covered the conquered Spaniards, formed a
striking contrast with the shameful flight of the archduke
and the count de Fuensaldagne, who escaped with a few
squadrons through some French baggage-waggons. Turenne
lost but few men, but he was wounded; the loss of the
Spaniards amounted to three thousand men, sixty-three
cannon, two thousand horses, two thousand waggons, and
all the equipages of the army. To recompense the eminent
services rendered to the Spaniards by the prince de CondÃ©,
the king of Spain wrote to him in the following words:ââMy
cousin, I was told that all was lost, but your highness
has saved everything.â The glory of Turenne was at its
height; nevertheless a priest, intoxicated with power, dared
for a time to rob him of the honours of his triumph:
Mazarin caused all the success of this day to be attributed
to himself by an infant monarch, whom he led by the hand.
At that time people feigned to believe him, but now posterity
avenges Turenne, and he enjoys the glory due to
him.

Buonaparte had no faith in retreats; he said a generalâs
only business was to conquer. His error, as a great captain,
is proved by his history; he never knew how to retreat, and
the consequence was St. Helena. In this siege we behold
CondÃ©âs retreat very little inferior in glory to Turenneâs
victory.

516

VERCHERES.

A.D. 1697.

Although
this cannot be termed a siege, still, being of
the nature of one, and very extraordinary in its circumstances,
we cannot resist giving it to our readers.

Mademoiselle de VerchÃ¨res, little more than fifteen years
of age, was walking on the banks of the St. Lawrence, when
she heard the hissing of bullets, and beheld a party of
Iroquois on the point of surrounding her. She fled at her
best speed, and they pursued her; she threw herself into
the fort, shut the gates, and gave the alarm. She heard
the cries of the terrified women, and fearing they would
impede rather than assist the defence, she shut them
up in a secure place. A single soldier was on duty in the
fort. She flew to join him, put on a hat and a uniform
coat, armed herself with a musket, showed herself on the
walls, and fired on the Iroquois. She then affected a loud
manly voice, pretended to have a numerous troop under her
command, and flew from sentry-box to sentry-box, as if to
distribute the posts. Warming with her work, the heroine
then loaded a cannon, and discharged it herself. This spread
terror among the Iroquois; it at the same time warned the
garrisons of the neighbouring forts to be on the defensive,
and quickly the banks of the river resounded with the roar
of artillery.

Thus this young person saved the fort of VerchÃ¨res, and,
perhaps, the whole colony. This courage, hereditary in her
family, seemed to be transmitted to the women as well as
to the men. Her mother, two years before, had displayed
the same intrepidity. The place had been invested by the
Iroquois at a time when the garrison was absent. There
were only three soldiers, who were all killed. When Madame
de VerchÃ¨res saw the last fall, while defending herself like a
brave man, in a redoubt fifty paces from the fort, she armed
517

herself in haste, advanced alone along the covered way,
gained the redoubt before the enemy could scale it, fired
at them, and at every shot brought down an assailant.
They were astonished and terrified, and were on the point
of flying before a woman, when the approach of a body of
French completed their dispersion.

Thus we see as much courage and presence of mind may
be displayed in a siege in which there is only one defender,
as if numerous hosts were engaged.

STRALSUND.

A.D. 1713.

Charles XII.
of Sweden, when he had taken refuge in
Turkey, after being beaten by Peter of Russia, at length
exhausted the obstinacy which had detained him so long at
Demirtocka, meditating on means to excite the Ottoman
Porte against his great rival, passed all at once, with characteristic
energy, from excessive inactivity to equally excessive
exertion. He set out from Demirtocka with prodigious
speed, crossed the hereditary states of the emperor, Franconia
and Mecklenburg, on horseback, and arrived at
Stralsund when least expected. His first proceeding was
to protest against the sequestration of the city of Stettin.
He hastened to declare that, not having made any convention,
he was not obliged to recognise that which his generals
had done in his absence to place Pomerania and Stettin in
a state of sequestration. With a character so obstinate as
that of this prince, no other argument could be employed
but force. Frederick William, king of Prussia, declared
that he would not allow the Swedes to enter Saxony, and
immediately joined the league of the Russians, Saxons, and
Hanoverians. In order to force, with the strong hand, the
king of Sweden to hold his engagements, he ordered a body
of Prussian troops to advance close to Stettin. Charles XII.
took possession of Anclam, Wolgaste, and Gripswalde, in
which were Prussian garrisons; nevertheless, with a slight
518

show of prudence, he dismissed the Prussian troops without
violence. At the commencement of the following campaign,
the Swedes dislodged the Prussians from the isle of Usedom,
and made prisoners of a detachment of five hundred men.
By this act of hostility they broke the neutrality of the
Prussians, and became the aggressors. Frederick William,
jealous of Charlesâs glory, and irritated at this proceeding,
declared war against Sweden. Twenty thousand Prussians
joined the Saxons and the Danes in Pomerania. Europe
then beheld two kings, in person, besieging another shut up
in Stralsund; but this king was Charles XII., fighting at
the head of fifteen thousand warlike Swedes, loving to
idolatry the heroism of their prince. Besides, his great
reputation and the prejudices of the universe fought in his
favour. In the army of the allies, the king of Prussia
examined the plans, decided upon the operations, and persuaded
the Danes to adopt his views. The king of Denmark,
a bad soldier, and not at all military in his tastes, had only
come to Stralsund in the hope of seeing Charles XII.
humiliated. Under these two kings the prince of Anhalt
was the soul of all the military enterprises. âHe was,â
says the king of Prussia, in his Memoirs, âa man of a
violent and obstinate character, who, with the valour of a
hero, had the experience of the finest campaigns of Prince
Eugene. His manners were ferocious, his ambition boundless;
deeply versed in the art of sieges, a fortunate soldier,
a bad citizen, he was capable of all the enterprises of both
Marius and Sylla, if fortune had seconded his ambition.â
This army laid siege to Stralsund, a city on the shores
of the Baltic, the Swedish fleet being able to supply
it constantly with provisions, munitions, and troops. Its
situation is strong; an impracticable marsh defends two-thirds
of its circumference; the only side by which it is
accessible is furnished by a good intrenchment, which from
the north extends to the sea-shore, and touches on the
marsh towards the east. In this intrenchment were encamped
twelve thousand Swedes, with Charles XII. at their
head. The besiegers removed successively all the obstacles
opposed to them. The first point was to drive away the
Swedish fleet from the coasts of Pomerania, in order to
deprive the Swedes of the succours they might receive by
519

sea. Nevertheless the king of Denmark was unwilling to
risk an action with a squadron he had on those coasts. All
the influence of the king of Prussia was required to persuade
him of the necessity for such a contest. The two kings were
spectators of the action, which took place at a short distance
from the shore, and threw the sea open to the allies. The
Prussians afterwards drove the Swedes from the isle of
Usedom, and took the fort of Pennamende at the point
of the sword. They shortly afterwards prepared to attack
the intrenchments. A Prussian officer singularly facilitated
this undertaking, the most difficult and most dangerous
of the whole siege. Being perfectly acquainted with the
ground, he knew that the arm of the sea which washes the
intrenchments was neither deep nor muddy; he sounded it
by night, and found that it was possible to ford it, to turn
this post by its left, and thus take the Swedes in flank and
rear. This project was successfully executed. They attacked
them by night; whilst one Prussian corps marched straight
to the intrenchments, another passed along the sea-shore,
and were in the Swedish camp before they were perceived.
The surprise of an unexpected attack, the confusion natural
to a night affair, and, above all, the numbers of the body
which fell upon their flanks, threw them quickly into a state
of rout: they abandoned their intrenchments, and sought
refuge in the city. Enraged at being deserted by his own
troops, Charles would have continued to fight alone. His
generals dragged him from the scene of action, and had
much difficulty in saving him from the hands of the allies;
all who did not promptly gain Stralsund were either killed
or made prisoners. The numbers taken in this attack
amounted to more than four hundred men. The more
closely to press the city, it became necessary for the allies
to render themselves masters of the isle of Rugen, whence
the besieged could likewise obtain succours. The prince of
Anhalt, at the head of twenty thousand men, crossed in
transports the space which divides Pomerania. This fleet
kept the same order of battle the troops observed on the
land. They pretended to land on the eastern coast, but
turning suddenly to the left, the prince of Anhalt disembarked
his troops at the port of Strezow, where the enemy
did not expect him. He posted himself in a quarter of a
520

circle, so that his two wings leant upon the sea, and during
the whole day caused intrenchments to be dug, fortified by

chevaux de frise
. His disposition was such, that two lines
of infantry supported his intrenchment. His cavalry formed
the third, with the exception of six squadrons which he had
posted without the lines, in order to be able to fall upon the
left flank of those who might attack him on that side.
Charles XII., deceived by the prince of Anhaltâs feint,
could not arrive in time to oppose the disembarkation.
Aware of the importance of this isle, he advanced by night
upon the Prussians, although he had but four thousand
men. He marched at the head of his infantry, which he
led to the very edge of the ditch, assisting to pull up the

chevaux de frise
which bordered it with his own hands; he
was slightly wounded in this attack, and General Dureng
was killed at his side. The inequality of numbers, the
darkness of the night, the six Prussian squadrons, but still
more than all the kingâs wound, made the Swedes lose the
fruits of their valour. Fortune had turned her back upon
that nation; everything seemed to tend to its decline. The
king retired to have his wound dressed; his discomfited
troops fled. The next day twelve hundred Swedes were
made prisoners at Lafich-Schanz, and the isle of Rugen was
entirely occupied by the allies. After this misfortune
Charles XII. returned to Stralsund. That city was almost
reduced to extremity. The besiegers having gained the
counterscarp, had already begun to construct their gallery
upon the principal fosse. It was the character of the king
of Sweden to bear up firmly against reverses; he endeavoured
to withstand his ill-fortune, and was able to preserve
an inexpressible
sang-froid
under all circumstances. The
citizens, far from murmuring, filled with admiration for their
master, whose exertions, sobriety, and courage astonished
them, had all become soldiers under him. One day, when
the king was dictating letters for Sweden to a secretary, a
bomb fell upon the house, penetrated the roof, and burst
close to the kingâs apartment. At the noise of the bomb
and the crash of the house, which seemed falling about
their ears, the pen fell from the hand of the secretary.
âWhatâs the matter?â said the king, with a tranquil
air; âwhy donât you write on?â âOh, sire, the bomb!â
521

âWell,â rejoined the king, âwhat has the bomb to do with
the letter I am dictating to you? Go on!â When he
saw the breach open, he wanted to defend it in person, the
besiegers threatening to give a general assault. His
generals threw themselves at his feet to conjure him not to
risk his life so uselessly. Seeing their prayers had no effect,
they pointed out to him the danger to which he exposed
himself of falling into the hands of his enemies. This
apprehension at length made him determine to abandon the
city. He embarked in a light boat, in which he passed,
favoured by the darkness, through the Danish fleet which
blockaded Stralsund, and gained with much trouble one of
his own vessels, which conveyed him to Sweden. Fourteen
years before, he had left this city as a conqueror about to
subdue the world; he returned thither a fugitive, pursued
by his enemies, despoiled of his finest provinces, and abandoned
by his army. As soon as the king was gone, the
garrison of Stralsund capitulated, and surrendered themselves
prisoners of war.

FREDERIKSHALL.

A.D. 1718.

Charles XII.
being desirous, for the second time, of
making the conquest of Norway, laid siege to Frederikshall,
an important place, situated at the mouth of the river
Tistendall, near the Channel of Denmark. It was in the
month of December, 1718. The winter was severe, and the
cold killed a number of soldiers. The works, nevertheless,
advanced quickly, and the city was soon pressed very
closely.

âOn the 11th of December,â says Voltaire, âthe king
went, at nine oâclock in the evening, to visit the trenches,
and not finding the parallels advanced to his mind, he
appeared much dissatisfied. M. MÃ©grel, a French engineer,
who conducted the siege, assured him that the place would
be taken in eight days. âWe shall see,â said the king, and
continued his examination of the works, in company with
522

the engineer. He stopped at a place where the
boyau
made
an angle with the parallel. He knelt down upon the interior
talus, and, resting his elbows upon the parapet, he remained
for some time watching the labourers, who were continuing
the trenches by star-light.â

Almost half the person of the king was exposed to a
battery of cannon pointed at the right angle, where he was,
and which was firing cartridges. At this moment his
officers saw him fall upon the parapet, breathing a heavy
sigh. They rushed towards him, but Charles XII. was no
more. A ball, weighing half a pound, had struck him on
the temple, and had made a hole in which three fingers
could be introduced. When dying, he had had the strength
to place, as by a natural movement, his hand upon the guard
of his sword. MÃ©grel, an indifferent and singular man, was
content with saying, as he surveyed the lifeless monarch:
â
We may retire, the piece is played out.
â To keep the
knowledge of this misfortune from the troops, until the
prince of Hesse, Charlesâs brother-in-law, should be informed
of it, his body was enveloped in a grey mantle, with a wig
and hat upon his head. In this disguise, the king was conveyed
away, under the name of Captain Carlsberg.

SCHWEIDNITZ.

A.D. 1761.

As
one of our principal objects is to lay before young
military students sieges in which masters of the art of war
have been engaged, we cannot pass by two of this city, both
containing lessons worthy of being remembered.

The capture of Schweidnitz offers a fresh proof that no
precaution is unnecessary in war. The smallest negligence
in the service of places contiguous to the enemy, is most
frequently punished by unexpected reverses. Five hundred
prisoners were negligently guarded in the fortress of
Schweidnitz. Amongst them was a Major Rocca, a clever
Italian partisan. This major formed the idea of placing the
fortress in which he was confined in the hands of the
523

Austrians. He had the address to insinuate himself so
completely into the good graces of the commander, that he
had liberty to walk among all the works, to become acquainted
with the places of all the sentinels and of all the
corps-de-garde
;
he frequently saw the Austrians, prisoners like himself,
intrigued in the city, and regularly informed General
Laudon of all he saw, perceived, or imagined, that would
facilitate the surprise of Schweidnitz. According to these
instructions, the general drew up his plan of attack, which
he executed in the night between the 30th of September
and the 1st of October. He distributed twenty battalions
in four attacks, one upon the Breslau gate, another upon
the Striegau gate, the third upon the fort of Boeckendorff,
and the fourth upon the Water fort. M. de Zastrow,
governor of Schweidnitz, having some suspicions of the
enemyâs intentions, called his garrison to arms about the
middle of the night, and spread them about the works; but
he committed the faults of not giving his officers instructions
how to act, of not sending cavalry to a certain distance on
the look-out, and of not discharging fire-bombs to throw a
light upon the approach of the enemy. The Austrians
advanced to the palisades, without being discovered. There
were only twelve cannon fired upon them, and the musketry
was so weak that it did them no harm. The guard of the
Striegau gate was surprised, and they penetrated thence
through the works. During this confusion, the Austrian
prisoners threw off the mask, took possession of the interior
gate of the city, threw it open to the enemyâs advancing
troops, and made themselves masters of the whole place.
The only person who held out was the commander of the
Water fort; but his resistance was useless. Such an unexpected
misfortune changed all the plans of the king of
Prussia, who could only, during the remainder of this campaign,
defend, against a superior enemy, the fortresses and
territories he had left.

SECOND SIEGE, A.D. 1762.

The principal object of the next campaign was, for the
king of Prussia, the recapture of Schweidnitz. Frederick
had not one man more than was requisite for the execution
524

of this important enterprise. Seventy thousand Austrians
composed the army of Marshal Daun and the corps of
Laudon, Hadduck, Brentano, De Beck, and Ellershausen.
The Prussian army was not inferior, but troops must be
detached from it for the siege, of which M. de Tauziern had
the direction. He invested the place on the 4th of August,
and opened the trenches on the 7th; they commenced at
Briqueterie, and turned towards Warben, to embrace the
polygon of Jauernick, upon which the principal attack was
directed. M. de Guasco made a sortie, but it did not
answer his expectations; the Prussian dragoons beating the
Austrians back into the place. The king of Prussia thought
that Laudon, in order to succour the place, would take the
route of Sibelberg, Warther, and Langen-Brelau; he went,
therefore, to place himself at Pfaffendorff, whilst he caused
the post of Peila to be taken by the prince of Bevern.
Everything happened as the king of Prussia had foreseen.
Marshal Daun took the route of Langen-Brelau, attacked
the Prussians at Peila, was beaten and retreated. The
check experienced by Marshal Daun gave M. de Guasco a
bad augury of the fate of the place, and he made an attempt
to obtain an advantageous capitulation, with a free departure
for his garrison. The king of Prussia refused to comply,
because it would have been a capital error to allow ten thousand
men to march out of a city, of which, with a little
patience, he should render himself master; the Prussian
army would be weakened at least by four thousand men
necessary to garrison Schweidnitz, and the Prussian strength
would be lessened to the amount of fourteen thousand men.
The king of Prussia repaired in person, on the 20th of
September, before Schweidnitz, in order to push on the
works with more vigour. Lefebvre, the chief engineer, was
opposed to Gribeauvel, esteemed one of the first men of the
age for the defence of places. Lefebvre was soon outwitted
by the activity of the French engineer, who countermined
his mines and thwarted all his plans. Frederick was obliged
to take the details of the siege upon himself; the third
parallel was lengthened; a battery in breach was placed
there; ricochets were there established against Briqueterie,
with another battery upon Kuhberg; and the works of the
Austrians were taken in rear. Some branches of the mines
525

of the besieged were likewise sprung. The garrison made
two sorties, and dislodged the Prussians from a crowned
tunnel, from which they wished to debouch by fresh
branches. These manÅuvres prolonged the duration of the
siege, because they rendered a subterranean war necessary.
All the cannon of the place were, however, either
Ã©vasÃ©s
17

or dismounted; provisions were beginning to be scarce, and
the enemy would have been compelled to surrender on that
account, if a bomb, falling in front of the powder-magazine
of Jauernick, had not set fire to it, knocked down a part of
that fort, and killed three hundred Austrian grenadiers.
This accident, which laid the place open, obliged M. de
Guasco to beat a parley; he surrendered himself and his
garrison prisoners of war, on the 9th of October, and they
were marched away into Prussia.

The palpable lessons in these two sieges areâin the first,
the imprudence of the governor in granting opportunities
for treachery in prisoners; and in the second, the consummate
prudence of the king of Prussia in not allowing the
garrison to march out free, for the sake of quickly terminating
the siege.

ISMAIL.

A.D. 1790.

This
siege is particularly interesting at the present
moment, from the same parties being engaged in a war
arising from the same motives as those which led to this
sanguinary and memorable contest.

The position of IsmaÃ¯l, situated upon the Danube, in
Bessarabia, tempted the court of St. Petersburg, then at
war with the Turks, to endeavour to make the conquest of
it. This was one of the most important cities of the Turkish
empire in its European provinces. It had a numerous population,
and a garrison of forty-three thousand men, commanded
by Auduslu Pacha, one of the best of the Ottoman
generals. Provisions and munitions were abundant, and its
526

artillery powerful. Its walls, having a circuit of a mile
from one bank of the Danube to the other, were from three
to four toises high; at their feet was a fosse from seven to
eight toises deep; they were crowned by pieces of large
calibre. Between the polygons of Bender and Brock, there
was a
fausse-braie
, near a cavalier, capable of containing many
thousand soldiers. The water side was strongly defended
by batteries making a horizontal fire. At the beginning of
November, 1790, General Sudowitsch, with several bodies of
troops, made the approaches upon IsmaÃ¯l, whilst Admiral
Ribas blockaded it with a flotilla of a hundred row-boats.
They obtained some advantages at sea, but the rigours of the
winter obliged Sudowitsch to raise the siege. When informed
of this, the court of St. Petersburg, accustomed to
find no difficulty insurmountable, ordered Field-marshal
Potemkin to return immediately before IsmaÃ¯l and take
possession of it. The marshal felt all the difficulties of the
undertaking, but he obeyed. Arrived upon the Pruth, he
detached Lieutenant-General Potemkin with orders to bury
himself under the ruins of IsmaÃ¯l; but his efforts were not
more successful than those of Sudowitsch. Suwarrow then
came up with a regiment of infantry, a thousand Arnauts,
and two hundred Cossacks. The land army consisted of
twenty-eight thousand men, of whom near one-half were
Cossacks. The first care was to exercise these irregular
troops in the manÅuvres of an assault. Many days were
employed in reconnaissances, in order that the general officers
might be well acquainted with the posts they were to attack.
When all the observations necessary had been made, batteries
were raised, to lead the Turks to believe that they
were preparing to make a regular siege, and not to carry
IsmaÃ¯l by assault. On the 9th of December, Suwarrow sent
the seraskier a letter from Prince Potemkin, to persuade him
to surrender. The seraskier replied that he advised the
Russians to retire, if they were unwilling to experience
absolute want in an advanced season, and perish with famine
and misery before a place amply provided with everything.
Suwarrow, the next day, sent another note to the seraskier,
in which he announced to him, that if he did not hoist the
white flag that very day, the place should be taken by
assault and the whole garrison be put to the sword. Many
527

Turks were inclined to surrender; but the seraskier was
resolved to risk everything, and made no reply. Suwarrow
immediately assembled a council of war, and spoke as follows
to his troops: âBrave warriors, remember to-day all
your victories, and continue to prove that nothing can resist
the arms of Russians. The affair in hand is not one that
can be deferred, but it concerns an important place, the possession
of which will decide the glory of the campaign, and
which the proud Ottomans consider impregnable. Twice
already has the Russian army laid siege to IsmaÃ¯l, and twice
has it retreated from it. There only remains for us, as the
third attempt, to conquer or to die with glory.â This speech
inflamed the ardour of his soldiers, and an assault was
decided upon. Suwarrow received a courier from Prince
Potemkin, recommending him not to risk an assault if he
was not sure of succeeding. Suwarrow replied in these few
lines: âMy plan is settled. The Russian army has already
been twice at the gates of IsmaÃ¯l; it would be disgraceful
for it to retire a third time.â Some Cossacks deserted in
the evening, and informed the Ottomans of the approaching
attack. The principal part of the garrison remained all
night upon the ramparts. To make the Turks believe they
were short of powder, the Russians fired but little during
the night which preceded the assault. All measures being
taken, by four oâclock in the morning the columns were
formed: there were six on the land side and three upon the
Danube. The Cossacks destined to mount to the assault
were all on foot, and their lances had almost all been reduced
to five feet in length, to render them more useful in the

mÃªlÃ©e
. The first column by water, commanded by General
Islenief, consisted of two battalions of grenadiers, one battalion
of chasseurs, and two thousand five hundred Cossacks.
They had on board their shallops a hundred and thirty pieces
of cannon. The second column had the same number of
boats and cannon. In the third, and in the reserve, were two
hundred and thirty-seven pieces of cannon, divided among a
great number of barks, flat-bottomed boats, and floating batteries.
Among the troops embarked were the prince de
Ligni, the colonel duke de Richelieu, and the count de Langeron.
A circumstance is remembered in which the count
de Langeron, an emigrant, exhibited to the haughty Potemkin,
528

the czarinaâs favourite, a pride worthy of a Frenchman.
Langeron, as an emigrant, was talking with him about the
troubles which agitated France. âColonel,â said he, âyour
compatriots are mad; I should require nothing but my
grooms to bring them to reason.â Langeron could not
suffer his nation to thus spoken of, and replied haughtily,ââPrince,
I do not think that you and all your army could
do it.â

The weather, which had been fine and serene during the
night, grew cloudy towards daybreak, and a thick fog enveloped
the horizon till nine oâclock. All the columns marched
in silence. At the aspect of the walls, the whole army
halted in consternation. Suwarrow exclaimed to those who
were near him, âYou see those walls; they are very high;
but the empress commands us to take possession of them.â
He then suddenly fell upon his knees, arose, and marched to
the assault, followed by all his army. The Turks did not
fire a shot till the Russians were within three or four hundred
paces of them, but then saluted them with a shower of

mitrailles
, which did them great injury. They however approached
the fosse, in which there was in several places
water up to the shoulders, threw in their fascines, planted
their ladders against the ramparts, many parts of which were
so high that they were obliged to tie two together, although
every one was five toises long. As in some places the besiegers
did not find this expedient quick enough, they
assisted each other with as much vivacity as address, and
climbed up the ramparts with the aid of their bayonets. The
arquebusiers fired from the edge of the fosse upon the
Turks who defended the ramparts, to prevent them from
beating back the assailants. The second column, commanded
by the Marshal de Lasci, arrived first, but was not assisted
with sufficient energy by the first and third. The first had
had to overcome a great difficulty: it had met with a chain
of strong palisades, which extended to the banks of the
Danube. The grenadiers, who were at the extremity of the
palisades, rushed against them, one after the other, to turn
them; and those most distant from that spot jumped over
them. Another fosse was yet to be got over before they
reached the ramparts. The Russian grenadiers took possession
of the first bastion, and attacked without order the
529

cavalier which was between that work and the second; but
in doing so, they lost many men. Kutusow, who had taken
the two left polygons on the side of the left bank of the
Danube, would have arrived upon the rampart at the same
time as the second column, if he had not been obliged to
send assistance to the fourth and fifth columns, which had
met with a vigorous resistance. The fosse was full of water
at the place where these columns were obliged to cross; the
men, being up to their middles, soaked their long Cossack
clothes, and had great trouble in disengaging themselves
from them. They mounted the ladders, but when they came
to the ramparts, they could not maintain themselves there;
the two columns were thrown back at the same time. They
were separated by the gate of Bender; eight or ten thousand
Turks made a sortie from that gate, uttering frightful
war-cries. Among these were a great number of women
armed with poniards. The besieged charged all at once, in
all parts; the infantry of the reserve came to the rescue,
and made way with their bayonets; the Cossacks, finding
themselves supported, repulsed the Turks. Such as could
not gain the bridge to re-enter IsmaÃ¯l, were cut in pieces or
smothered in the fosse. The Russians then made a fresh
effort, surmounted all resistance, and established themselves
upon the rampart of the bastion which was assigned to
them. Kutusow, however, remarked that the two battalions
of reserve, although masters of the rampart, could not yet
hold out against the enemy; he in consequence sent them a
battalion of chasseurs, who enabled them to keep their position.
Every bastion having a powder-magazine under the
rampart, the conquerors immediately established a strong
guard there, in order that the enemy might not be able to
set fire to it and blow up the troops. There consequently
followed slight actions between the besiegers and the
besieged, who still continued to endeavour to introduce
themselves there, but they could not succeed; so that no
accident happened. Day began to appear, and every one
could ascertain his position, which, till that time, had only
been indicated by the different war-cries of the two nations.
Whilst the Turkish infantry was fighting in the fosses near
the Bender gate, a numerous body of cavalry fell upon the
camp of the besiegers, where the Cossacks received them
530

with so much vigour, that scarcely any of them returned,
and the Bender gate fell into the hands of the Russians.

Whilst the land columns were marching against IsmaÃ¯l,
other columns were formed upon the Danube. The first,
composed of a hundred boats, manned by troops, prepared
to make a descent, advanced in two lines, keeping up a continual
fire; the second line, consisting of brigantines, floating
batteries, double shallops, and
lanÃ§ons
, followed it. The fire
became still more warm as these two lines approached each
other. The Turks had on the water side a work of small
height, but great strength, furnished with eighty-three
cannon of large calibre, fifteen mortars, and a howitzer of
six hundred pounds of balls. The fire of the mortars of the
second line covered the cannonade of the first; when they
had arrived at some hundreds of paces from the shore, the
second line divided, and placed itself on the two wings of
the first; in this fashion it formed a half-circle. Both sides
kept up a warm fire of
mitrailles
, and the combat lasted an
hour. But as it was still night, some Russian battalions
only suffered, without any vessel being sunk. About seven
in the morning the total descent was effected. The Turks
had abandoned the few vessels they had left. The resistance
was brave and persistent, particularly on this side, which
was defended by more than ten thousand Turks. The
greater part of these were put to the sword, the rest saved
themselves in the
chanas
, or houses solidly built with
stone.

At eight oâclock, the Russians were masters of the ramparts
on the water side, as well as on that of the land. A
terrible conflict then commenced in the interior of the city,
in the streets and public places, to which the inhabitants
came from all parts. There were skirmishes beyond number,
both sides fighting with equal inveteracy. The Turks
defended themselves with desperation, maintaining an incessant
fire from the windows, particularly in the narrow streets.
The Russians swept the larger ones with the fire of twenty
field-pieces, to which the Turks, having no cannon but in
their chanas, could not respond. There were two thousand
Turks in the first chana that was attacked: they made great
havoc among the Russians with their artillery. Suwarrow
ordered it to be taken, and it was escaladed, in spite of a
531

determined resistance, and, for the first time, during the day
some hundreds of prisoners were made; the unfortunate
Auduslu Pacha had taken refuge in a still more considerable
chana. The combat there lasted more than two hours;
cannon were required to batter in the gate. Two thousand
of the best Janissaries defended themselves in this place with
all the rage of despair; but the Russian grenadiers rushed
in the moment there was an opening, with advanced bayonets,
and all were cut to pieces, with the exception of a very few
hundred prisoners: the pacha was of this number. He
came out into the open place; a chasseur perceiving a rich
poniard in his girdle, thought it his duty to take it from
him. As several Turks still had arms, a Janissary, who was
near the seraskier, endeavouring to repulse the chasseur with
his sabre, wounded a captain of chasseurs in the face. The
Russians instantly charged their bayonets upon all that remained:
they massacred the greater part, the brave seraskier
being of the number: scarcely a hundred men of his immediate
train escaped. Petty conflicts still continued in every
place capable of the slightest defence; every post was
carried at a heavy expense of blood. The terrible resistance
made by the Turks was more like frantic rage than the opposition
of trained soldiers; the women even fearlessly encountered
the Russians, armed with poniards and other weapons.
All the Russian commanders faced danger with heroic
courage, and their soldiers as bravely seconded them; the

mÃªlÃ©e
lasted ten entire hours, without the Russians in the
least heeding the superiority of the Turks in number. The
city was given up to pillage; thirty-three thousand Ottomans
there perished in one day! and ten thousand were made
prisoners! A single man had saved himself in a fortified
house; he was slightly wounded, but contrived to drop from
a window into the Danube, where he was fortunate enough
to meet with a plank, by means of which he gained the opposite
shore. This man carried the vizier the news of the loss
of IsmaÃ¯l; there were no less than six sultans among the
dead. The Russians lost fifteen thousand men. Suwarrow
wrote Prince Potemkin these few words: â
The Russian
flag floats over the ramparts of IsmaÃ¯l.
â He was equally
laconic to the empress Catherine II. â
Madame, the haughty
IsmaÃ¯l is at your feet.
â The booty of this city was valued
532

at ten millions of piastres. Inaccessible to every interested
view, Suwarrow, according to his custom, abstained from
sharing any part of it; satisfied with the harvest of glory
he had reaped, he disdained wealth. But he did not, in a
similar spirit, respect the rights of humanity; the massacre
of thirty-three thousand men in one day, with the murder of
women, children, and unarmed soldiers, procured him the
name of
Muley
IsmaÃ¯l, in allusion to the barbarous emperor
of Morocco, who had borne that name. The empress of
Russia caused a medal to be struck to perpetuate the memory
of this important conquest. A year after, IsmaÃ¯l, which had
cost so much blood, was restored to the Turks as a guarantee
of the peace between the two powersâand forty-eight thousand
human beings had been slaughtered, and countless
women and children had perished or been rendered miserable,
to secure the conquest of it!

âO, but man, proud man!

Dressed in a little brief authority,

Most ignorant of what heâs most assured,

His glassy essence,âlike an angry ape,

Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,

As make the angels weep!â

BOMMEL.

A.D. 1599.

If
this siege were not interesting on account of its forming
part of the noble struggle which rescued the Netherlands
from the domination of the Spaniards, it would command
our notice from being the time and place when one of the
great scientific operations of war was first brought into use.

The Spaniards having penetrated, in 1599, into the island
of Bommel, formed by the Wahal, in the duchy of Gueldres,
hastened to lay siege to the capital city of that island.
Prince Maurice came to its succour, with the greater part of
his army. He encamped on the opposite bank of the Wahal,
reinforced the garrison with a thousand men, and, with great
rapidity, threw two bridges over the river, above and below
the besieged city; the first, destined for the infantry, was
533

but a collection of little barks; but the second, for the
cavalry, was composed of large pontoons, and was wide enough
for the passage of two chariots abreast. Having completed
this operation, he ordered three thousand infantry and four
hundred horse, whom he charged most particularly with the
defence of Bommel, to cross over into the island. This
place being too small for such a numerous garrison, it was
lodged without, and immediately covered itself with a good
intrenchment, well flanked with redoubts, and defended by
a wide ditch. This intrenchment furnished the first model
of what has since been called the
covered way
.
18
This happy
invention contributed much to the failure of the Spanish
expedition. They had not yet perfected their intrenchments,
when the Dutch artillery, established on the banks of the
Wahal, the fire of the armed barks, and that of the place,
thundered all at once against their ramparts. The Spaniards,
however, after many efforts, succeeded in sheltering themselves
from this multiplied tempest; they raised good intrenchments,
they placed cannon in battery, and began to
assail in earnest both the city and the intrenched camp.
The besieged did not oppose a less number of works or less
courage to the Spanish attacks. Towards the end of May,
the garrison of Bommel fell all at once upon every one of the
enemyâs quarters; it might have been supposed that they
came to fight a regular battle, and not to clear out trenches
or overthrow works. Both sides fought with the greatest
resolution; but at length the resistance of the Spaniards
disheartened the Dutch, and they retreated after a contest
534

of three hours. They returned to the charge the following
night, persuaded that they should surprise the besiegers.
They succeeded in the first moments; but the Spaniards
having recovered themselves, the Dutch were obliged to
abandon their attack. Three days after, they perseveringly
made fresh efforts, which proved likewise unfortunate.
Fatigued with their endeavours to overcome so many
obstacles and such obstinate enemies, the Spaniards, finding
they made no considerable progress, determined to raise the
siege towards the end of June, after having lost two
thousand men.

BARCELONA.

A.D. 1705.

However
unimportant it may appear in the vast page of
history, no English account of sieges can be complete
without a notice of that of Barcelona, in which he who
may be called the last of our knights maintained so nobly
that British good faith which we claim as our proudest
characteristic.

In 1705, the earl of Peterborough commanded the army
of the Archduke Charles, competitor with Philip V., the
grandson of Louis XIV., in conjunction with the prince of
Darmstadt. The siege was dragged on to a great length,
and Peterborough was thinking of re-embarking his English
soldiers, when he learnt that the prince of Darmstadt had
been killed in carrying the intrenchments which covered
Mount Joire and the city. A few days after, a bomb burst
in the fort over the powder-magazine; the fort was taken,
and the city consented to capitulate. The viceroy was
conferring with Peterborough at the city gates, and the
articles were not yet signed, when, on a sudden, cries and
screams of distress were heard in the city: âYou are
betraying us!â exclaimed the viceroy; âwe are capitulating
loyally, and there are your English, who have entered the
city by the ramparts, slaughtering, pillaging, and violating.â
âYou are mistaken,â replied Peterborough, âit must be
the troops of the prince of Darmstadt. There is only one
535

means of saving your city; let me enter the place at once
with my English; I will make all quiet, and will then return
to the gate, to complete the capitulation.â The tone with
which he spoke this convinced the Spanish governor of his
good faith, and he was allowed to enter Barcelona with his
officers. As he expected, he found the Germans and
Catalans sacking the houses of the principal citizens; he
made them abandon their prey, and drove them out. Among
the victims about to be sacrificed to the lust of the soldiery
was the duchess of Popoli; he extricated her from the
hands of the ruffians, and restored her to her husband.
When the tumult was appeased, he returned to the gate
and terminated the capitulation, offering a fine example of
observance of his word given to a conquered enemy.

Lord Peterborough was certainly more an eccentric man
than a great one, and yet, like Don Quixoteâs, many of his
eccentricities had a strong leaning to the side of greatness.
Plutarch would have made a fine story of the above
anecdote; it belongs to the character of the real hero, of
whom, though abounding in great soldiers, modern history
contains so few.

To show the importance of such a trait to the reputation
of a nation, we have only to observe with what high praise
the historians of other countries mention this act of simple
good faith.

GIBRALTAR.

A.D. 1779â1783.

As
in the history of mankind there are some persons so
remarkable and universally known as to make a notice of
them almost a work of supererogation, so there are events,
which, from the interest they have excited, and the consequences
that have attended them, demand, in a work of this
description, a much less detailed account than others of
less importance: they have created deep and widely-spread
excitement during their enactment, and have produced historians
worthy to commemorate them. And such is the
siege of Gibraltar. This stupendous rock has now
536

remained in the hands of the British one hundred and fifty
years! We can only judge of the anomaly of this circumstance
by bringing it home by comparison. Suppose the
Spaniards, in their zeal for religion, had determined to seize
upon the rocky point of the Landâs End, in Cornwall, or
the Isle of Anglesea, in Wales, to facilitate their intercourse
with Catholic Ireland, this would have been with them
quite as legitimate an object as our trade with the Levant
is to us. And yet we hold it, in spite of all the hostile
efforts of the Spaniards to retake it; and what is still more
strange, in spite of treaties of peace, at which such chance
acquisitions are generally restored to the right owner. In
the same manner the British held Calais, a French town,
from the reign of Edward III., 1346, to that of Henry II.
of France and Mary of England, when it was taken by
surprise by the duke of Guise in 1557. As may be
naturally supposed, the proud Spaniards have not quietly
submitted to such a disgrace as that of having an inseparable
portion of their country held by a foreign and frequently
rival power: they have made several efforts to regain it, the
most conspicuous of which comes within the scope of this
work.

But, as we said above, the history of this siege has been
so well written and is so generally known, that Drinkwater
has placed it in the same position as Homer has that of
Troy;âwe could not pass it by, but yet we are not called
upon to be particular in our account of it: the world does
not stand in need of our history; it has one, better than
any we could produce. Gibraltar was one of the fruits of
the War of Succession: England took up arms to keep a
Bourbon from the throne of Spain, and, during the conflict,
an enterprising admiral, Sir George Rooke, added this gem
to her crown. There are politicians who think the retention
more a point of honour than a real advantage, but such
discussions are not within our limits.

The war of 1762 did not present a favourable opportunity
for retaking Gibraltar; Chatham was too vigorous a minister
to allow a chance of such a loss; but England being at war
with her colonies and with France, encouraged Spain, in
1779, to come to a rupture with her, for the well-understood
purpose of attempting the great object of the national wish.
537

That this was so, was rendered plain by preparations to cut
off the African supplies of provisions to the rock, before
war had actually taken place.

Gibraltar is situated in Andalusia, the most southern
province of Spain. The rock is seven miles in circumference,
running out into the sea in the form of a promontory
of more than three miles in length, and is joined to the
continent by an isthmus of low sand. The promontory, or
rock, at the foot of which stands the town, is upwards of
one thousand three hundred feet in height, and appears to
have been formerly surrounded by the sea. The breadth of
the isthmus at the foot of the rock is about nine hundred
yards, but grows much wider as it approaches the country.
Across this isthmus, at about a mileâs distance from the
garrison, the Spaniards have drawn up a fortified line, extending
one thousand seven hundred yards, and embracing
both shores, with a strong fort of masonry at each end.
That both parties, under such extraordinary circumstances,
should exhaust art in their means of defence, and be always
on the watch against surprise, we may readily imagine; but
what gives the garrison a great advantage in this respect is
its commanding height, from which it can see everything
that approaches it, by either land or sea. Thus in the whole
of this long siege, they appear to have been able to ascertain
all that was going on in the enemyâs camp, and to descry
every hostile vessel in time to be prepared for it.

Until we come to the great
finale
, this siege was little
more than a blockade, and that imperfect. And yet, with
the exception of the âIliad,â we know of none that is so
interesting. Drinkwaterâs account has exactly the same
charm as Robinson Crusoeâs journal; the events are so
minute, and brought so completely home to the apprehension
of the reader by the plain and graphic style of the author,
that you forget it is an awful reality, and enjoy it as you
would a fiction. But such a narrative we cannot adopt into
our pages: to transfer it wholly would be dishonest towards
a fine work; to garble it would not redound to our credit.

When the re-capture of this member of their own country
was undertaken, as there was much difficulty, there was proportionate
glory in the enterprise, and the eyes of all Europe
were turned towards the Herculean straits. Every exertion
538

was made by Spainâneither labour, money, nor blood was
spared. The valour of her troops was ably directed by her
generals, and persistently exercised through length of time
and difficulties of obstacles enough to cool the ardour of the
most devoted partisans. But in addition to the immense
advantage of situation, upon a lofty impregnable rock, open
to almost constant succour by sea, the British garrison had
the still further good fortune of being commanded by a
governor most admirably suited to the post. As you read
the details of this memorable siege, you cannot help being
struck with the idea that General Elliottâs government was
a parental one. Never-flinching courage, sleepless watchfulness,
consummate prudence, and far-discerning foresight,
were joined in him to a kindliness of heart and an urbanity
of manners, that made all he required from the troops and
officers he was placed over a labour of love. And yet his

bonhomie
did not overcome his judgment; though never
severe, he was never falsely indulgent; he could punish when
he was called upon to do so for the public good, as readily,
though not as willingly, as he could encourage merit or
devotedness by promotion or reward. It may be asserted
that Elliott was never so placed as to display the genius of
a great commander: but this we deny. In a difficult, isolated
position, he was in no instance at a loss; no danger
approached him that he was not prepared to meet, and no
opportunity for gaining an advantage offered itself that he
did not seize.

The two points were,âfor the English, the rock, town,
and fortress of Gibraltar; for the Spaniards and French,
Algeziras, a town situated on the other side of the bay, five
and a half miles from Gibraltar. Algeziras had been a city
of great importance, and in the middle of the fourteenth
century was wrested by Alonzo XI., king of Castile, from
the hands of the Moors. This appears to have been a kind
of crusade, and one in which the English chivalry took a
prominent part; John of Gaunt, and the earls of Derby,
Leicester, Salisbury, and Lincoln, all being present. It is
likewise said that cannon were first used by the Moors in
this siege against their assailants, and were adopted by the
English, two years after, at the battle of Crecy, from
observing the powerful effects of them. The Spaniards had
539

the great advantage of being masters of the country behind
and around them; and though the English had a small naval
force in their port, they never had sufficient to prevent constant
annoyances from the gun and bomb-boats of Algeziras.
Many an anticipated succour, in a vessel which was viewed
with delight from the rock, was cut off by the Spanish boats,
and carried into Algeziras before the eyes of the disappointed
garrison.

With the commencement of the war in 1779, the siege of
Gibraltar may be said to have begun. It was, in truth, but
an imperfect blockade, but it subjected the garrison to all
the watchfulness, labour, and preparation of a real siege.
The Spaniards were actively employed in fortifying all their
best points; they encamped before the garrison, and erected
additional batteries in their lines, but still did not fire upon
the town or fort. General Elliott, however, found their
proceedings so unmistakable in their purpose, and knowing
that war had been declared, he saluted them at their works
with a few rounds of shot.

This took place on the 5th of July, 1779; and from that
date to the 26th of November, 1781, the siege or blockade
was one continuance of mutual attempts at annoyance,
interspersed with occasional want of provisions and attacks
of the scurvy on the part of the garrison, frequent boat-assaults,
always attended with repulses, on the side of the
allies; with a strange but perpetual desertion of individuals
from both garrison and army. But at the last-named period
the enemy had constructed such formidable batteries, and
appeared to be approaching so inconveniently near, that
General Elliott determined upon the bold expedient of a
sortie. This was effected with his usual prudence, foresight,
and spirit. As soon as the gates were shut, and the evening
gun fired, a considerable detachment was ordered to assemble
on the Red Sands, at midnight, with devils, fire-fagots, and
working implements, to make a sortie on the enemyâs batteries;
the general and other officers to be employed were
in the mean time convened,
and, lest some matters might
have escaped him in the multiplicity of arrangements, the
governor desired every person to propose, without restraint,
whatever would, in his or their opinion, further promote the
success of the enterprise
. We place the last passage in
540

italics, as a lesson to self-sufficient commanders: no captain
ever more completely performed the duties intrusted to him
by his country, and yet he was never averse to receiving
advice from the lowest of his staff. On a subsequent occasion
an important use of red-hot shot was suggested to him,
by Lieutenant-General Boyd, his second in command, and,
without the least of the paltry jealousy some superiors
would have felt, he not only openly adopted the idea, but
intrusted the execution of it to his friend who had thought
of it.

âThe detachment being formed in three lines, the right
column in the rear and the left in front, tools for demolishing
the works were delivered to the workmen, and the following
directions for their destination were communicated to the
principal officers:ââThe right column to lead and march
through Forbesâs barrier for the extremity of the parallel,
keeping the eastern fence of the gardens close on their left.
The centre immediately to follow, marching through Bay-side
barrier, and directing their route through the gardens
for the mortar-batteries. The left column to bring up the
rear, marching along the strand for the gun-batteries. No
person to advance before the front unless ordered by the
officer commanding the column: and the most profound
silence to be observed, as the success of the enterprise may
depend thereon. The 12th and Hardenbergâs regiments to
form in front of the works, as assaulting corps, and are to
detach to the right and left, as occasion may require. The
reserve to take post on the furthest gardens. When the
works are carried, the attacking troops are to take up
their ground in the following manner:âThe grenadiers of
Redenâs and La Motteâs behind the parallel; the 39th and
73rd flank companies along the front of the fourth branch;
and the 72nd grenadiers and light infantry with their right
to the fourth branch and left to the beach.â

âThe force consisted of ninety-nine officers, one hundred
and forty-seven subalterns, and two thousand and thirty-four
rank and file.

âBy the time the destination of the columns was made
known to the different officers, and other arrangements had
taken place, the morning of the 27th was far advanced; and
as the moon had then nearly finished her nightly course,
541

the detachment, about a quarter before three oâclock, began
its march by files from the right of the rear line to the
attack. Although nothing could exceed the silence and
attention of the troops, the enemyâs advanced sentries discovered
the right column before they passed Forbesâs
barrier, and after challenging fired upon them. Lieutenant-Colonel
Hugo, commanding this column, finding they were
alarmed, immediately formed the attacking corps, and pushed
on at a brisk pace for the extremity of the parallel; there,
finding no opposition, he took possession, and the pioneers
began to dismantle the works. Part of Hardenbergâs regiment,
which was attached to this column, mistook the route
of the grenadiers, owing to the darkness of the morning;
and in pursuing their own, found themselves, before they
discovered their error, in front of the St. Carlos battery.
In this dilemma no other alternative offered but pressing
forward, which they gallantly did, after receiving the enemyâs
fire. Upon mounting the parapet, the enemy precipitately
retreated, and with great difficulty they descended the
stupendous work, forming with their left to the tower.
They were thus situated, when Lieutenant-Colonel Duchenhausen,
at the head of the 39th flank companies, entered
the St. Carlos battery, and naturally mistaking them for
his opponents, fired, and wounded several. Further mischief
was, however, prevented by the countersign; and the
Hanoverians joined the remainder of the corps, which now
formed
en potence
in front of the parallel. The 73rd flank
companies were equally successful in their attacks, and
Lieutenant-Colonel Trigge, with the grenadiers and light
company of the 72nd regiment, carried the gun-batteries
with great gallantry. The ardour of the assailants was
irresistible. The enemy on every side gave way, abandoning
in an instant, and with the utmost precipitation, those
works which had cost them so much expense, and employed
so many months to perfect.

âWhen our troops had taken possession, the attacking corps
formed agreeably to their orders, to repel any attack which
the enemy might make to prevent the destruction of the
works, whilst the 12th regiment took post in front of the
St. Carlos battery, to sustain the western attack; and the
reserve, under Major Maxwell, drew up in the further gardens.
542

The exertions of the workmen and artillery were
wonderful. The batteries were soon in a state for the fire-fagots
to operate, and the flames spread with astonishing
rapidity into every part. The columns of fire and smoke
which rolled from the works beautifully illuminated the
troops and neighbouring objects, forming altogether a
coup
dâÅil
from the rock, not possible to be described.

âIn an hour, the object of the sortie was fully effected;
and trains being laid to the magazines, Brigadier Ross
ordered the advanced corps to withdraw, and the sustaining
regiments to cover their retreat; but by some oversight, the
barrier at Forbesâs was locked after the flank companies had
returned; which might have proved of serious consequence
to Hardenbergâs regiment, as they were from that circumstance
under the necessity of following the 12th regiment
through Bay-side barrier.

âSeveral small quantities of powder took fire whilst the
detachment was on its retreat; and just as the rear had got
within the garrison, the principal magazine blew up with a
tremendous explosion, throwing up vast pieces of timber,
which, falling into the flames, added to the general conflagration.
Although the enemy must have been early alarmed,
not the smallest effort was made to save or avenge their works.
The fugitives seemed to communicate a panic to the whole;
and instead of annoying the English troops from the flanking
forts, their artillery directed a ridiculous fire towards the
town and our upper batteries, whence we continued a warm
and well-served discharge of round shot on their forts and
barrier. Only two officers and sixteen privates were taken
prisoners, and, so little opposition being made, very few were
killed in the works.

âThus was this important attack executed beyond the
most sanguine expectations of every one. The event challenges
greater admiration, when we reflect that the batteries
were distant near three-quarters of a mile from the garrison,
and only within a few hundred yards of a besieging enemyâs
lines, mounting one hundred and thirty-five pieces of heavy
artillery. The detachment had only four privates killed, and
one officer and twenty-four privates wounded. The ordnance
spiked in the enemyâs works amounted to ten thirteen-inch
mortars and eighteen twenty-six pounders. Although subject
543

to the little derangements naturally attending on a
night attack, not one musket, working-tool, or other instrument,
was left behind.â

Such is Captain Drinkwaterâs account of a spirited and
successful action of which he was an eye-witness. The
French historians of the siege say that the British could not
stand against the fire of the batteries, and retreated. This is
one of the innumerable contradictions to truth offered by
French authors whenever the military honour of their country
is concerned. They always forget that their contemporaries
and posterity will judge which party was victor in a
conflict, by the results. Victor Hugo
poetically
said, that
Buonaparte was never conquered:
at Moscow it was fireâat
Waterloo it was fate
. Headers of history are nevertheless
convinced of the reality of the two defeats, by the events
which followed them.

The affair had now been so prolonged, and had excited so
much attention throughout Europe, that the Spaniards and
French began to think it a point of honour to subdue this
general on his rock; and the duke de Crillon, accompanied
by the eminent French engineer DâArÃ§on, and followed by
an army of thirty thousand men, came to Algeziras. Immediately
upon his arrival, DâArÃ§on changed the mode of attack:
it had been previously mostly confined to the land side of
the rock; he, most unfortunately for the cause he served,
directed almost all his offensive efforts from the sea, and yet
by no means neglecting his fortifications. General Elliottâs
principal
extraordinary
preparation consisted in grates and
various apparatus for heating shot, as he found red-hot balls
by far the most efficient instrument of destruction he could
employ. But he was too watchful and prudent a commander
to let this engross all his attention: in addition to constant
labours at the works, he ordered holes to be blasted in the
rocks, nearly on a level with the water, from which he could
pour showers of stones and other missiles upon his assailants.
He likewise had a number of gun-boats built; and,
having received supplies and reinforcements from the British
fleet under Lord Hood, he felt himself in a condition to
cope with his powerful enemies. Determined to have no
idle hands, even the serjeants and drummers were armed
with muskets; and musicians, who had before been exempted
544

from duty, had to exchange their instruments for firelocks
and shovels. The strength of the garrison with the marine
brigade, including officers, amounted to seven thousand five
hundred men.

The comte dâArtois and the duke de Bourbon joined the
Spanish and French armies; after whose arrival many civilities
passed between the besieging camp and the garrison.
The French general sent presents of game, fruit, vegetables,
and ice, to the governor, accompanied by a letter breathing
the highest respect and admiration for his courage, talents,
and firmness. Here again is the beautiful simplicity, combined
with military virtues, displayed in the character of
Elliott; he might be imagined an ancient Roman rather than
a modern soldier of fortune. He accepts the presents with
a courtesy due to the kindness with which they were offered;
but requests they may not be repeated, as it is his pride and
pleasure to live as plainly as the humblest soldier in his
army.

After a good deal of sharp preliminary sparring on both
sides, the awful conflict came on. In our account of this,
we shall mostly adhere to the very words of the historian of
the siege, convinced that no other can lay it so plainly and
yet so interestingly before our readers.

âIn the evening of the 7th of September, a little before
midnight, two large lights appeared on the shore of the
Orange-grove battery, and at the same time, two similar
fires were seen behind Fort St. Philip; whence, if a line was
produced, it would to appearance have intersected the former
about eight hundred or nine hundred yards to the north-west
of the old mole head. These unusual signals made
many conjecture that the enemy were sounding in that
quarter. A few rounds were accordingly fired at intervals
in that direction from the north bastion.

âBy the morning of the 8th, the preparations in the department
of the artillery, under General Boydâs direction, were
completed, and the success of the attack in a great measure
depending upon embracing the favourable moment, it was
no longer deferred. At seven oâclock, the town-guards
being relieved, the firing commenced from all the northern
batteries which bore upon the western part of the parallel,
and was supported through the day with admirable precision
545

and vivacity. The effect of the red-hot shot and carcases
exceeded our most sanguine expectations. In a few hours,
the Mahon battery of six guns, with the battery of two guns
on its flank, and great part of the adjoining parallel, were on
fire, and the flames, notwithstanding the enemyâs exertions
to extinguish them, burnt so rapidly, that the whole of these
works before night were consumed. The St. Carlos and
St. Martin batteries, however, on this occasion, escaped
the fate they had formerly experienced, but they were so
much damaged, that the greater part was taken down.

âFor near an hour, the enemy continued silent spectators
of our cannonade. About eight, they fired a few guns from
the St. Martin battery, and between nine and ten returned
our fire from Fort St. Philip and Barbara, with the seven-gun
battery in the lines, and soon after, from eight new mortar-batteries
in the parallel. This tardiness in returning our
fire in some degree we attributed to the works being confused
with materials, and some of the batteries being deficient
in ammunition. It might, however, be owing to want
of discretionary orders, as an officer of rank was observed to
enter the lines about the time when their cannonade
became general; a reinforcement also marched down from
the camp.

âThe astonishing bravery displayed by the enemy in their
repeated attempts to extinguish the flames, could not fail to
attract the particular notice and admiration of the besieged.
Urged on most probably by emulation, they performed prodigies
of valour, so that their loss, under so well-directed a
fire, must have been very considerable. The French brigade
had one hundred and forty killed and wounded, and the
Spanish casualties most likely bore an equal proportion.
About four oâclock in the afternoon the cannonade abated
on both sides, and the enemy soon after were totally silent,
though the garrison continued its usual fire. The British
had two or three killed and several wounded. Lieutenant
Boag, of the artillery, and Ensign Gordon, of the 58th
regiment, were of the latter number. The former officer had
been wounded before; on this occasion, he was pointing a
gun from Hanover battery in the lines, when a shell fell in
the battery. He had scarcely time to throw himself down
in an embrasure, when the shell burst, and fired the gun
546

under the muzzle of which he lay. The report immediately
deprived him of hearing, and it was some time before he
recovered a tolerable use of that faculty. Major Martin, of
the same corps, had likewise a very fortunate escape from a
twenty-six pounder, which shot away the cock of his hat close
to the crown. This anecdote is inserted because it is commonly
believed that if a cannon-ball of large diameter passes
so near the head of a person, the wind of it is generally fatal.
The major was considerably stunned by the passage of the
shot, but experienced little further injury. In the forenoon
of the 8th, two more ships of the line removed to the
Orange-grove, followed some time afterwards by twenty-two
gun and mortar boats; and in the evening, one of the French
men-of-war joined them from Algeziras. In the course of
the day, a number of troops were embarked on board such
of the battering-ships as were finished; and at night, the
garrison artillery replaced the ammunition in the expense
magazines, which had been used to such good purpose in the
morning.

âThis unexpected insult undoubtedly precipitated the
dukeâs measures; and, by provoking him to the attack
before the preparations in the other departments were
ready to combine with him in a general and powerful effort
against the garrison, served greatly to frustrate the enterprise.
Apprehensive probably, that, elated by their good
fortune, they might renew their attempts finally to destroy
the land-works which had escaped, the duke determined to
avoid the blow, which might be so dangerous in its consequences,
by opening his batteries, even in their unfinished
state. Actuated most probably by these motives, the embrasures
of the new batteries were unmasked during the
night of the 8th; and the succeeding morning at daybreak,
the garrison were surprised to find every appearance in their
works for firing upon them. Two rockets from the forts in
the lines were the signals to begin; and the cannonade commenced
at half-past five oâclock, with a volley of about sixty
shells from all their mortar batteries in the parallel, succeeded
by a general discharge of their cannon, amounting
in the whole to about one hundred and seventy pieces of
ordnance, all of large calibre. Their firing was powerful,
and entirely directed against the works of the besieged, but
547

was not, after the first round, altogether so tremendous and
destructive as might have been expected from such a train of
artillery. At intervals, from ten to twenty shells were in the
air at the same moment, but their effects were not equal to
the numbers expended. The town, southward of the Kingâs
bastion, was little affected; but the northern front, and line-wall,
leading from the Grand Parade to the North bastion,
were exceedingly warm; and the lines and Landport were
greatly annoyed by the shells from the howitzers, which were
distributed in various parts of their parallel; Montagueâs
and Orangeâs bastions seemed to be the centre of the
enemyâs cross-fire, whilst the line-wall in their vicinity and
to the southward was taken
Ã  revers
by the shot which
passed over the lines from the sixty-four-gun battery.

âNot imagining, from the rough appearance of the enemyâs
works, that they could possibly retaliate so soon, the guards
and pickets of the north end of the garrison were for some
time exposed, and some casualties occurred; but they soon
discovered whence they were chiefly annoyed, and consequently
became more cautious. Lieutenant Wharton, of
the 73rd regiment, was dangerously wounded at Landport.

âWhilst the land-batteries were thus pouring forth their
vengeance upon the northern front, nine line-of-battle ships,
including those under the French flag, got under way from
the Orange-grove, and passing along the sea-line, discharged
several broadsides at the garrison, and particularly at a
settee which had just arrived under their guns from Algiers.
When this squadron had got round Europa Point, they
suddenly wore, and returning along the Europa, Rosia, and
New Mole battery, commenced a regular and heavy fire upon
the garrison. The marine brigade and artillery returned
the salute till they passed, when the men-of-war wore and
returned to the eastward. About the same time that the
enemy were thus amusing the garrison at the southward,
fifteen gun and mortar boats approached the town, and continued
their fire for some time; but the artillery giving them
a warm reception from the Kingâs bastion, two of them
were towed off with precipitation, and the rest retired in
great disorder. One was thought to be very considerably
damaged, and some imagined that her gun was thrown overboard
to save her from sinking.

548

âThis mode of attacking on all sides exactly corresponded
with what the garrison had heard was the plan of
M. dâArÃ§on. He hoped, probably, to confound and
overwhelm them, by presenting destruction under such
various forms, and by the enormous quantity of fire which
he poured in upon the garrison. The governor, however,
did not approve of his troops being thus subjected to be
harassed at his pleasure, and resolved, if possible, to put a
stop to the sea attacks. For this purpose the furnaces and
grates for heating shot, at the New Mole, were ordered to
be lighted, and some new arrangements took place in the
ordnance upon Windmill-hill. Towards dusk the enemy
abated in the fire from their cannon, increasing, however,
in the expenditure of shells, which being generally fired
with short fuses, broke in the air. This practice seemed
well calculated for the purposes in view. In the day they
could observe with greater certainty the effect of their shot,
and alter as circumstances directed; the firing at night
must unavoidably be less depended upon: shells were therefore
burst over the heads of the workmen of the besieged,
to prevent them, if possible, from repairing at night the
damage received in the day. Nevertheless it did not obstruct
the duties in the department of the engineers, and the artillery
were not hindered from further completing the expense
magazine with ammunition. The 97th regiment
19
was now
so far recovered as for some time to assist in the fatigue
duties of the garrison; and this day the officers, with one
hundred men, were added to the general roster. The town
guards were likewise ordered to assemble in Southport
ditch.

âThe enemyâs men-of-war, as General Elliott had expected,
repeated their attack very early in the morning of the 10th.
Each ship carried a light at her mizen-peak; but they did
not appear near enough to produce much effect. They were
received with a well-supported fire, and the next morning
one of them was to be observed at Algeziras, with her bowsprit
unshipped. The remaining eight renewed their cannonade
about nine in the forenoon, and killed two of the
marine brigade, and wounded a serjeant of artillery and two
549

other men. After they had passed as before, they wore
ship, apparently with an intention of continuing their visits;
but suddenly put about, hauled their wind, and anchored off
the Orange-grove. The governor was afterwards informed
that the discovery of a red-hot shot on board one of the
ships was the immediate cause of this hasty manÅuvre.

âThe enemy continued their firing from the isthmus,
recommencing at morning gun-fire on the 10th from their
gun-batteries. At seven oâclock, including the expenditure
on the eighth, they had discharged 5,227 shot and 2,302
shells, exclusive of the number fired by the men-of-war and
mortar-boats. The garrison, on the contrary, took no further
notice of them than to return a few rounds from the
terrace batteries at their working parties, who were repairing
the damage done on the 8th, and completing the rest of the
works. In the course of the day the
Brilliant
and
Porcupine

frigates were scuttled by the navy in the New Mole; and at
night the engineers, with a working party, cleared the lines
of rubbish, and restored those traverses which had been
demolished. At night the enemyâs fire was under the same
regulation as the preceding evening.

âThe next morning, when the garrison guards were being
relieved, a signal was made at the town, near the quarry,
under the Queen of Spainâs Chair, and the enemyâs cannonade
became excessively brisk: fortunately few casualties
occurred. Their firing, when this object ceased to engage
them, seemed to be principally directed against the obstructions
at Landport, and in that part of the garrison. Many
of the palisades in the covered way were destroyed, and the

chevaux-de-frise
considerably injured; artificers were, however,
constantly detached to repair those breaches, so that
the whole were kept in a better state than might be
expected. In the afternoon the garrison began to conclude
that the attack with the battering-ships was no longer to be
deferred. Several detachments of soldiers embarked from
the camp, and others were standing on the neighbouring
eminences, which, with the appearance in the evening of
signals like those which had been observed on the night of
the 7th, led the besieged to believe that every preparation
was complete; and the wind at that time blowing gently in
the bay, from the north-west, favoured the conjecture.
550

Landport and Waterport guards were immediately reinforced,
the furnaces and grates for heating shot were lighted,
and the artillery ordered to man the batteries.

âThus prepared, the garrison waited their approach, for it
seemed to be the general opinion that the battering-ships
would advance and be moored in the night, that they might
be less exposed to annoyance in this duty, and open together,
with greater effect, at daybreak. Attention was, however,
called off from the bay to the land side, where the enemy
had set fire to the barriers of Bay-side and Forbesâs, and the
whole of those palisades to the waterâs edge were instantly
involved in flames. The northern guards and pickets were
immediately under arms, and a smart discharge of musketry
was directed upon several parties, which, by the light of
the fire, were discovered in the meadows. The enemy increasing
their bombardment, and nothing new happening in
consequence of the conflagration, the pickets and guards were
remanded under cover, but the artillery continued upon the
batteries. The garrison had scarcely recovered from this alarm,
before the gun and mortar boats, with the bomb-ketches,
began to bombard the northern front, taking their station
off the Kingâs bastion, extending towards Fort St. Philip.
They commenced about an hour after midnight, and their
fire, added to that of the land-batteries, exceedingly annoyed
Waterport and the vicinity. The out-pickets were again
under arms, but providentially the British loss was trifling.
The garrison returned a few rounds from the sea-line, but
still disregarded the batteries on the isthmus, excepting
when their workmen appeared, or were thought to be employed.
Major Lewis, commandant of the artillery, was
unfortunately amongst the wounded; but, however meritorious
an officer, his second supplied his place admirably
during his confinement.

âWhen the gun-boats retired, nothing new occurred till
the morning of the 12th: the enemyâs fire continued to be
supported at the average of four thousand rounds in the
twenty-four hours. About eight oâclock reports were received
from Europa guard that a large fleet had appeared in the
Straits from the westward. The wind was brisk, and there
was scarcely time to form any opinion concerning them ere
they approached the bay, and proved to be the combined
551

fleets of France and Spain; consisting of seven three-deckers,
and thirty-one ships of two decks; with three frigates, and
a number of xebeques, bomb-ketches, and hospital-ships,
the whole under the command of ten admirals and a broad
pendant. In the afternoon they were at anchor in the bay,
between the Orange-grove and Algeziras.

âThis great accumulation of force could not fail to surprise,
if not alarm the garrison. It appeared as if the enemy
meant, previous to their final efforts, to strike, if possible,
a terror through their opponents, by displaying before them
a more powerful armament than had probably ever been
brought against any fortress. Forty-seven sail of the line,
including three inferior two-deckers, ten battering-ships,
deemed perfect in design and esteemed invincible, carrying
two hundred and twelve guns; innumerable frigates,
xebeques, bomb-ketches, cutters, gun and mortar boats, and
smaller craft for disembarking men: these were assembled
in the bay. On the land side were most stupendous and
strong batteries and works, mounting two hundred pieces
of heavy ordnance, and protected by an army of near
40,000 men, commanded by a victorious and active general,
of the highest reputation, and animated with the immediate
presence of two princes of the royal blood of France, with
other dignified personages, and many of their own nobility.
Such a naval and military spectacle is scarcely to be equalled
in the annals of war. From such a combination of power,
and favourable concurrent circumstances, it was natural
enough that the Spanish nation should anticipate the most
glorious consequences. Indeed, their confidence in the
effect to be produced by the battering-ships passed all
bounds; and, in the enthusiasm excited by the magnitude
of their preparations, it was thought highly criminal even
to whisper a doubt of success.

âIn drawing these flattering conclusions, the enemy, however,
seemed entirely to have overlooked the nature of that
force which was opposed to them; for though the garrison
scarcely consisted of 7,000 effective men, including the
marine brigade, they forgot that they were now veterans in
this service, had been a long time habituated to the effects
of artillery, and were prepared by degrees for the arduous
conflict that awaited them. They were, at the same time,
552

commanded by officers of approved courage, prudence, and
ability, eminent for all the accomplishments of their profession,
and in whom they had unbounded confidence.
Their spirits, too, were not a little elevated by the success
attending the recent practice of firing red-hot shell, which,
in this attack, they hoped would enable them to bring their
labours to a period, and relieve them from the tedious
cruelty of another vexatious blockade.

âIn the morning of the 12th the governor reinforced the
pickets of the line; nine of which, in future, were stationed
in town, and distributed as follows: two at Waterport, two
at Landport, two in the lines, and the remaining three in
the picket-yard, with the field officer of the town district.
The other picket of the line was continued at the southward.

âIn the evening, about dusk, a number of men were
observed to embark from the Orange-grove, on board the
battering-ships; which, with the presence of the combined
fleet, and the wind blowing favourably, induced the garrison
to conclude that the important and long-meditated attack
was not now to be deferred.

âThe enemyâs cannonade was continued, almost on the
same scale as the preceding days, during the night of the
12th. The next morning it was observed the combined
fleet had made some new arrangements in their position or
moorings, and that the remaining two battering-ships had
joined the others at the Orange-grove, where their whole
attacking force seemed to be now assembled. About a
quarter before seven oâclock some motions were observed
amongst their shipping; and soon after the battering-ships
got under way, with a gentle breeze from the north-west,
standing to the southward, to clear the men-of-war, and
were attended by a number of boats. As the English naval
officers were of opinion that the battering-ships would be
brought before the garrison in the night, few suspected that
their present manÅuvres were preparatory to their commencing
the attack; but, observing a crowd of spectators
on the beach, near Point Mala, and upon the neighbouring
eminences, and the ships edging down towards the garrison,
the governor thought it would be imprudent any longer to
doubt it. The town-batteries were accordingly manned, and
the grates and furnaces for heating shot ordered to be lighted.

553

âThus prepared for their reception, the garrison had leisure
to notice the enemyâs evolutions. The ten battering-ships,
after leaving the men-of-war, wore to the north, and a little
past nine oâclock bore down in admirable order for their
several stations; the admiral, in a two-decker, mooring
about 900 yards off the Kingâs bastion, the others successively
taking their places to the right and left of the flag-ship
in a masterly manner, the most distant being about
1,100 or 1,200 yards from the garrison. The British
artillery allowed the enemy every reasonable advantage, in
permitting them without molestation to choose their distance;
but as soon as the first ship dropped her anchors,
which was about a quarter before ten oâclock, that instant
the British fire commenced. The enemy were completely
moored in a little more than ten minutes, and their cannonade
then became, in a high degree, tremendous. The
showers of shot and shells which were now directed from
their land-batteries, the battering-ships, and, on the other
hand, from the various works of the garrison, exhibited a
scene of which perhaps neither the pen nor the pencil can
furnish a competent idea. It is sufficient to say that

upwards of four hundred
pieces of the heaviest artillery
were playing at the same moment: an instance which has
scarcely occurred in any siege since the invention of those
wonderful engines of destruction.

âAfter some hoursâ cannonade, the battering-ships were
found to be no less formidable than they had been represented.
The heaviest shells often rebounded from their
tops, whilst the thirty-two-pound shot seemed incapable of
making any visible impression upon their hulls. The garrison
frequently flattered themselves they were on fire; but no
sooner did the smoke appear, than, with the most persevering
intrepidity, men were observed applying water from
their engines within to those places whence the smoke
issued. These circumstances, with the prodigious cannonade
which they maintained, gave the garrison reason to imagine
that the attack would not be so soon decided as from the
recent success against their land-batteries had been fondly
expected. Even the artillery themselves, at this period, had
their doubts of the effect of the red-hot shot, which began to
be used about twelve, but were not general till between one
554

and two oâclock. To show the spirit in which the defence
was carried on, the men jocularly called the supplies of red-hot
shot, obtained by making fires of wood in the corners of
old buildings, âbatches of roasted potatoes for the dons and
monsieurs.ââ

âThe enemyâs cannon at the commencement were too much
elevated; but about noon their firing was powerful and well-directed.
The garrison casualties then became numerous,
particularly on those batteries north of the Kingâs bastion,
which were warmly assailed by the enemyâs flanking and
reverse fire from the land. Though so vexatiously annoyed
from the isthmus, the garrison artillery totally disregarded
their opponents in that quarter, directing their sole attention
to the battering-ships, the furious and spirited opposition
of which served to excite their people to more animated
exertions. A fire more tremendous, if possible, than ever,
was therefore poured down from the rock; incessant showers
of hot balls, carcases, and shells of every description, flew
from all quarters; and, as the masts of several of the ships
were shot away and the rigging of all was in great confusion,
hopes of a favourable and speedy decision began to
revive in the garrison.

âAbout noon, their mortar-boats and bomb-ketches attempted
to second the attack from the battering-ships, but
the wind having changed to the south-west and blowing a
smart breeze with a heavy swell, they were prevented taking
a part in the action. The same reason also hindered the
British gun-boats from flanking the battering-ships from the
southward.

âFor some hours the attack and defence were so equally
well supported, as scarcely to admit any appearance of
superiority in the cannonade on either side. The wonderful
construction of the ships seemed to bid defiance to the
powers of the heaviest ordnance. In the afternoon, however,
the face of things began to change considerably: the
smoke which had been observed to issue from the upper part
of the flag-ship appeared to prevail, notwithstanding the
constant application of water, and the admiralâs second was
perceived to be in the same condition. Confusion was now
apparent on board several of the vessels, and by the evening
their cannonade was considerably abated: about seven or
555

eight oâclock it almost totally ceased, excepting from one or
two ships to the northward, which from their distance had
suffered little injury.

âWhen their firing began to slacken, various signals were
made from the southernmost ships, and as the evening advanced,
many rockets were thrown up, to inform their
friends, as afterwards learned, of their extreme danger and
distress. These signals were immediately answered, and
several boats were seen to row round the disabled ships.
The garrison artillery at this period caused dreadful havoc
amongst them. An indistinct clamour with lamentable cries
and groans proceeded, during the short intervals of cessation,
from all quarters; and a little before midnight, a wreck
floated in under the townline-wall, upon which were twelve
men, who only, out of threescore which were on board their
launch, had escaped. These circumstances convinced the
garrison that they had gained an advantage over the enemy;
yet they did not conceive that the victory was so complete
as the succeeding morning evinced. The British firing
therefore was continued, though with less vivacity; but as
the artillery from such a hard-fought day, exposed to the
intense heat of a warm sun, in addition to the harassing
duties of the preceding night, were much fatigued, and as it
was impossible to foresee what new objects might demand
their service the following day, the governor, about six in
the evening, when the enemyâs fire abated, permitted the
majority of the officers and men to be relieved by a picket of
a hundred men from the marine brigade, under the command
of Lieutenant Trentham; and officers and non-commissioned
officers of the artillery were stationed in the different batteries,
to direct the sailors in the mode of firing the hot
shot.

âAbout an hour after midnight, the battering-ship which
had suffered the greatest injury, and which had been frequently
on fire the preceding day, was completely in flames,
and by two oâclock in the morning of the 14th, she appeared
as one continued blaze from stem to stern. The ship to the
southward of her was also on fire, but did not burn with so
much rapidity. The light thrown out on all sides by the
flames enabled the artillery to point the guns with the
utmost precision, whilst the rock and neighbouring objects
556

were highly illuminated, forming with the constant flashes of
the cannon, a mingled scene of sublimity and terror. Between
three and four oâclock, six other of the battering-ships
indicated the efficacy of the red-hot shot; and the approaching
day now promised the British garrison one of the completest
defensive victories on record.

âBrigadier Curtis, who was encamped with his brigade at
Europa, being informed that the enemyâs ships were in
flames, and that the calmness of the sea would permit his
gun-boats to act, marched about three oâclock
A.M.
with a detachment
to the New Mole; and, drawing up his twelve boats
in such a manner as to flank the battering-ships, compelled
their boats to abandon them. As the day approached and
the garrison fire abated, the brigadier advanced and captured
two launches filled with men. These boats attempted to
escape, but a shot killing and wounding several men on
board one of them, both surrendered, and were conducted to
Ragged Staff. The brigadier being informed by the prisoners
that many men were through necessity left by their friends
on board the ships, he generously determined to rescue
them. Some of these infatuated wretches nevertheless, it is
said, refused at first the deliverance offered to them, preferring
the death before them to being put to the sword, as
they were taught to believe they should be if they submitted
to the British. Being left, however, some moments to the
horrors of their fate, they beckoned the boats to return, and
resigned themselves to the clemency of their conquerors.

âWhilst the navy were thus humanely relieving their distressed
enemy, the flames reached the magazine of one of the
battering-ships to the northward, and it blew up about five
oâclock, with a dreadful explosion. In a quarter of an hour
after, another in the centre of the line met with a similar
fate. The wreck from the latter spread to a vast extent,
and involved the British gun-boats in the most imminent
danger; one was sunk, but the crew were saved. A hole
was forced through the bottom of the brigadierâs boat, his
coxswain was killed, and the strokesman wounded, and for
some time the crew were obscured in the cloud of smoke.
After this very fortunate escape, it was deemed prudent to
withdraw towards the garrison, to avoid the peril arising
from the blowing up of the remaining ships. The brigadier,
557

however, visited two other ships on his return, and landed
nine officers, two priests, and three hundred and thirty-four
soldiers and seamen, all Spaniards, which, with one officer
and eleven Frenchmen, who had floated in the preceding
evening, made the total number saved amount to three hundred
and fifty-seven. Many of the prisoners were severely,
and some of them dreadfully wounded. On being brought
ashore, they were instantly conveyed to the garrison hospital,
and every remedy was administered necessary for their
different cases.â This is one of the brightest pages in the
history of British warfare; so striking indeed, that even the
enemies were eager to announce to the world what they
owed to the humanity of the garrison; both French and
Spanish writers are at least as warm in praise of Sir Roger
Curtisâs noble exertions on this occasion, as the English
historian of the siege.

âDuring the time that the marine brigade were encountering
every danger in their endeavours to save an enemy from
perishing, the batteries on the isthmus, which had ceased
the preceding evening, most likely from want of ammunition,
and which had opened again upon the garrison on the morning
of the 14th, maintained a warm fire upon the town,
which killed and wounded several men, and three or four
shells burst in the air over the very spot where their countrymen
were landed. This ungenerous proceeding could not
escape the observation of the spectators in their camp, and
orders were probably sent to the lines for the batteries to
cease, as they were silent about ten oâclock.

âNotwithstanding the efforts of the marine brigade in
relieving the terrified victims from the burning ships, many
unfortunate men could not be saved. The scene at this time
exhibited was as affecting as that which had been presented
in the act of hostility had been terrible and tremendous.
Men crying from amidst the flames for pity and assistance;
others on board those ships where the fire had made little
progress, imploring relief with the most expressive gestures
and signs of despair; whilst several, equally exposed to the
dangers of the opposite element, trusted themselves on
various parts of the wreck to the chance of paddling themselves
to the shore. A filucca belonging to the enemy
approached from the Orange-grove, probably with the intention
558

of relieving these unfortunate persons; but, jealous of
her motives, the garrison suspected that she came to set fire
to one of the battering-ships, which appeared but little
injured, and obliged her to retire. Of the six ships which
were still in flames, three blew up before eleven oâclock; the
other three burned to the waterâs edge, the magazines being
wetted by the enemy before the principal officers quitted the
ships. The admiralâs flag was on board one of the latter,
and was consumed with the vessel. The remaining two battering-ships,
it was hoped, might be saved as glorious trophies;
but one of them unexpectedly burst out into flames,
and in a short time blew up with a terrible report; and
Captain Gibson representing it as impracticable to preserve
the other, it was burnt in the afternoon under his direction.
Thus the navy put a finishing hand to this signal defensive
victory.

âDuring the hottest period of the cannonade the governor
was present on the Kingâs bastion, whilst Lieutenant-General
Boyd took his station upon the South bastion, animating
the garrison by their presence.

âWhilst the enemy were cool and their ships had received
little damage, their principal objects were the Kingâs bastion,
and the line-wall north of Orangeâs bastion. Their largest
ships, which were about 1,400 tons burden, were stationed
off the former, in order to silence that important battery,
whilst a breach was attempted by the rest in a curtain
extending from the latter to Montagueâs bastion. The
prisoners informed the garrison, that if a breach had been
effected, their grenadiers were to have stormed the garrison
under cover of the combined fleets. The private men complained
bitterly of their officers for describing the battering-ships
as invulnerable, and for promising that they were to
be seconded by ten sail of the line, and all the gun and
mortar boats. They further said that they had been taught
to believe that the garrison would not be able to discharge
many rounds of hot balls; their astonishment, therefore,
was inconceivable when they discovered that they fired them
with the same precision and vivacity as cold shot. The
enemyâs loss, including the prisoners, could not be less than
two thousand men. The casualties of the garrison, on the
contrary, were so trifling, that it will appear almost incredible
559

that such a quantity of fire, in almost all its destructive
modes of action, should not have produced more effect.
They amounted to one officer, two subalterns, and thirteen
privates killed, and to five officers and sixty-three privates
wounded!

âAn annoying and vindictive firing was kept up occasionally
by the besiegers, and warmly responded to by the
garrison, but from the 15th of September the siege was
little more than a badly-kept blockade. On the 2nd of
February the governor received a note from the duke de
Crillon, informing him that preliminaries of a general peace
had been signed in January. He had likewise the supreme
satisfaction to learn that the garrison of Gibraltar, for which
he and his gallant garrison had fought so bravely and persistently,
was to remain in the hands of Great Britain.

âGeneral Elliott was made a knight of the Bath, the Parliament
settled a handsome pension on him for life, and
on his return home in 1787, he was raised to the British
peerage by the title of Baron Heathfield, of Gibraltar. The
gallant and humane Brigadier Curtis received the most appropriate
honour of knighthood, as a reward for his truly chivalric
conduct. General Boyd was created a knight of the Bath,
and General Green distinguished by a baronetcy. The
thanks of both houses of Parliament were voted to the
generals, officers, and privates who had served on this glorious
occasion.â

In our account of this most remarkable siege of modern
times, we have unhesitatingly made free with Captain Drinkwaterâs
admirable narrative. Whilst compiling this work,
the reading of that book has been the most pleasing part of
our labours, and on closing it we exclaimed, âThis is almost
as fully entitled to a place in every military studentâs
library, as Dibdinâs Songs in that of every sailor.â

SERINGAPATAM.

A.D. 1799.

It
is not our business here to discuss the means by which
the English empire in India has been obtained, nor have we
560

even space to detail the circumstances which led to the
subjugation of Mysore, under Tippoo Saib, the last of its
kings: our affair is with sieges only.

Two English armies directed their course towards Seringapatam,
the capital of the kingdom of Mysore. General
Harris crossed the Cauvery on the 31st of March, and established
himself at two miles from the south-west of that
city; he there waited for General Stuart, who joined him
seven days after with a body of troops detached from the
army of Madras. Confident in the strength of the works
which surround the island in which Seringapatam is situated,
Tippoo Saib made no effort to oppose this junction.
The works were furnished with four hundred pieces of
cannon, and constructed with the greatest care. For some
time he satisfied himself with defending his outworks. The
resistance of the sultan, on this point, was as short as it
was useless. General Stuart made the Indian troops fall
back to within eight hundred toises of the western angle of
the place, and carried an intrenchment which separated him
from General Harris, so that Seringapatam was completely
invested, and the first parallel was immediately opened.
Battery in breach was commenced on the 1st of May; by
the 4th it was deemed practicable. Four regiments were
selected to mount to the breach. General Harris, the more
to surprise the sultan, deferred giving the signal till the
moment of the greatest heat, in the middle of the day. The
English troops and the sepoy grenadiers marched out of the
trenches, crossed the pebbly bed of the Cauvery under a
murderous fire, and mounted to the breaches effected in the

fausse-braie
and the rampart. The combat was bloody and
obstinate. Tippoo Saib, taken by surprise, and rendered
desperate by the fear of loss of empire and life, faced death
wherever the greatest peril threatened: he perished in the

mÃªlÃ©e
, together with his principal officers. All the fortifications
were carried, but the children of the sultan still
defended themselves in the palace, which contained his
family, his wives, and his treasures. General Harris promised
safety and protection to the inhabitants of the palace,
and they surrendered immediately. The body of Tippoo
was sought for, and found beneath a heap of slain, near one
of the gates; he was recognised by his family, and deposited
561

in the tomb of his father, Hyder Ali. The treasures of his
palace were distributed among the victorious army. After
the taking of Seringapatam, Tippooâs children, his relations,
and the princes engaged in alliance with him, submitted.
This brilliant operation rendered the English absolute
masters of the peninsula of India.

SARAGOSSA.

A.D. 1809.

Although
, like the most trivial accident of life, every
small siege which occurred in the memorable Peninsular
war had, doubtless, its bearing upon the general result, we
can afford room only for the most prominent. The siege of
every place remains, to all time, an interesting epoch in its
own annals, but the student of history only pauses at such
conflicts of the kind as have been distinguished by the
presence of great captains, have been brought about by
remarkable circumstances or revolutions, or have led to consequences
important to nations or to mankind in general.
We have another cause, likewise, for not dwelling upon the
Spanish sieges; they have been laid before the public so
admirably, that to go into their details after Sir William
Napier, would not only be a work of supererogation, but
would lead to a comparison in which we could but suffer.

After glancing over the vast number of sieges that have
been the subjects of our attention, we cannot but consider
that of Saragossa to be one of the most anomalous. A
strongly-fortified city, admirably placed, was filled to overflowing
with a population enthusiastic in the cause, and
with thirty thousand cannoniers, and a body of peasants,
sappers, miners, and navigators from the canal-works, contained
a mass of fifty thousand combatants. In addition to
this, many, if not most of the houses were fire-proof; and
there were innumerable large buildings, such as convents
and churches, that were all capable of being fortified, and
supplying defences in detail against an enemy who might
penetrate into the interior. They had abundance of provisions,
562

and all the munitions of war,âeven its sinews,
money,âthat could be required in a long protracted siege.
But above all this was the
cause
; every man might be said
to be a volunteer, fighting for all he held dearest in life.
âDoors and windows were built up, house-fronts loop-holed,
internal communication opened, streets trenched and crossed
by earthen ramparts mounted with cannon, and every strong
building was a fortification: there was no weak point, there
could be none, in a city which was all fortress, where the
space covered by houses was the measure of the ramparts.â
So, and admirably, says Sir William Napier; but in one so
well read in the history of sieges as he must be, this is
saying a great deal. For our part, we think there is no
fortification in which genius equal to that of the constructor,
backed by courage, vigilance, and enterprise, cannot find a
weak point. Look back at the impregnable Valenciennes,
taken by a
coup-de-main
in a few hours, from the discovery
of an imprudently-constructed door.

But what marks the siege of Saragossa so distinctly from
all others, is the small number of the besieging army. To
invest a large city, so garrisoned and provided, the French
had but thirty-five thousand men, and were only able to
complete their investment in a thin indefensible manner.
In addition to the siege, they were compelled to be perpetually
on the watch, as the whole country around was
against them, and Palafoxâs brother, Lazan, hovered about
with a body of troops, to throw in when occasion offered.

In reading the details of the siege, we meet with little or
no defection, because defection was punished with the
utmost severity; the garrison having only the âchoice of
the enemy in front of their dwellings, and the gibbet behind
them.â The public enthusiasm was kept up by processions,
sham miracles, false manifestoes, indeed everything that
could work upon a superstitious, excited people; and yet
from the beginning the progress of the French was steady,
and almost unbroken. They had certainly vicissitudes; in
such a conflict how could it be otherwise? They even
became dispirited for a moment, by fatigue and the prospect
of the obstacles before them; but we do not think that
Lasnes had ever a doubt of ultimately obeying Napoleonâs
commands, by taking the city. It certainly was a great
563

triumph of seasoned disciplined soldiery, conducted by
courage and skill in their commanders, over a much superior
force, surrounded by all the defences art and nature could
furnish. As soldiers, we think the taking of Saragossa
highly to the honour of the French.

Napoleon was very desirous of the capture of Saragossa,
which is looked upon as the bulwark of the eastern provinces
of Spain; and his preparations for effecting it were
those of a general and a politician. But Lasnes, to whom
he had assigned the command, fell sick; Moncey and Ney
committed strategic errors, and his purpose was at least
delayed. This gave the Spanish leaders time to prepare
likewise, and they did not neglect it. In the sieges of
cities, when people are earnest in their defence, they do not
confine themselves to the operations of art, or even the
weapons of war; they think everything a legitimate instrument
that can protect themselves or annoy the enemy:
thus we see in one the citizens hurling their beehives, with
their swarms of stinging insects, upon their invaders; and in
another, one of the greatest, but at the same time the most
senseless of the worldâs disturbers, killed by a tile thrown
by an old woman. So with the inhabitants of Saragossa:
while paying due attention to their military works, they
took advantage of everything that could be converted to the
one great purpose in hand.

The only unpardonable error was that of Palafox; although
zealous in all ways at the commencement of the contest,
when the French had made serious way into the heart of
the city, he seems to have abandoned his post, and to have
passed his time in intemperance and debauchery.

Like men made wise by practice in their cruel trade, the
French generals did not move till they were quite prepared
with not only magazines but hospitals; they knew such a
game could not be played without losses and accidents; and
there is no greater encouragement to the soldier marching
into battle than an undoubting conviction that if wounded
he shall be taken care of;âthe sight of the hospital is as
cheering to him as that of the provision-store.

On the 20th of December they advanced, and on the 21st
attacked Monte Terrore, deluding the besieged by the show
of one column, while another crossed the canal, under the
564

aqueduct, and passing beneath the city and the fort, entered
the latter in the rear. With a third column they attacked
the grand sluice. The Spaniards were forced to retreat;
which so exasperated the populace and their leaders, that
the captain, who had been thus the first to retreat, was
with difficulty saved from the effects of their indignation.

While this assault was being made, General Gazan made
a simultaneous attempt upon the suburb, in which he put
from three to four hundred men
hors de combat
. He, however,
did not do all he might have done, which cheered the
Spaniards.

By the 24th the city was invested, and every French
general was at his post; Lacoste directing the operations,
as chief engineer. He instituted one false and two real
attacks; and on the 29th the trenches were opened.
According to custom, the place was summoned, and the
terms previously offered by Napoleon were repeated; it
being added that Madrid had surrendered. To this Palafox
haughtily replied, âIf Madrid has surrendered, Madrid has
been sold. Saragossa will neither be sold nor surrender.â
This was accepting the challenge, and the French ordered
three attacks to be made.

On the 31st the besieged made a sally, which would have
been a complete failure but for a small advantage gained by
a body of their cavalry. Palafox, perhaps justifiably, magnified
this into a victory in his manifesto: he had not only
to lead his compatriots, but to keep up their enthusiasm:
his great opponent, Buonaparte, was a past master in this
part of his craft.

On the 1st of January the besieged made a serious
assault upon Gazan, whom they seemed to consider weak,
and, to mask their design, sent out skirmishing parties: the
great affair was a failure, while the skirmishers gathered a
few laurels.

A change took place in the French generals; Moncey
went to Madrid, and Junot succeeded him. The very thin
investment was completed by a line of circumvallation, to
supply the want of numbers.

The Spaniards had looked for the destruction of their
enemies to the diseases usually produced by the wet period;
but it this year proved a very dry season, and the French
565

were enabled to proceed with their works in comparative
secrecy, by the prevalence of dense morning fogs. On the
10th the city was bombarded with so much effect that the
Spaniards withdrew their guns from the convent of San
Joseph. The latter attempted a sally at midnight, but,
though bravely executed, it proved unsuccessful: they lost
one hundred men out of two hundred engaged.

The batteries having made a practicable breach, the
French resolved upon an attack on the 11th. After much
hard fighting, the convent of San Joseph was stormed, and
some of the
Ã©lite
, as in the door at Valenciennes, finding a
bridge, entered by the rear, while their comrades were
storming the front. The French lost but few men, and
made a considerable advance.

The operations on the 15th were still in favour of the
French; the Spaniards cut the bridge of Santa Engracia,
and sprung a mine, but it proved harmless. The progress
of the French was steady and scientific, and the inhabitants
were confined to the city.

In this aspect of affairs the Spanish leaders published a
flaming account of the emperor being defeated; and,
amidst music and shouts, named the marshals who had
fallen in the battle. They likewise asserted that Palafoxâs
brother was devastating France: âbut,â says Sir
William Napier, âhowever improbable, this all met with
credence; the invention of the leaders being scarcely able
to keep pace with the credulity of their followers.â The
French were not without their difficulties; all the country
was in a state of insurrection against the king they wished
to impose upon the Spanish nation, and they began to be
sensible of the want of provisions. The generals were
also said not to accord in their views; discipline was
relaxed, and the soldiers were reported to feel their zeal
diminished. But we can scarcely imagine that there were
any serious obstacles, when we look to the result.

Another strange circumstance is, that while the Spaniards
obtained supplies of troops, the French could not bring up
a division without its being harassed by the insurgents.
Lazan, Palafoxâs brother, was very active in his annoyances.

Lasnes, now recovered from his illness, resumed the
command, and soon made it appear that the French had a
566

captain at their head. In an attempt to silence a battery,
Mariano Galendo gained much honour but no advantage,
for he missed his object, lost his men, and was himself taken
prisoner.

The operations continued to be all gradually in favour of
the French; the walls began to fall, and the breaches were
many and wide. On the 29th, a formidable body marched
from the trenches to the walls; and though driven back by
a heavy fire from the inner intrenchments, they kept their
lodgment and connected it with the trenches.

A division of Poles in the French army now made a most
successful assault, which stimulated the men in the trenches
to make a wild effort to get into the city; but they were
stopped by grape and a severe fire from the houses. The
French lost six hundred men; but they never seemed to
move without advance.

Thus the walls of Saragossa were brought to the ground;
âbut,â as Sir William Napier eloquently says, âSaragossa
remained erect, and as the broken girdle fell from the
heroic city, the besiegers started at the aspect of her naked
strength.â The defences of art had failed and were gone,
but the people and the spirit that animated them were still
in full vitality. As if to denote that science was not the
principle to be now relied on, the chief engineers on both
sides were simultaneously slain.

When we revert to the manner in which the town was
internally fortified, we may suppose the nature of the
warfare carried on, when besieged and besiegers were
mingled in the desperate conflicts of house and street
fighting: all the confusion and all the horrors that the
most powerful imagination can conceive, were to be found
in this doomed city; and, as yet, neither side blenched; the
Spaniards fought as desperately for their hearths and their
homes, as the French contended bravely for victory and
honour.

The people seemed animated by the very frenzy of
despair; and Lasnes, convinced that his comparatively
small army could not expect success against such numbers,
and so excited, resolved to depend upon the slow but
certain process of the mine.

Each day now is nothing but a repetition of fighting for
567

every house, and sweeping the great thoroughfares with
artillery. We endeavour to follow the contests, and account
for the results, but we cannot; all seem struggling, and
that bravely: the French are little more than half the
number of the Spaniards; the latter are in their own place,
of which they know every nook and corner; they are
seconded by their women, and are stimulated by everything
that can act upon the generous part of the nature of
man;âand yet, at every nightfall, the French have made
progress.

The French found that by the usual allowance of powder
for their mines they destroyed the buildings, and left no
walls to shelter their own soldiers; they therefore lessened
the quantity. Their adversaries perceiving this, saturated
the timbers of their buildings with resin and pitch, and
setting fire to those that could not be maintained, raised a
burning barrier to their progress.

And now came on the horrors of devastation; the city
was crumbling before the French fire and above their
mines in all parts; the noises of artillery, crashing houses,
shouts, shrieks, and groans of anguish, were mingled in
awful sublimity. The Cosso, or great public walk, was the
principal object of attack and defence for several days; by
immense mines and constant firing, the French at length
succeeded in obtaining this; and they then continued their
underground ramifications in the most surprising manner.
It was at this point of the siege the spirit of the French
began to flag: fifty daysâ incessant labour and fighting had
exhausted, for a moment, their boiling courage; they were
dying ingloriously, like rats, in subterraneous trenches.
This is not the scene for the French soldier:âhe likes broad
day, the eyes of man upon him, and an obstacle that can be
overcome by one brave effort. They began to reflect upon
the disparity of numbers, and to ask each other who ever
heard of thirty-five thousand men besieging fifty thousand?

But Lasnes knew the stimulant that was wanted. A
harvest of glory in promise was sufficient; and whilst
excited by the prospect, he led them on the 18th of
February to a grand assault.

During this assault, mines containing three thousand
pounds of powder were sprung, and amidst the crash of
568

falling buildings, fifty guns thundered upon the suburb and
the bridge over the Ebro, and made a large practicable
breach in the convent of St. Lazar. This was taken, the
passage of the bridge was intercepted, and awful havoc was
made among the troops. Gazan forced two thousand men
to surrender, and took possession of the Spanish works.

This being followed by another attack and by the devastating
explosion of sixteen hundred pounds of powder, the
besieged began to tremble. Palafox sent an aide-de-camp
to demand, in addition to certain terms before offered by the
French commander, that the garrison should be allowed to
join the Spanish armies, with a fixed number of covered carriages.
As might have been expected, Lasnes rejected these
proposals, and the firing continued; but the hour of surrender
was come. A little more sharp firing and the explosion
of another mine or two, together with the dread of others,
completed the consternation.

But to increase the horrors of the situation of the people,
pestilence of a fearful kind arose from the manner in which
the women, children, and aged inhabitants were crowded
into cellars lighted by oil. The closeness of the atmosphere,
with bad and unusual diet, produced diseases that assailed
both the strong and the weak; the daily deaths were from
four to five hundred. Sixteen thousand shells were thrown
during the siege, and forty-five thousand pounds of powder
had been exploded in the mines; forty thousand persons had
perished!

Palafox was sick, and most of the other leaders were
either dead or disabled. According to French writers, the
place surrendered at discretion; but the Spanish authors
assert that Lasnes granted the following terms, the name of
Ferdinand VII. being omitted from the instrument:ââThe
garrison to march out with the honours of war, to be considered
prisoners, and sent to France; the officers to retain
their swords, baggage, and horses, the men their knapsacks.
Persons of either class willing to serve under Joseph, to be
immediately enrolled in the ranks; the peasants to be sent
to their homes; property and religion to be guaranteed.â

There was much dissension in the city about these terms;
but the Junta took prompt measures to give up the walls
near the castle, and, in the words of Sir William Napier,
569

âon the 21st of February, from twelve to fifteen thousand
sickly beings, having laid down their arms, which they could
now scarcely handle, this cruel and memorable siege terminated.â

In this siege we have had recourse principally to Sir
William Napier; indeed, to what other source could we
look with so much confidence? We only regret that we
did not feel at liberty to copy his account literally. His is
the graphic description of a man who not only conscientiously
relates the history of the events, but proves that he
professionally understands all he speaks of. He is like
Xenophon describing the immortal retreat of the ten thousand.
There is only one thing in which we cannot agree
with him. Being a soldier, he perhaps has a leaning to all
who have distinguished themselves in his profession, and on
that account, gives frequent and strong praise to Buonaparte.
Now we cannot join him to anything like the extent
of his admiration for that extraordinary adventurer. When
the wings of victory fanned his standard, he was glorious and
triumphant; but in reverses, he showed himself deficient in
what has been the pride of the greatest generals. CondÃ©âs
retreat from Arras was one of the proudest feats of his
military career. As a piece of generalship, Moreauâs
famous retreat is equal to any one of Buonaparteâs victories.

BADAJOS.

A.D. 1811.

The
Peninsular sieges in which the English were concerned
are principally useful as lessons to statesmen, and
consequently to the people who support these statesmen.
The siege of Badajos failed, although a Wellington superintended
it; but, as Sir William Napier justly says, âit was
not strange that it did fail; for the British government sent
an engineer corps into the field so ill-provided, that all the
officersâ bravery and zeal could not render it efficient. The
very tools used, especially those from the storekeeper-generalâs
department, were unfit for work; the captured French
cutting instruments were eagerly sought for in preference;
570

and when the soldiersâ lives and the honour of Englandâs
arms were at stake, English cutlery would not bear comparison
with French.â This account has been published
many years; all whose business it was to read it and profit
by the lesson have had ample time; and yet, in what respect
does it differ from the same culpable errorâwe were going
to say, but must substitute criminal jobberyâwith regard to
the war munitions of the Crimea?

Though ardently wishing for the capture of Badajos,
Wellington knew he had not that great necessary in all
sieges, time, to effect it regularly. If he laid siege to it in
form, the French would be able to bring assistance that would
render his endeavours nugatory; he could not command
more than twenty days; with bad guns, deficient stores, and
no regular corps of sappers and miners; as General Picton
wittily and keenly observed, âLord Wellington sued Badajos

in formÃ¢ pauperis
.â Reckoning all the deficiencies,
regular approaches could not be ventured upon, and attacks
upon the castle and Fort Cristoval were adopted instead;
and these were to take place at the same time. A battering-train
was very quickly got ready, consisting of thirty twenty-four-pounders,
four sixteen-pounders, and twelve eight and
ten-inch howitzers converted into mortars by being placed
on trucks; these, with six iron Portuguese guns, made fifty-two
pieces; and of British and Portuguese gunners there
were collected six hundred. But even these were inefficient;
for many of the guns were nearly useless from age; the
gunners were inexperienced, and there was no time to teach
them their craft.

On the 24th of May, Hastonâs division, consisting of five
thousand men, invested San Cristoval.

Phillipon, who, under the direction of Soult, governed in the
town, took every precaution necessary; and the townsmen
joined their efforts to those of the garrison to forward the
works of defence.

Ground being broken for a false attack upon Pardileras
on the 29th, the next night a parallel of eleven hundred
yards was sunk against the castle, without the workmen
being observed by the enemy; the same night another parallel,
of four hundred and fifty yards from San Cristoval, and
seven hundred from the bridge-head, was opened; one
571

breaching and two counter mines were raised on this line, to
prevent sallies by the bridge from the fort.

The attack against the castle proceeded favourably, but
the soil and the situation rendered that of Cristoval slow
and attended with loss: it was not finished before the night
of the 1st of June. It was much impeded by some well-directed
mortars from the garrison, which, strange to say,
were stopped by Phillipon, from the mistaken idea that he
was throwing their fire away.

On the night of the 2nd, however, the battery against San
Cristoval began, and after the guns and men had got into
practice, much mischief was done to the castle. On
the 4th, the garrison added the fire of several guns to their
artillery, and some of the besiegersâ were silenced.

The contest was kept up with tolerable spirit till two
breaches were made in San Cristoval; and one of them
appearing practicable, an assault was ordered, assisted by
a diversion in another quarter.

The stormers reached the glacis and descended the ditch
without being discovered; but they found the obstacles
insurmountable, and the forlorn hope was about to retire
before committing themselves to serious injury, when the
main body, annoyed by a flank fire from the town, followed
them into the ditch with their ladders. But the ladders
proved too short, and the defence from within was so firm,
that immediate retreat was necessary, and that attended with
considerable loss.

The errors in this attack are subjects of military discussion;
but we have not space to enter into them. The
French acted with great skill and activity in clearing away
ruins, presenting every obstacle that could be thought of,
natural as well as scientific, and by the judicious disposition
of well-armed men. Succours being at hand, a second attack
was thought advisable, if any hopes could be entertained of
the capture of the place. This time, things were better
managed; but on the other side, Phillipon made adequate
preparations to meet them.

But this attack proved no more fortunate than the former.
It was led with infinite spirit by Major MâGeechy, who
fell early. The French seem to have laughed at the affair,
as they jeeringly called to the men in the ditch to come on.
572

But barrels of powder rolled down among them, with the
addition of shells and musketry, proved worse than their
jeers. All went wrong: the troops quarrelled for the ladders,
though not many of them could be reared; confusion
ensued; and the enemy naturally took advantage of it: those
who ascended the ladders were met with the bayonet; the
ladders themselves were overturned; and a murderous fire
was poured upon the unfortunate mass in the ditch. Soultâs
approach rendered further attempts impossible; and the
siege was converted into a blockade.

Sir William Napierâs remarks are very severe upon this
siege. In addition to what we have before quoted, he says:
âThis siege, in which four hundred men and officers fell,
violated all rules. The working parties were too weak, the
guns and stores too few, the points of attack ill-chosen; the
defences were untouched by counter-fire, and the breaching-batteries
were too distant for the bad guns; howitzers on
trucks were poor substitutes for mortars, and the sap was
not practised. Lastly, the assaults were made before the
glacis had been crowned and a musketry-fire established
against the breach.â

SECOND ENGLISH SIEGE, A.D. 1812.

Lord Wellington having collected his troops in the Alentejo,
marched against Badajos, and commenced the siege on
the 16th of March, 1812.

On the 29th, previous to the opening of the breaching-batteries,
the enemy made a sortie upon the Portuguese
troops under General Hamilton, who invested the place on
the right of the Guadiana; but they were immediately
repulsed with some loss.

On the 31st, the English began to fire upon the face of
the bastion to the south-west of the angle of the fort of
Trinidad, and upon the flank of the bastion Santa Maria,
with twenty-six pieces of artillery formed in two batteries in
the second parallel. The fire of the batteries was constant
and tremendous from the 31st to the evening of April 3rd,
not less than sixty-four shots per minute being thrown. On
the 4th of April, a battery of six pieces was opened upon
the ravelin of St. Roque.

573

On the evening of the 5th, the breaches were declared
practicable; but as the enemy appeared to be making most
formidable preparations to repel any assault, Lord Wellington
determined to wait till the third breach was also practicable.
This being deemed to be so by the evening of the
6th, it was resolved to storm the place without an hourâs
delay.

The arrangements made for this purpose were as follows:
The third division under General Picton was directed to
attack the castle by escalade, while the guards in the
trenches, which were furnished from the fourth division,
should attack the ravelin of St. Roque, on the left of the
castle. The fourth division, under Major-General Colville,
and the light division, under Colonel Bernard, were ordered
to attack the breaches in the bastions of Trinidad and Santa
Maria. Major-General Walker, with his brigade, was to
make a false attack upon the fort of Pardileras and other
works on the banks of the Guadiana; and General Power,
with the Portuguese troops under his command, had orders
to attack the
tÃªte-du-pont
and fort of San Cristoval on the
right of that river.

The attack commenced exactly at ten oâclock at night.
The breaches were attacked in the most gallant manner by
the fourth and light divisions, who got almost to the covered
way before they were perceived by the enemy. But General
Phillipon had brought the bravest of his troops to that
point, and every obstacle that the shortness of the time
would admit of was opposed to their advance; and notwithstanding
the most determined and almost desperate efforts
which were made by the British to overcome these obstacles,
they were three times repulsed, and were unable to effect
an entry by the breaches. Many a gallant man fell a victim
to his bravery, and success had almost become hopeless,
when the commander was informed that General Picton was
in possession of the castle.

This cheering information soon spread through the ranks,
and the allied troops returned to the charge with an impetuosity
that nothing could oppose, and in ten minutes more
they were in possession of the place. General Walker succeeded
in his attack upon the Pardileras, which was taken
possession of by the 15th Portuguese infantry, under Colonel
574

de Regoa, and the 8th CaÃ§adores, under Major Hill. General
Walker also forced the barrier on the OlevenÃ§a road, and
entering the covered way on the left of the bastion of
St. Vincent, he descended into the ditch, and scaled the
face of the bastion. Phillipon fled with a few troops to the
fort of San Cristoval, but at the break of the following day
he surrendered the fort and garrison.

We have here set down the prominent facts of this siege
with the brevity our space commands; but if we had the
opportunity for going into the details enjoyed by the elegant
historian of the Peninsular war, what a world of stirring
instances of devotion, bravery, and suffering we should have
to relate!

Although we are bound to hold the work of a contemporary
sacred, we cannot resist offering a picture of the
horrors of war, given by one evidently, on other occasions,
fond and proud of his profession. At the close of this siege,
Sir William Napier
says:â

âNow commenced that wild and desperate wickedness
which tarnishes the lustre of the soldierâs heroism. All
indeed were not alike; hundreds risked and many lost their
lives in striving to stop the violence; but madness generally
prevailed, and as the worst men were leaders, here all the
dreadful passions of human nature were displayed. Shameless
rapacity, brutal intemperance, savage lust, cruelty and
murder, shrieks and piteous lamentations, groans, shouts,
imprecations, the hissing of fire bursting from the houses,
the crashing of doors and windows, and the reports of
muskets used in violence, resounded for two days and
nights in the streets of Badajos! On the third, when the
city was sacked, when the soldiers were exhausted by their
own excesses, the tumult rather subsided than was quelled:
the wounded men were
then
looked to, and the dead disposed
of!

âFive thousand men fell in this short siegeâthree thousand
five hundred in the assaultâin a space of less than a
hundred square yards!

âWhen the extent of the nightâs havoc was made known
to Lord Wellington, the firmness of his nature gave way for
a moment, and the pride of conquest yielded to a passionate
burst of grief for the loss of his gallant soldiers.â

575

CIUDAD RODRIGO.

A.D. 1812.

The
allied army under Lord Wellington remained in
cantonments till the 7th of January, waiting for the arrival
of the artillery; the light divisions being advanced in front,
observing the enemyâs movements.

The battering-train having reached Almeida on the 8th,
Lord Wellington commenced the investment of Ciudad
Rodrigo. Before this place could be even approached, it
was necessary to take or destroy a palisadoed redoubt, which
had been erected on the hill of St. Francisco, as also three
fortified convents connected with that work. This operation
was given to Major-General Crawford, who, as soon as it was
dark, sent Colonel Colborne, of the 52nd, with a detachment
of the light division, to take the fort. The attack was ably
conducted by Colonel Colborne; it was stormed in gallant
style, two captains and forty-seven men being made prisoners.
Captain Mein, of the 52nd, who led the storming
party, was severely wounded, but the British loss was
trifling. In consequence of this success, the army broke
ground the same night, within six hundred yards of the
city, notwithstanding that the enemy held the fortified
convents.

On the 14th of January, Lord Wellington opened his fire
from twenty-two pieces of ordnance, which formed three
batteries in the first parallel. On the night of that day,
likewise, the approach was opened with the second parallel,
and the besiegers were established in it, within a hundred
and fifty yards of the walls of the place. This operation
was rendered secure on the right, by General Sir Thomas
Graham having surprised the enemyâs detachment in the
convent of Santa Cruz, and General Colville equally secured
it on the left by getting possession of the convent of St.
Francisco.

January 15th, 16th, and 17th were spent in completing
the second parallel and the approaches to it, and in erecting
576

a battery in the neighbourhood of the convent of St. Francisco,
which opened on the 18th. By the 19th the breaches
in the
fausse-braie
wall, and in the body of the place,
effected by the batteries in the first parallel, were considered
practicable, as was also a breach in the suburbs of
St. Francisco, which had been made by the batteries opened
on the 15th. Marmont was now, to all appearance, advancing
with a powerful force from Salamanca, for the purpose
of raising the siege; Lord Wellington therefore saw
that no time was to be lost, and accordingly determined to
make an instant attempt on the city by storm.

The third and light divisions were fixed upon for this
important service, as they happened to be the troops on
duty that day, the army taking the duties of the trenches
by divisions during the siege. They were formed into five
columns. The two right, conducted by Lieutenant-Colonel
C. Toole, of the 2nd Portuguese CaÃ§adores, and Major Ridge,
of the 5th regiment, were destined to protect the advance
of the third column, which was composed of General
MâKinnonâs brigade, to the top of the breach in the
fausse-braie

wall. The fourth column was composed of the 43rd
and 52nd, and part of the 95th regiments, and was directed
by General Crawford. This was destined to attack the
breach on the left, in the suburbs of St. Francisco, and to
cover the left of the attack at the principal breach by the
troops of the third division, under General Picton. General
Packâs Portuguese brigade, which formed the fifth column,
was directed to make a false attack upon the south face of
the fort. Besides these columns, the 94th regiment, under
the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, was ordered to
descend into the ditch on the right of General MâKinnonâs
column, for the purpose of protecting it against the obstacles
which it was supposed the enemy would construct to oppose
its progress to the principal breach in the
fausse-braie

wall.

The assault was made according to these arrangements.
Major Ridge with his column escaladed the
fausse-braie

wall, and stormed the principal breach in the main body of
the place, together with the 94th regiment, which had moved
along the ditch, and had stormed the breach of the
fausse-braie

wall in the front of General MâKinnonâs brigade, so
577

that it not only covered the advance of that brigade, but
even preceded it in the attack. Generals Crawford and
Vandeleur, with the troops on the left, were equally forward
in their movements, and in less than half an hour from the
commencement of the attack, the city was in possession of
the allies. General Pack converted his false attack into a
real one. The Portuguese troops scaled the walls in every
direction; and the advanced-guard, under Major Lynch, followed
the enemyâs troops from the advanced works into the

fausse-braie
, where they made prisoners of all that opposed
them.

Major-General MâKinnon was blown up by the explosion
of one of the enemyâs mines near the breach. General
Crawford received a mortal wound while leading on his
division; and Major Napier, one of the bravest men in the
army, lost an arm. MâKinnon had been a schoolfellow of
Buonaparte.

The value of this capture of Ciudad Rodrigo was very
great. 1st. It erected a wall, and a very strong one, against
any new invasion of the Portuguese frontier. 2nd. It was
so much gained towards clearing the country between the
Douro and the Tagus. 3rd. It intercepted the communication
of the enemy between the north and south of Spain,
and thereby rendered the operations of their armies in the
north, and their army in the south, two distinct lines, having
the allied army between them. 4th. It paved the way for
the siege of Badajos. 5th. It greatly raised the credit and
popularity of the allied cause.

This siege only lasted twelve days. The allies lost twelve
hundred men and ninety officers; among the latter of whom
was one who appears to have been a general favourite, for
it was said, âThree generals and seventy other officers had
fallen, yet the soldiers fresh from the strife only talked of
Hardyman:â he was a captain of the 45th.

It is lamentable to hear the historian of the Peninsular
war attach the same blame to the allied troops in this siege
as we have mentioned in that of Badajos. âDisgraceful,â
he says, âwere the excesses of the allied troops: the Spanish
people were allies and friends, unarmed and helpless, yet all
these claims were disregarded. âThe soldiers were not to be
controlled.â That excuse will not suffice. Colonel Macleod,
578

of the 43rd, a young man of most energetic spirit, placed
guards at the breach, and constrained his regiment to keep
its ranks for a long time after the disorder commenced; but
as no previous general measures had been taken, and no
organized efforts made by higher authorities, the men were
finally carried away in the increasing tumult.â This is a severe
but just censure upon âthe higher authorities.â We know
that the British common soldier is taken from the lowest
ranks of society, but we cannot agree that cold-blooded
cruelty is a distinguishing characteristic even of these
classes; we believe the British people to be averse to cruel
triumph over a fallen enemy, and we should rather attribute
the excesses complained of to the partisan portion of the
army: civil warfare is generally the most inveterate. The
Spaniards were most likely to be cruel towards their compatriots;
few people are more inveterate when their passions
are roused.

For this achievement Lord Wellington was created duke
of Ciudad Rodrigo by the Spaniards, earl of Wellington
by the English, and marquis of Torres Vedras by the
Portuguese.

THE CASTLE OF BURGOS.

A.D. 1812.

This
is a small fortress, but an important siege, filled
with incident and instruction.

On the morning of the 18th of September, the army was
in front of Burgos, and may be said to have commenced a
siege, in which the historians of the different nations, without
any just imputation upon their truth, may each claim
for their country the palm of active courage and patient
firmness. The town was as bravely defended as it was
bravely assailed, and the ardent and persevering enterprise
of the attack was met by corresponding vigour and vigilance
in the defence.

Burgos is the capital of Old Castile, and was the cradle
of the Castilian kings and monarchy. It is memorable for
the noble stand which it repeatedly made against the
Saracens. After the retreat of Massena, it was considered
579

a critical and dangerous point, and its fortifications were
repaired. The ruins of the castle were very strong, being
stone, and of deep foundation, situated, besides, on the brow
of a hill, commanding the river Arlanzon, on which the
town stands, and the roads on both sides of it. These
ruins were repaired, and strengthened by additional earthworks.
Beyond the hill on which the castle is situated is
another eminence, called St. Michaelâs Hill, on which a
hornwork was erected. Adjoining the castle was a church,
which was converted into a fort. The above works were
included within three distinct lines of circumvallation, which
were so carried and connected as to form an oblong square,
and each to defend and support without endangering (in
the event of being itself lost) the others. The garrison
consisted of more than two thousand men.

As Burgos is on the north side of the Arlanzon, whilst
the allied army was on the south, and as the castle commanded
both the river and the roads, Wellington had some
difficulty in preparing the passage, and the remainder of
the day of the 18th was employed in making the necessary
arrangements. On the following day this operation was
effected. The outworks of the hill of St. Michael were
immediately seized, and the troops posted close to the hornwork.
At night the hornwork was itself attacked and carried,
and thus the whole of St. Michaelâs Hill was obtained.
This hill was, however, a mere outwork to the main fortress,
inasmuch as the possession of it only brought the allies in
front of the outermost of the three lines, behind which were
the castle and body of the work.

The possession of this eminence afforded the allies a
better knowledge of the defences of the fort, with a commanding
view of some of the works. The besieged evinced
neither tardiness nor want of skill; they had demolished, in
an incredibly short time, the houses which interfered with
their line of defence. They had raised ramparts of earth
and biscuit-barrels, and constructed fleches and redans to
cover the batteries and sally-gates. These works, considering
the materials and the pressure of the time, were
so solid and accurate as to command the general praise of
the British engineers, whilst the Portuguese regarded them
with astonishment: a proof of the value of the knowledge
580

of field-work, as it then existed in the French army, when
almost every soldier could assist the artillery, and take his
share in the work of attack and defence in sieges. It is
observed by a writer of the time, âWe must confess that
the patience of the English privates was more exemplary
than their dexterity.â

From the 19th to the 22nd of September, the allies were
employed in raising their own works upon St. Michaelâs
Hill, in front of the exterior line of the enemy, and more
particularly in fortifying and completing the hornwork, of
which they had possessed themselves. Everything being
ready on the evening of the 22nd, it was resolved to give
the first regular assault. Accordingly, at the hour of eleven
at night, the storming body was moved forward in two
columns: the one, consisting of Portuguese, to the south-west
flank of the castle; and the other of British, under
Major Laurie, to the front. The plan of the attack was, that
the Portuguese should engage and occupy the eminence on
the above-mentioned flank, while Major Laurieâs party should
escalade the parapet in front.

The Portuguese, who were to begin the attack, commenced
with much spirit. They were opposed to a deep
ditch and a lofty parapet on the opposite side, and therefore
had to descend into the one and fight their way up the other.
It may be necessary to state to the uninitiated, that the
shelving side of the ditch which adjoins the parapet is technically
termed the scarp, and the opposite side of the ditch
(the side nearest an advancing enemy) the counterscarp.
They were stopped at the very edge of the descent into this
ditch; their attack, therefore, as a diversion, became nugatory,
and failed in the first instance.

In the meanwhile, the party in front, under Major Laurie,
having seen the Portuguese commence, advanced with the
most determined bravery to the escalade, and having the
same works in opposition to them as the Portuguese, in an
instant reached the head of the counterscarp, and in another
instant descended it, cleared the palisades at the bottom,
and planted their ladders to the parapet. The first assailants
penetrated to the top of the parapet, and a fierce contest
took place both there and in the bottom of the ditch.
The assault was repelled with as much spirit as it was made
581

and the ditch and scarp were covered with dead of both parties.
Amongst these was the gallant leader himself, Major
Laurie.

This gallantry, however, was rendered useless by the
total failure of the Portuguese division. After much severe
fighting, therefore, and a great consequent loss, the party was
withdrawn,âan affair in itself of great peril and difficulty,
as their ardour had carried them nearly into the lines. It
was a matter of congratulation that the whole party had
escaped being made prisoners. The total British and Portuguese
loss on this occasion was not short of four hundred
killed and wounded.

It would be of little professional instruction, and of less
general interest, to follow the details of an irregular, and
therefore inartificial siege, from day to day; we shall
therefore confine ourselves to the attacks. Of those, during
the whole siege, there were five; two we have already
described.

After the failure of the storm on the 22nd, a mine was
directed under the same exterior line. It was exploded in
the midnight of the 29th, and a breach, erroneously deemed
practicable, effected in the parapet. A storming party was
immediately advanced, and at the same moment, for the
purpose of diversion, a strong column was directed in front
of the town. The storming party unluckily missed its way,
and thereby the affair failed.

Between the following day and the 4th of October, another
mine was conducted near to the same point, and the
former breach was improved by fire from the batteries. This
mine was exploded in the afternoon of the 4th, and the
result was a second practicable breach. These two breaches
were immediately stormed by the second battalion of the
twenty-fourth, divided into two parties, under Captain Hedderwick
and Lieutenants Holmes and Fraser. This assault was
completely successful, and the allies were thus established
within the exterior line of the castle. The loss was severe,
but not beyond the value of the service.

The enemy, however, did not leave the allies in tranquil
possession of this position: they made two vigorous sallies
to interrupt the works against the second line, and continued
their operations for the same purpose with very little
582

intermission. A breach was effected, and a mine was in
progress; but from want of siege materials, particularly of
a battering-train, the advances were slow, and it became
obvious that success was doubtful. There were only three
eighteen-pounders, and no materials or instruments but what
were made upon the spot. We must in candour admit that
no blame could be justly attached to any one, as these privations
were necessary circumstances of the enterprise. The
siege of Burgos was an expeditionary operation, and at no
point, either of the march of the army towards it or during
the time occupied in the siege, could the marquis of Wellington
have taken a train with him, or have sent for it and
waited for its arrival. There were in fact two trains on the
Spanish frontier,âthe one at Ciudad Rodrigo, and another
at Badajos; but the nature of the operations, the distance,
and the roads, rendered them totally immoveable. A question
has here been putâwhy, then, did the marquis undertake
this siege; and did not the result disappoint his calculations?
To this there are several answers. First. Upon
the forward march and assembling of the enemy on the
Douro, it became necessary for him to repel them; and his
march and pursuit for this purpose brought him in front of
Burgos. Second. There was nothing in the external
character of the castle and works of Burgos to justify the
expectation of a long defence: the body of the castle, as
reported by the engineers, was a repaired ruin, and the outworks
were fieldworks of earth. If the apparatus of attack
was incomplete, so likewise was that of defence. In a word,
both the attack and defence were of the same expeditionary
character and means. Third. The language of the private
correspondence of the army was substantially as follows,
and contains a full answer to this and all similar objections:âThat
the value of the place and the army being there, rendered
it indispensable to make an effort to acquire it; that
the marquis had hopes of effecting this acquisition, but certainly
no assured expectation; that the event might therefore
disappoint his wishes, but not deceive him; that the
very character of the defence, gallant as it was, was such as
to encourage the continuance of the attack; such advantage
being so
nearly
gained and so narrowly eluded, as if
gained, would have been necessarily followed by the capture
583

of the place. The garrison, moreover, were without water,
and suffered great severities by having to bivouac in narrow
quarters.
20

On the morning of the 18th of October, a breach having
been effected and a mine having been prepared under the
church of St. Roman, it was resolved that the mine should
be exploded the same evening, and that upon such explosion,
the breach should be stormed and the line (the second line)
escaladed. Accordingly, at the appointed time in the evening,
the attacking party was divided into three columns:
the one under Lieutenant-Colonel Browne, composed of
Spanish and Portuguese, were to attack the church; the
second party, composed of a detachment of the German
legion, under Major Wurmb, were to storm the breach;
whilst the third party, composed of the guards, were to
escalade the line. At this moment the mine blew up, and,
being the appointed signal, the parties at once rushed forward
to their assigned points.

The explosion of the mine carried away the whole of the
wall which defended that point, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Browne succeeded in lodging his party on the ruins and
outworks. The enemy retreated to a second parapet behind
the church, over the heads of the advancing assailants.
This occasioned much loss and confusion; and a flank fire
of the enemy coming in aid, compelled the lieutenant-colonel
to suffer the retreat of his men, and to content himself
with saving them from disorder.

In the mean time, Major Wurmb had directed his party
against the breach. The distinguished gallantry of this
assault merited a more successful result. The breach was
carried in an instant, and a considerable number of the
party in the same moment got into the body of the place.
But here began the conflict. The enemy opened upon them
such a destructive fire, both from the third line and the body
of the castle, and brought down upon them such superior
numbers, that, after the loss of their gallant leader and a
great proportion of their force, they were compelled to
retire, and almost in the moment of victory to evacuate what
they had so bravely gained.

The third party, the guards, experienced a similar success
584

in the commencement, and a similar disappointment in the
result. They succeeded in escalading the line, but were
compelled to retire before the superiority of numbers and the
fire of the enemy. In his official despatch, dated CabeÃ§on,
26th of October, 1812, the marquis of Wellington thus

writes:â

âIt is impossible to represent in adequate terms my sense
of the conduct of the guards and German legion upon this
occasion; and I am quite satisfied, that if it had been possible
to maintain the posts which they had gained with so
much gallantry, these troops would have maintained them.
Some of the men stormed even the third line, and even one
of them was killed in one of the embrasures of the parapet.â

The army of Portugal and the army of the North, for
they were so near each other as to constitute one army, had
not suffered this siege to go on without some attempts to
interrupt it; they had now, however, attained a strength and
importance that demand our attention.

These two armies were stationed on the high road from
Burgos to Miranda on the Ebro, a continuance of the great
French road from Madrid, through Burgos to Bayonne.
From Burgos to Miranda on the Ebro is forty English miles.
Above the village of Monasterio, on that side of it furthest
from Burgos, was a range of hills, which was the position of
the British outposts. The army of Portugal was in the
neighbourhood of Bribiesca; and the army of the North,
under General Cafferilli, had its head-quarters at Pancorvo.

The principal attempts of these armies were on the 13th
and 18th of October. On the former of these days, General
Macune, who was in command of the French at Bribiesca,
moved forward a considerable body of infantry and cavalry
against the posts of the allies at Monasterio, but was repulsed
as well by the posts themselves as by a detachment of the
German legion.

On the 18th, the army of Portugal, having been previously
strongly reinforced by the arrival of levies from France,
re-advanced against the said posts, and possessed themselves
of the hills and town. It now, therefore, became necessary
to lead the army against them, and accordingly, with the
exception of that portion of it required for the siege, the
marquis assembled the troops, and placed the allied army on
585

some heights between Burgos and Quentana. This movement
was made on the 19th of October. The enemy assembled
their army at Monasterio on the same day. On the
following evening, the 20th, they moved a force of nearly
ten thousand men to drive in the outposts at Quentana, and
which, according to order, withdrew as they approached.
The marquis had now recourse to a flank movement; the
result gave him an advantage; upon seeing which, the enemy
again fell back upon Monasterio.

And this manÅuvre, indeed, was the last operation of the
siege of Burgos, for on the following day, the 21st, a letter
from Sir R. Hill reported such a state of affairs upon the
Tagus, that the marquis found it to be an act of necessity
immediately to raise the siege, and to fall back upon the
Douro. Accordingly, the siege was raised the same night,
and the army was in march on the following morning.

ST. SEBASTIAN.

A.D. 1813.

On
the retreat of the French army after its defeat at
Vittoria, Marshal Jourdan threw a garrison into St. Sebastian
of between three and four thousand men, and the place was
immediately afterwards invested by the Spaniards. In the
beginning of July, the fifth division of the army, with two
Portuguese brigades, making a force of from 9,000 to
10,000 men, arrived before it to form the siege, which was
intrusted to Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Graham.

A proportion of artillery, consisting of twenty-four
pounders, with 1,500 rounds of ammunition per gun, six
eight-inch howitzers, with 1,000, and four ten-inch mortars,
with 500 rounds, and four sixty-eight-pounders, with a
proportion of shells, were in ships at Los Passages; and
with the army there were six eighteen-pounders: this
quantity of artillery was deemed adequate to the attack of
the place.

The town of St. Sebastian is built on a peninsula running
nearly east and west; the northern side being washed by
the river Urumea, the southern by the sea. The front
586

defences, which cross the isthmus towards the land, are a
double line of works, with the usual counterscarp, covered
way, and glacis; but the works running lengthwise of the
peninsula are only a single line, and, trusting to the water
in their front to render them inaccessible, they are built
without any cover; and the northern line is quite exposed,
from the top to the bottom, to a range of hills on the right
bank of the river, at a distance of six or seven hundred
yards from it. These walls being uncovered, appears an
unaccountable oversight, as the Urumea, for some hours
before and after low water, is fordable, and the tide recedes
so much, that for the same period there is a considerable
dry space along the left bank of the river, by which troops
can march to the foot of the wall.

Marshal Berwick, when he attacked St. Sebastian in 1719,
aware of this circumstance, threw up batteries on those
hills to break the town wall, and, whilst that was being
effected, he pushed on approaches along the isthmus, and
established himself on the covered way of the land front:
as is but too frequently the case, as soon as the breach was
practicable, the governor capitulated for the town, and the
duke obliged him and the garrison to retire into the castle.
It was now proposed to follow the same mode of attack,
and as a preliminary, the garrison were to be driven from a
post they occupied about seven or eight hundred yards in
advance of the town, formed by the convent of St. Bartolomeo
and a redoubt then in progress; and from a small
circular work, which they made with casks on the causeway,
four eighteen-pounders and two howitzers were put in
battery for that purpose.

The operations against the town were commenced by the
erection of batteries on the hills to the north of the Urumea,
for twenty twenty-four-pounders, four eight-inch howitzers,
four ten-inch mortars, and four sixty-eight-pounder carronades;
the guns to breach the sea-wall between the two
towers, the carronades to be used with shells only, and the
mortars to be directed against the land front and castle.

On the 14th of July, the first two batteries opened on
the convent of St. Bartolomeo.

15th of July.âA false attack was made on the convent
of St. Bartolomeo, to ascertain if the enemy intended
587

obstinately to defend it, which the troops carrying farther
than was ordered, they were obliged to retire with some
loss.

17th of July.âThe end of the convent having been
entirely beaten down, the ninth regiment and a Portuguese
brigade assaulted and carried it with little difficulty.

Two more batteries for the eighteen-pounders and the
two howitzers were thrown up in the night, in a situation
to enfilade and take in reverse the defences of the town.

On the night of the 18th of July the suburbs of
St. Martin, which the enemy had burned, were occupied:
they, however, continued to hold the circular redoubt.

Night between the 19th and 20th of July.âApproaches
were struck out to the right and left of St. Martin.

On the 20th of July all the batteries opened.

In the night between the 20th and 21st of July, early
in the evening, the enemy abandoned the circular redoubt:
a working party of seven hundred men had been prepared
to open a parallel across the isthmus, but the night proving
extremely dark, tempestuous, and rainy, the men dispersed
among the ruined buildings of St. Martin, and not more
than two hundred could be collected together; therefore
only about one-third of the parallel and the right approach
to it were opened.

On the 21st of July, Sir Thomas Graham sent a flag of
truce with a summons to the governor, but he would not
receive it.

In the night between the 21st and 22nd of July, the left
communication and the remainder of the parallel across the
isthmus were opened; the parallel near its left crossed a
drain level with the ground, four feet high and three feet
wide, through which ran a pipe to convey water into the
town. Lieutenant Reid ventured to explore it, and at the
end of 230 yards, he found it closed by a door in the
counterscarp, opposite to the face of the right demi-bastion
of the hornwork; as the ditch was narrow, it was thought
that by forming a mine at this extremity of the drain, the
explosion would throw earth sufficient against the escarpe,
only twenty-four feet high, to form a road over it; eight
feet at the end of the aqueduct was therefore stopped with
filled sand-bags, and thirty barrels of powder, of ninety pounds
588

each, were lodged against it, and a
saucisson
led to the
mouth of the drain.

On the 23rd of July the breach between the two towers,
about one hundred feet in length, being considered practicable,
the fire of all the guns was concentrated on a part
of the wall to its left to effect a second breach, and by
evening, that also was considered practicable on a front of
thirty feet. At the same time, the four ten-inch mortars
and the sixty-eight-pounder carronades were turned on the
defences and on the houses in rear of the breach, to prevent
the enemy working to form an obstacle to them.

The breaches were to have been stormed at daylight on
the 24th, at which time the tide was out, and the troops
were formed in readiness; but the houses at the back of
the breach being on fire, it was supposed they would prevent
the advance of the troops when they had gained the summit,
and in consequence the order was countermanded.

The next night a trench was opened in advance of the
parallel, to contain a firing party on the hornwork, during
the assault.

The assault was ordered to take place at daylight on the
25th; the storming party, about 2,000 men, were to assemble
in the trenches, and the explosion of the mine was to be the
signal to advance.

The distance of the uncovered approach, from the trenches
to the breach, was about three hundred yards, in face of an
extensive front of works, over very difficult ground, consisting
of rocks covered with sea-weed, and intermediate
pools of water; the fire of the place was yet entire, and the
breach was flanked by two towers, which, though considerably
injured, were still occupied.

At five
A.M.
the mine was sprung, and destroyed a considerable
length of the counterscarp and glacis, and created
so much astonishment in the enemy posted on the works
near to it, that they abandoned them for the moment, and
the advance of the storming party reached the breach before
any great fire was brought to bear on them: on their
attempting to ascend the breach, the enemy opened so
heavy a fire, and threw down such a number of shells, &c.,
from the towers on the flanks, and from the summit of the
breaches, that the men began to waver, and in a short time
589

the assaulting party had returned into the trenches, with
the loss of nearly one hundred killed and four hundred
wounded.

The advanced guard, with Lieutenant Jones, who led them,
were made prisoners on the breach; of the other engineers,
Captain Lewis was severely wounded, and Lieutenant Machell
was killed. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir R. Fletcher was wounded
at the same time in the trenches.

This assault does not appear to have failed from want of
exertion, but from the fire of the place being left entire, and
from the great distance at which the covered approaches
were from the breach; the troops were stated in the
Gazette

to have done their duty, but that it was beyond the power
of gallantry to overcome the difficulties opposed to them.

On this failure being reported to Lord Wellington, he
came over from Lesaca, and decided upon renewing the
same mode of attack, but on a much more extended scale,
as soon as sufficient guns and ammunition should arrive
from England; the augmentation to the attack was to extend
the breach on the left to the salient angle of the
demi-bastion of the main front, and from batteries to be
established on the left of the attack, to continue it round
the whole of its face, and to the end of the high curtain
above it.

On the 27th of July, at seven
A.M.
, the enemy made a
sortie, to feel the guard of the trenches; they surprised it,
and entering the parallel at the left, swept it to the right,
carrying into the place two hundred prisoners. In consequence
of this loss, the guard was concentrated in a small
portion of the left of the parallel, and the right of the
trenches was only occasionally patrolled.

On the 28th of July, Marshal Soult attacked Lord Wellington,
in the hope of relieving Pampeluna, and the result
of the action not being known to Sir Thomas Graham, he,
on the 29th, embarked all the artillery and stores at Los
Passages, and sent the transports to sea; the siege was
therefore converted into a blockade, the guard continuing
to hold the trenches.

August 3rd, the enemy surprised a patrol in the parallel,
and made it prisoners.

On the 6th the guns and stores were re-landed at Los
590

Passages, and on the 18th the additional artillery and ammunition
arrived from England.

On the 24th the entire of the trenches was again occupied,
and the siege recommenced.

On the left, two additional batteries for thirteen guns, to
breach the face of the left demi-bastion and the curtain
above it, at seven hundred yardsâ distance, were commenced,
and on the right, cover was begun for seven additional
howitzers, four sixty-eight-pounder carronades, twenty-one
twenty-four-pounders, and sixteen mortars, being forty-eight
pieces of ordnance, in addition to the thirty-two put in
battery for the previous operation.

At midnight the enemy made a sortie, entered the advanced
part of the trenches, and carried confusion into the
parallel; in attempting, however, to sweep along its right,
they were checked by a part of the guard of the trenches,
and obliged to retire, carrying off with them about twelve
prisoners.

At eight
A.M.
of the 26th of August, the batteries opened.
On the isthmus, the thirteen guns were directed to breach
the left demi-bastion of the main front, and the end of the
curtain in continuation of the old breach, and the face of the
left demi-bastion of the hornwork, which were all seen in a
line, one above the other.

The fire of the batteries on the right was directed to
breach the two towers, one on each flank of the old breach,
and to continue that breach to the salient angle of the
demi-bastion, and to breach the end of the curtain above it.

Two shafts were sunk to form galleries, to prevent the
enemy mining under the advanced part of the trenches.
In the night between the 26th and the 27th, the two last-erected
batteries being at a long distance to breach, and
not seeing the foot of the escarpes, cover was made for four
of the guns in a preferable situation.

A party of two hundred men was landed this night on
the high rocky island of Sta Clara, and made prisoners of
the enemyâs guard on it, consisting of an officer and twenty-four
men.

In the night between the 27th and 28th of August, the
enemy made a sortie; but, profiting by past experience, such
precautions had been taken of posting sentinels, &c., and
591

the men were so prepared to stand to their arms, that
they were immediately repulsed, without effecting the
slightest mischief.

On the 29th of August a battery opened on the face of
the demi-bastion of the main front; the eighteen-pounders
and the howitzers were turned on the enemyâs batteries, and
several mortars and the carronades at the right attack were
directed to the same object, and in the course of the day
the enemyâs fire was nearly subdued. It was afterwards
ascertained that they lost many men, particularly by the
spherical case-shot, which they endeavoured to imitate, by
firing common shells filled with small balls, and bursting
them over the heads of the troops, but without any effect.

The breaches appearing good and practicable on the 30th,
it was deemed time to prepare the necessary debouches for
the troops: at the advanced sap on the right, to break
through the sea-wall, which was of masonry, four feet thick
and ten feet above the level of high water, three shafts were
commenced, the first close at the back of the wall, the
second twenty-five feet from the wall, and the third forty
feet from the second: they were sunk eight feet below the
surface of the ground, and a small return made to contain
the powder; they were then each loaded with five hundred
and forty pounds of powder.

At two
A.M.
the next morning, the three mines were
sprung, and blew the wall completely down. The diameters
of the entonnoirs were about thirty feet; they were immediately
connected, and by ten
A.M.
formed a good passage
out for troops, and accomplished the original object of
securing all the works in their rear from the effects of any
galleries the enemy might have run out to form mines in
that direction. At the time of low water, about eleven
A.M.
,
the columns for the assault moved out of the trenches by
the openings in front of the battery, and in a few minutes
after the advance of the forlorn hope, the enemy exploded
two mines, which blew down part of the sea-line wall; but
as the troops were not in very close order, nor very near
the wall, their loss was not great.

From the Mirador and Battery del Principe, on the
castle, a fire of grape and shells was opened on the column,
and continued during the time they were disputing the
592

breach. The main curtain, even to the end breached, was
strongly occupied by grenadiers, and the left branch of the
hornwork was well manned, and from thence a heavy fire
was maintained on the breach, a great part of which was
exposed to it; but the tower of Amozquita, on the left of
the breach, fortunately for the besieged, was not manned.

Up the end of the curtain, the breach was accessible quite
to the
terreplein
; but the enemyâs situation there was commanding,
and the ascent was much exposed to the fire of the
hornwork.

At the back of the whole of the rest of the breach was a
perpendicular fall, from fifteen to twenty-five feet in depth,
under which were the ruins of the houses which joined on to
the back of the breach; and here and there was left an end
wall of the houses, by which alone it was possible to descend.
A line of retrenchment carried along the nearest standing
parallel walls, was strongly occupied by the enemy, and
which entirely swept the confined summit of the breach.

The storming parties advanced to the breach, and there
remained on the side of it without being able to crown the
top, from the heavy fire from the intrenched ruins within.
Many desperate efforts were made to gain it, without effect,
particularly up to the curtain; but the enemy maintained that
post firmly. Fresh troops were sent on successively, as fast
as they could be filed out of the trenches, with laudable
perseverance; and the Portuguese, in two detachments,
forded the river Urumea, near its mouth, in a very handsome
style, under a heavy fire of grape and musketry.

The breach was now covered with troops remaining in the
same unfavourable situation, and unable to gain the summit.
Upwards of two hours of continued exertion had elapsed,
when, by a happy chance, a quantity of combustibles exploded
within the breach, and the French began to waver;
the assailants made fresh efforts; the ravelin and left branch
of the hornwork were abandoned by the enemy; the retrenchment
within the breach was soon after deserted by
them; and the men by degrees got over the ruins and gained
the curtain.

The troops, being now assembled in great numbers on the
breach, pushed into the town; the garrison, dispirited at its
great loss, and intimidated at the perseverance shown in
593

sending fresh men, was quickly driven from all its entrenchments,
except the convent of St. Teresa, into the castle.

From the superior height of the curtain, the artillery in
the batteries on the right of the Urumea were able to keep
up a fire on that part during the assault, without injury to
the troops at the foot of the breach, and being extremely
well served, it occasioned a severe loss to the enemy, and
probably caused the explosion which led to the final success
of the assault.

The assailants had upwards of five hundred killed and
fifteen hundred wounded; of the garrison, besides the actual
killed and wounded during the assault, seven hundred were
made prisoners in the town. Of the engineers, Lieutenant-colonel
Sir R. Fletcher, Captains Rhodes and Collyer, were
killed; and Lieutenant-colonel Burgoyne, and Lieutenants
Barry and Marshall, were wounded.

As soon as the town was carried, a communication was
made from the left of the parallel to the salient angle of the
ditch of the ravelin, through the counterscarp, which was
blown in, and so into the town by the great gate; and preparations
were made to reduce the castle.

The plan for the attack was to erect batteries on the works
of the town, and breach some of the main points of the castle
defences, as the battery de la Reyna, the Mirador, and the
keep, as well as the thin loop-holed walls connecting them.

On the 2nd of September, a new battery for seventeen
guns was commenced, occupying the whole terreplein of the
hornwork, and another for three guns on the left of the cask
redoubt.

A discussion for surrender was entered into with General
Rey, but he broke it off.

By the 4th of September, the town, which caught fire soon
after the assault, from the quantity of ammunition and combustibles
of all sorts scattered about, was nearly consumed,
and the fire became a great impediment to carrying the
approaches forward.

Up to the 7th, the enemy had fired but very little since
the assault; and by this evening, the roofs of the unburnt
houses and steeples had been prepared for musketry, to open
at the time of the assault on the castle.

On the 8th, at ten
A.M.
, all the batteries opened on the
594

castle; viz.,âfrom the left of the attack:âNo. 7, with three
twenty-four pounders, against the Mirador; No. 8, with
three eighteen-pounders, against the lower defences; No. 9,
with seventeen twenty-four pounders, against the Mirador
and battery de la Reyna; island, with two twenty-four
pounders and one eight-inch howitzer, to sweep the back of
the castle. From the right of the attack, thirty-three pieces
of ordnance against the castle generally. The fire was extremely
powerful and well-directed, ploughing up every part
of the confined space of the castle. The enemy kept concealed
chiefly in little narrow trenches, which they had made
along the front of the heights, but they evidently lost many
men. About twelve, a white flag was hoisted, and the garrison
surrendered prisoners of war. Their numbers had been
reduced to 80 officers and 1,756 men, of whom, 23 officers
and 512 men were in the hospital.

The loss of the besiegers during the attack was,â53
officers and 898 men killed; 150 officers and 2,340 men
wounded; 7 officers and 332 men missing.

There were used at this siege 2,726 gabions, 1,476 eighteen-feet
fascines, and 20,000 sand-bags.

SIEGE OF ANTWERP.

A.D. 1830.

This
siege, although it took place at a distance of fifteen
years from its cause, was the result of one of the many political
errors of the treaty of Vienna. Nothing could be more
unwise and short-sighted than to expect a peaceful union
between Belgium and Holland, and particularly of so strict
a nature as that union in some of its features was composed.
Although near neighbours, the Belgians and the Dutch are
widely different: different in language, institutions, blood,
and traditions. The union likewise, instead of being cemented
by conciliation, was rendered galling by oppressive
enactments; the monarch reigning over both countries was
the king of Holland, and the proceedings of the courts of
law were commanded to be carried on in the language of
that country, so that Belgium appeared more like a conquered
province than a willing partner in a union brought
about for the benefit of both. If the union of England
with Scotland had been carried on upon the principle of the
one we are speaking of, the animosities and heart-burnings
would never have subsided; we have had two invasions or
rebellions, as it is, in which that country has taken part
against us, although we form part of the same island. The
Belgians have more of the character of the French or the
Germans than of the Dutch; they are as industrious, ingenious,
and mercantile as the Dutch; but they are more
chivalric in their traditions; which feeling is kept alive by
their splendid mediÃ¦val monuments, by their noble history,
and by the Catholic religion; and, however science, and the
progress of general knowledge, may soften down the asperities
which separate neighbouring peoples, no nation, capable
of good, willingly parts from its traditions. In short, the
Belgians were not a people to sink willingly into a secondary
state, particularly under the Dutch, with whom they felt
596

themselves perfectly able to dispute the question, and were
ripe for insurrection, if so it can be called, when the French
revolution of 1830 set the minds of all Europeans labouring
under real or fancied wrong in a state of ferment. The
Belgians rose
en masse
; one place after another fell into
the hands of the provisional government; Prince Frederick
was shamefully and unaccountably repulsed from Brussels;
and little remained to the house of Nassau, except the
splendidly fortified city of Antwerp.

Disheartened and disgusted by the failure of his brother,
the prince of Orangeâwho acted for his father, King Williamâhastened
to Antwerp. He threw himself with honest
energy into the cause, in the hope of maintaining the sway
of his house over Belgium, and, at the same time, of serving
the Belgians and responding to their views. He affected
to act for himself, and offered to become their independent
ruler; but it was evident that he was governed by orders
from the Hague, and that the command of the army was
still in the hands of his brother Frederick and General
ChassÃ©. An ill-timed royal proclamation and summons of
the Dutch to arms, which designated the southern provinces

rebels
, completed the want of confidence in the prince, and
rendered all his efforts nugatoryâeven his proclamation to
place himself at the head of the movement. The provisional
government contemptuously rejected all acknowledgment of
authority in the Dutchâthey, the people, were, they said,
at the head of their own movement, and they wanted no
other. Treated with scorn by the Belgians, crossed in his
views of conciliation by his father, and his authority disputed
by General ChassÃ©, the prince, with a bleeding heart, was
compelled to abandon all hope, and bade adieu to the
Belgian provinces in a short but affecting address. ChassÃ©
placed Antwerp in a state of siege on the 24th of October.

On the 22nd of October, the patriots, forming an irregular
body of about five thousand men, with sixteen guns, had
commenced a simultaneous movement upon the line occupied
by the royal troops, who were about seven thousand strong,
with forty pieces of artillery. On the 25th the insurgent
army arrived under the walls of Antwerp, and some hard
fighting took place in the suburbs. The strength of the
place would, however, have set them at defiance; but, on
597

the following day, the populace, by a sudden movement
within the city, overpowered and disarmed some of the
Dutch posts. On the 27th this internal contest was
renewed: the populace succeeded in carrying one of the
gates; it was immediately thrown open, and the insurgent
army poured into the city, accompanied by a commissioner
of the provisional government, who had been sent from
Brussels to instal the new authorities. General ChassÃ©,
instead of risking his diminished garrison in street-warfare,
retired into the citadel, the guns of which gave him the
command of the town. The insurgents were not ignorant
of this, and a convention was agreed to, by which both parties
bound themselves to remain quiet. Scarcely, however, had
the convention been signed, when the insurgents, in open
violation of it, attacked the important post of the arsenal,
forcing one of its gates by cannon-shot. This act of
treachery left General ChassÃ© no alternative; he was bound
to do his duty, and defend his men. The citadel and the
frigates in the harbour opened a cannonade upon the town.
âAn awful and simultaneous roar of artillery now fell on
the ears of the affrighted inhabitants. In an instant the
citadel, forts, and fleet hurled forth their converging thunder.
An iron deluge rained upon the city-walls, and clattered
among the buildings. Showers of shells, bombs, and carcases
were heard, cracking, bursting, and bellowing around
the venerable towers of St. Michael; the uproar of their
explosion being multiplied by the echoes of the cathedral.
Walls, roofs, and floors fell, crushed beneath the resistless
weight of projectiles, which sought their victims in the very
cellars, confounding mangled bodies and ruined edifices in
one mutilated and confused heap. Ere long, dark columns
of smoke and jets of flame were seen to rise. The arsenal
and entrepÃ´t were fired. The obscurity of the night soon
gave way to a red and glaring lustre, that converted the
dark vault of heaven into a fiery canopy, whose lurid reflection
announced the fearful catastrophe to the distance of
many leagues.

âThe terror and stupefaction of the inhabitants baffles
description. Some concealed themselves in their vaults and
cellars; others rushed wildly through the streets, shrieking
and bewildered. Such as had horses or vehicles, no matter
598

of what kind, gathered together their valuables, and hastily
fled into the country. Others, intent only on saving life,
darted through the gates on foot, and sought refuge in the
neighbouring fields. Old men, fair women, and young
children,ârich and poor, the hale and the sick, were seen
flying in frantic disorder. The flames having gained the
prison, there was no time to remove its inmates. The
doors were therefore thrown open, and nearly two hundred
convicts were let loose;
but none had the heart to plunder
.
Terror, confusion, and despair reigned paramount. Weeping
women and children clung for succour to men who could
afford them no relief or consolation. Some died of fright,
others lost their senses. Groans, screams, and prayers
were heard between the pauses of the thunder, intermingled
with maledictions on the destroyer, and curses on the
revolution. In a few hours, however, all that had power to
move, or were not transfixed with terror, had fled into the
country. The roads were covered with fugitives of all ages
and sexes, who, with tearful eyes, turned to gaze on their
devoted homes. The darkness of the night, awfully relieved
by the red glare of the flames, the hissing and roaring of
the destructive element, the thunder of the cannon, the
rattling of shot and falling of timbers, the frantic screams
of women and children, and the groans of the wounded and
dying,âall united to fix an impression of horror on the
mind, not to be effaced by time or space.â
22

The siege of Antwerp being such an event as was happily
rare, during the last forty years, it has excited much attention,
and we have given the above extract to meet the
expectations of our readers; but we cannot help suspecting
that the historian has sacrificed something to a little
fine
writing
(in itself not good). We have reason to think the
damage did not amount to near so much as such a portentous
account would imply. The bombarding produced
its horrors, no doubt; but we must not forget that this scene
fell far short of others of the same kind; manâs brutal
passions did not disfigure itâthe soldierâs murderous
sword, guided by revenge, lust, or cupidity, was not there.

The inhabitants and insurgents, terrified at the unexpected
599

severity of General ChassÃ©, sent a deputation at
dawn to treat with him, and it was agreed that affairs
should remain exactly as they were, until the general
question should be definitively settled. ChassÃ© has been
generally and deservedly blamed for having inflicted such
a punishment upon a large, wealthy, commercial city like
Antwerp, for the frantic extravagances of an excited populace:
the bombardment, perhaps, did not in one case injure
the parties who had provoked his anger.

The kingdom of the United Netherlands had been created
by Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia, and France, and when
it was found that the parties could not cohere, they felt called
upon to look after the work of their own hands. Belgium
had nobly obtained its own independence; to have coerced
a reunion would most likely have brought on a serious war,
several of the powers having, too plainly, views of a self-interested
nature. Belgium was, therefore, by general consent,
erected into an independent kingdom, under Prince
Leopold of Saxe-Cobourg; the Dutch immediately withdrew
their troops from that country, and the inhabitants of
Antwerp were relieved from the presence of a foreign
garrison in their citadel.

SEBASTOPOL.

A.D. 1854â1855.

We
now come to the siege which, if not the most important
it has been our task to describe, must be the most
interesting to our readers. No siege has ever been conducted
under similar circumstances. Such have been the
facilities of communication, and so effective and intelligent
the means employed for collecting information, that the
siege of Sebastopol may be said to have been carried on in
the presence of the whole civilized world. It has been a
living and an exciting panorama. When our ancestors, the
Crusaders, were before Antioch or Jerusalem, their relations
at home had no opportunity for mourning losses or celebrating
triumphs, till time, by throwing all into distance,
had weakened the pain or the joy of the intelligence received;
whereas, in this case, there is no half-forgotten friend, no
changed or decayed interests: all is moving, associated with
us, and affecting us, as if the events were passing within the
boundaries of our own seas.

May we not, then, ask, without entertaining less commiseration
for the sufferings, or admiration for the deeds
of the parties engaged, whether this circumstance does not
heighten, or even, in a degree, exaggerate the effect of the
events? The siege of Sebastopol is extraordinary and important
in all ways; but the readers of this volume will find
instances of deeper and more protracted suffering, and
greater sacrifice of human life, than have been experienced
there. Soliman II. lost 40,000 men in four days before
Vienna! The want of water before Jerusalem produced
infinitely more misery than the excess of it in the Crimea;
and the allies have never experienced anything like real
scarcity of food. No siege has ever been placed before the
world in such vivid, such affecting colours. As a poem, the
âIliadâ is doubtless pre-eminent above all such histories;
but divest it, or the âJerusalem Delivered,â of their poetry
601

and their superhuman agencies, and they will hear no comparison
with Mr. Russellâs extraordinary (I was about to
use a much stronger word) correspondence with the
Times
:
physically and mentally, no man could have been better
calculated for the task he undertook. Collected in a volume,
his letters will pass down to posterity in company with
âDrinkwaterâs Gibraltar,â the only work we remember that
is worthy of the association.

With his graphic pictures fresh in the minds of every
one, it is discouraging to attempt an account of this noble
struggle, but as the âGreat Sieges of Historyâ would be
incomplete without it, we must do as we did with that of
Gibraltar, sketch slightly the early scenes, dwell principally
upon the great catastrophe, drawing largely and gratefully
upon a better historian than ourselves; and asserting occasionally
our privilege of commenting upon what passes.

The first thing in this great expedition that strikes a
reflective mind, is the facility of transport. Thought naturally
travels back to the days when an army from Western
Europe, on its way to Constantinople, was diminished by
hundreds of thousands in the mere transit. Compare the
march of Peter the Hermit, Walter the Penniless, and
their countless hosts, with the passage of the gallant allies
to nearly the same scene of actionâwant, fatigue, harassing
enemies, and death,âwith privations and inconveniences
only felt from habitual ease and indulgence. But, perhaps,
this very circumstance enhances the cheerfulness and courage
with which the armies have encountered and passed through
dangers and difficulties to which their previous life had not
at all broken them in. Never, we believe, did an army
better preserve its spirits; a gleam of sunshine, a scintillation
of success, could always restore the Englishmanâs hearty
laugh, the Irishmanâs humorous joke, the Scotchmanâs
sly, sniggering jeer, whilst not even weather or enemies
could silence the music or the gaiety of the French.

Next to the consideration of the troops and the voyage,
our attention is drawn to the
matÃ©riel
with which they
were to work. Although the expedition was long debated,
and at last delayed till too late a period of the year, we are
forced to the painful conviction that the
authorities
at home
threw this great stake without due forethought or knowledge.
602

Their acquaintance with what they had to contend
with was very imperfect, and their inattention to the probable
wants of the troops and the defectiveness of many
of the arms and implements were disgraceful; but this was
soon remedied by our noble
fourth estate
: without âour
correspondent,â Sebastopol would have proved even worse
than a Walcheren.

On the 14th of September, the English and French hosts
had become âan army of occupationâ in the Crimea; the
English troops amounting to 27,000, of which number not
more than 1,000 were horse. And here, within four-and-twenty
hours, the defects of the commissariat and the
deficiencies of the medical staff were painfully felt. The
disembarkation was effected with comparative ease, only
attended with the usual confusion of such affairs, seasoned
with the fun and spirits of the sailors, accustomed to paddle
in the surf. On the 18th the armies proceeded towards
the great point of their destination, and then, for the first
time for five hundred years, the peoples of the two most
enlightened, and in all ways most conspicuous nations of
the world, marched side by side against a common enemy.
The result was worthy of the unionâthe battle of the Alma
was won, with a loss of 3,000 men, notwithstanding the
vast superiority in numbers of the Russian cavalry. But
we must confine ourselves to the siege; and we are not
sorry to shun the description of a battle, as we quite agree
with Mr. Russell, that âthe writer is not yet born who can
describe with vividness and force, so as to bring the details
before the reader, the events of even the slightest skirmish.â
Amidst alerts and skirmishes, whilst being awfully thinned
daily by cholera, the allies marched upon and took possession
of Balaklava. From this place they had a good sight
of Sebastopol; and here, like Richard I., who got within a
short distance of Jerusalem, but was unable to enter it,
Marshal St. Arnaud, who commanded the French army,
was obliged, by sickness, to leave for France, his goal in
view.

The armies then prepared for besieging Sebastopol in due
form. An opinion, almost amounting to a general one,
prevails, that the allies ought to have taken advantage of
the panic created among the Russians by their defeat upon
603

the Alma, and have immediately proceeded against Sebastopol.
We will not presume to say they certainly ought to
have done so, but the calamities of the winter proved greater
than any losses they would have sustained by such a spirited
attack; and when we glance back at the
captains
of whom
it has been âour hint to speak,â we do not see one who
would not have made the bold attempt. The allied generals
seemed to forget that whilst they were making preparations,
they were affording opportunities for the enemy to effect
much greater, because the latter were at home.

On the night of the 10th of October the British troops
broke ground before Sebastopol, fifteen days after they had
by a brilliant and daring march on Balaklava obtained a
magnificent position on the heights which envelope Sebastopol
on the south side, from the sea to the Tchernaya.
And here again the advantage of being
at home
was evident;
the Russians immediately commenced a severe and destructive
fire, whilst the allies were not in a state to respond by
a single gun before the 17th. On that day, however, they
began with spirit. The besiegers soon found that the city
was a very different place from what they had expected, and
that they had to deal with brave, active, and persevering
enemies, always on the watch to take advantage, and
evidently commanded by skilful and enterprising officers.
All ideas of a
coup de main
were over: they had before them
a siege which would test every quality they possessed, either
as men or soldiers.

The usual routine of extensive sieges went on, sometimes
one side having the advantage, sometimes the other; the
scene being occasionally varied by splendid attacks of the
shipping. But, although the works of the allies gradually
advanced, no decisive advantage was gained: the Russians
knew the vast superiority of earthworks over every species
of fortification, and were indefatigable with the mattock and
spade. Towards the end of the month a great diminution
in the numbers of the troops began to be felt; there was a
steady drain, in one way or another, of from forty to fifty
men a day. And in this awful state they had great cause
of complaint of want of most necessaries, and particularly
of the badness of the fusees, so important for their projectiles.

604

Unless ours were a volume instead of a chapter, it would
be impossible to follow the daily occurring interest of this
struggle. In no siege have the opponents been better
matched: failures, from accident, want of skill, or disparity
of numbers, were frequent on both sides; but no instance
of treachery, or deficiency of courage and endurance, disgraced
either besieged or besiegers: the triumph will be
the greater from being achieved over a brave, energetic, and
indefatigable enemy. But, whilst viewing with heartfelt
admiration and gratitude the almost superhuman exertions
and exploits of the allied troops, a sad conviction creeps into
the mind that these efforts were not always judiciously
directed; that there was a deadening paucity of that military
genius in the leaders, to which such gallant hearts
would so nobly have responded if it had existed. A disciplined
soldier is little more than a machine; in all battles
his exertions are necessarily confined to his own immediate
small sphere of action, and therefore all the courage, all the
devotion that man is capable of, must lose their due effect
if the generalâs head do not well guide the soldierâs arm.
Another chilling reflection likewise arises on reviewing the
contest: the Russians have been,
at least
, quite as well
commanded as the allies; and a despotic ruler has provided
better for the comforts of his tools than a representative
government has for those of the brave soldiers who were
fighting for its principle.

By no instance, in the course of this siege, is the want of
that indescribable something called genius more evident
than in that glorious but lamentable day of the action of
Balaklava. The firmness of the brave Scots, who stood
âshoulder to shoulder,â unshaken by such a charge as
infantry have seldom sustainedâthe charge of the heavy
brigade, worthy of the guards who once received the
command to âup and at âemââwere eclipsed by the
desperate onslaught of the light cavalry, which has secured
immortality to the brave devotedness of British soldiers.
But why were these invaluable lives sacrificed? Why, when
every one of such men was worth a host, were these heroes
âhoundedâ on to death, as a spectacle before two armies?
The fault was not in the brave men, it was not in their
officers; but, as fault there was, it must have been somewhere.
605

We can fancy a Murat, the first
sabreur
in Europe,
in the place of Lord Cardigan; we can believe that with
the eye and judgment of a general, relying on his reputation,
he might have refused to perform such a palpable and
wanton sacrifice; but Lord Cardigan had not the reputation
of a Murat to fall back upon; he is a rich nobleman, commanding
a regiment for his amusement, and not a soldier of
fortune who has gained his rank by his meritorious deeds.
With the same spirit with which he would have accepted a
personal challenge he led on his men to the charge; but
that is not the spirit to which the fate of nations should be
intrusted in the battle-field: great captains have not unfrequently
obtained honour by remonstrance against rash
orders, and sometimes by disobeying them altogether. But,
whether the fault of the charge lies with Captain Nolan,
Lord Lucan, or Lord Cardigan, we never can conceive how
the order for it could have emanated from a general who was
so placed as to have the position to be attacked, with its
defences and defenders, all before his eyes as in a panorama!
Whispers had permeated the armies that our light cavalry
had not maintained the character it upon all occasions
assumed; such feelings are common in large hosts, but no
general should consent for the sake of jealous rumours to
sacrifice one of the most efficient arms under his command.

Lamentable as was this affair, the day of Balaklava was,
on the whole, advantageous to the besiegers; the purpose
of the enemy to remove us from a most eligible position was
defeated, and they had such âa taste of our qualityâ as
taught them to respect, if not to fear us. The worst result
was the awful diminution of a force in which we were
before but too weak: of our brave cavalry, 387 were killed,
wounded, or missing; and of horses, 520.

Very strangely, the Russians claimed as a great victory
their taking of the guns of the redoubts from the poor terrified
Turks; and, in their pride of heart, made, the next day,
an attack, with 5,000 men, upon our right flank; but they
were repulsed by the division under Sir De Lacy Evans,
with the loss of 500 men.

The work in the trenches now became very trying to the
men. From the first, the British army was deficient in
numbers for such an undertaking. Severe labour, change
606

of climate, unusual exposure exhausted them. The French,
from their numbers, made more progress in the works, and
our men were overtasked by an endeavour to keep pace
with them. The guns, too, became shaky, from continual
use. In this arm the Russians excelled us: their guns
could bear much more frequent firing, from the excellence
of the iron of which they are composed.

This is the first war in which the rifle has been employed
to any extent, but its merits became so fully appreciated,
that we have no doubt it will be generally adopted, and the
soldier, instead of firing at random, will be trained so as to
throw no ball away.

One feature of the Russian character has been very prominent
in this great struggleâa brutal want of humanity.
They partake of the attribute of their eastern origin, in the
little value they attach to the lives of their own troops,
provided they gain their end; and they have no particle of
mercy for a fallen foe. In the
mÃªlÃ©e
, arising from the rash
Balaklava charge, they hurled the bolts of their artillery,
indiscriminately on friends and enemies; and, after all contests,
it was their invariable habit to bayonet the wounded
French and English.

By the 30th of October, the position of the allies was rendered
very much worse by the closing in upon them of the
Russians in their rear. They might be said to be as much
besieged in their lines as their enemies were in Sebastopol.
But the sea is the Englishmanâs constant source of comfort
and relief; the port of Balaklava was theirs, and the sea on
that side was free to them. The Russians removed every
combustible part from their houses and buildings, so that,
with the exception of flesh and blood, the allies had nothing
to fire against but stone walls and mounds of earth. The
most keen and active deer-stalker or chamois-hunter could
not be more cunningly and anxiously on the watch for a
shot than were the whole bodies of riflemen in both armies
during the long siege. Great skill was likewise acquired
in gunnery; a shot, a shell, or a rocket seemed sometimes
to drop, like magic,
Ã  point nommÃ©
.

But now, as winter approached, the troops became sensible
of the miseries of their situation, and of the culpable
neglect of those who ought to have provided for their comforts.
607

Things, which in England would have been cast to
the dunghill, became valuable, and were sold at absurd
prices: a tattered rug, 50s.; a pot of meat, 15s.; a sponge,
25s.; a half worn-out currycomb and brush, 20s.!

With bad weather, sickness, of course, increased, affecting
equally French, English, and Turks; and, until the matter
was forced upon the
authorities
at home by the Press, was
not duly attended to. But what is still more strange, men
there, upon the spot, were deaf to this imperative duty, and
the eloquent
Times
correspondent says: âThe authorities
generally treat the medical officers with cool disrespect and
indifference.â There is no portion of this siege that will
descend to posterity on the page of history with more honour
to us as a people than that displaying the ready and earnest
sympathy felt by most classes at home for our suffering
compatriots: the public voice thundered in the ears of
officials, and forced them to their duty; individual charity,
individual exertion, were instantly put forth; and woman!
constant to her character of âa ministering angel,â forsook
the home of comfort, and the bed of down, for the contaminated
atmosphere of a military hospital, and attendance by
the wounded soldierâs couch. We care not what may be
the high-sounding title of the general who shall achieve the
conquest of the Crimea, it will pale beside that of Miss
Nightingale, the leader of the Sisters of Mercy.

At this period of the siege, spies, of a bold and artful kind,
occasionally made their appearance in the allied camps. If
the commanders had read our siege of Antioch, they might
have followed the example of Bohemond: he roasted the
bodies of some dead prisoners, and made it understood that
the Crusaders served all spies in that manner; he cleared
his camp of that dangerous kind of vermin, against whom,
we must say, the allies were not sufficiently watchful. How
eloquently does a passage of Mr. Russellâs account of the
4th of November bear out our frequently-expressed conviction
of the incapacity of the leaders! He says: âWhenever
I look at the enemyâs outworks, I think of the Woolwich
butt. What good have we done by all this powder? Very
little. A few guns judiciously placed, when we first came
here, might have saved us incredible toil and labour, because
608

they would have rendered it all but impossible for the
Russians to cast up such entrenchments and works as they
have done before the open and perfectly unprotected entrance
to Sebastopol. Here has been our great, our irremediable
error.â And when we look at the bitter consequences
of that error, what can we say of the commanders
by whom it was committed? In all ethics there is nothing
so fallacious and injurious as the constantly-quoted â
De
mortuis nil nisi bonum
;â it is deceptive as to the dead, it
is disheartening to the good, and encouraging to the bad of
the living. Lord Raglan was an amiable gentleman, well-versed,
we dare say, in the routine of office; but by no means
fit to head such an enterprise against such an enemy. But
was not all the English policy, at starting, of this do-nothing
character?

Of the same complexion was the disregard to Sir De Lacy
Evansâ repeated representation of the insecurity of the position
of the flank of the second division. But if the British
general was deaf, the Russian commander was not blind,
and this led to the attack which brought on the glorious
battle of Inkermannâglorious to our brave troops, but
certainly not creditable to the precaution of their commander.
The Russian generals, on the contrary, seem to
have exercised vast skill and discrimination. A great captain
not only considers the battle itself in his plans, he provides
for success by his preparations, and secures comparative
safety in the event of defeat. Bonaparteâs tactics in that
respect were his ruin: he said a general should think of
nothing but conqueringâso that whenever he was beaten,
he never knew how to make a retreat. The Russian plans
of attack were as perfect as possible, and nothing but the
indomitable courage of our troops could have prevented their
carrying into effect their threat of compelling us to raise the
siege and driving us into the sea. Well-laid plans, brave
men, in overwhelming numbers, immense artillery, superstition
and brandy, with the presence of royalty, were all put
in force against British strength, devotedness and courage,âand
all failed. âThe Battle of Inkermann,â says its historian,
âadmits of no description. It was a series of dreadful
deeds of daring, of sanguinary hand-to-hand fights, of
609

despairing rallies, of desperate assaults,âin glens and
valleys, in brushwood glades and remote dells, hidden from
all human eyes, and from which the conquerors, Russian or
British, issued only to engage fresh foes, till our old supremacy
in the use of the bayonet, so rudely assailed in this
fight, was triumphantly asserted, and the battalions of the
Czar gave way before our steady courage and the chivalrous
fire of France.â The Russians fought with desperation,
constantly bayonetting the wounded as they fell. They
had orders, likewise, to aim at every mounted officerâthence
the death of generals Cathcart and Strangways, and the
number of killed and wounded officers of rank: Sir George
Brown was among the latter.

The battle was wonâbut what again says the historian?
âA heavy responsibility rests on those whose neglect
enables the enemy to attack us where we were least prepared
for it, and whose indifference led them to despise precautions
which, taken in time, might have saved us many
valuable lives, and have trebled the loss of the enemy, had
they been bold enough to have assaulted us behind intrenchments.
We have nothing to rejoice over, and almost everything
to deplore, in the battle of Inkermann. We have
defeated the enemy indeed, but have not advanced one step
nearer towards the citadel of Sebastopol. We have abashed,
humiliated, and utterly routed an enemy strong in numbers,
in fanaticism, and in dogged resolute courage, and animated
by the presence of a son of him whom they deem Godâs
vicegerent on earth; but we have suffered a fearful loss,
and we are not in a position to part with one man.â In
this grand struggle 45,000 Russians were engaged, and
their artillery was relieved no less than four times. The
MiniÃ© rifle performed wonders on this day.

Sir De Lacy Evans was very unwell on board ship, but
revived at the din of battle. He got on shore, and rode up
to the front. And there, when the fight was over, he stood
lamenting for the loss sustained by his division. One of his
aides-de-camp was killed, another wounded; of his two brigadiers,
Pennefather had a narrow escape, and Adams was
wounded:ââand there lay the spot, the weakness of which
the general had so often represented! It was enough to
make him sad!â

610

The siege of Sebastopol reminds us of the adventures of
one of Dibdinâs
sailorsâ

âBy and bye came a hurricane, I didnât much like that,

Next a battle, which made many a poor sailor lie flat;â

only the events are reversed. While the glories and the
misfortunes of the 5th of November were still tossing in the
minds or grieving the hearts of the allies, they were visited
by a terrific hurricane, which gave them a complete foretaste
of what they were to undergo during the winter. We would
fain give our readers an extract of the sufferings endured by
the armies; but, alas! we
condensers
are obliged to be satisfied
with serving up dry facts,âwe are not allowed space for
anything that is interesting. And yet, in this case, we have
nothing but our own dull labour to regret, as the exciting
story is familiar to every Englishman or woman. We take
this opportunity of begging our readers to place our omission
of the various incidents of the siege to the same account:
they would fill a volume, as sorties, attacks, bombardments,
shelling, and rocket-flying were constantly going on:âbut
we are confined to a few pages. The sufferings of the men
overworked in the trenches were extreme; and, sorry are we
to say, the neglect of the âauthoritiesâ still continued as
reprehensible as ever. But the presents from their
home

friends began to arrive, and the relief from the â
Times

fundâ was extensive.

At the end of September the siege was practically suspended.
All the troops had to do was to defend the trenches
at night, and return shot for shot whenever the enemy fired;
the Russians, in the meanwhile, taking advantage of every
temporary lull to increase their internal defences.

âRain and misery everywhereâthe fortifications of
Sebastopol strengthenedâprivations of the armyâscarcity
of foodâimpassability of the roadsâdisasters the results of
apathy and mismanagementâindescribable horrors of the
town and hospitals of Balaklavaâthe camp a wilderness of
mudâpictures of dirt and woeâthe Slough of Despondâmisery
effaces the distinctions of rankâpainful reflectionsâmortality
among the Turksâmode of burialâattempted
surprises and skirmishesâdismal prospects.â Such are the
heads of two chapters of the historian we follow,âand what
more can we add to them? Are they not sufficiently
611

eloquent? Do they not tell the story completely? And
among all this, winter set in with severity: they had no
means of getting up the huts sent them; it was as much as
every man could do to provide his food. Some of the warm
clothing sent from England went down in the
Prince
, some
was burnt in a ship at Constantinople, and lighters full of
warm great-coats for the men were left to be saturated with
wet in the port of Balaklava, because no one would receive
them without orders. Such an army, and in such a situation,
was to be left to die of misery from âetiquetteâ and
âservice regulations.â âNo one would take responsibility
upon himself, if it were to save the lives of hundreds.â

With Christmas came little Christmas cheer or Christmas
merrimentâneither Christmas-boxes nor New Yearâs gifts.
They went from England, but the army did not receive
them at the appointed season or in the hour of need.
Whilst friends were despatching more than warm wishes to
the Crimea, the âill-fated army was melting awayâdissolved
in rain. On the 2nd of January, there were 3,500 sick in
the British army before Sebastopol, and it is not too much
to say that their illness was, for the most part, caused by
hard work in bad weather, and by exposure to wet without
any adequate protection.â The Russians not only opened
their new year on the 12th of January with the usual ringing
of bells and other gaieties, but with a tremendous cannonade
and a spirited sortie. They were, however, expected, and
were vigorously repulsed and driven back close to the town;
so close, indeed, that had the allies been in sufficient force
upon the point, they might have entered with them.

At this inclement season the Cossacks, in sheepskin coats
and fur caps, mounted on their rough, wiry ponies, with deal
lances and coarse iron tips, were much better able to keep
their piquet-watch than our cavalry. Though brilliant in
their charges throughout the campaign, our cavalry certainly
played a more subordinate part than was expected of
them. Before the introduction of railway travelling, we
used to think the English, as a nation, the best horsemen in
the world, though we never thought our military seat comparable
with a Yorkshire seat; but this is an irrelevant
questionâbeyond the famous charges, our cavalry are certainly
not prominent in this great yearâs campaign.

612

On the 19th of January, the historian of the war makes
this striking remark: âExcept Lord Raglan, Lord Lucan,
and Sir R. England, not one of our generals now remain of
those who came out here originally: the changes among our
brigadiers and colonels have been almost as greatâall the
rest have been removed from the army by wounds, sickness,
or deathâand so it is of the men.â What an eloquent and
sorrowful comment is this upon the severity of the service!
Would that we could say that was the only cause! Did we
indulge in a description of the horrors of hospital and camp,
we should leave no room for the glorious triumph.

The superior resources of the French, as regarded numbers,
began now to be felt; ground was gradually relinquished
to them, and the front, which it cost the British so
much strength and health to maintain, was necessarily
abandoned to the more numerous and less exhausted army.
The French received reinforcements continually, whilst we,
alas! were not dwindling, but being swept away: the grave
and the hospital swallowed our brave men by thousandsâbetween
the 1st of December and the 20th of January
8,000 sick and wounded men were sent down from camp to
Balaklava, and thence on shipboard!âfrom the battle of
Inkermann to this period, 1,000 men of the brigade of guards
had been âexpended, absorbed, used up, and were no more
seen!â

Every night was enlivened with a skirmish, and with
sharp-shooting behind the parapets, and in the broken
ground between the lines. The Russians, throughout, had
plenty of men, with a superabundance of
matÃ©riel
âwe have
not space for a hundredth part of the cannonades, bombardments,
fusillades, sharp-shooting, sorties, and all kinds of
annoyances kept up by the enemy: in justice, it must be
said, that no place was ever more earnestly, actively, and
bravely defended. With the exception of a few instances
of ferocious brutality, the Russians have proved an enemy
worthy of our best and most valiant exertions.

Towards the middle of February, the earthworks on both
sides had been so nearly perfected, that even the bombardment
from mortars of great size produced but little apparent
effect. The Russian force, in rear of the allies, was now
estimated at 35,000 men: the allies were completely besieged;
613

but âthe sea, the seaâ did not allow its brave rulers
to perish.

At this time Lord Lucan was recalled; upon which circumstance
we will not venture a comment, for fear of being
seduced into a long discussion.

As soon as the 21st of February, the allies became aware
of the immense labours being carried on by the Russians in
the north division of the city, on the other side of the
harbour. There were not less than 3,000 men employed in
the works, and the correspondent of the
Times
then foretold
the exact purpose for which they were preparing: they
were securing themselves a place of retreat. They received
almost boundless supplies, without the allies being apparently
able to hinder them.

This siege was not unmarked by some of those occasional
intercourses which teach men that, although opposed in
deadly strife, they are human creatures. Now and then an
hourâs truce, for the purpose of burying the dead, brought
Russian officers out of the town, and civilities were exchanged.
But there was certainly something
rusÃ©
in the
demeanour of these gentlemen, and doubtless the most
observant were selected for the
duty
. There was nothing
of that heartiness of mutual respect which has, upon similar
occasions, distinguished French and English officers.

The railway, between Balaklava and the camp, now began
to be in operation, and was a source of intense wonderment
to the Cossack piquets.

The rifle-pits, which are no novelty in siege warfare, next
became the objects of constant struggle. They were simple
excavations in the ground, in front and to the right and left
of the Malakoff tower, about six hundred yards from the
works of the allies. They were faced round with sand-bags,
loop-holed for rifles, and banked up with earth thrown from
the pits. They were, in fact, little forts or redoubts, to act
against the besiegers, armed with rifles instead of cannon.
Each could contain ten men, and there were six of them.
They were so well protected and covered by the nature of
the ground, that neither English rifleman nor French sharp-shooter
could touch them. Some of the severest fighting of
the siege took place for the possession of these pits, which
were peculiar objects of French interest, as being in front
614

of their lines. On the 22nd of March our brave allies
obtained three of these important holes, and immediately
commenced a sharp fusilade against the Mamelon and Round
Tower, from the sand-bags.

Towards the end of March, a happy change was effected
for the besiegers: food became plentiful, and camp comforts
were even superabundant; the officers were absolutely
oppressed by the
woolly
kindnesses of their fair countrywomen,
particularly as the ground was covered with crocusses
and hyacinths, and the weather began to âwax
warm.â

On the 9th of April, the long-expected second bombardment
was opened simultaneously by the allies upon the
defences of Sebastopol, amidst wind and torrents of rain,
with an atmosphere so thick, that even the flashes of the
guns were invisible. They were warmly responded to by
the Russians.âRepeated complaints of the fusees of the
British. By the 18th, however, the fire slackened on both
sides: each seemed glad to avail themselves of a little
respite.

On the 19th,
a grande reconnaissance
was made by the
Turkish forces, assisted by the English and French. It
was a picturesque march, answered all the intended purpose,
and was a great relief to the monotony of the siege.
Contests were daily and nightly taking place, each worthy
of being made episodes in a great poem. âDeeds of derring-do,â
of firm courage and devotion, were enacted in numbers
by officers and men: the contest on both sides was truly
âa strife of heroes;â but it must be left to the bards of
future ages.

In these awful circumstances, the British army had again
to complain of the
authorities
, whilst
funds
and individuals
were sending stores of comforts they did not now want: the
brave fellows were badly off for shells and fusees:ââthere
were no fusees for such shells as they had, and plenty of
fusees for such shells as they had not.â

The French lines were now within a few hundred yards
of the Mamelon, and our advanced parallel inclined towards
the Round Tower. The progress was steady, but it was
dearly bought: the Russians contested every inch of ground
bravely.

615

The abortive Kertch expedition took place early in May,
and was said to result in nothing, from orders unfortunately
received from Paris. The chagrin of Sir Edmund Lyons was
so great as to produce illness. When this great siege shall
take its due place in the page of history, bright will be the
renown of this noble specimen of a British sailor. But for
Sir Edmund Lyons, we might look throughout this war in
vain for the successors to our Blakes and Nelsonsâfor the
commanders of the true arm of our nation. Jack,âimmortal
Jack! has well maintained his character for dauntless
courage, kindness of heart, devotedness, and whimsicality;
but what is become of the race that used to lead him through
âthe battle and the breeze?ââwith the exception of Sir
Edmund Lyons, echo answers, âWhere?â All honour to
him!âa grateful peopleâs honour!

The Russian night-attacks were more frequent, but they
were, in all cases, repulsed with loss, although well planned
and bravely carried out. The principal disadvantage to the
British arose from the havoc made among their best soldiers;
the bravest would go to the front, and were the first
victims. Races and cricket matches were got upâbut,
after a few trials, died out. The gallant troops tried all
they could to keep up their spirits; but the real game going
on was too serious.

On the 16th of May the allies were delighted by a welcome
reinforcement. The Sardinian troops began to arrive;
and, in addition to the gratification derived from such a
circumstance, they were surprised by their warlike and
splendid appearance. It was something new to the weather-beaten
warriors, to see troops so newly and handsomely
equipped.

By the middle of this month the army became sensible of
a deficiency which we, who are fresh from the study of
Eastern sieges, had always dreaded: they were short of
water, and that for an army of men and horses is a calamity
a thousand times worse than a deluge of rain. They were
put to some inconvenience; but Artesian wells, and supplies
from the fleet, prevented the want from being severely felt.

On the 22nd of May started the second expedition to
Kertch, which was attended with complete success. The
command of the British contingent was intrusted to Sir
616

George Brown, Sir Edmund Lyons leading the naval forces.
All was glorious, all was easy, and all appeared well conducted.
The forts were forced, the magazines were exploded
by the Russians themselves; but all their guns, with a prodigious
quantity of corn, grain, munitions of war, naval
stores and military equipments, fell into the hands of the
allies. This triumph was stained by great excesses, but
these were attributed to Tartars, Turks, merchant-seamen,
and others of the usual followers of such expeditions:
the French and English regular troops claim to be exonerated
from this stain,âwe hope justly.

A squadron was sent into the Sea of Azoff, the success of
which was signal. Within four days they destroyed 245
Russian vessels employed in carrying provisions to the
Russian army in the Crimea, many of them large, and fully
equipped and laden. Magazines were destroyed containing
more than seven million rations. Arabat was bombarded,
and the powder-magazine blown up. At Kertch the enemy
destroyed upwards of 4,000,000 lbs. of corn and 500,000 lbs.
of flour. These articles should be all remembered when we
are summing up the immense sacrifices Russia has made in
this war.

An expedition to Anapa was planned and prepared; but
the Russians, very perplexingly, saved us the trouble. They,
on most occasions, carry out the system they adopted in
their war with Buonaparte: they prefer destroying their own
cities and stores to allowing their enemies the honour of
doing it. âWe have inflicted great ruin on the enemy, but
they have emulated our best efforts in destroying their own
settlements.â

After these events there was a lullâthe siege seemed to
stand still. There was a little occasional fighting, but the
French were constantly advancing their works. The
Russians seemed particularly idle, as regarded us, and yet
it could be seen that they were assiduously employed in
strengthening and provisioning the fortress on the north
side.

This quiet, however, was soon over. On the 6th of June,
for the third time, the fire of the allies was opened along
the whole range of positions; the thunders of 157 British
guns and mortars, and above 300 on the side of the French
617

awakened the echoes, and hurled their bolts against Sebastopol.
âLike greyhounds in the slips,â the two armies, who
felt their strength, were eager and anxious for the decisive
struggle. The advantages gained by the fleet, wonderfully
increased the confidence of the troops.

On the 7th of June, our brave attack upon the Quarrries
came off, and our heroic allies, the French, made their
immortal capture of the Mamelon. The British succeeded
in taking and retaining the Quarries, but had to sustain six
attacks of the Russians, who fought not only bravely, but
with desperation. We wish we could afford space for the
details of the taking of the Mamelon by the French, as
nothing but details can do it justice; but we must content
ourselves with saying, that complete as the success was,
never was success more richly deserved. We doubt whether
history can furnish a more exciting scene than the conflict
for this important post; great was the glory, but dear the
price paid for it! Had we had a larger body in reserve, it was
the general opinion that the Redan would have shared the fate
of the Quarries. When we recollect what this fortress cost us
on the memorable 8th of September, we have additional cause
to lament the miserable want of generalship so often occurring
in this siege. The men were equal to anything, but there
was no military star of genius to lead them on. The loss,
on all sides, was very great. The next day the Russians
solicited a truce, to bury the dead. This truce disappointed
the troops, as it was believed both the Redan and the
Malakoff Tower might have been captured. It is not unlikely
that there was more policy than humanity in the
Russian request, for, before the truce of a few hours was
ended, these posts were strongly reinforced. The French
immediately made every exertion to fortify their acquisition;
but the retention of the Mamelon and the Quarry, though
exceedingly important, was not a very easy matter. The
Russians were, perhaps, more aware of their value than we
were. A flag of truce came out of the harbour to request
the allied commanders not to fire on certain ships, as they
were converted into hospitals. This, although complied
with, was by many thought to be a ruse to save the ships.

On the 18th was made the unsuccessful attack upon the
Malakoff and Redan. This was preceded by a hail of shot
618

and shells to an amazing amount, beneath which the Russian
fire grew weak and wild. The French obtained possession
of the Malakoff, but were unable to hold it. This was a
disastrous affair, producing heavy loss and depression of
spirits. Let those who idly talk of war, and over their libations
sing of its triumphs and victories, study the picture
given by the wonderfully-graphic correspondent of the

Times
of the effects of this bravely-carried-out attemptâto
think of them is sufficient to penetrate the hardest heart:
we cannot dwell upon them.

This was followed by a kind of tacit suspension of hostilitiesâboth
sides were âsupped full with horrors;â humanity
resumed its empire, and mournful thoughts and bitter
reflections displaced the madness of strife and visions of
glory.

It has been our painful task, in the course of our short
narrative, whilst with pride attempting to do justice to the
bravery of our gallant troops, to comment severely upon the
conduct of their leaders. There is an incident related
which took place after the unsuccessful attack upon the
Malakoff, that appears to us a perfect epitome of the whole
conduct of the war, and which our national feeling would
not allow us to repeat, if there were not mixed with it high
honour, as well as imbecility. The taking of the Cemetery
was the only trophy of the great attack, and that, if properly
followed up, might have been of incalculable advantage;
the cost of it was dear in brave hearts and strong
arms. Mr. Russell does not hesitate to say: âAnd this we
should have abandoned from the
timidity
of one of our
generals. It was left to a general of division to say what
should be done with the Cemetery,
and he gave orders to
abandon it
. On the following morning, Lieutenant Donnelly,
an officer of engineers, hears, to his extreme surprise, that
the position for which we had paid so dearly was not in our
possession. He appreciated its value; he saw that the
Russians had not yet advanced to reoccupy it. With the
utmost zeal and energy he set to work among the officers of
the trenches, and begged and borrowed some thirty men,
with whom he crept down into the Cemetery just before the
flag of truce was hoisted. As soon as the armistice began,
the Russians flocked down to the Cemetery, which they
619

supposed to be undefended, but, to their great surprise, they
found our thirty men posted there as sentries, who warned
them back, and in the evening the party was strengthened,
and we are now constructing most valuable works and batteries
there.â Far, far be it from us to harbour a thought
or utter a wish inimical to free institutions or representative
governments, but there are times when the will of one
strong mind will work more nobly than official routine:
Mahomet II. would have reversed matters hereâthe general
and the lieutenant would have changed places.

The apparent rest, but real secret activity of both parties,
was at first painfully broken in the British camp by the
death of General Estcourt, the Adjutant-general of the
army, which was quickly followed by that of the Commander-in-chief.
Lord Raglan was too old, and too little accustomed
to field-work and anxiety of mind to sustain the post
he was placed in. Forty yearsâ life of a British nobleman,
in an official situation, could not have prepared him for a
struggle which would have taxed the energies of his master
in his prime. Kind-hearted, amiable and gentlemanly, we
believe him to have been, but these were scarcely the
qualities to be pitted against Russian ambition, artifices,
energies, and dogged courage, or to enable him, at an
advanced age, to contend with a climate, exposure, fatigue,
and privations to which he had never been accustomed.
Lord Raglan must have been more conscious than anybody
else of his unfitness for the trying post he occupied: the
better the man the more likely was he to suffer from this
feeling. It was the failure at the Malakoff, more than
disease, that terminated the career of one of whom we can
speak with more pride as an English gentleman than as a
great English general.

But the great end began to approach; it had been bought
dearly, but it loomed above the horizon. Supplies of men and
material were constantly arriving in the Allied camp, nor
can it be said that their powerful enemy relaxed his efforts
in these respects; but, however protected by earthworks,
walls cannot endure battering for ever. With their hosts
of sappers, the French made daily approaches to mining
the principal fortifications, and in July, the Russian commander
became so aware of the peril of his situation, that
620

he informed his Government he could not hold the city
much longer. The Court of St. Petersburgh appeared to
be desperate rather than prudently firm, and ordered the
rash assault to be made on the lines of the Tchernaya, in
the hope of compelling the allies to raise the siege, and of
once more regaining Balaklava. We have had cause to
wonder, throughout the siege, at the number of guns and
the abundance of all kinds of warlike munitions that were
at the command of the Russians. But the capture of
Sebastopol has greatly diminished this feeling; for that city
may be thought to have been constantly receiving stores in
order to carry out the project of taking Constantinople, ever
since it was conceived by Peter, and cherished by Catherine
II. Instead of a fortified city at the remote boundary
of a great empire, it was like the metropolitan arsenal of
that empire. The Russians then put forth their energies
in one more desperate attack. But the position was too
strong and too well defended. The battle of the Tchernaya
was entirely in favour of the allies; not only physically but
morally, for their prestige of victory was well supported;
the Russians were forced to retire back to the heights on
either side of Mackenzieâs farm.

The next fortnight Prince Gortschakoff may be said to
have devoted to providing for the safety of his army. He
had great reason to fear the next bombardment would be
fatal; he established a means of communication between
the battered ruins of the South side of Sebastopol and that
North side upon which so much labour and time had been
expended; he built a strong raft-bridge across the harbour,
threw up earthworks along the cliff to protect it, and drew
his army together in compact lines between the sea and
the heights of Mackenzie.

On the 5th of September the awful catastrophe was
entered upon. All was preparation with both besiegers and
besieged; the former girding up their loins for the great
struggle, the latter doing all that could be done to meet it
manfully. General Pellissier had had a long interview with
General Simpson the preceding day, in which, no doubt, the
plan of attack was settled.

The French began by exploding three
fougasses
(small
mines, shaped like wells), to blow in the counterscarp and
621

serve as a signal to their men. âInstantly, from the sea to
the Dockyard-creek there seemed to run a stream of fire,
and fleecy, curling, rich, white smoke, as though the earth
had been suddenly rent in the throes of an earthquake, and
was vomiting forth the material of her volcanoes.â This
iron storm made awful havoc on the works and in the city;
in its terrible course it âswept the Russian flanks, and
searched their centre to the core.â âSuch a volley,â says
the historian and eye-witness, âwas probably never before
uttered since the cannon found its voice.â It paralysed the
Russians, and was well described by their General as
un feu
dâenfer
(an infernal or hellish fire); the batteries were not
prepared to respond to such a destructive and appalling
attack. But it was no temporary spirt with the French;
they kept to their guns with astonishing energy, rapidity,
and strength, filling the very air with the murderous hail
poured upon the enemy; there were more than 200 pieces
of artillery of large calibre, admirably served and well-directed,
playing incessantly on the hostile lines. The stone
walls were like houses of card before this tempest, but the
huge mounds of earth seemed quietly to ingulf all the
missiles that could be hurled against them. For a short
time the Russians were either so astonished or unprepared,
that they made no reply; but at length recovering, their
artillerymen went to work. Mr. Russell says, âThey fired
slowly and with precision, as if they could not afford to
throw away an ounce of powder;â but the immense stores
of the âvillainous saltpetreâ found in Sebastopol, prove
that could not have been the cause of their slackness. As
such a circumstance was sure to act upon generous natures,
the Russian reply only animated the French to additional
exertions; their shot flew along the lines of the defences
and bounded among the houses with incredible rapidity.
During this magnificently-awful scene the British, in their
siege-train or in their famous Naval Brigade, were satisfied
with pounding away, at their usual pace, at the Malakoff
and Redan, but certainly rendered their brave allies some
assistance by their shell practice from the Creek to the
Redan. The want of unanimity in the attacks is unintelligible:
in this last chapter of the great work in the carrying
out of which we had been so energetic, and which had
622

cost us so much, we seemed doomed not to have our share
of honour; although we were fully prepared, in every way,
to support it creditably. The French commander, with
characteristic warmth, perhaps, confident in his numbers
and means, thought best to begin alone; and yet this
conclusion scarcely agrees with the excellent understanding
and regard to each otherâs reputation which had subsisted
between the two armies. Unfortunately our General Jones,
who directed the siege works, was laid up with a severe
attack of rheumatism.

The Russian works began to display a most dilapidated
appearance. They had been finished off in an almost ornamental
style, but they now looked ragged; the parapets were
pitted with shot and shell, and the sides of the embrasures were
considerably injured. After two hours and a half of furious
firing, the French suddenly ceased, to cool their guns and
rest the men. This moment of peace the poor Russians
employed in repairing, as fast as they could, their damaged
works; but their gunners took âheart of grace,â and
opened an attack upon our sailorsâ battery and âthe
crowâs nest.â With another explosion of fougasses, the
French resumed operations with a still fiercer fire than
before, and continued it till twelve oâclock at noon, by which
time the Russians had only a few guns to reply with. The
English from their camp could see them, in great agitation,
sending men across the bridge and back again, and at nine
oâclock a powerful body of infantry crossed over, in expectation
of the attack of the allies; other troops were afterwards
brought back, evidently from the same fear. From
twelve till five the firing was slack; but then it seemed to
revive with greater fury from the comparative lull, and
never ceased pouring in shot and shell till half-past seven,
when all the mortars and heavy guns, English as well as
French, with the darkness, opened with shell against the
whole line of defences. We can fancy the sight now beheld
can be compared to nothing but a tropical thunder-storm,
or to one of those autumnal spectacles of aÃ«rolites, which
astronomers and meteorologists describe so vividly. âThere
was not one instant in which the shells did not whistle
through the airânot a moment in which the sky was not
seamed by their fiery curves or illuminated with their
623

explosion.â The British had gained great skill in their
practice, and every shell seemed to fall exactly
Ã  point
nommÃ©.
The Russians scarcely attempted a reply. At five
oâclock, in the evening, a frigate in the second line, near the
north side, was perceived to be on fire. These ships had
been a great source of annoyance to the allies; and the rising
flames were hailed with shouts and congratulations. The
cause of this conflagration was doubtful. The burning
vessel was not only an object of interest, it was a splendid
spectacle.

All night a steady fire was kept up to prevent the
Russians repairing their damages. Orders were sent to
the English batteries to open next morning with dawn;
but, alas! they were limited to fifty rounds each.âWhy,
oh! why was this?âAt half-past five
A.M.
the whole of the
batteries, from Quarantine to Inkermann, opened with one
grand crash. As before, the Russians were comparatively
silent. The cannonade was continued for about the same
period as the preceding day. Several gallant officers had
fallen on the 5th. The attention of the Russians seemed
more than ever directed to the north side; but they kept
large masses of men in the town. The bombardment continued
all night.

With the rising of the sun the cannonade was resumed.
A council of generals was held at head-quarters; the sick
were cleared out of the field-hospitals; and it was confidently
whispered that the assault would take place next day
at twelve oâclock. The fire was kept up with the same
intensity all day. About three oâclock a two-decker was
set on fire, and burnt all night. Vessels near her were
towed away by a steamer to the dock-yard harbour, but the
lines of men-of-war remained untouched. Flames broke
out behind the Redan in the afternoon. The bombardment
was renewed at nightfall. A Sardinian corps was marched
up to reinforce the French. About eleven
P.M.
a heavy
explosion was heard in the town. The men intended for
the assault were ordered to take forty-eight hoursâ provision,
cooked, with them into the trenchesâall was preparation,
and feverish anxiety prevailed, even in the stoutest
hearts.

It has been observed that the Russians generally indulged
624

in a
siesta
at twelve oâclock, and that hour was fixed upon
for the assault; but the intended surprise was considerably
lessened by the British general ordering the cavalry regiment
up to the front. This injudicious movement evidently
excited the suspicions of the Russians, who, besides, must
have expected the extraordinary cannonade and bombardment
were the precursors of a general assault.

General Pellissier during the night collected about
30,000 men in and about the Mamelon, who were reinforced
by 5,000 Sardinians. It was arranged that the
French were to attack the Malakoff and Little Redan about
noon, and that the British were to attack the Redan at the
same time. At half-past ten the second division and the
light division of the English were moved down to the
trenches, and placed in the advanced parallels as quietly
as possible. About the same time, General Simpson moved
down to the second parallel of the Green Hill Battery.

The French had brought their sap close to the Malakoff,
and, at a few minutes before twelve, issued in masses from
their
place dâarmes
, swarmed up the face of the Malakoff,
and passed through the embrasures like thought. From
their proximity, they had but seven metres to cross to reach
their enemy. Column after column poured through the
embrasures, and scarcely had the head of their column
cleared the ditch when their tricolor floated over the Korniloff
Bastion. The French had evidently taken the Russians
by surprise, but they soon recovered themselves, and fought
manfully to expel the intruders. Glorious was the struggle
made by the French to hold their prey; and, fortunately,
they were commanded by a general who understood the importance
of the acquisition, and did not desert them. While
the main body of the French attacked the Malakoff, another
division was to attack the Redan of Careening Bay, and a
third was to march against the Curtain, which unites these
extreme points. General Bosquet commanded a strong
division, to support these. The English were to attack the
Great Redan, by scaling it at its salient. General Salles,
strengthened by a body of Sardinians, was to make a lodgment
in the town, if circumstances permitted. Admirals
Lyons and Bruat were likewise expected to make a powerful
diversion, but the state of the sea prevented their leaving
625

their anchorage. The English and French mortar-boats,
however, did good service.

After a terrible hand-to-hand struggle, McMahonâs division
succeeded in making a footing in front of the Malakoff,
notwithstanding the storm of projectiles poured upon them
by the Russians. The Redan of Careening Bay, after
having been occupied, was obliged to be evacuated, in consequence
of being exposed to a cross fire, and the fire of the
steamers. But another French division held a portion of
the Curtain, and McMahonâs division kept gaining ground
in the Malakoff,
General Bosquet pouring in reserves, by the
order of General Pelissier
.

The Malakoff being the principal object, when the French
general perceived that it was safe, he gave the signal agreed
upon to General Simpson to attack the Redan. Why
General Simpson should thus have abandoned the British
share in the great triumph, we are at a loss to guess. In
every toil and danger of the war, the English had taken
more than their part, because they had not sufficient numbers
to keep pace with their brave allies in the works, and
their men had been obliged to work double. From the
closeness of their trenches to the Malakoff, from the immense
numbers of men they poured in at once and continued
to supply, the conquest of the Malakoff was not so severe
and trying a task as the British attack upon the Redan,
although, from the magnitude of the fort, the cost of life
was enormous.

Convinced that the capture of the Malakoff was all that
was to be wished, the French general would not allow a
further waste of good men to be made, by persisting in the
other attacks by his troops.

But the Malakoff was not yet safe: General Bosquet
was struck by a large fragment of a shell, and was obliged
to give his command to General Dulac. A powder-magazine
in the curtain, near the Malakoff, blew up, and serious
consequences were apprehended.

Hoping to profit by the accident, the Russians advanced
in dense masses, and in three columns, and attacked the
centre, left, and right of the Malakoff. But they were prepared
for within the work. McMahon had troops he could
depend on; and after, as their own general says, six desperate
626

attempts, the Russians were compelled to beat a
retreat. From that moment they relinquished any offensive
attack: the Malakoff was taken, past fear of recapture. It
was then four oâclock in the afternoon.âA few short sentences
thus tell the result of the contest for this key of
the fortifications; but the fact can only be duly appreciated
by reflecting that
seven thousand
brave men were sacrificed
in it on the part of the French, and as many, no doubt, on
the part of the enemy. War and its horrors were never
duly painted till they came under the eye of Mr. Russell;
his picture of the hospital of St. Paul throws all the terrific
scenes of Dante into shade.

We now proceed to a portion of our story in which
Englishmen, we are grieved to the heart to say, can take no
pride. Never did an army go through the fatigues and
dangers of a campaign with more courage, more devotion,
more firmness, or more patient endurance; and at the last
to be cut off from partaking of the great honour of the
closing triumph, is disheartening to their future endeavours,
and a source of deep regret to their countrymen at home.

At a few minutes past twelve the British left the fifth
parallel. The enemyâs musketry commenced at once, and
in less than five minutes, during which they had to pass
over two hundred yards, from the nearest approach to the
parapet of the Redan, they had lost a large portion of their
officers, and were deprived of the aid of their leaders, with
the exception of acting Brigadier-general Windham, and
Captains Fyers, Lewis, and Maude: the rest had been
struck down by the volleys of grape and rifle balls which
swept the flanks of the work towards the salient. As they
came nearer, the enemyâs fire became less fatal. They
crossed the abattis without much trouble: it was torn to
pieces by our shot; the men stepped over and through it
with ease. The light division made straight for the salient
and projecting angle of the Redan, and came to the ditch,
which is about fifteen feet deep. The escalade party proceeded
to plant their ladders, but they were found too
short!âhad they not been so, they would not have been of
much use, as there were but six or seven brought to the
place. In ancient times, when men only fought hand to
hand, seven ladders have achieved wonders; but where all
627

who mounted could be swept off by musketry, such a
number was useless. But the gallant officers set their men
the example of leaping into the ditch, scrambling up the
other side, and thence getting on to the parapet with little
opposition; whilst the Russians who were in front ran back,
and opened a fire upon them from behind the traverses and
breastworks. When upon the parapet, strange and new it is
to say, the soldiers seemed bewildered; their gallant officers
cheered them on, coaxed them on, but instead of following
them, they persisted in firing, loading and firing! The
officers began to fall fast. The small party of the 90th,
much diminished, went on gallantly towards the breastwork,
but they were too weak to force it, and joined the
men of other regiments, who were keeping up a brisk fire
upon the Russians from behind the traverses. Colonel
Windham had got into the Redan with the storming party
of the light division, below the salient on the proper left
face, but all his exertions were as futile as those of the
gallant officers of the 90th, 91st, and the supporting
regiments.

As the light division rushed out in the front, they were
swept by the guns of the Barrack Battery, and other pieces
on the proper right of the Redan, loaded heavily with grape,
which thinned them grievously before they could reach the
salient or apex of the work they were to assault. The
columns of the second division issuing out of the fifth
parallel, rushed up immediately after the light division, so
as to come a little down on the slope of the proper left face
of the Redan. The first embrasure was in flames, but
running on to the next, the men leaped into the ditch, and,
with the aid of ladders and of each othersâ hands, scrambled
up on the other side, climbed the parapet, or poured in
through the embrasure which was undefended. Colonel
Windham was one of the first men in on this side. As our
men entered through the embrasures, the few Russians who
were between the salient and the breastwork retreated
behind the latter, and got from behind the traverses to its
protection. From this place they poured in a thick fire on
the parapet of the salient, which was crowded by the men
of the light division, and on the gaps through the inner
parapet of the Redan; and the British, with an infatuation
628

which all officers deplore, began to return the fire of the
enemy without advancing behind the traverses, loaded and
fired as quickly as they could, producing little effect, as the
Russians were all covered by the breastwork. Groups of
riflemen likewise kept up a galling fire from behind the
lower traverses, near the base of the Redan. As soon as
the alarm of the attack was spread, the Russians came rushing
up from the barracks, and increased the intensity of the
fire, from which the English were dropping fast, and increasing
the confidence of the enemy by their immobility.
In vain their officers by word and deed encouraged them
on; they were impressed with an idea that the Redan was
mined, and that if they advanced they should be blown up:
and yet many of them acted in a manner worthy of the
men of the Alma and Inkermann. But what availed these
few?âthey were swept down by the enemyâs fire the
moment they advanced to the front. In the same manner,
the courage of the officers only made them a mark for
the Russian fire, and they fell as soon as they advanced.
All was confusion, regiments were confounded, and men
refused to obey any but their own officers. We are at a loss
to account for the conduct of Colonel Windham, it was that of
a hero,âindeed, he is the British hero of the day; but he must
have seen that with such a handful of men his efforts were
unavailing: he gathered together one little band after another,
only to have them swept down by the enemyâs guns:
his own escape was miraculous. The men kept up a smart
fire from behind the lower parts of the inner parapet, but
no persuasion or commands could induce them to come out
into the open space and charge the breastwork. Whilst our
men were thus being terrifically thinned, the Russians
gained reinforcements, not only from the town but from the
Malakoff, which had now been abandoned to the French.
But Colonel Windham did not blench; he sent three times
to Sir E. Codrington, who was in the fifth parallel, to beg
him to send up supports, in some order of formation; but
none of his messengers reached the general in safety: all
were wounded and disabled. Supports were sent, but they
came in disorder from the fire they had to pass through, and
they were in such small numbers, that they appeared only
to be sent to feed the slaughter. Seemingly rendered
629

careless of life, the colonel passed from one dangerous position
to another, exposed to a close fire, and, wonderful to
relate, untouched, but he found the same confusion everywhereâall
firing away at the enemy from behind anything
that could screen them, but all refusing to charge. He, at
length, got some riflemen and a few men of the 88th together,
but as they did not, as he appeared to do, âbear a charmed
life,â they were no sooner out than they were swept away
like chaff: the officers, as conspicuous by their courage as
their dress, going down first. This carnage lasted an hour.
The Russians were now in dense masses behind the breastwork,
and Colonel Windham went once more back across
the open space to the left, to make another attempt to
retrieve the day. In his progress he had to pass through
the fire of his own men and the incessant volleys of the
Russians, but he still was safe. Within the inner parapet
of the left, he found the men becoming thinner and thinner.
A Russian officer stepped over the breastwork, and tore
down a gabion, to make room for a fieldpiece. Colonel
Windham exclaimed to the soldiers who were firing over the
parapet, âAs you are so fond of firing, why donât you shoot
that Russian?â They fired a volley, but all missed him;
and soon the fieldpiece began to play on the salient with
grape. Finding no time was to be lost, and seeing nothing
of his messengers, Colonel Windham determined to go
himself in quest of supports. âI
must
go to the general
for supports,â said he to Captain Crealock, of the 90th, who
happened to be near him. âBut, mind that it be known why I
went, in case I am killed.â He crossed the parapet and ditch,
and succeeded in gaining the fifth parallel, through a storm of
grape and rifle-bullets in safety. Sir Edward Codrington
asked him, if he really thought he could do any good with
such supports as he could afford him, and said he might take
the Royals, who were then in the parallel. âLet the officers
come out in frontâlet us advance in order, and if the men
keep their formation, the Redan is ours,â was the ready
reply of this truly British soldier; but the game was ended:
as he spoke, the men were seen in full flight from the Redan,
by every means of egress, followed by the Russians, who not
only bayonetted them, and shot them down with musketry,
but even threw stones and grape-shot at them. Large
630

masses of Russians, supported by grape from several field-pieces,
had poured upon the broken, confused parties of the
British, and crushed them as if beneath an avalanche.
When it came to this point, their native courage revived,
and they had recourse to their national weapon. The
struggle was desperate, but, from the numbers of the
Russians, necessarily short. Officers, only armed with
swords, had little chance in such a mÃªlÃ©e; they fell like
heroes amidst the gallant part of their men. The pursuing
Russians were soon forced to retire by the fire of the English
batteries and riflemen, and, under the cover of that, many
escaped to the approaches. General Pelissier, on becoming
aware of the failure of the English attack, sent over to General
Simpson to ask if he meant to renew it; but the British
Commander-in-Chief is reported to have said that he did
not feel in a condition to do so. The reserve was certainly
strong enough to have returned to the attack, and General
Simpson talked of making it the next morning; but the
Russians saved him the trouble.

The French had a long and severe contest in the rear of
the Malakoff, but, although they failed in the other two
attacks, they nobly maintained their footing in their grand
prize.

When the siege of Sebastopol becomes a subject of remote
history, we have no doubt that it will be viewed in this
light:âThe Malakoff Tower was known to be the key to
the place, and the capture of it was the principal object with
the allies. The French being by far in greatest numbers,
were alone able to undertake this capture, the British army
not being in a condition to sustain such a drain as the
attempt was sure to produce. But, âto make assurance
doubly sure,â diversions were necessary, and it was agreed
that the British should attack the Redan, whilst the French
attacked the Little Redan and the Curtain. These last
will all be supposed to be mere diversions, and that they fully
answered their purpose.âNow, whether the allied generals
had thus laid their plans, we will not presume to say; but
such is a very fair assumption. But Englishmen will ask,
Why were so many of our brave countrymen made
enfans
perdus
in an attack that, from beginning to end, was so
mismanaged as never to have a chance of success? To which
631

the reply will be: Your loss has certainly been grievous;
but remember, it was a common cause, and, in this attempt,
which brought about such glorious results, where you had
2,447 men placed
hors de combat
, your brave allies had
7,000. There is another circumstance that gives countenance
to this idea. In all Oriental warfare, it has been the
practice to place the worst troops in the van; they were
flogged up with whips, and pricked up with lances to meet
the enemy, whom they were supposed to fatigue and exhaust
before the
Ã©lite
of the army engaged. Now, though General
Simpson sent in to the Redan regiments of nominally great
experience and tried courage, he really sent in the rawest
part of his army; for these regiments had been so thinned
by the campaign as to contain very few of the men who
came out in them: the Guards, the Highlanders, the third
and fourth divisions were untouched. But whether they
served as
enfans perdus
, or were lost in what was meant to
be a successful attack, the friends of those who fell in this
disastrous affair must console themselves in their grief by
reflecting that no honour is lostâthe means, and the method
of employing those means, appear to have been quite inadequate
to the object in view.

However great was the triumph of the French, they
never dreamt that it would be so speedily followed by such
important consequences.

At eight oâclock, the Russians began quietly to withdraw
from the town, after having placed combustibles in every
house, with a view of making a second Moscow of Sebastopol.
With great art, the commander kept up a fire of
musketry from his advanced posts, as if he meant to endeavour
to regain the Malakoff. Before two oâclock in the
morning the fleet had been scuttled and sunk. About two
oâclock flames were observed to break out in different parts
of the town, and to spread gradually over the principal
buildings. At four, explosion followed upon explosion, and
the Flagstaff and Garden Batteries blew up; the magnificence
of the scene being heightened by the bursting of the
numberless shells contained in the magazines. During all
this time, the Russian infantry proceeded in a steady, uninterrupted
march over the bridge to the north side, so that
by six oâclock the last battalion had passed over: the south
632

side of Sebastopol was thus evacuated, and left to its persevering
and brave conquerors.

In his retreat, the Russian general, Prince Gortschakoff,
maintained the character for generalship he had so fully
earned in his defence of Sebastopol. As the place was no
longer tenable against the troops and artillery brought
against it, nothing could be better than his arrangements
for the safety of his army. He fought till the place crumbled
away beneath him, and then made a judicious retreat with
a very small loss of men. The amount of stores found in
the town, after such a contest, seems almost incredible,âthe
capture of 4,000 cannon is a thing unheard of in the
history of war.

And so far has this important siege terminated: right and
civilization have so far triumphed over wrong and barbarism;
âvaulting ambition hath oâerleaped itself,â and the arrogant
schemes of the Romanoff race have met with such a check
as must, at least, retard them for half a century. Great has
been the cost,âsevere has been the struggle,âbut, as the
cause is holy, let us trust that Providence will make the end
correspond with the beginning, and that the result of all
will be
Peace

Grotius in his description of this siege: âwhen a city which dreads a
siege has many soldiers, the fortifications are carried outwards to a
distance, to stop the progress of the enemy. By this means those who
are shut up have a longer time to defend themselves, and still further,
the internal parts of the place remain longer in safety. Thus then the
prince of Orange gave orders that, before the boulevards of Bommel,
others should be made, and then still others, which should be inclosed
with a fosse of water, as well as the preceding ones, so that in the end,
all that was capable of defence should be further surrounded by a
parapet.ââ

This, then, is the origin of the multiplication
of the exterior works of places of war and of the covered way,

it their study that all fortifications should sustain one another, and might
be, at the same time, sustained by the body of the place.

List of the Novels and Tales

OF

SIR EDWARD BULWER LYTTON, BART.

Pelham.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

â
Pelham
â is at once the most finished as a narrative, the most
vigorous in execution, and taking its exuberant wit and daring originality
into account, it must be considered as the most decided indication
of what is rather felt than defined by the word
genius
.

Paul Clifford.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

â
Paul Clifford
â is a work
sui generis
. It is a political and
social satire worked out through the gravest agencies;âin form, a
burlesqueâin essentials, a tragedy.

Eugene Aram.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

â
Eugene Aram
â attests an immense progress in the resources of
art in fiction; it grasps the materials of terror and pity with a masterâs
hand, and connects them with all the gradual progress of the drama,
into tragic completeness.

The Last Days of Pompeii.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

The plot commencing lightly with the gay descriptions of idle life,
its baths and its banquets, deepens gradually towards the awful magnificence
of the catastrophe. All our passions are alternately ârocked
as on a music scaleâ by the scene in the gladiatorial arena,âthe
inhuman delight of the spectators,âthe first outburst of the irruption
from the Mount of Fire,âthe phenomena of the general destruction,âto
the still unnoticed disappearance of Nydia, under the smile of
awaking Dawn.

Ernest Maltravers.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

Rienzi.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

The early middle age of Italy rises before us; rude, yet struggling
into light, and seeking escape into civilization by return to the classic
past; the grand soul of the âLast Tribuneâ comes to recall again,
for a momentary interval, the majesty of antique Rome, startling, as
with the ghost of the classic giantess, the barbarian courts of the
victor North. Rienzi himself is the master-spirit of the whole.

Alice; or, the Mysteries.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

The typical intentions are with admirable art kept so far subordinate
to the story, that we always feel ourselves in the company of living
agents; and it is only when our interest in the events of the tale and
the destinies of its leading characters is fully satisfied, that we pause
to look back at the secret philosophy that pervades the narrative, and
become sensible of the wisdom we have acquired in the pleasure we
have received.

Night and Morning.

1s. 6d. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 4s.

â
Night and Morning
â is the most generally popular of the
authorâs works; its materials are of a homelier and coarser kind than
many of them; but their texture is strong and their hues brilliant.
And in proportion as the work dispenses with the more reflective
beauties that distinguish â
Maltravers
,â it gains as an animated
and powerful story of human life.

The Pilgrims of the Rhine.

1s. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 2s. 6d.

The loveliest and most fanciful of this varied catalogue of fiction. It
gathers together, as into a garland of flowers, the associations, the
history, the legends, the romance of the Rhine. Nothing like it, for
the comprehension of the poetical aspects of places hallowed by
tradition, exists in our language; and its originality is so toned down
into familiar sweetness, that it is scarcely detected till we search for
some work with which to compare it, andâfind none.

Last of the Barons.

2s. Railway Library. Large Edition, cloth gilt, 5s.

The chief attraction of the book is in the brilliant gallery of contemporary
portraitsâEdward IV.; Henry VI.; the grand, affectionate,
wayward, fiery King Maker, the accomplished, able, inconstant
Hastings; the portentous youth of Richard of Gloucester,
learned and witty, dauntless and aspiring.

Godolphin.

1s. 6d. (December 1st.) Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

â
Godolphin
â has less vigour and less profundity than the best
of the writerâs fictions, but it has an exquisite grace of sentiment and
a singular fascination of style. It contains, perhaps, too, on the
whole, the most accurate of all Bulwerâs representations of that cold
and glittering surface of society which the French entitle the
beau
monde
.

Disowned.

1s. 6d. (1855). Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

The â
Disowned
,â with a more defective narrative and less
sparkling diction, gives glimpses of a much loftier tone of mind, of
greater capacities for pathos, of grander ideals of human character
and the nobler aims of human life. Perhaps a finer picture of the
Christian Stoic than is given to us in the effigies of the principal hero
in the â
Disowned
,â Algernon Mordaunt, is not to be found in
prose fiction.

Devereux.

1s. 6d. (1855). Large Edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

The mystery that pervades the plot is admirably sustained, and is
derived, not from the inferior sources of external incident, but the
complicated secrets of the human heart.

Zanoni.

1s. 6d. (1855). Large edition, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.

â
Zanoni
â is perhaps less liked by the many than the generality
of its companions, but it has especial admirers, who rank it above them
all. Independently of the depth and richness of its less visible poetry
and wisdom, it contains passages of tenderness and power, of wild
fancy and sombre grandeur, that irresistibly chain the more imaginative
class of readers.

Leila; or, the Siege of Granada.

Calderon; or, the Courtier.

1s. (1855). Large edition, cloth gilt, 2s.

Both these must be regarded as bold and rapid sketches, by a
master-hand, rather than elaborate and finished performances of
careful art.

Harold.

1s. 6d. (1855). Large edition, cloth gilt, 4s.

So truly national is this work in its spirit, and so replete with interest
and value is the information it contains, whether of manners,
customs, the origin of various races that people our island, the causes
of political events that, however remote, have bequeathed influences
which rule us at this day, that the careful perusal of â
Harold
â
becomes almost the duty of every well-instructed Englishman.

Lucretia.

1s. 6d. (1855). Large edition, cloth gilt, 4s.

â
Lucretia
; or,
The Children of Night
,â rather errs from
the over-exertion of strength. The vigour of its descriptions is not
sufficiently restrained by art, and carries terror too far into the regions
of pain.

The Caxtons.

(1855). Large edition, cloth gilt, 4s.

The moral bequeathed by the Caxton Family has received universal
approbation. It runs broadly and healthfully along the whole composition,
sporting with us by the way, and leaving us happier and
better at the close.

My Novel.

(1855). 2 vols, large edition, cloth gilt, 8s.

It is from its immense breadth of comprehension, its mature repose
of thought, its felicitous selection of the results of a most diversified
experience, that â
My Novel
â is indeed
par emphasis
entitled to
the name it assumes; and if not the loftiest of Bulwerâs works is
certainly his completest novel.

Transcriberâs Notes

Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.

Unusual grammatical constructions and ambiguous
inconsistencies were not changed.

Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.

In the
List of Sieges
, the entry âThebes, Palestineâ does not correspond
to anything the Transcriber could find in the rest of the text.

The
List of Sieges
references one set of sieges for Antwerp,
but there are two chapters for that city. Transcriber modified the List so that it
references both of them.

No âSECOND SIEGEâ is listed for
Tyre

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

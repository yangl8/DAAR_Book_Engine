EDITORâS NOTE

Object of the Book.
—This book is intended to serve as
an introduction to
Musketry Regulations
. The instruction
contained in it is consistent in principle and method with
that laid down in
Musketry Regulations, Infantry Training
(1914)
, and other official manuals. It is hoped that the
book may prove useful to officers and men of the newly
raised units of the Regular Army, Territorial Force, and the
Military Forces of the dominions. As great care has been
taken to explain the correct methods of carrying out musketry
training, it is also hoped that it may prove useful to
the Volunteer Training Corps, Officersâ Training Corps, and
Cadet Corps. The Preface contains notes on experience
gained at the front in the present campaign, signed by
General Sir OâMoore Creagh, V.C., which will prove of great
value to officers in training their commands.

Scope of Instruction.
—The scope of instruction in the book
is practically identical with that laid down in
Musketry Regulations
.
It contains the conditions of the individual and
collective field practices recently laid down for the training
of the new armies on classification ranges. It also includes
directions for carrying out a complete course of musketry
instruction on miniature ranges with the aid of the Standard
Target Equipment adopted for this purpose.
1
This instruction
includes elementary training, and leads up by
progressive stages to visual training, fire discipline, fire
direction and control, and a variety of individual and collective
field practices which can be fired under conditions
approximating as closely as possible to those of service.

Acknowledgment.
—The Editor desires to express his
thanks and acknowledgments to the Military Authorities
and to His Majestyâs Stationery Office for permission to
reproduce illustrations and extracts from the
Musketry
Regulations
and other official manuals. It is intended to
keep each edition of this book abreast of the latest developments
in the science with which it deals, and the changes
made from time to time in the official training manuals.

PREFACE

NOTES ON EXPERIENCE GAINED AT THE FRONT

By General Sir OâMoore Creagh, V.C.

1.
The experience gained at the front in the present
campaign may be divided broadly under two heads:
Firstly, the test under war conditions of the general
principles upon which the British Army has been trained
in peace. Secondly, knowledge concerning the tactics of
the enemy and his method of employing various arms.
With regard to the former of these two heads of information,
it is important to note
that the broad principles upon which
the training of the British Army has been based are described
by a General Officer as being sound, and that the need of
paying strict attention to them in carrying out training is
emphasized by him
. On the other hand, valuable experience
has been gained as to the best method of applying these
general principles to the peculiar conditions which have so
far prevailed in the present campaign, including the tactics
adopted by the enemy. Information based on this experience,
more especially so far as it concerns the employment
of musketry in attack and defence, is included in
these notes, as it may prove useful to officers in training
their commands.

2.
These notes, therefore, do not affect the general principles
of training laid down in this book.
They merely
deal with the application of these principles to the peculiar
conditions which have so far obtained in the course of the
campaign.
These conditions may at any time give place
to others, for it must be remembered that in no two military
operations is the situation exactly the same.
Instructors,
therefore, must avoid the mistake of training their men for

vii

any particular given conditions of warfare, and remember
that general principles and broad rules alone are applicable
to the leading of troops in war (Infantry Training, 1914).

3. German Musketry.
2
—(i) The Germans consider it unnecessary
to teach men to fire at distances beyond 400
metres. Their plan of infantry attack (see diagram, p. ix) is
devised to get within this range without opening fire. Accordingly,
judging distance is practised by officers only,
and no attention is devoted to the indication of targets,
concentration of fire, or to fire direction and control generally,
as practised in the British Army. To concentrate the
fire of a platoon or company on one spot at 1,000 yards
range was considered by Germans to be a waste of ammunition.
Their training seems to have been limited to independent
firing by battalions on large areas of ground.

(ii) Only some of their men were practised in rapid firing,
which averaged eight or nine rounds a minute, as against
the fifteen well-aimed shots a minute which British troops
are trained to deliver in rapid firing. In this respect it
may be mentioned that the straight bolt of the German
rifle is not so easy to work as the bolt of the British rifle,
nor is its clip so easy to put in. When put to the test of
war, the musketry of the German infantry is characterized
by British officers as poor and âlamentable.â

4. British Musketry.
—On the other hand, the German
officer referred to in the footnote below described British
musketry under the test of war as âmarvellous,â and, in doing
so, expressed the views generally held in the German Army
as the result of experience. He states that the Germans had

viii

counted on being able to rush the British troops by weight
of numbers by the plan of attack described in the next paragraph;
but they found themselves unable to do so because the
British rifle fire was âso straight and so quick.â He added
that âthey had never had a chance against the British,â
because, although they reckoned on their third line with
their machine-guns being able to get within 400 yards of
the enemy, they had never been able to do this over open
ground against the British, because their first line was down
too soon—sometimes at 800 to 1,000 yards. Again, on the
Aisne, this German officerâs machine-gun battery came
under the concentrated fire of British infantry at 1,000
yards, and though his men suffered heavily from it, they
were unable to reply to the British, as they were unable to
see them.

5. A German Plan of Infantry Attack.
—(i) The diagram
on page ix gives a rough idea of a German plan of
infantry attack in close formations, as explained by
a German officer. The first line is looked on as cover
from bullets for the second and third lines, to enable these
two lines to get close to the enemy with the minimum of
loss. The Germans considered massed formations to be the
only way to get up close to the enemy. Both ranks of each
line in these formations are close together. When their
third line is stopped, they have standing orders to dig in
at once, and for this purpose the third line carries shovels
and small picks. It has already been explained that,
owing to the tremendous effect of British musketry fire,
this German plan of attack has repeatedly failed after very
heavy loss has been incurred.

(ii) As regards fire effect, the Germans had considered the
machine-gun to be the most valuable method of discharging
bullets, and an enormous amount of time, trouble, and

ix

ammunition has been expended on machine-gun training,
as well as upon their artillery, upon which they relied
largely in their plan of attack. Notes referring to German
machine-guns will be found in
Machine-Gun Training
of this
series.

6. German Night Attacks.
—(i) The enemyâs night attacks
are made without scouts or advanced parties, and the
advance is made with great rapidity. Infantry in trenches
must always be ready to open a burst of rapid fire at a few
secondsâ notice; so long as this can be done, there will be
no chance of a trench being rushed. Supports should be in
the cover-trenches, and, when the firing-line is attacked,
should not fire, but rely on the bayonet.

Attack in Close Formations.

(ii) The Germans usually attack about 3 p.m. (winter) or
at dusk, and then entrench during the night within 200 yards
of our lines. They also take advantage of fog in the early
morning. They make a little progress in this way, but it

x

is slow work, and they have lost enormously, as already
stated. They shoot badly with the rifle, and the effect of
their fire is chiefly obtained by artillery and machine-guns.

7. Flares to illuminate Foreground at Night.
—(i) No
fixed apparatus can be set in the field for the reliable
lighting of foreground at night which will survive a prolonged
bombardment and bad weather, or admit of renewal
or attention in the close presence of the enemy. This
does not apply to electric searchlights employed in carefully
chosen and protected sites in connection with harbour
and fortress defences, nor to flares or bonfires set for the
purpose of providing a single illumination for a given purpose,
such as a signal or landmark.

(ii) For the temporary illumination of foreground during
an engagement with the enemy, the best method is to
employ hand and rifle âillumination grenades,â which ignite
on impact with the ground upon the same principle as in
the detonation of the explosive or fighting grenades. By
this means temporary illumination can be concentrated at
the exact points at which it is most required. In siege
warfare or trench fighting at close quarters there is special
use for a combined incendiary and illumination bomb or
grenade fired from a trench mortar. These bombs would
be charged with inflammable material and liquid, such as
cotton waste in petrol, together with a small charge of
explosive, which would ignite and scatter the contents freely
upon impact.

8. British Infantry Formations in Attack
—(i)
Advance under
Rifle or Machine-Gun Fire.
—Small columns in what are known
as âartillery formationsâ should never be adhered to
when there is a possibility of their coming under close or
medium range fire of infantry or machine-guns. Troops
have suffered severely from insufficient extension, and the
adoption of rigid lines, and also from pushing forward in

xi

close formations without taking the proper military precautions.
Loose elastic formations adapted to the ground, with
men at eight or ten paces interval, are the least vulnerable.

(ii)
Advance under Artillery Fire.
—Several times it has been
necessary to advance under unsubdued artillery fire. Small
columns at 50 yardsâ interval and 300 yardsâ distance have
been found to be the best method of avoiding casualties.
The 19th Brigade lying in the open in this formation were
shelled by two batteries for half an hour, and had only
twenty-five casualties.

9. Cover and Fields of Fire.
—(i) Owing to the effect of
German artillery fire, cover from view has become more important
than field of fire. It is better to have a field of fire of
100 yards and to be invisible than to have one of 600 yards
and be an easy target for artillery. Owing to the enemyâs
artillery fire by day, digging is nearly always done at night,
and this requires much practice. Some sort of rough cover
from shrapnel and head cover is made if time allows, and
also if it can be made without making the trench conspicuous.

(ii)
Defensive Positions and Sites of Trenches.
—Whenever possible,
trenches should be sited so that they are not under artillery
observation. This point is regarded as of great importance,
and an extensive field of fire is a secondary consideration.
Trenches should therefore be sited having regard to possible
observation stations on ground occupied by the enemy, and
not solely with regard to the possible artillery positions of
the enemy. In open country it is better to select a âback
position,â behind the crest of a hill, with a field of fire of
300 or 400 yards. This compels the enemy to expose his
infantry to rifle and shrapnel fire, and affords his artillery
little opportunity of observation. Such positions were held
on the Aisne, with slight loss to our troops and heavy loss

xii

to the enemy. A field of fire of 100 yards is regarded as
satisfactory if it cannot be increased without loss of concealment
from artillery observation.

10. Care of Rifles.
—(i) The following directions are issued
with regard to the care of rifles on service. New rifles are
inclined to work somewhat stiffly at first, owing to slight
roughness of the bearing surfaces of the bolt and bolt-way.
This can be appreciably lessened by frequent and systematic
manipulation of the bolt, the bearing surfaces being well
oiled. Primary extraction—the first loosening of the fired
cartridge in the chamber—can be improved by placing a
fired case in the chamber, and working the bolt-lever up
and down without drawing back the bolt.

(ii) Rifles must be kept clean and well oiled, and it has
been found necessary to make an inspection daily or even
oftener. Particular care must be taken to see that the
chamber is scrupulously clean. If it is permitted to become
dirty, great difficulty in extraction is likely to be experienced.
It has also been found that cartridges get rusted
into their clips, and that they should be moved at least
weekly. Magazine springs may also become weak, if the
magazine is continually kept loaded with ten instead of
five rounds.

11. Conclusion.
—(i) Up to the present the tactics of the
enemy and the conditions of warfare of the campaign on the
Continent have resulted as a rule in giving the infantryman
fairly short fields of fire and more or less visible targets.
This has accentuated the value of rapid, accurate fire
within close range, to which particular attention should be
paid in training men. On the other hand, when opportunity
has afforded, the value of fire direction and control
has been demonstrated by the effect of British rifle fire
beyond close range.

xiii

(ii) The principles of training laid down in the
Musketry
Regulations
and in this book as a whole should, therefore,
be adhered to and carried out systematically. Above all,
the sound principles that troops should be trained to make
the best possible use of their weapons, not only at one but
at all ranges of the battlefield, and that they should be
trained to adapt their instruction to a variety of conditions,
and not to any given conditions, should be observed
faithfully. The correct application of general
principles to the ever-varying circumstances of warfare
should be the object of any sound system of military
training.

(iii) The following subjects of training may be mentioned
as being especially important in relation to the present
campaign:

1. Rapid fire.

2. Entrenching, especially in the dark.

3. Cover from view of artillery for the trenches.

4. Bringing enfilade fire to bear on enemyâs trenches
whenever possible.

5. Skilful use of machine-guns. Infantry must be careful
when advancing that an enemyâs machine-gun is not hidden
on the flank ready to open enfilade fire. Some regiments
have lost very heavily from being caught in this way.

DEFINITIONS OF TECHNICAL TERMS
AND MILITARY VOCABULARY

I. DEFINITIONS.

Aiming-Off.

to the rifle-barrel without using the wind-gauge.

Aiming Point.
—The point in any target at which aim is taken, forming
the extremity of the line of sight.

Aiming Up and Down.
—Altering the point of aim vertically so as to
give more or less elevation to the rifle-barrel without altering
the sight.

Angle of Descent.
—Angle at which the bullet falls to the ground at
the end of its flight (Figs. 4 and 5).

Application.
—An elementary musketry practice, designed to illustrate
methods of correcting aim or sighting in accordance with
observation or signals from the butts.

Approximation of Scoring Rings.
—Concentric rings marked on an
instructional target and possessing various values which afford
a simple means of comparing the shooting errors of individuals,
but having no relation to the vulnerable surfaces of the ordinary
service targets.

Axis of the Barrel.
—The axis of the barrel is an imaginary line
following the centre of the bore from breech to muzzle
(
Fig. 2
).

Beaten Zone.
—Area of ground beaten by a cone of fire (
Fig. 6
).

Bullâs Eye.
—A circular aiming-mark of varying size used in elementary
training for grouping practice, with the object of eliminating
all sources of error other than that of bad holding.

Concentration of Fire.
—The directing of fire on one particular portion
of the enemyâs line. Its value lies in the demoralizing
effect it produces owing to the heavy loss it inflicts at the point
at which it is directed (
Fig. 48
).

Covered Approach.
—Ground and natural or artificial cover which
screens movement towards an objective from the enemyâs view.

Culminating Point.
—The culminating point is the greatest height
above the line of sight to which the bullet rises in its flight;
this is reached at a point a little beyond half the distance to
which the bullet travels.

Dangerous Space.
—The dangerous space for any particular range is
the distance between the first catch and the first graze (
Fig. 4
).

xxiii

Dead Ground.
—Any ground on which troops cannot be struck by
missiles fired by defenders of a position owing to the formation
of the intervening ground (
Fig. 10
).

Deflection.
—The inclination of the rifle-barrel laterally with reference
to the line of sight, counteracting the effect of wind, drift, or
other influence which tends to force the bullet out of a straight
path.

Description Points.
—Ground and its natural or artificial features used
for indication of targets (Figs. 49-51).

Distribution of Fire.
—The method of directing fire so that it may be
scattered over several objects (
Fig. 48
).

Elevation.
—The inclination of the rifle-barrel vertically with reference
to the line of sight, necessitated by the downward influence
exercised on the bullet by the force of gravity.

Error of the Day.
—A term used to include errors in shooting due to
miscalculation of atmospheric influences, such as wind, temperature,
etc.

Error of the Rifle.
—Any error inherent in a rifle, independent of any
error due to the want of skill of the firer.

Fire, Kinds of
—

Collective Fire.
—The fire of several rifles combined for a definite
purpose under the orders of a fire-leader. Such fire skilfully
directed and well controlled may produce good effect
up to 1,400 yards.

Converging Fire.
—Fire aimed at one target from different points.

Covering Fire.
—Fire delivered from the rear or flank by a special
body of troops to keep down the fire of the attacked during
the advance of the attacking body. It also includes fire
delivered by portions of a line with a view to assisting
the advance of the remainder (
Fig. 48
).

Effective Fire.
—Fire which has the desired result upon the target.

Enfilade Fire.
—Fire which sweeps a line of troops or defences
from a flank (
Fig. 48
).

Frontal Fire.
—Fire which is delivered directly to the front.

—When the angle of the fall of the bullets (see
Trajectory) is the same as the slope of the ground and the
missiles sweep along its surface the fire is called grazing
(
Fig. 9
).

Individual Fire.
—Fire opened without orders from a fire-leader.
On account of the difficulty of observation 600 yards may
be taken as the limit of effective fire of this nature against
small targets.

xxiv

—Indirect fire is fire directed by means of auxiliary
aiming-marks at an objective which is invisible to the firer
(
Fig. 48
).

Masked Fire.
—Troops (guns or rifles) in a position whence they
could employ fire effectively against an enemy, but for the
fear of causing casualties to their comrades, are said to
have their fire masked by these latter troops.

Oblique Fire.
—Fire directed on a target in a slanting direction—
i.e.

not directly to the front (
Fig. 48
).

Rapid Fire.
—Fire delivered as quickly as the nature of the rifle
admits.

Reverse Fire.
—Fire so directed that the bullets strike the target
in rear (
Fig. 48
).

Searching Fire.
—Searching is the term applied to collective fire
when the depth of its dispersion over a beaten zone is increased

Fig. 48
).

Unaimed Fire.
—Unaimed fire is fire directed at a visible objective
which strikes another objective to the rear of it (
Fig. 48
).

Fire Control.
—Fire control is the duty of junior officers and non-commissioned
officers, and consists in giving ranges to and
pointing out targets to the fire-units, and seeing that their men
adjust their sights to the range given. It further consists in
regulating the volume of fire, the accurate passing of all orders
and information, and in the cavalry and infantry the collecting
of ammunition from casualties and its redistribution.

Fire Discipline.
—The training of men so that they will instinctively
carry out all orders of fire-unit commanders, and in the absence
of orders adjust their sights and fire with due regard to the
tactical situation.

Fire Effect.
—The effect on the target resulting from the fire aimed at it.

Fire Fight.
—The struggle for fire superiority.

Fire Position.
—Positions from which fire is opened during the
advance of an attacking force; during the early stages of the
advance with a view to gaining ground, in the latter stages
with a view to gaining a superiority of fire.

Fire-Unit.
—A unit, the fire of which is controlled by one commander.
The normal cavalry and infantry fire-unit is the troop and
section respectively.

Firing-Line.
—In extended formations the line of troops from which
the main body of fire is delivered.

xxv

Firing-Position.
—The position, standing, kneeling, lying, etc., adopted
for firing, according to circumstances.

First Catch.
—The first catch is that point where the bullet has
descended sufficiently to strike the head of a man, whether
mounted, standing, kneeling, lying, etc. (
Fig. 4
, A).

First Graze.
—The first graze is the point where the bullet, if not
interfered with, will first strike the ground (
Fig. 4
, B).

Group, Grouping, or Diagram of Group.
—The pattern made on a vertical
target by a series of shots fired by an individual or the pattern
made on a horizontal surface by concentrated collective fire.

Grouping.
—An elementary musketry practice designed to test and
standardize holding and the accuracy of rifles, and to expose
constant errors in aiming.

Holding.
—The form of skill required in order to press the trigger
without disturbing the aim.

Inclined Sights.
—A common fault in aiming-failure to keep the
sights upright.

Line of Departure.
—The line of departure is the direction of the
bullet on leaving the muzzle—
i.e.
, the prolongation of the axis
of the barrel (
Fig. 2
).

Line of Fire.
—The line of fire is a line joining the muzzle of the rifle
and the target (
Fig. 2
).

Line of Sight.
—The line of sight is a straight line passing through
the sights and the point aimed at (
Fig. 2
).

and assist the movement of another unit (
Fig. 48
). Also individual
soldiers working in pairs to assist each other in firing.

Observation.
—Watching the effect of fire on the target with a view
to correction or verification of sighting, either by watching for
the dust thrown up by bullets or the behaviour of the enemy.

MUSKETRY

CHAPTER I

THE CARE AND CLEANING OF ARMS
3

Section
1
.—General Remarks.

1. Responsibility for Care of Arms.
—Officers commanding
companies are responsible for the condition of the arms in
their charge, and for instructing their men in the use of the
gauze, so that no unnecessary wear of the bore may result
through its misuse.

2. Defects.
—Commanding officers will report in the
Regimental Annual Return any defects in the machine guns,
rifles, or ammunition in their charge which have not been
remedied satisfactorily.

3. Instruction in Care and Cleaning of Arms.
—(i) The
soldierâs training in musketry will commence with instruction,
the object of which is to give him a thorough knowledge
of the different parts of the weapon with which he
is armed. Classes consisting of squads or small numbers
will be formed for this purpose under a competent instructor.
The construction of the rifle, the nature, function, and
names of its different component parts, its action in loading,
firing, unloading, and the use of the magazine, will be
explained to men, both verbally and by practical demonstration.
The parts of the rifle should be shown separately,
and then assembled before the class to explain its construction.

2

Instructors should ascertain, by asking the class
questions on different points, that each man has thoroughly
understood what he has been taught, and possesses a practical
knowledge of his weapon. The illustrations in Appendix,
I., show the various parts of the different service
rifles, and give their names.

(ii) When he has attained this knowledge, the soldier
will be taught by means of short lectures how to take care
of his weapon, reduce the wear and tear to which it is subjected
in ordinary use, and guard it from unnecessary wear
and tear and damage from various causes. Finally, the
soldier must be taught both by demonstration and practice
how to clean his weapon properly without causing damage
to it in doing so. Information on these points will be
found in this chapter.

Section
2
.—Wear and Fouling.

1. Wear.
—(i) Wear in the bore of a rifle is due to three
causes: (
a
) the friction of the bullet; (
b
) the heat generated
when ammunition is fired; and (
c
) the friction of the pull-through
gauze when the bore is being cleaned. When care
is used in cleaning, 5,000 to 6,000 rounds can be fired from
a rifle before it becomes unserviceable.

(ii)
Undue Wear.
—Undue wear is caused by improper and
unnecessary use of the pull-through gauze, to prevent
which it is most important that the instructions for cleaning
be adhered to. It may be necessary to modify these
instructions to suit local climatic conditions, or particular
rifles which are in a bad state of preservation.

(iii) When a rifle barrel is new, the interior of the bore
carries a high polish, and this is a great safeguard against
rust and metallic fouling, but as the bore becomes worn,
this polish will diminish. Efforts to restore it with wire
gauze on the pull-through result in unnecessary wear. In

3

a well-cared-for rifle, while the brilliancy of the polish will
diminish, the lands of the bore should always be bright and
free from all stain of rust or fouling.

2. Fouling.
—(i) Fouling is of two kinds: (
a
)
Internal
,
probably caused by the forcing of gas or harmful material
into the pores of the metal; (
b
)
Superficial
, caused by the
deposit in the bore of the solid products of combustion of
the charge and of the cap composition. The result of
neglect in either case is the formation of
rust
in the bore,
and, as a consequence,
corroded barrels
, calling for the excessive
use of wire gauze, or even more drastic treatment,
thereby causing unnecessary wear.

(ii)
Internal Fouling.
—Internal fouling can be removed satisfactorily
by the use of boiling water [Sec. 4, para. 6 (ii)]. If
for any reason this method of cleaning cannot be used, the
barrel will âsweat,â and a hard black crust of fouling will
appear in the bore. This will turn to red rust if not removed,
and the rifle will then require repeated cleaning
with flannelette, and probably with gauze, for a time, which
will vary according to climatic conditions and the state of
the bore.

(iii)
Superficial Fouling.
—Superficial fouling is readily
removed, when warm, by the use of a pull-through and
flannelette, but if it is allowed to remain long in the barrel,
it will become hard and will have a corrosive effect equal
to that produced by internal fouling.

3.
Nickelling.
—The appearance of nickelling, or
metallic
fouling
, should be watched for. It is caused by a portion
of the cupro-nickel of the envelope of the bullet being left
on the surface of the bore, and appears as a whitish streak
on the lands, or as a slight roughness on the edge of the
grooves. If it is deposited near the muzzle or the breech,
it is visible to the eye when the bore is clean, but in the
centre of the bore it can only be detected by the use of the
gauge plug. It is a cause of inaccuracy, and if a rifle for

4

no apparent reason shoots badly, its presence should be
looked for as a possible explanation. The soldier will make
no attempt to remove it himself, but will hand his rifle to
the armourer, or other qualified person, to be cleaned.

Section
3
.—Materials used for Cleaning Arms.

1. Pull-Through
(
Fig. 1
).—(i) A pull-through fitted with a
weight, and an oil-bottle to contain Russian petroleum, are
carried in the recess in the butt of the rifle. The pull-through
is made with three loops. The first—
i.e.
, nearest the weight—is
for the gauze when used; the second for the flannelette;
the third is provided merely as a means of withdrawing
the pull-through in case of a jamb. Neither flannelette
nor gauze should be placed in this loop. When signs of
wear appear, a new cord should be supplied, to avoid
the risk of the pull-through breaking in the rifle. If a
breakage does occur, the rifle must be at once taken to the
armourer. No attempt should be made by the soldier to
remove the obstruction.

(ii)
Packing the Pull-Through.
—The pull-through is packed
above the oil-bottle as follows: Hold the pull-through (loop
end) between the forefinger and thumb of the left hand, so
that the end falls about 2 inches below the third finger; roll
it loosely three times round the first three fingers. Slip the
coil off the fingers, and lap it tightly with the remainder
of the cord, leaving sufficient to allow the weight to drop
easily into the recess in the butt. Push the cord into the
trap, leaving the loop end uppermost, drop the weight into
the recess, and drop the trap.

2. Use of the Pull-Through.
—(i) Remove the bolt from
the rifle, and in order to insure the gradual compression
of the gauze, if used, and of the flannelette, drop the weight
through the bore
from breech to muzzle
. The pull-through
should be drawn through in one motion, otherwise the spot

5

where the flannelette is allowed to rest while a fresh grip
of the cord is being taken will not be properly cleaned.
Very great care must be taken not to allow the cord to rub
against the muzzle, otherwise a groove, technically known
as
cord wear
, will be cut, which in course of time will destroy
the accuracy of the rifle.

Wire Gauze folded

Section

Wire Gauze on Pull-through

Fig. 1.

(ii)
Flannelette.
—Only regulation flannelette is to be
used. When cleaning or drying the bore after washing
out with water, a piece of dry flannelette large enough to
fit the bore tightly (about 4 inches by 2 inches) should be
placed in the second loop of the pull-through. For oiling
the bore, a slightly smaller piece of oily flannelette, which
will fit the bore loosely, should be used. Care must be
taken not to use too much oil, as it will be squeezed out of
the flannelette at the entrance to the bore, and will run
down into the bolt when the rifle is placed in the rack, and
may then cause miss-fires.

6

(iii)
Caution.
—The use of
two single pull-throughs attached
to one another
, so as to make a double one, is strictly
forbidden, because this practice has been found to produce
âcord-wornâ barrels.

3.
(i)
Wire Gauze
(
Fig. 1
).—Wire gauze in pieces 2½ inches
by 1½ inches is supplied, and should be used for the removal
of hard fouling or of rust. In attaching it to the pull-through,
the following method should be adopted: Turn
the shorter sides of the gauze towards the upper, so that
the longer sides take the form of the letter S. Open
the first loop of the pull-through, and put one side of it in
each loop of the S. Then coil each half of the gauze
tightly round that portion of the cord over which it is
placed till the two rolls thus formed meet.
The gauze
must be oiled thoroughly before use to prevent its scratching
the bore.

(ii)
Object of Gauze.
—The object of the gauze is mainly
to scour out the grooves, and it should therefore fit the
bore tightly. When it fails to do this, it should be unrolled
partially, and packed with paper or flannelette to increase
its bulk.

(iii)
Use of Gauze.
—Grit must be removed from the gauze
and pull-through before use. Cleaning with gauze entails
wear of the bore of the rifle. Gauze should not be pulled
through the barrel more often than three or four times
without sufficient cause. The surest way of preventing
the necessity for the continued use of gauze is to keep
the bore well oiled so as to prevent rust. A barrel
which has become rusty will always be more liable to rust
than one which has been kept in good condition. It will
therefore require more attention and more frequent cleaning
with gauze. Similarly, a barrel in which erosion has
commenced will require more care than one of which the
surface has not been attacked, for, the eroded portion being
rough, moisture is more likely to collect on it and form rust.

7

It is also more difficult to remove rust thoroughly from a
rough surface than from a smooth one.

4. Oil.
—No oil other than Russian petroleum should be
allowed to remain in the bore. The function of this oil is
to cover the bore with a waterproof film, and thus prevent
moisture attacking the steel and forming rust. It must be
well worked into the flannelette with the fingers, otherwise
it will be scraped off by the breech end of the barrel.
When paraffin has been used, all traces of it should be
removed thoroughly, and the bore coated with Russian
petroleum, for paraffin, though an efficient agent for
removing rust, does not prevent its formation.

5. Caution.
—
No gritty or cutting material, such as emery
powder or bath brick, is to be used for cleaning any part of the
rifle.

Section
4
.—Instructions for Cleaning Arms.

1. To Remove the Bolt.
—Raise the knob as far as it will
go, draw back the bolt-head to the resisting shoulder, and
release it from the retaining spring. Raise the bolt-head
as far as possible (in the short rifle, Marks I, I*, II, and II*,
draw back the charger guide, then turn the bolt-head to
the left), and remove the bolt.

2. To Replace the Bolt.
—(i) See that the resisting lug
and cocking-piece are in a straight line, and the bolt-head
screwed home. Place the bolt in the body with the extractor
upwards, and press it forward until the head is
clear of the resisting shoulder (in the short rifle, Marks I,
I*, II, and II*, turn the head to the right, then push the
charger guide forward as far as possible). Turn the head
downwards until it is caught by the retaining spring. Close
the breech, and press the trigger.

(ii) In some rifles, the bolt can be replaced and closed
with the bolt-head unscrewed a whole turn. It cannot, however,

8

be closed with the bolt-head in this position if there
is a cartridge in the chamber. The greatest care should
therefore be taken to see that the bolt-head is screwed
fully home before the bolt is placed in the rifle.

3. Daily Cleaning.
—The outside of the rifle will be cleaned
daily, and all parts of the action wiped with an oily rag.
The bore of the rifle will always be left oily, but once a
week this oil will be removed and the bore relubricated.
In the case of rifles that have once become rusty, the bore
will be wiped out with flannelette and reoiled daily, and it
will, in addition, be cleaned once a week with the gauze on
the pull-through. The gauze is to be packed as already
stated, so as to fit the bore tightly.

4. Cleaning before Firing.
—(i) The action will be wiped
with an oily rag, and all traces of oil will be removed from
the bore and chamber by the use of a pull-through
which
has no gauze on it
.

(ii)
Caution.
—Neither the cartridge nor the chamber of
the rifle are on any account to be oiled before loading, nor
is any other form of lubricant to be used with a view to
facilitate the extraction of the empty case. Such a procedure
greatly increases the thrust on the bolt-head due to
the explosion of the charge, and is liable to injure the rifle.

5. Cleaning after Firing.
—(i) Arms will be cleaned immediately
after firing. The fouling can be removed easily
while it is still warm, and before it has had time to set
hard; while the less the time allowed for the fouling to
exercise its power of absorbing moisture from the air, the
less chance is there of rust forming.
If it is impossible to
clean the rifle at once, an oily rag should be pulled through the
bore, and the rifle should be cleaned at the earliest opportunity.

(ii)
After firing Blank Ammunition.
—After firing blank ammunition,
special care should be taken that the cleaning is
thorough, as, although there is no friction between bullet
and bore, and so no internal fouling or âsweating,â there is

9

greater accumulation of superficial fouling from blank than
ball cartridge. This is due to the fact that there is no bullet
in blank ammunition to scour the fouling left by the
preceding round. The firing also is in most cases more prolonged,
and a greater interval most usually elapse before
the rifle can be cleaned thoroughly.
When blank firing
precedes practice with ball, the rifles will be cleaned carefully
before ball practice commences.

6. Cleaning the Bore.
—(i) The following method of
cleaning the bore should be adopted. Thoroughly oil the
gauze to prevent it scratching the surface of the metal.
Drop the weight of the pull-through through the bore from
the
breech
, and pull the gauze through three or four times.
Then place a tightly fitting piece of dry flannelette in the
second loop of the pull-through, and draw it through till
the bore is clean. Finally oil the bore with a loosely fitting
piece of flannelette, using enough oil to cover the bore
thoroughly.
The rifle will be cleaned in this manner for
three days following that on which it was fired.

(ii)
Use of Boiling Water.
—An effective means of cleaning
the bore, whether firing has taken place or not, is found in
the use of boiling water. Before boiling water is used
superficial fouling and grease should be removed. About
5 or 6 pints should be poured through the bore from the
breech, using a
funnel to prevent its entering the body or
magazine
. The rifle should then be dried thoroughly and
the bore oiled. Not only does the boiling water remove
the fouling, but the expansion of the metal due to the heat
of the water loosens any rust there may be, and facilitates
its removal.

7. Cleaning the Action and Exterior
—(i)
Bolt
.—Thoroughly
clean the bolt, paying particular attention to the
face of the bolt-head, the striker point, and the extractor.

If the bolt requires cleaning inside it will be taken to the
armourer.

10

(ii)
Magazine.
—See that the recess for the extractor spring
is clear of dirt. Take out the magazine and wipe the inside
of the body and the entrance to the chamber with an oily
rag. Remove all dirt from the slots in the charger guide
and from the extractor recess in the front of the body.
Take out the magazine platform if required, and clean the
inside of the magazine with a dry rag.

(iii)
Exterior.
—Wipe the exterior of the rifle with an oily
rag, seeing that the
U
of the backsight, the hole in the
aperture-sight, the gas escape holes, and, in the short rifle,
the rack on the side of the leaf, are free from dirt. Remove
any fouling which has collected on the bayonet boss on the
nose-cap.
If allowed to accumulate, this may cause difficulty
in fixing the bayonet.

(iv)
Caution.
—The instructions regarding the use of an
oily rag for cleaning the bolts and bodies will not apply
in
dusty countries, where all parts of the action will be kept dry
and clean
.

8. Cleaning ·22-inch Rifles and Aiming-Tubes.
—(i) As a
foul rifle shoots very inaccurately it is of the utmost importance,
from considerations of safety, that the barrel should
be wiped out frequently during use.

(ii)
Rod and Brush.
—The rod and brush should be inserted
from the
breech end
. Under no circumstances should they
be inserted from the muzzle, as the friction of the rod is
liable to enlarge the bore and make the muzzle bell-mouthed,
thus causing inaccuracy.

Section
5
.—Instructions for Care of Arms and
Ammunition.

1. Care of Arms.
—(i) When the rifle is
not in use
, the leaf
and slide of the backsight should be lowered to avoid the
risk of damage from a blow or fall.
No non-commissioned
officer or soldier is permitted to take to pieces any portion of

11

the action, except as prescribed for cleaning, nor is he allowed
to loosen or tighten any of the screws, unless authorized to do
so by his company commander.

(ii)
Mainspring.
—The mainspring should never be allowed
to remain compressed, except when the rifle is loaded, as
the spring will thereby be weakened. The position of the
cocking-piece shows whether the mainspring is compressed
or not.

(iii)
Pull-off.
—The pull-off is the amount of pressure
which is required to release the nose of the sear from the
full bent of the cocking-piece; it should not be heavier than
6 nor lighter than 5 pounds in the short rifle, and not
heavier than 7 nor lighter than 5 pounds in other rifles.
Defects in the pull-off should be remedied by the armourer
only.

(iv)
Magazine.
—The magazine must not be removed from
the rifle except for cleaning purposes, and, to avoid weakening
the spring, cartridges should only be kept in it when
necessary. A failure of the spring to raise the platform can
usually be overcome by tapping the bottom of the magazine
smartly with the palm of the hand. If the failure recurs,
the rifle should be taken to the armourer for examination
and repair.

(v)
Bolt.
—The bolts of rifles are not to be exchanged.
Each bolt is carefully fitted to its own rifle, so that the parts
which take the shock of the explosion have an even bearing,
and the use of a wrong bolt will affect the accuracy of the
rifle.
The number stamped on the back of the bolt lever
should agree with that stamped on the right front of the
body.

(vi)
Browning.
—Care should be taken to prevent the
browning being rubbed off the rifle.

(vii)
Cover In Dusty Countries.
—In dusty countries it may
be found necessary to cover the muzzle and bolt with a cover
of khaki or other suitable material, to prevent the dust

12

gaining access to the interior of the rifle, but anything in the
nature of a plug in the muzzle is expressly prohibited.

(viii)
Removal of Oil.
—The oil will only be removed from
the bore of the rifle—

(
a
) Immediately before firing.

(
b
) For inspection, which, except after firing, should not
as a rule be more often than once a week.

(
c
) For parades and duties as may be ordered by the
commanding officer.

In all cases it will be replaced as soon as possible.

2. Bayonets.
—After firing with bayonets fixed, the
bayonet should be carefully wiped before it is returned to
the scabbard. All oil should be removed from the blade
before placing a bayonet in the scabbard.

3. Care of Ammunition.
—(i) Ammunition should be kept
perfectly dry and clean, and should not be exposed to
extremes of temperature.

(ii)
Miss-Fires.
—A miss-fire arises from—

(
a
) A defective cartridge.

(
b
) A defective rifle.

In case (
a
) the cartridge will be tried in another rifle,
and, if it still fails to fire, a report will be made in accordance
with the instructions contained in the Kingâs Regulations.
In case (
b
) the rifle will be taken to the armourer for
examination.

Section
6
.—Examination of Small Arms.

1. Instruction of Officers.
—It is necessary for all company
officers and sergeants to possess a competent technical
knowledge of the inspection, care, and preservation of small
arms. Commanding officers will therefore arrange that
they shall be instructed annually by the regimental
armourer in repairing faults most likely to occur in the field

13

with such tools as would be available, and in the examination
of the various components as directed in the following
paragraphs:

2.   Examination of M.L.M. Rifles.
—(i) The interior of the
barrel for rusts and cuts.

(ii) (
a
) The backsight leaf for firmness of joint; that it is
not bent; that the slide moves smoothly and fits firmly on
the leaf; that the
V
is not deformed; and that the lines on
the slide are clearly marked.

(
b
) The foresight; that the barleycorn is not deformed.

(iii) The aperture and dial sights; that they are not bent,
and work smoothly.

clear the bottom of the resisting lug on the bolt.

(vii) The butt; that the stock-bolt is properly screwed up.

Note
.—In arms marked â2â on the right of the butt,
and at the socket of the fore-end, the latter must be
removed before attempting to turn the stock-bolt. In
screwing it home the precautions prescribed in sub-para. xvii
will be carefully observed.

(viii) The cocking-piece and striker; that they fly forward
freely on pressing the trigger.

(ix) The striker-point; that it is the correct shape and
projects sufficiently through the face of the bolt-head.

(x) The magazine; that it is not dented, and that the
platform works freely.

3. Examination of M.L.E. Rifles.
—The same as for rifles
M.L.M., with the following addition:

(xi) Safety-catch; that the bolt of the safety-catch
engages in the slots in the extension at the end of the bolt.

14

M.L.E. Charger-Loading Rifles.
—The same as (i), (iii),

additions:

(xiii) (
a
) The backsight leaf, for firmness of the joint; that
it is not bent; that the fine adjustment and windgauge fit
firmly; that the slides move smoothly; that the catches
engage in the racks on both sides of the leaf; and that the

V
is not deformed.

(
b
) The foresight; that the barleycorn is not deformed.

(xiv) The bolt; that the striker is not too free on the
cocking-piece, and that it is not screwed too far into the
latter; also that the striker keeper nut-screw (or the striker
keeper-screw if fitted) is not broken, and that the nut is in
its proper position.

(xv) The bolt-head; that the charger guide is not too
loose on the bolt-head; that it works smoothly; and that the
top screw is intact.

(xvi) The safety-catch and locking-bolt; that the safety-catch

position.

(xvii)   The butt; that it is not loose. If the stock-bolt
requires screwing up to tighten the butt, the fore-end must
first be removed. On reassembling, great care will be taken

15

that the square end of the stock-bolt which protrudes through
the socket of the body is in the correct vertical position, so
that it may enter the keeper-plate properly when the fore-end
is replaced. On replacing the fore-end, see that the
fore-end stud and spring, where fitted, are in proper position;
the front guard and inner band-screws must be tightened
carefully.

5. Examination of Short, M.L.E., Mark III, and Converted
Mark IV Rifles.
—The same as (i), (iii), (vi), (viii), (ix), (x),
(xiv), (xvi), and (xvii), with the following additions:

of the leaf; and that the
U
is not deformed.

(
b
) The foresight; that the blade is not deformed.

6. Drill Purpose Rifles.
—These instructions apply also to

Drill Purpose rifles.
As these are used for the instruction
of recruits in aiming, particular attention should be paid to
the state of the sights.

Section
7
.—Inspection of Arms on Parade.

1. For Inspection
—
Port Arms
.—Cant the rifle, muzzle
leading, with the right hand smartly across the body, guard
to the left and downwards, the barrel crossing opposite the
point of the left shoulder, and meet it at the same time with
the left hand close behind the backsight, thumb and fingers
round the rifle, the left wrist to be opposite the left breast,
both elbows close to the body.

Turn the safety-catch completely over to the front with
the thumb or forefinger of the right hand (with Lee-Enfield
or Lee-Metford rifle, lower the safety-catch with the thumb
of the right hand). Pull out the cut-off if closed, first
pressing it downwards with the thumb, then seize the knob

16

with the forefinger and thumb of the right hand, turn it
sharply upwards, and draw back the bolt to its full extent,
then grasp the butt with the right hand immediately behind
the bolt, thumb pointing to the muzzle.

Note.
—A squad, before being inspected, will receive the
command
Rear Rank, One Pace Step Back—March
.

2. To Ease Springs and come to the Order
—
Ease Springs
.—From
the position described above, work the bolt rapidly
backwards and forwards until all cartridges are removed
from the magazine and chamber,
4
allowing them to fall to
the ground, then close the breech (with Lee-Enfield or Lee-Metford
rifle, the cut-off should first be closed), press the
trigger, close the cut-off by placing the right hand over the
bolt, and, pressing the cut-off inwards, turn the safety-catch
over to the rear, and return the hand to the small.

Or, if the Magazine is Charged
—

Lock-Bolt.
—Close the breech (with Lee-Enfield or Lee-Metford
rifle, the cut-off should first be closed), then turn
the safety-catch over to the rear (with Lee-Enfield or Lee-Metford
rifle raise the safety-catch), and return the hand to
the small.

Order Arms—One.
—Holding the rifle firmly in the left hand,
seize it with the right hand at the band (with Lee-Enfield or
Lee-Metford rifle, at the lower band).

Two.
—As in the second motion of the
order
from the

slope
.

Three.
—As in the third motion of the
order
from the
slope
.

3. Instructions for Inspecting Arms.
—(i) When arms are
inspected at the
port
only, as in inspecting a platoon on
parade, the officer or non-commissioned officer will see that
the exterior of the rifle is clean and free from rust; that the
magazine and action are clean and in good order; that the
sights are at zero; and that no parts are loose or damaged.
He will here and there examine the bore of a rifle to see

17

that it has been cleaned and oiled, and is free from
obstructions.

(ii) Each soldier, when the officer has passed the file next
to him, will, without further word of command,
Ease Springs
,

Order Arms
, and
Stand at Ease
. When the inspection is completed,
the squad will be closed on the squad commanderâs
command
Close Ranks—March
, when the rear rank will take
one pace forward.

4. To Examine Arms
—
Examine—Arms
.—Both ranks, being
at the
port
, will come to the position for loading (Sec. 27,
para. 1 (1)), with the muzzle so inclined as to enable the officer
to look through the barrel, the thumb-nail of the right hand
being placed in front of the bolt to reflect light into the
barrel.

The soldier, when the officer has passed the next file to
him, will act as detailed in para. 3 (ii) above.

Notes.
—(i) If it is necessary to examine arms, the men,
when in the position of
for inspection, port arms
, will be
cautioned to remain at the
port
. Ranks will be closed, as
in para. 3 (ii), when the examination has been completed.

(ii) In ordering arms from the examine, the first motion
is to seize the rifle with the right hand between the backsight
and the band, at the same time bringing the left foot
back to the right. With the second motion the rifle will be
brought to the order, the left hand being cut away to the
side.

CHAPTER II

THE THEORY AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION
OF RIFLE FIRE

Section
8
.—General Information.

1. Need of Theoretical Knowledge.
—A knowledge of the
theory of rifle fire is of great importance in enabling the
best use to be made of the powerful and accurate weapon
with which the soldier is armed. The next step in the
soldierâs musketry training after he has been instructed in
the construction, care, and cleaning of his rifle will therefore
be devoted to teaching him the theory and application
of rifle fire. This instruction will consist of lectures, important
points being illustrated by the aid of diagrams
or drawings made with chalk on a blackboard, and by
practical demonstrations when possible.

2. Difference between Peace and War Conditions.
—(i) It
is, however, of the utmost importance that the soldier
should be taught from the first to apply his theoretical
knowledge correctly.
The soldier must be made to realize
clearly that the moral conditions under which fire is delivered
in war are very different from those of peace.
Therefore
deductions made as to the effect of fire from the theory of
musketry applied under peace conditions, when firing takes
place on open level ground under good conditions of light
and atmosphere at visible targets at known distances with
weapons in good condition in the total absence of any
strain of excitement or fatigue and of the enemyâs fire,

19

20

must not be applied to conclusions as to the effect of fire
delivered under war conditions.

Fig. 3.

Illustration of Trajectory etc.

(ii) For under war conditions targets beyond close range
are usually invisible or indistinct, and frequently in motion;
distances are uncertain and difficult to judge; firing takes
place under all conditions of light and atmosphere over
every variety of ground, under the strain of excitement
and fatigue in the face of artillery and rifle fire, with weapons
which rapidly become imperfect owing to heavy wear.
Accordingly, the theory of rifle fire is considered in this
book in relation to practical service conditions.

3. Technical Terms.
—The different technical terms used
in this chapter in explaining the theory and application
of rifle fire will be found among the Definitions (p. xxii).
Some of these terms are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. In
addition, the following technical terms may conveniently
be quoted in this paragraph:

(i)
Individual Fire.
—Individual fire is fire opened by
individual soldiers without orders from a fire-unit commander.
When men fire individually, each one selects his
target, estimates the range, and regulates his fire according
to his own judgment.

(ii)
Collective Fire.
—Collective fire is the fire of a number
of men combined for a definite purpose under the orders of
a fire-unit commander, who indicates targets, gives ranges,
and controls fire as to rate, etc.

Note.
—Collective fire is necessarily controlled fire.
Individual
fire will also be controlled if circumstances permit.

4. Rifling.
—A gun-barrel is said to be rifled when it has
spiral grooves cut down the bore. Rifling a barrel enables
an elongated bullet to be used instead of the round âballâ
of former days. The advantage of this form of bullet is
that it has great weight in proportion to the surface directly
opposed to the air. It has therefore great power of overcoming
the resistance of the air, and thus maintaining its

21

velocity and penetrating force
5
over greater distances than
would otherwise be possible. Moreover, when the charge
is fired, the bullet is forced into and follows the spiral
grooves up the barrel, the effect of which causes it to leave
the muzzle rotating or spinning on its longer axis. This
spin tends to keep its point foremost, and therefore to
ensure accuracy of flight.

5. Forces Acting on the Bullet.
—Three forces act on
the bullet: (
a
) The explosion of the charge, (
b
) gravity,
and (
c
) the resistance of the air. The explosion of the
charge drives the bullet forward. Gravity—the natural
attraction which draws all unsupported bodies towards the
centre of the earth with ever-increasing velocity—acts on
the bullet immediately it leaves the muzzle. The resistance
of the air causes the velocity of the bullet to decrease
rapidly during its flight.

6. Trajectory.
—The combined effect of these forces
causes the bullet to travel in a curved line called the

trajectory
, the curvature of which becomes more pronounced
the longer the bullet is exposed to their action. Thus, a
Mark VI bullet leaving the muzzle of a service rifle at the
rate of about 2,060 feet per second falls about 4½ inches
below the line of departure in the first 100 yards. This
drop is increased to about 20 inches at 200 yards. With
Mark VII ammunition, giving a muzzle velocity of
2,440 feet per second, the drops at the above distances are
about 3 inches and 13 inches respectively. Imaginary
not actual curves of trajectories are shown in Figs. 6 and 8.

7. Method of Explaining Trajectory.
6
—(i) In explaining
the trajectory to recruits it is not sufficient merely to show

22

or draw a diagram representing a trajectory distorted in
respect of height and range. When possible the actual
path of the bullet through the air at various short ranges—say
400 and 800 yards—should be shown by means of discs
raised on poles at every 100 yards, or some similar device.

(ii) It must be explained to the soldier that the further
an object has to travel and the longer it is suspended in
the air, the higher it must be thrown to counteract the
force of gravity, because the greater the distance it travels
and the longer it remains in the air the longer will the object
be affected by the force of gravity. Consequently the
longer the range the higher will the curve of the trajectory
take the bullet in its flight, and the steeper will be the angle
at which it will fall to the earth.

(iii) On the other hand, the shorter the distance an
object is thrown, and the swifter its flight through the
air, the less will it be influenced by the force of gravity
during its flight, and the lower or flatter will its trajectory
be in consequence. Thus, with the backsight adjusted for
the distances in question, a Mark VI bullet does not rise
above the height of a man on foot at 500 yards range, or
above the height of a mounted man at 600 yards range.
With Mark VII ammunition, the bullet does not rise above
these heights at 600 and 700 yards range respectively.

8. Firing at Close Range without Altering Sights.
—
It is
therefore evident that effective fire can be maintained within
close range without alteration of the backsight.
Apart from
the flatness of the trajectory at close range, and the
consequent inclusion of distances within close range in
dangerous space (Sec. 9), there will seldom be opportunities
for altering sights at close range on service, and necessary
allowances for elevation must be made by aiming up and
down (Sec. 21).

9. Elevation.
—In order to allow for the fall of the bullet,
owing to the force of gravity, it is necessary to direct,the

23

line of departure as much above the object to be hit, as the
bullet will fall below it at any given distance if the axis
of the barrel of the rifle is pointed at the mark. This
raising of the barrel to allow for the curve of the trajectory
is termed
giving elevation
. The target must of necessity
be kept in view. The rifle is therefore provided with
sights, which permit the firer to give the elevation required
whilst keeping his eye fixed on the mark.

10. The Sighting of Rifles.
—(i) In the sighting of rifles a

mean graduation for each range has been adopted
, and a high
general standard of accuracy for all practical purposes is
thus obtained. Each rifle is carefully tested before issue,
but it must be understood that
no two rifles behave in an
exactly similar manner
, and that even if compensation
could be made for every error in the sighting of the rifle
before issue, the wear of parts and the loosening or tightening
of screws, etc., would bring about faults from time to
time which would affect the shooting of each rifle
differently.

11. Need of Knowledge of Each Weapon.
—
It is therefore
necessary that every man should study the shooting of his own
rifle
, and make himself acquainted with any incorrectness
of the graduations marked on the backsight, in order
that he may be in a position to give his rifle the correct
elevation for the estimated or ascertained range of the
target.
At longer ranges the backsight elevation may be
regarded as the best possible guide to errors under all conditions,
or any error may be ascertained by using a long-range
sighting target.
7

12. Jump.
—Owing to the shock of discharge, a vibratory
or wavy motion is set up in the barrel, which slightly affects
the line of departure of the bullet as it leaves the muzzle,
and which is known as âjump.â The causes and extent
of jump are dealt with in the textbook of
Small Arms
.

24

The effect of jump is allowed for in the sighting of the
rifle,
and will not be taken into account by the soldier in
aiming
.

13. Drift.
—Drift is the term used to express the
lateral
deviation
of the bullet after it has left the barrel. This is
due to the direction of the rifling, which causes the bullet
to rotate from right over to the left in its flight, so that
the point works over slightly to the left, owing to gyroscopic
action. The consequent increased air-pressure on the
right side of the bullet forces it to the left as it flies.
The
deflection due to drift at distances within 1,000 yards is
negligible, and need not be taken into account by the soldier
in individual firing.
Beyond 1,000 yards up to the limit
of effective rifle fire at about 1,400 yards, drift will carry
the bullet about 7 feet to the left. This deflection, if
necessary, will be taken into account by fire-unit commanders
in directing concentrated fire at narrow-fronted
targets at longer ranges.

14. Effect of Fixing the Bayonet.
—(i) When the bayonet
is fixed to the muzzle of the rifle, its weight checks the
jump, and in consequence slightly affects the position of
the muzzle at the moment of the departure of the shot,
and the primary direction given to the bullet.

(ii)
Short Magazine Lee-Enfield Rifle.
—With Mark VI
ammunition, the accuracy of the short magazine Lee-Enfield
rifle is not appreciably affected by fixing the
bayonet. With Mark VII ammunition, the soldier will
aim down slightly in firing with fixed bayonet at ranges
up to 600 yards.

(iii)
Lee-Metford or Charger-Loading Lee-Enfield Rifles.
—With
Mark VII ammunition, fixing bayonets has a negligible
effect. When firing Mark VI ammunition from the Lee-Metford
or Charger-loading Lee-Enfield rifles with fixed
bayonets at ranges up to 600 yards, the soldier should
aim up very slightly, taking care, however, in doing so to

25

aim low in all cases, and to aim at the ground-line in firing
at troops advancing towards him.

15. Effect of Resting the Rifle.
—For practical purposes,
the shooting of the rifle is not affected by resting the
muzzle or any portion of the stock lightly on earth or
other substance.

16. Effect of Oily Barrel.
—The first round fired from an
oily barrel is liable to follow an erratic course, the rifle
throwing sometimes high, sometimes low, and at other
times to the right or left. A dry rag should therefore be
passed through the bore before practice is commenced.

Section

.—Dangerous Space—Ricochets—Firing
Up and Down Hill.

1.
Dangerous space may broadly be defined as the whole
ground covered by the trajectory of a bullet from the point
where it could first come in contact with the top of an object
fired at to the point where it falls to the earth (Figs. 4 and 5,
and Figs. 6 and 8).

2. Extent of Dangerous Space.
—The extent of dangerous
space depends upon the following factors:

(i)
Range.
—Dangerous space decreases as the range increases,
the reduction being due to the steeper angle at
which the bullet descends at longer ranges (compare Figs.
4 and 5).

(ii)
Firerâs Position.
—The position of the firer and the
consequent height of his rifle above the ground will affect
dangerous space.
The nearer the rifle is to the ground
when it is fired, the greater will be the extent of dangerous
space.

(iii)
Height of Object.
—As a rule the higher the object fired
at is, the greater will be the extent of dangerous space.

(iv)
Trajectory.
—The flatter the trajectory—the closer

26

the bullet keeps to the ground in its flight—the greater as
a rule will be the extent of dangerous space.

(v)
Conformation of Ground.
—The more nearly the slope
of the ground conforms to the curve of the trajectory and
to the fall of the bullet, the greater will be the extent of
dangerous space (see
Fig. 8
).

3. Example of Conditions affecting Dangerous Space.
—The
following example illustrates the method by which the
soldier may be made to realize the importance of this question,
and the principle which underlies its influence upon
the effect of fire: If he is firing in the
lying position
with
Mark VI ammunition, and aims at the ground-line of a
prone figure at 500 yards range, the dangerous space of his
fire will be
about 50 yards
. If, however,
he stands
to fire
at the same target, the dangerous space will be reduced to

about 40 yards
.

Figs. 4 and 5.
—
Dangerous Space.

Note.
—The angles of descent are imaginary, and not accurate
for any distance.

4. Ricochets.
—Bullets which rebound after striking the
ground or any other obstacle, and continue their flight, are
said to ricochet. Ricochets may occur from any surface,
and bullets may ricochet two or even three times before
their flight is finally arrested. At long range, they are less
likely to ricochet from soft ground than from hard, smooth
surfaces.

5. Firing Up and Down Hill.
—(i) When a shot is fired at
a target placed on the same level as the firer, the forces

27

acting on the bullet cause it to travel in its greatest curve,
and the greatest elevation for any given distance must
therefore be given to the rifle. If a shot is fired perpendicularly
upwards or downwards, no elevation is required, for
the bullet will travel in an approximately straight line until
its impetus is exhausted. Hence it follows that, when
shooting up or down hill, less elevation is necessary than
when the object is on the same level.

(ii)
For practical purposes, the effect of firing up and down
all moderate slopes will be negligible, and may be disregarded
by the soldier in taking aim on service.
Within close range,
in firing up and down steep slopes, or slopes at an angle
of 10 degrees and over, the decreased elevation necessary
will usually be small, and may be allowed for by aiming
down slightly. The correct elevation to be used in firing
up or down hill at longer ranges in various circumstances
is a matter for the judgment of fire-unit commanders, and
can best be ascertained by careful observation of fire,
when possible.

Section
10
.—Effects of Barometric Pressure, Temperature,
Wind, and Light.

1. Barometric Pressure and Temperature.
—Rifles are
sighted for the following conditions: Barometric pressure,
30 inches (sea-level); thermometer, 60° F.; still air; a horizontal
line of sight.

2.
The rise and fall of barometric pressure and temperature
affect the flight of the bullet and elevation by changing
the density of the atmosphere, and so increasing or decreasing
its resistance to the bullet. For practical purposes,
the soldier may disregard the effects of barometric
pressure and temperature as negligible. In operations conducted
at considerable heights above sea-level, orders as to

28

allowance for barometric pressure will, if necessary, be
issued by the Staff.

3. Effect of Wind
—(i)
Head Wind, or Wind from the Front.
—A
head wind, or wind from the front, retards the bullet,
and necessitates
more elevation
.

(ii)
Rear Wind.
—A rear wind lessens the resistance of the
air, and necessitates
less elevation
.

(iii)
Side Wind.
—A side wind, or wind blowing
at right
angles
from either side across the front, acts on the greater
surface of the bullet, and has, consequently, more influence
on its flight than a wind blowing from the front or rear.

(iv)
Oblique Winds.
—Oblique winds, or winds blowing
from any intermediate direction between a right angle and
a front or rear wind, have the same effect in varying degree
as side winds. Oblique winds, in addition, affect the bullet
to some extent in the same way as head and rear winds.

4. Allowance for Head and Rear Winds.
—No fixed rules
can be laid down regarding the degree to which elevation
should be increased or decreased at different ranges for
head and rear winds. For practical purposes, the effect of
these winds may be disregarded at ranges under 1,000 yards.
At longer ranges, fire-unit commanders will use their judgment
in directing fire, whether they will allow for strong
head and rear winds by increasing or decreasing elevation,
and to what extent.

5. Allowance for Side and Oblique Winds
(see also Sec. 20,

Aiming-Off
).—(i) No fixed rules can be laid down as to the
degree of allowance to be made by aiming-off for side and
oblique winds of varying direction and velocity. Owing to
the increased time during which the bullet is exposed to
the effect of wind, and owing to the height attained in its
flight, the allowance for wind at long ranges must be out
of all proportion greater to that necessary at close range.

(ii) At close range, whether fire is distributed along the
dense line of an infantry attack or concentrated on narrow-fronted

29

attacking columns, the effect of side wind will cause
little, if any, loss of fire effect. Individual soldiers, however,
in taking the deliberate aim necessary for fire effect,
should aim off for side winds of different velocity (see
Sec. 20, para. 3).

(iii) In directing fire beyond close range, fire-unit commanders
must use their judgment in allowing for deflection
due to side and oblique winds by including directions for
aiming-off in fire orders. The extent of the allowance will
in every case depend upon a variety of factors, including
the direction and velocity of the wind and the distance of
the target. Neglect to make due allowance for strong
winds at longer ranges may lead to loss of fire effect, more
particularly in the case of concentrated fire aimed at
narrow-fronted targets, such as a machine-gun.

6. Effect of Light.
—In bad light, the foresight is less distinctly
seen than in good light, and more of it is unconsciously
taken into the line of sight. For practical purposes,
the effect of light may be disregarded in firing at all
ranges.

Section
11
.—Need for Collective Fire.

1.
(i) Only exceptional targets and very favourable atmospheric
conditions will justify soldiers in opening individual
fire at distances beyond about 600 yards. Collective fire is
necessary to give reasonable assurance of fire effect beyond
about 600 yards up to about 1,400 yards, which is usually
the limit of effective rifle fire.
Beyond 1,400 yards, the fire
of even large and well-controlled units of infantry has seldom
much effect upon the decision of the struggle for superiority
of fire.

(ii) Collective concentrated fire is also used to form a
cone of fire for observation of fire, when results can be
noted by the dust raised by the strike of bullets on the

30

ground or by the effect of fire upon the enemy. It must be
clearly impressed upon the mind of the soldier at this stage
that,
however skilful individual men may be as marksmen,
the greatest effect is produced by their fire only when it is
efficiently directed and controlled
.

2.
(i) The soldier must also be made to understand
clearly why effect cannot be obtained from individual fire
in battle beyond close range, and why collective fire is
necessary for fire effect at all ranges beyond close range.
The answer to this question may be stated simply and very
broadly as follows: In effect, for various reasons, the individual
marksman cannot as a rule see his target clearly or
at all with the naked eye beyond close range on service,
and he can neither aim at it with accuracy nor be certain
of its exact range. Moreover, the effect of inaccurate firing,
whether due to excitement, fatigue, or other causes,
increases with distance.

(ii) Clearly, therefore, the soldier cannot obtain reasonable
assurance of fire effect by individual fire beyond close
range. Accordingly, fire-unit commanders equipped with
field-glasses discern and indicate targets to him. They give
him ranges after they have been ascertained by the use of
range-finding instruments, or by observation of fire, when
possible, and they direct the fire of a number of individual
soldiers in a volume which, whether distributed or concentrated,
is sufficient to compensate for individual errors,
and so obtain fire effect as described in Secs. 12 and 13,
and in Chapter VI.

3.
The principal reasons which militate against the assurance
of fire effect, by individual fire, beyond close range
may be summed up as follows: The effects of fatigue and
excitement on the firer; the effects of atmosphere, heat,
and light; errors due to imperfections in the rifle and
ammunition; uncertainty in estimating longer ranges; the
difficulty of discerning and aiming at small, moving, and

31

indistinct or invisible targets; and the steepness of the
angle of descent of the bullet, which becomes rapidly accentuated,
and so decreases dangerous space as range
increases.

4.
The soldier must be made to realize that the results
of errors of marksmanship due to these various causes

increase in extent as the range increases
, and that they reach
their maximum at longer ranges; that is to say, targets
become smaller and more difficult to see and to aim at, their
range becomes harder to estimate, and the accuracy of fire
for other reasons stated becomes less as the range increases.

Therefore, the effect of individual fire decreases as the range
increases.
It is easily possible for instructors in the course
of lectures on this point to make it sufficiently clear to
men that, under service conditions at longer ranges, effect
must be obtained from collective fire rather than from
individual fire, for all the above reasons. In some degree
this important principle of the science of modern warfare
can be demonstrated by firing at service targets on full
distance and also on miniature ranges (see Chapter X).

Section
12.
—Dispersion of Individual and
Collective Fire.

1. Shot Groups.
—Owing to errors on the part of the firer,
and also to imperfections in the rifle and ammunition, it
is found that a series of shots, even when fired by an individual
under perfect conditions at a large, stationary, distinct
target at a known and close range, do not all strike
the point aimed at, but they form a group of shot-marks
about this point, the density of which varies mainly with
the skill of the firer.

2. Cone of Fire
(
Fig. 6
).—It is evident that the trajectories
of these shots will not coincide, but will together form a
figure termed âthe cone of fire.â It is also clear that,

32

33

when aim is well directed, the bullets of a cone of fire
should always strike an object so long as the shot group
formed by it is either
smaller or of the same size
as the
object aimed at. But when the shot group is spread over
a larger surface than the size of the object, shots must
necessarily miss the mark in proportion as the size of the
grouping exceeds that of the object aimed at.

Fig. 6.

Cone of Fire

A—B shows the dangerous space due to height of objective.

Note:-The Dangerous Space will vary with
height of objective. The curve of
the Trajectory is imaginary and not
accurate for any distance.

3. Dispersion of Individual Fire.
—It is clear, therefore,
that the dispersion of individual fire explained in para.
I

will of itself, apart from the various factors mentioned in
Sec.
II
, militate against the assurance of fire effect by
individual fire at longer ranges, because the dispersion of
fire will become greater as the target decreases in size,
owing to distance, and the shot group will consequently
be spread over a much larger surface than that of a long-range
service target, even if stationary and visible to the
naked eye.

4. Dispersion of Collective Fire.
—When a body of soldiers
fires with the same elevation at the same object, the dispersion
of shots is accentuated by the varying skill and
eyesight of the men, with the result that the cone formed
will be of larger dimensions than in the case of individual
fire. The dimensions of the cone of fire will again be
further increased if the firers are from any cause, such as
fatigue or excitement, unsteady; if the rifles are in bad
condition or the target indistinctly seen—factors which
are all incidental to firing under the conditions of active
service.

5. The Beaten Zone.
—(i) The area of ground beaten by
a cone of fire is termed the âbeaten zone.â It is regarded
as a plane surface.
Fig. 6
illustrates this zone together
with the additional space which would have to be taken
into account in reckoning the dangerous space of the cone
of fire in consequence of the height of the objective.

(ii)
Depth of Beaten Zone.
—The depth of the beaten zone

34

at short ranges need not be considered on account of the
flatness of the trajectory, which insures that practically its
whole extent from the firers to the target is swept by
bullets. The depth of the beaten zone at various ranges
with the Mark VI and Mark VII ammunition is as
follows:

Distance.

Depth of Beaten Zone.

Mark VI.

Mark VII.

500

yards

220

yards

300

1,000

â

120

â

180

â

1,500

â

100

â

120

â

(iii) It will be seen that up to 1,500 yards—when the
ground is parallel to the line of sight—the depth of the
beaten zone decreases with the range, on account of the
increased angle of descent of the bullets. This shrinkage
of the beaten zone does not of itself increase fire effect
by the closer grouping of bullets, owing to the increased
steepness of the angle of descent, which decreases dangerous
space.

(iv) Beyond 1,500 yards it will be found that the depth
of the beaten zone tends to increase in consequence of the
influence of atmospheric conditions on the flight of the
bullet, the increased effects of errors in aiming, and faults
in the rifle and ammunition—all of which combine to
increase the dispersion of fire. This increased dispersion
does not of itself increase fire effect owing again to the
greatly increased steepness of the angle of descent at longer
ranges, which results in a correspondingly great decrease
in dangerous space.

35

(v)
Lateral Dispersion.
—On the other hand, owing to
faults in aiming, comparative invisibility of the target,
inaccuracies in the rifle and ammunition, and atmospheric
influences, the
lateral dispersion
of a cone of fire
increases
as the range becomes greater
. With Mark VI ammunition,
the dispersion of the best 75 per cent. of shots fired may
be taken as 7 feet by 220 yards at 500 yards, 14 feet by
120 yards at 1,000 yards, and 22 feet by 100 yards at
1,500 yards.

6. Nucleus of Cone of Fire.
—It is found that the bullets
in a cone of fire
are not dispersed evenly over the surface of
the beaten zone
. It is found that they are grouped in such
a way
that the majority of the bullets fall in the general
direction of the line of fire, that the density of the grouping
decreases progressively from the centre to the extreme limits of
the beaten zone, and that the bullets are collected most thickly
near the point for which the sights were set
. This dense
grouping is usually termed the nucleus of the cone of fire,
and is regarded for purposes of comparison as including the
best 50 shots per cent.

7. Zone of Effective Fire.
—The area of ground beaten by
the best 75 shots per cent. fired is termed the zone of
effective fire, for it has been found by experiment that

useful results in battle can only be looked for when the target
is within these limits
.

Section
13
.—Searching.

1. Definition of Searching.
—Searching is the term applied
to collective fire when the depth of its dispersion over a
beaten zone is increased by the use of combined sights as
described in para. 4 of this section.

2. When Collective Fire is Effective.
—As already stated,
collective fire will not as a rule produce results commensurate
with the amount of ammunition expended, or fulfil

36

37

the purpose for which it is used unless the target is included
within the area beaten by 75 per cent. of the bullets
directed upon it—that is to say, unless it lies in the zone of
effective fire (
Fig. 7
, C).

Fig. 7.

Diagrams illustrating the dispersion in depth
of concentrated collective fire at 1,500 yards
and its distribution in depth by the use of combined
sights.

3. When Collective Fire is not Effective.
—If an error in
sighting is made which would result in the nucleus of the
cone of fire striking at a distance short of or beyond the
target which is equal to
half the depth measurement of the
zone of effective fire
, the target will not be included in this
zone, and the
fire will be ineffective
(
Fig. 7
, B).

4. When combined Sights are to be Used.
—(i) Under
service conditions it may be assumed that
even if the range
is measured with the range-finder, the probability of error in
ranging and judging atmospheric influences, known as the
error of the day, is such that, at distances beyond 1,000 yards,
collective fire concentrated on any target with one sighting will
probably be ineffective
.

(ii) To give a satisfactory degree of assurance of fire effect,
it is advisable in such cases,
unless sighting can be corrected
by observation of results
, to distribute fire in depth by using
two elevations differing by 100 yards. One of these elevations
would be 50 yards
over
and the other 50 yards
under

the sighting believed to be correct.

(iii) There will thus be two cones of fire and two beaten
zones overlapping between the nucleus of each cone of fire,
and an even distribution of fire will be obtained over a zone
about 150 yards deep (
Fig. 7
, D). Thus, if one sighting had
been used, as shown in
Fig. 7
, B, the fire would have been
ineffective, though the grouping of bullets in the zone of
effective fire would have been more dense, because the error
in sighting would have had the result described in para. 3
above. By using combined sights fire becomes effective,
because though the grouping of bullets is less dense fire is

distributed in depth
so as to avoid the result described in
para. 3.

38

(iv)
Ordinarily fire should be closely concentrated with a
view to observation of results, but if observation has failed, or
if the situation calls for immediate application of effective fire,
combined sights should be used at ranges beyond 1,000 yards.

Combined sights may sometimes be used to increase assurance
of effect when the enemyâs position is ill-defined, but
should never be used if observation of results can be
obtained.
Combined sights should not be employed by bodies
of less than two platoons.

Section
14
.—The Relation of Ground to Fire Effect.

1.
So important is the influence exercised on fire effect
by the shape of the ground in relation to the grouping of
bullets, that it is essential for all officers and non-commissioned
officers to understand thoroughly how the probability
of fire effect is increased or diminished by the inclination
of ground with reference to the trajectory.

2.
In attack, such knowledge will assist them in
adopting
formations and directing the fire of their men to the best
advantage
. In defence, it will aid them
to select the best
positions for fire action
, and will enable them to take steps
to minimize the inherent disadvantages of these positions.
In the following examples only
plane surfaces, without undulations
or accidents, are considered
.

3. Level Ground.
—As already stated, on level ground
the zone beaten by collective rifle fire varies considerably
with the range. The extent of this zone is further influenced
by the
inclination of the ground to the line of sight
.

4. Rising Ground.
—(i) The more steeply the ground rises
with reference to the line of sight, the greater will be the
decrease in the extent of the beaten zone. For example,
when firing with Mark VI ammunition at ground rising
2, 5, and 10 degrees, the depth of the beaten zone at
1,500 yards range is decreased roughly by quarter, half, and

39

40

41

two-thirds respectively (
Fig. 8
). Since the grouping of the
bullets becomes closer as the upward slope of the ground
increases, the effect of errors in estimation of range will be
more serious, and as the bullets will fall at a steep angle the
dangerous space will be proportionately reduced.

The Beaten zone is greatest on slope A-D,
the Trajectory being practically parallel
to the surface of the ground.

Fig. 8.

The relation of Ground to Fire Effect.

Fig. 9.

The relation of Ground to Fire Effect.

(ii)
Formations, Supports, and Reserves.
—As a general rule,
therefore, on ground which rises with reference to the line
of sight,
troops should be drawn up in shallow formations, but
supports and reserves may be nearer the firing-line than is
normally advisable
.

5. Falling Ground.
—(i) When the ground beaten by
bullets falls in respect of the line of sight,
the depth of the
beaten zone is augmented in proportion as the downward slope
increases, until it reaches its greatest magnitude when the angle
of the fall of the bullets is the same as the slope of the ground
;
or, in other words, when the trajectory is practically parallel
to the ground surface (
Fig. 8
, Depth of Zone, A—D). In
these circumstances the fire becomes
grazing
(
Fig. 9
),
and
the extent of the dangerous space is nearly identical with the
beaten zone
.

(ii)
At close ranges
, therefore, where the trajectories are
flat, the depth of the beaten zone will be much increased if
the ground behind the target
falls at a gentle slope
(
Fig. 9
, A).

At long ranges
, on the other hand, a greater area will be
beaten when ground falls more steeply (
Fig. 9
, C).

(iii) For example, at 1,500 yards range the depth of the
beaten zone is roughly increased by three-fifths when the
bullets strike ground falling at 2 degrees. On ground
falling at 5 degrees, which is nearly parallel to the trajectory
at this range, the depth beaten is about ten times
greater than on level ground.

(iv) It is clear, therefore, that falling ground
far behind
the objective will at times be swept by unaimed fire
, and it
follows that in such circumstances supports should either be
under cover or, if there is no cover, in shallow columns

42

on narrow frontages with the object of reducing target
surface as much as possible.

6. Crest Line.
—(i) When the objective is a crest line
the depth of the beaten zone is greatest, and part of
the fire is grazing, when the ground beyond the crest
is parallel, or nearly so, to the trajectory of the bullets
(
Fig. 9
, A and B). At close ranges, in this case, there will
be behind the crest-line a
defiladed zone, or space not swept
by fire
(
Fig. 9
, C), greater or less according to the distance
from which fire is delivered, the inclination of the line of
sight, the extent of the hill top, and the inclination of the
reverse slope.

(ii)
Position of Supports and Reserve.
—It appears, therefore,

that when the firing-line is placed on the crest of a razor-backed
hill
, with steep reverse slopes (
Fig. 9
, C), supports
and reserves will at all ranges be but little exposed to
unaimed fire when posted in its vicinity. In other cases,
when the crest of a hill is occupied, the vulnerability of
supports and reserves will be least if, when the enemy is at
long range, they are withdrawn from, and as he approached
closed on, the firing-line (
Fig. 9
, C).

7. Dead Ground
(
Fig. 10
).—Dead ground is ground on
which, owing to its conformation or to the existence of
natural or artificial cover, fire cannot be brought to bear
from a given locality. The term is thus a relative one,
for though an area of ground may be dead in relation to
one locality it may be possible to bring fire to bear upon
it from another locality, in relation to which it will not
therefore be dead.

CHAPTER III

INSTRUCTION IN AIMING

Section
15
.—General Remarks.

1. Principles of Instruction.
—The instruction of recruits
in aiming and firing should be carried out on a systematic
method. The progression of training must in every case
lead by gradual steps from simple to more difficult
stages. Instructors must necessarily teach by explanation
to some extent, but they must limit explanation
to short and very clear statements, and rely chiefly upon
practical demonstration for training their men. With
regard to results they must aim at insuring
accuracy
in
every stage of training before they permit men to attempt

rapidity
. Any sacrifice of accuracy for rapidity must be
guarded against carefully and corrected at once. Short
daily lectures, followed by questions to test the knowledge
of men, should form part of the scheme of instruction.

2. Progression of Instruction in Aiming and Firing.
—The
progressive stages of instruction in aiming and firing are
set out in a definite order in this and the following chapter
which deal respectively with these subjects. Instructors,
however, are not bound to follow this order, and may modify
it at their discretion.

3. Concurrent Instruction in Aiming and Firing.
—Aiming
instruction should proceed simultaneously with firing
instruction and muscle exercises to develop speed and facility
in handling the rifle and steadiness in firing it. The following
scheme of concurrent instruction in aiming and firing is
suggested for the guidance of instructors, who may modify
it at their discretion:

Note.
—(1) Ample time should be devoted to trigger-pressing
and declaring the point of aim on discharge. This instruction
may conveniently be given indoors.

46

(2) The aiming position should not be taught until aiming
has been taught.

(3) Aiming and trigger-pressing should not be combined until
trigger-pressing has been taught.

(4) The test for trigger-pressing should not be applied until
after the lying position has been taught.

(5) The miniature range may be used when assurance of
reasonable proficiency has been ascertained by means of the
aiming discs.

(6) The 30-yards range with service ammunition may be used
when the results on the miniature range are satisfactory.

(7) Grouping on the open range may be commenced when the
recruit is able to make good groups on the 30-yards range.

4. Selecting Rifles for Recruits.
—(i) Before the instruction
of recruits in aiming and firing commences they must
be fitted with rifles having long, normal, or short butts,
according to the build and preference of the men. The
choice should be made after tests carried out in the standing
and lying positions, and should be based on the readiness
with which the firer brings his rifle up to the firing position,
and aligns his sights without letting his nose and mouth
come into close proximity to the thumb and fingers of the
right hand.

(ii) The principal consideration is
the distance of the nose
from the shoulder
, and it is as a rule the broad-shouldered
and long-necked men that require the long butts. A bad
trigger release, due to incorrect holding of the small of the
butt, will often result from the use of too short a butt.

The butt selected should be the shortest which can be used
comfortably when firing, both standing and lying down, in
the correct positions.
These rules for fitting rifles of course
apply also to non-commissioned officers.

5. Sights.
—Special care must be taken that
the sights of
any rifle used in aiming instruction are in perfect order
.
Instructors must inspect the sights frequently to insure that
they are
correctly adjusted
in accordance with his orders.

47

6. Appliances for Aiming and Firing Instruction.
—(i)
The following appliances will be needed by instructors:

(
a
) Diagrams showing position of sights correctly and
incorrectly aligned.

(
b
) The Legret aim-teacher.

(
c
) Aim-corrector.

(
d
) Aiming-disc.

(
e
) Aiming-rest.

(
f
) Firing-rest.

(
g
) Charger and dummy cartridges.

(
h
) Measuring rings [see Sec. 49, para. 6 (xi)].

Note.
—
The method of using the aim-teacher, aim-corrector,
and aiming disc, and grouping gauges is described in the
Appendix. Aiming- and firing-rests are described in
âMusketry Regulations,â Part II.

(ii)
Aiming Marks.
—(i) The aiming marks to be used in aiming
instruction will consist of elementary bullâs-eye targets
for the early stage of instruction, and of a variety of figure
targets similar to those used for firing practices for later
stages.

(ii) When the habit of accuracy has been acquired in
aiming at elementary targets, service targets will only be used
and care will be taken that there is no falling off in accuracy
owing to the shape and comparative invisibility of these
targets. A list of figures for use on miniature ranges will be
found in the Appendix, VII, para. 5.

Section
16
.—Aiming Instruction.

1. Rules for Aiming.
—The instructor will explain the
following rules, and demonstrate the results to be anticipated
from common errors in aiming:

(i) The backsight must be kept upright.

48

(ii) The left or right eye, according to the shoulder from
which the man shoots, must be closed.
10

(iii) Aim must be taken by aligning the sights on the
centre of the lowest part of the mark, the top of the foresight
being in the centre of, and in line with, the shoulders
of the
U
or
V
of the backsight (
Fig. 11
).

Correct

Incorrect

Fig. 11.
—
Diagrams showing Correct and Incorrect
Alignment of Sights.

Note.
—The low point of aim is essential in firing at
service targets, as it facilitates a clear view of marks which
are usually difficult to discern, and also because service
targets are frequently in movement towards the firer, thus
necessitating aiming down to alter elevation owing to their
decreasing distance.

2. Method of Instruction.
—(i) When these principles
have been mastered, the instructor will loosen the sling of
the rifle, adjust the sights for any given range, and aim from
a rest at the target, taking care that
his eye is immediately
above the butt-plate
. It will be convenient to use a sandbag
aiming-rest to steady the head during the aiming.

(ii) Having aimed, he will make each recruit observe the
correct method of aligning the sights on a mark. Each
recruit in turn will then be made to align the sights on a

49

mark, after which the instructor will verify his aim, point
out errors, and explain how they would have affected the
accuracy of the shot, and how they are to be avoided.
For example,
Fig. 11
shows incorrect sighting, the rifle being
inclined to the right, aimed to the right, and aimed too
low, the top of the foresight being well below and to one
side of, instead of in the centre of and in line with, the
shoulders of the
U
of the backsight. The obvious result of
these errors would be to fire low to the right of the mark.

Fig. 12.
—
Long-Range Sights.

(iii) The instructor should also make recruits verify their
comradesâ aim under his supervision as above described,
and point out any errors which may have been made.

Extreme accuracy of aim must be insisted on even during the
first lesson.

(iv)
Long-Range Sights.
—In aiming with the long-range sights
a similar procedure to that which is described above will be
pursued, but the eye will be placed
about 1 inch behind the
small of the butt
, and the top of the head of the dial sight
will be seen in the centre of the aperture (
Fig. 12
).

Unless special care is taken, lateral error will be made in
centring the head of the dial sight.

50

Section
17
.—Common Faults in Aiming.

1. Taking too much or too little Foresight into the U or V
of the Backsight.
—(i) It should be explained that a fine or
half sight will cause the bullet to strike with Mark VI
ammunition about 5 inches and 3 inches lower respectively,
and with Mark VII 7 inches and 4 inches lower respectively
per 100 yards of range, than when the correct sight
is taken.

(ii) The following method will be found useful to guide the
soldier in taking the correct amount of foresight: Lay the
edge of a piece of paper on the upper edge of the backsight
cap, when the sight will appear as shown in one of the subjoined
diagrams. A piece of cardboard laid on the cap and
held in place by an elastic band will answer the same
purpose.

Incorrect:

Too much

foresight.

Incorrect:

Too little

foresight.

Correct

Fig. 13.
—
Faults in Aiming.

2. Inaccurate Centring of the Foresight in the Notch of
the Backsight.
—The soldier should understand that this
inaccuracy will deflect the muzzle of the rifle to the side on
which the line of aim is taken. For example, if aim be
taken over the right edge of the notch the direction of the
line of fire will be to the right of the line of sight.

3. Inclining the Backsight to one Side.
—In this case the
bullet will strike low and to the side towards which the
sights are inclined. The resulting error will be considerable
at long ranges.

51

4. Fixing the Eyes on the Foresight and not on the
Object.
—(i) If the eye is focussed on the foresight, the firer

will retain only a blurred image of the target
. This may not
affect the result of his shooting at the distinct stationary
bullâs-eye target, but when firing at troops in neutral-tinted
uniforms, whether stationary or in movement, or at natural
features of ground,
it is essential for fire effect that the eye
should be focussed not on the foresight, but on the target, which
must be watched closely while firing
.
11

(ii) Unless service targets are closely watched while aiming,
the firer will be apt to lose them altogether, or see
them as a blurred image at the moment of firing, with
consequent loss of fire effect. For this reason it is of great
importance that recruits should, from the earliest stage of
their training, be taught to aim at service targets
with the
eye focussed on the target
, and not on the foresight. If
early stages of instruction were confined to the aiming at
the bullâs-eye target, the fault of focussing the eye on the
foresight in aiming might be contracted owing to the distinct
nature of this mark, which makes it possible to aim at
it with the eye fixed on the foresight. (
See Appendix, VII.
,
para. 2.)

Section
18
.—Triangle of Error.

1.
The following method of recording a triangle of error
will be employed to test proficiency in aiming, and to
demonstrate the errors which will arise from inaccuracies.

2.
The rifle will be placed on an aiming-rest, and pointed
at a sheet of blank white paper, fixed to any convenient
object at a distance of about 10 yards from the muzzle. A
second aiming-rest should be used to steady the head in
aiming.

52

3.
A marker will hold an aiming-disc flat on the paper,
the front facing the instructor. The instructor will align
the sights on it correctly, and its position on the paper will
then be marked by a dot made with a pencil passed through
the hole in its centre.

4.
Each man in succession will then be called up and
ordered to look along the sights, but without touching the
rifle, and when he has satisfied himself as to the correctness
of the aim, the disc will be removed. It will then be replaced
on the paper as before, and moved at his direction
until the lower edge of the bullâs-eye is brought into the line
of sight, when its position will be marked as before. This
operation will be repeated three times in the case of each
man, and the points thus fixed will be joined in such a
way as to form a triangle.

B.
Horizontal

A.
Vertical

Fig. 14.
—
Triangle of Error

5.
The position of these points in relation to the
instructorâs
aim
will expose any constant error in aiming. If
the recruitâs aim is below that of the instructor, it shows
that he has taken too full a sight; if above, that his sighting
has been too fine; if to the right, that the foresight was on
the left of a perpendicular drawn through the centre of the
notch; if to the left,
vice versa
.

6.
The position of the points in regard
to one another
will
show
inconsistency
. If the triangle is formed so that its
greatest side lies vertically on the paper, it proves that
the soldierâs principal fault is inconsistency in respect of

53

the amount of foresight taken up into the line of sight

(
Fig. 14
, A); if the greatest side of the triangle lies horizontally
it shows that his principal error is
inaccurate
centring of the foresight
(
Fig. 14
, B).

7.
If any one of the sides of the triangle exceeds â
 inch
from the instructorâs aim, the recruit will be noted for
further instruction.

8. Aim-Corrector.
—The aim-corrector will also be used to
enable the instructor to supervise the soldierâs methods
and test his progress, the aim being taken from an aiming or
firing rest.

Section
19
.—Aiming at Service Targets, Aiming at
Ground, and Marking Down the Enemy.

1. Aiming at Service Targets.
—From an early stage in his
instruction the soldierâs eye must be trained to discern and
aim at service targets. Elementary instruction may be
carried out in barracks, on the range, on ground in the
vicinity of barracks, or on miniature ranges. Figures should
be used representing men in the various firing positions
at different distances in the open, or partly behind cover.

2. Aiming at Ground.
—(i) Service targets will frequently
consist of ground or cover occupied by the enemy. Fire-unit
commanders will verbally indicate such targets to
men, who must be trained to recognize and fire at them.
This training should be carried out concurrently with
instruction in aiming at figures and marking down the
enemy—the latter practices to some extent will also train
men to aim at ground.

(ii) Practice in aiming at ground may be carried out on
miniature ranges, as described in Sec. 72, para. 2 (i), as well
as in open country. It must always be carried out under
practical conditions, and will include aiming at various ill-defined

54

targets, such as a spot on a bare hillside or a stretch
of grass-land. Targets will be indicated verbally by the
instructor, and recruits will aim at them with rifles on
aiming-rests. The instructor will then criticize each manâs
aim and correct faults. Practice in aiming at ground will
prove a useful preparation for training in recognition of
targets (Sec. 45) and fire discipline (Sec. 47).

3. Marking down the Enemy.
—(i) It is of the utmost
importance that soldiers should be trained to mark down
the exact position of an enemy seen to occupy ground or
cover. This duty refers equally to individual enemies at
close range and to hostile troops at longer ranges. Individual
soldiers will mark down the enemy within close
range, and fire-unit commanders and observers at longer
ranges. If the position marked down affords concealment
from view without protection from fire, fire may be opened
after the range has been ascertained or estimated. If it
affords protection from fire, the range should be ascertained
or estimated, and fire-units or individual men should
remain ready to open fire the instant the enemy exposes
himself or resumes movement. Delay in opening fire in
the latter case will lead to the loss of a favourable opportunity
(see Practices, Nos. 3 and 4,
pp. 217
,
218
).

(ii)
Method of Instruction.
—Instruction will best be carried
out on the ground or on the miniature range as described
in Chapter X. When carried out on the ground a fatigue-man
will be sent out to the front, and directed to move from
cover to cover to the front of the class which will be
provided with rifles on aiming-rests. At each halt, when
the fatigue-man has taken cover, recruits will note the
point on the ground or cover which conceals him, and take
aim at it. After an arranged interval the fatigue-man will
expose himself to view, and remain stationary while the
instructor criticizes each manâs aim and corrects faults.

55

Section
20
.—Aiming-Off for Wind.

1. The Wind-Gauge.
—
The use of the wind-gauge is not
the normal means of making allowance for wind under service
conditions.

2. Judging Strength and Direction of Wind.
—The soldier
should be taught to discriminate between mild, fresh, and
strong winds, or winds blowing ten, twenty, or thirty miles
an hour. The strength of the wind may be judged partly
by sensation and partly by its effect on natural objects,
such as clouds, water, trees, crops, hedges, bushes, undergrowth,
dust, and smoke. The soldier may judge the direction
of the wind, as front, rear, side, or oblique, by turning
his face fully towards the wind.

3. Wind Deflection Table for Side Winds
(
Right-Angle Winds
).—The
following figures give the approximate deflection of
the bullet due to winds of varying direction and velocity
at different ranges, and provide a rough guide for aiming-off
for wind which is sufficiently accurate for practical
purposes:

Range.

56

Note—Oblique Winds.
—For oblique winds the approximate
deflection at the above ranges may roughly be estimated
as
half that of a side wind of the same velocity
and allowance
in aiming-off may be made accordingly.

4. Exercises in Aiming-Off.
—(i) Having memorized the
approximate allowances for side and oblique winds of
varying direction and velocity, as stated in para. 3, the
recruit will next be taught to make allowance in aiming-off
for wind at a full-length figure target on the range,
according to the strength and direction of the wind which
is actually blowing, or which may be supposed to be blowing,
as given by the instructor. In carrying out these exercises
the recruit should be taught to aim-off with reference to the
breadth of a full-length figure target, which is rather less
than 2 feet wide. Thus the amount of allowance will be
measured as one breadth, two breadths, etc., to right or left.

5. Orders for Aiming-Off.
—Finally, the recruit must be
exercised in aiming-off at all ranges according to orders, the
amount of allowance being given as so many times the
breadth of the target indicated, or so many times the width
of the intervals between targets consisting of close formations.
The amount of allowance may also be indicated
by the use of auxiliary aiming or description points (Sec. 45),
as, for instance, a tree or bush, the lateral distance of which
from the target equals approximately the required allowance.
When none of these methods of indicating allowances
are possible men must be taught to aim-off so many feet or
yards to the right or left of the target, these measurements
being taken as representing the lateral distance between the
sight of the rifle and the target aimed at.

6. Method of Indicating Errors.
—In aiming-off exercises
it is necessary to employ a fatigue-man at the target to
indicate the correct point of aim with a marking-disc
after

each aim taken by the recruit, which to commence with
should be done with a rifle on an aiming-rest. He will

57

carry out the duty according to previous instructions as
to the correct point of aim for each exercise. The amount
of allowance made by the recruit will be observed by the
instructor with an aim-corrector, unless an aiming-rest is
used. The recruit will be made to note his errors, which
will be criticized by the instructor.

7. Instruction on Miniature Ranges.
—Instruction in
aiming-off can be carried out on miniature ranges, as
described in Chapter X (see Practice No. 2, p. 227).

Section
21
.—Aiming Up and Down.

1. When to Aim Up and Down.
—The rifle will be aimed
up or down to increase or reduce elevation at all ranges when
there is no time to alter sights, as, for example, in firing at
targets in movement, in repulsing a charge at close range,
in case of surprise, when very slight alterations of elevation
are seen to be necessary, as the result of observation of
fire, and to avoid frequent small changes of sighting which
lead to loss of fire effect.
Correction of sighting in individual
firing at close range is seldom possible in war. Therefore
aiming up and down is the normal means of altering
elevation in firing at targets within close range.

2. Rules for Aiming Up and Down.
—There is no fixed rule
for aiming up and down. As a general rule aim should be
directed at a point not more than 3 feet above or below
the six oâclock line, according to the position of the target
beyond or short of the zone for which the sights are set.
The degree of allowance in aiming up and down will depend
on the rate and direction of movement and the range of the
target, and will be a matter for individual judgment.
If the
difference between the range and the sighting exceeds 200 yards
it will be best to alter the sighting.

3. Exercises in Aiming Up and Down.
—To practise aiming
up and down, under conditions approximating to those of

58

service, the sights should first be fixed for a given range, and
then fatigue-men or standing-figure disappearing targets disposed
at various ranges should be alternately brought into
view for short periods of time, representing troops in movement.
Men should be told whether targets represent retreating
or advancing troops, and aim up or down accordingly.
Aim maybe criticized by using aiming-rests or aim-correctors.

Section
22
.—Aiming-Off for Movement.

1. Instruction.
—Instruction in aiming at moving targets
will be carried out during the latter portion of preliminary
training. It will consist of practice in shooting at
crossing targets on 30 yards or miniature ranges (see
Chapter X). The pace of movement should be regulated as
far as possible in strict accordance with that of service
targets (see Practice No. 2, p. 217).

2. Crossing Targets.
—This term is applied to targets
moving across the front of the firer, either at right angles
from either side, or obliquely towards or away from him to
either side. Such targets are not as a rule met with in battle
except in the case of surprise, ambush, or a sudden
encounter. Crossing targets may be met with by cavalry
and infantry patrols, and by scouts during reconnaissance.

Fire will rarely be effective at a single man moving across the
front at more than 300 yards range, or at a single horseman
beyond 500 yards.

3. Method of Aiming at Crossing Target.
—(i) When firing
at crossing targets aim will first be taken on the object.
Then, following it sideways, the aim will be carried in
advance of the object, and kept in front of it at the desired
distance until the rifle has been fired. The distance to
which aim should be carried in advance of the target will
vary according to the range, rate of movement, direction of
movement and wind. For this reason no fixed rules can be

59

laid down regarding aiming-off in firing at crossing targets.
Fire effect will depend upon the judgment of individual
men and fire-unit commanders, and on the fruits of practical
experience.

4. Rules for Aiming-Off for Movement
—(i)
Targets crossing
Front at Right-Angles.
—The following general rules will serve
as a guide in firing at crossing targets at close range
moving
at right-angles across the firerâs front
.

(
a
) Up to 500 yards range, aim should be taken—

About 1 foot in front per 100 yards at a single man walking.

About 2 feet in front per 100 yards at a single man doubling.

About 3 feet in front per 100 yards at a single horseman
trotting.

About 4 feet in front per 100 yards at a single horseman
galloping.

Thus, at 100 yards a soldier should aim about the breadth
of a man in front of an individual walking, and at 200 yards
about a horse-length in front of a single horseman trotting.

(
b
) Beyond close range aim should be taken
at the head
of a body of troops moving to a flank
.

(ii)
Targets crossing Front Obliquely.
—The general rules regarding
aiming up and down laid down in Sec. 21, para. 2, apply
also to crossing targets moving obliquely towards or away
from the firer.
In firing at such targets, allowance must be
made for elevation as well as for aiming-off.
At short range
both allowances will be made by individual men. At longer
ranges men will allow for aiming up and down, and when
necessary fire-unit commanders will allow for aiming-off in
fire orders.

(iii)
Targets moving directly Towards or Away from the Firer.
—In
aiming at an object moving
directly
towards or away from
the firer, allowance for elevation will usually be made
by
aiming up or down
—not by waiting to alter sights (Sec. 21,
paras. 1 and 2).

60

Section
23
.—Practice in Rapid Adjustment of
Sights.
12

1.
This instruction should be carried out concurrently
with instruction in loading in the various firing positions.
Frequent small changes of sighting lead as a rule to loss
of fire effect, and may be avoided by aiming up or down.

But when there is time the sights will be adjusted for every
alteration in the range, and aim will be taken at the lowest
part of the mark.
It is essential that men should be trained
to adjust their sights accurately and rapidly, and that this
power should become to all intents and purposes instinctive,
so that this vitally important duty on which fire effect in a
large measure depends will be carried out by the soldier
with certainty in moments of the most extreme stress
and excitement.

2. Training in Rapid Adjustment.
—Instructors will frequently
test their squads in setting their sights rapidly and
accurately. They will give orders for aiming or firing at
definite targets, but without naming the range, and require
their squads to adjust their sights before they bring the
rifle to the shoulder, judging the distance for themselves,
which will help to make the careful adjustment of sights,
which is essential for fire effect, habitual to the soldier.
Adjustment of sights will also be practised under the same
conditions in connection with the movement of the firer
or the target, represented by fatigue-men.

3. Rules for Adjusting Sights.
—(i)
To Adjust the Backsight.
—Hold
the rifle in the loading position (Sec. 27), so that the
lines on the backsight can be seen clearly. Press in the
stud (or studs) on the side of the slide with the left or
right hand; move the slide until the line is even with the

61

place on the leaf giving the elevation for the distance
named, taking care that it is firmly fixed.
Charger-Loading
Lee-Enfield Rifle.
—Loosen the clamping screw with the
thumb and forefinger of the right hand, move the slide
until the top is even with the line on the leaf giving the
elevation for the distance named, and then tighten the
clamping-screw.

(ii)
To Lower the Backsight.
—Press the stud or studs inwards
with the left or right hand, and draw the slide backwards
as far as possible.
Charger-Loading Lee-Enfield Rifle.
—Loosen
the clamping-screw, lower the slide to the bottom
of the leaf with the firefinger and thumb of the right hand,
then tighten the clamping-screw.

(iii)
Fine Adjustment of the Backsight.
—(

)
S.M.L.E. Rifle,
Marks III and IV.
—Press the stud on the slide with the
thumb of the left hand till the worm-wheel can be easily
revolved; turn the worm-wheel with the thumb-nail of the
right hand until the required elevation is obtained. The
stud must not be pressed to such an extent that the worm-wheel
is entirely disengaged from the rack.

(
b
)
Other Marks.
—Turn the fine adjustment screw with
the forefinger and thumb of the right hand until the line
on the leaf is level with the line on the fine adjustment
scale giving the required elevation.

(iv)
To Adjust the Long-Range Sights.
—Hold the rifle in the
loading position, so that the dial can be seen clearly. Move
the pointer to the place on the dial giving the elevation for
the distance named, and then raise the aperture sight.

CHAPTER IV

ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION IN FIRING

Section
24
.—Hints to Instructors.

1.
Instructors will teach by force of example rather
than by word of mouth, and be careful to refrain from any
form of comment which may discourage young soldiers.
Words of command are seldom required except in collective
firing instruction, all motions of firing being performed
independently, and each man being required to use his own
judgment as much as possible. Faults must not, however,
be overlooked or allowed to become formed habits.
The
essential points of the firing positions are to be insisted upon
from the beginning, as the foundation of fire discipline.

2.
In the early part of training squads will not as a rule
consist of more than seven men, who will be assembled
round the instructor in a semicircle. The instructor will
explain the uses of the different firing positions and illustrate
them to the squad. Recruits will practise the motions
separately until able to combine them, and
assume each
position rapidly and without constraint
.

3
. The position of each individual will be corrected in
turn. The regulation positions may be varied if physical
characteristics render them unsuitable in any case, but
awkwardness in the first stages of instruction will not be
accepted as an indication that the regulation position
requires modification. The instructor should stand about
five paces from the recruit and to his right front while correcting
his faults.

4.
The firing-rest will be employed frequently in early
instruction to enable the recruit to support the rifle and

63

rest his muscles, whilst the instructor modifies, or corrects,
his position. An incorrect position, however, usually arises
from want of accuracy in the preliminary actions which
lead to it, and it is to these that attention must be given,
for a faulty position once acquired cannot easily be corrected.

5.
With regard to the firing positions, the standing
position is a convenient one to commence elementary
instruction. When recruits have acquired facility in
handling the rifle, they will be trained for the most part
in the lying position, either in the open or behind cover,
and occasionally in the kneeling position behind cover.

6. Progression of Training.
—Elementary instruction in
firing will be divided into the following stages:

(i) Trigger-pressing from aiming-rest.

(ii) Snapping from aiming-rest.

(iii) Assuming the various firing positions.

(iv) Loading and unloading in the various firing positions.

(v) Aiming and firing in the various firing positions in
the open, including loading, adjusting sights, and
unloading.

(vi) As in (v), with the various firing positions adapted
to different forms of cover.

(vii) Muscle exercises.

Section
25
.—Trigger-Pressing and Snapping.

1. Importance of Trigger-Pressing.
—(i) Instruction in
firing will commence with training in pressing the trigger.
The vital importance of performing this action correctly
must be impressed upon recruits. They must understand
that, however carefully and accurately the rifle is aimed,
accurate shooting is impossible if trigger-pressing is faulty,
as aim will be disturbed at the moment of discharge.
Faultless trigger-pressing is absolutely essential for accurate
firing.

64

2. Need for Mental Effort.
—Trigger-pressing requires
most careful individual instruction, during which the necessity
for determination and strong personal effort of will will
be impressed on the mind of every recruit. The power of
concentrating the mind and controlling the nerves and
muscles by exercising the will are all developed by practice
in trigger-pressing, and these qualities of character are
essential for good shooting and for fire discipline.

3. Rules for Trigger-Pressing.
—(i) The trigger of the
S.M.L.E.rifle has a double pull-off, and two distinct pressures
are necessary to fire the rifle. The first pull should be taken
when the rifle has been brought into position for aiming;
the second when the sights are aligned on the mark. The
charger-loading Lee-Enfield rifle has a single pull-off.

Fig. 15.
—
Method of Pressing Trigger with Forefinger.

(ii) The direction of the pull-off is diagonally across the
small of the butt. The first joint of the forefinger should
be placed round the
lower
part of the trigger (
Fig. 15
). In
order not to disturb the aim
breathing must be restrained
when pressing the trigger. In firing the trigger must be
pressed so as to release the cocking-piece without disturbing aim.

(iii) To do this
a gradually increasing pressure
must be
exerted on the trigger until the spring is released. Such
pressure will be facilitated if the grip of the trigger hand
on the rifle is strengthened slightly, as though to oppose
the inward pressure of the trigger finger with an equal
gradual counter-pressure. This will give the whole action
the effect of a squeeze with the hand, of which the pressure
of the trigger finger is the most important part—the part
on which the mind must be concentrated.
On no account

65

must the pressure of the finger in any degree take the form of
a pull or jerk.

(iv)
Fig. 16
shows the results of faulty trigger-pressing in
firing. The trigger has been pulled or jerked to the left
instead of being properly pressed, and the grouping of shots—low
to the right—shows how aim has been disturbed in
consequence.

4. Method of Instruction.
—(i) The rifle will be rested on
sandbags (
Fig. 17
), or an aiming-rest, and the recruit will
be seated with his elbows rested on a table. The instructor
will first see that the recruit can
move his trigger-finger
independently of the remainder of the hand and arm
, if
necessary, by making him practise this action.

Fig. 16.
—
Shot Group illustrating Result of Faulty
Trigger-Pressing.

(ii) In order that he may learn from experience the
pressure required to release the cocking-piece, the soldier
in commencing instruction in trigger-pressing, will be
directed to place his forefinger under that of the instructor,
but without exercising pressure, whilst the instructor

66

carries out the motion (
Fig. 18
). Then, to enable the
instructor to ascertain whether the method is understood,
the soldier will place his finger over that of the instructor,
and exert the pressure. Finally, the soldier will himself
press the trigger, while the instructor uses the aim-corrector
to see that aim is not disturbed when the trigger is pressed.
Special care will be taken that the
breathing is restrained
while pressing the trigger. The use of the sling for steadying
the rifle during firing is not to be taught.

5. Declaring the Point of Aim.
—The recruit must always
be made to say after the spring is released whether the
aim was maintained truly at the moment of snapping. If
not, he must state definitely the direction in which the
rifle was pointed at the moment of discharge. By this
means recruits will find out and correct their own faults,
and the contraction of bad habits will be avoided.

6. Tests of Trigger-Pressing and Snapping.
—From time
to time the instructor will test the aim and steadiness of
each recruit in trigger-pressing and snapping with an aim-corrector
or an aiming-disc (
Fig. 19
). If necessary, further
lessons in trigger-pressing will be given. Progress should
also be tested from time to time by grouping practice on
the miniature range or 30 yards range. These practices
will help to develop steadiness until range practice is begun.
Daily practice in snapping is necessary for trained soldiers
as well as for recruits.

Section
26
.—The Various Firing Positions.

1. Vulnerability of Different Firing Positions.
—In the
open up to 1,000 yards the lying position will usually
prove the least vulnerable to the effects of both rifle and
artillery fire, as it is the most difficult to discern and exposes
the smallest surface to fire. As a rule, the lying position
is also the least vulnerable to the effects of rifle fire at

67

all ranges. On the other hand, it is more vulnerable to the
effects of shrapnel in the open than the kneeling or sitting
positions. The use of entrenchments, however, whenever
possible, usually obviates the necessity for assuming the
lying position in the open in attacking a strongly-held
defensive position.

2. Left elbow well under rifle.

3. Good bed for the butt.

4. Firm grip with both hands.

5. Eye well back from the cocking-piece.

6. Sights perfectly upright.

2. Need for Avoiding Unnecessary Movement.
—Recruits
will be trained to assume the various firing positions rapidly,
and to perform the loading and aiming motions with as
little movement as possible. All unnecessary movement
in performing these motions must be avoided, especially
in the open, as movement attracts the eye and tends to
betray the position of targets which, when stationary,
would be invisible or extremely difficult to discern.

3. Standing Position
(Figs. 20 and 21).—(i) The standing
position will, as a rule, be used on service to fire from breastworks,
high walls, and cover, such as long grass or standing
corn, or to take a snap-shot when advancing, so that the
pace of the advance is not materially checked. For the
height over which a man can fire standing see Sec. 31,
para. 2.

(ii)
Rules for the Standing Position.
—Body turned half right,
left foot carried to the left and slightly forward, so that
the body is erect and well-balanced, left elbow well under
the rifle, the butt well into the hollow of the shoulder, rifle
gripped firmly with both hands, eye well back from the
cocking-piece, sights perfectly upright.

4. Lying Position
(
Fig. 22
).—(i) The lying position will
generally be adopted by troops on open ground, or when
firing from continuous low cover, or from behind small
rocks, trees, etc. Preliminary instruction in firing and
firing exercises will, as a rule, be carried out in the lying
position as being the most convenient.

(ii) Other conditions being equal, this position has the
advantage that its use in firing results in a greater extent

68

of dangerous space than in the case of other firing positions
[Sec. 9, para. 2 (ii)].

(iii)
Rules for Firing In the Lying Position.
—Turn half right, bring
the rifle to the right side as when standing, holding it in
the left hand. Place the right hand on the ground, and lie
down on the stomach with the legs separated, left shoulder
well forward, left arm extended to the front, and rifle resting
in the left hand in a convenient position, muzzle pointing
to the front and clear of mud or dust on the ground.
The line of the body may be slightly oblique to the line of
fire,
but this oblique angle must not be exaggerated, as it will
tend to increase vulnerability by presenting a greater surface
to the enemyâs fire than when the body is parallel to the line
of fire
(see
Fig. 30
).

(iv)
Adjusting Sights.
—To adjust sights in the lying position
draw the rifle back with the left hand until the lines on the
backsight can be seen clearly. In the case of S.M.L.E.
and Charger-loading Lee-Enfield rifles, draw the rifle back
through the left hand.

(v)
Height of Rifle above Ground.
—For the height over which
a man in the lying position can fire see Sec. 31, para. 2.
If it is necessary for improving the field of fire and obtaining
better fire effect to increase the height of the body above
ground, this can be done by raising it on the elbows and at
the same time slightly retiring it.

5. Kneeling Position
(Figs. 23 and 24).—(i) The kneeling
position is used mainly when firing from continuous cover,
such as a low wall, bank, or hedge, or in long grass, crops,
etc., which would obstruct the line of sight if the prone
position were adopted. For the height over which a man
in the kneeling position can fire see Sec. 31, para. 2.

(ii)
Rules for Firing in the Kneeling Position.
—The soldier may
kneel on either or both knees. When kneeling on one knee
the body may be supported on the heel, or not, as desired.
The left knee will be in advance of the left heel, and the left

69

elbow will rest on or over the left knee. The left leg, hand,
and arm, and the right shoulder, should be in the same
vertical plane when firing in the open kneeling on the right
knee. When kneeling on both knees, the body may rest
on both heels, or be kept upright to suit the height of the
cover, the elbows in both instances being unsupported by
the body.

Fig. 26
—
Sitting Position when Firing—Aiming down
Steep Slope.

6. Sitting Position
(Figs. 25 and 26).—The sitting position
will be the most suitable when on ground falling at a steep
slope. In this position the right shoulder should be kept
well back, the left forearm supported by the thigh, and
the right elbow resting against the right knee, or unsupported,
as desired.

Section
27
.—Loading and Unloading.

1. To Load
(
Fig. 27
).
13
—(i) Bring the rifle to the right
side in front of the hip, with the muzzle pointing upwards,
small of the butt just in front of the hip, grasping the stock
with the left hand immediately in front of the magazine.
Turn the safety-catch completely over to the front with the
thumb or forefinger of the right hand. (
Charger-loading
Lee-Enfield Rifle.
—Lower the safety-catch with the thumb
of the right hand.)

(ii) Pull out the cut-off if closed, first pressing it downwards
with the thumb, then seize the knob with the forefinger
and thumb of the right hand, turn it sharply upwards,
and draw back the bolt to its full extent.

(iii) Take the charger between the thumb and first two
fingers of the right hand, and place it vertically in the
guides. Then, placing the ball of the thumb immediately
in front of the charger, and hooking the forefinger under

70

the cut-off, force the cartridges down with a firm and
continuous pressure until the top cartridge has engaged in
the magazine. Force the bolt sharply home, turning the
knob well down, and, with the thumb or forefinger of the
right hand, turn the safety-catch completely over to the
rear. (
Charger-loading Lee-Enfield Rifle.
—Raise the safety-catch
with the forefinger of the right hand.) Then button
the pouch, seize the rifle with the right hand in front of the
left, bring the left foot back to the right and order arms.

(iv)
Loading the Magazine.
—The magazine will hold two
charges of five cartridges each, but should in ordinary
circumstances be loaded with one only, as the soldier will
thus retain the power of adding another charge at any time
should necessity demand. If, when on the line of march,
it is desired to charge the magazine without loading the
rifle, the top cartridge may be pressed downwards with
the thumb and the cut-off closed.
After the rifle is once
charged the soldier is responsible that his magazine is refilled at
once whenever it has been emptied.

4. To Unload.
—Carry out the directions in para, 1 (i) and
(ii), but after drawing back the bolt, without turning the
knob down, work the bolt rapidly backwards and forwards
until the cartridges are removed from the magazine and
chamber, allowing them to fall on the ground. Then close
the breech, press the trigger, close the cut-off by placing
the right hand over the bolt and pressing the cut-off inwards,
apply the safety-catch, lower the backsight or the
long-range sights, and order arms.

5. Rapid Loading.
—(i) When he is able to aim and fire
steadily in all positions and from various classes of cover,
the soldier will be exercised in combining rapid loading with
the greatest rapidity of aim consistent with accuracy.
Rapid loading will first be practised separately, using
dummy cartridges in chargers. When five rounds have
been inserted in the magazine, the bolt will be closed and

71

turned over, and the rifle will at once be unloaded and
another charger inserted similarly. Rapid loading should
be practised in all positions, but especially in the lying
position.

Fig. 27.
—
Loading in Standing Position.

Points to note
:

1. Body erect and well balanced.

2. Left elbow close to body.

3. Firm grip with left hand, close in front of magazine.

4. Muzzle pointing upwards.

5. Butt well forward.

6. Forefinger of the right hand under the cut-off.

7. Eyes on the mark.

Fig. 28.
—
Firing in the Open. Heads lowered;
Observer watching Front.

(ii)
Rapid Firing.
—The rate of firing should be increased
gradually, provided that faults of aiming and trigger-pressing
are not acquired. Short bursts of rapid fire only will
be permitted, the firing being carefully regulated and controlled.
A target will always be indicated.

6. Caution.
—Before dummy cartridges are used on
parade, special precautions will be taken to insure that
neither ball nor blank ammunition is taken to the parade
ground.
The instructor will personally examine all cartridges,
rifles, pouches, and bandoliers, before loading takes
place.

Section
28
.—Use of the Safety-Catch and Cut-Off.

1.
Troops armed with rifles fitted with safety-catches
will invariably set the catch to safety before movement.
The use of the cut-off is to be confined in their case to
occasions when they are not actually engaged with the
enemy. Then it may be employed for the purpose either
of charging the magazine without inserting a cartridge in
the chamber, or to unload the rifle while retaining cartridges
in the magazine.

2.
The cut-off is never to be used to enable the rifle to
be used as a single loader, and is not to supersede the use
of the safety-catch. In the case of rifles which have no
safety-catches, the cut-off will be pressed in and the rifle
unloaded on all occasions when the safety-catch is ordered
to be applied in these instructions. In an advance in
extended order, however, these rifles may be carried during
movement at the slope instead of being unloaded.

72

Section
29
.—Instruction in Aiming and Firing.

1. Rules for Aiming and Firing.
—(i) The rules for taking
accurate aim have already been stated. In combining aiming
with the movements for firing in the various firing positions
the following rules will be observed:

(ii) Direct the eyes on the mark. Then bring the rifle into
the hollow of the right shoulder, and press it in with the left
hand, grasp the small firmly with the thumb and three
fingers of the right hand, place the forefinger round the
lower part of the trigger, and exert sufficient pressure to
take the pull. In making these motions, the backsight will
be kept upright, the left elbow brought well under the rifle,
and the right elbow brought a little lower than and well to
the front of the right shoulder.

(iii) As the rifle touches the shoulder, bring the cheek
down on the butt, keeping the face well back from the right
hand and cocking-piece, close the left eye, align the sights
on the mark,
restrain the breathing
, and press the trigger.

(iv)
Great care must be exercised to insure that the forefinger
is not placed on the trigger before the rifle is in contact with
the shoulder, and that a firm grip is maintained with both
hands while firing. Unless the butt rests firmly in the hollow
of the shoulder, accurate shooting is impossible.

(v)
The further the eye is kept from the backsight the more
clearly will the sights be defined, the less strained will be the
position of the head and neck, and the less will be the effect of
recoil.

2. Aiming and Firing Practices.
—In aiming and firing
practices, the firer should always declare the direction of
his aim at the moment of discharge before removing the
rifle from the shoulder for the reasons given in Sec. 25,
para. 5. The instructor will carefully supervise practices,
and will test the accuracy of aiming with the aim-corrector

73

or aiming-disc. Having carried out the motions
described in paras, (ii) and (iii) above, the recruit after a
pause will bring the rifle to the loading position, and practise
the motions again, or he will apply the safety catch
and order arms, according to the orders of the instructor.

Section
30
.—Firing in the Open.

1.
The need for avoiding unnecessary movements in assuming
the various firing positions in loading and aiming
will have been impressed upon recruits during their
instruction in the firing positions and loading. Recruits
must be taught that it is especially important to avoid these
unnecessary movements when firing in the open [Sec. 72,
para. 3 (iii)].
In firing in the open, the head should be lowered
in the intervals of firing, but the ground in front must be watched
by selected observers
(
Fig. 28
).

2. Positions in the Open.
—Besides avoiding movements
betraying their position, recruits will be taught to select
positions in the open so as to avoid as far as possible backgrounds
which increase their visibility [Sec. 72, para. 4 (ii)].
They will be taught, as part of their instruction in visual
training, to note the effect of different backgrounds upon the
visibility of service targets. They will learn that concealment
may be possible even in the open without cover, for
troops at longer ranges when not in movement may be
invisible to the naked eye. Individual men, when motionless
in the open, may also be invisible to the naked eye within
close range.

Section
31
.—Firing from Cover.

1. Instruction in the choice and use of ground and its
natural or other features as cover for concealment or protection
from the enemyâs fire, and in adapting the different firing
positions to various forms of cover, will be part of the field

74

training of men at a stage which will combine training in fire
discipline and manÅuvre (see Chapters III. and VI. of
Drill
and Field Training
of this series). Full directions regarding
the choice and use of the ground and its existing features as
cover are contained in Sec. 33
14
of
Drill and Field Training

of this series. Training in the construction and use of hasty
fire-cover, and more elaborate forms of constructed cover,
such as various field entrenchments, are dealt with in
Field
Entrenchments
of this series, which also deals with the preparation
of doors, windows, and buildings, as well as banks,
ditches, etc., to serve as cover. Training in firing in the
different firing positions from behind various common forms
of cover will form part of the elementary instruction of
recruits in firing.

2. Height of Cover for Use in Different Firing Positions.
—The
heights over which a man of average stature can fire on
level ground in the various firing positions are as follows:
Lying, 1 foot; kneeling, 3 feet; standing, 4 feet 6 inches.
On level ground a man can fire over about five-sixths of his
own height. Higher cover can be used when firing uphill than
when firing downhill.

3. Rules for Firing from Cover.
—(i) Instructors must impress
on recruits that the most important requirement in
firing from cover is
the ability of a man to use his rifle to the
best advantage, and that the eyes must be kept on the enemy
between shots
to avoid losing sight of targets. In using cover,
the recruit must be taught to keep as near to the cover as
possible, compatible with ease in firing. He must also be
taught when possible to fire round the side of cover rather than
over it.

(ii)
Adapting Firing Positions to Different Forms of Cover.
—The following
notes and illustrations lay down general rules as to
the correct method of adapting the different firing positions
to various forms of cover commonly found in the field.

(iii)
Isolated Cover.
—Figs. 29 and 30 illustrate the correct and
incorrect methods of using isolated cover.
Fig. 29
shows the
minimum exposure, the whole body being protected by cover.

Fig. 30
shows unnecessary exposure of the head and body,
and also of the legs, owing to the extreme oblique angle
of the body to the line of fire. As a rule isolated cover
should be avoided even if it affords protection from fire, as in
the case of occasional rocks or small mounds of earth,
especially at close ranges, because men, if seen occupying
such cover, can easily be marked down by the enemy, and
hit on leaving it. Rocks may also be dangerous, owing to the
risk of injury from splinters.

(iv)
Continuous Cover
—(
a
)
Ridges and Folds of Ground.
—Figs.
31, 32, and 33 show correct and incorrect methods of
using ridges and folds of ground as cover. These features
commonly provide good cover, especially the latter, which
may be difficult to recognize from a distance. If properly
used, they may afford concealment and protection from the
enemyâs fire, for which as a rule they do not offer well-defined
targets. For instance, the fold of ground in

Fig. 33
would be invisible if it were not indicated by the
menâs heads.

(
b
)
Low Cover.
—Figs. 34 to 38 show the correct and incorrect
methods of using low cover. Figs. 39 to 42 show
correct and incorrect methods of using higher forms of continuous
cover, such as stone and brick walls, banks, etc.
As a rule these forms of cover, whether consisting of hedges,
with or without ditches, banks, or walls, have the disadvantage
of offering well-defined targets to the enemyâs fire
and may, in addition, obstruct the advance of troops occupying
them. Stone and brick cover, in addition, involves the

76

risk of injury through splinters or demolition if subject to
artillery fire.

4. Method of Instruction.
—(i) Instruction should be carried
out under practical conditions. If necessary, different forms
of cover can be improvised by the use of sandbags, hurdles,
boxes, etc. The instructor will give practical illustrations of
the correct method of adapting the different firing positions
to various forms of cover. He will then order each man to
adapt the different firing positions to cover, and criticize
faults, or call on other recruits in the class to criticize them.

(ii) When recruits have progressed sufficiently, they should
be sent out to the front of the class as fatigue-men to make
use of various forms of cover, such as folds of ground, hedges,
ditches, walls, trees, isolated bushes, undergrowth, tufts of
grass, etc., in advancing towards the class. Besides taking
cover, they should go through the loading and aiming motions
as though firing at the class.

(iii) The instructor will make use of these object-lessons
to point out the advantages and disadvantages of various
forms of cover, the correct and incorrect methods of using
cover, and the danger of exaggerated or unnecessary movement
of the head, arms, or rifle in loading and aiming which
tend to betray the position of men or make them easy
to mark down. This instruction can be carried out on
miniature ranges according to the directions laid down in
Chapter X., Sec. 72, para. 3 (iv).

5. Rules for Selecting Cover.
—The following general
rules will help to guide soldiers in selecting cover. They
must remember that in the field the selection of cover may
often involve a choice between alternative disadvantages.
It may not be possible to avoid bad cover or to find good
cover, and it may sometimes be better to use bad cover
than to remain in the open. Soldiers, therefore, must be
taught in the course of their field training to make the best
use of ground and cover under the varying conditions of
each tactical situation.

77

(i)
Good Cover.
—Perfect cover—which, however, will very
rarely be found—will combine the following advantages:

(
a
) Affords a clear view up to the enemyâs position.

(
b
) Permits the free use of the rifle.

(
c
) Gives concealment to the firer.

(
d
) Provides protection for him against the enemyâs fire
without hindering forward movement.

(ii)
Bad Cover
involves any of the following disadvantages:

(
a
) Offers a well-defined target for the enemyâs fire, and
provides no protection from its effects.

(
b
) Gives a restricted view of the enemyâs position.

(
c
) Restricts the free use of the rifle.

(
d
) Obstructs the advance of troops occupying it in
attack.

(iii)
Dangerous Cover.
—Features of ground which offer clearly
defined targets for the enemyâs fire, and afford no protection
from its effects, are dangerous cover if occupied in view of
the enemy, especially if they run parallel to his position.
Common examples of such features are an isolated hedge or
the edge of a wood.

6. Penetration of the Pointed Bullet.
—A table will be
found in the Appendix to
Field Entrenchments
of this series
giving the approximate penetration of the pointed bullet when
firing at various substances. In order to obtain bullet-proof
cover, an extra thickness of substance must be added to these
measurements of penetration. Earth should not be less than
3½ feet thick to afford bullet-proof cover. If the soil is free
from stones, a thickness of 4 feet is desirable.
This thickness
may roughly be measured with a service rifle, 3 feet 8½
inches long.

Section
32.
—Muscle Exercises.

1.
(i) To accustom the muscles to the strain of prolonged
firing the following exercises will be performed daily during

78

the elementary training of recruits, and frequently by trained
soldiers. Care must be taken that men are not unduly
fatigued by the exercises, and that they do not commence
them when they are tired. In each practice, a conspicuous
object, representing the target, will be indicated, and the rifle
will invariably be thrown into approximate alignment with it.

(ii) In the first and third exercises the correct aiming position
will be assumed, including taking the pull, bringing the
cheek on to the butt, and closing the left eye, but without
actually aligning the sights. In the second exercise the first
pull will be taken when the right hand grasps the rifle, but the
head will not be lowered, the left eye will not be closed, nor
will the sights be aligned.

5.
Cadet Muscle Exercises.
—(i) In the case of Cadets, the
above muscle exercises may be carried out with a light
rifle. Alternatively the special exercises for Cadets suggested
in the following paragraph may be carried out in
preference to the second and third Regulation muscle
exercises, the strain of which may develop slowness of
movement in young, growing lads by making the muscular
tissues heavy rather than well-toned. Moreover, the repetition
of these exercises is monotonous, and may cause a
distaste for them in youths. Cadet muscle exercises
which consist of going through the various movements of
assuming the different firing positions, loading, sighting,

aiming
, and pressing the trigger, are therefore suggested
as a substitute for the Regulation muscle exercises. The
introduction of aiming at a mark—preferably a service
target—in the course of muscle exercises will help to develop
the muscles of the eye, together with those of the body
and limbs.

(ii) These exercises have the advantages of occupying the
mind of the cadet while exercising his muscles, and so
diverting attention from the mere repetition of continued
muscular effort, which is wearisome. They avoid the
heavy strain of the third Regulation musketry exercise,
and attain the object of the second—namely, to develop a
firm grip of the hand on the weapon, which is essential to
service shooting, while practising cadets in seizing the
weapon quickly in the proper places. They further embrace
all the muscles used in the act of firing by including
the firing positions and trigger-pressing instead of those

80

used in taking aim alone, and at the same time co-ordinate
them into the quick, active movements essential for snapshooting
and rapid firing.

(iii) Cadets must not be practised at these exercises till
they have been trained to perform correctly the various
movements necessary for assuming the different firing
positions, loading, sighting, bringing the rifle to the
shoulder for aim, and pressing the trigger. They may be
exercised in squads, but the instructor must supervise the
work of each cadet, and be careful to see that all the
separate movements combined in each exercise are carried
out correctly, without being slurred or wrongly made.

(iv) The instructor must also be careful to see that no
cadet continues any muscle exercise until he is fatigued.
The exercises must be light at first, and gradually increased
according to the strength of individual cadets as their
muscles grow stronger. Exercises will be carried out
under the control of the instructor and according to his
directions. Each exercise will be carried out in a series
of three movements, which may be repeated for a number
of times at his discretion.

(v)
Cadet Muscle Exercise.
—Caution:—
Muscle Exercise.

Commands:—

Rate of Fire.

One.
—Assume the firing position ordered, and bring
the rifle to the position for loading.

Two.
—Perform the action of loading and adjusting
sights correctly to a given range.

Three.
—Bring the rifle to the position for aiming, press
the trigger, and return at once to the position
for loading.

Note.
—Rapid loading and unloading in the prone position
with the rifle to the shoulder will also prove a useful muscle
exercise.

CHAPTER V

VISUAL TRAINING AND RANGING

Section
33
.—General Remarks on Visual Training.
15

1. Importance of Visual Training.
—Great as is the loss
of fire effect due to errors in judging distance and sighting,
an even greater amount of ammunition will be expended
without good results unless the soldier is trained to discern
and select targets at close ranges, and to recognize targets
described to him at longer ranges.

2.
Even at close range, in the open, service targets consisting
of troops are often impossible to discern with the
naked eye when motionless if their background harmonizes
with their uniform. At all ranges, except short distances
within close range, troops in neutral-tinted uniform, adopting
formations which allow full use to be made of ground and
cover, are usually difficult to discern with the naked eye
even when in motion.

3.
Finally, targets which consist of ground or its
natural features are not easy to recognize unless the eye of
the soldier is specially trained for this work, upon which
fire effect in battle beyond close range will depend. The
eyesight of the soldier must, therefore, be developed in
special powers to enable him to discern and recognize the
targets of the modern battlefield at all ranges before he is
able to fire at them effectively.

82

4. Scope of Training.
—(i) Visual training will include
discernment of targets, study and description of ground,
recognition of and aiming at targets described by word of
mouth, judging distance by eye, and, when possible, observation
of the results of fire. Visual training should at
first be separated from training in judging distance, but as
proficiency is attained both should be combined after men
have been instructed in military vocabulary and study of
ground, which lays the foundation of instruction in recognition
of targets. Training in observation of results of fire
by watching the strike of bullets on the ground will be
difficult to carry out except on dusty soil.

5. Visual Training on Miniature Ranges.
—Directions for
training men in the different subjects of instruction mentioned
in the above paragraph, including observation of
fire, are contained in Chapter X, Sec. 72, para. 4.

Section
34
.—Discernment of Targets.

1. Elementary Training.
—Training will begin with questions
framed to develop a manâs powers of discerning
objects,
and describing accurately and shortly what he sees
.
At first any ordinary objects in the vicinity of barracks
will be counted, or instruction may be carried out as in the
elementary stage of training in observation and memory
according to the directions laid down in Sec. 45 of
Drill and
Field Training
of this series.

2. Training on the Ground.
—Training will then be carried
out on the ground. Exercises should first be carried out
in good light, the recruits being allowed to stand and obtain
a good field of view. Afterwards exercises should be carried
out under all conditions of light, and in cloudy or misty
weather, men being trained to discern and describe objects
in the prone position in the open or behind cover, when
their field of view will be restricted.

83

3. Visibility of Distinct and Neutral Colours.
—For exercises
in the field a certain number of dummy targets or fatigue-men
will be placed or posted beforehand in various selected
positions unknown to the class in the open, or partly behind
cover, and against different backgrounds. The targets
should include both the distinct bullâs-eye and service figure
targets of different colours, and the fatigue-men should be
dressed in uniforms of both distinct and neutral tints, with
the object of showing the difference in visibility of distinct
and neutral colours against the same background. Neutral-tinted
targets should also be arranged against various
backgrounds to show how background affects visibility,
as, for example, the difference in visibility of a khaki
uniform against a white wall, a sheet of water, a skyline,
dark ploughland, a green field, a brown hedge.

4. Effect of Background on Visibility.
—During these
exercises opportunity will be taken by instructors to utilize
the useful object-lessons they provide upon the use of
ground and cover. Men should be made to note the
varying visibility of objects according to their background.
They should be taught that the visibility of targets naturally
tends to increase the effect of fire directed at them by
facilitating discernment, judging distance, and aiming,
while the vulnerability of targets is decreased in proportion
as they are invisible or difficult to discern. Men must,
therefore, be taught to note the effect of different backgrounds
upon the visibility of fatigue-men in service uniforms.
When being trained in the use of ground and cover,
they should learn, when possible, to avoid positions such
as a skyline or a background which contrasts sharply with
their uniforms, and may render them distinctly visible to
the enemy [Sec. 72, para. 4 (ii)].

5. Describing Targets.
—In all exercises men will be given
a definite period of time—which may be decreased as
progress is made—in which to locate and count targets.

84

Each man should then be asked how many he has discerned.
Men will in turn be asked to describe clearly and shortly
the nature and position of any target they have discerned
which has not already been described by a comrade.
They should be taught to use military vocabulary in
describing targets, and to indicate their position by the
methods explained in Sec. 45. Visual training will thus
lay the foundation of instruction in recognition of targets.

6. Use of Field-Glasses.
—In the case of targets which are
difficult to see, and which have not been discerned, the
instructor may allow men to discern the target with the aid
of field-glasses, and then make them try to discern the
target with the naked eye, using natural features of the
ground in the vicinity of the target to locate its position.
This instruction will help to train men in the use of field-glasses
and in recognition of targets.

7. Effect of Movement on Visibility.
—Finally, fatigue-men
will be employed to skirmish from cover to cover, and to
perform the firing motions from behind cover, in order to
show how motion catches the eye and exposes the firerâs
position (Sec. 72, para. 3 [iii]).

8. Locating an Enemy by Sound.
—Blank ammunition will
be used to give practice to the ear in locating an enemy by
sound.

Section
35
.—Military Vocabulary and Study
of Ground.
16

1. Importance of Military Vocabulary.
—(i) Soldiers must
be trained not only to discern, but to describe service
targets of various kinds. For this purpose they must be
instructed in military vocabulary. Military vocabulary
comprises the technical terms applied to the organization,
weapons, equipment, formations, and duties of various
arms. Definitions of these technical terms are contained in

85

the various books of this series, including
Drill and Field
Training
,
Field Entrenchments
, and
First Aid
.

(ii) In this book, besides definitions of the technical terms
which apply especially to musketry, a list of terms and
definitions applied to natural and other features of ground
and country is included on p. xxvi as being a necessary
part of the military vocabulary used in the recognition and
indication of targets.

2. Need of a Standard Vocabulary.
—It is important that
the military vocabulary in each unit of an army, and, if
possible, in the whole army, should be uniform as to its
various terms, especially in regard to the indication and
description of targets. Both fire-unit commanders and
men should therefore be thoroughly trained in applying a
uniform military vocabulary correctly to various service
targets, such as units of various arms in different formations
and to the different natural and other features of ground
and country.

3. Method of Instruction.
—(i) Instruction in military
vocabulary may be carried out in the following manner.
In early lessons the instructor will describe in detail simple
prominent features, such as part of a skyline or the line of
a bank or hedge, and get each man in the class to describe
in similar terms another part of the line. He will then
practise them by the same method in describing more
difficult and extensive features. In this way men will
gradually learn the correct terms to apply to a great
variety of natural features of ground. When men have
learnt how to describe various features of ground in correct
terms, the instructor will proceed to describe small
areas of ground, the limits of which he will first clearly
define.

(ii) He will describe the shape and nature of the ground,
as, for instance, whether it is level, undulating or broken,
and rocky, sandy, or pasture. He will then describe its

86

various natural and artificial features, the different kinds
of trees, fences, undergrowth, etc., on it, and the shape and
size of the fields, with the colour of the earth or of crops
growing in them. The approximate measurements of
objects, roughly estimated, may also be given, as, for
instance, whether they are large, small, of moderate size,
tall, short, wide, or narrow. These rough measurements
will often help to distinguish objects, such as trees, fields,
hedges, or houses from one or more objects of a similar
nature. Men will first be thoroughly practised in completing
the description of ground and its features commenced
by the instructor, and then, as progress is made in
describing ground which is merely pointed out by the instructor
without being partly described by him.
Fig. 43

illustrates common features of ground which may be
described in the manner outlined in these paragraphs.

4. Study of Ground.
—It is clear that instruction in military
vocabulary provides a good opportunity for training
fire-unit commanders and men in the study of ground,
which is of the greatest military importance. Therefore,
in training men in the description of ground, instructors
should also train them
to recognize all features of military
importance
, such as good defensive positions, good lines
of approach, good halting-places for attack, covered
approaches, dead ground, obstacles, and good or dangerous
cover.
17
When men have learned to recognize features of
military importance, the instructor will indicate an area
of ground, and question the class in turn as to what
military features may be seen on it. Men must describe
these military features in the correct terms, and they will
thus learn an extremely important branch of military
vocabulary—namely, that applied to ground—which must

87

88

frequently be described to them and recognized by them
as aiming points in a later stage of their training.

Military Vocabulary—Terms describing
Common Features of Ground.

5. Studying Ground from Cover.
—As progress is made in
the study of ground, the class should be made to examine
the ground and to describe it from behind cover to accustom
them to its appearance, as they will see it when firing from
cover. This instruction will form a useful preparation for
the duties of reconnaissance and scouting. When the class
is sufficiently advanced, the areas of ground described will
be increased gradually, and, when necessary, these areas
will be divided into sectors, as described in Sec. 42, paras. 3
and 5, and each sector will be divided into foreground,
middle distance, and background. Men will be trained to
note the different zones of ground to which these terms
are applied, and then to apply them correctly in describing
ground.

6. Committing Features of Ground to Memory.
—When
men are sufficiently advanced, they may be practised in
examining ground for a limited time, and then giving a
correct description of its prominent features and principal
military features with their backs to it. The instructor
will check their description while it is being given by
looking at the ground, and bring out points which may
have been missed or forgotten by asking men questions.
This practice will develop the extremely useful power of
rapidly noting features of ground, and also of memorizing
ground. The latter power will be useful in reconnaissance,
scouting, and reports.

7. Study of Ground in Strange Country.
—As the ground
and its features, both natural and artificial, together with
the names by which they are called, differ considerably in
different countries, men should be trained in military
vocabulary, the description and study of ground both
before and during military operations in unfamiliar
country.

89

Section
36
.—General Remarks on Ranging.

1. Importance of Ranging.
—(i) Accurate ranging when
firing is of vital importance, especially at distances beyond
close range. Mistakes in judging distance or range-finding,
and errors in sighting, cause a greater loss of fire effect
than personal errors in shooting except at close range. But
even within close range mistakes of more than 100 yards
are not infrequently made in judging distance.
The more
accurate the firing, the less will be the result if the sighting is
incorrect from any cause.

(ii) The measurement of ranges will commence the
moment a firing-point has been chosen. Range-taking increases
in importance rapidly with every 100 yards beyond
600 yards up to 2,000 yards, at which distance troops not
in a close formation are only visible when in motion, or
with a very favourable background or light.

2. Methods of Ranging.
—(i) The principal means of
ranging are—(
a
) Judging distance by eye; (
b
) observation of
fire; (
c
) use of instruments such as the mekometer and the
one-man range-finder. There are several auxiliary methods
of ranging such as back-reckoning, use of maps, information
obtained from aircraft, artillery or machine-guns, sound and
flash, cross-bearings, etc., which may be used occasionally
or in exceptional cases.

(ii) Observation of fire, when possible, is an effective
means of ranging. If uncertainty exists as to elevation, it
is better to underestimate than to overestimate the range.
If it is necessary to fire at ranges beyond 1,000 yards, and
observation is not possible, or the situation demands that
some effect should be produced, quickly combined sights
may be employed. In all cases every available means
should be employed to find correct ranges.
No available

90

means of ascertaining ranges should ever be neglected, if time
and opportunity allow them to be used.

3. Reconnaissance as an Aid to Ranging.
—As already
stated, range-finding will as a rule be in progress before fire
is opened, and the rapid reconnaissance of any ground on
which a fire-fight is likely to take place should provide
information of the greatest value to company officers responsible
for the direction of fire. In preparing a defensive
position, there is usually ample time for ascertaining ranges,
and for using range-marks (Sec. 40, para. 5) and preparing
range-cards (Sec. 40, para. 1).

4. Training of Officers and N.C.O.âs.
—As fire is controlled
at longer ranges, practice in judging distance is more necessary
for officers and non-commissioned officers than for the
private soldier. Soldiers who show aptitude in judging
short distances by eye should, however, be given training
with their leaders at judging longer distances. These men
may also be selected for training in the use of range-finding
instruments and in the duties of observers (Sec. 42, para. 9).

5. Reduction of Errors by Training.
—Officers and non-commissioned
officers, by constant practice, will reduce
their mean error in judging distance from about 20 per cent.
of the correct distance to about 10 per cent., but much
depends on the local conditions to which the observer is
accustomed. With thorough training the mean error of
private soldiers in judging distances within 800 yards
should not exceed 100 yards. Special attention should be
paid to men whose mean errors exceed this distance, with
a view to discovering the cause and reducing the error.

6. Effect of Strange Conditions.
—Serious errors must be
expected in judging under strange conditions of ground and
atmosphere. Exercises in judging distance must therefore
be carried out before, as well as during, military operations
in unfamiliar country.

91

Section
37
.—Judging Distances by Eye.

1. Methods of Judging Distance by Eye.
—Distances may
be judged by eye in the following ways: (
a
) By measuring
the intervening ground with the eye in terms of some
familiar unit, such as 100 yards; (
b
) by the apparent size
of the object, if its size is known, or, in other words, by
visual angles; (
c
) by the visibility of the object as affected
by light, atmospheric effect, background, etc.

2. Rules for Judging Distance by Eye.
—(i) The varying
nature of the ground and its features, together with different
conditions of light and atmosphere, affect general impressions
of distance as measured by the eye by making
objects look smaller or larger, and so making them seem
nearer or further away from an observer than they
actually are.

(ii)
Conditions which appear to Increase Distance.
—Objects will
appear smaller, and therefore farther away than they are,
under the following conditions:

(
a
) When objects are of the same colour or a colour which
harmonizes with their background.

(
b
) On broken ground.

(
c
) When seen across a valley or undulating ground.

(
d
) In avenues, long streets, or ravines.

(
e
) When in shadow.

(
f
) When viewed in mist or failing light.

(
g
) When heat is rising from the ground.

(
h
) When seen near any other object which makes it
appear smaller than it is by the effect of comparison.

(
i
) When only partially seen, as in the case of troops
firing from cover.

(
j
) Troops kneeling or lying in the open seem farther away
than when standing.

92

(iii)
Conditions which appear to Decrease Distance.
—Objects will
appear larger, and therefore nearer than they are, under
the following conditions:

(
a
) When both object and background are of different or
contrasting colours.

(
b
) When the sun is behind the observer.

(
c
) In bright light or clear atmosphere.

(
d
) When the intervening ground is level or covered with
snow.

(
e
) When seen across water or a deep chasm.

(
f
) When looking upwards or downwards.

(
g
) When the object is large, or when seen near any other
object which makes it appear larger than it is by effect of
comparison.

(iv)
A General Rule.
—A good general rule to remember for
practical purposes is that
when a target is indistinct distance
is apt to be over-estimated, and that when a target is
distinct distance is apt to be under-estimated
. This general
rule roughly sums up the effects and the various factors
mentioned in paras. (ii) and (iii), which respectively tend
to render targets less or more distinct.

3. Judging Lateral Distance by Eye.
—The following is a
rough guide for judging lateral distances running at right
angles to the observer at various distances. With one eye
shut and the hand at armâs length to the front with the fingers
perpendicular, the breadth of six fingers will cover 100 yards
of lateral distance at a distance of 500 yards from the observer.
Under the same conditions, the breadth of three
fingers will cover a lateral distance of 100 yards at a distance
of 1,000 yards. The breadth of two fingers will cover a
lateral distance of 100 yards at 1,500 yards, and the width
of the thumb will roughly cover 100 yards of lateral
distance 2,000 yards away. This method may be employed
for estimating the approximate length of an

93

enemyâs column, or the extent of frontage known to be
occupied by him.

4. Method of Instruction
—(i)
Units of Distance.
—All the
methods mentioned in para. 1 should be practised by
officers, N.C.O.âs, and men under a variety of practical
conditions, and in the prone, kneeling, and standing
positions, until it is found that distances can be judged
approximately from the general impression conveyed to
the eye. The class will first be familiarized with short
units of distance not exceeding 600 yards.
Special care
will be taken to enable soldiers to recognize the distance of
600 yards, as it is the limit of individual fire.

(ii)
Figures.
—The class will at the same time study the
visibility of the figure standing, kneeling, and lying
at known distances. They will be required to remember
the results of their observation, and be given opportunities
of seeing figures in varying conditions of light, atmosphere,
and background at known distances.

(iii)
Features of Ground.
—The class will next be practised in
judging the distance of natural features of ground, such as
folds of ground, hedges, patches of undergrowth, and other
forms of cover, at various known distances. This instruction
will be followed by judging the distances of fatigue-men
seen at unknown distances in the different firing
positions both in the open against various backgrounds and
partly behind cover. The class will then be practised in
judging the distance of features of ground and different
forms of cover at various unknown distances. These
various practices should be carried out with the class in the
standing, kneeling, and prone positions.

(iv)
Reasons for Estimates.
—Each observer should be asked
by the instructor to give reasons for his estimate of distance
to guard against the habit of rough guessing. To train
observers in the habit of taking into account every factor
which will help them to judge distance, the instructor

94

should consider and explain the effects of local conditions
and other factors which affect judging the distance of each
object he indicates after the class have made their estimates.
Ample time should at first be allowed for judging distance,
but as progress is made the time should be limited. The
above exercises must include instruction in estimating
lateral distances.
Rough guessing is never to be allowed.

5. Aids to Judging Distance by Eye.
—(i) The class should
be trained in various methods of assisting the eye when the
distance of objects is especially difficult to estimate approximately.
For example, a maximum and minimum estimate
of the distance may be made, and the mean taken as
correct. Half the distance from the object may be estimated
with the aid, if possible, of some feature of ground,
and double may be taken as correct. When the object is
partly hidden in a fold of ground, or when it is of unknown
size, distance from it may be estimated with the
help of some object of known size, such as a natural
feature of the ground or a human figure which may be
near it.

(ii) Other rough methods which will assist them in judging
distance approximately may be explained to the men.
For instance, the foresight of the rifle
when correctly aligned

will be approximately equal to the height of a standing
figure at 400 yards. The width of an ordinary pencil held
horizontally at armâs length before the eye will cover an
upright figure at 200 yards, and the lead at its thick part
will cover a standing figure at 600 yards.

6. Tests in Judging Distance by Eye
—(i)
Directions regarding
Tests.
—In every company, and at depôts, in addition to instructional
exercises, at least one test in judging the distances of
four objects will be held for all ranks in every three months,
the distances of the objects being between 200 and 800 yards.

All company officers, non-commissioned officers, and those
men who are in possession of badges for judging distance, will
also be tested once in every three months under regimental

95

arrangements in judging the distances of four objects between
200 and 1,400 yards.

Brigade commanders and officers commanding districts will
issue such orders as may be necessary for exempting non-commissioned
officers and men from these tests, but every officer
and sergeant who would command a company or smaller unit
on mobilization should attend four tests annually in judging
distance up to 1,400 yards.

(ii)
Conditions of Tests.
—During tests in judging distance no
assistance from maps or other means should be allowed. The
tests will be conducted on unfamiliar ground, half the objects
consisting of fatigue-men or dummy figures representing
skirmishers, and half of natural objects marking fire positions,
such as would be occupied on service.

The observers will lie down or kneel behind cover, and
estimates will be recorded by adjusting the sights (or in the
case of officers by writing) in multiples of 50 yards; the objects
should have been previously placed or selected, or the position
of the observers should be chosen, so that the correct distance
may closely approximate to some multiple of 50 yards.

Half a minute will be allowed for each estimate, reckoned
from the moment when the object is pointed out or a shot is
fired to draw attention to the position of the object. At the
conclusion of the half-minute a whistle should be blown, when
the observers will stand to attention, and no further adjustment
of the sights or writing will be permitted. The register-keeper
will then examine each rifle or paper, and record the estimates
in the register. On return to barracks, the mean percentage of
error of each observer will be entered in the register, which will
be preserved for record.

On the completion of the classification practices, the mean
percentages of error made by each individual officer, non-commissioned
officer and man since the last classification will
be added together and divided by the number of tests which he
has attended, the average thus obtained being regarded as the
standard of proficiency of the individual until the next classification.

Officers, non-commissioned officers, and men whose mean error
exceeds 20 per cent., and those who have attended less than
two tests, will be regarded as inefficient. Additional practice

96

will be afforded weekly to all officers, non-commissioned officers,
and men who are recorded as inefficient, until the next quarterly
test. Officers and sergeants whose mean error exceeds 20 per
cent. will not be classified as better than second-class shots.

Section
38
.—Range-finding by Observation of Fire.

1. When Observation is Possible.
—Observation of
results is the best means of correcting errors in sighting,
but it is only practicable (
a
) when the ground in the vicinity
of the objective is of a nature to show the strike of the
bullets by dust, or (
b
) when the enemy is in the open,
and the accuracy of fire can be judged by its effect upon
him.

2. Nature of Fire Necessary for Observation.
-
-A considerable
volume of rapid and concentrated fire is necessary
to enable the strike of bullets to be observed
, and for this
purpose one or more Maxim guns, or not less than two
platoons, should be employed to fire. The distance and
nature of the ground will determine the volume of fire
required, but the greater the difficulty of observation the
greater must be the volume of fire. When trying for observation,
third-class shots should not be permitted to fire.

3. Method of applying Fire for Observation
—(i)
Elevation.
—An
elevation well
under
the estimated distance should
first be selected, and if the fire can be observed, the elevation
should be increased by not less than 100 yards at a
time until the nucleus of the bullets is seen to fall on the
desired spot.

(ii)
Objective.
—The point at which the fire is directed may
be the actual objective, or ground in its vicinity which is
more suited to observation of the strike of the bullets.

(iii)
Position for Observation.
—The best position from which
to observe fire is behind, and, if possible, above the firers;
but in this position the bullets which fall short will be

97

most easily seen, and may be mistaken for the nucleus of
the fire. Further, all shots will appear to strike nearer
to the observer than is really the case.

(iv)
Hints for Observers.
—To an observer on or behind a
flank of the firers, shots which pass over the mark will
appear to fall towards the flank on which he is posted, and
those which drop short to fall towards the opposite flank.
Thus, if the majority of shots seem to an observer on the

right
flank to fall to the
right
of the mark, the range has
been
over-estimated
, and if they seem to fall to the
left
, it
has been
under-estimated
.

4. Verifying Ranges by Fire.
—When there is time and
opportunity for doing so, ranges which have been taken
beforehand, especially those taken in preparing a defensive
position, should be verified by the results of firing a number
of rounds.

Section
39
.—Ranging by Auxiliary Methods
and by Instruments.

1.
Training in ranging should include instruction in
practical auxiliary methods such as by maps and range-finding
instruments.
Exercises in ranging by means of
maps, range-finders, and the eye, used in combination, should
form an essential part of the fire-direction practices of the
annual course of musketry.

2. Ranging by Map-Reading.
—Ranges may be ascertained
by the use of small scale maps, though large scale
maps, if available, will be better for this purpose. Instruction
in field-sketching and reconnaissance affords excellent
opportunities for training in judging distance. For map-reading,
see
Signalling
of this series; and for field-sketching
and reconnaissance, see
Drill and Field Training
of this series.

3. Back-Reckoning.
—Back-reckoning may be defined as
deduction as to distance made from any known range.

98

For instance, in advancing on a position the range of which
is ascertained on commencing the advance, the distance
gained by each forward movement may be deducted from
the original range of the position in estimating its range
for firing on it at successive halts. Again, the range of an
objective further away than another objective, of which
the range is known, may be estimated by adding to the
known range the estimated distance of the former from
the latter objective. An example of back-reckoning is
shown in
Fig. 44
.

4. Ranging by Gun-Flash and Sound.
—Light travels at
the rate of 186,000 miles a second, so that a gun-flash is
practically seen as it issues from the muzzle, irrespective
of the distance of the observer. Sound, on the other hand,
travels about 1,100 feet, or about 365 yards, a second. By
timing the interval between seeing the flash of a gun and
hearing the report, its approximate distance may therefore
be deduced. This, of course, will only be possible when the
position of the gun is betrayed by the flash, and when guns
are fired singly at appreciable intervals, or simultaneously,
so that there is practically one flash and one report at a
time.

5. Range-Finding Instruments.
—A certain number of
officers, N.C.O.âs, and men in each unit will be trained to
use the One-Man Range-Finder or the Mekometer instrument,
full directions regarding the use of which will be
found in the official handbooks dealing with these instruments.

Section
40
.—Range-Cards and Range-Marks.

1. Range-Card.
—A range-card is a device for giving
ranges to various points in a field of fire for use in attack
or defence. Range-cards should be prepared by fire-unit

99

commanders for their own use and for use by N.C.O.âs and
observers. When possible, the best way to prepare a
range-card is to use a piece of a large scale map of the
country on which to draw the range circles and direction
lines. There will usually be more time for preparing range-cards
in defence than in attack, and consequently range-cards
prepared for defensive positions will as a rule be more
elaborate than those made for use in attack.

Fig. 44.
—
Simple Range-Card for Attack.

Note.
—The distances on the left are those from the enemyâs
position. Those on the right in brackets are only for the
range-takerâs information, and should not be shown on the
card to avoid confusion.

2. A Simple Range-Card for Attack.
—
Fig. 44
shows a
rough example of a simple range-card made for use in
attack over the ground shown in the left sector of the sketch

100

in
Fig. 47
, from which it will be seen that the objects on the
range-card are taken. This has been done to make the
example more practical and interesting. The ranges are
supposed to be taken from the cross-roads at X to a series
of prominent objects on or a little to either side of the line
of advance. The distance of each of these points
from the
enemyâs position
(2,000 yards away) is carefully noted, and
thus ranging during the attack is greatly facilitated. The
range of the enemyâs position from intermediate points
can also be more easily estimated by back-reckoning.

Fig. 45.
—
Simple Range-Card for Defence.

Note.
—The point from which ranges are taken should always be
described clearly on the card to facilitate setting it.

3. A Simple Range-Card for Defence.
—
Fig. 45
shows a
rough example of a simple range-card made for use in

101

defence. The ranges in this case are supposed to be taken
from the point
A
immediately south of the church. The
direction line from
A
to the church is drawn thicker than
the other lines to facilitate âsettingâ the range-card in
the same manner in which a map is set. When the card is
set for the point from which ranges are taken—which is
noted on the card—by pointing the thick direction line on
the church, the other direction lines will indicate the ranges
of the other points marked on the card.

4. Foreground Range Sketch.
—(i)
Fig. 46
shows an example
of a foreground range sketch for use in a defensive position.
Such a sketch would as a rule only be made in connection
with very carefully prepared firing-points; but as from
seven to ten hours or more is required to make any serious
attempt to prepare and conceal a series of firing-points
carefully, it is clear that the range-taking and range-marking
party should have ample time to make an exhaustive reconnaissance
of the foreground, to put out the range-marks,
and to record their work in some simple form. One sketch
such as
Fig. 46
is sufficient for the commander of a group
of firing-points.

(ii) Points, the range of which may be ascertained and
marked with advantage in such sketches, include the exits
and entrances to all areas of dead ground, or likely cover
from view or fire; the crests or skylines—as seen from the
firing-points—of all ridges and humps on the foreground;
patches or lengths of road likely to be traversed by the
enemy; gaps and gates in fences; corners of fields and
enclosures; bridges, culverts, etc.; and conspicuous single
objects, as guide-marks from which to estimate adjacent
distances, such as isolated buildings, signposts, rocks, milestones,
double telegraph-posts, or other such features.

(iii) As will be seen in
Fig. 46
, names may also be allotted
to patches of dead ground within 1,000 yards or so of the
firing-point. The abbreviated names of months and days

102

103

of the week lend themselves to such a purpose, though any
other short names will do equally well.

Fig. 46.
—
Example of a Foreground Range Sketch.

Note.
—Ranged points are indicated by a thick line. The appearance of the Range-Marks
is shown thus:—VIII. [= 850 yds.] Names have been allotted to
important dead spots within 1,000 yards—
e.g.
,
Feb.
refers to the dead area
immediately behind the ridge ranged as 850.

5. Range-Marks.
—Range-marks are of special value to
the defenders in those firing-points in which they have been
told off
to watch for and deal with the enemyâs supports and
reserves
during their advance, after fire has been opened
and the enemyâs firing-line is already pinned down, or is unable
to cross certain areas on a foreground prepared for
defence until strongly reinforced (see
p. 162
, para. 3 (x),

Field Entrenchments
of this series).

6. Marking Ranges on Ground.
—(i) The actual marking
of ranges on the ground by means of visible marks may be
done as follows: Range-marks should be provided, and
should be placed on that side of large trees, houses, banks,
etc., which is only visible to the defence. The simplest
arrangement consists of one white object per 100 yards
range; 500 yards may be denoted by the sign
V
, made with
two boards, poles, etc.; and 1,000 yards by the sign
X
;
intermediate hundreds being indicated by single objects in
addition, as above described. On a bank or slope facing
the firing-points Roman numerals may be cut out on the
turf, etc., or formed by arranging stones or planks.

(ii)
Marking on Trees.
—For marking on a tree the hundreds
marks must be one below the other, and patches of tin do
very well for this. For marking âfiftiesâ an object much
smaller but distinctly visible may be added, or one object
quite different to the remainder. On a tree marked with
tin discs, for example, half a disc would do for 50 yards.

(iii)
Marking on Buildings.
—For marking on a building, the
colour to be used depends on that of the masonry, etc. A
whitewash-brush is one of the best implements, if obtainable,
and the marking, can be either large Roman numerals
or ordinary figures if they can be read clearly.

(iv)
Examples of Marks.
—In
Fig. 46
five artificial range-marks
are shown—namely, 0000·(450) at the stack, V on

104

May hill, VII on March-April ridge, VII·(850) on Dec.-Feb.
ridge, and X where Monday road disappears into
Hereham village. The walls round the village might be
marked in a similar manner, but the sketch is too small to
show the marks.

(v)
Size of Marks.
—A practical rule for the
size
of mark
is 1 foot of height to the mark per 100 yards in the range,
unless the background is very good—such as black spots
on a white wall—when half this allowance will be ample.

105

CHAPTER VI

FIRE DIRECTION AND CONTROL

Section
41
.—General Remarks.

1.
In the previous stages of instruction the foundation
of training for fire action beyond close range will have been
laid. The eyesight of both fire-unit commanders and men
will have been trained to discern service targets at all
ranges, and they will have become familiar with their
appearance under various conditions of light and atmosphere,
and accustomed to look for them and detect them
quickly. Both fire-unit commanders and men will also
have been trained in military vocabulary and the study of
ground, so that they apply a common phraseology to
various military objects, especially those under the head
of service targets, and also to the ground and its natural
features, the military value of which they will have learned
in field training through instruction in the use of ground
and cover.

2.
Fire-unit commanders and men must now be taught
to work together as an unit in directing fire at service targets
beyond close range by the efficient performance of the
various duties described in the following sections. This
instruction should commence with lectures, illustrated if
possible by the use of the Solano and landscape targets
as described in Secs. 72, 73, and 74. Lectures should
deal with organization for fire action, the effect of rifle
fire at various ranges, the tactical application of rifle fire,
the description and recognition of targets, fire orders, fire
discipline, and night firing.

106

3. Lectures and Demonstrations
(see
pp. 221
-225).
Special lectures in their duties should be given to fire-unit
commanders, non-commissioned officers, and observers,
and these lectures should include information and hints
which will enable fire-unit commanders to train their men
both by lectures and practical instruction. Lectures to
men should be given by their fire-unit commanders, and
should deal with all the various duties which are combined
for fire action, including organization and the duties of
fire-unit commanders. These lectures must deal thoroughly
with the duties of men in the firing-line and with the vitally
important subject of fire discipline (see
pp. 214
,
215
).

Section
42
.—Organization for Fire Action.
18

1. Fire direction and control depend in a great measure
upon good organization for fire action. The value of this
organization depends on the fitness of superior officers
and battalion commanders to handle their troops efficiently,
and issue such clear and concise orders as will enable each
unit to carry out its allotted task well supported, with their
communications and ammunition supply well maintained.
The duties of organization for fire action may be described
generally as follows:
19

(i) Allotment of frontages and objectives to various units.

(ii) Arrangements for communications and ammunition
supply.

(iii) Arrangements for covering fire by supports and
reserves, machine-guns, and artillery.

107

2. Allocation of Frontages and Objectives.
—Both in
attack and defence a definite frontage in the field of fire—termed
a
sector
—should be allotted to each fire-unit by
company and platoon commanders. Thus the enemy
appearing in any given sector will at once be engaged by
the unit to which that particular sector has been allotted.
Each fire-unit commander on receiving orders as to his
frontage, will indicate it to his unit in the manner described
in the following paragraphs, and must make sure that the
N.C.O.âs, observers, and men of his unit clearly understand
the extent and limits of their sector.

3. Indicating the Limits of Sectors
(
Fig. 47
).—The limits
of each sector will be indicated by means of suitable description
points (see Sec. 45, para. 3) on each flank of the frontage
allotted to an unit. These description points should, as
a rule, consist of distant features of a landscape or of the
field of fire. If no suitable description points mark the
limits of a sector exactly, the limits will be indicated as
being so many hand or finger breadths (Sec. 45, para. 7)
to the left or right of the nearest suitable description point.
The limits of sectors may be made to overlap in the same
manner. In defence there will generally be ample time
for allotting frontages. In attack frontages will usually
be allotted on deployment, but whenever possible they will
be selected beforehand by preliminary reconnaissance.

4. Object of Overlapping the Sectors.
—The overlapping
of sectors insures that the entire front is kept under close
observation, and that no part of it remains unswept by fire
should occasion arise for delivering fire at a target in any
part. It also prevents waste of ammunition and loss of
fire effect through units firing at objectives outside their
own sectors unless this is necessary for the purpose of
mutual support.

5. Example of Field of Fire divided into Sectors.
—(i)

Fig. 47
shows a field of fire divided into overlapping

108

sectors by the use of description points. The sketch illustrates
the arrangements made, as the result of a hasty
preliminary reconnaissance, by a company commander for
fire action by the four sections or normal fire-units of his
command on deployment in the early stage of attack. In
defensive positions similar arrangements may be made for
indicating sectors allotted to each locality. Defensive
positions will usually include a number of localities of
special tactical importance. From these localities either
direct or flanking fire, or both, is brought to bear on all
ground over which the enemy may advance. As long as
this is done the intervening ground between localities need
not be held in a continuous line.

(ii) In defence, the arrangements for fire action will
include the various measures described in Chapter VIII of

Field Entrenchments
of this series, such as clearing the
foreground of features which would afford cover to the
enemy and assist his advance, and clearing it of features
to improve the defenders field of fire, together
with the construction of different obstacles to impede
and check the enemyâs advance or cause him to select
lines of approach along avenues commanded by the fire of
the defenders.

6. Direction and Control of Fire.
—Fire is said to be

directed
by the commander, who defines the objective
against which it is to be used, and to be
controlled
by the
fire-unit commanders, who give the necessary executive
words of command. In attack occasions will frequently
arise when fire-unit commanders must both direct and
control the fire of their units, while at close ranges, or when
men are widely extended, it may happen that the transmission
of any fire-order is impossible, and that each
individual man must control his own fire.

7. Fire-Unit.
—The normal infantry fire-unit is the section,
though under certain conditions at the longer ranges the

109

fire of a platoon, or even a whole company, may be controlled
by its commander.
The efficiency of section commanders is
therefore of paramount importance.

8. Duties of Fire-Unit Commander.
20
—(i) The value of a
fire-unit commander depends upon his ability
to apply the
fire of his unit at the right time and in the right volume to the
right target
. In addition to his other duties, the fire-unit
commander is responsible for:

(
a
) Indicating targets.

(
b
) Issuing orders for sighting, and, when possible,
supervising the correct adjustment of sights.

(
c
) Regulating the volume of fire, whether deliberate or
rapid.

(
d
) Reporting to platoon or company officers when
ammunition is running short.

(ii) The additional duties of the fire-unit commander
referred to in the above paragraphs may be described
generally as follows:

(
a
) Watching for favourable targets.

(
b
) Watching for signals from platoon or company
officers.

(
c
) Observing effect of fire.

(
d
) Seizing all chances of firing for mutual support.

(
e
) Seeing that all orders are properly passed.

(
f
) Seeing to issue and redistribution of ammunition.

(
g
) Selecting halting places in attack.

(
h
) Making best use of ground and cover.

(
i
) Re-forming and telling off units as opportunity offers.
During the attack advantage will be taken of dead
ground and cover to re-form separate units which
may become mixed owing to confusion, especially
in the later stages of attack.

110

9. Duties of Observers.
—Men trained as observers will
be employed, as necessary, to assist fire-unit commanders
in observation of fire, in watching the enemy and neighbouring
troops, and in keeping up communication between
platoons. Observers will also be trained in the duties of
ranging and control of fire, so that they can carry them
out if fire-unit commanders are incapacitated.

Section
43
.—Effect of Fire at Different Ranges on
Various Formations and Objectives.

1. Effect of Fire at Various Ranges
—(i)
Close Range
.
21
—Owing
to the flatness of the trajectory, it should be possible
to obtain the maximum effect from rifle fire at targets
within close range—given a good field of fire and the
absence of dead ground and other conditions unfavourable
to fire effect at all ranges—
provided that fire discipline is
good and that individual soldiers select their targets and fire
carefully, making due allowance for elevation by aiming down
when necessary
.

(ii)
Effective Ranges.
—Between 600 and 1,400 yards, carefully
controlled collective fire produces better results than the
uncontrolled fire of individual men, which ceases to be
sufficiently effective beyond ranges of about 600 yards
to counterbalance the expenditure of ammunition involved.
At effective ranges troops advancing steadily and rapidly
suffer less than when they remain lying down, even
under moderately good cover. This is due to the moral
effect on the enemy and to the constant alteration of the
range.

(iii)
Long and Distant Ranges.
—Beyond 1,400 yards the fire
of even large and well-controlled units of infantry has
seldom much effect upon the decision of the struggle for

111

superiority of fire. Exceptional circumstances, such as the
appearance of considerable bodies of the enemy in vulnerable
formations, may, however, justify the use of long-range
fire, especially in the defence.

2. Effect of Rifle Fire on Various Formations and Objectives
—(i)

Infantry.
—On open ground swept by effective
rifle fire an extended line is the least vulnerable formation
for infantry, and on such ground it will usually be advisable
to extend before it becomes necessary for the advancing
troops to open fire. The greater the extension of a line,
the fewer will be the casualties, but the less will be its
fire effect [see Preface, para. 8 (i)].

(ii)
Cavalry.
—The fire effect which infantry can develop
against cavalry is such that infantry which is ready to
open a steady and timely fire has nothing to fear from a
cavalry charge, provided the cavalry cannot find dead
ground over which to approach. Any formation which
allows fire to be delivered quickly and accurately is suitable
for meeting cavalry. Closing an extended line to meet
cavalry delays the opening of fire, and may offer a vulnerable
target to the enemyâs artillery. Even if cavalry succeeds
in riding through a firing-line, it can inflict little loss
upon it if the infantry holds its ground. Whenever there
is a possibility of being charged by cavalry, special care
must be taken to watch and guard the flanks.

(iii)
Artillery.
—Artillery coming into action, limbering up,
or in movement, is a vulnerable target against which rapid
fire or even fire at long infantry ranges is justifiable. Infantry
will experience difficulty in putting shielded artillery
out of action by
direct fire
even at close infantry
ranges, but it can prevent the artillery from moving and
interfere with the service of the guns. Infantry can best
obtain decisive effect against guns with shields by means
of
enfilade or oblique fire
.

(iv)
Machine-Guns.
—Machine-gun sections with their guns

112

on travelling carriages are as vulnerable as artillery limbered
up; but detachments carrying the gun into action
are difficult to distinguish from infantry. Machine-guns in
position
are usually concealed
, and are a difficult target. To
obtain good effect against them it is usually necessary to
employ a considerable number of rifles.

(v)
Aircraft.
—Aircraft form a very difficult target to fire
directed from the ground, and only a small proportion of
their area is vulnerable. Bullets can pass through the
fabric of aeroplane wings without doing serious damage.
Indiscriminate fire at hostile aircraft is, moreover, likely
to cause casualties in neighbouring units, and will also disclose
the position of the troops to the enemyâs observer.
The strictest control must be exercised over all fire directed
against aircraft. In the case of rifle fire at
aeroplanes
,
men should be instructed to aim
six times the length of the
machine in front
, and
at the nose of the envelope in the case of
airships
.

(vi)
Retiring Troops.
—Other conditions being equal, the
effect of fire in the open at all ranges is always greater
when directed at retiring troops as compared with the effect
on troops advancing.

Section
44
.—Tactical Application of Rifle Fire.

1.
In connection with the tactical application of rifle fire,
it must be remembered that the essence of infantry tactics
in the attack consists in breaking down the enemyâs resistance
by the weight and direction of its fire, and then
completing his overthrow by assault—that is, by
bayonet
charge
. Although the enemy may not await the assault,

infantry must always be animated with the desire to close
with him as quickly as possible
. Troops under cover, unless
enfiladed, can seldom be forced to retire by fire alone, and

113

a decision by fire, even if possible, takes long to obtain.

To drive an enemy from the field, assault, or the immediate
threat of it, is almost always necessary.

2. Superiority of Fire.
—The object of fire action is to
attain superiority of fire over the enemyâs fire. Fire is
said to attain superiority when by its superior effect it
beats down or silences the enemyâs fire. Superiority of
fire in the different stages of attack enables the advance
to be pushed up by degrees to ground from which the
assault can be delivered on the enemyâs position. Superiority
of fire enables the defence to check the enemyâs
advance, and in active defence to create opportunities for
a general assumption of the offensive or for local counter-attacks.

Superiority of fire is produced by superior efficiency
in
(
a
)
fire direction and control
, (
b
)
fire discipline
, (
c
)
use of
the rifle, and
(
d
)
ammunition supply.

3. Opening Fire.
—When from his position it is possible
to do so, the company commander decides as to the time
for opening fire, subject to such orders as the battalion
commander may issue, and regulates the supply of ammunition.
In the defence he also normally arranges for the
distribution or concentration of fire, and indicates the
targets generally to his subordinates; but in the attack
these duties will usually devolve upon the subordinate
commanders with the firing-line.

4. Decision as to Opening Fire.
—In forming a decision
as to when fire should be opened, regard must be had to
the necessities of the tactical situation. The following
conditions must also be taken into account:

(i)
Surprise.
—The early opening of fire discounts surprise,
and, whether in attack or defence, often indicates the
position of troops which would otherwise be unnoticed by
the enemy. In attack it may delay the advance unnecessarily.

(ii)
Effect of Fire at Different Ranges.
—The effect of fire at

114

various ranges must be taken carefully into account. This
subject is dealt with in Sec. 43, para. 1.

5. Opening Fire in Attack.
—(i) In connection with the
considerations mentioned in para. 4 (i) and (ii) above, fire, as
a general rule, should rarely be opened by infantry in attack
when satisfactory progress can be made without it. The
leading troops in particular should save every possible
round for the final struggle for superiority of fire at close
range, as the replenishment of ammunition in the firing-line
at that time will be a matter of considerable difficulty.

(ii) When progress is no longer possible, fire should be
opened, either by such parts of the firing-line as cannot
advance, or by bodies of infantry specially detailed for this
purpose, to enable a further advance to be made. Subject
to these principles, fire may be opened in attack when there
is a probability of its producing good effect, or when withholding
fire might lead to heavy loss.

6. Opening Fire in Defence.
—When infantry is acting
on the defensive, there is usually less difficulty in arranging
for the supply of ammunition. Fire may therefore be
opened at longer ranges than when attacking, if it seems
probable that any advantage will be gained thereby, especially
when it is desired to prevent the enemy coming to
close quarters, and when the ranges have been ascertained
beforehand. If, however, the object is to gain decisive
results, it is generally preferable to reserve fire for closer
ranges and for surprise (Practice No. 1, p. 226).

7. Fire and Movement.
—It is clear from the above considerations
that fire is closely related to movement. The
direct object of fire in the case of attack and counterattack
is to facilitate movement, and also to check or
hinder the movements of the enemy. The direct object
of fire in defence is to check the movements of the enemy,
and in the case of active defence to create an opportunity
for the assumption of the offensive or for local counter-attacks.

115

Fire, therefore, is related to movement, and its
proper application with respect to movement is one of the
principal objects of training in fire control.

Fig. 48 Diagram illustrating the Tactical Application of Fire.

8. Concentrated Fire
(
Fig. 48
).—Collective fire may be
concentrated or distributed. Concentrated fire produces
a cone of fire favourable to observation of results, and is
more effective than distributed fire at the point of application.
Against narrow-fronted targets, such as the head
of a column or a machine-gun, or against very vulnerable
targets, or to produce an increased effect at a particular
point, fire may be concentrated with advantage.

9. Distributed Fire.
—(i) It is usually necessary to distribute
fire so as to keep the enemyâs firing-line under fire
throughout its length, in order to disturb his aim and prevent
his movements. Fire employed to cover movements
or directed on entrenchments should be distributed carefully
and systematically [see also Sec. 54, para. 3 (v)].

(ii)
Sweeping Fire
(
Fig. 48
).—Fire distributed
laterally
is
called sweeping fire. Such fire is to be preferred for
neutralizing an enemyâs fire along any portion of his front.

(iii)
Searching Fire
22
(
Fig. 7
).—Fire distributed in depth
is called searching fire. Such fire gives greater assurance
that some portion of the fire will be effective when the
target has not been located definitely, or when serious
errors in sighting are to be expected.

10. Oblique and Enfilade Fire
(
Fig. 48
).—Both oblique
and enfilade fire have greater moral and material effect
than frontal fire, for they usually come from an unexpected
direction, and the targets presented to them are generally
more vulnerable than those presented to frontal fire.
In defence, opportunities for the employment of enfilade
fire may be created by careful pre-arrangement between
the commanders of adjoining units.

11. Converging Fire
(
Fig. 48
).—Converging fire is fire

116

directed at a target from two or more different points
simultaneously. The moral and material effect of converging
fire may be very great, as it may combine the
effects of frontal, oblique, and enfilade fire at one and the
same time (Demonstration No. 3, p. 222).

12. Mutual Support
(
Fig. 48
).—(i) The various portions
of the firing-line will also on occasions be able to afford
each other mutual support by fire, and all commanders
must be on the alert to assist units on their flanks in this
manner when the situation requires. Covering fire in
mutual support should consist of heavy bursts of rapid
fire, sustained during the forward movement, and directed
at the enemy to the front of the advancing unit, as well
as to the front of the unit firing (Practice No. 1, p. 226).

(ii) Mutual support in the firing-line will as a rule, however,
be more automatic than deliberately arranged, and
in no case must its employment be allowed to induce hesitation
in the advance. The paramount duty of all leaders
in the firing-line is to get their troops forward, and if every
leader is imbued with a determination to close with the
enemy, he will be unconsciously assisting his neighbour
also, for as a rule
the best method of supporting a neighbouring
unit is to advance
.

13. Covering Fire
(
Fig. 48
).—(i) When the ground permits,
it is generally necessary to detail special detachments of
infantry to provide covering fire for the leading troops.
These detachments will usually be detailed by battalion
commanders from local reserves in the original distribution
for the attack, but any commander, at any stage of
the fight, may detail troops from those under his command
to assist his advance. No fire-unit commander, however,
is justified, on his own initiative, in withdrawing from the
advance or ceasing to seek an opportunity to advance in
order to constitute his command a detachment for providing
covering fire (Demonstration No. 6, p. 223).

117

(ii) In undulating or mountainous country it may be
possible for detachments employed to provide covering
fire to cover the advance from positions in rear, but in
flat country it may be dangerous or impossible for infantry
or machine-guns to fire over the heads of their own troops,
and opportunities for providing covering fire should be
sought on the flanks.

(iii) Troops detailed to provide covering fire for the
advance must take care to select as targets
those bodies of
the enemy whose fire is chiefly checking the advance
. Great
difficulty will often be experienced in discovering which
these bodies are, and all ranks must be on the alert to notice
any indication which may help to discover them.

(iv) As soon as their fire ceases to be effective in aiding
the advance of the firing-line, it is the duty of troops detailed
to provide covering fire
at once to join in the advance
, unless
definite orders to the contrary have been received.

14. Volume of Fire.
—In deciding on the volume of fire
to be directed against the enemy at any particular time, a
commander should consider chiefly the tactical situation,
the target presented, the effect it is desired to produce,
the range, and the state of the ammunition-supply.

15. Rates of Fire.
—
The rate of fire will always be regulated
carefully according to tactical requirements.

(i)
Slow Desultory Fire
may disturb the enemyâs aim, but
it is opposed to principles of surprise.

(ii)
Deliberate Fire.
—The rate of deliberate fire should not
exceed six rounds a minute.

(iii)
Rate when Working in Pairs.
—Soldiers working in pairs for
observation and mutual support (Sec. 47, para. 4) may

each
fire about three rounds a minute.

(iv)
Rapid Collective Fire.
—In rapid collective fire the rate
will vary according to the visibility of the aiming-mark,
the range, and the standard of training a man has reached.
With a distinct aiming-mark within about 1,000 yards a

118

well-trained man should be able to fire from twelve to
fifteen rounds per minute without serious loss of accuracy.

16. Use of Rapid Fire.
—(i)
Rapid fire should be considered
as a reserve of power to be used when the occasion demands
it.
It must never be used except when occasion most fully
justifies it, otherwise serious waste of ammunition will
result.
Rapid fire must combine accuracy with rapidity, and
never degenerate into a wild expenditure of ammunition at the
fastest possible rate.
If rapid fire is ordered,
each man will
fire at his own best rate for combining rapidity with accuracy
.

(ii) Rapid fire may be employed generally when it is
necessary to beat down the enemyâs fire quickly; when
covering the withdrawal of other troops; when pursuing
an enemy with fire; when meeting cavalry attacks; and
when good targets are exposed. In attack, rapid fire is
employed by all troops as final preparation for the assault.
In defence, it is employed to beat off an enemy in the act
of assaulting (Practices Nos. 5 and 6, p. 228).

17. Short Bursts of Fire.
—(i) The effect of surprise by a
sudden burst of accurate fire from an unexpected quarter
is very great. Short bursts of rapid fire, followed by pauses,
favour observation of results, and give time for the adjustment
of sights. They also facilitate the control of fire in
critical situations.

(ii) The duration of such bursts must be strictly controlled,
and limited to the requirements of the occasion,
for if rapid-fire is continued for any length of time, it excites
and exhausts the troops, and leads to waste of ammunition.
In order to insure control and facilitate the passing of orders,
the number of rounds to be fired may be named, as, for
instance,
ten rounds fire, or rapid fire
.

18. Surprise.
—A sudden effective fire is known to have
a particularly demoralizing effect on the enemy; it is often
advantageous, therefore, to seek for surprise effects of this
sort by temporarily withholding fire.

119

19. Unsteady Firing.
—Wild, unsteady fire causes little
or no loss, and tends to encourage the enemy by inducing
a belief in his mind that his opponent is shaken. It is
therefore worse than useless against good troops.
If firing
tends to become wild, it should be stopped, and only resumed
under strict control and detailed orders.

Section
45
.—Description and Recognition of Targets.

1. Importance of Good Description.
—(i) Owing to the
difficulty of discerning service targets beyond close range
with the naked eye, collective fire cannot be effective
unless the objective is described by the fire-unit commander
in such a way that every individual of his unit can
immediately recognize the target or point of aim indicated,
and unless men are also trained to recognize targets
and to bring fire to bear upon them immediately they are
indicated. These three conditions—good indication of
targets, immediate recognition of targets, and instant
opening of accurate fire—are essential if full effect is to
be obtained from fire, especially when directed at fleeting
targets, such as troops in movement.

(ii) Bad description of targets or delay in opening fire
due to this or other causes will lead to loss of fire effect,
which may prove disastrous in critical phases of action.
For example, bad description at the best will result in
recognition of the target by some instead of all the men
in an unit, as well as in delay in opening fire, which in the
case of fleeting targets will render fire partly or wholly
ineffective. Bad description may result in part or the
whole of an unit mistaking another aiming-point near it
for the target described, with total loss of fire effect due to
firing at the wrong target. It may result in part or the
whole of an unit becoming confused and not firing at all.
It is clear, therefore, that good description and quick

120

recognition of targets is essential for fire effect at longer
ranges, and that these duties form a vitally important part
of the training of fire-unit commanders and men.

2. Need of System in describing Targets.
—As service
targets, such as a fold in the ground or a patch of open
ground, will often be without any definite feature to distinguish
them from similar aiming-points near them, or
to locate their position exactly, and as targets generally
will be difficult to describe on ground devoid of prominent
or well-marked features, it is necessary to adopt a system
of description which will enable fire-unit commanders to
indicate the most difficult aiming-points to their men
clearly by some consistent method.

3. Description Points.
—A good system of indicating
targets is by description-points, consisting of natural or
other features of the ground in the frontage allotted to an
unit. If targets cannot be indicated sufficiently accurately
by description-points alone, supplementary methods,
known respectively as the Finger-breadth and Clock-face
methods, may be used in connection with description-points,
as described in paras. 7 and 8. As a rule the
former of these supplementary methods only will be employed,
and both will seldom be employed together in
combination with description-points.

4. Selecting Description-Points.
—(i) Company officers
will select description-points when occupying a position or
at the conclusion of movement. The number of description-points
necessary will depend on the nature of the
ground, and whether it has much or little detail in the
shape of prominent natural and other features; but points
should be selected so as to facilitate the indication of
targets in all parts of the field of fire.

(ii)
The most prominent objects should be chosen.
They
should be in the distance or middle of the field of fire,
and as far off as possible. No two points, if it can be

121

avoided, should be similar—as, for instance, two church
spires or clumps of trees. The points should be at least
two handsâ breadth apart. Each point should be named,
and the name by which it is to be known should be communicated
to fire-unit commanders and the men of their
units.

(iii) There will usually be more time for selecting description-points
in defence than in attack. For example,

Fig. 46
illustrates a field of fire in front of a defensive
position, in which almost every feature of ground has been
named and the range of all prominent objects taken. Such
preparation will be impossible, and to a great extent unnecessary,
in attack, when time for even a short preliminary
reconnaissance may not always be available.
Company,
platoon, and section commanders should therefore be trained
to select a few good description-points as quickly as possible,
and indicate them by suitable names to their commands.

5. Points of Military Importance.
—In addition to the
description-points, when there is time, any points in the
field of fire which are of military importance—such as a
road, a bridge (
Fig. 50
), or the forward edge of dead ground—at
which fire may suddenly have to be directed, should
also be named and indicated to fire-unit commanders. This
should be done, if possible, whenever such points are difficult
to describe and cannot be indicated quickly.

6. Rules for describing Targets.
—(i) Targets must be
indicated by short, accurate, clearly understood, descriptions
of their nature, features, and exact position.

(ii) Field-glasses may be used to discern targets before
indicating them.
But aiming-points must always be described
as they are seen with the naked eye, and not as seen
through field-glasses, otherwise the men, being without glasses,
may fail to recognize them.

(iii) In both attack and defence
the front should always
be pointed out
, so that if a general direction, such as
half

122

right
, is used to indicate a target, men will look in the
proper direction with regard to the front. This is necessary,
because the formation of the ground, the line of
cover, and the siting of trenches does not always permit
of men facing directly to the front.

(iv) As a general rule the finger-breadth and clock-face
methods of describing targets will only be used when they
will
shorten and simplify
the description, as well as make it
more accurate.

(v) Only one system of indicating targets should be employed
in a battalion, and, if possible, in an army, so that
the men may recognize targets described by commanders
of other fire-units should they become separated from their
own in action.

(vi) When possible, targets will always be described
and their range given
before the occasion for firing arises
,
so that men may adjust their sights and be ready to open
fire without further orders as soon as the target appears.

7. Finger-Breadth Method
(
Fig. 49
).—(i) This method
may be employed to indicate roughly the approximate distance
of an objective from a description-point. Only one
hand should be used, even if more than one handâs breadth
is required to indicate the distance. The arm must be
held out perfectly straight from the shoulder in front of the
face, with the fingers vertical. If, however, the object is
immediately
above
or
below
the description-point, the fingers
should be horizontal. In measuring distances, one eye
should be closed, and both the description-point and the
objective kept in view.

(ii)
Instruction in the Finger-Breadth Method.
—Results obtained by
this method are necessarily inaccurate, because the hands
and fingers vary in size and in distance from the eye with
each individual. It is, however, a useful guide for measuring
approximate distances. After the first few lessons in
the use of this method, measurements should first be judged,

123

and then the fingers should be used to check them. It
will be found that when men have been thoroughly trained
in this method they will seldom have to use their fingers
for measurements at all except in very doubtful cases.

Fig. 50.
—
Description of Targets—Clock-Face Method.

(âSection Fireâ Landscape Target, Panel No. 1.)

8. Clock-Face Method
(
Fig. 50
).—This method may be
used to indicate the position of the target described in relation
to a description-point. In employing it, the clock-face
must be imagined as hanging vertically, with its centre
directly over the description-point. Thus, an objective
vertically above the description-point would be described
as being at twelve oâclock, while objectives to the right
and left on the same horizontal plane as the description-point
would be respectively at three and nine oâclock, and
an objective directly below the description-point would
be at six oâclock.
The direction, right or left, should always
be given, as well as the hour, to avoid possible mistakes.

9. Examples of Description of Targets
—(i)
Description-Points
.—Fig.
49 shows a field of fire with plenty of detail, and serves
to illustrate the method of indicating targets by the use
of description-points alone, and by the use of these points
in combination with the finger-breadth method. If the
landscape in this figure is taken as representing a sector,
the following features might be as description-points:
(
a
) Right edge of wood on hill; (
b
) tallest poplar half right;
(
c
) white house on left. The fire-unit commander would
inform his unit that they would be named and referred to
respectively as
Wood
,
Poplar
,
House
, in using them to
direct fire.

(ii)
Indication by Description-Points.
—Examples of indicating
targets by these description-points alone are as follows:

(
a
)
At 1,000—at centre of hedge running from left of
poplar.—Ten rounds. Rapid fire.

(
b
)
At 1,400—brown field to right of house—at right half
of hedge running along top.—Fire.

124

(iii)
Indication by Description-Points and Finger-Breadths.
—Examples
of indicating targets by description-points combined
with the finger-breadth method are as follows:

(
a
)
At 800—at foot of big tree two fingers left of poplar.—Five
rounds. Fire.

(
b
)
At 900—at fold of ground one finger below house.—Five
Rounds. Rapid fire.

For the purpose of illustration the finger-breadths are
shown drawn on the landscape.

(iv)
Indication by Description-Points and Clock-Face.
—
Fig. 50
illustrates
the method of indicating targets by the use of description-points
combined with the clock-face method.
The point of river bend right bank might be indicated and
named:
Bend
: This description-point would be imagined
as the centre of a clock-face, which, for the purpose of illustration,
is shown drawn on the landscape.

(v) The following example illustrates the method of
indicating targets by this arrangement:

(
a
)
At 1,400—at junction of three hedgerows—bend—right—two
oâclock.—Ten rounds. Fire.

(
b
)
At 1,000—at spit of land—bend—left—between eight
and nine oâclock.—Fire.

(vi)
Indication by Description-Points, Finger-Breadths, and Clock-Face.
—Fig.
51 shows a sector consisting of a field of fire with
very little detail, in which targets might have to be indicated
by the use of description-points, combined with both
the finger-breadth and clock-face methods, which rarely have
to be used together in combination with description-points.

The small tree in centre of hedge, the right end of the
hedge, and the left end of the hedge, or the small tree to
the left, may be taken as description-points, named respectively

hedge right
,—
hedge left
,—
centre tree
, and
left
tree
. This will be an exception to the general rule that
no two points should consist of features of a similar nature,

125

but it is justified, as there is no danger of men confusing
these similar features in the case illustrated.

Fig. 51.
—
Description of Targets—Example of Field of Fire suitable for Employment
of Finger-Breadth and Clock-Face Methods, combined with Description Points.

(âSection Fireâ Landscape Target, Panel No. 3.)

Folds and ridges of ground could then be indicated in
the manner of the following examples:
At 900—at fold of
ground—centre tree—six oâclock—one-finger.
This would
mean that fire will be directed at a fold of ground one
finger-breadth directly below the centre tree. Another
example of this method is:
At 800—at ridge—left tree—right—three
oâclock—one finger.

10. Instruction in Description of Targets.
—Training in
description of targets should be carried out under practical
conditions, according to the rules laid down in the preceding
paragraphs. Training should be carried out on as
great a variety of ground as possible under all conditions
of light and atmosphere and at all ranges beyond close
range. Instruction in the description as well as recognition
of targets will form part of the field training, as well
as of the advanced musketry training of both fire-unit
commanders and men.

11.

In commencing an exercise, a front should always be
pointed out.
At first the aiming-points to be described
should be simple, and should consist of targets easily indicated
with the aid of description-points alone. Subsequently
more difficult targets may be indicated, which will
necessitate the employment of either the finger-breadth or
clock-face methods of description.

12.
Fire-unit commanders may be trained in classes
with a number of rifles on aiming-rests in the following
manner: The instructor will indicate various aiming-points
in different parts of a sector of ground to each member of
the class in turn, not verbally, but by aiming a rifle at it,
while the class are turned about, with their backs to the
instructor. The instructor will next move his rifle from
aim at the target and order the class to turn about, when
the fire-unit commander will describe the target in his own

126

words, using description-points alone, or combining their
use with the finger-breadth or clock-face methods, as may,
in his opinion, be necessary. The class will then aim their
rifles at the target which they recognize from his description.

If they do not recognize any target from his description, they
will not aim their rifles.

13.
The instructor will next note the target at which each
rifle has been aimed, and criticize faults both of description
and recognition, pointing out those which caused errors or
confusion.
Absolute accuracy of aim must be insisted upon,
and faults in aiming at targets correctly recognized must be
pointed out.

14. Indication of Targets in Strange Country.
—As the
nature of the ground and its features will vary greatly in
different kinds of country, fire-unit commanders and men
should be trained in the description and recognition of
targets, both before and during military operations in
unfamiliar country.

15. Standard of Indication.
—A very low standard of
indication is one which results in four out of every five in
the class recognizing the target from the description given,
for it must be remembered that the class will consist of
men who should have been thoroughly trained in military
vocabulary and study of ground before they commence their
instruction in recognition of targets. Fire-unit commanders,
therefore, will not be considered efficient in indicating
targets until all the members of a class are able with
ease to recognize a variety of targets described by him.

16. Instruction in Recognition of Targets.
—Instruction
in recognition of targets may be carried out on the same
method as training in description of targets, the targets
being described verbally by the instructor, or by an efficient
fire-unit commander. Men aiming at wrong targets, or
not aiming because they have failed to recognize the target,
will be asked to explain their difficulty, and the instructor

127

must try in each case to explain the cause of errors or failure
to recognize targets, with a view to helping men to overcome
it. Men will be trained to recognize targets by description-points
alone, as well as in combination with the
finger-breadth and clock-face methods.

17. Instruction on Miniature Ranges.
—Training in description
and recognition of targets can be carried out on
miniature ranges, as described in Sec. 72, para. 8 (ii).

Section
46
.—Fire Orders.
23

1. Words of Command.
—The following words of command
will be used as may be found necessary:

At
—(
Elevation and deflection
).

At
—(
Object
).

Fire or

Rapid Fire

On which the firer will load, adjust
his sights, aim and fire, deliberately or
rapidly.

Cease Fire

On which fire will be discontinued, and
the firer will bring the rifle to the
loading position, recharge the magazine,
and apply the safety-catch.

Rest

On which the safety-catch will be applied
and an easy position assumed.

When rifles are not provided with
on the command â
Rest
â
the cut-off will be pressed in, the bolt
opened and closed, and the spring
eased.

Unload

On which all cartridges will be removed
from the chamber and magazine, and
other motions performed as detailed
in Sec. 27, para. 4.

128

2.
Words of command in fire orders will be as few as
possible.
They must be announced clearly and deliberately
by fire-unit commanders, and repeated if necessary, should
they notice by the actions of their men that they are not
properly heard or understood.
If the noise of firing, the distance
due to deployment of the unit, the wind, or other conditions
prevent the hearing of orders, they must be passed
from N.C.O. to N.C.O., from observer to observer, or from
man to man.

3.
As already stated, when possible, directions as to
sighting as well as the target
will be given before the occasion
for firing arises, and fire will be opened without further
orders as soon as the target appears
. Orders for adjusting
the sights should be given first, so that there may be no
necessity for the firers to remove their eyes from the target
after it is indicated, otherwise the order of the words of
command is not of material importance.

4. Anticipatory Orders.
—Fire orders should anticipate
events as far as possible, so that lengthy orders will not be
needed after the target appears. The following is an example
of an anticipatory order, which includes the use of
combined sights:
The enemy is about to advance from that
fir-wood on the hill half left. When he moves, concentrate
on the thickest part of his line—1250 and 1350.

5.
If all ranks are kept informed of the course of events,
24

and led to anticipate occasions for fire action,
there should
be no need for any words of command other than those which

129

regulate movement, the opening and closing of fire, and the
rate of fire
; and even these may be dispensed with if the
firers are well trained, and combine their efforts according
to orders issued in anticipation.
The results of observation
and alterations to be made in sighting or point of aim must be
notified at once.

6. Instruction in Fire Orders.
—Fire-unit commanders,
observers, and N.C.O.âs should be thoroughly trained in
giving clear, concise fire orders under practical conditions.
They must watch to see if their orders are understood by
the actions of their men.
Men must be trained not to put
their rifles to their shoulders until they understand the orders
given and recognize the target indicated.
This rule is essential

to prevent useless waste of ammunition in war
, and to
serve as a check in peace training, as to whether orders are
given or passed from man to man so that they are immediately
understood and carried out by the men. It will
enable fire-unit commanders to know when their orders
are not heard or understood, and also enable company
and platoon commanders to supervise the training of fire-unit
commanders.

7. Passing Fire Orders from Man to Man.
—(i) Soldiers
are trained in passing short verbal messages and orders
accurately and quickly as part of their field-training, and
this instruction is contained in
Drill and Field-Training
of
this series in Sec. 8 and also in Sec. 42, which deals with training
in passing messages in whispers during night operations.
Training in passing fire orders quickly and accurately from
man to man is a vitally important part of the musketry
training of N.C.O.âs, observers, and men. Orders passed
from man to man in the firing-line must be short. They
may be passed a sentence or two at a time, or as a whole,
the latter being the best and quickest method if orders are
short.

(ii)
Instruction in passing Fire Orders.
—Fire-units must be trained

130

thoroughly in passing fire orders, and this duty should be
practised during extended order drill, and later during
manÅuvre, when units are deployed, and especially when
they are firing with blank cartridge, so as to accustom men
to listening to orders and passing them while firing and in
the noise it involves. In practising passing orders from
man to man, an N.C.O. should be told off to record orders
passed from man to man as received at the end of a line to
check their accuracy.

8. Instruction on Miniature Ranges.
—Fire orders can
be practised on the miniature range as described in
Sec. 74, para. 4 (iii).

Section
47
.—Fire Discipline.

1. Importance of Fire Discipline.
—If full effect is to be
obtained from the results of fire, a high standard of fire
discipline in men is as important as skilful direction and
control of fire by commanders.

2. Qualities Necessary for Fire Discipline.
—Good fire discipline
demands the following qualities in men:

(i) Strict attention to the signals and orders of the commander,
combined with intelligent observation of the
enemy.

(ii) Careful adjustment of the sight, economy of ammunition,
and prompt cessation of fire when ordered or
when the target disappears.

(iii) Power to endure the enemyâs fire even when no
reply is possible.

(iv) A cool and intelligent use of the rifle when the commander
can no longer exercise control.

3. Rules for Fire Discipline.
—In addition to the above
qualities, men must be trained to carry out their duties
according to the following rules:

(
a
) In collective firing no man will fire until he clearly

131

recognizes the target described by his commander, or
without selecting a definite target in individual firing.

(
b
) In collective firing every man will press his trigger
independently.
Bursts of independent fire are more effective
than volleys.

(
c
) As a rule fire should be delivered deliberately, but
each man must always satisfy himself that every time
he presses the trigger he will hit the object aimed at.

(
d
) If rapid fire is ordered, every man will fire at his own
best rate for combining rapidity with accuracy.

(
e
) Each man will take care to pass orders carefully and
accurately.

(
f
) Each man will make the best use of ground and
cover,
primarily to increase fire effect
, and secondarily for
concealment and protection. He must remember that the
most important requirement, when firing from behind
cover, is the ability of a man to use his rifle to the best
advantage, and that
his eyes must be kept on the enemy
between shots to avoid losing sight of targets
.

(
g
)
Each man must watch the front and remain alert and
attentive while awaiting orders. He must open fire smartly
when ordered to do so on such fleeting targets as troops in
movement, and continue firing, unless otherwise ordered,
while they present a favourable target during movement.

(
h
) He must, when employing individual fire on the
defensive, especially at shorter ranges,
mark down troops by
noting their position on the ground or behind cover, and open
fire the moment they expose themselves or rise up to advance
.

4. Working in Pairs.
—Combined action is always more
likely to be successful than isolated effort, and so long as
control is possible the individual man must watch his
leader and do his best to carry out his intentions. When,
however, the section is under heavy fire, section commanders
cannot always exercise direct control, and in these
circumstances men should endeavour to work in pairs, indicating

132

targets and estimating the range for each other,
firing steadily, observing the results of each otherâs fire,
and husbanding their ammunition.

5. Ammunition.
—If incapacitated from advancing, the
soldierâs first duty is to place his ammunition in a conspicuous
place, ready to be picked up by other men, and
all ranks must seize opportunities that offer for replenishing
their ammunition in this manner.

6. Duty of Soldier when separated from Unit Commander.
—If,
when reinforcing the firing-line, or at any
other time, a soldier loses touch with his section commander,
it is his duty to place himself under the orders of
the nearest officer or non-commissioned officer, irrespective
of the company or battalion to which he may belong.

7. Training in Fire Discipline.
—The foundation of training
in fire discipline will be laid in the general training of
the soldier, especially in the instruction which imbues him
with the soldierly spirit, and develops his character in
discipline and other soldierly qualities.
25
The recruitâs instruction
in aiming and firing and fire discipline will be
carried out concurrently with his training in drill in both
close and extended order, as laid down in the directions
for the annual individual training of the soldier in
Infantry
Training, 1914
, and other official textbooks. Training in fire
discipline may commence when the recruit is sufficiently
instructed in aiming and firing, and will be combined with
training in extended order drill.
Fire discipline can only
be taught by constant and systematic training.

8. Exercises in Fire Discipline.
—These exercises should
be carried out progressively. In the preliminary stages of
instruction men should be trained in squads, as already

133

described in para. 9, the fire orders being simple and the
targets easy to recognize. More advanced stages of instruction
in fire discipline will be combined with the
soldierâs training in extended order drill and manÅuvre
(see Chapters III and VII of
Drill and Field Training

of this series), and also during advanced stages of musketry
training. Thus training in fire discipline can be combined
with field exercises consisting of tactical schemes in attack
and defence, etc., when blank cartridge is used, and with
fire direction and collective field practices fired with ball
cartridge on field firing ranges.

9. Preliminary Exercises.
—(i) In preliminary exercises
the squad will be drawn up in line at one or two paces
interval, and on the command from the instructor—
Sitting,
Standing, or Kneeling, at
(range);
at
(object);
Fire

or
Rapid fire
—will perform the necessary motions, and
continue firing until the order
Cease fire
or
Unload
is given.
If no orders are given as to the firing position, the squad
will assume the lying position. The standing, kneeling,
and sitting positions will only be practised under conditions
suitable to their employment.

(ii) If it is desired to change front or position, the instructor
will give the necessary commands, but without
as a rule causing fire to cease. All commands given during
firing are to be passed down the line of firers, to practise
them in passing orders, the orders being taken down at the
of the line to check their accuracy.

10.
When the squad has gained sufficient experience,
the fire orders should be combined with those for movement,
as in the following example, given to a section in fours:

Section, line that ridge—To the left three paces extend—At
1,000—At the enemy just left of that house on the hill, half
left—Fire—Cease Fire—Advance.
In exercises carried out
with blank ammunition,
the safety-catch will be applied
,
or rifles will be
unloaded
or
sloped
, before a movement is

134

undertaken. In all fire discipline exercises the rule mentioned
in Sec. 46, para. 6, regarding not bringing the rifle to the
shoulder if they do not recognize targets, should be strictly
observed by men for the reasons given.

11. Development of Individual Judgment.
—In more
advanced exercises, to develop individuality, the complete
detail of commands will occasionally be dispensed with.
Thus, on a target appearing suddenly for a limited time, the
executive command
Fire
or
Rapid Fire
only will be given,
on which each individual will adopt the firing position he
considers most suitable to the tactical conditions, adjust
his sight, and open fire. The instructor will observe and
criticize the positions and the sighting of the rifles.

12. Instruction on Miniature Ranges.
—Instruction in
fire discipline can be carried out on miniature ranges
during the Fire Direction Practices and Collective Field
Practices contained in Sec. 74.

135

CHAPTER VII

GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING RANGE
AND FIELD PRACTICES

Section
48
.—Preliminary Training.

1. Lectures.
—The instruction contained in Chapters I
to VI of this book is classified under the head of Preliminary
Training, as it lays the foundation of the soldierâs training
in the use of the rifle, and prepares him for instruction
in both range and field practices. Thus, preliminary
training commences with information regarding the construction
of the rifle and directions for taking care of the weapon
and cleaning it, includes instruction in aiming, firing, visual
training, and ranging, and concludes with standard tests in
preliminary training and grouping practices on miniature
and 30 yards ranges. An extremely important part of
preliminary training consists of a systematic course of
lectures given concurrently with practical instruction.
These lectures will deal with the theory of rifle fire, important
points in elementary training, and the tactical application
of fire through fire direction and control, including the
use of ground and cover, and the duties of fire-unit commanders
and observers in the firing-line [see Sec. 74,
para. 5 (iii)].

2. Recruits.
—Although it is only by practice in shooting
that a high degree of proficiency can be attained in the use
of the rifle, the ammunition allowances are necessarily
limited, and are calculated on the assumption
that firing will
be preceded by a most thorough course of preliminary instruction
.
Recruits, before they begin a course of firing, must reach a

136

satisfactory standard in aiming, and in holding their rifles
steadily while pressing the trigger, otherwise range practice
will merely result in waste of ammunition.

3.
Trained Soldiers.
—(i)
Besides thoroughly grounding
recruits in elementary training, trained soldiers must also be
kept efficient in their preliminary instruction.
Preliminary
training in musketry exercises should therefore be continued
throughout the year by trained soldiers. Skill in judging
distance, a perfect trigger release, dexterity in the loading
motions, and the habit of adjusting sights, cannot be
retained without frequent practice.

(ii) It is therefore of the utmost importance that trained
soldiers should develop by constant practice a habit of
recognizing targets, judging their distance, adjusting their
sights, and firing quickly but steadily without undue
effort. It is advisable to test the ability of trained soldiers
in the standard tests of preliminary training before they
begin firing in range practices. Reconnaissance and ranging
exercises will be a necessary preliminary to successful
fire direction.

Section
49
.—Tests of Preliminary Training.

1. Objects of Tests.
—The tests of elementary training have
been devised to fulfil the following purposes:

(i) Provide instructors with a means of testing recruits
to insure that they have reached a sufficient standard
before they begin range practices.

(ii) Insure that trained soldiers have retained their
efficiency.

(iii) Prevent any detail of elementary training from
being overlooked.

(iv) Provide a standard to be attained by technical and
other troops who are unable to devote as much time as is
desirable to elementary training.

137

2. Nature Of Tests.
—These tests are divided into
oral
,

inspection
, and
standard
tests. It is important that teaching
should not be confused with testing. In the former a
man is instructed by example and explanation; in the latter
he is questioned, or ordered to carry out a certain exercise
without any explanation or assistance, and either passes
the qualifying standard or is relegated for further instruction.

3. Record of Tests.
—A record will be kept for each
man of the results of the various tests, which will be
inspected periodically by the commanding officer. Extracts
from these records will furnish useful guides as to
efficiency when men are transferred to other companies or
battalions. Men, particularly recruits, should themselves
keep a record of their performances.

4. Oral Tests.
—(i)
Care of Arms and Ammunition.
—A few
questions should be put to each man on these subjects.

(ii)
General Theoretical Knowledge.
—A few questions should be
put to each man regarding the theory of rifle fire and its
practical application.

(iii)
Description of Targets.
—Each man separately should be
called upon to describe one or two objects in a landscape,
and be questioned as to shape, colours, sizes, units of
measure, etc.

5.
Inspection Tests.
—(i)
Firing Positions.
—Every man should
be inspected individually in all firing positions, and the
existence of any of the following serious faults should be
noted in a book for production at subsequent tests:
(
a
) Firing from left shoulder; (
b
) eye near cocking-piece
or thumb in aiming; (
c
) want of grip with either hand;
(
d
) finger round trigger in loading position; (
e
) excessive
constraint of the limbs, body, or head in firing.

(ii)
Fire Discipline.
—Men should be tested for ability to
execute orders for fire direction and control rapidly and
correctly, including accurate adjustment of sights after each

138

advance in attack, and after every advance of the enemy—represented
by fatigue-men—at distances between 600 and
1,400 yards.

6. Standard Tests.
—(i)
Regulation Aim.
—To be tested by
triangle of error.
Standard—No side of a triangle to be
over one-third of an inch, or the centre of the triangle more
than one-third of an inch from the instructorâs aim.

(ii)
Trigger-Pressing.
—Trigger-pressing will be tested by
means of the aim-corrector.

(iii)
Adjustment of Sights.
—Several distances will be named
and sights examined after three seconds [M.L.E. rifle, five
seconds].

(iv)
Aiming-Off for Wind or Movement.
—Tests in aiming-off for
wind. The men will be ordered to lay their rifles on a point
at some number of feet, not exceeding 6, right or left of
a fatigue-man. One foot of error only, measured from the
regulation point of aim, will be allowed. Allowance in
aiming-off for wind or movement will be tested with the
aim-corrector, the percentage of serious errors being
recorded.

(v)
Rapidity of Aim.
—The time required to bring the rifle
from the loading position to the shoulder, on the command

Fire
, and to align the sights on an aiming disc held to the
eye, will be measured with a stop or ordinary watch with a
second-hand. Lying position.

The instructor will stop the watch when the trigger is
pressed, provided he is satisfied with the aim.
Standard
time, four seconds.

(vi)
Rapid Loading.
—The men to be tested will be equipped
with a bandolier, pouch, or cartridge pockets, and six
chargers filled with dummy cartridges. The chargers will
be placed in the pouches or pockets, which will be buttoned
over them. The time required to load, close the bolt,
eject the cartridges, the rifle being held in the correct
loading position, one charger being inserted at a time, the

139

pouch or pocket, whether empty or not, being buttoned
up every time a charger is withdrawn, will be noted.

Standard time, one minute.

(vii)
Rapid Firing.
—This will be a combination of (v) and
(vi). On the command
Rapid fire
, each man will load
with dummy cartridges in chargers from the pouch or
cartridge pocket, the pocket being buttoned up each time
a charger is withdrawn, and aim ten rounds at an aiming
disc held to the instructorâs eye. If the aiming is unsatisfactory,
the test will be repeated more slowly. The time
required will be noted.
Standard time, one minute.

(viii)
Eyesight.
—To be carried out in conjunction with
Standard Test (iii). Four fatigue-men as âpointsâ should
be placed under cover in various directions and at different
distances, not exceeding 800 yards. The men to be tested
lie down extended to two paces. Each point is called up
by signal.

The fatigue-man stands, kneels, or raises his head, according
to the degree of visibility required, and fires four
rounds of blank ammunition in half a minute, then returning
to cover. During the half-minute the observers adjust
their sights and place their rifles at armâs length to the
front.

At the end of the half-minute a whistle is blown, and
those men who have failed to discern the point are noted,
while non-commissioned officers record the elevations
found on the sights in connection with Standard Test (x).

In every case the point should be signalled to rise a
second time in order that his position may be shown to those
men who previously failed to see him, and half a minute
should then be allowed to these men to adjust their sights
for Standard Test (x). Failures must not exceed one per
man, but consideration must be given to the visibility of the
points.

(ix)
Recognition of Targets.
—The men to be tested should

140

each have an aiming-rest or sandbags for laying aim. A
non-commissioned officer from behind them will describe
some difficult aiming-point, such as a point in a hedge or
area of open ground. The men aim their rifles at the point
which they recognize from the description. Four points
should be described for every man tested.

(x)
Judging Distance.
—The distances of four standing
fatigue men should be judged at distances not exceeding
800 yards.

(xi)
Grouping with Miniature Cartridges.
—For regular troops,
the grouping standards for miniature cartridge practice at
25 yards will be: Marksmen, 1-inch ring; 1st Class, 2-inch
ring; 2nd Class, 3-inch ring.

Section
50
.—Progression of Instruction in Range
and Field Practices.

1.
After the soldier has been trained thoroughly in elementary
instruction in aiming and firing, and has passed
the oral inspection and standard tests of preliminary training
satisfactorily, he may be considered fit to commence range
practices, with which his instruction in individual and collective
firing will begin. The progression of this instruction
may be divided roughly into the following stages:

(i)
Individual Firing.
—(
a
) Instruction on miniature ranges
and 30 yards ranges.

(
b
) Range practices.

(
c
) Individual field practices.

(ii)
Collective Firing.
—Collective field practices.

2. Instruction on 30 Yards and Miniature Ranges.
—Instruction
on 30 yards ranges is dealt with in Sec. 55.
Instruction on miniature ranges is dealt with fully in
Chapter X, which contains directions for firing elementary
and instructional range practices, as well as individual
and collective field practices on these ranges.

141

3.
Range Practices.
—Range practices consist of the
following practices and stages of instruction:

(i)
Practices.
—(
a
)
Grouping.
(
b
)
Application.

(
c
)
Snap-shooting.
(
d
)
Rapid Firing.

(ii)
Stages of Instruction.
—The above practices are arranged in
a series of tables for recruits and trained soldiers, demanding
a gradually increasing degree of skill on the part of the
firer, and are divided into the following stages of instruction:

(
a
)
Qualifying Practices.
(
b
)
Instructional Practices.

(
c
)
Classification Practices.

4. Field Practices.
—Individual and collective field practices
are dealt with in this chapter and in Chapters VIII
and X. The general programme of field practice should
be arranged as follows:

(i) Individual field practices.

(ii) Fire direction practices.

(iii) Collective field practices, divided into—

(
a
) Exercises for sections and platoons in fire direction
and application of collective fire.

(
b
) Standard tests of collective grouping and fire effect.

(
c
) Comparative demonstrations of fire effect and vulnerability.

(
d
) Exercises for companies designed to reproduce
service conditions as far as possible, and to illustrate
tactical principles.

(iv) Combined field firing (see
Musketry Regulations
).

Section
51
.—Range Practices.

1.
When recruits have shown clearly that they have
acquired a satisfactory standard of skill in all branches of
preliminary training, they will commence range practices.

Range practices merely lay the foundation of musketry in
its elementary stages.
They are only a means to an end—namely,
to prepare soldiers for field practices, by which

142

they are trained to fire under conditions approximating as
closely as possible to those of service.

2. Qualifying Practices.
—The range practices for the Regular
Army and Special Reserve begin with qualifying practices,
for which standards are prescribed.
If these standards
are not attained, it is a sign that the preliminary training has
failed in its object.
After passing standard tests in miniature
range practice, and firing on the 30 yards range, every
man should begin his practice on the open range confident in
his own powers, and determined to prove his ability to hit.

3. Preliminary Training and Range Practices.
—Instructional
range practices need not be continuous. Intervals
of time between the exercises are often beneficial, especially
to nervous men; but in any case, time should be found to
continue the exercises of preliminary training on days
allotted to range practices, in order that there may be no
separation between theory and practice.

4. Scope of Range Practices.
—(i) In range practices the
soldier should attain a high standard of skill in shooting at
known distances under easy conditions and in various
positions, at large vertical targets easy to see, and furnished
with scoring or approximation rings, which enable the
error in shooting to be expressed in figures convenient for
comparative purposes.

(ii) He will confirm in practice the lessons learned in
preliminary training, and be thoroughly acquainted with
the peculiarities of his rifle. He will fire in the open and
from behind cover in deliberate and rapid practices, and will
learn the rate of fire which, in his own case, best combines
volume with accuracy. In snapshooting he will realize
the necessity for rapid alignment of sights, and the value
of time in taking advantage of targets exposed under
service conditions.

5. Hints to Instructors
—(i)
False Standards
.—Instructors
must guard against the danger of men setting up false

143

standards of musketry based on the results of their shooting
in range practices. Lectures based on the instruction laid
down in Sec. II. may be given to recruits at the commencement
of or during range practices, so that they clearly
understand that the assurance of effect in battle through
individual fire is limited to distances within close range,
and that collective fire is necessary for fire effect beyond
close range.

(ii)
Deliberate Practices.
—Instructors must bear in mind that
deliberate practice at bullâs-eye targets tends to inculcate
a slow method of shooting, as minute attention to changes
of wind and light, and fine adjustments of the backsight
based on shot-by-shot marking, are necessary to produce
the best results under such conditions. Therefore, directly
recruits have attained a satisfactory degree of skill at
deliberate practices, they must commence snapshooting
and rapid firing.
Instructors must make it clear to soldiers
that high scores in range practices under easy conditions and
shot-by-shot marking bear no relation whatever to the results
to be expected from their skill when firing under service conditions
even in peace time.

(iii)
Range Practices and Service Conditions.
—In battle at close
range fire effect depends on snapshooting and rapid firing
under conditions in which the effect of wind and light may
usually be disregarded; alteration of sights is seldom possible,
and the result of fire is frequently impossible to
ascertain by observation. Beyond close range in battle,
accurate ranging, allowance for deflection due to wind, and
observation of fire, which are all necessary for accurate
individual firing, are beyond the powers of unassisted
individuals, even when targets are easy to discern and
recognize with the naked eye, which is not ordinarily the
case.

(iv) As the conditions of range practices differ in all
these important respects from those of service, it is clear

144

that another and extremely important stage of training,
for which range practices are only a preparation, must be
carried out before the soldier can be considered fit to perform
his duties in the firing-line efficiently. This further
stage of training is known as âfield practices.â

(v)
Standard of Accuracy.
—There is no object in establishing
a phenomenal standard of accuracy in elementary range
practices and deliberate shooting. A satisfactory degree
of proficiency is soon attained by the majority of men, and
they should then proceed to snapshooting and rapid firing
practices.
It is in snapshooting and rapid firing up to
600 yards that a very high degree of proficiency is desired.

(vi)
Faults of Aim.
—Although instruction on the firing-point
is an indispensable form of musketry instruction for
young soldiers, if it leads to continual alterations of sighting
to meet errors in shooting, the firer is confirmed in his
errors, and his faults are only obscured.
During the firing
the instructor should watch the recruit, not the target, and
should insist on being told the probable result of the shot
before it is signalled.

(vii)
Firing Positions.
—No departure from correct firing
positions should on any account be permitted. The rifle
must be gripped firmly, the face kept back from the right
hand, and there should be no constraint in the position of
the body.

(viii)
Breathing and Let-Off.
—The management of the breathing
and the let-off must be noticed, and the recruit reminded
of them continually, so that his mind may be centred on
the more important details of shooting, and not on changes
of wind or light, with which he will become familiar later.

(ix)
Dwelling on Aim.
—Although care and deliberation are
necessary in elementary firing instruction, recruits must
not be allowed to fall into the habit of dwelling on their
aim nor of aiming and returning to the loading position
repeatedly before pressing the trigger. These errors arise

145

chiefly from taking a fine sight, and focussing the eye on
the foresight instead of on the target. When such methods
are adopted, it is a sign that the object of range practices
is misunderstood, and that the firer is in need of more
practical instruction.

(x)
Shock of Discharge.
—In preliminary training the recruit
has not accustomed himself to the shock of discharge. In
some cases there is extreme difficulty in overcoming the
tendency to flinch from this shock, and this is one of the
commonest causes of inaccurate shooting. Men who flinch
should not proceed with firing practice. The cause of the
flinching can be detected, and can sometimes be removed
after one or two rounds only.

(xi)
Important Points for Instructional Practices.
—The following
are important points to remember with reference to range
practices:

(
a
) That best instruction available must always be given.

(
b
) One instructor can only watch and instruct one man
at a time.

(
c
) No hurry should be allowed. It is better to discuss
the reasons for failure of a few shots thoroughly than to
hurry over many.

(
d
) The first shot is the important one, and from the
result of it the others must be applied to hit the mark.

(
e
) A true declaration of the point of aim when the shot
was actually fired must be made immediately after firing.

(
f
) The firer or his rifle should never be touched. He
should be made to correct his position and alter his own
sights, etc., as required.

(
g
) The firer should not be told the reason for his faults
until he has first been questioned regarding them, and
made to reason out for himself the causes and remedies
for failure.

(xii)
Measures to prevent Faults becoming Habitual.
—It is a
common experience that serious faults become formed

146

habits in recruits before they are discovered by the instructor,
and that they are exposed only after repeated
visits to the range, by which time it will be difficult to correct
them. In order to compel analysis of faults, to indicate
clearly how defects may be remedied, and to remove all
suspicion as to the accuracy of his rifle, preliminary and
qualifying practices are divided into exercises in (
a
) grouping,
and (
b
) applying fire.

Section
52
.—Grouping and Application.

1. Definition of Grouping.
—The term âgroupâ as applied
to a number of shots fired at an objective has previously
been explained. Grouping practices consist of firing a
series of shots—usually five—at a distinct and fixed
aiming mark without any alteration of sighting or point
of aim.

2. Object of Grouping Practices.
—The object of grouping
practices is not to score hits on the mark aimed at, but to
develop in men the power of grouping a series of shots as
closely as possible. In other words, the object of these
practices is to teach soldiers to shoot steadily and consistently
as the foundation of their training in rifle-shooting.
When they are able to fire so that their shots are grouped
closely together, their training will be advanced another
stage to application practices, when they will be taught to
âapplyâ their shot groups to an aiming-mark. That is to
say, they will be taught to hit the mark aimed at, as well
as to group their shots closely.

3. Testing the Value of Groups.
—Thus, in grouping practices,
the position of a shot group in relation to the aiming-point
is no test of its value, which is judged only by the
closeness of the shots in each group. Shot groups are
measured by rings, as described in Sec. 56, para. 2, and in
Sec. 49, para. 6 (xi) (Miniature Ranges).

147

4. Point of Mean Impact.
—(i) When all the shots in a
group are contained in a measuring-ring, the point where
the centre of the ring falls on the target is termed the
point
of mean impact
. The position of the group in relation to
the point of aim is decided by recording the distance and
direction of the point of mean impact from the point of
aim. As already stated, the position of the group in relation
to the point of aim is immaterial, and it does not
matter if all the shots miss the point of aim. Nevertheless,
the position of the point of mean impact in relation to the
point of aim is important for instructional purposes, because
it indicates the constant faults of the firer and errors of the
rifle.

5. Faults of Firer shown by Shot Groups.
—For example,
a very small group well placed shows consistency of aim,
trigger-pressing, and holding. If badly placed, it may
show inaccuracy of the rifle, or a constant error in aiming.
A group dispersed vertically on the target shows vertical
variation either of the amount of foresight, or of the point
of aim; whilst a group dispersed horizontally shows
incorrect centring of the foresight in the notch of the backsight,
or horizontal errors in aiming. A group low left may
show forward movement of the shoulder; and one low
right may show jerking the trigger, and high right flinching.
These faults, however, can only be ascertained
if the firer
has been watched closely whilst firing
.

6. Analysis of Faults.
—(i) Thus, grouping practices are
valuable for discovering and correcting the faults of the
firer at the commencement of his instruction on the range.
Instructors should carefully note the positions of good
groups as well as bad ones, for some constant error in
aiming or fault of the rifle may thus be discovered, which
will escape notice in application practices when every shot
is signalled, and error is attributed to wind or other causes
for which allowance is easily made in sighting. Such errors

148

are not uncommon even among marksmen, and often affect
their shooting unfavourably in field practices when the
result of each shot is not signalled.

(ii)
Testing Rifle for Faults.
—Should a soldier make a bad
group, and the rifle is suspected, it should at once be fired
under similar conditions by a reliable marksman. Should
the marksman also make a bad group with the rifle, the
rifle should be tested according to the rules laid down in

Musketry Regulations
, and,
if found inaccurate, the man to
whom the rifle belongs should be allowed to recommence
the course, the necessary ammunition being found from the
authorized allowances
. If the rifle is proved accurate, the
soldierâs aim should next be tested by the triangle of error,
and his let-off should be tested by means of the aim-corrector.
His eyesight should also be examined.

(iii)
Faults due to Nervousness, etc.
—If no other cause for
constant faults can be discovered, unsteadiness may be
traced to illness, to some habitual excess, such as cigarette
smoking, to lack of determination, or to nervousness due
to some natural or exciting cause. If faults are found to
be due to nervousness or lack of will-power, the best remedy
lies in developing the power of nerve and muscular control
through physical exercises which develop these powers.
26

Rope-climbing is a good exercise for developing nerve and
will-power.

(iv)
Faults due to Firing Position, Eyesight, etc.
—Faults may
sometimes be remedied at once by correcting the fire positions,
by allowing time to elapse between the shots, or by
snapping practice. Some men can aim quickly, but lose
their power of seeing objects well defined if the eye is
strained by dwelling on aim. Thus, the cause of the failure
may sometimes be due to the firerâs effort to succeed. By
dwelling too long on aim the muscles of the eye become tired,
the vision becomes blurred, and the will-power is impaired.

149

It is necessary to take time in overcoming difficulties in
such cases. In serious cases the soldier should be examined
medically with a view to discharge, or the provision of
proper glasses.

(v)
Record of Analysis of Faults.
—A complete analysis of
the faults of the firer and his rifle should be made before
leaving the range, and a note should be made on the register
of the steps decided upon for remedying defects.

7. Application Practices.
—(i) When a man has acquired
sufficient skill in aiming and trigger-pressing to make a
good group with certainty, he will commence application
practices. These teach the firers to adjust their sights and
point of aim so as to apply the result of their groups to an
aiming mark.

(ii) Application practices should be fired first at bullâs-eye
targets similar to those used for grouping, but when
once a man becomes proficient at these easy targets, figure
targets should be used. Figure targets have been devised
to accustom men gradually to the difficult targets which
will be found in war, and also to counteract the following
faults: (
a
) Taking too long an aim; (
b
) taking a fine sight;
(
c
) focussing the eye on the foresight instead of the target
at the moment of firing.
All these are common errors when
a bullâs-eye target is used.

(iii) Grouping standards may in some cases be attached
to application practices in order to emphasize the importance
of care and consistency in shooting. In application
practices instruction is given in making allowance for
atmospheric influences, chiefly cross-winds; but it is not
desirable that trifling changes of wind should be met by
minute adjustment of the wind-gauge. The instructor
should call upon the soldier to estimate the wind before
firing, and tell him the corrected allowance which he is to
place on his sights. Subsequent alteration should be unnecessary.

In application, and, in fact, any practice, small

150

adjustments of sights should be discouraged.
The point
of aim should be varied as may be found necessary to
counteract any error of the rifle.

Section
53
.—Snapshooting, Rapid Firing, and Firing
at Crossing Targets.

1. Snapshooting.
—(i) Snapshooting means firing an effective
shot in the shortest possible time, and necessitates—

(
a
) Watching the front.

(
b
) Quickness of aim.

(
c
) Observation of the strike of the bullet, when
possible.

(
d
) Loading immediately after firing.

Snapshooting may follow application practices, and in
the early stages it is advisable to use the figure-targets
used for these practices, which can be exposed for any
length of time to suit the skill of the firers at different
stages of training. Six seconds is sufficient in the early
stages, and this may be reduced to four or three seconds as
progress is made.

(ii)
Snapshooting from Cover.
—In snapshooting practices
from cover, not only the exposure of the target, but also
that of the firer, should be limited. Strict attention must
be paid to adapting the firing positions correctly to cover,
and to firing with the least possible movement and exposure.

(iii)
Snapshooting on Miniature Ranges.
—Practices in snapshooting
on miniature ranges will be found in Chapter X.

2. Rapid Firing.
—(i) Rapid fire, which has been dealt with
in previous sections, means firing as many rounds as possible
with reasonable accuracy in a given time. This method of
firing shows the best rate of individuals, and brings out the
necessity for clean and quick loading and manipulation of
the bolt, with the butt to the shoulder, combined with

151

quickness of aim. The best rate of fire depends in every
case upon the degree of training of the individual and the
size and visibility of the aiming-mark. In rapid firing a
man of normal temperament should be able to attain the
regulation rate with trifling loss of accuracy,
but it is not
desirable to make a great sacrifice of accuracy to produce
even the regulation rate
.

(ii) Dexterity of loading and a habit of rapid alignment
of the sights should be developed in preliminary training.
In the range practices the opportunity is afforded to every
man to ascertain his own best rate for combining accuracy
in shooting with rapidity of fire so as to produce a high
average of hits per minute, but there is no obligation to
fire all the rounds allotted in any rapid practice.

(iii)
Rapid Firing on Miniature Ranges.
—Instructions for carrying
out rapid firing practices on miniature ranges will be
found in Chapter X.

3. Firing at Crossing Targets.
—As already stated, practices
in firing at crossing targets can be carried out economically
and with good results on miniature ranges. Practices
in firing at crossing targets are contained in Chapter X.

Section
54
.—Field Practices.

1. Scope of Training.
—(i) Field practice consists of firing
at service targets at unknown ranges under conditions
approximating as closely as possible to those of service.
In field practice every care should be taken to develop
further the skill already acquired in snapshooting and rapid
firing in instructional practices. The nerve control gained
in deliberate shooting should be supplemented by vigour
and alertness, deftness in loading, the habit of correct
action under distracting conditions, and skilful use of
cover, based on the determination to make fire effective.

(ii) There must be further training in picking up an indistinct

152

target, such as is likely to be presented in war, in
estimating its range, in rapidly opening fire, and in making
the best use of ground. Every individual must learn to
recognize the distances at which individual fire will be
effective, and to act in co-operation with his comrades.

(iii) Officers and fire-unit commanders must be practised
in their duties of direction, control, and observation of fire,
in the use of ground, and in mutual support. With these
must be combined the study of the results to be obtained
from the delivery of concentrated fire at targets representing
troops in different formations, and on ground of varying
character, in order that practical experience may be acquired
of the principles which govern the employment of
fire in the field.

(iv) Under the conditions of peace manÅuvres with blank
ammunition, fire control may be neglected, targets may be
insufficiently described, and it is not known whether the
firers recognize them, distances are sometimes roughly
guessed, sights are not always adjusted, and men aim carelessly.
Unless, therefore, tactical exercises are conducted
sometimes with ball ammunition, there will be a want of
realism in training during peace time.

2. Individual Field Practices
—(i)
Progression of Training
.—Training
in individual field practices may be carried out
in the following stages: (
a
) Snapping at vanishing figures
without firing; (
b
) practices on miniature ranges, or 30 yards
range with Solano or other figure targets; (
c
) individual
field practices on open ranges.

(ii) In the individual practices each firer will be provided
with a separate target. He will learn to fire at unknown
distances, depending on the observation of a comrade
for information as to the result of his shots. He will fire
at targets representing an advancing enemy, and will
advance himself, firing at each halt. He will learn to use
ground for fire effect and cover, to pass all orders and information

153

received, to recognize the limits for effective individual
fire, and the principles which govern the choice of
targets in individual fire.

(iii) It will be well to conclude the individual field practices
with a demonstration of the comparative inefficiency
of individual fire at distances beyond 600 yards. This may
be effected by detailing individuals to fire at low service
targets, and noting the time required to produce any
required effect, and then applying collective fire at the
same targets under proper direction and control of fire
leaders, equipped with field-glasses.

(iv)
Points for Criticism.
—Instructors should note the following
points for criticism, besides faults connected with
any lessons taught in the course of elementary training:

(
a
) Correct use of ground and cover, and correct method
of resting rifle when possible.

(
b
) Watching the front and quick location of targets,
including marking down.

(
c
) Accurate judging distance within close range.

(
d
) Quick opening of fire and rate of fire.

(
e
) Instant reloading after firing.

(
f
) Reloading magazine as opportunity occurs.

(
g
) Co-operation when working in pairs, including the
following points: (1) Consultation as to choice of targets;
(2) hesitation in opening fire and settling who shall fire and
who shall observe; (3) whether observer reports results of
shots accurately.

(v)
Justification for Opening Fire.
—Men will be trained in individual
field practices to use their judgment as to opening
fire. Tendency to open fire prematurely must be checked,
and men must be taught to watch for favourable targets and
good opportunities so as to enable them to obtain the
fullest effect from fire.

(vi)
Choice of Targets.
—Men must also be trained to choose
their targets so as to obtain the fullest effect from fire—that

154

is to say, they must choose the most favourable target
presented at any moment.

3. Fire Direction Practices.
—(i) Just as the men have
been trained in progressive stages in preliminary training,
range practices, and individual field practices, so fire-unit
commanders must be practiced thoroughly in fire-direction,
and make a careful study of it before undertaking the direction
of collective field practices.

(ii) These practices are useful for training officers and
N.C.O.âs in simple problems connected with the tactical
application of fire, and to illustrate clearly that fire effect
depends on (
a
) correct estimation of range, (
b
) fire orders
being clearly given, correctly understood, and instantly
obeyed. In other words, these practices serve to prove
that good fire direction and control and fire discipline are
essential for fire effect beyond close range.

(iii)
Progression of Training.
—Fire direction practices may be
carried out in the following stages: (
a
) On the Solano Target,
or landscape targets, without firing; (
b
) on miniature and
30 yards ranges, with ·22 and ·303 cartridges on Solano
Target, or landscape targets; (
c
) on open ranges at distances
beyond 600 yards.

(iv) At the conclusion of the fire-direction practices, all
fire-unit commanders should be familiar with the effects
of winds and temperature in shooting at 500, 1,000, 1,500,
and 2,000 yards. The range tables should be studied, and
lectures given on the influence of ground, ranging errors,
and other details of fire direction.

(v)
Concentration and Distribution of Fire.
—Fire-direction
practices will afford opportunities for training fire-unit
commanders in the concentration and distribution of fire (see
Sec. 44, paras. 8 and 9). Fire should generally be concentrated
against very vulnerable targets, or when it is required
to produce great effect at a particular point; it should be
distributed when it is required to disturb the enemyâs

155

aim along a portion of his front in order to assist movement.

(vi) For example, a company commander wants to produce
great effect at a particular point, so he concentrates
the whole of his fire on it; or he wishes to strike the enemyâs
line in two, four, or eight places, and orders:
By platoons
,
or
By sections
, when the commanders of these units each
select an aiming-mark for their unit in the enemyâs front
corresponding to the position of their own unit in the
company. Should the company commander wish each
man to select his own aiming-mark in the enemyâs line corresponding
to his own position in the company, he orders:

Distribute fire
.

(vii) The chief guides in deciding on the amount of distribution
to be employed will be the visibility of the aiming-marks,
the volume of fire available, and the range. In the
absence of clear aiming-marks service targets usually
consist of large scattered groups, which require a greater
volume for assurance of fire effect. The greatest distribution
of fire occurs when each man selects his own aiming-mark.
Such distribution will not as a rule be employed
beyond 600 yards, owing to the difficulty at longer ranges
of finding sufficient aiming-marks.

4. Collective Field Practices.
—(i) Collective field practices
are primarily intended to afford the commanders of fire
units practice in their duties of direction and control of fire.
With this must be combined the study of the results to be
obtained from the delivery of fire at targets representing
troops in different formations, on ground of varying character,
in order that practical experience may be acquired of
the principles which govern the employment of fire in the
field.
Any omission or neglect in fire direction, as well as
any failure to adjust the sights, should, at this stage of training,
be regarded very seriously.

(ii)
Progression of Training.
—Training in collective field

156

practices will be carried out on the following stages: (
a
) On
the Solano Target, or landscape targets, without firing; (
b
) on
the miniature, or 30 yards range with the Solano Target, or
landscape targets; (
c
) on the open range.

(iii)
Points for Criticism.
—The principal points to be considered
in collective field practices are:

(
a
) The choice of targets.

(
b
) The justification or necessity for opening fire.

(
c
) The volume of fire required to effect the object in
view.

(
d
) The method of ranging and error of the day.

(
e
) The orders for fire direction.

(
f
) Timing of movement.

(
g
) Mutual support.

(
h
) Regulation of volume of fire.

(
i
) Concentration or distribution of fire.

(
k
) The description and recognition of target and aiming-point.

(
l
) Skilful use of ground and cover.

(
m
) Reinforcement.

(
n
) Ammunition supply.

(
o
) Mutual assistance.

(
p
) Passing of orders and information.

(
q
) Communication with flanks and rear.

Note.
—With respect to (
a
) and (
b
), all opportunities for
delivering enfilade, oblique, or converging fire should be
seized, together with opportunities for bringing a crushing
volume of fire to bear on favourable targets and at critical
moments. Further important points which may be considered
in collective field practices are the necessity for
searching or distribution in depth and the probable dispersion
of the cone of fire.

(iv)
Tactical Schemes.
—
Section and Platoon Exercises.
—The
earlier exercises for the smaller fire units will be carried out

157

under simple tactical schemes framed by the company commander,
and arranged so as to give a progressive training
to all ranks engaged. Schemes will be so drawn up as to
give separate instruction in each phase of the combat,
rather than to combine in each exercise all the operations
included in the execution of a successful attack. They
will also be designed to illustrate the various situations
which may be expected on active service. They should
test the proficiency of leaders in making fire effective on
first opening and in regulating the volume of fire in accordance
with the situation. Mutual support and combined
action should be frequently practised, with and without
the exercise of control. (See
Musketry Regulations
, Sec. 98.)

(v)
Company Exercises.
—
Combined Field Firing.
—When all
the fire-unit commanders have shown proficiency in fire direction
and control, companies will be trained to fire collectively
against firing-lines at effective ranges. The leaders will be
exercised in judging distance, in describing targets, and in
concentration or distribution of fire. Great weight will be
attached to the accurate passing of orders and information,
and to the quickness of the men in recognizing their targets
and applying fire. (See
Musketry Regulations
, Sec. 101.)

(vi)
Criticism of Collective Field Practices.
—At the conclusion of
a collective field practice, in addition to criticism of the
conduct of the exercise, there should be a conference as to
the conclusions to be drawn from the results. For this
reason a complete record must be made of the targets and
conditions; the figures showing results must be carefully
and fully tabulated.

The criticism of the conduct of the exercise should be
complete, and should deal with the application of the
tactical principles laid down in the Training Manuals, as
well as with the application of the principles contained in
these regulations. In appreciating results, chief attention
should be paid to the successful or unsuccessful result of the

158

first application of fire, since surprise effect is all-important,
and correction of sighting by observation is rarely possible
in war.

(vii)
Results of Firing.
—The percentage of hits to rounds
fired is an index to the steadiness of the firing only if the
fire direction has been proved to be satisfactory. If the
fire direction fails, the more accurate the shooting the
fewer will be the hits recorded. In considering the results
of fire, the percentage of loss inflicted on the enemy within
a limited period of time is the best means of judging the
value of the fire.

For general comparison of the collective fire results of
units, the average number of hits per man per minute should
be calculated if fire was concentrated, or the average number
of figures hit per man per minute if it was distributed, but
due regard must be paid to the justification of the rate of
fire as indicated by the scheme.

159

CHAPTER VIII

CONDUCT OF RANGE AND FIELD PRACTICES

Section
55
.—Thirty Yards Ranges.

1.
When no classification range is available, elementary
practices with service ammunition may be carried out on
a 30 yards range. Such practice will render recruits familiar
with the discharge of the rifle, and improve their trigger
release under easy conditions. No practice will take place
unless an officer or experienced serjeant is present.

2. Precautions for Safety.
—All precautions for safety will
be taken. Loading, in all positions except lying, will be
carried out with the rifle held just above the waist, and
the muzzle directed towards the target.
Charging or uncharging
magazines is not to be carried out with the muzzle
pointing upwards.

3. Practices.
—Practice at vanishing, moving, and landscape
targets can be carried out as on miniature ranges,
but with service ammunition. Long-range sighting-targets
should be provided as a means of ascertaining the error
of the rifle, and practice may be carried out with long-range
sights.

Section
56
.—Grouping Practices.

1.
One firer will be detailed to each target, and fire five
shots, maintaining the regulation point of aim throughout.
Targets will be changed, and a second detail of men will fire

160

similarly. Both details will then proceed to the targets,
see their groups measured, and note the positions of the
points of mean impact with reference to the points aimed
at. If it is impracticable to proceed to the targets, the
group may be marked by means of small spotting-discs
(see also Appendix, VI, para. 2, note 3).

2. Rules for Measuring Groups.
—(i) The groups will be
measured with wire rings, 4, 8, and 12 inches in diameter,
counting 25, 20, and 15 points respectively; 10 points will
be allowed for a 12-inch group with one wide shot.

(ii) The ring which will contain all the shots will be
recorded as the measure of the group. A shot-mark is
included within a ring when it cuts the circumference of
the largest circle which can be described within that ring
by means of a pencil held at right angles to the target.

(iii) All shot marks found on a target will be included in
the group to be measured. No points will be allotted to a
group unless there are five shot-marks at least on the target.
If more than five shot-marks are found on the target, there
will be no score, and the practice will be repeated.

(iv)
Point of Mean Impact.
—When the ring is placed to
include all the shots, the centre of the ring will be taken as
approximately the point of mean impact. Its distance
from, and direction with reference to, the point aimed at
will be recorded on the register—
e.g.
, 7 inches, four oâclock.

(v) On return to the firing-point other details will fire,
but steps will be immediately taken to ascertain the cause
of any bad shooting of men in the first two details.

3. Third-Class Shots.
—As a rule, third-class shots should
not be allowed ammunition for further training in application
practice until a satisfactory standard in grouping has
been attained. This may be fixed at a ring of diameter
equal to one-three-hundredth of the range, but officers
should exercise their discretion as to allowing one wide shot
in five when dealing with young soldiers.

161

Section
57
.—Timed Practices.

1. Deliberate Practices.
—In deliberate practices, twenty
seconds is the time limit allowed for each shot, reckoned
from the act of loading. If there is a tendency to exceed
the limit, a whistle should be used to mark the beginning
and end of each period, but not otherwise.

2. Timed Exposure of Targets.
—The timed exposure of
targets for snapshooting and rapid fire practices will be
reckoned from the time when the target is in position and
stationary to the time when it is again moved for lowering.
The movements of raising and lowering must be conducted
with the utmost rapidity, but without jarring the target
frames.

3. Timing in Rapid Practices.
—(i) Timing in rapid practices
should be reckoned from the word of command
â
Rapid Fire
,â and fire should be stopped by the command
â
Cease Fire
.â The command â
Rapid Fire
â should be
given as soon as the target appears. The target should
be lowered at the end of the time allowed for firing under
orders of the officer on butt duty, but the officer superintending
at the firing-point should also time the practice
and order â
Cease Fire
â at the end of the time allowed
for firing, reckoned from the command â
Rapid Fire
.â
Four points will be deducted for every shot fired after the
order to cease fire has been given.

(ii)
Charging Magazine in Rapid Practices.
—In rapid practices,
unless otherwise stated in the âInstructions for the
Conduct of the Practice,â the magazine will be charged
with four rounds, and the rifle will be loaded before the
target appears.

4. Firing from Cover.
—(i) In firing from behind cover,
the position adopted must be such as would enable the
firer on service to obtain the fullest protection from the
cover, having due regard to the efficiency of his fire. In

162

the prone position, the grip of the left hand must be maintained
on the rifle, and there must be no undue exposure
of the shoulder or legs.

(ii) In firing from behind cover, the butt of the rifle will
be in contact with the ground, and the firer will remain in
observation, but otherwise completely covered, until the
command â
Rapid Fire
â is given in rapid-firing practices,
or the target appears in âSnapshootingâ and âCrossing-Shotâ
practices. When snapshooting or firing rapid in
the open, the rifle may be held in the loading or aiming
position, as preferred.

5. Jambs.
—In the event of a jamb occurring in a timed
practice, and provided that it is not caused by any fault
on the part of the firer, the time allowed for the practice
will be increased to the extent due to the delay caused
thereby. Should, however, a jamb in a rapid practice be
due to a breakage of mechanism or other defect that cannot
readily be rectified on the range, the whole practice will be
fired again.

6. Missfires.
—In the event of missfires, extra rounds will
be allowed equal to the number of missfires in the practice
concerned, a proportionate part of the time allowed for the
whole practice being given for each extra round.

7. Extra Time.
—Whenever extra time is allowed for a
timed practice, a report giving the reason, and stating
whether the jamb or missfire was due to the rifle or to the
ammunition, will be rendered to Command Headquarters.

Section
58
.—General Rules for Range Practices.
27

1.
Range practices, unless otherwise ordered, will be
fired in drill order. Range practices should be fired, as far

163

as possible, in favourable weather. It is of the utmost
importance that recruitsâ firing should not take place in
cold and unsuitable weather.

2. Order of Practices.
—Range practices should as a rule
be fired in the order in which they appear in the tables,
but brigade commanders may vary the order at their
discretion. When deliberate and rapid practices for classification
are fired at the same distance, each man may
fire the rapid practice immediately after the deliberate
practice.

3.
In the case of ranges of less than full extent, general
officers commanding-in-chief may frame special instructions,
make proportionate changes in the size of targets, and vary
the points for classification.

4. Distribution of Ammunition.
—(i)
The general distribution
of ammunition laid down in the several parts of Tables
A and B respectively should be adhered to.
In the Regular
Army and Special Reserve not more than fifteen rounds
should be fired in one day, except in classification practices,
when twenty-five rounds may be fired, if necessary.
It is always better, when time is pressing, to reduce the
number of rounds fired in instructional practices than to
hurry through them. All available officers should be
present at the firing-points during instructional practices.

(ii)
Forfeiture of Rounds.
—Omission to fire the rounds allotted
and failure to fire during an exposure or run in
vanishing and moving practices will entail forfeiture of the
rounds that should have been fired, and misses will be
recorded for them. Ammunition required for repetition
of qualifying practices will, when necessary, be taken from
the surplus.

5. Firing Positions.
—In range practices the regulation
positions are obligatory, except in firing from cover, when
the rifle should be rested and the position adapted to the
ground. This includes resting the arm as well, if suitable,

164

but the cover is not to be specially constructed as a rest for
the rifle.

6. Commencing Practice.
—No man will load, or assume
a firing position, until the senior officer present has ordered
the practice to commence. After firing, men will return
to the loading position, but will not open the breech in the
deliberate practices until the last shot has been signalled.
If it is necessary to suspend firing, all men who are in position
will raise the safety-catch (or unload if no safety-catch
is provided), until the order is given to resume the
practice.

7. Important Rules.
—(i)
Loading.
—
Loading will always be
through the magazine.

(ii)
Sling.
—
Dependence on the sling should be discouraged,
and it will not be used for steadying the rifle in range
practices.

(iii)
Rifle.
—
No soldier equipped with a rifle is permitted
to fire with any but his own.

(iv)
Sighting Shots.
—
No sighting shots are allowed.

(v)
Men will fire singly, never in twos or threes.

8. Shots to verify Wind or Elevation.
—Occasional shots
to verify elevation or strength of wind, or to prove the
accuracy of a rifle, may sometimes be fired by an officer or
non-commissioned officer, with the senior officerâs permission.
They will not be fired during classification practices
or standard tests. Notification of their commencement
and conclusion will be made to the officer in the
butts by telephone, signal, or bugle-sound. The target in
use will be lowered and checked, and a clean one raised for
the occasional shots. When they are completed, it will
be lowered and checked, and the original target raised for
the firer to complete his rounds.

9. Resting Arm or Rifle.
—A coat or waterproof-sheet may
be used to protect the uniform, but
except when firing from
cover, or when rests are authorized, neither rifle, forearm,

165

wrist, nor hand, is to rest against anything, or to be supported
.

10.
No one is allowed at the firing-point, except the men
actually firing, the instructors, and officers. All non-commissioned
officers and men not on duty at the firing-point
will ground or pile arms, and remain not less than 30 yards
in rear of the firing-point. No shouting is allowed; men
next to fire will be brought up by signal.

11. Instruction during Intervals of Firing.
—(i) During
intervals of firing an opportunity should be given occasionally
to all ranks for revising their impressions as to the
visibility of the human figure at short distances, by placing
men on the firing-platforms up the range. The study of
visibility under conditions of known distance and in relation
to targets used for practice in shooting is especially valuable.

(ii) Those men who are not actually engaged in firing
should receive instruction in ground reconnaissance, use
of the eyes, use of field-glasses, range-finding, and description
of ground, while waiting behind the firing-point.

12. Field-Glasses.
—Field-glasses or telescopes will be
carried by all officers and section commanders. The men
should be encouraged to use them during spare time on the
range.

13. Condition of Sights.
—The sights will be used as
issued, without alteration of any kind. They may not be
blackened; the browning is renewed by an armourer when
required. No additions, marking, or colouring, are permitted,
nor are orthoptics allowed.

14. Observation Practices.
—The change which takes
place in conditions of shooting when there is no signalling
of each shot is not always appreciated, and it is essential
that the importance of the first application of fire should
be realized. Troops, therefore, which are unable to fire
field practices should fire some at least of the instructional
practices without signalling. Such practices are called

166

âobservation practices.â The targets should be placed on
the face of the stop-butt or at the foot of the gallery-bank,
and may with advantage be falling or collapsible targets.

15. Precautions.
—To guard against accidents, the following
orders will be observed:

(i) No firing will take place until a large red danger-flag
is hoisted on the signal-staff at or near the butts,
and the necessary look-out men posted.

(ii) A smaller red danger-flag will be hoisted at the butts
as a warning to cease fire. This flag will remain
exposed during the entire period of cessation of
fire, and will not be withdrawn until the whole
of the butt party is under cover. No one will
leave the butts until cessation of fire has been
notified from the firing-point.

(iii) A red flag will be kept raised at the firing-point when
no firing is taking place, and will be lowered only
on the order of the senior officer. This order will
not be given until the flag at the butts has been
withdrawn.

(iv) Aiming or snapping during target practice may only
take place from the firing-point after the red flag
has been lowered.

Section
59
.—Surplus Ammunition and Computation
of Averages.

1.
Surplus Ammunition.
—The rounds shown as âsurplusâ
in Tables A and B will be distributed primarily
by commanding officers for the following purposes:

(i) Repetition firing, as prescribed in the tables.

(ii) Fifteen rounds per man to be expended by company
commanders for further training of indifferent
shots.

167

(iii) The further training of recruits.

(iv) Fire-direction practices.

(v) The testing of rifles when necessary.

(vii) Occasional shots on the rifle-range (Sec. 58, para. 8).

(vii) Ten rounds per man who commences the course for
voluntary practice.

(viii) Any surplus available after the above requirements
have been fulfilled will be distributed to companies
for general practice. It is not to be used for practice
for competitions.

2. Computation of Averages.
—The best shot of each
squadron or company will be determined by his aggregate
score in Part III. Averages made by companies
in each of the classification practices will be calculated
to one place of decimals, and published in regimental
orders. Only the scores of those officers, non-commissioned
officers, and men who completed a practice will be
included in the numbers by which the total points made in
that practice are divided. Points made by casuals (see
footnote to Sec. 63) will be included at the end of the year,
and fresh averages struck. The sum of the averages of the
practices of Part III. will be termed the âcompany
averageâ in classification practices.

Section
60
.—Conditions of Qualification

1.
The conditions for qualification in Part I., Table B,
are:

A score of not less than 15 in each of Practices 1 and 4,
and a total of not less than 45 in Practices 2, 3, 5,
and 6.

2.
Those who fail to reach any of these standards will,
after firing Practices 7 to 14, repeat those practices of

168

Part I. in which they failed, until the standard is attained
or a third failure is recorded. They will omit Practices 15,
16, and 17. Those who fail to reach all the standards after
two repetitions of those practices in which they failed will
be classified as Third-Class shots, and will not fire Part III.,
but will fire Part VI. if ammunition is available. Special
reports will be submitted in the case of men who are found
to be incapable of reaching the second class standard in
Table B.

Section
61
.—Classification Practices and Conditions
of Classification.

1.
The classification practices should be fired during the
most favourable time of year for individual firing. As a
manâs pay is affected by these practices, every facility
should be given for firing to be carried out under favourable
conditions.

2.
With the exception of those who are exempted from
musketry by the regulations, every man on the strength
of his unit on the last of the four days allotted to classification
firing will be classified at or before the end of the year.

3.
Trained men, not exempted by the regulations, who
for any reason do not commence Table B will be classified
as Third-Class shots. Those who commence Table B,
Part III., but do not complete it, will be classified according
to the number of points obtained in those practices which
they complete.

4.
A note will be made in the Company and Battalion
annual returns of the number of men (if any) who are
classified without having completed the range practices of
Table B.

5. Cavalry and Infantry.
—(i) Cavalry and infantry
soldiers, if qualified in Part I., will be classified upon their
total scores in Part III. as follows:

169

Those who obtain 130 points and upwards

Marksmen.

Those who obtain 105 points and less than 130

First-Class shots.

Those who obtain 50 points in Practices
18 to 22 inclusive, or in the
alternative obtain 70 in Part III.

Second-Class shots.

Those who for any reason fail to attain
the Second-Class standard

Third-Class shots.

(ii) Commanding officers will take every opportunity of
stimulating all ranks to take an interest in shooting and
judging distance by granting indulgences to the most
proficient, and by giving prominence to the best shooting
company in any manner considered desirable.

(iii) Third-Class shots will not be employed in any
capacity which will interfere with their attendance at all
parades and instructional duties.

6. Royal Engineers.
—The sappers and pioneers of the
Royal Engineers (Regular Forces) will fire the following
practices:

(i)
Table A.
—
Recruitsâ Course Regular Forces (Cavalry,
R.E., Infantry), and Special Reserve (R.E., and Infantry),
Parts I., II., III., and IV.
They will not repeat Part I.,
nor any practices of Part II., unless they fail to make a
total score of 90 points in these practices. Those who
fail to obtain 90 points will, after firing Part III., repeat
Practices 5 to 12, instead of firing Part IV. Surplus
ammunition will be used for the further training of indifferent
shots, for testing rifles, or for occasional shots.

(ii)
Table B.
—
Annual Course, Regular Forces (Cavalry,
R.E., and Infantry). Parts I., II. (Practices 7, 9, 12,
and 14), and III.
The qualification standard will be the
same as for the cavalry and infantry. Those who fail to
qualify in Part I. at the first attempt will proceed with the

170

prescribed practices of Part II. (twenty rounds), and then
repeat those practices of Part I. in which they failed.
Those who fail twice in any of the standards in Part I. may,
provided sufficient ammunition is available out of the
authorized annual allowance, repeat those practices in
which they failed once more, with a view to qualification.
Those who repeat any practices of Part I. will, if they
qualify on first or second repetition, fire the whole of
Part III., or, failing that, Practices 19, 20, 23, 24, and 25,
according to the amount of ammunition available.

(iii) Any man who qualifies in Part I. on the first, second,
or third attempt, and completes the practices of Part III.,
will be classified according to the standards of Part III.,
but not below Second-Class shot. Those who complete
Practices 19, 20, 23, 24, and 25 only will be classified as
Second-Class shots, provided they have qualified in Part I.;
those who fail in Part I., or who, having qualified in Part I.
for any reason do not complete these five practices, will
be classified as Third-Class shots. Any ammunition unexpended
will form a surplus for further instruction.

7. R.A.M.C. and A.V.C.
—Recruits of the R.A.M.C. and
A.V.C. will fire Practices 1 to 4, Table B (Royal Artillery,
etc.). The following standard will be required:

Practice 1.
—All shots in a 12-inch ring. Those who fail
to attain this standard will repeat Practice 1 until they do
so, or expend the full allowance of ammunition. Ammunition
not required for the above practices is to be expended
on preliminary training on the 30-yards range, as considered
necessary.

171

Section
62
.—Recruitsâ Course, Regular Forces,
Cavalry, R.E., and Infantry.

1. Part I.
—Part I. should be fired intermittently during
the latter part of preliminary training, and may be repeated
as often as is considered necessary. The conditions may be
varied, with the object of removing any particular defects
observed in previous shooting.

2. Part II.
—On the completion of Part II., recruits will
repeat once those practices of Part II. in which they failed
to reach the Grouping Standard, or, if they obtain less
than 90 points in Part II., they will repeat, once, the whole
of Part II. before proceeding to Parts III. to VI.

3. Elementary Field Practices.
—Recruits who have completed
their course of instruction in range practices will
fire elementary field practices before joining their companies
in the trained soldiersâ course in order that they
may realize the true function of elementary shooting as a
means to an end and a preparation for field firing—not as
an end in itself.

Section
63
.—Execution of Tables A and B in the
Same Year.

1.
Soldiers of the cavalry, Royal Engineers, and infantry
of the Regular Forces who complete Table A will be
exercised in the whole of Table B (sappers of the Royal
Engineers the prescribed practices only), with their own
companies, if possible, in the same year; but their scores
in Part III. will not be included in the company or battalion
averages. In special cases, which should be exceptional,
commanding officers may direct that backward men shall
repeat Part II., Table A, instead of firing any portion of
Table B in the same year.

172

2.
If Part II., Table B, has been commenced before they
are available, they will begin firing at any practice which
their companies are executing at the time they become
qualified, and will then complete the remainder of the
table. If all the companies in the battalion have completed
Part II., Table B, before they are available, the
brigade commander will decide as to whether they shall
be exercised as casuals.
28
They will be awarded marksmenâs
badges if they attain the necessary standard in Table B.
In any case, they will receive such further practice in firing
as may be considered by their company commanders to
be necessary.

Section
64
.—Trained Soldiersâ Course.

1. Object of Range Practices.
—Range practices are fired
by trained soldiers in order that they may revise their
knowledge of elementary and timed shooting before entering
upon more advanced practices. Soldiers who have missed
the whole or a portion of the range practices and have
become available to commence the field practices with their
companies may, if they are known to be good shots, be
allowed by their commanding officers to execute the field
practices, and fire the range practices subsequently.

2. Programme of Instructional Practices.
—Considerable
latitude is allowed as regards the programme of instructional
practices. Officers commanding companies may
vary the number of rounds to be fired by individuals, or
they may alter the order of the practices in Part II.

173

Officers commanding battalions may, with the approval
of general officers commanding brigades, vary the instructional
practices in any way calculated to further instruction;
but it is not permitted to design practices, or to vary the
details of practices in Part II. with the object of assimilating
the conditions to those of the classification practices.

3. Uncompleted Practices.
—If a man has fired one or
more rounds in any range practice, and is prevented from
completing it, the points made will not count, and the
whole practice will be recommenced when his training is
resumed.
Every soldier not exempted by Musketry Regulations
or by the Kingâs Regulations will execute the full course
of range and field practices yearly.

4. Correction of Sighting.
—Correction of sighting in individual
firing is rarely possible in war. It is therefore
all-important to estimate the elevation and deflection for
the first shot. When a reasonable standard of skill in
trigger-pressing has been shown in grouping practices, and
the principle of application is understood, further practice
in deliberate fire should aim at successful application of fire
from the first shot, and less importance should be attached
to correction of sighting, according to the signalling, of a
series of shots.

5. Sighting Shots.
—For this reason skilled shots should
fire two or three shots at each of several ranges for sighting
practice rather than long series of shots at one or two
distances. Only a few rounds in all should be devoted in
their case to deliberate shooting; a high standard of snapshooting
should be developed. Officers and sergeants may
fire sighting-shots at ranges beyond 600 yards, but as a
rule such training should be reserved for the fire-direction
practices.

6. Allowance for Wind.
—It is convenient to memorize
the effect of right-angle winds at some one distance, as a
guide in estimating deflection allowance for winds of similar

174

strength at other distances. Five hundred yards is a satisfactory
range for this purpose, and the approximate effect
of right-angle winds blowing ten, twenty, and thirty miles
per hour may be studied with advantage.
The use of elaborate
wind-tables, and dependence on flags, telescopes, or sighting-shots,
is prohibited.

181

Practices 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be repeated once each if the grouping standard is not
attained, but not on the same day. Should the firer have attained the grouping
standard in any of the first four practices without repetition, he may on conclusion
of all the practices be given the option of repeating No. 6 with a view to increasing
his score for qualification.

In all cases of repetition the second score only will count for classification.

As a rule five days should be devoted to firing the course, of which the second and
fourth would be reserved for repetition and careful instruction of indifferent shots.

Surplus rounds will be used as the officer commanding the battery or company
may direct on preliminary or further training, testing rifles, occasional shots, or
marksmenâs firing in Part III., Table B, for cavalry and infantry.

Points required for 2nd Class=65. Grouping standards have no effect on classification;
they govern repetition only.

Section
65
.—General Rules for Field Practices.

1. Special Instructions.
—(i) (
a
) Not more than twenty
rounds should be fired in field practices in one day.

(
b
) The dress for individual field practices will be drill
order, and for collective field practices marching order.

(
c
) The firing positions will be any that are suited to the
ground or conditions of the scheme.

(
d
) Some practice should be given in snapshooting in the
standing position during rapid advances at short range.

(ii)
Practices on Classification Ranges.
—If it is absolutely
necessary to use classification ranges (see Sec. 66), the
practices should be performed on a flank, if the extent of
the danger area will permit. In this case, or if the actual
range is used, the ground should be broken by means of
screens, earth parapets, brushwood, or any other suitable
contrivance, with a view to introducing some realism and
uncertainty as to distances.

(iii)
Allotment of Ammunition.
—The allotments of ammunition
to individual and collective field practices respectively
may be varied as general officers commanding may decide,
but the total amount allotted to field practices is to be
fired in field practices, even if a classification range only is
available. Due safety precautions must be taken (see

Musketry Regulations
, Part II.).

(iv)
Registers and Records.
—Company commanders will
keep registers of all collective practices fired. Ricochets
will not be included in the figures recording results of

183

standard or comparative firing. They will be shown
separately from other hits in the registers.

2. Individual Field Practices.
—(i) The distances should
not exceed 600 yards. Training should be progressive in
regard to targets, distances, and all other respects.
It is
essential to give firers full information as to the object of the
practice, and to criticize freely the good and bad points of their
shooting
[Sec. 54, para. 2 (iv)].

(ii) The firers should be formed into small squads, but
there should be no fire control, nor any orders except such
as may be necessary to regulate fire and movement in the
interest of safety and to insure that the objects of the
training are fully carried out.

(iii) Practice will be afforded in acting promptly against
targets appearing suddenly and disappearing after a short
period of exposure. The value of every shot will be ascertained
by markers, and notified to the firer. The men will
as a rule fire alternately, working in pairs for mutual
assistance. When a successful shot is observed, the correct
sighting as found will be immediately notified by the
firer to the remainder of the squad.

(iv) Any preliminary information as to the ground and
results of range-finding at long range which might be available
on service should be given in the later practices in
order to combine all methods of ranging.

3. Collective Field Practices.
—(
a
) Collective field practices,
if ground is available, should be fired almost entirely at
longer ranges. When ground is not available for firing at
ranges beyond 600 yards, practice in collective firing is
necessarily conducted at shorter ranges, but such practice
must be supplemented by fire-direction practices without
ammunition at longer ranges.

(
b
)
Arranging Targets.
—The practice of requiring units
to arrange targets or positions for others to fire at, or during
a skirmish to place head-and-shoulder targets on the

184

ground to represent themselves in position at any temporary
halt, has been found to stimulate interest.

Casualty Competitions.
—Falling or collapsible targets are
of great value in all field practices, and may be used
with advantage in casualty competitions designed to test
the relative abilities of two firing lines, which simultaneously
fire at separate sets of targets representing their
opponents. Each man is represented by a target placed
in front of the opposing firing-line, and becomes a casualty
if that target falls. In this way superiority of fire is soon
established by one line or the other, and fire ceases.

Section
66
.—Field Practices on Classification
Ranges.

1. General Rules.
—The following are examples of individual
and collective field practices for use on classification
ranges, as used at the School of Musketry, Hythe.
They are intended as a guide to officers who have to frame
practices for their units. These practices and similar ones
may be fired on classification ranges on which rapid practices
are allowed if the following points are observed:

(i)
Damage to Gallery.
—It is most important, for the
safety of the range, that any damage done to
the gallery-bank should be made good each day,
as soon as the practices are completed.

(ii)
Oblique Fire.
—In practices involving oblique fire, such
as those in which the crossing figure No. 6 is
used, the run of the figure or figures should be
confined to a lateral space of 25 yards. The
firers should occupy a corresponding space at
the firing-point. These oblique practices must
not be fired at ranges less than 400 yards.

(iii)
Falling Plates.
—Earthenware tiles should be used, as
steel plates give back-splashes which may endanger

185

the markers.
Tiles
should be placed
about 4 feet below the top of the stop-butt. If
there is no stop-butt, they may be placed at the
foot of the gallery-slope.

2. Targets.
—Targets will be supplied by R.E. (
vide

Musketry Regulations
, Part II., 1910, para. 141).

(i)
Wood.
—Veneer figures can be supplied, or they can
be cut out of match-boarding. Dimensions will
be found in
Musketry Regulations
, Part II., 1910,
Plate 37
et seq.
For use in a gallery, the figures
must be mounted on poles.

(ii)
Tiles.
—Earthenware tiles can be obtained. Ordinary
roofing tiles are cheaper, and answer the purpose.
A useful and cheap substitute is 3 bricks placed
on end on a flat piece of wood, and tied together
with a piece of string or wire.

3. Markers.
—The success of a practice depends largely
on the markers. They should be rehearsed carefully, but
not in view of the firers.

Individual Field Practices.

No. 1.

Object
: To teach the necessity for quick opening of fire with
effect from the first shot.

Rounds
: 5 per man.

Targets
: 2 iron falling-plates for each pair of firers.

Distance
: Unknown—about 250 yards.

Method
: 2 squads, each of four firers, are extended in pairs,
rifles unloaded and at safe, sights normal, till the command
âFire.â Squads fire against each other.

Targets represent the firers of the opposing squad.

When a target is knocked down, the man of the opposing team
in a corresponding position ceases fire, unloads, and takes no
further part in the practice; his ammunition is available for the
other man of his pair.

186

Points are allotted as follows:

For each hit, 5 points; total, 10 points.

If both targets hit within 40 seconds, 5 points; total, 15 points.

No. 2.

Object
: To bring out the dependence of movement on fire.

Rounds
: 10 per man.

Targets
: A Figure 3 target for each firer, to be exposed 3
times for 35 seconds at 35 secondsâ interval. Targets to be
twirled and lowered when hit, and not to reappear till the next
exposure.

Distance
: Known—600 to 400 yards.

Method
: (6) Firers, with rifles loaded and extended behind
cover on the 600 yardsâ firing-point; they open fire on the targets
appearing. On the completion of each of the first two exposures
the order âAdvanceâ is given, when the firers double forward
100 yards.

Scoring
: 3 points for each hit. 1 point for each unfired
round handed in, if target has been hit at each range.

No. 3.

Object
: To test menâs intelligence and marksmanship.

Rounds
: 10 per man.

Targets
: 3 Figure 6 targets concealed behind a short length of
wall (built of sandbags on the markerâs gallery), or represented
by a specially prepared screen, which is understood to be bullet-proof.
One of the targets (representing a man observing) looks
round one end of the wall for 10 seconds, and if not fired at moves
in quick time along the gallery, followed by the other two targets
at 3 paces interval.

On the first shot being fired, all targets move at the double
towards the nearest cover (either the wall or the end of the
gallery). Any targets which are still under cover when fire is
opened do not appear.

Targets to be twirled and lowered when hit.

Distance
: Known—400 yards.

Method
: 2 men with rifles loaded are concealed behind cover
on the 400 yardsâ firing-point, and are told the following:

âYou are a patrol; before reaching this point you saw an
enemyâs patrol of 3 men move behind the wall on the markerâs
gallery; you have crept up here unseen by them.

187

âNone of your troops are within a mile of you, and it is
unlikely that the enemyâs patrol is closely supported.

âYour object is to try to shoot all the enemyâs patrol. The
markerâs gallery represents flat ground, with cover at each end
of it.â

No. 4.

Object
: A test of rapidity of fire, combined with accuracy after
movement.

Rounds
: 10 per man.

Targets
: A Figure 3 target and 5 iron falling-plates for each
firer.

The Figure 3 target to be exposed twice for 3 seconds at an
interval of 30 seconds.

Distance
: 200 to 300 yards.

Method
: (6) Firers are formed up about 50 yards in rear of
the selected fire position (rifles unloaded and at safe).

On the command, âAdvance,â they rush to the fire position,
load, and adjust sights. 25 seconds after the order âAdvance,â
the Figure 3 target is exposed, when fire will be opened. The
falling-plates will then be engaged till the second exposure of the
Figure 3 target, after which fire will cease.

Scoring
: 2 points for each hit on the Figure 3. 1 point for
each plate knocked down.

(If desired, this practice can be carried out without movement.)

No. 5.

Object
: To teach the necessity for quickness in obtaining effect.

Rounds
: 5 per man.

Targets
: 1 Figure 6 target, 1 Figure 3 target, and 2 Figure 4
targets for each firer, to appear as follows within a given sector
at about 5 secondsâ interval:

Figure 6 moving to a flank for 5 seconds.

Figure 3 appears for 4 seconds.

Figure 4 appears for 3 seconds.

2 Figures 4 appear for 10 seconds.

Targets when hit will not be replaced.

Distance
: Known—300 yards.

Method
: (6) Firers with rifles loaded are extended behind
cover, and told to watch their front. They open fire on the
appearance of the targets.

) are exposed twice separately and once together in
any order for 30 seconds at irregular intervals.

Targets hit will be twirled and lowered, and will not reappear
till the next exposure.

189

Distance
: Known—500 yards.

Method
: A section (12 firers) is extended on the firing-point;
on the appearance of the targets, the commander gives his fire
orders.

Notes
.—Rapidity in dealing with the situation. Fire orders.
Volume employed. Point of aim.

No. 3.

Object
: To bring out the necessity for (
a
) opening fire in full
volume to produce surprise, (
b
) making fire effective from the
first opening.

Rounds
: 10 per man.

Targets
: 8 Figure 1 targets, representing men in close formation.
On the first shot being fired, these are replaced by 8
Figure 6 targets extending outwards; when these are well
extended, they are replaced by 8 Figure 4 targets, which remain
exposed for 1 minute. Any figure hit will be lowered, and not
replaced by another.

Distance
: Known—500 yards.

Method
: A section (12 firers) is ordered to ambush and shoot
all of a small body of the enemy in order to obtain some written
information which is believed to be in their possession. The
enemy is expected to cross a piece of flat ground represented by
the markerâs gallery.

Notes.
—Use of cover for concealment. Preliminary arrangements.
Simultaneous and quick opening of fire in full volume
at the close formation. Change of rate to slow fire at the
extended line.

No. 4.

Object
: Superiority of fire. A test of rapidity and accuracy
of fire.

Rounds
: 10 per man.

Targets
: 10 Figure 3 targets, reinforced by 3 more after
15 seconds, and then every 10 seconds up to 55 seconds.

Targets hit are lowered.

If at any time all targets have been hit, no more will be put
up; benefit of doubt to be given to the firers.

Should the number of targets at any time exceed 10, the firers
have lost superiority of fire, and fire ceases.

Distance
: 400 yards.

190

Method
: A section (10 firers), with rifles unloaded and at safe,
lie down on the firing-point. Sights may be adjusted.

On the appearance of the targets, the commander gives orders
to load, and fire orders. Fire will cease (
a
) should the number
of targets exceed 10, (
b
) if all targets are down, (
c
) one minute
after the first appearance of the targets.

The time in which all targets are hit, or the number of targets
left standing at the end of a minute, should be noted.

Note.
—This practice may be fired as a competition.

No. 5.

Object
: A practice which brings out rapidity of loading, sight-setting,
movement, and fire, combined with accuracy.

Rounds
: 10 per man.

Targets
: 10 iron falling-plates extended to 3 paces.

Distance
: 600 yards to position.

Method
: A section (10 firers) lie down on the firing-point, rifles
unloaded and at safe, sights normal, till the warning, âCommence,â
when the commander gives his orders.

One round at least must be fired by each man before an
advance of 100 yards is allowed. The whole section must
advance together.

Note.
—Should this practice be fired as a competition, the
section which knocks down all its plates in the shortest time, or
that which knocks down most plates, wins.

It will generally be found that the section which reaches
300 yards quickest will win. Teams to be disqualified if anyone
advances till all safety-catches are on.

No. 6.

Object
: To bring out the great advantage of ranging by observation,
before the target appears, when circumstances permit.

Rounds
: 15 per man.

Targets
: 20 Figure 6 targets. A length of wooden hurdles on
the markerâs gallery represents a bridge.

Distance
: 800 yards.

Method
: A section (10 firers). The commander is given the
following information:

âYou are placed here to cover that bridge, which is the only
way the enemy can cross.

191

âThey are now 500 or 600 yards from it, and mean to get across.

âYou are being supported, and your first duty is to be prepared
to bring a heavy fire on the bridge.

âThere is no need for concealment.â

Note.
—The enemy appears near the bridge 3 minutes after
these instructions are given. Method of ranging. Anticipatory
orders.

No. 7.

Object
: A practice to exemplify fire and movement during an
advance.

Rounds
: 15 per man.

Targets
: A screen 10 by 3 feet at 800 and 700 yards. Both
will be put up together; one will be lowered when hit by 10 shots
at 800 yards, the other will similarly be lowered when hit
10 times at 700 yards.

5 Figure 3 targets extended to 3 paces will be exposed 5 seconds
after the disappearance of the second screen.

Targets to be exposed till hit; they will be lowered when hit.

5 seconds after the last target is hit they will be again exposed
till they have been exposed 5 times.

Distance
: Known—800 to 200 yards.

Method
: 2 sections (20 firers) under the platoon sergeant, lie
down on the 800 yardsâ firing-point, rifles unloaded and at safe,
sights normal. On the warning, âCommence,â the commander
gives his orders, 10 minutes after which fire will cease.

A screen must be lowered before any advance may be made
at 800 and 700 yards.

All five targets must be lowered before an advance may be
made at the other ranges.

Advances will each be 100 yards.

No advance will be made beyond 200 yards.

Note.
—If fired as a competition, the 2 sections who get most
targets down win; if more than one team get all their targets
down, that with the most ammunition in hand wins.

No. 8.

Object
: A practice to show the dependence of movement on fire.

Rounds
: 10 per man.

Targets
: 12 Figure 3 targets, extended to 3 paces; each to be
lowered when hit.

192

5 seconds after the last one has been lowered, the targets will
be again exposed till hit.

Distance
: Known—600, 500, 400 yards.

Method
: A section (10 firers) is extended to 3 paces on the
600 yardsâ firing-point, rifles unloaded and at safe, sights normal.

On the warning, âCommence,â the commander gives his
orders.

No advance will be made from 600 yards till four targets have
been lowered.

No advance will be made from 600 yards till the remaining
eight targets have been lowered.

Note.
—If fired as a competition, the section which hits all its
targets at 400 yards in the shortest time wins, or the section
which hits most targets.

CHAPTER IX

NIGHT FIRING, HAND GRENADES, AND
COMPETITIONS

Section
67
.—Night Firing.
29

1. Methods of Night Firing.
—A body of troops in a position
commanding open ground or an approach which may be
used by the enemy may arrange to sweep it with fire by
laying rifles in rests constructed by daylight, by preparing
illuminated aiming-marks giving a horizontal line of sight,
or by firing at the flashes of the enemyâs rifles, or other
marks by automatic alignment of the rifle. These various
methods are explained in the following paragraphs.
Firing
at night should only be employed within close range.

2. Automatic Alarms and Flare Lights.
—(i) Automatic
alarms and flare lights to illuminate the foreground are
useful against night attacks. They should be used in combination
with obstacles, if any have been constructed, and
either protected or concealed, so as to prevent the enemy
removing them.
No mechanical signal must be relied upon
as a substitute for the efficient use of the eyesight and
hearing.

3. Fixed Rifle-Rests and Aiming-Marks.
—On a dark
night it is difficult to insure the menâs rifles being aimed
in the required direction. Any device to assist them in

194

this matter is useful. Fixed rifle-rests may be made, or,
failing these, some such device as a wooden bar can be
arranged across loopholes, to prevent a man raising his
rifle-barrel too high. Posts painted white on the defendersâ
side make a good aiming-mark, if the night is not too
dark.

4. Automatic Alignment of the Rifle.
—(i) The automatic
alignment of the rifle is as a general rule the most effective
method of firing at night. Men should therefore be practised
in aligning their rifles automatically for night firing
at ranges of about 300 yards and under.

(ii)
Method of Instruction.
—Aiming-marks should be selected
just above the ground-line, and within 100 yards of the
squad. The men should then be ordered to bring their
rifles into the firing position with both eyes shut. The
right eye should then be opened, and the approximate
alignment of the rifle verified. After some practice each
man will be able to ascertain his individual tendency, which
he should correct with practice until able to align the rifle
with his eyes shut with approximate accuracy.

(iii) This exercise should be carried out in the daytime
until proficiency is attained, when men should be practised
in firing a few rounds after dark at large screens at a
range not exceeding 300 yards. The position of the screen
may be indicated by some rough expedient to represent
the flash of a rifle. Much material effect is not to be
anticipated from night firing except against an enemy in
movement, but the moral effect should be considerable.

5. Instruction on Miniature Ranges.
—Directions for night
firing on miniature ranges are contained in Sec. 74, para. 7.

Section
68
.—Hand Grenade (Mark I).

1. General Description
(see
Fig. 52
).—The grenade consists
of the following principal parts: Cap A, body B,

195

detonator C, cane handle D, wood block E, tail F, charge G,
and cast-iron ring R.

2.
The body B of the grenade carries the lyddite charge
G. The wood block E is put into the recess in the cup H,
and the cup, wood block, and body are then firmly secured
together by means of the three brass screws J. Attached
to the wood block E is the cane handle D, to the end of
which is securely bound the tail F, the cane handle D
being for the purpose of throwing the grenade, and the
tail F to steady it in flight and to assist to make it travel
and fall point foremost.

3.
The upper part of the body has a groove M formed
in it for the purpose of securing the cap A in position. The
groove M is provided with four leads into it, two N.N., to
allow of the insertion and removal of the cap, and two O.O.,
to allow the cap to move forward upon the grenade striking
the ground or other obstacle. Two projections, e.e., are
made in the groove M for the indent X in the cap A to
jump when the cap enters or leaves the travel position.
One projection is to be made long enough to carry the
indent into the
Fire
position. The object of these two
projections is to give a definite indication of when the cap
is in the
Travel
and
Fire
positions. Two indicating knobs
P.P. are secured to the body, and two stop pins Q.Q. are
fixed below the indicating knobs P.P., preventing the cap
A being pushed down too far (except when turned into the

Fire
position—see later) if by any accident the safety-pin
had been removed or displaced. Fixed to the top of the
body are two holding studs R.R. to secure the detonator C
when in position. The body has also painted on it in red
two arrows L.L. for the purpose of indicating positions of
cap A as to the removing, travel, or firing positions.

4.
The detonator C is formed with a flange S on which
are two lugs T.T. for the purpose of turning the detonator
when in position, so as to secure it under the heads of the

196

197

198

holding studs R.R. On the face of the flange S is fixed a
brass plate spring U, for locking the detonator into position.
The two grooves V.V. in the flange S of the detonator C
are to allow the flange S to pass the holding studs R.R.
during insertion or removal of the detonator.

Fig. 52
.—
Hand Grenade (Mark I).
Scale â


5.
The cap A carries a steel needle W for firing the
detonator. Two small indents X.X. are formed on the
cap to engage with the groove M on the body B. The
raised lips I.I, are to allow the cap A to clear the indicating
knobs P.P. when the cap is being placed or removed from
the body of the grenade.

6.
Two raised lips K.K. are to allow the cap A to move
forward when the cap is turned into its firing position, the
lips K.K. being raised sufficiently to clear the stop pins
Q.Q., this only being possible when the cap is in the firing
position. The raised portions Y.Y. are for the indicating
knobs to engage with when the cap is turned to the travel
position, and thus give a further indication when the cap A
is in this position. The cap is also fitted with a safety-pin
Z, which passes through the needle and the cap, and
prevents the cap moving forward while the pin is in position.
The pin Z is secured by a whipcord becket passed
over the cap A, and is also further secured by a thin leather
strip d passing through a slot at one end, it being necessary
to remove both these safeguards before the pin Z can be
withdrawn. The safety-pin Z is also passed through the
cap A in such a position that if by any mischance the
detonator C was not properly secured after being placed in
position, the act of placing the cap A on and turning it to
the left into the firing position causes the pin Z to engage
with the two lugs T.T. on the flange S of the detonator,
and automatically locks the detonator under the heads of
the holding studs R.R.

7.
The hook
t
fixed to the body of the grenade is for
attaching the latter to the soldierâs belt. The grenade

199

with the stick downward is hung on to the belt by the
hook.

8. To Prepare the Grenade for Use.
—(i) Turn the cap A on
to the body B to the right until the indicating knobs P.P.
are in the raised lips I.I. formed in the cap A. This can
be seen by means of the arrows L.L. painted on the body
B being opposite the words âremoveâ on the cap A.
Then pull off the cap.

(ii) Place the detonator C in the recess for it. See that
the two grooves V.V. in the flange S coincide with the two
studs R.R., then press down the detonator into position.
When the flange S is home, turn the detonator C to the left,
passing the flange under the heads of the studs R.R., and
continue turning until the brass plate spring U is released,
thus locking the detonator.

(iii) Replace the cap A with the raised lips I.I. over the
indicating knobs P.P., and push down into position. After
the cap A has been put on, it must be turned one-eighth
of a turn to the left, thus bringing the indicating knobs P.P.
into the raised positions Y.Y. of the cap A. This is done
by pointing the indicating arrows L.L. to âtravelâ on the
cap.

(iv) The grenade is intended to be carried with the raised
portions Y.Y. always over the indicating arrows L.L.—
i.e.
,
in the travel position, whether the detonator C is in position
or not.

(v)
To Throw the Grenade.
—The tail is unwound, and
allowed to hang loose at full length.

(vi) The cap is turned from the âtravelâ to the âfireâ
position.

(vii) The safety-pin is withdrawn.

(viii) The grenade is thrown by means of the cane D. The
latter is grasped between the end furthest from the grenade
itself and the attached point of the tail—
i.e.
, on the grooved
portion. The grenade is thrown in the required direction

200

either under or over hand, care being taken that the tail
cannot entangle itself with the thrower or with any object
near him.

(ix) When throwing, the following points should be remembered:

(
a
) The grenade should be thrown well upwards at not
less than an angle of about 35 degrees. This,
besides assisting in increasing the range to which
the grenade can be thrown, renders its action
more absolutely certain by causing it to strike
the ground nearly vertically. This is especially
important when throwing with a following wind.

(
b
) Any obstacle lying between the thrower and the
objective must be cleared, as the grenade will
almost certainly act on anything it strikes during
any part of its flight.

(x)
Caution.
—(i) Should the hand grenade not be used, the
cap is to be turned back to âtravelâ from âfire,â the safety-pin
(which must be retained) is to be replaced in position,
care being taken that the pin passes through the cap, and is
secured by passing the whipcord becket over the cap, and
by replacing the leather strip
d
through the slot in the end
of the safety-pin Z, and the tail rolled up and secured.

(ii) Immediately the grenade has left the hand, the thrower
should lie down or get behind cover to reduce the chances
of being hit by a splinter, as, of course, the explosion sends
these in all directions. Dummy grenades are supplied for
practice in throwing.

9. Use of Grenades.
—In addition to the hand grenade,
grenades may be improvised by filling tins with explosive
for throwing by hand. Grenades are also constructed so
that they can be fired from rifles. Grenades can be used
with effect against sap-heads in siege warfare and in trench
fighting at close range.

201

Section
69
.—Competitions.

1. Object of Competitions.
—The principles governing
competitions are laid down in para. 102,
Musketry Regulations
.
The object of competitions is to encourage proficiency
in service shooting under practical conditions.
This object must not be confined to a few champion shots,
but must include every man in each fire-unit.
A good
average standard of marksmanship, especially in shooting at
service targets at unknown ranges, is the ideal to be aimed at.

Team competitions in which fire-unit commanders are exercised
in their duties, and in which they work together with
their units, are the most practical and valuable form of
competition. The various instructional practices, together
with individual and collective field practices in Chapters
VIII and X of this book, are suitable for competitions.

2. General Rules.
—(i) The conditions of each competition
must be suited to the rank and skill of competitors, and practise
them in the duties they will perform in the firing-line.

(ii)
Programmes.
—Programmes should as far as possible embrace
all elements of musketry training. Rules for the conduct
of competitions should be the same as those for the conduct of
range and field practices.

(iii)
Individual Firing.
—Individual firing competitions beyond
600 yards have little military value.

(iv)
Targets.
—Bullâs-eye targets should as a rule be used in
elementary competitions only for young soldiers in the first year
of service. Service targets should be used of neutral colours,
and of visibility approximating to that of the targets seen on
service.

(v)
Scope of Competitions.
—Specializing in any one kind of
shooting should be discouraged. Competitions for trained
soldiers should include not less than three different forms of
shooting, such as snapshooting, rapid firing, observation, appreciation
of fire limits, etc., with as much variation of targets and
conditions as can be conveniently arranged, according to the
facilities available.

202

(vi)
Rate of Firing.
—Conditions for soldiers with more than one
year of service should never permit of a slower rate than three
rounds a minute for a series of shots, exclusive of time taken for
signalling. In deliberate shooting, the best military shot is
probably the man who, in skirmishing, first applies an effective
shot to a target at unknown range. In rapid firing, the sighting
to be used would very often be communicated to the soldier on
service, and a high rate of fire, combined with reasonable
accuracy, would be expected from him.

(vii)
Coaching.
—Coaching should never be allowed, but individual
soldiers in observation and skirmishing competitions may
be allowed to work in pairs, giving mutual assistance.

(viii)
Rifles and Aids to Shooting.
—It is essential that in competitions
open to the rank and file, competitors should be allowed
to fire only with a rifle in charge of their unit, and no departure
from the regulations governing the painting of sights, use of
slings, provision of wind flags, targets, rifle accessories, etc., is
to be permitted in service-rifle competitions.

CHAPTER X

INSTRUCTION ON MINIATURE RANGES, INCLUDING
RANGE AND FIELD PRACTICES

Section
70
.—General Remarks.

1. Instruction on Miniature Ranges.
—(i) Instruction on
miniature ranges is in no sense a final training, but it is a
useful and economical preparation for service shooting—especially
useful where range accommodation is distant or
altogether lacking. It should be commenced during the
recruitâs training, when frequent visits should be made to the
miniature range, and the lessons of aiming, pressing the
trigger, declaring the point of aim on discharge, etc., should
be illustrated practically by firing at elementary targets.

(ii)
Object of Instruction.
—Instruction should be carried out
on the same principles as on open ranges. It should be
progressive, and may with advantage precede instruction
on open ranges. Instruction and firing may be carried
out throughout the year; but if this work on miniature
ranges is done during the winter months it will prove a
useful preparation for subsequent practice on open ranges
and for field training in the spring and summer months (see

Drill and Field Training
of this series, Sec. 29, para. 1).

2. Scope of Training.
—The instruction, which may be
carried out with the Solano Target and Landscape targets
is more or less identical in scope with that which can be
carried out on open ranges. It must be remembered, however,
that the effects of varying light, wind, and other
atmospheric influences are absent on miniature ranges,
that instruction in judging distance is not possible [see

204

Sec. 72, para. 2 (iii)], that firing with sights adjusted for
different ranges can only be carried out to a limited extent,
and that the general conditions under which training takes
place are artificial and easier as compared with training on
open ranges.

3. Rifles.
—The rifles used should be service pattern,
·22-inch R.F., or aiming or Morris tubes used in service
rifles with regulation sights. Service rifles must be used,
so that the firer may become accustomed to the weight,
length, bolt action, and sighting of the weapon he will use
in war. Unless this principle is adhered to, practice on
miniature ranges cannot be regarded as satisfactory preparation
for service shooting.
Rifles must be âharmonizedâ
both for firing at targets direct or with elevation in landscape
practices according to the directions laid down in
Appendix, V. Rifles must also be cleaned after every ten to
fifteen rounds, otherwise they become inaccurate.

4. Windgauge.
—The windgauge may be used to represent
wind, and the firers taught to aim off so as to correct
the deflection given, acting sometimes on their own judgment,
sometimes according to orders for fire direction.

5. Cover.
—Cover of various kinds can be improvised at
the firing-point with sandbags, screens, or other available
material.

6. Empty Cases.
—Empty cartridge-cases and lead should
be collected, and may be sold at market rates.

7. Precautions.
—(i) As the ·22 cartridge used on miniature
ranges has considerable power, every precaution must
be taken to insure safety.
Rifles must be laid down at the
firing-point unloaded and with the breech-action open, and
firers must stand clear whenever it is necessary for anyone
to be in front of the firing-point.

(ii) A non-commissioned officer will be placed in charge
of each range, and will attend whenever any practice takes

205

place. Firing will take place only during the hours fixed
by the commanding officer.

(iii) No person, except the officer or non-commissioned
officer in charge, or the marker, is to pass from the firing-point
up to the target during practice. Should it be necessary
to stop firing, the same precautions are to be taken as
at rifle practice.

(iv) Every possible precaution must be taken to avoid
accidents, the strictest order and discipline being maintained
at the firing-point. When practice takes place
on a classification range, the same orders for safety,
etc., are to be observed as when service ammunition is
used.

(v) In practices combining firing and movement, the
non-commissioned officer in charge of the range will examine
the rifles to see that they are not loaded before
movement is commenced.

Section
71
.—Targets.

1. Standard Equipment.
—(i) The various targets of the
standard equipment to be used for miniature range instruction
are described in Appendix, VII, the information in
which must be carefully noted. It is important to avoid confusing
the Solano Target when used with scenery, etc., as
shown in Figs. 55 and 56, with various Landscape targets
when fixed to the Solano Target for instruction as in

Fig. 57
. The points of difference between the Solano and
Landscape targets mentioned in the following paragraphs
must also be noted.

(ii) The scenery, scenic accessories, and Solano figures of
the Solano Target are all correctly drawn to scale for
25 yards, and at that distance give correct impressions of

206

what they represent. Landscape targets are not all drawn
to scale for 25 yards,
but they must always be used at this
distance when possible
.

(iii) On the Solano Target the various features of the
scenery, including background and details, as well as the
position of troops, can be altered quickly to any extent.
The features of landscape targets cannot be altered, therefore
they should be changed frequently, as they lose their
value when their features become well known.

(iv) In firing at the Solano Target when fitted with
scenery, the bullets
strike the objective aimed at
. In firing
at landscape targets rifles must be given elevation so that
bullets
strike a screen above the landscape
, not the objective
aimed at (
Fig. 58
).

(v) The Solano Target, with or without scenic effects
and figures, can be used for the whole scope of the instruction
in this chapter, and for all range and field practices.
The scope of instruction which can be carried out on landscape
targets is strictly limited, and does not include
important branches of elementary training nor range and
individual field practices. Firing at landscape targets
has the advantage of practising men in the adjustment of
sights. On the other hand, landscape target practice
lacks elements of realism and surprise, as it does not include
arrangements for representing the movement of troops at
different distances, and does not afford practice in watching
the front for the appearance of targets representing troops,
discerning and opening fire quickly at such targets, and in
marking down, snapshooting, and rapid firing at moving
and disappearing targets, especially within close range,
which has proved of such vital importance in modern
battles (see Preface, paras. 4 and 5).

2. Elementary Targets.
—(i) The elementary bullâs-eye
and other targets for use in miniature range instructional
practices should be similar to those used on the classification

207

range, but are supplied reduced to the correct
scale.

Field Practices, with Scenery and Scenic Accessories (Type C), and with Solano
Figures representing Troops at Different Ranges.

3. Regulation Figure Targets
include those in the list in
Appendix, VII, para. 5. Targets representing troops
advancing in close formations, such as those shown in the
Preface, p. ix, may be improvised by cutting strips of card
to the required length. The height of the card for various
distances, scaled for 25 yards, is as follows: 400 yards,
4 inches; 600 yards, 3¾ inches; 800 yards, 2 inches; 1,000
yards, 1 inch. To these measurements ½ inch should be
added in every case for the base held by the clips of the
target. Brown or grey card should be used.

(iii)
It must be noted that if figures are made with card
which is not sufficiently thick, the impact of the bullet will
not cause them to fall when fixed in the falling clips of Tier B
of the Target
(Appendix, VII, para. 2).

4. Solano Elementary and Instructional Targets.
—These
targets have been officially approved by the Army Council
for miniature range practices (see Appendix, VIII).

5. Nomenclature of Targets.
—In the subsequent Sections
of this chapter the Solano Target will be referred to as

The Target
, Figure Targets as
Figures
, and Landscape Targets
as
Landscapes
.

Section
72
.—Preliminary Training

1. Instruction to Precede Firing.
—(i) As already stated,
range and field practices carried out before men have been
thoroughly instructed in preliminary training will merely
result in waste of ammunition. Therefore, before firing on
miniature ranges commences men should be thoroughly
trained in the following duties: (
a
) Quick and accurate
adjustment of sights; (
b
) laying an absolutely correct aim
from aiming-rest at easy aiming-mark; (
c
) correct trigger
pressing; (
d
) assuming correct loading and firing positions,

208

including adjustment of sights, aiming, and release of
trigger without disturbing aim.

(ii) Particular subjects of instruction which relate to
different firing practices should precede them as follows:
30

(
a
)
Before firing from cover
: Adapting the firing position
to different kinds of cover.

(
b
)
Before application practices
: Aiming-off; the extent
being reckoned by the breadth of the aiming-mark as
ordered, and aim being laid from aiming-rest.

(
c
)
Before firing at moving targets
: Aiming-off for movement
at crossing figures on the Solano Target; aim being
tested with aim-corrector.

(
d
)
Before snapshooting practices
: Combining rapidity
with accuracy of aim; aim being tested with aiming-disc.

(
e
)
Before firing at the Target with scenery and figures
or at landscapes
: Marking down an enemy, and aiming at
ground and service targets; aim being laid from aiming-rest
at points or targets indicated.

2. Instruction in Aiming.
—(i) This training can be
carried out on the Target without scenery (
Fig. 53
), as
described in Chapter III.
Elementary training
should be
carried out as described in Sec. 70, para. 1.
Aiming at
service targets and ground
can be taught on the Target
with scenery and figures and on landscapes as described
in Sec. 19, para. 2 (ii).
Marking down an enemy
can be
taught on the Target with scenery and figures as described
in Sec. 19, para. 3 (ii), a number of figures representing
men at different distances being exposed from behind
cover or in the open to represent the movements of the
fatigue-men.

(ii)
Aiming-off for wind
can be taught on the Target
with scenery and figures as described in Sec. 20, para. 4,
figures representing men at different distances instead of
fatigue-men.
Aiming up and down
may also be taught

209

as above according to the instruction laid down in Sec. 21,
para. 3, figures representing men at various distances
being exposed on Tiers A and B to represent an advance
or retirement in the place of fatigue-men.
Aiming-off for
movement
can be taught with the crossing figures on the
Target as described in Sec. 22, para. 1.

(iii)
Rapid adjustment of sights
can be taught on the
Target with scenery and figures by exposing a number of
figures representing men at different distances. The distance
of each figure will not be given. Men will adjust
their sights for the distance at which they estimate it to
be. The correct range of the figure will then be given,
and the men will declare their estimate. As the figures
are correctly scaled to size for 25 yards range, this practice
will help to accustom the eye to the appearance of men at
different distances, and so help to some extent to train them
in judging distance, though it cannot be considered wholly
satisfactory for this purpose for the reasons given in Sec. 70,
para. 2.

3. Instruction in Firing
—(i)
Elementary Training.
—This
training can be carried out on the Target without scenery,
according to the directions laid down in Sec. 24 and the rest
of Chapter IV.

(ii)
Vulnerability of Different Firing Positions
(Sec. 26, para. 1).—This
can be illustrated on the Target with the aid of
figures representing men in the standing, kneeling, and
lying positions at various distances. Figures in the standing
and lying positions respectively are shown at various
ranges in Figs. 55 and 56, arranged on Tier B of the
Target.

(iii)
Need for Avoiding Unnecessary Movements in Loading and Firing

(Sec. 30, para. 1).—This important rule can be illustrated
on the Target with scenery and a number of figures representing
men in various firing positions at different distances,
disposed either singly or in groups in the open or

210

partly
behind cover such as bushes, rocks, walls, etc. The
figures should be placed in front of background which harmonizes
with their colour, so that they are invisible to the
naked eye when motionless. The mechanism should then
be operated so as to move the figures slightly to demonstrate
to the class (
a
) that a figure which is invisible to the naked
eye while motionless catches the eye through movement,
and (
b
) that while quick movements may escape the eye,
and even if seen may make marking down difficult, movements
prolonged even for a short time catch the eye and
facilitate marking down. This object-lesson will emphasize
the rule that movements in the open should be
confined to those which are absolutely necessary, and that
these should be made smartly.

(iv)
Firing from Cover.
—This instruction can be practised on
miniature ranges, according to the rules laid down in
Sec. 31, para. 4, with cover improvised by the use of sandbags,
etc. Care must be taken to see that the firing positions
are correctly adapted to different forms of cover. The
need for keeping the eye fixed on the target when firing
from cover can be illustrated on the Target by the use of
scenery and disappearing and crossing figures representing
men at different distances. The correct and incorrect
method of using various kinds of cover can also be illustrated
on the Target, together with faults such as firing over
instead of round the side of cover when this is possible,
undue exposure, and unnecessary movement. The Target
can also be used with scenery and figures for lectures on
the choice of cover and the advantages and disadvantages
of different kinds of cover according to the instruction
laid down in Sec. 31, para. 3 (ii) to (iv) inclusive, and
para. 5.

4. Visual Training
—(i)
Discernment of Targets.
—Training
can be carried out on the Target as described in Sec. 34 with
different types of scenery and figures representing both

211

men and bodies of troops in different formations at various
ranges. The methods of instruction described in paras. 3
to 8 of this section, inclusive, can be carried out on the same
principle as in training on the ground.

(ii)
Effect of Background on Visibility.
—Figs. 55 and 56 illustrate
object-lessons in the effect of background on the
visibility of service targets. For instance, lying figures
in front of the hedge to the left of the tree on the left of
the white house in the foreground of
Fig. 55
are hardly
visible at close range in the open, while a khaki figure near
the right edge of the dark wood to the right of the hills in

Fig. 56
is distinct, though it represents a man 1,400 yards
away, while the rest of a line of similar figures coloured
grey extended to his right in front of the wood are invisible.
It must be remembered that in photographic reproduction
the visibility of the figures is exaggerated as compared with
their visibility against the scenery when observed with
the naked eye at 25 yards.

(iii) Figures which are invisible to the naked eye against
the scenic background of the Target can be made distinctly
visible by holding a white piece of paper behind them to
throw them into sharp relief. This object-lesson will
illustrate the manner in which a sky-line or a sheet
of water, for instance, affects the visibility of object
seen against such backgrounds. The effect of movement
on visibility has been dealt with in para. 3 (iii) of this
section.

(iv)
Use of Field-Glasses.
—This can be practised as described
in Sec. 34, para. 6.

5. Military Vocabulary and Study of Ground.
—This instruction
can be carried out on the Target with scenery and
figures, including those which represent troops in different
formations, artillery, transport, etc., and also on Landscapes
according to the rules laid down in Sec. 35, paras. 3
to 6 inclusive.

212

6. Range-Cards and Range-Marks
(Sec. 40).—The Target
with scenery and also Landscapes may be used for lectures
on the choice of features of ground for taking ranges, and
for the preparation of range-cards and range-marks in
attack and defence.

7. Observation of Fire.
—Observation of fire can be practised
on miniature ranges as described in Sec. 73, para 4.

8. Fire Direction and Control.
—(i)
Lectures.
—Lectures on
organization for fire action and the tactical application of
fire, based on the instruction laid down in Chapter VI,
can be illustrated on the Target with scenery and figures,
and also to some extent on Landscapes. These lectures
should include subjects such as allocation of frontages and
objectives to fire-units, indication of the limits of sectors
by description points, justification for opening fire, choice
of targets, concentration and distribution of fire, mutual
support, surprise, and use of rapid fire [see Sec. 74,
para. 5 (iii)].

(ii)
Description and Recognition of Targets.
—This instruction
should be carried out as described in Sec. 45 on the Target
with scenery and figures, and on Landscapes. In
training fire-unit commanders in the description of targets
on the Solano Target the apparatus should be arranged
beforehand, so that the instructor is able suddenly to
expose targets representing bodies of troops at different
distances in various parts of the field of fire (see Sec. 74,
para. 4).

9. Fire Discipline.
—Men may be practised in the duties
of fire discipline, including passing fire orders, concurrently
with the training of fire-unit commanders as described in
Sec. 47, paras. 8 to 11 inclusive. They may also be practised
in working in pairs during exercises in fire discipline,
and by individual field practices and observation practices.

213

Section
73
.—Range Practices.

1. Arrangement of Target.
—The arrangement of the Target
for grouping and application practices is shown in

Fig. 53
. This arrangement must be modified if the practice
is an instructional one, fewer targets being used, as it may
not be found possible to accommodate eight firers and eight
instructors at the firing-point at the same time. In this
case targets should be placed on Tier A only. The arrangement
of the Target for observation practices is described
in Appendix VII, para. 6, and shown in
Fig. 57
.

2. Grouping Practices.
—The dimensions of the rings to
be used in measuring groups in grouping practices fired on
miniature ranges are given in Sec. 49, para. 6 (xi). Instruction
will be carried out on the principles laid down in
Sec. 52, and Sec. 56. The conditions of practices are laid
down in Tables A and B.

3. Instructional Practices.
—The conditions of these practices
are laid down in Tables A and B.

4. Observation Practices.
—These practices can be carried
out with figures to practise men in the duties described
in Sec. 47, para. 4. The range may be estimated by the
size of the figure fired at, and aim corrected by observing
the results of fire as the bullets strike the sawdust bank
or paper screen (see Sec. 74, para. 6, Practice No. 4).

Section
74
.—Field Practices, Night Firing and
Competitions.

1. Arrangement of Target and Number of Firers.
—The
arrangement of the Target for individual and collective
field practices is shown in Figs. 55 and 56, and fully
described in the
Official Handbook
mentioned in the

214

Appendix, VII, para. 1. Targets may be arranged on
both tiers. If necessary, as many as eight men may fire
individual field practices at the same time. Six or eight
men under a fire-unit commander is a convenient number
for firing collective field practices either on the Target or
landscapes. The Firers may represent a single fire-unit
under its commander, or be divided into two or more fire-units,
each under its own commander. The arrangement of
landscapes for collective field practices is shown in Figs. 57
and 58, and described in the
Official Handbook
referred to
above.

2. Conditions of Practices.
—(i) The conditions of practices
as laid down in this chapter may be varied at the discretion
of the instructor to suit the skill of firers. Instructors
should encourage fire-unit commanders and men
to devise the conditions of practical individual and collective
field practices. Interest will be added to a practice if
men are allowed, under his supervision, to arrange the
scenery and place targets in position for practices to be
carried out by their comrades. Before commencing, the
object of each practice will be explained to the firers by the
instructor.

(ii) After firing, the squad will proceed to the Target,
when the results of firing will be criticized and the causes
of failure discussed. Hits on figure targets will be counted
for scoring according to the rules laid down in the field
practices in Chapter VIII and in Appendix, VI, paras. 4
and 5. Rifles are to be loaded before or after commencement
of practice or appearance of targets, as ordered. Movement
may be carried out by running distances representing an
advance either outside the range or between firing-point
and butt,
due precautions being taken to avoid accidents
.

3. Individual Field Practices
—(i)
Demonstrations.
—Individual
field practices may with advantage commence
with demonstrations carried out with or without firing on

215

the Target, arranged with scenery and figures to illustrate
lectures on important subjects, such as justification for
opening fire, choice of targets, and the duties of men
working in pairs.

(ii)
Justification for Opening Fire.
—For example, justification
for opening fire may be illustrated by the following object-lesson,
which will also help men to recognize the limit of
individual fire, and explain the need for collective fire beyond
close range. Figures representing infantry lines in extended
order at 2,000, 1,800, 1,600, 1,400, 1,200, 1,000, 800, 600,
and 400 yards, may be exposed on Tiers A and B to represent
the advance of an enemy in attack. All the figures
will be shown against background which harmonizes with
their colouring. The difficulty of discerning targets beyond
close range will be demonstrated. The difficulty of estimating
the range of the figures beyond close range by the
difference in their size, even when difficulties due to atmospheric
influences and movement are absent, will also be
indicated. Finally, a good shot may be told off to fire
five rounds at a 1,000 yards figure; five rounds at a 600
yards figure; and five rounds at a 400 yards figure, to
illustrate the limit of probable assurance of fire effect from
individual fire, and to demonstrate the principle which
underlies justification for opening individual fire—namely,
that such fire must not be opened unless there is at least
probable assurance of effect.

(iii)
Choice of Targets.
—The principle underlying the choice
of targets in individual firing may be illustrated in the
same manner by arranging figures on the Target so as
to represent more or less favourable or important targets
between which firers may commonly have to choose. For
instance, figures representing a line of men in extended order
may be arranged so that the intervals between the men in
some parts of the line are considerable, while in others they
art crowded together, shoulder to shoulder (see footnote,

216

p. 226). Here the thickest part of the line is the more favourable
target. Again, targets which are distinctly visible owing
to the effect of background are more favourable than those
which are rendered indistinct owing to this cause. Targets
consisting of men in the standing position are, other conditions
being equal, more favourable than those in the kneeling
and lying positions, and men in the open are obviously
more favourable targets than those partly concealed behind
cover, especially if it affords protection from fire. These
object-lessons illustrate the principle underlying the choice
of targets—namely, to select the target which gives the
greatest probable assurance of fire effect, or which in any
given situation is the most important.

(iv) Object-lessons illustrating other important points
may be arranged on the Target by instructors on the same
principle as the above examples.

(v)
Conditions of Practices.
—
The Individual Field Practices
Nos. 1 to 6 on
pp. 185
-188, Chapter VIII, can all be adapted
with necessary modifications as to targets, numbers firing, etc.,
for firing on the Solano Target with scenery, scenic accessories,
and figures.
The following are examples of other individual
field practices which can be carried out on the Target, and
are suitable for both instruction and competitions. Firing
should be carried out in the different firing positions
from behind cover, as well as without cover, or rest for
arms or rifle.

Individual Field Practices on the Solano Target.

No. 1.

Object
: To teach men to open fire with effect quickly.

Rounds
: 6 per man.

Targets
: 2 per man—one 300 yards head and shoulders, and
one 400 yards standing figure on different tiers.

217

Directions
: Each target to be exposed singly in any order, 3 times
for 5 seconds, at uncertain intervals of not less than 10 seconds.
1 round to be fired on each exposure.

No. 2.

Object
: To teach men to open fire with effect quickly and to
aim off.

Rounds
: 5 per man.

Targets
: 1 per man—400 or 600 yards standing figure.

Directions
: The figures will be arranged on the carriers of the
crossing mechanism on Tier A. Scenic accessories, such as houses,
trees, foliage, etc., will be arranged on the Target so as to conceal
the figures at their starting-points, and also along the
front groove

of the Tier across which the figures will be moved with irregular
intervals of some 6 to 12 inches between them. The figures will
be moved from the concealment of cover to represent an enemyâs
scout doubling across the firerâs front from cover to cover. On
disappearing behind each successive piece of cover the figures
will be halted for an uncertain time, not less than 5 seconds,
after which they will be retired or advanced to the shelter of the
nearest cover, when they will again be halted. Each figure will
be exposed in this manner 5 times. 1 round will be fired on each
exposure while the figure is in motion.

No. 3.

Object
: To teach men to mark down an enemy.

Rounds
: 6 per man.

Targets
: 2 per man—400 or 600 yards standing figure.

Directions
: One figure on each tier of the Target fixed to clips
either without cover in front or behind cover which affords protection
from fire, such as rocks, a wall, or a bank. The cover
must not conceal more than half the figure when exposed. At
first cover may be isolated to facilitate marking down, but as
progress is made it should be continuous. Each target to be
exposed singly for 3 seconds in any order and at uncertain
intervals of not less than 10 seconds, then disappeared for 10
seconds, and then exposed again for 4 seconds. 1 round to be
fired at each target on second exposure. This practice can also
be carried out with the men working in pairs and taking it in
turns to fire and to help to observe and mark down.

218

No. 4.

Object
: To teach men to fire at ground.

Rounds
: 3 per man.

Targets
: 1 per man—400 or 600 yards standing figure.

Directions
: The figure, must be fixed to clips on either tier
behind cover which does not afford protection from fire, such
as a bush or hedge. The cover must not conceal more than
half the figure when exposed. At first, to render marking down
and aim easy, cover may be isolated, such as a bush, but as
progress is made it should be continuous. Each figure will be
exposed for 3 seconds and then disappeared to represent a man
advancing and taking cover. 10 seconds will be allowed for
firing 3 shots at the ground line of the spot marked down for
the position of the figure behind cover. This practice can also
be carried out with the men working in pairs and taking it in
turns to fire and to help to observe and mark down. Hits may
be checked as follows—on the back of cover immediately in
front of the figure an outline in pencil must be drawn of its
head and shoulders to represent the figure in the lying position
behind cover. The shot-holes will then show whether hits have
been scored.

No. 5.

Object
: To teach men to snapshoot.

Rounds
: 6 per man.

Targets
: 3 per man—300 or 400 yards head and shoulders
figures and 400 or 600 yards standing figures.

Directions
: A great variety of these practices can be arranged,
and men should be encouraged to devise the conditions. Targets
must be concealed on the moving and disappearing mechanism
Tier A and on Tier B behind cover such as walls, rocks, trees,
hedges, bushes, houses, and cottages (see Appendix, Sec. VII,
para. 4). Figures will be exposed to represent men firing over
cover and round the side of cover. The doors and windows of
the larger houses and cottages may be cut out and disappearing
figures exposed for short intervals to represent men firing from
them as in
street fighting
. Targets may also be exposed to represent
men moving quickly across open spaces between cover such
as trees, etc., to represent targets seen in
wood fighting
.

219

Men will fire from behind cover, care being taken to see that
they watch ground while waiting to fire in correct positions
with the minimum of exposure, and that all unnecessary movements
in loading and firing are avoided. Men will be trained
to aim and fire immediately on the appearance of the target
with the minimum of exposure while doing so, and to take
cover, load, and resume their watch for targets as quickly as
possible after firing. Each target will be exposed twice for
4 seconds. They will be exposed singly in any order at intervals
not exceeding 10 seconds, 1 round will be fired on each exposure.
They may also be exposed simultaneously to test the
judgment of men in the
choice of targets
.

No. 6.

Object
: To teach men to combine rapidity with accuracy of
fire.

Rounds
: 5 per man.

Targets
: 1 per man—400 or 600 yards standing figure.

Directions
: On the exposure of the target men will fire 5 rounds
as rapidly as possible. The time taken by each man in firing
5 rounds will be checked. Accuracy must not be sacrificed for
rapidity, and hits scored will be more important than the time
taken in firing.

No. 7.

Object
: To teach men to combine fire and movement.

Rounds
: 6 per man.

Targets
: Any of the following: (
a
) A row of Solano figures
representing a line of loopholed head-cover entrenchments.
(
b
) A row of 300 or 400 yards head-and-shoulder figures representing
men firing from a bank or open trench. (
c
) A row of
low bushes representing the line of a screened entrenchment.
(
d
) A stone wall marked with loopholes or with head-and-shoulder
figures exposed at intervals to represent men firing over it.
(
e
) A row of houses defended from doors and windows. (
f
) Folds
of ground, etc.

Directions
: The above targets, (
a
) to (
e
) inclusive, may be
arranged on either tier; (
f
) will consist of features shown on
the scenery itself. The firers will represent a firing-line advancing
at close range. Firing will be carried out as follows:

220

2 rounds will be fired; the men will then run 50 yards and fire
2 more rounds, after which they will run 50 yards again and fire
the last 2 rounds.

4. Fire Direction Practices
(Sec. 42, paras. 8 and 9, Sec. 47,
paras. 2 to 4 inclusive, and Sec. 54, para. 3).—(i) Though
officers and N.C.O.âs cannot be trained satisfactorily in the
important duties of ranging on miniature ranges, much useful
instruction can be carried out by fire direction practices
on the target and landscapes, the object of which will be
to teach fire-unit commanders and men to work together
in some of the principal duties of fire direction, control, and
discipline before proceeding to fire collective field practices.

(ii) The object of these practices is to train fire-unit
commanders to discern targets quickly, describe them
accurately, and give clear, correct fire orders (Sec. 46,
paras. 1 to 6 inclusive), and to train men to recognize
targets, obey and pass fire orders. Both officers and men
will previously have been trained to some extent in these
duties. In fire direction practices they should be carried
out as a whole under a time limit, reckoned from the
appearance of the target to the end of firing or aiming in
obedience to fire orders. The time limit should be decreased
as progress is made. Observers should also be
trained in their duties in these practices, which should be
devised so as to train both fire-unit commanders and
observers to watch for signals and maintain communication
with neighbouring units (Sec. 42, para. 8 (ii) (
b
), and
para. 9).

(iii) The target should be arranged before practices with
a variety of figures representing various arms and troops
in different formations at various ranges (Appendix, VII,
para. 5). They should be exposed suddenly for short
time limits corresponding approximately to the probable
time exposure of such targets on service. Fire-unit commanders
should use field-glasses and include ranges estimated

221

by the size of the figures in fire orders. Passing
fire orders may be practised by passing them down a line
of men to those at the firing-point (Sec. 46, para. 7). This
should be done if possible while firing is proceeding.
Practices may be carried out with firing or by aiming with
rifles on rests for laying aim. Instructors must carefully
criticize the work of both fire-unit commanders and men.

5. Collective Field Practices
(Sec. 54, para. 4)—(i)
Demonstrations.
—These
practices may be preceded by lectures
demonstrating some of the
Points for Criticism
set out in
Sec. 54, para. 4 (iii), and also points in the instruction laid
down in Sec. 35, para. 4 (
Reconnaissance of Ground in
Attack and Defence
), Sec. 42 (
Organization for Fire Action
),
Sec. 43 (
Effect of Fire at Different Ranges on Various Formations
and Objectives
), and Sec. 44 (
Tactical Application
of Fire
).

(ii)
Arrangement of Target for Demonstrations.
—Demonstrations
should be carried out on the Target arranged with
scenery and figures with or without firing to illustrate instruction.
The arrangement of the target for lectures and
demonstrations affords scope for skill and ingenuity on the
part of instructors, and may be used to give practical
instruction to N.C.O.âs and men engaged to help in arranging
the scenery and figures to illustrate various principles
and tactical schemes. The following are examples of simple
lessons which may be demonstrated on the Target.

(iii)
Examples of Demonstrations.

No. 1. Need for Collective Fire.
—The instruction laid down in
Sec. 11 may be demonstrated by arranging figures on the Target as
above described in para. 3 (ii), adding figures representing troops
in different formations, artillery and transport at ranges up to
2,500 yards. If the demonstration is carried out with firing, a
useful object lesson may be provided as follows. A row of
1,000 and 1,200 yard figures can be arranged on the clips so that
when exposed their heads will appear over continuous cover,
such as low bushes, to represent men firing from a bank or fold

222

of the ground. The figures will be arranged against background
which renders them invisible to the naked eye from the firing-point.
The firers will be told that they have come under the
fire of the enemy somewhere to their front, and that the need for
replying to it immediately to minimize its effect is urgent. They
will depend upon individual firing for fire effect. When they
have realized their helplessness, a fire-unit commander will
indicate the target and direct fire, the results of which will
be noted.

No. 2. Justification for Opening Fire
(Sec. 43 and Sec. 44, paras. 3 to
6 inclusive).—This may be demonstrated by various examples
carried out with or without firing to illustrate the principle that
fire must not be opened in attack or defence without reasonable
assurance of effect in regard to the object for which it is delivered.
For instance, a number of rounds may be fired at an extended
line of 2,000 or 1,600 yard figures, and an equal number of
rounds at an extended line of 1,000 and 800 yard figures, to
illustrate the greater effect of fire at closer ranges. It must be
explained, however, that exceptionally favourable targets may
justify the opening of fire at long and distant ranges [Sec. 43,
para. 2 (iii)].

No. 3. Choice of Targets
[Sec. 54, Note to para. 4 (iii)].—The
principle that the more favourable or important targets should be
chosen may be illustrated by various examples, as for instance by
exposing a line of 800 yard figures so that the heads and shoulders
only are visible above cover affording protection from fire, and
exposing a line of the same figures upright in the open to one
side. If carried out with firing, a demonstration of the effects
of converging fire (Sec. 44, para. 11) may be combined with that
of the choice of targets as follows: The firers may be divided
into two fire-units of four men each under its own commander.
Each unit will deliver deliberate fire for half a minute at a line
of 1,000 yard figures on Tier A within its own sector or frontage.
A dense line of 800 yards figures will then be exposed in the
centre of Tier B to represent a part of the enemyâs line which
has taken advantage of a covered approach or dead ground to
push forward. Both fire-unit commanders will at once divert
the fire of half their unit in a burst of rapid converging fire for
half a minute at this favourable target while continuing to keep
the enemyâs line to his front under fire with the rest of his unit
for the same time. Results of firing will be compared.

223

No. 4. Control of Fire as to Rate and Volume
(Sec. 44, paras. 14-17
inclusive).—The above object lesson illustrates the principle
governing the control of fire as to volume and rate, both of
which are increased to get the greatest possible effect against
very favourable or important targets. Many other object
lessons can be devised on the Target with figures to illustrate
the principles of fire control. For instance, against an enemyâs
entrenchment or firing line under cover, fire at longer ranges
will usually be deliberate, while against the dense line of
an attack at close range or against very favourable or important
targets, especially if they are fleeting, it will usually
be delivered in rapid bursts and in as great a volume as possible.
The relation between the rate and volume of fire and the object
for which it is delivered, and the circumstances under which it
is delivered, should be explained and demonstrated in connection
with fire control.

No. 5. Concentration and Distribution of Fire
[Sec. 44, paras. 8 and
9; and Sec. 54, para. 3 (v) to (vii) inclusive].—The broad principles
which govern the concentration and distribution of fire
may be illustrated by arranging figures representing troops in
different formations, machine guns, etc., at various ranges on
the Target, so that men can see the different kinds of targets
against which fire will be concentrated or distributed. For
instance, against a narrow-fronted column or machine gun fire
will be concentrated, while against lines of infantry in extended
order or the frontage of a defensive position fire will usually be
distributed. Fire may, however, be concentrated if part of a
line offers a favourable target through the men failing to keep
their extension and crowding together, on the principle that fire
should be concentrated against very vulnerable targets or at
points where it will produce increased effect.

No. 6. Mutual Support and Covering Fire
(Sec. 44, paras. 12 and
13).—The broad principles governing the application of fire in
mutual support and covering fire may be illustrated by arranging
simple tactical schemes on the Target in the following manner:
The firers will be divided into two fire-units, as in Demonstration
No. 3. They are supposed to be part of a firing line in
attack. To illustrate
mutual support
, one unit will be represented
by a line of figures on Tier B, directly in front of it. When
the figures are disappeared, the unit they represent is supposed
to be halted, and when they are exposed, it is supposed to be

224

advancing. The enemyâs position will be indicated as a definite
frontage in front of each unit on the scenery above Tier A, or
the scenic accessories on this tier. While both units are supposed
to be firing during a halt, the figures on Tier A will
be exposed, denoting that one unit is advancing. The commander
of the other unit will at once direct fire from part of
his unit in rapid fire against the front of the enemyâs position
to the front of the advancing unit, while keeping the enemyâs
position to his front under fire from the rest of his unit. To
illustrate
covering fire
, a line of figures on Tier B will represent
the firing line of an attack, to which the firers are supports on
high ground. The enemyâs front will be indicated on Tier A.
When the figures are exposed, denoting an advance by the firing
line, the supports will cover the advance by delivering heavy
fire at the enemyâs position to the front of the figures.

No. 7. Fire and Movement
(Sec. 44, para. 7).—The control of fire
in its application to movement may, for example, be illustrated
by supposing the firers to be part of a force acting on the defensive
against an attacking force, represented by figures on the
Target. Considerations relative to opening fire may be studied,
together with the control of fire against advancing troops, with
the object of obtaining increased effect at closer ranges and
attempting surprise (Sec. 44, paras. 17 and 18). The rate and
volume of fire in relation to movement may be demonstrated
by illustrating by figures arranged on both tiers of the Target
the different stages of an attack
31
in column and extended order
formations from 1,600 to 600 or 400 yards range, an advance,
and explaining that the rate of fire is usually deliberate when
the enemy halts or takes cover, and is increased in rate and
volume when his troops present favourable targets during
forward movement, more especially to beat them off in the act
of assaulting [Sec. 44, para. 16 (i) and (ii)].

No. 8. Organization for Fire Action
(Sec. 42).—Before commencing
collective field practices, the principles of organization for fire
action, so far as it concerns the allotment of frontages and the
division of the field of fire into separate sectors for each fire
unit should be demonstrated to fire-unit commanders on the
Target or on landscape targets. Platoon and section commanders

inclusive.

225

may be practised in indicating the limits of sectors to their units,
after the frontage allotted to their unit in a field of fire has been
pointed out to these commanders. The limits of sectors must
be indicated in the manner described in Sec. 42, para. 3, and
illustrated in
Fig. 47
. The nature and details of fields of fire
should be varied as much as possible to accustom unit commanders
to dealing with all kinds of ground. The field of fire
may be divided up into two, three, or four sectors, a different
unit commander being made to indicate the limits of each sector.

(iv)
Conditions of Practices.
—
The collective field practices
on
pp. 188
to
192
inclusive may be adapted for miniature
range firing on the Target by modifying the conditions as
may be necessary.
The conditions of practices may also
be based on the ideas contained in the examples of demonstrations
given in para. (iii) above. Instructors should
encourage fire-unit commanders and N.C.O.âs to devise
simple tactical schemes for collective field practices which,
besides training officers and men in the duties of fire direction,
control, and discipline, will teach them to give effect
to the principles which govern the application of fire.
The arrangement of the Target by men for practices to be
fired by their comrades may also be used by the instructor
for imparting useful practical knowledge. Special attention
should be paid in these practices to firing from cover,
passing fire orders, and fire discipline generally. The
following examples of practices will serve as a guide to
instructors with regard to conditions.

(v)
Special Rules.
—Practices will begin with the caution
Commence
,
and will end with the order
Cease Fire
. The number,
nature, and positions of targets will be unknown to firers, and
must be invisible until exposed or moved. Targets may be
exposed without warning any time after the caution
Commence
,
and the order, time, and duration of exposure or movement will
be unknown to firers in every case. All information which will
help commanders and men to use their judgment will be given
them beforehand, when the object of the practice will be explained,

226

but no help or suggestion as to the manner in which
they will carry out their duties will be told them either before or
during a practice. Criticism will not be confined to the points
noted in the following examples of practices, but will be general.
These examples are purposely made simple, and devised as far
as possible to deal with situations which may confront men in
the present campaign. They may be varied by Instructors as
desired.

Collective Field Practices on the Solano Target.

No. 1.

Object
: Test of fire direction and control.

Targets
: Tier A (left section) infantry line standing, extended
order, 1,200 yards. Right section, infantry line standing, extended
order, 800 yards. Tier B (left half) infantry line standing,
extended order, 1,000 yards—half of line crowded together.
32

Directions
: The firers will represent two separate units in
neighbouring localities of a defensive position. The target on
Tier A (right section) will first be exposed for ten seconds. After
a pause, both targets on Tier A will be exposed together for ten
seconds. After a pause the targets on Tier A (right section)
and Tier B will be exposed together for ten seconds.
Particulars
:
The enemy at 1,200 yards is difficult to discern owing to background
and undergrowth, and the defence know that he is close
to a covered approach which will bring him to 1,000 yards of
their line.
Criticism
: (i)
Justification for Opening Fire
: (
a
) By
both units on first exposure of 800 yardsâ target; (
b
) by both
units on exposure of 1,200 yards target. (ii)
Choice of Targets
and Mutual Support
: By left unit on simultaneous exposure of
1,200 and 800 yards targets. (iii)
Rate of Fire
: (
a
) By both
units on first exposure of 800 yards target; (
b
) by left unit at
1,000 yards target. (iv)
Concentration and Distribution of Fire
:
By left unit at 1,000 yards target. (v)
Results of Firing.

227

No. 2.

Object
: Test of fire direction by auxiliary aiming-marks
(aiming-off).

Target
: A point on the scenery indicated to unit commander
as concealing enemyâs machine-gun at 1,400 yards.

Directions
: Commander is ordered to open fire at once, allowing
one, two, or three fingersâ breadths for the deflection of right-angle
winds of varying strength from left or right. He will select
auxiliary aiming-marks for direction of fire and aiming-off under
a time limit.
Criticism
:
Choice of description-point. Clearness of
fire orders. Quick opening and rate of fire. Results of firing.

No. 3.

Object
: Test of fire direction by anticipatory orders.

Directions
: A variety of targets and tactical schemes may be
employed for this practice, which may also be made to combine
fire and movement. For example, the firers may represent a
force in pursuit of retreating troops, and run 100 yards in intervals
of firing to represent an advance. At the end of movement
prearranged crossing and disappearing targets will be exposed
or moved at points previously known to commander, who will
indicate them to men, telling them to open fire when target
appears without further orders. To develop individual judgment,
men will be made to use their judgment in applying fire
according to nature and importance of targets.
Criticism:
:
Recognition
of targets. Quick opening of fire. Application of fire as to
rate, volume, concentration, or distribution according to nature
of target. Fire discipline.

No. 4.

Object:
: Test of individual judgment in applying rapid fire.

Targets
: Tier A (left section), infantry line standing, extended
order, 600 yards. Line of head and shoulder figures 400 yards
on right section. Tier B, dense line standing figures, 400 yards,
or strip of cardboard of same measurements.

Directions
: Targets will be exposed once separately for 15
seconds each at intervals of 10 seconds between exposures in
following order: (i) 600 yards target; (ii) 400 yards head and

228

shoulders; (iii) 400 yards standing. Men will fire without
orders.
Criticism
:
Quick opening of fire. Rate of fire at first,
second, and third targets. Fire discipline. Unsteady firing.
Results of fire.

No. 5.

Object
: Test of individual judgment in applying fire to a tactical
situation.

Targets
: Tier A, infantry line standing, 800 yards. Tier B,
dense infantry line standing, 600 yards (figures or cardboard
strip).

Directions
: 600 yards target will first be exposed alone
representing attack at close range. 800 yards target representing
enemyâs supports will then be exposed for 15 seconds, the
600 yards target also remaining exposed for this period. Firers
will be told that they will succeed in checking enemyâs firing line
represented by first target exposed, and will then deal with the
situation as it develops without orders owing to sudden loss of
their commander at critical moment.
Criticism
:
Quick opening
of fire. Discernment of 800 yards target. Proportion and rate of
fire diverted from enemyâs firing-line to supports. Fire discipline.

No. 6.

Object
: Test of rapid fire.

Target
: Tier B, dense line of figures or strip of cardboard—400
yards or closer.

Directions
: Target will be exposed for 30 seconds to represent
an enemy delivering attack from his trenches on firers who are
entrenched close to and opposite his earthworks. When practice
commences, one firer as observer will watch the front, while
others will sit with their backs to target. When the observer
gives the alarm, firers will rise and open rapid fire. Arrangements
should be made to carry out this practice standing with
rifles rested, and if possible by firing from loopholed head-cover
improvised with sandbags, etc., as shown on p. 82 of

Field Entrenchments
of this series. The practice may also be
fired at dusk or with artificial lighting lowered to give the effect
of uncertain light.
Criticism
:
Work of observer. Quick opening
of fire. Fire discipline. Percentage of hits to rounds fired.

6. Landscape Target Practices.
—As already stated, range
and individual field practices cannot be carried out on
landscape targets. Collective field practices can be carried
out on landscape targets with either ·303 or ·22 ammunition
on 30 yards and miniature ranges. As progress is made,
landscape target practices should be carried out with a
time limit for indicating targets, giving and passing fire
orders, and firing. When firing at landscape targets, rifles
will be given elevation, so that bullets aimed at objectives
on the landscapes will strike a blank or shadowgraph sky
screen above the whole of the landscape, even if the objective
is at the bottom of the landscape (
Fig. 57
). For
method of valuing hits and scoring in these practices, see
Appendix, VI, para. 5. The following are examples of
collective field practices which may be carried out on
landscape targets:

Collective Field Practices on Landscape Targets.

No. 1.

Object
: To teach concentration of fire.

Directions
: Fire is opened on a given point on the landscape
as ordered. If the point is clearly indicated and recognized, and
if sighting and fire are accurate, a dense group of shot-holes will
be made on sky-screen, the point of mean impact being a point
the correct height
vertically
above the point of aim [see Appendix,
VI, para. 5 (i)].

No. 2.

Object
: To teach distribution of fire.

Directions
: Fire is opened along a given line of country as
ordered. The shot-holes should appear evenly distributed
along a line on the sky-screen at a certain height, and immediately
above the line of country indicated [see Appendix, VI,
para. 5 (ii)].

230

No. 3.

Object
: To teach the use of combined sights.

Directions
: As in No. 1, but half the firers will adjust sights
50 yards above and half 50 yards below the range given. Results
will show two groups, which would be merged into one group
of great depth in the case of fire of sufficient volume, such as
that of two platoons, and illustrates the use of combined sights
for increasing the zone of effective fire.

No. 4.

Object
: To teach observation of fire.

Directions
: A point is indicated on landscape (preferably near
the top), and a visible
33
sketch of it is made at any height on the
screen and
vertically
above it. The commander will open fire with
such elevation as he thinks necessary, and then correct from
observation of shot-holes until on the target.

7. Night Firing.
—The automatic alignment of rifles may
be practised on miniature ranges. Aim may be taken at
a strip of brown or grey paper representing a line of standing
figures at 100 and 200 yardsâ distance, scaled down to size
for 25 yards, and attached to the landscape target screen
faced with blank paper (
Fig. 57
). Men may also be taught
to aim rifles from improvised night-firing rests at objectives
on the Solano Target or Landscape Targets. The field of
fire containing the objectives may then be concealed by a
paper screen, the rifles fired, and results examined. As
there is no recoil with the miniature cartridge, this practice
will not prove the utility of the rest.

8. Miniature Range Cadet Competitions.
—The rules regarding
competitions set out in Sec. 69 apply also to miniature
ranges. The various practices laid down in this chapter

231

and Chapter VIII will serve as the basis of various competitions
on miniature as well as open ranges. Tests in
grouping and application may be found suitable for cadet
competitions in elementary forms of shooting. Regulation
as well as Solano elementary and instructional targets may
be used (see Appendix, VIII).

241

III. DIRECTIONS FOR USE OF THE AIM-CORRECTOR.

1. This device is illustrated in
Fig. 65
. It consists of a small
steel box moving freely on a stem, so as to enable it to be made
level with the back-sight when the latter is set at various elevations.
It is secured to the rifle, behind the back-sight, by a
spring clip. A piece of smoked glass is inserted into one of the
two cross grooves, so that it forms an angle of 45 degrees with
the barrel.

2. In placing the aim-corrector on the rifle, the open side of
the box may be turned to the right or left, care being taken
that, when the glass is inserted in the box, it is placed in the
cross-groove, which will cause it to present to the observer,
who is opposite the open end, a reflection of the backsight, the
foresight, and the mark at which aim is to be taken. If the glass
is placed in the wrong cross-groove, the only image reflected
upon it will be the recruitâs eye.

3. The instructor, who may take up his position on either side
of the recruit, can see the alignment of the sights while the
trigger is being pressed by means of the reflection in the glass,
without in any degree obscuring the recruitâs aim. He can see
if aim is correctly maintained when the trigger is pressed, or
if it is deflected by this act, and can tell whether the recruit
has noted and correctly declared any deflection due to faulty
trigger-pressing. In certain lights, the image on the glass
may be rather indistinct, but with care it is possible to discern
it sufficiently clearly for instruction. In correcting errors, the
instructor must remember that, when looking in the glass, the
reflection, as in the case of an ordinary mirror, is
reversed laterally
,
but is
correct vertically
. For instance, if the sight appears
upon the glass to the right of the mark, it is actually to the left
of it. If, however, it appears high or low in relation to the mark,
it is actually above or below the mark.

242

Fig. 65.
—
Diagram illustrating Use of Aim-Corrector
.

243

IV. DIRECTIONS FOR USE OF THE AIMING-DISC.

The aiming-disc is a small rod, bearing a disc of metal or
cardboard, painted white, about 1½ inches in diameter (
Fig. 66
).
On the front is a black bullâs-eye ½ inch in diameter, in the
centre of which is pierced a hole just large enough to admit the
point of a pencil. On the back is a bullâs-eye, also ½ inch in
diameter, placed so that the six oâclock line is just above the
hole which is in the centre of the bullâs-eye on the front.

Fig. 66.
—
Aiming-Disc.

The instructor may ascertain the accuracy of the recruitâs
aim and his power to press the trigger without disturbing aim
by the use of the aiming-disc in the following manner: He
should take up his position in front of the recruit at a distance of
about 4 or 5 feet from the muzzle of his rifle when held to the
shoulder for firing in the lying position, with his eye to the hole
in front of the disc (
Fig. 19
). The recruit is then instructed to
bring the rifle to his shoulder for aiming, to aim and press the
trigger at the aiming-mark at the back of the disc.

Through the aperture at the bottom of the bullâs-eye at which
the recruit takes aim and snaps, the instructor is able to see the
recruitâs faults of aim, and to note whether his aim is disturbed
when the trigger is pressed. The instructor is also enabled to

244

note the rapidity with which he takes aim and presses the
trigger.—This practice is useful to develop in men the power
of aiming rapidly and correctly, which is essential for snapshooting
and rapid firing, without the danger of their contracting
bad or careless habits through hurried movements.

V. âHARMONIZINGâ RIFLES FOR MINIATURE
RANGE PRACTICES.

1.
Rifles are said to be harmonized when their slight individual
differences in shooting are corrected by adjustment of
sights. This harmonizing or correction of differences in the
shooting of the rifles used in miniature range practices is necessary
to obtain satisfactory results.
Rifles must be harmonized
for firing direct at targets as well as for firing with elevation
, as
in landscape practices. With reference to direct firing at targets,
it has been found that with service rifles an elevation of 300 yards
is necessary to obtain the greatest possible accuracy. Consequently,
rifles must be sighted for 300
yards
before being harmonized
for firing direct at targets according to the method
described in the following paragraph, aim being taken at the
aiming-marks on the
lower
horizontal line, and differences being
discovered by the grouping of shots on the aiming-marks—not
on the line above. The sighting necessary to correct differences
in each rifle will also be recorded on a board hung for reference
on the miniature range, as described in para. 3.

2. Method of Harmonizing Rifles
(see sky screen,
Fig. 58
).—(i) The
following is the method of harmonizing rifles: The rifles selected
for miniature range practices must be numbered from 1 on consecutively.
Each rifle must be marked with its number. When
this is done, a horizontal line must be drawn along the bottom of
the blank sky screen. At intervals of about 12 inches along this
horizontal line a number of aiming-marks must be painted. The
number of aiming-marks must equal that of the rifles to be harmonized,
so that there is one aiming-mark for each rifle. At a
distance of 26½ inches above the line of aiming-marks another
horizontal line must be drawn on the sky screen, which must
be visible from the firing-point. This distance has been chosen

245

because it is sufficient to cause shots aimed at objectives at the
bottom of the landscape to clear the top of it and strike the sky
screen.

(ii)
Harmonizing Rifles for Elevation.
—Each rifle will then be
adjusted for 1,200 yards. Each rifle, thus sighted, will be fired
by a reliable shot with regular aim at one of the aiming-marks.
The sights of each rifle will be adjusted until shots which strike
above or below the upper horizontal line on the sky screen (when
it is sighted for 1,200 yards) strike the line itself. When shots
fired from all the rifles strike the line after sights have been
adjusted in this manner, they are said to be harmonized.

3. Record of Sighting.
—The variations of each rifle, if any,
from the original sighting at 1,200 yards—or 300 yards in the
case of sighting for direct hits—will be noted, and its variations
written down for reference against the number of the rifle on a
board to be hung on the wall of the miniature range. The following
is an example of the record of sighting:

VI. SCORING AND SIGNALLING.

1.
When a shot strikes the target so that the circumference of
the mark cuts the outer edge of any ring or figure, it is to be
counted as hitting within that ring or figure, as the case may be.
No shot is to be counted unless the whole or part of the mark
of the bullet is seen on the face of the target. A
ricochet
usually
makes a long, ragged hole or mark.

2. Elementary and Figure Targets.

5. Scoring in Landscape Target Practices.
—(i) A measuring-rod,
26½ inches long, is required to test the accuracy of both concentrated
and distributed collective grouping. The following
is the method of valuing groups for scoring. When collective
fire has been concentrated on any objective on the landscape,
the rod is held vertically against the screen with the bottom of
it resting on the point of aim. A mark is then made on the sky-screen
at the top of the rod. This mark indicates where the
centre of the group of shot-holes should be. For instructional
practices the groups may be valued on the principle that the
smaller the group the greater the fire effect. For competitions
two concentric wire rectangles, 5 inches by 4 inches and 2½ inches
by 2 inches respectively, may be used for scoring. The rectangles
will be placed over the group, their longest sides being vertical,
with their centre placed on the mark indicating where the centre
of the shot group should be. Every shot in the inner rectangle
will then count two points, and every shot in the remainder of
the larger rectangle will count one point. For every shot outside
the larger rectangle two points will be deducted.

(ii) When fire has been distributed between two points on
the landscape, a mark is made 26½ inches vertically above each
point, as already described. These two marks are joined by a
line parallel to that along which fire has been distributed. A
line 1½ inches above, and another 1½ inches below, this line are
drawn parallel to it. The ends of these lines are then joined
by vertical lines which pass through the two marks joined by
the centre line. The rectangle formed in this manner is divided
vertically into equal parts, being either one for each firer or one
for each fire-unit. Each group of shots fired by a firer or a fire-unit
should be found grouped in the proper part of the rectangle.
Each shot in its proper part will count two points. For each
shot outside its proper part two points will be deducted. For
every part of the rectangle which is empty five points will be
deducted.

248

VII. SOLANO TARGET—MARKS I AND II.

1.
Official Handbook.
—Full directions regarding the Solano
Target and landscape targets, together with information as to
their use for instruction, are contained in the official handbook—
Standard
Equipment for Miniature Ranges
(40, War Office,
2005)—from which the following short extracts are made. One
of these handbooks is supplied to units with each Solano Target,
and should be kept for reference.

2.
Framework and Mechanism.
(
Fig. 53
).—The Mark I Target
consists of a framework containing two tiers 10 feet long—Tier A
(higher), and Tier B (lower). Tier A is fitted with crossing
target mechanism, operating two target carriers from opposite
ends of the Tier, and clips for disappearing targets arranged in
two separate sections which can be operated simultaneously or
separately. Tier B is fitted with falling target clips, which allow
targets to fall when hit. Falling clips can be raised and lowered
from the firing-point, like the disappearing clips on Tier A. The
former can be shifted to right and left, and the latter linked
together with coupling clips to facilitate any desired arrangement
of targets or figures. All mechanism can be operated from
the firing-point by means of cords labelled to show the particular
mechanism they operate (
Fig. 54
).

3.
Scenery.
—There are two types of scenery—A and C—consisting
of backgrounds which will serve to represent foreground,
middle distance, and distance of almost any kind of country in
any part of the world. The scenery is pasted on frames, and
can be placed in position on the target in a moment (Figs. 55
and 56). Patching pieces are provided to repair shot-holes
which are not visible from the firing-point to the naked eye.

4.
Scenic Accessories
.—The details of a landscape can be arranged
on the target by placing the various scenic accessories,
consisting of colour-printed representations of various natural
and other features, mounted on stiff card, in any desired position
on either tier by fixing them in grooves made for this purpose
either behind targets or in front to represent cover. The scenic
accessories are coloured and scaled for different ranges, the
range being printed on each. They may be used to represent
the following features:

249

Wooded hills.

Flat-topped hills or kopjes.

Conical hills.

Woods.

Fir-wood.

Group of houses with church.

Group of cottages.

Solano Figures.
—The Solano figures are all scaled to size for
various distances, and consist of the following brown, grey, or
colour-printed figures. Each figure is provided with a base
equal in depth to the clips which hold them in position.

Observation Practices.
—Observation practices may be carried
out by heaping a bank of sawdust at the foot of the apparatus
below Tier B, with its surface sloping at the same angle as the
end-frames. To fix targets in the sawdust, attach to
Observation
Practice Holders
consisting of iron pins grooved at the top to
hold targets.
Care must be taken to remove all sawdust and grit
displaced by bullets from the falling target clips and other mechanism,
or their action may be clogged. A brush should be used to clean
the mechanism after observation practices.

7.
Landscape Targets.
—The official handbook above referred to
contains information as to fixing landscape targets to the framework
of the Solano Target in position for instruction in firing
(
Fig. 57
).

VIII. SOLANO ELEMENTARY AND INSTRUCTIONAL
TARGETS.
34

1. In
Musketry Regulations
, para. 361, it is laid down that in
carrying out training on miniature ranges
due regard must be
paid to the visibility of service targets, and bullâs-eye targets must
be used for the first few rounds only
. In para. 206 (iii) of
Musketry
Regulations
(see Sec. 17, para. 4 of this book) focussing the eye
on the fore-sight of the rifle instead of on the object is indicated
as a common fault which instructors must guard against in
elementary stages of training. This error is common when bullâs-eye
targets are used, and unless remedied will adversely affect
shooting at service Targets, on which the eye must be focussed,
and which must be watched closely when firing.

2.
Elementary Targets
(Figs. 67 and 68).—The Solano Elementary
Targets have been designed to counteract the tendency to
focus the eye on the fore-sight instead of on the target, and may
be used for grouping and application practices after firing at the
bullâs-eye target. These targets are coloured green, brown, and
grey, instead of white, to accustom the eye to the tints of natural

251

252

backgrounds against which service targets will be seen. The
aiming-mark in No. 2 is less distinct than in No. 1, to accustom
the eye gradually to focussing on indistinct targets when aiming.

.)

.)

3.
Triangle Aiming and Scoring Diagrams.
—(i) Triangles have been
substituted in these targets for concentric circles as aiming and
scoring diagrams, because they have a truer relation to the shape
of the human figure in both lying and upright positions. The
triangle on No. 1 target has relation to the human figure in an
upright position, and the triangle on No. 2 target to the human
figure in a lying position. The
dimensions of the triangles on these
targets correspond with the regulation grouping standards of the
British Army
.

253

Fig. 69.
—
A Circle (3 Inches in Diameter) and a Triangle
(3 Inches Equilateral) showing that the Triangle
as Aiming and Scoring Diagram induces Closer Grouping
than the Circle by Allowing Less Margin for
Both Vertical and Lateral Errors represented by
the Dots.

(ii) For elementary instruction in aiming the important six
oâclock line—the centre of the base of the triangle—is on these
targets an indicated instead of an imaginary line, as in the case
of the circular bullâs-eye. More consistent grouping is induced
by the triangle owing to the fact that it allows a much narrower

254

255

margin for lateral errors, while its conical shape and straight
base considerably curtail the scoring area for vertical errors off
the six oâclock line as compared with the circle (
Fig. 69
). The
triangle, moreover, as an aiming and scoring surface puts a

256

premium upon a
low point of aim
and from the first inculcates in
men, as a habit, this vital principle of marksmanship in war.

See footnote, p. 250
.)

(iii) The centre triangles are not made smaller, firstly, because
it is not desired to encourage the habit of slow aim which is
engendered by individual practice at very small marks, and which
militates against efficiency in snapshooting and rapid firing;
and, secondly, because it is not desired to encourage men to attain
a useless and disproportionate degree of excellence in firing at
elementary targets which is merely preparatory for practice at
service targets.

(Figs. 70, 71, and 72).—(i) These targets
are also coloured green, grey, and brown, the colour of the
uniform of the figures on them corresponding in each case with
that of the target. The figures are accurately scaled down to
correct size at 25 yards for the actual distances, so as to help
men in judging close range by accustoming the eye to the appearance
of men seen at different distances against backgrounds
which harmonize with the colour of their uniform. It must be

257

remembered that the figures on these targets, though necessarily
depicted in fixed postures as stationary marks, represent men
in movement during which they are seldom stationary or seen
in a fixed posture, except, possibly, for a few seconds while
lying down to fire.

(ii) Accordingly, marks are not given for hits scored on any
particular part of the figures depicted in fixed postures, which
would usually be seen in movement, but for shots grouped in
areas of comparative value as regards probable assurance of fire
effect, chosen in the light of experience of war as the best aiming
points for firing at figures in movement which frequently and
suddenly alternate between the upright and lying positions.
The centre triangles, representing the most valuable of these
grouping areas, are purposely made fairly large for the reasons
stated in connection with the elementary triangles—namely,
that they are grouping areas for snapshooting, and not for
deliberate firing.

FOOTNOTES:

1

See Appendix, VII.

2

These paragraphs contain information given by a captured German
officer who speaks with authority in regard both to musketry and machine
guns. His statements appear to represent the views held in the German
Army before the war, on which the training of the German soldier has
been based.

3

See Preface, para. 10.

4

This precaution will also be adopted when magazines are not charged.

5

For the maximum penetration of the pointed bullet in various substances
see Appendix,
Field Entrenchments
, of this series.

6

Tables giving the maximum height of the trajectory of the Mark VI
and VII bullets at different ranges, together with tables showing the angles
of descent for the last 100 yards of each range, will be found in
Musketry
Regulations
.

7

This target is described in para. 152,
Musketry Regulations
, Part II.

8

For description of and directions for use of Legret Aim-Teacher,
the Aim-Corrector, and Aiming-Disc, see Appendix. A list of necessary
appliances for aiming instruction, including aiming and firing rests,
etc., will be found in para. 6 of this section.

9

The position for aiming when lying will be taught previously to
this practice.

10

Shooting from the left shoulder is not to be permitted unless it is
rendered necessary by defective eyesight in the opinion of the Company
Commander.

All subordinate commanders are responsible for keeping their
respective superiors, as well as neighbouring commanders, regularly
informed of the progress of events, and of important changes in the
situation as they occur. All ranks should notice what takes place
within their view and hearing, and report anything of importance
accurately and at once to their immediate superior, who must pass
the information on to the higher commanders and to neighbouring
units. This is the foundation of co-operation in war, and is essential
not only in battle, but at every stage of a campaign.—

The methods by which the development of the soldierly spirit is
inculcated in men, and their character developed in discipline and
other soldierly qualities, are dealt with in Chapter I of
Drill and Field
Training
of this series.

All men not fully exercised in Table B with their companies (except
those referred to in the first sentence of the paragraph to which this note
refers) will be attached to other companies to carry out the range or field
practices omitted; or, if all companies have completed Table B, a party of
casuals may be formed to insure that all men qualified are fully exercised
in the whole of Table B.

Solano figures representing Infantry Lines consist of strips containing
a number of figures at intervals. Lines made of these figures can be
crowded together by overlapping two strips and fixing them together in
the clips.

33

This is not necessary on the âSection Fireâ Landscape Targets,
because the details of each landscape are reproduced in a monotint or
shadowgraph facsimile on the sky-screen to be used with it (
Fig. 58
).
Shot-marks are therefore seen grouped on or about the sky-screen
facsimile of the objective directly above it.

34

The illustrations of these Targets in this section only show the aiming-marks
and scoring diagrams. These are printed in the centre of square
card surfaces of convenient size in the usual manner, the cards being
green, grey, or brown, instead of white.

Obvious printer errors corrected silently.

Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

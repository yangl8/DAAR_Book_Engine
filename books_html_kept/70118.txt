TO T.

If the worldâs entirety

Is two eyes that shine on me,

Lay the blame at Loveâs door, dearest:

Thus he made my world to be.

Heâs the key to Heavenâs gate;

Heâs the scorn that tramples fate;

Heâs the worth of living, dearest,

Heâs the laugh that makes Death late.

Heâs the morning sun that wakes us

To the worth of all things, dearest,

Heâs the influence that makes us

Daily gladder, âtill God takes us!

Tomas Beauling.

PREFACE

I
t will be readily apparent that the aim of this
volume is to collect the choicest poems on
Cupid scattered throughout English literature.
A large harvest has been gleaned, and what my
judgment counts excellent, so far as practicable,
is represented. The attitude towards Cupid
has mostly been one of obstinate resistance, but
he has the element that wins,âsometimes
fantastically, sometimes pathetically. The beleaguering
little rogue never quits the field defeated,âto
him no suit is hopeless.

If some of the verses are not of high value as compositions
they are all-important when considered
relative to the subject, and a majority of the
poems are of unquestionable literary merit.

I beg to acknowledge the gracious favor of The
Century Co., Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Life
Publishing Co., Frederick A. Stokes Co., G. P.
Putnamâs Sons, Charles Scribnerâs Sons, Cassell
Publishing Co., and D. Appleton & Co., for the
use of copyright poems. I also gratefully acknowledge
the eminent courtesy of individual authors
for permission to reprint.

IN CUPIDâS COURT

CHANT ROYAL OF THE GOD OF LOVE

O most fair God, O Love both new and old,

That wast before the flowers of morning blew,

Before the glad sun in his mail of gold

Leapt into light across the first dayâs dew;

That art the first and last of our delight,

That in the blue day and the purple night

Holdest the hearts of servant and of king,

Lord of liesse, sovran of sorrowing,

That in thy hand hast heavenâs golden key

And hell beneath the shadow of thy wing,

Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee!

What thing rejects thy mastery? Who so bold

But at thine altars in the dusk they sue?

Even the straight pale goddess, silver-stoled,

That kissed Endymion when the spring was new,

To thee did homage in her own despite,

When in the shadow of her wings of white

She slid down trembling from her moonÃ¨d ring

To where the Latmian youth lay slumbering,

And in that kiss put off cold chastity.

Who but acclaim with voice and pipe and string,

âThou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee!â
[2]

Master of men and gods, in every fold

Of thy wide vans the sorceries that renew

The labouring earth, tranced with the winterâs cold,

Lie hidâthe quintessential charms that woo

The souls of flowers, slain with the sullen might

Of the dead year, and draw them to the light.

Balsam and blessing to thy garments cling;

Skyward and seaward, whilst thy white palms fling

Their spells of healing over land and sea,

One shout of homage makes the welkin ring,

âThou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee!â

I see thee throned aloft; thy fair hands hold

Myrtles for joy, and euphrasy and rue:

Laurels and roses round thy white brows rolled,

And in thine eyes the royal heavenâs hue:

But in thy lipsâ clear colour, ruddy bright,

The heartâs blood shines of many a hapless wight.

Thou art not only fair and sweet as Spring;

Terror and beauty, fear and wondering

Meet on thy front, amazing all who see:

All men do praise thee, ay, and everything!

Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee!
[3]

I fear thee, though I love. Who can behold

The sheer sun burning in the orbÃ¨d blue,

What while the noontide over hill and wold

Flames like a fire, except his mazÃ¨d view

Wither and tremble? So thy splendid sight

Fills me with mingled gladness and affright.

Thy visage haunts me in the wavering

Of dreams, and in the dawn, awakening,

I feel thy splendour streaming full on me.

Both joy and fear unto thy feet I bring;

Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee!

ENVOY

God above Gods, High and Eternal King,

Whose praise, the symphonies of heaven sing,

I find no whither from thy power to flee,

Save in thy pinionsâ vast oâershadowing:

Thou art my Lord to whom I bend the knee!

John Payne.

CUPID MISTAKEN

A
s after noon, one summerâs day,

Venus stood bathing in a river,

Cupid a-shooting went that way,

New strung his bow, new filled his quiver.

With skill he chose his sharpest dart,

With all his might his bow he drew;

Swift to his beauteous parentâs heart

The too well-guided arrow flew.

âI faint! I die!â the goddess cried;

âO cruel, couldst thou find none other

To wreak thy spleen on? Parricide!

Like Nero, thou hast slain thy mother.â

Poor Cupid sobbing scarce could speak:

âIndeed, mamma, I did not know ye;

Alas! how easy my mistake;

I took you for your likeness, Cloe.â

Matthew Prior.

[5]

CUPID ONCE UPON A BED

C
upid once upon a bed

Of roses laid his weary head;

Luckless urchin not to see

Within the leaves a slumbering bee!

The bee awakedâwith anger wild

The bee awaked and stung the child.

Loud and piteous are his cries;

To Venus quick he runs, he flies!

âO mother! I am wounded throughâ

I die with painâin sooth I do!

Stung by some little angry thing,

Some serpent on a tiny wingâ

A bee it wasâfor once, I know,

I heard a rustic call it so.â

Thus he spoke, and she the while

Heard him with a soothing smile;

Then said, âMy infant, if so much

Thou feel the little wild beeâs touch,

How must the heart, ah, Cupid! beâ

The hapless heart thatâs stung by thee?â

Thomas Moore.
(Odes of Anacreon.)

[6]

CUPIDâS BIRTH

At Cupidâs birth, Joy left the bounds of space,

And, heeding not the stars, flew fast to earth,

To hold the hearts of men in warm embrace,

At Cupidâs birth.

Then Life, with beaming eyes and quickened pace,

And new-found god-like strength, first knew her worth;

While Fate began the future to retrace.

But Death stood gently by with quiet grace,

Aloof from all the tumult and mad mirth,

A sweet, sad smile lit up his steadfast face

At Cupidâs birth.

R. W. Bunny.

[7]

CUPID AT COURT

Young Cupid strung his bow one day,

And sallied out for sport;

As country hearts were easy prey,

Odd Darts! he went to court.

Of all that wore the puff and patch,

Belinda led the fair:

With falbala, and fan to match,

I trow she made him stare!

âOho!â he cried, and quickly drew

His bow upon the sly;â

But though he pierced her bosom through,

She never breathed a sigh!

This was a turn, beyond a doubt,

That filled him with amaze,

And so he sought his mother out,

With tear-bewildered gaze.

âYou silly boy,â Dame Venus said,

âWhy did you waste your art?

Go clip your curls and hide your head,â

Belinda
has
no heart!â

Samuel Minturn Peck.

[8]

CUPID

W
hy was Cupid a boy,

And why a boy was he?

He should have been a girl,

For aught that I can see.

For he shoots with his bow,

And the girl shoots with her eye;

And they both are merry and glad,

And laugh when we do cry.

Then to make Cupid a boy

Was surely a womanâs plan,

For a boy never learns so much

Till he has become a man:

And then heâs so pierced with cares,

And wounded with arrowy smarts,

That the whole business of his life

Is to pick out the heads of the darts.

William Blake.

[9]

[10]

CUPIDâS LOTTERY

A Lottery, a Lottery,

In Cupidâs Court there used to be;

Two roguish eyes

The highest prize

In Cupidâs scheming Lottery;

And kisses, too,

As good as new,

Which werenât very hard to win,

For he who won

The eyes of fun

Was sure to have the kisses in.

A Lottery, a Lottery, etc.

This Lottery, this Lottery

In Cupidâs court went merrily,

And Cupid played

A Jewish trade

In this his scheming Lottery;

For hearts, weâre told,

In
shares
he sold

To many a fond believing drone,

And cut the hearts

In sixteen parts

So well, each thought the whole his own,

A Lottery, a Lottery, etc.

Thomas Moore.

[11]

CUPIDâS CURSE

My love is fair, my love is gay,

As fresh as are the flowers in May;

And of my love the roundelay,

My merry, merry roundelay,

Concludes with Cupidâs curse:

They that do change old love for new,

Pray gods they change for worse!

My love can pipe, my love can sing,

My love can many a pretty thing,

And of his lovely praises ring

My merry, merry roundelays.

Amen to Cupidâs curse!

They that do change old love for new,

Pray gods they change for worse!

George Peele.

[12]

LOVEâS FLITTING

W
hen Love is coming, coming,

Meet him with songs and joy,

Bid him alight and enter,

Flatter and feast the boy;

Crown him with gems and roses,

Charm him with winning wiles,

Bind him with lovely garlands,

And kisses, and smiles.

When Love is going, going,

Leaving you all alone,

Craving, the fickle tyrant,

Some newer slave and throne,

Hinder him not, but quickly,

Even though your heart may bleed,

Saddle a horse for his journey,

And bid him God-speed!

Elizabeth Akers.

[13]

LOVEâS TYRANNY

L
oveâs tyranny now wherefore should I praise,

Not being enamoured of my altered plight!

I often sigh who once sang roundelays;

I know the sleepless gnomes that haunt the night.

I turn with feverish jealousy to hear

Words that were spoken when I was not near.

I shroud my eyes from sights I dare not see,

Yet who so spies must tell his tale to me.

Madman am I, who give my vote for death,

Yet heed not the grim hand that beckoneth.

Love I entreat to go, and while I pray

Grasp him with nervous fingers, lest he stray.

Ah! than loveâs blessing is no deadlier curse,

And yetâand yetâto live undamned were worse.

Percy Hemingway.

[14]

THE TRIUMPH OF CUPID

He came in busy hoursâ

My holidays are fewâ

He brought the scent of flowers,

And whispered, dear, of you.

I vowed that I would flay him,

And scourge him out of sight;

Nay more, I vowed to slay him,

The mischief-making sprite.

I gave him caustic chiding,

Let fly a poisoned dart.

Presto! the lad was hiding

Safely within my heart!

There all day long he chatters

Of some oneâs charm and grace;

Till nothing really matters

Except to see your face.

I would I had not chidden,

Nor tried the sprite to kill;

For in my heart safe hidden,

He works his wayward will.

Geraldine Meyrick.

[15]

SONG TO CUPID

O wary elf Cupid, O dimpled, coy Cupid,

Are you lost in the moonbeams, or hid in a rose?

Who saw you, so nimble, slip out of a thimble,

And hang from the loops of a lily-maidâs bows?

Wee, spry little midget, the worldâs in a fidget

To snare and then coddle you, mischievous sprite;

Your pranks and mad gambols and primrose-path rambles

âMid briers and brambles are all my delight.

In ivy-clad bowers you nestle for hours,

And lurk in the flowers that swing in the breeze;

There counting the kisses, the sweet stolen blisses,

Of Strephon and Phyllis in languorous ease.

We trifle and putter, our hearts in a flutter,

In a tangled skein spun by the toiletted fair,

The weary hours whiling, and dull care beguilingâ

Lo! dimpled and smiling, youâre loitering there!

O wary elf Cupid, O cunning, coy Cupid,

Are lovers all stupid, dear, rollicking boy?

While maidens are sighing and love-knots are tying,

The snap of your bow-string bodes sorrow and joy!

Harold Van Santvoord.

[16]

BANISHED LOVE

O
shepherds! have ye wandering seen

A wingÃ¨d boy with blinded eyes?

I drove him from me yester eâen,

Despite his tears and pleading sighs.

He bears a pretty bow, and keen

Tipped arrows in his quiver lie.

O shepherds, tell me, have you seen

This banished Love come wandering by?

Why shines the sun, regret to mock,

Why flaunt the flowers in hues so gay,

Why skip with joy the snowy flock,

When poor lost Love is far away?

Unfeeling shepherds, wherefore smile

And point toward my breaking heart?

What! close behind me all this while?

O sweet! we two no more shall part.

Virginia B. Harrison.

[17]

TO CUPID FOR PARDON

C
upid, pardon what is past,

And forgive our sins at last!

Then we will be coy no more,

But thy deity adore;

Troths at fifteen we will plight,

And will tread a dance each night,

In the fields, or by the fire,

With the youths that have desire.

Given ear-rings we will wear,

Bracelets of our loversâ hair,

Which they on our arms shall twist,

With their names carved, on our wrist:

All the money that we owe

We in tokens will bestow;

And learn to write that, when âtis sent,

Only our loves know what is meant.

Oh, then pardon what is past,

And forgive our sins at last.

Beaumont and Fletcher.

[18]

LOVEâS HUNTING

Hast thou seen a boy so clever,

Bow in hand, and from his shoulders

Three tipped arrows in a quiver,

With which, piercing all beholders,

He goes up and down forever?

One dart, in the deep eye clinging,

Blinds us ever to his aiming;

One straight at the white throat flinging,

He denies his wrongâs complaining;

One he leaves in the heart stinging.

And the last dart, tipt with scorning,

Quickly kindles a hot passion

Which consumes us with its burning:

Eyeless, tongueless, in such fashion,

Blind and mute, we wander yearning.

James Herbert Morse.

[19]

LOVE GOES A-HAWKING

A ho! A ho!

Loveâs horn doth blow,

And he will out a-hawking go.

His shafts are light as beautyâs sighs,

And bright as midnightâs brightest eyes,

And round his starry way

The swan-wingâd horses of the skies,

With summerâs music in their manes,

Curve their fair necks to zephyrâs reins,

And urge their graceful play.

A ho! A ho!

Loveâs horn doth blow,

And he will out a-hawking go.

The sparrows flutter round his wrist,

The feathery thieves that Venus kist

And taught their morning song,

The linnets seek the airy list,

And swallows too, small pets of Spring,

Bear back the gale with swifter wing,

And dart and wheel along.
[20]

A ho! A ho!

Loveâs horn doth blow,

And he will out a-hawking go.

Now woe to every gnat that skips

To filch the fruit of ladiesâ lips,

His felon blood is shed;

And woe to flies, whose airy ships

On beauty cast their anchoring bite,

And bandit wasp, that naughty wight,

Whose sting is slaughter-red.

Thomas Lovell Beddoes.

LOVEâS BLINDNESS

I have heard of reasons manifold

Why Love must needs be blind,

But this the best of all I holdâ

His eyes are in his mind.

What outward form and feature are

He guesseth but in part;

But that within is good and fair

He seeth with the heart.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

[21]

LOVE ASLEEP

I found Love sleeping in a place of shade,

And as in some sweet dream the sweet lips smiled;

Yea, seemed he as a lovely, sleeping child.

Soft kisses on his full, red lips I laid,

And with red roses did his tresses braid;

Then pure, white lilies on his breast I piled,

And fettered him with woodbine sweet and wild,

And fragrant armlets for his arms I made.

But while I, leaning, yearned across his breast,

Upright he sprang, and from swift hand, alert,

Sent forth a shaft that lodged within my heart.

Ah, had I never played with Love at rest,

He had not wakened, had not cast his dart,

And I had lived who die now of this hurt.

Philip Bourke Marston.

[22]

DAN CUPIDâS TRICK

T
he little boy called Love lay dead,

And on his tiny tomb

Some carven letters sweetly said

That for a day his heart had bled,

And named the maid for whom.

This maid, on coming to the mound,

Felt a remorseful pain,

And kissed his image, clasped it round,

Grew pale, and sank upon the ground,

And shed an April rain.

Then, like a prison-bursting thief,

Outleapt the bounding boy,

Whose stay in HadÃ©s had been briefâ

For hardly had he died of grief

Than he arose for joy.

âWhat means this caper?â cried the maid

As in his arms she sank,

And half delighted, half afraid,

Began most sweetly to upbraid

This most audacious prank.

[23]

âFair maid, your scorn of me,â he said,

âWas all a make-believe,

And put the thought into my head

To play the trick of being dead,

To see how you would grieve.â

She dashed with anger from her eyes

Her all-too-tender tears,â

And greatly to the ladâs surprise,

And heedless of his woeful cries,

She boxed his little ears.

âBack to your tomb and there abide!

And quit it not!â quoth she

(And added, locking him inside),

âI never loved you till you
died

For just your love of
me
.â

Theodore Tilton.

[24]

LOVEâS ARROWS

I saw young Love make trial of his bow,

In Mayâs green garden where he shot his dart,

Nor recked if any nigh beheld his art,

But other eyes did mark him as I know;

For my sweet lady sate anear his throw,

And I with her, and joinÃ¨d heart to heart,

So that we might not feel the bitter smart

Love leaveth there when time doth force to go.

We heard Loveâs arrows falling in the grass,

Or watched them quiver in the targe below;

Yet few to us came nigh, nor might they pass

Beyond our feet, which trembled when they came,

Whose hearts were not the quarry for his aim,

That in Loveâs chase fell stricken long ago.

Walter Crane.

[25]

LOVE, THE GUEST

I did not dream that Love would stay,

I deemed him but a passing guest,

Yet here he lingers many a day.

I said, âYoung Love will flee with May,

And leave forlorn the hearth he blestâ;

I did not dream that Love would stay.

My envious neighbor mocks me âNay,

Love lies not long in any nestâ;

Yet here he lingers many a day.

And though I did his will alway,

And gave him even of my best;

I did not dream that Love would stay.

I have no skill to bid him stay,

Of tripping tongue or cunning jest,

Yet here he lingers many a day.

Beneath his ivory feet I lay

Pale plumage of the ringdoveâs breast;

I did not dream that Love would stay.

Will Love be flown? I ofttimes say,

Home turning for the noonday rest;

Yet here he lingers many a day.
[26]

His gold curls gleam, his lips are gay,

His eyes through tears smile loveliest;

I did not dream that love would stay.

He sometimes sighs when far away

The low red sun makes fair the west,

Yet here he lingers many a day.

Thrice blest of all men am I! yea,

Although of all unworthiest;

I did not dream that Love would stay,

Yet here he lingers many a day.

Graham R. Tomson.

CUPID

Selfish rogue, did Psyche dream,

When her lamp she held above him,

How the oil would downward stream,

Wake the rogue and make her love him?

Mary Chace Peckham.

[27]

FOR CUPID DEAD

When Love is dead, what more but funeral ritesâ

To lay his sweet corse lovingly to rest,

To cover him with rose and eglantine,

And all fair posies that he loved the best?

What more, but kisses for his close-shut eyesâ

His cold, still lips that never more will speakâ

His hair, too bright for dust of death to dimâ

The flush scarce faded from his frozen cheek?

What more but tears that will not warm his brow,

Although they burn the eyes from which they start?â

No bitter weeping or more bitter words

Can rouse to one more throb that pulseless heart.

So dead he is, who once was so alive!

In summer, when the ardent days were long,

He was as warm as June, as gay and glad

As any bird that swelled its throat with song.

So dead!âyet all things were his ministersâ

All birds and blossoms, and the joyous June!

Would they had died, and kept sweet Love alive;

Since he is gone the world is out of tune.

Louise Chandler Moulton.

[28]

AT THE SIGN OF THE BLIND CUPID

W
hen blushing cheeks and downcast eyes

Set all the heart aflame,

When love within a dimple lies

And constancyâs a name,

Since every lass is passing fair,

Cupid must fly and see;

And, lightly flitting here and there,

A wingÃ¨d boy is he.

When creeping years steal on apace

And youth and vigor go,

When time with wrinkles marks the face

And strews the hair with snow,

Ah, then no wingÃ¨d boy is he;

But strong-limbed and complete,

With blinded eyes that need not see,

Since memory guides his feet.

Walter Learned.

[29]

[30]

CUPIDâS ARROW

Young Cupid went storming to Vulcan one day,

And besought him to look at his arrow.

ââTis useless!â he cried, âyou must mend it, I say,

âTisnât fit to let fly at a sparrow.

Thereâs something thatâs wrong in the shaft, or the dart,

For it flutters quite false to my aim,

âTis an age since it fairly went home to a heart,

And the world really jests at my name.

âI have straightened, Iâve bent, Iâve tried all, I declare,

Iâve perfumed it with sweetest of sighs;

âTis feathered with ringlets my mother might wear,

And the barb gleams with light from young eyes;

But it falls without touchingâIâll break it, I vow,

For thereâs Hymen beginning to pout,

Heâs complaining his torch beamâs so dull and so low,

That Zephyr might puff it right out.â

Little Cupid went on with his pitiful tale,

Till Vulcan the weapon restored.

âThere, take it, young sir, try it now. If it fail,

I will ask neither fee nor reward!â

The urchin shot out, and rare havoc he made,

The wounded and dead were untold,

But no wonder the rogue had such slaughtering trade,

For the arrow was laden with gold.

Eliza Cook.

[31]

CUPID PLAGUE THEE FOR THY TREASON

Now I see thy looks were feigned,

Quickly lost, and quickly gained;

Soft thy skin, like wool of wethers,

Heart inconstant, light as feathers,

Tongue untrusty, subtle-sighted,

Wanton will with change delighted.

Siren, pleasant foe to reason,

Cupid plague thee for thy treason!

Of thine eye I made my mirror,

From thy beauty came my error,

All thy words I counted witty,

All thy sighs I deemed pity,

Thy false tears that me aggrieved,

First of all my trust deceived.

Siren, pleasant foe to reason,

Cupid plague thee for thy treason!

Feigned acceptance when I asked,

Lovely words with cunning masked,

Holy vows, but heart unholy;

Wretched man, my trust was folly;

Lily white, and pretty winking,

Solemn vows but sorry thinking.

Siren, pleasant foe to reason,

Cupid plague thee for thy treason!
[32]

Now I see, O seemly cruel,

Others warm them at my fuel,

Wit shall guide me in this durance

Since in love is no assurance:

Change thy pasture, take thy pleasure,

Beauty is a fading treasure.

Siren, pleasant foe to reason,

Cupid plague thee for thy treason!

Prime youth lasts not, age will follow

And make white those tresses yellow,

Wrinkled face, for looks delightful,

Shall acquaint the dame despiteful.

And when time shall date thy glory,

Then too late thou wilt be sorry.

Siren, pleasant foe to reason,

Cupid plague thee for thy treason!

Thomas Lodge.

YOUNG LOVEâS A GALLANT BOY

When Love came first to earth, the Spring

Spread rose-beds to receive him,

And back he vowed his flight heâd wing

To Heaven, if she should leave him.

But Spring departing, saw his faith

Pledged to the next new-comerâ

He revelled in the warmer breath

And richer bowers of Summer.

Then sportive Autumn claimed by rights

An Archer for her lover,

And even in Winterâs dark cold nights

A charm he could discover.

Her routs and balls, and fireside joy,

For this time were his reasonsâ

In short, Young Loveâs a gallant boy,

That likes all times and seasons.

Thomas Campbell.

VENUSâ RUNAWAY

B
eauties, have ye seen this toy,

Called Love, a little boy,

Almost naked, wanton, blind;

Cruel now, and then as kind?

If he be amongst ye, say?

He is Venusâ runaway.

He hath marks about him plenty:

You shall know him among twenty.

All his body is a fire,

And his breath a flame entire,

That, being shot like lightning in,

Wounds the heart, but not the skin.

At his sight the sun hath turned,

Neptune in the waters burned;

Hell hath felt a greater heat;

Jove himself forsook his seat.

From the center to the sky

Are his trophies rearÃ¨d high.

[35]

Trust him not; his words, though sweet,

Seldom with his heart do meet.

All his practice is deceit;

Every gift it is a bait;

Not a kiss but poison bears;

And most treason in his tears.

Idle minutes are his reign;

Then the straggler makes his gain

By presenting maids with toys,

And would have ye think them joys;

âTis the ambition of the elf

To have all childish as himself.

If by these ye please to know him,

Beauties, be not nice, but show him,

Though ye had a will to hide him,

Now, we hope, yeâll not abide him;

Since you hear his falser play,

And that heâs Venusâ runaway.

Ben Jonson.

[36]

BEWARE THE ROGUE

Deep in the shadow of her hazel eyes,

Waiting to capture men, Love lurking lies.

Her glances are the arrows of his bow,

Wherewith he lays unwary victims low;

And she, unused to Cupidâs artful wiles,

Unconscious aids his purpose by her smiles,

And knows not, as her smiles and glances dart,

What anguish these may bring to many a heart.

Ah! hapless maiden, innocently gay,

No presage of the future breeds dismay;

She does not know how soon the treacherous guest

Will make her heart the haven of unrest.

Ungrateful Cupid! Soon from her heâll fly,

And seek a refuge in some loverâs eye,

Then from that point of vantage aim a dart

To pierce and agonize her maiden heart.

Thomas Dunn English.

[37]

THE FAIR THIEF

Before the urchin well could go

She stole the whiteness of the snow,

And more that whiteness to adorn

She stole the blushes of the morn;

Stole all the sweets that either sheds

On primrose buds or violet beds.

Still, to reveal her artful wiles,

She stole the Gracesâ silken smiles:

She stole Auroraâs balmy breath,

And pilfered orient pearl for teeth:

The cherry, dipt in morning dew,

Gave moisture to her lips and hue.

These were her infant spoils, a store

To which in time she added more:

At twelve she stole from Cyprusâ queen

Her air and love-commanding mien;

Stole Junoâs dignity, and stole

From Pallas sense to charm the soul.

Apolloâs wit was next her prey;

Her next, the beam that lights the day.

She sung: amazed the Sirens heard,

And to assert their voice appeared:

She played: the Muses from the hill

Wondered who thus had stolân their skill.
[38]

Great Jove approved her crimes and art;

And tâother day she stole my heart!

If lovers, Cupid, are thy care,

Exert thy vengeance on this Fair;

To trial bring her stolen charms,

And let her prison be my arms.

Charles Wyndham.

[39]

LOVE AND THE WITCHES

It was a little, fearful maid,

Whose mother left her all alone;

Her door with iron bolt she stayed,

And âgainst it rolled a lucky stoneâ

For many a night sheâd waked with fright when witches by the house had flown.

To piping lute in still midnight,

Who comes a-singing at the door,â

That showeth seams of golden light,â

âAh, open, darling, I imploreâ?

She could not help knowing âtwas Love, although theyâd never met before.

She swiftly shot the iron bar,

And rolled the lucky stone away,

And careful set the door ajarâ

âNow enter in, Sir Love, I pray;

My mother knows it not, but I have watched for you this many a day.â

With fan and roar of gloomy wings

They gave the door a windy shove;

They perched on chairs and brooms and things;

Like bats they beat around aboveâ

Poor little maid, sheâd let the witches in with Love.

Mary E. Wilkins.

[40]

LOVE AND DREAM

Cupid, wandering one May-day,

Met with loitering Death by chance;

No aged carl as many say,

But young as he, as fair and gay,

As fond of boyish sport or dance.

âCome, wrestle,â and, so saying, Love,

Loosâning the quiver at his breast,

Hung it upon the bough above.

âThese arrows,â quoth he, âwhen they rove,

Make youth a slave at my behest.â

Among the tender-blooming leaves

Death made
his
quiver sure and fast,

â
My
arrows bring rest when age grieves,â

And down unwary Love he heaves;

So frolicked they till Discord passed.

She, wicked, hating merry play,

Scattered their arrows on the green,

And thus confused, some got astray

In either quiver. Since that day

Youth dies and old age dotes, I ween.

Anna Vernon Dorsey.

[41]

CUPID LAID BY HIS BRAND

Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:

A maid of Dianâs this advantage found,

And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep

In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;

Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love

A dateless lively heat, still to endure,

And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove

Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.

But at my mistressâ eye Loveâs brand new-fired,

The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;

I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,

And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,

But found no cure; the bath for my help lies

Where Cupid got new fireâmy mistressâ eyes.

William Shakespeare.

[42]

A MADRIGAL

B
efore me careless lying,

Young Love his ware comes crying;

Full soon the elf untreasures

His pack of pains and pleasures,â

With roguish eye

He bids me buy

From out his pack of treasures.

His walletâs stuffed with blisses,

With true-love-knots and kisses,

With rings and rosy fetters,

And sugared vows and letters;â

He holds them out

With boyish flout,

And bids me try the fetters.

[43]

Nay, Child (I cry), I know them;

Thereâs little need to show them!

Too well for new believing

I know their past deceiving,â

I am too old

(I say), and cold,

To-day, for new believing!

But still the wanton presses,

With honey-sweet caresses,

And still, to my undoing,

He wins me, with his wooing,

To buy his wares

With all their cares,

Their sorrow and undoing!

Austin Dobson.

[44]

LOVEâS REWARD

For Love I labored all the day,

Through morning chill and midday heat.

For surely with the evening gray,

I thought, Loveâs guerdon shall be sweet.

At eventide, with weary limb,

I brought my labors to the spot

Where Love had bid me come to him;

Thither I came, but found him not.

For he with idle folk had gone

To dance the hours of night away;

And I that toiled was left alone,

Too weary now to dance or play.

Francis W. Bourdillon.

[45]

THE LOVE THAT IS REQUITED WITH DISDAIN

In search of things that secret are my mated muse began,

What it might be molested most the head and mind of man;

The bending brow of princeâs face, to wrath that doth attend,

Or want of parents, wife, or child, or loss of faithful friend;

The roaring of the cannon shot, that makes the piece to shake,

Or terror, such as mighty Jove from heaven above can make:

All these in fine, may not compare, experience so doth prove,

Unto the torments, sharp and strange, of such as be in love.

Love looks aloft, and laughs to scorn all such as griefs annoy,

The more extreme their passions be, the greater is his joy,

Thus Love, as victor of the field, triumphs above the rest,

And joys to see his subjects lie with living death in breast;

But dire Disdain lets drive a shaft, and galls this bragging fool,

He plucks his plumes, unbends his bow, and sets him new to school;
[46]

Whereby this boy that bragged late, as conqueror over all,

Now yields himself unto Disdain, his vassal and his thrall.

William Hunnis.

CUPID RELIEVED

As once young Cupid went astray,

The little god I found;

I took his bow and shafts away,

And fast his pinions bound.

At Chloeâs feet my spoils I cast,

My conquest proud to shew;

She saw his godship fettered fast

And smiled to see him so.

But ah! that smile such fresh supplies

Of arms resistless gave!

Iâm forced again to yield my prize,

And fall again his slave.

Soame Jenyns.

[47]

LOVE BANISHED HEAVEN

Love banished heaven, in earth was held in scorn,

Wandâring abroad in need and beggary;

And wanting friends, though of a goddess born,

Yet craved the alms of such as passÃ¨d by:

I, like a man devout and charitable,

Clothed the naked, lodged this wandâring guest,

With sighs and tears still furnishing his table,

With what might make the miserable blest;

But this ungrateful, for my good desert,

Enticed my thoughts against me to conspire,

Who gave consent to steal away my heart,

And set my breast his lodging on a fire.

Well, well, my friends, when beggars grow thus bold,

No marvel then though charity grow cold.

Michael Drayton.

[48]

THE BEGGING CUPID

A piece of Sculpture

I
watched as they stood before it,â

A girl with a face as fair

As any among the marbles,

So cold in their whiteness there;

And a youth in whose glance, entreaty

Each lineament seemed to stir,

She only had eyes for the sculpture;

He only had eyes for her.

And poising in critic-fashion

The delicate upturned head,

âWas ever so sweet a beggar?â

With sudden appeal, she said.

âJust look at the innocent archness,

The simple and childish grace,

Half mirthful and half pathetic,

That dimples his pleading face.

[49]

âWhoever could think that mischief

Was hidden in such a guise?

Or even that rosy sorrows

Lurk in those lambent eyes?

â
Deny him?
Perhaps! though never

With hardness or scorn or blame;

For I think I should sob with pity,

If that were the way he came.â

She turned as she spoke: the glamour

Of feeling had made her blind

To the trick of the stealthy arrow

The Cupid concealed behind:

âAh, ha!â she cried, while the color

Rubied her neck of snowâ

âYou plausible, wheedling beggar!

I have nothing to give you,âGo!â

Margaret J. Preston.

[50]

LOVE! IF A GOD THOU ART

Love! if a god thou art,

Then evermore thou must

Be merciful and just;

If thou be just, O wherefore doth thy dart

Wound mine alone, and not my ladyâs heart?

If merciful, then why

Am I to pain reserved,

Who have thee truly served,

While she, that by thy power fits not afly,

Laughs thee to scorn, and lives at liberty?

Then, if a god thou wilt accounted be,

Heal me like her, or else wound her like me.

Francis Davison.

[51]

LOVEâS GOING

Love lies a-sleeping; maiden, softly sing,

Lest he should waken; pluck the falling rose

A-brushing âgainst his cheek, her glowing heart

Opeâd to the sunâs hot kissesâfoolish thing,

To list the tale oft told!âbut summer goes,

And all the rosesâ petals fall apart.

Love lies a-sleeping; let the curtains part

So that the breeze may lightly to him sing

A lullabyâthe changeful breeze that goes

A-whispering through the grass, whereâer it rose,

Whereâer it listeth bound, a wilful thing,

Low murmuring sweets from an inconstant heart.

Love lies a-sleeping: press the pulsing heart

That beats against thy bosom: stand apart

And stay thine eager breath, lest anything

Should mar his restâthe songs that lovers sing,

The tale the butterfly tells to the rose,

The low wind to the grass, and onward goes.

Love lies a-sleeping: ah, how swiftly goes

The sweet delusion he hath taught thy heart,

Fair maiden, pressing to thy breast the rose,

Whose fun-kissed petals sadly fall apart,

With thy quick breath! Thy rhyme wouldst hear him sing

Which yesterday seemed such a foolish thing?
[52]

Love lies a-sleeping: nay, for such a thing

Break not his slumber. See how sweetly goes

That smile across his lips, that will not sing

For very wilfulness. Love hath no heart!

If he should wake, these red-ripe lips would part

In laughter low to see this ravished rose.

Love lies a-sleeping: so the full-blown rose

Falls to the earth a dead unpitied thing;

The grasses âneath the breeze deep-sighing part

And sway; and as thy warm breath comes and goes

In motion with the red tides of thy heart,

The song is hushed which Love was wont to sing.

Love lies a-sleeping: thus in dreams he goes;

Strive not to waken him, but tell thy heart.

âLove lies a-sleeping, and he may not sing.â

Charles W. Coleman, Jun.

[53]

CUPIDâS ARROWS

PhÅbe, wandering in a wood,

Chanced to spy Dan Cupid sleeping;

Long the curious maiden stood

Tiptoe, through the branches peeping.

For the youngsterâs lips she yearned,

Till, the branches parting slyly,

She to slake her thirst that burned

Stooped and kissed the rogueâs mouth shyly.

Now the boyâs eyes open wide,

And upon the maid he gazes,

Grasps an arrow at his side,

And his silver bow upraises.

Swift the maiden turns to flee;

Swift the arrow follows after,

Wounding in its flight a tree:

Hark! how rings the maidâs clear laughter.

Cupid, with sleep-dazzled eyes,

Stares a moment through the bushes

Where the laughing maid still flies,

Then adown the wood he rushes.

Now the shaft oâertakes the quarry,

Now it cleaves poor PhÅbeâs heartâ

Maidens, ere you wake Love, tarry

First to filch his every dart.

James B. Kenyon.

[54]

THE GROWTH OF LOVE

A
h, Chloris! that I now could sit

As unconcerned, as when

Your infant beauty could beget

No pleasure nor no pain.

When I the dawn used to admire,

And praised the coming day,

I little thought the growing fire

Must take my rest away.

Your charms in harmless childhood lay,

Like metals in the mine:

Age from no face took more away,

Than youth concealed in thine.

But as your charms insensibly

To their perfection pressed,

Fond love as unperceived did fly,

And in my bosom rest.

[55]

My passion with your beauty grew,

And Cupid at my heart,

Still, as his mother favored you,

Threw a new flaming dart.

Each gloried in their wanton part:

To make a lover, he

Employed the utmost of his artâ

To make a beauty, she.

Though now I slowly bend to love,

Uncertain of my fate,

If your fair self my chains approve,

I shall my freedom hate.

Lovers, like dying men, may well

At first disordered be;

Since none alive can truly tell

What fortune they must see.

Sir Charles Sedley.

[56]

LOVEâS QUALITIES

Is Love a boyâwhat means he then to strike?

Or is he blind,âwhy will he be a guide?

Is he a man,âwhy doth he hurt his like?

Is he a god,âwhy doth he men deride?

No one of these, but one compact of all:

A wilful boy, a man still dealing blows,

Of purpose blind to lead men to their thrall:

A god that rules unrulyâGod, he knows.

Boy! pity me that am a child again;

Blind, be no more my guide to make me stray:

Man! use thy might to force away my pain;

God! do me good and lead me to my way;

And if thou beest a power to me unknown,

Power of my life! let here thy grace be shown.

Byrdâs Set Songs.

[57]

BALLADE OF THE ROSE

Tell me, red rose, what you were bidâ

You know her secret; you she wore

Shy, nestling in her hair, half hid

By jealous golden curls a score,

As waves half timid kiss the shore,

Then tremble were they bold or no;

I kiss you, blushing token, for

She loves meârose, you tell me so.

I softly raise your scented lid,

Where, sleeping since some dawn of yore,

A crystal dewdrop lies amid

The downy crimson of your core.

I am not versed in Cupidâs lore;

But so I think her blushing glow

Soft guards the love I sue her for.

She loves meârose, you tell me so.

And when her hand, in dainty kid,

Gave you to me, as nâer before

It fluttered, tried itself to rid

Of fetters that it never wore,

Why trembled she? My eyes would pour

My love in hersâwhy did she so?

Was it because she hates me, orâ

She loves meârose, you tell me so.
[58]

LâENVOY

Rose, come you not ambassador

From Cupidâs court to let me know

Love yields at last? Speak, I implore!

She loves meârose, you tell me so.

H. C. Faulkner.

AN AWAKENING

Love had forgotten and gone to sleep;

Love had forgotten the present and past.

I was so glad when he ceased to weep;

âNow he is quiet,â I whispered, âat last.â

What sent you here on that night of all nights,

Breaking his slumber, dreamless and deep,

Just as I whispered below my breath,

âLove has forgotten and gone to sleepâ?

Anne Reeve Aldrich.

[59]

LOVE AND A COMPASS

To the north of her mouth, east and west of her eyes,

By the curls of her tresses half hidden,

Two ears, of the tiniest, daintiest size,

Are kissed by the breezes unbidden.

And right to the north of each exquisite cheek

Lie her eyes, of a brilliancy tender.

Their color I know not, but in them I seek

Some sign of approaching surrender.

Due north of the dimple that hides in her chin,

Two lips conceal music behind them;

And when a smile plays on them, Cupids begin

To break from the bonds that confine them.

Just south of her chin stands a full-rounded throat,

Whose whiteness than marble is whiter;

Southeast and southwest of it, shoulders I noteâ

No curves are more graceful, or lighter.

In the south of her bosom, a bit to the west,

Is the greatest of all of her beauties:

My loadstarâs the heart that is hid in her breast;

To obey itâs my sweetest of duties.

S. D. Smith, Jr.

[60]

LOVE IS DEAD

R
ing out your bells! let mourning shows be spread!

For Love is dead.

All love is dead, infected

With plague of deep disdain:

Worth, as naught worth, rejected,

And faith fair scorn doth gain.

From so ungrateful fancy,

From such a female phrenzy,

From them that use men thus,

Good Lord! deliver us.

Weep, neighbours! weep: do you not hear it said

That Love is dead?

His death-bed peacockâs folly,

His winding-sheet is shame,

His will false seeming holy,

His sole executor blame.

From so ungrateful fancy,

From such a female phrenzy,

From them that use men thus,

Good Lord! deliver us.

[61]

Let dirge be sung, and trentals rightly read!

For Love is dead.

Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth,

My Mistressâ marble heart;

Which epitaph containethâ

âHer eyes were once his dart.â

From so ungrateful fancy,

From such a female phrenzy,

From them that use men thus,

Good Lord! deliver us.

Alas! I lie: rage hath this error bred:

Love is not dead.

Love is not dead, but sleepeth

In her unmatched mind,

Where she his counsel keepeth

Till due deserts she find.

Therefore from so vile fancy,

To call such wit a phrenzy

Who love can temper thus,

Good Lord! deliver us.

Sir Philip Sidney

[62]

WILY CUPID

Trust not his wanton tears,

Lest they beguile ye;

Trust not his childish sigh,

He breatheth slily.

Trust not his touch,

His feeling may defile ye;

Trust nothing that he doth,

The wag is wily.

If you suffer him to prate,

You will rue it over-late.

Beware of him, for he is witty:

Quickly strive the boy to bind,

Fear him not, for he is blind,

If he get loose, he shows no pity.

Henry Chettle.

[63]

THE BURIAL OF LOVE

Maidenâs hearts are always soft;

Would that menâs were truer!

Song.

Two dark-eyed maids, at shut of day,

Sat where a river rolled away,

With calm, sad brows and raven hair,

And one was pale and both were fair.

Bring flowers, they sang, bring flowers unblown,

Bring forest-blooms of name unknown;

Bring budding sprays from wood and wild,

To strew the bier of Love, the child.

Close softly, fondly, while ye weep,

His eyes, that death may seem like sleep,

And fold his hands in sign of rest,

His waxen hands, across his breast.

And make his grave where violets hide,

Where star-flowers strew the rivuletâs side,

And bluebirds in the misty spring

Of cloudless skies and summer sing.

Place near him, as ye lay him low,

His idle shafts, his loosened bow,

The silken fillet that around

His waggish eyes in sport he wound.
[64]

But we shall mourn him long, and miss

His ready smile, his ready kiss,

The patter of his little feet,

Sweet frowns and stammered phrases sweet;

And graver looks, serene and high,

A light of heaven in that young eye,

All these shall haunt us till the heart

Shall ache and acheâand tears will start.

The bow, the band shall fall to dust,

The mining arrows waste with rust,

And all of Love that earth can claim

Be but a memory and a name.

Not thus his nobler part shall dwell

A prisoner in this narrow cell;

But he whom now we hide from men

In the dark ground, shall live again:

Shall break these clods, a form of light,

With nobler mien and purer sight,

And in the eternal glory stand,

Highest and nearest Godâs right hand.

William Cullen Bryant.

[65]

CUPID SWALLOWED

Tâother day, as I was twining

Roses, for a crown to dine in,

What, of all things, midst the heap,

Should I light on, fast asleep,

But the little desperate elf,

The tiny traitorâLove himself!

By the wings I pinchâd him up

Like a bee, and in a cup

Of my wine I plunged and sank him;

And what dâye think I did?âI drank him!

Faith! I thought him dead. Not he!

There he lives with tenfold glee;

And now this moment, with his wings

I feel him tickling my heart-strings.

Leigh Hunt.

[66]

THE FILLET

L
ove has a fillet on his eyes;

He sees not with the eyes of men;

Whom his fine issues touch despise

The censures of indifferent men.

There is in love an inward sight,

That nor in wit nor wisdom lies;

He walks in everlasting light,

Despite the fillet on his eyes.

If I love you, and you love me,

âTis for substantial reasons, sweetâ

For something other than we see,

That satisfies, though incomplete;

Or, if not satisfies, is yet

Not mutable, where so much dies:

Who love, as we, do not regret

There is a fillet on Loveâs eyes!

Richard Henry Stoddard.

[67]

[68]

THE ARCHERY MATCH

She fits the arrow to its place,

She bends the bow with skill and grace,

The feathered shaft lets fly;

A look of triumph lights her faceâ

The scoreâs a tie!

Dan Cupid, whoâs a bowman true,

Then boldly tries what he can do

To bind the tie foreâer;

Result: the world declares the two

A well-matched pair!

Arthur Grissom.

[69]

THE BURIAL OF LOVE

His eyes in eclipse,

Pale-cold his lips,

The light of his hopes unfed,

Mute his tongue,

His bow unstrung

With the tears he hath shed,

Backward drooping his graceful head,

Love is dead:

His last arrow is sped;

He hath not another dart;

Goâcarry him to his dark deathbed;

Bury him in the cold, cold heartâ

Love is dead.

Oh, truest Love! art thou forlorn,

And unrevenged? thy pleasant wiles

Forgotten, and thine innocent joy?

Shall hollow-hearted Apathy,

The cruellest form of perfect scorn

With languor of most hateful smiles,

Forever write,

In the withered light

Of the tearless eye,

An epitaph that all may spy?

No! sooner she herself shall die.
[70]

For her the showers shall not fall

Nor the round sun shine that shineth to all;

Her light shall into darkness change;

For her the green grass shall not spring,

Nor the rivers flow, nor the sweet birds sing,

Till Love have his full revenge.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

SONG

Ladies, though to your conquering eyes

Love owes his chiefest victories,

And borrows those bright arms from you

With which he does the world subdue;

Yet you yourselves are not above

The empire nor the griefs of love.

Then rack not lovers with disdain,

Lest love on you revenge their pain;

You are not free because youâre fair,

The boy did not his mother spare:

Though beauty be a killing dart,

It is no armour for the heart.

Sir George Etherege.

[71]

LOVE AND MISCHIEF

One sunny day Love chose to stray

Adown a rosy path forbidden,

Where Mischief deep in ambush lay,

And watched his snare âneath flowers hidden:

Love tumbling in, began to shout

For Mischiefâs aid, lest he should smother:

âYou little demon, let me out,

Or Iâll report you to my mother.â

Said Mischief, âIâll not set you free

Unless you share your power with me,

And give of every heart you gain,

One-half to joy and half to pain.â

Love struggled, but in vain, alas!

He was not born to prove a martyr,

And, sad to tell! it came to pass

He gave in to the little Tartar.

Love flew to Venus in a pet,

And cried, when he had told his story:

âO, Queen of Beauty, never let

That little imp wear half my glory.â

The goddess with a look sedate,

Replied, âI cannot alter fate,

But you shall conquer still, my boy,

Iâll make loveâs pain more sweet than joy.â

Zavarr Wilmshurst.

[72]

DAMON AND CUPID

T
he sun was now withdrawn,

The shepherds home were sped;

The moon wide oâer the lawn

Her silver mantle spread;

When Damon stayed behind,

And sauntered in the grove:

âWill neâer a nymph be kind,

And give me love for love?

âO! those were golden hours,

When Love, devoid of cares,

In all Arcadiaâs bowers

Lodged nymphs and swains by pairs;

But now from wood and plain

Flies every sprightly lass;

No joys for me remain,

In shades, or on the grass.â

[73]

The wingÃ¨d boy draws near,

And thus the swain reproves:

âWhile Beauty revelled here,

My game lay in the groves;

At court I never fail

To scatter round my arrows:

Men fall as thick as hail,

And maidens love like sparrows.

âThen, swain, if me you need,

Straight lay your sheep-hook down;

Throw by your oaten reed,

And haste away to town.

So well Iâm known at court,

None ask where Cupid dwells:

But readily resort

To Bellendens or Lepels.â

John Gay.

[74]

CUPID AND CAMPASPE

Cupid and my Campaspe played

At cards for kisses; Cupid paid.

He stakes his quiver, bow and arrows,

His motherâs doves and team of sparrows;

Loses them, too; then down he throws

The coral of his lip, the rose

Growing on âs cheek, but none knows how;

With these the crystal of his brow,

And then the dimple of his chinâ

All these did my Campaspe win.

At last he set her both his eyes;

She won, and Cupid blind did rise.

O Love! has she done this to thee?

What shall, alas, become of me!

John Lyly.

[75]

LOVE FOR LOVE

Away with these self-loving lads

Whom Cupidâs arrow never glads!

Away poor souls that sigh and weep,

In love of those that lie asleep!

For Cupid is a meadow god,

And forceth none to kiss the rod.

Sweet Cupidâs shafts, like destiny,

Do causeless good or ill decree;

Desert is borne out of his bow,

Reward upon his wing doth go!

What fools are they that have not known

That Love likes no laws but his own.

My songs they be of Cynthiaâs praise,

I wear her rings on holy-days,

In every tree I write her name,

And every day I read the same.

Where Honour Cupidâs rival is,

There miracles are seen of his.

If Cynthia crave her ring of me,

I blot her name out of the tree;

If doubt do darken things held dear,

Then well-fare nothing, once a year;

For many run, but one must win,

Fools only hedge the cuckoo in.
[76]

The worth that worthiness should move,

Is Love, that is the bow of Love;

And love as well the foster can,

As can the mighty noble-man:â

Sweet saint, âtis true, you worthy be,

Yet, without love, nought worth to me.

Fulke Greville.

A KISS

You ask me whatâs a kiss?

âTis Cupidâs keenest arrow!

A thing to take a âmissââ

(You ask me whatâs a kiss?)

The brink of an abyss!

A loverâs pathway, narrow.

You ask me whatâs a
kiss
?

âTis Cupidâs
keenest
arrow!

Charles Henry LÃ¼ders.

[77]

THE DILEMMA

Now, by the blessed Paphian queen,

Who heaves the breast of sweet sixteen;

By every name I cut on bark

Before my morning star grew dark;

By Hymenâs torch, by Cupidâs dart,

By all that thrills the beating heart;

The bright black eye, the melting blueâ

I cannot choose between the two.

I had a vision in my dreams;â

I saw a row of twenty beams;

From every beam a rope was hung,

In every rope a lover swung;

I asked the hue of every eye

That bade each luckless lover die;

Ten shadowy lips said heavenly blue,

And ten accused the darker hue.

I asked a matron which she deemed

With fairest light of beauty beamed;

She answered, some thought both were fairâ

Give her blue eyes and golden hair.

I might have liked her judgment well,

But, as she spoke, she rung the bell,

And all her girls, nor small nor few,

Came marching inâtheir eyes were blue.
[78]

I asked a maiden; back she flung

The locks that round her forehead hung,

And turned her eye, a glorious one,

Bright as a diamond in the sun,

On me, until beneath its rays

I felt as if my hair would blaze;

She liked all eyes but eyes of green;

She looked at me, what could she mean?

Ah! many lids Love lurks between,

Nor heeds the coloring of his screen;

And when his random arrows fly,

The victim falls, but knows not why.

Gaze not upon his shield of jet,

The shaft upon the firing is set;

Look not beneath his azure veil,

Though every limb was cased in mail.

Well both might make a martyr break

The chain that bound him to the stake;

And both with but a single ray

Can melt our very hearts away;

And both, when balanced, hardly seem

To stir the scales, or rock the beam;

But that is dearest, all the while,

That wears for us the sweetest smile.

Oliver Wendell Holmes.

[79]

LOVE PENITENT

Paint me, Love, not, as of old,

Like a reveler overboldâ

Roses dropping from his hair,

Wings that rise from either shoulder

Like a flame and fan the airâ

Love is sadder grown and older,

Plays no more with bow and arrows,

Scarce has heart to feed his sparrows.

Paint him like a penitent,

Wan with keeping year-long Lent,

Worn with watching, faint with prayer,

Dust, not roses, in his hair.

Give him, for his bow and quiver,

At his belt a pair of beads;

If the cold air make him shiver,

Give him sackcloth for his needs.

Lingering farewells, merry meetings,

Stolen looks and fancy greetings,

Dance and song and revel gay,

He must put them all away.

Bid him with his naked feet

Trample out his torchâs flame,

Turn from wine and dainty meat,

All his wandering fancies tame:

Only, lest we quite forget himâ

We that used to spoil and pet himâ

Grant him through his penance sad

But one gift his childhood hadâ

Neither torch nor shaft nor bow,

But the smile we used to know.

Henry Johnstone.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

TUNISIAN DAYS

I

I WAS fortunate in my first landfall at Tunis.
It was a fine sea picture framed in that chill November dawn. On my
left, over the rippling watery gold to the few pink clouds
eastward, lay the great blue mountain headland, stretching far
behind. In front, a little to the right, was Goletta, the port,
hard by; and ranging off northward the line of the ocean beach ran
stern and solemn, with the lighthouse above. That rise, there, was
the hill of Carthage. Westward over the hollow space of waters
swept the crescent horizon inland, low and misty, centred a little
to the south by the obscure white of far Tunis. Carthage is the
first thought of the traveller; his instant memory is of Phoenician
ships, and his imagination is of Scipio and Regulusâthese are the
sights they saw.

The steamer plied up the long canal that makes the shallow,
broad lake navigable to the docks some miles beyond; flamingoes
flew to the right and left over the level lapping waters, fresh in
the raw, damp, almost rainy air; and gradually Tunis drew in sight,
like a great white flower on the bosom of the sloping uplands,
strange, solitary, unexpected, with minarets and the island look of
a Moslem city.

II

Barren
enough was my first acquaintance
with the land side, weary, cheerless, desolate, like windy prairies
in autumn, uninhabited, uninhabitable; and I was chilled to the
bone when I came back to the hotel, then in the bud of its first
season. It is more sober now, but then it had a near cousinship to
Monte Carlo; it was delightfully irresponsible, vivacious, gay. One
passed to the picturesque bar and the cafÃ©, thick with interesting
groups; or with equal ease to the âlittle horsesâ with their
ever-dissolving banks of faces, a covey of all nations, round the
bell-timed play, and to the vaudeville stage with gymnasts, French
acting, fat Jewess dancers, and a world lightly enjoying itself, as
it looked from railed low boxes on the spacious floorâmen, women,
children, with tables, glasses, straws, and bright-colored things
to drink, waiters, musiciansâalways a pretty scene, with incidents,
and rich in human relations; or one went more gravely by a stairway
to the privacy of baccarat in its upper seclusion of the visiting
card. It was a pleasant and polite place wherever one might stroll
about, and in every corridor and at all hours the grand toilette of
capitals, men and womenâeven adventurersâof the world. The old
beylic of Tunis seemed far away; at least, one was still in
Christendom.

I stepped out on the sidewalk after dinner, on a broad avenue
with trees. At the brilliant crossing carriages were passing with
drawn screens; and, as they drove slowly by, fingers held back the
curtains, and from time to time glimpses of womenâs figures were
disclosed of quite a different type from any within doorsâladies of
wealthy native families taking the air, and curious to see the
French streets by night. So I learned that it was the eve of
Leilet-el-Kadir, the twenty-sixth of Ramadan, the night of power
commemorating the descent of the Koran on earth, a grand Mohammedan
feast; and I went forthwith into old Tunis on my first voyage of
discovery. Festivity reigned. On every hand were lights of all
varieties; the minarets aloft were outlined with them; in the
narrow streets they were as the multitude of the stars for number,
colored and clustered, hung and looped and festooned, flaring and
lanterned, a fine illumination in the obscurity; and under them an
animated throng of all ages, beautifully dressed for the occasionâa
city, a race, and a faith
en fÃªte
.

I sat down at last in the cafÃ©-crowded Place Halfouine, one of
the principal open spaces or squares of the old city, not large,
and surrounded by low, rather mean, buildings. It was a nightscene,
closed in by shadows, the foreground brightened by irregularly
placed open cafÃ©s with tables outside and benches within, all
completely filled with men, drinking, smoking, playing at simple
games, quite orderly, without boisterous noise or muscular
disorder, or jokingâadmirable public behavior. It charmed by its
noveltyâcostumes and persons, mass without individualityâthe scene
of a new land. What folly to think that there are no more worlds to
discover! The scene was to me as if no one had ever looked on it
before. I observed the faces, the attitudes, the doings of this
strange people as if I had just landed from another world; and I
would gladly have stayed longer, but, with the early closing habits
of Moslems, the square began to thin, and I went with the rest
through the fast-emptying street with a glad feeling that in a
world, now grown altogether too small and neighborly, I had
happened upon one last true relic of the âfar away.â

It was four days later, however, that the true holiday came, the
feast of rejoicing after Ramadan is overâLittle Bairam. It is
celebrated at Tunis with special zeal. The morning streets were
overflowing with men and children in their best apparel; but the
latter, in particular, beautifully attired. Such gold jackets, such
tiny burnooses, such scarlet and crimson, turquoise and emeraldâand
pinks! Such chubby fat faces in their barbaric borders of
clothesâor delicate, refined features, stamped with race, set off
by their greens and blues! Such vivacity, too; pure childish fun
and pleasure in a national holiday! There were strings of open
carts of the rudest constructionâlike tip-carts for
gravelâcompletely filled with these children heaped up like
nosegays, their brilliancy of color set off by the rudeness of the
common cart. This seemed one of their principal pleasuresâtaking a
ride. But there were others. In a packed cross-street I was
addressed by two gallant lads of perhaps fifteen, who were selling
tickets at an entrance; with faces and figures full of hospitable
welcome to the stranger, they invited me in, and I went. Inside was
a small, barn-like theatre with a curtain, a stage and an audience;
and there I saw âthe shadows,â pictures thrown upon a screen, and
the histrionic art was thus practised with lifelike effect. I had
read of âthe shadows,â but I never expected to see them. I came out
after a while, and the boys saluted me with very cheerful and
animated smiles as I passed them. I spied another show a little
farther on; and this, undaunted by my former experience, I also
entered. It was the puppetsâalso a travellerâs treasure-troveâthe
French gendarme was the universal and unpitied victim, and the
plots were realistic incidents from things as they are. The
audience was almost wholly of children, from six years or less to
twelve or more, many of them with nurses or attendants; they took
an active and even excited interest, and did the necessary
reckonings and sums which the transactions on the stage called for,
and shouted out the answers as at a school exhibition, it might be,
though the transactions in question were not of a sort ever shown
at an American school, and would have evoked much remonstrance; but
the children were very happy through it all, thoroughly enjoyed it,
in fact. I went behind the curtain and saw the puppets engineered;
and I left the little theatregoers with fresh ideas of juvenile
amusements.

So all the morning I passed among the gayly decked crowd, with
one and another small adventure, always handsomely treated, aided,
saluted. A people of kind and gentle manners, old and young; and I
am glad that I first saw them so fortunately in their days of
pleasantry and taking pride in their own. The experience threw an
atmosphere of cheerfulness over the land and the people, and
softened many a darker scene of their common days, of their penury
and hardshipâtheir load of life. I could always think, even when
all was at its worst, that they still âhad seasons that only bade
live and rejoice,â when many went bravely clad and fed full, and
the whole city was vivid with a spirit of general joy. The fixed
expression of the crowd was one of resigned patience under habitual
control; the gayety, the happiness, the holiday were relieved on a
grave backgroundâa temperament, a character, an essential living,
unknown to me, something secret, profound. It was my first true
contact with Islam. One way, at least, by which a religion may
properly be measured is by its efficient power on those who profess
it; certainly the Moslem faith is very effective on its believers;
the sincerity of that faith is the first thing one learns about it
in practical observation. How often since then have I gathered with
them at this and other fÃªtes, and seen the carpeted streets and
tapestried walls, the solemn processions, the robes of state, the
fine horses, the men and the arms, all the barbaric display;
illuminations, fireworks, parades; but I have never been so struck,
as in these first Tunisian days, with the spirit of gentle
happiness that made my earliest impression of the race as I met it
on the shore of the sea.

III

Ranging
through the country by rail, I
found one of the oldest lands of earth wearing the signs, familiar
to my eyes years ago, of the American West. It seemed, at times,
like an hallucination of memory with odd differences, such as one
might have in a dream. Now and then one came to a larger and
well-gardened station, some watering-place of the richer citizens
in summer; or to a thriving seaport; but, in general, the stops
were at way stations, as in all thinly populated districtsâa simple
crossing of the long gray roads, with a few buildings for the
business of the line, vast spaces round about, possibly slightly
improved, with fields or orchards or little groves, a crowd of
loafers hanging on the gates or fence of the enclosure to whom the
arrival of the train was the dayâs event, a farm wagon of modern
make, with horses, awaiting some expected passenger and driving off
to some home lost in the expanse; in a word, the impression was of
colonial things, of the opening up of a country, of reclaiming the
soil. What one really saw everywhere was a frontier.

In the newspapers there was the same absorbing
themeâcolonization; the local news, the daily happenings were
characteristic of an agricultural, industrial, commercial life of
the nature of an invasion of the waste. Here large depots for
machinery were rising; there men of broad enterprise, or syndicate
companies had planted olives, or corn, or vines, on a vast scale
over miles of territory; further on, a new line was making
accessible the phosphate wealth of Gafsa. Modern civilization,
mechanism, communication, organized exploitation, penetrating a new
country, was what one felt, as if that region were truly new like a
savage land. Yet how many times civilization, in one or another
form, has rolled over it! In reality, it is one of the most ancient
beds of the human torrent, bare and forsaken as it looks now. And
now it is again a new frontierâthe place of the invasion of a new
era by a new race with new designs.

This impression, nevertheless, is mainly a thing of the mind, of
recollection and observation; to the eye it is not so noticeable,
such is the extent of the natural spaces, the contour and
atmosphere of things held in these far horizons, the new
temperament of that landscape, and so characteristically native
still is the aspect of indigenous human life not yet displaced. The
earth has the look of the wild. Whatever may have formerly been its
culture and occupancy, all had lapsed back to the primitive; a land
of plainsâmelancholy tracts under a gray sky or vast empty spaces
under a brilliant sunâedged in far distance by lone mountains,
caressed on broken shores by a barren sea; full of solitude,
sadness. Here and there some great ruin stood, not unlike
Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, or even cities of ruins; the land is
strewn with themâtemples, courts, baths, cisterns, floors, columns,
reliefs, arches of triumph, theatres; but they seldom count to the
eye. Antiquity, like the frontier, is also a thing of the mind, in
the main; the past and the future are both matter of reflection, in
the background of memory and knowledge it may be, but not
noticeable in the general landscape. It is a place where human fate
seems transitory, an insignificant detail, as on the seaâor like
animal life in nature, indifferent.

IV

Once
on such an excursion on the eastern
seacoast, the Tunisian Sahel, I left Sousse behind in the noon
glare, a busy, thriving, pleasant place, swarming with Arab life in
its well-worn ancestral ways and with French enterprise in its
pioneering glow. The old Saracen wall lay behind me towered and
gated, a true mediÃ¦val girdle of defence, and I gazed back on the
white city impearling its high hillside in the right Moslem way,
and then settled myself to the long ride southward as I passed
through cemeteries, crisscrossed with Barbary fig, and by gardens
adjoining the sea, and struck out into the plain, spotted with
salty tracts and little cultivated. It is thus that a ride on this
soil is apt to beginâwith a cemetery; it is often the master note
that gives the mood to a subsequent landscape, a mood of sadness
that is felt to be sterile also, impregnated with fatalism. A
Moslem burying-ground may be, at rare places, a garden of repose; a
forsaken garden it is usually, even when most dignified and
beautiful with its turbaned pillars in the thick cypresses; but it
is always a complete expression of death. The cemetery lies outside
at the most used entrance of a town; and, as a rule, in the country
it is of a melancholy indescribableâit lies there in so naked a
fashion, a hopeless and huddled stretch of withered earth in swells
and hummocks, hardly distinguishable from common dirt and
dÃ©brisâthe eternal potterâs field. It is a fixed feature in the
Tunisian landscape, which is made of simple elements, whose
continuous repetition gives its monotony to the land. A ride only
rearranges these elements under new lights and in new horizons.

Here the great plain was the common background; my course to
Sfax lay over it, broken at first by a blossoming of gardens round
a town or village, and twice I came out on the sea; but always the
course was over a plain with elemental mark and qualityâwith an
omnipresence as of the sea on a voyage. The line between manâs
domain and nature is as sharply drawn on this plain as on a beach;
where man has not labored the scene stretches out with nature in
full possession, as on the ocean; his habitations and territory are
islands. Everything is seen relieved on great spaces,
individualized, isolated; fields of grain, green and moving under a
strong land wind; or olive grovesâsilvery gleamsâon the hillsides,
clumps of trees, or long lines of them, whole hillsides, it may be;
or there are gardens, closed, secluded, thickly planted with pear
or peach or fig or other fruit, with vegetables, perhaps, beneath
and palms above. The figure scenes, too, are of the same recurring
simplicityâa man leading a spirited horse in the street, a camel
meagre and solemn and solitary silhouetting the sky anywhere within
a range of miles, boys in couples herding sheep in the middle
distances. The town or village emerging at long intervals is a
monochordâa point of dazzling white far off, dissolving on approach
into low houses, a confused mass of uneven roofs skirting the
ground except where the minaret and the palm rise and unite it to
heavenâto the fire-veined evening sky, deep and tranquil, or the
intense blue noon, or the pink morning bloom of the spiritualized
scene of the dawn. The streets are silent; by the Moorish cafÃ© lie
or sit or crouch motionless figures, sometimes utterly dull, like
logs on the earth, or else holding pipes or gazing at checkers, or
vacantâalways somnolent, statuesque, sedentary. There are no
windows, no neighborhood atmosphereâonly a stagnant exterior. The
feeling of a retreat, of repose, of being far away is always there.
These towns have a curious mixture of the eternal and the ruined in
their first aspect; as of things left by the tide, derelicts of
life all. A ride in the Sahel is a slow, kaleidoscopic combination
of these things, a reiteration without new meaningâthe town, the
cemetery, the grove, the garden, the plain, the fields, camels and
sheep, and herdboysâhorizons, somnolence, tranquillity. What a
ride! and then to come out on the sea at Monastir and Mahdiaâsuch a
homeless sea! There may be boats with bending sails, the fisherâs
life, suggesting those strange outlying islands they touch at,
exile islands from long ago, where Marius found hiding, and where
the Roman women of pleasure of the grand world were sent to live
and die, out of the worldâstill the home of a race, blending every
strain of ancient blood. Mahdia, once an Arab capital and long a
seat of power in different ages, is a famous battle name in
Mohammedan and crusading and corsair annals; it stood many a great
siege on its rocky peninsula, in Norman and other soldiering hands,
however lifeless it may seem now; but as one looks on its
diminutive harbor, a basin hewn in the rock, it seems now to speak
rather of the enmity of the sea and the terror of tempest on this
dangerous coastâshallow waters and inhospitable shores. History,
human courage, was but a wave that broke over it, and is gone like
the others, a momentary foam; but the sea is always the sea.
Everywhere one must grow familiar with the neighboring coast-line
before the sea will lay off that look of enmity it wears to all at
the first gaze; it is foreign always by nature. To descend here at
Mahdia, and to walk by its waves, to hear its roll, to look off to
its gulfs and hilltops afar, however brilliant may be the scene, is
to invite the deepest melancholy that the waste sea holdsâso
meaningless that world lies in its monotony all about. I remembered
the Moorish prince who here, after his long victories, stood
reflecting on the men who were great before him, and how their
glory was gone. It is a more desolate port now. One gladly turns to
the landâand there meets the plain, equally vaguely hostile.

So I rode on by the unceasing stretch of the way, through town
and by garden and grove, into the ever-enveloping plain that opened
before. It was like putting to sea at every fresh start; and late
in the afternoon, on the last far crest of the rolling plain, I saw
the great ruin, El Djem, that rose with immense commanding power
and seemed to dominate a world of its own sterile territory. It is
a great ruinâa colosseum; arches still in heaven, and piled and
fallen rocks of the old colossal cirque; it still keeps its massive
and uplifted majesty, its Roman character of the eternal city cast
down in the waste, its monumental splendorâa hoar and solemn token
of the time when there were inhabitants in this desolation to fill
the vast theatre on days of festival, and the line of its subject
highway stretched unbroken to Tunis and southward, a proud,
unending urban way of villas, a road of gardens, where now only
stagnates the salty plain, sterile, lifeless. The hamlet beside it
is hardly perceptible, like a mole-hill, a mere trace of human
life. I sat out the sunset; and after, under a cold, starry sky,
Orion resplendent in the west and the evening star a glory, I set
off again by the long road through the sparkling April darkness and
a wind that grew winter-cold with night, southward stillâthe vast
heavens broken forth with innumerable starry lightsâtill after some
hours of speeding on a route that was without a living soul, I came
again on belated groups of walking Bedouins and fragrant miles of
gardens dark by the roadway and many a thick olive grove, and drew
up at Sfax.

V

Sfax
is the southern capital of Tunisia.
It has always been an important site, and under the new rule of the
French thrives and prospers commercially, in true frontier fashion,
as the chief market and base of the country being opened up in the
inland behind it whose seaport it is. It is also an old Mohammedan
stronghold, and its inherited life and customs go on, as at Sousse,
in the immemorial Arab ways. I remember it as the city of the olive
and the sponge. In the early morning light the open spaces about
the market were littered with young boys at their open-air
breakfast, which may be seen at most Mediterranean seaports on the
Moslem sideâthe vender beside his cooking apparatus, the boys with
saucers of soup or sops of bread, and on all sides the beginnings
of labor; but all this meagre human life was framed in an exquisite
marine view beyond. The wharf was thickly lined with the
strange-looking boats of the sponge-fishers, their Greek flags at
half-mast in honor of Good Friday, their sailors in Albanian
costumes, their gear heaping the open spaces with ropes and nets
and endless tackle. It was all charming, one of the vignettes of
travel that will haunt the memory for yearsâthe odors, the little
tasks, the look of the toil of the sea, the sponges in dark heaps,
the blue, limpid morning air crossed with strange spars and ropes,
and the host of fluttering flags.

Later in the day I got its companion scene from a hilltop some
miles south of the city, whence one commands a view of olive
orchards sloping down in one vast grove, in lines of regular
intervals, as far as the eye can reach, and lost to sight on all
sides with nothing to break the expanseâonly millions of
olive-trees regularly planted, filling the entire broad, circling
landscape. A little tower surmounts the hilltop and from its round
apex one surveys the whole; the sense of this dot-like centre
enhances the impression that the scene makes of a living weft of
mathematical lines, like an endless spiderâs web. It is a unique
sight. The geometrical effect is curious, like an immense
garden-diagram; the similarity of the round, bullet-like heads of
the trees, all alike in shape, is a novel trait of monotony; the
silver-gray of the foliage, mixed with the reddish tones of the
soil, gives, in so broad a view, a ground earth color quite new to
the eye; and the sense of multitude in which, nevertheless,
individuality remains persistent and acutely distinct on so vast a
scale makes an indelible impression.

VI

I seek
in vain the secret of the charm
that Tunis lays upon me. Coming back to it, one feels something
intimate in the city, such as there is in places long lived in and
cherished, impregnated with memories, subtilized by forgotten life
and feeling. It has sunk deeper into the senses, the affections.
Can the charm be merely its soothing air, its weather, which, after
all, is our physical element? It has a marvellous sky; all hues
that are celestial and live in heaven are there. What clarity! Its
changeable blues excite and call the eye from hour to hour; and on
rainy days its grays are soft, enveloping mantles for the sight.
Its peculiar trait is a greenish tint in the blue, pervasive but
not defined, an infusion of clear emerald, translucent, such as one
sees in winter sunsets in New England; but here in early summer you
will distinguish it at high noon, after the rainless days of late
spring. Tradition associates heat with this coast, as with the
Mediterranean generally; but that is an illusion of the foreigner.
Tunis is often chilly, bitterly cold at times, though without the
fall of snow; it lies under the heights of the Atlas, and the winds
bring down the snow-chill on their wings. I remember one February
when there were no trains from Algiers for five days, the snow
blocking the road; it lay, at some places on the line, nine feet
deep. But whatever may be the weather, the atmospheric charm
remains; it is soothing, and has narcotic quality.

A fine landscape in fine weather is always captivating and
assimilates the traveller to the land. One is always at home in the
sun; and a noble view finds a friend in every eye. One or two such
experiences will make the fortune of a whole journey and after a
while be its whole memory. But in some regions, some cities, the
spell is perpetual; it is so at Tunis. The prospect is broad, and
wherever one turns the eye wanders off delightfully. The most
complete view is from the western hill, where is a beautiful great
park of rolling land with woods whence you will see the white city
southward; it lies like a great lily on its pads of green
background, with its motionless blue waters round aboutâa
lake-country scene; level waters like a flood, all floored and
streaked with purple and blue bands and reachesâa water prairieâto
where Carthage gleams white on its own green hill, amid an horizon
of snowy villages dazzling in the sun; and between, nearer,
isolated roofs that flash emerging from their obscure green gardens
and tree-clumps, here and there; farther still to the southeast, as
the eye travels out over the long lake into the gulf and the sea,
rises a mass of mountain blues that bound the entrance to the land
and its harbors. It is a view fit for a Greek amphitheatre.

Wherever you go, you are always coming out on these massive,
spacious, beautifully colored prospects, white strips of city or
village amid the spring, set in the master tone of blue that
envelopes and combines themâsky, and lake, and sea, themselves
infinitely changeable with the light and the distance and the hour.
Even in the most unexpected places Heaven will open these far-off
ways over a new land. I remember going into an obscure and blind
street, in the Arab quarter, among buildings in all stages of
apparent decay. I lifted the knocker at the lovely, nail-studded
door of an ancient-looking house, and passed at once into an inner
court with a fountain, beautifully decorated, cool, shadowy,
exquisite in repose and the sense of luxury; and I was led on
through a maze of stairways and passages till I came out on a large
room below the roof with a balcony; and stepping forward, I saw
unrolled as if by enchantment the whole sea-view. There must be
many such commanding points of vantage in the houses on the crest
of the thickly built hillâold Tunis, where the Arabs live. From
this station I overlooked the lower city with all its roofs and
streets. The multitude of green-tiled roofs on different levels
made the color-ground, whence rose the numerous low, white domes,
the slender minarets also touched with green or tipped with golden
balls, the greater domes of the mosques, the mass of the citadel;
broad French faubourgs and avenues were enclosing and defining
lines, with irregular masses of foliage, and deep, narrow streets
sank in the near scene, full of their native life. It was an
architectural wilderness of form and color, arresting, vivifying,
oriental in mass, feeling and detail, with the suggestion of a
dream, of evanescence, and round it was poured on all sides the
still blue elementâsky, ocean, air. In Tunis, I noticed, everything
seemed to end thus, in something beyond, in a mood; life constantly
distilled its dream, and it was a dream of the senses.

The senses are constantly appealed to; they are kept awake,
alert, attentive, and they are fed; they have their joys. We do not
habitually use our senses for joy; and this is a part of the spell
of Tunis, that there, under a Southern sky, the senses come into
their own again. It is not merely the instinct of curiosity that is
kept active by an
ensemble
so variously novel and
insistentâfor example, these pavilioned minarets, square with a
cube above, ending in a green pyramid, or else octagonal in shape
with the gallery and its awning, tipped by the three gold balls and
crescentâhaunting one like a strange sky; or the same instinct
crudely excited by the
ensemble
of a population so foreign
in physiognomy, garb, and physical behavior as the Arab in its
multifarious aspects, its color and movement, all the unaccustomed
surface of life. A street in old Tunis is truly seen only when
there is no one in it; it is then that it is most impressive and
yields up its spirit. What privacy! those blank walls! those rare
high windows beautifully set! those discreet hanging balconies of
latticed wood and iron! those nail-studded doors in exquisite
patterns, that seem to have been rarely opened! An old house, set
in some deep forest, is not more retired. And, if one passes
withinâsilence, and soft footfalls, and refinement of all
sense-impressions, the constant presence of delicately moulded
handiwork, tiles cooling to the eye, wrought stucco, carved wood;
and in those interiors, with their beautiful ceilings and
wainscoting, are columns that seem of pagan purity, fountains as of
woodland solitude, courts of garden peace. It is wonderful, how
this effect of harborage and seclusion has been attained by an art
so simpleâflowers, water, plaster, wood, traceries, colored tiles.
The city must be full of beautiful objects of this old art. It is
not in this or that house only, nor in the public museums where
rare examples are collected and massed, that one feels this
artistic quality in the old race. It is felt in the handicrafts
everywhere, the decoration of the surfaces, the enamelling, the
gilding, the effort and liking for what is wrought in lovely
patterns and relieved work of every description. There is a detail
in the Tunisian sense of beauty, an omnipresent and conscious
decorative spirit, something native and human. It is not only in
the palace, but in the street, as one treads the narrow ways, and
looks into the bright shops, and loiters in strange corners. It is
an art of the sensesâdecoration is most obviously that. Rooted in
barbaric taste? possibly; but most things human are rooted in
barbarism. Unintellectual? perhaps, in the European sense.
Unemotional? certainly not on the European scale of the emotions.
Not developed from the beauty of the human form? of course. But
there is a spirit of the senses as there is a spirit of the
intellect; and it has its own art, a distillation of its life, as I
intimated in speaking of the landscape that leads one into the mood
of a dreamâa dream of the senses. This art is akin to that
landscapeâit is of the life of the senses; and the Arabs were
always frankly a sensual race. And, however it be, the city has an
artistic temperament, to me; it has no factory qualities in its
aspect, its wares, or its people; it is yet virgin of the future, a
dying perfume of the past. This flavor that I find in its art is
not Arabian, though it flowered from that desert root; it is
Andalusian, and comes from the skill and temperament of those old
exiles who were driven out from the southern shores of Spain in
successive waves of the Moorish emigration, each in turn sowing
broadcast seeds of the most exquisite Arab art all along the shores
of North Africa, and richly here at Tunis. It was an hereditary
art, in families of builders, wood-carvers, stone-cutters,
stucco-moulders, painters, gilders, dyers, embroiderers,
leather-workers, damaskeen-workers, illuminatorsâthe Tunisian arts
of daily life, that gave to life that brilliant and exquisite
surface in dress, utensils, interiors, and also broad urban
artistic effects of luxury in the look of its commerce, the display
of its multicolored crafts, and the vistas of its minaret-haunted
sky. Tunis, in fact, is not altogether native, not of the pure
desert blood; from the thirteenth century well into the times of
the Renaissance it had a flavor not unlike that of a Greek colony
in Sicily or on old Italian coasts; it was grafted with the flower
of Andalusian culture, transplanted in adversity and flourishing on
the African soilâblooming, perishing, and leaving this exquisite
memory of itself, this intuition of vanished refinement and
elegance, like a perfume.

To this Andalusian infusion is also traced the charm of the
manners of the Tunisians, that gentleness of breeding, softness,
and urbanity, blended with an immovable dignity, which is so
indescribable a racial trait. It is not the least foreign thing
about them, and adds to the
fond
of mystery that they exude;
for, notwithstanding all that can be seen or told, or gleaned from
the past, mystery is of the essence of the travellerâs impression
at his first contact with the Arab race. It is a silent landscape,
a speechless folk, an incommunicable civilization; it is not only
the closed mosque, the secluded house, the taciturn figures strange
in garb and pose, immovably contemplative; but their lifeâall that
they areâseems a closed book in an unknown tongue, a scroll
unrolled but unintelligible. The feeling of racial mystery is
intense, and all external impressions lead the traveller finally
back to thatâthe insoluble soul of the race. It is not merely
Islam. These shores from the dawn of knowledge have been one of the
most fertile couches of the animal, man; here the young barbarian
has been born and bred, and passed away, through all the centuries,
and every civilization of the West has been seeded in conquest, and
has flowered in cities, typical capitals, and withered away,
leaving among the native race its ruins in their fields, in their
blood, on their facesâlike the Christian cross still tattooed on
Kabyle foreheads. It is a race that assimilates but is not
assimilated. It has taken the color and form, more or less
impregnated with the spirit, of the genius of Carthage, Rome,
Byzantium, Islam, France; it has felt the impact of Greek, Norman,
Spaniard; but it was ever a race of inexhaustible resistant power,
independent, tenacious, rebellious. It was never submerged or
exterminated. It is a fine race. Tunis is one of its cosmopolitan
cities, where it has drunk of every foreign stream and influence,
has been civilized, softened, informedâa city of the various
Mediterranean world, with great colonies of other folk in it,
Italians, Jews, Malteseâa New York, as it were, on its own scale.
In old Tunis, Arabized as it is, the desert race is itself only an
infusion; yet so persistent is the ideal of race on its own soil,
and so nomadic is the provincial population, that one feels the
presence of that old racial soul, rightly or wrongly, into which
the strength of the desert and the mountains has passed, which
never breathed the breath of Europe, which remains in its own
loneliness as in a fastness. It attracts and perplexes the human
mind that would fain make acquaintance with it, but is oppressed by
a feeling of impotence. And the exquisite personal demeanor of the
Tunisians is enigmatic in its impression; it is like the charm of
some Chinese painting or scroll that only emphasizes the
unintelligibility, the incommunicability of the too variant
spiritual past. With such delightful manners, such identical
refinements of taste, it would be so easy to be friends! But no; it
is more rational to think of it all as an artistic growth of a
foreign culture, a part of the lovely Andalusian inheritance of the
land.

To a mind with a historical background it is odd to find Tunis
so completely a modern city. The Andalusian tradition is
unconcentrated, and slight in its elements of reality, in things;
its full experience is rather an imaginative memory; and of the
times before that there is nothing left. In the suburban country
there are more, though few, relics of past ages, but there the
memory works more freely. One recalls, looking off to the
sea-towering Mountain of the Two Horns, that on one of those peaks
rose the ancient temple of Baal. The harbors of Carthage are
fascinating to the eye of the imagination; but the specific remains
there are scanty and mediocre; they arouse no reaction deeper than
thought; and in the museum of Carthage one dwells most on the
curious fact that what little has come down to us of that far-off
life has found its way only by the grave itself; here, as in so
many places, the tomb has been the chief conservator of life in its
material aspects and what may be inferred from them of the soul of
dead populations. It is rather in the neighborhood of the Cathedral
that memory expands, for beside the near home of the White
Brothers, who have spread their mantles and left their bones
throughout the Sahara, a noble mission nobly done, here survives
the only recorded anecdote of the history of this ridge, that must
have been the place of innumerable tragediesâthe marvellously vivid
Christian story of Saint Louisâs death. The narrative is as fresh
and poignant as if it were written yesterday; and on the spot one
likes to remember that the chivalrous and good French crusader and
king is a Moslem as well as a Christian saint. It is a symbol of
peace and conciliation. The past, however, is here a barren field.
Antiquity is felt, not in the survival of its monuments, but in the
sense of the utter waste, the annihilation of the past, the
extinction that has overtaken all that human life and its glory and
struggleâPunic, Roman, Visigothicâthe emptiness of the place of
their battles, religions, pleasures, buildings, and tombs. It is
all dÃ©bris; it is of the slightestâlittle archÃ¦ological heaps and
pits in a vast horizon of silent sky and sea. The mind becomes
merely pessimistic, surveying the scene; the mood of fatalism
invades itâthe mood of the frozen moon and the solar
catastropheâfloods of the eternal nothingnessâa mood of the pure
intellect; and one is glad to come back to some nook like Ariana, a
village midway between Carthage and Tunis, where ruin becomes again
romantic and human. The very roses bloom there as in a deserted
garden of long ago. It was there that the Hafsides, the rulers of
the golden age of Tunis in the thirteenth century, had their
country-seatsâfair as the paradise at Roccada, where one âwas gay
without cause and smiled without a reasonââsurrounded by gardens,
with great lakes shadowed by pine and cypress, and gleaming with
kiosks lined with marble and faience, with ceilings of sculptured
wood gilded and painted, and cooled by the fresh waters of many
fountains. The love of the country was always a trait hereâan Arab
traitâthe rich like to get out of the city to some place of quiet,
privacy and repose, such as La Marsa to-day by the sea near
Carthage. The sense of the reposeful country mingles with that of
the beautiful city in the past as well as now; and the Hafsides
were great civilizers, builders, favorers of trade, patrons of the
arts and of science. Their works and their gardens are gone alike.
Time drives his ploughshare often and deep in an African city; and
it is not alone on the green and shining levels of the suburban
country, with its great spaces and imperial memories, where every
maritime and migratory race has written some half-obliterated line
of history, that the mountains look on the sea, and there is a
great silence; but ruin is a near neighbor in the city as well. How
many nooks and corners, full of the romance of places left to
decay! That, too, is an Arab trait: to leave the old to decay and
forgetfulness. It is natural that things should die, and be let lie
where they fall. Oblivion is never far off.

What lassitude at last! Is it only the nerve-soothing weather,
which cradles and lulls, week after week, the wearied Western mind?
Is it only a renaissance of the senses, coming into their own,
restored and vivified with strange forms and colors, accepting the
impermanence of things human, and content to adorn and refine the
sensual moment, to withdraw and enjoy? or is it a new world, a new
mode of human life, with its own perceptions and intuitions and
valuations, a new form of the protean existence of men on the
earth, with another memory, psychology, experience? Whatever it be
it is a spell that grows.

I like
to pass my afternoons in the shop
of the perfumer in old Tunis. I come by covered ways, where the
sunlight sifts through old rafters on stained walls and worn
stones, and soon discern in the softened darkness the low, small
columns wound with alternate stripes of red and greenâbright
clustered colors; down the winding way of dimmed light in the
narrow street opens on either side the row of shallow shops,
shadowy alcoves of bright merchandise; and there in the heart of
old Tunis, each in his niche, canopied by his trade and seeming an
emanation of the things he sells, sit the perfumers. A throng
passes by, now dense, now thinâpasses forever, in crowds, in
groups, in solitude, rarely speaking; and over against the silent
movement sit the merchantsâtranquil figures in perfumed boxesâwhose
business seems one long repose. A languid scent loads the dusky
air.

Just opposite the venerable Mosque of the Olive, an isle of
sanctity still uncrossed by the heathen Frankish sea, right under
the shadow of its silence-guarded doors, stands and has stood for
centuries the shop where I love to lounge away hours that have no
attribute of time. My hostâI may well call him so, we are old
acquaintances nowâsalutes me, his robe of fading hues detaching the
figure from the background as he rises; his serene face lightens
with a smile, his stately form softens with a gesture, he speaks a
word, and I sit down on the narrow bench at the side, and light the
cigarette he has proffered, while his only son quickly commands
coffee. How well I remember years ago when the childâs soft Arab
eyes first looked into mine! He is taller now, beautifully garbed
in an embroidered burnoose; and he sits by me, and talks in low
tones. What a relief it is, just to be here! What an ablution! The
very air is courtesy. There is no need to talk; and we sit, we
three, and smoke our cigarettes, and sip our coffee, with now and
then a word, and regard the street.

A motley street, like the bridge at Stamboulâa provincial form
of that unfathomable sea of human faces; and, here as there, an
unknown world in miniature, diverse, novel, brilliantâthe African
world. The native predominates, with here and there a flash of
foreign blood, round-faced Sicilians, Spaniards whose faces seem in
arms, French in uniforms; but always the nativeâevery strain of the
littoral and the highland, every tint of the desert sun:
black-bearded Moors of Morocco, vindictive visages; fat Jews of
Djerba laughing; negroesâboys of Fezzan or black giants of the
Soudan; Arabs of every skin, hints of Gothic and Vandal blood and
the old blond race long before all, resolute Kabyles, fair Chaouia,
Touaregs with white-wrapped faces, caravan men, Berber and Bedouin
of all the land; women, too, veiled or with children at the open
breast. That group of Tunisian dandiesâhow they stroll! olive
faces, inexpressive, with the jonquil stuck over the ear, swinging
little canes, clad in fine burnooses of pale blues or dying greens
or ashy rose! Those bare-legged Bedouins, lean shoulders looped in
earth-brown foldsâhow they walk! Every moment brings a new
challenge to the eye. What life histories! what unspeaking faces!
how closed a world! and my eyes rest on the shut gates of the
ancient Mosque of the Olive over against me; I feel the spell of
the unknown sealed in that faith, this lifeâthe spell of a new life
of the spirit of man, the mystery of a new earth-life of his
body.

One falls into revery and absent-mindedness here, as elsewhere
one falls asleep; but not for long. A lady, closely veiled, stands
in the shop with her shorter, low-browed attendant. I hear low
syllables softly murmured; I am aware of a drop of perfume rubbed
like dew on the back of her hand just below the small fingers, not
too slim; I watch the fall of the precious, twinkling liquid in the
faceted bottle; I mark the delicate handling of the small balances.
It is like a picture in a dream, so still, so vivid in the
semi-darkness of the booth. She is gone, and the fancy wanders
after herâwhither? The boyâs
taleb
, his teacher of the
mosque school, passing, sits down for a momentâan alert figure,
scrutinizing, intelligent, energetic. There has been some school
excitement, some public commotion; master and boy both scan the
last paper with eagerness. I ask about the boyâs lessons; but with
a kind look at my young friend, and a half reply to me, he puts the
question aside, as if one should not say pleasant things in a boyâs
hearing too much. He is soon off on his affairs; and other friends
of the shop come and go, not too often, some hearty, some subtle,
but all cordial, merchants who would woo me away to other shops
behind whose seemingly narrow spaces lies the wealth of great
housesâoh, not to buy, but only to view silken stuffs, trifles of
wrought silver, things begemmed, inlaid sword and pictured leather,
brass, mosaic, horn, marvels of the strong and deft brown Arab hand
in immemorial industries; the wealth of a large world is nigh, when
I pleaseâit is but a step here to Samarcand or Timbuctoo; but I
say, lightly, âAnother day.â

I love better to sit here, flanked by the huge wax tapers,
overhung by the five-fingered groups of colored candles, amid the
curiously shaped glasses and mysterious boxes, the gold filagree,
the facets, the ivory eggsâand to breathe, only to breathe,
diffused hidden scents of the rose and the violetâjasmine,
geraniumâessences of all flowers, all gardens, all odorous things,
till life itself might seem the perfumed essence of existence and
the sensual world only an outer dusk. Oh, the delightful narcotism!
I was ever too much the Occidental not to think even in my dreamâI
am conscious of the feeling through allââWhat am I, an alien,
here?â But it is sweet to be here, to have peace, and gentleness,
and courtesy, young trust and brave respect, and breeding; it is
balm. The darkness falls; the passer-by grows rare; it is closing
time. There is a drop for my hand now, for good-by. The boy
companions me to the limit of old Tunis. It is good night. It is a
departureâas if some shore were left behind. It is a nostalgiaâa
shadowy perception that something more of life has escaped, of the
irretrievable thing, gone, like something flown from the hand. And
as I come under the Gate of France into the lights of the brilliant
avenue, I find again him I had eluded, whom I heard as the voice of
one standing without, saying: âWhat am I, an alien, here?ââI am
again the old European.

VIII

Quick
music comes down the evening
streetâthe clatter of cavalryâthe beautiful rhythm of horsesâ
backsâflash of French uniforms so harmonized with the African
settingâspahis, tirailleurs, gunsâa gallant and lively scene in the
massed avenue! I love the French soldiers in Africa; but it is with
a deeper feeling than mere martial exhilaration that one sees them
to-night, for this is an annual fÃªte-day, and their march
commemorates the entry of the French troops into Tunis. One
involuntarily looks at the faces of the natives in the
crowdsâimpassible. But the old European cannot but feel a thrill at
the sight of France, the leader of our civilization, again taking
charge of the untamed and reluctant land and its intractable people
to which every mastering empire of the North, from the dawn of our
history, has brought in vain the force of its arms and the light of
its intelligence. The hour has come again, and one feels the
presence of the Napoleonic idea, clad, as of old, in the French
arms; for it is from Napoleon, that star of enlightenmentâNapoleon
as he was in his Egyptian campaignsâthat the French empire in
Africa derives; and if, as the heir of the Crusades, France was
through centuries the protector of Christians in the East, and that
rÃ´le is now done, it is a greater rÃ´le that she inherits from
Napoleon as the friend of Islam, with the centuries before her.
Force, demonstrated in the army, is the basis of order in all
civilized lands; that is why the presence of the French uniform
delights me; but it is not by brute force that France moves in the
essential conquest, nor is it military lust that her empire in
Africa represents and embodies. It is, rather, a striking instance
of fatality in human events that her advancing career in North
Africa presents to the historical mind; a slight incidentâa bey
struck one of her ambassadors with a fanâforced on her the
occupation of Algiers, and in the course of years she found herself
saddled with a burden of colonial empire as awkwardly and
reluctantly as was the case with us and the Philippines. There were
anticolonialists in her experiences, as there were antiimperialists
with us; and the arguments were about the same, essentially, in
both casesâthe rights of man, a new frontier, an alien people, with
various economic considerations of revenue, tariff, exploitation.
That obscure element of reality, however, which we call fate,
worked on continuously, linking situation with event, difficulty
with remedy, what was done with what had to be done, till the
occupation spread from Algiers into the mountains, along the
seaboard, over the Atlas, into the desert, absorbing the
neighboring land of Tunis, skirting the dangerous frontier of
Moroccoâand now the vitalizing and beneficent power of French
civilization, as it might almost seem against the will of its
masters, dominates a vast tract of doubtful empire whose issues are
among the most interesting contingencies of the future of humanity.
It is a great work that has been accomplished, but is greater in
the tasks it opens than in those already achieved.

The policy of pacification and penetration is, indeed, one of
the present glories of France. There has been fierce fighting, hard
toils of war; the land has been the training-school of French
generals; and were it known and written, the story of French
campaigning in the mountains and the desert would prove to be one
of those heroic chapters of fine deeds obscurely done, rich in
personal worth, that of all military glory have most moral
greatness. The
esprit
of the soldiers was like that of
devoted and lost bandsâthey were there to die. But it belongs to
military force to be initial and preparatory, occasional, in its
active expression; thereafter, in its passivity, it is a guarantee;
it is order. The great line of French administrative policy,
whether playing through the army or beyond it, was, nevertheless,
the child and heir of Napoleonâs idea; amity with Islam. To respect
rites, usages, prejudices, to make the leaders of the
peopleâchiefs, judges, religious headsâintermediaries of power, to
find with patience and consideration the line of least resistance
for civilization by means of the social and racial organization
instead of in opposition thereto, and to display therewith not a
spirit of cold, proud, and superior tolerance but a frank and
interested sympathyâthat, at least, was the ideal of the French way
of empire. It had its disinterested elementsârespect for humanity
was implicit in it. What strikes the close student of the movement
most is not the military advance but the extraordinary degree to
which the military advance itself was impregnated with
intelligence, scientific observation, scholarly interest, economic
suggestion, engineering ambition, as if these French officers were
less men of arms than pioneers of knowledge and public works. The
publications through fifty years by men in the service on every
conceivable topic relating to the land and its people in
scientific, economic, and historical matters are innumerable; they
constitute a thorough study of vast areas. Such a fact tells its
own storyâa story of devotion in a cause of civilization.

Peaceful penetration does not mean merely that the railroad has
entered the Sahara, and the wire gone far beyond into its heart,
and the express messenger crossed the great waste; nor that the
school and, with it, the language are everywhere, subduing and
informing the mind; nor that agricultural science, engineering
skill, economic initiative, and even philanthropic endeavor,
hospitals, hygiene, are at work, or beginning, or in contemplation;
but it means the restoration of a great and almost forsaken tract
of the earthâfrom the Mediterranean and Lake Tchad to the Niger and
the Atlanticâwith its populations, to the benefits of peaceful
culture, safe commerce, humane conditions, and to fraternity with
the rest of mankind. It is not the brilliant military scene that
holds my eye in the packed avenue, with its double rows of trees
shadowy in the air, lined with brilliant shops and stately urban
buildings, opera, cathedral, residenceâthe familiar modern
metropolitan scene in the electric glare; but I see the work of
France all over the darkened land from the thousand miles of
seacoast, up over the impenetrable Atlas ranges, down endless
desert routesâcarrying civilizing power, like a radiating force,
through a new world.

IX

Tunis
is the gateway by which I entered
this worldâthe new world of France, the old world of the desert. It
was almost an accident of travel that I had come here, refuging
myself from the life I had known, and seeking a place to forget and
to repose, away from men. I had no thought of even temporary
residence or exploration; but each day my interest deepened, my
curiosity was enlivened, my sympathies warmed, and slowly I was
aware that the land held me in its spellâa land of fantastic
scenery, of a mysterious people, of a barbaric history and
mise
en scÃ¨ne
, a land of the primitive. I coursed it from end to
end.

The best description of North Africa as a visual fragment of the
globe is that which delineates it as a vast triangular island,
whose two northern horns lie, one off Spain at Gibraltar, the
other, with a broader strait, off Sicilyâwith a southward wall
overlooking the ocean-like Sahara, and running slantingly to the
Atlantic, whose seaboard makes the narrow base of the triangle.
This immense island is gridironed through its whole mass with
mountains, ranging southwest and northeast, and hence not easily
penetrable except at those remote ends; it is backed by table-lands
of varying breadth between the Northern and the Saharan Atlas,
which form its outer walls, and the conglomeration of successive
ranges at varying altitudes, with their high plateaus, is cut with
deep gullies, valleys, pockets, fastnesses of all sortsâa
formidable country for defence and of difficult communication.
Under the southern edge of the Saharan Atlas, like a long chain of
infrequent islands, runs the line of oases in the near desert from
the northeasterly tip of the lowlands of the isle of Djerba
southwesterly the whole distance to the Atlantic, and here and
there pressing deep into the waste of sand and rock; under the
northern wall stretches the arable lowland here and there on the
Mediterranean coast where lie the mountain-backed ports. At the
highest points, in Morocco, lies perpetual snow, and the land is
snow-roofed in winter.

Among these wild mountains in antiquity lived an indigenous
blond race, whose blue-eyed, clear-complexioned descendants may
still be met with there, and mixed with them a darker population
from the sunburnt desert and lowlands, the Getulae and Numidians of
history, of whom Jugurtha was a fine and unforgotten type; on these
original and tenacious races, whose blood was inexpugnable, poured
the immigrant human floods through the centuries from north and
south, west and east, but the natives maintained their hold and the
stock survived. The Punic immigration, with its great capital of
Carthage, only touched the coast; the Romans established a great
province in Tunisia, founded cities and garrisoned the country as
far as the desert and into the Riff, and made punitive expeditions
among the nomads to the south; the Visigoths flocked from Spain,
overran the whole country, and passed away like sheets of foam; the
Byzantines rebuilt the fortresses, and their hands fell away; the
Arab hordes in successive waves carried Islam to the western ocean,
and, settling, Arabized great tracts of the Berber blood, and made
the land Moslem, but with a deeper impregnation than when it had
been Romanized and Christianized; while through all the years of
their slow and imperfect dominance new floods of fresh desert blood
poured up from the Sahara, much as the barbarians fell from the
north upon Rome. The massive island was thus always in the
contention of the human seas, rising and falling; yet the Berber
blood, the Berber spirit, continually recruited from the Sahara,
seems never to have really given way; taking the changing colors of
its invaders, it persistedâa rude, independent, democratic, fierce,
much-enduring, untamable race. It wears its Islam in its own
fashion. It keeps the other stocks, that dwell in it, apart; the
Jews, the Turks, Italians, Maltese, Spaniards, are but colonies,
however long upon the soil, and even though in some instances they
adopt native costumes and ways. And now it is the turn of
Franceâthat is to say, of dominant Western civilization in its most
humane and enlightened form.

How many interests were here combined! A land of natural
wildness, of romantic and solemn scenes, of splendid solitudes and
varying climates; a past dipped in all the colors of history; a
race of physical competency, savage vitality, where the primitive
ages still stamped an image of themselves in manners and actions
and aspect; the fortunes of one of the great present causes of
humanity, to be paralleled with Egypt and India, a work of
civilization! It could not but prove a fine adventure. And so I
turned nomad, and fared forth. Bedouin boys, rich with my last
Tunisian copper, gave me delighted good-bys as they ran after my
carriage, screaming bright-eyed; and I felt as if I had already
friends in the lonely, silent land as the long level spans of the
high aqueduct marched backward, and the train sped on.

SNOW in April! I could hardly believe my eyes
as I looked through the blurred panes of the one small window on
the large, moist flakes falling thickly, the trees green with
spring-time whose young foliage was burdened and slim limbs
delicately heaped with snow an inch deep in the windless air, while
the little park was a white floor and the half-invisible roofs a
drifted curtain like a broken hillsideâit was so like a snowy
spring at home. I was in the unpretending hotel, in an upper corner
room, bare, narrow, but clean, which reminded me curiously of such
accommodation as one used to find in western Kansas towns thirty
years ago, fit for the seasoned traveller, but without
superfluities,âfrontier-like, a border lodging; and the impression
was deepened and vivified when I descended the rude and confused
stairway and found the private-family dining-room, with the only
fireâolive-knots burning reluctantly on a small hearth. A French
officer, hanging over it, made room for me, and in a moment two
other officers appeared, heavily clothed with leather and capes,
prepared, as I gathered, for a long ride in the country. It might
have been a hunting scene in Colorado, in the early morning, except
for the military color, the foreign physiognomy and the French
coffee we were drinking; it had the traits of rude vigor, hardihood
and weather that belong to an outdoor life.

It seemed more natural to go out into the snow than not, and so
I found an Arab and went. Our path led us a short way through
streets of Sunday quiet, and soon broke by a city gate into
irregular country, picturesque from the beginning with ruined
masses of old ramparts. The road was bordered with trees and
hedges, a lovely road even in the snow, and soon it was apparent
that we were passing through the midst of an old and extensive
cemetery with cypresses, cactus, fig-trees, here and there an
immense carob-tree, and olives and locusts, diversifying the uneven
lines of the slopes; and everywhere, as far as one looked,
neglected graves, shrines in ruins, koubbasâsmall, square,
dome-covered memorials of the saintsâdilapidated and with broken
arches, the dÃ©bris of centuries of devotion and mortality. It was
quite in keeping; for I was myself on pilgrimage, where for seven
centuries the faithful Moslem of the land had preceded me, to the
holy tomb of Sidi bou-MÃ©dyen, the patron saint of the little city.
As he ended his earthly travels on one of these neighboring
slopesâand he had wandered through the Arab worldâhe exclaimed:
âHow good it were to sleep in this blessed soil the eternal
slumber!â and so they buried him there. It was a place of
immemorial consecration; in early times of the faith a body of
pious Moslems had been cloistered near by, and already in that age
in these fields the âmen of Godâ had their resting-places about
which the Moslems liked to be buried, as old Christians used to
wish to lie in holy ground about the church. It was even then a
place of pilgrimage, and a village grew up about it, and ruins of
minarets and mosques still lie there; and later, about Sidi
bou-MÃ©dyenâs shrine, another village was built among the
encumbering graves, for he was a famous saint and many pilgrims
came there, and now the inhabitants say pleasantly: âWe have the
dead in our houses.â The landscape is thus a place of tombs; but it
is enchanting, and one sees at a little distance terraced mountain
edges, thick gardens of olive, the pomegranates, the ancient
fig-trees, masses of foliage and vines, abounding fertility and
freshness, green and flowering with spring; and sown all along the
tree-sheltered road the low and humble ruins of mortality.

I entered the villageâthe road ran a mile or more through such a
sceneâand climbed the steep way to the wooden door through which
one comes into the precincts of the saintâs tomb with its attendant
mosque and school. I did not anticipate a mausoleum; I was familiar
with such shrines and knew what I should see; but the square
koubbas, with their white domes, which one sees everywhere in the
fields, on the hilltops, all over this lonely country, give a grave
and solemn accent to the landscape, and I felt the reverence of the
place, remote and solitary, where so many thousand men had warmed
their life-worn hearts in the glow of the faith. In the
antechamber, adjoining the shrine, Moorish arches fell on four
small onyx columns of beautiful purity, resting on the tiled floor,
and just at my feet was an ancient holy well whose onyx edge was
deeply cut by the wearing of the chain that had given water to
twenty generations of those who thirsted for God. As I turned, the
room of the shrine was open before meâheavy with shadows, almost
dark, while the light struggled through vivid, dull spots of
colored glass, blue, green, red, on the obscurity where I saw the
raised coffin, swathed with silken stuffs and gold-wrought work and
thick with hanging standards; another coffin, with the body of the
companion and disciple of the saint, stood beside, more humbly
covered, and there were candles, chandeliers, suspended ostrich
eggs, lanterns, and banal European objects, the common furnishings
of shrines. I lingered a while with the sombre and thoughtful
respect natural before a sight so very human, so impregnated with
humanity. I noted the votive offerings on the door, bits of silk
and tangled threads, which attested the humility of the estate of
multitudes of these poor peopleâremnants of fetichism; and the
strips of painted wood upon the walls of the antechamber, with
ordinary Mohammedan designs, rude scrawls of art.

I issued into the court, in the raw snowy air, and crossed the
narrow space to the mosque. It was a magnificent portal that rose
before me through the falling flakes, raised on its broad steps as
on a base, and lifting the apex of its wide horseshoe arch more
than twenty feet in air; a high entablature expanded above. The
whole surface of the gateway was covered with arabesque work in
mosaic faience to the architrave, bearing its dedicatory
inscription in beautiful architectural script, and with enamelled
tiles aboveâall in sober colors of white, brown, yellow, and
greenâand finely wrought in Moorish designs; it was a noble
entrance. I passed within its shadows, and found myself in a
stately porch, richly ornamented, the lateral walls overlaid, from
a lower space left bare and severe, by delicately arcaded work in
stucco as far as to the springing of the stalactite ceiling of the
cupola, whose central points gave back the reflected snow-lights
from below; massive bronze doors, sombre, rich in shadowy tones,
filled the fourth sideâtheir plates, riveted to the wood, chiselled
and overspread with large, many-pointed stars engaged in an
infinite lineal network of that old art, in whose subtility and
intricacy and illusory freedom of control the Moorish decorative
genius delighted to work. The momentary sight, as my eyes rounded
out the full impression of the porch I stood in, was, as it were, a
seizure; the noveltyâfor I had never before seen this art in its
own homeâthe refinement, the harmony relieved on the sense of mass
and space, the seclusion, the winter lights without, the cool and
sombre peace, combined to make a moment in which memory
concentrates itself. It was an Alhambra chamber in which I stood;
and the first realizing sight of a new art, like that of a new
land, is a vivifying moment, full of infinite possibility, almost
of a new life for the artistic instincts. I shall never forget the
moment nor the place where the spell of the Andalusian craftsmen
first thus seized me in the slowly falling snow.

The way led me on into the arcaded court, and then the hall of
prayer, under the arches of its crossing naves, to the ornamented
recess sunk in the further wall, the mihrab, which is the Moslem
altar and guides the hearts of the people, as they pray, toward
Mecca. Its arch rested on two small onyx columns, with high,
foliated capitals, exquisite in their romantic kind; and above and
about ran the arabesque decoration in plaster and all over the
walls of the mosque and the surface of the Moorish arches, whose
intervening roofs were ceiled with sunken panels of cognate but
diverse designâa beautiful garniture of wandering lineal relief,
like the veining of a leaf, netted in geometrical forms, emboldened
with lines of cursive script, flowing with conventionalized floral
branch and palms, varied, repeated, interlaced. The architectural
masses and spaces defined themselves with firmness and breadth in
contrast with this richly elaborated surface; there seemed a
natural unity between the design and the decoration, as of the
forest with its foliage; through all one felt the effect that
belongs unfailingly to the mosqueâa grand simplicity. I wandered
about, for a mosque charms me more than a church; and then I turned
to the mÃ©dersah, or college, adjoining its precinct, with its
central court lined with scholarsâ cells and its hall for lectures
and prayer beyond. It was pleasing to find a college under the
protection of the saint. Sidi bou-MÃ©dyen was himself a scholar,
bred at the schools of Seville and Fez; he retired to the
anchoriteâs life on these hills while yet a youth, and being
perfected in the friendship of God, admitted to ecstasy and
invested with the power of miracle, preached at Baghdat, professed
theology, rhetoric, and law at Seville and Cordova, and opened a
college of his own on the African shore at Bougie, then a hearth of
liberal studies, where his tall figure, his resonant, melodious
voice and flowery and fiery eloquence gained him a great name; it
was thence he was summoned by the reigning prince of Tlemcen on
that last journey on which, nearing the cityâs âblessed soil,â
where his divine youth was passed, he died. It was quite fit that a
college, as well as a mosque, should be raised and perpetuate his
name near his tomb. I left its portal and passed down by the
stairway to the court, and gazed up at the minaret, decorated above
and wreathed with a frieze of mosaic faience, that lifted its three
copper balls at its culmination, dominating the little group of
sacred buildings on this hill, so characteristic of the Moslem
faith and past; and its slender and guarding beauty was the last
sight I saw as I went down through the narrow way and issued into
the village road. A tall, grave Arab youth, standing in the snow,
offered me a great bunch of violets, which I took; and in the
clearing weather I began my walk back through that broad orchard
cemetery, with its endless human dÃ©bris under the light fall of
snowâarch and mound and wall among the trees, while brief glints of
sunshine lightened over it. Cemeteries are usually ugly; but this
is one of the very few that I remember with fondness, perhaps
because here there was no effort to delay the natural decay of
human memory. Death is as natural as life, and here it seemed so;
there was no antithesis of the fallen ruin and the blossom
springing in the snow, but a tranquil harmony. It is so that I
remember it.

II

Later
in the afternoon, the weather
continuing to clear, I drove with a French gentlemanâwe were
mutually unknownâto the cascades lying not far to the southeast.
Tlemcen is posed at a somewhat high elevation on the last spurs of
the ranges that encircle and dominate it from behind, and faces a
great plain, bounded with distant blue mountains on the sides, and
having the Mediterranean at its far limit, whose gleam can be seen
only on fair, clear days. It is a spacious prospect; and the near
view in which we drove by a rising serpentine road was finely
mountainousâdolomitic crags on the right, and on the left a deep
ravine denting the plain whose gently sloping plateau had many a
time been a chosen battle-ground. Birds flew about the heights and
verdure clothed the scene. The geological formation lends itself to
numerous living springs; the upper limestone rests on sandstone,
which in turn lies on marl and clay, and the mountain rainfall is
thus caught in natural reservoirs, which issue in innumerable
outlets in the porous surface. These successive ranges of the
extreme North African shore are, in fact, a continuation of the
hills of Grenada, with which they form a great half circle, centred
at Gibraltar, and with its hollow turned toward the Mediterranean;
it is the country of the Moroccan Riff, and the character of the
landscape on the African side is precisely the same as in Spainâit
is Andalusian scenery. As we drew near our goal, the rocks took on
more distinctly the picturesqueness of outline, due to long
erosion; they had a look like natural ruins high in air, and
opposite, just beyond the cascades, a superb cliff mountain filled
the lower sky.

We passed through a little garden to the foot of the fall. It
was a grotto scene. The water issued in masses from low cavernous
walls and recesses over whose broken floors and spurs it poured. It
was not a simple waterfall, however, that we had come to see, but a
succession of cascades that fell from shelf to shelf far up the
precipice. The whole scene was robed in new-fallen snow, and the
way wet and slippery; but the ascent was easily practicable by a
path that led up the incline, with many a gyration, often dipping
into the bed of a flowing stream and mounting by the rocks in the
midst, often too steep and slippery to climb without the friendly
aid of bushes, grasping hands and canes. But one scrambled up, and
the running water underfoot, snow and icy slides, only gave a wild
tang and gentle touch of adventure to the rather breathless labor;
and every little while one stopped and looked below into the
deepening ravine, or approached the falling waters in some new
aspect, till we came out at the summit of the upper cascade, where
it poured beautifully down in the midst of a cirque of pointed
rocks that rose from an indescribably fantastic mass of juts and
hanging eyries, as it were, all clothed and thick with vegetation,
vivid and bathed, inexpressibly fresh, trees and shrubs and flowers
and vines, an exuberance of plant life; and the glittering cascade
fell spraying far into its rocky heart and sent back mellow music
from the depth. âIt is a landscape of Edgar Poe,â said my
companion. I was startled for a moment, but a glance assured me
that the aptitude of his remark was unknown to the speakerâit was
only a spontaneous tribute to genius, which perhaps the casual
presence of an American had helped to germinate. But, indeed, the
impression of the scene could hardly have been better given than in
those words. It was âa landscape of Edgar Poeââjust such a one as
he would have chosen as the scene of one of his romances, as my
companion went on to say; it was
sui generis
, fantastic, a
marriage of the garden and the wilderness, not without a touch of

diablerie
, the suggestion that would make of such a retreat
the haunt of Arabian fancy, primitive tragedy, and enchanted
legend. It had the formal character of romance and the atmosphere
of natural magic; a place where
unearthliness
might find its
home. That was the Poesque trait that the random suggestion,
perhaps, overdefined. This scene, however, was not all, as, indeed,
our ears warned us; and crossing a narrow crown of land toward the
muffled roar, we saw another falling river; the slender column of
wavering waters came from a great height, sprayed and united, and
rushed with a flood of force and speed to join the waterfall below;
it had the beauty of something seen against the sky, in contrast
with what was seen below against the earth; it was a unique
combination, and the only time I have ever seen the junction of two
rivers by the waterfall of one flowing into the waterfall of the
other.

We went by an upper path to the high viaduct of a railroad that
crosses the deep glen at that point, and thence commanded the broad
expanse of the seaward plain with its near amphitheatre of mountain
ranges, and Tlemcen lying below on its headland among its orchards.
The reason why it grew up, and stood for centuries, was plain; it
is the key of the country. It seemed, and is, a garden city; and as
we walked or scrambled down the looped pathway over the terraced
face of the hill on that side, and drove on round the circuitous
road and back on our track to the city, I was most struck by the
endless orchards lying beneath us on the bottom-lands at the foot
of the ravine, and others through which we passed; and during all
my stay I saw themâorchards of orange, lemon, almond, peach, and
pear, and apple trees, and olives, and especially cherries, in
profusion everywhere, and among them the constant sound of running
waters from the springs.

III

The
fruit-bearing feature of the country
must have been an original trait. Pomaria, or as one might say in
our own phrase, Orchard-town, was the name of the first settlement
in the colonizing days of Rome. I walked to the place, just under
the northern wall of the city, one morning for a stroll. I was soon
at the foot of the tall minaret of the ruined mosque of Sidi Lahsen
that rises on the site of old Agadir, which was the Berber name
that next absorbed the Roman Pomaria; and I saw the Latin-inscribed
stones built into the foundation, ruin under ruin, as it were; for
the walls of the minaret, which towered a hundred and fifty feet,
were dilapidated, their enamel weather-worn, showing faded green
and yellow tones in the rectangular spaces on the sides and the
bordering band at the top, which bore the ceramic decoration; the
campanile above, tipped with a storkâs nest and a stork, added a
touch of lonely desertion, and grass and flowers were growing
between the stones of the adjacent roofless floor. Ruined mosques
are often as beautiful as English abbeys.

I wandered on through a country district over which was
scattered a native village, but in the main an open region. It was
remarkable for the number of old trees it contained; and, indeed,
hardly less striking a feature of the landscape of Tlemcen, in
general, than its garlanding orchards is this grouping of old
trees, though it is rarer. The whole African coast affords
specimens of trees of great mass and age. I remember one such on
the eastern borders of Algeria that I found among the fields, deep
in the country; or rather I was guided to it by the Arab children I
had gathered in my train, and especially by one Bedouin shepherd
lad who had left his wandering herd to follow me, and they insisted
that I should see the sacred tree. It was a monarch of the valeâone
of a group of three; massive in foliage, long of limb, great of
girth, horizontal in aspect, a leaning, almost fallen, tower of the
forest. It looked as if centuries were indifferent to itâit was so
old. It was a holy tree, a
marabout
, as they called it; and
bits of cloth, strips of rags, fluttered from its boughs, where
they had been placed as votive offerings by the poor people of the
district. I was told that I should put some copper coins on the
bough or in the hollow, for an offering and to have good fortune,
for no one would take them, and I did so, glad to pay my devoirs
and wondering inwardly how long it was since my own far ancestors
had joined in tree-worship. It was the first time I had ever seen a
sacred tree, one actually worshipped, and it touched my
imagination. At Tlemcen I saw no tree so fine as that; but there
were several that bore a patriarchal resemblance; and in the
morning stroll I speak of I found a grove of them, not close
together, but spread out over the open landscape and nigh enough
for neighborhood. They were terebinths, old ruins of the vegetable
world, with that same horizontal reach and earth-bowed airâthey
might almost seem on their knees in some elemental adoration; age
filled them; in that cemeteryâfor it was a cemeteryâthey were
monumental. It was a quiet landscape; cattle were grazing here and
there; three or four ruined koubbas with broken arches and fallen
walls rose at intervals, once stately monuments, for this was the
burial-place of the royalty of Tlemcen in their empire years. Not
far away, on a knoll, in a place apart, was the shrine of the first
patron saint of the city, then Agadirâfor Sidi bou-MÃ©dyen was a
later comer, and saints, like dynasties, have their times and
seasons, and this cemetery of the City-Gate was old before his
hillside began to know the furrow of death. The first patron, Sidi
WahhÃ¢b, a companion of the Prophet and a comrade of the conqueror,
lies under the terebinths. Pointed by a magnificent tree, I passed
along its shadow down a shelving, stony way to a little garden of
roses; there, in the hollow, sunken in the surrounding soil by its
antiquity, I found the grave of Sidi Yaqoub, walled, but open to
the skyâa lovely place, with the rose and the terebinth and the
sky. This cemetery of the City-Gate was a kind of spiritual outpost
for protection; the saints, indeed, camped about all the gates to
guard the city in their death; nor was it altogether in vain; it is
related of at least one prudent conqueror that he carefully
inquired as to number and virtue of the saints who lay at the
various gates, as if they had been modern batteries, and selected
for attack that postern where least was to be feared from the
ghostly artillery. The position at the spot I have described was
uncommonly strong.

I followed on my return the broken line of the old ramparts of
Agadir, a knife-edge path, or divide, as it were, a climbing,
tortuous, rough way, great masses of red soil heavily overgrown
with vivid vegetation, trees, bushes, vines, emerging on a
bewildering combination of gardens and tanneriesâa dilapidated,
ruinous way it was altogether. I remember a Tower of the Winds that
might have been on the Roman campagna; and to the north there was
always the broad prospect of the great plain. It was but a short
walk from here to one of the modern gates of Tlemcen, that stands
on a higher level than Agadir; and just under it I came on the
mosque of Sidiâl-Halwi, or, as one would say, Englishing his name,
Saint Bonbon. In his mortal days he made sweetmeats for the
children, and the touch of a childâs story hangs about his legend.
When the wicked vizier beheaded him and his body was cast outside
the gate, it was said that in answer to the guardianâs nightly call
for all belated travellers to enter, the poor ghost would cry from
the outer darkness: âGo to sleep, guardian; there is none without
except the wretched Saint Bonbon.â The repeated miracle found the
ears of the Sultan and was verified by himself in person, and the
wicked vizier was at once sealed up alive in the neighboring wall,
which was conveniently being repaired at the time, and the body of
the saint was honorably laid in the shrine where it still reposes
in the shelter of another of those secular treesâa carob, this
time; and duly the mosque rose hard by with its fair minaret, on
whose faces still the brown and yellow tones of the
half-obliterated faience duskily shine in the sun. I entered under
the portal, partly sheathed in the same weather-battered colors,
with touches of blue and green, relics of an older beauty, and I
rested there an hour about, under the fretted wooden ceilings,
untwining the sinuous arabesque patterns of the arcaded walls,
cooling my eyes with the translucent onyx columns of the naveâlow
columns with Moorish capitals, whose gentle forms attested the
burning here ages ago of the lamp of art.

IV

A little
to the west of Tlemcen, and
almost adjoining it, stands another ruined city, Mansourah. I
rambled out toward it on a road alive with market-day bustle and
travel, where the country people were arriving in groups with
produce and beasts of burden, and the interest of the weekly
holiday in townâa rough, hard people, not at all like the
Tunisians, but doubtless of a more vital stock. The French cavalry
were exercising in the Great Basin that had once been like a lake
in that quarter of the city, a part of the water-works of the old
days. Almost as soon as I was beyond the gate I saw Mansourah lying
on the slope near by, well marked by its great ramparts, with
towers. It was the site of an immense fortified camp, where once a
Moroccan army had sat down to besiege Tlemcen, and had abode many
years in that great siege, and had built a city to house itself. At
one point began a paved road, and I passed down its well-worn,
smooth flags into the enclosure, which was wooded with olives, and
looked like a large orchard, showing spaces of strewn stone, some
rough, ruined masses, and on the far side a lofty single tower. The
fallen stones indicated the place of the palace, and the tower was
the minaret of the destroyed mosque. In those fighting days a siege
might consume a reign, and an army was a population; the march
might seem a migration; the army brought its women and children
along with it and the people who were necessary to its subsistence,
traders and the like, and established ordinary life on the spot; a
city grew up, and in this case, perhaps, throve especially on the
intercepted caravan trade that could no longer find its natural and
customary outlet through the besieged town; and if the war were
waged successfully the new city would swallow up the old one that
would fall to decay. So Tagrart, long before Tlemcen, had been the
camp over against Agadir, and, conquering, had become the new seat
of the city. The lot of Mansourah, however, was different; it did
not finally succeed, but Tlemcen in the end drove the plough over
the new city, exterminating it, and leaving only these ruins to be
the memorial of the event.

I found little of interest in the detail except that splendid
tower, which was a spectacle of ruin; it commanded the scene by its
single and solitary figure, and was imposing to the eye and to the
mind. It was a minaret, but of a different order from any I ever
saw. It stood in the middle of the faÃ§ade of the mosque, which was
entered by the central door of the minaret, massively crowned by
concentric arches over the portal; and this base was continued
above, in the upper stories, by a bolder and more solid
construction than usual, with ornamental details fitted to its
severe lines, with a balcony halfway up, and at the top a group of
small Gothic arches. It was thus more like a cathedral tower in
aspect, position, and use; and in its majestic ruin it seemed such.
The treatment of the surface, however, was altogether Moorish. The
material was a beautiful rosy stone; and, overlaid on this, one
still saw the half-obliterated green and blue lights of the
incrusted work like a dull peacock lining. The discreet relief of
this ceramic ornament on the rose stone, used as a ground and
having its own warm and massive effect in the harmony of tints,
must have made a superb example of that mosaic art of color which
treated great surfaces like a jewel box. But what a marvel it is to
find the camp of a horde of Berber tribes, in the confusion of a
fierce and bloody siege, a
foyer
of the great artsâof
architecture, delicate sculpture, and mosaic color! All those onyx
columns that have so delighted me were brought from these ruins and
reset in their new places in Tlemcen. What an interesting group of
impressions a few days had brought me, here! not one city, but a
nest of cities, like a nest of boxesâor like Troy, superposed one
on another: Pomaria, Agadir, Tagrart, Mansourah, Tlemcen. A
necropolis of saints; a mountain-pleasance of fountains, orchards,
grottos, the haunt of pigeons and fruits, rich in the privacy and
delights of country life; a land of campaigns, and Berber
dynasties, and sieges! I began to feel the inadequacies of my
schoolboy geography and college histories, the need of a new
orientation of my ideas to serve as a ground-plan for my knowledge
of the people and its past, the race-character; and, on my return,
I sought out the book-shopâan excellent oneâand purchased all the
little city could tell me about itself.

V

The
conversion of a people to a new
religion, notwithstanding the glory of apostolic legends, must have
always been largely a nominal change. The victorious faith takes up
into itself the customs and cardinal ideas, the habits of feeling
and doing, the mental and moral leaf-mould, as it were, of the old,
and it is often the old that survives in the growth under a new
name and in a new social organization. It was thus that Catholicism
re-embodied paganism, whether classical or heathen, without a
violent disturbance of the primeval roots of old religion with its
annual flowering of fÃªtes, its local worships, its sheltering
thoughts of protection in the human task-work, its adumbrations of
the world of spirits, its ritual toward the good and evil powers;
and the religion of Mohammed, sweeping over Africa on the swords of
Arab raiders and hordes, subdued the country to the only God, but
the Berber soul remained much as it had been, a barbarian soul,
still deeply engaged in fetichism, magic, diabolism, primitive
emotions, and ancestral tribal practicesâsuperstition; nor was this
the first time that the Berber soul had encountered the religion of
the foreigner, for pagan temples and Christian churches already
stood upon the soil. The faith of Mohammed was more fiercely
proselytizing; it was, moreover, of desert and tribal kin; and it
imposed its formulas and exterior observance more widely and
thoroughly than its predecessors.

The Berber race, nevertheless, was hard-bitted, obstinate,
independent; it was scattered over deserts and in mountain
fastnesses; its conversion was slow and remained imperfect in spite
of much missionary work on the part of the pious proselytizers from
the schools of Seville and Fez, who in later generations followed
the fiery conquerors to âKoranizeâ the rude mountaineers, such as
those of Kabylie, and settled beside them as daily guides and
teachers. Long after the first conquest Christianized Berbers and
other dissident groups were to be found here and there, and were
tolerated. The elements of primitive savagery held their own in the
life of the people at large, just as pagan practice and thought
survived in southern Italy, and in the last century were easily to
be observed there; the Riff, in particular, was a stronghold of
magic; and everywhere beneath the thin Moslem veneer was the old
substratum of superstition embedded in an unchanging savage
heredity of mood, belief, and social custom. Fetichism persisted in
the mental habit of the people, and still shows in their addiction
to holy places, magical rites and modes of healing, charms and
amulets, and the whole rosary of primitive superstition.

The Berbers were also by nature a Protestant race; their
independent spirit quickly availed itself of every sectarian
difference, reform or pretension, to make a core of revolt, inside
the pale of the religion, against their foreign orthodox masters.
It was their way of asserting their nationalism against the Arab
domination; it was, essentially, a political manÅuvre. The first
great Moslem heresy, Kharedjism, instituted by the followers of
Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed, found the Berber tribes an army
flocking to its banners; and, afterward, wherever schism broke out
or a pretender arose, there were the Berbers gathered together. In
that world they were the opposition. Islam itself, by the example
of Mohammed, had shown the way; every tribe had its inspired
prophet, sooner or later; and one, at least, among them, the
Berghouaia, once most powerful in this region, had its own Koran,
specially received in the Berber tongue from the only God, whose
prophet in this instance was Saleh. The expectation of the Mahdi,
tooâthe last imam, who, having mysteriously disappeared, shall come
again to bring justice on the earthâa tradition that mounted to
Mohammed himself, was an incentive to his appearance; and inasmuch
as the prediction circulated under the popular formââthe sun shall
arise in the westââthe Berbers regarded themselves as the chosen
people among whom the Mahdi should arise. Under these conditions
there was no lack of Mahdis. One of them, the greatest, ObÃ©Ã¯d
Allah, the FatÃ©mide, built that lonely seaport of Mahdia on the
Tunisian coast, whence he extended his sovereignty over the Moslem
dominions from the Egyptian border to the Atlantic, including
Sicily, and warred on Genoa, Corsica, and Sardinia; but his son had
to contend with a prophet pretender, âthe man with the ass,â who
with a great following from the tribes maintained himself for a
while, until between his own new-found taste for fine horses and
the desire of the tribesmen to return to their own country, his
authority and the army melted away together, like snow in the
desert. It was a characteristic incident in Berber history.

The natural and various course of such events had ample
illustration in the Morocco country about Tlemcen. Edris, the last
alleged descendant of Ali, found refuge in this quarter on the
Atlantic edge of the Mohammedan world; the Berbers, after their
custom of rallying about a promising dissenter, soon had him at
their head; his son founded Fez, and the dynasty was prosperous and
glorious. Then a cloud appeared in the far south, a cloud of
horsemen with the veilâI suppose the blue veil that I associate
with the Touaregs, themselves doubtless the best living type of
that old horde of desert raiders. They mounted up from the borders
of Senegal, gathering masses of foot-followers as they went,
preaching a reform of faith and manners, breaking all musical
instruments, and cleansing the land; they were fighting Puritans of
their age and religion, establishing an austere life and a pure
form of the faith. So the princely Edrisides gave place to the
princely Almoravides, and their dynasty, too, was prosperous and
glorious, and extended its realm into Spain. Then rose the Mahdi.
In this instance he was Ibn Toumert, a Berber, lame and ugly,
small, copper-colored, sunken-eyed, who had schooled himself at
Cordova, and then, like Sidi bou-MÃ©dyen, warmed his enthusiastic
and mystic temperament in the oriental fires of Baghdat and Mecca,
and had returned along the cities of the African seaboard a
reformer, breaking winecasks and violins, and publicly reproaching
devout dignitaries for corruption of manners, even the reigning
prince of the Almoravides. He was soon the Mahdi, with a new Koran,
institutor of the sect of the Unity of God, which after his death
came to the throne of the country in the dynasty of the princely
Almohades. The students of Tlemcen had once sent one of their
number to the prophet with an invitation to come and teach them;
he, however, found himself ill at ease in the college, and soon
went away into hermitage among the mountains; but the youth
remained with him as his disciple and companion, and it was this
youth, Abd el-Moumin, who founded the new dynasty, like its
predecessors prosperous and glorious; and it was he who drove the
Normans out of their last stronghold at Mahdia, having extended his
power so far, and with his conquering arms brought the Andalusian
arts to Tunis. In the four centuries of this brief historic
surveyâfrom the eighth to the twelfthâa sectary, a reformation, and
a Mahdi were the initial points on which the great changes of the
government of the country turned.

It might seem that in this civilization politics was only
another form of religion; but, deeply engaged as political changes
were in religious phenomena, this is perhaps a superficial view. It
may also be maintained that the Berbers took no metaphysical
interest in dogma, and found in divergent sects and the incessant
agitation of unbridled religious enthusiasm only modes of
partisanship and levers of political ambition; their religion was,
at least, compatible with a vigorous secular life. On the theatre
of history religious events gave to politics their dramatic form,
at moments of crisis; but the religious life of the community is
not to be found in them, but rather in facts of more usual nature
and daily occurrence. The cardinal fact, and one that swallowed up
all the others, from this point of view, was the extraordinary
development of saint worship; its mortal efflorescence and
fossilized deposit, so to speak, was this strata of tombs, koubbas,
which cover the region. The Marabout, to give the saint his
peculiar designation, was a man bound to religion, and was called
the âfriend of Godâ; he was revered in his life, and in his death
he became the protector of the locality of his tomb, the
intermediary of prayer to Allah, whose personality he obscured and
tended to displace in practice. It was natural that the cult of
saints should flourish in such a superstitious population; and the
country itself, by its inaccessible characterâdesert and
wildernessâlent itself to hermit lives, to types of the religious
brooder and mystic, the solitary, with his dreams, illusions, and
trances. Religious consecration was also a protection in a country
of rapine and disorder, and a source of profit among a credulous
people. There was, indeed, in the circumstances everything to favor
such an order of men. It appears, also, that in the time of the
great exodus of the Moors from Spain, a considerable body of
fugitives, learned men, found refuge in the ZaouÃ¯a of
Saguiet-el-Hamra, a famous monastery in Morocco; and the labor of
these âmen of God,â pious and ardent, who seemed to be almost of
another order of beings between mankind and the divinity, is
sometimes assigned as the original source of the magnitude of the
development of saint worship in these regions. It was they who
âKoranizedâ the tribes, a body of missionary monks, educated,
devoted, with the traits of apostolic zeal and ascetic temperament.
There were Marabouts long before their day, but to them and their
example may be due the fact that the tombs, the holy koubbas,
increase toward the west, beyond Algiers and in Morocco, where they
âstarâ the earth.

The lives of the Algerian saints, of which many may be read, do
not differ materially from that kind of biography in any religion.
Every village has its patron saint, its âmaster of the country,â as
he was called, and, as at Tlemcen, one may oust another with the
lapse of time. The koubba was a shrine, a local hearth of religious
life and practice, and the worship of the shrine was the near and
warm fact in daily experience; the veneration of the Marabout
appears to hold that place in the hearts of the people where
religion is most human. The Marabout himself was of many types,
ranging from plain idiocy, as was the case of Sidi bou-Djemaa on
the hill above Mansourah, to the mystic height, the âpole of
being,â as was the case of Sidi bou-MÃ©dyen on the hill above
Agadir. He was miracle-worker, thaumaturgist, medicine-man, and
might be consulted for all human events, from cattle disease to
thief hunting; he was a preacher, a doctor of the law, an agitator,
a recluse, a madman, anything out of the common; and the story of
the legends runs the whole gamut of friar, anchorite, and fanatic
in all religious history. Women, in particular, gathered about him
and his shrine. In a region and civilization where there was no
effective mastery of authority or reason, given over to individual
initiative in a half-barbarized mental condition, such a
development was entirely natural; and the landscape itself is the
history and mark of itâthere is a koubba on every hilltop, in the
beds of the streams, on the slopes of the plainsâsometimes clumps
of them; in every prospect emerges the shining white cube of the
holy tomb.

The
secular phase of Berber life in
these ages is vividly illustrated in the person and career of
YarmorÃ¢sen Ben ZeiyÃ¢n, the founder of the first kingdom of Tlemcen.
He belonged to the tribe of Abd el-WÃ¢d, who, with their cousins,
the Beni-MÃ©rin, under the pressure of the Arabs of the second
invasion, came up from the desert and took possession of the coast,
the former about Tlemcen and the latter in Morocco. For many years
these tribes, under the Almohades, had exercised feudal rights over
the country; they came north in the spring and summer, and
collected tribute from the agriculturalists and townsmen, and
returned in winter to their desert homes with the supplies they had
thus obtained. Their rise has been termed, not inaptly, a
renaissance of the Berber race power, as, indeed, the entire
history of the Berbers was a series of explosions of national
force, succeeding each other in one or another place at long
intervals, but impotent to found a permanent political state.
YarmorÃ¢sen was of the type of Tamburlane; a simple Berber, he was
unable to speak Arabic, but he had military and organizing genius,
became chief and conqueror, and founded the dynasty with which the
glory of Tlemcen began. At the moment the Almohades were nearing
their fall. The country is described as in anarchy: everywhere the
spirit of revolt broke out, the people refused to pay taxes,
brigands infested the great routes, the officials were shut up in
the towns, the country people were without protection; the region
was at the mercy of its nomad masters. It was then that YarmorÃ¢sen
found his opportunity, seized independent power, and established
order such as was known to that civilization. He was a great man of
his race, brave, feared, honored, who understood the interests of
his people, political administration, and the art and ends of rule.
He reigned forty-four years, amid continuous war; he was defeated
early in his career by the ruler of Tunis, but the victor could
find no better man on whom to devolve the government than the foe
he had overthrown; and it is an interesting point to observe that
his ambassador of state, on this occasion, who made the treaty, was
his mother. He was respectful of the rights of courtesy, at least,
and won applause by his kind treatment of the sister and women of
the Almohad prince he overthrew, sending them back to their own
land under escort.

In the battle which marked the fall of the Almohades and the
independence of Tlemcen there were characteristic incidents. The
van of the march of the old princes was led by the Koran, one of
the earliest and most famous copies, which the Almohades had
captured from the Moors of Grenada and rebound and incrusted with
jewels; it was borne on a dromedary, and enclosed in a silk-covered
coffer surmounted by a beautiful palm; small flags fluttered from
the corners, while before it floated a great white banner on a long
staff. It was thus that the Almohades always went out to war. When
the two armies stood in battle order, the women on both sides ran
through the ranks with uncovered faces and by their cries,
gestures, and looks animated their warriors to fight. A similar
scene is described by a modern author in writing of a Kabyle
village feud; the battle-field, he says, was the dry bed of a
torrent, between two slopes; on the heights of the ravine on either
side stood the women, barefooted, bare-armed, uttering sharp cries
which crossed over the heads of the fighters. âThey are all there,
their mothers, their wives, their sisters, their daughters, serried
one against another like the flowers of a crown; even the widows
whose husbands were killed in the last spring combat, even the

rÃ©voltÃ©es
who had left their husbands declaring they would
no longer serve them,âall adorned and painted for the battle. Rich
or poor, young or old, beautiful as idols or disfigured by age and
suffering, they are all together, their arms interlaced, their eyes
wide and full of fire, at the foot of each village, a confused mass
of ornaments, bright colors and miserable rags, lifted by one
movement, erect with hate and terror.â The men charge, fire
point-blank, engage hand to hand with their yatagansââbetter a
hundred times die here than go back to the village, because their
women will that they should die.â It was such a scene when
YarmorÃ¢sen fought with the Almohad prince, Es-SaÃ¯d.

YarmorÃ¢sen was more than a fighter; he was an enlightened
governor. Tlemcen was then a double cityâAgadir and Tagrart, not an
arrowâs flight between them. Tagrart had been the âcampâ of the
invading Almoravides, who had taken Agadir, and as victor it was
now the city of the functionaries and government, while the
peopleâthe old inhabitantsâcontinued to live in Agadir. YarmorÃ¢sen
cared for both, and built the minaret of Agadir, and also that of
the grand mosque of Tlemcen, but he declined to inscribe his name
upon them, saying: âIt is enough that God knows.â He built other
public works and the city grew into a thriving capital, not only of
war, but of residence and trade, and also became famous for its
schools. Among other learned men whom his reputation as a protector
of the liberal arts attracted to his court was one, brilliant in
that century, Abou Bekr Mohammed Ibn Khattab, whose story
especially interested me. He was a poet, and commanded not only a
fine hand, but a beautiful epistolary style. YarmorÃ¢sen made him
the first secretary of state, and he wrote despatches to the lords
of Morocco and Tunis so elegantly composed that, says the Arabian
historian Tenesi, they were still learned by heart in his day; and
he adds that with this poet the art of writing diplomatic
despatches in rhymed prose ceased. The Berber prince deserves
grateful memory among poets as the last patron of a lost grace of
the art, not likely to find its renaissance ever; and they must
read with pleasure the starry and flowery titles with which the
chroniclers adorn his gloryâthe magnanimous, the lion-heart, the
bounteous cloud, the shining rose, the kingliest of nobles, the
noblest of kings, the well-beloved, the sword of destiny, the
lieutenant of God, crown of the great, Emir of the Moslems,
YarmorÃ¢sen Ben ZeiyÃ¢n.

He left a line of strong and brilliant rulers who were warriors
first of all, for the glorious age of Tlemcen was a period of
intense life, and the little city had often to battle for its
existence. It suffered reverses; not long after the death of
YarmorÃ¢sen a contemporary Arabian traveller thus depicts it: âThis
city is very beautiful to see, and contains magnificent things; but
they are houses without inhabitants, estates without owners, places
that no one visits. The clouds with their showers weep for the
misfortunes of the town, and the doves on the trees deplore its
destiny with their moaning cry.â Its recovery, however, must have
been rapid, for in the next reign Tachfin found time in the
intervals of war to build the Great Basin and a beautiful college,
and he reared also the minaret of the great mosque at Algiers.
These were the years of the life-and-death struggle with the
Beni-MÃ©rin, of which Mansourah is the monument. The great siege had
been sustained and the peril beaten back; but now the enemy
returned, and from a new Mansourah on the same site they directed
their attack so well that they took Tagrart, old TlemcenâTachfin,
the king, falling in battle. The victor, Abouâl-Hasen, was a worthy
conqueror and the founder of the artistic Mansourah, that I have
described, with its palace, its mosque, and its columns; he made
the new city his royal residence, over against Tagrart as Tagrart
had stood over against Agadir, and he adorned the suburbs of the
old city; he built the mosque and college of Sidi bou-MÃ©dyen, and
his son the mosque of our good Saint Bonbon; he was an art-loving
prince and a wide victor, magnificent in royal presents which he
exchanged with the Sultan of Egypt, and in all ways glorious; but I
remember him best as the conqueror who, after he had swept the
coast of Africa to the desert limit, returning, stood on that
solitary beach at Mahdia, that so impressed me, and âreflected on
the lot of those who had preceded him, men still greater and more
powerful on the earth.â But this domination of the Beni-MÃ©rin, who
after all were cousins, lasted only a score of years; and the line
of YarmorÃ¢sen came to its own again, in the person of Abou-Hammou,
of the younger branch. He had been born and bred in Andalusia, and
was an accomplished prince. He wrote a book upon the art of
government for the education of his son, which may be read now in
Spanish, and he was a great patron of learning; he built a
beautiful college, adorned with marble columns, trees and
fountains, for his friend, the sage Abou-ben-Ahmed, attended the
first lecture and endowed the institution with sufficient property
for its maintenance. He, too, labored in war; but the remarkable
trait of these princes of the rude Berber stock is that,
notwithstanding the state of instant and long-continued warfare in
which they held their lives and power, they were as great builders
as warriors, and unceasing in their patronage of learning and the
arts. This was the great age of the city in the reigns I have
touched on. A score of descendants carried on the rule through
another century to the scene of trade, war, and study that Leo the
African portrays in the city. He describes the various aspects of
this great market of the desert, its buildings, and especially its
four classes of citizens, merchants, artisans, soldiers, and
students. Of these last he says: âThe scholars are very poor and
live in colleges in very great wretchedness; but when they come to
be doctors, they are given some readerâs or notaryâs office, or
they become priests.â Alas, the scholarâs life! Doubtless it was
the same in YarmorÃ¢senâs time. It is a pathetic thing to me to
think of those thousands of poor free scholars, through
generations, seeking the light as best they could in this
university city, for such it wasâwhat a record of self-denial and
deprivation, of belief in the highest, of living on the bread of
hope! But it was all to endâthe old Tlemcenâwith the coming of the
Turk; he came in the peculiarly atrocious form of the pirate,
Aroudj, master of Algiers, who gathered all the young princes of
the old blood royal, a numerous band, and drowned them in the Great
Basin.

VII

In
the brilliant years of Tlemcen,
during which it was a spray of the flowering branch of Andalusian
art, what is most striking and remains on the mind with a touch of
surprise is the sense of the long and various contact of the Berber
world with inherited Mediterranean civilization. We are accustomed
to think of the north coast of Africa as a much-isolated country;
but no place in the world is ever so isolated as it may seem to be;
and the connection of the North African peoples with the centres of
Christian history was never broken from the first Christian ages.
Some Christian communities were encysted among the Berbers by the
first Arab invasion; in the tenth century there were still five
bishoprics among them. Charlemagne sent an embassy to Kairouan in
respect to the relics of some saint at Carthage, in the reign of
Ibrahim, the Aglabite, who received it with great splendor. The
trade of the country was of vast territorial extent, reaching the
Soudan and Central Africa and the furthest Mohammedan East; in the
eleventh century negotiations were entered into with the Papacy
with a view to attracting Christian merchants and markets.
En-Nacer, a prince of the Hammadites, sent presents to Gregory VII,
including all his Christian slaves. The contact with the Christians
as enemies, in Sicily, Spain, and on the sea, was incessant in the
period of Moslem power. Christians, too, made a part of the
mercenary troops of the Moslem armies; the Beni-MÃ©rin are said to
have had at one time twelve thousand such troops, and YarmorÃ¢sen
had two thousand, who mutinied and were slain; these were the last
of the Christian cavalry in Moslem pay.

Contact with the old civilization was still more intimate and
continuous toward the East in commerce and the arts. The Berber
tribes of the coast had contained artisans from Roman times; but
the Arabs were from the beginning dependent on civilization for all
articles of luxury, and, especially in their religious needs, for
the architectural arts. The mosque was built on the plan of
Byzantine churches, and the Greeks and Persians became the masters
of construction and decoration in building; Roman temples and
palaces and Christian churches were the quarries from which
materials were taken. The great mosque at Kairouan is âa forest of
columnsâ of antique make, and in this it is an example of a general
practice. Original building came slowly into being, and was rudely
imitative. The Andalusian art, as it is called, the special form in
which the Moorish genius embodied itself, was evolved in Spain, and
its history is incompletely made out; for although the Alhambra,
together with other examples at Seville and Cordova, is its most
perfect product, yet the art was developed also on the Moroccan
side of the strait, and its creations at Fez, MarrÃ¢keck, and other
points still await thorough examination and study. The examples at
Tlemcen belong to this African branch of the art, which was
patronized by the early king of Tlemcen, and was most illustrated,
perhaps, by the Beni-MÃ©rin prince in his reign at Mansourah; for
his predecessors at Fez had been rulers on both sides the strait,
and were, therefore, in more immediate contact with the sources of
the art, which, however, had already by reason of the emigrant
Andalusians made Fez a noble Moorish city. As compared with Fez,
Tlemcen was provincial.

The Berber princes ruled over a border state continually at war,
and their city retained the rudeness of the nomad life; they were
kings of a master-warrior caste among the other elements of the
population, but with a pride in public works and a delight in
decorative luxury, a capacity for civilization and elegance, which
transformed them into accomplished princes of Andalusian culture,
like their neighbors. In realizing their ambitions they were,
however, dependent on the aid of their neighbors; they obtained
both workmen, architects, and in some cases material already
wrought, from Spain, and especially from the lord of Andalusia,
Abouâl-WalÃ®d, who sent them the ablest artisans he could command.
The legend that the bronze plates of the door of the mosque of Sidi
bou-MÃ©dyen were miraculously floated there from abroad doubtless
contains the truth that they were brought from Spain. Some of the
tiles are of foreign manufacture. The art, whether in spirit,
style, or skill, is to be looked on as an importation, though it
achieved its works on the spot. It affords admirable examples, and
they are of uncommon purity, since each newcomer did not restore
and refashion older work in current modes of later skill or taste,
but left it, as the Arabs will, to its own decay; this art is seen,
therefore, very often just as it was in its first creation save for
the ravage of time.

It was not an art of structure, though at times, as in the tower
at Mansourah, it has structural nobility, or, as elsewhere, lines
of grace; neither the architects nor the workmen were expert
builders, and they treated structural elementsâthe column, the
arch, the domeâdecoratively; these were subordinated to a
decorative intention. The genius for decoration, however, found its
main channel in the treatment of surfaces, sometimes curved and
limited, but usually flat and spacious. It sprang rather from the
art of graving than of modelling, and flowered especially in the
lineâarabesque. The line was employed in a series of geometric
patternsâsquares, polygons, circlesâsymmetrically arranged, and
mingled with more or less distinctness; or in rectilineal or
curvilineal combinations that were also patterns, repeated
indefinitely; or in formalized script based on calligraphy. The
origins of this mode go far back into antiquity; but its
predominant use is the special trait of Moorish decoration. The
second main feature of the art was in its colorâmosaic. It is true
that the lineal decoration of plaster and wood was painted, in red,
blue, and olive-green, but this color has disappeared; for our
eyes, so far as color is concerned, it is the mosaic that has
survived; and here, too, the mosaic sometimes borrows its interior
designs from the patterns of lineal decoration. The origin of this
mosaic is also lost in antiquity; the art in one or another of its
forms had long been widely diffused in the Mediterranean world. The
Roman soil of Africa had been covered with mosaic floors, which may
still be seen in beautiful and varied collections of them at Tunis
and Sousse; Byzantine work, such as is found at Ravenna and in
Sicily, was a living art through the Middle Ages; and the
contemporary Persian manufacture of tiles and similar work passed
everywhere in the commercial world, and may be closely connected
technically with the art in Andalusia. It was for exterior
decoration that the mosaic faience was principally employed. The
motives of the lineal decoration are fewâdisks, stars, and the
likeâand in the floral design only the acanthus formalized is used;
similarly, the colors of the mosaic are fewâmanganese-brown, white,
copper-green, iron-yellow, rarely blue. The combination of these
few elementsâcolors and patternsâis unrestricted by any limit, they
are undefined by any form, they grow by accretion, and they thus
obtain and give the quality of the infinite, the illimitable, which
is the most obvious trait of the arabesque. It is an art that plays
with form only to escape from it, whether in color or in line.

The charm of this art does not lie merely in its perfect fitness
to its light and cheap materials, nor in its easy solving of its
own problems, but rather in its kinship to the Arab genius, its
response to the desert spirit. This is most deeply felt in the
mosques, where it is in contact with the gravest things in life.
The mosque is the plainest of sacred places, and delights a Puritan
soul. There are no images of humanized deities or deified men;
there is neither god nor saint nor mythic story; neither is there
any mystery of dogma or speculation to be told in symbolism of
material things; there is only unbodied and unformulated religious
awe, the worship of the spirit in the spirit. The art that defines
has here no function. The Western genius, master of life, is a
defining genius; the oriental way is differentâit is an effusion,
an expansion, an illimitable going forth. This art, too, with its
few motives, its paucity of fact, its monotony of structure, yet
issuing always on the illimitable, the infinite, resumes the
structure of the desert, which is similar in its elements and
effects, its composition and its sentiment. It is also completely
free from the burden of thought, the fatal gift of Western genius
with its hard definings, too avid of knowing, whose art is rather a
means to cage than to free the bird of life. It is an art
restorative of the senses in their own kingdomâwhether in line or
color, a pure joy to the eye, a âdisembodied joy,â too, as art
should be, full of abstraction, yet unconscious of anything beyond
the sensuous sphere. It is easy to sum its salient technical points
and to indicate its obvious affinities with the mosque, with desert
nature, with the Arab genius; but even though he see it, one cannot
easily appreciate it in its decay, nor well imagine it in its fresh
beauty, as a visible harmony for the soul, without some initiation
into the fundamental moods of the race for whom and of whom it was.
To me, nevertheless, the sight was a pure delight, as is the
memory; a nomad art it seemed, born of the desert and expressive of
it, an evanescence of beauty playing on fragile and humble
materials, as life in the desert is fragile and humble, and clad in
the evanescence of natureâlife not too seriously valued, sure of
speedy ruin, not worthy of too great outward cost.

VIII

I went
out into the night on my last
evening and wandered in the dark streets till the falling gleam of
a Moorish cafe drew me into its shadowy spaces, where I drank a cup
of coffee, listening to sudden snatches of native music and
observing the swarthy and stalwart Arabs where they were banked up
on a sort of high stage at my left. It was a characteristic but
dull and lifeless scene. At a later hour I visited the moving
pictures. The large, obscure shed was jammed full of rough-looking
men and boys, French soldiers in many colors, and Arabs in hanging
folds, with life-worn faces, often emaciated; but I noted as a
general characteristic that self-contained, self-reliant immobility
of countenance that is the type of border men; it was the crowd of
a frontier town. I went back to my hotel under the keen midnight
sky at last, thinking of the long and crowded life of the historic
past in this old caravanserai of the desert tribes, of the scenes
of which I had been readingâthe Koran-led army, the battle of the
women, the palace feasts, night-long, where pages swung rose
censers among the guests and the revelry ended with the morning
prayer; of the great figuresâthe scholar-saint, Sidi bou-MÃ©dyen,
the ascetic revolutionary, Ibn Toumert, the Berber shepherd boy who
found a kingdom, the world conqueror by the sea at Mahdia, the
young princes drowned; of the desert courage that had flashed here,
a sword from the scabbard, of the desert piety that had here flung
away the jewel of life a thousand times, of the generations of
desert idealists who in the crowded schools had walked the way of
light as it was vouchsafed to them; and in the waking reality of
the French border town, whose night scene had depressed me, it
seemed an Arabian dream.

I WOKE, in the train, on the high plateaus.
Dawnâsoft green and pallid gold, luminous, then dying under a heavy
cloud while faint pink brightened on the sides of the great
horizonâopened the lofty plain, boundless and naked, thinly touched
with tufts of vegetation; as far as one could see, only the
elementsâcolor, cold, swathing wild herbage on rugged soil; and far
off, alone, the haze of an abrupt mountain range. It was the steppe
beyond Khreider. The vast, salt chott of El-Chergui, that streaks
the middle of the steppe with its waste and quicksands, lay behind;
but its saline arms still clung to and discolored the surface, and
whitened the view westward with dull crystalline deposits. This
wide blanching of the gray and red soil striped and threw into
relief the rigid sceneâaridity, vacancy, solitude, from which
emerged the still grandeur of inanimate things. It was the
characteristic scene of the high plainsâa vague monotony, colored
with sterile features flowing on level horizons. As the train
ascended nature seemed still to unclothe and uncover, to strip and
peel the land; but not continuously. From time to time the steppe
lapsed back to a thicker growth of tough-fibred alfa, whose home is
on these plains, and bore other dry, sparse, darkish desert plants
upon reddish hummocks; on this pasturage distant herds of camels
browsed unattended, as on a cattle-range, in the wild spaces fenced
by rolling sands; then the climbing train would soon pass again
amid low dunes. Few stations, at long intervals; isolated, meagre,
they seemed lost in the spreading areas, mere points of supply; the
most important was but a village, with sickly trees; but they took
on an original character. They were fortified; obviously built for
defence, with sallies and retreats in their walls; guarded
casemates obliquely commanding all avenues of approach and the
walls themselves; doors that were meant to shut. It was a railway
in arms, a line of military posts, or blockhouses, as it were, on
an unsettled border. The sight gave a tang of war to the silence of
the uninhabited country, and reminded one of unseen tribes and of
the harsh frontier of Morocco over opposite, south and west. Slowly
the mountains sprang up; one had already drifted behind,
Djebel-Antar; and now the peaks of the Saharan Atlas, rising sheer
from the plain a thousand metres, lay on either hand, bold crests
and jutting rangesâDjebel-AÃ¯ssa on the left, the Sfissifa on the
right in the southwestern sky, Djebel-Mektar straight ahead. We had
passed the highest point of the line at an elevation of thirteen
hundred metres, and were now on the incline and rapidly approaching
the last barrier of the Sahara. We were soon at the foot of Mektar.
It was AÃ¯n-Sefra, an important military base.

But I did not think of war; to me AÃ¯n-Sefra is a name of
literature and has a touch of personal literary
devoir
; for
there in the barren Moslem cemetery, outside the decaying ksar, is
buried the poor girl who taught me more about Africa than all other
writers; she had the rare power of truth-telling, and lived the
life she saw; her books are but remnants and relics of her genius,
but she distilled her soul in themâone of the wandering souls of
earth, Isabelle Eberhardt. She was only twenty-seven, but years are
nothingâshe had drunk the cup of life. Here she died in the oued,
the torrent river whose bottom I was now skirting, a wide, dry
watercourse, strewn with stones, and with roughly indented banks.
It was dry now, but on these denuded uplands and surfaces, after a
rainfall, which is usually torrential, it fills in a moment with a
furious sweep and onset of waters; and thus a few years ago it rose
in the October night and tore away the village below the high
ground of the French encampment; and there she was drowned. The
echo of her soul in mine, long ago at Tunis, was the lure that drew
me here.

There, before my eyes, was the sight I had longed to see, just
as she had described it. I knew it as one recognizes a lighthouse
on a foreign coast, so single, so unique it wasâthe leap of the red
dunes up the defile, fierce as a sword thrust of the far desert
through the mountains. That was Africaâthe untamed wild, the
bastion of nature in her barbarity, the savage citadel of her
splendid forces to which man is negligible and human things
unknown. The dunes are golden-red, tossed like a stormy, billowing
sea; they charge, they leap, they impendâpetrified in air; an ocean
surf of red sand, touched with golden lights, frozen in the act of
the wild wind. They are magnificent in their lines of motion, in
their angers of color; but the spirit of them is their
Ã©lan
,
their drive, flung forward as if to ram and overwhelm the pass with
a wide sandy sea. The light on them is a menace; they threaten; nor
is it a vain threat; they move with the sure fatality of all
lifeless things, they will invade and conquerâa foe to be reckoned
with; and to fend the valley against them, man takes a garden,
trees, plantations, advancing a van of life against all that
lifelessness. It is a superb picture there, among the mountains, a
symbol of the struggleâthe long battle of vegetable and mineral
forces, clothing and desolating the planet; and it holds the rich
glow of the African temperament, a spark of the soul of the
land.

The train winds on in the bright morning air by a shining
koubba, dark palm tufts, and the high, silent tricolor, and goes
down the oued, turns the mountain, passes into the rocks, a strange
scene of stormy forms and sterile colors, and makes from valley to
valley by sharp curves, from oued to oued by deep cuts, piercing
and grooving its passage to lower levels through the range of the
ksour. Almost from the first it is unimaginable, that landscape. It
is all rock in ruins, denuded and shivered, shelving down,
disintegrating; fallen avalanches of rotten strata; every kind of
fracture; whole hills in a state of breaking up into small pieces,
pebbly masses, bitten, slivered. We traverse broken, burnt fields
of it, all shingle; expanses of it so, beneath walls cracked and
scarified; we curve by scattered bowlders of all sizes and
positions, down valleys of stones; new hills open, sharp-edged,
jaggedâcontinuous rock. All outlooks are on the waste wilderness
crumbling in its own abandonment; all contours are knife-edges; the
perspectives are all of angles. In the near open tracts lie relics
and remains, mounds, mountains, and hills that have melted away;
steep lifts on all curves; and on the sky horizon, following and
crossing one another, saw-toothed ranges, obliquely indented with
sharp re-entries, or else acute cones and rounded mamelons: the
whole changing landscape a ruin of mountains being crumbled and
split and blown away. It is an elemental battle-field, where the
rock is the victimâa suicide of nature. In this region of extreme
temperatures with sudden changesâburning noons and frozen nights,
torrid summers and winter snows, downpours of rainfallâthe fire and
frost, wind and cloudburst have done their secular work; they have
stripped and pulverized the softer, outer rock shell, washed it
down, blown it away, till the supporting granite and schist are
bare to the bone. It is a skeletonized, worn land, all apex and
dÃ©bris; near objects have the form and aspect of ruins, the
horizons are serried, the surfaces calcined. It is an upper world
of the floored and pinnacled rock, an underworld shivered and
strewn with its own fragments, a âgray annihilationââof the color
of cinders. I imagine that the landscapes of the moon look
thus.

A mineral world, bedded, scintillant, flaked. It is dyed with
color. All life has gone from it, and with the departure of life
has come an intensification, an originality, an efflorescence of
mineral being. The earlier stages of the rideâthe red mountains
striped beneath with black, beyond the middle ground of a
prevailing reddish tint sparsely scattered with a vegetation of
obscure greens and dull grays amid strong earth colors, once with
the bluish-black of palm-trees blotting the distanceâI remember now
almost as fertility. Here there is not a leafânor even earth nor
sand. It seems rock devastated by fire, like volcanic summits. A
sombre magnificence, a fantastic grandeur! Blue-grays, browns, and
ochres of every shade gleam on the slopes of the hillsides; reds
splash the precipices and walls; innumerable, indescribable tones,
too gloomy to be called iridescence, shimmer over the mid-distance
and die out in twilights of color amid the manganese shadows, on
the cold limestone heights, in the sandstone gullies. Where I can
see the surfaces of the shivered stones, I notice their
extraordinary smoothness. There are purples and black-greens and
violets among them, but for the most part they are black, like
soot; for amid this fantastic coloration, what gives its sombreness
to the sceneâthe trouble of the unfamiliarâand grows most menacing,
is the black. The land is oxidizedâblackened; its shivered floor is
strewn with black stones; black stripes streak its sides far and
near; amid all that mineral bloom it is to black that the eye
returns, fascinated, enthralled. It invades the spirits with its
prolonged weirdness; it awes and saddens. And all at once we emerge
from a deep ravineâoh,
la belle vie!
âa sea of dark verdure
makes in from below, like a fiord, among the naked mountains round
itâsilent, mysterious, living, the green of the palm oasis; and
swiftly, after that stop, we dip into the black gorges beyond
Moghrar, more sombre, sinisterâvalleys of the color and aspect of
some strange death, the incineration of nature in her own secular
periods, the passing of a planet. Slowly vegetation beginsâtufts
amid the rock interstices, desert growths, the
chaufleur
saharienne
, the drin, the thyme, plants of ashen-gray, stiff,
sapless; trees nowâbetoums, feeble palms; a beaten track with a
trio of Bedouin Arabs. It is the oued of the Zousfana; and we
debouch on the far prospectâoff to the right the oases of Figuig,
oblong dark spots on the foot-hills of Morocco, and before us to
the left the great horizons of the Sahara, the
hamada
. Five
hours from AÃ¯n-Sefra. It is Beni-Ounif.

I descended from the train amid groups of soldiers. I lose my
prejudice against a uniform when it is French or Italian; and in
North Africa the blue of the tirailleur, the red of the spahi, are
a part of the
mise en scÃ¨ne
. These were soldiers of the
Foreign Legion. I had been familiar with their uniform, too, in the
north at Oran, and particularly at Sidi-bel-Abbes, one of their
rendezvous; and I saw it again with friendly eyes, for all that I
had hereâharborage, security, freedom to come and goâdid I not owe
it to them? The Sud-Oranais is their work, like so much else in
Algeria. I trudged through the sand, a young Arab tugging at my
baggage and guiding me, to the hotel, which occupied a corner of an
extensive flat building of Moresque style, rather imposing with its
towers though it was only of one story, on a street that seemed
preternaturally wide because all the buildings were likewise of one
story. The whole little town, a mere handful of low, fragile
blocks, looked strangely desolate and lonesome, forsaken, isolated,
dull. The host received me pleasantlyâI was the only guest to
arrive, and there was no sign of another occupantâand took me to my
room in the single corridor; it was clean and sufficientâa bed, a
basin, and a chair; a small, heavily barred window, at the height
of my head, looked on a large, vacant court. So this was the

terre perdue
. I was âfar away.â âThe brutality of lifeââ I
was âclean quitâ of it, like a lark in the blue, like a gull on the
gray sea. â
Adieu, mes amis,
â I thought. Where had I read
itââThe man who is not a misanthrope has never loved his fellow
men.â

There was a knock at my door: âMonsieur, some one to see you.â
It came with a shock, for the solitude had begun to seize me. I
went toward the office. A young soldier of the Legion approached
me, full of French grace, with a look of expectancy on his fine
face. âI heard there was an American here,â he said in English; âI
did not believe it,â he added; âI came to see.â âYes,â I said, âI
am an American.â âThere hasnât been one here in two yearsânot since
I came,â he spoke slowlyâkeen, soft tones. âSouth American?â he
ventured. âNo,â I said, melting. âTruly from the United
Statesâwhere?â His look hung on my face. âI was born near Boston,â
I replied, interested. âI was born in Boston.â I shall never forget
the gladness of his voice, the light that swept his eyes. A quick,
soldierly friending seized usâthe warmth that does not wait, the
trust that does not question. In ten minutes he was caring for me
like a younger brother, introducing me with my letters at the
Bureau Arab, doing everything till he went to his service. In the
evening we met again, and so the lonely journey of the day ended in
an African sunset, as it were, of gay and brilliant spirits, for I
know of no greater joy than the making of friends. He was of French
parentage, and the only American in the Legion; at least, he had
never seen nor known of another. And I went to bed thinking of the
strange irony of life, and how the first thing that the
terre
perdue
gave me was the last thing I expected in the wide
worldâa friend.

II

I went
by myself to visit the old ksar,
the native village which had occupied this site before the coming
of the French and the rise of the new town about the railway. It
lay some little distance to the west of the trackâa collection of
palm-trees, with a village at the farther end, backed by a white
koubba. My Arab boy, who had never lost sight of me, had me in
charge, and led the way. We crossed into the strip of barren
country and saw the ksar with its palmerai before us, like a rising
shoal in the plain. Accustomed as my eyes are to large horizons,
this country had an aspect of solitariness that was extraordinary.
The sand-blown black rock, the
hamada
, lies all about; the
mountains of the Ksour that back the scene to the northeast are
reddish in color and severe in outline, and the mountains of
Morocco, cut here by three passes, block it to the north and west
with their heavy and wild masses, while other detached heights are
seen far off to the south. From this broken ring of bare mountains,
red and violet and gray, the rocky desert floor, blown with reddish
sand, makes out into the open distance interminably to horizons
like the sea. In the midst of this the little ksar with its
trailing palm-trees, Beni-Ounif with its slender rail and station,
its white redoubt and low buildings, with the Bureau Arab and its
palms a little removed, seem insignificant human details, mere
markings of animal life, in a prospect where nature, grandiose in
form and without limit in distance, exalted by aridity, is visibly
infinite, all-encompassing, supreme. The sun only, burning and
solitary, seems to own the land. The moment one steps upon the
windy plain it is as if he had put to sea; he is alone with nature,
and the harshness of the land gives poignancy to his solitude.

We walked over rough ground awhile, and then crossed the dry bed
of a oued, one of the channels that in time of flood lead the
waters down to the Zousfana, whose shrunken stream flows in its
wide rocky bottom some distance to the north of the ksar toward the
mountains; and we climbed up on the farther side by crumbling
footpaths that run on little uneven ridges of dry mud, twisting
about in a rambling way, with small streams to cross, which groove
the soil; and so we came into the gardens. The aspect, however, is
not that of a garden; the background of the scene is all dry mud,
whose moulded and undulating surface makes the soil, while the
little plots are divided by mud walls, high enough at times to give
some shade and meant to retain the irrigating waters. There are a
few patches of barley, very fresh and green; but for the most part
the plots are filled with treesâfig-trees, old and contorted, with
their heavy limbs, the peach and almond with fragile grace and new
tender green, the pomegranate and the apple, and rising above them
the palms whose decorative forms frame in and dignify the little
copses of the fruit-trees, and unite them; but the dry mud makes an
odd contrast with the branching green of varied tints and gives a
note of aridity to the whole under scene. The plots vary only in
their planting, and were entirely deserted. We came through them to
the ksar itself with its wall. It is built of dry mud, which is the
only material used here for walls and houses alike. The rain soon
gives them a new modelling at best, and this ksar is old and
ruined, half abandoned now that the French town is near. The outer
wall is much broken, with the meandering shapelessness of abandoned
earthworksâscallops and indentations, the smooth moulding and mud
sculpture of time on the golden soil; and off beyond it stretches
the endless cemetery, with the pointed stones at the head and foot
of the graves, a tract of miserable death, so simple, naked, and
poverty-struck, and yet in such perfect harmony with the sterile
and solitary scene, that it does not seem sad but only the natural
and inevitable end. It belongs to the desert; it is its comment on
the trivial worthlessness of human life, whose multitude of bones
are heaped and left here like the potterâs shard. The sun beats
down on the wide silence of that cemetery; the sand blows and
accumulates about the rough stones that seem to lie at random;
there is no distinction of persons there, no sepulchral apparelling
of the mortal fact, no illusion, no deception; it is the
graveââwhither thou goest.â And it is not sadâno more than the
naked mountains of the Ksour, the dark Morocco heights, the silent
sunlight; it is one with themâit is nature. On its edge toward the
ksar rises the koubba of the saint, Sidi Slimanc bou-Semakha, the
ancient patron of the country; it is the only spot of this old
Moslem ground that no infidel foot has trod; there his body reposes
in its wooden coffin, hung with faded silks within its carved rail
in the white chamber, secluded and sacred, and the faithful sleep
in the desert outside. It is a world that has passed away.

The ksar itself was like all others in this region. They are
walled villages adjoining the palmerai that feeds them; the houses
are built of sun-baked earth supported on small palm beams and lean
serried one upon another in continuous lines and embankments;
narrow alley ways and passages honeycomb them, often with a roofing
of the same palm beams, so that one walks in underground obscurity;
externally, owing to their old and weather-worn aspect, they have a
general ruinous look. The walls on the street are blind; here and
there in dark corners a seat for loungers is hollowed out in the
side; there is somewhere a square for judgment where is the
assembly of the elders, and by the mosque or koubba an open space.
There is always a life outside the walls, a place for market, for
caravans to stop, encampments of all sorts. All have a look of
dilapidation. But this old ksar had more than that; it was
obviously in a state of ruin and abandonment. Walls had fallen,
exposing the wretched interiors, cave-like, mere cellarage. There
was no one there. I passed through some of the covered waysâblank
obscurity, with holes of naked sunlight. I did not see half a dozen
living figures; they were unoccupied, listless, marooned. It was
stillâa stillness of death. I found the sources, the underground
streams that supply the little oasis; there were three or four
young negro girls standing in the water in discolored bright rags;
they pointed out to me the blind fish in the water. â
Câest
dÃ©fendu
,â said my Arab boy when I asked him to catch one. Life
seemed
dÃ©fendu
. The air was moribund. It was a decadence of
the very earth. I was glad to have the hot sun on my back again by
the tall palms and green fruit-trees springing out of their dry-mud
beds, and I sat down on a crumbling wall, amid the amber
deliquescence of the rich-toned soil, and looked back on that
landscape of decay, and sought to reconstruct in fancy the desert
life of its silent years.

It was an old human lair. Its people, the
ksouriens
, who
lived here their half-underground life, sheltered from the burning
blasts of the summer sun and the bitter winds of winter, were a
settled townfolk, with their oasis agriculture and simple desert
market. The ruling race were the descendants of some Marabout; for
the Moslem saint was a patriarch, and one finds whole villages that
claim to be originated from some one of them; these men were the
proprietors of the gardens, which were tilled by native negroes or
Soudanese slaves and their progeny, a servile breed; and there were
Jews, who were compelled to live apart, a pariah caste. Outside
were the Berber and Arabized nomad tribes, scattered and living in
fractions, who went from place to place for the pasturage of their
flocks; their chiefs and head men were desert raiders, who took
toll by tribute or pillage of the caravans traversing their
country, and made forays on their neighbors; the people of the ksar
held a feudal relation to these desert lords. The most secure units
of property in the land were the zaouias, or monasteries, bound to
hospitality and charity, and ruled by Marabout stocks; their
gardens and flocks had a protective character of sacredness, the
goods of God. Society was in a primitive form of uncohering
fragments, very independent, self-centred, uncontrolled; though it
was of one faith, hostility pervaded it; feuds were its annals; it
had pirate blood. A pastoral, marauding, sanguinary world, with
elements of property and aristocracy, but democratic within itself,
with slaves and outcast breeds; a world of simple wants but always
half submerged in misery; a world of the strong arm. In such a
world the
ksouriens
lived here by the mountain passes. They
saw those old nomad tribes go by that mounted to Tlemcen and drank
the bright cup of the Mediterranean for a season; but the

ksouriens
had forgotten them; their passage was only a
wrinkling of the desert sand. Caravans stopped by the brown walls;
raiders rode by to the desert; the seven ksars of Figuig fought
petty wars, one on another, on the hill opposite; mountain women
pitched their striped tents by the cemetery wall; the Jews worked
at little ornaments of silver and coral; there was a coming and
going to the fountain, secret and ferocious love, the woe of
poverty and hateâthe Arab life of violence and ruse and silence, in
the palm gardens, the underground passages, the darkened streets; a
life of obscurity and somnolence; and the
ksouriens
grew
pale like wax, with their black beards and corded turbans, and the
old Arab vitality melted in their bones. The hours that no man
counts rolled over the languid ksar, where white figures sat in the
seats in the earthen wall along the covered streets in the silence;
the unborn became the living and the stones multiplied in the
cemetery; and there was no change. I could almost hear the bugle
note yonder that brought a new world of men. And now the ksar was
dead.

The moon, almost at the full, was growing bright in the eastern
sky; the mountains of the Ksour, that still took the setting sun,
glowed with naked rock, rose-colored; on the left the mountains of
Figuig lay in black shadow, with the violet defiles between,
clear-cut on the molten sky. As I stepped on the rise of Beni-Ounif
it was already night; the brilliant white moon flooded the hard
landscape with winter clarity; the unceasing wind blew cold. It was
a solemn scene.

III

â
Monsieur
, le spahi.â I went out in the
early morning air and found my escort for Figuig, a tall, dark
Arab, almost black, his head capped with a huge turban wound with
brown camelâs rope in two coils, and his form robed in a heavy
white burnoose that showed his red trousers beneath; he held two
horses, one tall and strong, for himself, the other, smaller and
lighter, a mare, for me. My friend soon joined us with his mount,
and, glancing at my mare as I also mounted, warned me not to rein
her in straight with that bit, as it was thus that the Arabs
trained their horses to rear and caper, and a strong pull might
bring her up unexpectedly on her hind legs, and that, he said, was
all I need be careful about. We trotted off easily enough down the
street toward the railway, and in a few moments turned the last
building and were on the route westward over the open plain. The
old ksar lay far off to the left, the Zousfana to the north, and
between was the unobstructed stretch of the rocky
hamada
,
herbless and strewn with small and broken stones, to where we saw a
line of straggling palms beneath the Morocco hillside. The air was
brisk and coolâjust the morning for a gallop. The temptation was
too great for my mare, who showed no liking for her neighbors, and,
after a few partly foiled attempts, struck boldly off the trail to
the left. I minded my instructions and had no desire to see what
she could do on her hind legs. I had neither whip nor spur. I gave
her her head. I was likely to have a touch of the Arab

fantasia
, and I did. I settled myself hard in the saddle as
she flew on; she was soon at the top of her speed; it was the
gallop of my life. Her feet were as sure as they were fleet on the
pathless, rocky plain; she avoided obstacles by instinct; and if
she came to a dry, ditch-like channel now and then that cut the
level, with a slight retardation for the spring she jumped it, as
if that were the best of all. But it was a pace that would end.
After a mile or so she breathed heavily, and I, seeing some Arab
tents pitched not far away, turned her toward them, thinking she
might regard it as a friendly place, and so brought her up quite
blown and with heaving sides. Three or four Arabs, very friendly
and curious, ran up, and I dismounted. â
MÃ©chante, mÃ©chante
,â
they kept saying; and I looked at the shallow glitter of the mareâs
eyes, as she turned them on me to see the rider she had got the
better of, and for my part I said â
Furbo
ââsomething that I
learned in Italy. My friend came riding up after a little to know
where I was going, and said he thought I was âhaving a little funâ;
and the spahi rode in, and, dismounting, also with a
â
mÃ©chante
â changed horses with me. I said good-by to the
friendly Arabs, and we rode off straight north to the route from
which I had involuntarily wandered; but it was a fine morning
gallop.

We came without further incident to the line of scattered palms,
amid a very broken country, where the ascent makes up to Figuig,
enclosed in a double circle of walls. Figuig is the name of the
whole district. It includes a lower level where is the ksar of
Zenaga and its vast palmerai, and a higher level on which are
scattered the other six ksars amid their gardens. All are built of
sun-dried mud, as are also the two walls, the inner being furnished
with round towers at frequent regular intervals. We went on amid a
confusion of gardensâfruit-trees with vegetables under them, such
as beans and onions, and plots of bright barley in the more open
places, but mostly palms, with little else, all springing out of
the dry mud; we were past the ruinous-looking stretches of the
brown, sunbasking wall, and began to be lost in a narrow canyon, as
it were, up which the rude way went between the enclosed gardens.
There was hardly width for our horses as we rode in single file on
the uneven, climbing path that seemed something like the bed of a
torrent, and indeed every now and then water would break out from
underground and pour down like a cascade or swift brook, with a
delicious sound of running streams. On either side the garden walls
rose a great height far over our heads, and above them brimmed
branches of fruit-tree tops with the splendid free masses of palms
hanging distinct and entire in the bit of blue. We seemed to be
walled out of a thick, fertile, and beautiful grove; but they had
only the same dry mud for their bed that was under our feet in the
narrow, tortuous way. The sun had begun to be hot before we left
the plain, and now, in spite of the shelter of the walls, the heat
began to make itself felt; there was the dust of the country, too,
which, slight as it was that day, is omnipresent; so, being both
very thirsty, my friend and I dismounted at a place where the
running water came fresh from the yellow ground, and we drank a
very cooling draught of its brown stream. It is the scene that I
remember best. It was like a defile in a narrow place; the way
broadened here by a bend in the steep ascent; one saw the brimming
gardens below, and the view was closed above by the turn of the
walls; and there, in the hollow, my friend and I leaned over the
cascading water and, turning, saw the spahi, as he tightened the
girths of my saddle which had loosened, under those walls, brown in
the shadow and an orange glow in the sun, with the spring green
starred with white blossoms like a tender hedge above their yellow
tops, and the leaning palms in the blue. It had a strange charm;
and the water made music, and it was solitude, and everything there
was of the earth, earthyâand beautiful.

We came out shortly at the top of the ascent in an open space
before a round archway in a wall, and dismounted in a scene of
Moors passing in and out, whom I photographed; and then we walked
on through the low-browed little street, which offered nothing
remarkable except its strangeness, and found ourselves at the other
side on a high rocky floor, quite mountainous in look, stretching
off and off nowhere, which is the neutral ground lying about all
the ksars; it looked as if the sun and wind had worn it out, and it
had a rugged grandeur; a distant horseman on it seemed uncommonly
tall and as solitary as a ship at sea. I got a slim palm wand from
a group of Arab boys to use as a switch; but my show of copper coin
drew some beggars about me, very insistent, and when we mounted and
rode off stones followed us. I have been stoned in various parts of
the world and did not mind. The spahi, however, after the incident,
took up his station behind. We soon reached another wall with a
gate, on one side the inevitable cemetery, with its pointed stones,
and on the other the Morocco army in the shape of a small squad of
soldiers in soiled gorgeousness, lying about on the ground near
their guard-house. They did not have a very military appearance,
and paid no attention to us as we rode into the ksar and struck the
narrow street, which was the main thoroughfare. It was quite
animated, with many passers-by, whose oriental figures were sharply
relieved on the walls in the sun or grew dark in the shadow. The
houses were low, one against another, and their wall space was
broken only by rude doors; here and there were higher buildings,
often with little oblong windows aloft, with the effect of a ruined
tower, or broken-arched faÃ§ade, or square donjon; but these
elements were rare, though at times they gave an architectural

ensemble
to little views against the sky with their fine
shadows. Poor habitations they are, dilapidated and meagre they
look, forlorn and melancholy to the mind, rubbishy, tumble-down,
and ruinous to the eye; yet the air of ancientry everywhere
dignifies the poor materials, and the sun seems to love them; human
life, too, clothes them with its mysterious aura. The crude object
partakes of the light it floats in, and every impression fluctuates
momentarily through a whole gamut of sense and sensibility; for
there is a touch of enchantment in all strangeness.

We dismounted in the middle of the street, half blocking the way
with our horses, by a cafÃ©, whose proprietor, a humble and
life-worn old man, set himself to prepare us a cup of the peculiar
Morocco tea that is flavored with mint. There were a few
passers-by, and I busied myself with my camera. The cafÃ© was a mere
hole in the wall, of preternatural obscurity, considering its small
size and shallow depth; the furnace and the teakettle seemed to
leave hardly room for the old Arab to move about. I found a
camp-stool and sat down opposite the low, dark opening, and, the
tea being ready, was drinking it with much relish; it was truly
delicious with its strong and fragrant aroma of mint, and was also
uncommonly exhilarating. I was thus engaged when two particularly
ill-favored Moors, each with a long gun over his shoulder,
appeared, and planted themselves, one on either side behind my
shoulders, as close as they could get without actually pressing
against me, and gazed stolidly and fixedly down at me. I paid no
attention to them, but drank my tea, and from time to time dusted
my leather leggings with my little palm wand. It was a picturesque
group: my friend in his shining white uniform, unarmed, leaning
carelessly against the wall in the sun, the tall spahi opposite in
the shade regarding us, the two Moors hanging over me motionless,
and no one said a word. After a while they seemed to have had
enough of it, and went away with a sullen look.

We said good-by to our host and walked on, the spahi following
on horseback at a distance of several yards, well behind, and two
boys leading our horses. We were soon in the covered ways, where it
was often very dark; we met hardly any oneâa negro boy or a woman;
the doors were shut, and it was seldom that one left ajar gave a
scant view of the interior; narrow alleys ran off in all
directions, down which one looked into darkness; but if we stopped
to peer into them, or showed curiosity, the metallic voice of the
spahi would come from behind, â
Marchez
,â and at the frequent
turnings of the way he called, in the same hard voice, â
Ã
droite, Ã  gauche
â; and so we made our progress through those
shadowy vaults, silent, deserted, in the uncertain light. It was
like a dead city, motionless, hypnotized, as if nothing would ever
change there, with a sense of repose, of negligence of life, of
calm, as if nothing would ever matter; occasionally there were
figures in the recesses sunk in the wall, silent,
motionlessâdreamers; one white-bearded old man, seated thus under
an archway in a dark corner, seemed as if he had been there from
the beginning of time and would be found there on the judgment-day.
It was weird. We turned a corner in the darkness and came on a
large groupâperhaps a scoreâof young children at play in the middle
of the street. I never saw such terror. They fled, screaming, in
all directions, swift as wild animals; it was a panic of such
instant and undiluted fear as I had never imagined. I cannot forget
their awful cry, their distorted faces, their flight, as if for
life, the moment they caught sight of us; it was a revelation.

A few minutes later we came out on a crowded square, full of
shops, men working at their trades, others lying full length on the
ground; it was a small but busy placeânot that much was being done
there, but there were people, and occupations, and human affairs.
It was the gathering seat of the assembly of the elders, before
whom the affairs of the ksar are brought for judgment. No one paid
us the slightest attention; and after looking at the little stocks
of leather and grains and odds and ends, and glancing at the
reclining forms that gave color and gravity to the ordinary scene
of an Arab square, we entered again on the darkness and somnolence
of the winding streets, where there was no sun nor life nor sound,
but rather a retreat from all these things, from everything violent
in sensation or effort or existence; places of quiet, of cessation,
of the melancholy of things. We emerged by a mosque, and near it a
cemetery on the edge of the ksarâsuch a cemetery as they all are,
blind, dishevelled heaps of human ruins marked by rough, naked
common stones, the desertâs epitaph on life, inexpressibly
ignominious there in the bright, bare sunlight. We mounted and rode
down through gardens, as at first, on a ridge that commanded now
one, now another view of the palm and orchard interiors with their
dry beds, a strange mixture of barrenness below and fertility
above, a rough but pleasant way; and all at once we saw the great
palmerai stretching out below us in the plain, like a lake bathing
the cliff, a splendidness of dark verdure; black-green and
blue-black lights and darks filled it like a seaâcool to the eye,
majestic, immense, magnificent in the flood of the unbounded
sunlight, a glory of nature. It was a noble climax to the strange
scenes of that morning journey; and soon after we dismounted to
make the steep descent on the gray-brown rock of the cliff. The two
boys, who had rejoined us, brought down our horses, and we left the
half-fallen towers and crumbling walls in their yellow ruin behind
us, with the young Arabs still looking, and rode through the hot
desert to Beni-Ounif.

This was the mysterious Figuig of old travellers. I had seen it,
but it still seemed to me unrealized, though not unreal. A vision
of palm-topped garden walls on crumbling mountain paths; of a
wind-blown, sunburnt high plateau; of a sun-drenched gully of a
street with a strange-windowed, lonely ruin looking down on horses
that hang their heads; a maze of darkened passages with a sense of
lurking in the shadows, of decay in the silence, of apparition in
the rare figures; a closed city of hidden streams and muffled
noises, walled orchards and shut houses, sunless ways, yet held in
the sunâs embrace, the high blue sky, the girdling mountains, the
open desert; and with its stern and rocky gardens of the dead, too;
a soil and a people made in the image of Islam, impregnated with
it, decrepit with it, full of lassitude and melancholy and doom,
mouldering away; yet set amid living fountains, lighted by placid
reservoirs where the tall palms sun themselves in the silent waters
as in another sky; queen, too, of that dark-green sea of the
palmerai, a marvel of nature; and last a vision of long-drawn walls
and dismantled towers crumbling in the red sun. It is so I remember
it; and it seems rather a mirage of the desert imagination than a
reality, a memory.

IV

Beni-Ounif
was dull. There was nothing
interesting there except the
mise en scÃ¨ne
. It was pleasant
to be dining with officers, for they were the principal patrons of
the hotel, with whom stars and crosses were as common as
watch-guards in New York; and it was stimulating to see the ensigns
of the Legion of Honor where they were something more than the
international compliment of a ribbon twisted in a black buttonhole
and had their heroic meaning, a decoration on an officerâs breast.
The crosses I saw stood for acts of bravery on the field of battle.
There were a few other guests who came and went, a French hunter, a
Belgian professor who told me of the prehistoric cabinets he had
seen farther south, an officerâs remarkable collection, and
explained to me the geology of the Sahara in brief and interesting
lectures. The town itself never lost for me the vacant and
makeshift frontier look that it had at first sight; one could walk
from end to end of it in a few minutes and come out on the desert,
which was monotony petrified. Nothing happened except the arrival
and departure of the daily train. Once I met on the edge of the
desert the
goum
, a compact small body of native Arab cavalry
attached to the French arms, a splendid squad of fighting men;
rather heavy and broad-shouldered they looked, wrapped in burnoose
and turban, mature men whose life was war, black-bearded,
large-eyed, grimâpredatory faces; and they were in their proper
place, with the naked mountains round and the desert under their
horsesâ feetâa martial scene of the old raiding race. I should not
like to see them at work, I thought; their trade is blood, and they
looked itâstrong, hard, fierceâpitiless men. But usually there was
nothing uncommon to my eyes. Once in the cafÃ©, where we sat over
our long glasses of the fortified liquors and tonic drinks of which
there is so great a variety in desert towns, some one brought in a
beautiful great dead eagle. It was as if he had been killed in his
eyrie to see him there on the desert among the soldiers. We
returned to our glasses and our talk: tales of Paris, tales of
Odessa in the Revolution, tales of long Algerian rides, encounters,
anecdotes of the roadâwhat tales! And other menâs tales,
tooâAnatole France, Pierre Loti, Maurice Le Blanc, Claude FarrÃ¨re,
Pierre LouÃ¿sâall my favorites, for my friend knew them better than
I did, and made me new acquaintances âin the realm of goldâ that I
like best to travel. What happy talk! and the time went by. I went
out alone to see the full moon rise over the solemn desert by the
reddish hills in the chill air, and fill the great sky with that
white flood of radiance that seemed every night more ethereal, more
remote from mankind, more an eternal thing; and at the hotel we
would meet again to dine late, for my friend being a private
soldier, we waited till the officers were gone; and then again the
tales and the happy talk, and good night. That was life at
Beni-Ounif.

âWould I like to go to the theatre?â I repeated, for it was an
unexpected invitation. âYou might not think so, but there is a
theatre at Beni-Ounif,â said my friend. So it appeared that the
Legion, among the multitude of things it did, occasionally gave a
performance of private theatricals for its own amusement, and my
friend himself was to play that night. It was a beautiful evening
with a cold wind. I made my way through the burly military group
wrapped in heavy blue cloaks, with here and there a burnoosed spahi
or tall tirailleur, and entering the small hall was given a seat in
the front row among a few ladies and very young children, two or
three civilians, my Belgian acquaintance being one, and half a
dozen officers with their swords and crosses. âThe tricolor goes
well with the palm,â I said to myself, as I turned to look at the
prettily decorated, not overlighted room, where trophies of the
colors alternated with panels of palm-leaves on either side and at
the rear, giving to the scene a simple, artistic effect of
lightness and gayety with a touch of beauty, especially in the
palms. It was characteristically French in refinement, simple
elegance, and color; there was nothing elaborate, but it was a
charming border to the eye, and no framework could have been so fit
for that compact mass of soldiers as was this lightly woven canopy
of French flags and the desert palm on the bare walls of that rude
hall. But it was the men who held my eyes. The room was packed with
soldiers of the Legion; a few spahis and tirailleurs stood in the
rear or at the sides; there was no place left to stand even; and I
looked full on their serried faces. My first thought was that I had
never seen soldiers before. I never saw such facesâmature, grave,
settled, with the look of habitual self-possession of men who
command and obey; resolute mouths, immobile features; there was
great sadness in their eyes that seemed to look from some point far
back, heavy and weary; they had endured muchâit was in their pose
and bearing and on their countenances; they had ceased to think of
life and deathâone felt that; but no detail can give the human
depth of the impression I felt at the sightâfaces into which life
had fused all its iron. And there was, too, in the whole mass the
sense of physical life, of hardship and hardihood, and of bodily
power to do and bear and withstandâthe fruit of the desert air,
long marches, terrible campaigns in the sands. It was a sight I
shall always remember as, humanly, one of the most remarkable I
ever looked on.

The Foreign Legion is commonly believed to be made up of broken
men who have in some way found themselves eliminated from society,
thrown out or left out or gone out of their own will, whether by
misfortune, error, disappointment, or any of the various chances of
life, and who have joined the Legion to lose themselves, or because
they did not know what else to do with their lives. They come from
all European nations and are a cosmopolitan body; and, no doubt,
here and there among them is a brilliant talent or a fine quality
of daring gone astray; but I imagine a very large proportion of
them are simply friendless men who at some moment of abandonment
find themselves without resources and without a career, and see in
the Legion a last resource. I believe there are great numbers of
such friendless men in our civilization. Among the thousands of the
Legion there must be, of course, every color of the human past; the
losers in life fail for many reasons, and in their defeat become,
it may be, incidentally or temporarily, antisocial, or even
habitually so, as fate hardens round them with years; but in a
great number of cases, I believe, society has defaulted in its
moral obligations to them before they defaulted in their moral
obligations to their neighbors; and, holding such views, it was
perhaps natural that, so far from finding the Legion a band of
outcast adventurers and derelicts, I found them very human. I did
not read romance or virtue into them. I know the hard conditions of
their lives. If there be an inch of hero in a man, he is hero
enough for me. The story of the French occupation of Algeria is
largely the story of the Legion. For almost a century it has been
one of the most effective units of the French army all over the
world; and here in Algeria it has been not only a fighting force of
the first order, but also a pioneer force of civilization. The
legionaries have built the roads, established the military and
civil stations, accomplished the first public works, drained and
planted; they have laid the material foundations of the new order;
they have not only conquered, but civilized in the material sense,
and the labor in that land and climate has been an enormous toil.
The reclamation of Africa is a great work, sure to be looked on
hereafter as one of the glories of France in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, and I thought, as I turned and the band began
the overture, what a comment it was on society that in this great
work of the reclamation of Africa from barbarism and blood and
sodden misery so large a share was borne by this body of friendless
men for whom our civilization could find no use and cared not for
their fate. What a salvage of human power and capacity, turned to
great uses, was there here! and from moment to moment I looked back
on that body of much-enduring men with a keen recurring sense of
the infinite patience of mankind under the hard fates of life, of
the infinite honor and the infinite pity of it all.

To-night all was light gayety and pleasant jollity. The Legion
has one characteristic of a volunteer regimentâits men can do
everything, so various are the careers from which it is recruited.
Its music is famous, and the orchestra played excellently; and as
the first little play began, âMentons Bleus,â the players showed
themselves good amateurs. The audience responded quickly to the
situations and the dialogue; there were brightened spirits and much
laughter, easy, quiet enjoyment and applause. The second part was a
series of songs, done by one performer after another, each doing
his stunt with verve and the comedy of the variety stage; there was
a full dozen of these light-hearted parts. In the intermissions the
men stayed in their seats, though about the doorway there would be
a little movement and changeful regrouping, but it was an audience
that sat in their places ready for more; there was no smoking. The
last number of the programmeâa small, pretty double sheet, like
note-paper, done by some copying process in pale blue, with a
sword, rifle, and cap on the ground before two palms lightly
sketched in the lower corner of the title leafâwas another one-act
play, âCher MaÃ®tre,â and was received with a spirit that seemed
only to have been whetted by the previous amusement; and when it
was over the evening ended in a round of generous applause and a
smiling breaking up of the company after their three hoursâ
enjoyment. It was pleasant to have been with the Legion on such a
night, and to have shared in its little village
festa
, and I
stood by the doorway and watched the men go by as they passed out,
till all were gone.

It was midnight. The radiant moon poured down that marvellous
white flood on the hollow of the desert where the little town lay
low and gleaming, very silent. But I could not rid my mind of the
soldiersâ lives. I thought of the torrid summer heats here in
garrison, of the burning marches yonder in the south, of the days
in sterile sands that make the sight of palm and garden a thing of
paradiseâincredible fatigues, mortal exhaustion, monotony. One
cannot know the soldiersâ desert life without some experience; but
some impression of it may be gained from soldiersâ books, such as
one that is a favorite companion of mine, âUne Promenade dans le
Sahara,â by Charles Lagarde, a lieutenant in the Chasseurs
dâAfrique, a thoughtful book, full of artistic feeling, and written
with literary grace, the memorial of a soldier with the heart of a
poet, who served in South Algeria. In such books one gets the
environment, but not the life; one touch with the Legion is worth
them all. I fell to sleep for my last slumber at Beni-Ounif,
thinking of soldiersâ lives, friendless menâ

âSomewhere dead far in the waste
Soudan.â

V

It
was a brilliant morning. I went to
the edge of the desert and looked off south with the wish to go on
that all unknown horizons wake, but which the desert horizon stirs,
I think, with more longing insistence, with a greater power of the
vague, than any other; for there it lies world-wide, mysterious,
unpenetrated, and seems to open a pathway through space itself,
like the sea. All true travellers know this feeling, the nostalgia
for the âfar countryâ that they will never see; it is an emotion
that is like a passionâmystical, and belongs to the deep soul. The
desert horizon, like the seaâs, at every moment breeds this spell.
But as I turned back, with the sense of the chained foot, my
disappointment was tempered by the knowledge that I was to
companion my friend, who had been ordered to Tonkin; and I had
timed my departure to go with his detachment on its way north. As I
went down to the train my Arab boy, with the infinite hopefulness
of such attachÃ©s, brought me a dead wolf, if by chance I would like
it; but I could not add it to my baggage, whereat he was sorrowful,
but was comforted. The station presented a lively sceneâmany
soldiers in their white duck trousers and red caps; there was a
band; the air was filled with good-bys and laughing salutations;
the car windows grew lined with leaning forms and intent faces; the
music struck up, high and gallant, and with the last cries and
shouts we were off on the line.

It was too short a ride, though the train climbed slowly up the
incline, while the desert grew a distant outlook and was shut from
view as we made into the winding valleys; and we mounted up through
the black defiles, the desolation of the shivered rock, the passes
of the toothed ranges, the blocking cliffs and columnar heightsâall
the petrifaction and fantasy of that naked and severe land; but I
was less sensible of its enmity and melancholy than when I came
through it alone, though it was harsh and wild, a
terre
perdue
. My friend travelled with his comrades, but we had a
long lunch in the train before AÃ¯n-Sefra, and a longer dinner when
night began to fall, with tales and talk. Tales of the mutiny of
the
batallion dâAfrique
âOthello tales these, fit for fearful
ears; tales of night surprises, Arabs crawling by inches for hours
in the sands, the sentinels killed without a sound, the first alarm
bayonets through the tents, and then the rouse, the square, the
victory; tales of the desert madness, the
cafard
. Stirring
tales. Talk, too, of home and friends left behind us in the world,
of the dead and the living, and of what might yet be for both of
us. He told me much of the Legion, for that interested me; but he
never complained, and if he caught some unspoken thought on my face
from time to time, â
Câest le mÃ©tier
â he would say, and smile
my sympathy away. He was a youth after my own heart; but the night
fell darker and darker, and there would be an end. At the last
station where it was possible, he came back to me. It was
good-by.

TOUGOURT

I

IT was a cold dawn in late April at Biskra. The
carriage, long and heavy, with three horses abreast, stood at the
door. Ali, a sturdy Arab, young but with no look of youth, wound in
a gorgeous red sash, sat on the box; and as I settled in my place,
Hamet, the guide, followed me gravely and sat down beside me, and
at a word from him we were briskly off on the long, uneventful
drive to Tougourt, over the desert route of about a hundred and
thirty miles southward, to be covered in two daysâ travel. We were
soon beside the sleepy silence of the oasis, and passed the old
yellow slope that was once a fortress to guard it on the edge of
the sands; we dipped along by little fields of fresh green barley
and rose on the steppe of the
bois
, a tangle of low
undergrowth, scarcely waist-high, of twisted and almost leafless
shrub, that clothes the desert there with its characteristic dry,
rough, tortured, and stunted but hardy vegetation. A few Arabs were
to be seen in places cutting it for fire-wood. Camels, too, far
away in almost any direction, loomed up, solitary and ungainly as
harbor-buoys on a windless morning tide. On all sides lay the sharp
black outlines of oasis clumps of palm-trees, distinct, single,
solid, each a distant island, with miles to cross before one should
land on its unknown shore; and behind us the range of the AurÃ¨s
seemed to block out the world with the wild beauty of its
precipices, which made one cliff of all the north as if to shut out
Europe. It was like a wall of the world. All about us was the
desert; everything seemed cold and gray and distant, lifeless, in
the pallor of the morning; but with every mile the whole world
brightened and warmed. Desert air intoxicates me; every breath of
it is wine, not so much to my blood or my nerves, but to my whole
being of man; and long before we reached Bordj Saada, the first
halt, I was keyed to the day. It was a glorious day, cloudless and
blue, and drenched with sunshine and radiance and warmth pouring on
vast spaces; and the Bordj, a disused military post, a sort of
large stockade for refuge and defence, standing solitary on its
high ridge, was an old friend and a place of memory for me; there
once I had turned back, and now I was going on. There was
excitement in the moment, in the look ahead; and so it was only as
we swept round the curve down into the valley of Oued Djedi and
crossed its dry channel that I felt myself embarked, as it were, on
my first true desert voyage. I had coasted the Sahara for a
thousand miles here and there, like a boy in a boat; but now I
should be at last out of sight of land.

We were quite happy voyagers, the three of us. Ali, on the box,
sang from time to time some cadenced stave, careless as a bird, in
a world of his own; indeed the drive was an adventure to him, for,
as I afterward found, it was his first going to Tougourt; and had
not Hamet, almost as soon as we started, lifting one intent,
burning glance straight in my eyesâit was the first time I had
really seen him, as a personâtold me that I had brought him good
luck, for that night his wife had borne him a boy? He was content.
A fine figure, too, was Hamet; he answered, as no other guide but
one I ever had, to the imagination; he filled my dream of what
ought to be. A mature man, rather thick-set, with a skin so bronzed
that in the shadow it was black, with the head of a desert sheik,
noble, powerful; when he moved he seemed still in repose, so
sculptural were all the lines of his figure, such dignity was in
every chance attitude; he seemed more like some distinguished aid
to attend me than a guide. His white burnoose fell in large folds,
and as he threw it partly over me in the first cool hours, he
disclosed some light, white underdress over whose bosom hung low a
great gold chain with beads under; a revolver swung in a leather
case, rather tightly drawn below his right breast with a strap over
the shoulder; white stockings and slippers completed his garb. We
talked of trifles, and the conversation was charming, not too
fluentâtalk of the road; but what I remember is my pleasure in
finding again what often seems to me that lost grace of a fine
natural demeanor in men. It is of less consequence to me what a man
says than is his manner of saying it, and speech is not of the lips
only, but of the whole man; and, in my experience, it is the
unlearned who are also unspoiled, that, all in all, say things
best. And ever as we talked or were silent the horses went on, the
brilliant bare line of the AurÃ¨s sank slowly down, and round us was
the waste of rock with its fitful tangle of tamarack and drin, the
sea of sand with its ridged breadths, the near or distant horizon
lines as the track rose and fell; and with the hours the panorama
of the road began to disclose itself.

The road was really a broad, camel-trodden route on which the
carriageway, winding about, found going as best it could; the
railway that will some time be had been surveyed along it, and the
telegraph-poles that already bore the wire far beyond Tougourt into
the desert were seldom far away. On the earlier part of the journey
the going was excellent in that dry season. It was not a lonely
road, though for long stretches it was solitary. Over the brink of
a rise suddenly would spring up a half-dozen human figures, sharp
outlines on the blue sky, and a flock would come tumbling after as
if clotted about their feet, and there might be a donkey or two; it
was a Bedouin family on its northern migration to the summer
pasturage. What an isolated fragment of human life it seemed,
flotsam tossing about with the seasons, as little related to
anything neighborly as seaweed, yet spawning century after century,
living on, with the milk of goats, in such a waste; and how
infinitely fresh was the simple scene! one or two men, a boy,
women, children, and goats tramping in the desert toward water and
green food, a type of humanity for agesâand it was such a wretched
subsistence! But what a bodily vigor, what a look of independence,
what a sense of liberty there was there, too! Now it would be two
or three camels with the canopy in which women ride, with flocks,
too, and more men and boys, more warmly clad, with more color and
importanceâsome wealthier head man with his family going the same
northward journey. Or, as the carriage crested some ridge, we would
see miles ahead a long line creeping on toward usâa trade caravan;
and after a while it would pass, the camels pouting in high air,
under the loads of balanced boxes or bales laid across them,
lumbering dumbly along in the great silence, like convicts, as it
always seems to me, from another sphere of existence.

Many creatures give me vividly this impression of having
haplessly intruded into a state of being not meant for them. The
turtles in the swamps of my boyhood, leaning their sly and
protruded heads out of their impossible shells, the fish that have
great staring eyes in aquariums, frogs and toads and all centipedal
sea creatures, are to me foreigners to life, strays, misbirths,
âmoving about in worlds not realized,â and all grotesque forms of
lifeâeven human deformity when it becomes grotesqueâwake in me
something between amusement and pity that they should be at all. I
feel like saying as a guide, wishing to correct a friend of mine,
once said: âMonsieur, you are a mistake.â But of all such
creatures, the camel fills me with the most profound and incurable
despair. He is the most homeless-looking of all creatures. He has
been the companion and helpmate of man from the dawn of human life,
and our debt to him through uncounted ages and in places where the
human lot has been most penurious and desperate is untold; but man
has never been able to enlighten him; he looks, on all occasions
and under all circumstances, hopelessly bored with existence,
unutterably sick of humanity. There is a suicidal mood in animal
life, and at times one can see glimpses and intimations of it
surely in the eyes of animals; the camel embodies it, like a stare.
I wish they were all dead; and when I see their bones in the sand,
as I often do, I am glad that they are gone and have left the ribs
of their tabernacle of life behind them by the wayside. Every
desert traveller writes a little essay on the camel. This is mine.
I will not modify it even for the sake of the meharis that come
down the route, overtaking us from Biskra; they are the racers that
have just competed in the yearly trial of speed from
Tougourtâaristocrats of the species; they have a clear gray tone
and slender delicacies of flank and skin; all day they will be
speeding ahead and dropping behind us; the desert is their cloth of
gold and they its chivalryâsplendid beasts they are, as native to
this blown empire of the sand and the sun and the free air as a
bird to the skyâand they lift their blunt noses over it with
unconquerable contempt. It is amazing how the creature,
supercilious or abject, refuses to be comforted. There is no link
between him and man. If you seek a type for the irreconcilable,
find it in the camel.

It is said that one meets his enemy in every place, and every
traveller experiences these surprising encounters that prove the
smallness of the world; but I better the proverb, for it is a
friend I meet in the most solitary places. On the loneliest road of
Greece a passing traveller called out my name; in the high passes
of Algiers I came face to face with a schoolmate; and, however
repeated, the experience never loses its surprise. Surely I had
seen that gaunt figure pressing up on a stout mule from the head of
the fresh trade caravan that was just approaching; that face, like
a bird of prey, that predatory nose before the high forehead and
bold eyesâyes, it was Yussef, my guide of years ago, with welcome
all over his countenance and quick salutations to his old
companion. He was a caravan man now, for the nonce, and coming up
from the Souf. How natural it was to meet on the desert, with the
brief words that resumed the years and abolished the time that had
sped away and renewed the eternal now. But we must follow the
meharis, slim forms on the horizon ahead, and we went on to
overtake them at AÃ¯n Chegga, a mere stopping place, where there was
on one side of the way a sort of desert farm, and a relay of horses
waiting for us, and on the other a small, lonesome building by
itself where we could lunch from our own stores. The sun was hot
now and the shade and rest grateful; but we had a long way to go.
With thoughtless generosity we gave our fragments of bread to some
adjacent boys, and started off rapidly with the fresh horses on the
great plain.

The road was lonelier than in the morning hours; the solitude
began to make itself felt, the silence of the heat, the
encompassment of the rolling distances, the splendor of the sky.
There was hardly any life except the occasional shrub, the drin. I
saw a falcon once, and once a raven; but we were alone, as if on
the sea. Then the Sahara began to give up its blissâthe unspeakable
thingâthe inner calm, the sense of repose, of relief, the feeling
of separation from life, the falling away of the burden, the
freedom from it all in the freedom of those blue and silent
distances over sandy and rock-paved tracts, full of the sun. How
quiet it was, how large, and what a sense of effortless elemental
powerâof nature in her pure and lifeless being! It is easy to think
on the desert, thought is there so near to factâa still fresh
imprint in consciousness; thought and being are hardly separate
there; and there nature seems to me more truly felt in her naked
essence, lifeless, for life to her is but an incident, a detail,
uncared for, unessential. She does but incline her poles and it is
gone. Taken in the millennial Ã¦ons of her existence, it is a
lifeless universe that is, and on the desert it seems so. This is
the spectacle of power where man is notâlike the sea, like the
vault of heaven, like all that is infinite. What a repose it is to
behold it, to feel it, to know itâthis elimination, not only of
humanity, but of life, from things! The desertâit is the truth. How
golden is the sunlight, how majestic the immobile earth, how
glorious the reach of itâthis infinite! And one falls asleep in it,
cradled and fascinated and careless, flooded slowly by that peace
which pours in upon the spirit to lull and strengthen and quiet it,
and to revive it changed and more in natureâs image, purgedâso it
seemsâof its too human past.

It was late in the afternoon. Hamet roused himself as we passed
down to Oued Itel and crossed its dry bed, and Ali ceased from his
vagrant music as the horses breasted the slope beyond. We came out
on a high ridge. It was a magnificent view. The long valley of the
great chotts lay below us transversely, like a vast river bottom;
far off to the northeast glittered, pale and white, Chott Melrir,
like a sea of salt, and before us Chott Merouan stretched across
like a floor, streaked with blotches of saltpetre and dark stains
of soil. The scene made the impression on me of immense flats at a
dead low tide, reaching on the left into distances without a sea.
It was a scene of desolation, of unspeakable barrenness, of the
waste world; its dull, white lights were infinitely fantastic on
the grays and the blacks, and the lights in the sky were cold; the
solitude of it was complete; but its great extent, its emptiness,
its enclosing walls of shadow in the falling day crinkling the
whole upper plane of the endless landscape round its blanching
hollows and horizontal vistas below, stamped it indelibly on my
eyes. I was not prepared for it; it was an enlargement, a new
aspect of the world. This was the southwestern end of the chain of
chotts, or salt wastes, that lie mostly below sea-level and are the
dried-up bed of the ancient inland arm of the sea that washed this
valley in some distant age; they stretch northeasterly and touch
the Mediterranean near GabÃ¨s and the suggestion is constantly made
that the sea be let into them again by a canal, thus flooding and
transforming this part of the Sahara. It may some time be done; but
there is some doubt about the lay of the levels and whether such an
engineering feat would not result merely in stagnant waters.
Meanwhile it is a vast barren basin, saline, and in the wet season
dangerous with quicksands, unsafe ground, a morass of death for man
and beast. The ridge where I stood commanded a long view of this
sterile and melancholy waste; but I did not feel it to be sad; I
only felt it to be; it had such grandeur.

We went down by a rough descent and began the crossing of the
chott before us, Merouan, on its westerly edge. The road ran on
flat ground, often wet and thick with a coating of black mud, and
there was the smell of saltpetre in the air; the view on either
side was merely desolate, night was falling, it began to be chill;
and by the time we reached the farther side the stars came out. It
was a darkened scene when we rode into the first oasis of young
palms, without inhabitants, which belonged to some French company.
It was full night when we emerged again on the sands; a splendor of
stars was over us and utter solitude around; it was long since we
had seen any one, and as the second oasis came into view it looked
like a low black island cliff on the sea, and as deserted. We drove
into its shadows by a broad road like an avenue, with the
motionless palms thick on either side, as in a park; there was no
sign or sound of life. It was like night in a forest, heavy with
darkness and silence, except where the stars made a track above and
our lights threw a pale gleam about. This oasis, which was large,
also seemed uninhabited; and we passed through it on the straight
road which was cut by other crossing roads, and came out on the
desert by the telegraph-poles. The going was through heavy sand,
which after a mile or two was heavier; our hubs were now in drifts
of it. Hamet took the lights and explored to find tracks of wheels,
and the horses drew us with difficulty into what seemed a route; in
ten minutes it was impracticable. We crossed with much bumping and
careening to the other side of the telegraph-poles, and that was no
better; forward and back and sidelong, with much inspection of the
ground, we plied the search; we were off the route.

We drove back to the oasis thinking we had missed the right way
out, and on its edge turned at right angles down a good road; at
the corner we found ourselves in the dunesâthere was no semblance
of a route. We returned to the centre of the silent palm grove,
where there were branching ways, and taking another track were
blocked by a ditch, and avoiding that, coasting another and ruder
side of the grove, again at the upper corner of the oasis struck
the impassable; so we went back to our starting-place. Hamet took
the lanterns and gathered up his revolver and set out apparently to
find the guardian, if there was one. It was then Ali told me he had
never been to Tougourt before; Hamet was so experienced a guide
that it was thought a good opportunity to break in a new driver.
These French oases across the old route, with their new roads, were
confusing; and Hamet had not been down to Tougourt of late. The
silence of the grove was great, not wholly unbroken now: there were
animal cries, insect buzzings, hootings, noises of a wood, and
every sound was intensified in the deep quiet, the strange
surroundings. It was very late. We had spent hours in our slow
progress wandering about in the sands and the grove in the
uncertain light. Hamet was gone quite a long time, but at last we
saw his waving lantern in the wide dark avenue and drove toward
him. He got in, said something to Ali, and off we went on our
original track, but turned sharply to the right before issuing from
the wood, down a broad way; we were soon skirting the western edge
of the oasis; branches brushed the carriage; the ruts grew deep,
the track grew narrow, the carriage careened; we got out, the
wheels half in the ditch, horses backing. Hamet threw up his hands.
It was midnight. We would camp where we were. The route was lost,
whatever might be our state; and I did not wonder, for as nearly as
I could judge we were then heading north by east, if I knew the
polestar. We were on the only corner of the oasis we had not
hitherto visited; the spot had one recommendation for a campâit was
a very out-of-the-way place. The horses were taken out, and each of
us disposed himself for the night according to his fancy. It was
intensely cold, and I rolled myself in my rugs and sweaters and
curled up on the carriage seat and at once fell fast asleep.

An hour later I awoke, and unwinding myself got out. It was
night on the desert. Ali was asleep on the box, upright, with his
chin against his breast. Hamet lay in his burnoose in the sand some
little distance away. The horses stood in some low brush near the
ditch. The palm grove, impenetrably black, stood behind, edging the
long, low line of the sky; there was a chorus of frogs monotonously
chanting; and before me to the west was the vague of the sands,
with indistinguishable lines and obscure hillocks, overlaid with
darkness. Only the sky gave distance to the silent solitudeâsuch a
sky as one does not see elsewhere, magnificent with multitudes of
stars, bright and lucid, or fine and innumerable, melting into
nebulous clouds and milky tracts, sparkling and brilliant in that
keen, clear, cloudless cold, all the horizon round. I was alone,
and I was glad. It was a wonderful moment and scene. Hamet stirred
in his place, and I went back to my post and slept soundly and
well.

II

I woke
at the first streak of dawn. Two
beautiful morning stars still hung, large and liquid, in the fading
night, but the growing pallor of daybreak already disclosed the
wild and desolate spot where we had fortunately stopped. Drifts of
trackless sand stretched interminably before us; the young palms
showed low and forlorn in the gray air; the scanty brush by the
ditch was starved and miserable; everything had a meagre, chill,
abandoned look. As soon as it was light we reversed our course, and
re-entering the oasis hailed a well-hidden group of buildings with
a koubba that Hamet seemed to have discovered the night before. An
old Arab gave us our bearings. We were seventeen kilometres short
of MraÃ¯er, the oasis which we should have reached; and now, making
the right turn-off, we saw in another direction over the sands the
black line of palms toward which we had gone astray. We soon
covered the distance to MraÃ¯er, which was a large oasis with a
considerable village and a caravanserai whose gates were crowded
with camels; here we got a very welcome breakfast, but we did not
linger, and were quickly out again on the desert on the long dayâs
ride before us.

Since we passed the chott we were in the valley of Oued Rir,
along which is strewn a chain of oases like a necklace as far as to
Tougourt and beyond. We were really on the crust of what has been
well called a subterranean Nile, formed by the converging flow of
two Saharan rivers, Oued Igharghar and Oued Mya, whose underground
bed is pierced by wells and the waters gathered and distributed to
feed the oases. There are now forty-six of these palm gardens that
lie at a distance of a few miles, one from another, spotting the
arid sands with their black-green isles of solid verdure, making a
fantastic and beautiful landscape of the rolling plain of moving
sands, with many heights and depressions, stretching with desert
breadth on and on under the uninterrupted blue of the glowing sky.
The district has long been a little realm by itself, sustaining
with much toil the meagre life of its people and periodically
invaded and subdued by the great passing kingdoms of the north. Its
prosperity, however, really dates from the French occupation. At
that time the oases were dying out under the invasion of the
unresting sands that slowly were burying them up. The French almost
at once with their superior skill sank artesian wells, and the new
flood of water brought immediate change. The number of the
inhabitants has doubled; the product of dates, which are of the
best quality, has increased many-fold; and new oases of great
extent and value have been planted by French companies. This is one
of the great works of public beneficence accomplished by France for
the native population; and evidence of prosperity was to be seen on
every hand all the way.

The route for the most part was sandy with occasional stretches
of rock, often a beautifully colored quartz, whose brilliant and
strange veins harmonized well with the deep-toned landscape; but
the eye wandered off to the horizon and drifts of sand, as the
heavens began to fill with light and the spaces grew brilliant; in
that vacancy and breadth every detail grew strangely important and
interesting; a single palm, a far glimmer of salt, a herd of goats
would hold the eye, and, as the day grew on, the deceptive
atmosphere gave a fresh touch of the fantastic, playing with the
lines and forms of objects. We passed from MraÃ¯er, leaving these
island oases on the horizon as the route threaded its way more or
less remote from them, and at intervals we would touch oneâa palm
grove on the right, and the village by itself on higher dry ground
to the left. Two of these villages, of considerable size, were
entirely new, having been built within two years; they were
constructed of the sun-dried mud commonly used, but they did not
have the dilapidated look of the ksar; they were clean and fresh, a
new home for the people who had abandoned the old, unhealthy site
that they had formerly occupied, and had made a new town for
themselves; and Hamet, who told me this, said other villages had
done the same, and he seemed proud of their enterprise and
prosperity.

We went on now through heavy sand at timesâand always there was
the broad prospect, the gray and brown ribbed distance, the blue
glowâa universal light, a boundless freedom, the desert solitude of
the dry, soft air. â
Câest le vrai Sahara
â said Hamet,
content. For myself I could not free my senses of the previous
dayâs impression of the great chotts as of the shore of a world,
and the landscape continued to have a prevailing marine character.
I do not mean that the desert was like the ocean; it was not. But
the outlooks, the levels, the sand-colored and blue-bathed spaces
were like scenes by the seashore; only there was no sea there. The
affluence of light, the shadowless brilliancy, the silences, the
absence of humanity and human things as again and again they
dropped from us and ceased to be, were ocean traits; but there was
no seaâonly the wind sculpture of the sands, beautifully mottled
and printed, and delicately modulated by the windâs breath, only a
blue distance, an island horizon. Even the birdsâthere were many
larks to-dayâseemed sea-birds, so lonesomely flying. But there was
never any sea. It was the kingdom of the sands.

Here, not far from the route, I saw what was meant by the
invasion of the sand. The oasis on its farther side toward the
desert was half blown over with the white drifts of it that made in
like a tide; the trunks of the palms were buried to a third of
their height in it; the whole garden was bedded with it, and as we
drew away from the place, looking back, the little oasis with its
bare palm stems resembled a wreck driving in the sea of sands.
Elsewhere I saw the barriers, fences of palm leaves and fagots,
raised against the encroaching dunes, where the sand was packed
against them like high snow-drifts. The sand grew heavier now, and
as we came to Ourlana, about which palmerais lay clustering in all
directions, the horses could hardly drag through the deep, loose
mass up to the low building and enclosure where was our noon
stopping place. The resources of the house were scanty: only an
omelet, but an excellent one, and coffee; bread, too, and I had
wine. The family, a small one with boy and girl, whom chocolate
soon won to my side, was pleasant, and there was a welcome feeling
of human society about the incident; but as I lit a cigarette and
watched the fresh horses put inâfor here we found our second relay
that had been sent ahead some days beforeâI saw that, if the
population seemed scanty, it was not for any lack of numbers. A
short distance beyond our enclosure, and on a line with it, in the
same bare sandy waste, stood another long building with a great
dome, evidently a government structure, and at right angles to it
before the door was forming a long line of young children; it was
the village schoolâthese were the native boys marching in to the
afternoon session, for all the world like an American school at
home. I had not expected to see that on the Sahara. I photographed
it at onceâa striking token of modern civilization; and I saw no
happier sight than those playful little Arabs going to school.

We dipped ahead into the oasis by the long lines of palms
lifting their bare stems far overhead and fretting the sky with
their decorative border of tufts. Here and there were fruit trees,
and occasionally vegetables beneath, but as a rule there were only
the palms rising from bare earth, cut by ditches in which flowed
the water; there was no orchard or garden character to the soil,
only a barren underground, but all above was forest silence and the
beauty of tall trees. It was spring, and the trees had begun to put
out their great spikes and plumes of white blossoms in places, and
the air was warm and soft. A palm fascinates me with the beauty of
its formal lines; where two or three are gathered together they
make a picture; a single one in the distance gives composition to a
whole landscape. This was, notwithstanding the interludes of the
oases, a continuously desert ride, and I remember it mostly for its
beauty of color and line, and a strange intensity and aloofness of
the beauty; there was nothing human in it. It seemed to live by its
own glow in a world that had never known man; the scene of some
other planet where he had never been. There was, too, over all the
monotony and immobility of things, a film of changefulness, a waver
of surface, a shifting of lights and planes; it was full of the
fascination of horizons, the elusiveness of far objects, and the
feeling of endlessness in it, like the sky, was a deep chord never
lost. It was beyond Ourlana that I noticed to the southwest, a mile
or two away, three or four detached palms by a lake; their tall
stems leaned through the transparent air above a low bank over a
liquid, mirror-like belt of quiet water, a perfect oriental scene.
It was my first mirage; and two or three times more I saw it that
afternoonâthe perfect symbol of all the illusion of life. How
beautiful it was, how was its beauty enhanced framed there in the
waste world, how after a while it melted away!

Oasis after oasis dropped from us on the left and the right, and
in the late afternoon we were climbing a sharp rise through the
deepest sand we had yet encountered, so that we all got out and
walked to relieve the horses, and ourselves toiled up the slope;
and soon from the ridge we saw a broad panorama like that of the
day before; but instead of that salt desolation, here the eye
surveyed an endless lowland through which ahead ran a long, dark
cluster of oases, one beyond another, like an archipelago; and
Hamet, pointing to one far beyond all, on the very edge of the
horizon, said: âTougourt.â We descended to the valley, passing a
lonely old gray mosque, or koubba, of some desert saint by the
wayâvery solemn and impressive it was in the failing light, far
from men; and we rolled on for miles over land like a floor, as on
a Western prairie; and the stars came out; and at intervals a dark
grove went by; and we were again in the sands; and another grove
loomed up with its look of a black low island, and we passed on
beside it. I thought each, as it came in view, was our goal, but we
kept steadily on. It was nigh ten oâclock when we saw, some miles
away, the two great lights, like low harbor lights, that are the
lights of the gate of Tougourt. Ali was perceptibly relieved when
we made sure of them; for they were unmistakable at last.

Then, in that last half-hour, I witnessed a strange phenomenon.
The whole sky was powdered with stars; I had never seen such a
myriad glimmer and glow, thickening, filling the heavenly spaces,
innumerable; and all at once they seemed to interlink, great and
small, with rays passing between them, and while they shone in
their places, infinite in multitude, light fell from them in long
lines, like falling rain, down the whole concave of night from the
zenith to the horizon on every side. It was a Niagara of stars. The
celestial dome without a break was sheeted with the starry rain,
pouring down the hollow sphere of darkness, from the apex to the
desert rims. No words can describe that sight, as a mere vision;
still less can they tell its mystical effect at the moment. It was
like beholding a miracle. And it was not momentary; for half an
hour, as we drove over the dark level, obscure, silent, lonely, I
was arched in and shadowed by that ceaseless, starry rain on all
sides round; and as we passed the great twin lights of the gates,
and entered Tougourt, and drew up in the dim and solitary square,
it was still falling.

III

I emerged
the next morning from the
arcaded entrance of the hotel, which was one of a continuous line
of low buildings making the business side of the public square, and
glancing up I saw a great dog looking down on me from the flat
roof. There was little other sign of life. The square was a large,
irregular space which seemed the more extensive owing to the low
level of the adjoining buildings over which rose the massive tower
of the kasbah close at hand on the right and, diagonally across,
the high dome of the French Bureau, with its arcaded front beneath,
filling that eastern side. A fountain stood in the midst of the
bare space, and beyond it was a charming little park of trees; and
still farther the white gleam of the barracks, through the green
and on either side, closed the vista to the south. The Moresque
architecture, which the French affect in the desert, with its white
lights and open structure, gave a pleasing amplitude to the scene;
and the same style was taken up by the main street straight down my
left, whose line was edged by a long arcade with low, round arches,
and the view lost itself beyond in the market square with thick
tufts of palms fringing the sky. A few burnoosed figures were
scattered here and there.

Hamet joined me at once, still content; he held in his hand a
telegram from his new boy, or those who could interpret for him. We
turned at once to the near corner by the kasbah, where was the
entrance to the old town and the mosqueâa precinct of covered
streets, narrow, tortuous ways, with blank walls, dim light. There
were few passers-by; occasionally there was a glimpse of some human
scene; but the general effect, though the houses were often well
built, was dingy, poor, and mean, as such an obscure warren of
streets must seem to us, and there was nothing here of the
picturesque gloom and threatening mystery of Figuig. I remember it
as a desert hive of the human swarm; it was a new, strange, dark
mode of manâs animal existence. This was a typical desert town, an
old capital of the caravans. It had been thus for ages; and my
feeling, as I wandered about, was less that of the life than of its
everlastingness.

We went back to the mosque and climbed the minaret. It was a
welcome change to step out on the balcony into the flood of azure.
The true Sahara stretched round usâthe roll of the white sands,
motion in immobility; and all about, as far as one could see, the
dark palm islands in the foreground and on every horizon. The
terrace roofs of the old town lay dark under our feet; off there to
the west in the sand were the tombs of its fifty kings; eastward
the palm gardens, bordering and overflowing into the new quarter
with its modern buildings, lifted their fronds; and near at hand
the tower of the kasbah, and here and there a white-domed koubba,
rose in the dreaming air; and the streets with their life were
spread beneath. Tougourt, at the confluence of the underground
streams, is the natural capital of the Rir country, a commanding
point; on the north and west it is walled against the inroad of the
sands; south and east is a more smiling scene, but the white sand
lies everywhere between, like roads of the sea; it is the queen of
the oases, and one understood in that sparkling air why it was
called a jewel of the desert. I went down to the gardens, where
there were fruit trees and vegetables among the palms, but for the
most part there was as usual only the barren surface of earth, fed
with little canals and crossed by narrow, raised footways, over
which sprang the fanshaped or circular tufts of swarded green. On
that side, too, was a native villageâdreary walls of sun-dried
earth with open ways; they seemed merely a new form of the naked
ground shaped perpendicularly and squaredâwindowless, sealed,
forlorn. I entered one or two. Indeed, I went everywhere that
morning, for the distances were short.

In the afternoon I sat down by a table near a cafÃ© in the market
square, and I remained there for hours over my coffee, watching the
scene. All Arab markets are much alike, but this was prettily
framed. On my right a palm grove rose over a low wall; on the left,
across the broad space, the low line of shops, with a glistening
koubba dome in their midst, broke the blue sky; and all between, in
front, was the market-place. In the foreground were a few raised
booths, or tables, and at the near end by a group of three or four
palms was a butcherâs stock in trade, the carcasses hanging on the
limbs of a dead tree. Farther off to the left squatted a half-dozen
Bedouins round little fagots of brushwood spread on the ground, and
beyond them a group of animals huddled; in the centre, on the
earth, one behind another into the distance, were many little
squares and heaps of country goods, each with its guardian group as
at a fairâvegetables, grains, cloths, slippers, ropes, caps,
utensils, that together measured the scale of the simple wants of
the desert. The place, though not crowded, was well filled with an
ever-moving and changing throng, gathering into groups here and
thereâturbaned people of every tint and costume, young and old,
poor and prosperous, picturesque alike in their bright colors or
worn rags; but the white or brown flowing garments predominated.
There were Arab and Berber faces of purer race; but in the people
at large there was a strong negroid character, showing the deeper
infusion of negro blood which one notices as he goes south of the
Atlas. All the afternoon the quiet but interested crowd swarmed
about; and round me at the close tables were soldiers and Arabs who
seemed of a more prosperous class, drinking and talking, playing at
cards, chess, and dominos, and some were old and grave and silent.
At our table there was always one or two, who came and went, to
whom Hamet would perhaps present me, a thin-featured cadi, a burly
merchant, and we talked a little; but I left the talk to them and
watched the scene and from time to time snapped my camera. A
caravan came down the street, with great boxes strapped on the
camels, and I thought the first two would sweep me, camera, table,
and all, out of the way; but the long line got by at last, ungainly
beasts with their pawing necks and sardonic mouths. At Tougourt one
was always meeting a caravan. As I stood, at a later hour, in a
lonely corner by the wall outside the gates, one was just kneeling
down on the great sweep of the sand-hill to camp in the melancholy
light that was falling from the darkening skyâa sombre scene; and
when I came out of the hotel at night I found another sleeping,
humped and shadowy, on the public square. The camel was as
omnipresent as the palm, and belonged to the same dunes and sky;
and as I sat watching there through the uneventful and unhurried
hours, the market-place was a microcosm of the desert world.

IV

I spent
the evening in the
CafÃ©
Maure
of the Ouled-NaÃ¯ls. They are
la femme
of the
Sahara, daughters of a tribe whose centre is at Djelfa, not far
from Laghouat, leagues away to the west, and thence they are
dispersed through the desert, adept dancing-girls who perform in
cafÃ©s; and in that primitive society, it is said, no reproach
attaches to their mode of life, which yields them a dowry and
brings them at last a husband. The custom is not peculiar to the
Sahara; I have read of its existence in Japan and in the north of
Scotland in the eighteenth century. I had met with them before, and
was familiar with their figures, but always in a tourist
atmosphere; here they were on their own soil, and
au
naturel
, and I expected a different impression.

The room was rather large, with the furnace and the utensils for
coffee in the corner near the entrance; four or five musicians, on
a raised platform, were discoursing their shrill barbarian art, but
it pleases me with its plaintive intensity and rapid crescendos, in
its savage surroundings; a bench went round the wall, and there
were tables, at one of which Hamet and I sat down, and coffee was
brought. There were not many in the roomâa sprinkling of soldiers,
mostly in the blue of the tirailleurs, Arabs, old and gray-bearded,
or younger and stalwart like Ali, whom I had lost sight of and now
found here, much more attractive than I had thought possible, with
a desert rose in his mouth and a handsome comrade. A few women with
the high head-dress and heavy clothes they wear were scattered
about. Close behind me, and to my left, was a wide entrance to the
dark shadows of the half-lighted court whose cell-like rooms I had
inspected in the morning, and men and women were passing in and
out, singly and in groups, all the evening. For a while there was
no dancingâonly the music; but at some sign or call a full-grown
woman, who seemed large and heavy, began the slow cadence and sway
of the dance. I had often seen the performance, but never in such a
setting; at Biskra and in the north it is a show; here it was a
life. She finished, and I beckoned to a young slip of a girl
standing near. She came, leaning her dark hands on the table, with
those unthinking eyes that are so wandering and unconcerned until
they fill with that liquid, superficial light which in the south is
so like a caress. I offered her my cigarettes, and she smiled, and
permitted me to examine the bracelets on her arms and the silver
ornaments that hung from her few necklaces; she was simply dressed
and not overornamented; she was probably poor in such riches; there
was no necklace of golden louis that one sometimes sees; but there
were bracelets on her ankles, and she wore the head-dress, with
heavy, twisted braids of hair. A blue star was tattooed on her
forehead, and her features were small but fine, with firm lines and
rounded cheek and chin; she was too young to be handsome, but she
was pretty for her type and she had the pleasant charm that youth
gives to the children of every tint and race. She stood by us a
while with a little talk, and as the music began she drew back and
danced before us; and if she had less muscular power and vivacity
than the previous dancer, she had more grace in her slighter
motions. She used her handkerchief as a background to pose her head
and profile her features and form; and all through the dance she
shot her vivid glances, that had an elasticity and verve of steel,
at me. She came back to take our applause and thanks, and talked
with Hamet, for her simple French phrases were exhausted; there was
nothing meretricious in her demeanor, rather an extraordinary
simplicity and naturalness of behavior; she seemed a thing of
nature. The room began to fill now; three women were dancing; and
she went over to the bench by the wall opposite, and I noticed a
young boy of eight or ten years ran to sit by her and made up to
her like a little brother. There were three or four such young boys
there.

The scene was now at its full value as a picture; not that there
was any throng or excitement, and to a European eye it might seem
only dull, provincial, rude; the rather feebly lighted room was
obscure in the corners and the walls were naked; the furnace
corner, however, was full of dark movement, the sharp music broke
out afresh, the dance was almost sombre in its monotony, seen
mechanically and without any apparent interest by the Arabs,
wrinkled and grizzled, banked together or leaning immobile on the
bench by the wall; and the cavernous shadow of the court behind me
made a fine background to the figures or groups that disappeared or
emerged, or sometimes stood stationary there in the semi-obscurity.
To my color and shadow loving eye it was an interesting scene; and
its rudeness enhanced its quality. I noticed many a slight thing: a
tall negro stalked along the opposite wall with a handful of
candles which he offered to a woman and found no welcome for, and
he went away apparently exceeding sorrowful. And I sat there long
in the midst of it, thinking of striped tents by the city wall in
the sand near the graves; of streets in the Orient and the north
where the women sit by the door-post like idols; and especially
reconstructing in imagination the scenes of a romance by an Arab,
which I had lately read, depicting the life of an Ouled-NaÃ¯l along
these very routes where I had been passing, a book full of desert
truthââKhadra,â it is called. Toward ten oâclock we rose to go, and
I caught the eye of the young girl I had talked with, and had a
smile for good-by.

V

The
horses stood at the door early the
next morning for a drive to Temacin, some thirteen kilometres
south. We were soon out of town, travelling beside an oasis on the
left and going in the open desert; a boy joined us from the oasis
and excitedly struggled to keep up with the carriage, no difficult
task, for the route was heavy with sand; two other boys on donkeys
ahead were having a race; and the route had always some touches of
travel. The openness of the view was boundless, and I had not seen
finer sands, stretching away in long rolls and ridges, and mounded
into splendid dunes, with palms here and there for horizon lines.
There were always groups and little strings of camels, isolated but
living, in the expanse over which the eye roamed; we passed from
time to time within view of clumps of lost palms, little oases
buried and left in the sands, half-submerged, derelicts; now there
were Bedouin tents, low, striped shelters, by ones or twos, pitched
on the sterile waste, looking infinitely solitary, at a distance
from a small village on a ridge, that itself seemed a heap of
ruined and ribbed walls left abandoned. The morning was hot, the
sun beat down, and every line and tracery of the wind was visible
on the sand. The surface of the dunes was beautifulâlight and full
of the spirit of fantasy; the modulation was exquisite, ribbed and
fretted, furrowed in lines and touched all over with little disks
and curves, like the imprint of small shells; and their mottled and
wavy surfaces broke the monotony of the vast slopes and dunes like
an infinite enamelling of nature. It was the land of the blue
distance, the simple in the grand, the apotheosis of paucity in the
means, of poverty in the substance, elemental, abstract, superb:
the glory of the desert. I never so felt it as on that morning. I
watched the slender, film-like, far-off minaret of Temacin take
body and height as we drew nearer and nearer, and saw plainly and
distinctly at last the boldly perched, irregular oblong of walls
and roofs that topped a rising ridge of the sands, with its minaret
like a dark, mediÃ¦val tower standing in heaven with a lance-like
solitude. Its top was bordered with a broad frieze of colored tiles
and capped with a pyramidal head or balcony pierced with slim
Moorish arches. There were men working under the wall; but the town
looked marvellously silent and alone, dark and withdrawn, like an
impenetrable earthen ruin, incommunicable; it rose as if made of
the earth itself, with the dilapidation of old earthworks,
forbidding and melancholy, with no touch of life except the gleam
of its tiled minaret; in all that sun it seemed sunlessâruinous,
decadent, infinitely old. Soon after we passed another heap of
earth walls on a sand-mound, a small village, and came almost at
once to Tamelhat, the zaouia, which we had set out to see.

High walls surrounded the enclosure, which was extensive.
Tamelhat is a holy village, a chief seat of the religious order of
the Tidjania and daughter of the mother zaouia at AÃ¯n Madhi, near
Laghouat, with which it shares the devotion of this important
brotherhood, one of the most influential of the Moslem associations
in North Africa. The zaouia is a sort of monastery or abbey; but I
was not prepared to find it so large an establishment. We left the
carriage at the gate and passed in to a second gate, and I was
struck by the ornamental work and texts on them and on the walls. A
straight avenue led down to an open space where the mosque stood on
the right side of the street as we turned sharply upon it. Three
square windows set in little ornamented arches in the centre broke
the broad white space of the wall, and there were other windows
irregularly placed. A little to one side was a heavy door, with a
double row of faience set over its square top and descending on
beautiful onyx pillars. An octagonal dome, tipped with a shaft of
three golden balls, completed the building above. It was a pretty
exterior with a touch of art in the line of windows, and as I
passed into the interior by the lovely onyx columns it seemed like
a reminiscence, almost a renaissance, to find before my gaze the
familiar blue and green tiles, plaques of wrought plaster in
arabesque, pretty bits of faience adornmentâforms of the ornament
and color so delightful to me. The interior was roomy, with good
spaces, and lofty above; in the main fore part a palanquin was in
one corner, and a few tombs were placed here and there; but the
shrine, the tomb of the Marabout who founded the zaouia, stood in
the space to the left, directly under the dome, as in a chapel. It
was heavily covered with stuffs, as usual, and overhung with many
banners; a grill ran round it, and outside of that a wooden rail;
the tomb also bore Arabian texts. The whole effect, notwithstanding
the bareness, the few elements, the uncostly materials, had the
grand simplicity of the Moslem faith; it was impressiveâimposing to
a simple soul; but, beyond the restful sense of the neighborhood of
beautiful and sacred things in that far and desert solitude, what
pleased me most and the feature I carried away to be my memory of
it was the ample lights in the cool spaces by the open windows
above the tomb toward the street, where the birds were continually
fluttering in and out, unfrightened and undisturbed, as if this was
their quiet home.

I thanked the Arab sacristan who stood looking at me with old
and tranquil eyes, and we went out and walked up the street, which
seemed like a long cloister. There were grilled windows on the
well-built walls at intervals; a few men sat here and there on
benches along the way; it seemed a place of peace. The street,
which was quite long and straight, ended in a large court near
which was the dwelling of the Marabout. Hamet asked me if I would
like to see him, and I gladly assented. After a brief interval an
Arab came to us, to whom I gave my coat and what things I was
carrying; and leaving them below, he guided us up an irregular
stairway, as in an old house, and took us into a rather large, high
room, plainly plastered and bare. The desert saintâsuch he wasâwas
seated on the floor in the middle of one side by the wall on a rug;
he was old and large, white-bearded, with a heavy look, as if he
were used to much repose and was aged. He gave me his hand as I
stooped down to him, and after a word or two invited me to be
seated at a plain table before him in the middle of the room; and
attendants silently brought food. There was already in the room the
caÃ¯d of Temacin, a stout and prosperous-looking Arab, to whom Hamet
presented me, and the three of us sat down to what turned out to be
a hearty breakfast. Two or three other tall Arabs, apparently
belonging to the family, sat by the wall to my left, as I faced the
Marabout, and at a doorway in the corner on the right stood a group
of different ages, younger, with one or two boys, intelligent and
bright-eyed. The caÃ¯d and myself talked in low tones, and no one
else spoke, except from time to time the Marabout gave some
direction to the attendants, apparently of a hospitable nature, as
each time it resulted in fresh dishes. There was pastry that
resembled rolls, and after a few moments, served in another form,
hot with sugar, it resembled pancakes, but I dare say it was
something quite different, and the Marabout urged it upon me; there
was another combination that reminded me distantly of doughnuts,
with which the hot food ended; but there was a dessert of French
cakes, almonds, and a dried aromatic kernel like peas, and much to
my surprise there were oranges that must have come on camel-back
from Biskra. There was coffee, too, with a curious pot and
sugar-bowl, and the whole service was excellent, the attendants
kindly and pressing, though very quiet. It appeared afterward that
no one ever sees the saint eat; his food is brought and left, and
he takes what he likes alone. I observed him through the meal, and
occasionally he addressed a sentence of inquiry or interest to us.
The impression he made on me was one of great indolence, as if he
had never done anything for himself, and also of what I can only
describe as a somnolent temperament, heavy and rousing himself at
times; but it may have been only age. The profound silence and
atmosphere of awed respect were remarkable; the few words spoken
were hardly above a whisper, and the caÃ¯d and I used low tones. It
was a hospitable and generous breakfast, however, and the manner of
it wholly pleasant and friendly; and as I again took the old
Maraboutâs large, soft hand, and expressed my pleasure and thanks
for having been thus received, he seemed to me very cordial and
kind; and for my part I was glad that I had found the unusual
experience of breakfasting with a saint so agreeable. The caÃ¯d and
I parted below, and I walked back through the tranquil street and
by the mosque with the bird-haunted windows and the onyx portal,
well pleased with my morning in such a place of peace and
good-will.

We drove back through the hot horizons of a burning noon; by
sombre Temacin with its far-seen tower, old watcher of the desert;
by the distant western oasis with its two gleaming koubbas, that
seemed to dissolve between the sands and the blue; by the Bedouin
tents crouched in the long drifts below the brow of the earthen
ruin whose walls gaped on the hill with fissure and breach. We
passed a bevy of bright-colored Bedouin women hurrying in their
finery to some Marabout to pray. The long slopes and mounded dunes
had not lost that wonderful enamel of the breath of the wind. All
nature seemed to stretch out in the glory of the heat. It was
spring on the desert; it was a dreaming world. â
Le vrai
Sahara
,â said Hamet, half to himself. And slowly over the palmy
plain, beyond the lost oasis, the tower and minaret of Tougourt,
slim lines on the sky, grew distinct in their turn, and solid, and
near, and we drove in through the garden green as over a threshold
of verdure. It was a great ride.

The day ended lazily. I had the pleasure of a few courteous
words with the agha of Tougourt, to add to my hospitable
distinctions. âHe is an Arabian prince,â said Hamet proudly, as we
walked away. Along the arcade I saw a Jew seated cross-legged, with
his back to the jamb of his shop; he held a heavy folio volume on
his lap and seemed to peruse it with grave attention; that was the
only time I ever saw a native reading a book in North Africa, and I
looked curiously at the fine venerable face. The boys were playing
leap-frog before the hotel as I came back from my walk; they had
thrown off their haiks, or jackets, or whatever their upper garment
might be. How they played! with what strong, young sinews and
vivacity of rivalry and happiness! though the children of the
street seemed often poor, destitute, and with faces of want. I
photographed two of these Bedouin boys, with whom I had made
friends. In the evening I sat outside and watched the camp-fires
burning by the camels in the square. I thought of the massacring of
the French garrison here forty years ago, and of the protests that
a military interpreter, Fernand Philippe, records from the lips of
the soldiers when a year or two later the government contemplated
withdrawing from this advanced desert post. It was a place of
home-sickness, of fever, and of utter isolation; but the soldiers
wished to stayâwithdraw? never!âand all this peace and prosperity
that I had witnessed was the French peace.

VI

It
was three oâclock in the morning when
I went out to start on the return under the stars. The streets were
dark and silent as we drove out; but the heavens were brilliant,
and the twin lights of Tougourt shone behind us like lighthouses as
we made out into the sandy plain. A few miles on we passed a
company of soldiers convoying a baggage-trainâstrong, fine faces
above their heavy cloaks, marching along in the night. The stars
faded and day broke quietlyâa faint green, a dash of pink, a low,
black band of cloud, and the great luminary rolled up over the
horizontal waste. The morning hours found us soon in the heavy
sands of the upland, with the old gray mosque and stretches of the

bois
, the desert drin, and we descended into the country of
the marine views, the land of the mirage, mirror-like waters
shoaling on banks of palm, dreaming their dream; and now it was
Ourlana and the school, fresh horses and an early arrival at
MraÃ¯er, and sleep in the caravanserai amid horses and camels and
passing soldiers, a busy yard. The chotts looked less melancholy as
we passed over the lowland in the bright forenoon, and again there
shimmered the far saltâthe ocean look where there was no sea, close
marine views, and there was much mirage; and we climbed the ascent
and glided on over the colored quartz, and the range of the AurÃ¨s
rose once more above the horizon, beautiful and calling, and AÃ¯n
Chegga seemed a familiar way-station. Fresh horses, and the last
start, and Bordj Saada seemed a suburb; and as we drove into
Biskra, with its road well filled with pedestrians and carriages,
it seemed like a return to Europeâso soon does the travellerâs eye
become accustomed to what at first was ârich and strange.â And
Hamet went to his baby boy.

SCENES AND VISIONS

I

IT was in my early days in the desert, and
Yussef told me tales. There was a Bedouin campâindicated vaguely in
the distance by a gesture; a real desert encampment. âWere there
many tents? Twenty? A hundred?â âThere might beâthousands!âwho
could know?â It was near an old French fort where some relative,
variously designated as little brother, step-brother, nephew,
cousin, was in charge; we would be welcome; there would be
cous-cous, real cous-cous, made in the desert. It was mid-winter;
but a caravan had come in last nightâthe roads were good.

So we set out on a bright, cold morning with a heavy carriage
and two large, strong horses, with wraps and rugs in plenty, and
some Christian stores, and drove out by old Biskra as the low sun
began his great circuit over the extended plain. It was my first
venture into those long reaches of the waste, with their
interminable roll into the horizons. The beautiful cliffs of the
AurÃ¨s began to stand up in their true grandeur, detaching
themselves from the level, massing their long line and isolating
the range in blue heavenâa wall of the world; the desert floor
spread out like endless shallows of a sea of marshes, rising and
falling with a vast undulation of shadows, far away; the winter
desolation solemnized the quiet scene. The road was good enough at
first, firm, though muddy; but the amount of water was surprising,
and after a few kilometres, when old Biskra was only a dark-ribbed
reef behind us, not to be distinguished from the other oases that
dotted the distances about, the scene suggested more than ever an
archipelago. It was soon heavy going continuously, and we were at
our best when we could keep the edge of a ridge along which a
lively brown stream poured turbulently. The land was wet, soaked,
but not submerged; and on all sides, at varying distances, were
living objectsâflocks, camels, menâand the herds, though they were
really far apart, gained an effect of number from the great spaces
that the eye took in. Except for the character of the landscape, it
would have been a monotonous drive; and it was high noon when we
drew up at the old French fort, Bordj Saada.

I went toward the brow of the hill. A solitary Arab, an old man,
was doing his devotions, and after I had passed, I turned and
looked at him. It was the first time I had seen an Arab praying in
the desert. With his face toward Mecca, he extended his arms and
made his genuflexions, prostrating himself, oblivious to all about
him; he was alone with his God. The ease and immediacy with which
an Arab withdraws into his religion, independently of time, place,
and circumstance, is one of the primary traits of the physiognomy
of the land. I kept on to the crest of the rise, and as my eyes
ranged over the great circuit of the field of vision the
impressions that had vaguely fed me all the morning came to a
climax and, as it were, focussed; it was a scene of the patriarchal
age. It was as if the dark film of my memories had suddenly
developed in my eyes the picture of Biblical lifeâthe Scriptural
landscape. The sky was filled with gray clouds in strata, spotting
the expanse, where tracts of light interchanged with the shadows;
and in the eternal vacancy, scarcely disturbed by the far, dark
line of some emerging oasis, everywhere in the sea of light and
distance were herds of camels, standing thin and tall, but
distinct, in the long perspectives, solitary or netted wanderingly
together, and straggling flocks with Bedouin boys in couples; here
and there a low, brown Bedouin tent crouched to the soil; yonder
was a brace of horsemen riding; the long line of a caravan behind
me was rounding the sweep of the hill up from Tougourt, with its
dwarfed camel leaders rudely clad. Few elements, but widely
distributed. Flocks and herds and weather; the life close to
nature; the lowly companionship of animals; the deeper feeling
always intensified in broad prospects, of the spiritual brooding of
nature aroundâin the blue and the sun and the cloud, in the distant
mountain range, and in land and water: the simple, early, primitive
world. It lay unfolded in such infinite silence, with such an
effect of agelessness and continuity, of the elemental thingâhuman
life on earth! To me it was early centuries made visible. It was
desert life first grasped by my eyeâprimary, quiet, enduring; and
how humble in its grandeur! The impression did not pass quickly
away, but persisted long afterward; however obscured by the
superficial incidents of the day, it emerged again; the mood was
always there within. It is not unusual for me, and I suppose not
for others, to live thus at times in a double consciousness of the
outward and the inward life, a twofold stream of being whose
currents never mix, whose fountains are different; but on that day
I especially marked the preoccupation and excitement of the deeper
element. It was as if from some Pisgah height I actually saw the
old Scriptural world.

Yussef came to tell me that the cous-cous was ready, for we had
been much delayed and everything was more than prepared when we
arrived. I went back to the old French post, an extensive
four-walled structure, built like a
fondouk
, with stables
and rooms on the inner sides, as a military rallying-point for
storage and harborage, and commanding the route to Tougourt. It had
been long disused and was in charge, apparently, of Yussefâs
âlittle brother,â who turned out to be a full-grown man with a
wife. She had cooked the cous-cous, and as I sat down to my meal in
one of the bare interior cells looking on the great yard, it was
brought in smoking. It is made of farina with small pieces of lamb
mixed with it, and was piled up in a great, yellowish cone, enough
for twenty appetites; and it was hot, not only in the ordinary
sense of fragrant fuming, but it had bowels of red pepper. It was
excellent, and I formed a liking for this
piÃ¨ce de
rÃ©sistance
of an Arab feast that has never since betrayed me.
Afterward there was coffee, with dates and an orange. So far as the
meal was concerned, our plan had been a brilliant success. I lit a
cigar with contentment, leaving Yussef and the rest to their own
share of the improvised fÃªte, and when he appeared again I said
impassively, âWell, the campâ; for I had not seen any signs of that
Timbuctoo which had lured me forth on the winter desert. âDo you
want to see the camp?â said Yussef. âYes,â I answered; âwhere is
it?â It was close by.

He led me out down the northern hillside a short distance,
toward a small enclosure on the slope, stopped, and said
â
VoilÃ !
â There was one Bedouin tent. A low hedge of fagots
surrounded it, on which a yellow dog frantically volleyed defiance.
âWell,â I said, âcome on; I want to see it.â But he stayed in his
tracks; and, as I looked back questioningly, he said with great
solemnity: âToo much dog!â A woman appeared, and he hailed her, and
we went off to halloo to her husband, who presently approached and
very willingly led me toward the tent. The woman had collared the
dog, and the man shouted to him, but he was irreconcilable. The
last word in my vocabulary of abuseâthat beyond which nothing can
goâis âthe manners of a Kabyle dogâ; and this one was a fair
specimen. As I came into the enclosure and stooped to enter the
tent, his fury knew no bounds. The woman, bending down, held him
securely with her arm tight about his neck, and the daughter, a
young and pretty girl, clutched his hind legs in a firm grip; and
he howled as well as he could. This was the central group in that
low interior; and the woman, with her black hair and full, gleaming
eyes, a face that in shape resembled that of an Indian squaw, heavy
silver hoops in her ears, and a short, muscular, full-bosomed
frame, was a striking and vital figure as she half strangled the
beast and cheerfully and with interest guided my undue curiosity. I
looked over the rude cooking arrangements, the bed, the strange
implementsâall the scanty furnishing of that human nest, almost
hidden in the wet ground of winter, close to the earth. They were
all polite and kindly and let me see and handle what I would. The
space was small, and one could not stand upright. This was âtheir
toil, their wealthââI thought of the Syracusan fishers of the old
idyl; and as I came away with snatches of it in my head, and the
faithful watch-dog again danced and barked maniacally on the
fagot-fence, I was glad that the poor fishers âhad no watch-dogâ;
and I forgot to reproach Yussef for his tale of Timbuctooânumbers
are vague things at best, and in Africa quite indescribable in
their behavior.

While the horses were being harnessed, I sought out my hostess,
the âlittle brotherâsâ wife, and found her in a deep, large kitchen
in one corner of the enclosure. She was dressed to receive me in
all her finery. She was tall and gaunt, and garbed like an
Ouled-NaÃ¯lâbright stuffs, rings, necklaces, ornaments, a barbaric
vision to my then unfamiliar eyes, and with the tinsel a good deal
rubbed off in places. She did the honors with touches of coquetry,
and showed me the place where the cous-cous had been concocted, the
cradle with the baby, and the
mÃ©nage
, and she took me up a
dark, winding, stone stairway to the bedroom above. It was

triste
thereâa place for a travellerâs murder, I thought, in
some French romance of feudal journey; when we descended, the
cavernous gloom and rude largeness of the kitchen, in which a good
many chickens were wandering about, seemed almost like a return to
sunshine and life. Then we said good-by to the little group of
various persons who had served us with so much good-will, and drove
off by another route, westward, toward the oasis of Oumach, a dark
line far away.

We swept into the country on higher ground, under a clearing
sky, and the panorama came backâthe primeval story of shepherd and
herding races, in the immutable grandeur of the great lines that
framed it. We were going toward the sun, and there seemed no limit
to the scene before and about us. It was the plane of its extension
that was wonderfulâand everywhere the intensity of the silence, the
clarity of distant objects, and that quality of the infinite which
no words, but only a real memory, can convey. Flocks and herds and
men, scattered at great intervals, lessened behind us and drew near
in the offing. The road was mud, but by no means the slough of the
morning. We met no one; only we were abroad in the wet waste. We
passed but one house, where there was an Arabâalso with dogs, but
not of the Kabyle varietyâwho gave us coffee; and the sun was
westering far when we came to the angle where we struck the Biskra
route and turned homeward. The dense blackness of the Oumach palms
showed like an island in the dying day, as we passed them, near at
hand; it was too late, too wet to stop there; and shortly afterward
the sun went down in a clear sky, immense and red on the desert
edge. Then I saw what was to me a remarkable phenomenon: a sunset
on the earth instead of in the heavens. The ground, more or less
overgrown with scattered vegetation, sloped upward in a long, bold,
westerly swell, and cut the horizon clear with its whole breadth;
and this wide-flung earth surface through its entire width flamed
scarlet, like a low prairie fire, burning with light; the ground
glowed rosy red, and the plants and shrubs and every growing thing
stood up, distinct in every twig and blade, as if on fire with
gold, burning unconsumed, and slowly all turned to scarlet and
faded to rich crimson, softened, paled and died. It was all on the
earth; at least, if there was any color in the clear sky above,
except the long horizon glow, I did not see it. I remembered a line
of Keats that had always troubled me, because I did not know what
he meant:

âWhile barrÃ«d clouds bloom the
soft-dying day,

And touch the stubble-plains with
rosy hue.â

I suppose it was a similar scene that he had witnessed. But in
my own experience I never saw anything remotely resembling the
marvel of that desert-kindled flame that brought black night.

It grew dark rapidly. There was no moon. The stars flocked out.
In the obscurity the slight noises of the wind grew insistent; the
cries of the camels in the darkness sounded weird. The road became
much worse. We dipped into pools, and as we advanced the tract was
entirely flooded. We went at a snailâs pace, the horses finding
their way in the level waters that stretched out like a lake in the
gloom. It was full night now. The water was at the hubs, and with a
lurch it came in on the carriage floor. We stopped, for it was
clear we were off the raised ground of the route on one side or the
other. Yussef had been very uneasy, as he might well be, for two of
the White Brothers had been drowned the previous week, travelling
somewhere in this wide waste. He threw his burnoose up and knotted
it, and drew up his garments beneath, and waded out to determine
the lay of the slopes. Then we turned to the rising side, and after
a hundred feet got onto the floor of the route again and kept it
till we had passed the flooded tract. There were two or three
Bedouin camp-fires on the west, and once we heard the sound of many
voices in the darkness round one of them. Yussef, who was
constantly in movement, asked me if I had a revolver, and where was
it? It was very handy. â
Bon!
â he said, with satisfaction.
But nothing could long distract my attention from the magnificence
of the sky. There was not a cloud. Sirius was in the east, and
Orion rising; and one by one I picked out the heaven marks of my
boyhood, north and west; but they shone with a splendor, a molten
luminousness, a size and lowness undreamed of, and the lesser
constellations were obscured by the multitude of starry lightsâit
was my first view of the desert sky at night. The whole heaven was
nebulous with scintillating sparks and milky drifts, innumerable
around and about the old leaders of the flock. It was a revelation
of the starry universe. I was brought back from my reverie by
Yussefâs whole-souled ejaculationââ
VoilÃ ! vieux Biskra!
â as
he sank back with a long sigh of relief into his seat. The oasis
was dark before us, and we were soon going by the earthen walls of
the silent village and passing under the tall black palms that
bordered the starred sky with their fronds, and caught the old
constellations in their tops, from which Orion, eastward, lifted
himself free in heaven. It was the end.

But how many times since then have the sights of that drive come
back to me! When I think of Esau and Ishmael, of Mizpah and Goshen,
I live over again the panorama of that winter day. It was not a
scene I had beheld; it was a vision.

II

The
dunes lie to the west of Biskra.
They are real sand-hills; one can climb on them, there are echoes
to be waked, and the plain stretches finely to the mountains
behind; but it is the forward view that holds the eye. The altitude
is not great, but high enough to give a perch something of the
commanding power of a cliff prospect over the sea, and the dunes
themselves reminded me vaguely of the Ipswich sand-hills of my own
coast and their sterile sea-views. The magical thing in the desert
is its unexpectedness; it is not at all like what one would have
thought. It is not to me oceanic; but in those first days, owing to
the moisture of the air and the wetness, it was more so than at a
later time. At some hours and under some lights the desert from the
dunes had touches of an April sea, fragments of its color; it was
blueânot with the solid blue of ocean, but with ethereal tints,
insubstantial veils, like inland August haze, or, to speak exactly,
with the moist blueness of March. A brilliant March over stretches
of melting snow crust by the sea is the bluest of all months; the
sky and the ocean are deeply tinged, and the trickling waters of
the snow surface reflect the heaven through pale gradations of the
universal hue, which, though nowhere intense, has great luminous
volume; it is a blue world. I suppose it was the low moisture
rising from the desert that took the reflections in bands and
spaces; the scene showed at times vast, distant lakes of pale
azure, violet lagoons, strips of fallen sky, indigo outlooksâfar
away âand all in that almost aerial tone, insubstantial, watery,
spring-like, infinitely soft and delicate. From the heights of El
Kantara, at the mouth of the pass that looks down on Biskra, such a
scene is superb in the morning air, and one might well think he was
going down to the roads of an inland sea unlike all others; and
from the dunes, in certain weather conditions, though on a far
lesser scale, one has this vision of the blue desert.

But it was not the blue desert that made the dunes a leaf in my
book of memory; it was a brown little Bedouin boy on a sand-hillock
whom I observed on my way home. I made his acquaintance. He was
about ten years old; his ragged, earth-colored garment blew round
his sturdy bare legs; he was capped with black hair, and his small
herd of goats fed beside him. He was shy, and his stolid, great
eyes looked up at meâthose young Arab eyes, expressionless, but
which a touch of joy irradiates, seeming to liquefy their shallow
light, making them soft like a caress. He was willing to be
acquainted. I fed him with chocolate, and extracted from him the
four French words he knew; but, notwithstanding the good offices of
ChÃ¨rif, whom I had with me, the best educated of the guides, and
now the master of the French-Arab school there, our conversation
was mostly confined to mutual kind looks. I left him after a while,
and a few moments later, as I was walking toward the carriage, he
began to sing. I turned. There he stood, erect on the hillock
against the desert slope and the low sky, with unloosed voice. The
high treble rose with a certain breadth and volume; but its quality
was its intensity. I would not have believed the silent little
fellow had so much voice in him. âWhat is it?â I said. âIt is for
you,â said the polite ChÃ¨rif; âit is to thank you.â âWhat does he
sing?â I asked. â
Un chant dâamour
â replied ChÃ¨rif; and I
could get no more from him except âblue eyesâ and â
lâamour
.â
I looked up at the boyâs earnest face, as he sang bravely on, and
listened; and when he had stopped we drove away, and the high
treble began again on the hillside.

The Arabs sing much, but this was the first time I heard song in
the desert. I always think of the desert silence as embosoming such
song, like the hum of insects in the grass; though it may be rare
as a birdâs wing, it is there in the great spaces; the desert, to
my imagination, is a song-laden air, like Italy; but the Italian is
garden song, the desert is wilderness song; the Italian is human,
the desert song seems almost a part of nature, a part of the
desert. I remember the Bedouin flutes and the low rhythms of the
road and the camp; but when I take up a book of Arab song, I see
the vision of the Bedouin boy on the hillock among his goats,
carolling his
chant dâamour
.

III

It
was the time of the April fÃªtes at
Biskra, and I went out in the delightful warmth of the early
afternoon to see. There were to be races, but I was especially
attracted by the promise of a falcon hunt. A long line of
white-robed Arabs streamed into the country fields, and I drove
amidst them by a quiet road shimmering with dust, and when I turned
by the great pen where the horses were kept, into the enclosure,
the crowd was already assembled. It was a large, open plain whose
side-lines were defined by the crowds of spectators who did not
enter. In the field were many scattered groups. French soldiers,
lining the course, and a squad gathered on a neighboring hill gave
the picturesqueness of military color to the scene; a little group
of soldier camels enlivened the foreground; and everywhere were
boys leading fine horses, venders of all sorts, velvet-eyed
children in gala clothes, grave Arab men. I wandered over to where
a company of white Mzabites, girt with brown cords, sat in a
circle, with guns in their hands, and a superb banner on a staff
floating over them, and to the place where the Ouled-NaÃ¯lsâsome
forty of themâdisplayed their charms and ornaments with holiday
faces. It was an animated scene of waitingâfestal, decorative;
native and European soldiers, pawing horses, prancing cavaliers,
crowds of white-robed Arabs, with ample spaces. The carriage of the
caÃ¯d of Biskra, drawn by two beautiful mules, stood next to me; he
was a grave old man, a mould of courteous dignity, and with him
were some young children in gay vestsâa charming party. But the
brilliant note of color was given by the red cloaks of the caÃ¯ds
and sub-caÃ¯ds, blowing in the wind as they rode here and there on
beautiful and spirited horses. Then there was a drawing in to the
course, and the races went onâtense moments of excitement as the
horses sped by, pauses and waits, like races everywhere.

One scene stands out from the memories of that day. It was just
before the hunting with the falcon began. It was a great and solemn
scene, fit for a painterâs eye, but no earthly canvas could hold
it. The landscape lines were all low and long, immense in
extension, the rigid lines of the desert firm and broad. The scheme
of composition was one of horizontal planes. In the eastern sky the
pink range of naked rock, the AurÃ¨s, cut the liquid blue with its
almost rosy edges, a bank of color reaching far away into the
distance; in the foreground, perhaps half a mile off, a second line
of red-toned sand-hills notched the range low down; beneath them,
and below the horizon line of the earth, stretched a long row of
white-robed Arabs massed standing in a continuous line, and grouped
together as in a bas-relief. Every figure was distinct in the
brilliant light poured from the descending sun on the vast
distances round about. I had never seen humanity and nature posed
in just that way. It was a processional bas-relief, immovable and
majestic, sculptured on the sand-hills and the rock; it was
monumental, architectural, Egyptian. The sight defined for me one
quality of desert landscape which I had vaguely felt; it is the
bas-relief of nature. The lowness of the visual plane, the clarity
of the human figures, the framing of the scene against which
everything is relieved, suggest to me the effects of bas-relief;
the repose of the Arab, too, the fall of the folds of his garment,
the simple actions, have more of the sculptural as a living-thing
than I have elsewhere observed. This scene was a supreme example of
my meaning and of the artistic intuitions involved; it simplified
my perceptions and also universalized them. I saw in it the arts of
Egypt on which the immensity of nature still rested, as truly a
desert art as the Moorish arabesques at Tlemcen. It was under this
splendid and glowing entablature that the black falcon was loosed
in air.

The gazelleâdelicate and fragile creatureâran a short way ahead;
the horsemen followed behind; the bird circled above, sighted his
prey, darted swiftly on, and swooped down, striking the animalâs
head. The gazelle staggered and ran on as the bird rose, and from
his height the falcon swooped again and struck; the animal fell,
but sprang up and ran here and there terrified. Againâand again the
little creature collapsed and bounded, ran on, but it was dazed and
circled feebly; and again the black shadow shot down from the blue,
and it was over. The horsemen ran in, and took the falcon from the
convulsive body, killed the gazelle, and flung a piece of the flesh
to the victor. It was brief and brutal; but it was the reality of
life, not human life, but Life itself on earthâthe spirit of life
as it might be in the desert without a human eye. I drove back
through the sunset cloud of dust among the solid press, and came
out on long lines of white-robed figures in procession ahead by the
countryside, vividly green with the warm spring. I had seen two
visions: one, that seemed almost of the eternal; the other, of
lifeâs momentâthe living bas-relief on the mountain wall, the
gazelleâs death agony in the sand. I think that the earth never
seemed to me more like a great amphitheatre than thenâa spectacle,
solemn, inscrutable, fated.

IV

The
processional is an inherent trait in
the desert landscape, owing to the fewness of the human figures and
their concentration in the vastness of the horizons. Everything
seems strung outâherds of goats, wandering camels, even the
scattered palms; and in the caravans or troops of horse or military
trains the feature is emphasized. It is the trait of a migratory
land. The
mise en scÃ¨ne
for a procession, in the true sense,
is superb. The eye centres the scene on the great space and views
it whole and entire at a glance; one could see the migration of a
tribe or the march of an armed host so.

These reflections came to me the next day when I returned to the
race-ground. The general scene was the same. A procession was
already forming at the upper end of the field. The white-robed
Mzabite group, with brown girdings round their loins and crossing
their backs and lacing their turbans, whom I had seen the previous
day with their guns, squatting about the splendid banner, were the
leaders of the formation, which was on foot. This was peculiarly
the Arabsâ day. On the rising ground the procession gradually took
shape and stretched out against the sky and the low palms, a long,
white line of moving figures, with the high standard borne proudly
advanced, Arab music, guns gleaming and sometimes held in the air.
It moved, not with a martial look in the European sense, but with
an aspect of oriental war. They were marching to be reviewed by
their chief near the centre of the course, and to perform before
him their
fantasia
, an Arab war game, in which one rank
advances rapidly upon another, fires, and whirls swiftly back. They
came down the track in gallant show, and as they passed the old
chief the mÃªlÃ©e began. Those in front turned to face the rank
behind; the second line rushed frantically forward in confusion,
every man for himself, fired their guns almost amid the feet of
those before them, whirled back waving their weapons, and came on
again, repeating the manÅuvre. There was a great noise of powder,
plenty of smoke and commotion; their bodies were all in violent
action, their faces distorted with excitement, their garments
fluttering. They came squad after squad, as the groups slowly
worked by, and the din began farther up the line. It was a great
game, vivid, spectacular, with the smell of powder biting the
nostrils, the rouse of fighting blood, the drifting clouds of
smokeâa waking dream of personal combat; and they thoroughly
enjoyed it.

Then came the turn of the
goum
, the cavalry. The caÃ¯ds,
splendid figures in their brilliant red burnooses, came first.
Each, single and alone, charged down the course on the gallop with
headlong speed, holding in the right hand a gun in air and in the
left a sabre; and as they passed the old chief they saluted with
the sabre and discharged the gun, and swept on till the thunder of
their hoofs died away down the track. The
goum
followed, a
fine body of horsemen, with similar tactics. The Arabs are expert
in horsemanship as an art of riding, but it is said they are
deficient in that part of the art which lies in care for the mount;
they kill their horses. On that day the spectacular charging, the
discharge of firearms in motion, the jockey-like cling and rhythm
of bodies under the streaming folds of the riders, the
Ã©lan

of the troop, were fascinating, as all skilled physical motion and
its accoutrement is to my eyes; but whether my battle sensations
were exhausted, or for some other reason, the sight did not
interest me so much as the earlier mimic combat on foot. It was not
the proper setting for the
fantasia
of the
goum
. One
should see it in the desert when the charging troop comes over the
sands to salute some chief or Marabout with his grouped attendants,
riding as if to overwhelm, discharging its guns at close quarters,
wheeling just in time to avoid the shock of the horses. Here on the
race-course it was a show; there in the sands it is a native
custom, vivid and gallant with the spirit of a raceâa flower of
desert chivalry.

What had drawn me to the fÃªte was the desire to see the Arab
temperament in some of its violent manifestations. One habitual
trait of Arab life to the eye is the repose of its figures, seated
or in motion; the grave courtesy, the immobile posture, the public
dignityâthe decorum. But, speaking of the race, this is the repose
of a tropic animal; it wakes to an instant intensity of action, to
a tiger violence. It was something of this side of Arab nature that
I sought; and I found some suggestion of it in the mimicry of
personal combat, the excitement, the confusion, the distorted faces
and bodily vehemence of the play; and also in the
goum
some
intimation of the look of their leaders, the old feudality of the
desert. It all helped me to reconstruct the warrior, marauding,
internecine, old desert world; but it was only fragments of vision.
What a vivid race in its splendid and gallant spiritâas full of
fascination there as it is dingy in its sodden poverty, earth-bound
and earth-soiled, pitiable in its
misÃ¨re
.

V

It
was the music of the AÃ¯ssaouas in the
night. The din was terrific, barbaric, ear-piercing, instruments
and voices, as I entered the little, roughly boarded hall,
sufficiently but none too well lighted, in which hung a slight haze
of smoky vapor. There were upward of a score of the order with
their chief standing, and a few men were seated on one side, who
made a place for me among them. The group in front, close by,
filled a small, oblong space, in the midst of which over a fire was
a fuming pot; near by it two or three musicians were beating the
native drum, others struck cymbals, and a line of men, standing and
swaying, lifted a keening rhythm of human voices in a continuous
cry. A monotonous unison governed the whole music, which came in
cadences, falling to a lower note and slower motion, then rising
with swift acceleration to a sort of paroxysm, shrill and rapidly
vibrating, and again dropping down till a fresh impetus sent the
hard, strong, climbing pulse of the rhythm on its high crescendo.
There was never any pause; again and again it culminated and fell
away; but it could no more stop than blood. Cymbals, drums,
voicesâcontinuous din at first, and then a felt rhythm; it was a
whip on the senses. Three or four of the figures were more excited;
occasionally one bent his head into the fumes of the pot and took
long breaths; these would dance, utter wild cries, creep about with
muscular contortions, but no one seemed to pay much attention
except the chief. He was a tall, large man, of uncommon physical
vitality evidently, heavily wrapped in a white burnoose, turbaned;
and it was plain that nothing in the room escaped his eye for a
moment, as he stood to one side overlooking, and from time to time
giving an order of care or restraint for the more excited
participants. Once accustomed to the noise and the lights, my eyes
found much detail. A man just at my right, with the stare and
spasmodic gesture of a halfwitted person, was devouring pieces of
the great leaves of the thorn cactus as if it were lettuce. Another
went about chewing pieces of broken glass, which he begged for
pitifully, to all appearance, and was as pleased when he got it as
a child with candy; he ate it with avidity, like a ravenous animal.
There seemed to be no arrangement about anything, nothing
designated beforehand, but every one did as he pleased, while the
shrill music rose and fell, the feet beat time, and the few who
were given over to the intoxication, turbanless and half-garmented,
swung among their brothers in a kind of exaltation and partial
collapse that were dervish-like.

Suddenly a young man who was standing near me undid his turban,
threw off the blouse he wore, and, entering the central group among
the musicians, bent down his head over the fire and inhaled the
fumes with long gasps. He joined in the cry of the voices, danced,
and grew quickly excited; he drew his shirt over his head, and
thus, half naked, went again to the fire. At a sign from the chief
two other men attended him, one on each side, and supported him;
and shortly afterâhe may have been ten minutes under the
influences, in allâthe chief joined them, and the group came slowly
toward me, making the circuit of the others. The youth knelt
directly between my knees. He was, perhaps, eighteen, with a
handsome face somewhat ascetically lined, but that may have been
due merely to his poverty. He was well formed and muscled, bare to
the waist. He seemed entirely dazed, and dependent for direction on
those about him; his body was bathed in sweat and trembled
violently all over; every particle of his flesh quivered; his eyes
rolled, showing the whites in vivid contrast to his black hair, and
he panted, as if he craved something intensely and blindly. He
threw his head far back, exposing his throat, and one of the men,
who held a long, straight sword over him, sank the point just at
the base of the throat. It was not a deep cut, but the blood flowed
freely, trickling down his breast. The whole took place so near me
that I could easily have touched the youth without reaching; my
knees were almost against his arms. The others helped him to rise,
still apparently unconscious, and led him off to one side. Then the
surprising thing occurred. The chief held the boy in his arms
tenderly, stroked him, caressed his cheeks, kissed him; the boyâs
head lay on his breast. Suddenly, as if with a snap, he came to,
and instantly seemed perfectly normal, with no trembling, no
convulsion, no sign of his previous state. He was let alone, and in
the most unconcerned manner put on his shirt and blouse, arranged
his turban, and after standing about a few minutes went away.

I stayed on, and my attention was attracted by a little fellow
of eight or ten years, a bright street boy, who was wandering about
among the others. He got some sort of permission from the chief,
and they passed a knife through his right cheekâclear through. He
was very proud of the feat, and walked up and down, shaking his
head to make the knife waggle on its outer hilted side; but he was
not at all excited. I remained perhaps an hour, and then shook
hands with the chief, who was gravely courteous, and I went out
under the stars; and the din died away in the distance.

The AÃ¯ssaouas are an order of magicians and are widely spread
from Morocco, where they have their centre at MeknÃ¨z, through
Algeria and Tunis. Their founder was Sidi Mohammed-ben-AÃ¯ssa, of
whom many marvellous miracles are related, but all are of the
nature of prestidigitation; the association is, indeed, in some
ways, a guild of that art. Its repute, however, among the Moslems,
has its roots in the old magic of Africa, and rests on the habits
of superstition which are the common ground of the veneration of
the miracle-working Marabouts. The AÃ¯ssaouas claim immunity from
many mortal ills. Nothing that they may eatâscorpions, stones,
glassâcan harm them; poisons are innocuous; wounds close at once
and disappear. They are naturally the physicians for such ills in
others, and are snake-charmers and wonder-workers. They are very
nomadic in their habits, and go widely through the land. Many wild
reports are current of their rites at their fÃªtes, of their
sacrificing animals and tearing the flesh in pieces and devouring
it raw; but these and other like things are traits of the orgiastic
state in the lower stages of civilization everywhere.

It was a faint shadow of the primeval that I had seen. That
human cry, mixed with the sharp cymbals and the drums, frantically
wavering and receding, was an echo from the central forests far
inland; and that fire with the pot was the ghost of fetichistic
rite, perhaps the oldest altar of mankind. The scene, the swaying
figures, the intoxication of the body, the atmosphere, belonged to
the earliest psychic experiences of the race. It suggested the
invisible superstition that lays over and fills the present minds
of the populace and the desert dwellers. I found the little boy on
the street the next day, and he recognized me. I examined his mouth
closely, and there was only a white roughness, like a scar, on the
inside of his cheek and a scratch on the outside. He became very
friendly; and my pleasantest memory of the AÃ¯ssaouas is of his
street-boy figure standing on the desert, a quarter of a mile or
more down the railway track, where he had gone to get near to my
train and give me his last good-by with waving hands.

VI

The
fascination of the desert, that
which makes a desert lover, is not in its incidents, voyages,
sights; it is in its life. It is the life of nature. I do not mean
the picturesqueness of its human traits, the passage of men and
animals over a scene with which they are so sympathetically colored
as to seem only a part of its flora and fauna, its transitory
efflorescence; nor the landscape with its breadths, infinities,
hallucinations, hierarchies of color,
Ã©lans
of the soul and
poems of the eye, with which they are in conscious contact. It is a
more intimate tie, and something that passes withinâpurifies,
refreshes, and releases. The brain ceases to act; the nerves are
put to sleep; the fever is over. The Old World has receded far
away; years, decades have passed, dropping their burden of oblivion
on all that was, and especially on what was acrid and fiery in the
past. It is a return to nature in which she seems to have cast out
devils. The senses bring their messages, but they have lost their
material utilities. The soul rests in its sensations as a bird
floats in the air. It is a foretaste of Nirvana. Thought has
ceased; duty is silent; labor has vanished; and the life that is
deeper than these and of which they were but mortal fragments,
âunconcerning things,â resurges, vibrates, flowers. What a relief!
what a transmigration! and what a new sense of vitalityâalmost of a
new sort of vitality! It is the repose, the silence, the
concentration of being withinâthe peace. In the Western world one
may attain this at times; the desert imposes it as the habit of the
soul that yields itself to its influences. But it is more than
this. The cerebral weight is lifted and the physical life resumes
its natural lethargies. It is not really lethargic. It is a new
kind of existenceâthe life, unburdened by thought, that has moulded
the fine physical nature of this race abounding in energies. What a
sense of freedom, of nonchalance and timelessness! What a vigor as
I draw in this pure air! The world without a thought has a life of
its own, a strange vivacity; it is rich with fresh and unexpected
pulses of being; and this renewal and invigoration does not come
whip-like, as in the north, with a bracing winter stroke on the
blood and nerves; but like a caress, with a softness and a secrecy,
a tenderness of the solitude, something almost voluptuous.

These are the words of a desert lover and make no claim on the
credence of others; but no words can express the peace, the
liberty, the vitality I felt in my desert voyages. The symbol and
image of the mood and life I describe is to me the palm-tree. No
other tree has ever so influenced my spirit except the cypress in a
very different way. I would go out to the oued in the morning, for
I could not spare to the day the initial sense of largeness, the
tranquil desolation, the sea suggestion of the river bed, with its
lonely koubba; and, as the sun warmed, I wandered into the palm
gardens of the oasis, and sat on the rough soil, and, as it were,
adored the palms. I would lie there for hours, and the sun shone
above them. Occasionally Arab workmen would pass near, or a boy or
a guardian would come and sit beside me. Otherwise there was only
the solitude, the unbroken silence, the repose. The gardens are
rude and unkempt, with earth ditches and humps of ground, and an
arid look, except where the vivid green of some cereal here and
there beneath the palms, or the softer form and foliage of low
fruit trees amid their towering stems, give a brighter and more
delicate touch to the general scene. There is no luxury of turf or
anything garden-like in these precincts of earth and running waters
and trees. There is no effeminacy in the palm. Severity is the
artistic trait of everything in the desert. The long lines of the
landscape here are rigid, solemn, sombre; the naked rock of the
mountain ranges is stern, worn to the bone by wind and rain and
sand; except for the diaphanous and veiling effects of atmosphere
and heat, and the cloud and mist conditions that I have mentioned
earlier, an austere sublimity governs the horizons and vistas all
around. Even in the sands of the south about Tougourt, where every
line the eye rests on is a curve and softens on the eye and lulls
it like a diapason of great rhythms, this austerity is not lost
from the desert scene. It is the nude in landscapeânot mere
nakedness of earth, but landscape sculptured and modelled in grand
harmonies of line and color; and however it may become fiery with
light and heat and darken with the violence of heaven, it always
retains its look of bare and solitary power. There is no softness
in the race either. Their bodies are cast in hard lines, but often
with great physical beauty. There faces are, indeed, seldom of the
nobler type; but their fine brown hands, their clear torsos and
throats, the curve of strength and elasticity in their firm backs
and limbs, with the weathered and sun-toned skin, their

fiertÃ©
, their perfection of repose, are objects of delight
to an eye that values bodily beauty. To me this splendid vigor and
careless abundance of the human beauty of life is one of the
elements of the land. They have muscles of steel and lines of
living bronze. It is daily artâart brought down from the vague of
fancy and out of the museum to live with. The palm is like the land
and the people; there is no softness in it; it is the most virile
of vegetable growths. Its trunk, its leaves, its swayâbut I will
not trust myself to describe it. I am never lonely with a palm to
look at. I lie on the ground for hours and gaze up at their massed
green tops in the blue and the sun and the warmthââtheir feet in
the water, their heads in the fire.â I am never tired of looking. I
do not notice the absence of thought. I am quiet, content, and
doing nothing am very much alive if vaguely aware of my life. It is
a new mode of living, this vital dreamingâa
voluptÃ©
without
weakness, consciousness without meditation, vision without thought.
That is the human aspect of this life of nature; and, in the world
without, the palm over there symbolizes it for me.

The soldier-poet, Lieutenant Charles Lagarde, whose âPromenade
dans le Saharaâ I have already mentioned as at once the most
realistic and best-portrayed book of the Sahara with which I am
acquainted, well describes the palm:

âA monumental tree, puissant, royal; it shares in perfection
form, majesty, elegance. Its isolated trunk fills a frame of five
leagues and peoples a solitude. Its lift toward heaven has a
magnificent simplicity, and it raises also the levels that surround
it; it enlarges by contrast the vast sheets of sand on which it
elongates at sunset its slender and unmeasured shadow. In groups it
has attitudes full of grace; among the tufted shoots rise the
unequal and diverging trunks which in turn depress and proudly hold
up their plumes. The wind in the palms has strange modulations. Its
oscillations have I know not what of the voluptuous; it is the
sultana that sways, an attentive slave. The tempest tests it
without shaking it; it bends like a bow and springs back with the
strength of a sword-blade. All in it breathes primordial energies,
and chants the canticle of the Orient.â

VII

The
crudities of the desert have a charm
all their own. There is a wild flavor not only in the life but in
the nostrils. The strong saltpetre smells, impregnating the air for
leagues, the earthy scents of the marsh-like and sodden soil, the
odors of cattle, are stimulants; they recall the whiff of salt
marshes by the sea, the tarred ropes of wharfs, the sharp fragrance
of rolled seaweed on the beaches, aromas of low tide, in days of
long ago. They are both prophecies and memories. They wake my
boyhood blood and are a renewal of long slumbering appetites. I
want salt in my life, an acrid savor. The desert dispenses with
unnecessary refinements; all pruderies cease; nature returns.
Nature is clean; the wind and the sun are great scavengers; even
death is no longer a corruption, but a negligible detail. The
skeletons of the camels in the sands have nothing
macabre
;
they are there as the tamarisk and the drin are there, objects of
the sands, like floating spars at sea, wasting away in the great
deep; they show the way that life has gone. Even the dogs, with
their paws on the carcass, tearing the flesh, seem ordinary; the
brutality ceases in the primeval naturalness of the act in the
scene. It is the will of nature that rules there in the wild, and
is accepted almost without notice. It is the same, too, with human
life. Poverty, hardship, privation, lose half their repugnancy; it
is only when men dispense them that they revolt us; humanity
accepts necessary suffering with little appeal. The eye hardens,
the heart stiffens; the fibre of an older world forms in us. It is
a veritable return to nature. Old instincts awake; old powers of
endurance come back and bring with them old moods of patience; old
indifferences appear. Cruelties of man or nature are incidents. A
new resistance is unlocked in the body, in the spirit. It is a
strong life. It is the desert world.

It is under these lights that one contemplates the wretched
human lot in the wild glory of nature. The grandeur of the natural
sceneâthe miserable life of menâno eye can miss that contrast over
all these horizons. The splendid force of nature, visible in all
its energies, on a scale of sublimity, triumphant, the master of
the world! But lifeâit is
la misÃ¨re
. Look at the crouching
tent, irregularly striped with brown and white, wool and camel
skin, pitched under the crest of the great yellow dunes or in some
wrinkle of the rock face of the waste. There are a few sacks of
barley and dates, a scanty provision for the future, heaped at the
foot of the pole; a wooden plate or two, cups, an earthen pot;
ropes, a goatskin of water, mats of alfa or other grass to sleep
on. The wife, with a babe on her back and others tumbling about,
toils through the day, draws water, boils the pot, weaves, bears
the heavy burden. The boys go with the herd, the man to his labor.
The night is an uneasy watch. The master sleeps, some weapon near
by, his head on the little sack that holds the womenâs trinkets of
coral or silver, or other trifles of value to them; if there is
money, it is buried. The yellow dog with the pointed teeth growls,
and howls, and barksâa jackal, a thief. Such is the day and night
of the tent, the nomad life, moving from place to place with the
seasons, subject to all weathers, threatened by violent winds and
sudden torrents, and often flitting day by day and leaving no
trace. When a stay is more prolonged a hedge of fagots fends the
tent from the wind, and gives a slight protection against nocturnal
attacks of other wanderers. One sees the tent; it is a common
object, and gives up its bareness at a glance; but one cannot
realize its life. It is too near to the soil, to the deprivations
and insecurity of animal life. What humility in its joys and pains!
What parsimony! What a place for age, which comes rapidly here, and
is isolated in its uselessness! Death reaps in it as in a harvest.
The weak, the old, the stricken, in this life of continual
contingency, go quickly away, and are as quickly forgotten. It is
the life. The infant mortality is enormous, like the death-rate of
creatures that spawn in order that the race may survive.

The life of the tent is on the outer margin of observation,
though it is the nomadic life of the land. Where the natives gather
together in villages one sees them more nigh. In a Europeanized
place like Biskra, the native quarter of the townânot the village,
which lies in the oasisâtakes on the look of a ghetto. There, in
the street, in the market, one sees the poverty of the Arabs, the
slender pittance of their days, wherever the humble wants and lean
provision of their life emerge to public view; and Biskra is a
place of great prosperity. There are many villages in the Rir
country, however, that are quite untouched by the European. They
have not the look of dilapidation and misery of the ksour of the
Sud-Oranais, scarce distinguishable from the soil, dark and fallen
warrens; but they are only a degree removed from that, and their
life must be analogous. Arab poverty you may see anywhere in the
land, but the full sense of it comes and sinks in only when one has
broken the blank wall of the secrecy of such a village, and in some
outlying place of their own, in the sand and the sun, gone into
their houses. When a poor Arab enters his house it is as when some
animal leaves the life of the forest for his hole in the
ground.

One day I went up to El Kantara, the station at the mouth of the
pass above Biskra, whose superb view, so often described, first
gives to the traveller the measureless vision of the warm-toned,
sterile lands, an empire worthy of the sun, and unrolls before his
eyes for vague leagues the red and yellow earths, spotted by the
black of the oasis-greenâthe desertâs âpanther skin,â in the old
Romanâs phrase. In the gorge below lies a great palmerai with three
villages, and there I wandered all one winter day. I entered one of
themâthe first I had ever seenâand passed among the low houses
through the narrow lanes. They were made of sun-dried mudâa
continuous blank wall with rough-boarded entrances. It might have
been a low line of rude stables. There was hardly any one in the
streets; occasionally a figure came into view, and passed out of
sight. There was intense silenceâthe silence of nightâbroken
perhaps by the sound of a hammer, or a muffled voice in some
interior. The streets were slimy and foul. It was
desolationânothing. It was depressing. The bright sun shone upon
all; the cold, vivid green of the palmerai lifted its eyebrow
masses against the stone of the cliffs and the intense blue of the
sky; in the silence it might have been a dead village, a ruin in
some abandoned land, like Yucatan. The strange sadness which is
here so often felt and seems to exhale from the desert landscape,
which is independent of brilliancy or gloom, a feeling so intimate
as to be almost physical, like the languor of heat, lay on
everything. It was
la tristesse
, which is universal in the
desert, the pathos of âsomething far more deeply interfusedâ and
infinitely sad; it lurked in the air, the silence, the distance, in
the lightâeverywhere.

I went into some of the houses. They were obscure. The shadows,
the damp earth smells made them seem like caves in the ground. They
were bare, rude, humble beyond description. I would not have
believed that a man who had seen the sun could live in such a
cellar-like abode. I was not naturalized then, not subdued to the
land; it was a shock to my sensibilities; but later I would stand
in such a place and, like my soldier-poet, feel glad that it was
not Paris or Marseilles. One easily detaches himself from
civilization if the desert talks to him long. One room stamped
itself upon my memory. It was a dark, bare bedroom; the bed was
made of rough timber, the unstripped bark still on its four posts;
there was little else in the room. But on the walls there were
three or four beautifully written Arab textsâverses of the
Koran.

âSo near is heaven to our earth,â

I thought, instinctively varying the line to the case; it was an
unconsciously bitter jest. It sometimes seems that devotion in
races is in proportion to the fewness of the blessings that the
lord of heaven and earth gives to his wandering creatures, and this
was in my mind. But that bare, earth-walled room with its texts is
my most vivid symbol of Arab piety. It is a believing race.

I remember when the reality of their belief first struck home to
me. I was driving on the high plains below the peaks of the range
on their northern side, returning from Timgad, that magnificent
ruin of a Roman city of high civilization which still lifts erect
its vistas of columns over the strewn ground of the abandoned
plain, and in its vacant desolation brings back to me more vividly
than Pompeii, with a greater nobility and dignity, with a finer
imperialism, the great Roman world. I had seen it diminish and sink
in the low sunlight, and drop behind. Night had long fallen over
the uninhabited, long, Colorado-like, starlit slopes where we
drove. It was bitter cold, and I had just drawn another sweater
over the head of my Arab boy beside me. Suddenly he said with quick
and earnest tones: â
Le bon Dieu
will take care of you.â I
was startled by the intensity of the unexpected voice. â
Le bon
Dieu
,â I said; âwhat do you mean?â The boy gazed at me
steadily. I could see the gleam of his deep eyes in the starlight.
â
Le bon Dieu
,â he said, and nodded up to the sky. That nod
was the most convincing act of faith I ever saw. It was plain that
he believed in God as he believed in the reality of his own body. I
fell silent, thinking in how marvellous ways we are taught; for the
boy taught me something. And as the earthen room with its texts is
a symbol to me of Arab piety, the boyâs gesture is my symbol of
Arab faithâ
la foi
.

I emerged from the obscurity into the brilliant silence of the
day; but I could not shake off my oppression. The strange sadness,
whose nature I have hinted at, which belongs to the desert, was
beginning to make itself known to me. It does not come from the
land; it is exhaled from the human spirit in contact with its
mortal fate. It may be felt anywhere on the earth; but its home is
in the desert. It is sometimes more defined amid the ruins of old
cities, or where great tragic events of the race have left their
traces on the scene or in the memoryâ
sunt lacrimÃ¦ rerum
.
Here it is indefinable, a moodâ
mentem mortalia tangunt
;
something that haunts the brilliancy before the rainless eyes of
the race of men who do not lament any particular catastrophe or
weep an unusual loss; a half-unconscious sense of the spirit
penetrated and impregnated with having lived, with a feeling of its
common lot, its universal fate. It marries with the monotony of
things, of life. What monotony of life must be here! Who could
understand such lives! I felt a darkness under all that I had seen
of Arab existence. There is another side, an underworld, beneath
what appears on the surface. Read the annals of Arab war, of Arab
love, of Arab rule. What cruelty, what baseness, what rapacity!
What a power of hate! No pen can tell the horrors of their warfare,
their lust for blood and pain, their delight in carnage and
savagery. It is the same with the story of their amoursâviolent,
unmeasured, remorselessâexplosions of life. The natural happiness
of the race is in these things. So they paint the paradise before
the French came, when âthe true believers divided their time
between love, hunting and war, and no one died without having known
the drunkenness that an adored mistress or a day of powder gives.â
In the race at large, what lower forms does this heritage of the
wild take on! One may read the books, hear living tales, share in
actual scenes, and so come to stand in the fringes of their
experience and temperament; but he does not penetrate into the Arab
soul.

I wandered all day in the palmerai and along the river bank,
loitered and forded and climbed, and enjoyed sun and wind and
prospect; but the echo of the morning sadness did not leave me, nor
did it fade from the atmosphere. The desert life had laid its hand
upon me. Later, day after day, as I stood in its lights and
shadows, and began to understand, the desert moods grew at once
more precise and more commingled, and one among them all seemed to
absorb the others. It was the feeling of fatality in all things. It
is sympathetic with the drift of my own consciousness. In my common
days the sphere of our forethought and volition seems small. Our
freedom is no more than a childâs leash from the doorstep. We are
embedded in an infinite body of law and circumstance; not much is
trusted to ourselves alone. Within this narrow range human liberty
is a creation of civilization, a partial dethronement of the
tyranny of nature without, and of impulse within, a victory of
knowledge, invention, and conscience. Submission is written all
over the desert world, which is still in touch with the savage
state. There man yet remains in large measure the slave and sport
of nature and of his own unreasoned vital instincts. It is true
that our diminished and shorn personal liberty in the state is a
tame wine to the rich vintage of the freedom of the barbarian to
kill, to rape, to robâto eat up his neighbor and all that is his.
The barbarian is the true superman, that monster of an
all-devouring and irresponsible self-will. The soul of the desert
is not barbarous, but emerging from barbarism; it is on the way to
some command of nature and to self-rule, and is rich in the ferment
of life forces and in personal adventure; but it knows the iron net
of necessity in which it is enmeshed. How extraordinary it is to
observe that it is from the freedom of desert life that fatalism
emerges in its most rigid and thought-vacant form! The first words
of the struggling soul in its dim self-consciousness, amid the
throes of impotency and defeats of effort, world-wide are: âIt is
written.â The will of nature, the will of Allah, the will in which
is our peace, however the formula be read, is the deepest
conviction and last resort of humanity in the stage which it has
not yet known, if it shall ever know, to transcend. Fatality stares
from the face of the desert, and drops from the lips of its
wandering race like leaves from the dying forest. It is the period
of all their prayers.

Moods of the desert, which are also scenes and visions! the
infinity, the solitude, the monotony;
la misÃ¨re, la foi, la
tristesse
; fate, peace! They are not words, but things; not
thoughts, but experiences; not sentiments, but feelings. On the
page they are shadows; there they are realities.

ON THE MAT

VI

ON THE MAT

I

IT was afternoon in a small oasis village of
the Zibans. I was seated on a straw mat in a little garden-space
just outside the cafÃ©, and dreamily regarding the intense blue sky
through the vine leaves trellised overhead, which flecked me with
their shadows. An old Arab was praying just in front. Two groups,
one on each side of me, were placidly seated on clean, yellow
matsâyoung men, whose dark, sad faces, thin-featured and
large-eyed, contrasted with their white robes. They were smoking
kifâa translucence of gold in their clear, bronze skin, a languor
of light in their immobile gaze, content. The garden made off
before me, topped with palmy distance; the silent street, to one
side, was out of sight, as if it were not. It was a place of peace.
I had finished my coffee and dates. I filled my brier-wood. The May
heat was great, intense; and I settled myself to a long smoke, and
fell into reverie and recollection.

How simple it all was! That praying Arabâwhat an immediacy with
God! What a nonchalance in the dreamy pleasures of those
delicate-featured youths! What a disburdenment was here! I had only
to lift my index-finger to heaven dying, to be one of the faithful;
and the fact was symbolic, exemplary, of the simplicity of Islam.
It makes the minimum demand on the intellect, on the whole nature
of man. I had but lately placed the faith in its true perspective,
historically. Mohammedanism, the Ishmael of religions, was the
elder brother of Protestantism, notwithstanding profound
differences of racial temperament between them. The occidental mind
is absorbent, conservative, antiseptic. It is not content, like the
Mohammedan, to let things lie where they fall, disintegrate,
crumble, and sink into oblivion. Western education fills the mind
with the tangle-foot of the past. Catholicism was of this racial
strain. It had a genius for absorption. It was the melting-pot of
the religious past, and what resulted after centuries was an
amalgam, rich in dogma, ritual, and institution, full of
inheritance. The Reformation was an attempt to simplify religion
and disburden the soul of this inheritance in so far as it
contained obsolete, harmful, or inessential elements; many things,
such as saintâs worship, art, celibacy, were excised.
Mohammedanism, ages before and somewhat differently placed,
initiating rather than reforming a faith, was an effort of the
desert soul to adapt to itself by instinct the Semitic tradition of
God that had grown up in it, and to simplify what was received from
its neighbors. The founder of Islam was more absolute and radical
in exclusion than the reformers in elimination. Islam had a genius
for rejection. Mohammed, with the profound monotheistic instinct
that was racial in him, affirmed the unity of God with such
grandeur and decision that there was no room in the system for that
metaphysical scrutiny of the divine nature in which Catholic
theology found so great a career; on the other hand, with his
positive sense of human reality, which was also racial, he shut out
asceticism, in which Catholic conscience worked out its illustrious
monastic future. He had achieved a reconciliation between religion
and human nature in the sphere of conduct, and he had silenced
controversial dogma in its principal field in the sphere of
theology.

A creed so single and elementary had no need of a priesthood to
preserve and expound it. There was no room for a clergy here, and
there was none. The Reformation diminished but did not end the
priest; Islam suppressed him; yet there remained much analogy
between Mohammedanism and Protestantism in the field of religious
phenomena in which the priest is embryonic. Protestantism is the
best example in human affairs of the actual working of anarchy;
and, in proportion as its sects recede from the authority and
organization of the Catholic Church, it presents in an increasing
degree, in its individuality of private judgment and freedom of
religious impulse, the anarchic ideal of personal life. Islam
offers in practice a similar anarchy. I was struck from the
beginning with an odd resemblance to my native New England in this
regard. It, too, has been a Marabout-breeding country, with its old
revivals, transcendentalists, new lights, Holy Ghosters, and
venders of Christian Science. Emerson was a great Marabout. The
Mormons, who went to Utah and made a paradise in the desert, were
not so very different from the Mzabites who planted an oasis-Eden
in the Saharan waste. The communities that from time to time have
sprung up and died away, or dragged on an unnoticed life in country
districts, are analogous, at least, to the zaouias scattered
through this world of mountain and sand. In many ways my first
contacts with the faith were sympathetic. The faith that had no
need of an intellectual subsidy, that placed no interdict on human
nature, that interposed no middlemen between the soul and God, woke
intelligible responses in my agnostic, pagan, and Puritan
instincts; here, too, was great freedom for the religious impulse
and toleration of its career; and I saw with novel interest in
operation before my eyes the religious instinct of man, simple in
idea, direct in practice, free in manifestation, and on the scale
of a race. It was the desert soul that was primarily interesting to
meâits environment, its comprehension of that, its responses
thereto; and, examining it thus, its religion seemed a thing

intime
and scarcely separable from its natural instincts and
notions.

What is it that is borne in on the desert soul, when it wakes in
the great silence, the luminosity, the boundless surge of the sands
against the sky! Immensityâthe feeling of the infiniteânature
taking on the cosmic forms of God. The desert is simple. It has few
features, but they are all elements of grandeur. It is the mood of
the Psalms. Awe is inbred in the desert dweller. There is, too, a
harmony between these few elements in their superb singleness and
his lowly mind; not much is required of him, and that little is
written large for his understanding; he takes things in wholes. His
mind is primary, intuitive, not analytical; he does not multiply
thought, he beholds; and this vision of the world he lives in, a
wonderfully grand and simple world, suffices for a religious
intuition as native to him as the palm to the water-source. The
palm is a monotheistic tree. Monotheism belongs to the desert. The
faith of the desert is a theism of pure nature, unenriched by any
theism of humanity, of the human heart in its self-deification; it
is a spiritualization of pure nature worship, whereas Christianity,
at least under some aspects, is the grafting of a human ideal on an
old cosmogony. The God of the desert is an out-of-doors god, like
the Great Spirit of the Indians, who had no temples. No mosque can
hold him; there is no altar there, no image. He cannot be
cloistered; he has no house, no shrine, where one can repair, and
abide for a time, and come away, and perhaps leave religion behind
in a place of its own. He is in the desert air; and the desert
dweller, girt with that immensity, wherever his eye falls can
commune with him; five times daily he bows down in prayer to him
and has the intimate sense of his being; he does not think about
himâhe believes.

The desert cradles, nurses, deepens, colors, and confirms this
belief. It is a land of monotony, full of solitude and silence. The
impression it thus made upon me was profound, and amounted to an
annihilation of the past. The freshness of the wilderness, as the
discoverer feels it, lay there; it abolished what was left behind;
the Old World had rolled down the other side of the mountains. Life
in its turmoil and news, its physical clamor and mental clatter,
life the distraction, had ceased. It was not that silence had
fallen upon it; but the soul had gone out from it and returned to
the silence of nature. There is no speech in that rosy ring of
mountain walls, in the implacable gold of the sands undulating away
to the blue ends of earth, in the immutable sky; they simply are.
In the passage of the winds there is stillness. It is not that
there are no sounds. The hush is of the soul. Monotonous? Yes. That
is its charm. Monotony belongs to the simple soul; and what is
monotone to the eyes of the desert dweller is monotone in the ideas
and emotions of his psychology. Repetition belongs to Islam; its
words and rites, its music and dances are stereotyped, something
completely intelligible, identically recurrent, like tales that
please childrenâthe same stories in the same words. Prayer and
posture, formula and rhythm, endlessly renewing the same idea and
the same sensationâthey imprint, they intensify; desert moulds,
they help the soul to retain its conscious form. The larger mind
that discriminates, analyzes, and explores, may tire of this; but
it also finds in such a solitude, full of silence and monotony, a
place where the soul collects itself, integrates, and has more
profoundly the sense of its own being.

The desert is not only the generator and fosterer of the desert
soul in its spiritual attitude, its practices and processes, by the
larger and universal elements in the environment, but in more
detailed ways it provides the atmosphere of life. It is strangely
sympathetic with the dweller upon its sands. He is a nomad; and the
desert is itself nomadic. The landscape is a shifting world. The
dunes travel. The scene dissolves and rebuilds. The sand-hills lift
a sculptured mountain edge upon the blue, swells like the bosom of
a wave, precipices and hollows like mountain defiles, outlooks, and
hiding-places in the valleys, and the surface shall be finely
mottled and delicately printed and patterned with lace-work as far
as the eye can see. The wind erases it in a night, hollows the
hills and fills the hollows; it is gone. The oases disappear; they
are like islands sinking in the sea of driving sands; you see their
half-sunken trees like ruins buried beneath the wave, still visible
in the depths. The face of the land is ephemeral; to leave the
route is to be lost. And after the wind, the light begins its play.
The lakes of salt and saltpetre, the lifeless lands, the
irremediable wasteâruins of some more ancient and primordial
desolation, the region cursed before its time with planetary
deathâchange, glitter, disclose placid reaches of palm-fringed
water, island-paradises, mirage beyond mirage in the far-reaching
enchantment, strips of fertility like lagoons on the mineral mud as
when one sees a valley-land through clouds. The heat gives
witchcraft to the air; size and distance are transformed; what is
small seems gigantic, what is far seems beside you; a flock of
goats is a cavalcade, a bush is a strange monster. To the nomad in
those moving sands, in that air of illusion and vision, in those
imprecise horizons, the solid earth might seem the stuff that
dreams are made on. The desert is a paradox; immutable, it presents
the spectacle of continuous change.

Nowhere is the transitory so suggested, set forth, and embodied.
Here is the complete type of human existence, permeated with
impermanence, the illusory, and oblivion, yet immutable; the
generations are erased, but humanity abides with the same general
aspects. The land is a type, too, of the desert pastâits tribes
globing into hosts and dispersed, its dynasties that crumble and
leave not a ruin behind, its inconsecutiveness in history, wars
like sand-storms, peace without fruition. It is on this life, and
issuing from its mortal senses, that there falls the impalpable
melancholy and intimate sadness of the desert. The formlessness of
the vague envelops all there; it is the path of the unfinished, the
illimitable; it is the bosom of the infinite where life is a
momentary foam. Mystery is continuous there, a perpetual presence.
Its human counterpart, its image in the soul, is
la rÃªve
,
the dream, reverie, as changeful, as illusory, that takes no root,
fades, and vanishes. It is not a merely contemplative sadness; it
is a physical melancholy. The oases are full of fever, of the
incredible languors of the heatâbreath is a weight upon the lungs,
blood is weariness in the veins, life is an oppression and an
exhaustion. It revives, but it remembers. There is a swift
spring-time of life, a resilience, a jet, of the eternal force, and
age comes like night with a stride. Death is the striking of the
tent. It is quickly over. You shall see four men passing rapidly
with the bier, a wide frame on which the body lies, wrapped in
white; in the barren place of the dead they dig with haste a
shallow hollow in the sand; they stand a moment in the last prayer;
they have covered the grave swiftly and stuck three palm twigs in
the loose sand, and are gone. A change of day and night, of winter
and summer, of birth and death, and at the centre the wind-blown
desert and the frail nomad tent; and then, three palm twigs in the
nameless sand.

The desert gives new values to life. It is a rejuvenation of the
senses, a perpetual renaissance. The fewness of objects and their
isolation on the great scene increase their worth to the eye, and
in the simple life all trifles gain in meaning through receiving
more attention; the pure and bracing air invigorates the whole body
in all its functions, and the light is, in particular, a stimulant
to the eye. The intensification of the pleasures of the senses is
due also to the austerities and hardships of life in the waste and
the change from suffering to ease. To the nomad, after the rigors
of the sands, heat and thirst and glare, all vegetation has the
freshness of spring-time; the oasis, welcoming his eyes, is, in
truth, an opening paradise. The toiling caravan, the French column,
know what it means. The long, black-green lines of the oasis over
the sands is like the breaking of light in the east; the sound of
running water is a music that reverberates in all their nerves;
fruits hanging in cool shadows, flowers, grovesâit is
la
vie
, the great miracle, again dreaming the beautiful dream in
the void. After the hamada, the desert route, it is paradise. It is
impossible to conceive of the sensual intensity of this delight, of
its merely bodily effervescence. The Arabs are a sensual race, and
the desert has double charged their joys with health and hardship;
their poverty of thought is partly recompensed by fulness of
sensation. The oases are not gardens in the European sense; they
are rude and arid groves and orchards and fields, with a roughness
of untamed nature in the aspect of the soil; and the desert
everywhere is savage in look, with the uncared-for reality, the
nakedness, and the wild glory of primeval things. Yet I have never
known habitually such delicacy and poignancy of sensation. The wind
does not merely blow, it caresses; the landscape does not smile, it
mirrors and gives back delight; odors and flavors are penetrating;
warmth and moisture bathe and cool; there is something intimate in
the touch of life. There is a universal caress in nature, a drawing
nearâsomething soothing, lulling, cadencedâfelt in the blood and
along the nerves, a
voluptÃ©
diffused and physical; for there
is a flower of the senses, as there is a flower of the mind, as
refined in its exhalation, in the peace of vague horizons, in
wafted fragrances of the night, in luminosities of the atmosphere,
in floating vapors of morning, in the dry bed of the oued under the
moon, in the pomegranate blossom, in the plume of the date-palm
flower, in all evanescence, the companionship of some little thing
of charm, the passing of a singing voice. The desert is rich in
those mysteries of sensation that remain in their own realm of
touch and eye and ear, reverie and dream. It is a garden of the
senses; and the wild flavor of the garden gives a strange poignancy
to its delights.

This sensuality prolongs its life in the higher faculties; it
penetrates and impregnates the mental consciousness; memory and
imagination are strongly physical; the soul-life itself is deeply
sensuous. It is, in this primitive psychology, as if one should see
the coral insects building up beneath the wave the reef that should
emerge on a clear-skied world. The desert music reveals this most
clearly. Sensation, as has been often said, enters into the arts in
varying degrees. Literature is the most disembodied of the arts;
its images are most purely mental and free from physical
incarnation; then, in order, painting, sculpture, music include
greater actuality of sensation by virtue of which Ã¦sthetic
pleasure, as it arises from them, is more deeply drenched in
physical reality. The senses are preliminary to the intellect; that
is why the arts precede the sciences in human evolution. The desert
dweller has no sciences, and his only art is music, which itself is
in a primitive stage, being still characteristically joined with
the dance in its original prehistoric union. The Arabs sit, banked
on their benches, apathetic, gazing, listening, while the
monotonous rhythm of the dance and the instruments rises, sways,
and terminates, and begins again interminably. What is their state?
It is an obsession, more or less profound, of memory and
imagination, retrospective or prospective experience, felt with
physical vagueness, defined, vivified, and made momentarily present
by the swaying dancer in the emotional nimbus of the music. It is
the audience at only one remove from participation in the dance,
contemplative but still physically reminiscent of it. The dances
are of two general types: that of the negroes, a physical hysteria,
full of violent gesture, leaping, and loud cries, the barbaric
paroxysm; the other that of Arab origin, a voluptuous cadencing to
a monotonously responsive accompaniment. The desert dweller is a
realist; his emotions, his desires have not transcended the facts
of life; his poetry, so far as it exists, and there is a
considerable amount of it, is one of simple and positive images.
Mysticism, in the intellectual sense, the transformation of the
senses into the spirit, does not exist for him; not nearer than
Persia is the mystic path which leads to the ecstasy of the soulâs
union with the divine, of the Bride with the Bridegroom; the desert
knows nothing of that Aryan dream. Sensation remains here in its
own realm; and its summary artistic form is music, itself so
physically penetrating in its method and appeal. The music of the
desert is to me very attractive; it engages me with its simple and
direct cling; snatches of carolled song, the humble notes of its
flutes, the insistence of its instruments fascinate and excite me.
It is the music of the senses.

The sensuality of the Arabs also found other climaxes, in love
and war. It is the intensity of their passion and of their fighting
which has charged their history, as a race, with its greatest
brilliancy; and at their points of highest achievement a luxurious
temperament has characterized them, which has made an Arabian dream
the synonym for all strange and soft delights. The desert in its
degree has this
mollesse
, physical languors, exhaustion; but
its home is in the oasis-villages. The true nomad contemns the
oasis-dwellers as a softened, debilitated, and corrupt race; the
life of the nomad is purer, hardier, manlier; he is the master; the
oasis pays him tribute. The life of the senses, however, in either
form, passes away; vitality ebbs the more swiftly because of its
rapid and intense play; pallor falls on the sensations, they fade,
and joy is gone. Melancholy from its deepest source supervenes; in
the desertâage in its abandonment, decay, and poverty; in the
oasisâlife somnolent, effeminate, drugged. The wheel comes full
circle in the end for all. Meanwhile the vision of life is whole,
and goes ever on. Youth is always there in its beauty and
freshness. There is always love and fighting. Nature does not lose
her universal caress. The desert soul still adores the only God in
his singleness. There is great freedom. The route calls. It is
human life, brave, picturesque, mysteriousâbeset by the sands, but
before it always the infinite.

Yet, fascinated though I was, I was aware of some detachment.
Sweet was the renaissance of the sensesâwhat brilliancy and joy in
their playâmerely to look, to breathe, to be! To have come into one
of the titanic solitudes of nature, comparable only to ocean wastes
and amplitudes of the sky, and to dwell there, far from the
mechanic chaos, the unbridled egotism, the competitive dinâwhat a
recovery of the soul was there, of human dignity, of true being!
and to find there a race still in a primitive simplicity,
unburdened by thought, not at warfare with its mortal nature, the
two poles of the spirit and the body married in one sphereâand to
feel the rude shepherding of nature round their nomad lives, inured
to hardship, but swiftly responsive with almost animal vitality to
her rare kindlier moods and touchesâit was a discovery of the early
world, of ancestral, primeval ways. It was a refreshment, a
disburdenment, an enfranchisement; and it was a holiday delight.
Yet over these simplicities, austerities, and wild flavors there
still hung a moral distance, something Theocritean, the mood of the
city-dweller before pastoral charm. To sit in the cafÃ© in the
throng of Arabs with the coffee and the dance, to muse and dream on
the mat alone, to lie apart in the garden and be contentâit was a
real participation; but in the background behind, in the shadow of
my heart, was the old European though eluded. This life had the
quality of escapadeâto see things lying crumbled and fallen with
none to care, to be free of the eternal salvage of dead shells of
life and thoughtâa world so little encumbered with the heritage of
civilization! How many years had I spent, as it were, in a museum
of things artificially preserved in books, like jarsâin the
laboratory of the intellectual charnel-house! The scholar,
accumulating the endless history of human error, has no time to
serve truth by advancing it in his own age; he lives so much with
what was that he cannot himself be; his inheritance eats him up.
The crown of Western culture is apt to be an encyclopÃ¦dia. There
was no library in the desert. And religionâhow much of it comes to
us moderns in a dead form! Surely religion is a revelation

of
the soul, not
to
it. This is a doctrine of
immanence. If the divine be not immanent in the soul, man can have
no knowledge of it. Religion is an aura of the soul, a
materialization of spiritual consciousness, varying in intensity of
light and tones of color from race to race, from age to age, and,
indeed, from man to man; it is the soulâs consciousness made
visible. It is not to me interesting as scientific truth is, a
thing of worth in the realm of the abstract, but rather as artistic
truth is, a vital expression, something lived. What a reality it
had here in the desert soulâits effluence, almost its substance,
giving back the spiritual image of nature in humanity, a
condensation of the vast spaces, the vague horizons, the monotony,
the mortal burden, in a prayer! It is a new baptism into nature, if
not unto God, only to see this aura of the soul in the desert. The
scene in all its phasesâlandscape and menâwas to me an evocation of
the long ago. But the soul does not return upon its track. The
simple life is only for the simple soul. The soul of the old
European is not simple. Yet if the leopard could change his spots,
if one could lay off the burden of thought, lay staff and scrip
aside, and end the eternal quest, nowhere else could he better make
the great refusal and set up an abiding-place as in this nomad
world. Its last word is resignation; peace is its last desire.

The desert world is a dying world. That is the sadly shadowing,
slowly mounting, fatally overwhelming impression that grows on the
mind and fills it. Death is the aspect of the scene; sterility,
blankness, indifference to life. Inhospitality is its universal
trait and feature. It is as hostile to animal and vegetable as to
human lifeâits skeleton lakes without fishes, its drifting valleys
without birds, its steppes without roving herds. Its oases are
provisioned with water and bastioned with ramparts against the
eternal siege of the sands; to preserve them is like holding
Holland against the sea. The mere presence of man, tooâwhat is
humanâshares in this aspect of death. I have mentioned the
cemeteries, mere plots of extinction, anonymous, without dates,
leaving nothing of degradation to be added to the sense of
hopelessness, futility, and oblivion. The dwelling-places of the
living are hardly more raised above the soil or distinguishable
from the earth they crumble intoâtypically seen in those ksour of
the south, cracked, with gap and rift, dissolving in ageless decay
and abandonment, mere heaps over the underground darkness of
passages and cellsâor here embosomed in a great silence, full of
solitude and secrecy, the life of the palm garden, of the great
heats, of the frigid nights; always and everywhere with the sense
of an immense desolation, denudation, and deprivation. The life of
the tent is one of sunshine and vitality by comparison; humble and
rugged, it has no decadence in its look; in the villages the
decadence seems almost of the soil itself. One goes out into the
desert to escape the oppression of this universal mortal decay; and
there is no life there, only a passage of life, of which the
skeleton of the camel in the sands is the epitaph.

A dying world and a race submissive to its fate. In that nomad
world, where everything is passing away, there is nothing fixed but
the will of Allah. It is not strange to find fatality the last word
of Islam. In the desert world the will of nature appears with
extreme nakedness; the fortune of man is brief, scant, and
unstable; the struggle is against infinite odds, a meagre
subsistence is gained, if at all; and the blow of adversity is
sudden and decisive. Patience everywhere is the virtue of the poor,
resignation the best philosophy of the unfortunate, and defeat, as
well as victory, and perhaps more often, brings peace. These are
great words of Islam, and nowhere have they sunk deeper into life
than in the desert-soul. They are all forms of that fatality which
the desert seems almost to embody in nature, to exercise in the
lives of its children, and to implant in their bosoms as the
fundamental fact of being. Fatality is in the outer aspect of
things and exhales from the inward course of life; melancholy,
impotence, immobility accumulate with the passage of years;
effortless waiting, indolence, prayer, contemplationâthese are the
shadows in which is the end. This mood of the despair of life has
nowhere more lulling cadences of death. The desert is a magnificent
setting for the sceneâits strong coloring, its vast expanses, its
unfathomable silences; its desolate grandeurs, its sublime
austerities, its wild gloryâgodlike indifference to mankind; its
salt chotts, immense as river valleys, tufts of the sand-sunken
palmsâpremonitions of the disappearance of life from the earth, the
final extinction of that vital spark which was the wildfire of the
planet, the thin frost work on the flaking rock, the little
momentary breath of love and war and prayer. Here life takes on its
true proportions at the endâall life; it is an incident, a little
thing in the great scene. A dying world, a dying race, a dying
civilization, truly; but the old European, the wise pessimist in
the shadow, has seen much death; to him it is but another notch on
the stick. To me, personally near to it and fascinated in my senses
still, it is
trÃ¨s humain
, exciting, engaging; and the
melancholy that penetrates it ever more deeply and mysteriously
does not interfere with its charm, its blend of delicacy and
hardiness, of spirit and sense, of freedom and fate. I have a touch
of the heart of the desert-born. âIf love of country should perish
from the earth,â said my soldier-poet, âit would be found again in
the heart of the Bedouin.â No race is more attached to the soil, or
so consumed with home-sickness for it. The Bedouin loves the
desert.

A strange
thing to me was the absence of
any political state. There has never been a political state,
properly speaking, in the desert. Such was the parcelling of the
communities, so elementary the governmental form, so feeble the
impulse of political aggregation and cohesion, that the general
condition might seem to be an anarchy. In the Kabyle villages of
the mountains and among the Mzabites of the Sahara the assemblies
of the elders with the election and change of head men present an
aspect of such primitive simplicity and independence that they
might be thought freemenâs institutions of an ideal purity; on the
other hand, the absence of any political centres of concentration
forbade the formation of a nation. The recognition of the tribal
blood-tie conserved groups, smaller or larger, with a greater or
less sense of unity; but feud was the natural condition of these
units, extending to the smallest and even into families, and in the
larger world political history found only hordes hastily massing
for temporary ends and dissolving in a night, or empires of facile
conquest and loose tributary bonds, of the nature of a primacy
rather than a sovereignty, and without long continuity of life.
Public order, with its correlatives, security and peace, was little
realized, and, however ideal local institutions might seem within
the group, it was, viewed largely, a barbaric world.

A very pure democracy in its primitive form prevailed. All men
were equal before Allah, and the condition of equality generally
obtained also between man and man. Inequality belongs to
civilization; the absence of that, and especially the lack of
security for wealth and its inheritance, of an official class of
state functionaries and a clerical hierarchy, and pre-eminently the
lack of knowledge, removed main sources of that differentiation
which has stratified modern society. There was a noblesse of the
sword and also of religion, grounded originally on descent from
Mohammed or more generally and powerfully here in the West from
some Marabout, but neither class was really separated from the
people. The only effective source of inequality was

virtÃ¹
âreal ability. Tradition made it the glory of the Arab
noble to dissipate his patrimony in gifts to his friends and to
rely on the booty of his own hand for himself. Ignorance, besides,
is a great leveller, and poverty is the best friend of fraternity;
liberty was native to the soil. It was a society where all men had
substantially the same ideas, customs, and desires, thought and
acted, lived, in the same way. It was a natural democracy, and
inbred; and to-day this trait is one of the most striking and
refreshing that a sojourn among its people brings to notice, for it
is a real democracy, unconscious of itself, vital, and admirable in
its human results.

Race-consciousness found historic expression only in the
religious field. The spots where the faith first began on the soil,
the tombs of great leaders in the conquest, such as that of Sidi
Okba in the oasis not far away, the white domes of the Marabouts
sown like village spires through all this land, were places of
sacred memory, centres of race-consciousness, and here took the
function of integrating the common soul of the race, as, in other
civilizations, political memorials of great public events and
famous men develop national consciousness. In the desert patriotism
and faith are one emotion. The ideal Mohammedan state is a pure
theocracy in which the political and spiritual powers are one and
inseparable; where this condition prevails is the
dar el
Islam
, the land of Islam, the soil of the true faith;
elsewhere, wherever the union is imperfect or the faith must
concede to the infidel, is the
dar el harb
, or, as we should
say, missionary countries. Neither Turkey nor Egypt is
dar el
Islam
; its narrow, though still vast, realm is the Libyan
sands, where it still refuges its people. It is an arresting sight
when religion goes into the desert to be with God; the Pilgrims of
the
Mayflowerâs
wake, the Mormons of the sunflower trail
fill the imagination with their willingness to give up all, to go
forth and plant a new state sacred to their idea. It is always an
heroic act. Such a coming out from among the world, such a going
forth into the inhospitable waste has been characteristic of desert
history. Solitude is the natural home of orthodoxy, of the fanatic
sect and the purist. Mohammedanism in its primary stage was a
particular religion of a desert people; in its secondary stage, as
a conquering faith, it had to develop its capacity for
internationalism, its powers of adaptation to other breeds and of
absorption of foreign moods and sentiments, its fitness to become a
world religion; in itself also there was necessarily the play of
human nature involving, as time went on, a variation into sects,
heresies, innovations; thus, for example, it absorbed mysticism
from the extreme East and whitened the West with the worship of
saints. The faith was purer and more rigid in the desert, generally
speaking, and was there more primitively marked; there it was
safest from contaminating contacts; and there also Western
civilization, closing round and penetrating its realm, finds the
most fanatic and obdurate resistance.

Race-resistance to the invasion of the modern world, naturally
following the lines of race-consciousness, notwithstanding the aid
it received in the beginning of the struggle from the old feudality
of the desert, had its stronghold in religion and its organization;
and, specifically, it found its practical rallying-points and
strongest alignment in the confraternities, or secret orders, with
their zaouias, analogous to mediÃ¦val abbeys and monasteries, which
had so great a development in North Africa in the last centuryâsome
more enlightened in leadership and capable of assimilating Western
benefits in some degree, others stupidly impervious to the new
influences and events. These brotherhoods, whose nomadic agents
under the guise of every humble employment course the land with
great thoroughness, are ideal organizations for agitation,
collecting and disseminating news, preparing insurrection,
fomenting and perpetuating discontent and secret hope; it is they
and their machinations that are back of the Holy War, as a race
idea. They are all hearths of the faith; but some, such as the
Tidjaniya, recognizing both the fact of French power and the
reality of the benefits it confers, are committed to political
submission and peace; others are less placable, and nurse eternal
hate of the infidel, with a credulous hope of expelling him from
the land; and one, the most irreconcilable and the most powerful,
is an active foe. This fraternity is the Snoussiya, having its seat
at Djarbout, in the Libyan desert, where it has constituted a
veritable empire of the sands, a pure Mohammedan state; it has
divided with the neighboring empire of the Mahdi, and with that of
the Sultan of Morocco, the proud title of
dar el Islam
. Sidi
Snoussi, the founder, was a humble
taleb
of Medjaher, in the
province of Oran. He preached the exodus, and led the recalcitrant
and irreconcilable into the Cyrenaica, and there by virtue of his
natural ability and enterprise built up a state, to which his sons
have succeeded, the eldest of them having been already designated
by his father as the promised Mahdi, the always expected Messiah of
Islam, who should restore its power as the true kingdom of God on
earth. It is this state which is the centre of Panislamism, the
hope of a reunion of the entire Mohammedan world after the fall of
the Sultan at Constantinople should be accomplished. The desert
round about owns its sovereignty from Egypt to Tunis, and it is
buttressed on the south by the negro states which it has joined in
proselytizing, converting them from their savage fetichism.

The spirit of proselytism has always been active in North
Africa. The story of its saints from early days contains a
missionary element, acting at first on the indigenous barbarism of
the desert and mountains and extending at a later period to the
negro populations of the Soudan. The Snoussiya, together with other
Mohammedan agents, has conducted a proselytism to the south which
has been astonishing in its success and has long arrested European
attention. Islam is, indeed, well adapted to convert inferior
peoples, and adopts an intelligent policy in practice. The
simplicity of the faith, the absence of any elaborate dogma or
ritual, its slight demand on the intellect, together with its
avoidance of anything ascetic in its rule of life, made it easily
acceptable in itself; and its tolerant advance, without pressure,
on the imitative instincts, the ambitions and interests of the
savage populations with which it is in political and commercial
contact, secures its spread without irritation or disturbance. It
is the warrior race of the FoulbÃ©s in the Soudan who have most
carried forward this movement of mingled spiritual, political, and
commercial conquest; beside these, like the Jew by the Arab, are
the Haoussas, a black race, with a commercial instinct, who
established themselves under the protection of the FoulbÃ©s; they,
generally speaking, have the monopoly of instruction and are the
simple teachers of the region; the fetichistic tribes, coming under
the influence of these Moslem expansionists by conquest,
protectorate, marriage, in one and another way of the old and
universal methods of the transformation of a lower race by a
higher, are thus added to the domain of Islam. So important is this
religious change, and so striking is the event, that some Catholic
bishops have seen in it a providential preparation by an
intermediate state for a future evangelization. What is noteworthy
is the active spread of Mohammedanism contemporaneously in Central
Africa and its close connection with the power of the Snoussiya,
the most energetic and fanatic centre of Islam. The dream of the
poor preacher of Oran has come partly true: in leading the
irreconcilable into the Libyan desert and building a refuge for
them in the most desolate wastes of the eastern Sahara, in the

dar el Islam
, he established a new centre for the faith in a
region backed by populations where its natural spread is great and
its presence is likely to be long continued, and he aroused through
all the Mohammedan world the spirit of Panislamism. It is in his
work and the fruit of it that race-resistance to the impact of the
modern world on the old life of the desert all along the African
coasts of the Sahara finds its climax, its centre, and its hope;
elsewhere it has ebbed slowly away.

That retreat of the old faith into the desert out of whose
immensity it was born, to die if need were in its own cradling
sands, far from the pollutions of the modern and changed world,
excites the imagination and commands admiration. It might be the
episode of an epic, with its
mise en scÃ¨ne
, its protagonist,
its atmosphere of travel and assemblage, and the coloration of its
auxiliary tribes. It has classical poetic quality. But to the
meditative mind the fortunes of the
dar el harb
, the nearer
land of the infidel, is more profoundly impressive. It is a curious
feeling that comes over one at the thought that he is present at
the death of a race and has before his eyes the passing away of a
civilization, and that civilization a culture in its essential
features once common to the human family. That is the scene
hereâthe passing of the early world. It is like the passing of the
Indian world of the wilderness from America that our fathers saw,
only in a more concentrated scene and on a more impressive
scaleâthe death of an ancient mode of life in its home of
centuries, full of memory going back to the dawn of history. It is
a solemn thing for the reflective mind to witness, hard to realize
adequately. Agriculture is gaining on the pastoral state,
supplanting it; the nomad is slowly becoming fixed to the soil; the
towns increase in number and population and in the variety of their
life; peace, order, security establish themselves; capital, science
arriveâcompanies, railways, telegraphs, communication, and
transportationâand the face of life is changed; in a few years
there will be no more caravans to Tougourt, to Tripoli, to
GhadamÃ¨sâthey will be legends like the mule-trains and
prairie-schooners of the old emigrant West.

The economic change is most obvious, the inrush of the
mechanical and cosmopolitan, colonization and exploitation, public
works and private enterprise, securing and furnishing the territory
for a commercial tillage and use. Is it a dispossession of the
native from the soil or is it a means by which he may more justly
enjoy it? The people, in the old days, lived in a sort of serfage
to the nomads or the zaouias. The French rÃ©gime put an end to
desert feudality, but treated the zaouias with more consideration,
owing to their religious character. The zaouias of Algeria,
notwithstanding some counter-currents among them, generally
accepted French rule and co-operated with it. The result,
nevertheless, was largely a lessening of the economic lordship of
the religious families at the head of these establishments and an
enfranchisement of the people from dependence upon them. The
zaouias were sources of great communal benefit; they practised
especially the Moslem virtues of alms-giving and hospitality; but
they also took tithes and offerings. Their social importance has
diminished; and, in place of the old half-patriarchal, half-feudal
system, society takes on the modern structure of economic
individualism. The impersonal administrative system, dealing with
all in an individual way, shivered the primitive economic
collectivity of society at a stroke. The modern world has come;
capital, wages, earnings bring new arrangements and ways of living;
the economic career in a commercial world is open and safe, wealth
is its prize, competence is possible for those who can maintain
themselves in the way; the new dispensationâthe future, has begun.
Life is more free, more just, fuller of opportunity, and it is also
more difficult; new desires, new temptations, and new needs arise;
the cost is greater. Civilization enforces the higher standard of
living even on the lowliest. This is the material fact most
powerful in transformation. It is a fact inherent in progress.

The change in manners is the superficial expression of economic
changes. There is an ingathering into the towns, and, as always, in
the first contacts of a comparatively primitive race with a
luxurious civilization the corruption of manners and morals is
patent; the weakening of the old fibre of life before the new fibre
has time to form occasions a moral displacement. This is most
noticeable in the cities of the coast, but in some degree is
everywhere to be seen. There is, as it were, a sifting of classes;
the more advanced, those who are most sensitive to the new and most
free and bold, begin an exodus from the
cafÃ© Maure
to the
European restaurant; they imitate the foreigner, ape his ways and
take the mould of his habits; the French
vie
tends to
establish itself as the ideal, to a greater or less degree, among
the forward spirits and the young; old haunts and customs are left
with the lower class in the
cafÃ© Maure
. The chief support of
the general change, broadly speaking, is the instruction in French
schools throughout the provinces, which reduces the old language to
a country dialect and secures a certain glamour for the new rÃ©gime
and naturalizes it as a
patrie
familiar from childhood,
protective, and opening the ways of life. A vital point is the
extent to which, in this change of manners and ideals religion, the
faith, is affected. It appears to be conceded that the practice of
the faith formally is weakened. It is a faith in which the rite
counts heavily; the doing of certain acts, as a matter of
observance, is a large part of its reality; but a default in the
practice of religion is never a sure index to a decline in belief.
Belief habitually outlives practice. It is certain that no
Christianizing takes place. The White Brothers, the Catholic
missionaries of the Sahara, have long confined their efforts to
works of humanity and simple helpfulness, abandoning attempts at
conversion. If the religion of Islam grows feebler in its hold, it
means that free thought, scepticism, and indifference come in its
place. Perhaps the fundamental fact is that the larger sphere which
existed for religion in the old days no longer exists. The hermit
is a holy man largely because he has nothing else to do except to
be holy; and religion fills the world of Islam partly, at least,
because of the absence of other elements in that primitive
monotonous life. The modern world has brought with it into the
desert a great variety of novel interests, a diversified life,
stimulating curiosity and attention and often absorbing practical
participation in the new movement on the part of the people in
trade, enterprise, amusement, information, news. It appears to be
agreed that in the parts of longest occupancy by the French there
has been a relaxation of religious practice and a softening of
fanatic hatred, concurrently with a corruption of morals and
degeneracy of racial vigor where European contact has been most
close.

The final question is of the issue. The population has greatly
increased under French rule. The development of the country in a
material way goes on apace. The colonial empire of France in Africa
has a great commercial future. Will the native people in this new
economic civilization be able to hold fast and secure for its own
at least a share of the products of this great movement, or will
they be merely a servile race in the service of French proprietors
and over-lords, or in a condition of economic serfage to vast
accumulations of capital, analogous to that of industrial workers
in our capitalistic society? Will the moral decay, incident to the
change of civilizations, eat them up and destroy them, as has been
the luck of half-barbaric peoples elsewhere in their contact with
the modern world? In a word, is the Berber people, for that race is
here the general stock and stamina, capable of assimilating this
civilization and profiting by it? These are questions of a far
future. Meanwhile the best opinion is sharply divided upon them.
Historically, the Berber race has shown assimilative power racially
by its absorption of the foreign bloods that have crossed it from
the earliest days: the northern barbarians, the Arabs of the great
invasion, the negroes of the south have all mingled with it freely;
it has also shown power to take the impress of foreign institutions
from Roman and Christian days to the time of its Islamization. Its
resistant power, its vitality as a race, is scarcely less
noticeable. There are some who look to see real assimilation, even
to the extent of a miscegenation of the various strains of foreign
blood; there are others who expect at most only a hegemony of
civilization over a permanently inferior people; and there are
still others who hope for a true assimilation of material
civilization, with its blessings of science and order, but see an
impassable abyss between the old European and the soul of the
desert, inscrutable, mysterious, alien, which remains immutable in
the Berber race.

The
old life of the desert is passing
away; the fact is written on the landscape, on the faces of the
people and in their hearts. It was as full of miseries as of
grandeurs; and its disappearance is for good. What was admirable in
it was the endurance of the human heart in the sterile places, and
the mysterious flowering from it, amid this desolation, of a great
faith. The death of a religion, no more than the decay of other
institutions, should perplex or disturb; all these alike are the
work of the soul, and when the soul leaves them they perish; and as
in the revolutions the daily life of men goes on, so in the
religious changes of organization and dogma the spiritual life of
the soul continues. The soul can no more be without religion than
the body without life. The sense of the mystery of its own being
abides in the soul, in however half-conscious or imperfect forms,
implanted in its vital and animating principle, and shares with
shaping power in its thoughts, emotions, and will, and exhales the
atmosphere in which it realizes its spiritual life; it is here that
religion, in the external sense of worship and dogma, has its
source. The desert soul may cast the old life like a garmentâfaith
and all; but under these old skies and in these supreme horizons it
cannot change its nature, which is, in a sense, the human form of
the desert. The flower of faith will grow here, and blossom in the
wild, in the future as in the past, for the desert is a spiritual
place; and in this austere and infinite air faith will continue to
be a religion of the desert truly, with the least of the corporeal
in its manifestation and idea, with the least of the defined in
creed and localized in place; for the spiritual, the universal, the
vague are the intuitions and language of the desert; there religion
is less a thought than a feeling, less a prayer than a mood.

I closed my meditations in such thoughts as these, instinctively
seeking, amid so much that was mortal, the undying, in the decadent
the permanent, in the transitory the eternal.

The
stars were coming out in the sky;
the coolness of the night was already in the air. The old Arab had
long ago departed; the kif-smoking youth were gone. I was alone
under the vine trellis, with the dark lines of the palm grove
before me in the falling night. The proprietor, a mild-faced and
gentle-mannered old Arab, came, as I rose to go, with a few
pleasant words, and gave me a small branch of orange-flowers and a
spray of the white flower of the palm. â
Câest le mÃ¢le
,â he
said with a smile. And as I rode home over the silent desert, and,
crossing the bed of the oued, looked back on the mountain wall and
swept with my gaze the great, dark waste under the stars, I found
myself repeating his wordsââ
Câest le mÃ¢le
.â

IT was a coast-line hardly raised above the
sea. On that low horizon only a few rare palms silhouetted the far
verge above the surf. The pale-blue flood of the sea, lifting
measurelessly on and on in the shining levels of fair weather; the
thin, white, uneasy line wrinkling down the league-long spits of
sand; the slender jets of the tufted palms etching the vacant azure
vagueâthere was nothing more, hour after hour. And âin the
afternoon we came unto a landââbut that would be to anticipate. As
a matter of fact, we did not come to any land at all. We hove to,
some three or four miles out in the offing, and a few weather-wise
boats bobbed about like corks on the rollers, with many a careening
sweep hither and thither. I climbed down into one of them, and when
I had recovered my balance found myself and my luggage in the
possession of a Berber boatman and his âsailor-ladâ; but this was
an entirely new edition of the sailor lad, bound in an earth-brown
burnooseâan earnest-faced small boy, with an unfathomable
seriousness, and devout in every motion, like a young acolyte, a
fresh and unique incarnation of Cupid in bonds, naÃ¯ve, with a sweet
smile, eyes
trÃ¨s douce
, and such a mastery of his tasks in
years still short of the glorious teens! What a hand he had for a
rope! and how he got about with his clothes! The other was a
life-worn man,
trÃ¨s triste
in the face and in motion. Father
and son, and of the old race of the sea they were, a strange new
type, and with I know not what added of life sadness, of dour
reality.

We were soon under way, a leaning boat on broad-bosomed waters,
and with that palm-set orange strip of sky to lead us on. I had not
enjoyed for years such a glorious sail. Under a crisp west wind we
rode the ridged waves with spurts of spray; the sun was sinking in
the splendid reach and magnificent arch of that world of the void;
and we drove through the purple-black sea furrows shot with dying
lights. The steamer was already melting with the horizon behind. I
seemed to have dropped out of the world, as if I had been marooned.
I was free of it; it had all lapsed away; it had gone down. The
stretch of the sea was immense. The bracing wind was as heady as
wine. âFresh fields and pastures new,â I bethought myself, looking
to the low rim of land that hardly divided sea from sky, and
wondered if I should find fields of the yellow lotus there. That
margin was still distant, and I lay back in the stern half
dreaming, enjoying the wet tingle of the spray on my face, as we
made landward by long tacks, and the worn old man and the demure
boy with their eyes on wind and wave sat silent. The boat grated
against the pier. After a short walk I was in a small hotel, with a
few rooms round an inner court, a veranda overlooking it from
above, climbing roses, a pleasant French hostess, and no other
guests.

It was the isle of Djerba. I had been drawn here because
tradition places on the island the home of the lotus-eaters, of
whom Ulysses long ago told a sea tale. This voyage was to be a
hunting of the lotus. I have had an appetite for it since boyhood.
It is my predestined food; but destiny has a remarkable way of
escaping me. I have observed the fact on several occasions. No
âbranches of that enchanted stemâ had met me on the pier, nor was
there any âmild-eyed, melancholyâ person about, whom the most
fatuous could ever mistake for a strayed reveller. Things often
turn out in an unexpected way; but I had to admit there was an
uncommon disparity between my youthful vision of the lotus land and
what I saw. Where were the âthree mountain-peaks,â and the slender,
high cascades of âdownward smoke,â and the âgleaming river,â to say
nothing of its Eden background? There was not a mountain anywhere
in sight, not a hill, not a rise of ground. âA land of
streamsââthere was not a brook, let alone a river, not a single
stream of any sort on the whole island, which had the appearance of
a flat mainland. From the housetop I looked on an Arab town of no
great extent, with a French core, scantily embowered with
straggling trees, and the view was unbroken, landward or seaward,
the horizon round. I suspect I shall find that mistily draped
Tennysonian valley, with its long-drawn scene, in the Pyrenees some
day, near a castle in Spain. It was not here. My French hostess had
never heard of the lotus.

II

The
next morning was bright and fair,
and I went out to explore the land southward, a stretch of about
twenty kilometres to the strait which divides the island from the
mainland. We were soon out of the town and almost at once in the
fields. The road, extremely dry and sandy, wound over a very open
country of scattered farms, with lines and groups of palm and
olive, besides other trees, on slightly rolling, bosomy slopes with
long and gradual variations of level. It was a pleasant scene in
the warm April air of sleepy peace and solitary silence, unbroken
country quiet. One characteristic of the land was soon evident. The
population, which is upward of forty thousand for the whole island
and is of the pure Berber stock for the most part, has never
gathered into towns and villages. The few central points are mere
market-places for distribution and supply; the people live
scattered on farms in their own demesnes. There are singular
farmsteads, built for defence, actually fortified; a wall,
enclosing a space large enough for cattle and whatever must be
under cover in case of attack, surrounds the whole, with towers at
the four corners. These farmsteads are near enough for mutual aid;
and with only this system of protection the inhabitants of the
island withstood the random nomad forays from the mainland and the
pirate descents from the sea for centuries.

The island is really the edge of the desert where it makes down
to the Mediterranean. It is, in effect, a farming oasis which has
been reclaimed from the sands by its own people through the use of
the underground waters. It is in a condition of varied cultivation
throughout, but is more fertile in some parts than in others; for,
if attention is relaxed, it reverts at once to the sterile, sandy
state. A peculiar people inhabits it. They are dissident
Mohammedans, and akin in their heresy to the Mzabites of the
Sahara, whose
fantasia
I saw, and who have made the oases to
the west and southwest of Tougourt centres of prosperity, besides
being a vigorous nomad race of merchants through all North Africa.
The sect would be called Unitarians among us, because they carry
their insistence on âthe only Godâ so far as to deny divine
authority to the prophets, including Mohammed. They have strange
bits of mosques, diminutive little things, with a square minaret
topped with a curious conical stone, and these are numerously
scattered here over the whole island. They are also the Puritans of
the Moslem world, strict in their manners, severe even, and very
frugal. It is to this folk that the island owes its state of
culture; they have created it as a habitable tract; nor do they
confine their toil to the land. They weave excellent white
burnooses of their wool, and bright, striped blankets, and mould
pretty pottery; they engage in the fisheries; and with their nomad
instincts they often seek occupation and trade abroad, like the
Mzabites, who are credited with a Quaker-like prosperity in worldly
affairs. This community, distributed broadly without towns in their
own small domains, might seem a dream of the primitiveâa frugal
folk on a sterile land, in their rural Paradise of small economies
and simple manners, leading uneventful lives of humble industry,
far from the great world.

It was a curious country to look atânot rich, no bottom-lands,
or waving acres, or luxury and exuberance of vegetation rushing
forth; the nakedness of the land showed through. But the face of
the country had lines of verdure and spots of spring-time and
greening reaches over the dry acclivities; the mild warmth of the
sun cheered everything to its brightest; there were plotted fields
here and there, and the palms gave beauty to the sky and the olives
gave character to the earth. There were some splendid olive-trees,
old, hoary trunks, knobbed with age and contorted by ocean gales;
massive columnar stems of incredible girth that lifted from near
the ground immense rounds of heavy foliage impenetrably dark; and
others, mere shells and ruins of time, that still shot green shoots
from their tops to the bright wave of the sun. It was the scene of
an old world; and there was something ancient and venerable to my
eyes in the landscape that had seen so little change for centuries
and yet had known human life, humble generations, for so long. Far
away, beyond sloping breadths of dark, rough herbage whose sparse
bunches hummocked the dry soil, glittered a low mass of white walls
that slowly defined itself as a farmstead with orchards about; it
had a rude, mediÃ¦val look in its exterior, and many offices,
apparently, suggesting somewhat an old manor. Cattle stood round it
lazily, and a couple of men were at work in the cluttered yard. On
another ridge was one of those strange mosques, but larger and more
important than usual, perhaps the memorial of some island saint.
The blue sky shone through the window of the cupola of the minaret,
with its conical stone at the top; on one side the olive-trees
leaned away from it by twos and threes, and on the other high palms
lifted their feathery tops, inclined at different angles, tall,
slender, drooping stems with very small tufts. It was a very lonely
and peaceful sight in that silent country, stretching far around.
We met hardly any one on the road except, in the vicinity of the
rare houses, groups who evidently belonged on the place. The houses
were not the least curious feature of the landscape. They were
roofed with little domes, as is usual on the island. This gave a
certain solemnity to the sceneâthe grave aspect of the East. So we
went on in the calm, warm day, mile after mile, undulating over the
country, but with no real change of level, with glimpses of the old
farms, the sharp-pinnacled, square minarets of the solemn mosques,
the white domes, feathery palms, and rolling olives, through the
monotony of a land where there was truly a great peace.

We reached Ajim, the southernmost point of the island, in the
light of a blazing noon that bit every line of black shadow with a
brilliant edge. Ajim was only a short, tumble-down street. The
one-story buildings of sun-dried mud on either side presented a
low, blank wall, continuous and irregular, broken by a succession
of high-arched or elongated oblong openings, closed by rough
boards. I think I never saw so poor a hamlet. There was a general
look of shabby dilapidation, but this was due to the original
poverty of the materials and the humbleness of the effort. There
was no appearance of abandonment. On the contrary, there was
building going on and the street was lively. I had much difficulty
in keeping out of the way of donkeys and camels and porters, as I
walked to the upper end and looked in at the
fondouk
which
was thronged with beasts and men. It was a characteristic scene as
I turned back, for the walk was only of three or four minutes. The
little vista was dominated at the lower end by the rising
buildings, and the poor street lay below, half in the sunlight,
with its sharp band of inky shadow on the southern side. The people
were scattered from end to end, mostly in earth-brown, flowing
garments, with here and there a snowy burnoose of some more
important citizen; and there were caps and turbans of all sorts,
and a dash of faded blue or green now and then showed in the
sunshine; but the scene was sober-hued, white and black and brown
for the most part, under the dazzling blue in the fresh sea air.
The open doors of the street, as I passed along, let a dim light
into the interior gloom of what seemed places for storage,
cavernous and dark; and further on there were a few shops and
cafÃ©s, a smith, a rope-maker. There were all kinds of ropes; and it
gradually came on me that this was really a fishing village and a
place for sailormen, a port. It was a little unlike anything I had
elsewhere seen. I went through the rope-makerâs shop; such places
always call me with their savor of the sea and its tasks. I had a
good lunch at a cafÃ©; one can always get food in the most
out-of-the-way places, if he has any knack for travelling. I
remember only the cup of coffee at the end, with some of those
strange-colored liquids, exotic drinks that one finds at the ends
of the world, bright, tonic, exhilarating; and over one of these I
sat watching the little life of the street, a continual passing of
men and boys and burdens, with dialogues and incidents, and a not
infrequent disposition to take the stranger into confidence with
looks and nods and smiles of intelligence. It was a pleasant and
picturesque hour in the foreign sun, and ended happily; and I
strolled down to the pier, which lies at a little distance from the
village beyond a broad, open ground.

It was a fine pier and made out very far into the shallow
waters. The mainland lay a mile or two away and was as desert a
strand as I ever looked on, flat, bleak, uninhabited. The level
waters stretched far away on either hand, blue and shining, and a
fresh breeze sent the lively waves to chafe angrily against the
pier. The near scene was quietly interesting. Small vessels were
anchored at a little distance, and a hull seemed to be building or
undergoing repairs near the shore, where there was a group with
animals. Close to the pier leaned a tangle of slanting masts and
ropes, the Arab fleet of sponge-fishers, not so numerous as the
Greek fleet I had seen at Sfax, but similar in character and making
a pretty marine view. Not far from it an Arab was sifting grain
from a great heap by a moored vessel on the other side, and a camel
was unloading. There were several walking figures on the pier,
which was very long and narrow, and if one of them stood still he
looked, in the strict folds of his Arab dress, like a statue on a
bridge, relieved on the sky and the sea with perfectly defined
lines. There was one group, however, that centred my attentionâa
true Bedouin scene. It was a family that had come over on some sort
of a ferry from the other side. The man was unloading their
belongings from the boat and piling them up on the pier, where a
donkey was waiting to be loaded with them. On the heap sat two
women, who looked like mother and daughter. The elder arrested the
eye at once by her splendid physique and her dress. Her large
figure sat in perfect repose on the coarse bagging, and she was
clad with desert luxury. Heavy robes drooped voluminous folds about
her, from which her dark-skinned head and shoulders, deep golden
brown, freely emerged. Her arms were bare, showing the deep armpits
and half the full breasts; her hair was raven-black, the eyes large
and solemn, the features prominent. She was covered with desert
ornaments; silver rings hooped her ears, strings of beads hung over
a wide brooch on her bosom, bracelets enclosed her arms; but what
most fascinated my eyes was two immense silver crescents, almost
moon-size, that hung by either breast. She was a splendid figure
there under the open sky by the edge of the desertâa true mother of
Ishmael. I shall never forget that unregarding poseâa type of the
ages. They told me she was a rich Bedouin woman. I lingered awhile
among the boats, and when I came away she was still sitting there
immovable.

We drove back, as the afternoon wore on, by a somewhat different
route, taking a branching and rougher road; but there was no real
change in the scene. It was a sterile land, much mixed with sand,
which the labor of man reclaimed with difficulty. The other side of
the island is said to be more fertile, and rich in gardens. It was
the same very open country all the way, and league after league we
left it behind us, rare farms and lonely mosques and dreamy domes
sparsely scattered over broad areas of slightly broken land, wells,
and little olive groves like apple orchards, fringes of palms on
the dying orange sky, tracts of loose sand, speared over with
tufted hummocks, until with the starlight we came back to the
pleasant hotel with the inner courtyard and the climbing yellow
roses.

III

I had
never made a Jewish pilgrimage.
The opportunities for one are rare, for the Jews are not a pilgrim
people. There is on the island, however, a place which is described
as a point of their pious journeying for centuries, and thither I
repaired. It is the synagogue at Hara-Srira, a village of seven
hundred inhabitants, which, with a neighboring and larger village,
concentrates the Jewish population of the island in their
segregated life. It was only a few kilometres away, and I reached
it by a more settled and suburban road than that to Ajim. The
little town was a picturesque sight, gathered none too closely
about the synagogue, which was the principal building. The sexton
and his son, grave persons in Arab costume, took charge of me with
polite attention, and after the boy had assisted me to take off my
shoes I was ushered into the little temple. It was divided into a
series of compartments, and although none of the rooms was large,
the general effect was impressive. I was struck by the richness of
the interior, and its look of cleanliness and finish, for my eyes
had been long unaccustomed to such a scene; the bright tiles, the
lights, the walls, all the furnishings seemed quite new and modern,
European in fact, as if I had stepped back at once into the
familiar world; there was nothing barren or austere, nothing to
suggest the neighborhood of the desert and its ways. It was the
shrine of an alien religion, and wore the aspect of civilization
and a better-provided world, a different economic type, not that of
the gray old mosques in lonely places on the sandy downs. The
priest in his vestments, a slight, middle-aged man, a sacred if not
a stately figure, came to welcome me, and pointing out various
details led the way through the half-darkness of the subdued light
to a small chapel-like room where were the treasures that I had
come to see.

They were books of the old Law and ancient writings that had
found an asylum in the sands. I was glad to be where the object of
pilgrimage was a Book. These venerated copies of sacred writings,
more than libraries, symbolize to me the glory of letters; they are
the founts of civilizations. I have seldom seen a more beautiful
antique manuscript, or one so solemnly impressive, as the massive
volume he showed me, their chief treasure, which, I think, he said
dated from the eleventh century. It recalled lovely copies of the
Koran that I have sometimes found in the mosques of the Levant. I
wished he would read out of it to me, as the young
taleb
at
Kairouan had read the Koran to me by the fading evening light in
the dark-browed court of the Mosque of the Barber, nigh the little
stone cells of the students, after I had seen, above, the
banner-hung tomb of the companion of the Prophet in its solemn
desert state; the lean Arab stood, holding the book in his hands,
with his face lighted up, intoning the verses, and a few others
listening reverently made the group. I shall never forget the music
of that unknown tongue, like the sound of winds in the forest or
waves on the shore. But I did not like to ask the priest to read.
There were other manuscripts, perhaps a score in all, and I spent a
half-hour over them. It was pleasant to be in touch with such
things once more; for, excepting the wide volume that I saw the
seated Jew reading in the street of Tougourt, I did not remember
having seen a book in the desert. The priest was proud of these
treasures, and the boy also who stood by watching as I turned the
leaves; scriptures and learning of long ago, that had survived in
this remote niche, cared for and venerated like the gospels of some
inaccessible Coptic monastery, they were worthy of a scholarâs
pilgrimage and respect.

As I came out into the open I noticed two lines of figures
coming across country in opposite directions like people returning
from church. They were Mohammedans and Jews, each walking from
their respective cemeteries which lay not far away. I thought it
was a typical and happy scene of two religions dwelling together in
unity and peace. The general appearance of the people was much the
same, humbly prosperous and contented, and they were dressed alike.
The Jews here are completely Arabized, except in the point of their
religion, and it was interesting to observe how much they had
become assimilated to the soil. The women especially looked to me
like Bedouin women, and I was obliged to scrutinize their features
to detect their race; but no burnoose nor haik can disguise the
superior vitality and intelligence of the Jews. On my return I
stopped to stroll through the market, and there they were much to
be seen. It was an abundant market with the usual heaps and
collections on the groundâgrains, vegetables, utensils, and special
quarters for wool, meat, and fish. It was a lively and thronged
scene. An auction of donkeys and camels was going on in one place.
My eyes were especially attracted by the piles of sheepskins and
wool, and the men and boys lying lazily on them waiting for custom,
their dark faces and bodies oddly relieved and picturesque on the
wool. There were heaps of black sponges, too; and I noticed a
curious white kilted costume which I had not seen on these shores,
lending a new element to the crowd. Here, too, wandering about, I
experienced the smallness of the world anew; for I fell in with
some travelling merchants who had come to buy burnooses and
blankets of Djerba, and who remembered me from Tunis; they were
plainly pleased to find me in such a remote corner of their own
country. I myself became sufficiently imbued with the spirit of the
place to buy a few dates and figs, and more particularly some dried
orange-blossoms, which were sold by the pound. I had never seen
such a thing in Italy, and it gave me a lively idea of the orange
gardens to the east of the island which were said to be so
luxuriant.

As the day wore idly on, I explored the town, Houmt-Souk, for I
believe I have not yet named it, which has fine, broad, curving
streets and large, open places, a mosque with many domes and a
high, square minaret, a tall artesian well, and a public garden
where the French government experiments with plants and trees. The
proprietor of my hotel was the gardener, and took me about and told
me stories of his garden, but the spring was not far enough
advanced for the soil to tell the same tale of its luxuriance and
rarity. I had to content myself with seeing various shrubs and
exotic trees. Then I wandered down to the beach, like all ocean
beaches, with heavy, loose sand and a considerable tide, the broad
view, sights of the sea, and a ruined Spanish fortress; but I went
especially to see the spot where stood for centuries the great
mound of Christian bones, Skull Fort they called it, which the
pirate Dragut raised after the victory in which he broke the
Spanish fleet in this offing, in 1560, taking five thousand
prisoners and massacring the garrison. I suppose he massacred the
prisoners, too; and here the ghastly memorial of his victory stood
nigh the beach, till in recent years the bones were removed and
buried in the Catholic cemetery. Before that, Norman raiders and
Sicilians, when they harried all these coasts, had temporarily held
possession in the Middle Ages; and all over the island are Roman
ruins, decayed causeways, baths, temples, the subsoil of all the
Mediterranean world. But nothing now stands out in the historic
memory of the old lotus land except Dragutâs grim mound.

IV

I had
not forgotten the hunting of the
lotus, but it was now more clearly defined as a search for the

jujubier
, which is identified with the ancient plant.
Persistent inquiry revealed the probability of a lonely specimen
some five miles off in the country. We set off by a new route to
the southeast, and away from the more travelled roads. The track
was rough, and the horses toiled through heavy sands. The farm we
were seeking was not on the road, and we left the carriage standing
and tramped for about a mile or more across ploughed fields, little
ditches, and stretches of white sand more than ankle-deep, till,
asking our way of the rare people in the fields, we finally found
the house we sought. It was a simple building of one story, with
white walls about it, and the little dome at one end; a rustic
garden of humble cottage flowers was before it, bright with spring
blossoms, and here my guide introduced me to the proprietor, a thin
old man with a boyish figure, keen blue eyes, and great alacrity in
his motions. He led me in through the courtyard, which was of
considerable size, to the house, which consisted of one very large
room, with smaller apartments at the further end under the dome.
The room was a surprise to me; it was a marine room, all the walls
being loosely covered with sailor objects. The old man had followed
the sea all his life, and served many years in the French navy;
now, with his pension, he had found his snug harbor in this remote
peaceful island as a colonist. It was an ideal place for a sailorâs
retirement, with its flowers at the door, its profound country
peace, and its relics of the sea. It had a Crusoe look, and so did
the old man; and I gathered heart, thinking that here at least was
a mariner, like the companions of Ulysses, who had found the port
and elected to remain in the land. There were bones of fishes on
the walls, implements from the South Sea islands, colored prints
tacked all about, the curious things that sailors make, African
oddities, a gun hung over the mantel, barbaric spears in corners;
and the little collection was displayed and arranged with that
neatness and order, almost pattern-like, which is a sailor
instinct.

Yes, there was a
jujubier
in the neighborhood. The old
man, who had an alert, breezy way about him and was full of vigor,
seemed to wonder that I had come to see it, but said nothing; he
was for the time more intent on rites of hospitality, and I went
about examining the curiosities. His wife and a little girl came in
with a great pitcher and tall glasses and set them down before us,
and the old man poured out generous draughts of bright-brown cider.
I smiled to think into what a vintage my dreamed-of juice of the
âenchanted stemâ had resolved itselfâa glass of russet cider! But I
took the blow of fortune, as I have taken others, and tried to find
its soft side, which is a good rule. It was excellent cider, and I
took a second tall tumbler. On inquiry I found it was not even of
the fruit of Djerba, but brewed from a preparation made at Paris,
somewhat as root beer is with us. Meanwhile we had tales of the sea
and old adventures on âthe climbing wave,â pleasant talk, till I
brought the conversation round to the
jujubier
. It bore a
hard, brown fruit, I learned, sweetish, and a drink was made of it,
like lemonade; and, yes, it had a sleepy effect. My hopes sprang up
anew. No, it was not bottled. So, talking incidentally of many
things, my host showed me the rest of the house, the little bedroom
with his photograph of other days, and with a last health we went
out into the garden, where the little girl was waiting with a bunch
of the spring flowers, and we walked off to see the

jujubier
.

It was at the end wall of a small, shut-up Arab house near by,
against which it was trained. It was shoulder-high, and grew in
stout, hardy stocks. The blithe old man told me it must be more
than two hundred years old. I said it was very small for its age;
but he added that its growth was very slow, almost imperceptible.
It was just showing signs of leaving out; a naked, rough,
shrub-like tree, with neither leaf, nor flower, nor fruit; but it
was alive, and I still have hopes that in the case of a tree so
long-lived I shall some time find it in its season, and eat of it,
and perhaps drink its sleepy soul. I went back to the garden and
said good-by to my kind and gentle host, and I was really almost as
glad to have had this tranquil hospitality and Crusoe memory as if
I had met with better luck in my search. I walked back over the
rough fields content; and as we drove slowly through the sand in
the wide prospect of scattered palm and olive, with the little
white domes, quiet in the universal sun, I thought the lotus land
was very good as it was.

V

The
marvellous boy was waiting at the
pier; the sail was set; the steamer, a distant film of gray smoke
on the horizon, was sighted; and we cast off. It was a pleasant
sail but without the romance of the landing. The boy, almost in my
arms, sat steering the boat, and conversed with me with glances of
his brown eyes; the sad-faced father amidships gazed vacantly over
the sea. We laid a straight course, and it was too soon finished.
The embarkation was easy. The old man gave me his benediction with
humble eagerness and dignity, and the boy followed me aboard with
my things. In the saloon he put his little hand in mine, then to
his lips with head bowed, and touched his heart, looked up, smiled,
and ran off. I went on deck in time to catch the last wave of his
brown hand, and, leaning on the rail, watched them sailing homeward
to the palm-set strip of pale orange sky on the long horizon
rim.

TRIPOLI

TRIPOLI

I

ABSALOM ENGLAND, a tall grizzled Arab and
sea-pilot, saluted me on the deck. The combination of names, race,
and occupation might have seemed peculiar to me once, but I was
proof against any African vagary. He was a land-pilot now, and took
charge of me and mine. I did not lose my liberty, but I had
unknowingly parted with all responsibility for myself; thereafter,
except in consular guard or barred in my hotel, I was under his
incessant watch and ward. I even began to have some value in my own
eyes, seeing at what a price I was rated, and could easily have
fancied myself a disguised soldan with an inseparable follower. He
treated me as something between a son and a sheik. But at the
moment, to my unforeseeing eyes, he was only a dark, respectful
Arab, with a weather-worn and open-air look, black with many
summers, a strong type of a fine race, and with a terrible cough
that shook him.

We passed the Turkish officials and sank like a bubble in the
variety and vivacity of the land, always so noticeable when one
comes from the sea. It was pleasant to be in a city once more;
there was noise and movement and things to look at; and almost at
once the gray mass of a magnificent ruined arch, half buried in the
street, lifted its dark and heavy stones, bossed with obliterated
faces and grimy sculpture, among the paltry buildings; a grocery
shop with its bright fruits and lettered boxes seemed to have
nested like a swallow in its lower stories. It looked like a worn,
old ocean rock in that incongruous tide of people and tradeâonce
the proud arch of Marcus Aurelius. A few moments brought us to what
elsewhere would have been an obscure hotel but was here the chief
hostelryâa house with an interior court as usual, a few chambers
opening on dilapidated galleries in a double tier, and rude stairs
leading up. Seyd, a Fezzan negro boy, showed me to a tumbled room.
It was an unpromising outlook even for a brief sojourn. I went at
once to the French consul. The other powers have consuls, except
that America at that time had none; but owing to the old position
of France as the protector of all Catholics, her representative is
pre-eminent in the eyes of the Mohammedansâhe is âthe consul.â The
Consulate was a very fine old Arab house; a magnificent dragoman
with negro guards received me in the great silent court and led me
up the broad stone stairway to the large and beautiful rooms where
I was to feel myself so pleasantly at home. Then Absalom and I
fared forth.

I found myself in a true African street with a new trait. It is
astonishing what originality crops out in the bare and simple
things of this land; one thinks he has seen all, and by some slight
shift of the lights something new emerges and is magically
touchedâthe real and common made mysterious, the daily and usual
made visionary, the familiar unfamiliar once more. It was a narrow
street, vaulted from side to side, and its fresh atmosphere was
bathed in that cool obscurity which in this land of fierce and
burning rays is like balm to the eyes; and, besides, this street
was painted blue, which was to add a caress to the softness of the
light. This was the slight and magical touch. A stream of passers
went down and up the centre of the blueness; the little shops on
either side strung along their bright and curious merchandise of
the museum and the fair; and the shadowy, azure-toned perspectives
framed each figure as it came near, with flowing robe or dark haik
and burdens borne on head and shoulder. The place had an atmosphere
all its own, that stays in the memory like perfume. I loved to
loiter there afterward, but then we had a goal; and we came at last
by flights of steps to the market on the great space near the sea.
I had seen the people by the beach from the steamer and wondered at
their number; and that was why I had come.

It was by far the greatest market I ever saw. It was truly
metropolitan. I went among the plotted squares of merchandise and
rows of goods spread out in great heaps and little piles, and along
by the small tents islanding their foreign treasures. To tell and
name it all would be to inventory a civilization: cloths and finery
and trinkets; grains in sacks, amid which I wandered nibbling hard
kernels of strange savors, trying unknown nuts and dried fruits;
utensils, strange-cornered knives with curves of murder, straight,
broad blades; slippers and caps; what seemed to me droves of
cowsâit was so long since I had seen cowsâcamels and donkeys;
vegetablesâbulbs, pods, and heads; things to eat, bobbing in pots
and kettles; leathers, hides, straws. It was an improvised
expositionâeverything that the desert hand produces or manufactures
of the pastoral kind or that the desert heart has learned to desire
of migratory commerce brought from far away. The grass market
especially attracted me with its heaped-up bales of alfa, where
camels were unloading the unwieldy and enormous burdens balanced
across their backs; and so did the Soudanese corner, with odd
straw-work, deep-colored gourds, and skin bottles.

But the stage was the least part of the scene; in this play the
crowd was the thing. There were familiar traits, but in its
wholeness it was a new crowd. I scanned them as an explorer looks
at an unknown tribe from the hills. There was nothing here of
Tunisian softness, mild affability and elegance, not the simple and
peaceful countenances seen in the Zibans, nor the amiable cheer and
brusque energy of the Kabyles, nor the blond beauty of the
Chaouias, nor even the forbidding face of the Moor; here was a
different temperâthe spirit of the horde, the
fiertÃ©
of the
desert, the rudeness of nature, borne with an independence of mien,
a freedom of gait, unblenching eyes; true desert dwellers. I think
I never felt the full meaning and flavor of the word,
autochthonous, before. They were the soil made man. There was also,
beyond the tough fibre and wild grace of the free life, another
impression, which owed perhaps as much to the feeling of the
stranger there as to anything explicit in the crowdâa sense of
something fierce and hard, an instinct of hostility, of disdain,
the egotism of an alien faith master on its own fanatic soil.

This crowd, which fascinated me by its vitality and temper of
life, was clad in every variety of burnoose and haik and head-gear;
here and there was a crude outbreak of color, as if some one had
spilt, and soiled, aniline dyes at random, but the general effect
was soberâbrown earth colors, mixed blacks and grays, dingy whites,
a work-a-day world. There were many negroes. I had already added
much to my knowledge of negro types, but here I annexed, as it
were, new kingdoms of physiognomy. These men were strange as the
tropics: some amazingly long-waisted, some Herculean in measure or
extraordinarily lean and bulbous in the shouldersânew species of
human heads. Arabs and Berbers, mingled with the mixed blood of
half a continent, made the bulk; and here and there stood some
richer personages, heavily robed, superbly turbaned, merchants from
GhadamÃ¨s and from further off, where the desert routes spread
fanwise from the Soudan to Timbuctoo, opening on the whole breadth
of equatorial Africa, Lake Tchad, and the Niger. For Tripoli has
been for long centuries a sea-metropolisâit is now the last
sea-metropolisâof the native desert world; hither still comes the
raw wealth of Africa, with all the old train and concomitants of
caravan, traders, and robber instincts; and here are most variously
and numerously gathered the representatives of the untamed tribes.
It is the last Mediterranean home of the predatory, migratory, old
free desert life. This market, I knew, was the direct descendant of
one of the worldâs oldest trading-posts, for the early Phoenician
merchants established a commercial station here, as they coasted
along exploring the unknown world; it was on this beach they
landed, no doubt; that was long ago. This market was the child of
that old trading-post. It was a wonderful scene there, under the
crumbling walls in the blazing sun by the quiet sea.

Late in the afternoon I drove out into the oasis, which is a
suburb on the southeast of the city. We were soon in the midst of
it and passing along by the familiar scene of palm groves, with
fruit trees and vegetables and silent roads. It was a more open
country than usual, and there was an abundance of gardens with
houses in them; it had more the character of suburban villa life, a
place of retirement from the city, than any oasis I had seen. The
soil had much red in it, and this gave a strong ground-color over
which the greens rose darkly on the blue. The tall wellsâthe

guerbas
âwere a common feature in the gardens, for the oasis
is watered in the old way by means of a pulley arrangement between
two high standards over which runs a rope worked by a mule or camel
or other beast of all work, which tramped to and fro beneath as the
goatskin bucket rose and fell. I visited some of these gardens,
picked oranges, and wandered about and talked with the laborers. We
came out on the desert sharp as the line of a sea beach, cut by the
palms; there was a fort or two on the edge, and the hard, barren
waste swept away with the finality of an ocean toward the far
distant mountain range southward. Two Turkish officers rode up from
the route; they were fine figures, splendidly horsed, and looked
very real. On the way back we saw many Turkish soldiers, sturdy,
capable men, badly clothed but military in every way. I was more
interested in the groups and solitary figures returning from the
market to their homes, the Bedouins with sticks in their hands or
over their shoulders. How they walked! What an erectness in their
heads! What an
Ã©lan
in their stride forward! Strangely
enough, they reminded me of the virgins of the Erechtheum, the
caryatides. I have never elsewhere seen such a pose. How like in
color to earth, too, with their browns and grays on the strong
tones of the roads they walked along! It was the clearness before
twilight, and all the lines of the landscape were lowered and
strong in the level rays; the palmy roads, the soldiers, the
Bedouins made a picture fuller of life than one usually sees in an
oasis. One felt the neighborhood of the city.

When I went out at night the streets were dark; lamps here and
there gave a feeble light, stores were open, there were groups
about. The cafÃ©s I dropped into were not full, unless small, and
were all very quiet. There were long bubble pipes to be had, and
silent Arabs smoking them; but I contented myself with coffee. It
was not interesting, and I went to the Italian-Greek theatre. This
was a small hall, but of considerable size, and full of Sicilians
and Greeks. They were a hardy looking company, not to say rough. On
the stage a girl was being tied to a tree by some Turks; it was a
pantomime, and the plot went on and the daring rescue was effected
to the satisfaction of the audience. While the stage was being
prepared anew, there was the sound of a row at the door. Instantly
on either side of me there was a movement and thrust of those hard
faces and strong shoulders, like the lift of a dark wave at sea; it
reminded me of a mass-play at football, in the old game, only it
was bigger, darker, tense; it was fighting blood, always keyed for
sudden alarm and instantly ready
en masse
. The little crowd,
serried head over head, paused a moment, as an Arab came forward
and made a short speech, explaining the trouble. The men fell back
to their seats. The play was going on nowâit was a variety
performanceâwith two girls singing songs, and the rescued maiden of
the pantomime came down to collect pennies. It was curious to see
the changing expression on the faces of those men and boys. They
had been hard faces, with Sicilian sombreness in repose, rugged
with life, with something dark and gloomy in them; now they broke
into smiles, their eyes shone and laughed, as she passed among
them, they were glad to have her speak to themâit was sunshine
breaking out over a rough and stormy sea. There was a dance now;
and so the scenes went on till I came away and Absalom piloted me
through the dark and deserted ways to the hotel. It was closed of
course, but I was not prepared for what followed. There was a great
undoing of bars and turning of locks, and I stepped in over the
body of a sleeping negro and waited till his companion did up the
fastenings. They seemed to me sufficient for a fortress; and, not
content with that, these two negroes slept all night on the floor
next the door. It was like a mediÃ¦val guard room.

II

We
were finishing our late nooning at
the cafÃ© which pleased me best near the little park with the old
Roman statues by the sea, where the handful of resident Europeans
liked to take the air at evening. I was engaged in my favorite
occupation of regarding the street. The little room was crowded
with natives seated close, quietly gaming or doing nothing; Turkish
officers rolled by in carriages; there was continuous passing; a
half-dozen
gamins
played in the street, the most
eager-faced, the most lithe-motioned of boys, the most
snapping-eyed Jewish bootblacks, quite beyond the nimble Biskris of
Algiers reputed to be the kings of the profession in the
Mediterranean; on the other side of the street a flower seller was,
as always, binding up violets interminably in his lean hands. It
was a pleasant scene; but I lazily consented when Absalom suggested
that we drive out to the Jewish village. We crossed the street to
the cab-stand. I am not good at bargaining, and I am impatient at
the farce or tragedy, as the case may be, of a guide beating down a
cabman; but my feelings toward Absalom were different. I frankly
admired him as he stood in his plain dignity, perfectly motionless,
with a long-stemmed rose at his lips, a beautiful half-blown dark
bloom with the curves of a shell in its frail, firm petals; and
when the figure had dropped deftly and almost noiselessly from
fifteen francs to six, âit is just,â said Absalom, and seated me in
the carriage with the double harness.

We passed into the pleasant vistas of the oasis, rolling over
the red roads with the tumbled earth walls and by the deep-retired
houses and the orange gardens, and the air was full of the fresh
balm of spring. It was a smiling, green, and blossoming world, and
it was good to be alive. I knew it was just such a world that such
villages are in, and this one was native to the oasis and partook
of its qualities; but it seemed to take only the rudest and
roughest of them and to carry them down. It was a disheartening
sight. I had never seen so wretched a Jewish village. The houses,
the people were of the poorest; and not in an ordinary way. The
village was a fantasy of poverty, a
diablerie
. The faces and
forms, attitudes, occupations of the people, their mere
aggregation, depressed me in a sinister way. Some of them were
sharpening sickles on old bones; and others, women with earrings,
were working at some primitive industry with their toes, using them
as if they were fingers. The little place was thronged and busy as
an ant-hill; but the signs of wretched life were everywhere, and
most in the bodies of these poor creatures. I was glad to be again
in the garden and grove of the roadside, and amid the wholesomeness
of nature, as we drove off to the centre of the oasis.

There we found a great house, that seemed to be of some public
nature, built on the top of a high, bare hill. It belonged to a
pashaw, and its roof commanded the whole view of the oasis and its
surroundings. It was somewhat like a rambling summer hotel in
aspect. We were admitted as if there were nothing uncommon in our
visit, and I mounted to the roof and saw the wide prospectâthe
white city and blue sea behind, the ring of the palmerai about, the
gray desert beyondâand on coming down was taken to a large and
rather empty room with a balcony. There Absalom told me that the
pashaw, who seemed to be the city governor, would be pleased if I
would lend him my carriage, as he had an unexpected call to go to
town. Shortly after the pashaw came in. It was evident that Absalom
regarded him as a very great man. He shook hands with me, and was
gravely courteous; but he understood very little French, and real
conversation was out of the question. He ordered coffee, gave me
cigarettes, and took me out on the balcony, pointing out the desert
mountain range, Djebel-Ghariane, of which there was a fine view,
and other features. We drank our coffee, and after perhaps twenty
minutes of polite entertainment he took my card, shook hands in a
friendly spirit, and bade me good-by with an
au revoir
. I
sat alone looking out from the balcony toward those distant
mountains over the great desert, smoking the cigarettes he had left
me, and thinking of that vast hinterland of fanatic Islam before my
eyes, so jealously guarded from exploration, where the fires of
hatred against the Christian nations are systematically fed, while
a victorious proselytism is sweeping through the central negro
tribes, reclaiming them from fetich worship to âthe only God.â The
carriage was not gone long. We drove back at once, and I found the
flower seller by the cab-stand still twining those endless bunches
of violets, and jonquils and narcissi, in the sinking sun.

That evening we spent at the Turkish theatre. It was better
furnished than the Sicilian. Palms decorated one side of the stage,
and large flags draped the back. The centre was occupied by a group
of three women of whom the one in the middle was plainly the

prima donna
. She was a striking figure, tall, and, in her
dress, attitude, and expression, of the music-hall Cleopatra type.
A high, gilt crown rested on her abundant black hair; her eyebrows
were straight, the eyes liquid, roving, and full of fire, the mouth
and other features large, the throat beautiful and firm; a white
veil descended from the crown on either side, ornaments were on her
arms and feet, she wore a flashing girdle, but the effect of her
person was not dissipated in jewels or color; her figure remained
statuesque, linear, and so much so that there seemed to me
something almost hieratic in her pose, as she stood there, with the
crown and the veil, motionless, the whole semi-barbaric form finely
relieved on the broad stripe of the beautiful flag behind. This was
when she was in repose; when she sang or danced the effect was
quite different. I was not her only admirer. There were a hundred
or more men in the hallâno Europeans. They were smoking, talking,
moving about in their seats freely, with an indolent cafÃ© manner,
and the performance went on with long waits. The lady of the stage
was a favorite; men threw cigarettes to her and engaged her in
conversation from the floor, and she would fling back a sentence to
them. There was one admirer beyond all the rest. He sat in the
centre near the stage, a splendidly appointed youth from
Alexandria, garbed in the richest red, with a princely elegance and
mien, a gallant; cigarettes were not for himâhe stood up and threw
kisses with both hands vociferously and numerously; he left no
doubt as to his sentiments. Once or twice he attempted to rush the
stage, but was restrained. He would go out, and come back loaded
with flowers for ammunition. He had a negro rival off to the left,
also finely apparelled, but no match in that regard for the
Alexandrian red, though he held his own in the attention of both
the audience and the queen of the stage. Meanwhile the numbers of
the performance lazily succeeded one another; there was music on
the zithern and mandolin, the tambour was heardâsongs, dances,
other girls. It was all perfectly blameless; and, indeed, in my
judgment, the Arabs have a stronger sense of public decorum than
the northern barbarians at their play. I saw the entertainment out
and went to my castle.

III

A drive
in the oasis was always worth
having; the sky was the purest blue, it was brisk desert air in the
nostrils, and notwithstanding my misadventure with the Jewish
village I yielded to Absalomâs programme and went to see how the
negroes fared at their own rendezvous. It was a lesson to me not to
prejudge even a trifling adventure in a new land. The sight was
piquant. The village was a little collection of conical roofed huts
with brush fences round each one; a few palms feathered the sky
over it, and groves of them made the horizon lines, except where
the sparkling sea stretched off beneath the bluff. The place was
alive with women and children in striped burnooses and nondescript
folds, whose rough edges and nutty colors seemed to belong to the
complexions and stiff hair, of all varieties of turn, that one saw
on every side. They were very poor people, of course, but their
miserable state did not make so harsh an impression as in the case
of the Jewish village; there was a happy light in their faces and a
fitness in the environment of hut and brush under the palms in the
sun which made the scene a part of nature. It was a bit of
equatorial Africa transplanted and set down hereâa Soudanese
village in its native aspect, even to that touch of grimace, as of
human nature laughing at itself, which negroes have in their wild
state. I had a flash of such an experience at GabÃ¨s; in the oasis,
just below the beautiful sweep of the cascades, there suddenly
sprang up before me in the bush a young negress, as wonderfully
clad as unclad. It was as if a picture in my geography had come to
life. I might have been in a jungle on the banks of the Niger. It
was the same here; the degrees of latitude seemed to have got
mixed; the scene belonged much further south under a tropic sky,
and I lingered about it with interest and curiosity.

Then I turned to the market close byânot a great market like
that of the city but the oasis market. It did not cover a large
space, but was prettily situated, and banked at one side by a fine
palm grove, which gave it character and country peace. There were
two or three hundred people there, scattered among the usual
squares of goods and vegetables, variegated with straw work, skin
bottles, and Soudanese helmets; but there was an uncommon number of
animalsâcamels and cows, sheep and goats. There was slaughtering
going on near the palm grove. It seemed that the purchaser picked
out the particular sheep he preferred, and it was made mutton
before his eyes. It reminded me of Greek Easter days. The scene,
however, was by no means sanguinary; it was a country fair amid the
quiet palms asleep in the blueâthe life of the people in their own
land in their ancestral ways.

IV

The
consul had made me his friend by
incessant kindness. He had at the start insisted on my taking my
first meal in Tripoli with him, and since then I had lived almost
as much at his table as at the hotel, which was a blessing, not to
say a charity. He was a scholarly gentleman, long resident in the
Levant, and familiar with the Moslem world, though his appointment
to Tripoli was of recent date. It was to this last fact, perhaps,
that I owed the rarest of my privileges, an invitation to visit the
mosques in his company. Tripoli is a stronghold of fanaticism, and
the mosques are jealously closed to the infidel; permission to
visit them is seldom given, and if formally granted is generally
made nugatory in some underhand way; for a person in my unofficial
station such a visit would be unexampled. The consul, however, had
never himself seen them, and he suggested that this would be an
opportunity for me. His application was at once honored, and the
next morning the chief of police called and we set out at once,
preceded by the consular
cavass
or dragoman, himself no mean
figure corporeally, brilliant in his Algerian uniform and bearing
before him the formidable and highly ornamented staff of his
office.

We went first to the Gurgy Mosque, which is considered the
finest of all. I wondered if the key would be lost, which is the
usual subterfuge; but the guardian was quickly found, and turned
the lock. My account of the mosques must be meagre; the occasion
allowed of only a
coup dâÅil
, it was impossible to take
notes on the spot, and one could examine in detail only near
objects in passing. I can give only an impression, not a
description. All mosques are much alike in plan and arrangement.
There is a plain, open hall with the great vacant floorspace for
prayer, the ornamented mihrab or niche in the wall, showing the
direction of Mecca toward which all turn, with brazen candlesticks
or hanging silver lamps, and by its side and at a little distance
the high pulpit with a steep stairway for the preacher or leader;
there may be also a closed box on the floor, or sometimes elevated,
for the Sultan or his representative, and a latticed space for
women. These are permanent features. The mosques differ much,
however, in size, ornamentation, and aspect, and in the

entourage
of the main room, its approaches, courts, and
dependencies. The interior of the Gurgy Mosque was square, finely
decorated, beautifully wrought. Intersecting arches, resting on
rows of columns, divided it into several naves with many domes. The
walls were tiled, and an unusual look of elaborate finish was given
to the general effect by the fact that all the surfaces were
entirely covered, nothing being left bare; to the color tones of
the tiles were added on all sides the lights of the highly wrought
stucco incrustation, cool marbles, and the dark, rich contrasts of
beautifully carved wood. The capitals of the columns, done in
stucco, were each different. Texts of the Koran, illuminated in a
fine script on a broad band at the base of the domes, gave another
element to the decoration. It was a beautiful mosque, and I
remember it as one of the few I have seen which were perfectly
finished; there was nothing ruinous or aged or bare about it, and
it was completedâa lovely interior in which the simple elements of
beauty employed in this art were admirably blended. We especially
admired the carved woodwork here. Our stay, however, was but of a
few momentsâ duration, and we saw only this interior.

We passed on to the Mosque of Dragut, the pirate, the same who
built the mound of Christian skulls at Djerba by the seashore. It
was quite different, a plain old mosque with old columns, and
seemed to belong to old times. In a low chamber to one side was
Dragutâs tomb. It was covered with green cloth, and at the four
corners colored banners hung over it; other tombs stood about it in
the chapel, princes of Islam, and the usual maps of Mecca and the
tomb of the Prophet were on the walls, and some cherished objects
of historic or personal reverence were here and there; all about
were the great candles and the turban-topped small columns of the
dead. It was a place of profound peace. This impression was
deepened still more as we passed out into the adjoining courts with
their low, crypt-like columns, whitewashed, heavy, and sombre. Here
the commissary, or chief, who had us in charge, an amiable-faced
Turk with a gray, grizzled beard, pointed out the tomb of the
English captain, as it is known, a renegade lieutenant of Dragut,
who sleeps in a beautiful niche nigh his old commander. Further on
beneath an immense, broad old fig-tree in the court were other
tombs, with the turbaned end-slabs of different styles and
heightsâa little company shut in this quiet close of death. A great
silence and peacefulness reigned there, alike about the ancient
fig-tree without and in the bannered chamber within. I could not
help thinking what a place of repose the great pirate had found out
for himself and his companions in his death. I went out touched
more than commonly with that sense of deep calm which a mosque
always, half-mysteriously, awakes in me.

Of the third mosque, which I did not identify, but suppose to
have been that of Mahmat, we had barely a passing glimpse, looking
down from a gallery upon a large carpeted floorâthere were many
carpetsâbut it seemed to offer nothing of special interest. The
fourth, however, El-Nakr, the Mosque of the Camel, was after my own
heart. It is the most ancient, as indeed one would expect from the
name, that of Dragut being next in age, and has the special
sanctity that attaches to a traditional religious spot. I suppose
it was here that the faith began on the soil. We entered first into
one of those low-columned, crypt-like courts; two tall palms were
growing in it, with a little patch of bright-green barley beneath.
The artistic effect of this simple scene of nature, framed in the
seclusion of the gray old walls, with its bit of sky above, the
sunshine and the unbroken peace, as it fell on my eyes, was
indescribable; of a thousand scenes it imprinted itself on my
memory as a thing seen once and seen foreverâone of those pictures
that are only painted by the soul for itself. We passed within. It
was an old plain mosque, with low columns and an ancient look, all
without elegance or ornament. It was in the same spirit as that of
Dragut, but with still more of austerity and impressiveness. This
was the stern old faith, which could dispense with all but God. It
touched the Puritan sentiment in me to the quick. This was Islam in
its spirituality. Here there was the solitary desert soul in its
true devotion, that sought only room for Godâthe same room as on
the desert sands or on mountain tops. There was nothing else in the
mosqueâonly the barley under the palms by the crypt-like cloister,
the low-columned austerity within. I felt the harmony of the
twoâthey were different chords, but one music of the desert
silence.

It was only when we came out from this sanctuary that I noticed
any resentment among the people. As we walked down by the row of
men standing about the entrance, scowling faces and fire-flashing
eyes were bent on us on all sides, but there was no other
demonstration, and we passed through the crowd in that silent glare
of hate. It is a curious sensation to feel oneself an object of
hatred to a crowd, and this was my first experience of it, though,
of course, one notices the hostile look of individuals in
Mohammedan countries. It was disagreeable; and I half blamed myself
for having violated a prejudice which was perfectly natural for
these men. We were out of the press in a few moments, and soon
reached the last mosque that it was thought worth while to visit,
that of Ahmed Pashaw. It was large, of the same decorated type as
the first. There were the same old marble columns, the beautifully
ornamented mihrab, the pulpit, the Sultanâs box, a brown latticed
gallery; bright mats lay on the floor, the blue and green tiles
shone cool on the walls, moulded stucco and carved wood filled the
spaces, there being one unusually fine ceiling in carved wood; and
there were Koranic texts. The crescent was abundantly used in the
decoration. It was all very beautiful and characteristic, full of
restful tones, of harmony and repose. As we passed toward an inner
door leading to the cemetery of the mosque, we noticed inscriptions
to the dead on the wall, and one was pointed out of a pious man who
went straight to Paradise. Outside beyond the tall minaret were the
tombs of the faithful who were buried here, with the turban-topped
slabs as usual. The guardian, who seemed a very old man, with true
Arab gentleness urged me repeatedly and cordially to climb the
minaret, but I refrained, disliking to detain my companions. We
passed out from this beautiful inner close into the street, and
turned to the Consulate where we talked over our morningâs
walk.

It was no small part of my pleasure in Tripoli that I owed to my
friendâs hospitality, which gave me the graces and comfort of
civilization in so rude a place as the ordinary traveller
necessarily finds such a country. The boys of the oasis, in other
parts of Africa, had given me the wine of the date-palm fresh from
the tree; here I drank it a little fermented, an exotic drink
piquing the curiosity, and was the more glad to renew my memory of
a long-forgotten
rosso spumante
and to make altogether new
acquaintance with pleasant wines of Touraine. What conversations we
had over these and on the quiet terrace by the garden, ranging
through French African territory and the Levant, touching on
Persian poets; and my host showed me many beautiful things. It is
in this atmosphere of scholarly talk and friendly kindness that I
remember the morning walk among the mosques of Tripoli.

V

The
British consul, who had also shown
me attention, arranged for me to visit the Turkish school of arts
and crafts. Hassan Bey, who seemed to be an aid of the Vali, waited
on us one morning at the Consulate, and we set out to walk to the
school. Hassan Bey was an exile from Daghestan, of a fine military
figure, middle-aged, thick-set, with a pleasant countenance; his
gray whiskers became his energetic face; he had a look of power and
the grave authority of character. He wore a sword; his sleeves and
gold braid gave distinction to his person; and he carried lightly,
like a cane, the short, twisted whip of stiff bullâs hide that one
occasionally sees on these coasts. I have seldom seen so manly a
figure, rugged and strong, and stamped by nature for rule; and his
politeness was complete and charming, with an accent of strength
and breeding that put it out of the category of mere grace of
manners. He interested me profoundly by his personality, an
entirely new type in my experience, and as the walk was somewhat
long I had an opportunity to observe him.

The director of the school received us cordially, gave us coffee
and cigarettes, and showed us through the buildings which were
rather extensive. The school is endowed with some lands, and its
income is supplemented by voluntary funds and a subsidy from the
government. It receives upward of one hundred and fifty pupils,
from the age of twelve years, and completely supports them during
the course, which is seven years in length. Some literary
instruction is given, such as geography and secondary branches; but
the main end of the school is technical training in the arts and
crafts. There was a carpet and silk-weaving department, a
tailor-shop, a shoe-shop, carpentry, a foundry and blacksmithing, a
refectory and store-rooms. The shops were rather empty, and the
students whom I saw were few and of all ages; the rest may have
been at their books. The foundry and the carpenter-shop were the
busiest and most occupied; there were many heavy pieces of
machinery of modern make, and the department seemed properly
provided for and in competent management; work was going on in both
these rooms, which I watched with great interest. I was told that
the furniture of the Ottoman Bank was made here, and apparently
orders of various kinds, as, for example, for wheels, were
regularly received.

The foundation clearly enough was only a beginning, and the
provision inadequate to the scale; but it was a serious and
admirable attempt to plant the mechanical arts in the country in
their modern form and development, and to foster industry in the
simple crafts. The idea was there and in operation, however the
means to realize it might seem small in my American eyes, used to
great industrial riches in such things; and I was much impressed,
not only by the facts but by the spirit of the thing and those who
had it in charge. The products seemed excellent, so far as I could
judge of the various things shown me. I followed the example of the
consul in buying a small bolt of strong silk in a beautiful design
of brilliant-colored stripes, and I should have been glad to have
taken more in other varieties. I was rather surprised when at the
end Hassan Bey suggested my going into the girlsâ carpet school. We
entered, paused a moment at the school-room door that some notice
might be given, and on going into the room I saw that all the
girls, who were young, were standing with their faces turned to the
wall. We remained only long enough to see the nature of the work
and its arrangement, and for a word with the teacher; but the
scene, with the young girlish profiles along the sides, was
picturesque. There is one other carpet school for girls in another
city. We spent perhaps two hours in this inspection and walked
leisurely back to town, where I parted with Hassan Bey with sincere
admiration.

In the afternoon I went with Absalom to visit a school I had
heard of in the Jewish quarter, a pious foundation, the bequest of
a wealthy Jew, for the education of poor boys. There were about
five hundred of them there, bright-eyed, intelligent, intent, as
Jewish boys in their condition usually are. The buildings were
excellent, properly furnished, with the substantial and prosperous
look of a well-administered educational enterprise. I visited
several rooms, saw the boys at their desks and classes, heard some
exercises, and talked with the professor in charge. I noticed a
tennis-court on the ground. Altogether, I was more than favorably
impressed by what I saw, and the mere presence here of a
well-organized charity school on such a scale was an encouraging
sign. It was surprising to me to find this establishment and the
technical school at Tripoli, where I had certainly not anticipated
seeing anything of the sort, nor was this my only surprise. I had
thought of Tripoli as a semi-barbarous country almost detached from
civilization, a focus for Moslem fanaticism, a place for Turkish
exiles, a last foothold of the slave-trader, and such it truly was;
but it did not present the aspect of neglect and decay that I had
imagined as concomitant with this. The old gates of the city had
recently been removed; outside the walls there was a good deal of
new building going on, which was a sign of safer and more settled
life as well as of a kind of prosperity; the roads were excellent,
and in a Turkish dependency that is noticeable; in some places new
pavements had been laid. In other words, there was evidence of
enterprise and public works, of modern life and vitality; and this
impression was much strengthened by my experience of the two
schools. It is true that I never lost the sense of that strangely
conglomerate crowd that passed through the streets, that mixed and
fanatic people. I indulged no illusions with respect to the
populace
en masse
. The state of things, however, seemed to
me by no means so bad, with these stirrings of civilization, of
betterment, of a modern spirit in the city, and I was frankly
surprised by it.

My surprise melted away some months later when, on opening my
morning paper in America to read of the Turkish revolution, I saw
that the Vali of Tripoli was among the first of the exiles to sail
for Constantinople; and I observed that, later, he had an active
part in the government of the Young Turks. He and Hassan Bey had
been doing in Tripoli what they had been exiled for wishing to do
on the Bosphorus. Then I understood.

VI

It
was night. Absalom and I were in the
Arab quarter, on our way to see some Soudanese dancing. There were
few passers in the deep-shadowed, silent, blind streets that grew
darker and seemed more mysterious as we penetrated deeper into the
district. We had gone a considerable distance. From time to time a
man would meet us, and then another. We seemed to be going from
precinct to precinct under some sort of escort. I noticed that
Absalom had many hesitations; once or twice he refused to go
further, and there was something resembling an altercation; then he
stopped decisively, and would not budge until some one whom he
desired should come in person. We stood, a group of four or five,
waiting in the obscure passageway for some ten minutes. At last the
man came, a tall Arab, with a look of rude strength and
superiority. He was the chief, and we walked on with him in that
dark network of corners and alleys. I was beginning to think it a
long distance, when we turned under a heavy gateway into a dark,
open court, as large as a small city square, with houses round it
like tenements. A kerosene lamp in a glass cage flared dimly on one
side, and there were a few figures round the court; but the scene
soon took on a livelier aspect.

The chief began collecting his men in the centre, and numbers of
people emerged from the houses and sat on the edges near the walls
of the houses. They were a rough-looking crowd, evidently very poor
and badly clothed, and there were many that made a wild appearance
squatting there in the darkness. Two policemen, attracted by the
commotion, came in, and a street lamp was transferred into the
court. There was now quite a gathering in the centre, where a fire
had been built by which three men were seated; some sort of incense
was thrown into it, and a light smoke with a pungent odor began to
be lightly diffused through the court. There must have been as many
as seventy in the crowd round the fire, and at least a couple of
hundred spectators crouched about the sides; it was more of an
exhibition than I had expected, and from the corner where I sat
with Absalom and two or three attendants the scene began to be
weird. Then the drum beat in the middle; the men, all of whom had
clappers, lifted them in the air, falling into line, and
immediately one of those wild, savage chants shrilled forth, rising
and rising to an acute cry and falling monotonously down,
increasing in volume and mingling with the noise of the sharp
clappers and the drumâan infernal din. The chant of the AÃ¯ssaouas,
that I had heard in the desert, was âmellow music matched with
this.â And, from the first moment it never stopped; it was
ear-piercing as it reverberated in the closed court, and at first
it was confusing.

The dance began with a procession in double file round the fire,
with the three men seated by the smoky flame. It was a slow walk
timed to the rhythm of the voices and the clappers, gradually
increasing in speed and becoming a jump, with violent
gesticulation, twisting, and long reaching of the arms and legs,
while the human cry grew shriller and more vibrant and rapid in the
emotional crisis of the excitement. Round and round they went, and
from time to time the line would break into parts as the men turned
to the centre just before me. There were three persons who seemed
to be leaders: one, whom I named the Hadji because he answered to
my idea of that word, another dervish-like, and a black man. The
dervish interested me most. He was the head of his group, and as he
came between me and the fire, standing well forward from his band
and well in toward the fire, he would whirl, and then reverse,
whirling in the opposite direction; andâhe and the procession
moving forward all the timeâhe would fall limply forward toward his
men almost to the ground, recover, and fling himself backward,
rising high with his clappers spread far over his head. It was a
diabolical posture; and, as he stood so, his leaping followers
bowed down to him, kneeling almost to the ground but not touching
it, and flinging themselves erect far back with arms spread. I
wondered how they kept their balance in that dancing prostration.
Then the group would pass on, and the next come into playâthe
Hadji, the black manâwith the same ceremony, but without the
whirling. Round and round they went interminably; the chant rose
and fell, the march slackened and quickened, and every few moments
there was this spasmodic rite of the salutation and prostration at
the height of the dance.

The ring of spectators, crouched and huddled round the court,
sat in the imperturbable silence and apathy of such audiences. The
edges of the scene were an obscure mass of serried, half-seen forms
under the house walls, filling the space rather closely; the smoke
of the incense, with which the fire was fed, hung in the air, and
Absalom said it was good for my eyes; the only light was the blaze
of the flame upon the dark, moving forms in the middle, and the two
street lamps over them, and the night-sky above. It was an
unearthly scene, with those strange figures and heavy shadows; and
the fearful din made it demonic. I do not know what the dance was,
its name or origin; but it seemed to me to be devil worship, a
relic of the old African forest, a rite of the primitive paganism
and savage cults of the early world. The three dark men by the fire
with the drum, the grotesque, fantastic ritual of the bowing and
kneeling procession, the atmosphere of physical hysteria and
muscular intoxication, the monotonous, shrill cry in which the
emotional excitement mountedâhere were traits of the prehistoric
horde, of a savagery still alive and vibrant in these dancing
figures. It was as if I were assisting at a worship of the Evil One
in a remote and barbarous past.

After a while I began to take notice of particular individuals
in the dancing mass. I was specially attracted by three who seemed
uncommonly strong and tireless and made a group by themselves. They
were poorly but distinctively clad. One was in black, with loose
arm-sleeves showing his bare skin to the breast; one was in white,
with an over-haik of black divided down the back, which streamed
out; the third, who was very tall and lank, one of the tallest
figures there, was in blue, faded and worn; and, as they danced, of
course the folds of these garments spread out on the air, showing
their bare legs in free motion. Their heads were closely covered
with white, except the mouth and eyesânot merely covered, but
wrapped. I turned to Absalom, and said, âTouaregs.â He looked at
them, as I picked them out for him, and said, â
SÃ¬, signor
,â
for he always spoke to me in Italian. I had wished much to see some
Touaregs, and, though I had seen men with covered faces, I had
never been quite sure. They are the finest race of the desert,
first in all manly savage traits, bandits of the sands, complete
and natural robbers, fierce fanatics, death-dealersâthe most feared
of all the tribes. They cover their faces thus to protect them from
the sand, for they are pure desert men. I smiled to think that at
my first meeting with the terrible Touaregs I found three of them
dancing for my amusement; but I looked at them with the keenest
interest. They were certainly superb in muscular strength. At the
end of an hour they showed no weariness; and there was a vigor in
their motions, an elasticity and endurance that easily
distinguished them from the others. I watched them long. They were
perfectly tireless, and the dance called for constant violent
muscular effort. I shall never forget that group, whose garb
itself, thin and open, had a riding look, and especially the man in
the blue garment, with long, gaunt arms and legs, who fell forward
and rebounded with a spring of iron.

There were some changes in the method and order of the motions,
but the dances for the most part were merely new arrangements of
the same jumping and kneeling performance. I sat in the awful din
of it for two hours, interested in many things, and rather pleased,
I confess, at being alone in such a company. One gets nearer to
them so in feeling; with a companion of the same race, even though
unknown, one stays with his race. I left the dance still in the
full tide of vehemence and glory of uproar, overhung by the light
pungent smoke and dissonance, with the obscurely crouching throng
in the low shadows, and as we lost the sound of it in the deep
silence of the dark lanes, where we met no one, I think the night
of an Arab city never seemed so still. A man with a lantern went
ahead to light the way which was black with darkness; Absalom and
the headman went with me, and a negro followed behind. They
attended me to the door of the hotel, and it was a striking night
scene as I stood in the hallway, the negro guards roused from their
straw mats looking on, and shook hands with the strong-faced,
rough-garbed headman who had had me in his protection that
night.

VII

I went
out for a last drive with the
British consul toward the oasis of Gergarish, which lies westward
of the city, a new direction for me. He was familiar with the
Mediterranean; and, the talk falling on the classical background of
North Africa, I told him of my search for the lotus at Djerba. He
avowed his belief that much of the Greek mythic past had its local
habitation on these coasts, and gave me a striking and quite
unexpected instance. I had supposed that Lethe was an underground
stream and approached only by the ghosts of the dead. He assured me
that it was situated not very far from Benghazi, where he had been
consul, and made an excellent table water. It is a large fountain
or underground lake in a cave; he had been on it in a boat with a
friend, and it was said that fumes from the water would oppress the
passenger with drowsiness. I heard this with great interest, and
like to remember that I can obtain a cup of Lethe, should I desire
it, this side the infernal world. My friend added his belief that
partial oblivion can be found comparatively widely diffused in
North Africa, not being dependent on either Lethe or the lotus.
This tradition of drowsiness which attaches to these coasts in old
days is to be attributed to the quality of the air, which is
soporific. Continued residence causes a loss of memory, not that
one forgets his early days, home, and children, like the
lotus-eaters, but one grows uncertain about recent events and the
mind becomes hazy as to whether one has or has not done this or
that; to such a degree is this true that my friend advised a return
to the north at least once in two years to allow the memory to
recover its normal force. With such talk, which was quite seriously
said, though it has its humorous side, and which faithfully
reflects the African atmosphere, we whiled away the time,
conversing, too, of the American excavations at Benghazi and the
bells of Derna that rang the Italian priest to his deathâfor the
Arabs dislike bellsâand the thousand and one topics on which a
traveller is always prepared to receive information. I had been so
long alone that those talks at Tripoli were almost as much of a
rarity as the scenes; they are an essential part of my memory of
the voyage.

Our destination was not the oasis, but some caverns on a height
above it. The day was brilliant and a noble desert view stretched
round us from the eminence. The blue sea sparkled not far away, an
horizon-stripe up and down the coast as far as one could see; the
splendid dark green mass of the oasis lay just below us in the
valley, and between us and it the desert plain undulated with the
long slopes of a rolling prairie, spotted with cattle and a few
Arab groups; inland the sands swept on to the line of mountains low
on the far horizon. The mass of rock above us was picturesque and
solitary. The gem of the view, however, was Tripoli eastward. It
was the first time I had truly seen the city from outsideâjust such
a Moslem city as one dreams of, a white city, small and beautiful,
snowy pure in the liquid air. I was surprised at its beauty. We
explored the cave. It was of a sort of stratified pumice stone and
partly filled up with sand. It had been at some time a troglodyte
dwelling, and chambers had been hollowed in it. There are many
troglodytes, or cave-dwellers, still living in this primitive
manner in rock-hewn chambers in North Africa. There are villages of
them in the mountains back of Biskra, and especially in the
southeastern corner of Tunisia opposite Djerba, and they are found
in the low range of the Djebel-Ghariane that I was looking on in
the distance. This cavern that we were exploring was one of their
prehistoric haunts, a natural fortress and place of refuge for a
small group of families in the wild waste.

The drive back was uncommonly beautiful, very African in color,
and increasing in atmospheric charm as we neared the city in the
clarity of the sunset light. The coast view was especially lovely.
The blue sea made the offing, along which a line of scattered
palms, continuous but thin enough to give its full value to each
dark green tuft in the blue air, and to many a single columnar stem
beneath, ran like a screen, not too far from the roadway; and the
strong foreground was that red-brown earth with the sunset light
beginning on it. The beautiful white city lay ahead of us. The
quality of the atmosphere was remarkable. The trees were very
light, and seemed to float in the sky, like goldfish in a globe;
and as the sunset grew, the diffused rose through the palms on the
other side seemed almost a new sky. It was my last evening in
Tripoli.

VIII

I had
loitered for the last time in the
street of the blueness and lingered in the souks of the Djerba
merchants and especially in the little shop of a mild-mannered
Soudanese dealer where I gathered up the curious objects that had
been slowly collecting there for me to serve as mementosâthings of
gourd and hide, of skin and straw, a few ostrich plumes. I had
photographed the bakerâs shop, and stopped at the intersection of
the four corners to look once more at the ever-passing figures of
the inscrutable and conglomerate crowd, the float of the desert
life. I had called on my friend and kind adviser at the French
Consulate, and my British host, to both of whom I owed so much of
the pleasure and variety of my travellerâs sojourn. In one respect
it was unique in my wanderings. I had never seen so many strata of
culture, so many diverse kinds and stages of human life, in one
place. I had had a last talk with Seyd, the boy from Fezzan, and
with the negro guards of the gate and the boys at the door who were
eager rivals for my morning favors. Now it was over, and I stood on
the deck with Absalom. I was sorry to part with him. What a
faithful watch he had kept! No matter at what hour I stepped out
into the street, he was there, seated by the wall; wherever I left
my consular friends, in some mysterious way he was instantly there
in the street at my side. He had tempted me to a longer stay with
lures of hunting in the desert where he calmly explained he would
watch with a gun while I slept, and then I would watch, though
there would be two others with us, but it would be better if one or
the other of us were always awake, for one did not know what might
be in the desert; and he had planned a voyage to Lebda, the city of
Septimius Severusâit might be a rough voyage in a boat none too
good, but was not he a pilot? He had brought me one day all his
pilot papers; there were hundreds of them, each with the name of
the craft and the signature of the captain whose ways he had safely
guided on this dangerous coast in the years gone by. But my voyage
in North Africa was finished; it was done; the much that I had left
unseen, and I realized how much that wasâfor wherever one goes, new
horizons are always rising with their magical drawing of the
unknownâall that was for âanother time.â So, knowing the end had
come, he took both my hands in both his for our warm addio, bent
his head, and went slowly down the shipâs side.

I watched the scene as we drew away. The central mass of the
fort stood in shadow, and the sunset light streamed over the
eastern side of the city, the beach and bluffs; slender minarets
islanded the sky; the blue crescent of the bay lay broad beneath;
the oasis rose over the banked earth, and stretched inland, and the
high horizon line was plumed with tall single palms tufting the
long sky. I watched it long, till the beautiful city in the fair
evening light lessened and narrowed to a gleam, and at the end it
was like the white crest of a wave that sank and was seen no
more.

IX

I went
on deck. It was a May night with
a fresh, cold wind. There was a bright star over the crescent moon
which hung well down the west, and all the heavens were bright, but
not too bright. I leaned on the rounds of a rope ladder of the
rigging by the shipâs side aft, and was alone; it was cold, and the
passengers were few. I noticed on the horizon a dark shadow
half-risen from the waters and mounting toward the moon; it rose
rapidly, and grew black as it neared the light above. It was like a
high arch, or cascade of gloom, broadening its skirts as it fell on
the horizon. The moon was its apex, and seemed about to enter it.
The scene was fantastic in the extreme, unearthly, a scene of Poeâs
imagination; the moon hung as if at the entrance of an unknown
region into which it was about to descend. But there was no further
change. The moon crested the arch; the single star burned
brilliantly directly above and between the horns of the crescent
and at some distance aloft. I watched the strange spectacle; the
moon and the broad-skirted curtain of black gloom, pouring from it
on the waters just in the line of its bright track over the sea,
sank slowly down together. The moon reddened as it neared the
horizon line, and when the crescent at last rested on the sea, and
the shadow had been wholly absorbed in the moonâs track, there was
another Poesque effect; the horned moon was like a ship of
flameânot a ship on fire, but a ship of flameâsailing on the
horizon. That picture, though it could have been but for a few
moments, seemed to last long, and sank dying in a red glow slowly.
I remember recalling the lines:

âThe moon of Mahomet

Arose, and it shall set.â

What followed was so singular that it may be best to record it
in nearly the exact words of my rough notes, made early the next
morning off Malta:

âThe strange thing was that the star, still somewhat high in the
west, growing brighter, took the track of the moon. I mean the
moonâs path of light on the water became the starâs path, as plain
but whiter; one passed and the other was there imperceptibly; one
became the other. It reminded me of one faith changing into
another, from a higher heavenly source. I stayed because the star
was so beautifulâthe most beautiful star I ever saw, except perhaps
the star off Cyprus. It grew larger and more radiant, with many,
many points, and became a bunch, as it were, of jackstraw rays, one
crossing another, all straight; and then, as I looked, a strange
thing happened.

âI saw what might have been spirits in the star, as in a
picture. The star lost shape, and became only the setting of these
forms of light, perfect human figures. At first there were two, one
older and one younger, like an angel with Tobias or Virgin with the
young St. John; then there were many others, not at the same time,
but successively. Some were constantly repeated; the Byzantine
throned figure hieratic, the highwinged angel tall, the young angel
seated and writing, the standing figure, prophetic, blessing, with
high hands. There were scenes as well as figures: desert scenes as
of Arabsâeffects of the white and dark, like turbaned and robed
figures together; the Magian scene; mixed moving groups, sometimes
turned away from me. The figures often moved with regard to each
other, and trembled on my own eye singly. When the star approached
the horizon, there were figures that seemed to walk toward me on
the sea, all white and radiantâsingle figures always. There were in
all three sorts: Byzantine, with the crown or canopy above, and the
throne; Italian groups and lines; and Moslem. There was nothing
distinctively Greek except seated figures.

âThis continued till the star set, perhaps an hour. I would look
off from the star to the other stars and to the sea; but as soon as
my eyes went back to the star, there were the changing figures
still to be seen. One did not see the star, but the figures; not
framed in a star or in a round orb, but on a shapeless background;
one saw only figures of light as if âthe heavens were opened.â And
when the star set and was gone, another planet above, also very
bright, as I looked, opened in the same way, with similar figures.
There I saw a form with Michel-Angelo-like limbs, seated on the orb
with loose posture, like the spirit of the star, and then a tall,
throned figure with the crown over it. I did not at any time see
any featuresâonly forms, very distinct in limbs and modelling of
figure, but too distant for features. It was an hour or more, and I
still saw them in the new star when I turned away to go below. My
eyes were tired. I was not at all excitedâquite steady, and
observing and experimenting; for I had never known anything similar
to this. The visions were constant, without any interval, though
changing. It was like looking into a room through a window, or out
of a room upon a landscape.

âIt was wonderfully
spiritual
and beautiful. The figures
were all noble and beautiful, especially in line, and occupied with
something, like living forms. They were
white
, but not with
white clothing, except the Moslem figures, sometimes; but white as
of some
substance of light
âthe faces sometimes dark, and
there were shadows marking relations of the figures, but not
shadows thrown by the figures. I made no effort to shape them; they
came; they were of themselves.

âI thought this was what Blake saw; what the shepherds saw; what
all orientals saw when the heavens were âopenedââwhat Jacob saw,
perhaps. What struck me was that the star was no longer a star, but
shapeless, and only
a means of seeing
. It was a most
remarkable experience.â

Africa was always a land of magic; and it seemed to me that
night as if the spirit of the land were bidding me, who had so
loved it, farewell.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

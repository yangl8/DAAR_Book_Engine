On Sameness and Identity.

PART I.

THE KINDS OF SAMENESS.

And some require everything accurately stated; whereas, this accuracy annoys others,
either because of their inability to follow a train of reasoning through, or because of its hair-splitting
character; for accuracy does involve some hair-splitting.

Aristotle, Metaph. Book I, The Less, c. 3.

Section 1.
There are few words the ambiguity of which has
led to more confusion and profitless dispute than that of the word

same
. Men constantly use this word as though it had but one
meaning, and that meaning were always clear, whereas it really
gives expression to a number of widely different experiences,
some of which are quite difficult of analysis. It is highly desirable
that these experiences should not be confounded with each
other, but kept clearly separate, as the consequences of such
misconception are very far-reaching. How far-reaching, I shall
in the pages to follow try to indicate.

It is my purpose to point out the differences in connotation of
the several senses of this highly ambiguous word, to show the
element which they have in common, and to trace some of the
difficulties and absurdities which have sprung from using the
word loosely and without proper discrimination. I shall have to
plead guilty to something very like hair-splitting, but I may put
forward in excuse the undeniable fact that "accuracy does
involve some hair-splitting." If anyone prefers the self-contradictions
and preposterous conclusions to which loose and unanalytic
thought has so often led the unwary, he is welcome to them.
I shall hold a few of these up to inspection after a while. For
my part, I prefer a little quibbling at the outset of a discussion

[6]

to a systematic incoherence all through it, with the chances of
finding myself in a
cul-de-sac
at the end. Whether I am successful
in dissipating to some degree the fog which has hung about
samenesses and obliterated important distinctions, each one must
judge for himself.

The kinds of sameness I find to be as follows:

Sec. 2.
I. We speak of any sensation, feeling, or idea, or
complex of sensations, feelings, or ideas, as being the same with
itself at any one instant. The pain in my finger is what it is at
this moment. The finger itself (the immediate object of knowledge,
a complex from sense and imagination) is, at each moment,
what it is. It is to this sense of the word that the logical laws
of Identity and Contradiction have ultimate reference.

Sec. 3.
II. A sensation, feeling, or idea, or complex of sensations,
feelings, or ideas, considered in itself and without reference
to the world of material things, is called the same with
one previously existent when the two are alike. I say, for
example, that I feel to-day the same pain I felt yesterday, or
that I have dreamt the same dream three times. This is evidently
not sameness of the kind first mentioned.

Sec. 4.
III. We speak of seeing the same material thing at different
times. Suppose a man passing along a country road to look
across a field at a distant tree. What he actually sees is a small
bluish patch of color, which, interpreting in terms furnished by
his previous experience, he supplements with material drawn from
memory and imagination. On the following day he looks at the
tree again from a nearer point and sees a larger green patch of
color with distinct differences of shading and with a clear outline.
This he interprets in a similar manner.

Now, without being a philosopher at all, and without conscious
reference to anything beyond what he has experienced or can
experience, he affirms that he has on two successive days seen

[7]

the same tree. I ask, just what is the significance of the word
same as used in this connection? What peculiar experience has
it been employed to mark? What is perceived on the one occasion
is not the same as what is perceived on the other in the
sense of the word first given (by "perceived" I mean existing in
consciousness as a complex of mental elements. With the supposed
external correlates of our percepts I am not now concerned).
And it is equally clear that two such percepts need
not be the same in the second sense of the word, for they may be
quite unlike. In this case they are unlike, so far at least as what
is actually in sensation is concerned.

What peculiar experience then does the word mark when the
observer declares that he has seen the same tree twice?

We are now in the sphere of material objects (
i. e.
, as experienced;
I refer to the mental content and nothing more), and are
not concerned with our experiences as isolated elements, but as
grouped and arranged in series. Our total possible experience
of any one object is a collection of partly simultaneous and
partly successive actual and possible sensations which condition
each other, and which we regard as a unit. The Idealist
believes that this is all there is of the object, and all we mean
when we commonly employ the word. The Realist assumes
that there is something beyond and corresponding to this experience,
and which is to be regarded as the real thing. He, however,
must admit that all we can know of any object, in whatever
sense we choose to employ that word, all our evidence for
maintaining its existence and determining its qualities, must be
drawn from this group of sensations. It is this that we immediately
know, and anything inferred must be inferred from this.

From this it follows that when any one, whether Realist, or
Idealist, or unreflective man, feels justified in asserting that what
he perceives to-day is the same object he perceived yesterday, he

[8]

is led to make this assertion on the strength of some distinction
in his immediate experience, and he refers only secondarily, if at
all, to anything beyond and external to this. The distinction
which he marks by the word is this: He has reason to believe
that the two percepts in question belong to the one series,—to the
one life history, so to speak. He believes that had he cared to
do so he could have filled up the gap between them by a continuous
series of percepts, each conditioned by the preceding, and
forming the one chain. Each represents to him the one object,
in that each stands for the whole series, and his thought is much
more taken up with the series as a whole than with the individuals
composing it. He knows that the percepts in such a series
can only be successive, never simultaneous. Had he reason to
suspect that the two percepts we are discussing belong to different
series of this kind, and that there is nothing in the nature
of the case to prevent their being simultaneous, he would decide
for two trees.

But each percept contains more than one mental element, and
just as we may regard each percept as representing the whole
series, so we may regard each element as representing the whole
complex which may be experienced at one time, and through this
the whole series of percepts. I say that the orange I smell is
the same with the one I see; that I can reveal by striking a
light the chair I fell over in the dark; that I hear rattling down
the street the coach I stepped out of a few moments ago. It is
not worth while to distinguish this use from the use of the word
same just mentioned, for they agree in making a single experience
stand for a whole group or series, which is assumed to be
at least potentially present with each one. When we have had
two experiences thus representing the one group, we say that we
have in two ways, or on two occasions, experienced the same
object. In this sense has the man in our illustration seen yesterday

[9]

and to-day the same tree. In this sense could he at the one
time see and touch the same tree.

It is in this sense also that we use the word when we say that
the object seen with the naked eye and the object seen through
a telescope or under a microscope are the same. If I look at a
distant object with the naked eye and then look at it through a
telescope, what I actually see (or what is actually in the sense)
is in the two cases very different. But just as seeing an object
from a distance with the naked eye, I may walk towards it and
substitute for the dim and vague percept which I first had a series
of percepts increasing in clearness and ending in one which I
regard as altogether satisfactory, so I may substitute at once this
clear percept for the dim one, by the use of the telescope, and
may know that it properly belongs to the series which, taken as
a whole, constitutes my notion of the object. This I may know
from the relations which this percept bears to the other percepts
of the series, and which allow me to pass in my inferences from
it to them as I can from any one of them to another. If, seeing
a dim object upon the horizon, I raise a telescope and through it
perceive the figure of a man, I know that I could have had a
similar percept without any telescope by simply approaching the
object. Conversely, on perceiving a man near at hand, I know I
could have a similar percept from a distance by looking through
a telescope. I call the man seen through the telescope the same
as the man seen with the naked eye, for the same reason as I call
the man seen by the eye at a distance the same with the man
seen near at hand.

And the apparently non-extended speck which I see with the
naked eye looks very different from the curious insect I see when
I place a microscope over this speck, but I call them the same
for the reason just given. If the insect as seen under the glass
be divided, so is the speck as seen by the eye; if the insect is

[10]

taken away, the speck disappears too. The series of percepts
made possible through the microscope may be regarded as a continuation
of the series which arises from approaching the eye to
the object. Each member in it stands in a relation to this primary
series similar to that illustrated above in the case of the
telescope, and similar to that held by the terms of the primary
series to each other. It should be kept clearly in mind that in
all these cases the object (immediately perceived) is the same
only in the sense pointed out,
i. e.
, two or more percepts, which
may, in themselves considered, be quite unlike each other, are
recognized as in a certain relation to each other, as each representing
the one series to which all belong. If one thinks he has
reason to believe each percept represents not merely the series
of percepts, but something different, which he infers and is
pleased to call the "real" thing, he may be inclined to believe
that in saying he sees the same object on two occasions he is
referring to this something. It must be clear to him, however
that all his evidence for the sameness of this something lies in
the experience I have described, and it is to this that he must
point in proof that it is the same. The percepts themselves are
certainly not the same in any other sense than the one given.
They are not identical, and they need not be alike. They merely
stand for each other. Should one forget this, he will fall into
blunders which I will illustrate at length when I speak of the
common opinion on the subject of the infinite divisibility of
space.

John Locke, in his famous "Essay,"
[1]
has made a distinction
between the sameness of masses of inorganic matter and the
sameness of organisms. That of the former, he says, consists
in the sameness of their particles, while the sameness of a plant
or animal does not consist in that of the particles which compose

[11]

it at this time or at that, for they are in continual flux, but
in the participation in the one life of the organism. It does not,
however, appear to me that we have here a real difference in the
kind of experience marked by the word. The difference is
merely that in the one case we connect this experience, not
with the object as a whole, but with the separate particles which
compose it, which we take as so many separate objects each
having a sameness of the kind just discussed, while in the other
case we look upon the object as a whole, as a unit, and disregard
any reference to its component parts. But whether we regard
the object as a unit or take each of its ultimate parts as separate
objects, we are thinking of the one kind of sameness. We are
thinking of a certain life-history in which any one link may
represent the whole, and any two links may be, from this point
of view, regarded as equivalent. It is not merely with reference
to plants and animals that we speak of sameness without regard
to a sameness of constituent parts. We do it in this case
simply because the organism furnishes us with a convenient
unit, and one much more important as a unit than as an aggregate.
We can make similar units when we please, and consider
their sameness without thinking of their parts. We speak of
the same nation as existing through many generations, and of
the same corporation as surviving many deaths. Whether the
object we are considering be naturally indivisible, or composite
and assumed a unit for convenience, when we speak of it as the
same at two different times we are referring to the one experience.
Locke does make here a distinction worth noticing, but
it does not mark two fundamentally different uses of the word.

Sec. 5.
IV. Two objects are called the same, and two other
mental experiences occurring at the one time are called the
same, from the fact that they are recognized as alike. The
botanist, finding that two plants belong to the one class calls

[12]

them the same without any intention of confounding the two
individuals. Nor does one who places his two hands in warm
water and declares that he has the same feeling in both, confound
the two streams of sensation. The fact that only likeness
is meant is here clearly recognized. It is not, I think, as
clearly recognized when similar sensations or other mental
experiences (considered singly), occurring at
different
times, are
called the same. In that case they are sometimes spoken of as
if they were material objects having a continuous sameness after
the fashion explained above.

Sec. 6.
V. The word same is used to signify the relation between
any mental experience and that which is regarded as its
representative. This representative may or may not resemble it.
We speak, for example, of calling up in memory this or that
object seen at some past time. The memory-image is certainly
not the same with the original percept in Sense I. When we
say that the object of memory is the past, we cannot mean this,
for it is plainly false. Nor is it thought of as merely like it, as
in Sense II. It is thought of as a something which represents
it—stands for it in a peculiar way. Just what this implies I
will not here attempt to discover. It is enough for my purpose
to point out that when we say a man remembers an object we
do not mean merely to indicate the presence in his imagination
of a resembling picture, but to include a certain relation between
this picture and an original percept.

It is not easy to describe what is present in an act of memory.
When I am thinking of another man as calling to mind something
from his past experience, I bring before my own mind two
pictures, one representing his original percept, and one his
present memory-image. Holding these before me together, I
recognize them as related, but distinct. I use the word same to
denote their relation. But the person who is exercising his

[13]

memory does not have before his mind two objects, an original
and a copy, with an observed relation between them. He has
not the original, or it would not be an act of memory. When,
however, he reflects upon his experience as I have done, he represents
it to himself as I have represented it to myself. He
speaks as if, in the act of remembering, he were conscious of
two objects and could compare them. He speaks of recognizing
the memory picture as a copy and representative of the original
percept. Language, as commonly used, adapts itself to this
way of regarding the matter, and I may leave a further analysis
of it to the student of the memory, merely pointing out that,
whatever is implied in the experience, a common use of the word
same is to denote this relation between any mental experience
and the memory-image which represents it.

It will be seen that this kind of sameness may be presupposed
in affirming sameness in other senses of the word. When I
compare a present sensation with one felt some days since, and
affirm that they are the same, the latter must enter into the
comparison through its representative in memory. It is not
itself present at the time of the comparison.

And when I say that I have seen the same tree yesterday and
to-day, I mean, as I have explained, that the two percepts belong
to the one series; but since my experience of yesterday cannot
be itself present in my consciousness to-day, it can take its
place in the series, as thought to-day, only by proxy. When I
say that I have in my mind the same series on two successive
days, I evidently mean that it is the same series in the sense in
which any experience and its representative in memory are the
same.

Other less important instances might be given of this use of
the word same to express the relation between any experience
and its representative. We say that we see an object in a

[14]

mirror, when we mean that we see its reflected image. We
speak of seeing in a picture this man or that. When we have
found for anything a satisfactory substitute we say it is the same
thing. Such uses of the word are not likely to deceive anyone,
and I will not dwell upon them. Their meaning is too plain to
be mistaken.

Sec. 7.
VI. We constantly speak of two men as seeing the
same thing. In this we have a sense of the word which demands
careful analysis. For the sake of clearness, and to avoid
ambiguity, I will confine myself here, as I have done in the foregoing
sections, to an examination of what is actually experienced
by the men, and will defer all consideration of existences
assumed as lying beyond a possible experience in an extra-mental
world, for discussion in sections to follow.

The question which interests me at present is simply this:
What experience is it that leads a man to affirm that he and
someone else are perceiving the same object? The Realist (in
the modern sense) would say that this experience is only his
evidence that he and another are perceiving the same object,
meaning by object what I have referred to as believed to lie
beyond his experience; while the Idealist would say that this
experience exhausts the whole matter. The Realist must, however,
admit, as I have brought out in a different connection, that
all his evidence for the existence of the object (in his sense),
and for any affirmations whatever regarding it, lying within the
field of the immediately known, any words, which have been
coined to express qualities of, or distinctions concerning, this
object, would retain a use and significance as marking distinctions
within this field even if the object were supposed non-existent.
Whether any such duplicate of what is immediately
perceived exists or not is a question apart. Since we admittedly
draw all our distinctions from the field of the immediately

[15]

known and then carry them over to such objects, and not
vice
versa
, we may be sure that we would go on saying that two men
see the same object in any case. I myself give the preference
to that the existence of which is an indubitable fact, and prefer
using the word
object
to indicate the complex in consciousness.
I have, however, no desire to assume any point in dispute by juggling
with a word, and will try to keep clearly in mind the meaning
of the word thus assumed whenever I use it.

Now, the experience which leads me to say that I and another
man see the same object is just this: I perceive a particular
object, and in a certain relation to it I perceive the body of
another man. From a past experience of my own body in relation
to objects and from reasoning by analogy, I have come to
connect such a relation of another body to the object with the
thought of another consciousness of the object as connected
with that body. Just as I perceive my own body to perform certain
actions when I am conscious of perceiving the object, so I
perceive this other body with which I have connected in thought
a consciousness of the object to perform similar acts in response
to similar relations towards the object. It is wholly a matter of
observation in my own case that the perception of my own body
in this or that relation to an object is a
sine qua non
to the perception
of the object. And it is wholly a matter of reasoning
from like to like that leads me to connect in thought sensations
or percepts with any other animal body whatever. When I say,
therefore, that I and another man are perceiving the same thing,
there is in my mind a complex consisting of a percept or idea of
the thing, a percept or idea of the man's body, and the
thought of a percept connected with this body. When I say
that he is thinking of us both as seeing the same thing, I call
up in mind a similar complex and connect it in thought with his
body. Whatever I may believe as to the existence or non-existence

[16]

of things lying beyond this sphere, and supposed to cause
these experiences, these are the experiences to which I ultimately
refer when I speak of two men as seeing the same object,
and these furnish the whole ground for the existence of the
phrase.

The percept of the object which I connect in thought with
the other man's body need not be wholly similar to my percept
of the object. The man who has discovered that he is
color-blind, does not suppose that men not similarly afflicted
see just what he does in looking at a cherry tree full of ripe fruit.
Nevertheless, he still speaks of himself and others as seeing the
same objects. If another man's body is not exactly like mine,
I am not justified by argument from similarity in reading into it
an exactly similar experience. It is not the similarity of the
two percepts that I am thinking of chiefly when I speak of them
as percepts of the same object. I am thinking of the relation
in which I suppose them to stand to each other. I think of the
possible existence of the one under given circumstances as conditioning
the possible existence of the other.

Sec. 8.
VII. When a man in an early stage of reflection upon
his experience has decided that objects immediately perceived are
not the real things but merely their mental copies or representatives,
he may think of these "real" things in several ways. He
may believe in a world of "real" things, consisting of groups of
"real" qualities, external to consciousness; he may accept such
"real" things, but add to them a substratum or substance, distinct
from the qualities; or he may believe that the "real"
exists as mere substratum, substance, or noumenon, and that all
qualities, being merely its revelation to mind, exist within the
circle of consciousness alone. The first position is one not
often taken. The second is that held by Locke,
[2]
who believed

[17]

that, corresponding to our ideas of objects, there exist substances
possessed of certain primary qualities, and having an underlying
substance or substratum. The third represents the view of
the Kantian,
[3]
who, to be consistent, must deny to his noumenon
any qualities whatever. How he is to do this without having it
lapse into utter nothingness is a problem for him to solve.

The disciple of Locke has, therefore, in discussing all the uses
of the word same, to consider the sameness of:

1. Things immediately known.

2. Groups of "real" qualities in an extra-mental world, more
or less like what is immediately known.

3. Substance; the "I know not what" to which Locke clung
through all difficulties.

The man who holds the first of the three views above mentioned
need only consider the first and the second of these; and
the Kantian need only consider the first and the third, rebaptizing
the latter "noumenon" or "thing-in-itself."

Omitting for later consideration the sameness of the self or
ego, I have already discussed the uses of the word same within
the field of the immediately known. It remains to consider the
sameness of what is believed to lie beyond this, and to belong to
a different kind of a world.

When men discuss these supposed realities, in what senses of
the word same may they reasonably think of them as the same?

[18]

When a common, unreflective man, whose mind has not been,
in the words of Bishop Berkeley, "debauched by learning,"
looks at a tree and thinks about it, he believes he sees a real
tree, at a certain real distance from his body, and of a given real
height and figure. It does not occur to him to make any distinction
between the tree immediately perceived, and an inferred
second tree, not immediately perceived, but represented by the
former. There is the tree; he sees it; he can touch it; it seems
to him but one: and he always talks as if there were but one
tree to be discussed in the premises. That one tree, he thinks,
is really extended; is really out in space beyond his body; is, in
short, what it appears to be. To his unreflective mind this tree
does not seem to be a representative or to be seen through a
representative, but to be seen immediately and just where it
really is.

But when a man has begun to battle with the difficulties of
reflection, and has learned to make a distinction between things
and his ideas of the things, he will probably fall into unforeseen
perplexities about this tree. He reflects that, when he closes
his eyes, the tree disappears; that when he approaches it it looks
green, and when he recedes from it it grows blue; that a man
with a peculiar defect in his vision does not see it colored as he
does; that when he makes a pressure on the side of one eyeball
he sees two trees where before he saw only one; that when
he makes such a pressure upon both eyeballs and moves them
about a little he sees two trees moving about, although he knows
real trees can not ordinarily be made to move about so easily.
Such reflections lead him to distinguish between the tree as he
sees it, and the tree as it really is, and he defines the tree as he sees
it as the tree immediately known, and the real tree as the tree
mediately known, a cause of the existence of the former. He
now thinks that he sees directly only copies or representatives

[19]

of real things, and as he believes these copies or representatives
to be in his mind, and usually talks as if his mind were in his
head, or at least in his body, he concludes that things immediately
known must in many instances be much smaller than they
seem, or perhaps lack extension altogether. How can a tree
thirty feet high be in a man's mind? It is true, that, when I
press upon my eyeballs in the manner described, I seem to see
two trees of that size moving; but must it not be a mistake?
Must we not assume that what is immediately seen only
seems

extended, and stands for an extended thing which is grasped
through it? So our philosopher learns to distrust the immediate
object of knowledge; to regard it as in some sense unreal as
compared with what it represents; and to deny to it those properties
which it apparently possesses. It is not extended, but
it stands for extension; it is not colored, but it stands for color;
it is not real, but it stands for reality.

It is natural, however, for one who has gone thus far to go
farther. When he reflects again upon the fact that he sees the
tree of a different color at different distances; when he remembers
that colors vary with the quality of the light by which they
are seen; when he and his neighbor dispute concerning the true
color of the one tree which he sees dotted with red leaves, and
which his opponent claims to see of a uniform color; then he
may well begin to ask himself what is the true color of the "real"
tree, or whether it is certain that it has any color at all? May
not, then, the "real" tree have only some of the qualities that
we ordinarily attribute to trees? Perhaps, the space qualities?

Or, worse yet, since some of the qualities that the ordinary
man attributes to trees may be regarded as existing only in a
shadowy way in our ideas, why may not the same be true of all
the other qualities? How do we know that "real" trees are
extended? How do we know that "real" extension must be

[20]

assumed as the cause of the delusive apparent extension of our
ideas, if it is true that "real" color need not thus be assumed as a
cause of our sensations of color? What if the "real" thing exists
only as an indescribable and incomprehensible somewhat, which
we must assume as a cause of the immediately known, but of
which we can know nothing more? When one has once begun
this slippery descent, it is not easy to say where he may find a
peg to stay him in his course.

Suppose, however, he is content to strip the "real" thing of
what are commonly called the secondary qualities of matter, and
to leave to it what are known as the primary. He will follow
the example of the wholly unreflective man and speak of it in
such a way as to suggest that the thing itself is something apart
from its "real" qualities. A tree, he will say,
has
qualities. It
would certainly sound odd to hear him say it
is
qualities. And
he will very possibly go on to justify the use of the language he
employs by distinguishing between the "real" qualities represented
by his mental picture of the tree and an obscure something
which he assumes as underlying them; thus embracing
the Lockian distinction of ideas, "real" qualities, and substance.
He may conclude, it is true, that substance in this sense of the
word is chimerical, and that the belief in it arises out of a misunderstanding
of the significance of language; but if he has gone
so far as to assume duplicates of things immediately known, in
the form of "real" qualities, it is more probable that he will be
inclined to complete his classes of beings by adding the third.
[4]

Now, it does not concern me to consider whether this change
of view is to be regarded as a real progress in reflective knowledge
or as a progressive decline and fall of the unreflective man.

[21]

The point which concerns me is this: The unreflective man
talks as if but one tree were under discussion. The man who
reflects uses the same forms of speech: and even when he
believes that he must distinguish between the tree immediately
known and the obscure something which he has come to look
upon as its cause, or between the tree immediately known, the
bundle of "real" qualities inferred, and the obscure something
that he connects with these, he still goes on talking as if he had
only one thing to talk about. The danger of such a proceeding
is obvious. If I talk about two or three things as though they
were one, it is but natural that I should sometimes confuse them
with each other. Should proof be forthcoming for one of these,
it would be but natural for me to fall occasionally into the error
of supposing that it somehow applies to the others. If I go on
saying "the tree" when I mean one tree and something else,
two trees, or two trees and something else, it is only to be
expected that I sooner or later come to grief in my reasonings.

And it should be noted that this peculiar ambiguity in the
names of things entails a parallel ambiguity in the use of the
words by which we indicate the mind's recognition of the
presence of things. We commonly speak of a drunken man's

seeing
two trees, where a sober man sees one. We speak of an
insane man as
hearing
voices, when no one has spoken. We say
that we
see
the maples are turning red, even when we believe
that color may not properly be attributed to the mediate object
of knowledge. On the other hand, those who hold to the existence
of "real" objects of the kind before mentioned, generally
maintain that in referring to things in space, their positions and
mutual relations, we are giving attention, not to the immediately
known, but to its "external" double. "I see, feel, perceive,"
it is "said, not the image, and not the constituents of the
image (the ideas), but the external object by
means
of the image."
[5]

[22]

If one holds that this "external" object presupposes a substance,
a something distinct from a group of qualities, there is nothing
to prevent his maintaining, should he wish to do so, that in
saying "I see a tree," primary reference is had to this substance
or "reality." Of course, if, in the sentence "I see a tree," the
word "tree" can have three meanings, it follows that there is
also a possibility of taking in three senses the word "see." It
is hardly necessary to point out that, unless one is very careful,
"seeing" in one sense may result in "believing" in another, as
"kicking" did in the famous case of Dr. Johnson and the stone.
The caution is pertinent with respect to any other word used in
the same general way as we use the word "see."

I have said that when a man abandons his original unreflective
position and learns to distinguish between things immediately
known and other things they are supposed to represent,
he goes on using the common language, and talking as though
there were but one thing under consideration. Now, men do
not do this merely in common conversation and in writing about
matters of everyday life, but they do it in the very books that
have been written to prove that each thing is thus double or
triple. John Locke, for example, begins the very chapter in
which he is about to draw the distinction between the secondary
and primary qualities of bodies (
i. e.
, between the constituents
of things immediately known and the constituents of their
"external" correlates), as well as to enlighten us on our ideas of
substances, with the following words:
[6]

"The mind being, as I have declared, furnished with a great
number of the simple ideas, conveyed in by the senses, as they
are found in exterior things, or by reflexion on its own operations,
takes notice also, that a certain number of these simple
ideas go constantly together; which, being presumed to belong

[23]

to one thing, and words being suited to common apprehensions,
and made use of for quick despatch, are called, so united in one
subject, by one name; which, by inadvertency, we are apt
afterward to talk of, and consider as one simple idea, which
indeed is a complication of many ideas together: because, as I
have said, not imagining how these simple ideas can subsist by
themselves, we accustom ourselves to suppose some
substratum

wherein they do subsist, and from which they do result, and
which therefore we call
substance
."

It is clear enough from this, as it is clear enough from other
passages in the same book, that Locke talked as though the complex
of simple ideas in consciousness were the very same thing
(in Sense I) as the group of "real" qualities outside of consciousness.
And no careful reader of his book can avoid seeing
that the confusion of his language is a fair index to the confusion
of his thoughts with regard to the two.
[7]
It is little better
in the case of "bodies" and substance. In the passage just given,
he would seem to make
substance
an obscure something underlying
groups of ideas, and not groups of real qualities, but in the
next sentence he makes it a substratum of the qualities which
produce in us ideas. In many passages
[8]
he distinguishes between

substance
and
substances
, by which latter he means groups of
"real" qualities with the added substratum or substance; as such
substances he instances oak, elephant, iron. He emphasizes the
fact that substance is not to be confounded with substances,
which are things of different sorts.
[9]
In so far as the substances
are bundles of qualities, they are known to us through sensation.
[10]

In so far as they are also substance, they cannot be known to us
through sensation, for the idea of substance is not known

[24]

through sensation.
[11]
We are not then to look upon substance as
such a constituent part of "a substance" as a quality is. The
two belong to different classes. And if we offer proof for the
existence of "real" substances, which is evidently applicable to
them only as bundles of qualities—proof from sensation—then
substance is overlooked altogether. It is significant that Locke,
having thus put together under one head as "a substance" an
oak viewed as a bundle of "real" qualities and an oak viewed as
substratum, proceeded to argue as if he had but one thing to
prove when he felt called upon to defend the real existence of
substances. In his chapters on "The Extent of Human Knowledge,"
the "Reality of Knowledge," and "Our Knowledge of
the Existence of Other Things,"
[12]
he devotes himself wholly to
proving things as bundles of qualities, and pays no more attention
to substance than if it had never entered his thought. If we
take these chapters as authoritative, we must banish substance
from the sphere of knowledge altogether.

As another instance of a use of language calculated to produce
confusion, I may offer the following from Sir William Hamilton:
"Whatever we know is not known as it is, but only as it seems
to us to be,"
[13]
—a use of words which would certainly indicate
that the immediate and mediate objects of knowledge are one.
And what would we infer from such a sentence as this: "Thus
the consciousness of an Inscrutable Power manifested to us
through all phenomena, has been growing ever clearer; and must
eventually be freed from its imperfections. The certainty that
on the one hand such a Power exists, while on the other hand its
nature transcends intuition and is beyond imagination, is the certainty
towards which intelligence has from the first been progressing."
[14]

[25]

Or this: "We are obliged to regard every phenomenon
as a manifestation of some Power by which we are acted upon;
though Omnipresence is unthinkable, yet, as experience discloses
no bounds to the diffusion of phenomena, we are unable
to think of limits to the presence of this Power; while the criticisms
of Science teach us that this Power is Incomprehensible.
And this consciousness of an Incomprehensible Power, called Omnipresent
from inability to assign its limits, is just that consciousness
on which Religion dwells."
[15]

"After concluding that we cannot know the ultimate nature
of that which is manifested to us, there arise the questions—What
is it that we know? In what sense do we know it?"
[16]
Or
what shall one say to this: "Our consciousness of the unconditioned
being literally the unconditioned consciousness, or raw
material of thought, to which in thinking we give definite forms,
it follows that an ever-present sense of real existence is the very
basis of our intelligence."
[17]

Now, if the consciousness of an "inscrutable power" is not the
"inscrutable power" itself; if the existence of such a "power"
does not mean simply its existence in consciousness; if the
phenomena in which, it is assumed, a "power" is manifested,
are to be kept separate in thought from the "power," so that we
shall be in no danger of confounding a consciousness of certain
phenomena with consciousness of an "incomprehensible power;"
if our "consciousness of the unconditioned" is to be kept in mind
as signifying merely our "unconditioned consciousness," and an
"ever-present sense of real existence" as signifying only an
ever-present sense of "raw material" in consciousness; then it is
high time that these sentences and all such as these be re-written

[26]

with some regard for lucidity, accuracy and consistency. How
can a reader help confounding things when he is thus taught by
the very man whose business it is to distinguish between them?
The blind led by the blind is a cheerful spectacle compared
with this.

Nothing can be more evident than that the man who has abandoned
his original unreflective belief in the singleness of the
perceived object, and has come to believe in it as having one or
more "external" correlates, should keep distinctly in mind that
an immediate and a mediate object are, by hypothesis, two distinct
things: that he has never had any direct experience whatever
save of the one; and that all distinctions that he makes with
regard to the other, the very notions of its existence, reality, and
externality, have been drawn from the sphere of the immediate
and carried over to it in thought. And he should never allow
himself to forget, that, when he says he has passed in thought
from the immediate to the mediate object, he cannot mean literally
that his thought is now occupied directly upon this "external"
thing—that it is itself present to mind. He should
remember that he can only mean that he has such an experience
as the following:

He has in mind the immediate object, and a mental picture of
a duplicate of this standing in a causal relation to it and represented
by it; or, he has (if a Lockian), in addition to these two,
a third highly vague and indefinite mental image (the idea of "substance"),
which he connects with the image just described, as he
has connected that with the immediate object; or (if a Kantian),
he has in mind the immediate object, and, connected directly
with that, such a vague image as has just been described. This
is what he actually has in mind so far as
objects
are concerned.
He does not, however, merely recognize the existence in his mind
of these different images in their relations to each other, but

[27]

he looks upon this mental arrangement as somehow justified by
experience and embodying truth.

When we ask what the word "
justified
" can mean in this connection,
it is not easy to find an answer. Within the sphere of
the immediately known the meaning of the word is plain enough.
When I have constructed in my imagination a certain image or
complex of images embodying a belief as to matter of fact, I say
the mental operation is justified when I can substitute for the
idea the percept which it is supposed to represent, or can know
indirectly that this might be done according to known laws of
the appearance and disappearance of percepts. Thus I perceive
the outside of a tree-trunk and form an idea of what lies under
the bark. I have reason to know that by stripping off the bark
I can substitute for the image I have formed the corresponding
percept. And if I see at a distance a similar tree growing upon
an inaccessible cliff, and form an image of what lies under its
bark, I may still regard this as justified by the possibility of
referring to cases in which a similar image, arising out of a similar
experience, has been found to be justified. It is a legitimate inference
that, if circumstances were somewhat different, the proper
percept might take the place of this image too. It is evident,
however, that the word "justified" cannot be used in this or any
analogous sense in speaking of the relation not of an image to a
percept, but of an image or a percept to a something that, by
hypothesis, cannot itself enter into experience at all. What then
can the word mean? It at first interests us to know that "some
Snarks are Boojums," but our interest lapses when we discover
that we have absolutely no mark by which we may know a Boojum
from anything else.

But I must not be drawn into digressions. The points with
which I am concerned are these:—
First
: When a man says he
sees this tree or that house, he ordinarily speaks as if there were

[28]

but the one object in his thought. If he distinguishes at all
between an immediate and a mediate object, the language that
he uses would not indicate that he does so. And even after men
have entered into lengthy arguments for the purpose of marking
this distinction, and insisting that things are not single as they
seem to the unreflective, they still indulge in this peculiar use of
language, which would imply either that they have forgotten for
the time being their own distinction between the immediate and
the mediate, or that they regard the two as the same in Sense I,
and to be treated as one. Certainly, in their reasonings upon
this subject, men who hold to the two kinds of objects do confound
them with one another, and strengthen their faith in the
two by this misconception, as I shall show later. We have here,
then, what we may call a kind of sameness, or pseudo-sameness,
which deserves investigation, and which one should be careful not
to confound with sameness of other kinds. Whether the word same
is commonly applied in the premises is indifferent to my purpose.
In the remainder of the present section I will consider the relation
between the mental representative and its assumed correlatives.

Second
: If we are to accept not merely the world of objects
immediately known, but also a world or two worlds corresponding
to this, and yet distinct from it, we cannot be sure our list of
samenesses is complete unless we traverse in our search for the
different kinds all the spheres of being in which we believe, and
of which we think we can have some knowledge. In the section
following this one I will try to discover the kinds of sameness
which a believer in "external" things may reasonably attribute
to them within their own sphere. In this there is no question
of the relation of something in one sphere to a correlative something
in another.

For the first point. What is in a man's mind when he is thinking
of his percept as having a "real" object corresponding to it,

[29]

I have shown to be as follows: He has in mind an immediate
object and a duplicate of this, not necessarily altogether like it,
imagined as standing in a causal relation to it and represented by
it. When it occurs to him that this imagined duplicate is itself
an immediate object and not the "real" one, he does as much
for it, and provides it with a similar duplicate. In every case,
when he tries to think of an object immediately perceived as
having a "real" correlate, he simply furnishes it with an imaginary
double in this way. What else is he to do? He is trying
to think of two objects; the "real" object cannot, it is said, be in
the mind; he must then imagine it. If he is a Lockian he will
have in mind the immediate object and two imaginary ones, one
signifying the "real" object as a bundle of qualities, and the
other, a highly vague one, picturing the "substance."

Now, since this is all that can be before the man's mind, any
kind of sameness which concerns the percept and the "real"
thing
must mean to him some relation between the immediate object
and the image or images of which I have spoken
. When this is
realized it is seen that we have here not a new kind of sameness,
a distinct experience, but a kind already discussed. The
relation between the immediate object and the images described
is simply that between representative and thing represented.
This I have already examined within the field of what is recognized
as immediately known. Here, too, it would seem that we
are in the field of the immediately known, since we have to do
with percepts and ideas, but though these images are in this field,
they are here, so to speak, under protest, and their framing is
supposed to be justified
[18]
only by something assumed to be not
in this field. When this something is thought of at all it is
thought of in just the way I have described. This is what thinking
it means. Nevertheless, this duplicate world is assumed to

[30]

be a world apart, and for this reason I have considered the sameness
of percepts and their corresponding "real" objects by itself.
It gives us sameness in sense seventh.

In writing the foregoing I have had in mind chiefly the position
of the Lockian. I need not consider at length that taken by
the Kantian, for what I have said will, with little change, apply
to it also. If I hold to a "noumenon" as corresponding to my
"phenomenon," and yet deny to it all qualities whatsoever, I must,
to retain any appearance of consistency, represent it in my mind
in the very vaguest possible way. Nevertheless, I must represent
it, or I am not thinking of it at all, and I must relate the phenomenon
and this vague representation in the way described.
A true consistency would, of course, make impossible the whole
process, for it would make impossible the giving of any quality at
all to the representation, and the putting any relation between it
and the phenomenon. In so dark a night cats do not merely
turn grey, they disappear. On the other hand, if one is too
liberal with this "noumenon," it palpably ceases to be a "noumenon,"
and degenerates into something very like a "phenomenon."
The illusion must not be lost. Both these conflicting tendencies
may be well illustrated in Mr. Spencer's "Unknowable." If we
really refuse to allow to the consciousness of it "any qualitative
or quantitative expression whatever,"
[19]
our vague image wholly
disappears and there is nothing left in our consciousness but the
"phenomenon." While if we follow the "First Principles" in
coaxing it back into existence by allowing it reality,
[20]
and causality,
[21]

and a freedom from limits,
[22]
and printing its name with a capital
letter,
[23]
as though it were even better than other things—if we
do all this there is danger of the convalescent's becoming too

[31]

robust altogether. The problem has its parallel in the practical
problem of paying wages:—one must not pay too little, or he
loses his laborer; nor too much, or he loses his money. The
thing is to find the happy mean which will keep an object of
thought before a man's mind and yet not make him lose all appearance
of consistency.

But in which ever of the ways mentioned a man thinks of "real"
things, he does what I have described. And when he implies
that the immediately known and the "real" are in some sense
the same, as he does when he talks as if there were but the one
object, or asserts that we do not know things as they are in
themselves but only as they appear to us; he really uses the
word same in the fifth sense that I have given. The fact that
he is using it to indicate the relation between percepts and a
certain class of ideas which he has come to regard as duplicates of
his percepts does not make the use of the word a new one. Whatever
may be the state of affairs outside of his consciousness,
this is all that takes place within it; and the word same, used in
this connection, can mean no more to him than I have said.

Sec. 9.
To avoid needless prolixity I will class together and
very briefly treat of the kinds of sameness which one may
attribute to "external" things. It is not necessary to go at
length into the discussion of these, for since the "external"
world, as it is assumed by those who have faith in it, is, to the
man thinking it, simply a more or less modified duplicate of the
world of things immediately perceived; and since all ground for
attributing to it any determinations at all must be found in that
which is immediately perceived; we may naturally look to find in
it nothing that we have not already found in this immediate
world. How, indeed, could anything else get into it? We cannot
have
in
mind what is by hypothesis
out
of mind. The "real"
world is then, in the mind of the man who thinks it, a world of

[32]

imagined objects, and the world of imagination depends for its
material upon the world of sense. A little reflection will show
that the kinds of sameness of these "realities" are only the
kinds of sameness already discussed duplicated, and assumed to
belong to a new world.

1. An "external" quality or group of qualities may be said to
be the
same
with itself at any one instant. Here we have
Sense I carried over into the field of imagined duplicates.

2. An "external" quality existing at one time may be said to
be the
same
with an "external" quality existing at another time,
to indicate that the two are similar. The same thing may be true
of any group of qualities. Here we have Sense II.

3. The "external" bundle of qualities, which formed for Locke
the knowable element in a thing or "body," may be regarded as
being the
same
at two different times—as having, so to speak, a
life-history. Here one is simply calling up in thought the experience
described under Sense III.

4. Two "external" things (bundles of "real" qualities), or
two "external" qualities, existing at one time, may be called the

same
to mark similarity. Here we have Sense IV.

5. An "external" thing (in the sense just indicated), or an
"external" quality, may be called the
same
with its representative.
If this representative be the immediate object of knowledge,
we have the experience described as Sense VII. If it be
another "external" thing or quality,
e. g.
, an "external" picture
in an "external" mirror, an "external" statue in "external"
marble, etc., we have Sense V.

6. Two men may be said to perceive the
same
"external"
thing. In saying this one simply calls up in mind the complex
described at length under VI, but makes the duplicate, which is,
to him, the thing, stand in the complex in the place of the percept,
this being now regarded as a mere representative.

[33]

7. An "external" thing may be said to be the
same
with its
representative in consciousness or with the substance or noumenon
assumed to underlie it. Here we have Sense VII.

It would seem scarcely necessary to mention this last, since, if
the representative in consciousness can be called the same with
its "real" correlate, it would seem self-evident that the "real"
correlate may be called the same with it. I add it, however, for
the sake of completeness. It should be noted that in this last
kind of sameness we step over the limits of any one class of
being, ideas, things (as bundles of qualities), or substance. The
word is used to denote a relation between something in one class
and a corresponding thing in another class.

In the foregoing I have been considering the sameness of "real"
or "external" things regarded as bundles of qualities. If one ask
concerning the sameness of Locke's "substance," or the "noumenon"
of other writers, I would say that our notions of this must
vary with the kind of being we allow this nebulous entity. Strict
consistency in dealing with a noumenon as sometimes defined
means, of course, its utter collapse. If, however, we keep anything
in mind at all, we must carry over to it at least the first of
the kinds of sameness described. I do not think it would be
hard to show that several other kinds are carried over in despite
of consistency by men who hold to this shadowy something
under one name or another.

As, however, we do not find here any new sense of the word
same, but mere repetition in a new field (if one may call it such),
it seems unnecessary to dwell upon this part of my subject.

I have not discussed at all the sameness of things from the
point of view of an adherent of that Natural Realism which
claims that we know immediately real things and yet holds that
real things are not our perceptions themselves, but something
extra-mental. This view is so incoherent that it is not likely to

[34]

be taken seriously by men who have learned to reflect at all. I
may say, however,
en passant
, that it does not add to the kinds of
sameness I have described: it merely confounds them one with
another, and falls into the inconsequences which naturally result
from so doing.

Sec. 10.
When we come to the question of the sameness of
the Self or Ego we are, if possible, on more debatable ground
than heretofore. The whole subject of our knowledge of the
Self lies as yet, in the opinion of many, very much in the dark.
Without undertaking the task of defining narrowly what this
elusive something is, it would seem that I may safely make concerning
it at least the following assertions:

In using the word self, we may have reference either to what
is immediately known as appearing in the circle of consciousness,
the phenomenon, or to a something supposed to lie beyond this
sphere and to be known only through its representative in
consciousness.

Now this something beyond may be looked at in various ways.
John Locke, in discussing the not-self, made the three-fold
division of idea, bundle of "real" qualities, and substance. He
might with equal reason have distinguished in a similar way
between the self as idea (the immediately known), the self as a
bundle of "real" qualities (not immediately known), and the self
as substance. As a matter of fact, however, he did not put the
not-self and the self upon the same plane. He seemed to think
that we know the self more immediately, and to hold that it
enters consciousness as the bundle of "real" qualities
[24]
which, in
the case of matter, is assumed to lie beyond. The "substance"
of the self, however, he condemns to outer darkness and the
company of material substance. To me there seems no reason,
admitting the right to pass at all beyond the immediately perceived,

[35]

for making the distinction which he does make. And as
one, who has followed him with assent in his treatment of the
not-self, may, with some justice complain of his inconsistency
and refuse to follow him here, I mention the position he might
have taken as well as the position he actually did take with
respect to the self and its existences.

Sec. 11.
The word self may then be regarded as referring
either:

1. To the self as phenomenon, a something immediately perceived,
a part or the whole of our conscious experience;

2. To a complex of "real" qualities beyond and represented
by the self as it appears in consciousness;

3. To the substance of self, or self as noumenon, a vague and
ill-defined something, supposed to be distinct from and to underlie
phenomena or "real" qualities; or

4. To two, or to all, of these taken together.

If the word is used in the last of these senses any inquiry
concerning sameness must split up its complex meaning and treat
separately the different elements included. It remains, then, to
inquire what kinds of sameness we may attribute to the self in
the first three senses given. I will take them in reverse order.

Sec. 12.
With respect to the third sense, which makes it
refer to the "substance" of Locke or the "noumenon" of other
writers: all the difficulties which arise out of the endeavor to
attribute sameness of any kind to any substance or noumenon
obtain here also. But it seems on the surface more glaringly
inconsistent in the adherent of noumena to discriminate between
different kinds as admitting of differences of treatment than it
does for him to suppose them capable of treatment at all.
Things that differ cannot be conceived as differing except in
qualities, and here there is question not of qualities but of
noumena. If one is to retain any appearance of consistency, he

[36]

must not maintain that the word same is applicable in any given
sense to certain noumena and not to others. If he does so, he
openly abandons his noumena to a phenomenal fate. And, as a
matter of fact, I think it is plain that those believers in noumena,
who distinguish them from one another, yet think of them in
just the one way. If we take the utterances of a good representative
of the class, Sir William Hamilton, we may see that
although he distinguishes between the noumenal ego and the
noumenal non-ego, not only do his clearest statements make such
a distinction out of the question, but the distinction drawn is so
vague and insignificant
[25]
that the two noumena may be thought
of and reasoned about in the one way. Phenomena being
abstracted, what was in his mind when he spoke of the one was
probably in no respect different from what was in his mind when
he spoke of the other. In so far, then, as the noumena themselves
are concerned, it would seem that any kind of sameness
which we may predicate of the noumenal not-self we may predicate
on the same ground and with equal justice of the noumenal
self, and
vice versa
. If, however, any sense of the word same
marks a relation between a noumenon and some other thing or
things, and if the two noumena differ as respects this relation,
then this kind of sameness may be attributed to the one and not
to the other. It may be claimed that we indicate just such a
relation in using the word same in Sense VI; and that, whatever
one might do, one would under no circumstances speak of two
men as perceiving the same self, noumenal or any other. I shall
discuss this point when I come to discuss the sameness of self as
phenomenon.

I may add here that when one obliterates the distinction
between noumena by plunging them into the darkness of the
"unknowable," there can, of course, be no question of a new sense

[37]

of the word same in the field I am discussing. On the general
question of noumenal sameness, all that it seems to me necessary
to say I have said before.

Sec. 13.
The second sense of the word self would make it a
complex of "real" qualities beyond, and represented by, the self
as it appears in consciousness. Now, I do not think that the
fact that one would attribute to the self, so considered, one class
of qualities, and to the not-self another class, would, when the
two "real" objects are considered in themselves, prevent one's
ascribing to the former all the kinds of sameness which one may
ascribe to the latter, or would justify the assumption of a new
kind of sameness proper only to the former. In discussing the
sameness of "external" things I have not made any one kind of
it dependent upon the peculiar quality of their qualities, if I may
so speak. I considered them only as groups of qualities in general,
supposed to be external to consciousness. The idea of the
"real" self is in its general character essentially similar to that
of the "real" not-self. Provided that the two classes of qualities
have enough in common to be properly called qualities, and
to be capable of being related to each other in groups, they may
differ in kind
toto cÅlo
without necessitating a difference of
treatment from the point of view with which I am at present
concerned. It is very evident, however, that those who have
thought of the self as a "real" thing, distinct from consciousness,
and yet to be in some way intelligibly represented in
thought, have had a tendency to represent it very much as they
have represented material objects. There has been a general
effort to get rid of the idea of extension, but this has been
shown rather in reducing the size of the object and attributing
to it inconsistent space relations than in denying it such relations
altogether. Bishop Butler's argument for immortality
from the indiscerptibility of the uncompounded shows that he

[38]

thought of the self as he thought of a material atom,
[26]
and Sir
William Hamilton's scholastic notion of the ubiquity of the soul
in the bodily organism—"all in the whole and all in every
part"
[27]
—makes it sufficiently clear that he thought of it so, too;
though, to be sure, such ubiquity would make of it a very queer
atom indeed. If, then, the man, who holds to the self in the
second sense of the word, calls up in using the word a mental
complex like that which represents to him a "real" not-self,
there is all the more reason why we should not expect to find
anything in his thought which would suggest a new kind of
sameness within the sphere of the "real" self. It remains, of
course, to notice here, as in the case of the noumenal self, that
any sense of the word same which has reference not so much to
the things under discussion as to the relations of these things to
other things, may, if self and not-self differ as to these relations,
be applicable to the one and not to the other. Thus Sense VI
may be regarded as inapplicable to the "real" self. I will discuss
this point more fully in a few moments. With this one exception
we may, therefore, I think, apply the kinds of sameness
enumerated under Sec. 9 as obtaining in the sphere of "external"
things to the "real" self also, and it would seem that no new
kinds are to be added. It is unnecessary to repeat here the
classification already given.

Sec. 14.
We come finally to the self as a something immediately
perceived, the self as phenomenon or idea. I do not mean
to use these names in a question-begging way, and I will try to
exhaust all reasonable possibilities in discussing it and its samenesses.

Now, whatever the self is, it would seem that it must be, in

[39]

so far as it is a thing immediately known, either a part or the
whole of consciousness, or one or the other of these regarded in
some peculiar aspect or relation.

If it be a part of consciousness, recognized as distinct from
another part, the non-ego, we may reasonably maintain:

1. That the perceived self is at any moment what it is—is
the same with itself. The question whether it be simple and
unanalyzable does not affect the problem. This is sameness in
sense I.

2. That if it be simple and unanalyzable, this simple element
of consciousness may be the same at two different times, and if
complex, two elements or two complexes of elements, belonging
to different times may be the same. This is sameness in sense II.

3. That if we regard the self as an object having a life-history,
as consisting of successive elements united in a series as sense
elements are united in the series which is for us a material object
(immediately known), we may speak of its being the same on
two successive days, even though it exhibit dissimilar qualities,
primary reference being had not to likeness of elements, but to
the experience which has been described at length in discussing
sense III.

4. That we may speak of two selves, of two elements of two
selves (if selves be complex), or of two elements of one self (if
one self may contain two such elements), as at any one time the
same, to indicate that they are similar. This is sameness in
sense IV. It should be kept in mind, however, that we never
look upon one consciousness as containing two selves as it contains
one self, or as it may contain two material objects (immediately
known). The second self in mind is recognized as present
only as an imagined object. Nevertheless it would seem quite
proper to use the word same to mark this relation of similarity
between the perceived self and an imagined self, just as we use

[40]

it to mark a likeness of two material objects, or of one material
object and the memory image of such an object.

5. That we may speak of the self and its representative as the
same. The memory image of a later time may stand for the
self as experienced at an earlier. Unless it be claimed that yesterday's
consciousness of self is actually to-day's consciousness,
one must admit that the self remembered is the self known
through its proxy. And one may in his reasonings about the
self use as a symbol the pronoun "I," paying little attention as
he goes along to what it stands for, and yet knowing it may
serve in place of the obscure something it represents. These are
instances of sameness in sense V.

6. That we never use the word same in sense VI in speaking
of the self as we do in speaking of the not-self. We do not say
two men perceive the same self as we say they perceive the same
tree or house. The familiar distinction between the subjective
and the objective marks out the latter as in a sense, peculiar to
itself, common and impersonal.

I have already shown what we have in mind when we say two
men see the same material thing. We have a picture of the
thing, and of the bodies of the two men in a certain relation to
it; and we imagine a copy of the thing as in some way connected
with each of these bodies, and due to its relation to the thing.
When relations to a material object are in question all the bodies
in a consciousness are on a par. We may directly perceive the
one thing and two or more bodies holding similar relations to it.
But it is not so in the case of selves. The one self that we find
in each consciousness seems to be peculiarly related to one body
to the exclusion of others. And as we have not, in the case of
this self, the conditions which led us to mark the similar relations
of two human bodies (our representatives of the men) to one
material object, by saying two men see the same thing, we, of

[41]

course, do not say that two men see the same self. The word
same, in sense VI, we may regard, then, as inapplicable to the
self as immediately known.
[28]
This appears to be due, however,
not to the nature of this self in itself considered, but to its
peculiar relation to the other things in a consciousness.

Moreover, since the other two selves, the self as group of
"real" qualities and the self as noumenon, are to us, as it were,
shadows cast by the self immediately known—assumed to exist
only because this is known to exist, and thought of as "present"
only because this is known to be present—since, I say, these
two selves hold in our thought this peculiar relation of dependence
upon the self in consciousness, it is to be expected that we
never find any one speaking of two men as seeing the same
"real" self as one might readily speak of two men as seeing the
same "real" tree. One says he has evidence that two men see
the same "real" tree, when he has or can have in consciousness
an immediately perceived tree and two immediately perceived
human bodies in a certain relation to it. If no one had
ever had this experience in the sphere of the immediately
known, we have no reason to think any one would ever have
thought of applying the phrase in question to a tree mediately
known. And as we do not have a similar experience touching
the self in consciousness, it is only natural to find that no one
applies the phrase to any self out of consciousness. When
things differ their shadows ought to differ too. Sameness in
sense VI we may regard, then, as not attributable to self in any
of the three senses of the word.

7. That, finally, there seems no more reason why one should
not call the self as immediately known the same with the self as

[42]

"external" thing, or with the self as noumenon, than the not-self
as similarly perceived the same with the not-self as similarly
inferred. The supposed relationships are in the two cases exactly
alike. Here we have sameness in sense VII.

Sec. 15.
If we claim that by the self as immediately known
we understand not a part but the whole of consciousness, we
should seem, unless we in some way modify our statement, to obliterate
the distinction between self and not-self. Still, taking
the words simply, and assuming that we mean by self all that is
immediately known, we do not find that this will necessitate any
important difference in the discussion of its samenesses. Consciousness
as a whole is certainly what it is, or the same with
itself, at any instant: two elements in it belonging to different
times, or two complexes of elements belonging to different times
may be the same, as being alike; it may be regarded as having
a life history, and may from this point of view be called the
same at different times without regard to similarity; two simultaneous
elements or complexes of elements in it may be called
the same to mark the fact that they resemble each other, or it,
as a whole, may for the same reason be called the same with
another consciousness (imagined); it and its representative (for
example, the memory-image of its former self), may be called the
same; and we may use the word same to indicate its relation to
its supposed "real" correlate in an extra-consciousness world,
whether we make this "thing" or "noumenon."

It will be observed that in the preceding I have allowed the
self, considered as the whole of consciousness, all the kinds of
sameness upon my list except the sixth. There is, however, no
objection, except that arising from oddity of expression, against
allowing it this kind of sameness too. If we really mean by the
self the whole of consciousness, then everything immediately
perceived is a part of the self. If then, it is proper to say two

[43]

men see the same tree, one may go on to say, if one choses, that
two men see a part of the one self. Such an expression could,
of course, be used only in speaking of the objective part of this
self, the part which those who distinguish between ego and non-ego
call the not-self. It is needless to say that no one ever
thinks of talking in this way. I merely mention the point for
the sake of completeness in my analysis.

Sec. 16.
If by the self we do not understand a part or the
whole of consciousness taken simply, but the one or the other of
these regarded from some peculiar point of view, does it affect
the question of the kinds of sameness we may attribute to it?
It may be asserted, for example, that when we are thinking of
the world of things immediately perceived as conditioned by its
relation to a particular organism (also immediately perceived)—as
duplicated by a pressure on the eyes, as annihilated by a blow
on the head—we make these things mental, and properly include
them under the head of self; whereas, when we abstract these
same things in thought from the organism, and, so to speak,
objectify them, we properly include them under the head of not-self.
We are thus to regard the one thing as an element of the
self or of the not-self, according to the light in which it is viewed.
But it does not seem to me that if we take the word self in the
sense just described, or in any analogous sense, we need alter the
list of samenesses already given. We are still considering a part
or the whole of consciousness, and the fact that we are viewing
it in one light rather than another would not apparently influence
in any way its kinds of sameness.

Sec. 17.
This would certainly appear to be the case if we take
the words
part
and
whole
of consciousness in their common acceptation,
as denoting a portion or the totality of mental elements
(sensations, feelings, volitions, ideas), in their various relations to
each other. It remains, however, to consider a position, which,

[44]

it may be claimed, is not covered by the foregoing classification
of possible positions, when the words "part" and "whole" are
thus understood. Suppose that one distinguishes in the Kantian
fashion between the
form
and the
matter
of what appears in consciousness,
and maintains that the formal element, the arrangement,
or "unity" of consciousness is to be attributed to mind,
or, if you please, is mind, and for "mind" I may here write "self,"
while the matter or content, the raw material to be elaborated
and related, is to be distinguished from this as a thing apart.
Can it be shown that the above given kinds of sameness have
significance in regard to the self so understood? Whether we
call this a
part
of consciousness or not will depend on our use
of terms. It is not a part, as commonly understood, nor is it the
whole of consciousness.

Now, it has seemed to me that those who have laid most emphasis
upon this formal element in consciousness have been very
vague in their treatment of it. On the part of many writers
there is little evidence of even an attempt at scientific exactitude.
And yet it does not appear that the subject admits of
treatment only in this loose and unsatisfactory way. If we can
discuss it at all, there seems no reason why, with increasing
knowledge, we may not expect to discuss it with accuracy and
precision.

If we consider this formal element of consciousness in a concrete
instance, it may help us to classify our ideas concerning
it. Let us imagine three points in such relations to each other
that when each is connected with the other two by straight lines
we have an equilateral triangle. The three points are, of
course, what they are at any instant. And whatever a relation
may be, if the mutual relations of these three points are capable
of being considered apart from the points, as a distinct
element in consciousness, there appears no reason why we should

[45]

not assert with equal justice that these relations are what they
are at any instant. When we take note of the points we take
note of the relations, and we do not confound the one with the
other.

And just as I may say that such a set of three points imagined
or observed now is the same with another and a similar set
imagined or observed at some former time, meaning by
the word same to indicate similarity, and not sameness in the
strict sense mentioned just above; so there appears no reason at
all why I may not say that the mutual relations of the one set of
points are the same with the mutual relations of the other, making
here, too, the distinction between sameness in the former, stricter,
sense, and sameness in this second sense of similarity. If what
is contained in a consciousness at any one instant, is,
ipso facto
, to
be distinguished from what is contained in it at any other instant,
there seems equal reason for making this distinction in the material
element and in the formal. It is quite true that men are not
accustomed to carrying this distinction into the region of form.
The whole history of the dispute as to universals is evidence of
the way in which men have confounded the kinds of sameness;
but I fancy that even those who would clearly recognize that red
color imagined yesterday and red color imagined to-day are the
same merely in being similar, or in standing in a relation of original
and representative, would yet not think of distinguishing
triangularity noticed yesterday from triangularity noticed to-day,
and marking that they are not the same in the first and strictest
sense of the word. And yet it would be hard to show why two
indistinguishably similar color sensations, existing in consciousness
at different times, are to be kept apart in thought and
recognized as two sensations, while two occurrences of the consciousness
of triangularity (I use the clumsy phrase to avoid any
question-begging word), are not to be distinguished as separate

[46]

in a similar way. To say that the formal element is not a thing,
but an activity, does not alter the position. If an activity is
enough of a thing to be talked about and distinguished from
other things, we may surely recognize an activity in consciousness
yesterday as numerically different from an activity in consciousness
to-day.

Furthermore, if, instead of taking as simple an instance of form
as the relations of the three points I have been discussing, I
choose to take the sum total of the relations between the material
elements (here I use
material
as correlative to
formal
), which
go to make up the life history of a material object, say a tree,
why may I not speak of the formal tree as being the same at two
times, meaning thereby that the group of relations co-existent
at any one time may be regarded as representative of any other
group belonging to the one series or of the whole series? To be
sure, I am not justified by common usage in thus speaking, since
common usage marks only distinctions which are practically important,
and by the words "the same tree" includes both form
and matter. Nevertheless, I can see no reason why, if this element
of form does admit of being considered apart, it is not
at least possible to find in this field the kind of sameness we have
in mind when we say that we have seen on two successive days
the same tree.

Again, if I can speak of two simultaneous sensations of redness
in one consciousness (
e. g.
, the two halves of a red surface),
as the same, meaning to indicate simply similarity, why may I
not also speak of two simultaneous "experiences of triangularity"
in one consciousness as the same, and keep clearly in
mind here, too, that I mean only to indicate similarity? If I can
speak of a sensation or a complex of sensations in one consciousness
as the same with a similar sensation or group of sensations
in another, and yet not forget that I am dealing with two things,

[47]

why may I not do as much for two similar relations or groups of
relations in two consciousnesses? If in the one case I do not
confound sameness in the sense of similarity with sameness of
the kind we mean when we say each thing is at each instant the
same with itself, why should I do so in the other case? If, I
repeat, the formal element in consciousness is enough of a thing
to be distinguished from the material element and discussed,
there appears no reason why it should not be open to distinctions
of this kind.

And when I call up in memory a triangle once seen, the memory
image would seem to stand as a representative of the original
in both its elements, form and matter. In neither should
the representative be confounded with the original. If we may
use the word same to indicate this peculiar relation of representation
between two things yet recognized as two, it would seem
only just to allow this distinction as much in the case of triangularity
as in the case of redness or blueness.

As to the sixth kind of sameness. May we grant this to the
self, if by self we mean the formal element of consciousness? I
have said a little way back, before taking up the distinction of
formal and material, that, if we make the word self cover all
the immediately known, there is nothing to prevent one's saying
that two men see a part of the same self, for material objects
(immediately known) would have to be regarded as such parts.
And here it is evident that if we make self to cover the whole of
the formal element in a consciousness, it of course includes the
formal element in what we may call the objective side of consciousness—the
side which is, in some sense of the words, common
and impersonal. Now, we do say that two men see the
same tree, and by tree, the man who distinguishes between form
and matter means a certain complex containing both formal and
material elements. These elements he believes he can distinguish

[48]

from one another, and pay attention predominantly now
to the one, and now to the other. Does it not seem to follow
that a man may as truly be said to see the formal element as
the material, and that two men who see the same tree may with
justice be said to see the same shape or arrangement of parts?
In other words, may we not apply the sixth sense of the word
same to the formal element in
consciousness
if this element is
a thing capable of treatment at all? And if this formal element
in a tree seen by two men is a part of the self, why may we not
say that two men see a part of the same self, even though we
make self mere form? It would sound very odd to say so, of
course, but that should not weigh with a philosopher, if consistency
require it.

Finally, if I may call an immediately perceived object the same
with its supposed "external" correlate, not confounding the
two, but merely marking by the word a peculiar instance of the
representative relation, why may I not, if I believe that "external"
things stand in "real" relations to each other truly represented
by our perceptions of things and their relations—why,
in this case, may I not speak of the relations, "external" and
"internal," as the same, without on that account forgetting that
I am pointing out a relation between two things (if I may thus
speak of relations), numerically different? Are they not as different
as the "matter" of consciousness and its correlate in the
"outer" world?

Sec. 18.
In the foregoing I have endeavored to make my list
of the kinds of sameness complete. I can think of nothing
that has been overlooked; but as I have been trying to force a
path through a thicket few have made any sustained effort to
penetrate, it is quite possible my map of the ground may need
emendation. I shall be very glad of any criticism which will
help me to improve it. And as the many divisions made, and the

[49]

many distinctions drawn, may very possibly tend to produce in
one who has followed the discussion thus far, a state of mind
akin to that of the "true-begotten" Gobbo, when he was obligingly
directed to the Jew's house by his hopeful son, a short
summary of the results obtained may serve to facilitate apprehension
and intelligent criticism.

What has been done is this:

I began by considering the kinds of sameness of things immediately
known, leaving out of consideration for the time being
the sameness of the self or ego. This resulted in the following
kinds:

I. Any mental element or complex of mental elements may be
said to be the same with itself at any instant.

II. Any mental element or complex of mental elements in existence
at one time may be called the same with a mental element
or complex of mental elements existing at another time, to indicate
that the two are similar.

III. We may say that we perceive the same object (complex
of mental elements) at two different times, when we do not
mean that what is actually experienced on the two occasions is
the same in either of the preceding senses; but only that the
two experiences are terms in a certain series, the whole of which
may be regarded as represented by any part. In this sense does
one see the same tree on two succeeding days.

IV. Any two mental elements or complexes of mental elements
in consciousness at the one time may be called the same
to mark the fact that they are alike.

V. Any mental element or complex of mental elements may
be called the same with its representative, whether this representative
resemble it or not.

VI. When a man has learned from experience of his own body
(as a thing immediately known) that a consciousness of his body

[50]

in a certain peculiar relation to a given object (complex of mental
elements) is a presupposition to a consciousness of the object,
and wishes to mark the fact that he is perceiving or imagining
two human bodies in this relation to a single object, and connecting
in thought with each of them a picture of the object, he
may say that he is perceiving or imagining two men seeing the
same object. This sense of the word same obviously expresses
quite a complex thought.

VII. In addition to these kinds of sameness found within the
sphere of the immediately known, we obtain one kind by stepping
beyond it, which, since we step beyond it, so to speak,
with only one foot, may be here mentioned as belonging at least
partially to the world of immediate objects. When we have
come to believe that things in consciousness have their correlates
in a world outside of consciousness, we may speak of the things
in consciousness as the same with their "external" correlates;
or, at any rate, we may talk of them as if they were the same in
some sense of the word which will allow us to include the two
(or three) distinct things under one name, and treat them as one.
This is constantly done. The importance of remembering that
we have really more than one thing to consider, it would seem
scarcely necessary to emphasize. How far this is really a new
kind of sameness I discussed at some length.

After having marked these seven kinds of sameness as having
to do with the immediately known, I proceeded to consider the
kinds of sameness which may obtain in a world or worlds beyond
consciousness. It was pointed out that one may look upon the
"external" in three ways. One may believe in "external"
things as merely bundles of "real" qualities, and may stop
there: or one may believe in such bundles of "real" qualities,
and in addition hold to "substance" or "substratum" as an
obscure something implied by these "real" qualities: or, lastly,

[51]

one may hold that the only correlate of the thing in consciousness
is "noumenon," a thing not distinguishable from the
"substance" above mentioned.

It was then shown that a realm of "external" things, consisting
of bundles of "real" qualities in a world beyond consciousness,
would, since it is to the man thinking it merely a duplicate of the
immediate world, admit of the existence of all the kinds of sameness
above enumerated, and would not furnish any one kind which
might increase the list. And with respect to the "external" as
noumenon, it was stated that if the noumenal be represented to the
mind at all, at least the first kind of sameness must be attributed
to it, and that other kinds will be, in proportion to the
degree of clearness allowed this vague and inconsistent entity.
No new kind of sameness need, however, be looked for in this
field. If one hold to the "external" in both kinds, he must, of
course, search three distinct realms of being before he can be
sure that he has not overlooked any legitimate sense of the word
same. As a result of the foregoing analysis we may maintain
that, whatever be his belief as to ideas, things, and noumena, his
search will not result in more than the seven kinds of sameness
I have given. In the assumed new fields we find mere repetition.
The pure Idealist would reduce the list to six by dropping off
the seventh kind altogether.

Next, as to the sameness of the Self or Ego. It was pointed
out that one may take the word self to mean: (1) the self in
consciousness, or as phenomenon; (2) the self as bundle of
"real" qualities out of consciousness; (3) the self as "substance"
or "noumenon;" (4) two of these, or all of these,
taken together.

It was said that as the fourth sense is sufficiently discussed in
examining the first three, it would not be separately considered.
The three remaining senses were then taken up in reverse order.

[52]

The third and the Second were found to furnish no new kind of
sameness, and to be on a par with the corresponding senses of
the word "not-self," except as touching the sixth kind of sameness.
As respects this, it was admitted that no one would speak
of two men as perceiving the same self, whether as bundle of
"real" qualities or as noumenon. It was remarked, however,
that this is due not to a difference in the self and not-self in
themselves considered, but to a difference in their relation to
other things in a consciousness.

The self in consciousness, or as immediately known, was then
discussed. It was stated that we may safely assume this to be
either a part or the whole of consciousness, or the one or the
other of these in some peculiar aspect or relation. Self, viewed
as a part of consciousness, was found to furnish no new kind of
sameness, and was found to admit of all the kinds discovered
except the sixth; this one being inadmissible from the fact that
when we make the self a part of consciousness we always make
it the subjective part and not the objective. Self, viewed as the
whole of consciousness, was likewise found to furnish no new
kind of sameness, and it was found to admit of all the seven
kinds discovered—even of the sixth, though in a modified way,
since this kind can belong only to a part of the self, the objective
part, which is in some sense common and impersonal. It
may, to be sure, be objected that it would be contrary to common
usage to speak of two men as seeing the same self in any sense
of that word; but in making the self the whole of consciousness
one has already abandoned the common standpoint, and one
may as well be consistent in carrying out the consequences.
Assuming the self to be not a part or the whole of consciousness
simply, but regarded in some peculiar aspect or relation,
was not found to be significant as concerns kinds of sameness.

[53]

It still remained to consider a possible position; that of the
man who distinguishes between the formal and the material
element in consciousness, and identifies self or mind with the
former. The formal element of consciousness is not a part of
consciousness as the word part is commonly used, nor is it the
whole of consciousness, in the ordinary acceptation of the word
whole. And though this view might very well have been brought
under a former head by stretching a little the meaning of the
word part, yet such is its importance that I chose rather to omit
it when discussing self as a part of consciousness (there using
the word part in a limited sense), and to take it up later by
itself.

It was insisted that if the formal element in consciousness is
enough of a thing to be distinguished from something else, and
to be discussed, it is enough of a thing to admit of distinctions
and differences much as other things do. After examination it
appeared, as a matter of fact, that there is no reason why the
believer in "form" should not attribute to it all of the seven
kinds of sameness before described—even (in the modified way
described a moment ago) the sixth kind. And it also appeared
that no new kind of sameness is discoverable in this field.
With this closed the search for samenesses.

It will be observed that we have passed in review the self and
the not-self as immediately known, the self and the not-self as
bundles of "real" qualities out of consciousness, and the self
and the not-self as noumenon or substance. I know of no other
field in which the search may be prosecuted, unless such be
invented gratuitously by increasing the "layers" of being in a
way no one seems inclined to increase them. And in view of
the fact that the samenesses found in any "layer" below the
first seem to be only repetitions of what we find in that one, we
could have no reason to hope that any such needless increase in

[54]

strata could add a single new kind of sameness to those
described.

Sec. 19.
Now that we have obtained a list of the different
kinds of sameness, we may pass our eye over it with a view to
discovering what the various kinds have in common, and what is
the reason that we express such diverse experiences by the use
of the one word. Such an examination reveals the fact that the
common notion which unites them is the idea of similarity. In
some cases this notion lies more in the foreground than in
others, but in all cases it is present, and forms the bond of
union. I will run through the list and point this out, beginning,
however, with the second kind, and reserving the first for discussion
after the others.

II. A mere mention of the second kind of sameness is, in
this connection, sufficient. Two mental experiences are there
avowedly called the same to mark similarity.

III. When we speak of the same object as perceived on two
occasions, we do not, as has been noticed, mean that what is
actually in the sense at the two different times is similar.
Nevertheless, we find here, too, the notion of similarity, for the
two experiences are not considered merely in themselves, but as
elements in a group or series, and as each representing the
whole series. When, therefore, we have the two experiences,
we regard ourselves as having in them two experiences of the
one series; which means, to be more explicit, that we have in
mind on the two occasions two complexes which are similar, and
which, when thought of together, are related to each other as
the memory image and its original are related. Here the likeness
lies in what is represented, not in the representatives.

IV. As in the second kind of sameness, so in the fourth, the
reference to similarity is unmistakable. We call qualities or
things the same when they are of the one kind, when they are
observed to resemble each other.

[55]

V. The relation of representative and thing represented evidently
implies the notion of similarity. It is quite true that we
often recognize as in this relation things that we do not think of
as being similar at all, and yet a little reflection will show that
one thing can stand for another only
in so far
as it resembles it.
The resemblance may lie in the qualities of the things in themselves
considered, or it may lie in external relations of which the
things are capable, or functions which they may serve. The very
notion of a proxy is a something which, for the purpose in hand,
may be regarded as capable of assuming the functions of another.
In so far as it can do this it is like the other. Things wholly
different (if things could be wholly different) could not represent
each other.

VI. When a man thinks of two other men as perceiving the
same object, he must recognize, if he reflect, that he has in
mind a picture of the object, of two human bodies in a peculiar
relation to it, and two images of the object somehow connected
with these bodies. He need not think of these images as wholly
resembling his picture of the object or each other. He does,
indeed, make them more or less like his picture of the object, but
what is prominent in his mind is the thought of them as representatives,
as related to and giving information concerning the
object. I say concerning the object, but this phrase is ambiguous.
If the man under discussion believes in "real" objects
in an extra-consciousness world, he will look upon the
images as representing such a "real" object; though, of course,
his guarantee for this "real" object, and all his information concerning,
it must be found in his picture of the object, and this,
or its copy, will stand for the "real" object in any mental complex
he may construct. If the man be an Idealist, accepting only
what can be found in a
consciousness
, he will look upon the two
images as related to his picture of the object and representative

[56]

of that. In any case he must regard them as representatives, and
in this sense the same with the thing they represent. The notion
of similarity which is at the bottom of this idea of representative
and thing represented is then implied in sameness of the
sixth kind also.

VII. And since those who distinguish between the immediate
and the mediate objects of knowledge make the former representative
of the latter, we have evidently this implied notion of
similarity in the seventh kind of sameness as well as in the
sixth. The mediate object is said to be known
through
the
immediate: that is, the qualities and relations of the one are
made to stand for and serve in place of the qualities and relations
of the other. This they can do, of course, only in so far as
the two sets of qualities and relations are similar. It is easy
enough to see that this notion of similarity is present when we
think of an idea or complex of ideas as representing a "real"
thing beyond consciousness, and giving information concerning
it. When, however, we sublimate our "real" thing into a noumenon
and strip it of the determinations which, taken together,
make up our idea of a thing, we destroy, if we are consistent
and thorough-going, all notion of similarity between the two;
but in doing this we destroy our noumenon altogether. If, for
instance, we refuse to allow to our notion of a thing "any qualitative
or quantitative expression whatever," we cannot think of
the thing as having reality or existence, or any mark by which it
is to be distinguished from nothing at all. In this case the idea
is no longer representative, for it has nothing to represent. If,
on the other hand, we do not wholly destroy the noumenon, but
still allow it a diluted existence of an indefinite kind, in so far as
it has this, and can be represented in mind at all, it resembles
the idea, and just so far may the idea stand as its representative.

[57]

I have already pointed out that several of those who pin their
faith to "external" realities seem to apprehend at times but
dimly, if at all, that the relation of phenomenon and noumenon,
or of idea and "real" thing, is that of representative and thing
represented, and that we have here two things and not one.
Certainly they sometimes pass from one to the other without
rhyme or reason, and apparently in complete unconsciousness of
the fact that they have made any change at all. If, for the time
being, they really take the two for one, they are not thinking of
the seventh kind of sameness, but of another kind. As this is
done through mere inadvertence and looseness of reasoning, and
cannot be justified on their own assumptions, it is not worth
while to dwell upon it farther. Where one really has in mind
the seventh kind of sameness, the elements I have mentioned
will be found in it.

I. Finally, we come to the perplexing case that I postponed at
the outset. What has sameness of the first kind in common with
the rest? How can we speak of similarity when strictly one
thing is in question? Not one thing in the loose sense in which
we call a material object one thing in its successive states, nor
one in the sense in which the memory image and its original are
one, but one thing as a single element of knowledge is itself at
any one instant? How can the idea of likeness hold here? Dundreary's
bird flocking all by itself would seem to have found its
philosophical prototype.

It may be said that though the thing in question is strictly
one, yet we divide it from itself in thought and then affirm it of
itself. We give expression to the logical law of identity by
saying that x is x. But here the difficulty meets us that, if we
are really talking about only the one x, we have said quite all we
have to say in merely saying x; while if, to complete our thought,
we must add the second x, we have not an identical proposition,

[58]

in any strict sense of the word, but a synthetic one. It is easy
enough in words to divide a "thing" from "itself," since the
words "thing" and "itself" are two, and may readily be distinguished.
In the same way it is easy in words to affirm a thing
to be and not to be at the one time. There is no law to prevent
one's stringing sounds together as he may please. But if one is
interested not in the mere symbols, but in that which they are
supposed to represent, one must see that the expression "x is x,"
to be a significant proposition, must have a subject and a predicate,
and affirm a relation between them. Here we have, by
hypothesis, strictly one thing for subject and predicate. The
proposition "x is x" must then consist of one thing and a relation
between it—which is about as significant as the statement that
a door may consist of one side and a relation between it. Between
what? One side.
[29]
Every form of proposition employed
to give expression to the law of identity implies this difficulty.
Whether we say "x is x," or "whatever is is," or "everything is
identical with itself," our proposition, taken literally, is either
useless (since we have said all we have to say in mentioning the
subject alone), or untrue (since we add a new element in adding
the predicate).

[59]

It is then sufficiently evident that the forms used to express
the logical law of identity do not, taken strictly, express at all
the kind of sameness with which we are now concerned, but, on
the contrary, something very different. We are considering a
sameness in which there is no duality whatever, but our expressions
would seem to have no meaning except as indicating a relation
between two. They are then significant, not as
expressing

sameness of the first kind, but as
suggesting
it, and this they certainly
serve to do. The reason for this I shall try to give in a
moment.

It has been said that in the other kinds of sameness we always
find the notion of similarity. When, however, we distinguish
two things as two and yet recognize them as similar, we must
have what I may call a mixed experience of likeness and unlikeness.
In any two things compared, the degrees of likeness and
unlikeness may vary, and we may fix attention upon similarities
or differences. In proportion to the attention given to dissimilar
elements will the two objects be clearly distinguished from
each other and discriminated as two. If the purpose in hand
does not require a careful attention to differences, and if what is
prominent in mind is the likeness of the two objects, the sense
of duality may fall into the background, and the man pass readily
from one object to the other with little consciousness that he has
made a change. As I now look at the two ink-stands on my
desk, I clearly recognize them as two and yet as of the one kind.
Here I am as distinctly aware that they are two as I am that
they are in some respects the same. But in some of the kinds
of sameness I have described this sense of duality falls more into
the shade. When I speak of seeing the same ink-stand twice,
or when I call up in memory an ink-stand once seen, I am likely,
unless I take particular pains to reflect upon my mental operation,
to have but a dim realization of the fact that I have two

[60]

distinct things to deal with. How those who distinguish
between the immediate and the mediate objects of knowledge
have a tendency to forget their distinction, and to pass
unconsciously from one to the other, I have dwelt upon
sufficiently.

Suppose, now, that from two objects which we recognize as
similar and yet distinct, we abstract one by one the elements
which differ. So long as there is any difference left, we still
have "identity in diversity"—similarity in the ordinary sense of
the term, which implies a recognition of two things as two.
When, however, the last difference disappears, all sense of
duality must disappear with it, for any division or distinction
within what remains is inadmissible. Things which are distinguished
are distinguished through some difference. A sense of
duality implies a discrimination between two, and where it is
impossible to discriminate duality vanishes. Similarity, as we
commonly use the word, must then disappear with the disappearance
of all dissimilarity between two objects. I say "between
two objects" in default of a better expression, for, of course, we
have at this point no longer two objects. My meaning is, however,
sufficiently plain. A sense of duality implies difference,
and similarity, as commonly understood, implies duality. The
similarity will then take itself off with the last difference.

It may be objected that
a consciousness of duality
and
a consciousness
of similarity
are only possible on the ground that I
mention, but that duality and similarity themselves may really
obtain when no difference between two is perceptible. But a
moment's reflection will make it plain that one who speaks thus
is simply supplying in himself the elements that he is supposing
absent in the case of another. If he uses the words "duality"
and "similarity," and they really mean anything to him, they
imply all that I have said. He cannot represent to himself two

[61]

things at all without distinguishing them from each other, and
he can not distinguish them from each other unless they differ
in some way. If, then, he speak of two things as being two and
yet completely indistinguishable, he is, taken literally, talking
nonsense. He may, of course, mean the misleading phrase to
be understood as indicating something not actually expressed by
the words. He may mean to point out that, under certain
circumstances, in which he has an experience which he calls
a recognition of two objects as two and as similar, he has reason
to think another mind has an experience partly like and partly
unlike his own—like in as much as it contains what corresponds
to that which is
common
to the two objects he has in mind;
unlike in as much as it contains nothing which corresponds to
the elements which make it possible for him to recognize two
objects. It is this that is in his mind when he speaks of thinking
of two objects as really two and yet indistinguishable to this
man or that. If, however, the expression "two things may be
indistinguishable" is used to indicate this experience, it should
be carefully borne in mind that the proposition must not be taken
literally, for the good reason that the subject and predicate are
not in the one consciousness. The "two objects" are in the
mind of Smith, and the "indistinguishable" element in the
mind of Jones. When we speak of two men as seeing the same
thing, I have shown that we are using the word same in a looser
sense which should never be confounded with the stricter sense.
Strictly speaking, then, the "two things" are never indistinguishable,
but that which corresponds to the two things in a
consciousness from which all recognition of duality is absent.
That one man may have a consciousness of duality while
another man has not, and that these two experiences may be
related as the experiences of different minds are related when
we say they are experiencing the same thing, no one would care

[62]

to dispute. Should a man say that he can think of himself as
unable to distinguish two things which are nevertheless two, the
case, would not be materially different. The man cannot, of
course, think of
the two things
as indistinguishable, but he may
think of two things and connect with this thought the thought
of himself as having an experience in which there is no
consciousness of duality.

But, it may be insisted, we are still only talking about
consciousness; let us come to "real" things. Suppose no one
able to distinguish between them, abstract all consciousness of
difference, would not two "real" things remain two, however
we might confound them? Can a thing in one place be a thing
in another place, however closely it may resemble it, or however
ignorant we may be?

To this I answer that when one speaks of
two
"real" things
the words only mean something to him because he has present
in mind what I have said must be present if one is to have a
consciousness of duality. A "thing in one place" and a "thing
in another place" are to him two simply because he thinks them
as differing—in place. When one has come to the conclusion
that he must duplicate his experience, distinguish between the
world of immediate and the world of mediate objects, and place
the latter in a region "outside," there is nothing to prevent
him from thinking of two "real" things as two, although all
distinctions within the field of immediate objects have been
obliterated. Still, in thinking these "real" things as two, he
does just what he does in thinking two immediate objects as
two—he recognizes difference. The twoness depends upon difference
as much in the one case as in the other, and to speak of
two objects in a "real" world as two and yet having no differing
element would be to use words without meaning. In talking
about a "real" world, if we are really to talk and not merely to

[63]

utter a series of sounds, our words must be significant. To say
"this or that may be in a 'real' world, though we may not be
able to conceive it," would, if "this" or "that" implies a contradiction,
be to say nothing. The fact is that this "external"
world, as we think it, implies the notions of before and after, in
this place and that, all the distinctions and differences which
make it to us a world of distinct objects. Of course it follows
that things in the "external" world are thought as distinct from
each other, but this does not affect my statement that distinction
is impossible without difference.

We may, then, have a series of experiences, beginning with
one in which two objects are recognized as similar and yet are
very clearly distinguished as two objects, continued in others
in which the sense of duality falls more and more into the background,
and ending in one in which there is no consciousness
of duality at all. The last of these experiences is not wholly
different from the others. There is in it no experience of similarity
in so far as this word is used to express identity in difference,
or a relation between two. There can be no such relation
unless there are two, and here there are not two. But it
should be marked that this experience differs from the others,
not in the element which has led us to declare two objects similar—the
element which they have in common—but in that which
has led us to declare them two and different. It is by adding to
this last experience, so to speak, that we get the others. They
contain it and more. Usage will not allow us to apply the term
similarity in speaking of an experience in which two things are
not distinguished, and this is proper enough; but it should never
be forgotten that this experience is at the bottom of all our
experiences of similarity—is, so to speak, their common core.
When, therefore, I said some pages back that all the kinds of
sameness under discussion contain the idea of similarity, I was

[64]

using the word in a certain broad sense to indicate that which is
the ground of all our experiences of similarity, and is also found
in the first kind of sameness on the list. I preferred to use
there the word similarity, because it was easy to show that this
notion is really contained in six of the seven uses of the word
same, and it was convenient afterward to show the connection
between the first kind of sameness and the notion of similarity.

And now it is not difficult to guess why we employ such expressions
as we do to indicate strict identity. If I habitually use the
proposition "x is y" to indicate a relation between two things
having similar elements and yet regarded as distinct, and look
upon the proposition as justified by the similar elements, observing
that, these remaining unchanged, the dissimilar elements
may be very variable without affecting the truth of the proposition,
what more natural than that I should go on using the propositional
form when the dissimilar elements have diminished to
zero—when the proposition has become "x is x"? To be sure,
no one can take such a proposition literally, any more than one
can soberly believe that one divided by zero results in infinity.
Such expressions have their use and value, but they must be
properly understood. If one uses the expression "x is x" to
emphasize the fact that one is not to pass from x to any y or z—that
one is to rule out all distinction or sense of difference, the use
cannot be harmful. And the use of the propositional form has
this great convenience: it puts a period, so to speak, to one's
thinking, and prevents one from casting about for a completion
of the thought. If one merely say to me "x," I shall probably
take it as a subject and busy myself to find a predicate. If he
say "x is x," he says really no more than x, but he makes me
fix my thoughts upon x alone.

Sec. 20.
In the foregoing search for the element that the kinds
of sameness have in common, I have had in mind chiefly the

[65]

samenesses of things immediately known. It is not necessary
to repeat the search in the field of the "external." We have but
the seven kinds of sameness, and whatever may be the things that
are the same in these several ways, the elements I have indicated
must be present if our words are to be significant. But
one thing remains for me to do in this part of my monograph,
and that will not detain me long. I must distinguish between
sameness and identity, or rather point out to what kinds of
sameness this latter word is commonly applied.

The word is often used quite loosely, but where the attempt
is made to distinguish between identity and sameness in a looser
sense, and to use terms with some precision, the former word
serves to indicate sameness in which there is no consciousness
of duality, or in which the consciousness of duality has fallen into
the background and may easily be overlooked. Sameness of the
first kind, for example, is spoken of as identity. This is the only
kind of sameness in which there is no element of duality at all.
The use of the word identity is not, however, restricted to this.
Locke's inquiry concerning the identity of masses of inorganic
matter, of vegetables, of animals, and of persons, has to do with
sameness of the third kind on the list. In this kind of sameness
there is no clear consciousness that one is dealing with more
than one thing, and Locke's discussion is conducted throughout
as though one were not.

It may be objected that in certain other kinds there is often no
clear consciousness of duality, and yet one does not think of
using the term identity. This is quite true. The two kinds
mentioned have been thought worthy of special discussion by
logician and philosopher, and have been given a technical name.
The others have not. Still, although the word is not commonly
used in such cases, it would, I fancy, seem natural to use it in a
direct ratio to the degree in which the sense of duality falls into

[66]

the background. Dr. Johnson would probably have been willing
to say that the stone he saw himself kick was identical with the
one the existence of which he wanted to prove. Bishop Berkeley
could have felt only disgust at such a use of the term. Scarcely
anyone, I suppose, would regard himself as speaking strictly if
he called the fourth kind of sameness identity. The co-existence
of the two things compared would prevent their being confounded.
Without, then, attempting to assign any very exact
limits to the application of a somewhat loosely used word, I may
repeat my former statement that men use the word identity to
mark certain kinds of sameness in which there is little or no
consciousness of duality, and they are not inclined to use it to
mark samenesses in which things are recognized as similar but
clearly distinct.

With this I end the first part of my discussion, and I confess
I draw a long breath in doing so. When I sat down to write it
was with the impression that I could say all that was necessary
about the kinds of sameness in a much smaller number of pages;
but finding it impossible to avoid misunderstandings without
being more explicit and detailed, I have had to change my plan.
Now, that I am through, I must confess to myself that most
persons will find this hair-splitting anything but entertaining—which
would be held by the inconsiderate to furnish a presumption
against the truth it contains, if ancient adages go for anything.
It should be remembered, however, that the old saw
which puts truth in a well does not indicate that the well may
not be a dry one. With this consolatory reflection I turn to the
second part of my task.

[67]

PART II.

HISTORICAL AND CRITICAL.

Those now who propose to hold mutual discussion must needs understand one another
somewhat: for without this how can they have any mutual discussion? Each of their words
then, must be familiar and have definite meaning, and not many meanings, but one only,
and if it have more meanings than one, they must make it clear in which of these senses it is
used.

Aristotle, Metaph., Book X, c. 5, Â§ 3.

Section 21.
When Heraclitus of Ephesus, moved thereto by
his view of the constant flux of things, declared it impossible to
enter the same river twice,
[30]
he evidently supposed that a river
can be the same only in the first and strictest sense of the word.
He denied, consequently, a right to use the word, as it constantly
is used, to indicate that certain phenomena belong to a
group or series, which, in its totality, is to us a single object.
When we say that we have entered the same river twice we have
no reference to the actual experiences of the two occasions
considered merely as experiences. Of course, these are not
the same, as each is itself, and they may even be somewhat dissimilar.
Nor have we reference to the separate particles of
which the body of water is composed. We all admit that the water
in a river changes, and yet we never think of saying that the
river is no longer the same. The two kinds of sameness are
quite distinct, yet both are legitimate; and both were as familiar
to the ancient Greek as to the modern American. Socrates was
considered Socrates from boyhood through youth to manhood.
The Ilissus was the Ilissus whether swollen or shrunken.
The philosopher's difficulty with the river did not arise out of

[68]

the fact that this kind of sameness was not perfectly well recognized
in language and in common thought. It arose out of the
fact that the beginnings of reflection make many things seem
strange which before passed unnoticed, and sometimes lead to
assertion and denial evidently contrary to experience and common
sense. The unreflective man calls the river the same on
two successive days, but he has no clear notion of what the word
implies. In a loose way he opposes "same" to "different."
Heraclitus saw that the water in a river is constantly changing.
He who enters twice does not enter precisely the same body of
water. What more natural, and what more fallacious, than to
assert that he does not twice enter the same river?

Sec. 22.
And well might Cratylus hold his peace and move
his finger
[31]
when he had capped the climax with the statement
that the same river could not be entered once. Heraclitus had
merely denied sameness of the third kind to be sameness, since
it implies duality. Cratylus, surprised by a discovery of duality
where he had not before suspected it, will not allow the term
where there is no duality whatever. It is not surprising
that he came at last to be "of opinion that one ought to speak of
nothing." Upon such a basis speech loses its significance.

Sec. 23.
The Parmenidean argument for the eternity of Being
[32]

rests partly upon a confusion of the first kind of sameness with
the fourth. Being has had no origin, for from what could it
have been derived? Not from the non-existent, for this has no
existence: and not from the existent, for it is itself the existent.
The quibble about the non-existent we need not consider, though
it is seriously repeated by more than one writer of our time.
The last part of the argument, "not from the existent, for it is
itself the existent," draws its whole force from the assumption

[69]

that "it" is "the existent" as a thing is itself, or in the first
sense of the word same. But if this be the case, the argument
is a mere farce, an argument only in words. The phrase, "derived
from the existent," means nothing at all unless it means
that the existent in question is before the thing derived. To
say it is the thing derived, is to reduce the words to nothing.
If it mean anything to speak of the existent as derived from the
existent, it is because each of these is
an
existent—that is, a
thing belonging to a class and distinguished from other members
of this class by some difference. In this case the difference
is that of before and after. An existent derived from an existent
is the same with it only as things of a class are the same. If
we choose to eliminate all differences and speak of "
the
existent"
we may do so; but then it is inadmissible to raise questions
about its derivation, and bring in those very time distinctions
between different "existents" which we are supposing
absent.

Sec. 24.
The nihilistic doctrine of Gorgias of Leontini,
[33]

who taught that nothing exists, that if it did exist it could not
be known, and that if it did exist and could be known the knowledge
of it could not be communicated by one mind to another,
is founded in part upon such bad reasoning that it is rather surprising
that Gorgias should have been guilty of it. That part of
it, however, which has to do with the communicability of knowledge
is rather better than the rest, and indicates some progress
in reflection. A sign, he says, differs from the thing it signifies.
How can one communicate the notion of color by words, since
the ear hears sounds and not colors? Besides, how can the same
idea be in two different persons? This reasoning would seem at
least plausible, I think, to many minds at the present day. It is
evidently the offspring of a confusion of samenesses. A sign differs,

[70]

it is true, from the thing signified. The word blue heard
by the ear is not like the color blue seen or imagined. But if
any one pronounce the word, and ask me if I am thinking of
the color he has mentioned, I say yes. The sound is not like
the color, but it is its representative, and one of the proper uses
of the word same (the fifth) indicates just this relation between
representative and thing represented. Any attempt to discredit
communication of knowledge on the ground that one cannot
speak colors, and that, therefore, one man is speaking one thing
and the other thinking another, goes on the supposition that
what is said and what is thought must be the same in sense first
(strict identity) or in sense fourth (must be a thing of the same
kind). And as to the existence of the same thing in two minds;
here Gorgias has evidently discovered with some surprise that
sameness in sense sixth differs from sameness in sense first, and
has felt impelled to deny it the name altogether. He has perceived
a duality where most men have not noticed it; and,
instead of observing that there are samenesses and samenesses,
and that the communication of knowledge is concerned with the
sixth kind in this connection, and not with the first, he has
denied the communication of knowledge. Had he found it
necessary to carry out his theoretic premises to practical conclusions
he would have stopped talking, which he did not;
though presumably the irrepressible didactic instinct would have
led him, spite of consistency, to imitate Cratylus in moving his
finger.

Sec. 25.
The reasoning in the Platonic Dialogues is very frequently
not above suspicion; but it is not easy to find anywhere
such a nest of paralogisms as we have in the Parmenides. How far
Plato was in earnest in all this quibbling, and what was his aim,
I will not pretend to say. He has, however, very well illustrated
the possibilities of equivocation in juggling with samenesses, and

[71]

I shall quote a bit of the argument concerning the one and the
many to show how readily this is done. Almost any part of the
dialogue would do, but I choose the first bout between Parmenides
and Aristoteles. I take Professor Jowett's version:
[34]

Parmenides proceeded: If one is, he said, the one cannot
be many?

Impossible.

Then the one cannot have parts, and cannot be a whole?

How is that?

Why, the part would surely be the part of a whole?

Yes.

And that of which no part is wanting, would be a whole?

Certainly.

Then, in either case, one would be made up of parts; both as
being a whole, and also as having parts?

Certainly.

And in either case, the one would be many, and not one?

True.

But, surely, one ought to be not many, but one?

Surely.

Then, if one is to remain one, it will not be a whole, and will
not have parts?

No.

And if one has no parts, it will have neither beginning,
middle, nor end; for these would be parts of one?

Right.

But then, again, a beginning and an end are the limits of
everything?

Certainly.

Then the one, neither having beginning nor end, is unlimited?

Yes, unlimited.

[72]

And therefore formless, as not being able to partake either of
round or straight.

How is that?

Why, the round is that of which all the extreme points are
equidistant from the centre?

Yes.

And the straight is that of which the middle intercepts the
extremes?

True.

Then the one would have parts, and would be many, whether
it partook of a straight or of a round form?

Assuredly.

But having no parts, one will be neither straight nor round?

Right.

Then, being of such a nature, one cannot be in any place, for
it cannot be either in another or in itself.

How is that?

Because, if one be in another, it will be encircled in that other
in which it is contained, and will touch it in many places; but
that which is one and indivisible, and does not partake of a circular
nature, cannot be touched by a circle in many places.

Certainly not.

And one being in itself, will also contain itself, and cannot be
other than one, if in itself; for nothing can be in anything
which does not contain it.

Impossible.

But then, is not that which contains other than that which is
contained? for the same whole cannot at once be affected
actively and passively; and one will thus be no longer one, but
two?

True.

Then one cannot be anywhere, either in itself or in another?

No.

[73]

Further consider, whether that which is of such a nature can
have either rest or motion.

Why not?

Why, because motion is either motion in place or change in
self; these are the only kinds of motion.

Yes.

And the one, when changed in itself, cannot possibly be any
longer one.

It cannot.

And therefore cannot experience this sort of motion?

Clearly not.

Can the motion of one, then, be in place?

Perhaps.

But if one moved in place, must it not either move round and
round in the same place, or from one place to another?

Certainly.

And that which moves round and round in the same place,
must go round upon a centre; and that which goes round upon
a centre must have other parts which move around the centre;
but that which has no centre and no parts cannot possibly be
carried round upon a centre?

Impossible.

But perhaps the motion of the one consists in going from one
place to another?

Perhaps so, if it moves at all.

And have we not already shown that one can not be in anything?

Yes.

And still greater is the impossibility of one coming into being
in anything?

I do not see how that is.

Why, because anything which comes into being in anything,

[74]

cannot as yet be in that other thing while still coming into
being, nor remain entirely out of it, if already coming into
being in it.

Certainly.

And therefore whatever comes into being in another must
have parts, and the one part may be in that other, and the other
part out of it; but that which has no parts cannot possibly be at
the same time a whole, which is either within or without
anything.

True.

And how can that which has neither parts, nor a whole, come
into being anywhere either as a part or a whole? Is not that a
still greater impossibility?

Clearly.

Then one does not change by a change of place, whether by
going somewhere and coming into being in something; or again,
by going round in the same place; or again, by change in itself?

True.

The one, then, is incapable of any kind of motion?

Incapable.

But neither can the one exist in anything, as we affirm?

Yes, that is affirmed by us.

Then it is never in the same?

Why not?

Because being in the same is being in something which is the
same.

Certainly.

But it cannot be in itself, and cannot be in other?

True.

Then one is never the same?
[35]

It would seem not.

[75]

And that which is never in the same has no rest, and stands
not still?

It cannot stand still.

One, then, as would seem, is neither standing still nor in
motion?

Clearly not.

Neither will one be the same with itself or other; nor again,
other than itself, or other.

How is that?

If other than itself it would be other than one, and would not
be one.

True.

And if the same with other, it would be that other, and not
itself; so that upon this supposition, too, it would not have the
nature of one, but would be other than one?

It would.

Then it will not be the same with other, or other than itself?

It will not.

Neither will one be other than other, while it remains one; for
not the one, but only the other, can be other of other, and nothing
else.

True.

Then not by virtue of being one, will one be other?

Certainly not.

But if not by virtue of being one, not by virtue of being
itself; and if not by virtue of being itself, not itself, and itself
not being other at all, will not be other of anything?

Right.

Neither will one be the same with itself.

Why not?

Because the nature of the one is surely not the nature of the
same.

[76]

Why is that?

Because when a thing becomes the same with anything, it does
not necessarily become one.

Why not?

That which becomes the same with the many necessarily
becomes many and not one.

True.

And yet, if there were no difference between the one and the
same, when a thing became the same, it would always become
one; and when it became one, the same.

Certainly.

And, therefore, if one be the same with one, it is not one with
one, and will therefore be one and also not one.

But that is surely impossible.

And therefore the one can neither be other of other, nor the
same with one.

Impossible.

And thus one is neither the same, nor other, in relation to
itself or other?

No.

Neither will one be like or unlike itself or other.

Why not?

Because likeness is sameness of affections.

Yes.

And sameness has been shown to be a nature distinct from
oneness?

That has been shown.

But if one had any other affection than that of being one, it
would be affected in such a way as to be more than one; and that
is impossible.

True.

Then one can never have the same affections either as another
or as itself?

[77]

Clearly not.

Then it cannot be like other, or like itself.

No.

Nor can it be affected so as to be other, for then it would be
affected in such a way as to be more than one.

It would.

That which is affected in a manner other than itself or other,
will be unlike itself or other, if sameness of affections is likeness.

True.

But the one, as appears, never having affections other than its
own, is never unlike itself or other?

Never.

Then the one is never either like or unlike itself or other?

Plainly not.

In reading this extract one cannot but admire the courtesy or
wonder at the simplicity of Aristoteles. He always answers
just as he should to keep the ball rolling; and he is in no wise
compelled to do this under the circumstances, for the argument
is loose in the extreme. Briefly stated, the reasoning is as follows:

One cannot be a whole, and cannot have parts, for then it
would not be one, but many. But if it has no parts it has no
beginning, middle, or end, and is formless. It is then in no
place, for it cannot be in itself, since the container must be different
from the thing contained; nor can it be in other, for it
would have to be encircled by that other, and touched in many
parts, which is impossible. It follows that it can neither be at
rest nor in motion. Not in motion; for it cannot have change
in itself, or it would no longer be one; nor can it have motion in
place, whether circular motion upon a centre or motion from

[78]

place to place; the former for the reason that circular motion
implies a centre and parts around the centre; and the latter because
one is in no place: and as to coming into being in anything,
which may be regarded as a kind of motion, while doing this it
would have to be part in and part not in, which is impossible.
It cannot be at rest, for one is never in the same; to be in the
same, is to be in something which is the same, and one cannot be
in anything. Nor, farther, can one be the same with itself or
other, nor other than itself or other. If other than itself it would
not be one; and if the same with other it would be that other, and
not itself. On the other hand only other can be the other of
other, and not one; and the one cannot be the same with itself,
for the nature of the one is not the nature of the same, since
that which becomes the same with the many does not become
one. Finally, one cannot be like or unlike itself or other, for
likeness is sameness of affections, and sameness is not oneness;
one must, however, have no affection except oneness, or it becomes
more than one. It cannot, then, have the same affections
as itself or other. As, for the same reason, it cannot have other
affections than itself or other, it cannot be unlike.

We have here one chief error, which runs through almost the
whole of the argument—is, indeed, the "Kern" of the "Pudel"—and
several subsidiary errors of different kinds. Some of these
last are very readily discovered, as that about the coming into
being in a thing. With these, however, I am not concerned. I
merely remark
en passant
that they may all be cleared up with a
little care and accuracy, and I turn to the main error, which consists
in a constant confusion of two kinds of sameness. The
fact is that Parmenides is always passing from "the one," or one
in the abstract, mere oneness, to "a one," or one object. These
are no more identical in the strict sense than "manhood" and
"a man," and in overlooking their difference he is simply confounding

[79]

the first and the fourth kinds of sameness. "The one"
cannot have parts, for the good reason that it is a quality taken
by itself, and not a thing, which is thought as a bundle of qualities.
"A one," on the other hand, may have parts, and each of
these parts may be "a one" too. "A one" by no means consists
of a single element, oneness, but of this element combined
with others; and each such group may be distinguished from
each other such group, and all be recognized as similar, or the
same in a true sense of the word. The question whether one
can be in a place, too, evidently has to do, not with "the one,"
but "a one," for spacial or temporal differences are
individualizing
,
and distinguish a thing from another thing of the same kind.
To ask whether "the one" may or may not be in a place is inadmissible.

The same error is at the bottom of the argument about the
one's being in motion or at rest. The question has no significance
except in reference to "a one." If we speak of "the one"
as in motion, we at once put this abstract element in such a relation
to other elements that we have no longer "the one" but
"a one." "The one" cannot have change in itself and remain
"the one," but "a one" may change a good deal and still be
"a one." And without admitting the justice of the argument,
that what has no parts cannot be in anything, the proof of the
impossibility of motion in space may be condemned merely upon
the ground that it is only "the one" which cannot have parts,
while it is only "a one" which is concerned in the problem of
motion. The same may be said for the argument against the
one's coming into being in anything. It is only "a one" which
can be thought as coming into being in a thing, and "a one"
may have parts. As for the impossibility of the one's being at
rest, on the ground that to be at rest, a thing must be in the same,
and one cannot be in anything—this is a repetition of the former

[80]

error. "A one" may be in something, as has been pointed out,
even on the basis established at the outset, and it is with this,
and not with "the one," that we are concerned in the problem
of rest and motion.

The rest of the argument is based upon errors of a different
kind, and in it one may keep to "the one" throughout, if one
choose. There is, of course, no reason to think that the speaker
did this. He probably here, as before, carried over to "a one,"
one thought as an individual thing, distinctions drawn in view of
"the one," one viewed in the abstract. As some of the statements
made may be true or false as one is taken in this sense or
that; and particularly as the antinomy rests upon a misconception
as to the nature of sameness, I will continue the analysis.
What is to be proved is, first, that one cannot be the same with
itself or other, or other than itself or other; and second, that it
cannot be like or unlike itself or other. The position that the
one, if other than itself, would not be one, and if the same with
other, would be that other, is somewhat ambiguous. If "a one"
is in question, it may undoubtedly be "a one" and yet be
other than any particular one; and it may be the same with
other—another one—without ceasing to be one, if by same we
mean similar. The play upon words in "other of other" it is
not necessary to consider. The conclusion that one cannot be
the same with itself is based upon the supposition that sameness
is a quality superadded to the other qualities of a thing; but in
its first sense the word does not even serve to indicate a relation;
it is merely used to point out the absence of duality. Both
"a one" and "the one" may be the same with themselves perfectly
well, and in saying so we do not in thought endow them
with any quality not already possessed. This last error serves
also as a basis to the second paradoxical position, that one cannot
be like or unlike itself or other. It assumes likeness and unlikeness

[81]

to be qualities added to the other qualities of things
which are like or unlike.

A possible objection to my use of the term "a one" I must
forestall before passing on. I have used this as synonymous
with "one object." One horse is one object, and so is one part
of a horse. It may be said, however, that "a one" may also be
used to signify a single occurrence of oneness, as distinguished
from another occurrence of oneness. That any element of consciousness
may be distinguished from any similar element merely
by spatial or temporal differences I have argued in the first
part of my monograph. Why may not then "a one" mean the
oneness of this one horse, or the oneness of this part of the
horse? And if it may, can "a one" of this kind have parts any
more than "the one?"

I answer, it cannot; for it is then only a particular occurrence
of the quality (if I may so use the word) of oneness. But, then,
if we so understand the term, the argument loses all significance.
We cannot call "a one" of this kind a container or a
thing contained, or talk of it as encircled by anything. We do
not even try to imagine it as moving on its centre, or passing
from place to place, or coming into being in anything, or being
at rest in anything. Such language we use only in speaking of
things. It seems to me plain that the speaker is thinking of one
as a thing, and it is this that gives its charm to the bundle of
paradoxes. The Eleatic "one" was always a thing and not mere
unity or an occurrence of unity. My criticism of the reasoning
is, I think, just. And whether Plato is responsible for the Parmenides
or not, we must agree that such a confusion of "the
one" and "a one" (as an object) would not be foreign to his
modes of thought. His world of Ideas is peopled with "the"'s
turned into "a"'s, a fact which his acute pupil Aristotle was
not slow to discover.
[36]

[82]

Sec. 26.
Aristotle has again and again discussed with his
usual keenness the kinds of sameness. He saw well enough
that the word is ambiguous, and may with equal right be employed
in speaking of experiences which do or do not contain an element
of duality. He has pointed out that the law of non-contradiction
has to do with sameness of the first kind, and not with the
others.
[37]
His question as to "Socrates" and "Socrates sitting,"
his treatment of "Coriscus" and "the musical Coriscus," his
statement that the white and the musical are the same when they
are accidents in the same subject,
[38]
show that he clearly understood
the significance of sameness in sense third. He gives us
sense fourth when he says that things may be called the same
when they belong to the same species or genus.
[39]
In his polemic
against the Protagorean doctrine of relativity,
[40]
senses sixth and
seventh come to the surface, though they are not very clearly or
exhaustively discussed. The fallacy in the apparent possibility
of attributing contradictory predicates to the same subject, from
the fact that the same wine may appear sweet to one taster and
not sweet to another, or at one time sweet and at another not
sweet to the one palate, is laid bare in the distinction between
kinds of sameness. Aristotle distinguishes between the wine
itself and the sensations it produces in different persons, and he
recognizes the fact that one man's perception of the "same"
wine need not be wholly like that of another. But this does not
imply any violation of the law of non-contradiction, for each
sensation is just what it is at any instant; and the statement that
the same wine is sweet and not sweet at the one moment
amounts only to saying that the one object can cause dissimilar
sensations in two minds at one moment. As much may be said

[83]

for the non-simultaneous sensations of the one man. Sensations
differing in time are two, and may differ without violating any
law. In marking the fact that when we say two men perceive
the same thing we do not mean that the immediate object of
knowledge is in the two cases strictly one, but merely that these
two objects are related in a peculiar way, Aristotle draws the line
between sameness in sense first and in sense sixth. As to sense
seventh. He distinguishes between the apparent and the real,
and yet goes on speaking, quite in modern fashion, as though
one thing could serve for both. He points out,
Ã  propos
of pressing
upon the eyeball and doubling the visual image, that there
is a distinction between the apparent and the real, and then
closes the paragraph with the remark that "to those persons who
do not move their organ of vision that which is one appears
one."
[41]
This language would certainly seem to indicate that that
which is appears—or that they are the same in some strict sense
of the word. The sentence reads much in the style of Mr.
Spencer or Sir William Hamilton.

It appears, then, that Aristotle recognized a sameness in which
there is no sense of duality, and samenesses in which two things
are called the same and yet distinguished as two. Our way of
expressing strict identity, however, a way which, as I have
shown, does not properly express it all—seems to have misled
him into finding a sort of quasi duality even here, where he
knows it to be really absent. In a chapter
[42]
devoted to sameness
and diversity, he closes his list of samenesses with the remark:
"It is plain that sameness is a oneness either of two or more
things with reference to their essence, or of one thing treated as
two; as when you say a thing is the same with itself, for then
you do treat it as two." We do employ two words, undoubtedly;
but if we are really thinking a thing as itself, we are not making it

[84]

dual in any sense whatever. The quotation smacks just a little
of Cratylus.

Sec. 27.
The sceptical arguments of Pyrrho are excellent
instances of a confusion of samenesses. The argument, for
example, that since an apple seen by the eye as yellow seems to
the taste sweet, and to the smell as fragrant, "that which is seen
is just as likely to be something else as the reality;"
[43]
this argument
gains what little plausibility it may have from the assumption
that an object seen and an object tasted are (or ought to be)
the same in sense first instead of sense third.

And the complaints, that things believed to be large, sometimes,
as when at a distance, appear small; that things which we
believe to be straight, sometimes seem bent; that the sun has
one appearance in the morning, and another at noon;
[44]
these, and
all others like them, assume that an object seen near at hand and
then seen at a distance, a stick seen as straight and then seen as
crooked, the sun on the horizon and the sun at the zenith, are in
each case one strictly, and not merely one as each element in a
complex of experiences is one with each other element, when
any one may represent the whole. The conclusion that, since it
is not possible to view things without reference to "place and
position," their true nature cannot be known,
[45]
is founded upon
this error.

This becomes clear when one asks, what is it, after all, the
nature of which is so in doubt? Is it a stick? the sun? These
words are ambiguous. Two consecutive experiences of the same
stick—as we ordinarily use this word in speaking of sticks—are
not strictly identical, and need not be alike. The stick seen
on two occasions is not the same stick in sense I. If I limit
the meaning of the words "the stick" to one of these experiences,

[85]

then the true nature of the stick is just what is
experienced on that occasion. What is experienced on the second
occasion is another stick, and its true nature is also just what it
seems to be. If, however, by "the stick" I do not mean only
the experience of one moment, but a series of experiences differing
more or less from one another, then I am under no necessity
to select one of them as the true nature of the stick, for its true
nature is nothing more nor less than the whole group of experiences.
If I try to discover or to invent some new experience
which I may call the true nature of the group, I am simply adding
to it in thought another experience which takes its place among
those the group already contains. I am playing with the word
nature. This last experience could not be more important than
those among which it is placed, and it could not stand for any
one of them in any other way than each of them could stand for
it. Should it be objected that by "the stick" one does not mean
either a single experience of the stick or the sum total of the group
of experiences, but a something distinct from all these and
inferred through them, I answer, that in this case the argument
from the variability of experiences is not to the point. Such a
"stick" as this would be the same with either of those just discussed
only in the seventh sense of the word, and its nature
would be the same with their nature only in that sense too. An
experience of the stick out of "place and position," if that were
conceivable, would not give us this "stick," for such an experience
would still be an experience. It must never be forgotten
that this "external" stick is quite distinct from any or all experiences,
and could not be given in experiences of any kind. It
can only be inferred. If an unvarying series of experiences is
good ground for inferring an unvarying "external" stick, similar
to what is experienced, one would suppose a varying series
of experiences would furnish a basis for inference of a varying

[86]

"external" stick, in its successive phases like what is experienced.
Unless some reason is given for a discrimination in favor of the
unvarying series, the argument from variation does not affect the
"external" stick at all.

It is evident, however, that in this particular argument, at least,
the "external" is not in Pyrrho's mind at all. What perplexes
him is, that what he is accustomed to call a straight stick sometimes
looks crooked. On reflection he discovers that he calls it
straight only because it seems straight on some occasions; and
if it may at one time seem straight and at another seem crooked,
which is it in reality? The question is a very natural one. The
unreflective do not ask it, because they assume that one of the experiences
is to be taken as expressing the true nature of the object
and the other relegated to the sphere of more or less deceptive appearance.
The man who has begun to reflect does ask it, because
he sees that the assumed true nature is an appearance too, and it
naturally occurs to him that it also may be deceptive. If he
reflected more, he would see that he is partly right and partly
wrong. We do not regard as equally important every element in
the group of experiences which we call an object. Certain elements,
notably the tactual qualities and those visual experiences
which give us the best opportunity of inferring the tactual qualities,
stand in the foreground when we speak of the object. We
name the object according to these. In saying "a straight
stick" we have prominently in mind certain tactual experiences,
and certain visual experiences which normally are connected with
these and give us the right to infer them. We call any appearance
delusive which leads us to infer tactual experiences, and
visual experiences of a kind regarded as best representative of
these tactual experiences, when such cannot be actually experienced.
Certain elements in the total group, which is to us an
experienced object, may then properly be regarded as in a sense

[87]

the true nature of the object, they are the most important part,
and the part to which other elements are referred. These elements
may justly be regarded as delusive when they mislead
us in our inferences as to the important elements. So far the
common man is right. And as no element is delusive in itself,
but only in so far as it refers the mind to something else, and to
the wrong something else, those elements which are ultimate and
not used as signs of others, cannot be delusive. In raising this
question with regard to them Pyrrho is wrong. These elements
may, to be sure, be used as signs or indications of any other
elements in the group, and in their turn made stepping stones;
but this is not commonly done, and language and common
thought rarely mark logical possibilities. The language in use
fairly expresses the attitude of the average man towards the elements
in his thought.

On the other hand, the unreflective man speaks as if the less
important, or perhaps I had better say less prominent, experiences
were not a part of the object as he knows it. He seems
to regard the whole object as actually present, when a single
experience only is present. In putting all experiences on the
same plane, so to speak, the Pyrrhonist makes a genuine advance.
Wherein he errs is this: He sees that a stick seen near at hand
is as much an experience or appearance as a stick seen at a distance,
and that one of these phenomena does not differ in kind
from the other; he sees also that to assume that one is the real
stick and the other is not, seems to go upon the assumption that
they differ in kind; he is consequently unwilling to call any one
of his experiences the real stick, and yet he insists upon looking
for a real stick, which may be expressed in a single experience.
It never seems to occur to him that the real stick may be the
name of the whole series of experiences in their appropriate
relations. He wishes a sameness in the strict sense, with no

[88]

element of duality. The stick seen straight in the air, and seen
bent in the water, is the same stick in sense third. It takes
both of these experiences to express the true nature of this
stick. No one experience could serve. It is the battle between
stick as a single experience, and stick as a group of experiences,
that leads to all the confusion.

I have given as much space to Pyrrho as I care to, and I will
not delay over him and his successors. These furnish good
material to one fond of analysis. There is, however, a great
deal of repetition among the sceptics. They occupy themselves
chiefly either in confounding the first kind of sameness with the
third, as in the preceding; or in confounding the first kind with
the sixth, as in the argument for uncertainty drawn from the
varying guise under which the same object appears to different
persons. The ambiguity of the word same, as here used, is
apparent, and it is in this ambiguity that they become entangled.

Sec. 28.
Into the labyrinths of the scholastic philosophy I
hesitate to enter, and yet I could hardly be excused for passing on
to the moderns without at least a reference to the great dispute
over Universals—a dispute which is, at bottom, a quarrel concerning
samenesses. I shall speak of it very briefly.

The object of the general term or class name is in question.
Plato, distinguishing between the universal and the individual,
between man and men, thought it necessary, according to Aristotle,
who has not, I think, done him injustice, to assume an
object for the universal outside of and apart from all the individuals
forming a class. The Idea is a real thing,
the
real thing
in which the individuals participate, or of which they are copies;
but it is not itself to be found in any or all of them, except, so
to speak, in a figurative or metaphorical way. Aristotle, finding
no reason to assume a new individual, for so he regarded the
Platonic Idea, placed the universal
in
the individuals composing

[89]

the class. Certain of the schoolmen, emphasizing the distinction
between real things and mental representations, maintained
that only individuals have real existence, and asserted either
that universals exist merely as peculiar combinations of mental
elements which serve to think the objects forming a class, or
that the universal is the word, which may be applied indifferently
to many individuals of one kind. In these views we have
the
universalia ante rem
, the
universalia in re
, and the
universalia
post rem
; or extreme Realism, moderate Realism, and
Nominalism in its two forms.

The examination into the respective merits of the positions
which have been taken with regard to universals will be facilitated
by distinguishing carefully between the different spheres
of being; that is, between things immediately known and "real"
things mediately known, as also between things contained in
one consciousness and those contained in another. It is plainly
important not to confound these classes with each other.

Let us take, first, a number of resembling objects in a single
consciousness. I have already pointed out that when we say
several such objects are the same we do not at all mean to deny
that they are distinct objects. We merely wish to indicate that
each possesses certain elements which, taken by themselves,
and after making abstraction from all other elements, render
impossible any distinction between different objects. We distinguish
two objects as two through some difference, even if it
be only local or temporal. Redness combined with x and redness
combined with y are recognized as two occurrences of redness,
but this only on account of x and y. Redness perceived
to-day and redness perceived yesterday are two occurrences of
redness, marked as such by the "to-day" and the "yesterday."
Redness considered simply contains nothing which will allow
of such distinctions. This does not imply at all that redness

[90]

considered simply is
an occurrence of redness
—that since we
have not two or more occurrence of the quality we have a single
occurrence of it, an individual. We have not, if we have really
abstracted from all save the redness, any "occurrence" or
"occurrences" at all, for these imply just the elements of difference
which we are endeavoring to eliminate. An "occurrence"
of redness means redness with a difference which will mark it
out from other redness, from another "occurrence." If, then,
one gives to twenty individuals a common name to indicate that
they resemble each other, or are in some sense the same, he
should keep clearly in mind just what this means. It means
that along with various differing elements each contains the element
x. He should remember that each individual is the same with
each other individual only in this sense, sense fourth. When he
proposes to separate the x from the other elements, and consider it
separately, he should be most careful to see that he is really
taking it separately, and not allowing shreds of foreign matter
to hang to it and give rise to difficulties and perplexities. He
should not overlook the fact that there is a fallacy in the very
question, Whether the x in one individual is identical (the same
in sense first) with the x in any other individual? If these two
x's are distinguishable as in two individuals, one is not considering
x merely, but x with other elements. The separation of the
x element from the other elements in the objects is here not
complete, or one would be considering not "an x" or "x's," but
x. Any one who sees this must see that he who asks such a
question is retaining a duality, and then trying to get out of it
an identity with no element of duality. He is "milking the he-goat."
He is trying to reduce sameness in sense fourth to
sameness in sense first.

Twenty objects immediately known must not be confounded
with twenty "real" things not immediately known, and of which

[91]

the objects are supposed to be representatives. These two
classes are the same with each other only in sense seventh. I
have discussed in detail in the first part of my monograph the
samenesses of "real" things, and it is not necessary to repeat
what I have said. It is enough to state that it was there made
evident that when we speak of a number of similar "real"
things as the same, we use the word in sense fourth, and have in
mind just the elements which are present when we speak of several
similar immediate objects of knowledge as the same. We are
merely carrying over to a set of imagined duplicates a distinction
which we observe in objects recognized as within consciousness.
When, therefore, we give twenty "real" things a common
name, and form them into a class, because they are alike,
we mean that along with various other "real" elements, each of
these objects contains the "real" element x. The word same
means to us just what it does when we speak of twenty similar
immediate objects as the same. We have changed only the
objects; we have not changed the sameness and all that depends
upon it. Two such objects are the same in sense fourth, and
never in sense first. If they could be the same in sense first,
they would not be two. When a man undertakes to separate in
thought the "real" x element from the other "real" elements
in two or more such objects, he should be careful, as in the case
of immediate objects, to make a complete separation and not a
partial one. He should see here, too, that the question whether
the x in one object and the x in another are strictly identical, is
a foolish one. "This x" and "that x" are not strictly identical, or
they would not be "this x" and "that x." Remove completely the
"this" and the "that" and all other differing elements—leave,
that is, only x, and the possibility of any such question simply
disappears. If there still seem to anyone ground for a question
in the premises, it is evidence that he is not considering

[92]

merely x. He is trying to keep two things two, and yet make
them one.

Twenty objects in one consciousness must not be confounded
with twenty objects in another. When we speak of two men as
seeing the same thing, we do not mean that the object in one
mind is the same with the object in the other in sense first, but
in sense sixth. This does not prevent them from being two. A
single object in one mind may be the same with itself in sense
first. A number of similar objects in one mind may be the same
in sense fourth. Two objects or two classes of objects in different
minds may be the same in sense sixth. One may, to be
sure, think of twenty objects in one mind, and of the same
(sense sixth) twenty objects in another mind as forty objects.
Philosophical reflection naturally leads to this. I am inducing a
reader to do it when I tell him that an object in one mind and
the same object in another are two objects. But in doing this,
one must bear in mind the fact that the forty objects belong to
two quite distinct classes, and that common language would not
reckon them as forty, but as twenty. In this there is, of course,
a pitfall for the unwary.

Now, when Plato looked for the object of the general name,
for the x contained in a class of similar objects, what did he do?
He created a new object distinct from and apart from all the
others. He is very vague in his statements, and he was probably
quite as vague in his thought; but I cannot see how anyone
familiar with the Phaedrus, the Republic, the Timaeus, the
Symposium and the Parmenides, and familiar with Plato's concrete
way of thinking in images, can avoid coming to the conclusion
that the Idea was to him predominantly an object, an individual—a
vague and inconsistent object, if you please, but still an
object. But
an
x is in no sense a universal. It is the same with
other x's only in sense fourth; that is, it is like them. The

[93]

x that they have in common must be x considered simply,
not x considered as here or there, in this place or in that. All
such differences must be eliminated if one is to get not an
individual, but a universal. If the Idea may be considered as

apart
from objects, it is an object in so far not essentially differing
from the others. Again, the Platonic Idea is an object, but
not to be put upon the same plane with other objects. They
suffer change, while it is immutable; they are perceivable by
the senses, and it is not. The objects of sense and the Idea are
in different worlds; and though we cannot accuse Plato of
drawing the distinctions of the modern hypothetical realist, he
has certainly given us a suggestive parallel to the Lockian ideas
and "real" things. The trouble has arisen out of his difficulty
in keeping an abstraction abstract; he has turned it into a
concrete, and, finding in the world of sense no place for this
concrete, this new individual, he has given it a world of its own.
Whatever this object in this world apart may be, it is certainly
not what is common to twenty individuals in the world of sensible
things.

Aristotle, seeing this difficulty, placed the idea
in
the objects
forming the class. It may be objected that putting x
in
a place
individualizes it as much as putting it
out of
a place. This is
quite true if the "in" is taken locally—taken as it is when we
speak of a man as being in one room rather than another. The
x in one object is not identically the x in another object. We
do not get the universal, x in the abstract, until we lose the
distinctions "in the one object," and "in the other object."
Two x's cannot be the same in sense first, from the mere fact
that they are two; an x in one place and an x in another place
are always two. If, however, by the statement that the universal
is in the objects, one mean merely that the universal is that
element x, which, combined with certain elements, forms a total

[94]

which is known as this object, and combined with certain others
forms a total which is known as that, but taken by itself contains
no distinction of this and that; if this is all that is meant
by the "in," there is no objection to the use of the statement,
and it is strictly true. The x element is a part of each of the
objects, but, until some addition is made to it, it is not "the x in
this object" or "the x in that object"; it is what they have in
common. The "in common" means just this.

The Nominalistic doctrine that only individuals have real
existence, and that the universal, whatever it may be, is to be
sought in the mind, distinguishes between the spheres of being
and denies to one what it allows to another. Of the extreme
nominalistic position, that the only true universal is the word,
which may be applied indifferently to several distinct objects, I
shall not here speak. I have discussed this wholly untenable
view elsewhere.
[46]
But the more reasonable Nominalism, the
conceptualistic, is worthy of examination here. In so far as it
holds that the mind can form a concept, which shall consist of
the element or elements several objects have in common, we
have no quarrel with it. Here we find a true universal, obtained
by discarding differences which distinguish objects from one
another. We obtain by this that mental core common to several
similar mental objects. If, however, we distinguish between
mental objects and "real" things corresponding to them, we have
evidently two distinct fields to consider. When we say a number
of objects in consciousness are alike, we are simply pointing
out the fact that they contain a universal element as well as
individual differences. Can we say that a number of "real"
objects are alike? If so, what do we mean in saying it? If

[95]

there is nothing to prevent us from calling them individuals,
there would seem to be nothing to prevent us from affirming
that they are "really" alike. Does likeness ever mean anything
except sameness in difference? Is not, then, the element in
which several objects resemble each other a universal element,
whether the objects be mental or "real?" What else does
universal mean? The excuse for speaking ceases when language
ceases to be significant. One does not in the least explain the
similarity, or sameness in the fourth sense, of a number of
"real" objects, by assuming a universal in a quite different
world—one which could not possibly exist in the world of the
objects. This solution of the problem is Platonic. The element
which twenty real objects have in common must be a "real"
element, or it cannot be a constituent part of each object. If it
is not a constituent part of each object, it is absurd to speak of
the objects as having it in common. If they have nothing in
common, it is absurd to say that they are alike. Twenty similar
objects must have a universal element, to whatever sphere of
being they belong; and this element must belong to the same
sphere as the objects. A mental universal is the same with a
"real" universal only in sense seventh, and it can furnish no
explanation of the likeness of "real" things.

In the light of the foregoing analysis a goodly number of the
scholastic arguments regarding universals are easily seen to
contain errors. The Anselmic view of genera and species as
universal substances,
[47]
for instance, makes an abstraction a thing
and distinguishes it from other things. It fails to keep it
abstract. The doctrine attributed to William of Champeaux, by
Abelard, that universals are essentially and wholly present in
each of their individuals, in which latter there is no diversity of
essence, but only variety through accidents,
[48]
is tenable or not

[96]

according to the sense in which the words are taken. The word
"wholly" is an awkward one, and would incline one to the view
that William regarded the universal as a thing, a concrete, which
may be in this place or that. If this were his opinion, and it is
perhaps more reasonable to believe that it was, the objection of
Abelard, that this would necessitate the same thing's being in
different places at the same time, would hold good. If the
essence of humanity be wholly in Socrates, it must be where
Socrates is. It cannot, then, be somewhere else in Plato.
Manifestly humanity, so regarded, is not a universal at all. It
is "this humanity" or "that humanity,"
i. e.
, this or that occurrence
of humanity; and two occurrences of a quality or group
of qualities are two individuals. The word "in" I have shown
to be ambiguous. Any element, regarded as, in one sense,
in

an individual, retains the local flavor which makes universality
impossible. But if William meant nothing more by his statement
than that the element common to the individuals is a
constituent part of each, and that there is in it no distinction
which will allow us to put it part here and part there, the
polemic of Abelard is not justifiable. Whatever he may have
intended to say, there can be no mistake as to the meaning of
the following sentence from Robert Pulleyn: "The species is
the whole substance of individuals, and the whole species is the
same in each individual: therefore the species is one substance,
but its individuals many persons, and these many persons are
that one substance."
[49]
The dialectician represented as saying
this, ought to have been a prey to profound melancholy; his
samenesses are clearly in deplorable confusion. He makes his
universal an individual, and then imposes upon it duties which

[97]

no individual can fulfil with credit. It is to be one and yet not
one: distinct from something else, and yet identical with it.
It is to be a universal and not a universal. It is by no means
to be envied. The conceptualistic position of Abelard, that we
may gain a subjective universal by abstraction, but that only
individuals exist in reality, is open to the objections that I
advanced in discussing Nominalism. The position is supported
[50]

by the argument that we may abstract the form from the substantial
subject to which it is united, and consider it separately,
while in nature there is no such abstraction, the form and the
subject forming a united whole. To this one may answer, as I
have indicated above, that, whatever it may be united with, the
form in the several individuals is in some sense the same, or the
individuals would not be alike, and the concept would be of no
service in representing it. What is meant by such sameness? Is
it anything but sameness in sense fourth? When several objects
are the same in sense fourth, is not the element common to
them a universal? Why make this conceptualistic discrimination
between things in mind and "real" things?

Finally, in passing from scholasticism, I would suggest that it
is conducive to clearness in thinking to bear in mind that when
Albert, or Thomas, or Duns, declares in favor of all three kinds
of universal,
ante rem
,
in re
, and
post rem
, he is declaring for
three things and not one. He is not at all in the position of the
old Platonic Realist; but is rather, if I may so express it, a kind
of triple Aristotelian. One may perfectly well hold to all three
universals, by putting one in the mind of God, one in things, and
one in a human mind; but an individual may be given this three-fold
existence quite as well as a universal. In the old Realism
the problem of the universal called into existence a new sphere
of being. Here a new sphere of being, assumed upon extraneous

[98]

grounds, furnishes one more universal. The universals
in the mind of God are not assumed as the object of the general
name applied to twenty "real" objects. The object of this
name is the
in re
. The
ante rem
universal cannot, then, be gotten
as Plato got it. In this distinction between the different spheres
of being we have an advance in reflection; but as I have said, on
this new ground the individual may demand its rights. The

ante rem
Realism of the great scholastics of the thirteenth century
should not be confounded with that of an earlier period.
It is not open to the same objections. But on the other hand,
it has not the same excuse for existence. It is a historical relic.

Sec. 29.
The first of the moderns to whom I shall refer is
Descartes. There are certain passages in the Meditations which
will well illustrate the efforts made by this remarkable man in
the direction of accurate analysis, as also the errors into which
he fell through a confusion of the kinds of sameness. I shall
quote from the second and third Meditations:

"Let us now accordingly consider the things which are commonly
thought the easiest of all to know, and which are thought
also to be the most distinctly known, that is, the bodies that we
touch and see; not indeed bodies in general, for these general notions
are usually a little more confused: but let us consider a
single one of them. Let us take, for example, this bit of wax;
it has just been taken from the hive; it has not yet lost the
sweetness of the honey it contained; it still keeps something of
the odor of the flowers from which it has been gathered; its
color, its figure, its size, are apparent; it is hard, it is cold, it is
easily handled, and if struck it gives a sound. In a word, everything
that can make a body distinctly known is found in this
one. But notice, while I speak, it is placed near the fire; what
remained of savor and odor disappears, its color changes, its
figure is lost, its size increases, it becomes liquid, grows hot, one
can scarcely handle it, and when struck it no longer gives a

[99]

sound. Does the same wax remain after this change? One
must admit that it does; no one doubts it; no one judges otherwise.
What then was it that was known with so much distinctness
in this bit of wax? Certainly nothing that I perceived by
means of the senses, for all the things which fall under taste,
smell, sight, touch and hearing, are changed, and yet the same
wax remains. Perhaps it was what I think now, namely, that
this wax was neither the sweetness of honey, the agreeable odor
of flowers, the whiteness, the figure, nor the sound, but only a
body which a little before appeared to my senses under these
forms, and which now appears to them under others. But to
speak precisely, what do I imagine when I think it in this way?
Let us consider it attentively, and abstracting all that does not
belong to the wax, let us see what remains. Surely nothing remains
but something extended, flexible and mutable. But what
is that, flexible and mutable? Is it not that I imagine that this
bit of wax, being round, is capable of becoming square and of
changing from square to triangular? No, it is certainly not
that, for I think it capable of an infinite number of similar
changes; but I could not run through this infinite number by
my imagination, and consequently this conception that I have of
the wax is not due to the faculty of imagination. But what now
is this extension? Is it not also unknown? For it becomes
greater when the wax melts, greater when it boils, and still
greater when the heat increases, and I could not conceive clearly
and truly what wax is, if I did not think that even this bit that we
are considering is capable of receiving more varieties of extension
than I have ever imagined. It must then be admitted that I
could not comprehend by imagination even what this bit of wax
is, and that only my understanding can comprehend it. I say
this particular bit of wax; for as for wax in general, it is still
more evident. But what is this bit of wax that cannot be comprehended
save by the understanding or the mind? It is certainly

[100]

the same that I see, that I touch, that I imagine; it is, in
a word, the same that I have always thought it from the beginning.
But, what is important to note here is, that my perception
is not a sensation of sight, nor of touch, nor an act of the
imagination, and it has never been this, although it may have
seemed so before; but it is merely an intuition (
inspection
) of
the mind, which may be imperfect and confused as it was before,
or clear and distinct as it is at present, according as my attention
is directed more or less to the elements in it, and of which
it is composed.

"However, I cannot be too much surprised when I consider
the weakness of my mind and its proneness to be carried insensibly
into error. For even when I consider all this in my own
mind, and without using language, the words arrest me, and I
am almost deceived by the terms in common use; for we say
that we see the same wax if it be present, and not that we judge
that it is the same, from its having the same color and figure;
whence I might be tempted to conclude that one knows the wax
by the sight of the eyes, and not merely by the intuition of the
mind, were it not that, in looking from a window at men passing
in the street, I say that I see men, just as I say that I see the wax;
and yet what do I see from this window except hats and cloaks
which might cover machines moved by springs? But I judge that
they are men, and thus comprehend only by the power of judging,
which is in my mind, what I thought I saw with my eyes."
[51]

[101]

What Descartes is feeling for in this is sameness in sense
third. When we use the words "a bit of wax," we do not have
in mind a single experience. The wax in a solid and the wax in
a liquid state is to us the same wax. I have pointed out what
the word same, so used, means. It means that these two experiences
are recognized as belonging to the one group or series of
experiences; and the wax, completely known, is the sum total of
the series. Descartes saw very well that the two experiences
under discussion are not strictly identical (the same in sense
first), and he saw also that they are very unlike. He naturally
asked, In what then are they the same? or, what is there that is
here the same? And, instead of accepting the fact that such a
sameness as this cannot be reduced to one of the others, he solved
the problem by passing from the experiences, the "hats and
cloaks," to a "real" thing underlying. In other words, to explain
the sameness of two experiences of a bit of wax, sameness
in sense third, he assumed "real" wax, which is the same with
the experiences which represent it only in sense seventh. This
real wax, or something in it, he supposes to remain the same on
two occasions. It is this to which he makes the mind refer when
it calls the wax the same. But when a man advances statements
about a bit of wax, his information rests ultimately upon his
experiences
,
if it be grounded at all. From the experience one infers
the "real" thing, and not
vice versa
. No one knew this better
than Descartes, with his fundamental principle of the certainty
of consciousness and the uncertainty of what is "external." He
got his "real" world by a process of reasoning, and put it in a
realm wholly cut off from direct observation. This being the
case, one cannot but wonder at his inconsistency in the present
instance. Is one to remain in doubt whether a piece of wax felt
to be hard, and then melted before the fire, is the same, until one
has had some means of discovering that the same "real" wax is

[102]

present on the two occasions? How is one to find out whether
"real" wax is ever present unless he infer its presence from
some experience? And how is one to know that the same
"real" wax is present on two occasions unless he infer it from
the fact that what is directly perceived on the two occasions is
the same in some sense of the word? Whatever sameness there
is rests ultimately for its evidence upon the experiences. There
is nothing else to judge from. The reasoning, which would base
the sameness of what is experienced upon the sameness of a
corresponding "real" thing, when the sameness of this latter is
to be inferred from the former, reminds one of the stupid argument,
still occasionally met with, which would infer a God from
data of consciousness, and then found a belief in the veracity of
consciousness upon the goodness of God. One may believe, if
one please, that, when we have two distinct experiences so connected
that we call them two perceptions of the same wax, there
is in some way connected with them a bit of "real" wax which
remains in some sense the same. But one should never suppose
that any given experienced wax is proved the same by reference
to this. It is judged the same upon observation.

Descartes then was inconsistent with his own principles when
he made this jump to a new sphere of being. The sameness of
the experienced object is ultimate; the only pertinent question
is, what does it mean? It means, as I have said, that the wax
hard and the wax soft are the same in sense third. But sameness
in sense third admits of wide dissimilarities in the experiences
it unites into the notion of the one object. Descartes
looked for a sameness without these dissimilarities. He would
reduce sense third to sense first, or, perhaps, to sense second.
To do this he must go behind the experiences to a "real" thing,
which is to remain the same as a proxy for what is evidently
variable. This makeshift is only satisfactory to one who overlooks,

[103]

or allows to fall into the background, the plain fact that
representative and thing represented are two separate things
and not to be confused; that is, who confuses sameness in sense
first with sameness in sense seventh. Descartes distinguished
carefully between ideas and external things, but he sometimes
overlooked the distinction. "But what is this bit of wax that
cannot be comprehended save by the understanding or the mind?
It is certainly the same that I see, that I touch, that I imagine;
it is, in a word, the same that I have always thought it from the
beginning." How ambiguous! is it the same in sense first or
sense seventh? The sentence following would indicate sense
seventh, but the spirit of the whole discussion would argue for
sense first. One must delude oneself into believing that one can
get at "real" wax directly, in some way or other, or one cannot
think of making it an ultimate ground of reasoning. Descartes,
like so many others, would seem to have vibrated between a
clear consciousness that ideas and "real" things are distinct,
belonging to different worlds, and a confused belief that they
belong to the one world, and that "real" things are open to
direct observation.

I shall take still another extract from this author. It contains
similar errors.

"Now, among these ideas, some appear to me to be inborn,
others to be foreign and to come from without, and still others
to be made and invented by myself. For, as to the faculty of
conceiving that which, in general, one calls a thing, or a truth,
or a thought, it appears to me that I do not get that from any
other source than my own nature; but if now I hear a sound, if
I see the sun, if I feel the heat, up to the present I have judged
that these sensations proceed from things which exist without
me; and lastly, it seems to me that syrens, hippogriffs, and all
similar chimeras are fictions and inventions of my mind. But

[104]

perhaps I can persuade myself, that all these ideas belong to the
class of those that I call foreign, and that come to me from without,
or that they are all innate, or else that they are all created
by myself; for I have not yet clearly discovered their true
source. And my chief duty here is to consider, touching those
which seem to come from objects without me, what reasons I
have for thinking them like their objects.

"The first of the reasons is that I seem to be taught to do so
by nature; and the second, that I perceive that these ideas are
not dependent upon my will; for often they present themselves
to me in spite of me, as now, whether I wish it or not, I feel
heat, and consequently am persuaded that this sensation or idea
of heat is produced in me by something different from me, to
wit: by the heat of the fire by which I am sitting. And I cannot
see that anything is more reasonable than to judge that this
external object emits and impresses upon me its resemblance
rather than anything else.

"Now I must see if these reasons are sufficiently strong and
convincing. When I say that I seem to be taught so by nature,
I mean merely by this word nature a certain inclination which
leads me to believe it, and not a natural light which gives me
certain knowledge that it is true. But these two ways of speaking
are very different, for I cannot doubt anything that the
natural light shows me to be true, as it has just shown me that
from the fact of my doubting I may infer my existence; inasmuch
as I have not in me any other faculty or power of distinguishing
the true from the false to teach me that what this light
shows me to be true is not true, and in which I may have as
much confidence as in it. But as concerns inclinations which
also seem to me natural, I have often remarked, when it has been
a question of choice between virtues and vices, that they do not
less incline to evil than to good; it follows that I have no more

[105]

reason to follow them when the true and the false are in question.
And as for the other reason, which is that these ideas
must come from without, since they are not dependent on my
will, I do not find it more convincing. For while these inclinations
of which I have just spoken are in me, notwithstanding
that they are not always in harmony with my will, perhaps there
is in me some faculty or power capable of producing these ideas
without the aid of external things, although it is yet unknown
to me; as indeed it has always seemed to me up to this time that
when I sleep they are thus formed in me without the aid of the
objects they represent. Finally, even should I admit that they
are caused by these objects, it does not necessarily follow that
they must be like them. On the contrary, I have often remarked
in many instances, that there is a great difference between an
object and its idea: as, for example, I find in me two very different
ideas of the sun; the one has its source in the senses,
and should be placed in the class of those which I have said
above come from without, and from this it seems to me very
small; the other has it origin in astronomical reasonings, that is
to say, in certain notions which are inborn, or else formed in
some way or other by myself, and from this it seems to me many
times greater than the whole earth. Surely, these two ideas
which I have of the sun cannot both be like the same sun; and
reason convinces me that the one which is derived directly from
its appearance is the one which is most unlike it. All of
which proves to me that, up to this hour, it has not been by a
sure and premeditated judgment, but merely by a blind and rash
impulse, that I have been led to believe that there are things
without me, and different from my being, which, by the organs
of my senses, or by whatever other means, convey to me their
ideas or images, and impress upon me their resemblances."
[52]

[106]

From the earlier portions of this extract one may see how
clearly Descartes distinguished between the idea, or the thing
immediately known, and the external thing which he assumed
as corresponding to the idea; from the latter part one may see
how he sometimes confounded them. He finds that he may
doubt whether ideas have any external correlatives; and, granting
that they have, whether the two resemble each other at all.
All this would imply that "external" things are completely cut off
from observation. And yet he states with
naÃ¯vetÃ©
that he has
"often remarked in many instances that there is a great difference
between an object and its idea." Now, if this can
really be remarked in many instances, the doubt as to the existence
of objects would seem to be groundless. How can it be
remarked? On this point Descartes is silent. He has evidently
fallen back upon the popular notion that under favorable circumstances
one can get a look at a "real" thing, just as it is. The
"reason" which convinces him that the astronomer's notion of
the sun is the true notion is nothing but this. It could certainly
not be deduced from his only argument for the existence of
external things—the veracity of God. How does he know, that
in giving us several different ideas of the sun, God has chosen
to have this one only resemble it? It is a pure assumption.
Reason is of service when one has something to go upon; but
in the absence of premises it will not carry one far. This
assumption is an illustration of what I had occasion to remark
upon in criticizing Pyrrho; of the fact that, from the series of possible
perceptions which we group together as one object, we are
apt to select one, to us for some reason the most satisfactory
one, and to regard it as more truly representing the object than
the others. Descartes has followed this impulse, and made this
perception the best representative of the "real" object. Had
he always distinguished sameness in sense first from sameness

[107]

in sense seventh, he would have seen how purely gratuitous is
his assumption.

The statement, too, that two different ideas of the sun cannot
both resemble the same sun, shows how little he comprehended
what it meant by the word same when used in the third sense.
If by the sun we mean a whole series of possible perceptions,
perhaps quite unlike each other, but all united and related in
certain ways, there is nothing to prevent very dissimilar things
from being like the same sun. Each of them need only resemble
a single link in the series. By the words "the same sun"
Descartes meant the same in sense first, but this sins against
the proper meaning of the term. The difficulty is self-created.

Descartes' sun reminds me of Berkeley's moon. This latter
writer clearly perceived that there may be multiplicity and diversity
where one attributes sameness in sense third. Note the
following:

"But for a fuller explication of this point, and to show that
the immediate objects of sight are not so much as the ideas or
resemblances of things placed at a distance, it is requisite that
we look nearer into the matter, and carefully observe what is
meant in common discourse when one says that which he sees
is at a distance from him. Suppose, for example, that looking at
the moon I should say it were fifty or sixty semidiameters of the
earth distant from me. Let us see what moon this is spoken of.
It is plain it cannot be the visible moon, or anything like the
visible moon, or that I see—which is only a round, luminous
plain, of about thirty visible points in diameter. For, in case I
am carried from the place where I stand directly toward the
moon, it is manifest the object varies still as I go on; and, by
the time that I am advanced fifty or sixty semidiameters of the
earth, I shall be so far from being near a small, round, luminous
flat that I shall perceive nothing like it—this object having long

[108]

since disappeared, and, if I would recover it, it must be by going
back to the earth from whence I set out."
[53]

So much for dissimilar experiences of the same object. And
Berkeley is not impelled to assume an external something to
explain how the object can be the same under the circumstances.
The case, he finds, stands thus:

"Having of a long time experienced certain ideas perceivable
by touch—as distance, tangible figure, and solidity—to have been
connected with certain ideas of sight, I do, upon perceiving these
ideas of sight, forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are, by the
wonted ordinary course of nature, like to follow. Looking at
an object, I perceive a certain visible figure and color, with some
degree of faintness and other circumstances, which, from what I
have formerly observed, determine me to think that if I advance
forward so many paces, miles, etc., I shall be affected with such
and such ideas of touch."
[54]

And need one ask a clearer illustration of sameness in sense
third than the case of the coach, which occurs in the following
section:

"Sitting in my study I hear a coach drive along the street; I
look through the casement and see it; I walk out and enter into
it. Thus, common speech would incline one to think I heard, saw,
and touched the same thing, to wit, the coach. It is, nevertheless,
certain the ideas intromitted by each sense are widely different
and distinct from each other; but, having been observed constantly
to go together, they are spoken of as one and the same
thing."

Sec. 30.
It would be easy to select from Spinoza, that master
of reasonings apparently very exact but really very loose, many
good instances of confused samenesses. I shall confine myself

[109]

to a single one, his argument to prove that every substance is
necessarily infinite. It is the eighth proposition in Part I of the
Ethics.

"There cannot be more than one substance with the same
attribute, and this exists of its own nature. It belongs, then, to
its nature to exist either as finite or as infinite. But it cannot be
finite, for then it would have to be limited by another of the same
kind, which would also necessarily exist; there would then be
two substances with the same attribute, which is absurd. It is,
therefore, infinite."
[55]

Among its defects this argument includes a confusion of sameness
in sense fourth with sameness in sense first. Attribute
Spinoza has defined as that which is conceived as the essence of
substance. Mode is a modification of substance. Two substances,
he has argued, cannot be distinguished from each other
by their modifications, for substance is prior to its modifications,
and we may set these aside and consider it as it is in itself. Substances
cannot then, be distinguished except by their attributes;
and if the attribute be the same, how can we say that there are
two substances? There cannot, consequently, be two substances
with the same attribute.

But, the argument continues, since there cannot be two substances
with the same attribute, every substance must be infinite;
for, to be finite, a thing must be limited by something: and nothing
can be limited except by a thing of the same kind (for example,
a material thing cannot be limited by a thought). But if
a thing be limited by another thing of the same kind, the thing
limited and the thing limiting have the same attribute. It follows

[110]

that they are not two things, but one. The thing in question
is not limited but infinite.

In criticizing this, I may call attention, in passing, to the
highly disputable and gratuitously assumed premise, that, to be
finite, a thing must be limited by
something
. If this be denied,
the ground of the reasoning is removed; while, if it be granted,
no argument is needed to prove that something is infinite, for one
has only said in other words that all limits must be limits within
something. The question is begged at once. With this, however,
I am not concerned. What interests me is this: The argument
assumes a limited thing and a something beyond it, and
then asserts that they are one. But two things of the same kind
in different places, or marked as different by distinctions of any
sort, are readily distinguished as two. To come to the concrete,
extension conceived as on this side of a point and extension conceived
as beyond the point are not extension simply, but "this"
extension and "that" extension. They are the same only in
sense fourth, not in sense first. We have here not merely the
attribute extension, but the further elements "this" and "that."
The conclusion, then, that what we started out with is infinite,
is wholly unwarranted. It is not this that is infinite, but this
with something else which is to some degree like it, although
not wholly so. That is to say, the thing assumed as finite can
only be proved to be infinite by confounding two samenesses.
The thing proved to be infinite is a new object including it and
what it is assumed to presuppose. If it be not permissible to make
this distinction between the object assumed as finite, for the
sake of the argument, and the object which is proved to be infinite,
it is also not permissible to assert that an object to be
finite "would have to be limited by another of the same kind."
If the two are one, these words are meaningless. If they are not
one, one cannot conclude from the argument that every substance

[111]

is necessarily infinite, but only that something is necessarily
infinite, a conclusion already given in the single premise
that what is limited must be limited by something of the same
kind. As a matter of fact, Spinoza retains in his argument
not only the attribute, but the mode, the "this" and the "beyond
this;" and then he overlooks the mode and considers
merely the attribute, which gives him strict identity. This procedure
we have met before in the dispute concerning universals.

Sec. 31.
In the former part of my monograph I have mentioned
Locke's confusion of sameness in sense seventh with
sameness in sense first. I shall now quote a few sections from
the "Essay concerning Human Understanding" to show how
significant his error is, and to what an extent it is responsible
for his position regarding ideas, things, and substance. My
extracts are from the eleventh chapter of the fourth book,
entitled "Of our Knowledge of the Existence of Other Things."
Locke argues as follows:
[56]

"The knowledge of our own being we have by intuition.
The existence of a God reason clearly makes known to us, as
has been shown.

"The knowledge of the existence of any other thing we can
have only by sensation: for there being no necessary connection
of real existence with any idea a man hath in his memory, nor
of any other existence but that of God, with the existence of
any particular man; no particular man can know the existence
of any other being, but only when by actual operating upon him
it makes itself perceived by him. For the having the idea of
anything in our mind no more proves the existence of that thing,
than the picture of a man evidences his being in the world, or
the visions of a dream make thereby a true history.

"It is therefore the actual receiving of ideas from without,
that gives us notice of the existence of other things, and makes

[112]

us know that something doth exist at that time without us,
which causes that idea in us, though perhaps we neither know
nor consider how it does it: for it takes not from the certainty
of our senses, and the ideas we receive by them, that we know
not the manner wherein they are produced,
v. g.
, whilst I write
this I have, by the paper affecting my eyes, that idea produced
in my mind which, whatever object causes, I call white; by which
I know that that quality or accident (
i. e.
, whose appearance
before my eyes always causes that idea) doth really exist, and
hath a being without me. And of this, the greatest assurance I
can possibly have, and to which my faculties can attain, is the
testimony of my eyes, which are the proper and sole judges of
this thing, whose testimony I have reason to rely on as so certain,
that I can no more doubt, whilst I write this, that I see
white and black, and that something really exists that causes that
sensation in me, than that I write or move my hand: which is a
certainty as great as human nature is capable of, concerning the
existence of anything but a man's self alone, and of God.

"The notice we have by our senses of the existing of things
without us, though it be not altogether so certain as our intuitive
knowledge, or the deductions of our reason, employed about
the clear abstract ideas of our own minds; yet it is an assurance
that deserves the name of knowledge. If we persuade ourselves
that our faculties act and inform us right, concerning the existence
of those objects that affect them, it cannot pass for an
ill-grounded confidence: for I think nobody can, in earnest, be
so sceptical as to be uncertain of the existence of those things
which he sees and feels. At least, he that can doubt so far
(whatever he may have with his own thoughts) will never have
any controversy with me; since he can never be sure I say anything
contrary to his own opinion. As to myself, I think God
has given me assurance enough of the existence of things without

[113]

me; since by their different application I can produce in
myself both pleasure and pain, which is one great concernment
of my present state. This is certain, the confidence that our
faculties do not herein deceive us is the greatest assurance we
are capable of, concerning the existence of material beings. For
we cannot act anything but by our faculties; nor talk of knowledge
itself, but by the helps of those faculties which are fitted
to apprehend even what knowledge is. But besides the assurance
we have from our senses themselves, that they do not err
in the information they give us, of the existence of things without
us, when they are affected by them, we are farther confirmed
in this assurance by other concurrent reasons.

"First, it is plain those perceptions are produced in us by
exterior causes affecting our senses: because those that want the
organs of any sense never can have the ideas belonging to that
sense produced in their minds. This is too evident to be doubted:
and therefore we cannot but be assured that they come in by
the organs of that sense, and no other way. The organs themselves,
it is plain, do not produce them; for then the eyes of a
man in the dark would produce colors, and his nose smell roses
in the winter: but we see nobody gets the relish of a pine apple
till he goes to the Indies, where it is, and tastes it.

"Secondly, because sometimes I find that I cannot avoid the
having those ideas produced in my mind. For though when my
eyes are shut, or windows fast, I can at pleasure recall to my
mind the ideas of light, or the sun, which former sensations had
lodged in my memory; so I can at pleasure lay by that idea, and
take into my view that of the smell of a rose, or taste of sugar.
But if I turn my eyes at noon towards the sun, I cannot avoid
the ideas which the light, or sun, then produces in me. So that
there is a manifest difference between the ideas laid up in my
memory (over which, if they were there only, I should have

[114]

constantly the same power to dispose of them, and lay them by
at pleasure), and those which force themselves upon me, and I
cannot avoid having. And therefore it must needs be some
exterior cause, and the brisk acting of some objects without me,
whose efficacy I cannot resist, that produces those ideas in my
mind, whether I will or no. Besides, there is nobody who doth
not perceive the difference in himself between contemplating
the sun, as he hath the idea of it in his memory, and actually
looking upon it; of which two his perception is so distinct, that
few of his ideas are more distinguishable one from another.
And therefore, he hath certain knowledge, that they are not both
memory, or the actions of his mind, and fancies only within
him; but that actual seeing hath a cause without.

"Thirdly, add to this, that many of those ideas are produced
in us with pain, which afterward we remember without the least
offense. Thus the pain of heat or cold, when the idea of it is
revived in our minds, gives us no disturbance; which, when felt,
was very troublesome, and is again when actually repeated;
which is occasioned by the disorder the external object causes
in our bodies when applied to it. And we remember the pains
of hunger, thirst, or the headache, without any pain at all; which
would either never disturb us, or else constantly do it, as often
as we thought of it, were there nothing more but ideas floating
in our minds, and appearances entertaining our fancies, without
the real existence of things affecting us from abroad. The same
may be said of pleasure accompanying several actual sensations,
and though mathematical demonstrations depend not upon
sense, yet the examining them by diagrams gives great credit to
the evidence of our sight, and seems to give it a certainty
approaching to that of demonstration itself. For it would be
very strange that a man should allow it for an undeniable truth,
that two angles of a figure, which he measures by lines and

[115]

angles of a diagram, should be bigger one than the other; and yet
doubt of the existence of those lines and angles, which by looking
on he makes use of to measure that by.

"Fourthly, our senses in many cases bear witness to the truth
of each other's report, concerning the existence of sensible
things without us. He that sees a fire may, if he doubt whether
it be anything more than a bare fancy, feel it too; and be convinced
by putting his hand in it: which certainly could never be
put into such exquisite pain by a bare idea or phantom, unless
that the pain, be a fancy too, which yet he cannot, when the
burn is well, by raising the idea of it, bring upon himself again.

"Thus I see, whilst I write this, I can change the appearance
of the paper: and by designing the letters tell beforehand what
new idea it shall exhibit the very next moment, by barely drawing
my pen over it: which will neither appear (let me fancy as
much as I will), if my hands stand still; or though I move my
pen, if my eyes be shut: nor, when those characters are once
made on the paper, can I choose afterward but see them as they
are: that is, have the ideas of such letters as I have made.
Whence it is manifest, that they are not barely the sport and
play of my own imagination, when I find that the characters that
were made at the pleasure of my own thought, do not obey them;
nor yet cease to be, whenever I shall fancy it; but continue to
affect the senses constantly and regularly, according to the
figures I made them. To which if we will add, that the sight of
those shall, from another man, draw such sounds as I beforehand
design they shall stand for; there will be little reason left to
doubt that those words I write do really exist without me, when
they cause a long series of regular sounds to affect my ears,
which could not be the effect of my imagination, nor could my
memory retain them in that order."

This is quite a long citation, but I have given it at length
because it may stand as the type of by far the greater part of

[116]

the objections urged against Idealism, and because a better
instance of the confusion of two samenesses could scarcely be
desired. Notice how constantly it is assumed that the thing
given in perception is the "real" thing, a thing which is, nevertheless,
characterized as distinct from, and the cause of, the idea.

At the outset Locke distinguishes well enough between the
idea and the "external" thing. The having the idea of any thing
in the mind, he declares, no more proves the existence of that
thing than the picture of a man evidences his being in the world.
It is only the receiving of ideas from without that gives us notice
of things as causes of the ideas. It would seem quite fair here
to ask how we know that some ideas come from without? Of
course, if the realm of the "without" were open to inspection,
the question could be answered at once. But it is not open to
inspection—certainly not to a consistent Lockian. How, then,
may I distinguish ideas coming from without from other ideas?
No ideas are perceived until they are what Locke would call
"within."

The appeal to the testimony of the eyes needs examination.
To what eyes does one appeal? The immediately known or
idea-eyes, or the "external" organs whose existence is the matter
of dispute? Surely not to the last, for it is only as a result
of the argument that we may assume these at all. And what
hand is it so certain that I move in writing? The complex of
ideas immediately known, or the something beyond, whose existence
is to be established? If it be the latter, all discussion is
unnecessary. If, on the other hand, the eyes and the hand concerned
are ideas, it is not clear how the appeal to them can be of
any service. Does a sense give anything but sensations? And
if the very sense organ as immediately known be a group of sensations,
how can the testimony of a sense land one in a world
beyond that of sensations? And the argument that God has

[117]

given me assurance of the existence of things without me, since
by applying them to myself I can produce in myself pain and
pleasure, presupposes that I can apply such things to myself and
know that I am doing so. If this be the fact, it is trifling to discuss
whether things I move to and fro exist. If, however, it is
still to be proved that there are such things, and that they are
moved to and fro, the argument is wholly baseless. Locke here
makes appeal to the common experience that certain objects
applied to the body cause pleasure, and certain others pain; a
fact which no reasonable man would think of denying or questioning,
as it is matter of daily observation. But in such experiences,
all that is immediately evident is that an object immediately
perceived (Locke's idea) is applied to another object
immediately perceived (idea) with a resulting (idea) pain.
Whether or not certain duplicates of the things immediately
known are brought into a peculiar conjunction at the same time
is wholly problematic, and would seem to remain so until some
evidence be advanced of the existence of such duplicates. This
argument on the part of our author shows most clearly that for
the time being he lost the distinction between ideas and "real"
things. They are the same in sense seventh; he assumed them
to be the same in sense first. He falls into this error again and
again.

The general appeal to the testimony of the senses is followed
by four special arguments. According to the first of these, it is
plain that perceptions are produced in us by exterior causes
affecting our senses, "because those that want the organs of
any sense never can have the ideas belonging to that sense produced
in their minds." This is supposed to prove that they
come in by the organs of that sense, and in no other way. But
here again one may ask, What is meant by the organs of any
sense? If the "real" external organ be meant, one may object

[118]

that its existence has not yet been proved. If the organ immediately
known be meant, one has only called attention to the fact
that certain ideas are a
sine qua non
to the existence of certain
other ideas. How this tends to prove the existence of something
distinct from ideas is not apparent. Locke's impulse in
this argument finds its source in our common experience that
bodily organs immediately perceived are proved by observation
to be prerequisites to the experiencing of ideas. We see a
given object in a certain relation to a normal human body, and
we infer an idea of the object connected with that body. We
say the man has an idea of the object, and can only infer the
object itself. We connect the idea with some particular part of
his body, and regard this as the medium through which he gains
the idea. All this is reasonable enough. It is well to remember,
however, that in all this the "real" object is not observed
to play any part. The object which I certainly see in relation
to the body which I certainly see is what Locke would call an
idea. The man's body is an idea. The idea which I assume the
man to have is to me, if I remain within the sphere of the observable,
an idea of the (idea) object I see. If I am to get any
"real" object at all it is not by reference to observation or experience.
If I am to get it by inference, some ground must be
furnished for inference. Again Locke has confounded the
observable with the "real." It is only on this ground that the
appeal to the sense organ has any force.

The second and the third arguments busy themselves to show
that there are unmistakable differences between ideas which
have their origin in the "brisk acting" of objects without and
ideas of memory or imagination. The two classes are shown
to be distinct, and it is very properly held that ideas of different
kinds should not be confounded. But the statement, that ideas
may be divided into two classes, is a very different one from the

[119]

statement that the two classes differ in that one has external
correlates and the other has not. One may admit all the distinctions
which Locke makes in the field of ideas; and, it being
once proved that such distinctions imply a world of "real"
things in relation to certain ideas, may grant very readily that
these ideas have corresponding to them "real" things, or that
ideas caused by "real" things differ by such and such marks
from other ideas. But, until it be proved that the marks in question
do give a right to infer "real" things, it should not be
assumed that any given class of ideas is caused by "real" things.
What is to be discovered is assumed. And it is assumed here,
as above, because Locke could not keep distinct the two classes
of things. He is capable of saying, "But if I turn my eyes at
noon towards the sun, I cannot avoid the ideas which the light,
or sun, then produces in me," when the whole dispute is over
the question whether there be a "real" sun toward which "real"
eyes may be turned. How does he know that he is turning his
eyes toward the sun? Does he not see it up there? Is he not
"actually looking upon it?" His error is too plain to overlook.
But if one could doubt his confusion of the two suns, the apparent
and the "real," his illustration from the diagrams used in
mathematical demonstration would lay the doubt once for all.
"Real" lines exist, "for it would be very strange that a man
should allow it for an undeniable truth, that two angles of a
figure, which he measures by lines and angles of a diagram,
should be bigger one than the other; and yet doubt of the existence
of those lines and angles, which by looking on he makes
use of to measure that by." The English is not as bad as the
reasoning.

The fourth argument is derived from the fact that one sense
supports the testimony of another. "He that sees a fire may,
if he doubt whether it be anything more than a bare fancy, feel

[120]

it too." A bare fancy, Locke is sure, would not cause such acute
pain. This comes back to the second and third arguments and
may be criticized in the same way. If one could refer to a
single observation of the fact that "real" things do not accompany
ideas of the fancy and that they do accompany ideas of a
different class, the argument would be unobjectionable. Wanting
this observation, or something to take its place, nothing is
proved. And as to the senses helping each other to "real"
things, if each sense only gives the idea appropriate to it, it is
not easy to see how two together prove more than one alone.
In this section, too, Locke is assuming that "real" things belong
to the world of things immediately perceived. He can, he says,
make what characters he pleases on the paper before him, but
once having made them, cannot choose but see them as they are.
"Whence it is manifest, that they are not barely the sport and
play of my own imagination, when I find that the characters
that were made at the pleasure of my own thought, do not obey
them; nor yet cease to be, whenever I shall fancy it; but continue
to affect the senses constantly and regularly, according to
the figures I made them." That is, the ideas which he concludes
not to be ideas of imagination are the things "which
continue to affect the senses," or the "real" things. There is
little wonder that this author believed in "real" things.

Sec. 32.
Excellent work has been done by Berkeley in distinguishing
samenesses. His treatment of sameness in sense
third I have already quoted. His discussion of the infinite
divisibility of finite lines,
[57]
a matter of which I shall speak more
fully later, again brings out sense third. Almost his whole
philosophy consists in the endeavor to keep clearly in mind the
significance of sense seventh, and to develop what it implies.
On the other hand, he has fallen into the error of confusing

[121]

sense first and sense sixth, and of using this confusion to
silence an objection to his doctrine.

He takes up in the "Principles," for the purpose of refuting
it, the objection that his doctrine makes things every moment
annihilated and created anew.
[58]
This, he argues, "will not be
found reasonably charged on the principles we have premised,
so as in truth to make any objection at all against our notions.
For, though we hold indeed the objects of sense to be nothing
else but ideas which cannot exist unperceived; yet we may not
hence conclude they have no existence except only while they
are perceived by us, since there may be some other spirit that
perceives them though we do not. Wherever bodies are said
to have no existence without the mind, I would not be understood
to mean this or that particular mind, but all minds
whatsoever. It does not therefore follow from the foregoing
principles that bodies are annihilated and created every moment,
or exist not at all during the intervals between our perception
of them."

To the reader of Mill it is clear enough that Berkeley is not
content to assume potential existence as an integral part of the
life history of an object. It seems odd that he should not do
so, as he has himself pointed out the double sense of the word
exist.
[59]
However, he demands actual existence. Any lapse in
the actual existence of the immediate object seems to him a
destruction of the object. He has the common feeling that it
is contrary to nature that things should be destroyed and created
from moment to moment. They must exist continuously. They
evidently do not actually exist continuously in the one mind.
So he assumes that, during the periods of their absence from
one mind, they must exist in another: otherwise they could not
be said to exist at all.

[122]

Of course, all this assumes that the objects in one mind are
identically (sense first) the objects in another. If they be
recognized as two distinct things, belonging to different worlds—worlds
so different that what is in one can enter the
other only through its representative—the whole argument is
seen to be fallacious. One can no more make a consistent whole
of elements taken from two different consciousnesses, than one
can piece out a grief with a smell. The attempt is the result of
overlooking the duality implied in sameness in sense sixth.

Sec. 33.
There is a clear and forcible passage in John Stuart
Mill's "System of Logic," in which he distinguishes certain
samenesses from certain others. It is to be regretted that he
dismissed the subject with so slight an examination, for it could
not but have gained by a careful analysis at the hands of this
keen man. I quote more particularly to bring out what Mill
has to say about sameness in sense second.

"While speaking of resemblance, it is necessary to take notice
of an ambiguity of language, against which scarcely any one is
sufficiently on his guard. Resemblance, when it exists in the
highest degree of all, amounting to undistinguishableness, is
often called identity, and the two similar things are said to be
the same. I say often, not always; for we do not say that two
visible objects, two persons, for instance, are the same, because
they are so much alike that one might be mistaken for the
other: but we constantly use this mode of expression when
speaking of feelings; as when I say that the sight of any object
gives me the
same
sensation or emotion to-day that it did yesterday,
or the
same
which it gives to some other person. This
is evidently an incorrect application of the word
same
; for the
feeling which I had yesterday is gone, never to return; what I
have to-day is another feeling, exactly like the former, perhaps,
but distinct from it; and it is evident that two different persons

[123]

cannot be experiencing the same feeling, in the sense in which
we say that they are both sitting at the same table. By a similar
ambiguity we say, that two persons are ill of the
same
disease;
that two persons hold the
same
office; not in the sense in which
we say that they are engaged in the same adventure, or sailing
in the same ship, but in the sense that they fill offices exactly
similar, though, perhaps, in distant places. Great confusion of
ideas is often produced, and many fallacies engendered, in otherwise
enlightened understandings, by not being sufficiently alive
to the fact (in itself not always to be avoided), that they use the
same name to express ideas so different as those of identity and
undistinguishable resemblance."
[60]

It will be seen that Mill here draws a line between sameness
in sense first and the samenesses in which there is an element of
duality. He also draws attention to the fact—a fact to which
I have already referred—that successive mental elements, considered
in themselves, are more likely to be confounded than
material things, though these last may be quite as closely similar.
Language shows how men overlook the duality of two
similar feelings which differ only in time. They may speak of
two similar objects as the same, as they frequently do, and yet
they will not usually lose the sense of their twoness. They say

these
objects are the same. But when they compare a feeling
experienced to-day with one experienced yesterday, they say

this
is the same feeling I had yesterday. There is nothing in
the language used to indicate duality at all.

I have said that, in the extract given, a line is drawn between
samenesses which imply duality and the sameness which
does not; and yet such illustrations are used to represent the
latter as a man, a table, and a ship—objects which are the same
in sense third as well as in sense first, and which consequently

[124]

imply duality, in some sense of the word. But, if one is not considering
single members of the chain of experiences which, taken
together, we call a man, but is considering the whole group as a
unit, this difficulty disappears. This is evidently what Mill has
in mind, and he cannot be taxed with inconsistency. One may,
however, object to the statement that it is an improper use of
the word same to speak of things merely similar as the same.
The word has many meanings, and we can hardly say that any
one of them is illegitimate. It is merely illegitimate to confound
them. And one should not take quite literally the description of
resemblance in the highest degree as "amounting to undistinguishableness."
Strict undistinguishableness removes all duality,
and consequently makes impossible what we call resemblance
or similarity. To be similar, things must be distinguished as
two. Finally, one may object to a treatment of samenesses
which merely groups them into two classes, when there are at
least seven kinds that should, in the interests of clear thinking,
be kept separate. It is only by carefully marking such distinctions
that fallacious reasonings are to be avoided. As, however,
this discussion of samenesses is merely a side issue where it occurs
in the Logic, it would perhaps be unjust to blame Mill for not
going into it more fully.

Sec. 34.
At this point I leave the realms of the dead and
emerge into the land of the living. The errors that I have
been criticizing still live, and it would not be difficult to glean a
goodly number of them from the authors of our day. I shall be
moderate, and will content myself with one or two representative
instances.

It would be surprising if as loose and incautious a reasoner as
Mr. Herbert Spencer did not furnish some examples of confused
samenesses. To certain of his errors in this direction I have
briefly referred in the earlier part of my monograph. Here I

[125]

shall treat of him a little more at length, though even here it is
impossible to do justice to the subject, as that would involve
my quoting and commenting upon at least a large part of the
first division of the "First Principles." I shall take only the
conclusion of the argument by which he establishes the existence
of his "Unknowable," or "Inscrutable Power," or "Ultimate
Cause," or "Unseen Reality," or "Absolute." This contains
two confusions of no little significance. Mr. Spencer
writes:

"Hence our firm belief in objective reality—a belief which metaphysical
criticisms cannot for a moment shake. When we are
taught that a piece of matter, regarded by us as existing externally,
cannot be really known, but that we can know only certain
impressions produced on us, we are yet, by the relativity of our
thought, compelled to think of these in relation to a positive
cause—the notion of a real existence which generated these impressions
becomes nascent. If it be proved to us that every
notion of a real existence which we can frame is utterly inconsistent
with itself—that matter, however conceived by us, cannot
be matter as it actually is, our conception, though transfigured,
is not destroyed: there remains the sense of reality,
dissociated as far as possible from those special forms under
which it was before represented in thought. Though Philosophy
condemns successively each attempted conception of the Absolute—though
it proves to us that the Absolute is not this, nor
that, nor that—though in obedience to it we negative, one after
another, each idea as it arises; yet, as we cannot expel the entire
contents of consciousness, there ever remains behind an element
which passes into new shapes. The continual negation of each
particular form and limit, simply results in the more or less complete
abstraction of all forms and limits; and so ends in an indefinite
consciousness of the unformed and unlimited.

[126]

"And here we come face to face with the ultimate difficulty—How
can there possibly be constituted a consciousness of the
unformed and unlimited, when, by its very nature, consciousness
is possible only under forms and limits? If every consciousness
of existence is a consciousness of existence as conditioned,
then how, after the negation of conditions, can there be
any residuum? Though not directly withdrawn by the withdrawal
of its conditions, must not the raw material of consciousness
be withdrawn by implication? Must it not vanish when
the conditions of its existence vanish? That there must be a
solution of this difficulty is manifest; since even those who
would put it, do, as already shown, admit that we have some such
consciousness; and the solution appears to be that above
shadowed forth. Such consciousness is not, and cannot be,
constituted by any single mental act; but is the product of
many mental acts. In each concept there is an element
which persists. It is alike impossible for this element to
be absent from consciousness, and for it to be present in
consciousness alone: either alternative involves unconsciousness—the
one from the want of the substance; the other from
the want of the form. But the persistence of this element
under successive conditions,
necessitates
a sense of it as distinguished
from the conditions, and independent of them. The
sense of a something that is conditioned in every thought, cannot
be got rid of, because the something cannot be got rid of.
How then must the sense of this something be constituted?
Evidently by combining successive concepts deprived of their
limits and conditions. We form this indefinite thought, as we
form many of our definite thoughts, by the coalescence of a
series of thoughts. Let me illustrate this: A large complex
object, having attributes too numerous to be represented at
once, is yet tolerably well conceived by the union of several representations,

[127]

each standing for part of its attributes. On thinking
of a piano, there first rises in imagination its visual appearance,
to which are instantly added (though by separate mental
acts) the ideas of its remote side and of its solid substance. A
complete conception, however, involves the strings, the hammers,
the dampers, the pedals; and while successively adding
these to the conception, the attributes first thought of lapse more
or less completely out of consciousness. Nevertheless, the
whole group constitutes a representation of the piano. Now as
in this case we form a definite concept of a special existence, by
imposing limits and conditions in successive acts; so, in the converse
case, by taking away the limits and conditions in successive
acts, we form an indefinite notion of general existence. By
fusing a series of states of consciousness, in each of which, as it
arises, the limitations and conditions are abolished, there is produced
a consciousness of something unconditioned. To speak
more rigorously:—this consciousness is not the abstract of any
one group of thoughts, ideas, or conceptions; but it is the
abstract of
all
thoughts, ideas, or conceptions. That which is
common to them all, and cannot be got rid of, is what we predicate
by the word existence. Dissociated as this becomes from
each of its modes by the perpetual change of those modes, it
remains as an indefinite consciousness of something constant
under all modes—of being apart from its appearances. The
distinction we feel between special and general existence, is the
distinction between that which is changeable in us, and that
which is unchangeable. The contrast between the Absolute and
the Relative in our minds, is really the contrast between that
mental element which exists absolutely, and those which exist
relatively.

"By its very nature, therefore, this ultimate mental element is
at once necessarily indefinite and necessarily indestructible.

[128]

Our consciousness of the unconditioned being literally the
unconditioned consciousness, or raw material of thought to
which in thinking we give definite forms, it follows that an ever-present
sense of real existence is the very basis of our intelligence.
As we can in successive mental acts get rid of all particular
conditions and replace them by others, but cannot get
rid of that undifferentiated substance of consciousness which is
conditioned anew in every thought; there ever remains with us
a sense of that which exists persistently and independently of
conditions. At the same time that by the laws of thought we
are rigorously prevented from forming a conception of absolute
existence; we are by the laws of thought equally prevented from
ridding ourselves of the consciousness of absolute existence: this
consciousness being, as we here see, the obverse of our self-consciousness.
And since the only possible measure of relative
validity among our beliefs, is the degree of their persistence in
opposition to the efforts made to change them, it follows that
this which persists at all times, under all circumstances, and cannot
cease until consciousness ceases, has the highest validity of
any.

"To sum up this somewhat too elaborate argument:—We
have seen how in the very assertion that all our knowledge,
properly so called, is Relative, there is involved the assertion
that there exists a Non-relative. We have seen how, in each
step of the argument by which this doctrine is established, the
same assumption is made. We have seen how, from the very
necessity of thinking in relations, it follows that the Relative is
itself inconceivable, except as related to a real Non-relative.
We have seen that unless a real Non-relative or Absolute be
postulated, the Relative itself becomes absolute; and so brings
the argument to a contradiction. And on contemplating the
process of thought, we have equally seen how impossible it is to

[129]

get rid of the consciousness of an actuality lying behind appearances;
and how, from this impossibility, results our indestructible
belief in that actuality."
[61]

Such an extract as this is very tempting to the critic, but I
shall try not to be drawn into criticisms which do not immediately
concern my purpose in quoting. The points which chiefly
interest me are Mr. Spencer's evident confusion of sameness in
sense seventh with sameness in sense first, and of sameness in
sense second with sameness in sense first. I shall begin with the
first confusion.

Every careful reader of the extract given above must see that
the Absolute with which Mr. Spencer's argument is concerned is
an Absolute in consciousness. It is "an indefinite consciousness,"
"raw material of consciousness," an "indefinite
thought," an "abstract of
all
thoughts, ideas, or conceptions."
It is the element of existence which is common to all these
thoughts, ideas, or conceptions. If there could be any doubt as
to the nature of this Absolute in which the argument results, it
should be set at rest by the very emphatic statement that "our
consciousness of the unconditioned" is "literally the unconditioned
consciousness, or raw material of thought to which in
thinking we give definite forms." It is this "undifferentiated
substance of consciousness which is conditional anew in every
thought" that remains with us as an Absolute through all
forms of the conditioned.

Now this Absolute, the element of existence which accompanies
all other elements in consciousness, is the only one with
which the argument has at all concerned itself, and yet this is
evidently not the Absolute in which the author is chiefly interested.
There can be no good reason for calling this Absolute
either Unknowable, Incomprehensible, or Inscrutable. It is not

[130]

a "Power" for it is simply the element of existence, nor is it a
"Reality," for the "abstract of
all
thoughts, ideas, or conceptions"
must be common to the unreal or imaginary as well as to
the real. It is (mental) existence pure and simple. If the argument
be good, this element is known completely and just as it is;
indefinitely, it is true, but then it is indefinite, and if known
definitely would not be known as it is. There is nothing
farther about it to know. It is in no sense Unknowable. If
the objection be to the use of the word "know" where the
knowledge is indefinite, we should invent some word to apply to
an indefinite consciousness; but such consciousness, if denied
to be knowledge, should not be classed with ignorance. Moreover,
as knowledge is of all degrees of definiteness, we should
need a series of words to express the gradations. The series
would be a long one.

But the Absolute which interests Mr. Spencer, and which
throws that halo of the mysterious about his philosophy, is a
something distinct from the Absolute in consciousness, and not
known as it is. It is by no means that which is common to
"impressions" made upon us, but the something assumed to
make these impressions. It is "under," "apart from," and
"behind" appearances and modes—which an Absolute, which is
simply that which is common to appearances and modes, cannot
be. Phenomena (the things immediately known) are only
"a manifestation of some Power by which we are acted upon,"
[62]

and this Absolute cannot take its place among phenomena, as
the former must. The two Absolutes are, indeed, quite distinct
things: one of them, the one in consciousness, has been shown
to exist; no argument is forthcoming to prove the existence of
the other. Manifestly it is not immediately known, for then it
would be a phenomenon, however indefinite. Upon what ground
is it inferred? It is the old problem of Descartes and Locke.

[131]

This problem Mr. Spencer solves in the same way as they, by
assuming the "external" object to be given immediately; but
there is this important difference, that whereas Descartes and
Locke fall into the error from inadvertence, the author of the
"First Principles" and the "Principles of Psychology" embraces
it deliberately. The two earlier writers were sometimes
able to recognize as two things a something in consciousness
and an assumed something without. They confused
them only now and then. Mr. Spencer has been unable to distinguish
them with clearness at any time, and he elevates the
confusion into a principle.

"The postulate with which metaphysical reasoning sets out, is
that we are primarily conscious only of our sensations—that we
certainly know we have these, and that if there be anything beyond
these serving as cause for them, it can be known only by
inference from them.

"I shall give much surprise to the metaphysical reader if I
call in question this postulate; and the surprise will rise into
astonishment if I distinctly deny it. Yet I must do this. Limiting
the proposition to those epi-peripheral feelings produced in
us by external objects (for these are alone in question) I see no
alternative but to affirm that the thing primarily known, is not
that a sensation has been experienced, but that there exists an
outer object."
[63]

"The question here is—What does consciousness directly testify?
And the direct testimony of consciousness is, that Time
and Space are not within but without the mind; and so absolutely
independent of it that they cannot be conceived to become
non-existent even were the mind to become non-existent."
[64]

The moral of the first bit quoted would seem to be, unless we
make the word "primarily" refer only to order in time, that one

[132]

knows immediately what is beyond consciousness and mediately
what is in it—a use of words satisfactory, I should think, to no
one but Mr. Spencer. If, by "primarily" be meant "previously,"
and the two classes of being are known in just the same way,
why distinguish between the classes? Moreover, in this case a
thing would not be known "through" appearances, but before
them. Upon the other supposition, to be sure, appearances
would be known "through" it—a mode of speaking not in harmony
with the language of the "First Principles." It seems a
choice between Scylla and Charybdis.

The second extract makes consciousness "directly testify"
not only to what is beyond its pale, but, putting on the spirit of
prophecy, even to what does not belong to the present, but to a
possible future. When we speak of consciousness as testifying
to a sensation, we mean simply that the sensation is in consciousness.
The word cannot be used in this sense in speaking of
what is beyond consciousness. In what sense is it used? It
would seem to mean, if it mean anything, that consciousness
gives one the right to infer a something beyond—a right which
thoughtful men believe should be established by proof. This
proof, one cannot, of course, expect from a man who makes the
thing beyond consciousness the thing "primarily" known. It
would be more consistent in him to attempt a proof that there is
something in consciousness.

This complete confusion in Mr. Spencer's mind of things in
consciousness and things without, will explain why he keeps talking
of his two Absolutes as if there were only one, as if this one
were the one of which we are conscious, and yet as if this one were
beyond consciousness. His pages swarm with illustrations
which I might give. I shall give only the following: "Thus
the consciousness of an Inscrutable Power manifested to us
through all phenomena, has been growing ever clearer; and must

[133]

eventually be freed from its imperfections."
[65]
If Mr. Spencer
ever comes to a consciousness that sameness in sense seventh is
not sameness in sense first, he will find work before him in
remodeling his doctrine.

The second confusion upon which I wish to comment comes
to the surface in a sentence occurring near the end of the lengthy
extract quoted at the outset: "And since the only possible
measure of relative validity among our beliefs, is the degree of
their persistence in opposition to the efforts made to change
them, it follows that this which persists at all times, under all
circumstances, and cannot cease until consciousness ceases, has
the highest validity of any."

Now that which, it has been argued, persists at all times and
under all circumstances, is the "raw material of thought," the
element of existence which is the "abstract of
all
thoughts,
ideas, or conceptions." It is merely that which they have in
common, and can include none of those elements in which they
differ. If, however, persistence mean anything, it means persistence
in time. That which exists at this time and that which
exists at that are not one, strictly speaking, but two. That is,
they are not the same in sense first, but in some looser sense
which will admit of duality. If, then, we are dealing with the
Absolute, existence pure and simple, and are abstracting from
all differences which may mark out
this
existence from
that
, we
must abstract from temporal distinctions too. If we do this, we
can no longer speak of the Absolute as persisting. If we do not
do this, something may persist, but it is no Absolute. Mental
elements otherwise similar, but distinguished from each other by
temporal differences are the same in sense second, not in sense first.
The existence of which I am conscious to-day and the existence of
which I was conscious yesterday are not the same existence in

[134]

any sense save this. Yesterday's existence does not persist to-day;
it is replaced by another. Mr. Spencer has evidently fallen
into the error of those schoolmen who endeavored to abstract
the element which several things have in common, but created
unnecessary difficulties by making an incomplete abstraction
and treating it as though it were complete. Other defects of
this fallacious argument to prove our belief in the Absolute valid,
I will not here discuss.

Sec. 35.
I next take a few passages which will illustrate the
confusion of samenesses first and seventh, from Dr. James McCosh's
late work on "First and Fundamental Truths." They
are selected from the chapter on "Our Intuition of Body by the
Senses."
[66]

"We are following the plainest dictates of consciousness, we
avoid a thousand difficulties, and we get a solid ground on which
to rest and to build, when we maintain that the mind in its first
exercises acquires knowledge; not, indeed, scientific or arranged,
not of qualities of objects and classes of objects, but still knowledge—the
knowledge of things presenting themselves, and as
they present themselves; which knowledge, individual and concrete,
is the foundation of all other knowledge, abstract, general
and deductive. In particular, the mind is so constituted as to attain
a knowledge of body or of material objects. It may be difficult
to ascertain the exact point or surface at which the mind and
body come together and influence each other, in particular, how
far into the body (Descartes without proof thought to be in the
pineal gland), but it is certain that when they do meet mind
knows body as having its essential properties of extension and
resisting energy. It is through the bodily organism that the
intelligence of man attains its knowledge of all material objects
beyond. This is true of the infant mind; it is true also of the

[135]

mature mind. We may assert something more than this regarding
the organism. It is not only the medium through which we
know all bodily objects beyond itself; it is itself an object primarily
known; nay, I am inclined to think that, along with the
objects immediately affecting it, it is the only object originally
known. Intuitively man seems to know nothing beyond his own
organism, and objects directly affecting it; in all further knowledge
there is a process of inference proceeding on a gathered
experience. This theory seems to me to explain all the facts,
and it delivers us from many perplexities."
[67]

"In our primitive cognition of body there is involved a knowledge
of Outness or Externality. We know the object perceived,
be it the organism or the object affecting the organism, as not in
the mind, but as out of the mind. In regard to some of the
objects perceived by us, we may be in doubt as to whether they
are in the organism or beyond it, but we are always sure that
they are extra-mental."
[68]

"We know the Objects as Affecting Us. I have already said
that we know them as independent of us. This is an important
truth. But it is equally true and equally important that these
objects are made known to us as somehow having an influence on
us. The organic object is capable of affecting our minds, and
the extra-organic object affects the organism which affects the
mind. Upon this cognition are founded certain judgments as to
the relations of the objects known to the knowing mind."
[69]

"But it will be vehemently urged that it is most preposterous
to assert that we know all this by the senses. Upon this I
remark that the phrase
by the senses
is ambiguous. If by senses
he meant the mere bodily organism—the eye, the ears, the
nerves and the brain—I affirm that we know, and can know,
nothing by this bodily part, which is a mere organ or instrument;

[136]

that so far from knowing potency or extension, we do
not know even color, or taste, or smell. But if by the senses he
meant the mind exercised in sense-perception, summoned into
activity by the organism, and contemplating cognitively the
external world, then I maintain that we do know, and this intuitively,
external objects as influencing us; that is, exercising
powers in reference to us. I ask those who would doubt of this
doctrine of what it is that they suppose the mind to be cognizant
in sense-perception. If they say a mere sensation or
impression in the mind, I reply that this is not consistent with
the revelation of consciousness, which announces plainly that
what we know is something extra-mental. If they say, with
Kant, a mere phenomenon in the sense of appearance, then I
reply that this, too, is inconsistent with consciousness, which
declares that we know the thing."
[70]

The statements contained in these extracts are plainly in a
state of civil war, and might be left, without foreign aid, to complete
their own destruction. I shall first let them criticize each
other.

(1) It is asserted that it may be difficult to ascertain the exact
point or surface at which the mind and body come together and
influence each other—in particular how far into the body—but
that it is certain that
when they do meet
mind knows body
as having its essential properties of extension and resisting
energy.

This knowledge is said to arise
when they meet
, be it marked,
and not before.

(2) It is also asserted that it is
through the body
that the mind
attains its knowledge of
all
material objects beyond.

This makes our knowledge of objects beyond the body mediate
and not immediate. Why are objects beyond the body

[137]

regarded as mediately known? No reason is suggested except
that they are not themselves in contact with the mind, but only
in contact with that which is in contact with the mind. It is
then presumable that
any parts of the bodily organism which
never themselves meet the mind (if there are any such) are not
known immediately
, but only through the parts which do meet
the mind. That is, they are known mediately, too. That there
are, or at least may be, such parts, is directly inferrible from
the statement that we do not know "how far into the body"
mind and body come together.

(3) It is stated that the body is an object "primarily" known.
It is regarded by the author as probable that, along with the
objects immediately affecting it, it is the only object "originally"
known. He thinks that man knows "intuitively" nothing
beyond his own organism and objects directly affecting it.

But what is meant by the words "primarily," "originally,"
"intuitively"? If things not in direct contact with mind are
not known immediately but through something else, and if the
point or surface at which mind and body meet is at some uncertain
distance from the surface of the body, surely the only
material thing immediately known is that portion of the body
in contact with mind, and not the whole body with the objects
directly affecting it. Knowledge of these mediate objects must
be due to a process of inference from what is directly experienced.

Things known "primarily," "originally" and "intuitively"
are then known mediately and inferentially
—even in
some cases so imperfectly known that it is not known what and
where they are, whether in or beyond the body.

(4) The doctrine that we are conscious in sense-perception
of a mere sensation or impression in the mind is answered by
the statement that this is not consistent with the revelation of
consciousness, which announces plainly that what we know is

[138]

something extra-mental. Kant's phenomenalism is met by the
claim that consciousness declares that we know the thing.

A thing known mediately, however, cannot be more certainly
known than the thing known immediately, and from which its
existence is inferred.
The immediate revelation of consciousness
cannot do more than give as a knowledge of the point or surface
at which mind and body meet.
It is only here that mind can
directly know body "as having its essential properties of extension
and resisting energy."
But so far from consciousness testifying
to the extension and resistance of this part of the body, it
does not, as Dr. McCosh admits, testify to this part of the body at
all.
If it reveal nothing as to what it knows immediately,
what can its statement as to what it knows mediately be worth?
And if consciousness testifies that it knows immediately what
Dr. McCosh has maintained to be mediately known, he must
hold that its revelation is false and delusive. It certainly seems
to me that my consciousness reveals the ink-stand before me as
it does not reveal the part of my body with which the mind has
"come together," since it does not even reveal whether this
part be a point or a surface. If my knowledge of the ink-stand
must rest upon my knowledge of this, and can have no greater
certainty, my faith in the ink-stand must go. A tower cannot
be more firm than its foundation.

So much for the consistency of the extracts themselves. I
now turn to a criticism on a different basis. The difficulties
connected with this inconsistent doctrine naturally arise out of
the standpoint occupied by the author. He accepts as final,
and as justifiable in metaphysics, the convenient psychological
assumption that the group of sensations gained from an object
is a something distinct from the object itself; that the object
may be external to the organism, but that the mind, with its
sensations, is, or may be treated as if it were, somewhere within

[139]

the organism; that the sensations are gained from real things,
but are not themselves real things, so that a world of sensations—things
being abstracted—must be an unreal and phantom
world.

Now, the man who has thus distinguished between things and
sensations, if he regard the sensations as our only immediate
representatives of the things, will find it difficult, without making
an evidently gratuitous assumption somewhere, to prove his
right to reach things at all. Dr. McCosh sees this difficulty,
and so he assumes that consciousness reveals both sensations
and things. He allows us "perceptions mingled with sensations."
[71]

Where are these mingled perceptions and sensations?
In the mind. Where is the mind? In the body. In what
body? The body perceived. Is this body perceived itself in
the mind and mingled with sensations? No. It is then distinct
from the mental percept—the perception of it is somewhere
in it, but is not it. How do we know, then, that there is
a body? We infer it from the percept; consciousness (the percept)
"reveals" it. On what principle is it inferred? The
question is a just one if the knowledge be not immediate. Our
author does not even see that there is a question. The fact is
that this doctrine seems to avoid the difficulties of a representative
perception only while it is allowed to remain loose and
vague. If things are not to be known representatively, they
must either be themselves in consciousness—
and then they are
not extra-mental
—or they must be directly known in some
other way than as in consciousness,
and then consciousness does
not reveal them and cannot be appealed to
. An appeal to consciousness,
unless the thing itself is in consciousness, is fatal.

But this discrimination between sensations and the thing
causing the sensations, and the assumption that consciousness

[140]

testifies to the two classes of things, does not seem to be borne
out by the facts. Consciousness does not testify to the two
classes. The common man thinks that he knows directly the
things that he sees and feels, and the distinction between these
things and his ideas of the things, or his sensations gathered
from the things, arises only upon reflection and after a comparison
of his experiences with those of other men. He sees the
ink-stand in front of another man's body. He discovers that
the other man sees the ink-stand—that is, has an experience like
his own. He finds, after investigation, that this other man does
not have the experience until after some influence has been conducted
by the nerves to the brain. He accordingly concludes
that the mind of this other man, and all that it
immediately

knows, is situated somewhere in the brain. He thus distinguishes
between the ink-stand and the representative of the
ink-stand in the mind of the other man. This is precisely what
Dr. McCosh has done, though he has preferred to use the word
perception instead of sensation or impression. Having gone as
far as this, the man in question reflects, if he be consistent, that
his own case must be essentially similar to that of the man he
is considering, and concludes that he, too, sees only (immediately,
at least) some representative of the ink-stand, and not the
thing itself. Dr. McCosh does not conclude this, because he is
not consistent. But an ink-stand, a tree, a house, in the brain,
cannot be very much like a real ink-stand, tree or house. Then
one does not see things as they are, but is condemned to a
phantom world. Having gone thus far, our common man is
appalled at his own conclusions, as well he may be.

He may, however, be readily reassured, if one will point out
to him the error in his argument. The whole argument began
by assuming that he has evidence that some object is in front of
his body and in front of the body of another man; that he has

[141]

a body and so has the other man. If this knowledge be immediate,
of course it may furnish the basis of an argument; but if
it be not immediate, one has no right to begin with it, but should
go back to what is immediate. Let us assume that it is immediate.
What I am then conscious of is my own body, the other
man's body and the object in relation to them. Upon this basis
I argue to some representative of the object I immediately see,
and I connect it with the man's brain. Does the man now see
two objects or only one? If only one, which one? The one I
refer to his brain, or the one I see? Does the one he sees
seem to him to be in his brain? Probably he has not the least
notion that it is connected with that organ. Am I, then, in his
case? Do I also see only a copy of the object in my brain?
And may this not be true, although I have no immediate knowledge
of my brain and its relation to that object? But—and this
is the important point—if all this be true, how about the position
with which I started? My argument is based upon two
real bodies and a real object. I see that I was wholly in error
in supposing that I saw these and could reason from them.
Then the reasoning is not good. Then the conclusion is not
reliable, and it is not proved that I see immediately only an
image in, or in some sort of contact with, my brain. The fallacious
character of the argument is plain enough; where is the
flaw? It lies in this:

I assume that I see the two bodies and the object immediately.
Consciousness seems to reveal them. After granting the man
opposite me a representative of that object I apply the same
reasoning to myself, forgetting that I assumed at the outset that
I see the real object. I can certainly not put the object I see in
my brain, for the brain in any way I can be conceived to know
it belongs to precisely the same class of things as this object,
and they are beside each other in consciousness. The representative

[142]

the other man has is a representative of the object in my
consciousness, and not—at least, I have no evidence that it is—a
representative of a something else of which my object is also
a representative. And if the object of which I am immediately
conscious is extended and without my body (immediately perceived),
I may assume that the object in his consciousness is also
extended and without the body in his consciousness. His representative
of my object is not in the head I see, for his head as
I see it is in my consciousness, if the object I see is, and any
object in his consciousness is the same with any corresponding
object in mine only in sense sixth—a sense of sameness which
I have explained at length in the earlier part of my work. This
reasoning is, it seems to me, clear enough and consistent enough,
and should be plain to any one who will take the trouble to follow
it carefully. It lands one in no such difficulties and inconsistencies
as result from the doctrine I have been criticizing.
Should it be said this is a form of Idealism, and at least abandons
what is extra-mental, I answer, the name is a matter of
taste and of little significance; what is important is that this
doctrine does not found its reasoning upon an assumption which
its conclusion declares to be false; nor does it maintain that
what is immediately known is not extended, figured, external to
the body, as it seems to be, but something quite different and
dissimilar. It is in harmony with the revelation of consciousness.
Should it still be objected that it makes no distinction
between things and the sensations or impressions which represent
them, I answer, one can object to things being regarded as
complexes of sensations only as long as he separates sensations
and things, making the former unlike the things and relegating
them to a place (the brain) where the things are not, and to
exist in which they must be very bad copies of the things
indeed. The doctrine I advocate does not deny the things as
perceived at all; it merely holds that consciousness does declare

[143]

for the things, and not for a set of representatives much unlike
them and said to exist in a place in which we are not conscious
of perceiving anything. It objects to seeing double through an
incomplete reflection upon what consciousness reveals.

Now it is very evident that Dr. McCosh, in his anxiety to prove
an extra-mental world, is actuated by a desire to retain real
things. He is under the impression that, unless the extra-mental
is known, our knowledge is confined to shadows and
unrealities. He combats the Idealist, because he supposes him
to deny the body of which we are conscious; whereas, all that
the Idealist is denying (if he be consistent with his principles) is
the hypothetical representative of the body, assumed to exist
within the body, and to which consciousness does not testify.
It is this that is the unreality. The body to which the Idealist
holds is the very body to which Dr. McCosh thinks consciousness
testifies; but this body is not beyond consciousness, nor in
any proper sense of the words extra-mental. The above argument
for the extra-mental is consequently due to a misconception—to
the misconception that the body revealed by consciousness
is the extra-mental body, and that the only body left to an
Idealist is an unreal phantom of this body, and distinct from it.
And it is the attempt to make this body revealed by consciousness
both in mind and out of mind that has occasioned the difficulties
and inconsequences of the reasoning I have quoted.
This attempt is due to a confusion of sameness in sense seventh
with sameness in sense first. My excuse for so minute a criticism
of this plainly untenable position is that we have here a
representative instance of an error quite common, and indeed
characteristic of a certain stage of reflection.

Sec. 36.
The last confusion of samenesses that I shall discuss
lies at the bottom of the common opinion on the infinite divisibility
of space, and causes the antinomies which arise from it.
The position I shall criticize is well set forth in Professor W. K.

[144]

Clifford's popular lecture entitled "Of Boundaries in General."
[72]

From this I take a few passages which will suffice to illustrate
his doctrine.

"Now the idea expressed by that word
continuous
is one of
extreme importance; it is the foundation of all exact science of
things; and yet it is so very simple and elementary that it must
have been almost the first clear idea that we got into our heads.
It is only this: I cannot move this thing from one position to
another, without making it go through an infinite number of
intermediate positions.
Infinite
; it is a dreadful word, I know,
until you find out that you are familiar with the thing which it
expresses. In this place it means that between any two positions
there is some intermediate position; between that and
either of the others, again, there is some other intermediate;
and so on
without any end
. Infinite means without any end.
If you went on with that work of counting forever, you would
never get any further than the beginning of it. At last you
would only have two positions very close together, but not the
same; and the whole process might be gone over again, beginning
with those as many times as you like."

* * * * "When a point moves, it moves along some
line; and you may say that it traces out or describes the line.
To look at something definite, let us take the point where this
boundary of red on paper is cut by the surface of water. I
move all about together. Now you know that between any two
positions of the point there is an infinite number of intermediate
positions. Where are they all? Why, clearly, in the line along
which the point moved. That line is the place where all such
points are to be found."

* * * * "It seems a very natural thing to say that space
is made up of points. I want you to examine very carefully

[145]

what this means, and how far it is true. And let us first take
the simplest case, and consider whether we may safely say that
a line is made up of points. If you think of a very large
number—say, a million—of points all in a row, the end ones
being an inch apart; then this string of points is altogether a
different thing from a line an inch long. For if you single out
two points which are next one another, then there is no point of
the series between them; but if you take two points on a line,
however close together they may be, there is an infinite number
of points between them. The two things are different
in kind
,
not in degree."

* * * * "When a point moves along a line, we know that
between any two positions of it there is an infinite number (in
this new sense
[73]
) of intermediate positions. That is because the
motion is continuous. Each of those positions is where the
point was at some instant or other. Between the two end positions
on the line, the point where the motion began and the
point where it stopped, there is no point of the line which does
not belong to that series. We have thus an infinite series of
successive positions of a continuously moving point, and in that
series are included all the points of a certain piece of line-room.
May we say then that the line is made up of that infinite series
of points?

"Yes; if we mean no more than that the series makes up the

points
of the line. But
no
, if we mean that the line is made up of
those points in the same way that it is made up of a great many
very small pieces of line. A point is not to be regarded as a

part
of a line, in any sense whatever. It is the boundary between
two parts."

These extracts suffice, I think, to show what the common doctrine
is, and to show also the unavoidable difficulties connected

[146]

with it. These were clearly seen long ago. Motion, argues
Zeno of Elea,
[74]
cannot begin, because a body in motion must
pass through an infinite number of intermediate places before it
can arrive at any other place. Achilles can never overtake the
tortoise, for by the time that he has reached the place where it
was, it has always moved a little beyond. If Professor Clifford
could not move a thing from one position to another, without
making it go though an infinite number of intermediate positions,
if these positions must be gone through with successively, and if
infinite really mean
without any end
, then the final member of the
series could never have been reached, for the plain reason that
there is no final member to an endless series. If the new position
is reached without passing through every member of the
series and leaving none farther to pass through, it is not reached
by passing through an infinite number of intermediate positions.
The difficulty here is a hopeless one; either the series has a
final member,
and then it is not infinite
; or it has not,
and then
one cannot come to the end
.

The attempt sometimes made to avoid this difficulty by calling
upon a precisely similar one for aid is of not the least avail. The
time of the motion, it is said, is divisible just as is the space
over which the body moves; the spaces and the times then vary
together, and as the spaces become very small the times become
very small; infinitesimal spaces are passed over in infinitesimal
times, and all these infinitesimals are included in the finite space
and finite time of the motion. But if there be a difficulty in
arriving at the end of an endless series of places or positions,
there is surely no less a difficulty in reaching the end of an endless
series of times. If the series of times to be successively
exhausted be truly endless, then an end of the motion can never
be reached. Quibbling over the size of the members of the

[147]

series in the case of either space or time is useless. Whether
things are big or little, if the supply of them is truly endless, one
can never get to the end of the supply. The rapidity with which
they are exhausted has nothing to do with the question, for an
increase in rapidity has obviously no effect in facilitating an approach
to what is assumed not to exist, a final term. It is, then,
perfectly clear that, if, in order to move a body, I must come to
the end of an endless series, I may reasonably conclude that I
cannot move a body. Granting the assumption upon which it is
based, Zeno's argument is unanswerable. It is not a question of
an ordinary difficulty, a trifling evil; it is a question of an impossibility,
a flat contradiction; to move an inch, to endure for a
minute, one is to accomplish the feat of reaching the end of the
endless. One thing is quite certain; no rival doctrine can present
a greater difficulty.

It is possible that some one may wish to find a way out of this
difficulty by distinguishing, as Clifford has done, between the

points
of the line and the
parts
of the line. But this distinction is
of no service. All these points are declared to be on the line, and
anything that passes over the whole line must exhaust them one
by one until it arrives at the final point. By hypothesis, there
is no final point to the series—the series is without any end.
Unless, then, the line can be passed over without passing over
the points, there would seem to be no help in turning to line
pieces. Moreover, it appears reasonable to assume that there are
as many parts to the line as there are points. For all these
points are on the line, and no two of them are in precisely the
same position on the line; they must consequently be on different
parts of the line. If it be objected that, having no extension,
they cannot properly be said to be
on
parts of the line, I answer
that, even on this hypothesis, they must be
at
different parts of
the line, in order to be distinguished from each other. The

[148]

part of the line between any two of them is certainly not the
same as the part between any other two. It follows that the
number of parts of which the line is made up is at least as great
as the number of points less one, if we refuse to say that the
points are on the line; and is as great as the number of points,
if we are willing to say that they are on the line. To move over
the whole line, then, a point must come within one term of the
end of an endless series, or it must pass over an endless number
of small pieces of line until it comes to the very end. Does this
seem a sensible doctrine?

The rival doctrine, sometimes called the Berkeleyan, contains
no such difficulties, and it makes evident that the difficulties discussed
above arise simply out of a confusion of samenesses, and
are gratuitous. Its discussion demands that I call to mind a
few distinctions already made.

One must bear in mind, in the first place, that a line immediately
known, existing in consciousness, is the same with an
"external" line corresponding to it, not in sense first, but in
sense seventh. That is, they are two lines, not one, and in the
interests of clearness they should be considered separately.

One should remember, in the second place, that a line in consciousness
at one moment is not, in the strictest sense, the same
with a line in consciousness at another moment. One may
stand for the other and thus be the same with it in sense fifth;
or the two may be regarded as both belonging to the one series
of experiences, which, taken together, represent to us "an
object," in which case they are the same in sense third. A
thing the same with another thing in either of these senses is
not necessarily much like it. It must only be able to serve as
its representative.

Now I see a line about an inch long on the paper before me.
It is a certain distance from my eyes. I shall concern myself

[149]

for the present only with the line immediately perceived, which
means for me so much sensation. If I move this line (which
remains the same in sense third), nearer to me or farther away,
I do not perceive the identical thing that I did before. My
quantity of sensation is increased or diminished. If I keep the
line at the same distance and change none of the conditions,
the quantity of sensation remains presumably the same. The
question arises, Is this line as actually experienced at this
moment infinitely divisible or not? I can certainly conceive of
it as divisible to some extent, for I see part out of part, and I can
think of these parts as separated. But if this line were divided,
the division would soon result in parts which could be seen,
but which could not be seen to consist of part out of part. Were
these apparently non-extended parts (they would remain the
same in sense third), approached to the eyes, they, too, would
be seen to consist of part out of part, but then I should simply
have substituted for the apparently non-extended a representative
which was extended. This would not prove that what was
before in consciousness was extended and could be divided.
Consciousness certainly seems to testify that any particular line
in consciousness is composed of a limited number of indivisible
parts, and when one adds to this reflection the consideration
that a point moving over a given line does not appear to have
an endless task before it, but soon arrives at the final term, one
is irresistibly impelled to the conclusion that the parts of the
line are not infinite, but that the division results in the indivisible,
the simple element of sensation, which, joined with other
such elements, makes an extended object, but which taken alone
is not extended at all. The whole difficulty lies in keeping to
the line and the parts with which one started. It is so easy to
pass from sameness in sense first to sameness in sense third or
sense fifth; it is so natural to bring an object which is, as we

[150]

say, imperfectly seen, closer to the eye and thus substitute for
what was seen before a new experience connected with it in the
order of nature, confident that any system of relations derived
from the latter may safely be carried over to all possible experiences
connected with the former; one does this so instinctively
that a man may very readily suppose that he is still busied
about the apparently non-extended element with which he
started, when he is in reality dividing and sub-dividing its representative,
which is evidently extended. But the question is not
whether, when one has divided a line until the parts cannot be
seen to consist of parts, one may substitute for these parts what
evidently does consist of parts, and go on dividing that. The
question is, whether an apparently non-extended element of a
line in consciousness is divisible or not. Any argument from
the possibility of dividing its substitutes evidently has nothing
to do with this point.

It is plain that this doctrine, which makes any particular finite
line in consciousness to consist of a limited number of simple
parts, is not open to the objection that it necessitates the absurdity
of exhausting an endless series. Moving along such a line,
Achilles could overtake the tortoise, for the successively diminishing
distances between them do not constitute an endless
series. The descending series results after a limited number of
terms in the simple, and the series is broken, for the simple does
not consist of parts. In this there is at least no contradiction.
It remains to see what other objections may lie against it.

It may be argued, first, as it often is argued, that it is impossible
to conceive of any part of a line as not itself extended and
having parts. It may be admitted that the small parts arrived
at do not seem to have part out of part; that these sub-parts are
not observed in them, but still it is said that one who thinks
about them cannot but think of them as really having such

[151]

parts. I ask one who puts forward this objection to look into
his own mind and see whether he does not mean by "thinking
about them," bringing them in imagination nearer to the eye, or
by some means substituting for them what can be seen to have
part out of part. That one can do this no one would think of
denying, but, as I have said, this does not prove the original
parts to be extended.

It may be objected again that extension can never be built up
out of the non-extended—that if one element of a given kind
has, taken alone, no extension at all, two or more such elements
together cannot have any extension either. I answer that a
straight line has no angularity at all, and yet two straight lines
may obviously make an angle; that one man is not in the least
a crowd, but that one hundred men may be; that no single tree
is a forest, but that many trees together do make a forest; that
a uniform expanse of color is in no sense a variegated surface,
but that several such together do make a variegated surface. It
may be that extension is simply the name we give to several
simple sense-elements of a particular kind taken together. One
cannot say off-hand that it is not.

Should one object, finally, that, if a given line in consciousness
be composed of a limited number of indivisible elements of
sensation, consciousness ought to distinguish these single
elements and testify as to their number; I answer that what is
in consciousness is not necessarily in a clear analytical consciousness,
nor well distinguished from other elements. For example,
I am at present conscious of a stream of sensations which I
connect with the hand that holds my pen. The single elements
in this complex I cannot distinguish from each other, nor can I
give their number. It does not follow that I am to assume the
number to be infinite. Much less should I be impelled to make
this assumption, if it necessitated my accepting as true what I

[152]

see to be flatly contradictory, as in the case under discussion.
It was because of this vagueness and lack of discrimination in
the testimony of consciousness that I said, some distance back,
that consciousness
seems
to testify that any finite line in it is
composed of simple parts. If the testimony were quite clear,
the matter would be settled at once. As it is not quite clear,
the matter has to be settled on a deductive basis. The most
reasonable solution appears to be the Berkeleyan.

So much for the line immediately perceived, the line in consciousness.
What shall we say to one who is willing to admit
that this line is not infinitely divisible, but is composed of simple
sense-elements; and yet who maintains that there exists an
"external" line corresponding to it, which is not immediately
perceived, and is infinitely divisible? We may begin by suggesting
to him that an "external" point moving over this
"external" line must perform the wholly impossible feat to
which Clifford condemns a point moving over a line; and we
may farther suggest that, if the "external" world be an intelligible
world at all, a contradiction may be as much out of place
in it as anywhere else. And if the existence of this world be
problematic, a thing not self-evident, it seems quite reasonable
to demand very good proof indeed of the existence, of that
which contains in its very conception such excellent reasons for
believing in its non-existence. This proof, the student of the
history of speculation will testify, has not as yet been forthcoming.

Sec. 37.
With this I close my analysis of samenesses, and of
confusions which have resulted in needless embarrassments and
gratuitous difficulties. More instances of the latter could be
given, of course. The reader will be able to furnish, I presume,
many like them. Those which I have given seem to me quite
sufficient to prove the need of much greater care and exactitude

[153]

than one commonly finds in metaphysical reasonings. Loose
reasoning is bad reasoning, and leads to bad results. Its one
virtue is that it does not require much mental application on the
part of either author or reader. On the other hand, the attempt
to be cautious and exact, to distinguish between things easily
confounded, and to keep strictly to the thing in dispute through
a long discussion, these things are wearisome to all concerned.
Although I am quite conscious of this fact, I have tried to do
these things: with what result, my fellow-analysts must judge.
I feel reasonably sure that I have succeeded in being wearisome,
and for this I make due apology.

am not concerned here with the inner contradiction of the Kantian system. The notion
of noumena predominantly in Kant's mind, was, I think, about as I have stated. He
would not, of course, have denied "reality" to phenomena, but his misconception of
Berkeley, and the satisfaction with which he settles down to the noumenal in the Critique of
the Practical Reason, show that he felt toward the "blos Erscheinung" very much as
Locke felt toward mere ideas. Cf. "Essay," Bk. 4, Chap. 11, Â§ 7.

Owing to the ambiguity already pointed out as existing in terms which stand for our
objects of knowledge and our knowledge of these objects, it would seem almost impossible to
avoid misconception without unendurable reiteration. In the above paragraph, by the words
"body," "object," "self," etc., I always refer to things immediately known.

This abnormal door has its parallel in the now discredited
causa sui
. Note the following
from Descartes: "De mÃªme, lorsque nous disons que Dieu est par soi, nous pouvons
aussi Ã  la vÃ©ritÃ© entendre cela nÃ©gativement, comme voulant dire qu'il n'a point de cause;
mais si nous avons auparavant recherchÃ© la cause pourquoi il est ou pourquoi il ne cesse
point d'Ãªtre, et que, considÃ©rant l'immense et incomprÃ©hensible puissance qui est contenue
dans son idÃ©e, nous l'ayons reconnue si pleine et si abondante qu'en effet elle soit la vraie cause
pourquoi il est, et pourquoi il continue ainsi toujours d'Ãªtre, et qu'il n'y en puisse avoir d'autre
que celle-lÃ , nous disons que Dieu est
par soi
, non plus nÃ©gativement, mais au contraire trÃ¨s
positivement. Car, encore qu'il n'est pas besoin de dire qu'il est la cause efficiente de soi-mÃªme,
de peur que peut-Ãªtre on n'entre en dispute du mot; nÃ©anmoins, parce que
nous
voyons
que ce qui fait qu'il est par soi, ou qu'il n'a point de cause diffÃ©rente de soi-mÃªme, ne procÃ¨de
pas du nÃ©ant, mais de la rÃ©elle et vÃ©ritable immensitÃ© de sa puissance, il nous est tout a fait
loisible de penser qu'il fait en quelque faÃ§on la mÃªme chose a l'Ã©gard de soi-mÃªme que la cause
efficiente Ã  l'Ã©gard de son effet, et partant qu'il est par soi positivement."—RÃ©ponses aux

See my "Conception of the Infinite," Ch. VI (J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia). It
is but fair to state that my criticism of Realism in this volume is directed against the "
ante

" Realism. I did not have the Moderate Realism in mind, and what I said will not apply
to it.

In this extract the author attempts to distinguish between what is thought and what is
perceived by the senses or imagined. Had he remained within the sphere of the immediately
known, one could not have objected to such a distinction. Sameness in sense third is something
highly complex, implying that elaboration of mental elements which we call thought.
It is quite just to distinguish the notion "a bit of wax" from any single sense experience or
picture of the imagination. In doing this Descartes was searching for sameness in sense
third. But when he leaves the sphere of consciousness, and assumes that what remains the
same in the bit of wax is something distinct from the sum total of experiences, as men are
distinct from their garments, he falls into error. It is against this that the criticism in the
text is directed.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

Literary Archive Foundation."

You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
works.

You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.

You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

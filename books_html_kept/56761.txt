ANNOUNCEMENT.

UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD is a Magazine devoted to the promulgation of
the principles of the Brotherhood of Humanity in the widest sense. It is
an organ whose aim is to show that the Unity or Brotherhood of Mankind
it an actual fact in nature. If this principle were better understood by the
multitude or even by certain classes of Society there would be less strife and
competition and more sympathy and co-operation.

The demonstration of these broad ideas from the Ethical, Scientific and
Practical points of view will prove that there is much agreement between
these systems on this topic, and that it is an underlying ground-work by means
of which all Religions and all Philosophies agree also.

This magazine will endeavor to show the great similarity between the
Religions of the world, in their fundamental beliefs and doctrines as also the
value of studying other systems than our own.

A sound basis for ethics should be found.

Those who would assist the cause of Brotherhood should realize that it is
of the first importance to discover as much as possible concerning the nature of
man and man's relation to the world around him. The laws that govern his
physical, mental, moral and spiritual being should be studied and investigated.

It is hoped that every sympathizer with the cause of brotherhood will endeavor
to assist us in enlarging the circulation of this magazine. Subscribers
will greatly oblige by sending us the names and addresses of individuals known
to them as willing to investigate liberal ideas.

All writers who are interested in the above objects are invited to contribute
articles.

It is in the hands of our readers to push the circulation of
Universal
Brotherhood
to an almost unlimited extent.
All profits arising from the
publication of this magazine, or from the business conducted by the
Theosophical Publishing Co., are devoted to propaganda of Brotherhood.
All who assist us in this work are directly helping the great
cause of humanity.

A HAPPY NEW YEAR.

Once

more we enter upon a new
year, and the Greetings of our
hearts rise spontaneously and go
out to our loved ones and comrades
throughout the world, to all the people
of the earth, and to all creatures.
We look back through twenty-three
years and we see that lion-hearted
pioneer H.Â P. Blavatsky standing alone,
proclaiming her message to the world.
Then a few gather around her and
among them is our beloved Chief, William
Q. Judge. A little later, H.Â P.Â B.
leaves America for Europe and India,
and the picture comes before us of W.Â Q.
Judge meeting in New York, night after
night, often alone, sometimes with but
one or two. We know now what he was
doing. We can see now how faithfully
he tended the seed that has grown to a
tree which is for the healing of the
nations, and how he watched the spark
that is now bursting into flame, a beacon
of Truth, Light and Liberation for discouraged
humanity.

How small a beginning! How glorious
the result even now! But could I
show you the picture of a few years
hence you would say it is beyond belief.
But it is not. The tide has turned. The sorrow
and suffering which have oppressed
Humanity for ages are nearing their end,
the day of hope has already dawned, the
new age and the new year of Universal
Brotherhood has begun.

How glorious then is the opportunity
of all to-day, and how great the responsibility
of each one to help and not obstruct
or hinder this work for humanity.
Success cannot be attained without effort.
The evil in the world and in man's own
nature cannot be overcome without a
struggle. But is it not a glorious thing
to fight on and still fight? Some, perhaps,
may fall, some have fallen in the
struggle, but the victory is certain, and
if all, when they are sore-pressed, would
but remember the words of H.Â P.Â B., they
would take new courage and new strength
to go ever forward.

"Trials you must pass through or you
will not be purified."

"Twenty failures are not irremediable
if followed by as many undaunted struggles
upward! Is it not so that mountains
are climbed?"

And can we not see already how glorious
is the work that has been accomplished.
But two short years to the end
of the Century and we shall see the Sun
shining gloriously. The battle is already
won, the darkness is already fast
disappearing before the light of day.
The work of H.Â P.Â B. and W.Â Q.Â J. has
spread around the world and with each
New Year the note of Brotherhood resounds
more clearly and the Happy New
Year shall be realized.

What a Greeting the Chief would, and

{528}

I know, does send to all. This
Universal
Brotherhood
Magazine is the outgrowth
of
The Path
in which year after
year he sent out his Greetings to the
members and once again that our new
members and friends may become as familiar
with him as those of us who knew
him personally and worked with and
loved him we send his portrait as a New
Year's Greeting.

COMRADES; GREETING!

Universal Brotherhood
,
the keynote of the coming cycle!
Let its melody be diffused to the four points of the compass from
the very depths of our hearts at this important hour at the closing
of the year 1898, that it may reach the hearts of other men and women.
The time is opportune and propitious, for the whole race has already been
touched by the virtue of compassion.

Our organization, firmly founded on this high ideal, has sent its tendrils
from the bosom of love and sympathy to discouraged humanity through
its many channels of dissemination of the sublime philosophy of solace
and happiness.

This greatest movement for the redemption of all mankind has been led
through the initial stages of development with great success by the
Master-hand of Wisdom; all brethren in the work may now take heart and
strength from the certainty that the possibility of accomplishment is in
sight. Signs are not wanting that the truths of our ideals are breaking
through the strong crust of conventionality, and that the world has already
been brought nearer to the realization of it by the efforts of this organization.
Love to all workers!

E. Aug. Neresheimer.

"Ring out the old, ring in the new,

Ring, happy bells, across the snow.

The year is going, let him go;

Ring out the false, ring in the true.

"Ring out the grief that saps the mind,

For those that here we see no more;

Ring out the feud of rich and poor,

Ring in redress to all mankind."

ALPHONSE DE LAMARTINE.

BY ALEXANDER WILDER, M.D.

III. EARLY MANHOOD.

Goethe
,
has pictured Faust as having
first acquired the learning of
the schools, philosophy, medicine,
jurisprudence and theology; then as
going forth with Mephisto in quest of
excitement, to which comes a tragic ending.
The shock of this paralyzes him
for a time from further endeavor. In
the Second Book of the drama, he again
rises up with strong resolve to begin an
active career in the busy world.

Somewhat in analogy with this is the
history of every one who leaves adolescence
behind and attempts without the
discipline of experience, to find a place
and engage in the future work of life.
Too often, however, it is more the varied
wanderings of a Jung-Stilling, requiring
the vicissitudes of years of preparation.

Lamartine desired to enter upon a
military life, but it was repugnant to the
wishes of his family that he should take
service, either in the army of Bonaparte,
or of any country that might be opposed
to France. His father retained his royalist
sentiments with characteristic stubbornness,
and his older uncle, the recognized
head of the family, though a
former friend of Mirabeau, had refused
the office of Senator when offered to him
by the Emperor. Young Lamartine was
thus handicapped and forced to idleness.

He spent some winters in Paris, and
mingled with the gaieties and dissipations
which young men encountered at
the metropolis. The result was self-abasement.
He incurred debts at the
gaming table, which his limited allowance
though eked out by secret contributions
from his mother, were insufficient
to meet; and he formed acquaintances
that were a serious drawback to
him in later years.

Perhaps he, like Bunyan, depicted
himself in darker colors than there was
really occasion. "There was not," says
he, "air enough in the sky, fire enough
in the sun, or space enough on the earth
for the want of breath, excitement and
burning that consumed me. I was a
living fever; I had the delirium and inquietude
of it in every part. The sober
habits of my years of study, and the
tranquil piety of my mother and our
teachers, have been put far away from
me. My friendships were as unworthy
as my feelings. I had become intimate
with the most giddy and turbulent young
men of my country and period."

Nevertheless while he was going forward
so readily in disorderly ways he
was actually repelled by them. Indeed,
he was only imitating others, and not
really following his own natural disposition.
When he came to be alone, the
solitude purified him.

In 1813 he again visited Italy. His
first opportunity for activity now came.

Paris having surrendered and Napoleon
having abdicated, the Allied Powers of
Europe placed Louis XVIII. on the
throne of France. This prince had always
been liberal in his views, and he
now proclaimed a constitutional government.
This conciliated all parties, royalists
and republicans alike. Lamartine
was enrolled in the Royal Guard, and
was of the force that marched against
Bonaparte upon his return from Elba.

The statement has been generally accepted
and believed that the reception of
the Emperor on this occasion was of the
nature of a triumph. Lamartine declares

{530}

that this was unqualifiedly untrue. The
enthusiasm, he affirms, was confined entirely
to the soldiers and to the dregs of
the population. France, itself, the real
France, had become utterly weary of
this fighting for the aggrandizement of
this one man. It had welcomed Louis
XVIII., but not as the king of a counter-revolution.
It did not contemplate any
going back to former conditions. The
king was received as the king of the
Liberal Constitution.

"All the movement of the Revolution
of 1789 which had been interrupted was
commenced anew by us after the fall of
the Imperial Government. The entire
France,—the France that thought and
not the France that clamored—was perfectly
conscious that the return of Bonaparte
meant the return of the military
rÃ©gime and tyranny. Of this it stood in
dread. The Twentieth of March [1815]
was a conspiracy of the army and not a
movement of the nation. If there had
not been an army organized in France
that was ready to fly under the eagles of
its Emperor, the Emperor would never
have reached Paris."

Nevertheless Lamartine was confounded
by what took place. In the brief space
of eight days apart, he saw one France
ready to rise up in mass against Bonaparte,
and then another France prostrate
at his feet. From that day he despaired
of the omnipotence of opinion and believed
even more than he ought in the
power of bayonets.

Louis XVIII., the Count d'Artois and
son, with Marshal Marmont and the
royal forces left Paris the night before
Bonaparte made his entry. As they
passed the cities on their retreat, the
citizens brought them food, execrating
the "Pretorians" who had overturned
the institutions and peace of the country.
Royalists and Republicans alike participated
in this denunciation of the treason
of the army.

At Arras the king left the troops and
went on by himself to Belgium. The
Count d'Artois and Marshal Marmont,
the commander of the forces, followed
soon afterward, after having issued a
proclamation absolving the men from
their oath. Thus abandoned, the question
arose, what was next to be done.
After a desultory discussion, a musketeer
declared that the true and safe course
was to leave France and take service
abroad.

Lamartine opposed this proposition.
Though but twenty-four years of age,
he had won the respect of his comrades.
Stepping on the wheel of a wagon he
addressed them. It was his first attempt
to speak in public. He referred to the
significant fact that his family had been
loyal to the monarchy, but had not
emigrated during the Revolution. He
had been nurtured in such sentiments.
Louis XVIII. had now given France a
representative government. The cause
of Republican Liberty and the cause of
the Bourbons had thus become united.
If now the two parties should continue
to act together, the reign of Bonaparte
would be short and his fall complete.
But if the royalists should now emigrate,
they would, by so doing abandon
the Republicans to the army. The blood
of the Republicans would smother all resistance
to the Empire. The duty, therefore,
of those now present, both to their
country and to their families, forbade
that they should follow the king out of
the French territory.

Most of the men voted to remain; a
few rode away. Being now without
officers, a temporary organization was
effected, posts established around Bethune
and a patrol provided. Four days
later a capitulation took place, by which
they were permitted to go to their families,
but excluded from Paris.

Lamartine, however, put on the dress
of a citizen and went in a cabriolet to
Paris. A few days later he was present
at a review of the troops.

The Emperor, he observed, exhibited
none of that ideal of intellectual beauty

{531}

and innate royalty, which writers had
so often depicted. He seemed to be conscious
that the ground was not solid under
his feet. His movements indicated
distrust and hesitation. As the troops
defiled before him they cheered with "a
concentrated accent of hopelessness."

Lamartine went home with renewed
confidence.

The Imperial conscription filled the
Chevalier, his father, with dismay. Lamartine
declared to him that he would
in no case enter the ranks himself or
procure a substitute. He would sooner
be shot to death. Leaving home, he
put on the dress of a peasant laborer, and
eluding the videttes on the frontier,
crossed into Switzerland.

For some weeks he was the guest of
the Baron de Vincy, an emigrant nobleman
whose property had been confiscated.
Himself almost without money
and his entertainers impoverished, he
could not bring himself to burden them
longer. Leaving them abruptly, he
made his way to Geneva. He was actually
considering the project of applying
to be a tutor in a Russian family and
travelling to the Crimea, Circassia and
Persia, when the final overthrow of
Bonaparte called him back to France.

He became again a member of the military
household of the king. Here he
found his oldest and most beloved of
friends, the Count Aymon de Virieu.
They had been in college together, had
travelled in Italy, their fathers had
shared danger together in the Royal
Guard on the fatal Tenth of August.
They were ever after as two brothers,
one in thought, one in soul, one in purse.
They continued members of the Guard
till it was disbanded.

Some years afterward Virieu made
Lamartine acquainted with several persons
of distinction whose good offices indirectly
facilitated Lamartine's entry into
public life.

Virieu was boisterous, full of jest, and
a skeptic in religion. He was through
his mother, descended from Montaigne,
and he had inherited that author's disposition.
He quoted him incessantly.

Lamartine, on the contrary, had inherited
from his mother, a melancholic
temperament, quiet, serious and religious.
He could not bear Montaigne's
skepticism, nor his salacious utterances.
"Man is born to believe," he
declared. "To believe in nothing is the
way to accomplish nothing, and impurity
in speech is a soiling of the soul."

He spent a summer with Virieu and
his family in DauphinÃ©. Their way of
living was a reflection of his boyhood
life at home, and brought calm and repose
to his mind.

Virieu afterward became serious like
his mother and withdrawing from public
life on account of his health, died some
years later. "In him," says Lamartine,
"I lost the living witness of the first
half of my own life. I felt that death
had torn out the dearest page of my history,
and that it was enshrouded with
him."

Another fellow-student whom Lamartine
repeatedly mentions, was the baron
Louis de Vignet, of Chambery, in Savoy.
They were often competitors for the
prizes. Vignet gave up the profession of
law and accepted a life of poverty for
the sake of his mother and sister. He
had been a skeptic and scoffer in religion
and repulsive in temper, but watching
with his dying mother, he became
changed and was modest, pensive, gentle
and melancholy.

He had hesitated to renew his acquaintance
with Lamartine during the
latter's wild career in Paris, but now,
meeting accidentally, the two were
drawn together at once. Vignet greeted
Lamartine more as a father than as a
comrade, and they quickly formed a
compact of friendship. As if to seal it
they went together to Charmettes to
visit the house where Rousseau had
lived, and afterward went to Servolex
together.

{532}

Vignet was a nephew of the Counts de
Maistre, two of whom were distinguished
in the political arena and world of letters.
Lamartine was received by the
elders as a son, and the younger members
of the family as a brother. He
remained with them during the summer.
The wholesome influence took his mind
away from the philosophy of the guardhouse
and the effeminate literature then
current in France. It was indeed an important
epoch in his history. Time,
death, difference of country and opinion
afterward separated them, but he always
vividly remembered that summer at the
house of Colonel de Maistre and Louis
de Vignet.

A diversion of the household consisted
of recitations of verse. Vignet had collected
a large number of effusions which
were current among the Savoyards.
Lamartine also ventured to recite his
own verses before Colonel de Maistre
and his daughters. The old man admired
his pure French diction and predicted
to his nephew that Lamartine
would become distinguished.

Another summer found Lamartine at
home in Milly. The family had gone
away; the father and uncles to a hunting
party in Burgundy, the mother on a
journey, and the sisters on visits to
friends, or to the convent. He was left
alone with no companionship but an old
servant-woman, his horse and his dog.
The silence, the loneliness of the garden,
and the empty rooms reminded him of
the tomb. It was in keeping with his
state of mind. He felt himself, or rather
he desired to feel himself dead.

In this mood he again resumed familiar
relations with the AbbÃ© Dumont,
his former schoolmaster at BussiÃ¨res.
The abbÃ© had himself become the parish
priest. There had been a tragedy in his
life before he gave up his place in the
world to take orders. He was the original
of Jocelyn in Lamartine's little poem.

Lamartine rode daily to the parsonage.
The two discoursed on topics more
or less abstruse, such as the state of
man on the earth, the vanity of ambition,
the religions, philosophies and
literature of different peoples, the esteem
bestowed on one great man over another,
the superiority of certain authors
to their rivals, the greatness of spirit in
some and littleness in others. To set
forth their views they quoted authors of
every age, like Plato, Cicero, Seneca,
FÃ©nÃ©lon, Bossuet, Voltaire, Rousseau.

Poetry was more severely handled.
Dumont appreciated only the sense of
language, and did not care for the musicalness
of what was uttered. They
both agreed that in the study of rhythm
and the mechanic consonance of rhyme
there was a puerile attempt to associate
a sensual delight of sound to some grand
thought or manly sentiment. Versifying
pertains to the speech of a people's infancy,
prose to that of its maturity.

Lamartine conceived that poetry does
not consist in the mere sensuousness of
verse, but in the ideas, the sentiment,
the image. "To change an utterance
into music does not perfect it, but materializes
it. The simple sentence justly
and forcibly expressing the pure thought
or naked sentiment without a dream as to
the sound or form of phrase, is the genuine
style, the expression, the
WORD
."

These conversations naturally drifted
to the supreme questions of the time—to
politics, philosophy and religion.
Dumont was that contradictory character,
found so often in many countries—a
royalist although a democrat, and
opposed to the Revolution, although he
detested the ancient rÃ©gime and actually
accepted the very aims and doctrines
which the Revolution contemplated.
Both he and Lamartine had been "fed
with the marrow of Greek and Roman
literature." They adored Liberty as a
well-sounding term before they came to
consider it as a holy thing and as the
moral quality in every free man.

Dumont was philosophic, like the century
in which he was born. In his house

{533}

there was no token to show that he was
a priest—neither breviary, nor crucifix,
nor image of a saint, nor priestly garment.
All these he relegated to the
sacristy. He considered the mystic rites
of Christianity which he performed as
belonging to the routine of his profession,
to be little else than a ritual of no
importance, a code of morals illustrated
by symbolic dogmas and traditional practices,
that did not encroach on his mental
independence and reason. He spoke
of God to an infantile people, using the
dialect of the sanctuary. But when he
returned home he discoursed in the language
of Plato, Cicero and Rousseau.
His mind was incredulous, but his soul,
softened by his sad fortune, was religious.
His great goodness of heart enabled him
to give to this vague piety the form and
reality of a precise faith. He constrained
his intelligence to bow under the yoke of
Catholicism and the dogmas of religion.
He read and admired the writings of
Chateaubriand and others of the time,
but he was not convinced; he did not
believe what they taught.

Lamartine, on the other hand, was influenced
by the religion of his infancy.
Piety always came back to him when he
was alone; it made him better, as though
the thought of man when he is isolated
from others was his best counsellor. It
was not so much a matter of conviction,
as a wish that it should be true. The
poetry and affectionateness of religion
swayed his will. He could contemplate
the mystery of the Incarnation as filling,
or at least bridging over, the unmeasurable
space between humanity and God.
If he did not quite admit this as actual
fact, he revered it as a wonderful poem
of the soul. He embellished it with the
charms of his imagination, he embalmed
it with his desires, he colored it with the
tints of his thought and enthusiasm; in
short,—he subordinated his rebellious
reason to this earnest desire to believe,
so that he might be able to love and
pray. He put away from him, as by
force, every shadow of doubt and repugnance,
and almost succeeded in producing
the illusions for which he was so eager,
and in conforming the habit of his soul
to the current sentiment of the epoch.
If he did not really worship his mother's
God as his own God, he at least carried
him in his heart as an idol.

The cordial relations of the two friends
were maintained for years. The priest
continued to minister in his little church
and gave much assistance to the mother
of Lamartine in her charities. Above
his grave in the cemetery is a stone with
a brief epitaph, and beneath it the words:
"Alphonse de Lamartine Ã  son ami."

The mental depression under which
Lamartine labored, seriously affected
his health. The family physician was
alarmed. Plainly enough it was from
causes outside of the province of medicine
and so instead of prescribing medicines
he ordered the young man to go to
Aix in Savoy, to the hot sulphur springs.
He borrowed money from a friend of
the family and went. Vignet procured
a room for him, and paid him several
visits during his sojourn. It was early
Autumn. October had just begun, and
the leaves on the trees had put on their
colors. The bathing season was over,
and the usual guests had gone away,
leaving the place solitary.

There was another patient in the
house. This was a lady from Paris. She
was in a decline and had been at Aix
several months. Lamartine, however,
had no inclination to see her.

An accident on the lake brought them
together in which he rescued her from
imminent peril of life. The acquaintance
thus begun became at once an ardent
attachment. Lamartine describes
it as "repose of the heart, after having
met with the long-sought and till then
unfound object of its restless adoration;
the long-desired idol of that vague, unquiet
adoration of supreme beauty which
agitates the soul till the divinity has
been discovered."

{534}

This lady, the "Julie" of his story,
was the wife of an old man, a friend of
the Emperor Napoleon. He had first
seen her at the convent where she was
receiving her education. She was a native
of the island where the
Virginia
of
the romance was said to have been born,
and had been brought to France. She
was without friends to protect her or the
necessary dowry to attract proposals of
marriage. The old gentleman in pity
for her friendless condition, had married
her, receiving her as a daughter and not
as a wife. Her health had given way,
and he sent her to Aix in hope that
the mountain air and bathing might restore
her.

She had no liking for gallantry. Yet
she did not affect prudery or reserve.
She declared her understanding of their
peculiar relations in terms the most
forceful: "Eternity in one instant and
the Infinite in one sensation." Then she
said further: "I do not know whether
this is what is called love; nor do I wish
to know; but it is the most supreme and
entire happiness that the soul of one
created being can draw from the soul,
eyes and voice of another being like herself—a
being who, till now, was wanting
to her happiness, and whose existence
she completes."

She had lived among philosophers of
the French school, and did not have
views like those of the women of Europe
who bowed before another criterion than
their conscience. "I believe," said she,
"in the God who has engraved his symbol
in Nature, his law in our hearts, his
morality in our reason. Reason, feeling
and conscience are the only revelation in
which I believe." She then asked that
this their mutual affection should remain
"like a pure thought" and so be in no
way blended with any other relations.

In this way six weeks passed by.
They adhered strictly to their line of
action, yet she fretted jealously at the
thought that Lamartine would love another
after her death, and even attempted
suicide; but presently yielded the point,
and even predicted that he would yet
find another like and as dear as herself.

Winter drew near and they left Savoy
for their respective homes. Unknown to
her, Lamartine followed her travelling
coach to Paris, and then went to Milly
where Vignet was awaiting him.

He remained at home till January. He
had exhausted his allowance of money.
His mother observed his restlessness and
attributed it to want of diversion. She
presented him with a diamond, the last
jewel which she had retained from her
young girlhood, and bade him go to
Paris. "It is the last token of my love,"
said she,—"and I stake it in the lottery
of Providence."

This gift had a wholesome influence.
He became thenceforth more prudent in
the expending of money, and never parted
with the gem till his other resources
were exhausted. He no more affected to
be engaged in study while actually
spending his time in dissipation. He
directed his days to reading in history,
science, political economy and diplomacy.
The Count de Virieu was in
Paris and received him to share his
modest lodgings.

Nevertheless, his money though now
carefully managed, was finally exhausted.
He was called upon by old
creditors to pay the "debts of honor"
that he had incurred in former years.
He had renewed his intimacy with Julie,
and her husband gave him the warmest
of welcomes. Her health was failing
fast, and he took frequent excursions
with her about Paris in the hope of
benefit. At the end of the winter the
alternative was presented to support
himself or go back to Milly.

When in college he had written verses
which his friends there greatly admired.
He continued to do so at different times,
and had brought a collection of them to
Paris. He now offered them to publishers
but without success. He was obliged
to submit. He made a farewell excursion

{535}

with Julie to St. Cloud, and left Paris
the next morning.

That summer was for him more terrible
than ever. He saw no hope of emerging
from poverty and obscurity. Crops
failed that year and the resources of the
family were straitened to actual penury.
His health suffered and serious results
were apprehended. He was again ordered
to go to Aix. His mother procured
the money for him by surreptitiously
selling trees that were growing
on their little farm.

A note from Julie informed him that
her husband was ill, but told him to go
to Aix and wait for her. When he arrived
there, there came a package forwarded
from Chambery enclosing letters
from Paris. One of these was from Julie
[1]

containing a lock of hair and bidding
him farewell. It had been herself and
not her husband, that was ill and dying.
She had given up her former disbelief.
"God will send you another sister," she
wrote, "and she will be the pious helpmate
of your life. I will ask it of him."

A letter from the husband asked Lamartine
to continue to him as a son.

The shock almost bereft him of reason.
He wandered for months over the mountains
of Savoy and Switzerland, as he
describes, "like a darkened soul that
had lost the light of heaven and had no
mind for that of earth." His mother
secretly procured money for him in the
hope that travel would alleviate his condition,
the cause of which she did not
imagine. Autumn was passing, however,
and she could no longer frame excuses
for his absence. He must return
home.

As he was returning in the boat from
Lyons, he contemplated the prospects
before him. He had chafed for an active
life, and destiny was compelling him to
fold his wings in the nest from which
he had been eager to escape. Now, in
his exhaustion, he was willing to give
up, hoping soon to die. "I was convinced,"
says he, "that in those months
of love, of delirium and of grief, my
heart had exhausted all the delights and
bitternesses of a long life; that I had
nothing more than for some months
more to bury the memory of Julie under
the ashes of my heart; and that the
angel whose steps I had followed in
thought into another life would soon
call me to shorten my absence and begin
the eternal love. The feeling that this
was sure, now gave me comfort and enabled
me to accept with patience the interval
which I believed would be a short
one between the parting and the reunion."

When the boat arrived at MÃ¢con,
Lamartine saw nobody at the landing to
welcome him. But as he picked up his
valise he found himself suddenly embraced
and almost smothered by the caresses
of a dog. It was Azor, the same
that had so abruptly broken up his Ossianic
interview, seven years before,
with Lucy, on the terrace. It was necessary
to give him a strap of the valise
to hold to keep him from getting under
the feet of other travellers.

The Chevalier, his father, however,
was only a little way off. He was watching
with an opera-glass to see whether
the dog had found his son. He now
conducted him home by the most frequented
streets, as if to show him to
those whom he met. The dog had already
gone to announce him, and Lamartine
found his mother and sisters at the
door.

The house had been recently purchased
for a winter residence. The
mother had besought this outlay for the
sake of her five daughters, to be able to
provide them with tutors and governesses
and to introduce them advantageously
into society. The Chevalier lost
no time in showing his son the various
rooms and conveniences and bringing
him to the apartment for himself.

{536}

Lamartine had retired for the evening
when his mother came into the room.
She had noted his profound depression
and now silently caressed him.

"Who would have told me," said she,
"that in twenty-two years I would see
my child blighted in the vigor of his
soul and heart, and his countenance enshrouded
in a secret grief?"

Then, forbearing to enquire further,
she explained the embarrassed condition
of the family. Their property, always
small, had been greatly reduced by the
expenses of his education, travels, and
wayward adventures. "I do not mention
this to reproach you," said she;
"you know that if my tears could have
been changed into gold for you, I would
have put it into your hands."

The purchase of the house, the saving
of money to furnish dowries for his sisters,
and bad harvests had narrowed
their circumstances. His father had
worried at the thought of leaving his
children without a patrimony; and
though he had taken great delight in
them in their tender years, he reproached
himself now for their existence.

What she could do to help, she had
done. In their various exigencies she
had been generously helped by Madame
Paradis, their neighbor. This lady had
done this from affection, only stipulating
that their father should not know.
She had furnished the money for Lamartine's
expenses.

"I had hoped," she continued, "that
your father's family would perceive the
craving for activity which is wasting
your youth, and be prompted to the outlay
necessary to enable you to enter and
go through with the preparatory course
for an administrative or diplomatic career.
I have reasoned with them, prayed,
conjured, wept, humbled myself before
them as it is glorious and agreeable for
a mother to humiliate herself for her
son. It is in vain."

As he was to be the heir to their estates,
they saw no necessity for him to
desire or be ambitious for an active career
beyond their sphere of life. Hence her
pleading had only brought harsh words
and unkind feeling toward herself without
doing him any service.

If Providence had granted her wish
she would have made use of every opportunity
to open for him a larger horizon,
and a career worthy of him. But he
must wait. She also asked him to make
her his only confidant. A complaint to
his father would drive him to despair,
because he could not help. "Accept
this obscure and unoccupied life for a
few years," she pleaded. "I will pray
God to move the hearts of your uncles
and aunts, and to open for my son that
field of activity, extent, glory and happy
fortune, which he has permitted a mother
to desire for such a son as you."

To such an appeal Lamartine could
only acquiesce. The life upon which he
thus entered has had many counterparts.
The older uncle gave law to the whole
family as its recognized head. He and
his nephew had many angry encounters.
The mother would endeavor anxiously
to reconcile them. The Chevalier, bearing
in mind the interest of all his children,
remained neutral.

The uncle, regarding Alphonse as his
prospective successor, desired him to remain
quietly at home, cultivate science,
apply himself to agriculture and domestic
economy, and in time become the
head of a family in the province. Lamartine
acknowledged that such a career
would have been the most natural and
happy. "But," he adds, "everyone
when coming into the world has his
allotment marked out in his nature.
This career was not for me, and my
uncle had not been able to read the fact
in my eyes."

His life at MÃ¢con that winter was as
monotonous as that of monks in a cloister.
He spent the forenoons in his room
with his books and dog. Dinner was at
noon; and after that all assembled at
the mansion of the uncle. This was a

{537}

season to be dreaded. His mother was
then subjected to reproaches and remonstrances
from every one for every trifling
fault of her children. The aunts seemed
to regard them as their own, and actually
loved their brother's wife; but they desired
to exercise the rights of motherhood
without the burdens. Sometimes
she would repel their attacks, but oftener
she only wept. Then would follow explanations,
excuses and caresses; and
so it would go, only to be resumed the
next day.

She was a woman superior to them all,
high-spirited and dignified; but the future
interest of her children depended
on their good-will, and for this reason
she was submissive. "We called this
the Hour of Martyrdom," says Lamartine,
"and we sought to make it up to
her by redoubling our tenderness after
we came out."

In the afternoon, she helped the tutors
with her daughters, or herself received
visitors. Her house and discourse were
to her neighbors an attraction far exceeding
that of the majestic austerity at the
great house, the Hotel de Lamartine.
The Chevalier would go out to visit some
former comrade, or one of the older inhabitants,
when they would amuse themselves
with playing at checkers, backgammon
or "Boston."

Lamartine himself would repair to his
room, or walk out with his dog in the
paths that intersected the fields behind
the Alms House. There were grand
views in the distance, but he only gazed
on the Alps as the prisoner looks on the
wall beyond which he has tasted of sunshine,
love and freedom.

He also visited a comrade of his
father's at the place. The man was unable
to use his limbs, and kept himself
cheerful by working as a jeweler and repairer
of watches. Lamartine helped
him and became daily a welcome visitor.

The leading families of MÃ¢con cultivated
social relations, and there was a
drawing-room party somewhere every
night. Lamartine accompanied his
mother and sisters, but made his escape
before diversions began.

At his uncle's, however, it was different.
The visitors included the most
eminent men of the district, diplomats,
scholars and others of distinction. Ten
of these, with his uncle, organized the
Academy of MÃ¢con. It held meetings in
the library which were usually attended
by thirty or forty members. Papers
were presented on subjects of importance,
social, industrial or scientific.

Lamartine was admitted to membership
despite his youth at the proposition
of his uncle. He delivered his first discourse
upon the
Advantages Derived
from Interchange of Ideas between Peoples
by Means of Literature
. Years after he
burned this paper in disgust at its commonplace
character.

One of the most interesting members
of this Academy, M. de Larnaud, he describes
as "a Universal Dictionary in a
human form, all the ashes of the Alexandrian
Library contained in the skull
of a living man." M. de Larnaud, he
declares, "knew everything and impassioned
everything." He had engaged
in the Revolution in 1789 with the
ardor of a delirium, but after the massacre
of the Tenth of August, he turned his
sympathies to the victims. He was intimate
with the Girondins,—above all
with Madame Roland and Vergniaud—and
he accepted heartily their doctrine
of a free Republic which should be wise
and pure. He did not mourn their fate
on the scaffold which was their pedestal
for history, but he mourned that vote
which they gave "for the death of the
king to save the people." Although a
nation is often saved by a martyrdom,
he knew that it is never saved by a
crime.

M. de Larnaud had no less enthusiasm
for poetry and literature than for politics.
He was a comrade of Rouget de
Lisle, the author of the
Marsellaise

{538}

Hymn
; he had taken part at sittings of
the Academies; he was a member of all
the
Cercles
; he followed all the Courts,
visited all the
SalÃ´ns
, attended all the
theatres, absorbing all that was knowable,
all that pertained to the two orders
of things. He remembered everything
and would tell it with a manner and
gesture that made the hearer understand
and behold it all. Everything—antiquity,
past history and present—was
to be learned from him.

He was quick to perceive the bent of
Lamartine. He visited the young man
in his chamber and discoursed familiarly
with him, as though both were of the
same age and plane of intelligence. He
did not venture, however, to speak with
like freedom in the drawing-room in
presence of the uncle, the pious aunts,
and the various classes of visitors. But
in young Lamartine's chamber he would
display his old-time enthusiasm for the
great men and great achievements at
the beginning of the Revolution before
the period of the ascendancy of the populace,
the Commune of Paris, and the
Terror. The philosopher was again
manifest in him under the simulacrum
of the man of the world, and he denounced
the Imperial rÃ©gime of Bonaparte
with fierceness.

From him Lamartine derived the conception
of the scenes, the men and
characters which he set forth so admirably
in the
History of the Girondists
.
His friendship remained constant till
his death.

One day as Lamartine was walking in
the street his dog made the acquaintance
of another dog belonging to a physician
of the place. The owner was M. de
Ronot, who had been a fellow-student at
College. Warm friendship now sprang
up between them. Lamartine pays him
this tribute: "I was often absent from
the land of my birth, especially after
death had blighted all the roots of my
family; but I knew that there was one
who watched for my return, who followed
with his eye my adverse fortunes,
who fought against the envies, hatreds
and calumnies that grovelled on the soil
of our homestead—alas, about our gravestones,
and who received with delight
everything in my life that was good fortune,
and with grief everything that was
sad."

He died many years afterward with
the name of Lamartine on his lips. It
was at the period when Lamartine was
in deepest adversity, and abandoned by
the many who in brighter times had ardently
professed their friendship.

When the time came in spring for the
family to go back to Milly, the whole
family welcomed this modest abode as
an asylum. The mother resumed the
instructing of her daughters, and her
visits to the sick and poor. Lamartine
often went with her. He always found
living in a city to be intolerable, but
he brought his melancholy with him.
He renewed his intimacy with the AbbÃ©
Dumont at the garden of the parsonage,
and gradually recovered health and
spirits.

Translations of Byron's poems appeared
that season in French journals.
Lamartine was prompted to endeavors of
similar character. That autumn he
wrote several of his
Meditations
, and read
portions of them to his father. The old
Chevalier, who knew nothing of the new
school of poetry, was deeply affected,
but feared to utter praise, lest it should
be from parental partiality.

The second winter at the new house in
MÃ¢con was passed like the first. Lamartine
had no liking for the social entertainments.
When Lent came, he left
home and spent the spring and summer
with his other uncle, the AbbÃ© Lamartine,
at D'Urcy in Upper Burgundy.

This uncle had been compelled, by the
accident of having been a second son, to
take priest's orders. Thus interdicted
from having a family of his own he bestowed
his affection richly upon his
younger brother and children. He considered

{539}

them as his own, and Lamartine
was recognized as his heir. They spent
the summer and autumn in their younger
years, at his patriarchal mansion, and
he took an actual part in their education.
It was here that Lamartine acquired his
passion for life in the country.

The abbÃ© had spent his noviciate at
Paris, and mingled in society in the
time of Louis XV. He was a man of
the world rather than of the Church.
Relinquishing the priestly functions at
the Revolution, he now lived by himself
on his share of the paternal estate, a
Homeric life, hermit-like, as a philosopher
and cultivator of the soil.

His housekeeper, herself formerly a
nun, persuaded him to purchase dogs
and a horse for his nephew. Lamartine
had always been beloved by all the domestics,
and his uncle, who was the
most affectionate of men, treated him as
a personal friend rather than as a kinsman.

One afternoon in the latter part of
July, he was riding back from a jaunt in
the neighboring forest when a letter-carrier
delivered him a note from two
Roman ladies at an inn at Pont-de-Pany.
His uncle, in whom humor was a prominent
quality, demanded at once to know
the mystery.

"There must be no mystery with me,"
said he. "The heroes of a romance always
need a confidant, and I have known
both parts in my time."

He continued his badinage, promising
to be discreet as well as faithful; but
Lamartine, unable to endure it, protested
that he could not form any new attachment.

"That linden-tree is older than you,"
the uncle replied. "I have cut it five
times in twenty years, and it has more
sap and branches now than when I came
here."

"Burn it at the root," Lamartine retorted
in desperation, "and then see
whether it will spring up again."

It was an adventure of a new character.
The two ladies, the princess Regina
di —— and her aunt, had been commended
to his good offices by the Count
Saluce de ——, a Breton nobleman belonging
to an emigrant family, then living
at Rome. He had come temporarily
to France and took service in the Royal
Guard, there forming an intimate friendship
with Lamartine. The princess was
a maiden wife of sixteen who had been
forced against her will into a marriage
ceremony with an elderly kinsman, and
had fled with her aunt to France. The
count was her lover, and had been arrested
as he was about to accompany her.
Lamartine had been apprised of all this
before by letters from his friend, and now
complied faithfully with his wishes by
finding the two fugitives a residence at
Noyon near Geneva. Meanwhile a suit
was in progress for an annulment of the
marriage.

Some days afterward a letter came from
the count apprising Lamartine that this
would not take place. The princess was
liable, therefore, to forfeit her property,
and upon her return to Italy, to be imprisoned
in a convent. The prince, her
husband, who was old and infirm, had
desired the marriage only for the purpose
of assuring her estate to his heirs. He
now offered, if Count Saluce would not
press the suit, that he would cast a veil
over what had passed, and let her live
with her grandmother in future. This
would spare her reputation and social
position. But Saluce must go far away.

He decided to comply with the conditions,
and had already left Italy for
Spain to join his uncle's regiment and
embark for the Philippine Islands.

Lamartine deplored the fatal necessity
but felt himself obliged to approve the
course taken by his friend. Yet Regina
had not been consulted, and perhaps
she would have chosen exile with him
before freedom and fortune elsewhere.
Certainly, the count had constituted himself
judge and sacrificing priest without
consulting the victim, but the sacrifice

{540}

was commended by delicacy of sentiment,
by honor, virtue, even by love
itself.

When Lamartine met Regina she read
all in his face. As she perused the letter
she was seized with fury. She denounced
her lover as savage and cowardly, not
worthy of the least token of regard.
Hurrying to her room, she threw his
letters and keepsakes out of the window
and commanded her nurse to go and sink
them in the lake; that thus six months
of love and delirium might be swallowed
up. The nurse fully reciprocated the
sentiments of her mistress. She saw no
merit in such generosity as Saluce had
exhibited. A Roman would have gone
to every extreme, knowing love and
nothing else.

Three days passed before the young
princess made her appearance. She had
become more calm. She told Lamartine
that she was now undeceived; what she
had thought she loved was a phantom
that had vanished.

She was turning her regard upon him.
His unflagging kindness and assiduity
had affected her. But susceptible as he
might be, the memory of his own lost
one, and his friendship for Saluce, were
intervening. Finally, however, upon
learning that Lamartine would be in
Paris the coming winter, she declared
her purpose to be there likewise.

Her uncles had come for her, and she
returned with them to Rome. One of
them afterward accompanied her and her
grandmother to Paris, and Lamartine
met them there the coming winter.

He had now resolved to try his fortune
once more. It was declared by Charles
Fourier, that when God implanted a desire
in a human soul it was his promise
of its fruition. Lamartine was now to
realize its verity.

[1]

In the
Meditations
, Lamartine names an
Elvire

who has been conjectured to have been the same person.

"If you examine a man that has been well-disciplined and purified by
philosophy, you will find nothing that is unsound, false, or foul in him."

"The noble delight in the noble; the base do not; the bee goes to the
lotus from the wood; not so the frog, though living in the same lake."

POINT LOMA AND ITS LEGEND.

BY FRANK M. PIERCE.

How

describe its indescribable beauties:
the broad expanse of ocean;
land-locked bay, with craft of
war and commerce riding on its peaceful
bosom; nestling city; sunlit, fruitful
valleys, cut by sparkling, snow-fed
streams; majestic mountain range with
snow-capped peaks, like giant fingers
heavenward pointing—all touched by
soft and vitalizing breezes—one vast
Titanic picture, overwhelming self, while
"Soul," in fitting raiment stands visible,
a God.

In retrospective thought, seated on
its rock-ribbed, element-defying battlements,
I muse upon the Legend:

That here the wise ones of Lemuria—now
ocean-covered—reared a stately edifice,
a temple dedicated to the Gods of
Light, wherein they taught her worthy
youth the simple laws of life eternal:

That here the gods touched hands
with men and gave to them rich stores
of knowledge and of wisdom in such
measure as they could use unselfishly:

That here men living for the soul of
things made earth a heaven, themselves
gods, conscious of their oneness with the
Father (like their modern prototype, the
fearless Nazarene):

That from the temple-dome-crowned
Point, standing like mystic virgin, old
yet ever young—never yielding to the
dark waters' fond embrace when all to
Westward sank in one vast cataclysm—shone
to all the world a quenchless, pure,
white flame to light the way for mariners
on ocean's waters, and on the sea of
thought, that all might see and live:

That once, when darkness filled the
earth and men went blindly searching
for the light and found it not, then the
great Teacher from the temple—filled
with pity and compassion—went forth to
save the lost,—leaving the temple and
its sacred light in care of trusted ones,
charged on their lives to keep and hold
its precincts inviolate till her return;
their inspiration gone—careless and faithless
to their sacred trust—the light went
out and they in darkness perished; the
temple—refuge for the good and wise—was
sacked and leveled to the earth
from sight of men:

But caverned underneath (the Legend
runs) stand guarding genii, giants grim,
fairies, gnomes and sprites, to hold the
portals closed by pitfalls, ocean tides,
dire calamities and death, 'gainst venturous
ones and the faithless guardians
lingering near the whispering, moaning
caverns by the sea—till their Queen returns
to their release:

That in some coming age when men,
grown weary, heartsick, hopeless, wandering
in the trackless waste, shall face
again the rising Sun in search of ancient
Wisdom and the Truth, then the great
Teacher will again appear in human
guise, among her own—welcomed by the
wise-grown, faithful watchers, rejected
and reviled by those who faithless in the
past have been—to rear upon the ruins
of the old, a new and grander Temple,
dedicated to all that lives; and in its
pure white marble dome to fix a light—symbolic
of regenerate man—whose penetrating
rays shall reach to lowest depths
to light the ceaseless upward march of
evolution to the Heaven on Earth—the
Universal Brotherhood of Peace and
Good-Will, made perfect through the
travail, agony and blood of man, redeemed
from
SELF
.

{542}

EVOLUTION AND INVOLUTION.

BY H. A. FREEMAN.

Metaphysically

considered, evolution is Nature's process
of unfolding and bringing
about her changes and developments.
It goes on its way irresistibly and taken
as a whole moves in orderly routine.
This is not always obvious, but the exceptions
are only apparently such. The
fault lies in our lack of ability to observe
all the facts and conditions. If we
could investigate fully we should find
that all apparent hitches are balanced or
offset by an advance in some other direction
and that there has been and can be
no check or disorder in the process of
evolution.

Whatever deflects the course or
changes the character of an evolution
does not necessarily hinder it, and if it
seems to stop still that is only a question
of the point of view.

The people of a race, or nation, or a
community may deteriorate physically,
intellectually, or in their commercial
activity, but that does not prove that
their development has come to an end.
It only marks a cessation of progress
along certain special lines. The American
Indians are practically extinct, and
it may appear that their race evolution
has stopped. But that would be taking
note of only one aspect of their condition.
If we observe that they have decreased
in ferocity, diminished in numbers
and sunk to the commonplace grade
of hard working farmers we must agree
that their evolution does not proceed
along romantic lines as it did in the days
of Fenimore Cooper. But the few that
remain may be more useful for the
world's upbuilding than were all the
savage hordes that ever started out on
the war path to exterminate each other.

Numbers are not essential to a healthy
evolution. China with its starving
myriads is not a high example of progress.

The variations and fluctuations that
make themselves visible in evolution
are like ripples. We should never notice
them if we took a broader view.

Evolution does not go stiffly and solidly
forward like a self-propelled wall of
masonry. It is more like the resistless
ebb and flow of the incoming tide.

One ripple overwhelms or effaces
another and a curling breaker leaps up
from behind them and sprays the shore
far in advance of the main body of invading
waters.

Evolution reaches out similarly, now
advancing, now retreating in unconsidered
wavelets, always gaining, always
effacing the old with the new, and inevitably
dominating the entire situation
at last.

The ebb tide affords a symbol of
Involution

which lays bare the way for
another era of flood, so that every drop
in the ocean taking its turn may ultimately
rise to its highest mark of attainment.

Involution is usually described as a
sort of compensatory process, coÃ¶rdinate
with evolution, though not co-incident
with it. It is regarded as a return
swing of the pendulum of evolution and
is sometimes crudely illustrated by comparing
the two to the corresponding
halves of a circle matched together so as
to form a completed ring or hoop. But
this symbol though impressive is misleading,
for involution matched with
evolution can not bring about any condition
of finality.

If that were possible evolution would

{543}

end in extinction—and extinction is unthinkable.

The pairing of the two processes does
not complete a circle. One does not
match the other and neither can undo
the other's work. If there
could
be a
counter-action between them, each would
efface the results of the other, as soon as
its hour of activity began.

For illustration one may consider the
progress of a bud which in due course of
evolution unfolds into a rose fully expanded.
That rose does not refold and
become again a bud.

And if it did, that would not be involution.
It would be only retrogression.
Involution does not follow upon the
heels of evolution to match its movements
with opposing influences. It
doesn't interfere at all. If it did there
would be no unfolding of Nature's plans,
for all her efforts would cancel each
other.

Doubtless the two processes work
towards the same result in obedience to
a systematic divine idea and purpose,
and, not leading up to any finality, they
form a cycle rather than a circle and
may be best pictured as a continuous
spiral and not as a completed hoop.

It would then be seen that involution
and evolution succeed each other in rotation
as the night follows day and the
day gives place to night. Each period
of one followed by the other forms a coil
in the spiral. And the spiral is continuous,
being itself only one coil in a
greater cycle which, in its turn, forms
part of a still more extensive series of
coils. And thus they go on to infinity,
for they can never reach a limit. And
the processes of our involution and evolution
are only coils of a cycle that has
gone on forever and they will continue
to form new coils to all eternity.

But the contemplation of the present
coil in which we find ourselves involved
is quite confusing enough for it extends
back farther than our comprehension
can grasp and is still very far from
finished. It will never be complete until
we have all reached our limit of attainment,
and that is yet a long way
ahead of us.

It is obvious that these mighty processes
lead to some ultimate object, and
that they could never have been started
into operation without a reason.

The ultimate object is easily found.
It is quite evidently progress. And
the reason seems by analogy to be similar
to that which dominates every living
thing in the Universe—the desire to
expand, to create, to perpetuate. This
desire seems to have impelled that incomprehensible
Power which is back of
all life and expression to make itself
manifest. A Breath of itself took the
form of matter and in obedience to the
immutable law of compensation sought
at once to return to its original exalted
condition.

That descent into matter was Involution.
The regeneration, the re-ascent
to the original purity is Evolution.

The creative Consciousness awoke to
a desire for manifestation and produced
from its thought, substance. Then were
set in motion the forces through whose
operations substance took on form and
living organisms appeared.

The degradation of that Spiritual Essence
into a condition of matter was Involution.
It was a degradation or
descent because it was a change. No
change could have exalted it, so the altered
condition was a descent. The
process of regeneration, the work of
purification from the stain of material
existence began at once and still goes
on. And that is evolution.

When man began to assume domination
over the other products of evolution
and became a reasoning, responsible
creature, that was evidence that he is
the medium through which matter is to
be uplifted to its former spiritual condition.
In other words, it is a certainty
that matter reaches its highest development
in man and that the next step beyond

{544}

the physical man is the divine man—the
man of pure spirituality practically
unsullied by matter. All the processes
of evolution lead to the supremacy of the
physical man over all other material development,
and as he continues to advance
he will inevitably reach a condition
so exalted as to be virtually divine
while still living in the flesh. Such men
exist even to-day and have been known
in all ages.

They are those who occasionally appear
as Saviours and Messiahs. They are
the pioneer wavelets which spray the
shore in advance of the incoming tide.

When man reaches that point of perfection
that will free him from the material
or physical life forever, his evolution
is complete and involution may
begin again upon a new world as it has
done countless millions of times before
and will continue to do to all eternity.

We cannot of course comprehend why
the Divine Consciousness has arranged
all this stupendous machinery for the
mere sake of becoming manifest. We
cannot assume that it is for any reason
that we could understand even though
it were revealed to us. But we may
wonder less perhaps when we consider
that time and space are nothing in actual
fact, and the immensity of our universe
and the tremendous stretches of time
that paralyze all thought of reckoning
are but trifles not to be considered in
contemplating the Infinite.

Our entire solar system doesn't make
a speck in space and the age of the world
cannot be reckoned, for time has no
value, no existence in the super-material
world.

It is frequently urged by sceptics that
to an all powerful consciousness it
should be easy to assume a personal
character without employing the complicated
process of producing mankind and
awaiting humanity's slow growth to a
divine perfection. But when it comes to
preparing plans and specifications for a
better and simpler method they have
never shown ability superior to the divine
thought.

Leaving out the consideration of time
and the immensity of the finite world,
which are of no importance to the Supreme
Architect, the plan seems simple
enough. There was a divine desire for
expression. The Supreme was alone and
unmanifest. There was consciousness
but no knowledge, for there was nothing
to know. The impulse to Be, produced
the world, every atom of which is part
of the Creator that produced it. The
world is synthesized in man, for man
holds in his physical body the essence
of everything that is in the world.
There is nothing, mineral, vegetable,
animal, solid, fluid or gaseous that has
not its place in man's organization. Man
is pressing forward, evolving to a condition
of purity that shall make him
perfect and divine, a God enriched with
the knowledge gained from numberless
lives on earth. He becomes again a
spark of the Supreme, but individualized
and omniscient. And thus is the divine
purpose accomplished and the divine impersonal
self made divinely manifest.

Whether this be the true theory or not
cannot be determined by any process of
reasoning. The Finite mind is unable
to comprehend the Infinite. We cannot
analyze the act of the super-mundane
power or find a reason that we can understand
and prove by mental progress.

So therefore we can not trace involution
even as we can evolution, for it is
not of this plane. Whatever we note
that seems to us to be involution is only
some variation of the other. It has to
do with our material progress while involution
is a product of the impulse of a
consciousness beyond our comprehension.

We may then consider involution
briefly as the descent of spirit into a material
condition and evolution as the refinement
of matter into spirit. We may
safely believe that under this stupendous
plan the present is not the first and

{545}

will not be the last cycle, but that they
stretch their never ending spirals in both
directions without limit. Whether or
not there
ever
was a beginning to this
endless coil of cycles of involution and
evolution is beyond our feeble comprehension.

Logic and reason are but the dull
weapons of conquest over problems of
the Finite, and are entirely too crude to
be used with confidence in giving battle
to the mysteries of the Infinite.

Only the intuitions can help us beyond
the boundaries of the super-material
world and they tell us that there
never was a beginning to the things
which are and that there will never be
an end. This condition of Being, without
ever a time of actual commencing, is
paradoxical and confusing to the mind
and we cannot easily realize that although
apparently impossible it is true.
But it is only one of many similar contradictions
that attend upon the Contemplation
of Infinity.

We cannot even comprehend a beginning
to the present cycle of our existence.
The birth of this world is lost in
the misty obscurity of the infinite Past
and is as hopelessly beyond us as is the
record of the countless myriads of similar
creations which preceded it. It is
therefore of little value to attempt to fix
an era from which to begin tracing the
evolution of man from the irresponsible,
mindless monster that archaic teachings
describe him to have been before he assumed
conscious domination over the
other creatures of this world. And it is
equally vain to seek for information regarding
the various changes through
which he arrived at even that primitive
condition of being only a mass of inert
semi-conscious matter. Perhaps in this
as in the other aspects of the transmigration
of the Divine into the Finite,
there never was any beginning.

The Vedanta, which is that phase of
Indian Philosophy that treats specially
on this subject, says that the world proceeded
from an inscrutable principle,
darkness, neither existent nor non-existent
and from "one that breathed without
afflation, other than which there was
nothing, beyond it nothing."

According to the Vedanta there is but
one substance or reality immutable and
eternal, the supreme spirit,
the impersonal
Self
, the spiritual absolute
atman
—and
that of course is summed up in
the idea of Deity.

Science, which professes to reject all
theories that cannot be proven, suggests
tentatively that all of nature's innumerable
products have evolved from the result
of a fortuitous combination of unconscious
causes that produced a beginning.

But there should be something beyond
mere accident in the movements of non-intelligent
forces. There must always
be a first cause even for a beginning and
that first cause cannot be an accident.

That should be an uncomfortable
theory for those who are scientific
enough to believe it, for they have no
guarantee against other accidents of Nature.
They can never feel secure against
some awkward occurrence that might
counteract that initial commingling of
forces and restore this world to its
original condition of nothingness.

We read of various vibrations that
shiver into the production of light,
color, heat, sound, power, electricity and
even the life principle, but these vibrations
are not even said to be self-produced.
There has never been a theory
satisfactory to the intuitions—which are
the most accurate of all our truth finders,
except that of an universal, Conscious
Self, impersonal but all pervasive, that
is the Cause, the Beginning and the ultimate
Attainment of everything.

The only theory that agrees with the
intuitions without offending the reasoning
perceptions should offer the safest
foundation upon which to build a philosophy.
It is therefore not remarkable
that ages ago the sages of the Orient,

{546}

men who were fitted by training and inherited
faculties for metaphysical contemplation,
elaborated a philosophy
based upon the belief in an impersonal
First Cause that seeks personality only
through involving Spirit in matter and
evolving back to Spirit. Tinted with the
results of that experience, Spirit, they believe,
becomes self-conscious and individualized
by its contact with a life or
lives of manifestation. Evidently it can
never be absolutely stainless again. It
has exchanged entire purity for knowledge
and self-consciousness. Therefore,
man, who is the highest attainment of
this evolution, can never be infinitely
perfect, but can ever more and more approximate
to perfection. He can never
again be absorbed and swallowed up and
engulfed in absolute divinity. He will
never become entirely Divine in the
sense of being re-absorbed into the unrecognizable
All-consciousness, for that
would extinguish all the effects of his
earth experiences and his long pilgrimage
would be a profitless waste of time
and toil. He has become an individualized
conscious being, less than Deity,
but by reason of his completed evolution
he is relatively a God to us.

He may therefore reach up to the Infinite
even now, and can also extend a hand
down to Earth to help us on our upward
climb. Innumerable divine men have
been reborn and have dwelt among us to
teach us how to live. Even in comparatively
modern times we have a line
of such whose example and teachings
have helped forward our evolution and
made it easier for us.

From Zoroaster and Buddha and Jesus
and others have come revelations that
justify the theory of man's perfectibility
through evolution and as we can trace the
growth of all matter up to its culmination
in humanity, the divine plan seems
to stand revealed, and our ultimate destiny
is plainly outlined. The method of
evolution, like everything else in Nature,
seems entirely a process of compensations.
We gain and renounce; we take
on higher qualities and drop the meaner
characteristics. We advance by such
methods as we can command as we go
along. Higher ideals being reached, we
look upward for still loftier points of attainment.

In the prehistoric stages of our development,
while pure physicality dominated
us, we asserted our supremacy by
superior strength or speed. Further
along a cunning mentality gave us a
wider range of power. Still later we have
grown into wisdom, and as we near the
end we shall discard all the physical
desires, the tastes and appetites, the
hopes and ambitions, the affections and
passions that tie us to the earth life, and
take on instead the finer spiritual attributes
that are inseparable from the
higher planes of existence.

The severing of the earth desires
marks the end of the process of evolution
of spirit from matter. What follows
that we may infer from analogy. The
process of unfolding doubtless continues
on planes of which we have no
conception, but obviously need not dread
to encounter.

Of course we have moved slowly forward
in our various stages of development
from whatever we were before we
took on human qualities up to our present
degree of attainment. It is not hard
to believe that we have developed superior
understanding and the other higher
attributes of humanity only as our
growing needs and opening opportunities
have called for them.

The evolution of species and the laws
governing the development of physical
organs as they became necessary for the
growth and preservation of the infinite
variety of living things have been a
favorite study for materialistic scientists
for the past century. More than that,
long ago the learned Jean Baptiste Lamarck
formulated four propositions that
are now accepted as self-evident.

First. Life, by its proper forces, tends

{547}

continually to increase the volume of
every body possessing it, and to enlarge
its parts up to a limit which it brings
about. This covers the phenomenon of
growth to maturity.

Second. The production of a new
organ in an animal body results from
the supervention of a new want continuing
to make itself felt, and a new movement
which this want gives birth to
and encourages.

This is shown in the long neck of the
giraffe, which enables him to feed on
the tender top leaves of tall tropical
plants, and in the camel's hump which
supplies him with vigor during long intervals
without feeding, and the receptacle
for water, which enables him to
traverse long stretches of barren and
streamless lands.

Third. The development of organs
and their force of action are constantly
in ratio to the employment of those
organs.

The kangaroo, a large animal carrying
its young for safety in a natural
pouch, stands erect and never uses its
fore legs in walking. It leaps forward
in prodigious bounds, propelled by the
muscular power of its tail, which has
grown and developed beyond even the
hind legs in strength; while the fore
legs have dwindled to insignificant size
and importance.

Fourth. All which has been laid down
or changed in the organization of individuals
in the course of their life, is conserved
by generation and transmitted to
the new individuals which proceed from
those which have undergone these
changes.

This is because evolution carries us
constantly beyond certain needs and
progress does not let us go back to those
needs, neither in our own persons nor in
those of our posterity. Man and beast
alike have only and always such organs
as they require and no others. The
laws of heredity are not whimsical or
recalcitrant, and the changes brought
about by evolution are carried forward
by them in strict obedience to its demands.
Recognizing this fact, but
building from a false premise, the followers
of Darwin search for a link
to connect humanity with the tailless
apes of earlier periods, assuming that
man was developed from them, and that
the ape is the link between mankind
and the next lower order of being.
There is absolutely nothing in support
of this theory beyond a resemblance in
the physical conformation. And that
is far more likely to result from the ape
being a descendant of prehistoric man.

All these speculators stop short at
any valuable foundation on which to
build theories. They see in evolution
only the generation and development of
living organisms and the reason or cause
of the infinite variety of form, color and
habits.

Kant and Laplace theorized vaguely
on the formation of the solar system
from a gaseous condition to its present
character, but they shared the perplexity
of all biological thinkers when they endeavored
to peer behind the mechanical
beginning in search of a First Cause. It
is probable that even the mechanical beginning
had never a first hour or day or
year or era. And so Science, bound and
boxed up in materialism, observes the
growth and development of species and
placidly stops at that, having begun with
a guess and ended with—a bundle of
axiomatic conclusions.

But the philosophy of the ancients,
backed up by the teachings of the divine
men who from time to time have
come back to us, and endorsed by our
own inner convictions, tells us that evolution
is the concerted effort of all the
atoms that comprise the Universe to return
to a condition not recognized by
science—the condition of spirit which is
the ultimate aim of everything.

And every infinitesimal atom is alive
and has a consciousness of its own. They
cluster together and form living organisms,

{548}

developing and progressing in even
pace with those organisms, flying off into
space as their work goes on and rushing
together to build up some other organism.
Had we ultra-microscopic vision
we could see them streaming from
us continually and being replaced by
corresponding streams of new atoms.
And each one of these has its own divine
spark. It is a living entity.

They abide with us according to our
attraction, some shunning us, others preferring
us. Evil people attract such
atoms as have just come from others of
like disposition and leave their impress
upon them and gain nothing good from
them. Every evil thought taints every
atom of the stream that we contact with
at the time. They advance in their evolutions
no faster than does humanity
and reach spirituality when we do and
not sooner or later. Man arrives finally
at this condition clothed in the "spiritual
body" of which theologians speak
without any idea or comprehension of
its true nature.

All who would shun contact with the
particles that emanate from vile people
must live the life that repels such atoms.
Those who live a life of pure thought
and fraternal consideration draw towards
them atoms of such quality as makes
their personality pleasant and attractive
and their bearing gracious. No pure
life builds up a vile personality. There
are other ways to recognize traits of
character besides the mere facial expression.
Even scientists know that.

It is therefore evident that every one
should shun evil thought just as he
would any other deadly and destructive
infection. It rests with every man to
carry forward with him on his upward
journey all the material that goes toward
his own physical composition.

There is no one who has not attracted
all grades of atoms to him, and it is well
to bear in mind that they are the very
same that have formed the bodies of all
the population of the world, man and
beast, since life first was. There has
been no addition, no diminution. Nothing
in nature is ever destroyed. Nothing
ever ceases to be. There is no
place to banish material. It must be
spiritualized and we must be the medium.

And, therefore, it is no poetic fancy
to say that we are of one common clay
and that humanity is all one. Every
man, at every moment, is building and
rebuilding himself of the same materials,
particle for particle as have built up
every other man. Prince or pauper,
saint or demon, society flower or foul
tramp, we are all of the very same dust
and we can determine which sort we
shall use for our own bodies. It is not
a question of proximity. It is entirely
one of sympathy and character and
affinity. We evolve as fast as our
thoughts and conduct permit, and we
purify our souls and our bodies alike
and together.

If we recognize the brotherhood of
humanity we need no reminding to see
that it is our duty to ourselves—to our
personal selves as well as to our spiritual
selves, to help to make cleaner and
sweeter the whole world through our
own mental, moral and the resultant
spiritual cleanness. That will not hurry
evolution much in each separate instance,
but by the contagion of sympathy
and the dynamic power of thought these
beneficent, physical atoms can be attracted
to us and we can carry about
with us their gentle influence for good.

That is the secret of the curative influence
of sweetsouled people upon those
who are sick in mind or body, and if
people could understand these influences
as they are and value them justly we
should soon see a happier world with
less sorrow, less injustice, less sickness
and a far wider recognition of the material
as well as spiritual truth that
brotherhood is an universal fact in Nature,
and that our evolution can never
be complete until all realize it and live
accordingly.

THE CYCLE OF LIFE.

BY MARY KONOPNITSKY.

TRANSLATED FROM THE POLISH BY V.Â A.Â H.

PRELUDE.

In

the new morn, that dawns above
the world, I put aside the black
and sombre harp, that plays and
sings so sadly. For, from the ocean's
farthest shore, with the first daybreak
blushes, with the golden arrows of the
sun, there comes on rosy wings, all radiant
with fiery auroras, a new song, a
bird of the arriving spring.

In the new morn, that dawns above
the world, I stretch the golden strings, I
weave them from the day-beams, I paint
them with the iris dew. For through
the mould of sorrows, there breaks the
music of mountain waterfalls; their
vernal voice and chime now reach me
from every rock and rill, and a new
flowery raiment is again woven for the
earth.

In the new morn, that dawns above
the world, I tie fresh golden cords of
sound,—not for the pain, not for the
longing in the gloom, not for the old
complaint of the lonely heart. I send
them into the blue infinitudes unrestrained,
I launch them from globe to
globe, into the farthest space. From
star to star there glistens of my strings
the golden grate.

I.

I am a ray. The fount of Light I
cannot circumscribe. And yet I fly.
Through the dark nights I fly, through
stars and pallid moons; I kindle ephemeral
scintillations, I send out my
trembling light towards infinity's eternal
flame, from which shines forth the
sun of all the suns. And now I darken,
totter, pale; I lose my breath, my hope,
I smoulder like a spark.

And lo! again I energize my rays, cast
into endless skies; again I illume myself
and burn; I reach forth, I fly in space as
a fiery ribbon from the spindle of the
spirit. Now my tiny ray approaches
the great sun; it is already burning
with eternity's first blush. As an arrow
I sling myself into the bright path, illuminated
by the rosy dawn. I am a ray—the
fount of Light I cannot circumscribe.
Let me, then, be encompassed
by its dome.

II.

I am a spark of eternity; and I am a
pilgrim. Even to-day shall I pass away,
after a while, after an hour's stroke, together
with the smoke of the shepherd's
fire, which writhes in blue strands over
the forest in the eve, and disappears in
the tears of dew before the night. Even
to-day shall I be divorced from that
power, which holds me here from the
twilight to the twilight, and the sun
shall not see me more with his golden
eyes.

I am a spark of eternity. Beyond the
cold ashes I shall exist even to the
dawn, ... And then in my own
embers shall I wax in brightness, glow
as gold and burn as ruby; I shall pass
through the grayness of the dust of this
my bed, and before the rosy dawn shall
have bathed herself in dew, before the
sun shall have lifted his golden gaze
from beyond the sea, I shall strike into
the flames of life.

III.

How many dawns, how many twilights
have I passed? Do I know it
myself? Through how many gates of

{550}

body and of soul have I entered into life,
as an eternal voyager, who is born daily,
now here, now there, from the sleep of
death, in the earliest morn.

And then, exhausted, I departed to the
West, through the great twilight dusk,
which, all blazing with gold and red as
blood, led me into the silent fields of
blue, upon the dreamy meadows of the
moon, all heaving with the beating of
the wings of Psyche-butterflies, where
I sought my sleep, and my head leaning
on eternity's great bosom, I rested after
a life and before a life.

IV.

Myself—the gate, and myself—the
path, once only in this cycle have I issued
from the Divine Light. Once only
blew its breath for all bodies and souls,
once only has it in the morning of Day
opened its bosom of luminous archetypal
thought,—and all subsequent myriads of
forms, before and now, were sculptured
by myself.

Lo! I emerge from the conflagration
of blood; I come in the likeness of
a child, I who am a lion, crouching for
the powers of the heavens and of the
earth. And I depart into the night,
through the blood and through the pain,
crouching as a shadow, for the dawn and
for the day. After a time, after a moment
I increase in strength, I spring up
in the dust. My germ of existence now
feels hunger of life; it attracts life's
forces and lifts green blades above the
grave. The sun now warms it for a new
day of its immortal labor.

V.

With no gift am I favored in my early
hour. All my radiance have I spun myself
through many nights and shadows.
And all my powers upon the earth and in
the heavens have I obtained from my own
mystic depths. Every form I have, it
is of ages' toil, it is an effort of many
births, a battle of many darkling
deaths.

What light have I, by a promethean
labor, through thousand lives, spark by
spark have I stolen it from the sun,
spark by spark have I seized it from the
blushes of the morning. The rosy coral
of the dawns, and lilies' whiteness have
I plucked unseen in the gardens of the
night from the silvery stars. There is
no color and no sound upon the waving
meadows, among the nests of eagles or
of nightingales, which through the ages,
in ruins' coldness and scorching heat of
life I have not worked out from a laughter
to a groan,—alive by my own self.

VI.

And my right is to upwards grow
through all the worlds. And my right
is to expand my heart through all the
worlds. In storms, in silence I burst the
bars of death's prisons, and strike the
metal of the all-awakening bell!

Lightning of life, and thunderbolt of
life I let into the dark camera of death,
into the house of dust. And touched by
a spark of the spirit the dust explodes
with life, the soil opens, waving the
flowers of new spring, and again breathes
joyous in the splendor of the day.

VII.

The soul-bird builds her cage herself,—with
songs and flapping of her wings,—and
enters then its gates all fascinated
with the life.

But soon the winged guest, from the
infinity, newcomer, striking her prison's
trellis-wall, reddens her golden
pinions with the ruby blood.

She hushes then in the dusky shadows
of her house; a longing eats her heart
away for the freedom of the dawn.

Till overcome with pain she strikes
her breast against the walls and breaks
the cage herself.

With songs and flapping of her wings,
from the dusk, called life, she flies away
near to the gates of the eternal light.

VIII.

Upon the dark and stormy roads I
walk, bare-footed, poor; I onward pass,

{551}

naked and hungry, through life's cold
and night; only one light can brighten
there my way and feed my strength,—the
light of daring, burning in my
breast; it helps me more than stars and
more than moons. No sun in heaven
can kindle it in me, but I must get it
from myself, striking my spirit against
the hard experiences of life, that the
breast might catch the spark as does dry
tinder when the steel strikes the flint.

IX.

With me do I carry the enemy, whether
I leave my threshold, or return back to
my home.

With me do I bring the traitor, and he
is my heart's shadow,—the thunderbolt
striking me.

With its storm it will scatter the
roof of my dwelling, set fire to my
house.

And then suddenly stopping, the sails
of my boat will be folded, and down will
it sink.

(
To be continued.

GODS, HEROES AND MEN.

BY AMOS J. JOHNSON.

According

to Theosophy every
man is a God incarnate. In his
real nature, each man is a spark
from the Divine Flame, which descends
from the Infinite Fountain of Life and
courses through Eternity on a pilgrimage,
the purpose of which we can but
faintly conceive.

Great mystics have said that "the
universe exists for the sake of the soul's
experience," and that the purpose of life
is that the soul may reach perfection.
The term embraces infinity, perfect virtue,
wisdom, power, perfect altruism.
Each department of Nature must be carried
on to a full completeness and the
soul may not rest content with achieving
merely its own perfection, but must
labor for the perfection of the great
Whole.

Reaching from the One White Light
of Absolute Being down to the tiniest
atom of matter, each plane of existence
is governed by Divine Intelligences. All
one can say is that after reaching to the
highest conception possible to us of the
Divine Intelligences that rise above us
and to the highest knowledge attainable
of the Divine Worlds, still stretching
far beyond the highest, beyond the utmost
reach of human thought, there
exists: What? "An omnipresent,
eternal, boundless and immutable Principle,
on which all speculation is impossible,
since it transcends the power
of human conception and can only be
dwarfed by any human expression or
similitude. It is beyond the reach and
power of thought, unthinkable and unspeakable."

This is the postulate of sublime and
everlasting Deity. As far as we may
go in endless Eternity, yet above and
beyond all there reigneth absolute Law.

Recognizing then, that the great unknowable
Deity is beyond our ken, our
study must be confined to the lesser
Deities, though some of these seem unknowable;
but we may partially learn
the relation they bear to men.

All the great religions present a series
of divine Presences, and generally a triune
Godhead stands as the primal object
of all adoration. The Hebrew Bible traces

{552}

three Deities, the highest of these being
the Most High God, supreme ruler over
all, and synonymous with Law; the
second Deity is God, the Elohim, a
great hierarchy, or rather a series of
hierarchies of Gods, who formed the
earth and filled it with living creatures
and endowed man with his human nature;
while the third in rank among
the ancient Hebrews was Jehovah, who
stands as their tribal Deity. The distinction
between the Most High God
and Jehovah is clearly shown in Deuteronomy
(32: 8-9), where it says: "When
the Most High divided the nations, their
inheritance, when He separated the Sons
of Adam, He set the bounds of the
people.... The Lord's [Jehovah's]
portion is his people, Jacob is
the lot of His inheritance."

The New Testament also gives a triple
Godhead in the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit. Among the Brahmins, Brahma
is the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and
Siva the Destroyer; with the Greeks it
was Uranos, Kronos and Zeus; and with
the Egyptians, Osiris, Isis and Horus.
These were not necessarily the most
powerful Gods in the Pantheon, but
those most popularly known. The Hindus,
for instance, are said to call their
chief Deity, Zyaus—which bears a close
resemblance to the Greek Zeus; and the
Egyptians called their Unknown God,
Amen or Ammon. All religions tell also
of lesser divinities, as archangels and
angels.

Theosophy, the Wisdom Religion,
shows the three Logoi which have proceeded
from the Unknowable Principle;
these Logoi are respectively the First
Cause, the Spirit of the Universe, and
the Universal World-Soul. From the
Manifested Logos, the Universal Oversoul,
spring hundreds of classes of
divine beings, and these in their turn are
the progenitors of the lower classes of
beings. From God down to the lowest
mineral monad, there is a direct chain of
heredity, binding all of existence into one
great universal whole. Humanity is the
child of the Gods and traces its heredity
through all the divine hierarchies to the
Unknowable Root of all.

The traditions of all old nations tell of
a Golden Age when Gods and Demigods
lived among men. Greek mythology
gives the following account of the formation
of the Earth and heavens: "Before
earth and sea and heaven were
created, all things wore one aspect, to
which we give the name Chaos—a confused
and shapeless mass, in which,
however, slumbered the seeds of things.
Earth, sea and air were all mixed up together;
so the earth was not solid, the
sea was not fluid, and the air was not
transparent. God and Nature at last interposed
and put an end to this discord,
separating earth from sea, and heaven
from both. Then one of the Gods gave
His services in arranging the Earth. The
air being cleared, the stars began to appear,
fishes took possession of the sea,
birds of the air and beasts of the land.
But a nobler race was wanted, and Prometheus
and his brother Epimetheus
made man in the image of the Gods.
Then Prometheus went to heaven and lit
his torch at the chariot of the Sun, and
brought down fire to man. He taught
him to make weapons to subdue the
animals, tools to cultivate the ground,
and introduced arts and commerce."

The "fire" which Prometheus brought,
refers not to a physical flame, but to
"mind." Prometheus stands for the
hierarchy which endowed physical man
with his mental faculties, and it is
related that when mankind was supplied
with the "divine fire" the Gods became
jealous of the new race, and in revenge
they chained Prometheus to a rock
where a vulture feasted on his liver,
which was renewed as fast as devoured.
He thus stands forth as the first Saviour
of humanity, and his sufferings represent
the first crucifixion.

Mythology is written in glyph and
symbol, but if one stops to analyze these

{553}

mystic tales, volumes may be found
hidden beneath the outer husk. Perhaps
it was not revenge—but Law—which
caused Prometheus to be chained
to the rock. He assumed the task of
raising man to Godhood and incarnated
in the animal form that the lower entity
might be better aided. Thus the rock to
which he was chained becomes humanity
itself, and the vulture represents the
desires and passions of the lower man.

Humanity has always had divine
Teachers. Schools of Magi or Wise
Ones were established on the old Lemurian
continent, and were open to all
who were worthy. These schools or
temples were known to the public down
to a period as late as 2000 years ago,
when they closed to the world at large.
But the light has been kept burning in
hidden places even to the present day.
The Great Lodge has maintained a continuous
existence ever since its establishment
millions of years ago, and it is
from this Lodge that all the great
Teachers of the world have come—Krishna,
Buddha, Jesus, and all others.
A recent Messenger from the Lodge was
H.Â P. Blavatsky, who founded the Theosophical
Society and Universal Brotherhood.
Through this channel the archaic
teachings are again being presented to
the world at large. All who desire to
learn the mysteries of life, all who desire
to advance along the Path which leads
from manhood to Godhood are welcome
to the archaic wisdom.

If the applicant for divine knowledge
will purify his nature and be brotherly
to his neighbor, then he may gain the
greatest profit by a study of Theosophy,
for then its teachings will be illuminated
by a greater light than intellect itself
can ever shed. The true men of to-day
are those who are able to subdue their
lower nature and make it obedient to the
behests of the spiritual man. It is a
heavy task, but in the end will lead to a
higher life.

The course of training at first is very
simple, being concerned with the commonest
of daily duties. If one is irritable,
quick-tempered, censorious, lazy,
selfish or unjust, his first steps upon the
Path will consist in correcting these
faults. One must make a persistent
struggle to become industrious, self-controlled
and sweet tempered, and not until
these qualities are developed need one be
anxious for anything beyond. If one
fails in some respects or in all respects
he need not be discouraged, but should
try again, and keep on trying until he
does succeed.

The evolution from man to Hero or
Seer, and from Seer to Perfection can
not take place in a single life, for one
life is not sufficient to furnish either
time or environment for the many lines
of development that are required. Before
the man can become one of the company
of the great Helpers of Humanity,
he must be purged of every weakness
and defilement. He does not need
Their learning, but he must have Their
purity.

fool."—

THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUICIDE.

BY T. B. WILSON.

There

is a very much deeper meaning
than some people suppose, to
what Paul said to the Romans,
"None liveth to himself, and no man
dieth to himself." In inflicting a wound
upon himself, the suicide wounds all
there is, and his death shocks every living
thing. That is so because of the
oneness, the solidarity, the interdependence
of all that is. Hence it is that
the atom is as necessary to the universe
as a world. It is a very old philosophy,
but it is a demonstrable cosmological
and psychological fact, for we know that
man necessarily lives and moves and has
his being under the same law of growth
and maintenance that supports and sustains
every other entity, even from the
atom subdivided into a million parts
away to the mightiest god. It is just as
incumbent upon the bowlder that it fulfill
its destiny as it is that man should
fulfill his. Hence, it is a violation of
the law of being to purposely or unnecessarily
retard the unfoldment of one's
self or any other thing. The wrong
done to the thing hindered reflects back
upon the doer in force, in addition to the
injury done to that which was wronged.

The divinity which shapes the course
of a man's journey through the worlds
of existence is his own thoughts and
acts, and, furthermore, every thought
and act exerts an influence for good or
for evil everywhere. It is true, altogether
true, that every man is more or
less his brother's keeper, and that no one
can escape the consequences of his acts
and thoughts upon his own life, nor of
the influence they exert upon the lives
of others. The interdependence of all
things and the universality of being is
seen in all things. This is a principle
of existence which to know the full
meaning of, one must know one's self.

Existence as a personality and individuality,
with power to reason and understand,
is at once the most sublime
and most fearful stage of unfoldment.
It is sublime when considered as evidence
of individual possibilities, and
fearful when, in the presence of God in
manifestation, the responsibility which
the realization of the universality of
being and the interdependence of all
things imposed upon the individual is
felt. The law of being makes a relationship
to exist between individuals as
a whole which transcends the ties of consanguinity.
You may call it universal
brotherhood, if you like, but any way,
the relationship imposes tasks of toil
and burdens of duty upon everyone, and
to wilfully make the burden of duty or
the task of toil harder for one's self or for
another is to defy the power of the universe
and invite the wrath of the source
and maintainer of being.

But somehow or some way the average
man and woman finds in the so-called
philosophy of suicide a most bewitching
theme for conversation and discussion,
and it is just possible that not a few are
persuaded to try the realities of it by letting
their minds dwell upon the subject
too much. That there is a certain fascination
in the problem of life and death,
no one will deny, but the thoughtful
person would not seek its solution in
self-destruction. The better a man understands
the law of his being the clearer
he sees that in ratio to his obedience to
the laws of nature is he in harmonious
relation with all things, and that when
in such harmony, existence in the body
is altogether desirable, whether he be

{555}

sick or well, rich or poor.

But what constitutes suicide or self-murder?
We are accustomed to call that
an act of suicide which hurls one into
death at once, when death follows the
act instantly. Now, as a matter of fact,
we all are almost sure to occupy a suicide's
grave. There is a difference between
the man who burns out his stomach
in twenty seconds with prussic acid and
the man who burns out his stomach in
twenty years with whisky, but can you
tell me just what the difference is? That
thought might be carried into the conduct
of our life throughout. The natural
end of a man's pilgrimage in each incarnation
is when the spiritual man has so
spiritualized his physical body that the
spirit can no longer function in it.

Death, then, is surely the spirit walking
out of the body by its own free will,
just as we lay aside a garment when it is
worn out. All other deaths come of
violation of nature's laws, and they are
premature. It is because we indirectly,
at least, commit what is almost the
equivalent of what we are wont to call
suicide that, in my opinion, we have to
come back so often. It is impossible for
disease and death, as we understand and
feel them, to lay hold upon one who
lives in harmony with nature's laws.
So as a matter of fact, practically all
deaths are the penalty for wrong living.
We come back time and again because we
need certain other experiences, but the
purpose of experience is to teach us to
live right, and the reason why we need
new experiences is because we have not
hitherto, or are not now, living in harmony
with nature's laws. Karma makes
us go to school until we have mastered
the lesson. It is for us to say how many
lives we will devote to it, but every
moment we turn away from the lesson
we drink down poison which kills.

To seek death by one's own hand is
not a new method to overcome the ills
that relentlessly chase their victims
through briar patch and over flint hill.
It is a right that has been claimed by
very many in all ages, and some of the
world's most distinguished personages
committed self-murder to escape impending
trouble. The crime—for it is a
crime—has been defended by such
famous writers as Gibbon, Hume, Von
Hartman and Schopenhauer. Strangely
enough, as civilization advances and
universities multiply, the roll of self-murderers
seems to increase. It can not be
said, therefore, that the spread of culture
and knowledge, of discoveries in the
field of science, and the adoption of
higher codes of commercial and social
ethics, educate or influence the world
away from the old-time philosophy that a
man's highest right is to quit living by
his own hand when he is tired of life.
Indeed, it would seem that the wider
the range of personal liberty, and the
more extended the opportunities for intellectual
expansion and experiment, the
incentive to self-destruction is intensified.

At a recent meeting of the American
Medico-Legal congress it was held by
not a few members that not only was
suicide justifiable in cases where there
appeared to be no other way for one to
relieve one's misery, but that a physician
would be justifiable in ending the life of
his patient under certain circumstances.
I think we all will agree that such a
sentiment is unworthy of a manly man.

When a man assumes to be a law unto
himself he is certain to come in contact
with forces which will sweep him out of
the current of the river of individual
progress into whirls and eddies, which
agitate the waters fearfully but do not
move onward. He will realize, too, that
God, the universe and himself are one
stupendous whole—absolutely inseparable—and
that when he quits any sphere
of existence by his own act in violation
of the law of his being he is still a
necessary part of the whole, and that in
severing the cord of earthly life he not
only fails of his purpose, but he himself

{556}

will feel the jar more severely than any
other entity in all the worlds of God,
and not only so, but he shall continue to
live amid distracting discord until he
voluntarily readjusts himself to that
system of law and harmony from which
he essayed unlawfully to break away.
Certainly he will find pain and sorrow
in returning, but not to return is to be
without rest eternally. Nevertheless,
all men appoint their time to die by
their conduct of life, which in nearly all
cases is a form of suicide.

There are those who advocate suicide
as a proper means of escape from tiresome
environment who deny that any
unpleasant consequences could follow,
because there is no consciousness after
death, but it is incumbent upon them to
prove that there is such a state as
"death" in the sense they speak of it.
It would seem that if there is no consciousness
in what is called the state of
the dead—if the memory of man is annihilated
by what is called death—it
should be annihilated by sleep or trance,
for they are states in which the body is
dead for the time. Of course, the advocate
of suicide fortifies his position by
denying that there is memory where
there is no brain life and action, and that
when the brain ceases to be active,
memory perishes, but that theory is untenable,
because the brain is entirely
renewed every seven years or such a
matter. A man remembers incidents in
his childhood, although meanwhile his
brain has changed completely a dozen
times. It must be, therefore, that there
is something in man which is impervious
to the influences which time exerts over
the physical body. The "tablets of the
memory" continue throughout. There
is a natural body and there is a spiritual
body.

The advocate of suicide as the better
way to rid one's self of trials and tribulations
is necessarily a materialist. He
preaches the doctrine of immortality of
matter and the mortality of spirit, which
is a ridiculous absurdity. But he will
discourse learnedly about the milliards of
bacilli—separate, distinct, individual,
living entities—which float about, live,
move and have their being nearly everywhere,
but if he were asked to catch a
few that they might be seen and handled
he would promptly say they were altogether
invisible to the naked eye, that
they are almost sub-microscopic. He
would admit that these invisible creatures
have existence under the same law
that peoples the forest with trees, the
earth with animals, and the channels of
commerce with men, but he would not
admit that any living thing could have
life separate from its visible organism;
hence, when the physical organism becomes
ill, or is subjected to any other
uncomfortable conditions of existence,
it is its right to escape by quitting life.

But materialists are too few and far between
to bother with; besides, there never
was a materialist who did not hope that
his philosophy was in error, and that he
should continue to live as an individual,
retaining memory and affections after
what he calls death. Having that hope
he is deprived of the right to advocate
suicide, because if he is to live after the
death of the body he must admit that he
will be a substantial, thinking being, for
it is impossible to think of substance
without form, and of either without ascribing
power to it.

But there is a phase of the philosophy
of suicide which can be seen only from
the occult or metaphysical side of life.
It has been said that it is the cowardly
and unmanly man who wilfully destroys
his own life, but for all that a great deal
of mental strength and bravery may be
required to become too great a coward to
combat even little annoyances. And
again, the psychological influences which
gradually prepare a man during the long
days of a protracted illness to calmly,
gladly no doubt, welcome death as a
friend come in the hour of need, may
come with such force upon the man contemplating

{557}

self-slaughter that he is as
much nerved to meet death as he whose
mental acquiescence came after weeks
or months of bodily pain and wasting
away. The stoics knew of this occult
force which nerves a man to destroy his
life, and they called it a "sympathetic
friend," but science has never been able
to analyze or define it, and hence we can
know nothing of it except what we
gather from the lesson its effects upon
the soul of man teaches. It is not true,
though, that the suicide leaps from darkness
of despair here into the bright light
of peace and joy "over there."

The occult force which nerves a man to
murder himself, the would-be suicides
should bear in mind, is not spent when
the man dies. It is a force which is also
an immutable law, albeit the influence of
its operation is confined to the spiritual
man. If it nerves a man to deal with
himself harshly it is because the free
will of the man cannot be disputed.
Were it to paralyze his mind and cripple
his purpose the man would be little more
than a human machine subject to the
whims or caprice of a force or power
higher than he. It is the recognition of
his free agency by the eternal cause that
makes a man a free moral agent, but the
same force that sustains him in the exercise
of his rights as a free agent follows
him beyond the grave and all through
the process of unfoldment if he elects to
progress, or through the process of retrogression
if he inclines to travel to the
left.

In quitting this sphere or plane of existence
the suicide by no means escapes
duty. The environment from which he
fled must be met and overcome, and in
trying to escape he only strengthens the
opposing forces and weakens his own
powers of resistance. Nevertheless, the
battle must be fought and the victory
must be won if he would be free from
the hurtful influences which prompted
him to avoid learning the lesson of life,
and whatever the environment is, it is to
be overcome for the good to him there is
in the victory. This is the law of compensation,
and it is the law of all laws,
for it commands that whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap.

The suicide, therefore, not only fails
to escape the ills he flees from—but he
intensifies the distress which burdens
him. Moreover, no occult or spiritual
force ever influenced him to burden himself
with the consequences of hateful
environment, but it aided in the exercise
of his free will. And, again, whatever
a man's burden may be it is the harvest
of his own sowing. If it be of love and
sweet memories it is his by natural right,
so also it is his by natural right if it be
greed and cowardice. The suicide runs
from the presence of trouble to the arms
of many troubles, and the occult force
that aids him in the exercise of his free
will holds him to account for committing
self-murder with the same firm hand of
justice that it would had he murdered
his neighbor instead of himself. There
is no escape from the consequences of
one's acts. The grave is no hiding
place. It is the door rather which opens
into a court of justice beyond—into a
place where the ethical debits and credits
of the individual await him that a balance
may be struck. Those things
which he planted in the field of life will
be there as debits and credits. Nothing
will be omitted, be they the fruit of
omission or of commission, and that
which he owes he must come again
into the field of the activities of physical
environment and pay to the uttermost
farthing. This, too, the law of
Karma demands, and this it exacts.

THE ETHICS OF SEX.

BY GRACE G. BOHN.

"Simple? Why this is the old woe o' the world:

Tune to whose rise and fall we live and die.

Rise with it then! Rejoice that man is hurled

From change to change unceasingly,

His soul's wings never furled."

—
Robert Browning.

The

destiny of each soul is reunion
with the Absolute from which it
emanated. But this reunion may
be accomplished only through yielding
the claims of the personal self to the
greater Self, the Christos which exists
within each personality. A single word
gives us the key to the process,—brotherhood.

To this goal there is one royal road
and many that are long and terrible.
But the royal road may be travelled only
by those who are immune from temptation
because their consciousness is not
centred in the self which may be
tempted. Understanding the law, they
obey it, for only by obedience may the
law be transcended and the soul become
free. That is a royal road, indeed. But
it is only for the few.

The other, cyclic and steep as the pathway
that winds to the summit of the Purgatorio
mountain, must for ages be travelled
by the multitudes; for it is they
who cannot as yet answer the questions,
"Whence came I? wherefore do I exist,
and whither do I go?"

Spirit, when first differentiated from
the Absolute, is simple, not complex,
undifferentiated, pure and good because
it has not become conscious of evil. To
gain the experiences by which alone it
may expand its consciousness to infinity
and become inclusive of all differentiation,
it becomes individualized and embodied.
And this earth is the scene of
the experiences which the spirit needs
and which it can gain only by means of
an embodiment of personality.

Cycle after cycle, life after life, the
soul tests all the conditions of earthly
pleasure and pain by its own standard
and measure. If that standard be self,
alienation will be swift and certain, and
slow and terrible will be the return to
the divine. If the measure be brotherhood,
service, ministry to others, the
soul remains one with God and spiritual
consciousness is by so much expanded.

Since brotherhood is the ideal, our
very institutions, church, state, and particularly
the home, exist for no higher
purpose than to develop within the soul
of humanity a conscious desire to live
for others. It is only because the soul
manifests itself as two forces, in two
sexes, man and woman, that the institution
of the home, as we know it, is made
possible. We fancy that these dual
forces, incomplete and fluctuating, become
completed and stable only through
marriage. The novelists have threshed
over this old straw for many weary years,
for the view commonly taken is superficial
and untrue.

Marriage, in its deeper aspect, is a
means by which the soul prepares itself,
through the joys of limited service, for
that wider ministry which includes the
world. Emerson expresses it better
when he says "the lover ascends to the
highest beauty, to the love and knowledge
of Divinity, by steps on this ladder
of created souls." Marriage opens the
shortest way by which men and women,
self-centred and egotistical, may be compelled,
against their will if need be, to
become conscious of the joy of sacrifice
and the beauty of service.

The child, like the childish race, is, in
some respects, very much of a savage.

{559}

He has neither intellectual nor ethical
ideas and, as Froebel expresses it, "the
first circle of a child's life is physical nature
bound by necessity." The baby
cares only to be kept physically comfortable,
and he proposes to be kept so at
the expense of others as far as possible.
He is a little egotist. The world is his
oyster. Selfishness, if he be not guided,
is far more native to him during the
earliest period of his life, than altruism.
And it is significant that a large proportion
of children grow into manhood and
womanhood, particularly in these days
of ferment and individualism, with the
firm belief that, first of all, they must
look out for themselves. They do not
voluntarily accept the path of brotherhood,
but the law, the wise law, forces
them, by few or many hard experiences,
to finally see the wisdom of choosing it.
By refusing to obey the law they place
themselves within the sweep of its
mighty arm and are struck down.

We are all one; we minister to ourselves
only as we minister to others.
We must first sacrifice self, else all the
rest will not be added unto us and even
that which we have will be taken away.
But before we are capable of the wider
ministry, we must prove ourselves by
the narrower service, and nature, with
her wise economy, leads us into a field
wherein service and sacrifice are inevitable,
and its gateway is marriage.

Emerson gives us the key to this mystery
when he says: "The man is only
half himself; his other half is his expression."
The true expression is service,
the ideal which leads us to accept it
is brotherhood, and to that expression
the other sex is only the embodied opportunity.
To that expression marriage
is the guardian and the gateway only as
husband and wife accept all its culture
and all its sacrifices, patiently, joyfully,
completely. That signifies, ordinarily,
that both husband and wife must lose
their personal selves in their children,
and if, for selfish reasons, they refuse
this service, they are missing the culture
of this incarnation. If they refuse it for
reasons that are unselfish, for the opportunities
of a wider ministry, that is, as
Kipling would say, "another story."
That is the supreme sacrifice.

It is, in most cases, wiser for husband
and wife to fill their home with little
children for two reasons. In the first
place, through the care of children (the
care of their minds and souls not less
than of their bodies), each forgets self
and learns the A B C of that great lesson
in ministry which alone will make universal
brotherhood possible upon the
face of the earth. Because these sacrifices
are more inevitable to the mother
than to the father, she is likely to learn
this lesson more speedily, and perhaps
that is one reason why the Ego clothes
itself now in one sex and now in another
in the course of its earthly experiences.
Perhaps it is that we may learn this lesson
of sacrifice well that the newly embodied
soul inflicts upon the builders of
its physical body such agonies, sacrifices,
and anxieties, that their souls seem to
be torn up by the very roots, only to be
planted, when quiet comes again, upon
a higher plateau and in an atmosphere
less dense. Emerson has said truly,
"Infancy conforms to nobody; all conform
to it."

Under existing conditions the lesson
of selflessness will have to be learned by
most of us through this very differentiation
of sex, and we may make as much
ado about it as we please. We may
learn it through the agony and the terror
of a Hetty Sorrel or a Margaret, both
of whom were examples of extreme selfishness;
we may accept it gracefully, as
do the average man and woman, with a
very faint comprehension of what it all
means; or we may welcome and glorify
parenthood as the Madonna glorified it,
prophesy of that future time when every
child shall be the child of an immaculate
conception. "Help nature and work on
with her, and nature shall regard thee as

{560}

one of her creators and make obeisance."
[2]

The second reason why the selfish person
is delaying his own advancement by
refusing to fulfill the duties that he tacitly
accepts by marriage is very prosaic.
We all like to assure ourselves that we
are rays of the Infinite, channels through
which alone the God-message may be
brought to mankind. That is very inspiring.
But it is not so inspiring to
reflect that we are also the gateways,
self-appointed by the very estate of marriage,
through which other souls, more
advanced than ourselves perhaps, may
come into the physical embodiment
which they need for future experience.
That is quite another thing, and all the
old self which binds our souls rebels.
For this means, to a great degree, the
sacrifice of our social pleasures, our recreations,
time, money, physical ease,
perhaps health; it means broken rest,
disorderly rooms, the washing of bedaubed
little hands, and the kissing
of, oh, such dirty little mouths. It means
that we have to shut our Ãschylus and
shelve our Faust and our Homer for a
few years at least, and many a father and
mother look back with something like
longing upon the old days when they
lived with these great souls and when
their cherished books were not smeared
as to bindings and torn as to leaves.

Was it an accident that Froebel called
the system of education that he gave to
the world "the science of motherhood"?
Was it accidental that he should dedicate
the deepest and truest philosophy of
which I have any conception to the end
that the father and the mother, and
through them, the child, might become
able to look beneath the visible for the
invisible which conditions it; beneath
the outer phenomena to the spirit which
gives it birth; beyond the transitory
to the permanent. Such a philosophy
makes one very patient with physical
duties and sacrifices when they are regarded
as only a means to an end that is
higher than physical. Such a philosophy
makes it somewhat easier to "step
out from sunlight into shade to make
more room for others."

That is, to me, the ethical side of the
now-existing relationship of the sexes
about which the reformers are making so
much ado. It is these who lament with
such vigor the large families of the very
poor. Looked at from the standpoint
of the eternal, the growing number of
childless families among the better
classes is a much more serious state of
affairs. Large and half-cared for families
of children prove nothing more than ignorance
on the part of the parents, of
both spiritual and physical laws. And
the suffering that this ignorance entails
will inevitably lead the soul to a higher
consciousness. But the other state of
affairs is—with exceptions—the result
of selfishness; and the more conscious
the soul, the greater the alienation resulting
from a selfish course of action.
Says H.Â P.Â B., "The selfish devotee lives
to no purpose. The man who does not
go through his appointed work in life
has lived in vain."

It is very noble to slay the appetites
but that may occasionally be only a more
subtle phase of selfishness. Besides
that, desires that are slain for selfish
comfort's sake do not free us from the
law. That is why it is such nonsense to
seek the solution of this old problem by
placing the caprice or whim of the individual
man or woman above the law of
the universe. As long as men and
women are selfish, as long as marriages
are made from selfish motives, I bow before
the rampant desires that shall force
the soul into sacrifices until the self has
disappeared. But when the law is
obeyed, and when old Karmic debts are
paid, woman and man will rise superior
to it, the will of the individual become
one with the universal will, and the
spirit have gained her freedom.

Please do not mistake me. I do not

{561}

believe that marriage is the only circumstance
through which the sexes can become
self-poised, completed and stable.
I do not believe that those who marry
should always accept the limited service
that little children demand of them. I
do not believe that the sacrifices of
fatherhood and motherhood are the highest
sacrifices. Nothing of the kind.
Marriage is simply a means by which
the less advanced souls, the feeble, the
selfish, may rise out of feebleness into
strength, out of self into God. Susan
E. Blow, in her "Study of Dante," has
defined the Inferno as the soul filled with
self, the Purgatorio as the soul emptied
of self, and the Paradiso as the soul filled
with God. Dante himself, with his divine
insight into the nature of sin,
places the jealous souls (become so
through selfishness extreme) in icebound
Cocytus, at the very pit of the Inferno.
To most of us marriage is indeed
the gateway leading out of an Inferno of
selfishness, and it is marriage that
places upon our backs the precious burdens
which we must carry up the Purgatorio
mountain. "The more we climb
the less it hurts until we seem to fly."
[3]

But climb we must until the burdens
have all fallen and the self has disappeared.
By the light of "the dim star
that burns within" the cyclic path must
be ascended. But when the top has
been reached "its light will suddenly
become the infinite light." We shall
have entered the Paradiso.

Advanced souls, those who are capable
of wider and better service, need not to
complete themselves in marriage nor to
find their expression in the opportunities
it gives them. They are strong
enough to find it voluntarily in a cause.
They do not marry on the physical plane,
but truly wedded are they on the spiritual
plane and in that marriage to the
needs of the world they find the other
half, their expression. They cease their
hovering between opposites and are
stable.

Such souls were Michael Angelo and
Raphael, who found complete expression
in art. Socrates needed no wife. He
found his expression in loafing on the
street-corners and plying his mystic
questions. Xantippe was clearly a superfluity
and we do not blame her for
scolding him when we remember that
she had none of his philosophic insight
to carry her over the desert of his neglect.
Dorothea Dix, Florence Nightingale
and hundreds of other souls have
found their appropriate expression in
ministry to physical suffering. H.Â P.Â B.,
great loving heart, forgot self in a sublime
service of the mind and of the spirit.
Such souls do not drift nor waver; they
need none of the experiences of physical
fatherhood or motherhood; they are
wedded to the needs of the world, they
become spiritual fathers and mothers to
its children, they find their expression
in brotherhood, they are self-poised,
completed, and at rest.

THE SOKRATIC CLUB.

BY SOLON.

(
Continued.
)

At

our next gathering an address was
given by Mr. Knowlton on Art
as an Educational Factor, with
special reference to the Drama. After
the formal address a very interesting
conversation arose on the subject in
which the Professor, Mr. Knowlton, and
Dr. Roberts took part, and which I will
relate here as far as I am able to remember
it. The other members took the part
of listeners.

Dr. Roberts.
—"I can well understand,
Mr. Knowlton, that Art plays an important
part in life and should be cultivated,
and that no one's nature is complete who
lacks appreciation of the artistic and
beautiful, but even granting this, I do
not agree with you that the training of
the artistic faculties should be given so
much prominence, but should be secondary
to that training which fits a man
for work in the world. To put it in another
way; for the man of the world,
art is all very well for his leisure hours
and for his relaxation and enjoyment
but can have no place in his active everyday
life."

Mr. Knowlton.
—"I take an entirely
opposite view, Doctor, as you know
from what I have said, and I maintain
that it is just because we have put Art
in a secondary place that our civilization
is characterized by so much unrest
and skepticism; the finer, inner side of
man's nature has been subordinated to
the grosser and external. What is the
criterion of success in the world to-day?
That should be sufficient argument in
support of my claim. And the man who
has achieved success, acquired wealth,
position, fame, has not thereby attained
to happiness but in nearly every case is
still the victim of the unrest of the age.
He may use his wealth in the patronage
of art, in collections of paintings and
sculpture, in support of Grand Opera and
what not, but tell me, do you honestly
think that he truly appreciates these?"

Dr. Roberts.
—"No, I think not. Indeed,
in nine cases out of ten, he affects
a patronage of art, has his private picture
gallery and a box at the opera because
it is the fashion. No doubt by doing
so he is useful in a way to the Art
world, but I must confess that if I
wanted a true appreciation of a work
of Art, I would not go to such a one."

Mr. Knowlton.
—"No, the enthusiasm
and the true love of art which is the great
incentive in making all life beautiful
and harmonious would be lacking. Well,
what is the reason of this? I should
say it is because Art was made entirely
subordinate if not almost neglected in
his education, and because it has held
a subordinate place throughout his
life."

The Professor.
—"I do not think we
can rightly say what position Art should
occupy in education and life unless we
can first determine what is truly man's
work in the world and what is the object
of life."

Dr. Roberts.
—"That is just the position
I take. Life is a serious matter and
a man cannot afford to spend his time
and energy on what after all is more a
matter of the imagination than anything
else. Although I certainly think the
Ã¦sthetic faculties should not be neglected
but that they should receive a
certain amount of training; yet, at the
same time, except in the case of those
who follow art as a profession, they play
very little part in a man's life work. In
fact, I have known of more than one

{563}

case where Ã¦sthetic sensitiveness has
positively unfitted men for the keen
competition of life. After all, the beautiful
must give place to the useful, and,
for my part, I say, give me the cold facts
of science and I will make life successful,
whereas the man whose artistic faculties
have been trained as Mr. Knowlton says
they should be, would have his life made
miserable by the discords and inharmonies
that he must inevitably meet.
But put science and the appreciation of
facts as a basis, then a little Ã¦sthetic
training is all very well as an embellishment."

The Professor.
—"Doctor, I fear you
have completely backslided to your old
materialistic position which you formerly
used to hold."

Dr. Roberts.
—"If I have I certainly
think I have reason and fact on my side
this time. Let us get to the bottom of
this question. Mr. Knowlton proposes
to make education of the Ã¦sthetic and
artistic faculties of the first importance,
but what would be the effect among the
masses of the people? I fully agree
with providing high class entertainments
for the masses—picture-galleries, good
music, etc. But to give an education
such as suggested would but make them
more discontented with their lot and increase
their unhappiness. What they
need is plain scientific teaching and
trade schools where they can be trained
to become more useful members of society
and more competent to earn a livelihood,
but not music or art save as a recreation
and which I think ought to be provided
for them in the shape of public concerts
and art galleries by the cities. With
the exception of a little singing and
drawing when at school to enable them
to appreciate this recreation when they
grow up, it would be waste of time for
them to develop an appreciation of the
artistic. Their lot is too hard and all
their energies are needed for the stern
realities of life."

The Professor.
—"That is all very well,
and very well put from your standpoint
in regard to man's work in the world,
but possibly there is another standpoint
from which the matter may be viewed."

Mr. Knowlton.
—"And perhaps the
very discontent which you fear, Doctor,
would be just what is needed to lift the
masses from their present almost hopeless
condition. The discontent from
which they suffer now will never cease
through mere material means or scientific
education, or the making and enforcing
of new laws."

The Professor.
—"They don't know
the cause of their discontent. They
think that if they could have money and
material comforts they would be happy,
but we know very well that these things
do not bring happiness. It is the insanity
of the age, this pursuit of the
phantom of material prosperity, it is
this that breeds all the selfishness, all
the greed and lust of possession. By
regarding physical life as all important,
humanity has got off the track, has lost
the way that leads to happiness. Material
happiness, physical existence, as an
end, is a veritable bottomless pit—the
more it is sacrificed to, the more insatiable
it becomes, the more it demands.
The physical life and physical needs
must not be neglected, but so long as
these are regarded as an end and their
gratification as the
summum bonum
, just
so long will ever new needs arise, new
forms of poverty, new distress."

Dr. Roberts.
—"Professor, you startle
me! I hardly know what to say. I
cannot conceive how social reform can
take place on any other lines than the
material."

The Professor.
—"It certainly requires
courage, it requires first of all philosophy
as a basis, to deliberately turn
around and put physical existence and
material comfort in a secondary place
while aiming to develop man's inner
faculties. Yet I maintain that this is
the only way to bring hope and happiness
to humanity. It will, as you say,

{564}

make them discontented with their lot,
but this will be but temporary. It will
open for them a door to a higher life
which alone through its reaction on the
collective mind of humanity will make
possible and bring about that active
brotherliness which will ultimately remove
poverty and distress wherever
found."

Mr. Knowlton.
—"Isn't it a law of
Nature that the problems of one plane
can ultimately only be solved by rising to
the next higher plane? And it seems to
me that this is one of Nature's methods
in evolution, to create discontent with
the lower by awakening that which is
higher, thus creating a craving for the
higher and a consequent output of
energy to attain it."

The Professor.
—"And, it should be
added, ultimately making the lower of
greater service and a more useful instrument."

Dr. Roberts.
—"Granting all this for
the sake of argument, how will you
proceed to bring it about, for as I have
said, this artistic appreciation is more a
matter of the imagination than anything
else and applies to a realm of which
there is, so far as I know, no scientific
knowledge and concerning which, consequently,
there will be as many opinions
and methods of procedure as there are
teachers? Look for instance, at the
many methods of voice training and all
the schools of Art. Where is there any
recognized starting point?"

The Professor.
—"These are all very
pertinent questions, Doctor. But before
discussing them let me refer to your remark
about imagination. Isn't it worth
while to cultivate the imagination?
Where would have been all the great discoveries
in Science had not our scientific
men used their imaginations? The pity
is that there has been no training of this
faculty, it is almost a
terra incognita
.
But to come to your questions proper.
How shall we proceed to awaken and
train the love of the beautiful that it
may work this miracle of regenerating
the human race, for such I believe it will
accomplish."

Dr. Roberts.
—"One moment, Professor,
let me interrupt you here. A little
time ago we spoke of the lack of true
appreciation of art among many of the
so-called patrons of art, but surely that
must to some extent be passing away,
for nearly all the wealthy and even those
of moderate means provide that their
children shall have some education in
art or music. Even in the public schools
an important feature is made of drawing
and class singing. Surely all this ought
to bring about what you desire if your
theory is correct, but for my part I cannot
see that it will cause any appreciable
change, or in any great degree affect the
condition of the masses. I simply
wanted to say this before you go further,
in order that we might not overlook
what is already being done and because
I think this supports my position that
art and music are all very well for recreation
and pleasure but that the main
thing to help the people is along what I
call practical, material and scientific
lines. Only in this way can they be
fitted for their work in the world."

Mr. Knowlton.
—"You have stated your
position very clearly, Doctor, and I now
see there were many points I did not
cover in my address though some of
your objections I certainly did anticipate.
However, in the first place it
comes down to this. What answer is to
be given to the question which the Professor
asked and which you have again
raised? What is a man's work in the
world? What is man? What is his
nature? In what does education consist?
We have often discussed these
questions, Doctor, so now we needn't go
into them at any length, for you know
very well my position in regard to them,
but they come up in a slightly different
aspect in relation to the subject in hand.
Let us for the moment, then, grant the
existence of the inner man, the real

{565}

man, the man of high imaginations, high
feelings, with keen appreciation of harmony
and beauty, that
something
within
us which prompts to a deed of self-sacrifice,
which feels the joy of helping another
and relieving distress. The outer
man lives on material food, but for
health needs also pure air and sunshine—all
these are necessary to animal existence.
But the inner man needs something
more. There are other states of
feeling besides that of physical well-being.
There are other powers besides the
physical or even the mental. It is no
mere effect of the imagination that beautiful
music or harmony of form and color
awaken in response certain harmonies in
the soul and it is just in this way that
true art may be made a vital educative
factor."

The Professor.
—"A man's true work
in the world is the soul's work, and true
education is that which enables the soul
to fulfil its destiny and make manifest
its own nature. True education is therefore
that which will draw out the soul's
own powers. If this were done the rest
of our life would all fall into its proper
place."

Dr. Roberts.
—"But as I have said,
even granting that, it is all vague.
Where and how will you begin? Have
you any science of the soul's powers and
how to awaken them? What more
would you have than is already being
done in the way of art education?"

The Professor.
—"It is just because
there is a science of the soul's powers
that more should be done, and lovers of
art have sought and striven for this for
centuries. But the time had not come.
It has come now and this renaissance of
the soul's powers is already heralded by
the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity."

Dr. Roberts.
—"What! do we have to
go to the ancients for this? I acknowledge
all the culture and art of the Greeks,
but I am not one of those who puts Greek
civilization above ours."

The Professor.
—"It is not a question
of giving the palm to either ancient or
modern civilization. Our civilization
marks one stage of development but in
it we have lost something that the ancients
had. There is something lacking
from our lives. We have developed our
physical senses and physical and mental
powers to a marvellous degree but there
are not that harmony and serenity in our
lives which alone can give true happiness.
The key to these was in the Mysteries
whereby man was brought face to
face with the essences of things and his
own inner nature."

Dr. Roberts.
—"How can these Mysteries
be revived—so little is known of
them and you yourself speak of them as
lost."

The Professor.
—"Lost only to the
world at large, but they have never been
wholly lost. There have always been
some in the world to whom has been entrusted
the sacred wisdom and through
whom it has been handed down from age
to age."

Here some of the members began to
make a move towards departure and as
it was quite late it was decided to resume
the discussion at the next meeting when
it was expected Madam Purple would be
present.

acts coÃ¶perate."—

FRAGMENT—OMNISCIENCE.

BY ADHIRATHA.

In

the "Key to Theosophy" of H.Â P.Â B. there are some allusions to the
omniscience of the real man within
everybody. Not grasping the meaning,
I once had a conversation with Madame
Blavatsky on the subject, and I must
confess that at the time I was not any
wiser for it. I thought what a good
thing it would be if instead of passing
hours and hours on the solution of a
problem, one might simply ask the real
man, who knowing all, would tell you at
once all about it. I must confess that I
had some doubt about the real man
knowing all, and I asked Madame Blavatsky
to explain. I am sure that she
tried to awake my understanding, but
at that time it was all a beginning, and
young Theosophists felt then (as they do
sometimes even now) proud, when they
knew the Sanskrit names of the seven
principles and a few more strange sounding
words.

I thought: Omniscience is knowing
all, which of course must comprise
everything and every problem, and the
hardest mathematical nut will be child's
play for the real man to crack—
if
H.Â P.Â B. is right!

Now if we but change intonation and
instead of knowing
all
, say
knowing
all,
we shall get a little step nearer the
standpoint from which the question
looks more attackable. The question
turns first about that much abused word
"knowledge." We generally think it
to mean the conviction or even certainty,
that under given conditions of things
some unavoidable result took place, and
will take place anew when those conditions
will re-occur. A doctor knows that
for a certain illness, the name of which
implies a certain condition of the human
body, a certain remedy will reÃ«stablish
other conditions called health. An
engineer knows by experiment and calculation,
that a certain form of structure
under given loads will have to resist
such and such forces in its divers parts,
and then he lodges his material in such
a way, that no part gets too much and
no material gets too little anywhere,
which he can only do approximately.
But all this is not real knowledge and
neither the doctor nor the engineer
knows what that thing is he is dealing
with and how its molecules feel.

Real knowledge has nothing to do
with apparent knowledge, and it is useless
to ask the real man within to write
out the development of a mathematical
problem for you. But when it comes to
the application of such a mathematical
solution whereby one tries to get a certain
insight into nature, then it may be
said that the real man has that insight
into nature without passing by the tedious
way of a mathematical investigation.

What science tries to find out, that the
real man is already, and he knows without
a shade of doubt that which science
strives at but never reaches. That essence
which constitutes the real man,
which has passed through all the kingdoms
below man, which we find specified
in every human being as the monad,
clothed in different garbs so as to appear
distinct, that essence knows all about
everything we can think of, and that
part of the Universe which we can think
of constitutes the
omnia
for man. Having
had the experience of all the kingdoms
below us, the monad knows them,
and our all, as far as human nature is
concerned, is that of which we are able

{567}

to think; therefore it is right to say,
that the real man knows that which the
ordinary man comprises under the term
"all," and even more, because the all
for the man of the present day is less
than the all of those who served to clothe
the monad at some earlier periods. It
thus seems to me that the object of the
development of the thinking principle is
not to arrive at a better knowledge of
nature, but to arrive at some knowledge
in a certain way, which way has to be
learnt during certain periods of evolution.
Discrimination has to be learnt,
and if one will learn how to avoid a
wrong way, he must pass it first, or else it
would remain unknown to him. It seems
a strange thing that man has to incarnate
so many times during millions of
years in order to develop the thinking
principle, and after having developed it,
abandon it as a wrong way. But is it
not the same with the evolution of all
the principles in Cosmos? Has not all to
be gone through? Has not every plane of
consciousness to give way to another?
We call them higher or lower—but what
about such terms? This is no loss, it is
a momentary necessity for a certain purpose
of divine law, and although less in
one sense we gain and go forward in another,
and pass where we have to pass.
This must not be misunderstood, and we
must not say: Very well, I have to develop
intellect, and I shall do it, and
shall not care for real knowledge which
will all come in time. This is sophistry.
Through our will and endowed with the
thinking principle we have to regain
that knowledge which gradually has become
latent while Manas had to be developed,
or else we shall never regain it.
Thus we have to work with ardent aspiration
towards our highest ideals along
the lines of nature and divine law; thus
we keep balanced, and while doing every
one of our daily duties, we inwardly live
a life of spirituality and in consciousness
divine.

"Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained
treasure in their youth, perish like old herons in a lake without fish."

"Daily practical wisdom consists of four things:—To know the root of
Truth, the branches of Truth, the limit of Truth, and the opposite of Truth."

"When trust is gone, misfortune comes in; when confidence is dead, revenge
is born; and when treachery appears, all blessings fly away."

FORM OR MATTER.

BY W. E. GATES.

From

the old darky who preferred a
railway wreck to one at sea, because
in the former "you'se thar,"
to the leaders of science, the earth has
been the symbol and type of permanence
and solidity. Science has yielded one
of these characteristics to force, in positing
the conservation of energy, but it
has never felt quite sure just where to
place force in the ultimate analysis of
things. Of matter however it has always
felt sure—matter was a fact, there
has always been just so much in the universe,
and always will be just that much
and no more or less. Of this matter, to
whatever extent its mechanical subdivision
or chemical dissociation might be
carried, certain fundamental characteristics
have been ever alleged—it occupies
space and has weight. Weight is a general
term, used to denote the attractive
force between two bodies of matter, commonly
called gravitation. These two
may be regarded as primary, certain other
familiar properties being only expressions
of these under varying conditions.
We thus speak of matter as solid and impenetrable,
and say that two bodies cannot
occupy the same place at one time.
We also speak of the chemical affinities
of different atoms and of the cohesiveness
of masses of matter, both forms of
attractive force.

We also say that this matter possesses,
or more strictly is, substance—that is, it
is self-caused and self-sustaining. That
it is objectively real—indeed the most
real conception we have.

We have finally one very important
concept, that of form, whose relation to
matter is most clearly expressed by the
statement, matter displays form. Form
is a limitation of, or in, space, and may
be conceived of apart from matter, but
the latter is required for its manifestation
to the senses, by, in the little boy's
words, "drawing a line around your
thinks." We thus, since all aggregations
of matter are perpetually changing
as to their forms, do not attribute reality
to form, but for this so-called impermanence,
think of it as the least real thing
we know, the very opposite of matter,
an incident only of the latter and a very
non-entity.

It is worthy however of remark that of
these two, matter and form, both absolutely
dependent on space for their existence
(although not an attribute of
this in any way), matter cannot be
thought of without form, but form can
be thought of apart from matter, as a
mere limitation of emptiness. In other
words, the idea of form must come before
that of matter, and is pre-essential
to this. By a purely deductive process
this should lead us to question whether
essential reality does not lie rather in
the concept "form" than in the concept
"matter." And a notable confirmation
of this is given when we consider
a common error of speech. We say "all
forms change," and naturally therefore
attribute non-essentiality to form;
but we really mean to say "matter is
continually changing in form"—leaving
one form and entering into another.
This statement is a correct one, and
fully accords with the last word of physics
to-day.

Evolution has made it abundantly
clear that the most lasting, changeless,
adamantine thing in the manifested
world is form. Nature grinds the rocks
to powder and turns metals to gases in
infinitely quicker time and with less
effort than she modifies ever so little the
forms of manifestation. Form ever recurs

{569}

and matter—as we know it—again
and again obediently fills the outlines.

But as if the deductive argument for
the superiority of form over matter in
its eternal existence were not enough,
inductive science as well is day by day
dissolving so-called matter to nothingness,
or more strictly, to a mere incident
of form, produced to meet the conditions
of sense-perception. A physical universe
is daily becoming a less proven
fact. Gravitation is laid down as a universal
material law, notwithstanding
that certain facts attendant on cometary
bodies had to be thereby incidentally
slurred over, but from the Lick telescope
we now hear that late observations indicate
some other force than gravitation
as the dominating one in certain nebulÃ¦.
But a blow at the nebular hypothesis
rocks the very citadel of the physical
theory.

Scientists some time ago postulated
and have since by sheer necessity regarded
the ether of space as proven to
exist. Yet so difficult is it for us to
modify the method or form of our apprehension
of the world around us that the
majority still prefer to work on through
the paradox of a material universe,
which includes an ether lacking in the
fundamental characteristics ascribed to
matter. All known matter has weight
and obeys gravitation; the ether, by the
very theory on which it rests, does
neither. The transmission of material
phenomena requires a material vehicle,
as is not only demonstrated by every
day experience, but is necessarily involved
in a system holding that all
phenomena are but incidents of matter,
the one only reality. Nevertheless any
material vehicle, however rarified, gives
rise to some friction when bodies pass
through it, retarding them; the ether
does nothing of this. The relative distances
between the molecules in the
rarest gas are enormous; the ether of
science is said to fill all space homogeneously.
Science indeed seems to have
restored the worship of "Pater Aither,"
a god outside the material universe, yet
within every part of it and supporting it.
But they have new names for it all, and
in view of the peculiar opaqueness, materiality,
which the expressions and
forms wherein we do our so-called thinking
seem to possess before the Perceiver,
they may be forgiven for not recognizing
their teaching in Hesiod and Lucian
and the Vedas.

The most illuminating suggestion in
this whole matter we owe, among physicists,
to Lord Kelvin, in his vortex-ring
theory of matter. Taking the rings of
smoke puffed by a locomotive or a pipe,
and making allowances for the friction
of the medium in which they revolve,
Lord Kelvin found a complete identity
in behavior, at every point of comparison
he was able to institute, between
these rings and the individual atoms
into which all matter is held to be divisible.
One most significant fact so
demonstrated is that such a vortex-ring,
once brought into existence, and being
free from frictional or any other outside
interference to break up its circuit of
motion, is eternal and indestructible, an
entity in itself. The theory then is that
an atom of matter is a vortex-ring in or
of ether, set up by some underlying
force, and that all the attributes displayed
by material atoms are incidents
of this vortex mode of motion. Its hardness
is the same as the impenetrability
of a whirlpool through which a swimmer
cannot pass. Its stability is of the same
sort as that of the tops, held contrary to
gravity by a cord on one end of the axis,
so long as they revolve rapidly—a principle
utilized to give absolute rigidity to
the steering gear of torpedoes. And it
is the simplest explanation of atomic
affinities to suggest that it is the rate, or
coefficient, of vibration (vibration being
another name for circuit of activity)
which determines the attractive or repellant
force we see manifested.

And there is a most curious resemblance

{570}

in all this to John Worrell
Keeley's last theory—that each individual
has a dominant coefficient of vibration,
which gives rise to and explains
all our happy and unhappy associations
in life, so that as the newspapers hastened
to say, if we only knew how to
find this note, scientific inquests beforehand
would drive the divorce courts out
of business.

The music of the spheres, the thought
of individuals as notes in a universal
concord are very poetic, but inasmuch as
music is the art of harmonic expressive
vibrations manifested to sense as sound,
there is, if Lord Kelvin, and some
others, are right, at least as much hard
scientific fact in it all as imagery.

In short, the leading fact of science
to-day is plainly, that Nature draws
forms which outline and illustrate the
underlying realities of evolutionary progress,
and these forms are grasped by
our sense-perceptions as endowed (by
virtue of the self-persistent and destruction-resisting
nature given to them by
the force that causes them) with the
attributes of hardness or impenetrability
and mutual attraction. Differently
stated, what we call matter is in no sense
substance, and the attributes by which
we describe it are only the effects produced
upon our senses by contact with
force-forms, manifesting the life in
nature. So that the really substantial
thing in life is seen to be form, of which
so-called matter is but an incident, apparitional
only, and of little reality and
no substantiality whatever—a term to
express the condition of manifestation.

And what of all this, some one may
say. The nature of atoms has only a
remote interest to the problems of daily
life, save as medicine may be aided by
chemical research or stronger ship armor
invented by the metallurgist. And as
for music and poetry, they are for our
entertainment when serious affairs are
laid aside. To such there are two
answers.

First of all, a world made up of small,
hard, ponderable atoms, by some unshown
causes arranged in an infinite
variety of forms, is a rather hopeless and
uninspiring subject of research. It
meets admirably the type of mind which
delights in dissection, classification and
labeling, but if one should be interested
to know what it is all about, he might
be readily pardoned for the conclusion
that it is probably not about anything,
and has achieved the purpose of its being
in the world when it has been properly
catalogued.

But once the substance of things
physical is found to consist in units of
force, conditioning space—force-forms as
we have called them—of diverse characters,
the whole universe of matter becomes
a wonderful study, radiant with
inspiration, for its solution and meaning
are enfolded in its every atom, and in
the very attributes by which they are
manifested to our sense perceptions they
hold and declare their message to the
Perceiver within. And if each atom is
the expression of a unit of force, then so
must every composite form be the expression
of a harmony of forces, else it
could not stand, and so must every
event, every scene in our lives and in
the history of peoples, every record of
the earth, every alphabet, be a harmonic
formula, eloquent of the underlying
truth, the cause and meaning of life on
earth.

Form is the essentiality, reality within
gross matter, so-called, manifesting the
divine thought, which it sub-serves,
while the pseudo-matter of science is left
to the place which that, at last approaching
the occult teaching, assigns it—but
sense illusion.

One other deeply important lesson
lies in this recognition of Form as the
real of Matter. The bondage of the Soul
in matter, its prison-house, takes on a
new meaning, and the true nature of the
great foe is revealed. For if Form is the
great Manifester, so is it also, once we

{571}

forget that truth, the great Deluder.
Just how the soul might get entangled
in a world of small hard, material atoms
could never be quite clear to us, nor
could we see any relation between
matter such as this and Soul, which we
understood as Consciousness, Wisdom,
Thought. The fact of the entanglement
was too evident to be denied, but why
the soul should
fiat
itself such a prison
house was another inscrutable bit of
Providence.

But if the real nature of material substance
is seen to be form, the manifester
of ideas, it is very clear wherein our
bondage lies, for the images produced by
our lower minds, the vehicles of the
Soul, unless seen in their true light, in
very fact bind us tighter than any conceivable
matter could do. The children
of our thoughts and of the thoughts of
the race, in this as in past lives, the
formulated ideas, the mental habits, are
our prisons, and the only prisons the
soul knows. But once this thought-form
is given birth to, invested with
force from ourselves, it persists a veritable
material wall, harder far than one
of rocks and iron. We are educated to
the use of a certain phraseology, and it
is the hardest thing in the world for us
to recognize the identical ideas, differently
clothed. The idea of separateness,
crystallized into a form, a habit (garment,
clothing) of thinking, is what
stands between us and an actual direct
perception of an existing brotherhood
and unity. Forms of mental activity
are all that prevent our recognizing the
meaning of facts when we see them.
Scientific discoveries come by nothing in
the world but the momentary freeing of
the observer's mind from his preconceived
views concerning the fact before
him, and events are happening in the
world every day attention to which
would make prophets and gods of every
one, if we did not know so much—superannuated
rubbish—already.

is excellent not to act in conjunction with him."

STUDENTS' COLUMN.

CONDUCTED BY J. H. FUSSELL.

Does Universal Brotherhood imply condoning
the faults of others, or, on the other hand, condemning
them?

"No one can intelligently pursue the
path of Brotherhood without frequent
and heavy condemnation of acts, and of
persons as revealed in their acts."

"Judge no man."

"Judge the act, not the person."

Is there a reconciliation between the
three policies thus indicated? In trying
to follow the path of Brotherhood and promote
the best interests of our fellows, we
make a series of critical judgments. Seeing
a cause about to come into operation,
we make a judgment as to whether
its effects will promote Brotherhood. The
usual "causes" are the acts of persons;
we judge whether their effects will be
satisfactory; deciding No, we condemn
such acts, saying, "I regard Smith as
acting against the interests of Brotherhood."
That is not to say "The motive
of Smith in those acts is self-interest."
The chief point to be observed
in my attitude is that I shall not injure
Smith's evolution. Our final judgment
concerning most things is compound,
and the factors that enter into it are
two. These are (1)
MY
self-originated
judgment, (2) the judgment of others,
expressed in words, or, more potently,
silently, and in the last case subtly infusing
itself into my mind and blending
with my own proper judgment. The
resultant of these two factors is my final
judgment. The judgment that Smith
arrives at respecting his acts is, therefore,
a blend of
his
opinion and of
my

opinion respecting their tendency, and
it is none the less true even if after consideration
of my opinion he rejects it
and leaves his own, as he thinks, unmodified.
But suppose I strongly think
that Smith acts from motives of self-interest.
I have made a judgment respecting

Smith
as well as his
acts
. Am I wrong?
Not necessarily. My mind will become
a mirror wherein Smith may see himself
and reform. It will induce a self-examination
that must be beneficial in tendency.
But if my judgment to that effect
respecting Smith is consciously or
unconsciously colored with personal
feeling, that is, if I consciously or unconsciously
feel that Smith's self-interestedly
based actions may interfere with

my
personal interests or comfort, then
that feeling of potential or actual anger
or irritation will tend, not only to darken
my judgment but that of Smith, and
to excite similar detrimental emotions
in him.

No human being can avoid making
such judgments as to another. The right
counsel of perfection would be, not to
avoid them, for the higher we go the
more numerous are the people we have
to
help
, and, therefore, preliminarily to

judge
that intelligent help may be given;
but to aim at the exclusion of the personal
self from the judgment, making it
as lofty as possible. To judge should
be to sympathize, that is, to
feel like
.
To judge Smith is to understand him,
that is, for a moment to feel as he feels.

To compare what I have thus sympathetically
ascertained to be his feeling with my
ideal of the highest feeling of a judgment
on Smith.

Let us throw away fear; learn to know

ourselves and others
, and unhesitatingly
compare with an ideal. That men act
wrongly is always from ignorance of even
their own
real
welfare. No judgment
should, therefore, contain anger, irritation,

{573}

or any similar feeling. Bearing that
in mind as an ideal, criticism and judgment
become duties.

T. N.

Universal Brotherhood does not necessarily
imply either of these. For the
purposes of this question we may define
Brotherhood as acting towards others in
such a way as to help them in their
life and development, at the same time
regarding them as inseparable units of
humanity. Now there may be and are
times in the lives of all of us when the
condoning of a fault,
i. e.
, the pardon or
overlooking of a fault, may be the greatest
help. Then again there are times
when the outspoken condemnation of a
fault—not of a person—may be the one
thing needed to help that person.

But Brotherhood is not sentimentality,
it is justice as well as compassion, it is
that love for the real inner man that is
not afraid of hurting the personal man
when this is for the sake of principle and
actuated by true love. The sentimental
condoning of a fault does not help and
those who follow a sentimental idea of
Brotherhood too often swing to the other
extreme and indulge in wholesale and
unfounded condemnation, not simply of
a fault, but of persons.

Brotherhood is not extreme in either
direction. The middle path is the path
of Brotherhood, this above all is the
path of principle—the path of the principle
of love and the principle of justice.
If we apply to our conduct the injunction:
"do unto others as ye would they should
do unto you," we shall not go far
wrong.

True it is that our responsibility increases
as our knowledge increases and
as the knowledge of the physician and
surgeon may require him to amputate a
limb or give temporary pain in order to
save the patient's life, so every true man
is a physician and surgeon, first in his
own life and then in the lives of others.
On the other hand, the true physician
will often draw away the mind of the patient
from his sickness or disease, and
how often can we not help a failing
brother by apparently ignoring a fault
and calling out the nobler side of the
nature!

If we are true to the better side of our
own natures we shall soon learn in what
true Brotherhood consists. But no one
can be a true Brother to another who is
afraid to apply the knife to his own failings,
or who is not honest in his own
endeavors. We students may make mistakes
in our acts of Brotherhood, but if
we keep in the light of the soul and keep
our motives pure the realization of
Brotherhood will not be far distant.

J. H. Fussell.

Whence arises the sense of duty? In what
does it originate?

It is above all things requisite that the
expression of great ethical or moral or
religious principles should be universally
applicable. That is to say, they should
take the simplest form. Most of our religious
divisions are the result of an endeavour
to make a local or special condition
a standard to which all must conform.
Great moral principles are as
adaptable and as elastic (and no more) in
their own sphere, as great physical principles.
The laws of gravitation, cohesion,
and the other great forces set duties
for material objects to which the perfection
of their evolution enables them to
respond. But circumstances alter cases.
A piece of ice will fall to the ground if
dropped; if released at the bottom of a
pail of water it will rise to the top; no
further. The duty of the ice in one case
is to fall; in the other, to rise.

In the region of the soul duty is understood
usually to be the sense of moral
obligation.

We are told that duty is what we owe.
It is to be remembered that when we
have done all we are unprofitable servants.
The talent hid in a napkin was
duteously safe. But there is a higher
duty to Him who gathers where He has

{574}

not scattered. What is due is, in fact,
greater than what we owe. The educative
and evolutionary quality of our experience
depends upon this. And it is
here that the distinction between the
higher and lower duty may be found. It
is a principle in chancery law that he
who seeks equity must do equity. Similarly
those who desire to ascend or progress
must fulfil all the lower stages of
growth and be free of what they owe before
they can undertake the rendering of
their due. Renunciation also begins
here. The old story of the servant, forgiven
a large debt, and turning on his
fellow and debtor illustrates this. The
ceremonial law of the Jews for example,
was an educative force in the direction
of insuring the recognition of those in
authority, crude symbols of the divine.
Our modern taxes and tariffs have precisely
the same educative effect as the
tithes and offerings of old, the modern
method reaching a more practical result.

There is a Principle or Power in the
Universe which provides for all creatures.
It is generally known as Providence.
It is called God and Karma and
the Law. When men consciously ally
themselves with this Power they also
become Providers. They learn that it is
more blessed to give than to receive.
They also learn which is the river, the
water or the banks that confine the
water. The promptings of evolution, of
the Kumara, the immortal One that ensouls
a man and makes him divine, carry
him forward along the line of least resistance.
It is the business of the river
to reach the ocean, not to break down
the banks. All this implies action, and
the formation of character. While Fohat
is in manifestation, duty means to act,
to do. To do justice, to love mercy, to
walk humbly before the inner god. To
love that Holy One with all the heart
and mind and strength, and to see in
one's brothers the same object of devotion
is to conform to the will of the
Higher Self. Duty on the lower levels
of life is a means for the development of
the lower manas or brain mind.

Ben Madighan.

Let us dissect away certain overgrowths
which obscure this point. Obedience
to duty is often only conscious,
half conscious, or unconscious fear of
the consequences of neglect. A child
who has burned his finger thereafter
dreads the flame, and the dread persists
when the memory of the burn has died
out of his practical consciousness. Many
honest people do not steal because they
retain an unconscious memory of the
disgrace attending a revealed theft in
childhood or in a previous incarnation.
Fear, hope of reward or commendation,
these two, whether conscious or existing
in their effects as the fixed habit of performance,
must be eliminated as inspirers
of action before we can see how much remains.
It is possible that with most of
us not much of the pure golden sense of
duty would remain in the bottom of the
crucible.

Actions whose performance is a duty
are not always unpleasant. For instance,
to eat is a duty, because at a proper time
the Law, manifesting as hunger, demands
it.

The Law arises twofold; outwardly it
manifests as circumstance, presenting
at every moment a tangled maze of paths
of which any one may be selected; internally
as the impulsion to select one
particular path of these many. In his
spiritual thought, the inner man has
already traversed that path. In outer
fact it remains for the terrestrial man to
imitate in the concrete. The sense of
duty is the reflection in the outer consciousness
of this picture of action existing
in the inner, which picture, in the
inner world,
is
action. It may be dimly
or brightly mirrored, the sense of duty
weak or strong; its concrete imitation
may be effected or not, duty done or not.

YOUNG FOLKS' DEPARTMENT.

A CHRISTMAS STORY.

BY M.Â S.Â L.

It

was a big toy shop in West Twenty-third
Street. There were crowds of
people hurrying by, for to-morrow
would be Christmas Day and all those
who had children to love were busy buying
presents. The shop windows looked
very gay indeed.

There were all sorts of toys you could
imagine. Lots of new mechanical toys,
steam engines that ran on a real track,
dancing bears and a cat which played
the fiddle. In the middle of the window
was a tiny fir tree all lit up with colored
lights and its boughs covered with gay
ornaments. Santa Claus was there, too,
and on his back he carried a pack from
which came a stream of candy and toys.

All these things pleased the little boys
and girls very much. There were a number
of them out shopping with their
parents. The boys admired the mechanical
toys, but the little girls went straight
to the other shop window where there
were oh, such a lot of dolls! China dolls
and wax dolls; dolls from Germany and
dolls from France; dolls that could say
"Mamma," "Papa," and others that
could even sing a little song and say
"Now I lay me." The finest doll was a
young lady who had just arrived from
Paris. Mademoiselle Fifine had brought
with her a trunk of fine costumes and
some of these were spread out beside her
in the window, to the great admiration
of the other dolls. There were pink silk
frocks and blue satin ones; hats and
bonnets trimmed with real lace and ostrich
feathers, and, in fact, all sorts of
nice clothes for evening wear and morning
wear, and all occasions.

Away down in a corner of the big window
were two little dolls that nobody
noticed at all, and this was strange, for
they were really very pretty; but I suppose
they were unnoticed in such a crowd
of fashionable dolls. One of these two
was a little lady straight from Japan, and
the other was a New York District Messenger
Boy. The Japanese doll was
dressed in a lovely gown of purple silk
all covered with yellow butterflies. Her
hair was done up in a shining black coil
on the back of her head and was all
stuck through with tiny jewelled pins.
In her tiny hand she carried a paper fan.
The little messenger boy stood very
proudly beside her. He wore a suit of
dark blue clothes and on his head was a
little cap such as the New York boys
wear; he carried a black book in his
hand and looked very alert, as though
he were just about to deliver a telegram
to you.

These two from the corner of the window
all day had watched the people
passing up and down the busy street.
That is, the Japanese doll had watched
the passers by, but the Messenger Boy
had watched her more than anything
else. He thought she was the oddest
and prettiest little lady he had ever
seen; her eyes were so black and shiny,
her cheeks so rosy and her tiny mouth
just like a round red cherry. And then
she sat up so gracefully and held her
fan with such an air! "She isn't a bit
stiff," thought the Messenger Boy, "I
believe I will try to make friends with
her." So he cleared his throat and said
"ahem!" The Japanese Lady gave a
tiny jump. You see, she was so surprised!
Then she gave a shy look at

{576}

the Messenger Boy and twirled her little
fan. She saw that the Messenger Boy
was about to speak to her and this
pleased her very much, for the other
dolls in the window had treated her with
contempt and snubbed her because she
was a foreigner. Even the French Doll
had refused to be friendly, and this was
rather odd, because she was also a foreigner.
But she said the Japanese Doll
was outlandish and had no style about
her. The Japanese Lady was too polite
to make any rude remarks in answer, so
she had just remained silent.

She now began talking to the Messenger
Boy and they soon became fast
friends. So satisfied were they with
each other's society that they quite forgot
the rude dolls.

It began to grow late in the afternoon
and now very few children passed by.
But there were more big people than before;
they passed into the shop and soon
the dolls began to go from the window.
Mademoiselle Fifine went and most of
the pretty dolls followed. Nobody
seemed to want the Japanese Lady or the
Messenger Boy, but they did not mind
that at all, for they were quite content
to be together. The Japanese Lady had described
to the Boy all the beautiful things
she had seen in far away Japan, while
the Boy had told her in return of some of
the wonderful sights to be seen in the big
city. They grew very confidential, and
at length their affection became so firm
that they vowed to remain true friends
as long as they were dolls, which was
another way of saying as long as they
lived.

I have said that almost all the children
had gone home because it was getting
late, and now the electric lamps were
lighted, but there were still four little girls
who were looking in the gay window on
Twenty-third Street. Two of them were
nicely dressed and their bright faces
peeped out from warm furs. They looked
so full of joy that it made your own face
beam in return. Their nurse was with
them and they were out doing their
Christmas shopping.

"We've bought most all the presents
we mean to give to-morrow, and now we
can each spend our very own two dollars,"
said Bessie.

"Yes," answered her sister Alice,
"Wasn't it nice in Uncle Frank to give
us each two dollars to spend. It's much
nicer to buy your own present, I think."

They were looking in the window of
the toy shop as they spoke and both
little girls at once spied our two friends
in the comer of the window.

"I am going to buy that dear little
Japanese doll," said Bessie.

"And I want that cute little Messenger
Boy," said Alice.

The Japanese Lady and the Messenger
Boy looked very happy at this, for they
thought it would be very nice to go to
live with two such dear little sisters. So
they smiled and nodded at Bessie and
Alice, but the little girls never saw it.
This was not strange, for they had never
heard that all the dolls come to life on
Christmas Eve.

Now all the time the two small sisters
had been admiring the dolls, there were
two other children who were looking at
them just as eagerly, but who were very
different in appearance from Bessie and
Alice. For these children were very
poor indeed and did not expect to have
any doll at all on Christmas morning.
They lived away down in East Fourteenth
Street with their big sister. Their
mother and father were dead and the
only one they had to take care of them
was this good big sister who loved her
two little sisters very dearly and did all
she could for them. They all lived together
in two little rooms, and Maggie,
who was ten, did all the housekeeping,
while Annie, who was eight, helped her
as much as she could. They had just been
to the great department store where the
big sister worked and had left some supper
for her, because this night she would
have to work until half-past eleven.

{577}

They were now on their way home,
but although they were very cold and
shivered through the thin garments they
wore, they had to stop to see the beautiful
dolls.

"Oh, jest look at this little doll in the
purple dress, ain't she grand! See the
little yeller butterflies all over her! I
wisht I could have her for Chrissmus,"
said Maggie.

"I'd ruther have the little boy in the
blue suit," answered Annie. "He looks
jest like a fair messenger boy. Ain't he
cute?"

And the two children pressed their
faces against the window in profound
admiration of the wonderful dolls. After
a while they moved away.

In the meanwhile Bessie and Alice with
their nurse had entered the toy shop.
After admiring the various things each
purchased the doll she liked best. These
were carefully done up by the salesman
and the two children started for home.

They were at the corner of Broadway
and about to cross for a cable car when
Bessie caught sight of our two little
Fourteenth Street children.

"Oh, nursie, do let us see those two
poor little girls. They don't look as
though they were going to have any
Christmas at all!"

"Never mind them, Miss Bessie, it's
time you were home."

But Bessie would not be persuaded and
Alice seconded her. "Mother likes to
have us kind to our poor little brothers
and sisters," said she, "please nurse, let
us speak to those little girls." So the
nurse rather reluctantly consented and
the two children hurried and soon
caught up with Annie and Maggie.

"How do you do," said Bessie, all out
of breath. "Please, wouldn't you like
to have a Christmas present? We are
going to have a whole lot of presents
to-morrow and we bought these with our
very own money. Please take mine,"
and she thrust her package into surprised
little Maggie's arms.

"And please do take my present,"
said Alice, going to Annie. "Indeed,
I will have a lot more," and she handed
her package to the astonished little girl.

"We wish you a happy Christmas,"
said the little girls in one voice, and before
Maggie and Annie could speak, they
had both hurried away.

To say that our children were astonished,
hardly expresses it. They
hugged their bundles and stood on the
sidewalk staring after the two little girls
as though bewildered. Maggie was the
first to recover.

"Oh, aint it too good to be true, we'll
have a real Chrissmus, now, won't we?"
What kind little girls them was, wasn't
they? They wasn't a bit stuck up!"

"No, indeed!" answered Annie.
"I'm so s'prised I don't know what to
do."

But it was growing cold and the two
children were forced to hurry along.
They did not say much as they hastened
through the crowded streets but their
hearts were dancing with joy. When
they at last reached home they rushed
up the long tenement stairs and stopped
in the hall before their door. "Let's go
to bed right now without opening our
bundles," said Maggie, "and then to-morrow
morning we can wake up and
have a s'prise jest like we wuz rich
children!" Annie agreed to this and
the two children were soon fast asleep in
their small bed in the cold dark room.

On Christmas morning two children
in a beautiful home on Madison Avenue
were dancing around their nursery full
of happiness over the lovely presents
that had been made ready for them during
the night. They had so many gifts
that they never missed the two presents
they had given to the poor little sisters
the night previous, until suddenly Bessie
clasped Mademoiselle Fifine in her arms
and said:

"Oh, you dear French dollie, you are
very beautiful, but I do not think you

{578}

are nicer than the sweet little Japanese
doll I saw in the shop window last
night!" How Mademoiselle Fifine
would have liked to turn up her tiny
aristocratic nose at this, but she couldn't.

And Alice said, "Do you know, sister,
it seems to me that this is the loveliest
Christmas we have ever had."

"I think it must be because we know
that somewhere in this city there are two
little girls who are having a Christmas
treat because of us."

"It is quite true what mother taught
us, that 'It is more blessed to give than
to receive.'"

Down in East Fourteenth Street two
little sisters had slept all night cuddled
close together for warmth. Bright and
early they waked up on Christmas morning
and Maggie's first words were:

"Annie, do you know I dremt that
the little Japanese doll we saw in the toy
store wus in my bundle."

"That's queer, for I dremt that the
messenger boy was in my package!"

Then Maggie got her package and sat
up in bed, carefully undoing the wrappings
of paper, until, at last, smiling
before her lay the little Japanese Lady!

And Alice opened her parcel, and,
when the last paper had carefully been
removed, there was the Messenger Boy
all ready to say "How do you do!"

How very happy our two little girls
were! They got out of bed very softly,
so as not to disturb big sister, who was
very tired from her night's work, and
they danced around the cold room, hugging
their dollies and kissing each other
and the dollies indiscriminately.

"This is the very bestest Chrissmus I
ever had," said Maggie, at last.

"I only hope the two little rich girls
have as nice a one," added Annie.

"I'm very glad we came here, aren't
you?" softly called out the Messenger
Boy to the Japanese Lady.

"Yes, indeed," replied she. "I'm sure
these dear little girls will love us very
much."

"And we are not separated," said the
Messenger Boy.

The Japanese Lady did not reply to
this, but she smiled very sweetly and
twirled her little fan.

BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITIES.

UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD ORGANIZATION.

"Slowly the Bible of the race is writ,

Each age, each kindred adds a verse to it."

Universal

Brotherhood or the Brotherhood of Humanity is an organization
established for the benefit of the people of the earth and all creatures.

This organization declares that Brotherhood
is a fact in nature.

The principal purpose of this organization
is to teach Brotherhood, demonstrate
that it is a fact in nature and
make it a living power in the life of
humanity.

The subsidiary purpose of this organization
is to study ancient and modern
religion, science, philosophy and art; to
investigate the laws of nature and the
divine powers in man.

This Brotherhood is a part of a great
and universal movement which has been
active in all ages.

Every member has the right to believe
or disbelieve in any religious system or
philosophy, each being required to show
that tolerance for the opinions of others
which he expects for his own.

The Theosophical Society in America
is the Literary Department of Universal
Brotherhood.

The International Brotherhood League
is the department of the Brotherhood for
practical humanitarian work.

The Central Office of the Universal
Brotherhood Organization is at 144 Madison
Avenue, New York City.

"Helping and sharing is what Brotherhood means."

I.B.L.

This organization affirms and declares that Brotherhood is a fact in
Nature, and its objects are:

1. To help men
and women to realize
the nobility of their
calling and their true position in life.

2. To educate children of all nations
on the broadest lines of Universal Brotherhood
and to prepare destitute and
homeless children to become workers for
humanity.

3. To ameliorate the condition of unfortunate
women, and assist them to a
higher life.

4. To assist those who are, or have
been, in prison, to establish themselves
in honorable positions in life.

5. To endeavor to abolish capital punishment.

6. To bring about a better understanding
between so-called savage and civilized
races, by promoting a closer and
more sympathetic relationship between
them.

7. To relieve human suffering resulting
from flood, famine, war, and other
calamities; and generally to extend aid,
help, and comfort to suffering humanity
throughout the world.

It should be noted that the officers and
workers of the International Brotherhood
League are unsalaried and receive
no remuneration, and this, as one of the
most binding rules of the organization,

effectually excludes those who would otherwise
enter from motives of self-interest
.

{580}

None of the officers hold any political
office, the League is not connected with
any political party or organization, nor
has it any political character, it is
wholly humanitarian and unsectarian.

The alterations referred to in last issue
of
Universal Brotherhood
as
about to be made in Headquarters are
now nearly completed. The offices of
the different departments have all been
renovated presenting a very bright and
cheerful appearance.

The rooms formerly used by the Theosophical
Publishing Company have been
fitted up for the private office of our
Leader and for the Reference Library
and Reading Room and for the office of
the Literary Department of the Universal
Brotherhood Organization.

The Theosophical Publishing Company
has moved downstairs to the front
basement and to the front office on the
main floor (in the front part of Aryan
Hall) which hitherto was used by our
Leader for her private office.

In every way the new arrangements
will greatly facilitate the work of the
various departments.

We are all delighted to have with us
now as Mother of the household, Mrs.
L.Â E. Kramer, who with her husband,
J.Â O.Â K. Kramer, and her son Ernest
Kramer have brought such a home feeling
into Headquarters that we are like a
happy, united family.

On December 15, 16, 17, the H.Â P.Â B.
Lodge, U.Â B. No. 10, held a bazaar in
Aryan Hall. It was throughout very
successful and the entertainments on
Thursday and Saturday evenings were
much enjoyed. The members of Aryan
Lodge united with the H.Â P.Â B. members
in helping with the preparations
and during the Bazaar. A large hamper
of goods was sent from Meriden, Conn.,
which had been contributed by members
in Meriden, Hartford and New Britain;
a contribution of articles was also sent
from Buffalo; these were very much appreciated.

The H.Â P.Â B. Lodge is now entirely
free from debt and enters upon the New
Year with fine prospects of success.
Lately several new members have joined
the Lodge; these are active young
workers and are enthusiastic to help the
Cause.

Several of the small articles left over
from the Bazaar were sent down to the
East Side Mission where a Christmas
Tree is to be given to the children.
Mrs. Kramer, Mrs. Deen Hunt, and
Bros. Leonard and Hecht are busy making
preparations for this, and it is being
looked for to with great expectations by
the children.

A Bazaar was also held December 15
and 16 by the U.Â B. Lodges in Boston in
one of the largest and best halls, centrally
located on Tremont Street, the
main business street of the city. It was
one of the most successful events of the
kind held this year in Boston and has
brought excellent financial results.

In accordance with suggestions made
some months ago by our Leader in this
magazine, the Sioux City Lodge of U.Â B.
held a Bazaar with excellent results. Part
of the proceeds were taken for local work
and part sent to the Central Office for
the general work of the organization. If
all Lodges would carry out work of this
kind, how they could build up their local
work and also help the Centre! Some
of the other Lodges have reported work
in this direction, but we have not yet
received details.

A concert was recently given in Providence,
R.Â I., for the benefit of the War
Relief Fund of the I.Â B.Â L. It was well
attended and successful.

Frank C. Berridge of Victoria Lodge,
B.Â C., writes Dec. 13th:

"We are having a Brotherhood concert
here to-night and think it will be a
great success. We have started a Lotus
Circle here at last and have ten children
already. We are to give them a Christmas
Tree on New Year's Day. The Sunday
evening public lectures are well attended
and we are getting along nicely
in Victoria."

Lodge 70, U.Â B. (Chicago), held an entertainment
Dec. 14th and realized a
good sum for the War Relief Fund.
Bro. A.Â M. Smith writes: "Everything
moves along well here. Our members
are very united and have fullest confidence
in and sympathy with the Leader.
Our meetings are very well attended."

Letters from Dr. J.Â A. Anderson and
Bros. Griffiths and Johnson give favorable
accounts of Lodge work in San
Francisco, and of both the U.Â B. and the
I.Â B.Â L. meetings. Several new members
have recently joined. The whole
coast is looking forward to the U.Â B.
Congress at Point Loma.

{581}

Bro. Beckett sends good news from
Toronto. All the members are active
and desire to still further aid the work
and add to the success and solidarity of
the movement.

The members of Universal Brotherhood
will remember that soon after the last
Convention of February 18th some of
the members of the Narada Branch of
the Theosophical Society in America,
Tacoma, Wash., who did not accept the
Universal Brotherhood Constitution
brought suit against the Tacoma U.Â B.
Lodge to obtain possession of the property
of the Lodge. The case was non-suited
and dismissed. They then carried
the case to the Supreme Court of
Washington, and we have just received
copy of the judgment as follows:

Virginia Herman
et al
, Appellants,

vs.

Fred G. Plummer
et al
, Respondents.

Per Curiam
:—

"The parties to this action were all,
prior to March 3, 1898, members of the
Narada Theosophical Society of Tacoma,
a branch of a national organization
known as the Theosophical Society in
America. This local branch was an independent
body, controlling its own
property and governing itself subject to
the right of appeal to the executive committee
of the national body upon any
disputed questions arising between the
members. The object of the present
suit was to recover possession of certain
property of the local society, the appointment
of a receiver and other relief,
the action being mainly based upon an
alleged interference with the property
rights of the plaintiffs as members of
that Branch, and their rights as members
in various respects. At the close
of plaintiffs' case, on the evidence, a
judgment of non-suit and dismissal was
granted and the present appeal is from
that order and judgment.

We think the order was properly made.
Section 18 of the By-Laws of the National
Society is as follows: "The
Executive Committee shall be the Court
of final appeal in disputed questions
arising between members or in and

between branches
." It is not pretended
that any effort was made by the plaintiffs
to have the questions involved in
the present dispute determined by the
committee mentioned in that section,
and it is a well-established principle applicable
to controversies like the present
that until the members have exhausted
their remedy within the society the
Courts will not assume jurisdiction of
the controversy.

Oliver v. Hopkins, 10 N. E., 776;

Lafond v. Deems, 81 N. Y., 507;

Chamberlain v. Lincoln, 129 Mass., 70;

Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall, 679.

Appellants seek to justify their failure
to resort to the committee contemplated
by section 18, supra, upon the ground
that that section was in effect abolished
by the action of the national convention
at a meeting in Chicago in February,
1898, which practically adopted a new
constitution. We think the argument
advanced does not meet the objection.
Plaintiffs are contending that the action
of the national convention was invalid,
and if they are right in that respect the
constitution and by-laws of the old body
are still in force. They have no standing
if such is not the fact, and if it is,
then the remedy provided by section 18
would appear to be ample. But it does
not appear that any effort has been made
to obtain within the Society a determination
of the grievances, and even were
it admitted that the effect of the action
of the national convention was to abolish
the old constitution, it in nowise follows
that the by-laws theretofore adopted
would also become ineffectual. Section
18, supra, having been adopted for the
government of the national body and its
branches, must be given effect until it is
repealed either expressly or by necessary
implication. So that we think the
learned trial judge was right in concluding
that the Court should not take jurisdiction
of the case.

We think that we are right, too, in
concluding that plaintiffs' evidence was
insufficient to establish any interference
with their rights as members to the enjoyment
of the property, books, records,
etc., of the local branch. In other words,
plaintiffs failed to show that their rights
as members had been invaded. There
was evidence by the officers of the local
branch tending to show that a conclusion
had been reached by them not to
enforce the obnoxious resolutions previously
passed, and that they construed

{582}

them to be invalid. For these reasons
we must conclude that the judgment was
right and we do not deem it proper to
attempt at this time to determine
whether the action of the national convention
was in effect an amendment of
the old constitution and invalid because
adopted without previous notice to the
local branches, or the adoption of a new
constitution which retained the spirit
and essence of the old and included no
new provisions inconsistent with it and
therefore within the right of the convention.
At present an opinion upon that
important question would be at most
mere dictum."

On December 23d we were very glad to
welcome back to America Brother A.Â E.Â S.
Smythe, of Toronto. Brother Smythe
has been for some time in Ireland and
brings excellent and most encouraging
reports of the work there and in England.
Arrangements have been made
for him to take a lecturing tour and
visit the Universal Brotherhood Lodges,
reaching Point Loma at the time of the
annual Universal Brotherhood Congress.
He will be in New York about January
1st and will stay at Headquarters for a
week or so and then start on his tour.
Brother Smythe is so well known
throughout the country as Editor of the

Lamp
and by his work in Toronto that
he needs no introduction to the members.
Many have already heard him
lecture and will remember him at the
annual conventions. Those Lodges who
desire him to visit them should write at
once to the central office, so that the
route can be laid out and all arrangements
made.

It was originally intended and hoped
that Bro. D.Â N. Dunlop would have
made a lecture tour, but as he would not
be able to start until later, other arrangements
had to be made.

Letters from Liverpool report a very
large Bazaar being held there by the
members. It is confidently expected
that it will meet with much success and
much interest has been aroused in it.
Bro. Herbert Crooke has been indefatigable
in pushing forward the preparations
and Mrs. A.Â L. Cleather and Bro.
Basil Crump who have just completed
their Home Crusade visit to Dublin will
be there to help. A very beautiful and
attractive programme has been arranged.

Bro. Parsons in Vancouver, B.Â C.,
writes that the members are expecting a
big step forward for the work as a result
of the U.Â B. Congress at Point Loma
next April.

At Buffalo on the occasion of the performance
of "Eumenides," some of the
Headquarters Staff had the pleasure recently
of meeting Dr. and Mrs. McAlpin
of Warren, Pa. Their energies and interest
in the work are unabated, and on
his way back Bro. McAlpin lectured in
several places.

The Greek Play "Eumenides" was
given in Buffalo in the Music Hall, Dec.
3d, in the afternoon and evening.
Both performances were very successful.
There were large and very appreciative
audiences, many well-known educationalists
being present and afterwards expressing
their appreciation. After the
performance our Leader was waited upon
by several prominent people and congratulated
on the work of the Isis League
of Music and Drama. Since returning
to New York our Leader has received a
personal letter from one of the Ministers
of Buffalo expressing his pleasure at
witnessing the performance which he
said was characterized by moral uplifting
force and of more value than a sermon.

A very interesting letter has been received
from Bro. St. Clair of New Zealand
in regard to work among the
Maories. These people have made a
great advance during the past two years.
The different tribes have united under
their king and are reviving the ancient
customs of the race. Many are becoming
interested in Brotherhood work and
evidence on every hand is perceived that
the race is awakening to a new life.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

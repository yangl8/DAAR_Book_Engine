A SON OF MARS.

CHAPTER I.

IN THE MILITARY CRADLE.

To the right, under the arch leading to the
casemate barracks at Triggertown, dwelt
Jonadab Larkins, a deserving public servant
who had enjoyed the proud position
of barrack sergeant for some years. He
was like the old lady who lived in the shoe.
He had more children than he could do
with comfortably, so he gave it up as a
bad job, and let them do for themselves.
Mrs. Larkins, what with cooking, cleaning,
and the family washing, had no spare time
on her hands; and except to yell out shrill
[2]

cautions which no one heeded, or threats
of corporal punishment which were forgotten
as soon as uttered, allowed her brood
to risk their lives as freely as they pleased.
They had many outlets of this kind; one
favourite amusement was to hang themselves
to the chains of the drawbridge
leading to the barracks; another to walk
along the brick edge of the counterscarp;
but that which all enjoyed most was to
watch the approach of vehicles in the main
thoroughfare, and to rush madly across the
road right under the horsesâ feet. It was
often a very near thing; and the nearer
they went to self immolation the better
they were pleased. But the pitcher goes
once too often to the well. One fine day
there was a tremendous disturbance in the
street; a crowd gathered quickly, and presently
a message reached Mrs. Larkins that
[3]

one of her bairns had been driven over and
was killed.

âWhich on âem is it?â shrieked the red-armed
but pleasant-visaged dame. âNot
Rechab, nor yet Sennacherib, nor yet Jemimer
Ann?â

No; it was Hercules Albert, the eldest
of the family, who was just then carried
in and laid upon the bed.

A lady—a middle-aged lady, with silver
white hair and a worn emaciated face—followed,
and looking round with a strange
wild look in her eyes, asked almost hysterically:

âIs he much injured? Will he live?
Where are the people who call themselves
his parents?â

The lad was only stunned, and a little
water quickly brought him to.

âI should have been so grieved had he
[4]

come to harm,â went on the lady. âIt was
my coachmanâs fault. It has been a terrible
shock to me; quite terrible. But tell
me—â

She looked hastily round, then whispered
to Larkins—

âHow did you come by this child?â

The Sergeant stared at her in amazement—

âHonestly! Why, itâs our own—leastways
itâs the motherâs.â

âDo you mean that you are its mother?â
she asked of Mrs. Larkins.

âCertainly I do! Do you dispute it?â

âMother? Yes. It may be so. But you,
you man, you are not his father? You
cannot be. It is impossible, simply impossible.
Why, the child has
his
eyes; his
own dear eyes, I could swear to them
among a thousand. You cannot, you shall
[5]

not deceive me. How came you by this
child?â

âHeâs not my own son, that I wonât
deny,â said the Sergeant. âBut he is my
missusâs; she was a widow when I married
her, and—â

âI must have the boy. You cannot refuse
him to me. I will buy him of you;
will pay you any price you please. But
he must leave this place. It is no place
for
him
.â

And she gazed scornfully at the humble
surroundings. The little dark vaulted room
with its one deep recessed window, its inner
space curtained off to form a second bedroom,
the litter and mess about the floor.

âThis is no place for—â

She paused suddenly, and a wild scared
look came over her face. A footman, one
of her own people, a tall, black-whiskered
[6]

and pompous Jeames, was standing in the
doorway, and the sudden apparition seemed
to put a seal upon her tongue.

âThe horses, mâlady,â said the man respectfully
enough, although there was an
accent of authority in his voice. âThe
horses have been standing nearly half an
hour, mâlady, and the coachman says—â

âYes, yes, Iâll come at once—at once,
Robert. Good people, you will understand
my anxiety for the boy. The blame rested
so entirely upon us. It is an immense
relief to know that he is not injured.â

Then watching her opportunity, she
hissed out with frenzied eagerness—

âNot a word to a soul; not a syllable,
as you value
his
future and my peace. I
will come again to-morrow, or sooner, unattended.
H—sh, for heavenâs sake, h—sh,â
and she hurriedly left the room.

[7]

âWell, Iâm blowed,â said the Sergeant,
drawing a long breath. âIf that ainât the
rummest game. What does it mean, missus?
Can you tell?â

Mrs. Larkins met his inquiring eyes
quite steadily, and if she was conscious of
any mystery no suspicion of it could be
traced in her voice and manner.

âShe must be off her head—thatâs my
notion—clean, stark, staring mad.â

âAnd mine too. Yon flunkey was her
keeper, I expect. Bound to look after her
and keep her out of mischief. Itâll make a
fine talk in the barracks, this will.â

âI donât see why it should. I wouldnât
let on if I was you; donât gossip about it at
the canteen, Sergeant, or at the sergeantsâ
mess. Whatâs the good?â

A docile and obedient husband was
Sergeant Larkins, who, through all the
[8]

years of his married life, had accepted his
wifeâs will as law. Mrs. Larkins was a
buxom, bright-eyed dame, who made a
manâs home comfortable for him, so long as
he allowed her to rule.

âYouâre right. Itâs a folly always to
talk, leastways when youâve nothing to talk
about, and the freaks of a mad woman donât
amount to much. We shanât hear no more
about
her
.â

Nor did they for days, nay, weeks, but
months, and the episode was fading from
their memories, at least from that of the
Sergeant, when the lady suddenly re-appeared
unattended and alone.

She looked suspiciously about her as
she entered the room.

âI could not come before. I have been
watched. Even now I fear they are on my
track. Quick! Where is the boy?â

[9]

Hercules Albert was where he and his
brothers generally were—in mischief.

âI must see him; my heart yearns for
him. And to think that I should find him
thus! How inscrutable are the ways of
Providence! My sweet, my pet, it is balm
to my wounded heart!â And she kissed and
fondled the boy, regardless of the mud with
which his dirty face was encrusted, and of
his own evident perturbation and objection
to these endearments.

âBut I must not waste time. I may be
disturbed before I have said my say.
Listen: you will let me have the child?
You shall name your own price. I will
ask no questions. Keep your own counsel.
You shall not divulge your secrets.â

âThere ainât no secrets to divulge,â said
the Sergeant stoutly. âAnd you shanât buy
[10]

a brat of mine, as though he were a full-blooded
Congo on the West coast.â

âWait, Larkins—letâs see what the lady
means,â the practical wife interposed. Mrs.
Larkins was quite quiet and self-possessed,
as she looked her strange visitor full in the
face. âPerhaps she will explain. Do you
wish to adopt the child?â

âI do—and more. I wish to educate
him to be worthy of his birth, and of that
position which he must some day come to,
in spite of all. He shall have all my love
while I live, all my possessions after death.
They are his by right, indefeasible. Has he
not Herbertâs eyes? Is he not my—?â

âSay no more, Madam,â Mrs. Larkins interrupted
her. âIf you are in sober, serious
earnest, if you mean what you say—â

âSurely you would not part with the
child, not like this?â

[11]

âWe have seven, Jonadab, and it is a
fine chance for one. If you are in earnest,
Madam—â

âWill this prove to you that I am in
earnest?â said the lady, taking from her
purse a roll of bank notes. âHere are fifty
pounds. Spend it in outfit; get him proper
clothes, books, boxes, all that a boy wants
when he is going to a school. Within a
fortnight you shall hear from me through a
lawyer. I will send full instructions, and
a confidential messenger, who shall take
Herbert—Herbert he must be called, not
Hercules—Herbert Farrington.â

âIs that your own name?â asked Mrs.
Larkins, rather hurriedly.

âCertainly, I am Lady Farrington. You
have then heard the name before? You
know me? Say you know me, that you
knew Herbert. Confess that Herbert was—â

[12]

âMy lady, you are mistaken; I never
knew any Herbert Farrington—never in
all my life!â

Lady Farrington shook her head sadly.

âIf you know, and will not speak, you
may do the child irreparable harm. No
matter. It is sufficient for the present that
he is mine; that he passes into my keeping;
that I am free to lavish upon him the
whole of my pent-up yearning affection.
The rest will come—all in good time.
Heaven bless you, Herbert, and prosper
you, and bring you some day to your
own.â

She kissed the bewildered boy repeatedly,
shook hands with his father and
mother, and then left the place.

âI donât like it, I donât; blowed if I do,â
said the Sergeant. âIt ainât fair on the
youngster, it ainât—to give him over to that
[13]

crack-brained old idiot! Why, you may
tell she is mad by her talk and her ways.
Maybe sheâll fatten him up and eat him;
or perhaps sheâll turn him into a Papist or
a Frenchman. He shanât go.â

âYouâre a fool, Larkins! But itâs more
my business than it is yours after all. And
whereâs the harm? Doesnât she promise
fair enough, and ainât these notes a pretty
certain proof that she is all above board?
We wonât lose sight of the boy—not altogether.
Weâll stipulate that we are to
see him sometimes, and then he canât go far
wrong. But you hold your tongue, thatâs
what youâve got to do. None of your blabbing
or gossipping about. If they ask you
whatâs become of Herkles, why say heâs got
into the Duke of Yorkâs school, and wonât
be back for ever so long.â

âI wish he had. I could see my way
[14]

then. But I canât now, and it beats me
how you can take it all so coolly.â

The honest Sergeant was chiefly concerned
as to the little chapâs future prospects.
But although he was not a man of
keen intelligence or of suspicious nature, he
was also a little exercised as to the strangeness
of the whole affair. He might explain
the ladyâs conduct by calling it
eccentricity or madness, but he could not
quite understand the part his wife had
played.

He would have been still more perplexed
had he returned unexpectedly from the canteen
that evening after all the children were
in bed. He would have found his wife engrossed
with the treasures of a little box
which she had emptied on her lap. A few
gilt buttons, a lock of fair hair, a bow of
ribbon—that was all.

[15]

Yet she wept bitterly as she kissed them
again and again, and restored them one by
one to the sacred box reverentially, as
though each was a relic in her eyes.

[16]

CHAPTER II.

THE FARRINGTON FAMILY.

Farrington Court was the dower-house of
the Farrington family, where dowagers and
heirs apparent resided, according as it might
happen to suit. The Lady Farrington mentioned
in the last chapter had occupied it
for years—ever since the death of her husband
and her sons, when the bulk of the
property, with the title, had passed to Rupert
Farrington, the late baronetâs nephew.
Sir Rupert lived now at Farrington Hall,
with his wife and one son of his own.

Old Lady Farrington, in her losses and
her loneliness, was a woman much to be
pitied. She had seen her children die, all
of them but one. He also was dead, but
[17]

miserably, and at a distance probably from
home. Her husband she had mourned last
of all, at a time when she had most needed
strength and support. The new baronet
did not treat her well. She was no doubt
fortified by ample settlements. Farrington
Court was hers also, by right inalienable,
during her lifetime. Yet Sir Rupert had
had it in his power to put her to infinite
pain, and wittingly or unwittingly had not
spared her in the least. The ejectment
from the Hall—her once happy home, the
scene of her married life, where all her children
had been born, and where all were
buried, save one—had been carried out
with an almost brutal abruptness, which
cut the poor afflicted soul to the quick.
Sir Rupert had driven hard bargains with
her also in taking over the house and the
estate; had insisted upon the uttermost
[18]

farthing, had denied her many possessions,
small and great, which she valued as reminding
her of the past, but which were
his, according to the strict letter of the law.
His unkindness pursued her even to the
house which she might still call her own.
But hers was only a life-interest, after all;
and, as Farrington Court must in due
course lapse back to the family, Sir Rupert
felt bound, he said, for his own and his
sonâs sake, to see that the place came to no
harm. His interference and inquisitiveness
were, in consequence, constant and vexatious.
He insisted upon inspecting the
house regularly; he must satisfy himself
that the repairs were duly executed, that
the gardens and glass houses were properly
kept up, and that no timber was cut down.
He did not scruple to tell Lady Farrington
that he looked upon her as a tenant, and
[19]

by no means a good one, to whom he would
gladly give notice to quit if he could.

These first causes for irritation and dislike
deepened in time to positive hatred.
Lady Farrington came by degrees to fear
Sir Rupert with a terror that was almost
abject; and when we fear others to this
extent we undoubtedly hate them very cordially
too. Her terror was not difficult to
explain. It had its grounds in the conviction
that she was more or less in his power.
There was a secret which she had as she
thought kept hitherto entirely to herself,
but which he, as time passed and brought
him opportunities for close observation, had
eventually discovered. She herself knew,
and by degrees she felt that he also knew
that her mind was a little unsound.

Lady Farrington had been an eccentric
woman even in her husbandâs lifetime. Her
[20]

ways had been odd; her manners strange.
She was given to curious likes and dislikes,
which showed themselves in extraordinary
ways. Thus she hated the wife of a neighbouring
squire—an upstart woman, certainly,
but nothing worse than
gauche
or ill-bred.
Whenever this lady called at the hall the
chair on which she had sat was sent to the
upholsterers to be re-covered. On one occasion,
when she came at the time of afternoon
tea, Lady Farrington threw the cup
and saucer her visitor had used into the
fire, declaring it should never be drunk out
of again. A more unnatural antipathy was
that which she long entertained for her
second son—a dislike which had caused
him much misery, and her much subsequent
anguish of mind. As against all this,
she had been extravagantly fond of her
husband and her first-born. When the former
[21]

left her even for a few hours, she kept
his hat and walking-stick in the room with
her, as though to cheat herself into the belief
that he was really in the house; the
latter she coddled and cossetted to such an
extent that he grew up weakly and died
young.

But after all her bitter trials and heavy
blows, her eccentricity had developed so
rapidly that it might fairly be called by a
stronger name. At first she shut herself
up in a private chamber, surrounded by the
relics of happier days, and brooded sorrowfully
over riding-whips, cricket-bats, and
all manner of childish toys. Then she went
to the other extreme; threw off her widowâs
weeds and decked out in gay colours, and
with a long white veil, drove about the
country lanes in a carriage with grey horses,
as though she were a newly-married bride.
[22]

When Sir Rupertâs persecution had grown
into a serious annoyance, she concentrated
upon him all the aversion she had once
levelled at more innocent objects of dislike.
She never would have admitted him to
the house, but as he would take no denial
she consoled herself by throwing open all
the windows and doors, whatever the weather,
directly he had left the house, insisting
that the place was unfit for habitation
until it had been thoroughly aired. Then,
saying his threats and menaces put her in
bodily fear, she got into the habit of packing
all her most treasured belongings in
one or two trunks which she kept locked
in her bedroom, under her own eye, in
readiness as it were for immediate flight.

For a long time Sir Rupert seemed to
take but little notice of her vagaries. When
the county folk commiserated him, and
[23]

inquired after poor Lady Farrington, he
merely shrugged his shoulders and touched
his forehead in a melancholy pitying way.
She had had so much trouble in her time,
poor soul. It was very dreadful of course.
But what could be done? She had every
care and attention he could secure for her.
He went to see her frequently in spite of
her strange dislike, so did his wife. He did
his duty by her as well as he possibly could.
She was harmless, and as he thought perfectly
safe. She had good servants about
her; he himself saw to that, and there was
no necessity to put her under restraint—unless
indeed, she became very much worse.
If her malady increased to the extent of
endangering the safety of those about her
or of the house—by no means a secondary
consideration with him—why then, as a last
alternative, she must be shut up.

[24]

He did not conceal from her, however,
that this would ultimately be her fate.
More than once he warned her that he
knew her condition, and would some day
be compelled to take steps to make her
secure. But he said this with no object
but to prove his power, and Lady Farrington
would probably have been left to pursue
the curious tenour of her ways, had not
her mania taken a direction which threatened
to be distinctly inconvenient to Sir
Rupert.

Of all the woes which Lady Farrington
suffered, the keenest perhaps was remorse
for her treatment of her second son. As
has been said, she had looked upon him
always with disfavour; Herbert never could
please. Where another more tenderly
cared for would have been gently corrected,
he was called wilful, obstinate, perverse,
[25]

and sharply chided and admonished. He
it was who was always in the wrong; he it
was who led the other boys into mischief.
It was his fault, or said to be his, when the
boat upset, or the ice broke, or the gun
went off, or any mishap occurred. As he
grew to manâs estate his motherâs indifference
did not soften into warmer feelings.
Poor Herbert failed at school and college,
the obvious consequence of early neglect.
He could not pass the army examination,
although he longed to wear a red coat.
All he could do was to roam the woods
with dog and gun at Farrington, consorting
with grooms and keepers, enjoying an open
air life the more because he thereby escaped
from the house and his motherâs sneers.
But these last, although thus rarely encountered,
became at length unbearable, and
one fine morning Herbert was not to be
[26]

found. He had gone off, leaving a note to
say that pursuit or inquiry would be fruitless,
as he meant to leave England for good
and all; nothing should induce him to
return to Farrington Hall.

The blow fell heaviest upon Lady Farrington,
who felt that she had been principally
to blame. Prompt search was accordingly
instituted, but all to no purpose.

Some said that he had emigrated, some
that he had enlisted, others that he had
gone to sea. No one ever saw him in the
flesh again. Only Lady Farrington, in
whom the catastrophe had worked a strong
revulsion of feeling, was positive that she
had seen him in the spirit more than once.
He had appeared to her, last of all, just
after the death of Algernon, the eldest son.
Nor had he appeared alone. Hand-in-hand
with him was a comely fair-haired girl, with
[27]

a baby in her arms. Herbert had pointed
significantly to the child, and Lady Farrington
interpreted the gesture to mean that
he and his son were now the rightful heirs
of the Farrington title and estates. This
vision she tremulously described to her husband
and to others, but it was treated even
by Sir Algernon as a mere dream, or the
hallucination of an over-wrought brain.

Nothing more would have been thought
of the circumstances of Herbertâs disappearance
and shadowy return, except as a great
and irreparable sorrow, but for the arrival
of a mysterious packet, a year or two later,
which contained a lock of light curly hair—Herbertâs?—and
a scrap of paper, on which
was written, in Herbertâs handwriting, âBe
kinder to my boy.â

After this, a frantic desire to discover and
do justice to her injured son possessed Lady
[28]

Farrington, to the exclusion of all other
objects in life. The family lawyers were
called in; detectives, public and private,
were employed; advertisements were inserted
in the agony columns of the journals
with the largest circulation in the world.
As substantial rewards were offered, numbers
of sons were promptly forthcoming.
But not one of them was the right one; nor
was any information which could be relied
upon obtained, neither as to whether Herbert
Farrington himself was alive or dead,
or whether, in the latter case, he had left
any heirs. Lady Farrington endured another
and a more bitter disappointment
than any she had hitherto experienced in
life.

It was not till long after the death of
her husband and her occupation of Farrington
Court, that the old theory as to the
[29]

existence of a grandson was revived by her.
Why or wherefore no one could understand.
Had she come upon any traces of
the long-lost son? Or was it merely that
her mind, in its increasing weakness, worked
back into old grooves? Be the cause what
it might, Lady Farrington seemed at times
strangely positive that she should find the
missing dear one, or his representative,
after all. She often hinted, darkly and
mysteriously, that there was a great surprise
in store for Sir Rupert. Something
he little expected would assuredly come to
pass when matters were properly ripe.
There was no hurry. It was better to
make all sure before the mine was sprung.
No link in the chain must be wanting. But
all would be ready ere long. Then let Sir
Rupert look to himself.

All this gave the baronet, who was
[30]

really the man in possession, but little uneasiness.
As the next heir, he had heard
long ago of the eager inquiries for the missing
Herbert; and although he had resented
them then, he had accepted their impotent
conclusion as an unanswerable proof that
his presumptive rights were not to be impugned.
On the death of Sir Algernon his
title had not been disputed, and he had succeeded,
as a matter of course. Lady Farrington
had made no protest. There was
no shadow of foundation for a protest.
And if not then, would any person in his
sober senses think of disputing his rights
now, when he had a firm grip of the title,
property, and place? Only an old mad
woman would harbour such an idea. Even
she would hardly dare to raise the question
openly, after such a lapse of years. And
who would believe her if she did?

[31]

He told her so, very roughly, when her
allusions became more and more significant.
He warned her too that âshe had better be
careful what she said or did. It was a fact
well known to the whole country-side that
she was quite unable to take care of herself,
that she was not responsible for her actions,
that her proper place was an asylum, and
she might come to that yet if—â

One day, when he had been taunting
thus longer and more bitterly than usual,
she was goaded into making an incautious
reply.

âThe cup is nearly full to the brim,
Rupert. Your time is fast drawing to a
close.â

âWhat new craze is this, Lady Farrington?â
he said, laughing scornfully, but with
a black look on his face.

Sir Rupertâs was a hard dark face, with
[32]

full eyes rather prominent, and a long,
drooping, black moustache. When he
looked black it was not a pleasant face to
see.

âIt is nothing new, Rupert. I have
waited patiently, hopefully. I thought the
end would never come. It is near at hand
now, although the consummation has been
long delayed.â

âYour ladyshipâs language is, as usual,
clear and perspicuous, yet you will forgive
me if I ask you to explain.â

âListen,â she said, as she laid her hand
upon his arm, and hissed out her words
slowly one by one. âWithin a few short
months, nay weeks, whenever I choose, I
can produce the rightful heir of the Farringtons;
and he shall come to his own.â

âThis is mere rhapsody, mere raving.
You cannot touch me, you know that.â

[33]

âI can, ay, and I will, miserable fool!
You have not the shadow of a claim to the
title and estates. My grandson, Herbertâs
son, lives, and you must make way for
him.â

âPsha! Herbertâs son? How do you
know that? What proof have you?â

âThe youth himself. He has been
under my charge these five years past, and
more. I found him—I myself found him.
I knew I could not err. He had Herbertâs
eyes, he is Herbertâs image; he—â

âHe must have more proof than this if
he is to make good his case in a court of
law,â said Sir Rupert coolly.

âI know it, and the proof shall be forthcoming.
Every link in the chain.â

âAll right. If it is to be war to the
knife, so let it be. But I tell you plainly
that no one will believe a word you say.â

[34]

âThey will believe my beautiful boy,
my own Herbertâs boy, when they hear his
story from his own sweet lips. He shall
come forward himself when the occasion is
ripe for him to speak.â

âWhere is he now?â asked Sir Rupert,
carelessly, but with deeply cunning intent.

She laughed in his face.

âNo, no, Sir Rupert, I am not to be so
easily beguiled. He is safe, quite safe, to
be produced at exactly the right time.â

Sir Rupert gave her another fierce look,
which boded her no good, but he said nothing
more. He was not exactly disconcerted
by her positive assertions, which he
only half believed, yet his peace of mind
had been rudely assailed. That he must
discover the whereabouts of this mysterious
claimant, and test the accuracy of Lady
Farringtonâs far-fetched statements, was
[35]

clear. It was equally clear that he must,
if possible, put a gag upon the old woman,
and remove her where she could work no
further harm.

[36]

CHAPTER III.

âTWIXT CUP AND LIP.

Hercules Albert—or Herbert, as he was
henceforth to be called—was not a little
taken aback by the sudden change in his
circumstances, which followed Lady Farringtonâs
supposed recognition of him. To
be measured for a suit of black cloth, which
befitted best the Larkinsâ notion of gentility;
to have a brand new box, painted
green, with sundry new shirts, new boots,
and a broad-brimmed wide-awake hat,
all his own; these were so many delicious
surprises, the full effect of which was
fully borne in upon him by the openly-expressed
envy of the rest of the family.
But it was a wrench to him when the time
[37]

came to leave his home—the only one he
had ever known—to lose the companionship
of his playmates, and the warm, though
roughly-expressed, affection of the sergeant
and his wife.

âBe a man, Herkles,â the sergeant had
said, as the boy stood snivelling at the door
of the casemated room, which represented
the whole of the Larkinsâ establishment.
âEat your cake.â They had provided him
with a huge slice of bun-loaf, upon which
little Sennacherib Larkins, a freebooter like
his Assyrian sponsor, had made many inroads
while Herbertâs attention was distracted
by the new cares of property and
the pangs of making his adieux.

âEat your cake, and keep up your heart;
me and the missusâll be over to see you before
the monthâs out, and weâll bring Rechab
and Senn and Jemimer Ann.â

[38]

âItâs all for your own good, Herbert,â
said Mrs. Larkins. âTheyâre going to make
a gentleman of you. Youâll get learning,
and Latin, and French mathematics; and
by and by youâll be an officer, perhaps, and
live like a lord.â

The prospect was brilliant, but remote.
Herbert, as a child of the barracks, had
been brought up to believe that officers
were almost superior beings. He saw his
father, the sergeant, and all soldiers salute
them always, and pay them extraordinary
deference. When in uniform they were
resplendent in crimson and gold; when out
of it they drove dog-carts and played cricket
and owned dogs, all of which Herbert
would have liked to have done too. Yet
the off-chance of some day becoming an
officer himself did not reconcile him to
separation from the best friends he had in
[39]

the world; and as he left Triggertown casemates,
he wept bitterly, and refused to be
comforted.

If life looked black and forbidding then,
it was a thousand times worse when he
got to school. A cross-grained old man—it
was Mr. Bellhouse, Lady Farringtonâs
solicitor—escorted him thither, and snubbed
him all the way. The old lawyer was a
little sick of her ladyshipâs caprices, and
considered this last the most serious of all.
But it was none of Herbertâs fault, and the
poor woe-begone home-sick lad did not
deserve to be made to answer for Lady
Farringtonâs sins. At school he was left
stranded, like a waif of the sea upon an
unknown shore. Presently the natives,
troops of little savage school-boys, swooped
down upon him to scalp and torture him.
He was pestered with questions, and his
[40]

hair pulled, his strange wide-awake was
jeered at, and given to the winds.

But the instincts of self-defence are
strong, and Herbert, if new to school life,
was not new to the use of his fists. His
tormentors were numerous, but with one
or two exceptions were not much older
or bigger than himself, and when it came
to a question of blows and hard knocks he
was physically well able to take care of
himself. Presently a âstraight unâ from
the shoulder relieved him of the most troublesome
of his assailants, and a second,
planted upon the nose of a tall bully, proved
that Herbert thought nothing of disparity
in height when disposing of his foes. Boys
are sensibly affected by the display of
pluck, especially against superior odds, and
Herbert soon gained for himself the respect
[41]

due to his prowess, and immunity from further
annoyance.

He was vexed and irritated no more,
but he went to his bed, a far more cleanly
and luxurious couch than that which he
had been accustomed to in the crowded
casemate at Triggertown, with a sad and
sorrowful heart. There are no woes so
acute as those of early youth. Happily
they are as transient as they are intense.
Herbert at night was in the depths of woe;
next morning he was already in a fair way
to recover his spirits, and before the day
was out, in the excitement of the new life
opening before him, he had forgotten his
sorrows and was as happy as a bird. He
was just the boy to get on at school. Brisk
and buoyant in disposition, with a well-knit
vigorous frame, a predilection for games of
every kind in which, with a little experience,
[42]

he soon excelled, he rapidly advanced
in the estimation of his fellows. He was
liberal and free-handed too, which did not
make him the less appreciated, and he had
plenty to give away. âHis people,â as boys
call their friends, were evidently of the
right sort. The old lady with the snow-white
hair and large mournful eyes, who
came to see him regularly every month,
was right royal in her tips, and not to him
alone, but to any whom he called particular
friends. He got tuck baskets continually
and presents of all kinds to which others
administered as freely as himself. These
are substantial grounds for school popularity,
and Herbert enjoyed it in the highest
degree.

As he grew in years and developed in
strength and good looks, Lady Farringtonâs
affectionate admiration knew no bounds.
[43]

She lavished caresses on him without ceasing,
declaring that he was daily becoming
more and more fitted for the station which
would some day be his.

âYes, yes, the end cannot be far off now,â
she said one day as she sat in the headmasterâs
drawing-room, holding Herbertâs
hand in hers and patting it from time to
time in the fulness of her contentment.
âWho shall gainsay your claim when they see
you thus, my Herbertâs living image? my
son! My son, my lost unhappy son!â and in
a moment she was in a paroxysm of tears.

Herbert was quite accustomed to her
now. At first he had been dismayed by
her sudden outbursts. The rapid transition
from joy to sorrow, from smiles to hysterical
tears, were sufficient to frighten him,
and when to these were added her wild talk,
her bitter self-reproaches, her mysterious
[44]

hints of his coming greatness, he scarcely
knew what to do or say. But by degrees
he became familiar with her eccentricities,
and he felt that although she might be
queer, she was certainly uncommonly kind.

âI cannot control myself when I think
of the miserable past. But, please God, in
you I shall make some atonement for my
sins, and soon, soon,—for the time draws
nigh. You are equal, Herbert, I trust, to a
great and arduous trial?â

He was now nearly seventeen, tall and
well-built for his age; and as he shook his
light curls and looked steadily at her with
his clear, honest eyes, he seemed the incarnation
of youth and hope.

âI am game for anything, Lady Farrington,
only try me. Iâd face the whole
world if you asked me.â

âMy own brave boy! The struggle
[45]

may be sharp, but with such a spirit the
victory is certain to be ours.â

âWhen may I know what it is that I
have to do?â

âThe time draws nigh. It depends only
on you and your fitness to play your part.
You have not neglected your opportunities
I know. Dr. Jiggs gives you a high character.
You have profited by his studies,
you have learnt to ride and shoot, and
when you come to your own you will comport
yourself as an English gentleman
should.â

âI am a gentleman born, then?â

âOf the best,â she replied proudly.
âYou are—why conceal it longer? Here
you have for reasons been still known as
Herbert Larkins, my ward, but you are
really my grandson, the only child of Herbert,
my second boy. You are Sir Herbert
[46]

Farrington, the rightful heir of the family
honours of an old name and wide estates.â

âIs this certain, quite certain?â

âAbsolutely—at least to me. I have
never doubted from the first. My instinct
assured me I was right when I recognised
you in Triggertown. But as the world
needs more material proof I have sought
them out, and hold them now all but one.
This also I should have possessed had not
one person failed me.â

âWho was that?â

âMrs. Larkins. She alone can tell us
what we want to know, and she has most
unaccountably hesitated or refused to speak.
This is why I have broken with her—why
I have forbidden them to come and see you
again.â

These honest people had paid several
visits to Herbert at school, visits he had
[47]

received with delight. They had ceased
suddenly, and he had wondered greatly
thereat.

âBut if my mother—if Mrs. Larkins—â

âMrs. Larkins is not your mother, Herbert,
of that you may rest assured.â

âShe was as good as one to me always,
I know that. But if she is the only person
who can help us in this matter, was it prudent
to break with her altogether?â Herbert
asked very pertinently.

âI was annoyed, angry, and they were
proud—I will seek them out again. They
are necessary to us. Mrs. Larkins shall
speak, and we will proceed at once to establish
your claim. My patience is exhausted
and Rupertâs cup is full.â

This conversation occurred at a time
mentioned in a previous chapter when her
[48]

relations with Sir Rupert had become more
and more constrained. War had long been
imminent between them, but a rupture had
been precipitated by the overbearing harshness
of his ways. She had spoken, therefore,
a little rashly and prematurely perhaps, and
in doing so had shown her hand. She had
practically thrown down the glove, daring
him to do his worst. He accepted the challenge,
and acted with a promptitude and
determination for which the poor cracked-brained
old lady was certainly no match.

His first step was to put a watch upon
Lady Farringtonâs movements. Mr. Oozenam,
the well-known private detective, was
employed, who set about his task with his
usual skill and despatch. Within a week
or two he came with his first report.

âLady Farrington goes once every
month, often twice, to Deadham School, in
[49]

Essex. She has done so these five years
past and more.â

âOf course. The cub, her
protÃ©gÃ©
, is
there. Well?â

âA ward of her ladyshipâs, Herbert Larkins,
is at school there. He is now seventeen
years of age, is tall and well grown,
has fair curly hair and greyish blue eyes.
Her ladyship is said to take an immense
interest in him. Their interviews are long.
She must be very liberal to him; the lad
is always well provided with money which
he spends freely. He is a fair scholar, has
been taught especially to ride and shoot,
has learnt foreign languages and all extras.â

âThat is enough, Mr. Oozenam. You
have handsomely earned your fee.â

âIt has gone very far,â Sir Rupert said
to himself as soon as he was alone. âWhat
an idiot I have been not to have observed
[50]

her more closely! But let us hope it is not
too late even now.â

And then, after a long cogitation, he
called for his carriage, and driving first into
the neighbouring country town, where he
made one or two calls, he bade the coachman
next proceed to Farrington Court.

He asked for Lady Farrington, and was
in due course ushered into her private
boudoir.

âThe time has come, Lady Farrington,
as you were good enough to say some time
back—the time for plain speaking. I mean
to put an end to your tomfooleries once for
all. So long as they merely made you appear
ridiculous I could have borne with you,
although you scandalized our name. But
I cannot permit you to plot against me and
mine without protest and something more.â

âPlot?â she asked, in a voice which
[51]

anger and agitation combined to make
nearly inarticulate.

âI have discovered all. You have kept
your secret well, but I have found it out.
This base-born pretender—â

âHe is my own grandson. I have the
proofs.â

âThey will not bear the test of legal
scrutiny, you know that. On the contrary,
I can show that the whole affair is a conspiracy
from beginning to end. That this
Larkins is an adventurer—â

âYou will not harm him, surely? It is
I, only I, who am to blame.â

âI shall hand him over to the police,
prosecute him, and make him pay dearly
for his attempt to defraud.â

âYou would not dare,â she cried aghast.
Surprise and indignation combined to confuse
her mind, and she did not pause to
[52]

consider that he had no grounds of procedure;
that his threats were vain, and
could never be put into execution.

âI shall not spare him nor you.â

âThen you shall take the consequences.
I will proclaim you to be the villain that
you are; will tear you from your present
exalted station, and will send you back to
your former poverty and rags. You shall
be dispossessed. You shall disgorge the
rents and all that you have improperly
acquired. You—â

He merely laughed at her, mockingly
and rudely, which exasperated her beyond
all bounds.

âBegone, sir! You shall not remain
here another second to insult me. Begone!
or—â

He only laughed more loudly and mockingly
than before. Instantly her rage
[53]

passed into fury which seemed uncontrollable.

âBegone!â she cried again, snatching up
a sharp-pointed paper knife and rushing on
him with so much intention that Sir Rupert
precipitately retired. She followed him
downstairs with a wild shriek, little recking
how completely she was playing into
his hands.

The butler had just admitted several
other visitors, who heard and saw all that
passed. Sir Rupert went up to them apparently
for protection, but his first words
showed that he was eager for more than
this.

âGentlemen, you have arrived most opportunely.
You can see for yourselves.
It is clearly not safe to leave her any
longer at large.â

The butler had quelled poor Lady Farrington
[54]

almost instantly, but although he
held her back she was still furious and
foamed at the mouth.

âScarcely. We cannot refuse the certificate,â
said Mr. Burkinshaw, of Bootle, a
local magistrate and magnate. âSir Henry
quite agrees with me, and the doctors have
no manner of doubt. Poor woman, she
ought clearly to be put under restraint.â

And she was, without unnecessary delay.

Thus Herbert Larkins lost his protectress
just when his fortune seemed close at
hand. The cup was dashed away just before
he had lifted it to his lips, with consequences
which were by no means pleasant
to himself, as will be seen in the next
chapter.

[55]

CHAPTER IV.

TAKING THE SHILLING.

Herbert Larkins was in the class-room
when he was summoned to see a gentleman
who had called.

âI come from Lady Farrington,â said
his visitor, rather abruptly.

He was a tall, dark-eyed man, with a
sinister look upon his face.

âShe is well, I hope? Nothing has happened?
I half expected her to-day or to-morrow.â

âShe is well, but she cannot come here,
and wishes you to go to her at once. You
are aware, no doubt—â

âThe time then has arrived?â Herbert
said, a little incautiously.

[56]

âIt has arrived. You are ready, I presume?â

âI must speak to Dr. Jiggs. I cannot
leave the school without his permission, of
course.â

âThat is all arranged. When you have
got your belongings together, we will start.
You are not to return here. You know
that, I presume?â

âWe are going to join Lady Farrington?â

The visitor bowed assent.

An hour or two later they were in the
train and on the road to London.

There was little conversation between
them. Herbert was shy, and his companion
by no means talkative or sociable.

âWhere does Lady Farrington live?â
Herbert asked.

âYou really donât know?â

[57]

âShe never told me,â Herbert replied,
looking rather shamefaced.

âShe is a strange person, of that you
must be aware. It is impossible to account
for all she says and does.â

âShe has always been most kind to me,â
Herbert said, stoutly.

âNo doubt,â the other replied, drily.
âBut perhaps that was a form of eccentricity.
People are sometimes too affectionate
by half.â

Herbert would have liked some explanation
of this speech, but he could not
bring himself to ask for it. He only knew
that he began to dislike this man excessively,
and hoped they might never have
much to say to each other.

Arrived in London, they drove from
one terminus to another. Fresh tickets
were taken, for which his companion made
[58]

Herbert pay; and after a hasty meal at the
refreshment-room, they were again seated
in a railway carriage, travelling westward.
This second was a wearisome journey,
which continued far into the chill autumn
night. Towards nine they alighted at a
station, where their baggage was transferred
to a fly, into which they entered,
and were driven half-a-dozen miles or more.
At length they reached a small country inn,
had some supper, and were shown to their
rooms.

âRemember,â said his companion, as he
bade him good-night, âour affair is secret.
Keep your own counsel; do not gossip
with any one you may meet here. Lady
Farrington does not wish her name bandied
about; so mind you do not mention it
to a soul.â

Herbert slept late next morning, and
[59]

when he went downstairs he found himself
alone. The other gentleman had gone out,
they told him, and would not return till
late. Breakfast—what would he like? He
might like what he pleased, but all he
could get was cold bacon and bread, with
thin cider to drink. A school-boy has a fine
appetite, and is nowise particular. Herbert
enjoyed his breakfast, as he did also
his lunch and his dinner. He felt jolly
enough. He asked where he was, and they
told him Kingâs Staignton in Devonshire.
Was there anything to do in the place?
Yes, he might fish the trout stream, which
he did, very much to his own satisfaction,
and spent a thoroughly pleasant day.

But when night fell, and his companion
did not return, he began to feel the least
bit uneasy. He
ate his trout
, however,
and his bacon and bread, and slept the
[60]

sleep of the young, undismayed by fears of
to-morrow. To-morrow came, but no companion.
A third and a fourth day, and
Herbert was still alone. What could it
mean? He felt absolved from the necessity
of holding his tongue, and he asked
the landlady if she knew any one of the
name of Farrington in the country round
about. He was resolved to go to her ladyship
himself.

âNo, they had never heard the name
before.â

He now became more than puzzled.
He was filled with an inexplicable but increasing
dread of coming trouble, and he
was just beginning his preparations for returning
at once to Deadham, when the
absentee suddenly reappeared.

Herbert was young, inexperienced, and
terribly shy. But his was no craven spirit,
[61]

and he had enough of school-boy plain-speaking
frankness about him to say,

âCome, this is a fine lark. You would
not have kept me waiting here much
longer, I can tell you. I was just going to
cut and run.â

âYou may cut and run as soon as you
please,â said the other gruffly. âThe sooner
the better.â

âAnd what would Lady Farrington
say?â

âLady Farrington is not in a position
to say much.â

âI should like to see her.â

âYou canât. Sheâs gone off in a hurry.â

âShe never was here, or near here. I
know that much, for I have enquired.â

âYou broke through my instructions,
did you? Not that it matters much; and
it is time you should know all. Lady Farrington
[62]

has been put under restraint. You
do not understand? Locked up in an
asylum, I mean. She is mad, insane; and
of all her ravings, the wildest were those
which led you to suppose you were somebody,
instead of a beggarâs brat picked up
out of the mire.â

âThat Iâm not, Iâll swear, and no one
shall call me so,â cried Herbert, hotly. He
looked so fierce, with his clenched fists,
broad shoulders, and light active figure,
that the man for the moment was cowed.

âI donât know who you are, or where
you came from. But youâre not what you
think you are, nor what Lady Farrington
has made you believe. That is enough for
me.â

âI have her word.â

âThat of a mad woman!â

âAnd she has proofs.â

[63]

âWhich exist only in her own distraught
brain.â

âThat remains to be seen. But who are
you? Why are you so bitter against me?
Why did you bring me here?â

âI am Sir Rupert Farrington. It is I
whom this mad old lady wishes to wrong.
She has been seeking what she calls a rightful
heir all these years—only that she may
dispossess me. You are not the first pretender
she has set up. But I think it is
not unlikely you will be the last.â

Had he brought Herbert there to injure
him? The thought suddenly flashed across
the young manâs mind. But then there
were other people at the inn; the landlady,
ostlers, keepers, police not far off, none of
these would knowingly suffer any foul play
to be done.

âI defy you and your threats,â said Herbert.
[64]

âIf I am in a false position it was
none of my seeking, but I prefer to believe
Lady Farrington rather than you. There
are others who know of my claims, and
with their help I shall yet put them forward
as you will see.â

Sir Rupert snapped his fingers at him.
âHow do you propose to live meanwhile?
Remember you can get nothing from Lady
Farrington now. You cannot go back to
the school; I brought you all this way on
purpose that you should not. Besides, I
have written to Dr. Jiggs to put him on
his guard.â

âHe would still help me if I asked him;
but I do not need to do that.â

âYou cannot have money hoarded?
That would be very unlike a school-boy.
You must be nearly cleaned out by this
time. I made you pay your own expenses
[65]

on purpose; and there will be the bill here.
You ought to be nearly penniless. You
will have to remain here, and turn farm
labourer or starve.â

âI shall not do that, you may depend.
I have been well educated, thanks to Lady
Farrington. I am not afraid of work, and
I am well able to take care of myself. At
any rate I look to you for nothing, and all
I wish now is to get away from you and
this place.â

Herbert called for his bill, paid it with
his last sovereign, asked the way to the
nearest railway station—Newton Abbot—and
started off on foot, determined to get
back to London as soon as he could.
Thence he would find his way to Triggertown.
The Larkins were the only friends
left in the world; and Mrs. Larkins, as
[66]

Lady Farrington had said, was the person
who possessed the only link wanting in the
chain of proofs which was to establish his
claims.

At Newton Abbot he sold his watch,
and had money for his ticket to London
and to spare. Parting with other articles
of his apparel to supply his necessities upon
the road, he found himself at Triggertown
upon the third day. How familiar the
place seemed! Six years since he left it—a
child, and now returning as a man he
found everything unchanged. He passed
up the covered way, across the drawbridge
under the arch, and stood at the door of
the casemate, expecting next moment to
see the sergeant and Mrs. Larkins, and the
whole of the brood.

But it was a stranger who came to
answer his knock; a small vixenish woman
[67]

with a shrewish tongue. She gave him a
very short answer.

âLarkinses? They donât stop here. Been
gone these years. Where? How do I
know? They got the route right enough;
thatâs all I can tell you.â

âWas there no one in the barracks who
could tell him?â Herbert asked.

âNo,â said the woman, abruptly, and
shut the door in his face.

The sentry would not let him pass the
inner gates. The gate sergeant, who came
up, peremptory and consequential, was still
more inhospitable. Whom did Herbert
want? A barrack sergeant of the name of
Larkins? There was no such name in the
garrison.

âBetter write to the Secretary of State
for War, my man,â said the gate sergeant
with gruff condescension, âor to the Archbishop
[68]

of Canterbury. Oneâs as likely to
tell you as another. But you must clear
out of this. Canât have no loiterers about
here. Themâs my orders. May be the
adjutant or the sergeant-majorâll come this
way, and I donât choose to be blamed for
you.â

âWhat regiment do you belong to?â
asked Herbert.

âCanât you see for yourself?â Where
could this young man have been raised not
to recognise the uniform of the Dukeâs
Own Fusiliers?

âIs it a good corps?â

The sergeant was aghast at the fellowâs
impudence. Like every soldier of the old
school, he had been brought up to believe
that his regiment was not only a good one,
but the very best in the service.

[69]

âGâlong; I want no more truck with
you. Clear out, or youâll be put out.â

âWhatâs your colonelâs name? I want
to see him.â

âYou canât want to see him if you donât
know his name.â

âI do, though, on business.â

âPretty business! A tramp like you
canât have no business here at all, much
less with the colonel or any other officer of
ours.â

âWonât you pass me in?â

âI wonât, there, thatâs flat.â

âAll right; Iâll wait till some one comes
out.â

Herbert coolly seated himself a little
way down upon the slope of the glacis. If
the sergeant meant to dislodge him it could
only be by force.

The fact was our hero was meditating a
[70]

serious step. The disappointment of not
finding his old friends where he had left
them was great. He had perhaps overrated
the assistance which Mrs. Larkins could
give him in substantiating his claims, but
he had looked for advice from them as to
the disposal of his immediate future. How
was he now, unknown and seemingly without
a friend in the world, to find employment?
That was the serious question he
was called upon to solve, and that without
unnecessary delay. His pockets were
empty, his clothes—such as he had not
pawned—had reached that stage of irretrievable
seediness which clothes worn uninterruptedly
for weeks will always assume.
He might or might not be the heir of the
Farringtons. What did it matter who he
was or might be if he died of starvation
before he could prove his case?

[71]

These wholesome reflections led him to
accept the only means of livelihood which
offered just then. He would enlist. Why
not? He had been brought up within
sound of the drum; his earliest recollections
and associations were connected with
the barrack. The life might be rough compared
to the luxury of Deadham, but at
least he would be fed, clothed and housed,
and he need not stand still. The theory of
the marshalâs baton, which every knapsack
is said to contain, is not exactly supported
by fact in the British Army, but times
were not what they had been, and he might
now hope to rise rapidly enough. Yes, he
would take the shilling and join the Dukeâs
Own Fusiliers.

These were the words he addressed to
the first officer who issued from the gates.

It happened to be the adjutant himself.
[72]

Mr. Wheeler was the beau ideal of a smart
young soldier, quick and energetic in
movement, with an eagle eye to take in the
âpointsâ of a possible recruit.

âWant to enlist, do you? Hey, what,
what, what? Where do you come from?
Wonât say, I suppose? Where do you belong
to? Donât know, of course. Whatâs
your age? You wonât tell the truth.
Height? we can see to that. Health? are
you sound in wind and limb? hey, what,
what, what?â

All this time he had been appraising
Herbertâs value, had noted his broad shoulders,
thin flanks, his seventy-two inches,
and his erect bearing, as keenly as though
he were a slave merchant about to turn
a penny on a deal. The scrutiny was
satisfactory. The medical examination confirmed
it, the nearest magistrate sanctioned
[73]

the enlistment, and before sundown, Herbert
Larkins had joined the Dukeâs Own
and had sworn to serve Her Majesty and
her heirs for a term of years.

By a strange coincidence, within a week
or two, Ernest Farrington, Sir Rupertâs
only son, was gazetted to the same regiment,
and the two young men presently
found themselves in the same squad at recruitâs
drill.

[74]

CHAPTER V.

A CRACK CORPS.

The Dukeâs Own Fusiliers had the credit
of being one of the most distinguished regiments
in the service of the Queen. Its
colours were emblazoned with the victories
in which it had shared; its mess plate was
rich in gifts from the great captains and
men of mark who had held commissions in
its ranks. It considered itself in every respect
a crack corps, and held its head high
always on account of its thorough efficiency
and undeniably âgood form.â Its claims
to the latter could not be denied; but
its rights to the former were sometimes
questioned by keen-eyed critics and
[75]

people behind the scenes. The regiment
no doubt turned out smartly upon
parade; it always looked well, and was
fairly well-behaved. But there were flaws
and short-comings in its system, hidden a
little below the surface, which in the crucial
test of emergency would probably be laid
bare. The gulf between officers and men
was a little too wide; inferiors had no great
confidence in those above them, the latter
were generally indifferent, taking but little
interest in their business, as though soldiering
was not their profession, but a chance
employment to fill up their hours when not
otherwise engaged.

A certain Colonel Prioleau commanded
the regiment at the time when Herbert
Larkins enlisted into it; a soldier of the
old school, at times fussy, testy, and sharp-spoken,
but really a good-natured easy-going
[76]

man. He was without much strength of
character however, and not over-burthened
with brains. It was not strange, therefore,
that he should suffer his authority to slip a
little out of his own hands. He was far
from supreme in the body of which he was
the ostensible head. English regiments are
very variously governed. This is ruled by
the sergeant-major, that by the colonelâs
wife; in another, the general of the brigade
or district, with his staff-officers, works his
own wicked will. Some are, so to speak,
self-governed, and the Dukeâs Own was one
of these. In it, the will of the body corporate,
of the officers banded together like
a joint-stock company, and trading under
the name of âthe regimentâ was absolute
law. By and for âthe regiment,â everything
was settled and decided. The regimental
idea was a species of impalpable but all-pervading
[77]

essence, which no one could resist.
To quote regimental custom; to invoke
regimental prestige; to talk of the credit of
the regiment; to insist upon the maintenance
of
esprit de corps
, were so many irresistible
appeals, so many precepts of a
powerful unwritten code universally accepted,
and admitted to be binding upon
all. In its highest form, this thorough-going
devotion might be productive, as
indeed it has often proved to be, of extraordinary
good; but it was possible to develop
it in the wrong direction, and this
was to some extent the case with the
Dukeâs Own Fusiliers. It was generally
understood in the regiment that its credit
depended less upon its military proficiency
than upon the dash it cut in the
world.

Military matters, in fact, were not held
[78]

in the highest esteem in the Dukeâs Own.
Nobody cared much about them. They
were left to be managed by anybody, anyhow.
Now and again Colonel Prioleau
raised a feeble protest, but nobody listened
to him or cared. He was told that the
regiment wished this, or thought that, and
he immediately succumbed. Those next
senior to him, his two majors, were of little
assistance to him in driving the coach.
One, Major Diggle, of whom more directly,
did not pretend to be a soldier at all. According
to his own ideas, he was always
much better engaged. The other, Major
Byfield, had, unfortunately, been raised in
another regiment, and was so unpopular
that he was worse than a cipher; the Dukeâs
Own knew too well what was due to itself
to allow an outsider to dictate to it or interfere
in its affairs. The only person who did
[79]

anything in the regiment was the adjutant,
and he had come by degrees to monopolise
the whole of the power. The colonel
gave in to him more and more, till presently
he abdicated his functions to him
altogether. After all, Mr. Wheeler was a
smart young gentleman, not without military
aptitudes. He had no dread of responsibility,
and having a fair knowledge of the
red-books and routine, disposed of his work
daily in an airy off-hand fashion which was
always refreshing, and which, in the face of
any serious difficulty, would have been absolutely
sublime. He pulled all the strings,
decided all the moot points, gave all orders,
drafted all letters, which his humble slave,
the colonel, obediently signed; it was he,
practically, who manÅuvred the battalion,
although his puppet, the colonel, nominally
gave the word of command. It saved everybody
[80]

else a great deal of trouble. The
men perhaps were not quite as well cared
for and commanded as they ought to have
been, the sergeants looking to the adjutant
rather than to their officers, sometimes exceeded
their powers, and carried matters
with rather a high hand. Complaints of
tyranny and ill-usage, however, seldom
cropped up, and no suspicion ever arose
that the condition of the regiment was
otherwise than perfectly sound.

It was not difficult to understand why
the officers as a body rather neglected their
duties. They were too fully occupied in
maintaining the credit of the regiment according
to their own interpretation of the
phrase. This meant that it should be renowned—not
for marching and manÅuvres,
for demeanour, discipline, and drill—but for
its ostentation and display, for the grand
[81]

balls and entertainments it gave, for its mess
perfectly appointed, its artistic
chefs
, its exquisite
wines. It was for the credit of the
regiment that it should keep up a regimental
drag, a cricket and lawn tennis club,
and give weekly afternoon teas; that during
the season six or seven at least of the Dukeâs
Own should turn out in scarlet to hunt with
the nearest hounds, that some one amongst
their number should take a shooting or a
river, which the regimental sportsmen might
honour in turn; that half the regiment at
least should rush up to town from Friday
to Monday every week, and enjoy themselves
in loafing about the park and the
Burlington Arcade, or idling away the
hours at the club, and devoutly wishing
they were back at their own regimental
mess.

These high-flown ideas very rapidly developed
[82]

into extravagant tastes, which had
reached their highest point about the time
when Herbert Larkins became one of the
Dukeâs Own. The regiment had only returned
a year or two previously from a
lengthened tour of foreign service, and after
their long exile in outer darkness everyone
with any spirit or capacity for enjoyment
had been resolved to take his pleasure to
the full. It was expected of the officers of
the Dukeâs Own to come well to the front,
and this they pretended was a more potent
inducement to them to spend money than
any hankering after personal gratification.
So, with but few exceptions, they launched
forth freely enough. It was, with many, a
case of the earthen pots swimming with the
brass; but all, or nearly all, were determined
to do their duty to the regiment and go the
pace, or as Mr. Crouch, the sporting quartermaster
[83]

styled it, âgo to the devil hands
down.â What if any serious financial crisis
supervened? Their people would have to
stump up; their fathers—probably by drawing
upon a wifeâs provision or daughterâs
portion, and always by impoverishing themselves—would
pay their debts, but they
would have had âa high old time,â and the
imperishable credit of the Dukeâs Own Fusiliers
would have been most brilliantly maintained.

The leading spirit and showman of the
regiment at this particular epoch was the
junior major Cavendish-Diggle. Diggle was,
in his way, a man of parts, young, pushing,
ambitious, passably rich. No one knew
exactly where he came from, or who were
his belongings or his people. One of his
patronymics was decidedly patrician, the
other as unmistakeably commonplace. He
[84]

might be a cousin of the Duke of Devonshire;
and again he might not. When anyone
asked him the question—and it was one
he liked to have put to him—he smiled
pleasantly, and said that the Cavendishes
were all related, as everybody knew. But
he was not so well pleased when people,
envious or cynical, or both, remarked casually
that Diggle was the name of the great grocers
in Cheapside. There was no connection on
that side of course, but the allusion was far
from agreeable to him, as a shrewd observer
might have noticed from his face and his
avowed hostility to anyone who dared to
make the remark.

There were not many who were bold
enough to attack him however. He could
hold his own always. Nature had endowed
him with a good presence and abundance of
self-confidence; he could talk well, had a
[85]

good voice, and was an excellent
raconteur
.
These gifts were naturally of great service
to him; not alone for purposes of repartee
and self-defence; they were also exceedingly
useful in assisting him to obtain that
social success which had ever been one of
the principal aims of his life. In his boyhood,
when he had made his
dÃ©but
as a
second lieutenant in the Dukeâs Own Fusiliers,
he had had an uphill game to play.
The regiment was then, as it still aspired to
be, eminently aristocratic, and no one was
disposed to welcome a Diggle with rapturous
effusion. There was nothing against the
lad, however, except the possible obscurity
of his origin; on the contrary, there was
much in his favour. He was modest and
unpretending, fully impressed with the
âgreatnessâ of âthe regimentâ he had joined,
falling down readily to worship the principal
[86]

personages who were its idols at the time.
He sought to attach himself to one or two
of the most distinguished cadets of noble
houses, who were nobodies at home, but
made a good deal of in the Dukeâs Own.
Diggleâs hero worship, accompanied as it
was by a willingness to bet, play
Ã©cartÃ©
, and
do good turns to his superiors—he thought
them so himself—met with its reward, and
he soon found himself in the position to
enjoy the daily companionship and friendship
of one or two baronets and several
lordsâ sons. It was long, however, before
he advanced himself beyond the rather
undignified status of a âhanger-on.â His
friends and comrades were very affectionate—with
the regiment—but they were not so
fond of him in town; nor did they help him
into society, or get him invitations to their
homes. But as time passed, and he gained
[87]

promotion and seniority, his persistent
efforts gradually achieved a certain success.
He now took a prominent part in regimental
entertainments, was willing to accept all
the drudgery of managing balls and parties,
because he thus came more to the front.
At one rather dull country station he struck
out the happy idea of giving dances on his
account in his own quarters, which happened
to be large, and at his own expense,
and this gained for him great popularity in
the neighbourhood. It was about this time
that he began to lay much stress upon the
Cavendish prefix to his proper name; he
always called himself Cavendish-Diggle,
had it so put in the
Army List
and upon his
cards. Then the regiment went on foreign
service, and while stationed in an out-of-the-way
colony, he had the good fortune to
be selected to act upon the personal staff of
[88]

the governor and commander-in-chief. He
turned this appointment to excellent account.
He was soon the life and soul of
Government House, developing at once into
a species of diplomatic major-domo, who
was simply indispensable to his chief. In
this way he made many new and valuable
friends; a young royalty on his travels,
who was charmed with Captain Cavendish-Diggleâs
devotion to his person; several
heirs apparent also, and itinerant legislators,
who took Barataria in their journey
round the world, and who could not be too
grateful for all he did for them, or too profuse
in their promises of civilities whenever
he might be in England. All this bore fruit
in the long run, when the regiment returned.
He experienced many disappointments,
no doubt; for your notable on his
travels, so cordial and so gushing, is apt to
[89]

give you the cut direct if you meet him in
his own hunting-grounds, at home. Still
there were some did not quite forget the
hospitable and obliging A.D.C.; and Major
Cavendish-Diggle, at the invitation of one,
went into Norfolk to shoot; of another to
Scotland to fish; in the London season he
found several houses open to him; and he
was finally raised to a pinnacle of satisfaction
by Royal commands to attend a garden
party and a court ball.

In the Dukeâs Own he was now a very
great personage indeed. As both the
Colonel and Major Byfield were married he
was the senior member of the mess; always
its most prominent figure; the chief host in
all impromptu parties at home; the great
man at all entertainments abroad. He had
now a following of his own; a band of personal
adherents who imitated him in his
[90]

dress and talk and ways, who deferred to
him, flattered him, and admired him fully
as much as he had the shining lights around
which he had himself revolved when he was
young. This homage did not do him any
great good. It confirmed him in the high
opinion he had formed of himself: it indorsed
and justified his aspirations, which
were now by no means unambitious,
although very carefully concealed. Why
should he not make a brilliant marriage?
There were plenty of heiresses about; if he
could but find one in whom the charms of
blood and beauty were united, why should
he not go in and win? He was still comparatively
young; he had kept his figure;
he was
rÃ©pandu
in the best society and
appreciated wherever he went. Who
should have a better chance? And what
might he not achieve in the way of future
[91]

distinction with a rich and well-born wife
to help him in climbing the tree?

These ideas had been uppermost in his
mind for some time past. It was in obedience
to them that he had been at some
pains to inform himself whether any likely

partis
were running loose about Triggertown
or in the country round. But he
had so far met with little success. Hopshire
is a county owning many families of antiquity
and repute, but none were especially
renowned for their wealth. Diggle would
have gone further afield and commenced
his chase in London, or at one of the great
watering places, but he wished first to exhaust
the resources of the neighbourhood.
The gay major was not wrong in supposing
that he showed off to the best advantage
upon his own territory, doing the honours
of his own mess, backed up and supported
[92]

by so many brilliant comrades and disciples.
Just when he began to despair of finding
any young lady who from substantial reasons
was entitled to receive his addresses,
he came across the Farringtons. They lived
at the other end of the county. There was
a daughter in the house—a very charming
girl, he thought, who, having one brother
only and no sisters, would assuredly be
well portioned. This led him to consolidate
his acquaintance with Sir Rupert, to
accept many invitations and pay frequent
visits to Farrington Hall.

It was entirely through his advice
and intervention that Sir Rupert sent
young Ernest into the Dukeâs Own. The
regiment would probably remain at Triggertown
for a year or two longer, and this
would break Lady Farrington gradually to
the separation from her beloved son. Besides,
[93]

Major Cavendish-Diggle would have
the young fellow especially under his wing—a
precious advantage no doubt, as we
shall presently see.

[94]

CHAPTER VI.

IN THE BARRACK-ROOM.

Within twenty-four hours of his arrival in
barracks, Herbert Larkins was bathed,
cropped, clothed, numbered, and, so to
speak, put away. His ârags,â in plain English,
his civilian clothes—invariably so
called whether undeniable garments or
veritable rags—had been exchanged for
uniform, such as it was. A recruit, and
especially in the fall of the year, when the
annual issue of new clothing is near at
hand, gets only things âpart worn.â So
Herbertâs shell jacket, his regimental trousers,
and his ammunition boots, were all of
them palpable misfits.

He said as much to the corporal of the
[95]

pioneers, who helped the quartermaster-sergeant
in rigging out recruits.

âToo large?â replied the corporal, contemptuously.
âWait till youâre at the extension
motions, or at club drill, and youâll
wish they were more than twice as big.â

âBut my trousers are too long, and—â

âItâll be longer before you get another
pair. Besides, you ainât done growing yet.
Two months on full rations, and youâll be
as tall as a hop-pole. How do you think
your legs âd look then? Showing half a
yard of sock above the high-lows, and the
captain âd be safe to put you down for a
new pair of bags.â

âAnd these boots are far too loose. I
canât feel the sides even.â

âYouâll feel something else afore long, I
can tell you, and not half so soft as leather.
Them boots! Why, flash Alick Nokes wore
[96]

them till he went âoutâ—and it âd take a
dozen Johnny Raws like you to make half
a soldier such as him.â

Yet Herbert had really some reason to
be discontented with his personal appearance.
Always a trim and dapper youth,
his patroness, Lady Farrington, had loved
to see him neatly dressed, and had cheerfully
paid his tailorâs bills when at Deadham
school. But now, speaking exactly, he was
not dressed at all; his figure was only concealed
with clothes. His jacket was baggy
at the back; the arms were so long that
the cuffs came as far as his knuckles; his
trousers, if they had been tied in at the
ankle, would have suited a Janissary Turk;
his forage-cap—it was before the days of
smart glengarries—not yet âblockedâ and
set up, fell like a black pudding-bag, over
one forehead and one ear. His boots were
[97]

quite amorphous, quite without form, and
they might have been void were it not probable
they encased a pair of feet shaped like
wedges of Cheshire cheese. So deteriorating
was the effect of these incongruous
habiliments, that Herbert Larkins seemed
to lose his erect bearing and springy step;
and as he reached the barrack-room, to
which he was presently marched, carrying
his kit-bag full of cleaning utensils under
one arm, and his new knapsack under the
other, he hung his head and looked utterly
ashamed of himself.

âOh! itâs you is it?â said the sergeant in
charge of the room, who took him over from
the corporal of the pioneers.

Herbert recognised the sergeant with
whom he had had the colloquy at the barrack-gate.

âSo you got past the gate, did you?
[98]

Mind you stop, now youâve got in. Donât try
and run off again with your bounty and kit.â

The suspicious sergeant scented a probable
deserter.

âI shouldnât have come in if Iâd wanted
to go out directly afterwards,â Herbert
plucked up courage to say; but the scene
was so new, and he felt so forlorn in his
loneliness and his strange new clothes, that
he had not much spirit left in him.

âDonât answer me with cheek,â cried the
sergeant, very sharply. âI want none of
your slack jaw or back jaw. Hold your
tongue, thatâs what youâve got to do, and
do as youâre bid.â

âNow look here,â he went on, after a
pause; âthereâs your bed, and thatâs your
shelf; mind you keep them clean and proper.
Donât you try to lie down on the one
before the right time, nor put what ainât
[99]

authorised on the other. Youâll be for
recruitsâ drill at six sharp to-morrow; donât
let me have to tell you twice to turn out,
and mind you donât get straying away so
that you canât answer your name at tattoo
roll-call to-night. Mind, too, what your
comrade says; Iâll tell you off to Boy Hanlon
because youâre much of an age; mind
him and what he tells you, and heâll keep
you straight. Ladsâ—this to the room—âhave
any of you seen âthe Boyâ?â

âNo, sergeant, not these hours past.
Heâs in the usual place, Iâll go bail.â

âThe canteen?â

Some of the men laughed and nodded,
and the sergeant went off in search.

No one took any notice of Herbert, as
he sat upon the edge of his iron cot at the
far end of the room. Everybody seemed
busy with his own affairs.

[100]

But presently some one near the door
shouted, âWhy, hereâs âthe Boyâ! Dukeâs
Own! ââTchun,ââ giving the word of command
as though an officer was approaching.

It was only a wizened little man, who
might have been fifty or barely five. He
hadnât a hair on his fresh coloured cheeks,
but they were much wrinkled as though he
were prematurely aged.

Boy Hanlon was one of the oldest soldiers
in the regiment. He had been in it
all his life from the time they had picked
him up like a waif or stray on the line of
march between Exeter and Plymouth till
now, when he had upwards of twenty yearsâ
service, and was growing grey-haired. He
had begun as a boy in the band, thence he
went to the drums; by-and-bye he became
a bugler, from which, although barely of
[101]

the standard height, he had been passed
into the ranks. Now, as a veteran who
knew his rights and what was due to himself,
he gave himself great airs. No one
was half so well acquainted as he was with
professional topics. He could tell you the
names of all the officers past and present,
in the Dukeâs Own; he was a keen critic
upon drill from his own point of view—somewhere
in the rear rank of one of
the central companies; he could pipeclay
belts to perfection, and had not his equal
with brass ball, heel ball, boot-blacking,
button stick and brush. But the chief
source of his pride were his confidential
relations with Colonel Prioleau, the present
commanding officer. The two had âsoldieredâ
together all these years, in every clime, and
knew each other thoroughly. More, they
had stood side by side at the battle of Goojerat,
[102]

where the Dukeâs Own had fought
remarkably well, and they were the only
two survivors of that glorious day. âBoyâ
Hanlon—he got his soubriquet of course
from his insignificant size—traded a good
deal on that battle of Goojerat. He was
perpetually celebrating the victory. For
one single battle it had an extraordinary
number of anniversaries. Whenever âthe
Boyâ was thirsty—and with him drought
was perennial—he turned up at the orderly
room and told the colonel it was a fine
morning âfor the day.â

âWhat day?â old Prioleau would ask
with pretended ignorance, although he
knew and really enjoyed the joke.

âThe great day, of course, colonel; the
day of Goojerat.â

âWhy, it was that only three weeks
ago; surely—â

[103]

âWell, sir, weâre the only two Goojeraties
left, you know, sir, and Iâd like to
drink your health.â

It always ended in the same way—the
transfer of half-a-crown from the colonel to
âthe Boy;â the speedy exchange of the whole
sum into liquor, the most potent description
preferred, a free fight, for âthe Boyâ was
quarrelsome in his cups, a temporary relegation
to the guard-room, from which he
was sure to be immediately released by the
officer of the day. When Hanlon misconducted
himself he always got off scot free.
Colonel Prioleau would never punish âthe
Boy.â

âWhereâs my towney?â Hanlon asked
directly he entered the room.

They pointed to where Herbert sat disconsolate;
and the dapper little soldier, who
was still trim in figure, and straight as a
[104]

dart, walked over to the lad and gave him
a friendly pat on the back.

âNow, young chap, you must brush up,
brush up, and show yourself a man. Weâve
to be comrades, you and I, and it wonât
suit me to consort with a chap as is given
to peek and pine. What do you call yourself?â

This was delicately put. Recruits do
not always enlist under their own names;
so Hanlon asked, not what Herbert was
called, but what he called himself.

âHerbert Larkins.â

âGood; and not a bad looking chap
either. Too tall—leastwise Iâm afraid
youâre going to grow—â

Hanlon, like many little men, hated those
whose inches far exceeded his own. In the
days when there had been grenadiers, it
was his favourite pastime, when at all the
[105]

worse for liquor, to beard the giants in
their own barrack-room. He called them
âhop-poles,â âsand-bags,â âwooden ramrods,â
and other opprobrious names, and his onslaughts
generally ended in his being carried,
bodily, to the guard-room, under some
stalwart soldierâs arm. Now that the grenadier
company was abolished, he disseminated
his dislike, and abused every private
who was more that five feet six in
height.

âToo tall, unless you stop as you are.
Gin perhapsâd do it; or whiskey; or perhaps
âfourâ ale—if you took enough of it. Fond
of âfourâ ale, eh?â

Hanlonâs eyes glistened with a toperâs
joy as he mentioned his favourite fluid.

âAh! thereâs nothing like âfourâ ale.
Iâm under stoppages myself,â he went on, meditatively,
âor Iâd stand treat. But youâll
[106]

have got your bounty, and the money for
your âcolouredâ clothes. You ainât got
the price of a glass about you?â

Herbert admitted readily enough that
he had the price of several. He had lost
none of his schoolboy freehandedness, and
he had moreover the wit to see that his new
comrade might, if propitiated, prove an uncommonly
useful friend.

Hanlon first made Herbert swallow
some piping hot tea which was brought in
just then, and gave him the whole of his
âteaâ bread; Hanlonâs own appetite was indifferent;
and then the two, amid the
winks and jeers of the rest, strolled over to
the canteen. The place was not over full.
Nothing stronger than ale and porter could
be sold in it, and the Dukeâs Own generally
preferred the Triggertown taverns. So
would Hanlon, but he knew that a newly
[107]

enlisted recruit would not be permitted to
leave barracks.

They had a quart âof the best;â Hanlon
called for it—and drank it, all but a glass;
a second quart followed, and a third; and
as the little veteran became more and more
steeped in liquor he grew more and more
communicative. He told Herbert all about
the regiment; who were the chief personages
in it; he spoke with awe of the sergeant-major,
but of the colonel as a familiar
friend. He described the ways of the officers,
the habits and customs of the regiment,
the chances there were of promotion
for a smart lad whoâd had any schooling
and knew how to keep himself straight.
âCan you read? good—and write? better
still. If you can only cipher and do accounts
you wonât have long to wait for a
lance stripe. Iâll get it for you, aye and
[108]

more too. Iâll get you put in the orderly-room
as a clerk, or perhaps the pay office.
You shall be a colour-sergeant before youâre
many years older; who knows, perhaps
youâll be sergeant-major afore you die. All
through Joe Hanlon; poor old Joe Hanlon—Letshavesmoreale.â

From Hanlon drunk to Hanlon sober
there was a great distance. The big promises
he made so freely in his cups were
all of them forgotten next day. Yet the
little man was, in his way, a good friend to
Herbert Larkins. In the days, arduous
and often wearisome, of the recruitâs novitiate,
the old soldier acted always as
mentor and adviser. He taught Herbert
all he knew. He helped him with his exercises,
rehearsing the manual and platoon
in the privacy of the citadel ditch, so that
Herbert soon won especial favour with the
[109]

drill instructor of his squad; he took a
pride in Herbertâs personal appearance,
arranged a âswopâ for the misfitting jacket
and highlows, contracted with one of the
regimental tailors to alter the baggy trousers
in his spare hours.

âIâll make you the smartest soldier in
the Dukeâs Own,â said âthe Boyâ enthusiastically.
âYouâre the right stuff; youâve got
it in you; youâre a soldier born, every inch.
I donât ask no questions. I donât want to
know who you are, or where you comes
from, but youâve got soldierâs blood in you;
you come of a soldierâs stock, Iâll wager a
gallon of the best four ale. I like you, lad.
Youâre free handed and open spoken, and
youâve got an honest mug of your own. I
like you, and Iâll stick to you through thick
and thin.â

The advantages of Boy Hanlonâs counsel
[110]

and protection were soon apparent. Herbert,
thanks to Hanlonâs coaching, but
aided not a little by his own native intelligence,
and the excellent education he had
received, proved an apt scholar in the military
school. He soon learnt his drill, and
was passed for duty much more quickly
than was usually the case with recruits.
Mr. Farrington, who had commenced drill
at the same time, but who enjoyed the
officerâs privilege of taking it easy, and who
was somewhat slow of apprehension to
boot, was still at company drill when
Private Larkins, fully accoutred, and admirably
âturned out,â took his place in the
ranks on guard, mounting parade.

It was with a beating heart that he
found Mr. Wheeler, the adjutant, in making
his minute and critical inspection, pause
just in front of him.

[111]

âFall out,â said the adjutant curtly; and
Herbert scarcely knew whether to expect
praise or blame.

âColonelâs orderly. Report yourself at
his quarters after parade.â

Here was an honour indeed! To be
selected on his first guard-mounting parade,
as commanding officerâs orderly—a post
which, apart from the privileges it brought
of immunity from âsentry goâ and a sure
nightâs rest in bed, every private soldier in
the regiment coveted and esteemed—was a
compliment which Herbert, and Hanlon
also, appreciated to the full.

What befell the young orderly at Colonel
Prioleauâs quarters must be reserved
for another chapter.

[112]

CHAPTER VII.

A FRENCH LESSON.

Herbert Larkins presented himself with
some trepidation at the commanding officerâs
quarters, a house outside, but not far from
the barracks. The hall door was wide open,
but he did not go in. The man whom he
relieved told him âto patrol up and down in
front of the house—that was all he had
to do.â

This he did religiously for half an hour
or more, and then he heard himself called
from within.

âOrderly!â A clear, sweet voice it was;
very musical in its intonation and very
different from the gruff accents to which he
had most recently been accustomed.

[113]

âOrderly!â again; this time much more
sharply spoken, and with undoubted petulance.
âHow stupid! Why donât you
come when youâre called?â and then the
owner of the voice appeared. Mahomet had
come to the mountain.

A bright-faced beautiful child; a fair
golden-haired girl, not yet in her teens,
wearing a fresh pink and white frock, with
pink ribbons in her sunny locks, and a pink
silk handkerchief tied like a shawl over her
shoulders and neck. Herbert took it all in
at a glance, and remembered the picture for
the rest of his life.

A very imperious young person, evidently;
she had honest kindly eyes, but her
small nose slightly âtip tilted,â and the upward
curve of scorn in her lip indicated a
proud, haughty nature, and the wilfulness
of one who, though still a child, had everything
[114]

always her own way. An only child,
born late in their married life, Edith Prioleau
ruled languid mother and doting father
with a despotism against which they had
neither the inclination nor power to protest.

âAre you the orderly?â she asked, almost
stamping her foot.

âYes.â

âYes? Yes—what?â

âYes, I am.â

âYes,
Miss
, you should say when you
speak to me. Do you know who
I
am? I
am the colonelâs daughter.â

Whereat Herbert drew himself up, and
saluted her formally with hand to cap, as
though she were the commander-in-chief.

âYouâre only a recruit, I suppose?â She
spoke quite contemptuously. âI never saw
you before. I donât like strangers. I shall
[115]

speak to Mr. Wheeler about it. How long
have you been dismissed drill?â

Herbert smiled at her intimate acquaintance
with military details, and the smile
seemed to give her fresh annoyance.

âYouâre a rude soldier. You shanât
come as orderly again. But hereâ—she
remembered what she wanted—âtake this
list to the barrack library; be quick, please,
and bring me all those books. I want them
at once, please, all. You understand? At
once, and all; and when you come back
bring them in to me—there in the back
room.â

âEdith!â said another voice just then,
faintly and querulously, âyou are losing the
whole morning. Your French—â

âOh, bother!â cried Edith, and retired,
dragging one foot after the other, as though
loth to return to her studies.

[116]

Herbert executed his commission
promptly enough, and presently returned
laden with books—some, but not all, of
those for which Edith had sent. He carried
them straight into the back room.

âI am sorry to say, miss, that the âLoss
of the Wagerâ is out, and so is Maxwellâs
âStories of Waterloo,â but I have brought
you âThaddeus of Warsawâ and the âRomance
of War.ââ

Then he stopped short, for he saw that
the young lady was not attending to him in
the least. Her head was buried in her
hands, and when she eventually looked up
her eyes were suffused with tears.

âOh, dear, it is so hard. I canât make
head or tail of it.â

It was only a French exercise after all,
about which there was all this coil. But
Edith was not an industrious scholar. In
[117]

plain English, she hated books, and would
any day throw them aside to get on her
pony to scamper across the Hopshire downs,
or ride out to the drill-field with her father,
or to stand by at band practice, or accompany
the regiment when it marched out.

âI know a little French,â said Herbert
diffidently; âperhaps I can help?â

Edith stared at him through her tears.
A private soldier know French! More,
probably, than she knew herself! The
notion filled her with amazement—with
gratitude, perhaps, but also with chagrin.

But when, after a few minutesâ close
application, he untied the terrible knot,
gratitude overpowered all other sentiments,
and she could have shaken hands with him—almost—in
her glee.

âItâs most extraordinary,â she cried,
dancing about the room with delight. âI
[118]

never heard of such a thing; youâre the
most wonderful orderly—â

âYou seem very merry, Miss E.,â said
an officer who put his head into the room
just then.

âOh, Major Diggle! Just look here.â
And in a few words, volubly spoken, she
explained what had occurred.

âSo you know French, do you?â said
the major to Herbert, in a supercilious tone
impossible to describe. âAnd Latin and
Greek perhaps, and Hebrew?â

âNo, sir, not Hebrew.â Herbert had
drawn himself up straight, and stood correctly
at âattention.â He had already learnt
the lesson of respect due to an officer, and
was fully conscious of the great gulf which
separated the major from the private soldier.

âWhatâs your name? Larkins? Where
[119]

were you at school? When did you enlist?
And why?â

Herbert answered all these questions
except the last.

âYou donât choose to tell that, eh? Oh,
with all my heart. Itâs none of my business.
But now, if Miss Prioleau does not
want you—that will do; you can go.â

Herbert saluted, and walked off.

Directly the door was shut, the major
turned to Edith, and said,

âYou ought not to be so familiar with
private soldiers. You mustnât do that
again, Miss E.â

âI shall do as I please, and donât choose
to be called Miss E., Major Diggle.â

He equally hated to be called Diggle
without the Cavendish.

âI shall tell the colonel,â he said rather
angrily, as he left the room.

[120]

She only made a face after him when
he had gone, as though she did not care a
bit what he did. There was no love lost
between these two. The child, with intuitive
perception, disliked the
parvenuâs
pretentious
airs. He thought her,
en revanche
, a
very pert and forward child, who ought to
be snubbed and kept in her place. There
were one or two old feuds between them,
too. He had accused her, although she
hotly repudiated the charge, of telling tales.
He had caught her, he declared, looking out
of the windows, to see and tell her father
what officers came late for parade. She, on
the other hand, had discovered, and had
announced her discovery openly, that he
wore—not a wig—but one of Unwin and
Albertâs coverings for bald heads; and Diggle,
who was proud of his looks, did not
like it at all.

[121]

It was not likely, therefore, that any
friend of Edithâs would find much favour
with the major. But even if she had been
disposed to champion the erudite recruit,
so young and obscure a soldier was really
beneath the notice of the great Cavendish
Diggle. By-and-bye Herbert might prove
a thorn in the majorâs side, and give him
many anxious hours—but that time was
still to come.

Meanwhile, Herbert Larkins pursued
the even tenour of his ways, taking the
rough with the smooth, but finding that
the first considerably preponderated. What
he lacked most were congenial companions
and agreeable occupation for his idle hours.
Herbert found the time hang very heavy
on his hands. He could not bring himself
to spend hours with Joe Hanlon in the
canteen; nor, indeed, did âthe Boyâ wish
[122]

him to do so. Hanlon was ambitious for
his young comrade, and he knew the way
to preferment too well to encourage Herbert
to take to drink. There was nothing
left by way of amusement, after all needful
polishing and cleaning-up was done, but
patrolling the Triggertown streets, and frequenting
such ginshops and music-halls as
suffered private soldiers in the Queenâs uniform
to pass their doors.

Herbert, as a last resource, turned bookworm.
He had attended the regimental
school as in duty bound; but it was soon
very clear that a regimental schoolmaster,
however well certificated, could not teach
an ex-sixth-form boy very much. Herbert
passed all the required standards, and was
very quickly dismissed as a prodigy of
learning. He might indeed have obtained
a billet as an assistant teacher in the school,
[123]

but Joe Hanlon supported him in his refusal
of the post. There would be much
better openings for him later on, and in the
regular line. All he had to do was to wait
patiently for his âlance stripe,â and this he
was certain to obtain so soon as he had
completed the twelve monthsâ service from
the time of joining, which was the usual
time of probation in the Dukeâs Own.

The books he read he got from the barrack
library, a place well stocked enough,
but not with volumes covering a wide range
of subjects. After exhausting the list of
good works of fiction and travel, he felt
himself fortunate at finding âLeckyâs Rise
and Progress of Rationalism in Europe.â

One day when Herbert was absent on
guard, a volume of this was lying upon his
shelf—in the wrong place—and the captain,
who was inspecting the rooms, noticed it.

[124]

âItâs that Larkins, sir.â His old enemy
the gate sergeant, Sergeant Pepper, spoke.
âA young soldier, sir. Very careless young
fellow, sir. No use
my
speaking to him,
sir. Better have his name put on the gate,
sir?â

âLet me see the book. âLeckyâ?
Strange! a recruit, do you say? Whatâs
he like? Smart? Send him over to my
quarters to-morrow.â

Captain Greathed was an officer of a
somewhat uncommon type. Thoughtful,
studious, steady, he concealed under a quiet
demeanour a true soldierly spirit and keen
professional ambition. He yearned secretly
for military distinction, and only bided his
time. Meanwhile he read and pondered
deeply the lessons of the past. He had mastered
military literature in all its branches.
Had he chosen, he might have entered the
[125]

Staff College with ease, and would certainly
have passed through it with distinction;
but he was too fond of his regiment to care
to leave it even to study or to serve upon
the staff. He took an interest too in his
men, which was more than many of his
brother officers did.

âI sent for you, Larkins,â he said to
Herbert, âto see what you are made of.
You are reading âLecky;â do you understand
it? Have you read any other books
of the kind?â

âI was always fond of philosophic reading.â

âYou have been well educated, then?
You are the man, I suppose, who did Miss
Prioleauâs French lesson for her?â That
story had soon got about. âWell, thatâs
not everything; letâs see how much you
know,â and Captain Greathed put a series
[126]

of questions to him which soon tested the
extent of his learning.

âYou ought to do well enough, but
book-lore is not everything. You look
strong. Are you active? Are you good at
gymnastics? Can you play cricket, and
walk and run well? Try you? We will.
Meanwhile keep straight and steady, and
youâll do. Itâll be your own fault if you
donât get on.â

From that time forth Captain Greathed
took especial notice of Herbert, spoke to
him frequently—an honour highly prized by
the private soldier—advised him as to his
reading, and lent him military books. All
this did not pass unobserved in the company,
and it soon became evident that his
comrades rather resented the captainâs undisguised
preference for Larkins. The body
of the men in the Dukeâs Own were not
[127]

particularly attached to their officers, and
to be a favourite with superiors was not a
certain passport to popularity with the
rank and file. Herbert, in spite of Boy
Hanlonâs championship, found himself kept
at armâs length rather, and often subjected
to innuendoes and sneers.

One day there was some commotion in
the barrack-room. Several men who had
been slovenly on parade had had their
âpassesâ stopped. These permits to be
absent from quarters after hours are much
appreciated, and those who had forfeited
them were naturally sore. Herbert, who
wished to attend a lecture at the Mechanicsâ
Institute, had also âput in a pass,â
backed by the captain, which had been
granted, much to the disgust of the other
men.

Itâs a burning shame,â said one; and
[128]

others followed on the same side, but with
louder and coarser expletives.

âA young jiggermy-dandy like you,â
cried a big soldier, Jubbock by name, who
had the reputation of being cock and bully
of the company. âWhat right have you to
whatâs denied your betters? A sneaking
young lickspittle, whoâs got the length of
the captainâs foot. Iâll teach you to—â

Jubbock advanced towards him with a
threatening air.

âWell?â said Herbert coolly, âwhatâll
you teach me?â

âTo know your master. Take that,â and
Jubbock aimed a tremendous blow at Herbert,
which the latter promptly parried, and
with a smart âone—twoâ put the great fellow
flat on his back.

There was a shout in the barrack-room
as Jubbock rose furious and closed with his
[129]

opponent. Then came a hubbub of voices.
âThe sergeant, the sergeant! Sergeant
Pepper, the âReal Cayenne!ââ as he was
commonly called when he looked like mischief.

âWhatâs this? Quarrelling in the barrack-room?
Iâll not have it. Drop it.
Who began it? You, Larkins? Then to
the guard-room youâll go, double quick.
Here, Corporal Smirke, get a file of men.â

âBut tâother chap rasperated him,â Hanlon
put in. âJubbockâs more to blame than
Larkins. If you shop one you must shop
the other.â

âSo I will. Iâll run them both in—march
them off.â

And so Herbert, with a smarting sense
of injustice, found himself relegated to the
guard-house, and locked up for the night.

[130]

CHAPTER VIII.

THE ORDER BOOK.

Herbert woke after a troubled nightâs rest,
disturbed by the occasional irruption of
comrades brought in by the piquet and
patrols, in various stages of intoxication,
and the visits of the sergeant of the guard.
The bare boards had been his bed, and he
ached in every limb. It was with a sense of
relief almost, although he dreaded the ordeal
before him, that he washed and cleaned
himself up preparatory to taking his place
in the ranks with the rest of âthe prisoners.â
With them, under escort of the guard, he
was presently marched to the orderly-room,
and then, after waiting half-an-hour for his
turn, he was marched into the presence of
[131]

his commanding officer, to answer for his
alleged crime.

He and Jubbock appeared together before
their judge, Colonel Prioleau. The
sergeant, who was the only witness, gave his
evidence fairly, although not without a bias
against Herbert, but the Colonel withheld
judgment till he heard the defence.

âWhat have you got to say?â he asked
of both abruptly.

âPlease, your honour,â began Jubbock,
âwe wasnât fighting at all; we was only
wrastling. This young chap says, says he,
he knew a thing or two about the Cumberland
cropper, and I, says I, knowâd more
about the Hampshire hug; and with that we
had a set-to, and the sergeant found us at it.â

The old soldierâs tendency to misstatement—to
call it by no stronger name—was
very repugnant to honest Herbert.

[132]

âI beg your pardon, sir,â he put in, âhe
is not telling you the truth. We
were

fighting. He struck me, and I knocked
him down.â

Colonel looked up a little curiously.
Herbertâs accent and his language were
both more accurate than one is accustomed
to find in a private soldier.

âYou did, did you? And would you
do it again?â

âI would, sir, if he provoked me; Iâm
not afraid of him,â cried Herbert, hotly.

âHeâd better try,â Jubbock said, growing
also warm, notwithstanding the awe
inspired by the great man in whose presence
he stood.

âItâs quite evident you canât agree.
Thereâs bad blood between you still.
Well, you know the old rule—no, Captain
Greathed, I wonât hear a word—young soldiers
[133]

must find their level, and hold their
own. Besides, there is the old regimental
custom. You must fight it out. Send
them down to the main ditch, as usual,
and let the orderly sergeant go with them
to see fair play. Itâs no use talking to me,
Captain Greathed; I shall stick to the old
rule of the Dukeâs Own so long as I am
commanding the corps.â

Captain Greathed thought it wisest to
let matters take their course. Any further
interference to protect Herbert might have
looked like favouritism, and have done
the young fellow more harm than good.
He may have thought, too, that Herbert
could give a good account of his antagonist.

The mill was conducted according to
custom, in semi-official fashion. The orderly
sergeant, as before said, and two
[134]

bottle-holders—Hanlon was Herbertâs—were
the only spectators.

For a long time it seemed a close affair.
Jubbockâs weight and great reach of arm
were immensely in his favour. But Herbert
had more science. Self-defence, although
fast becoming an old-fashioned art,
was not unknown at Deadham School,
and he had grown into an accomplished
practitioner in it. He was lighter, too,
and far more active than Jubbock, and
this told in the long run. His adversary
tried in vain to get at him; but Herbert
danced around him like a cork, till by
degrees Jubbock lost all patience and
struck out wildly. The wily Herbert
promptly seized his advantage, and began
to punish Jubbock severely. After this
the victory was not long in doubt. At
the end of the fourteenth round, Jubbock
[135]

threw up the sponge, and Herbert was declared,
officially, to have won the day.

The result of the fight, noised about as
it was in the company, naturally added
greatly to Herbertâs prestige. Jubbock
was a coarse, rough fellow, inclined to be
brutal and overbearing, and he had so long
tyrannised over his comrades that his defeat
was hailed with much satisfaction.
âThe Boyâ—old Joe Hanlon—was wild
with delight. He was never tired of expatiating
upon Herbertâs prowess, and
talked so much about it, taking so much
credit to himself, that you might have
thought it was he who had won the fight.

Herbert received even higher approval.

âSo I hear you held your own,â the captain
had said to him one day. âI thought
it was not unlikely you would. But donât
be puffed up by your victory. Take heed
[136]

to your going—Jubbockâs not likely to love
you the more because you have shown
yourself the better man.â

There was wisdom in this advice. Jubbock
bore malice, as Herbert soon found,
from his sulky demeanour and the way he
scowled when he dared. Hanlon too reported
that Jubbock had sworn to be even
with young Larkins yet. But what could
he do? Herbert laughed such vague threats
to scorn.

It was not long after this that unpleasant
rumours became rife in the barrack-room.
It was clear that the occupants
thereof were not all loyal to one another.
The men missed things. First, odds and
ends disappeared. A button-brush, a comb,
a tin of blacking or a red herring bought
for tea. Then money went—pence, not
too plentiful with soldiers, and hoarded up
[137]

between pay-days, in cleaning bag or knapsack,
to be drawn upon as required for the
menâs
menus plaisirs
.

There was evidently a thief in the
room.

âYes: and heâs got to be found out
too,â said Joe Hanlon. âThere ainât been
such a thing known in the Dukeâs Own
these years past.â

âNo, nor wouldnât be now,â said another,
âif we got honest lads as recruits. We want
no swell-mobsmen and high-falutin dandies
with their grand airs, and their fine talk,
who come from no one knows where.â

âWhat dâye mean?â asked Hanlon sharply.
âIf thatâs a slap at my towney, I give
you the lie, and no two words about it.
Larkins is as honest a young chap as ever
took the shilling.â

âWell, Jubbock said—â

[138]

âItâs just what I thought,â said âthe Boy.â
âJubbock means mischief, but Iâll circumvent
him, or my nameâs not Joe Hanlon.â

Matters were presently brought to a
crisis. Two half-crowns, a shilling and
some coppers were stolen on the day following
pay-day, and the men were growing
furious.

âIâd swear to my half-crown anywhere,â
said one victim. âIt had a twist at the
edges and a scar on the Queenâs nose.â

âLetâs all agree to be searched—our
kits, and packs, and all.â

âYes, yes,â everybody cried. âWeâll
call the colour-sergeant, and do it all regular
and proper, so we will.â

There was a general stampede out of
the room. Jubbock only was left in it, and
Hanlon, who had been shaving behind the
door, and was not visible.

[139]

The men came trooping back, headed
by the colour-sergeant—a stout, consequential
little man, who felt that his position
was only second in dignity to that of the
commander-in-chief.

âNo man must leave the room. You,
Corporal Closky, see to that. Now, Sergeant
Limpetter, weâll take the beds with
their kits as they come.â

The search was regularly and carefully
conducted amid a decorous silence.

All at once there was a loud shout.
The money had been discovered in one of
the packs.

It was Herbertâs.

âLarkins,â cried the colour-sergeant, âIâd
never have believed it.â

There was a hubbub of voices, the prominent
expressions being, âI told you so,â
or âWhat did I say?â followed by a hoarse
[140]

shout for vengeance, for condign punishment
of the despicable thief.

âA court-martial! a barrack-room court-martial,â
cried several men in a breath, and
the cry was taken up by the room.

âStop! Give the lad fair play,â said a
new voice, and Joe Hanlon stepped from
behind the door.

âWhy, what do you know about it?â
the colour-sergeant asked. âIsnât the evidence
as straight as it can be? He was
all but taken in the act. The money, which
is sworn to, is found in his pack.â

âAye, but who put it there?â

âHimself, of course. Who else?â It was
Jubbock who spoke.

âYou did. I saw you.â

The shot told. Jubbock visibly quailed.

âItâs a lie. Iâll swear I never touched the
pack; Iâm ready to take my dying oath—â

[141]

âI saw you, man; I was there, behind
the door, shaving, and you thought you was
all aloneâst in the room. I saw you go to
Larkinsâ bed, take the money out of your
pocket, wrap it in a rag, and put it in Larkinsâ
pack.â

âI didnât, I swear.â

âAfter all, itâs only one manâs word
against anotherâs,â said the colour-sergeant,
magisterially.

âHow else could it have got there?
Donât you know,â Hanlon asked of Jubbock,
âdonât you know that Larkins is in hospital,
and been there these three days past? How
could he have touched the pack? Heâs not
been in the room for three days or more.â

âThatâs right,â said the colour-sergeant.
âThereâs no more to be said. Jubbock, I
would not be in your shoes. You must go
to the guard-room.â

[142]

âNo, no, no;â the men were all furious.
âHeâs the thief, the mean hound. Letâs
settle it ourselves. A court-martial, a
barrack-room court-martial, sergeant.â

âWell, have it your own way. Here,
Snaggs, Cusack, Hippisley, and Muldoon,
youâre the four oldest soldiers in the company;
go into my bunk and talk it over.
Say whatâs to be done with him.â

They came back presently.

âHeâs guilty. Three dozen with the
sling of his own rifle; thatâs our sentence—â

âWhich I approve,â said the colour-sergeant,
and the informal punishment was
forthwith administered in a way which
would have gladdened the heart of the
fiercest old martinet who ever told the
drummer to lay on.

Herbert heard all about it, as soon as
[143]

he came out of hospital, and was not sorry
for the villain who had so nearly led him
into a terrible scrape. Had the case been
proved against him it would have ruined
him utterly, for now at length promotion,
humble enough, but still advancement, was
close at hand. Within a week or two the
regimental orders contained a notification
that Private Herbert Larkins, of F company,
was appointed a lance-corporal.

This raised him at once above the malevolence
of enemies such as Jubbock. But
it gave him work enough for half a dozen.
The lance-corporal, the junior grade of non-commissioned
officer, is a sort of general
utility man, whose duties begin at daylight
and do not end at night. He must be
always clean and well dressed, or adieu to
hope of further promotion. He must be at
the beck and call of the company sergeants,
[144]

and ready to fly for the sergeant-major.
He must be peremptory yet judicious with
the privates, whom, although he was one
himself yesterday, he is called upon now to
command. Difficult, not to say arduous, as
were his functions, Herbert managed to
discharge them to the satisfaction of his
superiors, and soon became known in the
regiment as a smart and intelligent young
man.

One evening it fell to his lot to take the
âorder bookâ round for the perusal of the
officers of the company. Ernest Farrington
was one of them, and in due course Herbert
came to his quarters. He knocked and
heard the usual âCome in.â

âOrders, sir.â

âOrders! All right. One moment—â
âYes, sir; thatâs all I know about it,â went
on young Farrington, in continuation evidently
[145]

of a previous talk. His interlocutor
was Major Cavendish-Diggle.

âYou donât know what became of Lady
Farrington? Where is she?â

âAt a private asylum—Dr. Plumâs, at
Greystone, the other end of the county, you
know.â

âTo be sure. It must have given Sir
Rupert great annoyance. But now itâs all
happily settled, of course?â

Diggle was just then making the running
for Miss Farrington, and wished to be
quite certain that there was no fear of
future disinheritance.

âAbsolutely,â said Ernest. âThe crazy
old creature wonât be heard of again, probably.â

âShall I leave the order book, sir?â
Herbert then asked, and they remembered
they were not alone. They little
[146]

guessed who their listener was, and how
much they had inadvertently revealed to
him.

He had long wished to ascertain the
whereabouts of his kind patroness, and now
he knew. What use he might make of the
information did not occur to him. After
all, what could a poor soldier do against
such a powerful enemy as Sir Rupert Farrington?
Still the mouse helped the lion.
And it was something to know exactly what
had become of poor Lady Farrington. If
he could but come across the Larkins, there
might be some hope of his re-establishing
himself, perhaps of again putting forward
his claims. But the only reply he received
from the War Office, to which he had written,
was that Sergeant Larkins was employed
as a barrack-sergeant abroad, and
could not at the moment be traced. He
[147]

must wait, that was clear. But everything
comes to him who can wait, and Herbert
was still young enough to be sanguine and
full of hope.

[148]

CHAPTER IX.

A BALL IN BARRACKS.

The first of September was a great day
always at Farrington Hall. Sir Rupert
preserved very strictly; he was fond of
shooting, and his coverts were always well
stocked. They had a large party in the
house; men chiefly, good guns who could
be relied upon to do their share in swelling
the Farrington âbag.â

This year several of Ernestâs brother
officers were to have been invited, but
Major Diggle manÅuvred so cleverly that
none of them were asked but himself. He
had his own reasons for keeping men away
from the Hall. He was not afraid of rivals,
of course—who among the Dukeâs Own was
[149]

there to compete with him? Still they
might inadvertently interfere with his little
game; and he preferred, at least for the
present, to have the field all to himself.

Major Cavendish-Diggle was much appreciated
at the Hall. Lady Farrington, a
foolish, inconsequent woman, who was entirely
wrapped up in Ernest, her only son,
received the Major almost with effusion.
He had been, oh, so kind to Ernest! She
knew it; it was no use his disclaiming it,
and she was deeply grateful to him.

âIth thutch a trial joining a regiment;
everything tho thrange, and Erney tho
young, tho inexperienced; he would have
been mitherable, quite mitherable, but for

you
.â

Lady Farrington was a large fair woman;
so fair as to be almost colourless. Her
manner was not without distinction, and
[150]

would have been impressive but for the
vapidity of her remarks, and a trick of
utterance due, seemingly, to her having too
many teeth in her mouth, which robbed
her words of anything like expression,
and sometimes made them unintelligible.
Ernest, her son, greatly took after her.
He was tall, but rather shambling in gait,
and still excessively thin. In voice and
manner of speech he reproduced Lady Farrington
exactly. His mouth also seemed
full of hot potatoes, or too full of teeth;
and as he had a trick of keeping it constantly
open, as though to cool the potatoes,
or air his teeth, his general expression was
vacuous in the extreme. A rather full
lower lip and a very receding chin did not
add to his personal charms. You gathered
at once from his face and air that he was
weak, irresolute, easily led, and that he
[151]

might, if misled, slide soon into vicious
ways.

But he had improved wonderfully since
he had joined the Dukeâs Own. They all
said so. Even Sir Rupert, dark and undemonstrative
as he was generally, thawed
enough to say that he thought soldiering
would make a man of Ernest—if anything
would. Letitia, as Miss Farrington was
called, and who in many respects resembled
her father, changed her tone on seeing how
much Ernest was changed for the better.
Her attitude towards him had hitherto been
one of patronage mixed with spite. Although
outwardly she was very affectionate—in
her heart she bore him a grudge because
he was one of the sex commonly
called superior to her own. She was the
elder by three or four years; she had far
more brains—ânot that that was surprisingâ—as
[152]

she said when she was more than
usually venomous, seeing that Ernest had
next to none. She was a Farrington, as
was evident from her likeness to her father,
while her brother was clearly a Burdakin,
like his mother. Why should an absurd
and monstrously unfair custom constitute
him the heir and future head of the family,
while she must be satisfied with what her
father might choose to give her as a marriage
portion or as a settlement for life?
She had always bitterly resented the Salic
law as it obtained in England with regard
to the succession of estates and titles.

Letitia was, however, much more civil
to Ernest now. There may be many subtle
reasons for such sudden changes of demeanour.
Major Cavendish-Diggle was perhaps
not remotely connected with Letitiaâs. He
was Ernestâs bosom friend; what if he presently
[153]

developed into a friend and admirer
of her own? Letitia was not exactly ill-favored,
but she was certainly not a beauty
in the strict sense of the term. Dark complexioned
and thin lipped, but with a nose
too sharp, and cheek bones too high, her
face was not strikingly attractive to say the
least of it; and the fact was being gradually
borne in upon her, as she grew on in years,
by the slackness with which suitors sought
her hand. Major Cavendish-Diggle was
one of the first who showed better taste.
Why should not men admire her? She
had a neat well-proportioned figure. Her
eyes were good, of the deep brown piercing
order; her dark hair was abundant and
rich. She was a good talker, had all the
accomplishments of a well-educated young
lady, and a large share of that indescribable
air of good breeding, of that perfect ease in
[154]

manner and thorough
savoir faire
, which
are only to be seen in women of good
station—all of which Diggle felt would be
extremely becoming in a colonelâs or general
officerâs wife. If the thin lips and fierce
eyes foretold a vixenish temper when
thwarted, or if the world went wrong with
her, these were bad points still in embryo,
little likely to deter so matter of fact a
wooer as Diggle from prosecuting his suit.

Not that he precipitated matters. He
could see, with half an eye, that Miss Farrington
accepted his attentions cheerfully
enough; but he was very doubtful whether
her parents would look upon him with equal
favour. Indeed, Sir Rupert had more than
once spoken in a way to damp Diggleâs
hopes. The baronet held his head high.
He evidently knew what was due to himself.
Having passed his early years as a
[155]

struggling solicitor, barely able to keep the
wolf from his door, he was now very eloquent
about
mÃ©salliances
, and the proper
maintenance of distinctions of class. The
majorâs heart misgave him, for reasons best
known to himself, when he heard Sir Rupert
inveighing against the annoyance of upstart
tradesmen, who, on the strength of fortunes
amassed by not too reputable business (so
he said), aped the manners of their betters,
and tried to push themselves forward into
the front rank of society. This very visit
to Farrington Hall, a crusty old county
magnate to whom Diggle had been formally
introduced, had remarked rather pointedly
upon the majorâs name.

âDiggle, Diggle, I know the name. To
be sure. Get my tea from Diggleâs. Devilish
good tea too—no connection, major,
eh?â

[156]

At which Major Cavendish-Diggle
inwardly shuddered, although he replied
promptly enough.

âCome and taste our champagne at
Triggertown, Mr. Burkinshaw; itâs far better
than the best tea in the world.â Whereby
the inconvenient question was for the moment
satisfactorily shelved.

Diggle knew, therefore, that much circumspection
would be necessary if he aspired
to Letitiaâs hand. All he could hope to
gain was the girlâs good-will and co-operation,
and this, by his assiduous, although
diplomatically veiled attentions, he secured
in due course.

Meanwhile he sought and entirely succeeded
in making himself agreeable to all
in the house. He talked âcentral fireâ with
Sir Rupert, parochial business and district
visiting with Lady Farrington, who pretended
[157]

to play the Dorcas in the parish;
he discussed turnips and quarter sessions
with the squires and local magnates, who
thought that such matters comprised the
whole duty of man; last of all, he played
duets and danced with Miss Farrington
after dinner, in a way she called, and really
felt to be divine.

âIt does not bore you to dance?â she
asked him one evening.

âAnd with
you
? No, indeed, and really
I am passionately devoted to it.â

âSome men now-a-days are so fine. They
stand about the doors at a dance like farm
servants at a fair waiting to be hired.â

âThatâs not the way with the Dukeâs
Own,â said Diggle, laughing. âNo idlers are
allowed when we give a ball. You should
see our youngsters dance; and we have a
string band on purpose for dance music.â

[158]

âDelightful! Do give us a ball, Major
Diggle.â

âWith all my heart; when you like.
You shall fix the day, and it shall be the
finest Triggertown has ever seen.â

The subject was re-opened another day,
when Diggle was not by.

âDoes it rest with him?â incredulous
Sir Rupert asked of Ernest. âWhat does
your colonel say?â

âOh, Colonel Prioleauâs ânot in itâ compared
to Major Cavendish. We always call
him Major Cavendish, he likes it better.
The Majorâs the leading man in the regiment.
He does just as he pleases. Thereâs
nobody like him.â

And Ernest went off into pÃ¦ans of
praise, expatiating upon Diggleâs innumerable
good qualities with all the eloquence
(it was not much) he could command.

[159]

But he did not exaggerate the Majorâs
influence in the regiment. The ball, which
came off a month or so later, was on a scale
of unprecedented splendour, mainly because
Diggle had resolved that it should be so.
He had taken the affair altogether into his
own hands. It was he who insisted that
the ices should come straight from Gunterâs,
that there should be
foie gras
, ploversâ eggs,
and fresh truffles at supper; it was he who
had conceived the brilliant idea of placing
silver-hooped barrels in the tea rooms, full
of champagne constantly on tap. He had
commissioned the best decorators in London
to do up the ball rooms; one built, contiguous
to the mess-house, a boudoir, intended
for the sole use of ladies, which was
furnished with ivory toilet appliances, and
lined with amber satin throughout; another
designed an artificial grotto filled with
[160]

blocks of real ice, which, as they melted,
fed a number of fountains, whose waters
fell in showers of sweet-scented spray; a
third, entrusted with the floral decorations,
grouped great masses of tropical plants, a
wealth of rich variegated colours in the
corridors, before the fireplaces, and in all
the best points of view. There were two
rooms for dancing; in one the inimitable
string band of the Dukeâs Own performed,
in the other a detachment of Coote and
Tinneyâs was specially engaged.

âIth moth wontherful, thertainly,â said
Lady Farrington, in raptures, as Diggle
received her; and having presented her
to quiet Mrs. Prioleau, who was in duty
bound to do the honours, but who was
utterly bored and worn out after the first
five minutes, led her to a seat of state on a
sort of dais at the top of the room.

[161]

âOh, Major Cavendish-Diggle!â cried
Letitia, âyou have indeed achieved a most
triumphant success. Itâs like a scene in
fairy-land. The flowers, and the innumerable
lights, the falling waters. Exquisite,
enchanting;â and she half closed her eyes,
as in an ecstasy of bliss.

âI wonder what it will all cost?â growled
Sir Rupert,
sotto voce
. âA pretty penny.
I shall have Ernest overdrawing again.â

The fact being that, although Ernest
received a handsome allowance, his account
was perpetually overdrawn. Constant association
with Diggle did not tend to economical
ways. What with grouse for breakfast,
and hot-house fruits for lunch; what with
great guest nights, and expensive wines
flowing freely, his mess bills were enormous.
Then there were his horses, his
dog-cart to take him to the station, his
[162]

chambers in the neighbourhood of St.
Jamesâs, his boot varnish, and his new hats
once a fortnight, and his fresh âbutton-holesâ
every two or three hours. Sir Rupert
hardly knew how the money went, but he
knew that the six hundred a year he allowed
his son, which was more than he had enjoyed
for years until he came into the title,
did not go half as far as it should, and he
grumbled at the extravagance and ostentation
of this great ball.

The baronet was not in the best of
humours, therefore, as he stood upon one
of the two raised platforms which had been
erected on each side of the regimental
colours, for the accommodation of the most
distinguished guests. The colours were
uncased, and drooped gracefully over a
trophy of swords and bayonets, the whole
being under the protection of two stalwart
[163]

sentries in full uniform, who stood erect
and impassive, like stone statues, perfectly
unmoved by the revels in progress around.
It was a signal honour to be permitted to
mount guard in the ball-room, and only the
finest-looking and the steadiest men were
selected for the duty. But the duty was
fatiguing, and the sentries were relieved
every hour, the relief being carried out
quietly, but strictly in accordance with the
regulations, by non-commissioned officers
carefully selected, like the sentries, on account
of their smartness and gallant
bearing.

While Sir Rupert was standing scowling
at the entertainment, for which, without
sharing in the honour and glory, he would
probably have to pay, the relief marched
in. He looked on at the ceremony without
interest, heard with indifferent ears the
[164]

trite words of command, âPort arms, take
post, shoulder, order,â and the rest, when
something in the aspect of the corporal in
command attracted his attention, and he
found himself looking curiously at the
soldierâs face.

Surely he knew it? Where had he seen
it before?

Then with a sudden start he remembered.
The man was the living image of
cracked Lady Farringtonâs
protÃ©gÃ©
—of that
lad whom he, Sir Rupert, had inveigled
down into Devonshire, and left there to
starve. Could it possibly be the same man?
Did the fellow know him? Apparently
not.

He was still debating the point as the
relief marched away, when all doubts were
set at rest by hearing a very young lady, a
child, in fact (it was Edith Prioleau), say
[165]

laughingly, and with the accents of Stratford-le-Bow,
as she touched the corporal on
the arm with her fan,

â
En bien, Caporal Larkins, comment vous
portez-vous?
â

To which the corporal replied, with a
smile,

â
TrÃ¨s bien, mademoiselle. Et vous?
â

There could be no mistake. Look,
name, voice, all were the same. What a
curious fatality! In the same regiment as
his son—the true heir and the false serving
side by side. Should he tell Ernest? Then
Sir Rupert, pondering much, came to the
conclusion that it would be best to keep
his own counsel, but resolved to put, if possible,
a watch upon the young man.

[166]

CHAPTER X.

MUTINY IN THE RANKS.

There was great grief in the Dukeâs Own.
Colonel Prioleau was about to leave the
regiment. He had commanded it for a
number of years, and would have liked to
have gone on commanding it to the end of
the chapter, but promotion to the rank of
general was fast approaching him, and he
felt that he must ârealiseâ at least a part of
his cash. Colonels of regiments in old days
served for about tenpence a-day. The rest
of their pay barely represented the interest
upon the capital sum they had sunk in purchasing
their rank. By exchanging to half-pay
before promotion, a regimental lieutenant-colonel
was able to pull a few
[167]

thousands out of the fire; and this Colonel
Prioleau did.

There was great grief in the regiment
at his approaching retirement. It was not
so much on account of his personal qualities,
although these—more particularly his
easy-going
laissez aller
system—had long
gained him great popularity, but because the
command was to pass into the hands of one
who was not, as the saying is, a âDukeâs
Own man.â Major Byfield had exchanged
into the corps some few years previously,
very much against the will of the regiment.
Not that there was anything against him.
Appearances were indeed in his favour.
He was a quiet gentlemanly little person,
with that slightly apologetic manner, and
hesitating air, which often earn a man appreciation
from his fellows, because they
indicate a tacit acknowledgment of his inferiority.
[168]

Major Byfield showed himself
still more nervous and undecided on joining
the Dukeâs Own. Although as a field officer
his position was assured, and entitled him
to considerable deference from all, he seldom
claimed it or asserted himself more
than he could help. His brother officers
tolerated him, and were civil to him when
they saw him, which was not often; but
they yielded him no respect, and suffered
him to interfere very little in the discipline
and management of the corps. What could
he know about the Dukeâs Own, or its regimental
âsystem?â He had come from the
130th which, it was well known, had a very
different âsystem,â although both were, in
fact, ruled by the Queenâs Regulations, and
should have been governed on precisely the
same lines. There is a good deal of mystery
made and much stress laid upon the âsystemâ
[169]

in force in a regiment. No doubt in
many minor details there is a marked difference,
but the broad outlines are, or
ought to be, the same. But it is a favourite
dogma, especially with officers in whom

esprit de corps
is strong, that no one can
understand this system unless he has been
trained in a regiment and assimilated it
with his earliest ideas. So when the major
spoke even in a whisper, or made the faintest
hint of a suggestion, he was pooh-poohed
and put down. Diggle, his fellow, although
junior field officer, quietly said that it was
all nonsense, that Byfield misunderstood
the situation, that he had better wait till he
had longer experience in the regiment
before he presumed to put forward his
views.

Major Byfield was thus satisfactorily
repressed—but only for the time. He had
[170]

views and opinions of his own upon soldiering,
and he was determined when opportunity
came to give them full play. They
had long persistently preached up and
paraded before him the system in force in
the Dukeâs Own, but he had for as long
come to the conclusion that the system was
a bad one, and was resolved to reform it
should he ever come into power. His character
was a strange medley of opposite
qualities. Behind the nervous diffidence,
which being upon the surface seemed his
most prominent trait, was an amount of
quiet self-opinionated obstinacy which
boded ill for those under his orders should
he ever have much authority in his hands.
Mrs. Byfield could have opened peopleâs
eyes had she been permitted to disclose the
secrets of the Byfield
mÃ©nage
. The major
was as narrow-minded as a woman, and as
[171]

prone to mistake the relative proportion of
things, to entirely ignore the main issues,
to neglect or overlook broad questions, and
concentrate himself with much tenacity
upon comparatively unimportant details.

These peculiarities
began to develop

themselves very soon after he obtained the
command. It became evident that the new
colonel was a different man from what was
supposed. He had been deemed a cipher—one
who could hardly call his soul his
own; but he proved a fussy, fidgetty, anxious
creature, who from nervous apprehension,
backed up by no small amount of
self-conceit, promised to make everybodyâs
life a burden to him. The officers as a
body began to fear that the good old times
were on the wane. The decadence of the
Dukeâs Own must have fairly commenced
when leave for hunting was refused and
[172]

there were two commanding officersâ parades
on the same day. The fact was, the Colonel
had resolved to reform the regiment according
to his own ideas, and had already
set to work with a will. The points on
which it fell short of perfection were very
clear to his own mind—a weak, but extremely
active mind. He thought the officers
neglected their business and knew too
little of it—facts incontrovertible no doubt,
although the remedy was not easy to discover,
and needed stronger treatment than
Colonel Byfield was in a position to apply.
He felt dissatisfied, too, with the demeanour
of the men in quarters and on parade, and
if it was more within his compass to bring
about improvement in these respects, his
task was likely to be surrounded with the
greater difficulty if his officers were discontented
and soured. But the Colonel could
[173]

not see much beyond the end of his nose,
and rushed forward blindly to his fate.

To come in for a large share of criticism,
not to say abuse, from those under his
orders, is too commonly the lot of the regimental
lieutenant-colonel. Colonel Byfield
was no exception to the general rule. Before
he had been in command a month, his
officers generally began to disapprove of his
proceedings; after three, they disliked him
cordially; and this grew into positive
hatred at the end of six. Of course they
kept their opinions very much to themselves.
English officers, however grievous
their wrongs, whether real or fancied, never
overstep the bounds of due subordination;
and however much those of the Dukeâs Own
may have chafed at their commanding
officerâs trying ways and irksome rule, they
did no more than call him a âbeastâ to one
[174]

another, and utter frequent and fervid, but
private prayers for his translation to some
other sphere in this world or the next.
They bore their burden bravely enough,
silently too and without protest, except
when some graceless subaltern or more artful
captain wilfully exhibited an utter
ignorance of the very rudiments of drill by
clubbing his company upon parade, or comported
himself disgracefully at the weekly
examinations—offences especially heinous
in the eyes of a Colonel whose greatest
âfadâ was to make his officers walking
vade
mecums
or living encyclopÃ¦dias of military
knowledge. The schoolmaster was abroad
in the Dukeâs Own, very much to everyoneâs
discomfort and dissatisfaction.

Excessive timidity, an exaggerated fear
of constituted authority, were the secrets of
Colonel Byfieldâs irritating line of conduct.
[175]

He was for ever invoking the distant deities
of the Horse Guards, and deprecating their
wrath. As for their local chief priest, the
general officer commanding the Triggertown
district, whose authority was much more
tangible and near at hand, Colonel Byfield
had for him the most wholesome and abject
apprehension. It was to appease the possible
fury of this awful functionary that he
worried and harassed the regiment from
morning till night.

âWhat will the general say?â or âWhat
will the general do?â were phrases continually
on his lips. He forgot that, as a matter
of fact, the general, who was an ordinary
general, would probably say or do nothing
at all. But this professional âJorkinsâ was
quoted on every occasion.

âI cannot overlook your misconduct,â he
would say to Joe Hanlon, when brought up
[176]

for the thousandth time for being drunk.
âThe general wonât let me.â

âAs if the general cared,â muttered âthe
Boyâ to himself.

âI must punish you; I must, indeed.â

âColonel Prioleau never did, sir; and I
hope, sir—â

âColonel Prioleau is not here now, and
I donât choose to be spoken to in that way.
Fourteen daysâ marching order drill; and if
you come here again, Iâll try you for
âHabitualâ—I will, mark my words.â

âWhatâs the good of serving on in the
old corps now?â said Hanlon, very wroth,
after he had done his defaulterâs drill. âItâs
not what it used to be. Iâll put in for my
discharge.â

He was fully entitled to it. Twenty-one
yearsâ service, all told. Five good-conduct
badges, less one, which his recent misconduct
[177]

had robbed him of; for with old soldiers
it is strength of head, or immunity
from punishment that brings reputation;
and Hanlon, thanks to Colonel Prioleauâs
good nature, had the credit of being one of
the best behaved men in the regiment.

âI wonât stay to be humbugged about,â
he said, indignantly, to his comrade Herbert.
âIâll take my pension and look out
for a billet in civil life.â

âWhat can you get to do?â

âLots of things. Commissionaire, prison
warder, attendant in a lunatic âsylum.â

Herbert pricked up his ears.

âDo you think you could get the last?
I wish you would, and Iâll tell you why.
Youâve never heard my story?â

Whereupon Herbert told it all.

âI knew you was a nob from the first.
I saw it in your talk and in the cut of your
[178]

jib. Dr. Plumâs of Greystone, you say.
Right you are. Thatâs where Iâll go. To-morrow,
if not sooner, and Iâll give you the
office—double quick. Hold on a bit, thatâs
all youâve got to do; hold on, and do your
duty, and itâll all come right in the end.
And see here—â

Hanlon looked about him, as if afraid
of listeners.

âThings ainât comfortable in the old
corps, not just now; and thereâs going to
be a row. They wonât let on to you,âcos
youâre a non-com, and whatâs more, only a
recruit. Thereâs men in the regiment mean
mischief, if they only get the chance; and
if they donât, theyâll make it, sure as my
nameâs Joe.â

âWhat can they do?â

âThey donât think or care. All they
want is a rumpus, so as to get old Byfield
[179]

in trouble and make him leave, and that
theyâll be able to do. Donât join them, not
whatever they say. Keep your ears cocked,
and nip in—only on the right side.â

Hanlon had taken his discharge and
got the promise of a billet at Dr. Plumâs,
when the storm actually broke in the
Dukeâs Own.

Colonel Byfield had been agitated beyond
measure at the news of the approaching
move of his regiment to one of the
large camps, and in view of the scrutiny
which there awaited him his petty tyranny
had passed all bounds. He had parades
morning, noon, and night. He exercised
the men
ad nauseam
at squad drill, goose
step, and the manual and platoon. He
marched them perpetually in battalion up
and down the barrack yard, and he took
them out day after day upon Triggertown
[180]

Common for light infantry drill. All this,
albeit torture of the most painful description,
they could have tolerated probably
without a murmur had not the Colonel,
dissatisfied with the progress made, sentenced
the regiment to be deprived of all
leave in all ranks.

This was the point at which the worm
turned. One fine morning, long after the
âdressingâ bugle had sounded, followed by
the ânon-commissioned officers callâ and
the âfall-in,â not a man made his appearance
upon parade. Colonel Byfield and
the officers had the whole square to themselves.
The rest of the regiment with the
exception of a number of men belonging
to one company, F, formed up in the ditch,
and while the commanding officer was
whistling at vacancy, marched off in excellent
order to a distant part of the glacis,
[181]

where they piled arms and refused to
return.

It would be tedious, and it indeed forms
no part of this history to narrate, except in
the briefest terms, the progress of this very
serious military
lÃ¢che
. The men, as is
usual in such cases, went to the wall. The
ringleaders were hunted out, tried and
severely punished, and the whole regiment
was ordered to proceed on foreign service
forthwith. The causes which had led to the
disturbance were closely investigated, and
as a natural consequence Colonel Byfield
was placed upon half-pay.

It was for a long time doubtful whether
Diggle, who was the next senior, should
be allowed to succeed to the command;
but he brought all the interest he could
to bear, and he eventually won the day.

As Colonel Diggle, commanding a corps
[182]

really distinguished, although temporarily
under a cloud, he found Sir Rupert Farrington
not indisposed to accept his proposals
for Letitia; and the marriage came
off just before the regiment embarked for
Gibraltar.

It was at Farrington Hall that the conversation
turning, as it had done more
than once before, upon the recent mutiny,
brought our hero, Herbert Larkins, prominently
to the front.

âThe movement was not general, certainly
not,â Diggle had said. âOne of the
companies, F, Ernestâs in fact, did not take
any share in it.â

âDoes Ernest deserve the credit of that?â

âNot exactly. It was due rather to an
astute young corporal, who quietly locked
the doors of the menâs rooms. They
couldnât get out to join.â

[183]

âReally? He was promoted, of course?â

âYes; he is now a sergeant, and is sure
to get on. Oh yes, young Larkins is sure
to get on.â

âIt was young Larkins, was it?â

âDo you know him?â

âI think I do. I will tell you about it
one of these days.â

Diggle, as one of the Farrington family,
would soon have a right to know.

[184]

CHAPTER XI.

SOME OLD FRIENDS MEET.

For some time after their arrival on the
Rock, the officers of the Dukeâs Own called
it a detestable hole. They were sore at
their expatriation and the manner of it;
they regretted the joys they had left behind,
and could see no good thing in the
much vaunted station where they were now
relegated for their sins. There was nothing
to be done in the place; the climate was
intolerable, and there was nothing to eat.
They had arrived towards the end of the
summer, and the season, never cool, had
been unusually sultry. They came in too
for the tail end of a long visitation of the
âLevanter,â the much dreaded east wind,
[185]

which caps the Rock with a perpetual cloud
and makes life miserable to all; and the
welcome change, when it came at length,
was heralded by a tremendous thunderstorm
and drenching rains. The Dukeâs
Own were still under canvas at the North
Front, waiting till the outgoing regiment
vacated its quarters at Windmill Hill, and
their encampment was nearly swept away
by the storm. Officers lost baggage, the
men their kits, and the whole regiment
united in deep denunciations of the inhospitable
Rock.

Nor did Gibraltar seem to improve upon
a closer acquaintance. Its joys and amusements,
what were they after London and
the shires? Racing! the idea was too preposterous.
Half-a-dozen tinpot nags without
pace or breeding, cantering round a
Graveyard and finishing in a trot. What
[186]

sort of sport was that to offer the Dukeâs
Own, which had always had its own regimental
drag to witness the great events at
home, and which kept open house in its
luncheon tent at Ascot and Goodwood and
upon Epsom Downs? The hunting too!
heaven save the mark! To talk of hunting
with the sweepings of a few second-rate
kennels, dignified with the name of a pack,
when the huntsman was a local genius,
and foxes were said to be so scarce or so
little enterprising that it was often necessary
to have recourse to a red herring!
What was such hunting to men who had
been constantly out (so they said) with the
Heythorp, the Bramham Moor, the Pytchley
and Quorn?

These were the earliest impressions of
Gibraltar prevailing among the officers of the
Dukeâs Own. But our friends eventually
[187]

changed their tone. By their first contemptuous
abstention, they found, in the
first place, that they lost all the fun that
was going, and, next, that, although the
sport was second-rate, they could not excel
in it even when they tried. One or two of
the Dukeâs Own, who were said to be in all
the secrets of the Dawson and John Scott
stables, went in for some of the plates and
cups at the autumn meeting, and signally
failed in everything. Later on, when the
hunting season really began, and they
turned out in a body in red coats and the
most undeniable tops, to cut everybody
down, they were chagrined to find that
it was much more difficult to follow than
they supposed. Red coats and mahogany
tops were nowhere at the end of the first
burst. One or two men were completely
thrown out; a few tried the breakneck
[188]

country between âthe Riversâ only to crane
at length and turn back from the precipices
and steep inclines. After that first day the
Dukeâs Own spoke more respectfully of the
Calpe Hunt. By and bye they became
less critical in other respects, and at length,
when they had been some six months on
the Rock, entered as fully into its amusements,
and enjoyed them as thoroughly as
the oldest stagers in the place.

There was one person, however, connected
with the Dukeâs Own who highly
appreciated Gibraltar from the first. Mrs.
Cavendish-Diggle found the station extremely
to her taste. A bride still in the
hey-day of her married life, full of satisfaction
at the importance of her position as
the commanding officerâs wife, with the
attention she thereby received from all the
Dukeâs Own, Letitia found soldiering, particularly
[189]

at Gibraltar, everything that could
be desired. But what she enjoyed most of
all was the chance she now had of bullying
the brother who hitherto had had it all
his own way at home. Ernest might be
the most worthy at Farrington Hall, but in
the Dukeâs Own he was under Colonel
Diggleâs command, and Colonel Diggle was
now unquestionably under that of his wife.
How the exquisite and self-sufficient Diggle
had succumbed was a mystery which will
probably remain unexplained till the curtain
lectures of the Diggle couple are given
to the world. Then it will no doubt transpire
that in the exercise of those inquisitorial
functions which every wife naturally
arrogates to herself, Letitia had come across
certain damaging facts connected with the
Colonelâs antecedents which put him completely
under his partnerâs thumb. That
[190]

Mrs. Diggle would come ere long to command
the regiment was already plainly apparent
to all, and the fact was not hailed
with particular joy in the corps. Petticoat
government in a regiment is not the most
successful with, nor is it the most palatable
to, those most closely concerned. Letitiaâs
temper was a little too imperious to be
pleasant. She made nipping remarks, and
snubbed and put people down in a way
they hated but were powerless to resent.
âOh! how can you say so, Major Greathed!
You are wrong,
quite
wrong. She married
Lord Chigfordâs second son. But then you
canât be expected to know;â or âItâs not
what I have been accustomed to, Mrs.
Moxon. In my fatherâs house the housekeeper
looked to these things. But then of
course you—â which might be taken to imply
that Mrs. Moxon had been brought up
[191]

very differently, and could not be expected
to know what was what. Or she lectured
the youngsters when they came within her
reach, which was only when they wanted
leave, knowing that without her good word
they could not expect an hour. âI hear
you are getting sadly in debt, Mr. Mauleverer.
I shall write to Sir George.â âSo
you were not at church parade last Sunday,
Mr. Smythe. The Colonel was quite
cross.â âDonât get entangled by any of
these bright-eyed scorpions, Mr. Curzon.
You see I know all about it. Carmen
Molinaro would never do for you.â All of
which irritated and exasperated the officers
of the Dukeâs Own very considerably.

The man who most cordially hated her,
however, was the adjutant, Mr. Wheeler.
He was chafed perpetually by her interference.
Nothing was sacred to her. She
[192]

rushed into professional matters with all
the effrontery of the fool. So long as she
contented herself with favouring her pets
among the soldiersâ wives Wheeler did not
care. It was when she presumed to advise
as to the orderly room work, the correspondence,
promotions, and daily routine,
that he not unnaturally turned rusty.
Whether or not she read the colonelâs
letters he scarcely cared, but he did resent
having to prepare important despatches
from her notes, or send out letters which
she had obviously drafted with her own
hand. Nor could he, after so many years
of nearly absolute authority, readily or
cheerfully resign his power in the regiment.
Hitherto advancement for the non-commissioned
officers had depended mainly
upon his good word. Now it was becoming
evident that their promotion would
[193]

depend in future upon that of the colonelâs
wife. In one particular case which nearly
affected a friend of ours they had fought a
sharp battle; the adjutant was obstinate,
but the lady was more so, and in the end
the latter won the day. It was entirely
through Letitiaâs good offices that Herbert
Larkins became a colour-sergeant long before
the ordinary time. She had taken a
fancy to the young man—not, you may be
sure, because of his presumed connection
with the family, for of that she had not the
slightest inkling—but because it had lain
within his power to do her important service,
and because he was a smart, well-grown
fellow to boot. Letitia, like many
other ill-favoured women, had a keen eye
for manly beauty.

But she had really reason to be grateful
to Herbert. One day, when he was on
[194]

guard upon the Upper Road, Mrs. Cavendish-Diggle,
followed by her groom, passed
on their way towards the town. Something
startled Letitiaâs horse, and, although an
excellent rider, she found he was more than
she could manage. After passaging like a
crab along the road for some hundred
yards, he took to plunging and rearing in
a way to dislodge the most accomplished
horse-woman from her seat. The groom
had ridden up alongside, but he was able
to render little assistance, and his best
efforts only made Letitiaâs horse worse.
Had not Herbert promptly supervened,
Mrs. Diggle would undoubtedly have been
thrown, and probably badly hurt. But
with firm hand on the rein he soon mastered
the horse, then gradually pacified
him.

âIâm sure, sergeant, Iâm extremely
[195]

obliged to you,â said Mrs. Cavendish,
directly she recovered her breath. âWhat
is your name? I must speak of you specially
to the Colonel—Colonel Diggle—you
know me, I presume? and I see you belong
to âus.ââ

âHerbert Larkins, Madam, F company,â
said our hero briefly, as he saluted.

âThank you again, so much.â And with
that the Colonelâs wife rode off.

She did speak of him and his conduct in
the most glowing terms.

âYou must do something for him,
Conrad.â

âCertainly, Iâll make him a present; or,
better still, you shall—a watch, or a pencil-case,
or something.â

âNo, no; something in the regiment, I
mean. Promote him.â

âHeâs very young. Barely a year a
[196]

sergeant. I donât see my way, I donât
indeed.â

âThere are those vacant colours in G
company,â she said, displaying a curiously
intimate acquaintance with regimental
news.

âColour-sergeant! Impossible!â

âSurely not, when I ask it.â

âIt would be grossly unfair. Promotions
must not go by favour.â

âKissing does,â she replied, as though
he might expect no such reward unless he
were more obliging. It was just possible
that by this time Diggle could have deprived
himself of the pleasure without any
acute pang.

âWhat would Mr. Wheeler say?â

âThatâs where it is. You think far
more of displeasing Mr. Wheeler than of
pleasing me. I feel hurt, Conrad; itâs not
[197]

what I have a right to expect, considering—â

When she got on this tack the Colonel
threw up the sponge. He gave in about
the promotion, although the adjutant,
thereby making Letitia his enemy for
life, tried hard to keep him up to the
mark.

The whole thing would have been a job
of the worst kind had Herbert been less
worthy. But he had really developed into
an excellent soldier, smart, personable, and
thoroughly well up in his work. He had
his drill-book at his fingersâ ends, and could
handle a squad as well as any man in the
corps. He had learnt by heart all the details
of interior economy, and was fully
competent to take the charge and payment
of a company, or to do credit to his regiment
in any position in which he might be
[198]

placed. All this Mr. Wheeler was forced
to admit; and although he cherished a
grudge against Herbert on account of what
had passed, he so loved a good soldier that
he could not bear malice long.

Colour-Sergeant Larkins was indeed fast
becoming a very prominent person in the
corps. Some backbiting and no little jealousy
existed, no doubt, but he was the
sort of man to soon outgrow and outlive
such feelings. There was much in his
manner and address to make him generally
popular. His bright face, his cheerful
voice, his manly straightforward ways, commended
him of themselves. But he had
other claims to the suffrages of his fellows.
His old skill in games had not deserted
him, and soldiers are very like schoolboys
in their admiration and respect for personal
prowess. The Dukeâs Own eleven, thanks
[199]

to Herbertâs batting and bowling, won every
match always at the North Front. His
brother sergeants felt lucky if they could
secure him for a hand of fives. In all other
gymnastic exercises he came equally well
to the front. At the garrison athletic
sports, which presently came off, as they
always do, upon the racecourse at the North
Front, he carried everything before him, to
the intense gratification of his comrades in
the corps.

The name of Sergeant Larkins was indeed
on every lip that day. All the world
of Gibraltar was present. His Excellency
the Governor came in state, so did the general,
second in command, and officers of all
grades with their wives; crowds of soldiers
of all the regiments in garrison were there,
and all cheered Herbert to the echo as he
carried off the hurdle-race in magnificent
[200]

style. As for the Dukeâs Own, a lot of
them, frantic with delight, got him on their
shoulders, and were carrying him about in
triumph, when some one came up, and with
a hurried nervous manner, said,

âSergeant Larkins; whereâs Sergeant
Larkins?â

âWho wants him?â said a dozen voices,
thinking perhaps the governor had asked
him to dinner, or the Queen had sent to
make him a general on the spot.

âAn old friend. The oldest heâs got, I
think heâll say, when he sees me and hears
my name.â

His enthusiastic supporters dropped
Herbert, who came forward to speak to the
inquirer.

âItâs himself, himself, by all thatâs holy!
Hercules Albert, donât you remember me?â
cried the man, as he seized both Herbertâs
[201]

hands, shaking them furiously, and seeming
to wish to hug him in his arms.

It was the old Sergeant Larkins, his
stepfather, for whom he had so long searched
in vain.

âI heard them calling out the name,
and it sounded so queer that I thought Iâd
have a look at you. How youâve grown!
But tell me all about yourself. Quick, lad.
I want to hear, and the mother she—â

âSheâs all right and well, I hope,â Herbert
asked, as soon as he could put in a
word. âLetâs go to her at once. How
comes it Iâve never seen you before?â

âOnly landed from Malta on transfer
last week, myself, the missus, and three of
the bairns, thatâs how it was. But come
along, come to the mother at once; sheâll
be crazy with delight when she sees you,
and so will all the rest.â

[202]

CHAPTER XII.

REVELATIONS.

The Larkins family had taken up their
residence in a small cottage on the road
to the Moorish Castle. Larkins
pÃ¨re
was
now principal barrack-sergeant, and as
such was entitled to fairly good quarters.
He had aged considerably since our first
acquaintance with him. His hair was grizzled,
his gait was stiff as though his ankle-joints
were affected by innumerable barrack
inspections, and his eyes were weak from
constant search for nail-holes or other barrack
damages, or the continuous appraisement
of fair wear and tear. Mrs. Larkins
had also changed appreciably. She was
still buxom, however, and her voice had
[203]

lost none of its shrill power when she was
aroused. This was more seldom than of
yore. Her children were no longer the
trial they had once been. The two eldest
boys were out in the world; Sennacherib
was in the band of a regiment at Malta, and
Rechab was at the same place on board a
man-of-war. Two younger ones, Ascanius
and Leonora, were still at home, and so was
Jemima Ann, familiarly called Mimie, now
a blooming maiden of nineteen, with a soft
voice, a sweet face, and eyes bright enough
to give the heart-ache to half the young
fellows of the place.

The old sergeant preceded Herbert into
the cottage, to prepare his wife for a surprise.

âSome one I know, Jonadab? Some
one Iâve not seen these years? A colour-sergeant
in the Dukeâs Own? What are
[204]

you driving at? I know no colour-sergeants;
for the matter of that none of the
Dukeâs Own,â Herbert heard her say as she
came to the door.

The moment she set eyes upon her
visitor she started and shook all over. She
seemed dazed, and could frame no word of
speech. Then all at once she gave way, and
taking Herbertâs hands in hers, drew him
towards her, kissing him again and again,
while tears of joy ran down her cheeks.

âWhat, Hercules, boy! My boy, my
own sweet boy! This is a sight for sore
eyes. Where have you dropped from, and
in this dress? Come in, boy, come in and
tell us all your news.â

And Herbert was led into the house.

Mimie came shyly forward when she
was called to add her welcome to the
brother she had almost forgotten. But she
[205]

offered him her cheek quite naturally, and
received a sisterâs salute, which, nevertheless,
sent the warm blood tingling through
her veins.

âYou are a sister to be proud of,â
said Herbert. âWhat a beauty you have
grown!â

âGrown!â interrupted Mrs. Larkins.
âItâs you whoâve grown out of all memory
almost, except to those who love you. But
now sit down and letâs know all about it.
What brought
you
to take the shilling?
and you never let on, not one word. You
might have written to us, Hercules. We,
Jonadab and me, have had you always in
our thoughts, thinking you were getting to
be a fine gentleman whoâd have nothing to
do with the likes of us.â

âAs if I could ever forget my mother.â

Mrs. Larkins made a gesture which
[206]

might have meant a strong negative to the
expression.

âWhen did you leave school? Why did
you enlist! You never wrote to us.â

âFour years ago. I was turned adrift
in the world, that was why. I wrote over
and over again to the Horse Guards, but
could not hear where you were.â

âAnd Lady Farrington, did she change
her mind, or what?â

âShe went mad, so they said, and they
locked her up in an asylum.â

âMad!â shouted the sergeant. âDidnât
I always tell you so? mad? She were
madder than Mike Horniblow who shot
the Maltee, and as mad as our old colonel
on an inspection parade.â

âHow was she locked up? who did it?
Letâs know all that,â said Mrs. Larkins.

Herbert recounted fully all that had
[207]

occurred. His leaving Deadham School,
the visit to the west country, Sir Rupert
Farringtonâs ill-treatment.

âSo thatâs what the poor soul was after!
Searching for a grandson to succeed to the
title and estates,â cried the sergeant. âAnd
you were the last that she found. Well:
itâs an ill wind, you know; leastways you
got the schooling, even if you are none of
her kith or kin.â

âI suppose I am not, really?â Herbert
asked, looking very hard at Mrs. Larkins,
who met the glance without lowering her
eyes. There was something in her expression
which Herbert immediately understood.
There must be an explanation between
them, but it could not take place then and
there.

âHow should you be?â asked the sergeant.
âDidnât I take you over with the
[208]

mother when I married her at York? The
widow Conlan, she was then, and you her
only child.â

âConlan is my name then?â

âBy rights, yes; but youâve took that
of Larkins now, and you are a credit to
it; so you may take it for what itâs worth,
and keep it till you can find a better.â

Was there ever a chance of that? Was
he really a Farrington after all, and might
he yet prove his claims? Of this no one
could give him a clue but Mrs. Larkins,
and he gathered from her manner that the
subject was one which she would only discuss
when they were alone. He had no
chance that time of speaking to her on this
the subject nearest his heart. The rest of
the evening was spent in the interchange
of personal news, as is the case when
friends and relatives meet after a long separation,
[209]

and there is so much on both
sides to tell and hear.

But Herbert went to the cottage next
day. The sergeant, fortunately, was at the
barrack-office; Mimie was out of the way,
and Mrs. Larkins had the house all to herself.

âI want to know all you can tell me,
mother. Is it not natural? To whom else
should I come? For you
are
my mother,
are you not?â

âNo mother could feel more warmly for
her child than I do for you, Hercules.â

âDo but tell me, plainly—I am really
your son?â

Mrs. Larkins was silent.

âIt is cruel to keep me in this suspense,
mother,—for you have been one to me always.
I implore you to tell me the whole
truth.â

[210]

âI will, Hercules, or Herbert as you
ought by rights to be called. It is a hard
matter to tell you all the tale, for there is
shame and sorrow in it enough, and that
for both you and me.

âI must begin at the beginning. Years,
years ago when I was a bit of a girl in my
fatherâs house, I and my twin sister Annie—whom
I loved dearly, as the apple of my
eye—father lived at Newark-on-Trent; he
was a small tradesman, but well enough to
do. Mother died when we were quite
chicks, and we grew up to have things
much our own way. Annie was a real
beauty, and had dozens of lads after her
always, but she never fancied none of them.
At last luck sent a recruiting party of the
12th Lancers to Newark. One of them
was a young corporal, as proper a chap as
ever took the shilling, fair spoken, well
[211]

educated, and superior to the common run.
He soon got courting our Annie, and he
was the first she favoured. Father did not
like it—not a bit. He hated soldiers, and
was very rough about Corporal Smith.
Annie and he had high words over it, and
one day she was not to be found.

âThe recruiters had left the town too.

âI wonât tell you what grief there was
at home. Father was like a madman, and
I was little better. He tried hard to get
her back. He went miles—to the other
end of England—after the regiment, but
he never caught them up. He was too
late. The regiment had been ordered off
to the Cape of Good Hope. Through the
rector, father wrote to the War Office, inquiring
after Corporal Smith and his wife.
The answer came months later, to say that
the corporal was alive and well, but that
[212]

he had no wife—at least no one according
to the regimental books.

âFather never held up his head after
that, and within the year he died. I was
nearly heart-broken too; but I was young,
and I bore up better. As I was all alone in
the world, and had the shop on my hands,
I took a husband, who offered just then—Michael
Conlan, a clerk in a maltsterâs at
Newark. He was a kindly soul, not over
strong, but he helped me in the business,
and we managed to get along.

âOne night Annie returned—not alone—she
had a child with her, her own, a few
months old only, and the two came, seeking
shelter and rest. It was as I thought
at first—the old story—betrayed, neglected,
left.â

âBut you took her in?â Herbert asked,
eagerly.

[213]

âOf course. Neither Michael nor myself
asked any questions; our duty was plain,
and it was one of love besides for me. All
I know is what Annie herself told me, and
that was not much. The corporal, it seems,
belonged really to a higher station in life.
He had quarrelled with his friends and left
his home, and wanted never to see or hear
of them again. But when Annieâs child
was born—â

âHe had married her?â

âAnnie would not acknowledge it; although
her silence told only against her
own sweet name. She wore a ring, but so
may any one; and as to all other proofs
she obstinately refused to speak. I pointed
out the hardship to her boy. She admitted
that, but said she had promised and could
not break her word. So I did not worry
her, but left her to speak in her own good
[214]

time. That time never came. Before Annie
had been back a week I saw she was not
long for this world. She pined and pined.
She looked eagerly for news from abroad,
but none came from where she sought it,
and the disappointment helped the disease
in bringing on the end.

âOn her death-bed I swore to be a
mother to her boy—â

âTo me?â said Herbert, no longer in
doubt; and as she nodded assent, he took
her hard hand and kissed it again and
again.

âAnd nobly you have fulfilled your
oath.â

âI did my best, Herbert. But I have
more to tell you. Your mother, just before
she died, gave me a letter. It was from
your father to his friends, and was only to
be sent to them at Annieâs death, or if she
[215]

was in dire distress. The letter was addressed
to Lady Farrington of Farrington
Hall. It was not sealed, and I thought I
might read what was inside. There were
only a few words: âFrom Herbert to his
mother—Be kinder to my boy.â I added a
few of your bright curls, Herbert, and sent
the letter on at once. But I gave no clue
as to where it had come from. I wanted
no answer. I was resolved to take no help
from any one in doing my duty by you. I
hated the whole of the Farringtons. I so
hated the name of Herbert even, that we
called you Hercules Albert instead.

âLater on I lost Michael, my first husband;
and I could not bear to remain in
Newark alone. I sold up the shop and my
belongings, and moved to York. It was
there, as Mrs. Conlan, a widow, with one
boy—you, Herbert—I met the Sergeant.
[216]

Things were not prospering with me. I
married him gladly, and he has been a
thorough good man to me.â

Herbertâs heart was too full for him to
speak for some time. Anger, disappointment,
anguish—all three feelings possessed
him. He was angry with his father, sore
at heart for his motherâs sorrow, disappointed
that there was no more to tell
him.

âDo you think there was a marriage,
mother?â

âI do. I always did.â

âIt all turns upon that. I may have
Farrington blood in me; but whether or no
would matter little if I was not entitled to
bear the name.â

âYou must make up your mind to your
disappointment, Herbert. What clue can
we get to the marriage after all these years?
[217]

Everybody who could speak to it is probably
dead.â

âMy father—perhaps he is still alive.â

âWould he not have sought us out
before this if he had been? But he has
never made a sign. Nothing but a miracle
could do you any good, my boy. Better be
contented as you are. And why should
you be cast down? You are young and
strong. You have been educated like a
gentleman; have made a first-rate start, and
have everything before you. Make a name
for yourself in the world if you can, and
donât pine after what others might have
given you.â

âHow is a mere sergeant to make himself
a name?â

âBy sticking to his colours and doing
his duty like a man. Non-commissioned
[218]

officers have got to the top of the tree
before now. Why should not you?â

âIf we could only have a chance of service—thereâs
no other hope for a soldier.
But we never have any fighting in these
days.â

âHow do you know? You be ready for
the chance when it offers, thatâs all youâve
got to do. Get a commission, and youâll
hold yourself as high as Sir Rupert then,
and meet him on equal terms.â

[219]

CHAPTER XIII.

FARRINGTON
SâAMUSE
.

It seemed as if fate had resolved to make
Gibraltar the gathering-place of those with
whom Herbert Larkins was destined to be
most closely concerned. Not long after
the rencontre with his best friends, the Larkinsâ,
the news came that General Prioleau
had been appointed to the command of the
Infantry Brigade upon the Rock. Before
the year was out, the former colonel of the
Dukeâs Own arrived with his wife and little
Edith, now fast growing into a beautiful
and attractive girl.

It was not long before Herbert saw
her, and had an opportunity of noticing the
change.

[220]

General Prioleau, like many others of
his rank, had a strong affection for his old
corps, a sort of sneaking regard which,
although it did him all honour, led him to
wish that he still commanded it, and to
act very much as if he did. He was not
the first general officer who, entrusted with
the charge of several battalions, narrowed
his interest to the one in which he had
himself served. To dry-nurse the Dukeâs
Own on field days, to take an active share
in its interior economy, to watch over its
mess and all that appertained to the credit
of the regiment, and generally to be as intimately
associated with it as though he
were still its colonel, were delights he could
not forego. He was continually sending
for Colonel Diggle to talk matters over, an
interference which the great Cavendish resented,
but was prohibited from protesting
[221]

against, by the rules of the service. Mrs.
Diggle was not, and took full advantage of
her exemption from the restrictions of military
etiquette, to the extent of soundly
abusing the general upon every occasion.
Not that General Prioleau much cared. He
did not command Mrs. Cavendish-Diggle,
and directly he had made her acquaintance
in her new character, he was heartily glad
that he did not.

The general also visited the barracks of
his old regiment repeatedly, on one excuse
or another, but always with the avowed
and really sincere intention of doing it a
good turn. Now it was the reappropriation
of quarters. Now the examination of
drainage. Now the inspection of the married
quarters or the canteen. Edith almost
invariably accompanied him. She was in
her element out here upon the Rock. The
[222]

rÃ´le
she now played was even more delightful
than that of daughter of the regiment.
There was much more importance and more
movement in it. More variety too, and more
power. Instead of knowing one regiment
only, she now knew half a dozen. The
circle of her acquaintance widened, and her
military knowledge, such as it was. But
her heart was with her first love always—the
Dukeâs Own. When the general inspected
the old regiment, she stayed by his
side through it all. They made her go in
to lunch, much to quiet Mrs. Prioleauâs indignation
when she heard of it; she sat on
her pony close by the general, and, to judge
by her remarks, seemed to take an active
part in the whole proceedings. She kept
up a running fire of comments.

âThereâs Mr. Wheeler; why, heâs getting
quite old. And the sergeant-major,
[223]

heâs gray; why do they keep him so long,
father? He must be past his work before
this. And Colonel Diggle—is he a
good

colonel, father?
I
donât think so. Well,
as you say, perhaps Iâm not a judge of
colonels, but I am of gentlemen, and I donât
call him a gentleman—not a real gentleman—do
you?â

âMy dear,â the general said reprovingly,
âyou are a little too fast. Please remember—â

âHeâs not a gentleman according to my
ideas. There are lots of better gentlemen
in the ranks—why,â almost with a shriek,
âthereâs my friend the learned pig—I mean
the learned orderly. And, father, look! do
look! Theyâve made him a colour-sergeant—already!â

But her father was not attending.

âBe good enough to form open column,
[224]

pile arms, and lay out kits,â he was saying
to Colonel Diggle, which manÅuvre satisfactorily
carried out, the general continued
his inspection on foot, accompanied by his
daughter, who tripped along, holding up
her habit, nodding to old friends as she
went along, and so deeply interested in
holdalls, tins of blacking, and pairs of socks,
that you might have thought kit inspection
was the one joy of her life.

âI am very glad to see youâve got on so
quickly,â she said gravely to young Colour-Sergeant
Larkins, as she touched him on
the arm with her whip by way of emphasis.
âYou promised well, and I am pleased to
think I was not disappointed,â went on the
young personage, with the air of a queen-regnant
reviewing her troops.

It was a gracious sight, and one no man—an
impressionable young sergeant like
[225]

Larkins least of all—was likely to forget.
The trim figure in its snow-white habit,
the pretty bright face and its framework
of light curls, surmounted with a coquettish
little white hat; the air with which
she pointed with her whip to his chevrons
and the bright colours surmounting them,
as she tripped daintily along. Never before
or afterwards did Edith Prioleau seem
more bewitching, and Herbert Larkins felt
that he could lay down his life for her then
and there.

Perhaps he talked a little more about
her than he need have done when he next
visited the cottage near the Moorish Castle.
The Larkinsâ house had come to be quite
his home, and he went there whenever he
was off duty and could spare time. Life
upon the Rock was a little monotonous for
all below the rank of officer, and Herbert
[226]

was thankful that he had friends in the
place. The narrow limits of the fortress,
beyond which none but the commissioned
may pass except on rare occasions, and
then only by special permission, forbade
any great variety of amusement or much
change of scene. The rank and file rung
the changes upon guard-house and drinking
shop; when the first was done with for a
time they identified themselves with the
other. After twenty-four hours on Ragged
Staff or New Mole, at Landport, Waterport,
or the North Front, there was an especial
sweetness for the soldier in âblack strapâ or
âpartridge eyeâ—variations of the local
wine; while for the fireproof head which
craved for the strongest stimulants, there
was the
aguardiente
, or burning water, a
title this engaging but curiously potent
liquid richly deserved. For the sergeants,
[227]

in whom steadiness and sobriety were indispensable
traits, these delights were forbidden,
and they had but little relaxation
after they had completed their dayâs routine,
including the preparation of small
returns, the responsibilities of minor commands,
beyond a stroll upon the Alameda
when the band played, or the perusal of
the newspapers in the mess.

Herbert was more fortunate. Fond of
books, Major Greathed supplied him with
plenty, mainly of professional character,
for although still in subordinate grades,
soldiering was becoming more and more to
our heroâs taste, and he was eager to qualify
for higher charges should it ever be his
good fortune to rise. But it was greater
pleasure to him still to talk at the cottage
over what he had read; to pour forth to
his mother, as he still called her, his ambitious
[228]

yearnings, to express with increasing
vehemence his vain regrets that he had
not lived in another country and another
age.

âI wish I had been a Frenchman in the
last century! No soldiers had such chances!
One day a private, the next commanding a
brigade. Youâll never see such things in
our service.â

âDonât be cast down, Herbert,â said
warm-hearted sympathetic Mrs. Larkins.
âYour chance will come if youâll only wait.â

âYes, wait till Iâm grey-haired. And
when it comes whatâll it be? They may
make me a quartermaster at fifty, or a second
lieutenant at forty-five. I want my cake
now, when itâs sweet and I am fit to enjoy it.â

âAnd offer half to some one else? Is
that what youâre dreaming about?â asked
Mrs. Larkins, with a sigh.

[229]

âPsha! A generalâs daughter, a mere
child too! What absurdity to talk like
that! No; I prefer to keep to my own
station.â

Mrs. Larkins said nothing, but silence
is sometimes more eloquent than words;
and Mimie Larkins, who was present,
looked up with a quick blush, which any
man whose heart was touched would have
interpreted his own way. The fiction of
the relationship between these two had long
since melted away. Good Mrs. Larkins,
who had hated herself for keeping a
secret from her husband, had told him the
whole story very soon after Herbert had
learnt the truth. Mimie, too, soon knew
that the handsome sergeant who had kissed
her and called her sister was really only a
cousin, and as things went a very eligible

parti
.

[230]

Perhaps Mrs. Larkins, womanlike, was
a matchmaker too. Why should she not
encourage it? Herbert and her Mimie
were cut out for each other; and if in the
long run he should come into his own, why
should not her daughter share his good
fortune? Herbert was himself on the point
of accepting the situation and succumbing
to his fate. Mimie was attractive in no ordinary
degree. She was a bright-eyed, sweet-voiced
girl, with a gentle confiding manner,
and very light-hearted ways. But then
Herbert thought of his great aims, of the
object of his life. To marry at all, at his
age, would be to tie a millstone around his
neck, a folly from which he would never
recover.

When a man thinks thus, there is but
little fear of his falling desperately in love.
Then came the vision of the little lady, at
[231]

present so far above him in station, and
he found himself drawing comparisons in
which poor Mimie Larkins came off second-best.

For a time she resented it very bitterly.
Mimieâs was a simple impulsive nature;
she was of a yielding malleable disposition,
readily amenable to better influences, but
she was also, like every daughter of Eve,
fond of admiration and grieved when it
was denied. Her heart was ready to go
out to Herbert the moment she knew he
was not her brother, and as time passed
and he made no sign, she grew more and
more discontented and cross. Now, his
loud praises of this Miss Prioleau made her
angrier than ever. Little minx, why did
she come poaching upon other peopleâs
preserves? Oh, for a chance of showing
Herbert that others were not so blind as he!

[232]

The chance came—all too soon. It was
at a sergeantsâ ball that Ernest Farrington
first crossed her path, and threw himself at
once, metaphorically, at her feet. His attentions
were perfectly respectful, but very
marked, and Mimie was more than flattered
by them. Here indeed was a chance of
spiting Herbert! and she availed herself
of it to the full, forgetting, in the pleasure
it gave her, the terrible risk she ran. Her
clandestine relations with young Farrington,
who was not slow to follow up his
advantage, had already become far too intimate
to promise well for her peace of mind,
when Herbert discovered all.

He taxed her with meeting Mr. Farrington
alone upon the Alameda.

She tossed her head, first disdaining to
reply, then saucily asking what business it
was of his.

[233]

âI shall tell your mother at once.â

âOh, donât, donât, please donât do that!
It would kill her if she knew. Iâll promise
never to meet him again. Oh, Herbert, do
not get me into such terrible trouble—you,
of all people, to do it too! I didnât think
you could be so mean.â

Herbert was over-persuaded; at least,
he was induced to spare Mrs. Larkins for
the present and determined to try first an
appeal to the other side.

He went to the colonel, Diggle, and
told him all.

âReally, my good fellow,â said the colonel,
âitâs no affair of mine. They donât belong
to the regiment, you see. I cannot
interfere. I am not answerable for Mr.
Farringtonâs morals. Iâm not indeed.â

Herbert was not to be done. He spoke
[234]

next to Ernest, the first time he got a
chance.

âDamn it, sir, what business is it of
yours?â asked the officer hotly.

âItâs very much my business. She is
my sister—at least we were brought up
together as such,â the sergeant no less hotly
replied.

âThen why donât you speak to her instead
of to me?â

âBecause I thought an appeal to you as
a gentleman,â—there was a plain sneer in
his intonation—âwhich I fancied you were,
would have the desired effect.â

âDo you dare to say I am not a gentleman?
By George, Iâll—â

âI dare do more than that. Listen to
me, Mr. Farrington; I swear you shall not
do her harm. Iâll break every bone in your
body.â

[235]

âThis is rank mutiny, by George. Iâve
a good mind to put you in arrest. Do you
dare to threaten your superior officer, sir?â
and Ernest walked off as the simplest way
of ending the discussion.

Herbert had one other card to play.
He wrote a full account of the whole affair
to Sir Rupert Farrington, and signed his
name.

Sir Rupert would probably have cared
as little for Ernestâs proceedings, from the
moral point of view, as did Diggle, but he
had a not unnatural dread of entanglements,
especially where so weak a person as his
son was concerned. Moreover, although
enraged against Larkins, and somewhat
uneasy at the tone of the letter in which
Herbert made pointed reference to his
claims, and hinted mysteriously at certain
close relations between the Larkinsâ and
[236]

Farringtons, Sir Rupert felt it wisest not
to enlighten Diggle further. He satisfied
himself with writing at once to his son-in-law,
begging him to let Ernest have leave
and send him home. This Diggle did, without
other reason than that Sir Rupert
wished it, and Ernest, very obediently as it
seemed, fell into the trap.

The young gentleman was, however,
deeper than they gave him credit for being.
He went home by the next mail, but Mimie
Larkins followed him within a week, as
soon as she could give her unhappy parents
the slip; and thus, for the second time,
Mrs. Larkins had reason to curse the Farrington
name.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

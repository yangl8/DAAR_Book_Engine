INTRODUCTION

John Oldmixon's
Essay on Criticism
, like his
Reflections on Dr.
Swift's Letter to the Earl of Oxford, about the English Tongue
,
[1]

provides evidence to support Dr. Johnson's description of its author
as a "scribbler for a party," and indicates that Oldmixon must have
been devoted to gathering examples of what appeared to him to be the
good and bad in literature.

The story of the appearance of the
Essay on Criticism
in 1728
should begin in 1724, when Oldmixon published in one volume his

Critical History of England, Ecclesiastical and Civil
. Dr. Zachary
Grey's criticism of this book was answered by Oldmixon in 1725 in

A Review of Dr. Zachary Grey's Defence of our Ancient and Modern
Historians
. In 1726 a two-volume edition of the
Critical History of
England
appeared with the 1725 edition of the
Review of Dr. Zachary
Grey's Defence
appended to the first volume. In the preface to the
second volume of the
Critical History
Oldmixon referred to the
Essay
on Criticism
, stating that it was ready for the press, but that since it
would have made the second volume too large, it would be published
at a later date. The
Essay
, he stated, was to prepare the public for his
translation of Abbe Bouhours'
La Manière De Bien Penser
. It was not,
however, until 1728 that the
Essay
reached the public. Besides appearing
separately, it was appended, in place of the now removed answer to
Dr. Grey, to the "third" edition of the
Critical History
.
[2]
There is no
reference to the addition of the
Essay
in the preface to the first volume,
but its appearance and addition is referred to in the preface to the second
volume.

Oldmixon seems to have had more than one purpose for writing the

Essay
; one of them is made quite clear in the second paragraph:

I shall not, in this
Essay
, enter into the philosophical
Part of Criticism which
Corneille
complains of, and that

Aristotle
and his Commentators have treated of Poetry,
rather as
Philosophers
than Poets. I shall not attempt to
give Reasons why Thoughts are
sublime
,
noble
,
delicate
,

agreeable
, and the like, but content my self with producing
Examples of every Kind of right Thinking, and leave
it to Authors of more Capacity and Leisure, to treat the
[Pg ii]

Matter
à Fond
, and teach us to imitate our selves what
we admire in others.

The remarks concerning the English need for guidance in "right
thinking" are obviously intended to prepare a public for Oldmixon's
translation of Bouhours'
La Manière De Bien Penser
. Following the
method of Bouhours, who was in turn following Longinus, Oldmixon
gives examples from English literature of the various divisions of
"right thinking" and, also like Bouhours, he includes specimens of
failures in this art. The bad examples he presents provide ample
evidence that the Essay was also serving a Whig polemical purpose,
for they are drawn from such writers as Clarendon, Pope and, in particular,
Laurence Echard. The tone and nature of Oldmixon's remarks
on Echard, whose History he had already criticized at length in the
second volume of the
Critical History
, can be seen in this explanation
of his general treatment of that author:

I must sincerely acknowledge, that it was not for Want
of Will, that I did not mention what is beautiful in our
Historian, but for Want of Opportunity.

Oldmixon's remarks on Pope's
Homer
are sometimes laudatory,
but more often patronizing; the criticism of Pope's
Essay on Criticism

is quite pointed:

I dare not say any Thing of the last
Essay on Criticism

in Verse, but that if any more curious Reader has discovered
in it something new, which is not in Dryden's

Prefaces
,
Dedications
, and his
Essay on Dramatick
Poetry
, not to mention the
French
Criticks, I should be
very glad to have the Benefit of the Discovery.

The rift between Pope and Oldmixon can perhaps be dated from the
publication by the latter in 1714 of the "Receipt to make a cuckold"
with great apologies for its indecency. Oldmixon continued to tempt
satiric fate in the ensuing years, and one wonders if, when seeking a
substitute for the
Dunciad
in the "last"
Miscellany
of 1728, Pope may
not have remembered Oldmixon's announcement in 1726 of his intention
to publish an
Essay on Criticism
which was to be written after
[Pg iii]

the manner of Bouhours. It is not impossible that this was one of many
influences acting upon Pope to organize the "high flights of poetry" he
had been collecting over the years for a Scriblerian project. Oldmixon
appears, with Gildon and Dennis, among the porpoises in Chapter VI of

Peri Bathous
, and the presentation of some of the material in the

Bathous
, although more directly indebted to Longinus, does bring Oldmixon's

Essay
to mind.

It would seem that Oldmixon felt that more than the porpoises referred
to him, for in his translation and adaptation of Bouhours'
La
Manière De Bien Penser
, which he published under the title of
The
Arts of Logic and Rhetorick
later in 1728, the references to Pope are
much harsher, and Swift also comes under more pointed attack.

Gulliver's Travels
,
A Tale of A Tub
(already censured by Oldmixon
in his
Reflections on Dr. Swift's Letter
), the
Essay on Criticism
,

Windsor Forest
and the
Homer
are the objects of bitter criticism. In
the concluding pages of
The Arts of Logic and Rhetorick
Oldmixon
wrote:

This delicate Author [Pope] has written a
rhiming
Essay on Criticism
, and made himself merry with his
Brethren in a notable Treatise call'd the
Art of Sinking
,
to which he and his Partner S——t, have contributed,
more than all the rest of their contemporary writers, if

Trifling
and
Grimace
are not in the high Parts of Writing....
What a Precipice is it from Locke's Human Understanding
to Swift's Lilliput and Profundity!... there
might have been Hopes of rising again; but we sink now
like Ships laden with Lead, and must despair of ever recovering
the Height from which we have fallen.
[3]

As we move from Oldmixon's
Essay on Criticism
to Pope's
Peri
Bathous
and on to
The Arts of Logic and Rhetorick
, we perhaps hear
the stretching of the spring on a trap, that snapped in the 1735 edition
of the
Dunciad
, in which Oldmixon replaced Dennis as the "Senior"
diver "Who but to sink the deeper, rose the higher."
[4]

The
Essay on Criticism
is, however, more than an example of the
inter-relation of literature and politics in the eighteenth century; and
it is more than a step on the way to its author's immortalizing in lead.
[Pg iv]

It presents, albeit not very imaginatively, a statement of many of the
literary theories and attitudes of the Augustan period. However brief
and incomplete, the remarks about the language of poetry and upon the
effects of certain literary passages are of interest as imperfect exercises
in a type of practical criticism. The material used by Oldmixon
and the literary references he makes indicate, as do many of his other
writings, that, although he was a "scribbler for a party," he was a man
of some literary sense, taste and intelligence.

AN

ESSAY

ON

CRITICISM;

As it regards

Design, Thought, and Expression,

in Prose and Verse
.

I am very far from any Conceit of my
own Ability, to treat of so nice a
Subject as this, in a Manner worthy
of it; but having frequently observed
what Errors have been committed by
both Writers and Readers for want
of a right Judgement, I could not
help collecting some loose Hints I
had by me, and putting them into a
little Form, to shew rather what I would do than what
I can do; and to excite some happier Genius, to give
us better Lights than we have hitherto been led by,
which is said with great Sincerity, and without the least
Mixture of Vanity or Affectation.

[Pg 2]
I
shall not, in this
Essay
, enter into the philosophical
Part of Criticism which
Corneille
complains of, and that

Aristotle
and his Commentators have treated of Poetry,
rather as
Philosophers
than
Poets
. I shall not attempt to
give Reasons why Thoughts are
sublime
,
noble
,
delicate
,

agreeable
, and the like, but content my self with producing
Examples of every Kind of right Thinking, and
leave it to Authors of more Capacity and Leisure, to
treat the Matter a
Fond
, and teach us to imitate our
selves what we admire in others.

Aristotle
,
Horace
,
Bossu
,
Boileau
,
Dacier
, and several
other Criticks, have directed us right in the Rules of
Epick and Dramatick Poetry, and
Rapin
has done the
same as to
History
, and other Parts of polite Learning.
Several Attempts have been made in
England
to instruct
us, as well as the
French
have been instructed;
but far from striking out any new Lights, our
Essays

are infinitely short of the Criticisms of our Neighbours.
They teach us nothing which is not to be found there,
and give us what they take thence curtailed and imperfect.
'Tis true, they have drest up their Rules in Verse,
and have succeeded in it very well. There is something
so just and beautiful in my Lord
Roscommon
's Essay and
Translation of
Horace
's
Ars Poetica
, as excels any Thing
in
French
within the like Compass. I have read the
late Duke of
Buckingham
's Essay very often, but I don't
think it such a perfect Piece as
Dryden
represents it, in
his long and tedious Dedication to that noble Lord before
the
Æneis
. There are many Things very well
thought in it, and they do not seem to be much the
better for the Poetry; which is so prosaick, that if the
Rhimes were pared away, it would be reduced to downright
Prose. Indeed
Horace
's Epistle to the
Piso's
is
not much more poetick; and I do not think, that the
modern Criticks, like the Oracles of Old, give the
greater Sanction to their Rules, for that they are
put into Rhime.

I dare not say any Thing of the last
Essay
on
Criticism

in Verse, but that if any more curious Reader
has discovered in it something new, which is not in

Dryden
's
Prefaces
,
Dedications
, and his
Essay
on
Dramatick
Poetry
, not to mention the
French
Criticks, I
should be very glad to have the Benefit of the Discovery.
[Pg 3]

I was strangely surprised to meet with such a Passage,
as what follows, in the Writings of so good an Author
as Sir
Robert Howard
.
Preface
to Duke of
Lerma
:
"In the Difference of Tragedy and Comedy, there
can be no Determination but by the
Taste
; and whoever
would endeavour to like or dislike by the Rules
of others, he will be as unsuccessful as if he should try
to be perswaded into a Power of believing, not what
he must, but what others direct him to believe."

Thus are
Aristotle
,
Horace
, and all that have commented
on them; thus are
Boileau
, the Lord
Roscommon
,
the Duke of
Bucks
, and all the modern Criticks,
confounded with a Word or two, and the Rules of
Writing rendered useless and ridiculous.

The Rules laid down by those great Criticks are not
to be valu'd, because they are given by
Aristotle
,
Horace
,
&c. but because they are in Nature and in Truth.
Homer
,

Sophocles
, and
Euripides
, wrote before
Aristotle
, and
the Observations he made upon their Poems, were to
shew us how they succeeded by a happy Imitation of
Nature, and without such Imitation there can be no
Poetry; but according to Sir
Robert Howard
's Assertion,
that only which a Man likes is good; and if you are
pleas'd with seeing or hearing any Thing unnatural or
even monstruous,

A Woman's Head joyn'd to a Fishes Tail;

it is preferable to what is just and true, to the
Venus
of

Medicis
, or the most perfect
Madonna
in
Italy
. Thus a
wrong Taste is as good as a right one, and the Smell
of a Pole-cat to be preferr'd to that of a
Civet
, if a
Man's Nose is so irregular. After this Rate, there never
was a Poet who could write up to the
Frenchman
's
Ladder-dance, or
Rich
's Harlequin; and whereas Sir

Robert
says, we may as well believe, because others do,
as judge, because
Aristotle
,
Horace
, &c. do, there is no
Agreement in the Proposition, or it is not rightly stated;
for we do not judge so because
Aristotle
and
Horace
did so
judge; but because it is in Nature and in Truth, and they
first shew'd us the Way to find it out.

Criticism is so far from being well understood by us

Englishmen
, that it is generally mistaken to be an Effect
of Envy, Jealousy, and Spleen; an invidious Desire to
[Pg 4]

find Faults only to discredit the Author, and build a Reputation
on the Ruin of his.

One has great Reason to think so, when the Critick
looks only on one Side; when he hunts after little Slips
and Negligences, and will not, or cannot see, what is
beautiful and praise-worthy. If an historical or poetical
Performance can no sooner acquire Applause, than he falls
upon it without Mercy, neglects every Thing commendable
in it, and skims off the Filth that rises on the Top of
it; one may be sure his Jealousy is piqu'd, and he is
alarm'd for fear every Encrease of Honour to another
should be a Diminution of his own Glory; such Sort of
Criticism is easily learnt. A Wen or Mole in the Face is
sooner perceiv'd than the Harmony of Features, and the
fine Proportion of Beauty; or, as
Dryden
says,

Errours like Straws upon the Surface flow,

He who would search for Pearls must dive below.

This Thought is borrow'd from the Lord
Bacon
; who,
speaking of Notions and Inferences what may be applied
to Families, says,
Time is like a River in which Metals
and solid Substances sink, while Chaff and Straw swim on
the Surface
. Such borrowing as
Dryden
's is highly commendable;
he has paid back what he borrowed with Interest,
and it can by no Means deserve the Scandal of

Plagiarism
. I cannot doubt, but Mr.
Addison
in the
sublime Thought, where he represents the Duke of
Marlborough

in the Heat of the War:

Rides in the Whirlwind, and directs the Storm;

did nor forget these two Lines of
Boileau
to the King:

Serene himself the stormy War he guides,

And o'er the Battle like a God presides.

I shall all along, through this Discourse, take the Liberty
to pass from one Subject to another as the Hint offers,
without any Method, according to the Freedom of
Essays
.
Mr.
Dryden
excuses this Freedom, by the Example of

Horace
's Epistle to the
Piso's
, which is immethodical and
I must excuse my self by Mr.
Dryden
's—

The Taste and Appetite of these straw Criticks, may
justly be compar'd to Ravens and Crows, who neglecting
clean Food, are always searching after Carrion.

[Pg 5]
Horace
's
Rule is very well worth observing, when we are
about to give Judgement on a Poem or History, where
the
Will
is not concern'd:

Ubi plura nitent in Carmine non ego paucis

Offendor maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,

Aut humana parum cavit natura.

When in a Poem most are shining Thoughts,

I'm not offended if I find some Fau'ts;

Such as are Slips of Negligence, or where

The Poet may through humane Frailty erre.

As it is much easier to discern Blemishes than Beauties,
so is it to censure than to commend, as the Duke of

Buckingham
tells us:

Yet whatsoe'er is by vain Criticks thought,

Praising is harder much than finding Fau't:

In homely Pieces ev'n the
Dutch
excel,

Italians
only can draw Beauty well.

Such Criticks need not be in Pain, if a Poem or History
makes its Way in the World a little; if it is not good,
it will lose Ground of it self faster than it got it. If imperfect
Pieces have gain'd Credit, and kept it for some
Time, it was not for what was bad in them, but what, if
not really good, was at least agreeable.
Dryden
's Translation
of
Virgil
was generally liked for the Diction and Versification,
though it was dislik'd on Account of Equality
and Truth; and to have made a
Critick
upon it, as
Milbourn

did, without doing justice to his Numbers and Language,
shew'd the Spirit of the Man was more engaged
in it than his Judgement. All Criticisms on
Dryden
's
Language and Numbers are in Defiance of
Horace
's Rule
above-mention'd, because there is no Body but knows
that it was impossible for
Dryden
to make an ill Verse,
or to want an apt and musical Word, if he took the least
Care about it. I could very easily mark out a thousand
Slips and Negligences of that Kind in his
Virgil
; yet for
all that, there are more good Verses in that Translation
than in any other, if Mr.
Pope
's
Homer
is not to be excepted.

It has been often said by very good Judges, that
Cato

was no proper Subject for a Dramatick Poem: That the
[Pg 6]

Character of a Cynick Philosopher, is very inconsistent
with the Hurry and Tumult of Action and Passion, which
are the Soul of Tragedy. That the ingenious Author
miscarried in the Plan of his Work, but supported it by
the Dignity, the Purity, the Beauty, and the Justness of
the Sentiments and the Diction.

This was so much the Opinion of Mr.
Maynwaring
, who
was generally allow'd to be the best Critick of our Time, that
he was against bringing the Play upon the Stage, and
it lay by unfinish'd many Years. Mr.
Maynwaring
highly
approv'd of the Sentiments and the Diction, but did
not fall in with the Design. That it was play'd at last
was owing to Mr.
Hughes
, who wrote the
Siege of Damascus
,
a Tragedy. He had read the Four Acts, which
were finished, and rightly thought it would be of Service
to the Publick, to have it represented at the latter End of
Queen
Ann
's Reign, when the old
English
Spirit of Liberty
was as likely to be lost as it had ever been since the
Conquest. He endeavour'd to bring Mr.
Addison
into
his Opinion, which he did so far as to procure his Consent,
that it should be acted if Mr.
Hughes
would write
the last Act, and he offer'd him the Scenary for his Assistance,
excusing his not finishing it himself on Account
of some other Avocations. He prest Mr.
Hughes
to do
it so earnestly, that he was prevail'd upon and set about it.
But a Week after, seeing Mr.
Addison
again with an Intention
to communicate to him what he had thought of it,
he was agreeably surpris'd at his producing some Papers,
where near half of the Act was written by the Author
himself, who took Fire at the Hint that it would be serviceable,
and upon a second Reflection went thorough
with the Fifth Act: Not that he was diffident of Mr.

Hughes
's Ability, but knowing that no Man could have
so perfect a Notion of his Design as himself, who had
been so long and so carefully thinking of it. I was told
this by Mr.
Hughes
, and I tell it to shew that it was not for
the
Love
Scenes, that Mr.
Addison
consented to have his
Tragedy acted, but to support the old
Roman
and
English

Publick Spirit, which was then so near being suppressed
by Faction and Bigotry. The most cunning of their
Leaders were sensible of it, and therefore very dexterously
stole away the Merit of the Poem, by applauding the
Poet, and patronizing the Action and Actors. It is there
[Pg 7]
fore
obvious, that a severe Critick may find a Colour for
his Severity, with Respect to the
Design
of the Play, but
that will not hinder its captivating every one that sees or
reads it. The Graces and Excellencies, both of Thought
and Expression, do much more deserve our Admiration
and Applause, than the Deficiency in the Fable deserves
Censure. However, as to
Dryden
's
Virgil
and
Cato
, ask
those that admire the one or the other what it is that
pleases them? And I doubt it will be found to be the
very Places, which should have most displeased, where

Dryden
offended most against the Character of Epick
Poetry by imitating
Ovid
's Softness, and an eternal
Jeu
des Mots
,
Playing upon Words
, and where
Cato
suspends
the Action and Passion of the Scene to teach the Audience,
Philosophy and Morality.

It is common for the most discreet and delicate Authors
to take Care of themselves, when they are treating
of any of the Sciences. You will always find the Divine,
the Lawyer, the Mathematician, the Astrologer, the
Chymist, the Mechanick,
&c.
reserving to themselves
the Merit of their particular Sciences when they are discoursing
of the Arts in general. A merry Instance of this
in the
Astrologer
is mention'd by the very learned
Gregory

out of
Albumazer
, who asserted, that all Religions
were govern'd by the Planets; the
Mahometan
by
Venus
,
the
Jewish
by
Saturn
, and the
Christian
by the
Sun
:
Nay, he adds, that one
Guido Bonatus
a
Gymnosophist

affirms in his Parallells, that
Christ himself was an Astrologer,
and made use of Elections
. The
Spectator
, with
all his Modesty, has discover'd something of this Self-love
in that of the Sciences, and could not help giving
into this Infirmity. Every one knows what a fine Talent
he had for Writing, and particularly how beautiful his
Imagination was, and how polite his Language. Himself
was not a Stranger to it; and we therefore read in
the
Spectator
, N
o
291;
I might further observe, that there
is not a
Greek
or
Latin
Critick, who has not shewn, even
in the Stile of his Criticisms, that he was Master of all
the Elegance and Delicacy of his native Language
. Here
does this excellent Author forbid any one's Claim to the
Character of a Critick, who is not like himself Master
of the Delicacy and Elegance of his native Tongue;
though I am apt to believe, that as a Man may be a
[Pg 8]

very good Judge of Painting without being himself a
Painter, so he may make very good Criticisms in Poetry
and Eloquence, without being a Poet or an Orator. What
would have become of our famous Critick
Rymer
, whom
Mr.
Dryden
has so much commended, and so much
abused, if his Criticisms must not pass, on Account of his
not being Master of the Elegance and Delicacy of our
Language, as it does not appear he was by his Translation
of
Ovid
's Epistle from
Penelope
to
Ulysses
.

Here skulk'd
Ulysses
.

Your Sword how
Dolon
no nor
Rhesus
'scap'd,

Banter'd the One, this taken as he napp'd.

Whatever Skippers hither come ashore,

For thee I ask and ask them o'er and o'er.

Perhaps to her your dowdy Wife define

Who cares no more, so that her Cupboard shine:

Who revel in your House without Controul,

And eat and waste your Means our Blood and Soul.

The
Bantring
and
Napping
, the
Skipper
, the
Dowdy
Wife
, the
Cupboard
, the
Means
, and the
Blood
and
Soul
,
agree admirably with the Royal Characters of King

Ulysses
and Queen
Penelope
, and the courtly Manner of

Ovid
.
Radcliff
's Letter, from the Skipper's Wife of
Newcastle

to her Husband at
St. Catherine
's, can hardly have
more of the Burlesque in it.

The Truth is, Mr.
Addison
, in the above Quotation,
has a Fling upon the Author of the Critick upon his
Cato
.

A few general Rules extracted out of the
French
Authors,
with a certain Cant of Words, have sometimes set up an illiterate
heavy Writer, for a most judicious and formidable Critick.

I know no Instance wherein that Gentleman loses his
Temper so much as in this. There were but three Authors
in our Time who were
Criticks
by Profession,
Rymer
,

Dennis
, and
Gildon
.
Rymer
is own'd by himself to be
a masterly Critick: He himself knew Mr.
Dennis
did not
want Learning; and as to Fire, he has perhaps rather
too much of it, than too little. I can't help thinking,
that the Ode he writ on
Dryden
's Translation of the 3d
Book of the
Georgicks
, in
Tonson
's Fourth Miscellany, deserv'd
a kinder Word than illiterate or heavy.

[Pg 9]

Stanza II.

Sometimes of humble rural Things

My Muse, which keeps great
Maro
still in sight,

In middle Air with varied Numbers sings;

And sometimes her sonorous Flight

To Heaven sublimely wings.

But first takes Time with Majesty to rise

Then, without Pride, divinely great

She mounts her native Skies;

And Goddess-like retains her State

When down again she flies.

The Passage, taken out of the
Spectator
, could not
relate to
Gildon
, because of the
French
Cant, which he
did not affect, nor understand. It is plain therefore, it
must refer to the Critick upon
Cato
; which shews us,
that as conscious as the most modest Man may be of his
own Insufficiency; yet, when it is in Dispute, he cannot
always preserve his Insensibility.
Cato
is a very good
Dramatick

Poem, and so was the
Cid
; yet the best
Critick

that ever was written in
French
, was that upon the
Cid
,
as
La Bruyere
observes.

In another of the
Spectators
, we meet with something
which proves to us, that a Man may have as much Modesty
as Mr.
Addison
; and yet be very jealous of losing any Part
of the Glory which is due to him. Every one knows,
that though he was a Master of Eloquence, he never attempted
to speak in Parliament, but it was with some
Confusion; and what he said, did not answer the Expectation
which had been raised by the Character of his
Writings. Himself takes notice of this, not as an Infirmity,
but as the Effect of Caution and Art.
Spectator
,
N
o
231, Cicero tells us, that he never liked an Orator,

who did not appear in some little Confusion at the Beginning
of his Speech; and confesses, that he himself never
entered upon an Oration without Trembling and Concern.
It is indeed a Kind of Deference which is due to a great
Assembly. The bravest Man often appears timorous upon
these Occasions, as we may observe that there is generally
no Creature more impudent than a Coward.
I hope I shall
not be thought invidious, or to endeavour to lessen the
Veneration, which all, who love polite Learning, owe to
[Pg 10]

the Memory of the
Spectator
; yet I could not but take
notice, how sensible the most Discreet are in Point of Rivalship
in Fame. What else can one think of the
Spectator
's
Saying in the Dedication of the Eighth Volume:

I need not tell you, that the free and disengaged Behaviour
of a fine Gentleman, makes as many aukward
Beaux
, as
the Easiness of your Favourite
Waller
hath made insipid
Poets.
Though the
fine Gentleman
may be applied to
Mr.
Waller
, and the
aukward Beaux
to the insipid Poets;
yet the Comparison cannot hold, without doing an Injury
to Mr.
Waller
's Merit. The
Beaux
may be aukward, by
imitating what you call a
fine Gentleman
, who is generally
distinguish'd by some Affectation; but no Poet can
be insipid by imitating Mr.
Waller
's Easiness, if he has
any Portion of his Wit and Gallantry. The
Spectator
's
Manner was not very different from Mr.
Waller
's, as to
Easiness; and I have as often heard it wished, that there
was more Fire in his own Poetry, as that there was more
in Mr.
Waller
's. Two of the politest Authors in
Europe
,
of the last Age, St.
Evremont
and
La Fontaine
, had
such an Esteem for Mr.
Waller
, that it is strange he meets
with no better Quarter at Home. Those two famous

French
Wits us'd to call him another
Anacreon
; and the
Criticks have not yet complained, that ever
Anacreon

taught any Poet to be insipid. Mr.
Addison
is so far from
thinking that
Waller
had any such Infection about him,
that he wishes he had lived to have sung in Praise of
King
William
, the sublimest Subject that ever was offered
to a Muse, by how much the Deliverer of Nations from
Slavery is a more godlike Character, than to have subjected
and enslaved them, as did
Alexander
and
Cæsar
.

The Courtly
Waller
next commands my Lays,

Muse, tune thy Verse with Art to
Waller
's Praise.

While tender Airs, and lovely Dames inspire

Soft melting Thoughts, and propagate Desire;

So long shall
Waller
's Strains our Passion move,

And
Sacharissa
's Beauties kindle Love.

Thy Verse, harmonious Bard, and flatt'ring Song,

Can make the Vanquish'd great, the Coward strong:

Thy Verse can shew ev'n
Cromwell
's Innocence,

And complement the Storms that bore him hence.
[Pg 11]

Oh! had thy Muse not come an Age too soon,

But seen great
Nassau
on the
British
Throne,

How had his Triumphs glitter'd in thy Page,

And warm'd thee to a more exalted Rage.

What Scenes of Death,
&c.

So little Danger is there of learning to be insipid by
imitating
Waller
, that he is praised by the Editor of
St.
Evremond
's Works, for the Elevation of his Genius,
Mr.
Edmond Waller; s'est generallement fait admirer par
l'Elevation de son Esprit
.

I do not in this
Essay
aim at any Thing more, than, as
I have said before, to put several critical Hints, which I
had collected, together, and not to form a regular Discourse,
but take them as they come in my way.

If the
Spectator
, by the Passage above-mentioned, insinuates
that a Man must be able to perform himself in
an Art, to be a good Judge of the Performances of others;
consequently, that I ought to be a masterly Historian, to
make Remarks on Mr.
Echard
's History, he divests me at
once of the Right I pretend to in the following Treatise.
Let us therefore enquire into the Reason of this Reflection.

Horace
, whom no
English
Author could understand better
than the
Spectator
, as appears by his admirable Translation,
teaches us otherwise,

Munus & Officium, nil scribens ipse, docebo.

Yet without writing, I may teach to write.

[
Rosc.

Dacier
's Notes upon
Hippocrates
, as I have been informed
by my worthy Friend Dr.
Allen
, are much
better than any others, though made by Men of the
Faculty
,
which
Dacier
did not profess. Monsieur
Corneille
,
the greatest Genius in
France
for Tragedy, wrote
Examens

of his Pieces, which, like
Dryden
's Prefaces, were
adapted to the several Tragedies, and very often clashed
with one another, as the Subject required: but because
he would prevent as much as possible any Attack of Criticism,
he declares in one of his Discourses,
That the
Knowledge which is acquired by Study and Speculation, is
of little or no Use without Experience
. Thus an Author
must produce a Tragedy himself, before he presumes to
[Pg 12]

criticise on another's. If it be the same Thing in History
too, I began at the wrong End, and should have written
three or four Folio Histories, before I had presum'd
to make Remarks on Archdeacon
Echard
's, this would
bear very hard upon me, and I must beg Leave to enquire
a little whether the Case be really so or not.

Monsieur
Dacier
is so far from being of
Corneille
's Opinion,
that he thinks a Man who never did write a Tragedy,
may criticise on another's Poem the better for that
he never wrote himself.
Nay, I do not know
, says he in his
Preface to
Aristotle
,
whether he who has written Dramatick
poems, is so proper to explain the Rules of the Art,
as he, who never wrote any: For it would be a Miracle if
the former were not seduced by Self-love; whereas the latter
is disinterested, and the more likely to be an impartial
Judge.
Again,
if it was necessary to be a good poet to
make Criticisms on Poetry, we should never have had any
Critick at all; for I do not know one Critick upon Poetry,
that was himself a Poet.
By this one would think, that
he did not look upon
Rapin
as a Critick in Poetry, for he
wrote a Poem on
Gardening
.
Menage
makes as little of
him as
Dacier
; yet
Dryden
says, were all the Writings of
other Criticks lost,
Rapin
's Works alone would be sufficient
to teach us the whole Art of Criticism. We all know
Aristotle

and
Horace
wrote upon Epick Poetry and Tragedy,
yet neither of them ever wrote a Tragedy or Epick Poem;
and perhaps neither of them would have succeeded if he
had.
Rymer
made one poor Attempt that Way in his

Edgar
: But, as if it had been written only to prove that a
Man may judge well of an Art, without being a Performer,
like an ill-built Ship, it sunk in the very launching,
and seem'd to be written only to be damned.

The
Guardian
seconds the
Spectator
, and forbids any
one to criticise, that cannot write to Perfection.
If I find
by his own Manner of Writing, that he is heavy and tasteless,
I throw aside his Criticisms with a secret Indignation,
to see a Man without Genius or Politeness, dictating to the
World on Subjects which I find are above his Reach.
Thus
Mr.
Rymer
, the best Critick we had till then, and all
his Rules, are void and of no Effect; He has cancelled
them with a Dash of his Pen. If a Man must not only
have Politeness, but a Genius, what will become of
Aristotle

and
Longinus
,
Bossu
and
Dacier
? They were all
[Pg 13]

polite Writers, but have not discover'd that they had Genius.
I ever had as little Opinion of heavy tasteless Criticks
as the
Spectator
or
Guardian
, yet I never could endure
an arbitrary Judgement; for, what else is
tasteless
and

heavy
without Proof? But then, that Proof could not be
produced without the
Criticisms
, which, let them be ever
so poor, are often more easily despis'd than answer'd.

I was always convinced by Example, that a Critick may
have a just Taste, without being a Poet; and that the Indignation
the
Guardian
speaks of, is never provoked, unless
a weak Place is hit upon: As, in the low Phrase,

A galled Horse winces when you touch the Sore
. In three
or four Lines, we have
tasteless
,
heavy
,
dogmatical
,
stupid

Macer
and
Mundungus all of the poor Criticks. Had
they been really such stupid Creatures, they could not have
given such Offence. Hard Words shew Anger more than
Indignation, and we are apt to conjecture, that the Poets
would not be so angry with the Criticks, if they were not
afraid of them. The Concern of the former is wonderfully
generous; they are not in Pain for what the Criticks
say of their Errours and Failings, but for the Heaviness
and Stupidity of their Criticisms. Thus in the lowest
Life, we shall often hear one angry Woman cry out of
another,
I do not matter what she said of me, but to see
the Impudence of the Slut
.
Macer
and
Mundungus
are
taken from Mr.
Congreve
's Epistle to Sir
Richard Temple
;

So
Macer
and
Mundungus
school the Times,

And write in rugged Verse the softer Rules of Rhimes.

If the
Guardian
had the Critick upon
Cato
in his
Thoughts, when he quoted those Verses, which I suppose
he had, why does he mention rhiming Criticisms?
That Author wrote his Rules and Remarks always in
Prose, so did
Rymer
; what then do they all mean by

rugged Verse
? The Lord
Roscommon
's Poetry is Harmony
it self. The last Essay upon Criticism in Verse was not
then written. There remains only the late Duke of

Buckingham
's Poetical Essay, of Note enough to be remembered
by Mr.
Congreve
: That could not be named,
without offending
good Breeding
, a Term very often made
use of by two elegant Authors; who, I much question,
had never the Education of a Dancing-Master. However,
Poetry and Criticism are perfect Levellers, and no
[Pg 14]

Man can plead Privilege in the Court of
Parnassus
; what
then is the Meaning of the next Lines after
Mundungus
?

Well do they play the careful Critick's Part,

Instructing doubly by their matchless Art:

Rules for good Verse they first with Pains indite,

Then shew us what are bad by what they write.

The
Guardian
and
Spectator
would not do the Poets
the Honour to name them; but we know who are the
Criticks which are
thrown aside
by them; for no Body
but Mr.
D——
and Mr.
G——
made Remarks upon
their Writings, and both of them did. I do not say with
that Politeness and Elegance, which the
Spectator
and

Guardian
have laid down, as the sole Characteristicks of
good Talk and Judgement; though one may almost as
well say, that a Man cannot have good Sense and Wit,
without good Cloaths and a genteel Air. I must needs
own, that I think most of their Criticisms very just,
though had they been still juster than they are, I would
not nave been the Author of them, without taking Notice
of Beauties, as well as finding of Faults, there being
much more Room for the former than the latter.

It is very plain, the
Spectator
highly stomached the Remarks
which were made on his Writings, and is not very
candid in his Reasoning, to render his Opponents contemptible,
which was the surest Way of disarming them.

These Criticks fall upon a Play, not because it is ill written,
but because it takes
: This is not the whole Truth.
It is not because it
takes
, but because it takes for those
very Things which should have damned it
Durfey
's

Boarding-School
, and his
Marriage-Hater match'd
, took
with a Vengeance, though the two greatest Pieces of Wit
in them, were
Miss's Bread and Butter
, and
Mynheer's
Muff
.
Settle
's Tragedies took for the Noise, the Show,
and the Rhime. No Play, that was not supported by
poetical or political Party, which most
taking
Plays have
been, ever took more than
Settle
's
Heir of Morocco
, in
which there is not one good Thought or Expression.
Again,
several of these Criticks have laid it down as a
Maxim, that whatever Dramatick Poem has a long Run,
must of Necessity be good for nothing
, which is a Misre
[Pg 15]
presentation.
The
Orphan
,
Venice Preserv'd
,
Tamerlane
,

&c.
had
long Runs
, and
run
still; yet no Critick
has dared to say they did not deserve it: But whoever
will owe his Reputation to
taking
only, must be contented
to roll with
Settle
,
Durfey
, and many other Poets, that
took

in their Turn. Could any thing be more monstrous, than
to determine the Merit of
Nixon's Prophecy
, and the

Spectator
, by the Run of the Papers. The former, a
Maggot given to the Rabble, bore more Editions in Ten
Weeks, than the latter has done in Ten Years.

I would not be understood in this, or any thing else, to
endeavour to lessen the Opinion the People have generally
and justly of the
Spectator
's Perfections: I verily believe,
there is no Production of the Mind, ancient or modern,
where are to be found more Wit, Politeness, fine Raillery,
good Sense, Learning, and Eloquence; but what I
have said, is to shew, that great Wits as well as little have
their Passions, their Piques and Prejudices, when the least
Blemish is discovered in their Glory. In the same
Spectator
,
we have another Hint, that no Body ought to criticise
on that Author's Writings, unless he could write as elegantly
as himself, which effectually cuts off all
Criticism
.
These
professed Criticks cannot put ten Words together with
Elegance, or common Propriety
. What an arbitrary Way
of arguing is this? These Criticks are Smatterers;
They
vilify only the Productions that gain Applause; the Blemishes
they descry are imaginary; their Arguments are far
fetched; Their Works are like those of the Sophists, they
are thought deep, because unintelligible; they instruct the
People in Absurdities
. Would the
Spectator
allow this
positive Air in any other Writer? How does it appear that
one Word of all this is true?
Ipse dixit.
That must satisfy,
though he is in this Case too much a Party, to be a Judge.

These
Criticks
are led themselves into Absurdities, by not
considering, That there is sometimes a greater Judgement
shewn in deviating from the Rules of Art, than adhering
to them
. The Word
sometimes
here would make every
right Argument wrong, and every Truth Falsehood, because

sometimes
there may be an Exception to a general
Rule. Why, does he not tell us, wherein himself, or any
one else shewed his Judgement in deviating from the Rules
of Art? The
Critical Smatterers
do not charge him in
those Places where Judgement was shewn in such deviating,
[Pg 16]

but where the Want of Judgement appeared in it. I shall
have occasion to touch this Subject a little elsewhere;
though I hope what I have said here, is enough to prove
that just
Criticisms
are not the Productions of Ignorance
and Envy, as the
Spectator
intimates; but that they are,
on the contrary, useful and necessary to be a Check on the
greatest Genius's, who want the Rein much more than
the Spur; and what, in a few Years, would become of
all good Writing, if those great Genius's could impose
their very Blemishes on the World for the most shining
Beauties?

The
Spectator
gives us another Mark, by which we
may discover a Critick, who has neither Taste nor Learning,
and that is,
He seldom ventures to praise any Passage
in an Author, which has not been before received and
applauded by the Publick
. If this Remark had been infallible
and universal, it must have deprived the
Spectator

himself of the two greatest Beauties in all his Quotations
out of
Milton
which are in every one's Mouth.
The One in the sublime Kind in the Speech to the

Sun
.

Oh then, that with surpassing Glory crown'd,

Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God

Of this new World.—

The Other in the tender Kind.
Adam
to
Eve
.

Her Hand soft touching whisper'd thus, Awake

My Fairest, my espous'd, my best belov'd,

Heavens last, best Gift, my ever new Delight;

Awake.

which had before been a thousand Times repeated as
the Perfection of
English
Poetry, in their several Kinds.
And the Author, who shall have occasion to quote them
as such after the
Spectator
, will not discover his Want of
Taste or Learning by it. Very just is his Observation,

A true Critick ought to dwell rather upon Excellencies than
Imperfections, &c.
But as this has Relation chiefly to
those Compositions which require Genius, Judgement and
Eloquence; and consequently, cannot relate to Mr.
Echard
's
History of
England
, we shall now say no more of it.

That I may not be guilty of the Fault I blame in others,
the neglecting of Beauties, and falling unmercifully upon
[Pg 17]

the Blemishes of Authors. I must sincerely acknowledge,
that it was not for Want of Will, that I did not mention
what is beautiful in our Historian, but for Want of Opportunity.
What Part of his Performance should I have
applauded! Is it the
Design
! The Author does not himself
pretend, that it is regular, if by
Design
in
History
,
we are to understand the
Plan
as in
Poetry
: He will
not deny, but that his Method is too much diversified,
and too confused; sometimes it is
General History
, sometimes

Annals
, sometimes a
Diary
, sometimes
Biography
;
all which he seems to think he has sufficiently provided
against, by dividing the whole Work into
Sections
,
and putting Pales between his Paragraphs. This Confusion
will be easily pardoned by his Readers, there being
hardly one in a Thousand that knows the Difference between

Biography
and
History
, or between an
Annalist
and
an
Historian
; or who does not take
Buck
's
Richard
III, or

Cambden
's Queen
Elizabeth
, to be as much of the historical
Kind, as
Samuel Daniel
's History of
England
,
which is the only
English
History that has the least Appearance
of Uniformity and Regularity of Design.

Ne Sutor ultra Crepidam
, is in nothing a more necessary
Maxim, than in the Productions of the Mind. It is
not because a Man can write a Sonnet, an Elegy, nay, an
Ode, or a Dramatick Poem, that therefore he can succeed
in Epick; though we in
England
are apt to confound
all Sorts of Poetry and Poets, and to think that
there is but one and the same Genius necessary for all of
them. Thus it is, that you often hear the Question in
Company, which is the best Poet,
Virgil
or
Horace
,
Milton

or
Waller
,
Dryden
or
Wycherley
,
Congreve
or
Row
.
It is the same Thing in History: If a Man is able to
abridge a Dictionary, to collect and compile Memoirs;
in a Word, if he can put a Tale together, he is immediately
an Historian, though Story-telling and History are
as different as a
Madrigal
and a Pindarick
Ode
.

History is designed to instruct Mankind by Example,
to shew what Men were by what they did, and from particular
Instances to form general Lessons in all the various
Stations of Life; and our Historian has so far a just
Conception of its Dignity and Use, that he speaks of his
own Performance as if he had formed a regular noble Design,
with a regular and noble View, and executed it with
[Pg 18]

equal Beauty and Perfection. Very great Talents are requisite
to succeed in it, especially that of Judgement, to
relate only what is worth relating, and to make proper
Reflections upon Events for the Instruction of the Reader.

Nothing is more necessary for an Historian
, says
Pere Rapin
,

than Judgement: Nothing requires so much Sense,
so much Reason, so much Wit, so much Wisdom, and other
good Qualities, as History, to succeed in writing it; and
above all,
Un Heureux Naturel
, a happy Genius, which
endowed with all these Qualifications, will not do without,

Un Grand Commerce du Monde
, a great Knowledge
of the World
.
Pere Bouhours
, whom Mr.
Addison

thought the most judicious and penetrating of all the

French
Criticks, has an admirable Remark on the Reflections
of Historians, in his
Maniere de bien penser
.
The
Historian ought to shine most in his Reflections: Nothing
is so irregular as to reflect falsely on Events that are
true
. He mentions a pleasant Instance of a
French

Priest, who said in a Sermon,
The Heart of Man being
of a triangular Figure, and the World of a round one;
It is plain, that all worldly Greatness cannot fill the Heart
of Man
. We have been told a thousand Times, that
the
Presbyterians
had a Quarrel with King
Charles
the
First, and that those who had a Quarrel with him, took
him and cut off his Head. The Fact is true as to the
Quarrel, but nothing can be more false, than that the

Presbyterians
beheaded him. The Fact is true, that the
Act of Toleration put a Stop to the Persecuting of Dissenters;
but the Reflection from it,
That the Church
was in Danger
, is false. If I would rifle the
Grand Rebellion
,
and Mr.
Echard
's History, I might have the Honour
of being Author of a Folio too, by taking from
them Examples of this Kind; and I cannot but think,
if the Archdeacon had duely weighed the Difficulties inseparable
from his Undertaking, the indispensable Duty
of Sincerity and Truth, and the great Talents necessary for
an Historian, he would have transferred the Work to another,
not a Dealer in Records only, from whom one can
expect nothing but the naked Facts without Form or
Order, without Ornament, or even cloathing; very proper
for Evidence in Tryals at Law, but too rude and unpolished
for the Beauty and Elegance of History: Yet
I am satisfied, there is not one Man in a Thousand in
[Pg 19]

England
, but thinks there are no Writers so fit to make
Historians as your Record Keepers and Library Keepers,
who are just as necessary in such Work as Masons
and Carpenters are in Architecture, and no more in Comparison
with the Architect, than the
Axe
or the
Chissel

are in Comparison with them.
An excellent Historian
,
says Mons.
Pellisson
, Pref. to
Sar.

ought to have a
general Knowledge of the World and of Affairs, and a
subtle and penetrating Wit, to distinguish the true Causes
of humane Actions, from the Pretexts and Colours which
are given them
. Thus our Historian should have distinguish'd
Archbishop
Laud
's natural Pride and Severity,
from that Piety and Zeal which are the
Pretexts and
Colours
that are given them. He should also have distinguish'd
the Pique and Partiality in the Grand Rebellion
from Truth and Sincerity, which are the Pretexts and
Colours. Again,

Tacitus
, said he, wrote
Sine studio Partium & Ira
;
if the same may be said of the two Historians in Question,
I have done them much Wrong. The late Earl of

Shaftsbury
, in his Letter of
Enthusiasm
, has this Expression:

We have few modern Writers, who, like
Xenophon

or
Cicero
, can write their own Commentaries, and
the raw Memoir Writings, and uninformed Pieces of modern
Statesmen full of their own interested and private
Views, will, in another Age, be of little Service to support
their Memory or Name, since already the World begins
to sicken with them
.

It is somewhat strange, that Mr.
Echard
should not be
so well acquainted with the Weakness of the vulgar Humour
in
England
, as a Foreigner; who was so sensible of
the Peoples Fondness to hear Stories, that he excuses those
of a better Taste amongst them, who cannot relish such as
relate to Ghosts, Devils, Prophecies, and the like, with
which the Archdeacon's History abounds. The Author
of the
Paris Journal des Sçavans
, speaking of
English

History Writers, and their bringing in Prophecies and
strange Stories, says,
Granting it to be true, it is not so
much to be attributed to their Want of Skill, as to their
Compliance with the Humour of the People, that attend too
much to Prophecies, and are too much affected with Tales
;
which Humour our Historian has rather indulged than
discountenanced, and it must surely be for Want of Judge
[Pg 20]
ment,
after the indulging them in it, had been so much
exploded. The
French
Historian
Maimbourg
participates
of the same Character, and his Zeal for the Church, could
not procure him a better one abroad, than what was given
him in
Italy
, that he was among Historians, what
Momus

is among the Gods,
only to tell Tales
; with which
the Vulgar are as well contented, as with Relations that
are truly historical. But we should be as cautious of reading
such Histories, as
Menage
tells us he was of reading

Morreri
's, for Fear we should remember them.
Collier

knew better than
Menage
, and therefore translated
Morreri
's
three Folio's into
English
, as a rich Store for the
Memories of his Countrymen.

Having so little Reason to commend the Historian
for his
Design
, I should make him amends in the Sentiments,
if there was the least Room for it. It is true,
in History, if the Facts are fairly related, the Sentiments
must be brought along with them, and the Author is not
accountable for them as in Poetry: But if the Sentiments
do not correspond with the Facts; if Meekness and Holiness
are seated to give Judgement in the
High Commission

and
Star Chamber
Courts; if Piety is mounted on
Horseback with the Lord High Treasurer's Staff in her
Hand; if the most noble Characters are ascribed to Persons
engaged in the most unjustifiable Actions, we may
depend upon it, these Persons, either did not think, or did
not act as they are represented, and consequently that the
History is false and vicious: The Historians Reflections
upon Events are entirely his own, and we shall see in the
following Pages, how wise and how weighty they are:
But as they bear all on one Side, like an ill ballasted
Ship, it is much, if in the Course of a few Years, it does
not overset the History.

There is no greater Vice in Historians, than poor and
common Reflections. The Poverty of the Archdeacon's
appears in the
After Wit
, which makes a good Part of
them; and the
Vulgarisms
, which will be further explain'd
as Occasions often.

Indeed we do not enough acquaint ourselves in
England
,
with what Father
Bouhours
calls the
Manner of Right
Thinking
, in his Treatise before mentioned; which
Fontenelle

recommends as one of the most agreeable and useful
Books in the
French
Tongue: We have nothing like it
[Pg 21]

in
English
, or in any other Language antient or modern,
Wit and Humour, Wit and good Sense, Wit and Wisdom,
Wit and Reason, Wit and Craft; nay, Wit and Philosophy,
are with us almost the same things. How often
have I heard it said, there is a great Deal of Wit in
Homer
,
a great Deal of Humour in
Virgil
. We take all
Thoughts in the Gross; the Sublime, the Grand, the
Noble, the Pretty, the Agreeable, the Fine, the Delicate,
are all alike witty with us; and the Vulgar are ignorant
of all other Distinction, but that of a
Jest
and a
Bull
.
Sir
Samuel Garth
, who was extreamly fond of Father

Bouhours
's Treatise, did often wish that it was translated,
and the Examples the
French
Critick takes from
Greek
,

Latin
,
Italian
,
Spanish
and
French
Authors, not to be
turned into
English
, but
English
Examples to be put instead
of them. I am satisfied nothing would be of more
Advantage towards the Refinement of our Manner, both
of Thinking and Writing. I know the Undertaking
would be very difficult, and the greatest Part of the Difficulty
be to preserve the Spirit and Turn of Thought
in the
English
Examples, to make it answer Father
Bouhours
's
Remarks. Who is there, that does not take a
sublime Thought, a noble Thought, a grand Thought,
to be synonymous Terms, though they differ from one
another, almost as much as from the Agreeable and the
Delicate. I am my self afraid to attempt any Thing
like Examples of Kinds, and probably my Conceptions
of them may be wrong; what they are I shall offer them
to the Reader, with the Caution and Submission which
becomes me in a Matter so intricate and nice.

The first Example of the
Sublime
is so well known,
that if there was any other so good in any other Author,
I should not have made use of it. It is in the 7th
Chapter of
Longinus
. We will not borrow it from
Boileau
,
because we are forbidden by the
Spectator
to make
Use of a Quotation which has been made Use of before.
Dr.
Gregory
, in the Preface to his Works, printed about
sixty Years ago, at what Time
Boileau
had not thought
of translating
Longinus
, writes thus:
Dionysius Longinus
,
one that knew what belonged to Expression
; having
first of all cast a Scorn upon his
Homer
. The Translator
does not dwell much upon this,
says Τῶν Ιουδαιων θεσμοθέτης
that the Law-givers of the Jews, Ὀυχ ὁ τυχὼν ἀνὴρ, no or
[Pg 22]
dinary
Man, was in the Right when he brought in his
God
, saying, Γενέσθω φῶς, καὶ ἐγενετο

Let there be Light,

And there was Light.

But least it may be said, the
Spectator
has entered a
Caveat against my using any Quotation, which he or any
one else had used, I shall add another Instance of the
Sublime taken out of the same divine Book the Bible,
that has not been blown upon:

He spake,

And it was:

He commanded,

And it stood firm.

The whole
Psalm
xxxiiid is full of the
Sublime
:

By the Word of the Lord were the Mountains made,

And all the Host of them by the Breath of his Mouth.

What in all profane Learning comes up to the
Sublime

in the xxxviiith Chapter of
Job
, where the Almighty is
introduced speaking to him out of the Whirlwind:

Gird up thy Loins like a Man, for I will demand of thee.

Where wast thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth?

Declare, If thou hast Understanding.

Who laid the Measures thereof?

Who hath stretched the Line upon it?

Whereupon are the Foundations thereof fastened?
or,

Who laid the Corner Stone?

When the Morning Stars sang, and the Sons of God shouted for Joy!

Happily imitated by
Milton
.

————Up he rode,

Follow'd with Acclamations, and the Sound

Symphonious of ten thousand Harps, that tuned

Angelick Harmonies, the Earth, the Air

Resounding. Thou rememberest; for thou heardest

The Heavens, and all the Constellations ring:

The Planets in their Stations listening stood,

While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.

Open ye everlasting Gates: They sung,

Open ye Heavens, your living Doors; Let in

The great Creator from his Work returned

Magnificent, his Six Days Work, a World.

[Pg 23]
Of
the sublime Kind is the Ode in the
Spectator
, N
o

465; being a Paraphrase on that of the
Psalmist
.
The
Heavens declare
:

The spacious Firmament on high,

With all the blue Ethereal Sky;

And spangled Heavens, a shining Frame,

Their great Original proclaim.

Some very scrupulous Persons may be apt to object
against the third Line as an Anteclimax, the
spangled
Heavens
having much more Lustre than
shining Frame
.
The following
Stanza
is extreamly sublime:

What tho' in solemn Silence all

Move round the dark terrestrial Ball;

What tho', nor real Voice, nor Sound

Amid their radiant Orbs be found,

In Reason's Ear they all rejoice,

And utter forth a glorious Voice;

For ever singing as they shine,

The Hand that made me is divine.

I cannot omit here some Lines of Mr.
Waller
's upon
the Holy Scriptures, where there is more of the Sublime
than in all other Books whatsoever.

The
Græcian
Muse has all their gods surviv'd,

Nor
Jove
at us, nor
Phœbus
is arriv'd;

Frail Deities, which first the Poets made,

And then invok'd to give their Fancies Aid.

Yet, if they still divert us with their Rage,

What may be hop'd for in a better Age,

When not from
Helicon
's imagin'd Spring,

But sacred Writ we borrow what we sing?

This with the Fabrick of the World begun

Elder than Light, and shall out-last the Sun.

There are not ten finer Verses together in Mr.
Waller
's
Poems, yet he wrote them when he was above fourscore
Years old.

Are not these two Verses of a Manuscript Poem in
the sublime Kind? the young Author, a Lad at
Eaton

School, wrote it on the Birth of his Royal Highness the
Duke of
Cumberland
:

[Pg 24]

Gods how he springs like Whirlwinds charg'd with Fire,

He lays War waste, and Makes the World retire.

And these Verses out of
Tamerlane
:

The dreadful Business of the War is over,

And Slaughter, that from yester Morn till Even,

With Gyant Steps past striding o'er the Field

Besmear'd, and horrid with the Blood of Nations,

Now weary sits among the mangled Heaps,

And slumbers o'er her Prey.

I cou'd easily fill many Volumes of Quotations out of
the Antients and Moderns, in all the Kinds of Thinking;
but as I am doubtful of the Success of my Attempt,
so the Fewer I insert, the Less I shall offend.

The
French
perhaps have been a little too scrupulous
and exact in dividing the
Noble
and the
Grand
in the
Manner of Thinking. However, as to the Noble, let us
see whether this Passage borrow'd of Scripture by
Milton
,
will not serve for an Instance:

All Night he will pursue, but his Approach,

Darkness defends between till Morning Watch,

Then thro' the fiery Pillar and the Cloud,

God looking forth will trouble all his Host,

And craze their Chariot Wheels; when, by Command,

Moses
once more, his potent Rod erects

Over the Sea: The Sea his Rod obeys

On their embattled Ranks, the Waves return,

And overwhelm their War.

There would be no End of it, if one should go about
to enumerate such Instances as these out of
Milton
. His
Poem of
Paradise lost
is so full of them, that almost out
of one Book one might collect as many such noble Passages,
as out of all the
Æneis
; and I would add the

Ilias
too, if I understood
Greek
half so well as the
Translator.

Among the many Sketches of the glorious Character
of King
William
in that of
Tamerlane
, Mr.
Row
has
this, which I take to be a very noble Image:

No Lust of Rule, the common Vice of Kings;

No furious Zeal inspir'd by hot-brain'd Priests:
[Pg 25]

Ill hid beneath Religions specious Name,

E'er drew his temp'rate Courage to the Field.

But to redress an injur'd Peoples Wrongs,

To save the weak One from the strong Oppressour

Is all his End of War; and when he draws

The Sword to punish, like relenting Heav'n,

He seems unwilling to deface Mankind.

The Opposition in the following Passage, carries with
it its own Application:

————As oft regardless

Of plighted Faith, with most unkingly Baseness

Without a War proclaim'd, or Cause pretended,

He has t'ane Advantage of their absent Arms

To waste with Sword and Fire their fruitful Fields,

Like some accursed Fiend, who 'scap'd from Hell,

Poisons the balmy Air thro' which he flies,

He blasts the bearded Corn, and loaded Branches,

The lab'ring Hind's best Hopes, and marks his Way with Ruin.

Is there not something noble in what Mr.
Waller
says
to the Duke of
Monmouth
, at his Return from suppressing
a Rebellion in
Scotland
:

But seeing Envy like the Sun does beat,

With scorching Rays, on all that's high and great,

This, ill requited
Monmouth
, is the Bough

The Muses send to shade thy conqu'ring Brow;

Lampoons like Squibs may make a present Blaze,

But Time and Thunder pay Respect to Bays.

I hope I may make Use of Part of Mr.
Addison
's
Translation of the
Justum & Tenacem
of
Horace
. The
Translator having done me the Honour to render it in

English
at my Request:

The Man resolv'd and steady to his Trust,

Inflexible to Ill, and obstinately just;

May the rude Rabble's Insolence despise

Their senseless Clamours, and tumultuous Cries.

The Tyrant's Fierceness he beguiles.

And the stern Brow, and the harsh Voice defies,

And with superiour Greatness smiles.

[Pg 26]
Again,

Should the whole Frame of Nature round him break

In Ruin and Confusion hurl'd,

He unconcern'd would hear the mighty Crack,

And stand secure amidst a falling World.

Si fractus illabatur Orbis,

Impavidum ferient Ruinæ.

Is not this noble Thought the Original of that which
ends the noted
Siloloquy
of
Cato
:

The Soul secure in his Resistance smiles

At the drawn Dagger, and defies its Point:

The Stars shall fade away, the Sun himself

Grow dim with Age, and Nature sink in Years?

But thou shalt flourish in immortal Youth,

Unhurt amidst the War of Elements,

The Wrecks of Matter, and the Crush of Worlds.

The two Verses quoted out of
Horace
:

Si fractus
, &c.

are not so well imitated by the Gentleman that turned

Cato
's
Siloloquy
into
Latin
, as to defy a Comparison;

Orbesque fractis ingerentur orbibus

Illæsa tu sedebis extra fragmina

But not to be always running back to the Antients, let
us have Recourse to the Moderns, particularly
Quillet
,
and we shall find something in this Kind of Thinking.

Tons. Callip.
p. 72.

As far as thou may'st Nature's Depths explore

Still inexhaustible, thou find'st the Store;

Thee let the Order she observes suffice,

What Laws controul our Earth, and what the Skies.

Mark how a thousand starry Orbs on high

Around the Void with equal Motion fly;

Mark how the huge Machine one Order keeps,

And how the Sun th' Etherial Champian sweeps.

Both Earth and Air with genial Heat he warms,

Gives ev'ry Grace, and every Beauty forms;
[Pg 27]

Whether around the lazy Globe he rolls.

Or Earth is whirl'd about him on her Poles;

God is the Mover, God the living Soul,

That made, that acts, that animates the Whole.

Hence with thy Atoms, Epicurus; hence:

Was all this wond'rous Frame the Sport of Chance!

Of Solids, they, 'tis true, the Matter make,

Can Matter from itself its Figure take!

Can the bright Order in the World we see,

The blind Effect of wanton Fortune be!

Did jumbling Atoms form the various Kind

Of Beings, or did one Almighty Mind?

Guess what you will, you must at last resort

To a first Cause, and not to Chance's Sport.

This Cause is God————

I must not omit this
Noble
Thought of
Milton
's:

Then crown'd, again their golden Harps, they took

Harps ever tun'd, that glitt'ring by their Side

Like Quivers hung, and with Preamble sweet

Of charming Symphony, they introduce

The sacred Song, and waken Raptures high:

No one exempt, no Voice but well cou'd joyn

Melodious Part, such Concord is in Heav'n.

Having mention'd so many noble Thoughts in Verse,
I shall conclude this Article, with a very plain but very
noble one in Prose, the Saying of
Leonidas
to
Xerxes
:

If you had not been too powerful and too happy, you might
have been an honest Man.

Tho' it is a very hard Matter to distinguish the
Grand

from the
Noble
in the Manner of Thinking, yet we shall
endeavour it by the following Examples; and sure nothing
can be more
Grand
, than the Saying of
Alexander
the Great
, to the Greatest of his Captains
Parmenio
,

Darius
, King of
Persia
, having offer'd the
Macedonian

Monarch half
Asia
in Marriage with his Daughter
Statira
.

As for me
, says
Parmenio
,
if I were
Alexander
, I would
accept of these Offers
:
And so would I
, reply'd that
Prince,
If I were
Parmenio
.
But why should we be always
dealing in
Heroicks
, and running back into Antiquity
to borrow Example from the Conquerors of the World.
Why may not we propose one in the lowest Life, which
[Pg 28]

will at the same Time prove, that the Excellencies of
both Thought and Expression are in Nature, and not in
the Rules of Art only. A Sergeant of the Guards,
What
a terrible Fall is this, from
Alexander the Great
, to a
Sergeant of the Guards!
who was in the last Attack
upon the Castle of
Namur
in King
William
's War, after
he had fir'd his Grenades at the Enemy behind the Palisadoes,
leapt over them, and had been slaughter'd, had
not a
French
Officer prevented it. The Sergeant being a
Prisoner in the Castle was sent for by the Governour Count

Guiscard
, and the Mareschal
de Boufflers
. The Latter
demanding how he durst attempt to leap the Palisadoes
with the Enemy behind them, when he could hardly
have done it had there been none?
Perhaps, Sir, I might
not,
reply'd the brave
English
Soldier,
but there is nothing
too difficult for me to come at my Enemy.
A Saying
worthy of
Alexander
or
Cæsar
, of
Marlborough
or

Eugene
.

I have seen something like these Verses of Mr.
Waller
's,
quoted as in the grand Way of Thinking:

Great
Maro
could no greater Tempest feign,

When the loud Winds usurping on the Main,

For angry
Juno
labour'd to destroy

The hated Relicks of confounded
Troy
.

But the Image, as grand as it is, does not seem
to be so noble as the Instances before-mentioned; there
is too much Terrour in it to participate of that Kind of
Thought, which is not confident with what is terrible.

I cannot help thinking there is something
Grand
in this

Epitaph
:

Underneath this Marble Hearse,

Lies the Subject of all Verse;

Sidney
's Sister,
Pembroke
's Mother,

Death 'ere thou hast kill'd another,

Fair and learn'd, and good as she,

Time shall throw a Dart at thee.

To descend to the lower Kinds, we meet with what
Father
Bouhours
calls
Pensées Jolliées
pretty Thoughts;
and we have of that Kind too in
English
, perhaps to a
greater Degree of Excellence, than is to be found in any
other Language; especially those Verses in the
Spectator
,
[Pg 29]

which are said there to be Originals, as indeed they are,
and inimitable. I question whether a Poet might not as
easily imitate
Milton
or
Butler
. There are ten
Stanza
's,
and they all of a like pretty, and natural Turn with
the

IIId
Stanza
.

The Fountain that wont to run sweetly along,

And dance to soft Murmurs the Pebbles among;

Thou know'st little Cupid, if
Phœbe
was there,

'Twere Pleasure to look at, 'twere Musick to hear:

But now she is absent I walk by its Side,

And still as it murmurs do nothing but chide;

Must you be so chearful, while I go in Pain,

Peace there with your Bubbling, and hear me complain.

How the
French
may compare with us, as to this
pretty

Manner, let us see by a Comparison.
Menage
says,
that this
Triolet
, as he calls it, a Sort of low Poetry
where one or two Verses are repeated three Times, was
the King of
Triolet
's, and written by the famous Mons.

Ranchin
:

Le premier Jour de May

Fut le plus Heureux de ma Vie,

Le beau Design que je formay

Le premier Jour de May.

The first Day of the Month of
May

Was the Happiest of my Life,

Ah the fair Design I form'd

The first Day if the Month of
May
.

Then saw you, then I lov'd,

If you like this fair Design,

The first Day of the Month of
May

Was the Happiest of my Life.

Now let us see what an
English
Poet has said on the
First of
May
; and tho' there is in it hardly any Thing
but Words, and those Words rustick to Affectation; yet
they are
Prettiness
itself compared to Mons.
Ranchin
's
Guardian, N
o
124:

[Pg 30]

I.

Oh the charming Month of
May
,

Oh the charming Month of
May
,

When the Breezes fan the
Treeses
,

Full of Blossoms fresh and gay.

II.

Oh what Joys our Prospects yield!

Charming Joys our Prospects yield!

In a new Livery,
&c.

III.

Oh how fresh the Morning Air!

Charming fresh the Morning Air!
&c.

Tho' there is little Meaning here, yet the Dancing of
the Words and the Sprightliness of the Images, make it
a prettier Lyrick than our
Italian
Opera's can produce.

According to my Conception nothing can be prettier
than this Thought of
Buchanan
.

Ilia mihi semper presenti dura
Neæra;

Me, quoties absum, semper abesse dolet;

Non desiderio, nostro non mœret Amore,

Sed se non nostro posse Dolore frui.

Cruel, when I am present, she appears;

As often as I'm absent she's in Tears:

Not that
Neæra
wishes my Return,

To see me love her, but to see me mourn.

These Verses of Mr.
Waller
are, methinks, as pretty as
they are gallant:

Phillis
, why should we delay

Pleasures shorter than the Day!

Cou'd we, which we never can,

Stretch our Lives beyond their Span;

Beauty like a Shadow flies,

And our Youth before us dies.

Or would Youth and Beauty stay,

Love hath Wings, and will away.

Love hath swifter Wings than Time,
&c.

[Pg 31]

Notice has been taken of the Prettiness of these Verses
in
Dryden
's Fable of the
Cock
and the
Fox
.

The
Cock
speaks to his Wife Dame
Partlet
:

————See my Dear

How lavish Nature hath adorn'd the Year;

How the pale Primrose and the Violet spring,

And Birds essay their Throats, disus'd to sing:

All these are ours, and I with Pleasure see

Man strutting on two Legs, and aping me.

Madam
Dacier
takes Notice of a very pretty Circumstance
in
Sappho
's Hymn to
Venus
, translated into
Latin
by

Catullus
, and into
English
by Mr.
Philips
.

Thou once didst leave Almighty
Jove
,

And all the golden Roofs above:

The Carre thy wanton Sparrows drew,

Hov'ring in Air, they lightly flew.

As to my Bow'r, they wing'd their Way

I saw their quiv'ring Pinions play:

The Birds dismist, while you remain,

Bore back their empty Carre again.

The Circumstance that renders it so pretty, according
to the
Critical Lady
, is
Venus
's dismissing her Sparrows
and her Carre, and shewing she did not intend to make

Sappho
a Court-Visit, but to dwell with her some Time.
There's another Ode of
Sappho
, which is preserved in

Longinus
, and translated by
Boileau
. It is in the sublime
Kind, and shews the Violence of Love.

From Vein to Vein I feel a subtle Flame,

When e'er I see thee, run thro' all my Frame:

And as the Transport seizes on my Mind,

I'm dumb, and neither Tongue nor Voice can find.

A Mist of Pleasure o'er my Eyes is spread,

I hear no more, and am to Reason dead;

Pale, breathless, speechless, I expiring lie,

I burn, I freeze, I tremble, and I die.

In the
Spectator
, N
o
388. is a Paraphrase on the second
Chapter of
Solomon
's Song.

[Pg 32]

Stanza IV.

I faint, I dye, my lab'ring Breast

Is with the mighty Weight of Love opprest.

I feel the Fire possess my Heart,

And Pain convey'd to ev'ry Part:

Thro' all my Veins the Passion flyes,

My feeble Soul forsakes its Place;

A trembling Faintness seals my Eyes,

And Paleness dwells upon my Face.

To descend again to the lower Kinds of Thinking, I
shall conclude the Pretty with these Verses of Mr.
Prior
's
on the Squirrel in the Cage:

Mov'd in the Orb, pleas'd with the Chimes,

The foolish Creature thinks he climbs.

Bus here or there, turn Wood or Wire

He never gets two Inches higher.

So fares it with those merry Blades,

That frisk it under Pindus Shades.

In noble Songs, and lofty Odes,

They tread on Stars, and talk with gods;

Still dancing in an airy Round,

Still pleas'd with their own Verses Sound;

Brought back how fast soe'er they go,

Always aspiring, always low.

Agreeable Thoughts may be also reckon'd among the
Natural, the Soft, and the Tender; all which in the general
Acceptation, are also taken for Wit. This Speech
of
Eve
's to
Adam
in the
Paradice Lost
, has an Agreeableness
which cannot be match'd in the most Tender of our
Lyrick or Elegiac Poets:

With thee conversing, I forget all Time,

All Seasons and their Change, all please alike:

Sweet is the Breath of Morn, her Rising sweet

With Charm of earliest Birds, pleasant the Sun

When first on this delightful Land he spreads

His orient Beams, on Herb, Tree, Fruit and Flow'r,

Glistring with Dew: Fragrant the fertile Earth

After soft Show'rs, and sweet the Coming on

Of grateful Evening mild: Then silent Night

With this her solemn Bird, and this fair Moon,
[Pg 33]

And these the Gems of Heaven, her starry Train.

But neither Breath of Morn, when she ascends

With Charm of earliest Birds; nor rising Sun

On this delightful Land, nor Herb, Fruit, Flow'r,

Glistring with Dew, nor Fragrance after Showers,

Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night

With this her solemn Bird; nor walk by Moon,

Or glittering Star Light, without thee is sweet.

To speak poetically one would think every Verse was
turn'd and polish'd by the
Loves
and the
Graces
. Indeed
all the Conversation between the first Bridegroom and his
Bride, in this Poem, is exquisitely agreeable and tender,
except the very Incident of the Fall.

I take the Verses in
Waller
, address'd to
Amoret
, to
be of the agreeable Kind:

Fair, that you may truly know

What you unto
Thyrsis
owe;

I will tell you how I do

Sacharissa
love, and you.

Joy salutes me, when I set

My blest Eyes on
Amoret
;

But with Wonder I am strook;

While I on the Other look.

If sweet
Amoret
complains,

I have Sense of all her Pains:

But for
Sacharissa
I

Do not only grieve, but die.
&c.

I could give many Instances of agreeable Thoughts
but of
Dryden
's Fables, especially that of
Cymon
and

Iphigenia
, which had been taken notice of long enough
before the
Spectator
was thought of; and I do not think
it fair, that he should engross all the
Beaux Endroits
,
because he printed them first. The Rusticity of
Cymon
,
and even his Stupidity, has something in it very agreeable
in the Image, which is the pure Nature that we meet
with there:

It happen'd on a Summer's Holy-day,

That to the Greenwood Shade he took his Way;

His Quarter-Staff, which he cou'd ne'er forsake,

Hung half before, and half behind his Back;
[Pg 34]

He trudg'd along unknowing what he sought,

And whistled as he went for Want of Thought.

There is not a more natural Picture in Language than
this. Of the same Kind is that of
Iphigenia
sleeping by
the Fountain: The very Numbers express the Wantonness
of the Wind so livelily, that we feel the Air, and are
fanned by it while we read them, which I think has had
the good Luck to escape Observation:

Her Bosom to the View was only bare;

The fanning Wind upon her Bosom blows;

To meet the fanning Wind her Bosom rose;

The fanning Wind, and purling Streams continue her Repose.

}

Mr.
Dryden
was 68 Years old when he wrote this
Fable, which I have always taken for a Master-piece,
with Respect to natural Thoughts, which are always
agreeable, and harmonious Numbers. The Reader will
perceive, that I do not forbear quoting fine Passages,
because they are in the
Spectator
. I cannot allow of his
Forestalling the Market; and besides, I take his Example
to be preferable to his Precept. Himself does not
stick to quote even from himself; as,

N
o
91. Sidley
has that prevailing gentle Art,
&c.

And again,

N
o
[400.] Sidley
has that prevailing gentle Art,
&c.

Guard
110. Motto——Non ego paucis,

Offendor maculis.

Spec.
291. Motto——Non ego paucis,

Offendor maculis.

This however I will declare in my own Behalf, that I
have quoted nothing from him which he has quoted from

Milton
or
Dryden
, but what I had before collected my
self as remarkable Passages in their several Kinds of
Thinking.

What follows, taken out of Mr.
Charles Hopkins
's Verses
to the Earl of
Dorset
, is of the agreeable Kind:

As Nature does in new-born Infants frame

With their first Speech their careful
Forstrer
's Name,
[Pg 35]

Whose needful Hands their daily Food provide,

And by whose Aid they have their Wants supply'd:

You are, my Lord, the Poet's earliest Theme,

And the first Word he speaks is
Dorset
's Name.

Were not the next Verses written on a Tomb Stone,
they wou'd be very
agreeable
. They are
Ben Johnson
's:

Underneath this Stone doth lie

As much Virtue as cou'd die:

Which when alive did Vigour give

To as much Beauty as cou'd live.

Is not this Picture of
Venus
in
Palamon
and
Arcite
of
the same Kind:

The Goddess self some noble Hand had wrought,

Smiling she seem'd, and full of pleasing Thought,

From Ocean, as she first began to rise,

And smooth'd the ruffled Waves, and clear'd the Skies.

She trod the Brine, all bare below the Breast,

And the green Waves, but ill conceal'd the Rest:

A Lute she held, and on her Head was seen

A Wreath of Roses red, and Myrtles green:

Her Turtles fan'd the buxom Air above,

And by his Mother stood an Infant Love

With Wings display'd.————

These Verses out of
Dryden
's St.
Cecilia
's Ode are
very agreeable:

Softly sweet in
Lydian
Measures

Soon he sooth'd his Soul to Pleasures,

War, he sung, is Toil and Trouble,

Honour but an empty Bubble.

Never ending, still beginning,

Fighting still, and still destroying;

If the World is worth thy Winning,

Think, Oh think, it worth enjoying.

But as the finest Meats are most apt to surfeit, so too
many agreeable Thoughts together may flatten upon the
Palate: And I shall only add an Instance in Prose, taken
out of Mr.
Waller
's Letter to the Lady
Lucy Sydney
, on
the Marriage of her Sister the Lady
Dorothy
, who was
his
Sacharissa
.

[Pg 36]

May my Lady
Dorothy
, if we may yet call her so,
suffer as much, and have the like Passion for this
young Lord, whom she has preferred to the Rest of Mankind,
as others have had for her; and may this Love before
the Year goes about, make her taste of the first Curse
impos'd upon Woman-kind, the Pains of becoming a Mother.
May the First-born be none of her own Sex; and
may she that always affected Silence and Retiredness, have
the House fill'd with the Noise and Number of her Children.
May she, at last, arrive at that great Curse much
declin'd by fair Ladies, Old Age
, &c.

Under the Character of Father
Bouhours
's fine Thoughts
may be put these Verses of Mr.
Waller
's, alluding to his
gallant Poems upon
Sacharissa
, and the Story of
Phœbus

and
Daphne
.

Yet what he sang in his immortal Strain,

Tho' unsuccessful, was not sung in Vain:

All but the Nymph that should redress his Wrong

Attend his Passion, and approve his Song;

Like
Phœbus
, thus acquiring unsought Praise,

He caught at Love, and fill'd his Arms with Bays.

Much of the same Kind is this of the Lord
Landsdown
's
on the same Subject:

Thy Beauty,
Sidney
, like
Achilles
Sword,

Resistless stands upon as sure Record;

The foremost Herce, and the brightest Dame

Both sung alike shall have their Fate the same.

This Part of Mr.
Prior
's Prologue spoken before the
late Queen, is in the fine Way of Thinking:

Let the young
Austrian
then her Terrours bear,

Great as he is, her Delegate in War.

Let him in Thunder speak to both his
Spains
,

That in these dreadful Isles a Woman reigns:

Whilst the bright Queen does on her Subjects show'r,

The gentle Blessings of her softer Pow'r,

Gives sacred Morals to a vicious Age,

To Temples Zeal, and Manners to the Stage;
[Pg 37]

Bids the chaste Muse without a Blush appear,

And Wit be that, which Heaven and she may hear.

Of what Kind shall we take this Image in
Spencer

to be:

His haughty Helmet, horrid all with Gold,

Both glorious Brightness and great Terrour bred;

For all the Crest a Dragon did enfold

With greedy Paws, and over all did spread

His golden Wings; his dreadful hideous Head,

Close couched on the Bever, seem'd to throw,

From flaming Mouth, bright Sparkles fiery red,
&c.

This of
Cowley
is finely thought:

Now all the wide extended Sky,

And all th' harmonious Worlds on high,

And
Virgil
's sacred Work shall dye.

And this of
Waller
to Queen
Henrietta Maria
:

A brave Romance who would exactly frame,

First brings his Knight from some immortal Dame,

And then a Weapon and a flaming Shield,

Bright as his Mother's Eyes, he makes him wield.

None might the Mother of
Achilles
be,

But the fair Pearl and Glory of the Sea.

The Man to whom Great
Maro
gives such Fame,

From the high Bed of heavenly
Venus
came.

And our next
Charles
, whom all the Stars design

Like Wonders to accomplish, springs from thine.

And this to
Zelinda
:

Fairest Piece of well form'd Earth,

Urge not thus your haughty Birth;

The Pow'r, which you have o'er us, lies,

Not in your Race, but in your Eyes.

And these Verses of Mr.
Addison
to the Lord
Hallifax
:

Oh Liberty, thou Goddess heav'nly bright!

Profuse of Bliss, and Pregnant with Delight;

Eternal Pleasures in thy Presence reign,

And smiling plenty leads thy wanton Train.
[Pg 38]

Eas'd of her Load, Subjection grows more light,

And Poverty looks chearful in thy Sight:

Thou mak'st the gloomy Face of Nature gay,

Giv'st Beauty to the Sun, and Pleasure to the Day.

These four Verses, Part of the late Duke of
Buckingham
's
Poem upon
Hobbes
, contain, as I conceive, a fine
Thought:

But such the Frailty is of humane Kind,

Men toil for Fame, which no Man lives to find;

Long rip'ning under Ground this
China
lies;

Fame bears no Fruit, till the vain Planter dies.

But the next Verses contain a false Thought, if I have
a Right Conception of it:

And Nature tir'd with his unusual Length

Of Life, which put her to her utmost Strength;

So vast a Soul, unable to supply,

To save herself, was forc'd to let him die.

Whatever it is we understand by Nature, we can have
no such Idea of it, as to imagine Mr.
Hobbes
cou'd have
been too hard for it.

These Verses of Mr.
Waller
, on
Westminster-Abbey

escaping a Fire, are finely imagined:

So Snow on
Ætna
does unmelted lie,

Whence rolling Flames, and scatter'd Cinders flie:

The distant Country in the Ruin shares,

What falls from Heaven the burning Mountain spares.

Tho' some of these
fine
Thoughts are very nearly allied
to the Noble, yet one may easily perceive, that there is not
so much Dignity, tho' there may be as much Beauty in
the One as in the Other. Thus also, as to delicate and
agreeable Thoughts, they are as nearly related; but a
Thing may be agreeable which is not delicate, tho' it
cannot be delicate, but it must be agreeable: An agreeable
Thought expresses it self entirely; a delicate One
leaves something to the Readers Imagination which is
very flattering.

As in this beauteous old Verse of
Chaucer
's, preserv'd
in
Dryden
's,
Palamon
and
Arcite
:

Uprose the Sun, and uprose
Emily
.

[Pg 39]

Had
Chaucer
said,
Up rose the Sun,
and then
up rose
Emily
brighter than the Sun
,
Emily
and the Reader
would have been entertain'd with only a common Complement;
but now the Reader fills up the Thought himself,
and imagines that the Sun rose to prepare the Way
for something brighter than himself:
Up rose
Emily
.

Mr.
Dryden
, in another place,

Now Day appears, and with the Day the King,

imitates
Chaucer
, but the Delicacy is lost, for there is nothing
more to be understood by it, as there is in this Couplet
of his to the Dutchess of
Ormond
upon her going to

Ireland
before the late Duke,

As
Ormond
's Harbinger, to you they run,

For
Venus
is the Promise of the Sun.

There the Reader fills up the Comparison himself, and
consequently cannot but be pleas'd, as we are apt to be,
with every thing which we do our selves.

The Delicacy of Thought is recommended to us by the

Spectator
, in this beautiful Passage out of
Milton
, where
after the most dismal Prospect of Death, which the Heart
of Man was ever terrify'd with,
Adam
is presented with
one of the gayest Scenes with which it ever was delighted.

——————When from the Tents, behold

A Beavy of fair Women richly gay,

In Jems and wanton Dress. To the Harp they sang

Soft amorous Ditties, and in Dance came on.

The Men, tho' Grave, ey'd them, and let their Eyes

Rove without Rein, 'till in the amorous Net

First caught they lik'd, and each his liking chose.

And now of Love they treat, till the Evening Star

Love's Harbinger appear'd; then all in Heat

They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke

Hymen
: Then first to Marriage Rights invok'd.

With Feast and Musick, all the Tents resound;

Such happy Interview, and fair Event

Of Love and Youth not lost: Songs, Garlands, Flowers,

And charming Symphonies attach the Heart

Of
Adam
.————

[Pg 40]

The Reader takes in the Infection all along in Reading
as
Adam
does in seeing, and imagines at the End of
the Description the Pleasure of
Adam
's Imagination.

Is there not Delicacy in these Verses of Mr.
Wallers
upon
a Lady's
Girdle
, which leave the Reader much more
to be imagin'd than is exprest.

No Monarch but would give his Crown,

His Arms might do what this has done.

My Joy, my Grief, my Hope, my Love,

Did all within this Circle move;

A narrow Compass, and yet there

Dwells all that's good, and all that's fair.

Give me but what this Ribbon bound,

Take all the Rest the Sun goes round.

Father
Bouhours
, in his
Maniere de bien penser
, besides
these several Kinds of Thoughts, has the
true
, the
beautiful
,
the
soft
, the
natural
, the
simple
, the
gay
, and many
more, which has spun the Subject so very fine,
that it will not endure handling but by very tender
Fingers.

True Thoughts and false Thoughts are often confounded,
especially, if there's any Point, Glittering or Glaring
in the Latter. Something like distinguishing the one from
the other is attempted in the
Guardian
, N
o
110. But I
cannot help thinking that it does not deserve the Recommendation
with which it is introduced in that Paper. We
are told, the Remarks are very curious and just, and must
of Consequence conclude, the Applause which the Author
sinks, because 'twas in favour of himself, was so too.
A very pretty Way of returning a Compliment which he
could not accept of without Offence to his Modesty; but,
I humbly conceive, the Remarks are not very curious, if
they are just; the same having been made a Hundred
times before the publishing of them in the critical Letter;
and whoever would be at the Trouble of taking
Dryden

and
Lee
's Tragedies to pieces, would find enough of the
like Curiosities.

The first is,
Lee
makes one of his Persons a
Cartesian

Philosopher, 2 or 3000 Years before
Descartes
was born:
Why did not the Critick remember this too in the same
Tragedy
Oedipus
?

[Pg 41]

————As oft I have at
Athens
seen,

The Stage arise, and the big Clouds descend.

Several Hundred Years before there was such a Thing
heard of as a Stage at
Athens
.

The next Thing this Critick takes notice of, is
Dryden
's
making
Cleomenes
a
Copernican
2000 Years before

Copernicus
's Time. The Rest of the Criticisms turn upon
the Improbability that Don
Sebastian
King of
Portugal

understood Latin, tho' he never prayed to God in any other
Language; or that the Emperor of
Barbary
had ever
heard of the Names of
Bacchus
,
Cupid
,
Castor
, and
Pollux
,
or the Mufti of
Archimedes
, tho' we are credibly informed,
that most of the Greek and Roman Learning was
translated into
Arabick
; and it is well known that the
Arabians

were the greatest Encouragers of Arts and Sciences
for three or four Centuries, when they were buried all
over Christendom under the Rubbish of Monkery and
Barbarism; and the Revivers of Learning were obliged
to them for their Translations and Comments, which were
turned into
Latin
out of
Arabick
. I have not only read
of a Translation of
Aristotle
with Comments by
Aben
Rois
, and of
Euclid
by
Nassir Eddyn
, with Notes, but of
an
Arabick Ovid
, where the Fable is the Foundation of
the Work, and several other Classicks in the
Arabick

Tongue. How easy would it be to fill up such Critical Epistles
as that in the
Guardian
with as just and curious
Remarks out of the best Epick Poets! How has
Chaucer

confounded the Sacred
Scripture
History with Pagan
Fables:

There by the Fount
Narcissus
pin'd alone:

There
Sampson
was, and wiser
Solomon
:

Medea
's Charms were there.

Dryden
from
Chauc.

Ariosto
does the same in the xxxii Book of
Orlando
Furioso
:

Joshua
's Day seemed shorter than the same,

Shorter did seem the false
Amphytrion
's Night.

Harrington.

The same does
Tasso
,
Canto
iv of his
Jierusamme
:

There where
Cileno
's foul and loathsome Rout;
[Pg 42]

The
Sphinges
,
Centaurs
; there where
Gorgon
's fell,

There howling
Scilla
's, yawling round about:

There Serpents hiss, there seven mouth'd
Hydra
's yell,

Chimera
there spues Fire and Brimstone out,

And
Polyphemus
blind suporteth Hell.

Fairfax.

All understood of the Hell, which is the Punishment
of the Damned, according to the Christian Theology, and
here confounded with the fabled Empire of
Pluto
.
Spencer

too mixes Scripture History with the Fable:
Canto
ix.

The Years of
Nestor
nothing were to his,

Ne yet
Methusalem
, tho' longest liv'd;

For he remembred both their Infancies.

Nay
Milton
himself adorns the
Pandæmonium
with
Dorick Pillars, while
Adam
and
Eve
lived in the
Bowers

of Paradise before Man had a House to put his Head
in:

————Pilasters round

Were set, and Dorick Pillars overlaid

With golden Architrave.

He also borrows the Rivers of the Hell of the Heathens
for his Christian Poem:

Abhorred
Styx
, the Flood of deadly Hate,

Sad
Acheron
of Sorrow, black and deep,

Cocytus
nam'd, of Lamentation loud

Heard on her rueful Stream. Fierce
Phlegeton
,

Whose Waves of torrent Fire inflame with Rage.

Far off from these a flow and silent Stream

Lethe
the River of Oblivion rolls;

Which

Medusa
with
Gorgonian
Terror guards.

It has been hinted elsewhere, that 'tis ungenerous to
criticise on
Dryden
's Conduct and Sentiments, which 'tis
plain he varied at Pleasure, and wrote like a great Original,
whose Example was to be a Rule to others, and himself
to take Rules from none; but it is not true, as we read in
the above-cited
Guardian
,
That his very Faults have more
Beauty in them, than the most elaborate Compositions of
many more correct Writers
: For I will repeat some few
[Pg 43]

Lines that are monstrous, and then let the Reader judge
how they can be beautiful.

'Tis false, she is not ill, nor can she be;

She must be chaste, because she's lov'd by me.

————I'll squeeze thee like a Bladder,

Or make thee groan thy self away in Air.

She who dares love, and for that Love dares die,

And knowing this, dares yet love on, am I.

Good Heaven thy Book of Fate before me lay,

But to tear out the Journal of this Day.

But take what Friends, what Armies thou canst bring,

What Worlds, and when you are united All,

Then I will thunder in your Ears; she shall.

————Fight, love, despair;

And I can do all this, because I dare.

What are ten thousand Subjects, such as they?

If I am scorn'd, I'll take my self away.

Thou shalt not wish her thine, thou shalt not dare

To be so impudent as to dispair.

There's not a Star of thine dares stay with thee,

I'll whistle thy tame Fortune after me.

I cannot repeat any more of it: These are Mr.
Dryden
's
Faults, in which, according to the
Guardian
, there
are more Beauties than in the most elaborate Pieces of
more correct Writers. I confess it grieves me to mention
such Enormities as these are: For no Man can do more
justice to Mr.
Dryden
's fruitful Imagination, and harmonious
Versification than my self: But it does not therefore
follow, that even Errour in him is more beautiful than
Regularity in others.

It I had more Room, and more Leisure, I should have
endeavour'd to explain the Difference between the several
Ways of Thinking. Some of them I have attempted,
and I hope it may stir up a greater Genius, to do in
English

as Pere
Bouhours
has done in
French
, which would
introduce a beautiful and just Manner both in Thought
and Expression. It would then be known why it is that
Archbishop
Tillotson
and Bishop
Sprat
are both esteem'd
[Pg 44]

Masters of the
English
Language; why Sir
William Temple
,
and Sir
Roger L'Estrange
, the
Tatler
, and the

Spectator
, are generally spoken of as fine Writers; though
their Manner is as different as their Faces. Every Thing
that pleases in Writing is with us, as I have already hinted,
resolved into Wit, whether it be in the Thought or
the Expression.
Nay some
, says the
Spectator
,
carry the
Notion of Wit so far, as to ascribe it to Puns and Quibbles,
and even to external Mimickry, and to look upon a
Man as an ingenious Person that can resemble the Tone,
Gesture, or Face of another.
With such admirable Judges
as these, Sir
Isaac Newton
's Discourse of
Fluxions
is very
witty, as the Machine called the
Orrery
was said to be
very
wittily
contrived. With these
Estcourt
,
Penkethman
,
and even
Norris
are Wits, as the
Spaniards
take the

Apes
to be, and that they won't speak because they would
not work. I have known two or three Actors who got into
Vogue by Grimace only, and acting Parts that had neither
Wit nor Sense in them.

Every one of the Kinds of right Thinking has its opposite,
as every Virtue has its Vice; and the Sublime
especially is apt to be mistaken in the Pomp and Puffiness
of Description. Of this Kind is that Passage, where
Mr.
Eachard
describes the Sea-Fight between the
English

and the
Dutch
, in the Time of the
Rump
.

"The Battle grew so fierce and so furious, that there
were scarce any Thing to be seen but Masts
overturn'd

into the Sea,
Splinters
flying on all Sides,
Sails
rent
and torn in Pieces, Cables and
Cordage
cut in sunder:

How it terrifies one!
In one Place a
Vessel
boarded, and
in a Moment the Men chaced off or blown up with the
Decks into the Air.
Four or Five Hundred Men would
not have made a Figure dreadful enough unless the
Wooden Decks had gone along with them.
And in
another was seen a Ship swallow'd up by the Waves
with several Hundreds of Men, and the Sea turn'd
red with Human Gore, and cover'd with dead Bodies,
and floating Parts of scatter'd Ships.
What's the Reason
that we freeze in the midst of so much
Fire
? This is
what the
French
call the Cold and the Puerile Stile.

Again; All which instead of dismaying the Combatants,
serv'd only to excite their Rage, and enflame
them to a more cruel and implacable Slaughter; and
[Pg 45]

the continual Outcries of miserable wounded Wretches
render'd them but the more bloody minded, and rouz'd
them to a more cruel and remorseless Revenge. The
rising Coasts on both Sides the Channel were violently
shaken with the resounding Thunders of the
roaring Guns, and those engag'd seem'd to be involv'd
in the Wreck of Nature."

This Fight was over against the Island of
Portland
, and
I really believe the pronouncing of these Words,
roaring
Guns
,
resounding Thunders
,
rising Coasts
,
Wreck of Nature
,
among the Rocks under the Light-houses, would have
as good an Effect with the Help of Eccho, as a Broadside
at Sea, which the Historian assures us at the same Time
shook the Hills of
England
and
France
. Whence comes
it that we read all this without the least Emotion, where
there is so much Affectation to move? Are we not so stun'd
with the Sound that the Sense is lost in it, and we are
no more concern'd than at the Sight of a Storm in a Half-penny
Picture?
Dryden
lets us a little into this Secret in
his
Preface
to
Troil.
and
Cress.
He is speaking of the
puffy Style,
the common Practice of those Writers, who
not being able to infuse a natural Passion into the Mind,
have made it their Business to ply the Ears, and to stun
their Judges by the Noise
. A better Judge than Mr.
Dryden

has directed us in this Matter.

The Words, which in Magnificence abound,

Grow tedious oft, and lose themselves in Sound.

Rosc.

This Way of Writing is much more easy than that
which is truly great and sublime, as in Liquors, 'tis easier
to give them Ferment and Froth, than Spirit and Purity.

There are more Authors
, says
Dryden
, who can make a

pompous Description, than who can write with an equal
and natural Stile
. He adds, that
Shakespear
himself did
not distinguish
the blown puffy Stile from true Sublimity
;
which could not wholly be attributed to the Time, because
we meet with the true Sublimity very often in
Spencer

and
Fairfax
, who were both Contemporaries with

Shakespear
, and
Spencer
much the elder. Two Lines of
Sir
John Denham
's, on a like Subject with that of
Echard
,
fills one with Horrour and Amazement.

[Pg 46]

Tost by a Whirlwind of tempestuous Fire,

A Thousand Wretches in the Air expire.

Mr.
Addison
observes after
Pere Bouhours
, That
it is
impossible for any Thought to be beautiful, which is not
just, and has not its Foundation in the Nature of Things:
That the Basis of all Wit is Truth, and that no Thought
can be valuable, of which good Sense is not the Ground-work
.
Therefore when Mr.
Echard
writes his
Oxcellency

for his
Excellency
, speaking of the Parliament's General
the Earl of
Essex
, the
Tyrannical
Parliament for the

Triennial
Parliament, the New
Noddle
for the
New Model

with respect to the Army, and the like, we are not to be
imposed upon by him, and to take it upon his bare Word
for Wit. Neither is there any Wit at all in his burlesquing
such Phrases as these;
Presence of God
,
Seeking
the Lord
,
Call of God
,
Jesus Christ
, &c. Which he
also would impose upon us for Witicisms.

His Descriptions are not all so lofty and sounding as
that of the
Sea-Fight
, particularly when he paints
Oliver
Cromwel
, without his Breeches, running away from the
Cavaliers in his
Drawers
only, and then turning back
upon them and beating them. Of this Kind is the incomparable
Picture of the Aldermen
Gloucester
: Their

Visages were pale, lean, and ugly; their Cloaths strange
and unusual; their Voices pert, shrill, and fearless
; Ambassadors

from the godly City of Gloucester
. His Similes
are not more elevated, especially that where he
compares the
Silent
and
Victorious
General Monk to
a Cat, and General
Lambert to a Mouse
. He watched
him as a Cat watches a Mouse, a singular Proof of his
Perfection in Eloquence, which naturally leads us to
Expression
,
and I doubt not the Historian thinks a finer
Historical Stile than his own is not to be met with.

As in Thoughts so in Expression, we in
England
are
apt to confound all the various Kinds under the general
Terms of good Language, and a fine Stile. The Sublime,
the Natural, the Didactick, the Narrative, the Tragick,
the Comick, the Polite, the Affected, are seldom rightly
distinguish'd, and the latter very often mistaken for the
Polite. The Admirers of Mr.
Echard
's History do, doubtless,
take what follows to have as much of the Sublime
in it as the
English
Tongue is capable of. It introduces
the glorious Reign of King
Charles
II.

[Pg 47]

Having gone through a stormy and tempestuous Season of
various Misery, we arrive at a sudden Brightness and
Splendour, a most unexpected Order, and glorious Calm and
Sunshine. The Splendour and Brightness harder to be born
than the preceeding Clouds and Darkness.
What is Stormy
and Tempestuous? what Brightness, Sunshine, and Splendour?
What Clouds and Darkness? but other Words for
the same Things, and instead of Amplification comes
under the Denomination of another Figure very common
in such puffy Rhetorick, call'd
Tautology
, which I am
afraid the Historian and his Admirers mistake for the Sublime,
there being but very few that can distinguish Sound
from Sense, or Wind from Spirit.
Let a Discourse be never
so fine
, says
Rapin
,
it loses its worth when 'tis out of
its Place, and appears affected
. Affectation in Stile has
the same Effect with ordinary Judges as Affectation in
Air has with Women and Fops. It passes upon them for
Politeness; and Delicacy, tho' there is nothing more vicious
in Language. I might fill a Volume with Examples
of this Vice, taken out of the Earl of
Clarendon
, and the
Archdeacon's Histories, but as I had never troubled my self
about them, had there been nothing in them but Want of
Method, and an affected Stile, I shall content my self with
two or three Observations only, which are sufficient to convince
all those that can judge right; and as for others, I
have not Leisure nor Words enough to attempt it.

He says the Sight of the
Gloucester
Aldermen at once

gave Mirth to the most severe Countenances, and Sadness
to the most cheerful Hearts
. What Idea can one have of
these
Cavaliers
, as he expresses himself, but that of some
Idiots whom we have seen to laugh and cry in a Breath.
He has two Expressions about Mines, which are very extraordinary,
both as he is a
Naturalist
and as he is an
Orator
:
The one is the
Brass-Mine
in
Cumberland
, the only

Brass-Mine
that ever was, or ever will be in the World.
A
Copper-Mine
might have been found out there, and a
Mine of
Lapis calaminaris
, which put together, would
produce
Brass
enough, if there were Ore enough. Where
he speaks of the Cleanliness of his Writing, he intimates,
that he is one of those who
dive into the rich Mines of
Nature
. What can one imagine about diving better than
that of a Duck and a Dog in a Pond, or Boys in the
Bath
?
To dive into a Mine, methinks, is like running a Man's
[Pg 48]

Head into a Rock. If he had said he had been digging
in the rich Mines of Nature, one might have expected
some Mettal to have come of it, of one Sort or another.
When the Parliament, that brought in King
Charles
II,
met the first Time, Mr.
Echard
says,
We are now arrived
at the
VAST
Day
, which I humbly conceive to be beyond
Conception, and a strange Specimen of the Author's
Talent in Elocution. He had a mind to make this Day
something
prodigious
and
uncommon
, and therefore swells
it up with an Epithet which bursts in the Operation.

VAST
might have been proper, if he had been speaking
of the Ton of
Heidelbergh
, or Admiral
Russel
's Punch
Bowl at
Lisbon
: But under what Figure will he put Day
for the Word
VAST
to become it well? Doctor
Littleton

in his Dictionary makes
VAST
to be
huge
,
burly
,

wide
,
broad
,
large
, and what is much less for the Archdeacon's
Purpose,
misshapen
,
ill-favoured
,
desolate
,
insatiable
,

outragious
; put Day to ever a one of them, and see
how the Coat fits. Mr.
Bailey
in his very good Dictionary
is contented with two or three Interpretations only, as a

huge Day
, a
spacious Day
.
Ludlow
, I believe, would
have followed
Littleton
, and then for
VAST
would
have understood
desolate Day
,
ill-shapen Day
,
insatiable
Day
; so dangerous is it for People to meddle with
Words which they do not understand. Of all the Blunders
in Expression which are to be avoided, there was
the best Provision made against this that could be, if a
Man had had the least Acquaintance with the politer
Authors, Monsieur St.
Evremont
having written a Dissertation
on this very Word
VAST
, and whoever reads it,
will pity a Writer who could fall into so gross an Errour, if
there were no Malice in what he had written. I suppose
that almost all Mr.
Echard
's Readers have taken this

VAST
in the Sense he intended for
Important
, and if
he had said this
Mountainous Day
, it would have done
as well: They would have expected a Birth from the
Mountain, and the Arch-Deacon's History is a Labour of
the same Kind.

As we in
England
are apt to confound Sentiments and
Expressions, so we do the same by Talents, and think if
a Man can make a
School-Book
or two, he can write a
History.
Jeremiah Collier
wrote a
short View of the Stage
,
which sold wonderfully, and immediately the Booksellers
[Pg 49]

hir'd him to write Three Histories in Folio: And I question
not but, because Sir
Isaac Newton
has outdone all Philosophers
in his Treatise of
Fluxions
, they would employ him
in
Heroick
Poetry, if he were young enough, and would
be employ'd by them. There was a
Pertness
in
Collier
's
Stile, which was mistaken for Vivacity, and tho' there
cannot be any Thing more affected, yet it recommends his

Essays
,
Views
, &c. as somewhat in the Perfection of our
Language. I wonder Dr.
Felton
should forget him, when
he mentions Sir
Roger L'Estrange
, Mr.
Trap
, and other
masterly Writers. You cannot name
Collier
's
Views
,

Essays
, &c. in Company, but some body or other immediately
cries out,
Ay! that's Fine.
Wonderful fine, as
will be seen presently.

In his Essays he has this Expression,
A Man may act
an Excellency for the Satisfaction if Significancy
, which
has the same Effect in Prose, as it is observ'd of some
good Verses, that the
Smoothness
or
Roughness
of the Numbers
are an Image of the Roughness or Smoothness of the
Thing. You can hardly pronounce these Words without
a prim Look, and screwing up your Mouth with the Affectation
of a Girl at a
Boarding-School
. Would one imagine
that this was said by the same Author in another
place;
Nothing is more nauseous than to be affected
: And
yet see further,
Don't let Miss suffer her Heels to get too
much into her Head
, not to say any Thing about the
Attitude
,
which would be very extraordinary in a Picture.
Again,
Seeing and Hearing are the most creditable Senses;
the Brain has an unpromising Aspect
, which cannot be
known without Dissection. What Idea does this leave
upon the Mind? or this,
A
Prince
made but a lame Figure
in Comparison with our
Apostle
.
One would think

Collier
had Prince
Prettiman
and the
Spanish
Fryer in his
Head when he wrote it. He is so fond of this Conceit,
that he endeavours to prove, in his Essay on Theft, and
elsewhere, that our Saviour's Disciples were Men of Quality,
well-born, and well-bred, and if they did fish at any
time, 'twas only for their Pleasure. As the
Barber
of

Northampton
told
Estcourt
, He was a Doctor by Profession,
and shav'd only for his Diversion. But
Collier
seems to
have less Regard for his Brotherhood in the last Centuries,
when he informs us that by Queen
Elizabeth
's Injunctions
a Clergyman could not marry till he had made
[Pg 50]

his Complaint against Celibacy before two Justices of the
Peace, and gain'd their Consent, and the
good Will of the
Master or Mistress where the Damsel serv'd
, by which he
gives us to understand, that soon after the Reformation
the Priests Wives were all
Abigail
's.

Collier
's Dialogues serve two principal Ends, the one
to carry on an Argument the more freely and loosely; and
the other, which is not the least, to give himself a fat
Figure in his own Picture, for he himself is the Man who
has always the best of the Dispute.

Well, I can't stand the Force of your Argument:

You are smart, you have brought your self well off.

Thus he conquers his
Alphius
, and compels him
to
own, That the Priests are an independant State
; and
thus Boys build Houses of Cards to blow them down
when they have done. What a Parcel of Flowers and
Graces might one pick up in his Writings, if it was more

a propos
, such as
Slender Difficulty
,
Lean Temper
,

touchy Point
,
Cheek by Joule
,
to con over
,
to be Uppish
,

Intents and Purposes
,
to glitter upon the Senses
,
Enrichments
,

renverse
,
Deconcert
,
bigger Entertainment of the
Soul
,
don't
,

,

,
'tis
,
it's
,
at's
, and the frequent
Use of Proverbs.

Where there's Life there's Hope.

One Swallow makes no Summer,
&c.

The Use of Proverbs is so far from giving Disgust in
common Conversation, especially in the Country, that
'tis look'd upon to be Wit as well as Mimickry, Buffoonry,
Pun, Quibble,
&c.
and you would be star'd at if you
should object against either of them as the effect of Ignorance
or Folly. The
Spectator
takes Notice that Puns
made a considerable Figure on the Banks of
Cam
, and
Proverbs must needs do no less on the Banks of
Isis
, when
so great a Scholar as
Edward Llwyd
set the Example,
two in one Paragraph.

Rome
was not built in a Day.

Better late than never.

On laisse aux Discours du Peuple les manieres de
s'appliquer en Proverbes.
'Tis for the Vulgar only to express
themselves by Proverbs. But what are Proverbs,
&c.
[Pg 51]

to
Collier
's huddling of Metaphors, a Vice in Eloquence
which is hardly taken Notice of in
English
Writings;
To
be always pouring in Oil, is the Way to overset the Flame
and extinguish the Lamp: If you lay a Country constantly
under Water, you must spoil the Soil.
Here Fire and
Water most lovingly agree together to do the same Business.

To overset a Flame
is a fine Way of speaking, and
as easily to be conceiv'd, as to overset a Cockboat or a

Wherry
. Again,
I fancy we shall sift the Gentleman to
the Bran, and make him run the Gauntlet before he gets
clear.
The
Bran
Gentleman having run the Gauntlet,
we will add one Instance more, and have done with his
Metaphors;
They will glean up the best Thoughts, they
will draw of the Spirit of the Argument when the Mine
has been work'd by such Hands.
The
Gleaner
, the Chymist,
and the Miner, are at once at work for him in the
same short Sentence. If the Writer or Reader's Head can
be clear under such Operations, it will be a Wonder. The

Spectator
has a Remark on this Subject, equally pleasant
and judicious:
Thus I have known a Heroe compar'd to a

Thunder-bolt
, a
Lion
, and the
Sea
,
all
and each of them
proper Metaphors for Impetuosity, Courage, and Force;
but by bad Management it hath so happen'd, that the

Thunder-bolt
hath overflow'd the Banks, the
Lion
has
been darted through the Skie, and the Billows have roll'd
not of the
Lybian
Desart
; neither of which is so bad as

Collier
's burning and drowning the same Thing at the
same Time.

The
Declamatory
Stile, another great Vice in Eloquence,
is the Characteristick of these
Essays
; tho' I question not
but it is thought to be the very Cream of the Discourse.
If 'tis excuseable any where it is in Country Pulpits,
where, if a Parcel of Words are well put together, we
should not be too scrupulous about the Sense.
Then Commerce
must give way to Religion, Baptism sway the Indenture,
and the Gospel govern the
Exchange
.
Are not
the Gospel, Baptism, and Religion, the Exchange, Indenture,
and Commerce, the same Things in the
Contrast
.
I am far from affecting a foreign Word when we
have as good a one of our own, much less when we have
a better; and
Attitude
and
Contrast
may be supplied by

Posture
and
Opposition
, if the Reader pleases; out the
former was used for Decorum sake, the idea being too
[Pg 52]

gross when in an
English
Dress. The Author is again
declaiming:
It may be the Failing of Drunkenness is imperceptible
in the single Instance, 'twill rise in the Sum
;

To go always a little out of the Way makes a strange Mistake
upon the progress
;
A Grain will grew to a Burthen
by Addition
;
To be always dipping an Estate, is the Way
to turn Beggar
;
A Drop that's perpetually pelting Will
make a Stone give way.
How new, how eloquent is all
this, and that which comes after! He is preaching to
the Booksellers about selling
Arian Books, Sceptical
Books, Books of Divorce, Impotence,
&c.
Whatever they
think on't,
Atheism
and
Lewdness
is the most fatal Mortality;—The
Plague of the Heart the most frightful Distemper—Infection
is safer lodged in the Veins, than in the Will—A
Man had much better be poyson'd in his Blood,
than in his Principle.
The Stream is the same still, but
as a Boar pisses it comes by Spirts. Again,
Are we never
to do any Thing without a Majority; If we are govern'd
by Numbers, we shall live strangely; If you go to
Poll, Sense and Conscience will lose it in most Cases.
Of all
the Modern Criticks, who have given us Rules, Dr.
Felton

upon the
Classicks
is the Author, who seems to have
stood most upon his own Legs: Others have learnt much
of the
French
, and have been much blam'd for it by
those who have and have not read their Books.
Rymer

confesses the
French
began the
Art
of
Criticism
among
the Moderns:
They fell not to it in earnest
, says he, in
his Preface to
Rapin
,
till the
Royal Academy
was founded,

and
Cardinal
Richelieu
encourag'd and rally'd all the
scatter'd Wits under his Banner: Then
Malherbe
reform'd
their ancient licentious Poetry.

Malherbe
died Seven
Years before the
Royal Academy
was thought of; however
he did begin the Reformation of the
French
Poetry,
and was happily follow'd by
Voiture
,
Sarazin
,
Maynard
,

Godeau
, &c. The
Academy
have indeed assum'd to themselves
the sole Glory of refining the
French
Tongue, tho'
they can by no means engross the Merit of it.
Malherbe

began it before they had a Being, and several eminent

French
Authors have written since, who were not of the

Academy
, as St.
Evremont
,
Menage
,
&c.
But there's something
pleasant in the Complements that are paid to it, and
the
Antiquaries
have found out just such another Society
in
Rome
, under the Patronage of
Augustus
, to refine the
[Pg 53]

Roman
Language, which, by the way, had been refined
before by
Terence
,
Lucretius
,
Cicero
,
Hortensius
, and their
Contemporaries, at the latter End of the Republick. The
Learned Antiquaries go so far as to name the
Roman Academicians
,

Mecænas
,

Pollio
,

Plotius
,
Valgius
,

The Two
Messala's
,

The Two
Bibulus's
,

Piso
, the Father,

Servius
,
Fulvius
,

Tibullus
,

Horace
.

Ovid
perhaps was left out because he was in Exile at

Tomos
; but why could they not have put in
Livy
,
Propertius
,
&c. They have given this Academy, the Temple
and Library of
Apollo
, to meet and study in, and it
is pretended, that
Horace
's Epistle to the
Piso's
was written
by Direction of the Academy, and if there had ever
been such an Academy at all, one might the sooner have
given Credit to it. The
French
Academy set an Example
to other learned and ingenious Men, to make themselves
Masters of their own Language, and the Encouragement
they met with from
Lewis
XIV produced an
Age of Poets, Orators, and Criticks. The latter have
done more towards explaining the
Classicks
than had been
done before from the
Augustan
Age to their own.
They threw Pedantry and Jargon out of their Writings,
and render'd them as polite as judicious. Such are the
Criticisms of
Rapin
,
Bossu
,
Segrais
,
Boileau
,
Bouhours
,
and
Dacier
, who are all read with like Profit and Pleasure;
and this is the Reason of the frequent Use of
them, and not an Affectation of foreign Phrases, and technical
Cant, as is insinuated by such as never read, or
never understood them, and by such too as have not
only both read and understood them, but have learnt of
them all the Reading they have, and yet make use of no
other Names than
Quintillian
,
Longinus
,
Donatus
,
Eustathius
,
and the Ancients. This is very common, and
I could easily prove it upon those who have charg'd
others with Ignorance and Illiterature. The Reading

French
Authors is inconceivably beneficial to such as do
not understand
Latin
so well as Mr.
Dryden
, and
Greek

so well as Mr.
Pope
: They will learn as much of the

Greek
History from
Ablancourt
's
Thucydides
, and of the
[Pg 54]

Latin
from
Du Ryer
's
Livy
, as they could from the Originals.
And as to the Poets, they had better read Madam

Dacier
's
Homer
, and
Segrais
's
Virgil
, which they
do understand, than the Original
Homer
and
Virgil

which they do not. My Lord
Roscommon
owns of the

French
,

The choicest Books that
Rome
or
Greece
have known,

Their excellent Translators made their own.

And tho' in all Translations the Spirit and Beauty of
the Original must in a great measure be lost by Transfusion,
yet in History especially you are sure to have the
Method, the Facts, and the Politicks, tho' you have not
the Strength and Ellegance of the Style.
Dryden
tells
the late Duke of
Bucks
, in the Dedication to his
Virgil
;

Impartially Speaking, the
French
are as much better Criticks,
as they are worse Poets.
The Latter is incontestable;
and not to mention
Milton
, who is above all Parallel.
They have nothing of
Epick
Poetry so good as our King

Arthur
; neither are their
Corneille
and
Racine
a Match
for our
Shakespear
and
Otway
. They have no Body to
name against
Wycherley
,
Etherege
,
Shadwel
,
Congreve
,

Vanburgh
,
Steel
.
Moliere
, the best of their Comick Poets,
could write
Scapius
,
Dandins
,
Sganarelles
, and all Kinds
of Farce perfectly well; but for Wit and Humour, Repartee,
Polite Conversation, for what the Criticks call the

Vis Comica
, you must have recourse to the
English
Comedies,
if you would know what it is. A
French Marquis
,
as
Moliere
shew'd him upon his Stage, would only make
a very good Taylor upon ours. They have no
Hopkins

for Elegy, no
Philips
for Pastoral:
Scarron
will hardly
serve for a
Ralpho
to our
Hudibras
. In the
Ode
, I think,

Malherbe
is at least equal to
Cowley
, and
Voiture
and
Sarazin

are not behind our
Suckling
and
Waller
, in the
gallant Way: Nor is our
Prior
behind their
La Fontaine

for Taletelling. On the other Hand, I am afraid we
must allow, that we have no Translation in
English
equal
to
Seagrais
's
Virgil
for Intelligence of the Original, and a
correct as well as harmonious Diction, especially if the
Character given of it by
Ruæus
is just. Did we look into
other Sciences, we should find our selves more than a
Match for them; What Names have they to set against
our
Newton
and
Halley
in the Mathematicks, and our
[Pg 55]

Sydenham
and
Willis
in
Physick
. They have no
Bacon
,
no
Boyle
in Philosophy. In History indeed they have a

Varillas
and a
Maimbourg
for our
Nelson
and
Brady
, and
doubtless the Royal Historiographers will, in the History
of
Lewis
XIV, come up to the
Grand Rebellion
, and Mr.

Echard
's History for Impartiality and Truth. If I were
a
Frenchman
I should make a Start here, and cry out,
What is their
Tureune
and their
Conde
to our
Marlborough
,
and their Great
Monarch
, who took Pleasure in
Slaughter and Devastation, to our Glorious King
George
,
whose only Care and Delight is to maintain Liberty and
Peace.

Dr.
Felton
declares we began to refine our Language
much sooner than the
French
, and that the Writers in
Queen
Elizabeth
's Reign are far preferable to
Shakespear
,

Fletcher
,
Waller
,
Suckling
,
May
,
Sands
, and all the Writers
from the
Gunpowder
Plot to the Restoration. He
will not be advis'd by the best Critick in Poetry, as he represents
him. Mr.
Dryden
, who speaking of
Beaumont

and
Fletcher
, writes thus;
I am apt to believe the
English

Language in them arrived to its Perfection
: They
wrote between the Beginning of King
James
I and the
Reign of King
Charles
II, a Period in which Dr.
Felton

makes the
English
Language to have declin'd; though,
if I were permitted to give Judgement, I should continue
the Improvement of our Tongue till the Time of the

Spectator
, and the Translation of
Homer
, where, I think,
it is in the greatest Purity and Elegance, and that one of
the first deplorable Signs of its Declension was even the
Discourse upon the
Classicks
.
Dryden
himself continues
the good Taste till the Opening of the Long Parliament
1640, when, if you'l believe him, the Muses were struck
dead at a Blow, abandon'd to a barbarous Race of Men,
Enemies of all good Learning, such as
Selden
,
Whitlock
,

Bathurst
,
Wilkins
, and the immortal
Milton
. This
Passage should have been transplanted into the two famous
Histories of those Times, publish'd since King

William
's Death, particularly that of the
Grand Rebellion
,
which Dr.
Felton
protests is the most impartial one
that ever was written; but it is very well it does not stand
in need of his Certificate, for there would have been
great Exception taken against his Authority. As good
[Pg 56]

a Word as the Doctor gives Mr.
Dryden
as a
Critick
,

Dryden
out-does him in his own Panegyrick.

Let
Dryden
with new Rules our Stage refine,

And his great Models form by this Design.

This Piece of Modesty in Verse is excelled by another
in Prose;
Our present Poets,
himself the Top of them
,
have far surpast all the antient and modern Writers of
other Countries.

Thus has he put himself above
Homer
,
Sophocles
,
Virgil
,

Horace
,
Corneille
,
Racine
,
Boileau
, &c. Notwithstanding
we were so happy in Mr.
Dryden
's Criticisms,
Doctor
Felton
is of Opinion the Art is not brought enough
to Perfection among us; and therefore earnestly
sollicites Sir
Richard Steel
to write Comments upon
Homer

and
Virgil
, as Mr.
Addison
has done upon
Milton
.
I am satisfied Sir
Richard Steel
did not keep his Countenance
if ever that Passage of the Doctor's came in his
Way. I will not say the same of Mr.
Trap
, who, they
tell me, is a Poet by his Place, or a
made
Poet, better by
half than one born so; but if Doctor
Felton
had foreseen
that the ingenious Gentleman would have came off
as He did with
Virgil
, and in what a sad Place Doctor

Swift
would find his Translation, I believe he would have
postpon'd the Encomium,
What a polite Critick may do
if he pleases
, says the Doctor,
and in how different an
Aspect
Criticism
appears, when formed by Men of Parts
and Fire, we may see in Mr.
Trap
; and the Encomium
continues for a Page or two: But the aforesaid Translation
having cut the Matter short, I will repeat no more
of it.

Cowley
was in as great Vogue 60 or seventy Years ago,
as any Composer or Translater of our Time has been,
and Doctor
Felton
without knowing that his Character is
worn, informs us, that his
Davideis
is as good an Epick
Poem as the
Ilias
, that his Lyricks are as good as
Pindar
's
or
Horace
's, that he wrote Elegies as well as
Tibullus
,
Epistles as well as
Ovid
, Pastorals as well as
Theocritus
;
and that his
Cutter of Colmanstreet
is as good a Comedy
as the
Adelphi of Terence
. The Doctor's own Words are;

He rivalled the
Greek
and
Latin
Poets in every Thing
but Tragedy.
His saying so is the more remarkable, for
that he had seen the Preface to
Dryden
's Fables, wherein
that incomparable Critick, as he terms him, says
[Pg 57]

Cowley
is sunk in his Reputation, and the late Duke of

Bucks
in his Essay acknowledges as much:

Cowley
might boast to have perform'd his Part,

Had he with Nature joyn'd the Rules of Art:

But ill Expression gives sometimes Allay

To noble Thoughts——————

Tho' All appears in Heat and Fury done,

The Language still must soft and easy run.

Doctor
Felton
in Praise of Criticism tells us, with equal
Elegance and Perspicuity,
If the Rules had not been
given, we had not been troubled with
many fewer
Writers:

And in the Pursuit of his own excellent Work, he
declares,
He has tempered the
Briskness
of Thought with
the Sedateness of Judgement.
The
French
have their
Pensees
Brusques
, but the Doctor could not fall so low as that.

Brusque
signifying
blunt
,
rash
, and the like. This
Briskness

is, I suppose, more agreeable to the Conception of
a certain Bookseller, who being written to by a certain
Squire for a
brisk History
, sent him by the next Carrier
that of
Don Quixot
. This was thirty Years ago, before
we were so well furnished with
brisk Histories
as we have
been since.

I take
brisk
in our Tongue to be to
lively
, as
pert
is
to
witty
: But I cannot depend on my own Judgement;
the Translator of
Homer
having used
Briskness
in the
same Sense as Doctor
Felton
uses it:
Heaven and Earth
became engaged in the Subject, by which it rises to a great
Importance, and is hastened forward into the briskest
Scenes of Action.
If that Author could bear the least
Objection to any Thing that belongs to him, I would
ask the Reader whether he does not fancy there is some
Affectation in the Expression. But let that pass; if we
are rightly informed, the Word
Brisk
is in the
Teutonick
Friesch
, which is in plain English
Frisk
, and then for
the Gods and Demi-gods to frisk up and down the Field
of Action, or the Doctor to frisk up and down his Closet
is very indecorous. The Duke of
Buckingham
in the
Rehearsal

seems to take
Brisk
in the latter Sense, as when
Thunder and Lightning act their Parts on the Stage.
The former says, I am the
bold Thunder
, the latter the

brisk Lightning I
. And not at all to derogate from the
Character of Lightning, which has been so serviceable to
[Pg 58]

all Sorts of Poetry and Poets, I cannot help confirming
my Opinion by a very common Simile, and saying
As
brisk as bottled Ale
.

Among all the Refiners of our Tongue, 'tis the vulgar
Notion, that Sir
Roger L'Estrange
was most eminent.
True it is, Doctor
Felton
owns he was good for
nothing but
Banter
and
Railing
; for that is what we in

England
generally mean by Raillery. Tho'
Smith
and

Johnson
in the
Rehearsal
are not the most lively Characters;
yet their Dialogue with
Bayes
is what the
French

call
Raillery
. We in
England
do mean very often the
Dialogue of
Billinsgate
, where it is common enough to hear
one Fish-Woman cry to another,
No more of your Raillery
,
which is there the worst Sort of Railling; and for that
and Banter the Doctor assures us
L'Estrange
was most
proper. The same say I, and that he understood no more
of true Eloquence than he did of
Greek
, out of which
the Booksellers hired him to translate
Josephus
, and he
did it from the
French
Translation. The Philosopher
Seneca
's
Works he pretended to translate from the
Latin
,
and I wish Mr.
Trap
would translate the following Phrases
in his
Seneca
's
Morals
back into that Tongue again,

One good Turn is the shoeing Horn to another.

He does
me Good in spite of my Teeth.

After a Matter of eight
Years
; and this into
Greek
for
Esop
's Fables, The
Moon
was in a heavy Twitter
: Yet I'm satisfied these fine
Sayings are some of those that gained him the Reputation
of being a polite Writer of
English
: I have heard
that about the Moon very much commended, which
shews that we are not sufficiently sensible how mean
Words debase a Thought.
There's nothing
, says
Boileau
,

which debases a Discourse more than mean Words.
A mean Thought exprest in noble Terms, is generally
better than the most noble Thoughts exprest in mean
Terms.
I know no greater Instance of the ill Effect of
mean Terms, than what we find in two Verses of Mr.

Montague
's Epistle to the Lord
Dorset
on King
William
's
Victory at the
Boyne
. 'Tis in the greatest Heat
of that glorious Action, and in the Middle of the
Sublime
,
which is not wanting in that Poem.

Stop, stop, brave Prince! What does your Muse, Sir, faint!

Proceed, pursue his Conquest. Faith I can't.

[Pg 59]

Mr.
Philips
's Poems, the
splendid Shilling
and
Cyder
,
are full of Instances where mean Thoughts are raised by
noble Expressions, and they are wonderfully pleasing; as
in
Cyder
; this of the
Pear-Tree
.

What tho' the Pear Tree rival not the Worth

Of
Ariconian
Products, yet her Freight

Is not contemn'd, and her wide branching Arms

Best screen thy Mansion from the fervent Dog,

Adverse to Life. The wintry Hurricanes

In vain employ their Roar; her Trunk unmov'd,

Breaks the strong Onset, and controuls their Rage;

Chiefly the
Bosbury
, whose large Increase,

Annual in sumptuous Banquets, claims Applause.

Thrice acceptable
Bevrage
! could but Art

Subdue the floating
Lee
,
Pomona
's self

Would dread thy Praise, and shun the dubious Strife.

Be it thy Choice, when Summer Heats annoy,

To sit beneath her leavy Canopy,

Quaffing rich Liquids, Oh! how sweet t'enjoy

At once her Fruits, and hospitable Shade.

I have never met with any Author who so happily imitated
the manner and stile of
Milton
as
Philips
has done,
and there seems to be hardly any other Difference than
that of the Subjects they wrote of.

What I have quoted out of
L'Estrange
is nothing to
the Delicacy of a modern Writer of Plays, who without
Wit, Language, Learning, or Manners, wrote three or four
Farces, which took as much as
Pradon
's in
France
; but
the
English
have not recollected themselves so soon as
the
French
did; for
Pradon
out-liv'd the Vogue he was
in, and became a greater Jest than ever he had made.
What think ye of our Poet's Delicacy and Wit, who in a
gallant Letter to his Mistress, tells her,
He's gall'd with
riding, Love is forging Darts in his Belly; he's a Dog
in a Doublet
, &c. There's a deal of graver Nonsense
with it, but it being mostly
Blasphemy
, I dare not repeat
it. This Author had his Portion of temporary
Fame.
Ogilvy
had his Day, and
Dryden
says:

Fame, like a little Mistress of the Town,

Is gain'd with Ease; but then she's lost as soon.

[Pg 60]

However, as long as the Credit lasts, these temporary Authors
bear the Port of the greatest Genius, are clapt
and star'd at, as those Merchants who are driving in their
Coaches to Bankrupcy, have generally the best Equipage.
What are become of the
Marots
, the
Ronsards
,
the
Scuderies
of our neighbour Nation, yet these Writers
were infinitely superiour to what most of our taking
Authors have been. Could any Body have thought
that Sir
Richard Baker
's Chronicle would ever have past
from the Justice's Hall Window to the Butler's Cellar, or
that
Cowley
's
Mistress
would have lost all her Charms in
thirty Years Time, and become a Cast-Off for City Prentices
and Lawyers Clerks, to say nothing of
Orinda
,
Flatman
,
&c. Yet these Writers were Originals which raises
their Merit much above all Sorts of Translators, and it
ought to be a Lesson to all Poets and Historians, whether
first Hand or second Hand, to pay the World for
their Applause with Modesty, which is the surest Way
to keep it in a good Humour;
Since 'tis Posterity only
,
says
Boileau
,
which sets a Value upon all Writings, you
must not, as admirable as you take a modern Author to
be, presently put him upon a Level with those Writers
who have been admired for so many Ages, because one cannot
be sure his Works will pass with Glory to the next.
Indeed without going far for Examples, How many Authors
have we seen admired in our Age, whose Glory is
vanished in a very few Years. How were
Balzac
's Works
admired thirty Tears ago?
So much that Cardinal
Richelieu

at the same Time that he was meditating the universal
Monarchy for the Crown of
France
, wrote in Vindication
of them. The Bishop of
Rochester
did the
same for
Cowley
; but neither the Cardinal nor the Bishop
could defend them from the Fate of all Temporary
Authors. Neither
Cowley
nor
Balzac
are now any more
mentioned in
France
or
England
. And the main Reason
why they lost their Credit was for want of duly considering
what their particular Talents were adapted to;
for that they had both very great Talents is universally
acknowledged,
Mons. de
Balzac
a passe toute sa vie a
ecrire des lettres, dont il n'a jamais pu attraper le veritable
Charectere.
Balzac
spent all his Time in writing
Letters, but could never hit the true Character.

Cowley

applied himself to Poetry, and never enough knew the
[Pg 61]

Power and Harmony of Numbers. He had a great deal
too much Wit to charm his Mistress with his Passion.
Very few of us are let into this Secret. We cannot believe
that a Poet can have too much Wit, and indeed
the Offence given that Way is not very common. The
last Duke of
Bucks
rightly instructs us:

Another Fault which often does befall,

Is when the Wit of some great Poet shall

So overflow, as to be none at all.

}

Again,

That silly Thing we call sheer Wit avoid.

This probably was a Rebuke to the Author of the

Plain-Dealer
and
Country-Wife
, who has transgressed
in this kind as much as any Body, and was the best
able to do it. The Author of the
Relapse
is not entirely
free from this Censure, nor the Authors of
Love for
Love
, and the
Funeral
. But it will not be more surprising
than it is true, that
Peter Motteux
declared he had
taken a great deal of pains with a Character in a Farce
of his, to bring it within the Duke of
Buckingham
's
Rule in those Places where he told me he had given it
too much Wit. Mr.
Walsh
, one of the greatest Criticks
of our Nation, observes, that the Softness, Tenderness, and
Violence of Passion, are wanting in Mr.
Cowley
's Love
Verses, insomuch that he
could hardly fancy he was in
Love when he wrote them
.
Pref.
to
Lett.
Yet there
were Variety and Learning enough in them, and more
Wit than in all our witty Poets since the Restoration,
excepting those above-mentioned. Mr.
Wycherly
, who
wrote as good Comedies as any in the
English
, or any
other Tongue, did not value himself so much upon them
as on a Folio of as bad Verses as any.
Creech
having had
Success in
Lucretius
, was put upon translating
Horace
,
and it is said by
Dryden
, that he might lose so much
of his Reputation, as to prevent Rivalship. Nay,
Butler
,
tho' he knew the Follies of Mankind so perfectly
well, did not perceive that there is no greater Folly
than to undertake what one is not fit for, and was persuaded
to let
Hudibras
translate
Ovid
. On this Rock
many Authors have split, who would have succeeded had
they consulted their Talents, and taken the right Course:
but it is a general Maxim with us in
England
, Verses
[Pg 62]

are Verses. He that can write one Thing, can write another,
and till our Taste is so refined, that we can distinguish
the Good and the Bad in the various Kinds of
Thinking, Writers will not be at the Pains to consult
their Talents, but content themselves with pleasing their
own Fancy, or that of the Publick, by which Means,
like Flies, they make a buzzing for a Day or two, and
are forgotten for ever. The
Spectator
very judiciously animadverts
on this Weakness:
Our general Taste in
England

is for Epigram, Turns of Wit, and forced Conceits,
which have no manner of Influence, either for the bettering
or enlarging the Mind of him who reads them,
and have been carefully avoided by the greatest Writers,
both among the Antients and Moderns.
He adds after
Mr.
Dryden
,
The Taste of most of our
English
Poets is extreamly

Gothick
, which I have endeavoured to banish in
several of my Speculations
.

Another remarkable Observation of Dr.
Felton
's is, that
the
best Performers are the best Judges
. He has only

Horace
against him of the Antients, and
Dacier
of the
Moderns, as is already observed in this Essay. I believe
no Body will deny, but Mr.
Walsh
before-mentioned was
one of our best Judges of Regularity and Wit, yet hardly
any Body will say he was one of our best Performers. There's
nothing more common with small Genius's and small Judges,
than to demand of all Criticks
to write themselves
before
they criticise upon others Writings. They would stare if it
should be said, that
Dursey
knew no more of Poetry
than he did of Philosophy, nor of
English
than of
Hebrew
;
though it is very true, if it be understood of the
Art of Poetry, and the Beauty of Language; yet, that
he was a Performer, is I doubt not well known to the
Doctor, and well approved of. To teach us good Language
by Example, Dr.
Felton
expresses himself thus elegantly
and unaffectedly.
When I wrote these Sheets, my
Lord
Landsdown
's Poems lay dispersed up and down in
the Miscellanies; but some kind Hand
, as for Instance the
Bookseller, upon a very laudable Motive,
hath assembled
those scattered Stars, and added another Lyre to the Constellation
;
which, though it is meant, to do singular Honour
to those Poems, must have an ill Effect in astronomical
Observations; it makes thirteen to the Dozen in the
twelve Houses, and must cause as much Confusion, as
[Pg 63]

two Signs of the Harp in a short Lane. The Modesty
of the following Passage adds as much to its Merit as to
the Truth of it:
If I offered any Thing which is not
commonly observed, I hope it will not be interpreted any
Singularity, but such as may render your Lordship more
eminent and distinguished in the World
; and having taught
his noble Pupil what he should imitate, he gives him
warning what he should avoid, and that is the Reading
any Thing written by a
Presbyterian
:
What crude indigested
Volumes! How many tedious Sheets without Argument
or Consistency, are the Writings of some of the
Dissenters
!

whom does he mean, such as
Bates
,
Manton
,

How
,
Pool
,
Clarkson
,
Alsop
, &c. He and some other
good Church-Criticks make
Presbyterianism
to be a Sort
of
Hellebore
, if you do but snuff it up in your Nose you
run mad immediately. Thence it is, that the
Presbyterians

are termed
Fanatici
, by the learned and sober
Writers of our two famous Universities. Is it expected,
that every Orthodox Doctor should know as much as
Bishop
Stillingfleet
, or write as well as Archbishop
Tillotson
?
Where is the Reason or Justice of censuring a
Body of Men for the Enthusiasm and Ignorance of a few?
Would this Doctor suffer the Tables to be turn'd, and a
Judgement to be made of the Writings of good Church-men,
by the Argument and Consistency of the Works, with
which the learned World are obliged by those of the Country
Clergy, whose Pieces can crawl to the Press, whether in
Prose or Verse, Meditations or Hymns. I do verily believe
he did not think of Dr.
Bates
, when he fell thus furiously
on Dissenters, or had ever seen any of his Writings, which
are as polite as the Politest of our Age; the Sentiments as
pious, as great, as noble, and as just, according to the
Subject, and the Language as pure and as harmonious.
What can be more so, than this Passage of his
Harmony
of the divine Attributes
, speaking of the Fall of
Adam
:

Prodigious Pride! He was scarce out of the State of Nothing,
no sooner created but he aspired to be as God; not
content with his Image, he would rob God of his Eternity
to live without End; of his Sovereignty to command without
Dependance; of his Wisdom to know all Things without
Reserve. Infinite Insolence! that Man the Son of
Earth, forgetful of his Original, should usurp the Prerogatives,
which are essential to the Deity, and set himself up
[Pg 64]

a real Idol, was a Strain of the same Arrogancy which
corrupted the Angels.
This is what Dr.
Felton
calls
Presbyterian
Crudity
. It is strange, but it is true, that there
is a Narrowness of Soul, and a Conceit in some of our
Ecclesiasticks founded on the Establishment which we do
not meet with in others; nay, not in those who pretend
to Supremacy and Infallibility. Father
Bouhours
, though
as zealous a Jesuit as any in
France
, yet had so just a
Notion of every one's Merit in polite Learning, that he
freely owns the Refinement of the
French
Tongue, and
the
French
Manners was owing to those of the reformed
Religion, even to
Presbyterians
.
Nous devons aux dernieres
Heresies une partie de l'Embellissement de notre Langue, &
de la politesse de notre Siecle.

And another
French
Bigot tells us;
One of their Historians
has observed, that the pretended Reformers began to
speak well and write well, and were the First that shewed
their Way to others
. They were all of them
Presbyterians
:

————Parvos femando libellos

Sucratis populumq; rudem amorcando parolis.

Our
Staunch
Criticks will not allow, that a
Presbyterian

ever had or could have any Wit or any Eloquence,
though it was only to make an ill Use of it. No, no
Body must be well-born or well-bred, that is without the
Pale. No Man must be brave, nor Woman beautiful.
The Men are all painted with cropt Hair, and the Women
with Forehead-Cloaths, unless they assent and consent.
No Wit, no Language, no Honour, nor any Thing
that's good, is to be had any more than Matrimony without
a Licence.
Vide Grand Rebellion
, and Mr.
Echard
's

History of England
.

I am so very well entertain'd with
Dryden
's
Virgil
,
that I am glad to meet with any Excuse for his Translation;
and would allow Dr.
Felton
's, that
the Faults are to
be ascribed partly to some Defects of our Language
; if the
Doctor himself, a few Lines before, had not said of the
same Language,
that it is capable of all the Beauty,
Strength, and Significancy of the
Greek
and
Latin
. The
Faults which have been generally found with
Dryden
as
to
Virgil
, have been his mistaking or altering the Sense of
the Original, and turning the
Epick
Stile into
Elegiack
.
I doubt not but the
English
Tongue has Expression for
[Pg 65]

English
Sentiments, let them be ever so great and sublime;
but I may very well doubt whether it has Diction
equal to the Strength and Dignity of the
Ilias
, without
the Helps
Milton
made use of, as compounding of Words
and reviving some old Teutonicks, which would look very
uncouthly among the Softnesses and Gingles of our fine
Writers of late.

I wish the Doctor had explain'd how he would have
us to understand him, when he informs us, that to translate
well is more difficult than to write well; by which
he intimates, that to form a Fable for a great and important
Action, to mark the Characters with suitable Sentiments,
to conduct the One and maintain the Other with
Art and Elevation diversify'd with proper Episodes;
through such a Work as the
Ilias
, is so far from being
the principal Part of an
Epick
Poem that it is no Part
at all; for with all this the Translator has nothing to do.
The Labour and Merit of it, according to Dr.
Felton
,
consist in the Language and Verses, in finding Words to
express the Action and Sentiments, and to adorn those
Words with Numbers and Harmony. This is all that is
necessary in a Translation; and being also but some Parts
of the Original, it cannot be more difficult to do a Part
than to do the Whole. Can one suppose, that to write
such a History as Mr.
Echard
's from printed Books, written
Books, from the Hearsay and Report of Men, Women
and Children, is more difficult than to contrive and write
such a One as the
Cassandra
of
Calprenade
? or in plain

English
, that to invent and tell a Story, is much easier
than the bare telling it only? It needs no Reflection.
If the Version of
Homer
had been born when he wrote, he
must of Consequence have preferr'd it to the
Ilias
, which
would have cost the Translator's Modesty, as much as Sir

Richard Steele
's to be put upon a Comment on
Homer

and
Virgil
. My Lord
Roscommon
has explain'd this Matter
to us sufficiently:

Though Composition is the nobler Part,

Yet good Translation is no easy Art.

Monsieur
Maucroix
, who translated
Cicero
into
French
,
writes thus of translating to Monsieur
Boileau
:
You have
told me more than once, that Translation is not the Way to
Immortality
; and he excuses his meddling with it, on
[Pg 66]

Account of his Want of Application and Knowledge:
As to Immortality it is to be question'd, whether that
was the main Thing our Translators had in View. It
will not be deny'd, but that
Dryden
's Bookseller put him
upon translating
Virgil
, by the Temptation of so much a
Line. And other Undertakers pay well enough to make a
mortal Life a little comfortable, it is not much Matter
whether the Work be immortal or not.
Ogilby
however
is sure of Immortality; for though his Translations are
as dead as his Carcass, yet he will be remember'd in
good Satyr for the Badness of them.
My Author
, says
Monsieur
Maucroix
,
is learned for me, the Topicks are all
digested, the Inventing and Disposing are none of my Business;
I have nothing to do but to utter my self
. Which
Utterance is much more difficult, as Dr.
Felton
will have
it, than to study, to digest, to invent, to dispose, and to
utter too. I do not suppose, that a Man ever applied
himself to Translation, if he felt in himself any of the
heavenly Fire which animates a great Genius, or was ambitious
of Fame by the Merit of an Epick Poem. It
must be own'd, that Judgement is requisite in Translation
as well as Composition, not only to preserve the Spirit
of the Original, but also to make Choice of such a
One as the Translator may be best able to manage. Mr.

Charles Hopkins
was Master of this Secret; and instead
of attempting
Homer
or
Virgil
, he contented himself with

Ovid
, and succeeded to Admiration.
Hopkins
knew, that
the Manners and Sentiments in
Ovid
were natural and
universal, which must please in all Ages; whereas, but a very
few can relish the Quarrels and Battles, which are the
main Subject of the
Ilias
. The Learned have explained
to us, for what it is that our Adoration is due to
Homer
:
For the Unity and Greatness of his Fable, the Variety and
Dignity of his Characters, and his sublime Thought and
Expression; I dare not say Diction and Sentiments, because
the
Spectator
has disgraced the Use of technical
Terms, by calling it Cant; and supposing, that those
who use them, do it to disguise their Ignorance, and shew
their Vanity in critical Phrase.

I should be glad to know, which it is of all
Homer
's
before-mention'd Excellencies, that has so delighted the
Ladies, and the Gentlemen who judge like Ladies; or
whether ever a One of those Excellencies has been at all
[Pg 67]

distinguished from the Other; or whether there is any
Possibility of expressing the Sublime of the
Greek
Tongue
in our Language. As to the Sentiments, which are a principal
Part of Epick Poetry, they may be translated; we
very probably think much after the same Manner the

Greeks
did, though we do not speak so. The Passions
are the same in all humane Nature; and probably the
Expression of them, by so great a Master of our Tongue
as the Translator of
Homer
, may gain as much as it may
lose by the Translation. But the Mischief of it is, these
Sentiments are that Part of the
Ilias
which the Criticks
have made most bold with:

For who, without a Qualm, hath ever look'd

On holy Garbage, though by
Homer
cook'd?

Whose railing Heroes, and whose wounded gods,

Make some suspect he snores as well as nods.

But I offend————

Roscom.

Dormitat Homerus
; that
Homer
sometimes sleeps, was
said before by
Horace
. The
Spectator
informs us, that

Homer
is censured by the Criticks, for his Defect as to
the Sentiments in several Parts of the
Ilias
and
Odysses
.
However, it is most certain, that the Translation of
Homer

must have pleased Ladies and Gentlemen by these
very Sentiments, or by the Translator's beautiful Diction
and Versification. But then all the great Parts of Epick
Poetry are lost to them, especially those that depend on
the Dignity and Strength of Expression, which will not
be pretended to be entirely preserved in the
English
Version.

Reading
Dacier
a few Days since, I was extreamly surprised
at a Criticism of his on a Translation of
Homer
,
by a much greater Critick than himself, even
Horace
his
Master, who has thus translated the Beginning of the

Odyssey
:

Dic mihi, Musa, virum, captæ post tempora Trojæ,

Qui mores Hominum Multorum vidit & Urbes.

Muse, sing the Man, who after
Troy
was taken

The Manners of many Men and Cities saw.

[Pg 68]

I have aimed to be literal here, the better to explain

Dacier
's Remarks.
There are considerable Faults in this
Translation
, says Monsieur
Dacier
,
he has forgotten the
Epithet πολυτροπον, which marks
Ulysses
's Character; he
neglects the Circumstance that makes us most concern'd for
him, ὅς μαλα πλάγχθη, who wandered a long Time, he says
in a loose Way, after the Taking of
Troy
; whereas, it is
in
Homer
after having ruined
Troy
. Now, if
Horace
,
who had studied and admired
Homer
so much, as to make
him a Pattern for all future Writers of
Heroick
Poems,
could mistake three Times in translating two Lines, what
a Discouragement must it have been to those who knew
how he had succeeded in attempting it? 'Tis true, no
Poet will ever undertake a Translation with more Advantage
than the last Translator of
Homer
had; for besides
Eight or Ten Versions in
Latin
,
Italian
,
French
, &c.
there are Three or Four in
English
; a Prose Translation
by Madam
Dacier
, and a Cart-load of Comments in all
Languages. I am satisfy'd so good a Versifyer as the
Translator of the
Ilias
might with those Helps, have
made a very good Translation, without understanding any
more
Greek
than my self; and nothing in the World
could have been more easy, than out of one Commentator
to have corrected another, and to have alter'd and amended
the Reading in the Name of any of the Criticks,
from
Eustathius
down to
Dacier
. I do not boast of being
Master of
Greek
enough to read
Homer
with so much
Pleasure in the Original as I could do in a good Version,
and it is much to be question'd, whether every one that
can read him in the Original do understand what they
read: Several Ladies and Gentlemen have subscribed for

Chaucer
of the
Christ-Church
Edition, but I doubt very
much whether they understand him or not, and whether
a great many, who can read
Greek
, do really know what
they read. One of the greatest Masters of the
Greek
Tongue
, in our Time, has often question'd whether there
were Twenty Men in
England
who understood the
Strength, Beauty, and Elegance of that Language, tho'
there are a Thousand that pretend to it. He represented
it as a Study for a Man's Life, and I am confirm'd in
this Judgement by what
Menage
tells us of himself, and
others upon this Subject. 'Tis well known
Menage
wrote
several Things in
Greek
, particularly some Odes in Imi
[Pg 69]
tation
of
Anacreon
, which are not thought inferiour to the

Teian
Poet's;
J'ay toujours fait beaucoup de cas de ceux
qui savent le grec
, &c.
He always highly valued those that
understood
Greek
.
He does not mean to construe and
parse it as Boys do at School, which is the most of what
we find in those who pretend to be Masters of it.
Without
this Language
, continues he,
a Man can't be said to
be more than half Learned: Monsieur
Cotelier
, Monsieur
de
Treville
, and Monsieur
Bigot
, are the only Men in

France
, who can read the
Greek
Fathers in the Original.

I suppose the Fathers are not so difficult as
Homer
with
respect to the Tongue at least; for the Language of Poetry
is peculiar to it, a made Language compounded and
metaphorical. If it be so, the Translation of the
Ilias
,
from the
Greek
of
Homer
, must shew the Translator to
be a greater Master of the
Greek
Language than all the
Learned Men in
France
except Three, and all the Learned
Men in
England
except about Twenty. For my own
Part, I confess, I make bold with all Kinds of Versions
to help me out in Originals, and am not asham'd to do
as
Menage
did;
I own I do not understand
Pindar
enough
,
says he,
to take Pleasure in him
. I have heard
Pindar

quoted a Hundred Times by Persons who were very far
from being so modest as
Menage
, and fully satisfy'd
themselves that they understood him as well as the
Græcians
,
to whom he read his
Odes
, tho' I suspected the
contrary.
Menage
, again;
I never read a
Greek
Author
without having before read the Translation
.

I do not insinuate any thing to depreciate the Translator
of
Homer
's excellent Performance, which, as I have observ'd,
has the Merit of the most pure and harmonious
Diction and Versification; but to hint a little of the Confusion
of our Taste, and the Irregularity of our Judgement,
which like Things for Beauties which they have
not, and not for those which they have. Thus the Version
of
Homer
is lik'd as a Translation of the best
Epick

Poem that ever was written, and not for the Softness and
Sweetness of the Elegy, which are every where to be
met with, as where the God
Apollo
appears in the Shape
of
Agenor
:

Flies from the furious Chief in this Disguise,

The furious Chief still follows as he flies.

[Pg 70]

This is what the
French
call
Jeu des Mots
, playing
upon Words, and what
Dryden
's
Virgil
is full of, tho' he
knew as well as any Body that it was a Fault:
The Turn
of Thoughts, and Words
, says he,
is the chief Talent of
the
French
; but the
Epick
Poem is too stately to receive
such little Ornaments
, which would have been in Perfection
in a Version of
Ovid
, and very little agrees with

Waller
in his Epistle to my Lord
Roscommon
;

Well sounding Verses are the Charm we use,

Heroick Thoughts, and Virtue to infuse:

Things of deep Sense, we may in Prose unfold,

But they move more, in lofty Numbers told:

By the loud Trumpet, which our Courage aids,

We learn that Sound, as well as Sense, perswades.

In these Things our Taste is strangely confin'd: provided
the Verses run smoothly, and the Language is
soft and harmonious, we think it is fine: Let the Subject
be a
Boreas
, or a
Zephyr
: Nay, I do not question but the
Couplet I quoted out of the
English

Homer
is reckon'd one
of the finest of the Version by Ladies, and Gentleman who
judge like Ladies, and who are the Nine in Ten of all
Readers of Poetry. I confess, I am much more pleas'd
with the following Verses, as rough and rumbling as they
are, because they participate of the Roughness of the
Thing which is imag'd to us,

Jumping high o'er the Shrubs of the rough Ground,

Rattle the clattering Cars, and the shockt Axles bound.

When such assimilating the Sound to the Sense is not
affected 'tis very agreeable; but when there is any Force
or Affectation in it, 'tis puerile and distasteful.

The following Description of the Poetical Fire, which
several Poets were enflam'd with, seems to be somewhat
deficient, and to want farther Explanation; especially
where the Translator tells us,
Milton
's Fire
is like a
Furnace, but
Shakespear
's like a Fire from Heaven
:

Virgil
's like a
Kenning-Glass
, and
Lucan
's and
Statius
's
like
Lightning
. The
Kenning-Glass
should have
given me no Manner of Disturbance: But why is
Milton
's

Celestial Fire
compar'd to that which destroy'd the

Three Children
; the Fire of a Furnace is boisterous and
voracious, consuming whatever is within its Reach.
Mil
[Pg 71]
ton
's
Fire, like that of the Sun, warms and enlivens; and
if ever any was fetch'd from Heaven, 'twas that, which
shines with so much radiant Brightness throughout his
whole Poem. I was the more shockt with this Misrepresentation
of
Milton
's Fire, for that there's something
burlesque in the very Expression, a
Furnace
, and one
can't help being jealous that this Passage of
Hudibras

might give the Hint for it.

Talgol
, who had long possest

Enflamed Rage in glowing Breast,

Which now began to rage, and burn as

Implacably as Flame in Furnace.

Tho' I am very far from taking
Dryden
to be a perfect
Master of Criticism, yet I do not think his Deficiency
proceeded from Want of Judgement so much as from
Inconsistency and Vanity, and an Opinion that he was
Tyrant of
Parnassus
, and might govern by Will and
Pleasure instead of Law and Reason. I have observed
elsewhere that he adapts his Prefaces to the Circumstances
of every Play and Poem, and very often contradicts
in one what he had said in another: Nay, in his
Essay on
Dramatick Poetry
, the Contradiction is within a
few Lines of the Assertion, as thus;
There is no Theater
in the World has any Thing so absurd as the
English
Tragi-Comedy
, which he confirms by this Verse;

Atq; ursem & Pugiles media inter Carmina poscunt.

And a little after;
I cannot but conclude, to the Honour
of our Nation, that we have invented, encreased, and
perfected, a more pleasant Way of Writing than was ever
known to the Antients or Moderns of any Nation, which
is
Tragi-Comedy
. One of the most monstrous Inventions
,
says the
Spectator
,
that ever enter'd into the Poet's
Thought. An Author might as well think of weaving the
Adventures of
Æneas
and
Hudibras
into one Poem, as of
writing such a motley Piece of Mirth and Sorrow
. Whatever
others thought of Mr.
Dryden
's Criticisms, he did
himself full Justice, and seem'd to despise all other Criticks
at the same Time that he laid himself most open to
them.
These little Criticks do not well consider what the
Work of the Poet is, and what the Graces of a Poem;
the Story is the least Part of either.
Pref. to
Moch-Astrol.
[Pg 72]

Against him is every Critick, ancient and modern, from

Aristotle
to
Rimer
, and more than all of them against
him is his own self. In another Place he writes thus;

The Fable is without doubt the chief Part of a Tragedy,
because it contains the Action, and the Action contains the
Happiness or Misery, which is the End of Tragedy. Without
the Fable the Poet, who had otherwise good Manners,
Sentiments, and Diction, would no more have made a
regular Poem, than a Painter would have made a
good Picture that had mingled Blue, Yellow, Red, and
other Colours confusedly together.
I do not mention these
Things to lessen Mr.
Dryden
's great Character as a
Poet; but to shew how well Dr.
Felton
could judge of it,
when he recommended him to us as a Critick. Against
Mr.
Dryden
, as to the
Story
,
is Rapin
, who he assures
us would
be alone sufficient, were all other Criticks lost,
to teach a-new the Rules of Writing
. Against his
Rapin

we find the Translator of
Homer
in an extraordinary
Manner in his Notes on the Fifth
Iliad
. I hope it did
not arise from any Resentment for that Jesuit's reflecting
on those Poets who seem to place the Essence of Poetry
in fine Language, and smooth Verse, to which he ascribes
its present Decay.
As if the Art consisted only in Purity
and Exactness of Language: This indeed pleased well, and
was much to the Advantage of Women that had a Mind
to be tampering in Writing Verse: They found it their
Concern to give Vogue to this Kind of Writing, of which
they were as capable as the most Part of Men: For all
the Secret was no more than to make some little easy Verses,
in which they were content if they cou'd dress some soft
passionate Thoughts
, &c. The most of our modern
Poets being interested in this Affair, I shall say no more
of it.

I have hinted more than once, that such Poets, and
their Admirers, almost always mistake Affectation for
Beauty, and I wonder the Translator of
Homer
should
give them the least Countenance by his Example; for I
am very much deceiv'd if there is a more affected Period
in the
English
Tongue than what follows:
Nothing is
more lively
and Picturesque
than the
Attitude
of
Patroclus

is describ'd in; The
Pathetick
of his Speech is finely

contrasted
by the
Fierte
of
Achilles
.
Again,
There's
something inexpressibly
riant
in the
Compartments of
[Pg 73]

Achilles
's Shield
. In the
Spectator
, N
o
297. you read
thus:
The last Fault which I shall take notice of in
Stile, is the frequent Use of
technical
Words or Terms of
Art
. The bringing in more
French
Words to soften and
enervate our Stile is of very ill Consequence. The
Translator, besides
Riant
, has also
Traits
,
ensanguin'd
,
&c. I doubt, the Last is hardly a Word in any other
Language, and does not at all enrich our own.
Dryden
, in
an Epistle to the Earl of
Orrery
, has this Remark upon
it:
I wish we might at length leave to borrow Words of
another Nation, which is now a Wontonness in us, not a
Necessity: But so long as some affect to speak, there will
not be wanting others, who will have the Boldness to write
them
.

If I might make Use of the Word
Contrast
, nothing
can be more so than Affectation and Simplicity; and the
Translator seems, either not to have a just Notion of the
Latter, or to have a very ill Opinion of it: For without
distinguishing between Simplicity and Negligence, he affirms,

That Simplicity is a Word of Disguise for a shameful
unpoetical Neglect of Expression
, he makes no Exception
in this general Charge. And thus one of the
greatest Beauties of both Thought and Expression is rendered
one of the greatest Deformities. Father
Bouhours

asserts, that
Simplicity contributes the most of any Thing
to make a Stile perfect
; and again,
The Holy Scripture,
the Stile of which is, at the same Time, so
simple
and
so
sublime
.

Mr.
Addison
has treated of the noble Force of Simplicity
as it relates to Thought; and in the following Verses,
if I am not mistaken, the Simplicity of Expression as
well as Thought is noble:

So chear'd he his fair Spouse, and she was chear'd;

But silently a gentle Tear let fall

From either Eye, and wip'd them with her Hair.

Two other precious Drops, that ready stood

Each in their chrystal Sluice, he 'ere they fell

Kist, as the gracious Signs of sweet Remorse,

And pious Awe, that fear'd to have offended.

[Pg 74]

It is certain, Simplicity, as well as other Virtues in
Speech, has its Vice, and that is Meanness which falls
naturally into Burlesque, as this Line:

Then he will talk—good gods! How he will talk.

Which the
Spectator
speaks of as inexpressibly beautiful
for its Simplicity, though I think one can hardly repeat
it with a grave Tone; and when I have heard it
pronounced on the Stage in a burlesque Way, as it is in

The Plot and No Plot
; it has never fail'd of a hearty
Laugh and Clap.
Spectator
, N
o
39.
There is a Simplicity
in the Words, which out-shines the utmost Pride of
Expression
; and he attributes it to the Break,
good gods
!
He also informs us, that the Thought is at once
natural
,

soft
,
passionate
, and
simple
. It would have been well for
us, if the learned Critick had told us in what this Thought
is
simple
, in what
passionate
, in what
soft
, and in what

natural
, there being so few Words to express it; and I cannot
help thinking, that it is but one fond Rant of an
amorous Woman. True it is, Simplicity is not of it self
very wordy, but methinks the Break,
good gods!
has
more of the
Passionate
in it, than of the
Simple
or the

Soft
; and may be as well used in Anger as in Love, as well
in a Fright as in a Transport. It would have gone a good
Way in explaining the different Kinds of Thought, if the
judicious Author had distinguished them in this Line;
for there are not so many Kinds in one Verse in all Father

Bouhour
's
Maniere de bien penser
. I would not be
mistaken here, nor be charged with Ostentation, in setting
up my Judgement in Opposition to the
Spectator
's;
from whose Writings and Lessons, I have learned more
than from all other Authors. I only offer it as an Instance,
that the Best of our Criticks do not seem to have
gone to the Bottom of this Subject. It never enter'd into
the Heads of Writers and Readers in General, that
Thought was any Thing but Thought, or Stile any Thing
but Stile, or that there were any other Terms or Distinctions
for them, but the Good and the Bad, as is already
hinted; nor were they at all sensible of my Lord
Roscommon
's
Meaning in these Verses:

Whose incoherent Stile, like sick Men's Dreams,

Varies all Shapes, and mixes all Extreams.

[Pg 75]
The
same may be said of Thought.

I want very much to be informed, whether there is a
perfect Agreement of Thought in these several Quotations
out of
Homer
, or how they must be understood so
as not to contradict one another. The first Couplet is
against
Wine
:

Inflaming Wine, pernicious to Mankind,

Unnerves the Limbs, and dulls the noble Mind.

The next Couplet is for Wine:

With
Thracian
Wines recruit thy honour'd Guests,

For happy Counsels flow from sober Feasts.

What follows taken out of the
Notes
upon
Homer
is
against Wine.
What
Hector
says against Wine in the two
first Verses has a great Deal of Truth in it: It is a vulgar
Mistake to imagine the Use of Wine, either raises the Spirits
or encreases Strength.

The next Words are for Wine:

Then with a plenteous Draught refresh his Soul,

And draw new Spirits from the generous Bowl.

Again for Wine:

For Strength consists in Spirits and in Blood,

And those are ow'd to generous Wine and Food.

And the Translator's Observation, that the moderate
Use of Wine does not raise the Spirits, is not the truer,
because it is said by
Hector
, the Son of
Priam
. Father

Sirmond
, a sober reverend as well as learned Priest says
quite another Thing:

Si bene commemini causæ sint quinque bibendi,

Hospitis Adventus, præsens Sitis, atque futura,

Et Vini bonitas, & quælibet altera Causa.

If all be true,
&c.

Whoever reads an Author with Exactness cannot fail
of meeting with several Passages, where Self-love, Humour,
Party, or Complexion, are uppermost. Thus a
good Catholick will never have a good Word for a Heretick,
nor a
Puritan
for a
Papist
. Dr.
Ch——
will never
speak well of Punch, nor Dr.
Mand——
of Watergruel.
[Pg 76]

He who writes well is jealous of him who judges well, and
he who judges well envies him who writes well. The
Swifts

turn every Thing into Grimace, the
Whistons
into Mathematicks,
and whatever touches an Author's own Taste,
he is always recommending to his Reader.

We all remember how the Duke of
Malborough
was
treated by the blessed Peace-makers for beating their
Friends the
French
.
Delight in War
was a Mark set
upon him in a most solemn Manner, and a memorable
Instance of our Wisdom and Gratitude. There is a Paraphrase
upon it in the Version of
Homer
; and when the
Application is made will turn the
Epick
into Satyr.

Curs'd is the Man, and void of Law and Right,

Unworthy Property, unworthy Light;

Unfit for publick Rule or private Care,

That Wretch, that Monster who delights in War;

Whose Lust is Murder, and whose horrid Joy

To tear his Country,
&c.

To
tear
a Country is very much in Heroicks. The
Image of
Discord
has good Lines in it; but methinks
they would not have been the Worse, if they had been
heated a little in
Milton
's Furnace:

Discord, dire Sister of the slaughtering Pow'r,

Small at her Birth,
but rising ev'ry Hour
;

While scarce the Skies her horrid Head can bound,

She stalks on Earth, and
shapes
the World around:

The Nations bleed, where e'er her Steps she turns,

The Groan still deepens, and the Combat burns.

I refer to the Judgement of the Reader, whether the
following Image of Discord taken from a modern burlesque
Poem, has not more of the Epick in it:

Non tulit invisæ speciem Discordia Pacis,

Ilicet horrentes ad fibila concitat hydros,

Ulcisci jubet Ira nefas. Spumantia felle

Ora tument, micat ex oculis ardentibus Ignis.

Discord enrag'd at the Approach of Peace

Made her Snakes hiss, and urg'd to dire Revenge.

Her foaming Mouth of horrid Poison full,

From her red Eyes she darted Flakes of Fire.

[Pg 77]
The
new invented Words made use of by the Translator
of
Homer
are well enough chosen, and well warranted
by the Practice of the greatest Poets, such as
Moveless
,

Instarr'd
,
Inurn'd
,
Conglobe
,
Deathful
,
Fountful
,
Lengthful
:

But if you write of Things abstruse and new,

Words of your own inventing may be us'd.

Roscom
.

I have mention'd some of the Helps which were prepared
for the Translator of the
Ilias
. But Dr.
Felton
informs
us, Dr.
Busby
would not allow of Notes; a very
curious Remark That. It is not impossible, but Dr.

Busby
himself might have read and taught
Homer
50
Years as a
Grammarian
, without understanding him as
a Poet. A Portion of that Genius which inspir'd the
Author is requisite for the Reader to see all the Beauties
that are in a Poem. I believe the Lord
Roscommon
's
Judgement will be preferred to that of both those Doctors:

Search every Comment that your Care can find,

Some here, some there, may hit the Poet's Mind.

If the Translator of
Homer
search'd every Comment,
his Labour was more than
Herculean
. I own my self
extreamly edify'd by what he says of Antiquaries; applying
a Saying of my Lord
Bacon
's to them:
In General they
write for Ostentation not for Instruction, and their Works
are perpetual Repetitions.
The Reason is plain, they
have no Fund of their own, they must therefore borrow
from those that have. It is necessary there should be
such Men, but the Dryness and Barrenness of their Studies
are inconsistent with a lively Fancy and a good Taste;
and I know not which of the Antiquaries deserve most to
be rever'd by us, those that would restore lost Words,
Letters, and Points, or those that would recover lost Fable
or History. To know exactly where
Brute
built his
Palace
Royal
, where
Bladud
set up his
Laboratory
would be
something; as also to prove, that
Cassibelan
liv'd where
my Lord
Essex
now does at
Cashiobury
; or that
Constantine
the Great
was a
Yorkshire
Man; which Things have
been attempted, would be as much to the Glory of the
Students in Antiquity, as to find out a lost
Comma
, or re
[Pg 78]
store
a Letter to a Word that was robb'd of it 1500
Years ago. But as for our Monkish Antiquaries, and the
Monastick Learning, it seems to be reserv'd for the Improvement
of those, whose Minds, like barren Soils, will
never bear without dunging. They are always turning
up the Ruins of old Convents, and hope like the Cock
to find a Jewel in the Dunghill. They dig for holy
Water-Pots and Crucifixes, as greedily as the modern
Romans

dig for Medals, Images, and Urns. To know whether
such an Abbey was founded in the Papacy of Pope

Joan
or Pope
Boniface
, in what Dormitory such a Monk
slept, and in what Penitentiary such a Nun was disciplined,
must needs be very edifying. But most of all the
Deciding of historical Debates by old Charters, which,
with a little curious Examination, will be found to be
forged ones. Many of this Kind are printed by
Dugdale
,
as I shall have Occasion to remark elsewhere. If these
Antiquaries could fix the same Authority on
Monkish

Writings, as we are told of
Homer
's, that the Claims of
two Cities to certain Limits, were determined by what
he said of them in his
Ilias
, it would be worth every
one's while to read the Monks instead of the Classicks;
And I doubt not Dr.
Felton
would have succeeded better
if he had given us Instruction in the Monkish Learning,
than he has done in the
Classical
. But since their Writings
prove nothing but their Ignorance and Superstition,
I believe Men of Taste and Genius will be so generous as
to leave such hidden Treasures to enrich those, whose
Invention and Judgement lie under the Calamity of the
most extream Poverty. There is nothing but Labour
and Patience requisite to acquire a Mastery in these Studies,
whether the Matter collected be good or bad, 'tis
the same Thing if it be Old, if it be
Teutonick
or
Runick
,

Danish
or
Saxon
, that's sufficient. A Man who has
any Warmth in his Imagination, and any Delicacy in his
Taste, cannot be always raking in the Rubbish of barbarous
Ages, and groping in
Gothick
Darkness. A good
Proof of the small Talent necessary for this Work is, that
there hardly ever was an Author among these Monkish
Antiquaries, but his Language was as barbarous as his
Subject. Such Sort of Scholarship is, I own, very serviceable
to those that know how to make a good Use of
others Labours; but the Merit of the Scholar consists ra
[Pg 79]
ther
in the Goodness of his Eyes, and the Strength of his
Head, than in the Fineness of his Genius, or the Regularity
of his Judgement. I am apt to think the Translator
of
Homer
had not the Admirers of these Antiquities
in his Thoughts, but refer'd to the Criticks and Commentators
on the
Greek
and
Roman
Authors: For he
says, in another Place,
To talk of the Genius of an Ancient,
as
Macrobius
did, is at once the cheapest Way of
shewing our own Taste, and the shortest Way of criticising
the Wit of others
. This must be only meant of those
whom Mr.
Dryden
calls
Dutch
Commentators, of those
that do by the Classicks, as Correctors of the Press do
by their Copies, and instead of applying themselves to
the Sense stick close to the Letters, and look out for

Dele's
and
Addenda's
. This they call correcting and restoring
the Text; and it is much to be fear'd, that by
this restoring and correcting of the Commentators, and
the Mistakes, Blunders and Negligences of the Copiers,
we have few or no Books of the Antients in their original
Purity and Perfection. However, there is Perfection enough
left in the Classical Writings to prove, That what the
Translator of
Homer
says, does not relate to the Classicks
themselves, but to those that make an ill Use of them,
and under their Name and Authority insult the Moderns.
The Lord
Bacon
says somewhere, that what we call the
Antiquity was the Youth of the World, and that we are
properly the Antients as the Inhabitants of an older World,
and having made infinite Improvements in all the most
useful Parts of Learning.

I dare not say, there is a Quibble in the Expression of
so illustrious a Writer, but I must always take the Authors
that wrote 1500 or 2000 Years ago to be the Antients;
and one may very well Question, whether there
was not as much useful Learning lost in twelve or thirteen
Centuries of Barbarism and Ignorance, as has been discover'd,
or rather recovered in two or three of the last Ages.

The Antiquaries the Translator speaks of would do
Wonders, if they would make it out that the Letter sent
to the King of
Edessa
, and the Passage in
Josephus
's
Book XVIII, relating to our Saviour, are genuine, with
several other Particularities, which are much insisted
upon by Ecclesiastical Writers. The
Spectator
has told
us something too of Antiquity, which wants the Confir
[Pg 80]
mation
of the Antiquaries, and that is a Quotation out of
a Manuscript in the
Vatican
Library, where
Longinus
is
made to say,
Paul
of
Tarsus
, the Patron of an Opinion
not fully proved, must be reckon'd among the best
Græcian

Orators
. This must be a downright Forgery:
Longinus

surely knew the
Greek
Tongue too well, to cry up
the Eloquence of a Writer in it, who, as St.
Jerome
says,
did not understand
Grammar
, and mentions the Places
where he err'd,
Propter Imperitiam Artis Grammaticæ
.
See
Gregory
on the
Septuagint
. It were to be wished, that
the Ecclesiastical Writers, even of the earliest Centuries,
had suffer'd nothing to escape them that was improbable,
if not incredible. 'Tis also much wanted to have further
Proof of the Ceasing of Oracles at the Nativity of
our Saviour, and that
Virgil
prophesy'd of it in his fourth
Eclogue. We should be still more oblig'd to them, if
they would prove, that the
Sibyl
's Verses are a Prophecy
of the same Thing, which Things are generally asserted
in the Writings of the Ecclesiasticks. As to Oracles
Lucian

tells us, Answers were given in his Time, that of the
Emperor
Commodus
160 Years after,
Juvenal
makes their
Ceasing to be only 100 Years after:

————
Delphis Oracula cessant.

Theodoret
writes, that
Julian
the Apostate received
an Answer from
Apollo
at
Delphos
, 300 Years after the
Birth of our Saviour. All which may be seen in Bishop

Potter
's
Greek
Antiquities, a most excellent Book; and
if we had more such Antiquaries as that learned Prelate's
and Mr.
Basil Kennet
's who wrote the Antiquities of
Rome
,
we might at the same Time improve ourselves both in antient
and polite Learning. These being, I think the two most
valuable Pieces of the Kind in any Language. As the middle
Way is safest in all Things, so as to the Antients to run
them down as
Perrault
has done, or cry them up as
Boileau

is perhaps equally dangerous, and out of the Medium.
Whatever Advantages we have had of the Antients, probably
they had the same of those that preceeded them. This we
know, that the
Latins
borrow'd as much from the
Greeks

as we have borrow'd from them; and it would be no difficult
Matter to prove, that in all the Branches of polite Literature,
the Moderns, particularly the
English
, have excell'd
the Antients in as many as the Antients excelled them.

[Pg 81]
The
Passage of my Lord
Bacon
's before cited, gave
Occasion to Monsieur
Perrault
, to bring in that noble Author
for an Evidence on his Side against the Antients:
But
Boileau
vindicates him in this Point; and Father
Bouhours
,
as another Instance of his excellent Judgement,
declares he prefers the Lord Chancellor
Bacon
before the
most celebrated Names of Antiquity.
Rapin
calls him
the greatest
Genius of England
, and he has not more
Glory from his own Countrymen than from the learned
Men in
France
.

I expect no Quarter from the Dealers in monastick
Learning, in Heraldry, and Genealogy, who generally
doat upon them even to Frenzy.
Du Val
in his Geography
informs us, that there is a Nation in
America
, bordering
on the River of the
Amazons
, where old Women
go off better than young; under a Notion, that the
Knowledge of the One is preferable to the Vigour and
Beauty of the Other. Thus these Men please themselves
more with the Dryness and Gravity of Antiquity, than
with a beautiful Imagination, and the Charms of Eloquence.
I believe their Opinion will not have many Followers,
nor their Example be much imitated. However,
when such an Antiquary as the great
Selden
appears in
the World, the Instruction it will receive from him, more
than makes amends for the Labour and Time which others
lose in hunting after worthless Manuscripts, forg'd
Charters, and monkish Fables. The learned and polite
Dr.
Bathurst
of
Oxford
, wrote an admirable Poem on the
Death of
Selden
:

So fell the sacred
Sibyl
, when of Old

Inspir'd with mere than mortal Breast could hold:

The gazing Multitude stood doubtful by,

Whether to call it Death or Extasy:

She silent lies, and now the Nations find

No Oracles, but i' th' Leaves she left behind.

Selden etant sans Contredit le plus docte des Anglois
moderns.
'Tis said by a
Frenchman
and a
Papist
; but as
much as
Selden
was an Oracle, and a Glory to our Country,
Archbishop
Laud
his Brethren would have thrust
his learned Head into a Pillory, if they could have come
at him. I don't know whether it was for his History of

Tythes
or not; but that would have been hard after he
[Pg 82]

had been so fully answer'd by Doctors of both Universities;
who, however, were not,
Les plus Doctes des Anglois
moderns
. Judicious Antiquaries ever were, and ever will
be in Esteem. Those that meddle with Things solid and
useful. None of the Pretenders to this Sort of Knowledge,
are more despicable than such as deal in old
Terms and Phrases, who generally affect a Contempt for
those that are in present Use as weak and effeminate.
The Emperor
Augustus
could not bear these Men, any
more than
Punster
's whom he heartily despis'd. The
Spectator, N
o
470. has with much Pleasantry animadverted
on those Criticks in Readings, and has brought in
the
Cotton Library
,
Aldus
,
Scaliger
,
Scioppius
,
Salmasius
,
the elder
Stephens
, and a Heap of old Manuscripts,
to clear up the Difficulties in certain Lyrick Verses, about

a Shape, an Eye, Wit, Charms,
Corinna
and
Belvedera
.

As scrupulous and as curious as these
Antiquaries

would be thought to be, one might fill Volumes with
Examples of the most notorious Mistakes and Blunders
in the Writings of the most learned among them; which
are not taken notice of to lessen the Credit they have worthily
acquir'd, but to shew the Infirmity of humane Nature,
which will always be attended with Errours, and never
arrive at Perfection as we have elsewhere observ'd after

Horace
:

————Non ego Paucis,
&c.

But in such Authors, what is good more than atones
for what is not so, and 'tis only where a Writer shews a
Defect in Will as well as Judgement, that he renders
himself blame-worthy, especially in History. Several of
these Blunders are collected by
Marville
in his
Melange
,
&c. 'Tis remark'd of
Pliny
, that in translating
Democritus
,
he says, the Camelion is like a Crocodile, and altogether
as big—The
Crocodalos
of
Democritus
is in the

Jonick
Dialect, a
Lizard
, which may be about some ten
thousand Times less than a Crocodile, and yet a great
many Times bigger than a
Camelion
.
Eutychius
speaking
of
Eusebius
of
Cesarea
, sirnamed
Pamphilus
, calls
him
Eusebius
, Bishop of the City of
Phili
.
Quintus
Curtius
mistakes
Arabia Fælix
for
Arabia Deserta
. He
confounds the
Euxine
with the
Caspian
Sea, and makes
[Pg 83]

the Rivers
Tygris
and
Euphrates
run through
Media
,
which they never enter'd. Mr.
Simon
, in his critical History,
takes
Suna
and
Fratela
, two Officers of the
Gothick
Army,
for two
German
Ladies. The Life of
Charlemagne
,
written by
Acciaioli
, having been often joyn'd with
Plutarch
's
Lives, was published by
Vicellius
as written by

Plutarch
, who liv'd 6 or 700 Years before
Charlemagne
.

Gerard Vossius
affirms, that the Society of the
Sorbonne

was instituted by
Robert
, Brother of
S. Lewis
King of

France
, instead of
Robert
sirnamed
Sorbonne
from the
Place of his Nativity.
Pallavicini
in his History of the
Council of
Trent
, says
Lansac
, the
French
Ambassador,
was Knight of the Order of the Holy Ghost, which was
not instituted till twenty Years after; but what has particular
Relation to us
Englishmen
is the Charge against
Dodwel
:

Dodowel dans ses Dissertations sur Saint Cyprien prend
la Ville d'Olympe pour une Olympiade,
takes the City

Olympus
for an
Olympiade
, the Name of the Place
where, for the Date of the Year when it was done, which
is Matter of much Humiliation to all such as believe it
impossible for so learned and orthodox a Man to commit so
great an Oversight; and plainly proves to us, that those who
write of what past 1000 or 2000 Years ago, are as likely
to err, as those who write of what past three or fourscore
Years ago. Whoever has a Curiosity to see more of the

Blunderings
, which the most learned are charg'd with,
such as the
Port Royal
,
Baronius
,
Vasquez
,
Du Cange
,

Varillas
,
L'Abbé
, &c. may have full Satisfaction in
Marville
's

Melange
,
p. 208. & seq.
taken from a Book written
by
Boileau
's Uncle, entituled,
Colloquium Criticum de
Sphalmætis viromum in re literaria illustrium
. Of what
Size would the Book be, if we should examine with the
same Exactness,
Nalson
,
Heylin
,
Wharton
,
Collier
,

Dugdale
,
Brady
, the
Grand Rebellion
, the
Histories
,

&c.
And collect and publish the Errours, both of
the Will and the Judgement. Nor are these Names by
any Means more illustrious, than those we meet with in
the
Colloquium
.

The Translator of
Homer
has an Excuse for Mr.
Dryden
,
which is much more generous than just: He says,

His Haste in Writing ought not to be imputed to him as
a Fault, but to those who suffer'd so noble a Genius to lie
under the Necessity of it.
Mr.
Dryden
's Genius did not
[Pg 84]

appear in any Thing more than his
Versification
; and
whether the Criticks will have it ennobled for that
Versification

only, is a Question. The Translator seems to
make a good
Genius
and a good Ear to be the same
Thing.
Dryden
himself was more sensible of the Difference
between them, and when it was in Debate at
Will
's
Coffee-house, what Character he would have with Posterity;
he said, with a sullen Modesty,
I believe they will
allow me to be a good Versifier
. If we will believe Mr.

Dryden
, he did not lie under the Necessity of Haste: In
several of his Dedications and Prefaces, he has declared,
He never wanted. When he renounced his Allegiance to
King
William
, and disqualified himself for keeping the
Laureat's Place with that of Historiographer, he had
a Pension from the then Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of

Dorset
, which was an Instance of Generosity that is rarely
to be met with in the History of
Lewis
XIV, who
paid more to Poets and Historians than all the Princes of

Europe
. His Bounty has been extoll'd, even by those
whom his Bigotry had banish'd, yet he seldom let it extend
to any of the Reformed Religion, let their Merit
be ever so great. Mademoiselle
le Fevre
, afterwards Madam

Dacier
, dedicated a Book to that Prince, and the
Duke
de Montausier
introduc'd her at Court; but the King
would not accept of the Book, nor admit that his Name
should be put before the Epistle.

The Duke, whose Character had some Bluntness in it,
said,
Sir, Is this the Way to encourage Learning: The
Lady deserves well of your Majesty and the Publick, and
if you will not reward her your self, suffer me to give her
100 Pistoles, I matter not whether I am paid again
: or
Words to that Effect. This Learned Lady was far from
being an Enemy to the Government as
Dryden
was, and
he did not stick to shew it upon all Occasions, even when
he was pension'd by my Lord Chamberlain. The Truth
is, he was like fond Fathers who can see no Faults in
their Children; and as to his hasty Writing, 'tis pretty
well known that as easy as his Verses appear to be, he
came hard by them: He thought it a good Day's Work
if he could finish 40 Verses a Day; and some learned

Antiquaries
, I suppose from a
MSS.
of
Virgil
's Amanuensis,
assure us, that
Maro
wrote as many, and drawing
them off the
Lee
afterwards, in his Poetical Limbeck,
[Pg 85]

reduced them to Ten.
Godeau
, Bishop of
Vence
, us'd
to write 2 or 300 Verses a-day. I my self paid a Visit
once to a Verse-maker in an Afternoon, and saw 200
political Verses on his Table, which he told me he had
written since Dinner: By this Dispatch he soon furnish'd
out a
Folio
.
Dryden
was so far from spying Blemishes
in his Works, that he often took them for Beauties,
and particularly what the
Italians
call
Concetti
.
This noted Rant in the
Conq. Gran.

I, alone am King of Me.

is happily imitated by him in his
State of Innocence
:

I my self am proud of Me.

But to criticise on
Dryden
's Prefaces and Plays is a much
greater Labour than to copy them all over, and equally
ungenerous and impertinent: If any one will compare
his
Fall of Man
with
Milton
's Paradise lost, he will
quickly perceive to which of them it is that the
noble
Genius
is to be apply'd; and if it belongs to
Milton
, some
other Epithet should be thought of for
Dryden
.

I have already observ'd, that I did not intend to form
a regular Discourse, and I think I have kept pretty well
to my Intention: If the Reader misses any Thing of
Instruction by it, he will find it made up in Entertainment.
The Variety will excuse the Want of Method in
a Subject not so capable of it as where the Matter is
certain and well known. I wish I were able to give Examples
of all Father
Bouhour
's several Kinds of
Thoughts out of
English
Authors, but Examples are
much nicer Work than Precepts. Every one may agree
that a Thing ought to be so done, but saw that it is so
done. Men's Idea's of the same Things, vary in the Reflection
as much as their Views do in Prospect, according
to the Light they appear in. Dr.
Felton
makes a Trifle
of it in one Part of his Preface, and an insuperable Difficulty
in another.
I might, at once, with the Trouble only
of Transcribing, have adorn'd the Work, and diverted the
Reader.
Contrary to this, he says,
If any Body is pleas'd
to try, he will hardly find it practicable to illustrate these
Rules by Examples.
The Quotations, which he had be
[Pg 86]
fore
term'd transcribing only, are not so easy as he imagin'd
to be done with Beauty and Judgement, was
he sure of writing out nothing but what was as much
to the Purpose as if it had been made for it, otherwise
he might have transcrib'd puffy Thoughts for sublime,
trifling Thoughts for pretty, affected Thoughts for
agreeable; in short, false Thoughts for fine ones, and I
am afraid that would have been his Misfortune, had he
attempted it. In his Preface he blames
Tully
for quoting
himself, and
Aristotle
for being dry; but as he has
not gone much beyond the Latter in his Criticisms, nor
the Former in his Eloquence, so I believe their Reputation
will not be much the worse for him, and it had been
better if the Doctor had follow'd the Direction of
Quintillian
,

Modesto tamen & Circumspecto judicio
, &c. People
should speak with a great deal of Modesty and Circumspection
of such great Men, for it may happen, as it
very often does, that they condemn what they do not understand.

I am apprehensive enough that this Undertaking will
be censur'd as an Effect of Vanity and Arrogance, and I
am well enough acquainted with the Spirit of the People
I have to deal with,

Genus irritabile Vatum.

But I please my self with the Reflection, that I have
not mingled the least Spice of Malice in the Composition,
as it relates to Criticism, and am so far from being vain
and arrogant, that I frequently and sincerely declare, my
chief Design was to excite some more capable Writer to do
what I knew my self uncapable of; and if any such Person
shall, by exposing my Errours, give the World a true
Light, I will not only gratefully follow it, but rejoyce at
it, and take hold or the Opportunity to have my Share
of the Instruction, if it comes from clean Hands, and is
not defil'd with ill Manners and ill Language: Such tutoring
I shall despise, and it being very common for Authors
to have as good an Opinion of themselves as of any
Body else, I shall not think any Name of Authority
enough to justify either Insolence or Scurrility. About
40 Years ago there was a Student at
Oxford
, who acquir'd
a good Hand at a Fiddle; but, falling afterwards
into Melancholy, he grew averse to Musick, and could
[Pg 87]

not be prevail'd upon by his Friends to touch it: They
had but one Way to excite him to it, and that was for
some unskilful Hand to take his Violin and scrape upon it;
he would then immediately snatch it away from him,
and, in a Kind of Resentment, give it the utmost Elegance
of Sound and Harmony. I freely own I had this
Man's Example in my Head when I began this Essay,
and should the Success be the same, the End of it is
answer'd.

I cannot close this Essay without taking Notice of the
Perverseness of Men, who pretend to Wit and Judgement,
towards one another: It appears mostly in Pretenders,
and is very well markt by
Boileau
, in these two
Verses translated by Mr.
Dennis
, and equal to the
Original:

Thus one Fool lolls his Tongue out at another,

And shakes his empty Noddle at his Brother.

It was not so when Judgement and Wit were something
more than Pretence only, when they were in the Heighth
of Excellence, under the Patronage of
Augustus
. My
Lord
Roscommon
, in his Preface to
Horace
's Art of Poetry
writes thus:
I am below the Envy of the Criticks, but
if I durst, I would beg them to remember, that
Horace

ow'd his Favour and his Fortune to the Character given
of him by
Virgil
and
Varius
; that
Fundanius
and
Pollio

are still valued by what
Horace
say of them, and that in
that Golden Age there was a good Understanding among
the Ingenious; and those who were the most esteem'd were
the best natur'd.

Dryden
has made the same Observation:

Certainly, the Poets of
Ovid
's Age enjoy'd much
Happiness in the Conversation and Friendship of one another.

The antient Criticks
, says the
Spectator
,
are full
of the Praises of their Contemporaries. They discover
Beauties which escap'd the Observation of the Vulgar,
and very often find out Reasons for palliating and excusing
such Slips and Oversights, as were committed in the Writings
of eminent Authors.
Mr.
Addison
has imitated them
in his Remarks upon
Milton
's
Paradice Lost
; but it must
be allowed that the Task was made very easy, and the
Beauties shine so brightly, that there's no taking one's Eye
off of them. It has also been wish'd, that the two or three
Slips in Expression which he quotes out of
Milton
had
[Pg 88]

been excused, as they might have been by observing,
that if there's a Pun in the
Paradice Lost
, 'tis the Devil
that makes it.

One of the surest Signs, that the Wits of the past and
present Age,
English
and
French
, are not of the Size of
those of the Age of
Augustus
, is their Jealousies and Broils.
The
Spectator
has this Remark, N
o
409;
I cannot think,
that
Corneille
,
Racine
,
Moliere
,
Boileau
,
La Fontaine
,

Bruyere
,
Bossu
, or the
Dacier
's, would have written so
well as they did, had they not been Friends and Contemporaries.

'Tis said very much in Favour of good Nature,
and therefore is very agreeable: But I Question, whether
Emulation, and sometimes even Resentment, may not produce
very good Effects in the Works of the Ingenious.

Facit Indignatio versus.

Godeau

,
Malherbe

were Men of great Merit; and so were also,
Maynard
,

La Mothe Le Vayer
, and
Costar
; yet they wrote against one
another with some Acrimony.

'Tis Envy and Spleen, that produce a Set of Writers
in
England
, call'd
Answerers
, whose Modesty may be
conceived by some of their Titles,
The best Answer that
ever was.
Part 1st.
The best Answer that ever was.

Part the 2d.
A better Answer
than the
best Answer
. The

Unanswerable Answer
, by
Lesley
and others. You can't
publish a
Pamphlet
or
Essay
, but it is immediately snapt
at to be answer'd: Nay, Dr.
Halley
's Calculation of the
Eclipse in a Half-sheet had two or three
political
Answers.

The Itch of Answering is so great, that some Authors
have taken it in Dudgeon, not to have been thought
worthy of an Answer; and to prevent such Disgrace a
second Time, have written on Purpose that they might
answer themselves. I have heard, that the learned and
ingenious
Robinson Crusoe
is in the Number of these.

How can it be expected, that Men of Passions, worldly
Minds, and Lay-men should escape this Infection, when
the Fathers themselves in the first Ages of the
Church
,
could not help writing against one another, with as much
Sharpness as any modern Writers. St.
Jerom
, in Particular,
is charg'd with this Weakness, in his Writings against
Lactantius
,
St.
Ambrose
, St.
Hilary
,
Didymus
. 'Tis said,
that
he spar'd neither Antients nor Moderns
; no not
the inspir'd Elders that translated the Septuagint: Himself
having translated the Bible into
Latin
, and he
[Pg 89]

seem'd to be as fond of his Works as are other Translators.

Our Neighbours, the
French
, have not been altogether
free from this Humour of
Answering
, or rather writing
against one another; as will appear by the following List
of a dozen Authors of a Side; most of them of the

French
Academy; and I might name as many more of
equal Rank:

Balzac
,

Written against
by

Pere Goulu
,
Theophile

As the most delicate Praise is that which has the

Face
of Satyr, so the most delicate Satyr is that which
has the Face of Praise. Of the latter Kind are the
Verses to the honourable
Edward Howard
on his
incomparable

and
incomprehensible
Play. Those Verses were
written by the Duke of
Buckingham
, the Lord
Dorset
,
Mr.
Waller
, and others. Of the former Kind are several
of
Voiture
's Letters to the Prince of
Conde
, and
Boileau
's
to the Duke
de Vivonne
in Imitation of them. Indeed
we must allow, that the
French
do understand the

Belle Raillerie
better than we do, at least for the Generality,
there being some Authors in
English
, that have
succeeded in fine Raillery as well as the
French
. Thus
did Archbishop
Tillotson
treat
Sergeant
the
Popish
Priest:
Thus Bishop
Sprat
handled
Sorbiere
; and Dr.
Burnet
of
the Charter-house treated one
Warren
who had attack'd
his
Theory
. If our Answerers could write as they did,
they would both divert and instruct us. But we have already
explained what they mean by Raillery. They
know not how to parry like good Fencers, and therefore
knock down like Cudgel Players.

[Pg 90]
The
last Word puts me in Mind of a lower Order of
Criticks, which are rarely heard of within the Sound of

Bow-Bell
; and these are your
Etymologists
and your
Orthographists
,
who turn to
Rider
or
Holy Oak
for the Derivation
of Words, and have the learned
Garretson
and
other Helps for Spelling: But I know not whether this
Essay may travel far enough into the Country to be of any
Use; and besides, I have not converst enough with
those Criticks that deal in Words and Letters only, to be
Master of the Subject, which is generally learn'd by such
as make a Penny of it in Conversation by laying Wagers,
the Power and Test of all rural Argument.

I must own the
Etymologists
are by much the greater
Men of the Two than the
Orthographists
. I do affirm
this, not only because it is necessary to know the Roots of
Languages, but because it is a greater Mark of Scholarship,
and has the Sanction of the most learned Universities.
The profoundest of our own Antiquaries have, in
Favour of the University of
Oxford
, found out an Etymology,
that may match with the famous One of
Diaper
Napkin
: From whence comes King
Pepin
. Bishop
Stillingfleet

informs us, that the Champions for the Antiquity
of
Oxford
say, that the old Name is
British
, and it is
read somewhere
Iren
which should be read
Icen
, and that
again
Ychen
, and that
Rydychen
, and
Rydychen
in the

British
Tongue is
Vadum Boum
in
Latin
, and that in

English
,
Oxenford
,
Oxford
, and
Oxon.
Such wonderful
Discoveries are made by the venerable Antiquaries.
Iren

runs the Gauntlet through three Languages
Irish
,
Welsh
,
and
Latin
, before it drops into
English
, but considering
there is more
Greek
in the
Welsh
Tongue than there is

Latin
, it may make Work for great Scholars, to shew
their Scholarship in settling the Matter as it should be
with a Salvo for the Rights of the University of
Cambridge
.

The Learned in
France
have an Etymology almost as
good as that of
Oxford
from
Iren
, which is the Word

Cemetiere
a Church-yard; They derive it from the
Latin

Word
cum
with, and
mittere
to put, as much as to
say the dead Bodies are put together in one burying
Place. Thus the Boxes at the
Opera
are a
Cemetiere
or
Church-yard, because the Ladies and Gentlemen are
put with one another there, and thus by Virtue of the
[Pg 91]

same Etymology, the Place where People are born and
where they are bury'd are all one, from
Cum
with, and

Mittere
to put, as I have heard, that the same Word
serves for Life and Death in one of the oriental Languages.

As to
Orthography
, the only Passage I have read in a
polite Author concerning it is that of
Boileau
, who taxes

Perrault
with false Spelling, by putting an
s
in one Word,
and leaving out an
s
in another. By putting an
s
into
the Word
Contemples
, it lost the Imperative Mood which
is
Contemple
; and by leaving out an
s
in the Word
Casuiste
,
written
Casuite
, it became no Word at all. When Moods
and Tenses, Numbers and Cases, Substantives and Adjectives,
suffer by
Orthography
, the curious Country-man
has reason to cry out, otherwise the Printer may
be answerable for the Spelling.

After all that has been said of the
Sublime, &c.
perhaps
the Criticks do make more of Things than is necessary,
or in Nature: Tho' Poets pretend to Inspiration,
and cry out,
The god, the god
, they are, in the
Main, but meer Men, and have their Tricks and Quirks
to keep up the Reputation of that Art: Nay, like other
Professions, they would have us believe, that there's Mystery
in it too; not, I suppose, as Divines understand it,
but in the vulgar Sense, as it is understood when we say,
the Trade or Mystery of a
Cordwainer
. Some of these
Poetical Mysteries are as follow.

We are told that this Verse of
Homer
's Third
Iliad

was said, by
Alexander the Great
, to be the best in all
the Poem:

Great in the Wars, and great in Arts of Sway.

Methinks our
Gazette
Men, and
Courant
Men, express
themselves every whit as well, when in Honour of a defunct
General, whose Activity had long furnish'd them
with Matter for their News-Books, they tell us, He was
great alike in the Camp, and in the Cabinet, which easily
runs into as good a Verse as the other.

Great in the Camp, and in the Cabinet.

The next best Verses that ever were, are
Boileaus
; and
they were said to be the best in all his Works, by
La
[Pg 92]

Fontaine
: The Subject is the
French
King's setting up
Lace-making at
Roan
.

Et nos voisins frustrez de ces tributs serviles,

Que paiat a leur Art, le Luxe de nos Villes.

No more by foreign Tributes are we griev'd,

Which, from our Luxury, alien Arts receiv'd.

Why these are better Verses than all other best Verses,
is the Mystery we are speaking of, and like that of the
Free-Masons, it cannot be unfolded but by a Brother;
nay, one may suspect of this Mystery what is justly suspected
of that; they do not tell it us, for fear we shou'd
laugh at it.

Of this Kind, doubtless, is the famous Couplet, taken
out of Sir
John Denham
's
Coopers-Hill
, which
Dryden

says, are the two best Verses in the
English
Tongue:

Tho' Deep, yet clear; tho' Gentle, yet not dull;

Strong without Rage, without o'erflowing full.

He said he would not reveal the Secret why they were
the best Verses, but left it as a Riddle to Posterity. I
dare say, there are a Thousand as good Verses in
Mr.
Pope
's
Homer
, if by good Verses he means smooth
ones, and one would think Three such Monysyllables
as
Yet
,
Not
,
Dull
, all together, was enough to set aside
the Claim of that Line.

Having said so much already of my honest Intention
In this
Essay
, I must, at last, refer it to the Judgement
of the Reader, and whatever it is, shall receive it with
Pleasure, when it is given with Candour.

If he approves of what I have said, I cannot but be
pleased with having given some few Hints to another.

If he does not approve of it, 'twill please me still more
to receive new Light my self.

Since this Essay was finish'd, I have seen a Book
written by a
French
Gentleman, which has been
receiv'd with much Civility; and as that Gentleman
is commanded to make Remarks on our Manners
in
England
, he will not do us Justice unless he puts the
Reception his Book has met with, among the Instances
of our Humanity to Strangers.

I must own I have not learnt a good deal by it, and
the Reading of it has not excited any Impatience in me
[Pg 93]

to read any new
Heroick
Poem. I have long despair'd to
see another good
Dramatick
, and much more an
Epick

Poem in
English
, and cannot hope now to see one in

French
, which never yet was seen: However, I wish so
well to all such generous Enterprizes, that I think it
barbarous to give them the least Discouragement.

My Objections to this Gentleman's Criticisms are for
what he says too ill of
Milton
's Poem, and too good of

Clarendon
's History, which he highly commends for the
fine Characters, tho' he seems not to understand them, or
not to have inform'd himself sufficiently of the Facts on
which they are founded. He assures us the Lord
Clarendon

has
unravell'd all the Springs of the Civil Wars
.
I pass by the Expression to
unravel a Spring
, for that
probably it sounds better in the
French
Idiom than in
the
English
: But the Sense of it is not true in Fact.

He has drawn, at full Length, the pictures of those whose
Ambition shook the Foundation of his Country.
He has
drawn them at full Length indeed, but as
Milton

drew his shadowy Beings,
Death
,
Sin
,
Chaos
, by the
Extent of his Imagination, and with little Regard to
Historical Likeness, or copying after Nature; his Pictures
on the King's Side being to a Man, all so many
Heroes; on that of the Parliament so many
Scoundrels
;
which was impossible to be true: For, besides that it
was not in the Course, so it was not in the Nature of the
Thing, that so many heroical Persons should take Party
for Oppression and Superstition, and so many Blockheads
and Poltrons espouse the Cause of Religion and
Liberty.

But I do not wonder that this Critick is so extreamly
civil to the Author of the
History of the Rebellion
. He
censures
Milton
for drawing the Pictures of
Death
and
the
Devil
with so much Deformity.
Satan
,
Sin
, and

Death
, must needs
shock the Readers of a delicate Taste
.
As if it was possible for the Imagination to paint any
Thing so ugly as the Devil is in every One's Conception,
and that the more shocking such Painting is, it was not
the more natural, as being the more conformable to the
Idea which every one has conceiv'd of the Original. 'Tis
true, the
Devil
and
Death
are not Subjects to touch the

Delicacy
of Readers, but are extreamly proper to move
Horrour and Detestation, which are there the Moral of
[Pg 94]

that Divine Poem. If the Scene of
Paradise
was opening,
the Reader might have expected something to have
touch'd his
Delicacy
; but when he came, as in
Milton
,
to the Gates of Hell
wide open
, he certainly should have
left his Delicacy behind him.
Hans Holben
's Death's
Dance is a merry Piece, but was no more proper to admit
of Delicacy than the Droll Pieces of
Heemskirk
; and
it would not be more extravagant to put Perfumes among
the Ingredients of a
Stink-Pot
, than to put Delicacy in
a Picture of the Devil. One of the most masterly Pieces
of the greatest Matter of the
Lombard
School, a Carcass on
a Butcher's Stall with the Gutts and Garbage about it,
was much admir'd by the
Italians
, whose Delicacy is
exemplary to other Nations; whence one may conclude,
that whatever Subject has Truth and Likeness in it according
to Nature, or our Conception of it, will always
please, as an exact: and lively Imitation. I shall take
no more Notice of the Criticisms on
Milton
in this
Place, nor perhaps in any other; but I can never read
the Remarks of the Criticks on the
Paradise Lost
,
without calling to Mind the Boast of King
Alphonso
,
who criticising on the Form of the
Creation
, said,
If
he had been consulted in it, it should have been more
perfect.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

License.  You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

CHAPTER I.

THE snows had begun to disappear
from the far-famed valleys of
Berkshire; the mountain-tops and slopes
were still white; in the softening air was
the promise of the return of birds and
flowers; Nature was relenting from her
winter harshness, but man was less
kindly than Nature.

On Beauna Vista, one of the hillocks
rising slightly above the level of the
Housatonic Valley, the dayâs work was
done, and John Wycliff, a farm-laborer,
was awaiting the pay for his last monthâs
work before returning home.

There was nothing prepossessing about
Wycliffâs appearance. Short of stature,
minus one eye which he had lost in an
encounter with the Indians, with a bent
nose, a souvenir of a cattle-stampede on
the plains,âhe was tough and wiry as a
lynx, and his features betrayed almost
as little emotion as that animal.

His experience had been largely of a
[6]

kind to make him suspicious of his fellows,
and alert for self-defence. He had
knocked about the East in a variety of
occupations, and in the West had been
editor, cow-boy and gold-miner. He had
seen varying fortunes, having been
once part owner of a gold mine. He had
lost all and was now a common laborer
again. Although he still retained his interest
in the mine, it was considered
worthless. He had hopes that sometime
it might become valuable again through
the invention of cheaper methods of separating
the gold from the rock.

Jacob Sharp, the farm-superintendent,
was, in appearance, a typical Yankee.
He was tall and angular, with blue eyes,
which sometimes kindled with a kindly
light, but which oftener showed a steely
luster suggesting something of the serpent.
The nose was the most prominent
feature. It was large and sharply defined,
and he had a habit, when excited,
of blowing it vigorously.

On this occasion a trumpet-like blast
first warned John Wycliff that Boss Sharp
[7]

had something on his mind. He blew
his nose loudly several times, while the
blue eyes seemed to retreat more deeply
into their sockets and to give out a snaky
leer. After an unusually loud blast,
which testified to the healthy condition
of his lungs, he pulled some bank-notes
from his pocket.

âTwenty-five dollars,â he said, handing
the notes to Wycliff. âI have retained
five dollars for Mr. Bothan on the
bill which you owe him.â

âBut you agreed to pay me thirty-five
dollars per month,â replied Wycliff.
âI am very poorly situated at this time
for losing any part of my earnings. I
should be glad to pay all my debts in full
at once, but at present my wages will
barely supply the necessities of life for
my family.â Then, turning to Mr.
Bothan, who stood near by, he continued,
âBoth law and gospel make it a
manâs first duty to provide for his family.
Besides, you should have no preference
over my other creditors.â

But the words were wasted. Wycliff
[8]

might as well have appealed to the flint
boulders on the mountain side. Sharp
insisted that he had agreed to pay him
only thirty dollars per month, and he
also insisted on paying five dollars of that
sum to Richard Bothan on Wycliffâs debt.
He even threatened to discharge Wycliff
if the latter should take advantage of the
Bankruptcy Law and thus place Mr.
Bothan on a level with other creditors.
Wycliff received twenty-five dollars and
walked away.

Mr. Sharp then passed a five dollar
note to Mr. Bothan, who returned him
one of smaller denomination with the remark,
âHereâs a dollar for collecting.â

The men then separated, unconscious
that there had been any witness of their
conversation. Only a few steps distant,
where a rustic watering-trough was hidden
from sight by a clump of low hemlock
bushes, two horseback-riders, a lady
and a gentleman, had paused to let their
horses drink.

âWhat a spectacle that is!â exclaimed
the gentleman; âCongressman Baldwin,
[9]

one of the owners of this farm, belongs
to the national legislative body which
passed the Bankruptcy Law, and here we
see his foreman threatening to discharge
a workman for accepting the benefits of
that law. The law is designed to relieve
those who are unable to pay their debts.
Congressman Baldwin is sworn to uphold
the law. His foreman, Jacob Sharp,
is doing his best, in this instance, to destroy
the law. I donât believe David
Baldwin, the Congressman, would feel
very proud of his foreman if he witnessed
this scene.â

âWould his brother and partner,
Zechariah Baldwin, approve of it?â asked
the lady.

âI cannot say,â replied the gentleman.
âZechariah Baldwin has less sense
of justice or love for his workmen than
his brother David. But this is a mean act,
at any rate. Mr. Sharp has no moral or
legal rights to withhold the workmanâs
wages and it is contemptible at this time,
because Mr. Wycliff has a child very sick
and needs every dollar he can earn. I
[10]

am surprised that such a man as Sharp,
who is notorious for cheating his workmen,
should hold so high a position in
the church.â

âIt is much easier to criticise the
church than to help in the good work
which the church is doing,â answered
the lady tartly.

âWe have a right to criticise the church
if she fails to take up the work which
the Master left for her to do;â replied
the gentleman, but the lady was offended,
and the remainder of the journey
was passed in silence.

Meanwhile John Wycliff found little to
comfort him on his return home.

âRobert has been growing worse all
day;â were the first words of his wife:
âThe Doctor gives very little encouragement.
He says that to-night will decide
and that he is so frail and sensitive that
we must gratify all his whims. Whatever
he wants we must promise to get it
for him. The Doctor says we must not
cross him the least bit in any of his
wishes.â

[11]
The wife and motherâa slight, sensitive
thingâdropped upon her knees,
buried her face in the bed-clothes, and
prayed for her son in words which reached
no ear but the Almightyâs. Then she
lay down upon a couch, exhausted by
days and nights of watching.

The mother slept. The boy lay for the
most part quietly, his spirit fluttering as
lightly as a butterflyâs wing between life
and death. The father sat beside the
crib where his child lay, and watched
his every movement, bending down frequently
and placing his ear close to the
little suffererâs face, to learn if he were
still breathing. Once he woke his wife
hurriedly, thinking that the end had
come. But life still lingered.

There was a distant rumble of wheels.
John Wycliff recognized the sound of
that vehicle, and it made him for the
moment desperate. Some of the rough
points of his Western life had ingrained
themselves in his nature, and one characteristic
memento of that strenuous
time was at hand in a bureau-drawer.

[12]
He glanced at his wife. She was in a
sound sleep. He bent down and caught
the sound of the boyâs breathing. Then
he sprang to the bureau and rushed, coatless
and hatless, into the street.

Jacob Sharp was alone on his way to
the mid-weekly evening prayer meeting.
When he came into the shaft of light
thrown from the sick-room window, his
horse was grasped by the bridle, while a
low voice said: âPay me the wages you
defrauded me of!â and a pistol gleamed
in Sharpâs face.

âBe quick!â the voice added, as Mr.
Sharpâs right hand went up, as was his
habit when excited, to blow his nose.
The hand dropped quickly to his pocket,
and a ten-dollar note was handed over.

âTake legal action about this if you
choose, Mr. Sharp,â said Wycliff. âI
can land you in prison and for more than
one offense.â

âSay nothing, and I will say nothing;â
replied Sharp as he drove on.
Wycliffâs challenge uncovered a chapter
in Sharpâs history which he had fancied
[13]

covered up and which he did not wish
exposed. This adventure filled only a
very brief time, and again Wycliff was
by the bedside.

The little lips moved feebly. He placed
his ear close to them.

âPopâwill Iâhaveâponyâcartâheaven?â

It was with great difficulty that he
gathered the words. Heaven! What
did he know about heaven? What did
he care about it if such men as Jacob
Sharp and Richard Bothan were its representatives
here on earth? But he answered
instantly, recalling the doctorâs
warning, and bending close to the childâs
ear:

âYes, you will have everything you
want there.â

And then, very slowly and very feeblyâso
slowly and so feebly that his coarse
senses could hardly be sure of the scarcely
whispered wordsâcame the
âPopâwill Iâeverâhaveâponyâcartâhere?â

There was but an instantâs hesitation,
[14]

as the father recalled his inability to fulfil
his promise, and he replied, watching
his childâs face as the fluttering spirit
caught the meaning:

âYes, Robbie, if you will stay with us
you shall have a pony and a cart.â

This had been the height of the childâs
desire, his highest idea of happiness, his
heavenâto have a pony and a cart. In
sight of the other shore, and with voices,
perhaps, which his fatherâs coarse ear
could not hear, calling him thither, he
was willing to stay on this side if his desire
might be gratified.

The father thought he saw the slightest
trace of a smile on the thin face. The
boy slept. More than once there were
brief intervals when the father could not
detect his sonâs breathing, but as the
hours wore away there seemed to be a
gain.

Meanwhile the fatherâs memory was
busy. As a lightning-flash, in the night,
for an instant illuminates the entire landscape,
so his sonâs question flashed his
whole life in review before him. He recalled
[15]

the day, when, with high ideals,
he had pledged himself to Christ in the
little country meeting-house, and the
church had pledged friendship to him.
Later some of these comrades in the
church had defrauded him of all he possessed.
To-day the worst enemies of
himself and of every other workingman
in the town of Papyrus, were pillars in
the fashionable church of that place.
These things stood out in bold relief to-night,
as bold as the mountainâs rugged
outline when the lightningâs flash illumines
it.

âThe First Church of Papyrus,â Wycliff
had once said to Deacon Surface,
âdoes not stand for righteousness. It
will whitewash any wrong done by its
wealthy members. Our pastor is eloquent
in condemning the disfranchisement
of the negroes of the South, but
does not say one word to condemn the
disfranchisement of mill-hands in Papyrus.
Employees in the Baldwin Mills are
prevented from voting appropriations for
schools, roads, street-lights, and other
[16]

public benefits in their own town. To
be consistent, you should place the sign
of the Almighty Dollar on the pinnacle
of your beautiful church, and inscribe
over the altar these words: âThe rich can
do no wrong.ââ

Deacon Surface, who belonged, body
and soul to the Baldwins, had been horrified
at Wycliff, whom he regarded as
little better than an infidel. Wycliff regarded
Deacon Surface and his kind, as
followers of the Master only for the
âloaves and fishes.â

But the night wore away. The boy
was better. The mother was worn out,
and Wycliff remained at home to care for
his wife and child.

Jacob Sharp was an early caller.

âYour position will be open to you, at
thirty-five dollars per month, whenever
you can come back;â he said.

But Wycliff was never to return.

[17]

CHAPTER II.

âGOOD afternoon, Mr. Moriarty.â

It was Deacon Surface who
spoke, a gentleman who owed such influence
as he possessed to the fact that
he was an agent of the Baldwins, collecting
their rents, superintending in a
general way some of their enterprises,
and administering their local charities.

He was a man of excellent intentions,
but shallow. One of his best friends
thus described him:ââThe Deacon has
as many sides as a barrel. He doesnât
want to make any enemies, but when he
is cornered, he will roll toward the money
every time. If the Deacon were a judge,
and a man were brought before him
charged with stealing one hundred dollars,
and the charge were proved, he
would order the money divided equally
between the thief and his victim. That
is just about his idea of justice.â

The Deaconâs critics, if put in his
place, would perhaps do no better than
[18]

he. Being the personal and confidential
agent of the Baldwins, he must accept
their ideas of right and wrong, adopt
their conscience, as it were, or else surrender
a fat job such as seldom comes
to a man of common ability.

âThe top of the afternoon to you!â
replied the Irishman addressed, whose
traits were quite different from the Deaconâs.

âOf course you are going to vote for
Jacob Sharp for Selectman,â remarked
the Deacon.

âThe divil a bit will I vote for Jake
Sharp for any office, Deacon Surface.â

âIndeed, Mr. Sharp is a fine Christian
gentleman.â

âDo yez call the likes of old Jake Sharp,
the slave-driver, a fine Christian gentleman?
A liar, a thief, and a murderer
is what he is.â

Good Deacon Surface was shocked.

âThose are pretty hard names to apply
to a neighbor, Mr. Moriarty. I think
you would find it very difficult to prove
that Mr. Sharp is what you call him.â

[19]
âIndade I would not,â replied the indignant
son of Erin. âA liar? Did he
ever pay a man the wages he agreed to?
Not if he could help it. Didnât young
Mike Silk knock him down flat in his
tracks before Old Sharp could remember
that he promised to pay him two
dollars a day in haying? He remembered
it all right after Mike flattened
him. Oh, itâs a bad memory he has,
all right.

âA thief? Sure itâs yourself he was
after stâaling a shovel from. And sure
itâs your own memory needs bracing up,
too. Itâs your own shovel he was stâaling,
whittling off your name and branding
on his own with a red-hot iron. Forgot
all about it, have yez? Do yez forget
the time when he stole his own
daughterâs money, that he was guardian
for, and lost it, and the poor girl was
nigh going crazy over it? Itâs surely a
poor memory ye has, Deacon Surface.

âA murderer? I havenât forgotten
the day when he hurried young Pat
Flynn in the hay-field till the poor fellow
[20]

dropped dead by the side of me with
sun-stroke. I niver shall forget it in this
world. And when David Baldwin, the
Congressman, asked Sharp why did he
hurry the lad such a hot day, wasnât the
old villain after saying it was liquor that
killed him? And the poor lad never
tasted liquor. If that wasnât murder,
what would yez call it? An awful poor
memory yez have, all at once, Deacon
Surface.

âAnd yeâve forgot, too, how old Sharp
sold the disâased meat in the city, havenât
yez? Yeâve forgot intirely how two children
were killed by that same meat, so
the doctors said? And that is what yez
call a fine Christian gentleman in the
First Church, is it?â

âBut the meat charge was never
proved,â protested Deacon Surface.

âAnd itâs yerself knows as well as
anybody why it wasnât provedâbecause
Zach Baldwin wanted it hushed up. It
can be proved to-day if John Wycliff and
meself, and one other man I could name,
were called as witnesses.â

[21]
Deacon Surface realized that he was
not gaining ground, and changed his
tactics.

âYou had work on Congressman Baldwinâs
new streets at Maple Heights, last
fall, did you not?â

âIndade I did, and I earned ivery cint
I got, too, so I did, Deacon Surface.â

âBut there will be no work at Maple
Heights this year unless Mr. Sharp is
elected Selectman.â

âMaple Heights may go to Perdition.
Iâll not vote for old Jake Sharp if I niver
get another dayâs work from the Baldwins.
The likes of yerself cannot drive
Dave Moriarty one inch. Ye may stand
there and threaten till doomsday. Iâll
not vote for that slave-driver, Sharp.
He ought to be behind the bars.â

Deacon Surface moved on, to appeal
to workmen who would âhear to reason,â
as he expressed it.

As for David Moriarty, he hurried over
to his neighbor, John Wycliff, to tell him
of this latest game of the Baldwins. He
had barely left Wycliffâs, to return, when
[22]

Hugh Maxwell called to see John Wycliff.

This gentleman was fully as easy and
gracious in his manner, fully as well
qualified to get through the world without
provoking opposition, as Deacon Surface;
but, unlike the Deacon, he had to
depend upon his own resources, with no
millionaires to back him. He had a good
business as a retail merchant, and in
building up his trade had won many
friends and very little enmity. Mere
formalities over, Mr. Maxwell asked:

âWhat would be my chances in a campaign
against Jacob Sharp?â

âIf it were a perfectly fair election,
they ought to be the very best,â replied
Wycliff. âThe workingmen, who form
the large majority of the voters of Papyrus,
are favorable to you. But Mr.
Sharp is the candidate of the millionaire
paper-makers, and they practically own
the town. You know the methods which
the Baldwins will use as well as I do.
Coaxing and threatening, of the kind
which Deacon Surface knows so well
how to use, will have their effect. Any
[23]

employee of the Baldwins who openly
advocates your election will lose his job.
The Baldwins are already promising employment
if you are defeated, and threatening
to take away employment if you
are elected. Work on the new streets at
Maple Heights, will not be the only job
held up to the unemployed as a bribe and
a threat in this election. The cry is already
raised by the Baldwin agents:
âElect Sharp, and the Baldwins will
build a sewer for Papyrus; defeat Sharp,
and the Baldwins will defeat the sewer.â
This cowardly sort of bribery and threat
is permitted by Massachusetts Law, and
the Baldwins know full well how to use
it. Still, if you wish to run against
Sharp for Selectman, I will place your
name before the voters of Papyrus,
through the columns of the Elmfield

Star
.â

Wycliff obtained from Hugh Maxwell
a few facts which he needed, and his
caller departed; not, however, without
leaving a ten-dollar note, in appreciation
of the service which Wycliff was to undertake
[24]

for him. Wycliff then attended
to household duties, and performed little
services for the sick ones, who were improving
very slowly.

Then he wrote a letter to the
Star
, advocating
Hugh Maxwellâs election as Selectman.
The task was a pleasant one.
He mentioned Mr. Maxwellâs lifelong
residence in Papyrus; his courtesy,ââHe
is always and everywhere a gentleman;â
his honesty,ââWho ever heard
Hugh Maxwellâs word questioned in the
smallest particular?ââhis qualifications
for office from a business point of view,ââThe
man who has built up, from nothing,
a good business of his own, has some
qualities needed in the public service;â
his popularity,ââHe has the good will
alike of the employer and the workingman.â

Experience had taught Wycliff the folly
of exaggeration, and his nomination of
Hugh Maxwell for Selectman was recognized
by readers of the
Star
as a correct
description of the man, and not overdrawn.

[25]
Wycliffâs home duties were interrupted
in the evening by another aspirant for
political honorsâHerman Schuyler, an
extensive farmer, and also a dealer in a
variety of goods. In one respect Schuyler
was the only honest man of means in
Papyrus. He had broken all known records
by appearing at the office of the
assessors of Papyrus, and demanding
that ten thousand dollars be added to
his assessed valuation.

âI am worth fifty thousand dollars,â
he had said to the Assessors. âMy
property will sell for that, to-day. I am
not so mean as to be unwilling to pay a
tax on every dollar God has given me.â

Herman Schuyler was the most liberal
employer in the town of Papyrus. It
was not unusual for him to pay a higher
wage to a workman than had been agreed
upon, if the workman earned it. But he
was accustomed to giving orders, and
having them obeyed promptly. He
wanted a service from Wycliff, and he
called for it very much as he would have
ordered a roast or steak at the butcherâs.

[26]
âI want to run for Assessor. I want
you to write a letter to the
Star
in my
favor. I want you to write it, because
there is nobody, not even Congressman
Baldwin himself, who can put words together
as you can. Understand, now,
I am not asking you to vote for me. A
man has got pretty low down, in my own
opinion, when he will ask another man
to vote for him. I want my name placed
before the voters in the columns of the

Star
, and I ask you to do it, very much
as I would ask a lawyer to make out a
mortgage or a deed for me.â

The speaker was a heavy, square-built
man, clad to-night, as he usually was at
this season, in a bearskin coat, which he
did not remove. When he made a point,
in speaking, the square jaws closed like
a trap, and he brought a muscular fist
down heavily upon the arm of the rocker
in which he was seated.

âWell, Mr. Schuyler,â Wycliff replied
at length, âI will do my best for you, and
it will be a congenial task. Everything
that I know of you is in your favor; but
[27]

I fear that your very honesty will be used
against you. Our leading citizens do not
want a thoroughly honest man in the
office of Assessor. They want the property
of the town assessed at only a fraction
of its true value, so that the town
will not have to bear its just share of
state and county taxes. It is strange
that men who are leaders in the church
and in society, will argue the longest for
a dishonest valuation.â

âIf I am elected Assessor,â exclaimed
Schuyler, and he brought his fist down
upon the rocker-arm so that everything
about him shook, âI shall be true to my
oath. It is strange, as you say, that
Christian men will defend the violation
of an oath. Every assessor swears that
he will âneither overvalue nor undervalueâ
property for taxation.â

Then Schuyler presented to Wycliff
certain facts which he wished embodied
in the letter:âHow he came to Papyrus
forty years before, with only a dollar in
his pocket, and had built up his present
fine property by industry and fair dealing.

[28]
âI tell you what,â he said, as his hearer
excused himself to perform some service
for the sick ones, âYou write the letter
to-morrow, when you have leisure. Iâll
drive over in the evening and get it. By
the way, howâs your coal-bin?â

âPretty low,â replied Wycliff.

âVery well,â said Schuyler, âIâll send
a ton to-morrow and a receipt by the
driver. Good night.â

And out into the night went this last
candidate for political honors.

âA pretty good day financially, my
dears,â said Wycliff, as he kissed his
wife and son, and made everything secure
for the night.

[29]

CHAPTER III.

âJOHN, do you know where Pulpit
Rock is?â

âIndeed I do. Itâs two or three miles
into the Wilderness.â

âHow near can you drive to it?â

âPerhaps within a quarter of a mile.

âThereâs an old wood-road, which perhaps
runs as near as that to Pulpit Rock.

âThe road is very rough, gullied out by
water. There might be some danger of
breaking a carriage in it.â

âNever mind. Iâll run the risk. Be
ready in fifteen minutes.â

It was black-eyed Eva Baldwin who
gave the order, and within an hour they
had left the public highway, and were
following the ancient and unused wood-road
through the Wilderness. The wheel
of the buckboard bounded high over
stones that blocked the way, and then
dropped as suddenly into deep holes worn
by the freshets. The riders often dodged
or bent low to avoid being brushed from
[30]

their seats by branches of trees. It was
very far from being a pleasant ride, but
never a word of complaint from the lady.

She was anxious to secure the earliest
blossoms of the fragrant trailing arbutus,
to grace the pulpit on the morrow.

She might send some rare and costly
flowers from the greenhouse, but every
one of the Baldwin greenhouses would
contribute to the decoration of the church,
and she, being fond of wild flowers and
of nature at first hand, wished to bring
something direct from the Wilderness.

Eva Baldwin was a sister of David and
Zechariah Baldwin, and was worth a
couple of millions easily, but she never
realized how poor she was until the eloquent
young clergyman, the Reverend
Ralph Cutter, came to preach at the First
Church.

âMany a poor girl,â she said to an intimate
friend, âis richer than I am, in the
love of a good honest man.â

If the Reverend Ralph Cutter had
made any advances in her direction, he
would have been met, frankly and honestly,
[31]

by a good true woman. She admired
the new preacher the moment she
first saw him, and that admiration grew
with every service of his which she attended,
and with every opportunity for
becoming acquainted with him.

The coachman noticed the fire in the
black eyes, as she alighted.

âYou see that path?â he asked. âIt
leads through a hemlock grove, over a
flint ledge, and into a little valley beyond.
Pulpit Rock is across the valley
from the ledge. The earliest arbutus is
found across the valley, on the slope below
Pulpit Rock, among scattered bushes.
Shall I help you?â

âOh, no; Iâll find it easily,â she replied,
and taking the basket which the
coachman handed her, she followed the
path, humming a favorite song, and was
soon out of sight in the hemlocks.

On that same Saturday morning the
Reverend Ralph Cutter entered the
Wilderness from the opposite direction.
Perhaps none of those who listened to
the impassioned and earnest appeals of
[32]

the young minister, knew that he helped
to keep both his spiritual life and his
oratorical powers at white heat by this
weekly journey to the Wilderness, where
he spent an hour in secret prayer and in
speaking to the rocks and trees from the
text he was to use on the morrow.

Leaving the public road, he made his
way through the Wilderness, along a
path not very well marked, through somber
groves of pine and hemlock, through
other groves of red oak, rock-maple and
beech, across brooks, among large flint
boulders, and through tracts where the
wood had been cut off, and the thorny
blackberry canes had taken its place.
Part of the way the snow still covered
the ground, and part of the way the floor
of the Wilderness was carpeted with the
blooms of the hepatica, or liverwort,
with here and there an early blossom of
the trailing arbutus.

He made the same journey each Saturday,
that he might be alone for secret
prayer, where he expected no interruption
and also where he might, in the freedom
[33]

of the Wilderness, give the morrowâs
sermon. I do not mean that he would use
the same words on Sunday that he hurled
at the white birch trees and flint boulders
on Saturday. But the ideas would be
the same. He never used any written
sermon.

One of his deacons once said of him:ââHe
seems to have everything connected
with his subject so completely under his
control, that he has only to reach out and
grasp the idea that comes next, and hurl
it at you with the force and speed of a
thunderbolt. We used to have sleepy
hearers. I have seen no one nodding
under Ralph Cutterâs preaching. We
used to have complaints from people who
were hard of hearing. Ralph Cutter
seems to think it is a part of his business
to make the people hear.â

How much of Ralph Cutterâs power on
Sunday was due to his hour of prayer in
the Wilderness, and to his Saturday sermon
to the crags and bushes from Pulpit
Rock, I cannot tell.

He was heavy-hearted to-day, and the
[34]

first words which were echoed back to
him by the flint ledge across the valley
were these:â

âThis is my farewell to you. There
are people in this church who attempt to
dictate what I shall say from this pulpit.
Not only do they attempt to dictate what
I shall say here, but they attempt to dictate
my actions outside. They tell me
that I must not exercise the right, belonging
to every citizen, of expressing
my opinions in private or public, on questions
of public policy.

âThere is no person on this earth rich
enough, or powerful enough, to dictate
what I shall say, or what I shall not say,
as a preacher of the gospel. You may
have this pulpit, and you may secure, to
fill it, some one who will be your slave;
but I will wear no other bonds than those
of the Master, whether in the pulpit or
out, and no man, even though he be a
thousand times a millionaire, will shape
my words or actions, as a minister of the
gospel, or as a private citizen.â

There was much in Ralph Cutterâs
[35]

mind that did not find expression in
words. He had been disgusted with the
First Church in Papyrus, or rather with
its bosses, before he had been with it a
fortnight. Only the magical charm of a
pair of black eyes, and the lovable personality
behind them, had made life in
the Paper Town endurable to him. Recently
Zechariah Baldwin had given the
young preacher plain notice that if he
continued to occupy the pulpit of the
First Church, he must cut out some of
his pet hobbies from future sermons.
He must cease to meddle with the relations
between labor and capital, both in
the pulpit and outâand, in short, he
must omit everything which could possibly
offend the Honorable Zechariah.
This dictation the young preacher positively
refused to submit to.

He tried to imagine the changed attitude
of the people toward him at the
close of to-morrowâs sermon. There
would be faces averted from him which
had always before been friendly. There
would be hands withheld which had always
[36]

before sought his in friendly greeting.

There was one peculiarly sharp thorn
in this thorny affair. How he wished
that those searching black eyes did not
belong to a member of the âRoyal Familyâ,
as the Baldwin family was sometimes
called.

Nature was not disturbed by his eloquence.
A hawk sailed with unmoved
wings, in mighty circles, high above him.
The noisy blue jays were mobbing an
owl in the oak grove close by. The
blossoms of the trailing arbutus were as
lavish of their fragrance as if no one in
the world were troubled, or perplexed,
or in love.

All unconscious that any human being
was within hearing, the preacher continued:â

âWhen I first came to Papyrus I delivered
a sermon against the disfranchisement
of negroes at the South. After
the service a workingman asked me
why I did not ask a full and free ballot
for the white paper-maker of Massachusetts,
[37]

as well as for the negro cotton-planter
of Mississippi? I was much surprised
when the workman told me that
mill-hands in Papyrus, who are legal
voters, do not have a full vote in town-government,
and cannot secure it.

âI have since investigated actual conditions
here, and find that the Papyrus
mill-hand, even if he owns his home,
cannot vote appropriations for schools,
highways, street-lights, sewers, and
other public improvements for which he
is taxed. The mill-hand, it is claimed,
is given two hours in which to attend
town-meeting. That period of two hours
always includes the dinner-hour. The
trip to and from the town-hall, in some
cases, takes nearly the whole of the two
hours.

â
Two hours
for the rightful monarch
of Papyrus to say how the town shall be
governed! A two-hour limit to prevent
the real creator of all your wealth from
saying how that wealth shall be taxed!

Two hours
limit for a free citizen of
the grand old Commonwealth of Massachusetts
[38]

on Town-Meeting-Dayâthe day
that taught New England to be free!
In reality, not two hours, not one hour.
Barely time for the rightful monarch to
mark a ballot for town-officers and return
to the mill, while the usurper remains
and dictates what sums shall be
spent by the town for schools, highways
and other needs.

âI have consulted one of the best lawyers
in the state. He says: âThe Commonwealth
of Massachusetts does not
guarantee to its mill-hands, who may be
legal voters, the right to vote in town-affairs.
The paltry two-hour provision
only makes a farce of free government
in mill-towns. It does not apply to town-meetings.
In some towns the workmanâs
full rights are secured by shutting
down the mills on town-meeting day,
and in others by holding the business
meeting, for appropriations, in the evening.
But where the town authorities
and the employers, as in Papyrus, are
both opposed to allowing the mill-hands
to vote on appropriations, they have no
[39]

legal remedy. The political leaders, or
bosses, of the State have been asked to
correct the law, but they say the matter
is of no importance,âas if anything
could possibly be more important than
the principle of equal rights, upon which
our nation is founded.ââ

âAnd this,â shouted the speaker in
the Wilderness, âthis is the boasted
equal rights of Massachusetts. I do not
wonder that you, manufacturers of Papyrus,
are ashamed,âso ashamed that you
have forbidden me to mention this subject
in the pulpit,âso ashamed that you
have muzzled every newspaper within
fifty miles, even the usually independent
Springdale
Democrat
. You ought to be
ashamed. The State of Massachusetts,
which disfranchises its own workmen,
while demanding political equality for the
Southern negro, ought to be ashamed.â

Soon after Miss Baldwin left the coachman
heard a voice, and fearful for her
safety, hurried to the ledge, where he
saw and heard the speaker. He did not
stay long, but long enough to learn that
[40]

it was the ministerâs farewell, and a very
unusual discourse.

âMy last word to you,â rang out the
powerful voice across the valley, âshall
be in favor of a pure church. Ask on
the street, for the worst libertines and
adulterers in town, the wreckers of happy
homes, the men whose social life is a
stench,âand members of this church,
protected by their wealth, will be pointed
out to you. Search for the employers
most unjust to their workmen, and you
will find them sheltered by this church.
My parting advice is, to purify your
church,âto drive out of it the thieves and
adulterers, or to cease calling it a church
of Christ.â

The lady returned with a basket of arbutus,
but there was no song on her lips,
and the fire had burned out of the black
eyes.

âJohn,â she said, âdrive me to the
home of the Widow Fordyce. She is sick
and may be glad of these flowers.â

To an acquaintance, that evening, the
coachman said:ââIf you want to hear
[41]

Reverend Ralph Cutterâs farewell and
the greatest sermon ever preached in
Papyrus, go to the First Church to-morrow.â

The news spread rapidly, and Ralph
Cutter was surprised when he met a congregation
for which the building could
not furnish standing-room. But even
those in the street heard him.

[42]

CHAPTER IV.

CONDITIONS improved steadily with
the Wycliffs. Mrs. Wycliff and
Robert were both gaining slowly, but
surely. From various sources, some of
them unexpected, came sufficient income
to pay all bills promptly when due. Wycliff
had dabbled in literature since boyhood,
and his income from this source,
though small, was helpful.

While he was still at home, helping
about the house, and frequently consulted
by Hugh Maxwell, and by those whose
political fortunes were linked with his,
a stranger called. He was a keen-looking
man, who wasted no time in ceremony.

âJohn Wycliff, I believe?â

âYes, sir.â

âI am Wilfrid Terry, of the Elmfield

Star
. We are not satisfied with our sales
in Papyrus. We sell only a thousand
papers here, whereas we ought to sell
fifteen hundred. We are told that you
[43]

have had experience in newspaper work,
and a gentleman who is acquainted with
your former work, thinks you could bring
our sales in Papyrus up to what they
ought to be.â

âI donât believe that I could work for
you.â

âIndeed, and why not?â

âAs I have learned it, good journalism
is no respecter of persons. I could not,
or rather I would not, work under your
system, which tells the truth about the
poor man, but conceals the truth about
the rich man.â

âI donât understand you.â

âI can tell you in a way that you will
understand,â replied Wycliff sharply:
âWhen Rudolph Hartland, a small contractor,
had trouble with his workmen,
and a dozen of them went on a strike,
you devoted columns of valuable space to
the occurrence; but when hundreds of
employees in the Liberty Mill of the Baldwin
Paper Company, struck against a cut
in wages, your paper never mentioned it.
Here was an important event, in which
[44]

the public had a vital interest, but you
would not allow any reference to it in the
paper. You have never allowed the facts
to be presented in your publication regarding
the partial disfranchisement of
workingmen in Papyrus, by which all
mill-hands are prevented from having any
voice in town-government, except to vote
for town-officers, being shut out from
voting for appropriations. Only a short
time ago you refused to publish Reverend
Ralph Cutterâs farewell sermon, the most
notable sermon, perhaps, ever preached
in Papyrus. Why have you refused publicity
to these things, which the people
want to know, and which the people are
entitled to know? Simply because you
are afraid of offending the Baldwins.
You ought to wear a brass collar, with
your ownerâs name on it.â

John Wycliffâs voice and features
were not expressive. He could never
have been an actor. But he was getting
waked up, and a little light was creeping
into his one lonesome, dull gray eye.
Such expression as there was in his features
[45]

was of loathing and contempt. He
looked as if he would have been glad to
take up his visitor with a pair of tongs,
deposit him gently in some out-of-the-way
place, and cover him up so that he
would not offend the senses of decent
people.

âI didnât come here to listen to abuse
of this kind,â exclaimed Terry angrily.

âNever mind what you came here
for,â retorted Wycliff. âIf you stay
around me you will hear a grain of truth
occasionally. There may be something
to be said for a man like Deacon Surface,
who serves the devil for a fat salary,
but you serve him for nothing. The
Baldwins despise you, as such men always
despise their slaves, and the public
despises you, too. And what do you get
out of it? You complain that you are
selling only one thousand papers in Papyrus.
Why not give the facts that the
people are entitled to know, and sell fifteen
hundred?â

Terry was angry, but the money was
what he was after, and possibly Wycliff
[46]

was right, after all, in what he said.

âLetâs talk business,â he said. âCome
out to Lawyer Sturgisâ office to-morrow,
and weâll sign an agreement. If you can
bring our circulation in Papyrus up to
fifteen hundred copies, you shall have
fifteen hundred dollars a year, and one
yearâs salary guaranteed. You shall
handle the Papyrus news and comment
upon it as you see fit, so long as you do
not render the publisher of the paper
liable to an action at law. If we differ
on this point, Lawyer Sturgisâ decision
shall be final.â

âItâs a bargain,â said Wycliff, and
his caller departed.

The details were arranged, and contract
signed, the next day. A few evenings
later Wycliff was sitting in what he
humorously called his âoffice.â It contained
a few books, mostly for reference,
a convenient desk, a small safe, a
stuffed cougar, or mountain lion, from
the Rockies, and a mounted moosehead
from Maineâall of these things being
reminders of more prosperous times.
[47]

Frowning upon all, and seemingly out of
place, was a good likeness of Congressman
Baldwin, of whom Wycliff had been
a great admirer.

Answering a timid knock, Wycliff
found a fellow-laborer at the door, a
weak-minded French Canadian, a mere
boy, who went by the name of âHalf-witted
Joe.â

âHow do you do, Joe?â he asked when
his old comrade was seated.

âMad.â

âWhat is the trouble?â

âMr. Sharp no pay me. He say me
no worth ten dollars.â

âDid he pay you anything?â

âYes, five dollars for clothes.â

âYou worked one month?â

âYes, he promise me ten dollars and
board.â

âI heard him.â

âMe get up early; me work lateâeight
oâclock, sometimes. Me work
hard. Mr. Sharp say me no earn only
five dollars. Damn.â

âWhat will you do?â

[48]
âMe go home, Canada.â

âHave you money enough to take you
home?â

âNo. Me sell watch, five dollar.â

He exhibited a watch, for which Wycliff
thought he could safely pay that
amount, and he handed Joe the money.

âThank,â said Joe, as he stepped over
the threshold, âMe fix old Sharp.â

âDonât hurt Mr. Sharp,â Wycliff cautioned
him. âMr. Sharp has a good wife,
and good children. Besides, you would
go to prison.â

The tone of his visitor changed. He
seemed to realize that he had blundered
in making the threat.

âMe no hurt Mr. Sharp,â he finally
promised, and then he went out into the
darkness.

âDonât lose your money,â was Wycliffâs
parting advice.

When he was out in the night again,
Joeâs anger kindled anew, as he remembered
the farm-superintendentâs injustice.
Although Wycliffâs warning prevented
him from doing Sharp bodily
[49]

harm, he was still bent on revenge. Revenge
was still the uppermost idea in
Half-Witted Joeâs unbalanced mind, as
he approached Beauna Vista, and the
dark night had its strong influence upon
his thought and purpose.

He glanced in at the farm-house windows.
The family and the farm-hands
were busy reading. Mr. Sharp, he knew,
had gone to a public meeting. The coast
was clear. He stole around to the side
of the barn farthest from the house. He
went through an unused stable, to where
the lower part of a great mow of hay
was exposed.

There was the flash of a match, the
sudden darting upward of the flames on
the edge of the hay-mow, and then Joe
hurried out through the yard, across the
meadow, and reaching the railroad track,
followed it to the edge of a piece of
woods.

Here he halted, cowering in some
bushes, and looked. He saw the light
gleam from the big barn-doors, saw the
flames break through the roof, saw the
[50]

inmates of the house rush out, and heard
the alarm sounded from farm-house to
farm-house. Soon a neighboring farmer
rushed past Joe, on his way to the
fire, and as the flames now lit up the landscape
all around, Joe realized that he
might be discovered, and passed on. But
while he looked, he feasted his eyes as
greedily as a former savage might have
done, on the destruction of a pioneer
home.

âMe fix you, Jake Sharp,â he said,
in a whisper, as he shook his fist in
farewell at Beauna Vista. He did not
realize that the loss fell upon others,
and not upon Sharp. An hour later he
was aboard a train on his way to Canada.

The farm-building which is fired is
usually doomed. It could not be otherwise
on this occasion, when the flames
had their start in a forty-ton mow of
hay, dry as tinder.

The farm-laborers first saved the horses.
Their next move was such as might have
been expected from excited men, unused
to such emergenciesâthey began dragging
[51]

out the vehicles, until Mrs. Sharp,
with more forethought than the men, exclaimed:
âThe cows! the cows next!â

âBut we cannot get at the door of the
cow-stable,â the laborers protested.

âTake crowbars and break in the side
of the barn!â she ordered, and under a
womanâs direction the work of rescue
went on.

The fire-department of Papyrus responded
tardily, owing to distance, and
could do but little, except to protect the
farm-house. Finally, as the glowing pageant
lit up the landscape for miles in
every direction, half the men of Papyrus
were on the scene, but could do nothing
except listen to the crackle of burning
timbers, and the bellowing of imprisoned
and roasting cattle.

John Wycliff knew very well that the
Baldwins would not wish the story of the
relations of Jacob Sharp and Half-Witted
Joe published, but he considered that the
public was entitled to know it. The story
of the poor Canadian boy, and his treatment
by Jacob Sharp, was told in the
Star
[52]

as graphically as the story of the fire itself.
In his narrative Wycliff made a
clear distinction between known facts
regarding the fire, and mere suspicions
or rumors.

The
Tribune
, the
Starâs
Elmfield rival,
the property of Congressman Baldwin,
made this announcement:â

âNot a clue is obtainable regarding
the origin of the fire. Mr. Sharp, the
foreman of Beauna Vista, is a man who
always keeps the good will of his employees,
so that not a shadow of suspicion
can lie in that direction.â

This way of dealing with news was entirely
in harmony with the usual policy
of the Baldwins, where their own interests
were involved. There were several
persons who were angry at the course
taken by the
Star
. The Baldwins were
angry, partly because they regarded it
as an intrusion upon their private affairs
and partly because the fire-story had
dealt Sharp a hard blow in his fight for
the office of Selectman.

As for Sharp, he threatened various
[53]

things, but his own attorney told him to
âpocket his wrath and say nothing,â as
he could not maintain an action against
the
Star
.

Terry was happy, as the sales of the

Star
, in Papyrus, had been lifted between
two and three hundred, and the
increase promised to prove permanent.

[54]

CHAPTER V.

âHOW are you and the lad, this
morning, Mrs. Wycliff?â asked
that good neighbor, Mrs. Clyde.

âGetting along nicely, thank you, and
very glad to see you,â replied Mrs. Wycliff.
âBut how does it happen that you
are not working to-day?â

âThe strike. Havenât you heard of
the rag-cuttersâ strike? Three hundred
rag-cutters walked out of the Baldwin
Mills an hour ago.â

âI didnât know that the Baldwins ever
had a strike in their mills.â

âThey donât often have one, and when
they do, the world at large does not know
about it, they have such a strong grip
on the newspapers about here. My son,
Tom, works on the Springdale
Democrat
,
and he has told me a lot about these
things. Springdale is about fifty miles
from here, and the
Democrat
pretends to
be an independent newspaper, and yet it
never prints any news from Papyrus
[55]

which can possibly hurt Congressman
Baldwin. Some years ago, Tom began
work as correspondent here for the

Democrat
, and there was a big strike
here, in the Liberty Mill, which belongs
to the Baldwin Paper Company. Tom
didnât know any better then, and he
sent them a long article about the strike.
Not a word of it was printed, and the
editor wrote Tom that they never printed
any news of that kind about the Baldwins.
Then the other Springdale paper,
the
Universe
, is owned by Congressman
Baldwin; so, of course, that does not
print a word regarding troubles in the
Baldwin Mills.â

âBut what was the cause of the strike
to-day?â inquired Mrs. Wycliff.

âThere were a good many things that
had something to do with it,â replied the
neighbor, âbut fines were the worst.â

âFines! Do you have to pay fines?â
asked Mrs. Wycliff.

âYes, in this way. Perhaps you do
not understand how fast we have to
work to earn what we get. We earn
[56]

about one dollar per day, and to do this
we must cut in the neighborhood of one
hundred and twenty-five pounds of rags.
Now, in cutting these rags, if we overlook
a button, or a bit of rubber, we are
fined a pound of rags.â

âThat is, if you put in a piece of cloth
having a button on it, no matter how
small, you must cut an extra pound of
rags, to punish you for overlooking that
button. Am I right?â

âYes, you have it exactly right, and
itâs just the same if I put in a piece of
cloth which has a bit of rubber in it.
And here, see here is a bit of cloth that
came back to me this morning,âjust
this little bit of a letter, sewed into the
cloth.â And she showed Mrs. Wycliff a
bit of white cloth, on which was a small
initial, such as is used in marking garments.

âThere are hundreds of pieces and
consequently hundreds of motions we
must make in cutting one pound of rags,
for which we receive less than a cent.
Working so rapidly as we are obliged to
[57]

do, to accomplish our dayâs task, is it
any wonder that a piece of cloth, containing
a button, or a bit of rubber, slips
through our fingers unnoticed now and
then?â

âAnd this is what the strike is about?â

âYes, this is the main thing. We are
willing to pay something of a fine for
failure to notice rubber and buttons, but
we think that the fine is now too heavy.
There are some other things we donât
likeâsome brutal bosses, not fit to drive
oxen, let alone women. Our scythes are
often poorly ground. The Baldwins seem
to think anything is good enough for a
woman to cut one hundred and twenty-five
pounds of rags a day on. Sometimes
it is very dark for our work.â

âIs no light furnished at such times?â

âNever. The office force, or other
departments of the mill, may have lights
at noon of a cloudy day, but we are of
no account. It is often too warm in our
room. We donât need much heat because
we have plenty of exercise. We
must be kept too warm on account of the
[58]

âlookers over,â who donât have much exercise,
except when they jump up on the
tables, to get away from a mouse.â

âCouldnât the âlookers overâ have a
separate room, which could be kept
warm enough for them, so that your
room could be cooler and more comfortable
for you?â

âI donât know. If the matter of fines
is made right, we will say nothing about
the rest. When we make complaints,
we are usually told that the Baldwins
could get machines to cut rags, cheaper
than we cut them, and that they only
hire us out of charity.â

âI am surprised at the way the rag-cutters
are treated,â said Mrs. Wycliff;
âI have always heard that the Baldwins
were very generous.â

âThey are generous,â replied her visitor,
âbut they are not just. There is an
old saying, âBe just before you are generous,â
which, if lived up to in Papyrus,
would make a wonderful difference in favor
of the working class. How have the
Baldwins made their millions? Of course
[59]

the whole world knows that they make a
very high grade of paper. It is said that
this is due, in some measure, to the pure
water found in Papyrus, which is the
gift of God. Then, too, it is claimed
that Mack Baldwin laid the foundation
of the Baldwin millions by manipulations
in Wall Street, during the Civil War.
But some of those millions are the fruit
of low wages. If the Baldwins pay
twenty-five cents a day less than a fair
wage, to two thousand hands, three hundred
days in a year, what is the result?
Itâs a yearly saving of one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, of money due the
laborer, is it not? Then, perhaps, the
Baldwins may spend fifteen thousand
dollars a year in pensions to a very few,
and in charity to the working class.
Nothing can exceed the cleverness of the
Baldwins, in making one dollar in charity,
look bigger to the laborer, than ten
dollars in wages withheld. I think the
time is coming when the law will require
the accounts of all such concerns as the
Baldwin Paper Company, to be as open
[60]

as town accounts, and then the lionâs
share of profits will go to the laborer.
But I guess you have had all the rag-room
and paper-mill you want for one
day.â

âNo, I have been very much interested,
and I wish you women might get
justice,â replied Mrs. Wycliff. âI think
there cannot be any harder or more disagreeable
work in the mill than yours,
and I wish that you might have better
pay and kinder treatment. The Baldwins
are well able to pay. I hear that
this new library that Zechariah Baldwin
is giving to the city of Elmfield will cost
a half a million dollars.â

âYes, I try to restrain my anger, as
a Christian woman should,â said Mrs.
Clyde, âbut my blood boils every time I
see that building. We poor women must
slave in Zack Baldwinâs rag-room, and
the money which ought to go to the mill-help,
in higher wages, is given, with a
great flourish of trumpets, to the city of
Elmfield, which is already rich enough.
As to our work. If we try to work a bit
[61]

faster than usual, we are liable to get cut
on the scythes, and thereâs many a terrible
gash been got in the rag-room. Then
how often do you hear of contagious diseases
spread by the rags of a paper-mill.

âThe worst slap the Baldwins ever
got was from a wealthy Southern lady,
who visited their mills last summer.
She said to Zack Baldwin:ââThe slaves
on my fatherâs plantation in Georgia,
were treated with more consideration,
and were more contented and happy at
their work than your rag-cutters. But
the slave-holding system was wrong, and
it fell. I think also, the system under
which you Northern millionaires eat the
apple, and give your employees the core,
is wrong and will fall, too,â But I have
stayed too long.â And Mrs. Clyde vanished.

John Wycliff sat in his den, within
easy ear-shot, and the pith of the womenâs
talk was woven into his account of
the strike, for the
Star
.

More than two thousand copies of the
[62]

Star
were sold that day in Papyrus, and
its circulation was raised permanently to
a point near those figures.

The Honorable Zechariah Baldwin was
furious when he read the
Starâs
account
of the strike. Never before had a local
newspaper dared to print the news of a
Baldwin strike, much less to hold those
âcaptains of industryâ up to public criticism,
as it had done to-day.

But Terry was happy. He had sold
extra thousands of his paper, the largest
edition ever sold of a Berkshire newspaper,
and scores of citizens, in all walks
of life, had congratulated him on his
bravery in defying the Baldwins.

The most important result of the
Starâs

article was that it was copied, more or
less fully, by other papers throughout
the country, owing to Congressman Baldwinâs
prominence as a public man. A
strike in his mills is not a good asset for
a Congressman, and David Baldwin telegraphed
his brother, from Washington,
to grant the rag-cuttersâ demands immediately.
Zechariah Baldwin reluctantly
[63]

complied with the order sent by wire.

The Honorable Zechariah Baldwin appeared,
a very angry man, at the office
of the
Star
.

âI want you to discharge that Wycliff,â
was his first greeting to Mr. Terry,
the proprietor.

âHow long have you owned this office,
that you assume to run my business?â
rejoined Mr. Terry.

âBut you know that weâre not used to
being treated as the
Star
treated us yesterday,â
protested the paper-manufacturer.

âThen the best thing that you can do
is to get used to it,â retorted the publisher,
who was now beginning to get
angry on his own account. âYouâve
been treated as if you were superior beings,
but you are no better than other
people. I have been suppressing the
truth about you millionaires for years,
and losing thousands of dollars by doing
so. I might have sold thousands of copies
of the
Star
, in Papyrus and throughout
the county, had I not truckled to you
[64]

Baldwins, like a dog, instead of being a
man. Hereafter the truth is to be published
about you, just the same as about
other folks, and Wycliff is under contract
to do it for a year. He is recommended
as being entirely competent to deal with
such cases as yours. Perhaps I shall go
out and tell you how to run your mills.
Thereâs the door, Zack Baldwin,â and
the proprietor of the
Star
, now thoroughly
angry, motioned the millionaire out.

But the lord of Papyrus, although more
surprised than he had been before in
years, was not to be thus easily thwarted.

âWhat will you take for your newspaperâfor
the entire plant?â he asked,
in a more conciliatory tone.

âTwenty-five thousand dollars,â replied
the publisher, immediately, naming
a price so far beyond its true value
that he felt sure it would be declined.

âA pretty steep price, isnât it?â asked
Baldwin.

âWho asked you to buy?â retorted
Terry.

âCome over to Lawyer Stimsonâs and
[65]

draw the writings,â said the paper-manufacturer,
withdrawing.

Next day John Wycliff received this
note:â

â
My dear Wycliff
:

âYouâre a jewel. Iâve sold the
Star
to Zack
Baldwin for $25,000. (Itâs actual value is around
$15,000.) I didnât even sign the usual agreement,
not to engage in the same business again in the
same city.

âEnclosed you will find check for $1,500, according
to agreement by which I guaranteed you
one yearâs salary.

âWhen I first met you, I thought you were a
discourteous crank, but my finances and my self-respect
were both badly in need of the rebuke
which you gave me. Your way of dealing with
such cattle as the Baldwins beats mine out of
sight.â

âYours always,

Wilfrid Terry
.â

[66]

CHAPTER VI.

âWHERE are you going, pop?â
asked Robert, as Mr. Wycliff
drove into the yard, with a horse and
carriage, one fine morning.

âGoing to take you and ma for a little
ride into Godâs country,â replied the father.

âBut I thought everywhere was Godâs
country,â replied the little fellow in surprise.

âSurely,â replied the father. âAll
this beautiful world is the Lordâs, but
He seems to have given the greater part
of the land about here to the Baldwins,
or perhaps it would be more nearly correct
to say that He has allowed them to
grab it. I expect to take you to-day to
see a place, which seems to me to be
more especially Godâs country, because
He has not allowed one man, or one family,
to get possession of all of it.â

âAnd you think it is a better country?â

[67]
âIndeed I do, in some respects.â

After passing out of the paper-manufacturing
village of Papyrus, eastward,
they came to a big, deserted, wooden
mill, with many tumble-down houses
near it.

âSay, pop, what village is this?â

âSodom.â

âAnd what is that old stone mill beyond?â

âThat is Gomorrah.â

âQuite a place for Bible names,â broke
in Mrs. Wycliff. âThose ruins of another
old stone mill, also broken down
and deserted, I suppose are Babylon?â

âExactly so, my dear, and farther up
stream we shall pass Tyre and Sidon, also
broken down and deserted. This entire
river-valley along here is often called the
Valley of Desolation.â

âWho owns it?â asked Mrs. Wycliff.

âThe Baldwins, who bought it, for a
very little, from the Quiet Valley Woolen
Company.â

âWhy donât the Baldwins build paper-mills
here?â

[68]
âI cannot tell you. It has always
seemed to be the Baldwin policy to build
up the other end of the town, at the expense
of this end. Certainly the Baldwins
have played the part of the âdog
in the manger,â in regard to East Papyrus.
They will neither build mills here
themselves, nor will they sell the property
so that anyone else can build here.
The Wessons, who own the paper-mills
at Papyrus Center, would have built mills
here, giving employment to a large number
of people, if they could have secured
the property. The Baldwins have already
made plans for robbing East Papyrus
of her water-power, which is all that
this end of the town has left.â

âBut how can they do that?â

âVery easily. The water-power can
be transformed into electricity, and then
the electricity can be transferred by
wire, to the Baldwin Mills, at the west
end of the town. The plans are already
made. It will increase the dividends of
the Baldwin Mills, which already pay
enormous profits, but it makes the prospect
[69]

for rebuilding East Papyrus much
blacker than before.â

âBut wouldnât it be better for the town
of Papyrus to have all its mills rebuilt
and running at a fair profit, than to have
a part of them running at an immense
profit?â protested Mrs. Wycliff.

âCertainly; it is not the good of the
town, but the enrichment of the Baldwins,
which is to be considered. These
shrewd financiers rarely spend a dollar,
unless they feel sure that it will come
back, leading several other dollars with
it.â

âBut they gave that beautiful big
building to the town, pop,â put in Robbie.

âYes. It cost the Baldwins one hundred
thousand dollars, and it has cost the
town twice that.â

âHow is that, pop?â

âIn taxes lost. The Assessors say:ââwe
must tax the Baldwins lightly, because
they are so generous to the town.â
Some of the Baldwin properties are not
assessed for more than one-third value,
[70]

an enormous loss to the town in taxes.â

Soon they left the valley, and began to
climb the mountain, still going eastward.

âWild flowers, pop. Please hold up,
and let me get some.â The boy soon returned
to the carriage, with his hands
full of the blossoms of the coltsfoot,
white, blue, and yellow violets, bell-flowers,
and wake-robins. As they ascended
the mountains, they found the
trailing arbutus and the spring-beauty,
which had bloomed earlier in the valleys.

A beautiful farm was reached.

âWho owns this?â asked Mrs. Wycliff.

âThomas Bothan. He has retired
from business, and spends some of his
time here. I hope I may find him.â
Then, for the first time, he told his wife
of the last day at Beauna Vista,âhow
Sharp and Bothan had conspired to keep
back a part of his wages on Bothanâs old
debt. He had not dared to tell her at
the time.

He soon found Mr. Bothan.

âI want a receipt in full,â he said, as
[71]

he produced the money due Bothan, and
then, taking leave of him, he added:ââThe
last debt I owe will be paid to-day,
and I have paid every debt as fast as I
was able to do so. You would have received
yours just as promptly, had you
not tried to take the bread away from
my family to get it.â

For a distance their route lay through
a grand old forest of large trees. The
boy was jubilant as he saw, first a striped
squirrel, then a red one, then a gray,
and then:â

âOh, look quick, pop; what was that?
It looked like a squirrel, but it flew, or
rather it sailed, from one tree to another.â

âA flying squirrel.â

âAnd thereâs a rabbit. Oh, now I begin
to see why you call this Godâs country.â

About noon they reached their destination,
the farm of Phillips Porter, in
Sprucemont, where they were expected,
and where a substantial meal was awaiting
them.

[72]
âYou have been very patient with
me,â said Wycliff, as he paid Porter
about one hundred dollars, the last debt
he owed. Mr. Porter told again to-day,
(and he seemed to enjoy telling it,) the
story of how he came to leave Papyrus.

âIt was many years ago, and Mack
Baldwin, father of the present generation
of paper-makers, was in control, although
Zechariah and David were young
men then, just learning the business.
The Baldwins were not then so completely
in control of the town of Papyrus as they
are now. Captain Bolton Wesson, who
built the paper-mills at Papyrus Center,
was a broader and better man than Mack
Baldwin, and the two were often opposed
to one another in town-affairs.

âCaptain Wesson wanted the town-hall
located at the Center, the natural
and proper place for it, but Mack Baldwin
demanded that it be built at the
West End, the part of the town which
he owned. At the approaching town-meeting,
every employee of Mack Baldwin
was warned to vote for locating the
[73]

hall at the West End. At the town-meeting
Baldwin had spotters to take
the names of any of his employees who
voted against him. I was working in
his mill then, but I voted for building the
hall at the Center. Next morning I was
called into the mill-office, where I met
Mack Baldwin and his sons, Zechariah
and David. David is the present Congressman.

âMack Baldwin handed me my pay,
at the same time calling me a vile name.
Now, in those days I had never met a
man who could handle me,ââ

âThey are not plenty, even now,â
said Wycliff, interrupting him.

âPerhaps not; but in those days I
looked at such things in a different light
from what I do now. Since then I have
learned the gospel of forbearance, and
to-day I almost despise mere brute force;
but in those days I did not allow anyone
to call me a vile name, and Mack Baldwin
had scarcely spoken the word when
he lay on the floor at my feet. The two
sons interfered, but they followed their
[74]

father in double-quick time. I had the
three wolves in a heap, in their own den,
in much less time than I am telling you
of it. Then the book-keepers interfered
and followed their employer.â

âBut I was terribly frightened when
I heard of it,â said his wife. âI thought
Phillips would have to go to jail. We
were only engaged then.â

âOf course I was arrested,â continued
Mr. Porter, âand taken before the district
court at Elmfield. Judge Tuttle,
who presided over that court, had been
a colonel in the Union army, and lost a
leg at Gettysburg. He despised Mack
Baldwin, who made a million out of the
governmentâs distress, by gambling in
stocks in Wall Street. The Judge listened
patiently while all the evidence
was given, although there seemed to me
to be a far-away look in his eyes, as if
he were thinking of the days when he
and Captain Wesson were fighting for
the Union, while Mack Baldwin was
making a fortune out of the war at
home.

[75]
ââMack Baldwin,â said the Judge,
âyou discharged the accused because he
did not vote as you ordered him to, did
you not?â Baldwin could not deny it.
âAnd you called him a vile name, to
boot?â continued the Judge. Baldwin
admitted it.

ââDischarged,â thundered Judge Tuttle,
as if he were again giving orders on
the battle-field, and picking up his hat
and cane, he stumped out of the courthouse
to dinner, while there were roars
of applause in the room which he had
left.

âCaptain Wesson was in the courtroom,
so as to go bail for me if necessary,
and I never saw a man more pleased
than he was. He offered me work, if I
wanted, but the girl I had left behind
me, here in the country, didnât want to
live in Papyrus, so I bought this farm,
and I have never been sorry I did so.
We are comfortably off here, and I do
not have to ask how I shall vote. Many
of the mill-hands in Papyrus are little
better than slaves when it comes to voting.
[76]

Under the Australian ballot, they
may vote for the men they prefer for
town-officers, but not for town-appropriations
and other measures, without
making themselves liable to the wrath
of their employers. The Baldwins never
ceased their ancient policy of discharging
and driving out of town, if possible,
any of their workmen who opposed their
policy in town-affairs by voice or vote.â

In the afternoon the entire party of
Porters and Wycliffs drove to Twin
Mountain, near by, there being a wood-road,
almost to the summit, nearly as
good as the average mountain highway.

Sixty miles eastward was Mount Wachusett,
seen to-day very dimly, and
only visible at all in the clearest weather.
Nearer, guarding the Connecticut Valley,
were Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke.

âSay, pop, what mountain is that?
It looks like a pyramid from here.â

âThat is Monadnock. What state is
it in, Robbie?â

âIn New Hampshire,â answered the
boy, proud to exhibit his knowledge of
[77]

the geography of the states hereabouts.

âAnd there, very dim, scarcely more
than a blue line in the west, are the
Catskills and Adirondacks. I donât believe
you remember where they are.â

âSurely I do. What did I go to school
for? They are in New York.â

âAnd that beautiful mountain close by.
Can you tell the name of the highest
mountain in our own state?â

âGreylock, or Saddle Mountain.â

âWe have a view here of portions of
New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire
and Vermont, besides a large portion of
Massachusetts.â

âAnd this mountain-top is to be sold
very cheap,â said Mr. Porter. âMr.
Daniels, the owner, is in California, in
poor health, and has directed me to sell
it for fifteen hundred dollars. There are
three hundred acres in the farm, one
hundred acres being heavy wood and
timber, one hundred and fifty acres pasture,
and fifty acres good tillage land.
The house is comfortable, and the barn
excellent. But I hardly need to tell you,
[78]

as you are familiar with farms about
here. Only for its location, so far from
railroad, it would bring many times the
price asked. As it is, it is the best bargain
I know of. I would be glad to pay
two hundred and fifty dollars for fifty
acres of the pasture, which joins mine,
but I donât want the whole.â

âWhat do you say, ma?â asked Wycliff
of his wife. âItâs the best bargain
Iâve heard of in many a day. Weâre not
obliged to live on it, you know, we can
rent it.â

âBuy it if you think best,â replied his
wife. âWe may be glad to use it for a
summer home, if we are prospered.â

âIâd like to live here the whole year,â
said Robbie. âIt must be fine coasting
here in the winter.â

âWe get snow in July from the Bearâs
Den,â said Mrs. Porter.

âI will take the farm at fifteen hundred
dollars, and you may have the fifty-acre
tract on your own terms,â said Wycliff.

Just then Robbie, who had wandered
[79]

a few rods in advance of the rest of the
party, came running back.

âOh, ma, come quick! Here are some
deer, just like those we used to see on
Mrs. Coltâs grounds, in Hartford. Pop
is right. This is Godâs country, all right.â

Sure enough, there at the foot of the
bluff were a half dozen of the beautiful
creatures.

âThey seem to understand that the
law protects them,â said Mrs. Porter.
âSometimes they come into the barnyard
with the cattle.â

[80]

CHAPTER VII.

âZECHARIAH, I want you to give
Joel Byron his old place in the
mill. I do not approve of discharging
workmen for their politics.â

âI shall do no such thing, Sister Eva.
Byron was not discharged for his politics,
but for attempting to create discontent
among his fellow-workmen.â

âThe petition to the Selectmen, which
Byron circulated, asking for an evening
session of town-meeting, was a perfectly
respectful one, was it not?â

âIf you mean respectful to the Selectmen,âyes;
if you mean respectful to
us,â
no
!â

âHow so?â

âWe, who own the town, ought to say
what its taxes should be. Our employees,
who pay only poll taxes, should not vote
taxes for us to pay. If the appropriations
for town expenses were made at an
evening session, as they are in some
Massachusetts towns, our workmen could
[81]

vote, and load us down with taxes.
Under Massachusetts law, mill-hands
can remain away from their work only

two hours
. This law does not apply to
town-meeting, but we give our workmen
the benefit of it. Our workmen can
come and vote for town-officers by secret
ballot, and get back to the mills
within the two hours. After they are
safely away from town-meeting, and at
work again, we pass the appropriations.â

âYou donât believe in popular government,
then?â

âI donât believe that a man who pays
only two dollars tax, should be the equal
of one who pays ten thousand dollars
taxes, when it comes to voting appropriations.â

âBut what would become of popular
government, and of our free institutions,
if your ideas prevailed?â

âI donât know and I donât care. You
have about as much sense as a hen, Eva,
when it comes to business.â

âHave I? Very well. I have about
as much influence as a hen, if you please,
[82]

in the management of the Baldwin Mills,
although my father left me a two-million-dollar
interest in these mills. Now,
Zechariah, I have been a mere cipher in
this business long enough. There is a
New York gentleman who will gladly
pay me every dollar my interest in the
Baldwin Mills is worth. He will not be
a cipher in the concern as I have been,
and he has opinions of his own as to the
rights of workingmen. He will not see
his employeesâ interests trodden under
foot without uttering a protest which
will be heard, not only throughout the
State, but throughout the Nation.

âI give you fair warning. One week
from to-day, unless you and David make
a fair division of the property with me,
I shall deed my interest in the Baldwin
Mills to the New Yorker. Donât say I
didnât give you fair warning. You will
have a partner, if I sell out, who will be
able to protect both himself and his
workmen. Weâll see whether I have as
much sense as a hen in this business.â

The black eyes snapped fiercely, and
[83]

Eva Baldwin swept out of the room without
giving her brother a chance to reply.
He immediately summoned David home
from Washington. The Congressman
had often made peace between his brother
and sister, but he found it impossible to
patch up any kind of a truce this time.
In vain he made promises.

âYouâve made promises before, David
Baldwin, and then youâve let Zechariah
cheat the workingmen out of their votes
again, just the same as before. Youâre
standing before the country as the workingmanâs
friend, when really you are an
impostor. Some day the country will
find you out. The man who stands by
and sees his workmen defrauded of the
right to vote appropriations for their
own homes, is just as big a villain as the
man who does the dirty work himself.â

These were Eva Baldwinâs plain words.
Only one day was left of her weekâs notice,
and still no agreement.

âYou are not going to carry out your
threat, are you Eva?â asked the Congressman.

[84]
âIt is not a threat. I am simply not
going to be a partner in this iniquity any
longer. If I sell out it will be to a man
who thinks as I do about the workmanâs
rights. Iâm ready to draw the papers.â

âI think it is a bad move, both for you
and for us,â was the brotherâs reply;
âbut you have the advantage of us. Of
course we cannot admit a stranger to
ownership in the Baldwin Mills, so we
make this proposition: Calling your interest
two millions, we will give you the
Liberty Mill, at one and one-half million
dollars, and pay you the balance.â

This offer was accepted and Eva Baldwin
became owner of the Liberty Mill.

Town-meeting day arrived. The movement
for an evening session had apparently
died.

Back of the town-hall was the office of
Ford Hulbert, auctioneer and real estate
agent. On the morning of town-meeting
Hulbertâs front entrance was closed,
locked, and a curtain drawn. In the rear
his office opened upon a long alley running
back to an unfrequented street
[85]

called Back Lane. Had anyone watched
Back Lane that morning from daylight
to ten oâclock, he would have seen an occasional
lonely voter pass quietly along
the street, up the long alley, and into
the rear door of Hulbertâs office. They
did not attract suspicion. One by one
they passed in, like flies into a trap, but
none of them came out.

Ten oâclock came. In the town-hall
less than twenty voters were present,
mostly Baldwin sympathizers. Every
word spoken was heard in Hulbertâs
office.

âThe time has arrived for calling this
meeting to order,â said the town clerk,
who then read the warrant.

âPrepare your ballots for a moderator,â
commanded the Clerk. But now
the rear door opened, and in filed forty
voters from Hulbertâs office. After the
choice of a moderator and a few minor
town-officers, Mr. Hulbert arose and
said:â

âI move that this meeting, except the
balloting for town-officers, be adjourned
[86]

to seven-thirty oâclock this evening.â

âI second the motion,â said John
Wycliff.

A chorus of objections arose from the
Baldwin party.

âQuestion!â shouted Hulbert with his
auctioneerâs lungs. âA motion to adjourn,
Mr. Moderator, is not debatable.â

âQuestion! question! question!â the
forty followers yelled, at the top of their
lungs.

âRight you are; a motion to adjourn
is not debatable,â said the Moderator, as
soon as he could make himself heard.
âYou hear the motion; all in favor of
adjourning this meeting to seven-thirty
oâclock this evening, will signify it by
saying
Aye
; contrary minds,
No
. It is a
vote.â

âDisputed! disputed!â the Baldwin
forces yelled, as they now saw other
voters coming, and hoped for reinforcements
by delay.

âAll in favor of this motion raise your
right hands,â said the Moderator. âI
see forty-two hands. Now all opposed,
[87]

raise your right hands. I see seventeen
hands. The motion is carried. This
meeting is adjourned until seven-thirty
oâclock this evening.â

The trap of Ford Hulbertâs setting had
sprung neatly, and caught the Baldwins
napping. It had been customary to adjourn
until two oâclock, hence the small
number present, and the ease with which
Hulbertâs strategy succeeded. For the
first time in many years the mill-hands
would have a chance to vote on the
money to be spent for their schools, highways,
and other expenses.

At the evening session Zechariah Baldwin
took the floor, and said:

âIt was a mean, contemptible trick to
adjourn town-meeting to this hour. No
decent man would take part in such a
game.â

Ford Hulbert sprang to his feet.

âMr. Moderator: There is
one
gentleman
by the name of Baldwin, whom we
all delight to honor. Let us hear from
our Congressman.â

Amid cheers the Congressman rose
[88]

and said: âI am satisfied with this arrangement
if it meets the popular will.
Let us get to business.â

He was too wise to show the anger
which he felt.

The business of the town-meeting was
marked out by a committee consisting of
all the larger property-owners in the
town, and one common laborer. It was
through this âFinancial Committeeâ
that the Baldwins largely controlled
town-meeting, and the one lonely laborer
showed how lightly they esteemed the
class that had made them wealthy.

To-day the improvement of a certain
street, the home of laborers, was under
discussion. Sheriff Burse, an agent of
the Baldwins, arose, and in a husky
voice, like the whisper of the wind throâ
the pine woods, said that the Financial
Committee did not approve the appropriation.
True, a dozen vehicles had
been overturned on that street recently,
but, according to the Sheriff, it was the
fault of the drivers. The matter was considered
settled, when a sleepy-looking
[89]

little man arose and addressed the Chair.

âUncle Jerry Barnaby,â whispered
the crowd. âThereâll be fun now.â

Uncle Jerry was the wit of the town.
It is hard to define wit. In Uncle Jerryâs
case his appearance had much to do with
the laughter which greeted him. He
was a sad-looking, wild-eyed little man,
whose âlittle body,â as he expressed it,
âwas tired carrying around his big
brain.â

âMr. Moderator.â

âMr. Barnaby.â

âIt is true, as Sheriff Burse has said,
that a man may drive through Hodgson
Street safely. By using great care, by
dodging rocks and sand-banks, and by
the special favor of Divine Providence,
he may live to drive through that street;
but I would advise him, before attempting
it, to place a good big insurance on
his life, and to kiss his wife and children
farewell. As has been said, Mr. Moderator,
a man may drive through Hodgson
street safely; a perfectly sober man
may drive through a wood-lot, butââ

[90]
In the uproar which followed, Uncle
Jerry never finished his sentence. It
was voted to repair Hodgson Street.

The secret balloting, during the day,
elected Hugh Maxwell Selectman, and
the Baldwins failed in their efforts to
force Jacob Sharp upon the voters.

There was a proposition to increase
the pay of the police from two dollars to
two dollars and a half per night. There
was much opposition to the increase, its
general drift being that the policemen
were already well paid, when Uncle Jerry
was again recognized by the Moderator.
Congressman Baldwin frowned, and a
reflection of his frown was seen upon
the face of the Moderator, who was
obliged to recognize the mirth-provoking
Barnaby.

He immediately began a somewhat
rambling oration, which he had been
declaiming in his own house for weeks,
and which was intended to set forth the
faithful services of the policemen. The
audience was soon convulsed with laughter,
and it was impossible for the Moderator
[91]

to check him, as almost everybody
in the hall was encouraging him by
laughter and applause.

Uncle Jerry was thoroughly in earnest.
He could see no occasion for mirth.

âWhen all sounds of industry are
stilled,â said Uncle Jerry, âwhen the
fond mother lies asleep with the darling
babe on her bosom,ââ

âSpeak on the question, Mr. Barnaby!â
roared the Moderator.

âI am speaking on the question, Mr.
Moderatorâwhen the demon tongues of
fire leap up in the basement, and threaten
your lovely home, threaten to envelop in
their horrible embrace all that you hold
dearest on earth,âthat fond wife and
loving mother and that darling infant on
the motherâs breast,ââ

âCome to the point, Mr. Barnaby!â

âI am coming to the point, Mr. Moderator,
just as fast as I can, but you
make me lose my place. When the devouring
flames, Mr. Moderator, threaten
to embrace that fond wife and loving
mother and darling infant on the motherâs
[92]

breast,âit is the watchful eye of the
vigilant policeman, Mr. Moderatorâ,â

The allusion to the âvigilant policemenâ
of Papyrus was the last straw.
The audience reveled in such a fit of uncontrolled
laughter that Uncle Jerry
never proceeded further. Meanwhile
the friends of the policemen thought it
a favorable time to take a vote.

âQuestion!â shouted one.

âQuestion!â echoed a hundred. The
policemen won.

The most important question taken up
was that of a sewer. Physicians and
others testified to the wretched sanitary
conditions which made Papyrus one of
the most unhealthy towns in the state,
for the lack of a sewer. Deacon Surface,
the most adroit speaker in Papyrus,
answered them. He said that the
taxes were too high. At the proper
time the âmen who owned the townâ
would be ready for a sewer, but not yet.
He omitted to say that the Baldwins
paid taxes on less than half the true
value of their property in Papyrus. He
[93]

omitted to say, also, that the Baldwins
had recently given to the city of Elmfield,
for something much less needed
than a sewer, a larger sum than it would
cost to build several sewer-systems for
Papyrus. The Deaconâs speech was eloquent,
polished, and well-roundedâa
beautiful bubble, needing only the pinpoint
of truth to explode it. Ford Hulbert
was just thinking it his duty to apply
the pin to the bubble, when the irrepressible
Barnaby rose.

âMr. Moderator,â piped the wild-eyed
little man.

âMr. Barnaby,â groaned the Moderator.

âMr. Moderator. I want to congratulate
Deacon Surface on making the most
eloquent speech I have ever heard in this
hall. Among all the facts which he
gave us, it is strange that he overlooked
one factâone cold, scientific truthâbearing
on the question.â

âWhat is it?â asked a hundred voices.
Even Deacon Surface arose, turned toward
Uncle Jerry, and joined in the question.
[94]

Then, when you could have heard
a pin drop, and the silence was becoming
oppressive, the piping voice said:â

âOne cold, scientific fact, Mr. Moderator,
just as true as the facts he gave
us,âthe moon is made of green cheese,
Mr. Moderator.â

Deacon Surface collapsed with his bubble
argument, while the audience went
wild. But the sewer was lost. The employees
of Zechariah and David Baldwin,
in a matter involving so large an outlay,
dared not openly vote against their masters.

Not until we have the secret ballot for
measures, as well as for men, will there
be political freedom in Massachusetts
towns.

[95]

CHAPTER VIII.

JOHN WYCLIFFâS den had become
well known as a resort for workingmen,
and people in other walks of life
were occasionally to be found in consultation
with him. Ford Hulbert, a real
estate and insurance agent, was an occasional
caller.

âYou knew Wells Boardman, who was
recently killed in an accident on the Papyrus
Electric Street Railway?â asked
Hulbert.

âYes, very well; an old neighbor
when we lived out in the country. His
daughter, Lena, was one of the best girls
I ever met. Her laugh would do one
more good than medicine sometimes. A
half hour with her was a sure cure for
the blues.â

âI donât need to tell you much about
her, then.â

âNo, you do not. I have known her
from the cradle up. A better girl or
woman was never raised on the hills.
[96]

She was a rollicking, laughing, singing
sunbeam, and never a thought of wrong in
it all. Many a heart has been tangled
in those brown curls of hers, though. It
seems strange to me now, as I look back,
that I was not one of the victims; but,
then, we were too much like a sister and
brother for that.â

There was a pause, broken by Mr. Hulbert.

âShe made an early and unfortunate
marriage, I believe?â

âYes; she left the hills, and came
down into this dull valley. She brought
the sparkle of the mountain brook, and
the melody of the bobolinks with her.
Wherever she went there was a ripple of
laughter, a burst of sunshine, a peal of
music. Such a girl could not be without
admirers. She had plenty of them.
And then,âwhat did she do? Deliberately
picked out the worst one in the
whole lot,âa drunken libertine, a man
with whom scarcely any other respectable
woman would be seen crossing the
street.â

[97]
âWhy did she do it?â

âI cannot tell. Some thought it was
because he had more money than her
other admirers, but that may have been
unjust to her. Whatever the reason,
she had plenty of reason to regret her
decision when it was too late.â

âAnd then?â queried Hulbert, as Wycliff
remained silent for several minutes,
and showed no disposition to resume the
conversation.

âJust what might have been expected.
The scoundrel cared nothing for her and
was soon running after other women,
just as though he had no wife, to whom
he had vowed fidelity. They had children,âtwo
of them, and she remained
several years for her childrenâs sake.
But it became more than flesh and blood
could endure. He was continually abusing
her, in the hope that she would leave
him. When I was a boy I heard of a
man who turned his son out of doors,
and then whipped him for leaving home.
Lenaâs husband was just about as consistent
as that. He treated her so contemptibly,
[98]

that if she had not left him,
she must have gone crazy. Then he
said that his wife âcould not have had
much love for the children, else she
would not have left them;ââthe lying
wretch. I have lived in places where he
would have had a coat of tar and feathers.â

âAnd then?â pursued Mr. Hulbert,
who seemed anxious to have Wycliff continue.

âWell, not exactly what the villain
had been planning for. He expected to
secure a divorce for desertion, and to
marry another woman who had attracted
his wandering affections, but his wife
secured the divorce, and the care of the
children.â

âAnd now,â said Hulbert, in a low
tone of voice, âan honest man who actually
loves her, will find it very difficult
to convince her of his loyalty to her.â

Wycliff glanced up quickly.

âYou are an admirer of Lena?â

âYes, but we had a break. We had a
falling-out the evening you left Beauna
[99]

Vista. We were watering our horses,
sheltered from your sight by the hemlock
bushes. I made a remark about Mr.
Sharp, in connection with the church,
which offended her.â

âYes, she is very loyal to the church;
but the church has hardly kept its
pledges to her in her trouble. I did not
know that there were any disinterested
witnesses of my difference with Sharp,
else I might have proceeded differently.â

âBut now I must do my errand,â resumed
Hulbert. âI came to see you because
Miss Boardman could not come,
and she wishes your advice. Zechariah
Baldwin, for the Papyrus Electric Street
Railway Company, has offered her three
thousand dollars in settlement for her
fatherâs death.â

âThe company acknowledges its liability,
then?â

âYes; the only question is as to the
amount which shall be paid.â

âIsnât Congressman Baldwin a stockholder
in the company?â

âYes; he is the heaviest stockholder.â

[100]
âOf course, you know that the State
of Massachusetts, some years ago, obeying
the demands of the railroad corporations,
which were killing a great many
people, made a law that not more than
five thousand dollars could be collected
for a human life, lost through the fault
of a railroad corporation. Itâs an infamous
law, but itâs there, all the same.â

âMiss Boardman wants your advice
as to whether she shall accept the three
thousand dollars.â

âHas she called upon Congressman
Baldwin?â

âNo, and she will not do so. She has
too much independence for that. She
will not go to him.â

âTell Lena not to be in a hurry, to
wait a few days, and I will see if I can
do anything for her.â

âAll right; if you can help her any she
will do the fair thing by you. She ought
to receive much more than they offer
her. Good night.â

Wycliff sat alone some time after his
visitor had gone, looking into the fire,
[101]

and thinking of many things. One of
his long-cherished idols had been gradually
dethroned. He had been, before
coming to Papyrus, a great admirer of
Congressman Baldwin. It was hard for
him to give up his political idol, but he
had seen the workingmen of Papyrus
defrauded of their votes, and Congressman
Baldwin a silent and satisfied witness
of the robbery. One word from
Congressman Baldwin, who was the political
boss of the State, would have
blotted from the statute books of Massachusetts
the damnable âFive-Thousand-Dollar
Law;â but Congressman Baldwin
never spoke the word. Instead,
his puppets at Boston voted to retain
the law, which shielded railroad and
street railway corporations from just
punishment for deaths caused by them,
and robbed families of their victims.
Wycliff himself, by David Baldwinâs orders,
had been blacklisted in all the Baldwin
industries. The spotless Deacon
Surface had notified every concern controlled
by the Baldwins not to give employment
[102]

to John Wycliff. This was
more than his idolatry would bear. A
man will forgive many things, but ought
he to forgive the man who tries to take
the bread away from his family?

John Wycliff looked up at the face of
Congressman Baldwin, on the wall opposite.
He arose and took down the portrait.

âWhat on earth are you doing, John?â
asked his wife, summoned from another
room by the noise of breaking glass and
splintering wood.

Bare feet came pattering down the
stairs from the chamber above.

âSay, pop; whatâs up?â

âRobbie, what did the Israelites do
every time they got a chance? What
did the Lord have to punish them for,
very often?â

âWorshipping idols.â

âAnd once in a while, after being punished
enough, what would they do?â

âBurn up their idols.â

âThatâs right. Thatâs what Iâve been
doing. Now Iâll kiss you both if youâll
[103]

clear out, and leave me alone, to write.â

He then wrote a letter to an old friend
and schoolmate, now an editor in Charleston,
South Carolina. From that letter
the following is extract taken:â

âYou have frequently requested me
to write something for your paper, a request
which I have been very slow to
comply with. I do not suppose you wish
me to write your editorials, and the enclosed
article is only intended as a hint
of the way in which I would use the facts
referred to.â

Within a week the whole country
echoed with the first public attack ever
made upon Congressman Baldwin. The
attack was made by a Charleston, South
Carolina, newspaper, and every political
paper in the country was immediately
drawn into the combat, either as an assailant
or defender of the Congressman.
Congressman Baldwin in a public speech,
had commented bitterly upon the cheapness
of human life in the South; and
now every Southern newspaper, and
many of their Northern sympathizers,
were revenged upon him. The following
[104]

paragraphs from the Charleston paper
formed the key-note of their attack:â

âWe have listened, and so has the
rest of the country, while this immaculate
and infallible Baldwin upbraided us
for the cheapness of a human life in the
South. What is the value of human life
in Congressman Baldwinâs own model
town of Papyrus, in the model state of
Massachusetts? Congressman Baldwinâs
trolley company takes the life of a man
earning fifteen hundred dollars a year,
and in full payment for that life, it offers
the victimâs family three thousand dollars.
The Savings Banks offer the safest
investment for widows and orphans.
Should they accept, they would receive
from the savings bank, at three and a
half per cent.,âone hundred and five
dollars a year.

âTo sum up the case: Congressman
Baldwinâs railway takes a life worth fifteen
hundred dollars a year to the victimâs
family, and offers that family one
hundred and five dollars a year in full
settlement. And yet Congressman Baldwin
says that human life is cheap,âin
the South. Under Massachusetts law a
railway company cannot be obliged to
pay more than five thousand dollars for
[105]

taking a human life, while under a just
law, like that of New York, a railroad
corporation has been compelled to pay
one hundred thousand dollars for a human
life, lost through its negligence. A
jury awarded that sum against the New
York Central for a victim of the Park
Avenue tunnel disaster of 1902.

âCongressman Baldwin is the political
boss of his state, and responsible for that
law which says to all the world that Massachusetts
has no man whose life is worth
more than five thousand dollars. Yet
South Carolina once had slaves whose
masters would not part with them for
that sum. The explanation is simple.
Baldwin has millions in railroads.

âOne more item and we are done.
Baldwin and other Massachusetts statesmen
declaim loudly against negro disfranchisement
in the South: âConsistency
is a jewel.â Baldwinâs own mill-hands
cannot vote on town-appropriations.
Under the Massachusetts law
they must stay in the mills and add to
the Baldwin millions, while he âruns the
town.â Southerners say the black man
is not fit to run the State. Baldwin of
Massachusetts says his white mill-hands
are not fit to run the Town. And he has
Massachusetts law with him. âPeople
[106]

who live in glass houses should not throw
stones.ââ

For weeks David Baldwin was the recipient
of more unfriendly criticism than
any other public man in Washington.
The humble cause of all this trouble
rolled his one gray eye, saying:â

âBlacklist me again for telling the
truth, will you? Shut your eyes again,
while your workmenâs votes are stolen,
Dave Baldwin!â

Long before the battle was over the
Congressman became very weary of it,
and sent the following directions to
his brother, Zechariah:â

âPay Wells Boardmanâs daughter
twenty thousand dollars. Charge five
thousand dollars to Papyrus Electric
Railway, and balance to me.â

The news of this generous payment
was spread throughout the country, and
took the edge off the criticism of Baldwin.

âIs that you, Lena?â asked Mrs. Wycliff,
one evening.

âI think it is,â was the answer.
[107]

âHereâs a check for a thousand dollars,
for your husband. Tell him he has
earned it. I have said all along that
John could make the Baldwins toe the
mark. He is almost the only one about
here who is not afraid of them, and he is
the only one who hits them in the only
place where they feel it,âin the newspapers.
They donât care anything about
right and wrong, God, man or the devil,
but they donât like to have their injustice
shown up in the newspapers, or in
the courts. They donât fear God, or His
Word, or the Judgment Day, but they
are afraid of newspapers and courts. I
donât care for the twenty thousand dollars
myself, but with the income from it
I can give my boys a good education.
Tell John I hear that Zack Baldwin will
give a thousand dollars to get him out of
town. This thousand is for him to
stay.â

[108]

CHAPTER IX.

A FREQUENT caller at the Wycliff
home was âUncle Jerryâ Barnaby.
He was always welcome, being
an old friend, the acquaintance between
the two families dating back to the time
when both occupied farms in Sprucemontâthe
little hill-town, richer in broad
views and fresh air than in salable commodities.

âOh, I was a king, then!â said Uncle
Jerry. âOnly think of those beautiful
fields of grass and grain that I used to
have.â

âAnd how much labor you spent in
getting out the rocks and improving the
land, before you could have those crops,â
replied Mrs. Wycliff.

âYes, I was the first farmer in all
that region to use dynamite, both on my
farm and on the highways. Oh, I was a
king then; king of my own farm, anyway.
And now I am a slave to these
sleek villains, the Baldwins. The tears
[109]

come to my eyes whenever I think of
those old times; and of those sleek cattle
that had been petted so much by my
wife and the girls that it seemed like
sacrilege to sell them; they seemed to
belong to the family.â And Uncle Jerry
burst into tears at his own recital of
former glories.

âTo think that I should have come to
this,â exclaimed Uncle Jerry. âTo be
a slave,âa poor, despised, down-trodden
slave for the Baldwins,âand I used to
be a king of two hundred acres in Sprucemont.

âAnd those colts, the beautiful creatures.
When I went into the pasture
they would come up to me and lay their
noses on my cheeks, and almost talk to
me. How many colts I have raised to
be fine horses, and sold for good prices,
and my wife and daughters could always
ride anywhere they chose, and to-dayââ
and Uncle Jerry could not proceed for
some minutes for sobbing.

âTo-day,â he continued, at length,
âMy poor dear girl is pining away for
[110]

the fresh air. I heard yesterday that
Zack Baldwin had an old horse that he
was going to kill. I might have known
that I would be refused, but I was thinking
only of my poor dear girl, and I
went and begged him to let me have the
old horse. I promised him it should
never do anything but draw the poor
girl the little way she is able to ride.â

âDidnât he let you have it?â asked
Mrs. Wycliff, full of sympathy.

âOf course not. It wouldnât make
any big sound, you know, like giving a
half a million dollars to a library. It
might, possibly, have saved my daughterâs
life. He ordered the horse taken
out and shot before my eyes. I felt as
if those shots sounded my daughterâs
doom. I might have known that a man
who would discharge me for getting the
policemenâs pay raised, would refuse me
an old horse which might save my daughterâs
life.â

âDid he discharge you for that?â

âSurely. He came to me after town-meeting,
and said:ââA man who works
[111]

against my interests in town-meeting
will never get another dayâs work from
me. I have no use for such men as you
and Wycliff. He got offended at me
once before. It was a year ago. Fifty
of us were making a lawn for him. He
paid us only a dollar and a half a day,
although everybody else about here was
paying a dollar and three-quarters for
that kind of work. I circulated a petition,
which most of the workmen signed,
asking for one dollar and seventy-five
cents per day, and presented the petition
to Zack Baldwin. He finally agreed to
split the difference with us, and pay us a
dollar and sixty-two and a half cents a
day, but he was revenged on us. Those
who refused to sign the petition were
given work much longer than the rest.
That is the Baldwin brand of Christianity,âpaying
lower wages than other employers
pay, and discharging those who ask
for fair wages; and at the same time
making princely gifts to public libraries
and other institutions. It was because
outside work was dull, just then, that
[112]

Zack Baldwin took advantage of us, to
get our work at less than market price.ââ

âBut I thought,â said Mrs. Wycliff,
âthat Zechariah and David Baldwin
were in company.â

âThey are,âin the mills. Congressman
Baldwin isnât a bit better than Old
Zack, the old Shylock. The man who
shuts his eyes to tyranny isnât a bit better
than the tyrant. Since town-meeting
Iâve had to walk three miles up to
the Wendell Farm, for work. These
little hands were not made for handling
heavy stone.â And he exhibited a pair
of hands almost as small and fine as a
ladyâs.

âYou look like a light and feeble man
to walk six miles and handle stone all
day, and you must be getting a little too
old for hard work. How old are you,
Uncle Jerry?â

âI canât tell. Iâve even written back
to the old country,âI was born in Ireland,âand
tried to find out, but I think
the records must have been destroyed.
I could not get any information about it.
[113]

I can remember once shaking hands with
Abraham Lincoln, in the city of Hartford.
That is a landmark in my life. I
was grown up then and able to do a
manâs work.â

John Wycliff arose, took down a volume
from his bookcase, and examined it
a moment.

âLincoln was in Hartford on the fifth
day of March, 1860, and, I think, never
at any other time. Very likely you are
about sixty-five years old now.â

âWhat is the matter with your daughter?â
asked Mrs. Wycliff.

âI cannot tell you, because the doctors
cannot tell me. It seems to be a
sort of melancholy.â

âWhat caused it?â

âWell, thereâs a point I donât like to
speak of.â

âDonât mention it, then. Please forgive
me for asking.â

âAfter all, it doesnât matter, seeing
there are no strangers here;â and Uncle
Jerry lowered his voice and looked inquiringly
toward the doors.

[114]
âThere is no one except ourselves
within hearing,â said Mrs. Wycliff, reassuringly.

âIt was years ago, but after you left
the hills,â continued Uncle Jerry, in a
low voice. âPet,âthatâs what we called
her,âwas gay as a bird till then. Pet
got acquainted with a fine young man up
in the country,âa fine fellow he was
every way. Iâd say that if âtwas the
last thing I was to say in this world.
Never a likelier fellow ever grew up on
the hills, if I do say it. Well, he took a
liking to our Pet, and I guess there was
as much love on Petâs part as on his.â

Uncle Jerry paused. After a little Mrs.
Wycliff ventured to ask:

âWhy didnât they marry?â

âWell, you see,ââ and Uncle Jerryâs
voice dropped lower still. âI said he was
as fine a fellow as ever grew up on the
hills, and I wouldnât take it back if it
was to be the last thing I ever said, butâhe
was a Protestant.â Uncle Jerry
was silent a few moments.

âLooking back now, it seems to me
[115]

that we were both, Petâs mother and I,
willing to ruin Pet for life rather than
have her marry a Protestant. While I
cannot say positively that this is the reason
for Petâs long sickness, yet of one
thing I am certainâshe has not been
like her former self since that time.â

âBut what became of him?â

âHe went away, to the West it was
believed. No one on the hills, so far as
I know, has heard from him since. But
this whole subject is one which I do not
like to think about, much less talk about.
I have learned one lesson, and a pretty
costly one,âwhen God has taught two
persons to love one another no one should
be guilty of keeping them apart.â

âAnd here am I,â continued Uncle
Jerry piteously, âSixty-five years old, at
least, discharged by those sleek villains,
the Baldwins, because I dared to champion
the policemen, and obliged to walk
six miles a day to work, and then,âonly
think of it,âthis slender body and these
weak hands to build stone wall all day.
The only work I can get to do with these
[116]

little hands is to lift and tug at heavy
stone all day. Merciful God! What
shall I do? I canât stand this work a
great while. My back is almost broken.
These thin arms are as sore as boils.
These little hands are covered with
blisters. And my poor, dear girl pining
for the fresh air. That horse that Zack
Baldwin ordered shot to-day, might have
saved my daughterâs life. What does
he care? He will kill me, in time, too,
for I canât walk six miles and build stone
wall all day, and follow it up a great
while.â And Uncle Jerry paced the
floor in agony, his face drawn and white,
and wringing his small, thin hands.

âYou have a fine house, Uncle Jerry,â
said Mrs. Wycliff.

âYes; but we canât eat or drink it, or
if we could, how long would it last? If
I began to use up the value of my home
how long would it be before I should be
âon the town?ââ

âBut I mean could you not rent furnished
rooms?â

âNo; Pet is so nervous I can hardly
[117]

live with her myself, much less have
strangers in the same house with her.
We try to economize, but economy is
difficult to practice with sickness. There
is only one thing I can do. I must sell
my place, and buy a little farm back in
the country again. I was born under
king-rule. I am not going to die under
it.â

âBut you are not able to do the work
on a farm,â protested Mrs. Wycliff, âor
even if you are able to do it to-day you
will not be able to do it long. Your wife
and daughters used to help you a great
deal on the farm. They are not able to
do it now. I think I know of a better
arrangement.â

âWhat is it?â asked Uncle Jerry,
much as a drowning man might grasp at
a straw.

âYou have a good house, which would
bring you in a large rent. Then you
could get a job at superintending a small
farm. You would not need to work,
yourself, any more than you felt able
to.â

[118]
âWho would give old Jerry Barnaby
a job as a farm boss, especially when he
could not get a recommend from the
Baldwins? Donât try to fool a poor old
man. Itâs cruel, and besides it isnât like
you, either, John Wycliff.â And Uncle
Jerry looked reproachfully at the younger
man.

âItâs no fooling, Uncle Jerry,â said
Wycliff rising, and placing his hands on
Barnabyâs shoulders. âDo you know
the Twin Mountain Farm?â

âEvery rod of it.â

âNow, if you are not too steep with
your price, you can take charge of that
farm. You will have your fuel, vegetables,
meat, maple sugarâindeed, most
of your living off the farm. You will
not need a very big cash salary, along
with your rent, to take care of you and
your family in good shape, and your wife
and daughter will have a horse to drive
whenever they wish.â

âWho owns the place?â asked Barnaby.

âA one-eyed crank named Wycliff.â

[119]
âDo you own that place? Well, we
shanât have any trouble about the price,
if you think I can fill the bill.â

âYes, yes, Uncle Jerry. Come around
in the morning and we will make a bargain
in five minutes. Then we will drive
off and buy stock and tools.â

âVery well. I must get home and
tell Pet and her mother. We are willing
to shake the dust of Papyrus off our feet
any day.â

[120]

CHAPTER X.

EVA BALDWIN was the most independent,
the most democratic, and
the most religious member of the Baldwin
family. I use the word religious in
its most practical sense. The Baldwins
were all religious; they were all church-members;
they all had the outside, the
husk, the wrapper, of religion. With
them, a costly house of worship, a silver-tongued
preacher, the repetition of some
high-sounding passages from Godâs Word
and the payment of a certain amount of
money for church expensesâthese things
constituted religion.

The Baldwins, when it came to religion,
were like a certain boy, who went
chestnutting. He had never seen a
chestnut, and he eagerly filled his basket
with the great prickly burs, which
the frost had opened, but never noticed
the nuts themselves, which lay hidden
under the leaves.

The Baldwins were very religious,âbut
[121]

if the Christ had come into Papyrus,
the town which belonged to them, they
would have given Him twenty-four hours
notice to get out. He was a disturber in
the vales of Judea, and He would have
been too radical for the Lords of the
Berkshire Hills. It would have become
the painful duty of the round and sleek
Deacon Surface, and the gaunt and
spectral Sheriff Burse, on notice from
the Baldwins, to order Him out.

But Evaâblack-eyed Evaâdiffered
from her kindred. She was not satisfied
with the husk of Christianity. She was
a constant thorn in the side of her
brother, Zechariah, and in a less degree
of her brother, David, the Congressman.
Even between these two there was a
great gulf. The Congressman believed
in equal rights, except at home, and for
his own workmen. None of the devices,
some of them of almost Satanic ingenuity,
by which the mill-hands of Papyrus
were prevented from enjoying their
just share in town-government, none of
these devices, I say, could have succeeded,
[122]

without Congressman Baldwinâs
approval, through his confidential agent,
the hundred-faced, oily-tongued Deacon
Surface. None of these devices for
stealing the workmanâs vote won Eva
Baldwinâs approval.

In lookingâand she had not far to
lookâfor worthy objects upon which to
bestow her help, in a practical and sensible
way, Eva Baldwin had long since
found in Sprucemont, that little âdeserted
townâ on the mountain-tops, an
outlet for some of her benevolent impulses
and surplus funds. A few generations
ago Sprucemont had been one of
the most prosperous towns on the hills,
but influences which it would take too
long to describe here had brought her very
low, both in population and wealth.
The church in Sprucemont had long since
ceased to be self-supporting, and was
dependent upon the generosity of Eva
Baldwin and others of her kind.

To awaken the interest of natives of
the town who had removed, to stir the
pride of those remaining, and to attract
[123]

buyers for the abandoned farms, a celebration
was planned in honor of the
townâs settlement. For such an occasion
it was only natural that the most distinguished
native of the town, Reverend
Ralph Cutter, filling a pulpit in Springdale,
should be selected as the principal
speaker.

The day came. Up the long hills toward
Sprucemont Center climbed teams
and vehicles of various descriptions. The
newest automobile, the stylish and luxurious
up-to-date carriage with liveried
driver and sleek, well-groomed pair, and
the pleasure-seekerâs four-horse tally-ho,
these shared the mountain road with ancient
specimens of the carriage-makersâ
art, broken and repaired with conspicuous
lack of skill, and drawn by animals
to whom the currycomb and oat-bin
seemed alike strangers. Between these
extremes were the comfortable and tidy
conveyances of the middle classes.

It was a perfect June day. The rock
maples, the red beeches and the various
birches were in their full summer luxuriance,
[124]

and their light green foliage contrasted
prettily with the darker, more
somber shades of the spruce, the hemlock,
and the balsam fir. The verdure
of mowlands and pastures was sprinkled
with the commonplace buttercups and
daisies, while the roadside thickets were
eloquent to the eye with the pink and
white blossoms of the mountain laurel.

The forests echoed with the silver bell
of the wood thrush, while the rollicking,
bubbling melody of the bobolink, and the
clear, sweet whistle of the meadow lark
filled every wayside field.

The ancient meeting-house, where the
services were held, was a fine specimen
of old style, country church architecture.
It had been built, nearly a century before,
to accommodate eight hundred people,
but the population of the town,
had dwindled to half that number.

âThe strength of the hills is His also.â

It was with these words of the Psalmist
that Reverend Ralph Cutter began
his review of the townâs history. No
one seemed to realize that he spoke an
[125]

hour. A library has been written about
the best way to hold the attention of an
audience. It might all be boiled down
to this:ââHave something to say worth
saying, and then say it in a way worth
hearing.â Ralph Cutter knew his subject
thoroughly. He could only give an outline
of it in the time allotted to him; but,
as little ten-year-old Jimmy Stetson said,
âWhen Mr. Cutter tells an Indian story
you feel as though the Red Skins were
skulking around the church, and when
he talks about bears you almost expect
to hear âem growl.â

âAunt Lyddyâ Buxton, who came
early and had a seat near the pulpit,
said:ââThatâs the first time I have
heard a minister in a year, although I
go to church every Sunday. Thank
God thereâs now and then a minister
who thinks it a part of his duty to make
people hear.â

âThatâs the minister I always like to
hear,â said Farmer Gray. âI donât
have to go to a dictionary to find out
what he means, and itâs all good, sober,
[126]

solid sense, every word he has to say.â

The speaker did not occupy a minute
more than the time allotted to him. For
a minister, or any other speaker, to take
time which belonged to others, Ralph
Cutter considered no better than any
other kind of stealing, and he never
practiced it. He always kept within his
allotted time. He had saved a few minutes
in which to consider the future of
the town.

âEvery valley shall be exalted, and
every mountain and every hill shall be
made low.â

âI understand these words of Isaiah,â
he said, âto be prophecy full of blessing
to us all. These hills shall be brought
lowâthat is to say, they shall be more
easily reached. Not only this, but the
working people in the cities shall be able
to reach them. The time is coming,
when the poorest one of our millions of
laborers shall be able to enjoy a summer
vacation, with his family, on these hills,
or at the sea-shore, or wherever else on
Godâs beautiful earth he chooses to spend
[127]

it. The multitudes, now scarcely earning
their daily bread, shall not always
toil to maintain the few in idleness and
luxury. The good things, the best things
of Godâs bountiful earth shall be within
reach of the toiling masses, not occasionally
and sparingly, but at all times and
in generous measure. The workman
shall enjoy the full fruit of his labors.
There shall be no idlers, as now, to fatten
upon the laborersâ toil. God has provided
an abundance for all His children,
and the avarice of the few shall not always
keep his gifts away from the many.

âPerhaps you will call this socialism,
but it is Christianity also. I believe, in
practice, we have scarcely learned the
a b c of Christianity. I am not attacking
the rights of property. I have no
pet theories to advance. The present
system, which allows one man to pile up
hundreds of millions by getting control
of steel or oil, while the working multitude
are little better than slavesâthis
system, I say, cannot endure. It must
fall. When we have learned, by experience,
[128]

what true Christianity means, it
may be that we shall get back very near
to the starting-point of Christianity,
when the disciples had all things common.

âEvery mountain and hill shall be
brought lowâbrought within reach of
the toiling hosts of the valley. All these
abandoned acres shall be tilled again.
This temple shall again be filled with
glad worshippers, as of old. The electric
railway, which is leveling the hills
everywhere, shall bring to these beautiful
heights the tired and dusty dwellers
in the city, for summer rest. This leveling
process shall benefit the dwellers and
toilers in the vales. Already the farm-house
feels the throbbing life of the
city, through the telephone and the
daily mail. This is only the beginning.
No one knows what the end may be.â

It was an eloquent address; eloquent
in its pictures of history; eloquent in its
present comfort; eloquent in its promise
for the future, and it had a fitting and
appreciative word for those outside the
[129]

town who had kept the fires of religion
burning on this ancient altar. It had
none of the marks of much of our present
oratoryâno foreign phrases; no
words difficult to understand; no carefully
poised periods; no words dropped
nearly to a whisper. The prize pupil in
elocution sometimes cannot be heard in
the rear of the hall, while the speaker
who makes himself clearly heard in all
parts of the house goes home without
even honorable mention. While mere
noise is not oratory, yet Daniel Webster,
Charles Sumner and George William
Curtis always made themselves heard.
The speakerâs concluding words were:â

âLet us be true to the God of our fathers,
and the God of our fathers shall
bless us.â

There was not a more interested listener
than Eva Baldwin. All the old
feeling which she had experienced during
the speakerâs stay in Papyrus, and
which she had tried to suppress since,
came rushing back. She thought:
âWhy could not God have given to me
[130]

to be the help-meet of such a man, even
if He gave my millions to some one
else?â

As for Ralph Cutter, he had been unjust
to Miss Baldwin in allowing her
wealth to place a barrier between them.
The sight of her to-day fanned into
flame again the old fires of his admiration,
and he more than half resolved to
seek an opportunity of renewing her
acquaintance.

After the exercises, which closed early,
several small parties visited Twin Mountain,
which was near by. One of the
parties included Reverend Ralph Cutter
and another included the Baldwins.
For a moment, and only for a moment,
the parties met. The minister and the
heiress saluted each other cordially and
lingered after their parties had separated.
She expressed regret that he had
left Papyrus. He expressed regret that
it had seemed best for him to leave, and
then, something in her eyes seeming to
warrant it, he added:

âI had hoped to become better acquainted
[131]

with you, had I remained.â

âDid I place any obstacles in the way
of our further acquaintance? I certainly
did not intend to do so,â she replied,
and there was no mistaking the frank,
honest meaning in the black eyes.

âNo, you did not. May I correspond
with you?â

âCertainly.â She was laughing now;
a laugh of relief and pleasure. âBut do
not forget, when circumstances permit,
that a face to face meeting is a long way
ahead of a letter.â

But the parties to which they belonged
were getting farther and farther apart.

âYou might return home with us,â she
suggested. âYou could take an evening
train for Springdale.â And he very
gladly assented.

[132]

CHAPTER XI.

IT would be unjust in this narrative to
class David Baldwin, the Congressman,
with his brother, Zechariah. David
meant to be just. Whatever of justice
there was in the relations of the Baldwins
to their workmen was usually credited
by the workmen to Congressman
Baldwin, and probably they were right.
Such reforms as had been granted in the
mills had usually been secured by appealing
from Zechariah, the resident manager,
to David, whose public duties kept
him much of the time in Washington.
David Baldwin was generous. If there
was anything of the âmilk of human
kindnessâ in the treatment of the Baldwin
workmen it was due largely to
David.

Zechariah Baldwin was generous when
he thought his generosity would make
a big display, and be heralded in the
public press. In the church and in the
press, especially the religious press, the
[133]

name of Zechariah Baldwin was acclaimed
loudly as a philanthropist. In
private circles, particularly among his
own workmen, in those small circles
where the laborer dared to speak his
honest feelings, he was oftener spoken
of as a âskinflint,â or simply a âskin,â
a term in common use which is full of
meaning, and that not of the best kind.
Zechariah Baldwin was the last to raise
the wages of his help and the first to cut
them down.

David Baldwin was rarely known,
where the decision lay with himself
alone, to refuse any reasonable request
of a workingman. While his public
gifts were not as large, nor trumpeted
as loudly as his brotherâs, still, the unfortunate
employee or neighbor who
needed help, knew where to get it. But
David was absent much of the time,
either in Washington, performing his
official duties as Congressman, or attending
to large financial interests outside of
Papyrus. Hence it happened that Zechariah
Baldwin was usually the boss of
[134]

Papyrus and political independence was
not tolerated among the workmen. Few
workingmen had ever remained long in
Papyrus after showing in any way their
independence of the Baldwins.

Zechariah Baldwin defended the position
of the paper manufacturers in this
way:

âWe have built up the town; we own
it and we claim the moral right to drive
out of it any man who is offensive to us.
That one-eyed Wycliff is a mischief-maker
and trouble-breeder and he has
got to get out.â

But Wycliff did not get out. He did
not even promise to get out. He seemed
to have no intention of getting out. The
methods which usually succeeded in driving
a workingman out of townâblacklisting
him in all the Baldwin industries
and warning other employers not to hire
himâthese methods had failed utterly in
the case of John Wycliff.

âWe cannot tolerate him much
longer,â said Zack Baldwin. Certainly
not. Where one workingman
[135]

dares to do his own thinking and to express
his own opinions there is danger
that others will catch the distemper.
What if they should form a union and
demand the same wages paid elsewhere
for the same work? Such a thing was
not to be thought of for an instant.

âWe must fight the devil with fire,â
said Zack Baldwin. Accordingly he
offered a few Papyrus roughs a large
sum if they would drive Wycliff out of
town. He was not particular as to the
means employed, so long as they avoided
publicity and arrest. Zack Baldwinâs
own son, Jehu, might be classed with
other Papyrus roughs, in spite of a thin
veneer of polished manners, which high
society and the schools had given him.
It is highly probable that the means employed
to rid the town of Wycliff might
have been violent but for an unexpected
incident.

Zechariah Baldwin met an old acquaintance
from the West at the Taconic
House, the only hotel in Papyrus, and, of
course, the property of the Baldwins.

[136]
âHow do you do, Colonel Lathrop?â
exclaimed the Lord of Papyrus, effusively.

âThat you, Baldwin?â replied the
Westerner; âyou have a delightful town
here.â

âSo we think;â and the little millionaire
paper-maker rubbed his hands in
self-congratulation; âbut we have a few
evil-minded cranks among us who think
they could improve matters. However,
I think the boys will drive out the worst
one within a week.â

âWho is he? Who would think of
finding fault with such a paradise as
this?â pursued the Colonel.

âNo one but a foolâa crank named
Wycliff. There he is now, cleaning the
street, with the rest of Maxwellâs gangâa
job just suited to him, except that
he ought not to have any employment at
all in a decent town.â

âWycliff? Wycliff? John Wycliff?âOne-eyed
Wycliff?â

âYes, thatâs the man. Do you know
him?â asked the little man in surprise.

[137]
âI rather think I do,â replied Colonel
Lathrop, pulling out his wallet, âand
hereâs a hundred dollars that says you
donât drive John Wycliff out of Papyrus,
and that if you try it youâll have the
biggest job for the Coroner you ever had
in Berkshire. What! Wonât put up the
money?â and the big ranchman looked
down on the little millionaire with contempt.

âThereâs no blood in your neck, is
there!â

The dapper little churchman was
shocked that anyone should expect him
to do such a vulgar, unchristian thing as
to bet, but he controlled himself long
enough to ask:â

âWhat do you know of Wycliff?â

âOh, not much,â sneered the big
fellow, âexcept that he is the most stubborn
cuss, and can shoot the straightest
and quickest of any man I ever knew.â
Then, as the little man waited, he continued:â

âHe was a cow-boy on my ranch. One
day the Indians tried to stampede his
[138]

herd. There were seven red devils, and
he all alone against them. We found
four âgood Indians,â Indians that would
never steal any more cattle, one just dying,
and two had returned to the reservation
to report that Wycliff was âbad
medicine.â We found Wycliff, nearly
dead, with one eye shot out, behind a
breastwork of dead cattle.â

The big ranchman did not attempt to
disguise his contempt for the little man,
and without a word of farewell, he strode
down into the dirt of the street, to greet
his former employee. Meanwhile one of
the loungers at the hotel had overheard
the Colonelâs story. Before night it was
repeated, with numerous additions, all
through Papyrus, and all the Baldwinsâ
money would not have hired the biggest
bully in the town to approach John Wycliff
with evil intent.

The ranchman stepped up to Hugh
Maxwell, who was overseeing the work,
saying:â

âI want to borrow one of your menâWycliffâfor
awhile, if I may do so.â

[139]
âAll right,â was the reply. âOnly
return him in good condition.â

Then the two walked off down the
street, and the Colonel told Wycliff of
his conversation with Zechariah Baldwin.

âIâm not afraid of anything in that
direction,â replied Wycliff. âI am
blessed with lots of good friends in Papyrus,
and one of Zack Baldwinâs own
gang gave away the whole plot to me.
I have friends in Zack Baldwinâs own
house. I have taken all the precautions
I care to. I have sent away my wife
and child, for the present, up into the
country. Such of our household goods
as are valuable merely for their associationsâour
pictures, my mounted cougar,
everything which money could not replaceâall
these things I have taken to a
neighborâs. As for me, I donât know as
I should live a week if some one did not
threaten to injure me.â And Wycliff
laughed.

âI came to town,â said Colonel Lathrop,
âto see about your share in the
[140]

Rattlesnake. I hope you havenât sold
it.â

âNo. When I lost my property I tried
to sell it, but could not get an offer. I
have felt that sometime it might become
of value, perhaps through cheaper methods
of mining.â

âYou know Walker Nichols, the mining
expert?â

âBy reputation. Yes.â

âHe thinks that by the practice of
new economies in mining, which will
lessen our expenses considerably, we
may be able to operate the Rattlesnake
Mine at a small profit. Then there is
always the possibility of striking a richer
vein. Shall I go ahead? You will not
need to advance anything.â

âCertainly.â

âYou remember Mr. Baxter?â

âYes; âOld Sunshine,â the boys used
to call him.â

âHe has great faith that we shall
strike something better if we open up
the Rattlesnake again. His opinion
ought to be worth something. He was
[141]

a âforty-niner,â has worked in the mines
ever since, and has made and lost fortunes
in them.â

Colonel Lathrop withdrew, and John
Wycliff returned to his work.

Zechariah Baldwin, although temporarily
thwarted in his plans to rid the town
of Wycliff, was by no means inclined to
give up his efforts. He had an abundance
of resources and expedients, and
when one failed he was not usually long
in finding another.

Wycliffâs family had been sent up to
Sprucemont, where they were the guests
of their old friends, the Porters. One
night, soon after their departure, Wycliff,
who had retired, was awakened by
a lusty rap at the door.

âWhoâs there?â he shouted, throwing
up his chamber window.

âNot too loud, John,â came the answer
from a suppressed voice.

âThat you, Dan? Wait a minute till
I let you in.â

âNo; I canât stop. Thereâs a big game
on foot. Jehu Baldwin will fire a revolver
[142]

through his Uncle Davidâs bedroom window.
Then he will run in the middle of
the street to your house, where he will
take to the grass and throw the weapon
upon your lawn.â

âTo-night?â

âYes; just after midnight. But I
must get back.â

Congressman Baldwin was the idol of
the masses, and if it could be made to appear
that Wycliff had assaulted him there
would be a riot, and the victim of its
fury would be fortunate if he escaped
alive. Frontier methods would not avail
at this crisis. Wycliff was somewhat resourceful
himself. He got his camera
and prepared for a flashlight photograph.
He had been writing a magazine article
on the whippoorwillâ(one of these birds
sang in the lilacs every night)âand he
had the materials ready for a flashlight
of the bird, to illustrate his article. He
would now use them to photograph a different
object. He set his camera so that
it would sweep the highway, and waited
under cover of the midnight darkness.

[143]
The town clock struck for twelve.
A thunder-shower was coming up. There
was an occasional flash and roar from
the cloud. The whippoorwill sang in
the lilacs. There were pistol-shots down
the road, and then the sound of running
footsteps. They drew nearer until they
were directly in front of Wycliff. The
flashlight did its work. Wycliff boarded
a trolley-car for Elmfield, carrying the
precious camera, and leaving this notice
on his front door:â

â
Gone to visit my old friend,

Sheriff Coggswell, at the Jail.

â
JOHN WYCLIFF.
â

[144]

CHAPTER XII.

ON that same evening mentioned in
our last chapter there was a social
gathering at Farmer Porterâs, in Sprucemont.
It was a festival known among
the Green Mountain farmers as a âsugar-eat,â
but it was held very much out of
season. Maple sugar is usually made
during the months of February or March.
The sap drawn from the rock-maple, or
sugar-maple trees is boiled until it reaches
a consistency which is called wax. Tin
pans are pressed full of snow, and the
maple wax, dipped boiling from the kettles,
is poured upon the snow. The wax
hardens upon the snow, and is then esteemed
the greatest delicacy of country
epicures.

For many years Farmer Porter had
treated his neighbors to an annual sugar-eat;
not in winter or spring, but in midsummer,
the snow being obtained from
the cave on Twin Mountain, known as
the âBearâs Den.â On this occasion,
[145]

besides his country neighbors, there were
present some friends from Papyrus, Ford
Hulbert and Lena Boardman, and John
Wycliffâs wife and child. Uncle Jerry
Barnaby was a neighbor, and was present
with his wife and daughter.

The farmers, and their wives, daughters,
mothers and sweethearts for miles
around, thronged the hospitable home of
Daniel Porter. In the old-fashioned fireplace
in the kitchen, on a stout iron crane,
hung the ancient copper kettle filled with
maple syrup. A crackling wood fire
kept the syrup leaping and dancing, until
it was boiled down thick enough to
âstand,â or harden, upon the snow. A
number of experts decided this point,
and when, according to their verdict, it
was just brittle enough, the boys brought
in the pans of snow which they had secured
from the cave.

The guests were seated at long tables,
each group of two or three having a pan
of snow, on which the maple wax had
been poured in fanciful figures, which
were gathered off the snow and eaten
[146]

with forks. There was a momentâs hush,
as the preacher arose and invoked the
Lordâs blessing upon the occasion. Then
began a season of social intercourse and
merry-making.

An outburst of laughter from all occasionally
testified to a fresh triumph of
Uncle Jerryâs wit and called attention
anew to the pale young woman beside
him. There was circulated among a few
near friends a photograph of a young
man, a Westerner apparently, and it was
whispered about that he was a prosperous
ranchman and lumberman, and that
he would soon return to revisit the home
of his youth. The picture, and the neighborly
remarks called forth by it, brought
a momentary color to the pale face by
Uncle Jerryâs side.

Old neighbors and friends were no less
interested in Miss Boardman, whose girlhood
had been spent among them, and
who was here to-night, accompanied by
Ford Hulbert, the Papyrus real estate
agent. If Lena Boardman were at all
observant, she must have noticed the respect
[147]

shown her companion by all present,
and the slightest inquiry would have
revealed the fact that he was universally
respected in the little farming community.

It was a weird occasion, for the snows
of winter and the sweets of spring contrasted
strangely with the warmth of the
midsummer evening, and it was soon
over. The last sentiment expressed at
the tables, as the party broke up, was
this of Uncle Jerry: âOur Berkshire
women,âGod bless âem,âthe sweetest
things of Godâs creation.â

Lena Boardman and Ford Hulbert had
come on horseback, a favorite method of
travel with them, and as soon as the
party began to break up they returned
to Papyrus in the same way they had
come. Down the long slopes the riders
cantered, sometimes through deep woods,
sometimes in the open. It was quite
dark, but where the riders could not be
sure of their way the horses could be
trusted to find it.

An owl shouted his greeting from the
[148]

tall spire of a spruce tree. The hurried
whistle of a whippoorwill rang out from
a thicket of wild cherry bushes. Up
from the deep aisles of a hemlock woods
came the snarl of a wildcat.

The roadside bushes had a spicy breath.
A minty fragrance was wafted from the
brookside. From fields freshly cut came
the scent of hay newly mown.

Hulbert reined up his horse, and
stopped his companionâs, also.

âLena,â he said, âhavenât I been on
probation long enough? You have known
for a long time that I love you. How
long are you going to hold me off at
armâs length?â

âA burnt child dreads the fire,â replied
his companion. âI said yes once,
to my sorrow. I donât want to be hasty
again.â

âI donât like to be compared to Clif
Borden,â he replied. âIf you made a
bad choice once, I donât know who was
to blame for it but yourself. You knew
the man, or you ought to have known
him; you knew, or you ought to have
[149]

known, for your friends told you, that
Borden had no respect for any woman,
and no respect for virtue. You went
into the fire, as you express it, with full
knowledge of the risk you were running.
I have served a good long apprenticeship
for your hand. You ought to know,
also, whether I am an honorable man.
It is a long time since I first asked you
to be my wife. Donât be in a hurry
about answering. I shall never ask you
again.â And Hulbertâs horse resumed
its canter down the mountain road.

There was just the least bit of the coquette
about Lena Boardman. She had
fully decided to accept Ford Hulbert,
but she wanted to play him for awhile
yet.

A thunder-shower was coming up rapidly
in the south, and the blackness there
was crossed by zig-zag chains of light.

The hoof-beats were out of harmony
with the music of the mountain brook.
Lena thought of the little spring near
Phillips Porterâs, where the brook started.
The little stream seemed uncertain,
[150]

at first, which way to go. Soon it left
the level meadow of its parent spring,
and came to the steep hillside. It rippled
and sparkled and tumbled alongside the
mountain road for miles. Then another
brook tumbled into it. Then the larger
stream splashed noisily down the mountain
till it joined the river. The river
knew where to go. It took a strong dam
to stop it and make it turn the mill-wheel.

Lena thought of the time when she
had first met Hulbert. She remembered
that spring of admiration for the big,
handsome, courteous fellow, whom everybody
respected, and who ought not to be
dishonored by mention at the same time
with the libertine whom she had married.
She knew that he loved her, and she
knew that her own love had grown, like
the mountain brook, till it was too strong
to be turned aside.

During the remainder of the ride Lena
was considering how she might most
easily surrender. They reached her
own door, where Ford helped her to
[151]

alight. Just then a number of pistol-shots
rang out at a little distance down
the street, but he paid little attention to
them, for her arms were reached out toward
him. She spoke but one word,ââFord,ââbut
it was enough.

A few minutes later, when Hulbert remounted
his horse, a lightning-flash
made the street below brighter than
noonday, and showed to Hulbert and his
companion Jehu Baldwin hurrying past,
pistol in hand. Perhaps they would
have thought more of this, had they not
noticed by another flash, illuminating a
verandah across the street, the parting
of Eva Baldwin and Ralph Cutter.

Riding his own horse, and leading the
one his companion had ridden, Hulbert
hurried away to escape the shower. His
home was a large farm, quite away from
the village.

Next morning, upon taking up a daily
paper, he was quite surprised at the
headlines reproduced on the following
page from the Elmfield
Star
:â

[152]

SHOTS FIRED AT DAVID BALDWIN

John Wycliff the Man Who Committed
the Assault.

WYCLIFFâS DWELLING DESTROYED

By a Papyrus MobâHe Gives Himself Up to
Sheriff Coggswell.

He did not stop to read further, but
mounted his horse, and was soon at Congressman
Baldwinâs office.

âI guess we are rid of John Wycliff
for awhile,â remarked the Congressman.

âSee here, Dave Baldwin, your nephew,
Jehu, fired those shots, and Iâll give you
just ten minutes in which to call your
dogs off from Wycliff. If you donât do
it in that time Iâll telegraph the truth
about this affair to a New York paper
which you cannot command.â

[153]
âHow do you know that Jehu did it?â
asked the Congressman.

âBecause I saw him coming from this
direction, the pistol still in his hand,
shortly after I heard the shots.â

âWhy have you waited until now before
saying a word?â

âI did not suspect anything wrong
until I saw this morningâs paper. There
is at least one crisis in a manâs life when
he is too full of satisfaction himself to
suspect anyone of wrong-doing.â

Just then the telephone bell rang.

âIs this David Baldwin?â

âYes. Who is this?â

âThis is Ralph Cutter at Springdale.
I am sorry for you in your experience of
last night. If you will excuse an old-fashioned
country expression, you are
barking up the wrong tree. You are entirely
wrong in your charge against
Wycliff. Your nephew, Jehu, is the real
culprit. I heard the shots, and was just
taking leave of your sister, when a flash
of lightning showed Jehu distinctly, in
the middle of the street, and the weapon
[154]

still in his hand. Probably it was very
dull of me, but I never thought anything
was wrong. When a man has just found
the greatest blessing of his life he may be
forgiven for being dull to common
things.â

âIt seems to me that Cupid was working
overtime last night,â remarked the
Congressman to himself.

âI do not wish to make public what I
know about Jehu Baldwin,â continued
the voice from Springdale, âbecause I
think that some older person put up the
job, and has used Jehu merely as a tool;
but unless you shall promptly withdraw
your charge against Wycliff, justice will
compel me to make a public announcement.â

âThe charge will be withdrawn at
once,â replied the Congressman.

Baldwin then rang up the jail at Elmfield.

âIs this Sheriff Coggswell?â

âIt is.â

âThis is David Baldwin. Is Wycliff
under arrest?â

[155]
âHe is not. He is my guest. I shall
not arrest him unless the law compels me
to do so, as I have full proof of his innocence,
and of Jehu Baldwinâs guilt. I
have a witness who canât be bribed or
brow-beaten, and whose testimony would
stand against all the Baldwins that ever
lived.â

[Congressman Baldwin and Sheriff
Coggswell were political enemies.]

âA pretty good witness that. Who is
he?â

âI have no right to tell. Youâll know
soon enough.â

âI withdraw my charge against Wycliff,â
concluded Baldwin. And Ford
Hulbert withdrew.

[156]

CHAPTER XIII.

DEEP down in a narrow gorge echoed
the sound of the minerâs pick.

âMr. Baxter,â said Colonel Lathrop,
one of the owners of the Rattlesnake
Mine, âthis is too hot a place for an old
man like you. If you are determined to
work as long as you live Iâve got other
jobs that are easier for you than swinging
a pick-axe in this heat all day. You
know you are not obliged to work. Iâll
see you and your wife well taken care of
as long as you live. Youâve done your
share of the worldâs work. When a man
reaches seventy-five he ought to rest.â

âI enjoy working,â replied âOld Sunshine.â
That was the name he was best
known by among his fellow-laborers.
âItâll be time enough for me to stop work
when I have to. Even if I have done
work enough, I have not worked for you
so long that you can afford to pension
me off.â

âNever mind that. I would enjoy
[157]

paying you your wages better if you
would quit mining. If you are bound to
stick to the mines, why not work in the
âdriftâ with the boys, where the sun cannot
hit you? Itâs fearfully hot out here.â

âNow donât worry any more about
me,â said Old Sunshine, laughing.
âDonât you see Iâm only prospecting?
I want to find out what is under the face
of this cliff.â

âWell, promise me you will quit at
four oâclock, anyway, Baxter.â

And Old Sunshine reluctantly promised.

âMcDonald,â said the Colonel to the
foreman, as he was leaving the mine:
âDonât forget that Old Sunshine is a
privileged character. I donât want him
to work, and had rather pay him for
resting. He has been in the mines over
fifty years,âwas a forty-niner,âbut if
heâs bound to work let him take his own
time, and come and go when he pleases.
Give him full time, anyway.â

âAye, aye, sir,â replied the boss.
âNobody will interfere with Old Sunshine.
[158]

He does more work now than
some of the young fellows, if he is seventy-five.â

Old Sunshine had had a checkered career.
More than once he had been
wealthy, and that wealth, which sometimes
comes suddenly in the mines, had
flown as suddenly as it came. Had he
known the right time to stop, to turn his
mining investments into other and more
stable securities, he might be living in
luxury on his interest money. As it was,
he was dependent upon his dayâs wages
at seventy-five, and partly because of his
independent spirit, and partly from his
robust health and love of work, he refused
to let Colonel Lathrop make life
easier for him.

It was two oâclock. Still the clink of
Old Sunshineâs pick sounded steadily in
the gulch. The other miners were working
in the drifts or levels. Still the torrid
heat rained down upon the solitary
miner, upon the heated rocks, and upon
the rattlesnakes, the original settlers and
owners of the gulch.

[159]
Soon Old Sunshineâs practiced eye told
him that he was reaching a richer rock
than before. Near the foot of the bank
he was gradually uncovering a broad
band of dull yellow. He knew what that
meant,âone of the richest veins he had
ever seen in his half-century of gold-mining.
Another man would have dropped
his pick and called the other miners
to witness his discovery. But not a word
from Old Sunshine.

It was three oâclock. He began to
wield the pick-axe higher up the bank.
The material there was soft or ârotten
rock,â and at four oâclock he had his
rich find at the base of the cliff completely
hidden from sight with the worthless
rock which he had loosened from
above.

âI promised the Colonel Iâd quit at
four oâclock,â he said to the boss who
passed just then. âI suppose I must
keep my word.â

âAye, aye, thatâs all right, Old Sunshine;
perfectly right. Youâve had a
scorcher here to-day,â replied the boss,
[160]

without a suspicion of the wealth which
lay near him. Old Sunshine never gave
him a hint of his find.

Then began the weary climb out of the
gorge. This was the point at which Old
Sunshine most realized that he was well
on the down-hill side of life. He could
still do a fair dayâs work, but he could
not, as formerly, do a dayâs work and
still have a large reserve of strength left
over. He climbed awhile, and then sat
down to rest. Then he climbed again.
Occasionally a serpent made way for
him, shaking his rattles, more as a
warning than a threat. He reached his
own cabin at last.

âWhat brings you home so early?â
asked his wife.

âThe Colonel made me promise to quit
early. He donât like to have me work.
He says he would take care of us and I
guess he would, but I donât like to let
him. Please get me a lunch and then I
must go down and see the Colonel.â

âWhat? Walk six miles to-night?â

âYes, I can do it; it may make a big
[161]

difference to the Colonel. After he went
home I struck a rich vein, and I want
him to know it as soon as possible. The
other miners do not know it. Do not
tell them. I think the vein runs off
across the old âDead Open and Shutâ
claim. The Colonel can buy that claim
for a few thousand dollars now, but
after this strike gets noised abroad he
may not be able to buy it at all. If I can
give the Colonel warning so he can buy
the Dead Open and Shut claim cheap, and
if he makes a good thing out of it, then
I can accept a pension from him, not as
charity, but as my just due. Donât expect
me till morning. Good night.â

Luckily for the old man his journey
was almost all down hill. The whole
country thereabouts was a desert for the
want of water. In those small sections
where irrigation had been employed the
land was very productive.

Old Sunshine plodded on. The sands
were hot. The air was hotter. There
was little beside his path to attract
attention except here and there a cactus
[162]

plant. Beyond the distant mountains,
across the valley, the sun was setting
in glory. The memory of the past
years, of fortunes he had made and lost,
came to him again. It was because these
memories did not make him gloomy and
sour, but because his hopeful nature triumphed
over them, that he had won the
title of Old Sunshine, and none of earthâs
monarchs had a grander title.

It began to grow dark in the desert,
but the western mountain-tops were still
glorious. And then there came to the
old man the words which had cheered
him so often:

âAt evening time it shall be light.â

The day of his life had been full of
storms. Would its evening be peaceful
and light?

Steady plodding brought him to Emerald
Valley, or as it was better known,
Lathropâs Miracle, a desert like the rest
until the Colonelâs enterprise had made
it a paradise. He had dug a canal, tapping
the river miles above, and the water
had turned the desert into a very Eden
[163]

of luxuriance. Everything which the
Colonel could grow brought a high price
in the near-by mining camps. He had
spent many thousands of dollars in this
private enterprise of changing the desert
into a garden, and his efforts had
met the success which they deserved.
Every dollar spent by Colonel Lathrop
in irrigation had returned to him leading
others with it.

The Colonel and his family were at
their evening meal.

âIf here isnât Old Sunshine!â exclaimed
little Daisy Lathrop.

âHave you walked all the way from
the Rattlesnake?â asked the Colonel.
âNothing wrong at the mine, I hope.
Make room at the table, children, for
Mr. Baxter.â

âNothing wrong, Colonelâbut can I
see you alone a few minutes?â

âCertainly. Come this way.â The
Colonel led the way to a room which was
both office and library to him.

âWhatâs up?â he asked.

âI struck a rich vein after you left,
[164]

but I managed to keep it hidden from
the other men. I believe the vein runs
off across the old Dead Open and Shut
claim. I thought perhaps you would like
to buy that claim before the public gets
wind of the strike.â

Old Sunshine then exhibited specimens
of the gold which he had found.

âOf course I canât say how far the
vein extends. You will have to take
your chances on that, but it is the richest
vein I have ever seen in all my fifty
years of mining.â

âYouâre a brick, Old Sunshine. Iâll
close a bargain for the Dead Open and
Shut to-night if I can. Winklereid tried
to sell it to me to-day for ten thousand
dollars. Here, Martha,â he called to his
wife, âplease take the best care you can
of our friend here. He must be pretty
well used up.â

In five minutes the Colonel was astride
his best horse and galloping toward the
village. He dismounted in front of the
real estate office, hitched his horse, stood
still a moment to cool down and to brush
[165]

off the appearance of hurry and excitement,
and then entered. He seated himself
leisurely and began exchanging banter
with the loungers in the office.

Presently Mr. Winklereid, the real estate
dealer, spoke to him:

âHereâs Mr. Hammersley, who has
just bought the Coyote Mine. I hope he
may make a million out of it. And this
man,â continued Winklereid, waving his
hand toward Colonel Lathrop, âcan make
more money out of desert land and river
water than anyone else in the state can
make out of gold-mining.â

âAll joking aside,â replied Colonel
Lathrop, âirrigation is a dead sure thing
when compared with gold-mining, which
is scarcely better than a lottery.â

âThe Colonel,â pursued Mr. Winklereid,
âis the father of irrigation in this
state. For that reason, among others,
his name is being pressed upon Governor
Brown for appointment to the United
States Senate, to succeed Senator Smith,
who died the other day.â

The Colonel did not want to talk politics.
[166]

After wishing Mr. Hammersley
success, he said:â

âNow, Winklereid, watch out for a
little place for me, near the village.
I want a place where a man of seventy-five
can spend his remaining days in ease
and comfort.â

âIâve got it now,â replied Winklereid.
âThe very thing, snug and tidy,
in good repair, right in the village, convenient
to everything.â

âHold it for me till we can look at it.
Iâm in a hurry to-night.â And the Colonel
seemed on the point of leaving.

âYouâd better take me up on that
Dead Open and Shut bargain, Colonel.
Itâs worth more to you than anyone
else.â

âHavenât I enough invested in desert
rocks already?â asked the Colonel. âBesides,â
he continued, âWycliff is my
mining partner. I want him to share my
chances of making a dollar at mining.
But for his bravery I might be poor to-day.
How soon do you want your
money?â

[167]
âPay me any sum you please to-night,
and Iâll give you a bond for a deed before
you leave the office.â

âHereâs five hundred dollars I took in
for cattle to-day. Iâll pay you the rest
in thirty days. Is that satisfactory?â

âPerfectly.â

Half an hour later the Colonel was galloping
toward home with the precious
bond in his pocket.

[168]

CHAPTER XIV.

SHERIFF COGGSWELLâS family
apartments were in the front part
of the jail building, and here he entertained
his old friend, Wycliff, until the
notice came from Congressman Baldwin
that he made no charge against him.
Wycliff then thanked the Sheriff and his
family, and walked out upon the streets
of Elmfield, a free man.

At the gateway of the jail-grounds he
was met by a messenger from Papyrus
bearing a telegram from Colonel Lathrop:â

âRich vein struck at the Rattlesnake.
Syndicate offers one million for mine.
Full particulars by letter.â

Wycliffâs acquaintancesâand he had
many among all classes in Elmfieldâwere
surprised at seeing him at large,
and congratulations and inquiries were
of frequent occurrence. But he saw something
which made him, for the moment,
unconscious of the attentions of friend or
[169]

foe,âa pretty pony, drawing a cart in
which were several children.

Wycliff stopped suddenly. His memory
went back to a scene in a sick-room
not many months before, and to a promise
which he had forgotten. For a time
he had been unable to keep the promise.
Recently he had been able to keep his
promise, but had forgotten it. He wandered
down the main street of Elmfield,
and then off down a side street, to a livery
and sale stable.

âDo you keep those little ponies, such
as children drive?â he asked the proprietor,
an old acquaintance.

âNo, there is too little call for them,
but I order them when wanted. Do you
want one?â

âYes, a perfectly gentle and safe one,
as my boy is not very strong. I am going
over to Cookâs for a cart, and to
Brandonâs for a harness. Please send
the pony to Brandonâs to be fitted with
a harness; get the cart, and send the
outfit to my place, ready for use.â

When these purchases had been made,
[170]

Wycliff called upon his attorney, Lawyer
Sturgis. An hour later Sheriff Coggswell
was posting up a notice of attachment
in the Monadnock, the principal
hotel of Elmfield. As Zechariah Baldwin
owned both the Elmfield
Star
and
the Hotel Monadnock, the hotel could be
lawfully attached for the misdeeds of the
newspaper, while Massachusetts Law in
a measure protects the newspaper plant
from attachment.

âWhat does this mean?â asked the
manager of the hotel.

âIt means,â replied the smiling sheriff,
âthat those who dance must pay the
fiddler,â and straightway he started for
the âPaper Town,â to serve personal
notice upon the Lord of Papyrus himself.
Sheriff Coggswell was the only
Berkshire officer who was independent
of the Baldwinsâthe only one who did
not acknowledge the political authority
of Congressman Baldwin, the political
boss of the County and State. Consequently
he fully enjoyed the present
situation.

[171]
The case against Zechariah Baldwin
came up in the Superior Court, a little
later, for trial. Wycliff, the plaintiff,
was ready to proceed with the case. The
defendant, through his attorney, pleaded
for delay.

Judge Selden, after hearing both attorneys
patiently, ordered an immediate
trial.

âThe defendant in this case,â said the
Judge, âhas, through his newspaper,
charged the plaintiff with a very serious
crimeâassault with intent to kill. If he
had sufficient evidence to warrant him in
making such charge, in such a public
manner, he has sufficient evidence for
defending this action, without delay.â

Then Baldwinâs attorney, Lawyer Stimson,
requested time to effect a settlement
out of court. This was granted.

Only the attorneys for the two parties
met. There was good reason for this,
since a meeting of the principals would
only have resulted in a wordy encounter,
with nothing accomplished at last in the
way of settlement. One could scarcely
[172]

imagine any business of this nature accomplished
between two men who so
thoroughly detested one another as did
Zechariah Baldwin and John Wycliff.
Nor would the settlement have fared
any better if the Baldwin end of the negotiations
had been left with Deacon
Surface, since Wycliff regarded him as
an arch-hypocrite, and he, in his turn,
was looked upon as an outlaw by the
Deacon.

âWell, Sturgis,â began the attorney
for Baldwin, âyour client seems to value
his reputation pretty highly. It is not
often that an attachment for one hundred
thousand dollars is placed in an
action of this kind.â

âYou forget, Stimson,â Lawyer Sturgis
replied, âthat these millionaires think
a good deal of themselves, whatever value
the public may set upon them. Since
Wycliff is rated a millionaire, I presume
he regards himself as not being on the
bargain-counter any longer, but fit to
have his reputation rated with that of
the Baldwins. In the famous Apthorp
[173]

case you pleaded, with abundant reason,
that the reputation of a millionaire was
worth more than that of a poor man.â

Then, seeing a puzzled expression on
the face of his brother attorney, Lawyer
Sturgis continued:â

âPerhaps you have not read all the
latest news from the gold fields. The
syndicate has raised its offer for the
Rattlesnake Mine to two million dollars.â

âBut how does that affect this question?â
asked Stimson, who was still in
the dark.

âJohn Wycliff is a half owner in the
Rattlesnake mine.â

âThat makes a difference.â

âWycliff would prefer to have this
case go to court. He would like to show
up these immaculate Baldwinsâthese
Christian philanthropistsâin their true
attitude toward labor. Only one reason
impels him to a private settlement. Jehu
Baldwin, who would be shown up as
the principal transgressor, is little more
than a boy, and less to blame than his
father who set him on,â said Sturgis.

[174]
âBut,â protested Stimson, âare you
not taking a great deal for granted on
very slight evidence?â

âBy no means,â replied Sturgis. âWe
have full proof of every step of this
whole crime, from the time when Zechariah
Baldwin, on his own premises, persuaded
his son Jehu to set this trap for
Wycliff, until the instant when Jehu
Baldwin threw his pistol upon Wycliffâs
lawn. A kind Providence, more than
his own exertions, has placed full proof
in my clientâs possession. You and I,
Stimson, are both too old, and have won
too honorable a place at the Berkshire Bar
to indulge in a game of bluff, and I have
something here which will convince you
that I am not bluffing.â

He opened his safe, and took from it a
photograph.

âDo you recognize anything in that
picture?â

âYes, that is Dobbsâ Corner, in Papyrus.
The guide-board tells the story.
âElmfield, six miles; Sprucemont, nine
miles; Wendell, five miles.â And that
[175]

old elmâthereâs no mistaking that. I
was out there in my auto yesterday.â

âBut the person?â

âLooks like Jehu Baldwin, surely, and
the pistol still in his hand. But hereâs
an important point which you might be
troubled to prove. How can you prove
that this flashlightâfor a flashlight
photo it is, evidentlyâwas taken on the
night which you claim? If we assert
that it was secured on some other night
than the one of the riot, you cannot
prove that it was taken on that identical
night.â

âEasily enough, Stimson. Do you
see nothing else in the picture?â

âYes, some sort of a machine, or
wagon, with the word âVesuviusâ on it.â

âVery well,â laughed Sturgis, âthat
new Vesuvius road machine spent only
that one night in Papyrus. It was taken
on trial, proved unsatisfactory, and was
next day returned to Elmfield and exchanged
for another.â

âBut you are not going to exact the
whole pound of flesh, the whole hundred
[176]

thousand?â asked Lawyer Stimson.

âNot if you will do the fair thing. If
the
Star
will publish a suitable retraction
of its charge against Wycliff, and an
admission that the attack upon Congressman
Baldwin was part of a conspiracy
to drive Wycliff out of town, then
we will cut our claim to ten thousand
dollars. Otherwise we shall insist on the
whole sum.â

âI think Zack Baldwin had rather pay
the whole demand than to make the acknowledgement
you ask,â said Stimson.

âSo do I,â responded Sturgis. âI
never knew a Baldwin to acknowledge
an injustice he had done, or to make any
compensation for it unless obliged to do
so by law, and being multi-millionaires,
they cannot usually be compelled to do
justly. Senator Dawes, the greatest advocate
that ever faced a Berkshire jury,
in describing a particularly mean man,
once coined the expression, ânatural
cussedness.â I suppose that the orthodox
term, âtotal depravity,â would have
sounded more smoothly, but smoothness
[177]

was not what the great Senator was after.
When I think of the great conspiracy
against my client I cannot help using
the words of the Senator. Natural
cussedness is a proper term to apply to
the meanness of Zack Baldwin. The
words fit.â

âYou are rather uncharitable toward
my client, are you not?â asked Stimson,
laughing, and stepping to a window.
Lawyer Sturgisâ office was on the upper
floor of the highest block in the city of
Elmfield, and commanded a fine view of
the city.

âCome here, Sturgis,â said the other,
and Sturgis stepped to the window.
âThere is a side of Zechariah Baldwinâs
character which you do not appreciate.
There is the finest gift ever made to
the city. Who gave that splendid building
to Elmfield?â

Before them stood the Elmfield Public
Library, given to the city by the Honorable
Zechariah Baldwin and representing,
with its contents, an expenditure of more
than half a million dollars.

[178]
âYou will probably think me a crank,
Stimson,â Sturgis replied, âbut I believe
the half million dollars put into that building
had better have gone to the Baldwin
employees. One thousand each, in cash
or in a home, to five hundred workmen,
would have done more good than half a
million in this palatial building, in my
way of thinking. It would be nearer
just.

âThe very fact that the Baldwins have
been able, through the labor of others,
in the paper industry, to pile up millions
and tens of millions, for themselves and
their descendants, while incidentally giving
a few millions in so-called charity,
this very fact, I say, is evidence that they
might have paid their workmen more liberally.
I tell you, Stimson, the time is
coming, though you and I may not live
to see it, when the lionâs share of the
profits in any industry will go, not to the
employer, but to the worker. To accomplish
this it may be necessary for the
government to become the employer.â

âIsnât that socialism?â asked the smiling
[179]

Stimson of his brother of the Bar.

âI believe that there is something vitally
wrong,â replied Sturgis, âin a system
which permits the employer to pile
up millions, tens of millions, and even
hundreds of millions of dollars, while
the workman, who is making these millions
for him, often receives only a bare
living, and frequently has nothing left
for old age. With apologies to Patrick
Henry, if this be socialism, make the
most of it. Let me remind you of a
very prominent illustration of our present
system. Our government framed its
tariff laws for the special benefit of the
iron and steel industry, it being claimed
that such laws would especially benefit
the workingmen in that industry. Who
received the benefit? More than two
hundred millions of dollars were piled
up in the hands of one man, who is now
trying to unload these millions upon the
public libraries of the country. Without
denying the benefit of public libraries,
that two hundred millions should most
of it have gone to the workingmen who
[180]

created that wealth. Give the workingmen
of America their just dues, and
there will be no need of private gifts to
libraries. Every community will be
abundantly able to build its own library,
and that will be better than accepting
gifts from men whose wealth rightly
belongs to the people.â

âWould you deny the right of private
property?â asked Stimson.

âThe right of private property, when
grossly abused, must give way to something
higher,âthe public good.â

âIf I stay longer I shall miss another
appointment,â said Stimson. âYour
client will probably receive a check
soon.â And Stimson withdrew.

[181]

CHAPTER XV.

JOHN WYCLIFF had made his plans
for remaining in Papyrus. Zechariah
Baldwin had paid the full amount
of John Wycliffâs legal demands. The
latter, through the agency of his friend,
Ford Hulbert, had purchased the Van
Alstyne estate, comprising the old Van
Alstyne homestead, numerous tenements
located in different parts of the town,
and several hundred acres of land on the
outskirts of the town. It was the largest
piece of real estate in Papyrus, except
the Wesson Mills, which the all-devouring
Baldwins had not secured.

Scarcely had Wycliff moved his family
into the old Van Alstyne homestead,
when all his plans were upset by a letter
from Colonel Lathrop, proposing that he
remove to Emerald Valley, and giving
very substantial reasons for such proposal.
The Colonel wrote in part:â

âSenator Smith recently died, and
Governor Brown offers me the appointment
[182]

to the U. S. Senate until the Legislature
meets, when it is reasonably sure
that it will elect me for the remainder of
Senator Smithâs unexpired term. Of
course you will see the wisdom of having
one of the owners of the Rattlesnake
Mine resident here. I am not a statesman.
I am not much of a politician, except
that, in a large measure, I have
footed the bills of my party here. My
claims upon the people are two: First,
as the father of irrigation in this region.
Second, in partnership with yourself, as
one of the owners of the leading gold
mine in this section.

âI should like to spend a year in the
Millionairesâ Club, at Washington, and
obtain the title of U. S. Senator for my
old age. The Rattlesnake Mine, which
now includes the Dead Open and Shut,
is forging rapidly to the front of all gold-mining
properties in the West, and there
is scarcely a doubt that after I have completed
the late Senator Smithâs term, you
could be elected to succeed me. Money
makes senators, and this is as true of
[183]

the East as of the West in these days.

âI remember, as a young man, you
used to be proud of New England. You
used to speak of the New England love
of fair play, and you would grow eloquent
in praise of the New England
conscience. Havenât you had enough
of New England fair play? Do you
want more of it?

âI saw a leading Abolitionist dragged
through the streets of Boston. I learned
then where the New England conscience
was, and is. It was, and is, inside the
New England pocket-book. Had slavery
been profitable in New England we
should not have had the Civil War, and
slavery would still be an American institution.
I fought in that war, but I cannot
close my eyes to the truth. There
were soldiers under my command, who,
as Northern laborers, were more to be
pitied than the slaves on the better class
of Southern plantations.

âI remember a young manâ(do you
remember him?)âwho was a great admirer
of the Springdale
Democrat
, which
[184]

has been called the New England Bible.
It is eloquent, in season and out of season,
in advocating equal rights for the
Southern negro and the Filipino, but
never asks equal rights for the mill-hands
of Papyrus. It does not hesitate to criticise
the President of the United States,
but its millionaire idol, Congressman
Baldwin, is exempt from criticism. Can
you defend this course?

âLet me urge one consideration which
cannot fail to have weight with you.
Your physician will tell you, much better
than I can, that your sonâs chances of living
to a vigorous manhood will be much
improved by coming here. Here, in all
probability, he would reach a rugged
maturity, and here is the mining property
with which he should become familiar,
as he must some day, in the natural course
of events, bear a part in its management.â

Wycliff had scarcely finished reading
this letter to his wife, when she said:â

âThere are Eva Baldwin and Ralph
Cutter, apparently coming here.â Only
[185]

a few days before had the newspapers
announced the coupleâs engagement.

âI am told,â said Miss Baldwin, âthat
you own the territory to the northward,
known as the Wilderness. There are
reasons, purely sentimental, why I would
like to purchase a portion of it, including
Pulpit Rock. Would you sell it?â

âI had not intended to sell,â replied
Wycliff. âI had thought of making a
sheep-range of it. At the same time I
intended making paths through it, as our
Robert needs just the exercise which he
could get there. However, if the possession
of a portion of it would give pleasure
to you, I suppose that I ought to sell, provided
my wife agrees.â

âI have no objection,â said Mrs. Wycliff.
âIt seems to me that the Wilderness
is large enough to accommodate both of
us.â

âWe shall probably soon go West for a
time,â said Wycliff, âbut my agent, Ford
Hulbert, will attend to the matter. I
think that you and he will have no difficulty.
I believe the day will come, although
[186]

not in our time, when there will
be no private ownership of land, it is
subject to so many abuses.â

âAmen,â exclaimed Ralph Cutter. âI
believe that the Lord made this earth for
the enjoyment of all his people, not to
have its blessings monopolized by a favored
few. Government ownership of
land must come, I believe, although you
and I will probably not live to see it.â

A little later Miss Boardman and Ford
Hulbert drove up. âI donât know what
you will think of Lena,â said the gentleman.
âShe seems to be getting ambitious,
wants me to buy of you one of the
peaks of Twin Mountain for a summer
residence. I am afraid you will not care
to sell.â

âIt seems likely,â said Wycliff, âthat
we shall go west to look after our mining
property, leaving everything here in your
care. I hope we may be able to return
occasionally. If we ever build on Twin
Mountain, I think one peak will be ample
for our use, will it not?â he asked, addressing
his wife.

[187]
âI hope we may be able to spend some
time here each summer,â Mrs. Wycliff
replied. âIf we ever do build on Twin
Mountain it will be very pleasant to have
you there for neighbors.â

When they had gone Uncle Jerry Barnaby
came to give an account of his stewardship
of Twin Mountain Farm. He
seemed to be hardly the same person as
the woe-begone, long-faced man they
had once known.

âHow is your daughter?â asked Mrs.
Wycliff.

âYou never saw such a change in anyone,â
said Uncle Jerry. âPet is hardly
the same woman that she was when she
left Papyrus.â

âWhat has done it? Our mountain
air?â

âI donât wish to run down our mountain
air; the fact is, Iâve seen the time
when you couldnât run it down with an
express train. But givinâ the mountain
air all the credit that belongs to it, still
itâs those letters from Oregon that have
saved Pet. Itâs the old, old story,âââTis
[188]

love that makes the world go âround.â

âWhen that first letter came to Pet,
from âway up in the great Northwest, it
made a little spot of color on Petâs cheeks
just about as big as the first bit of color
that shows in a rosebud, and that spot, or
that pair of spots, have been growinâ bigger
ever since till now the roses are pretty
much full-blown.â

âWhen is he coming?â

âIn a fortnight.â

âAnd then?â

âThey will be married, and go to his
home in the Oregon woods. Pet always
did like the woods, and sheâll have woods
a plenty there. He has hundreds of acres
of forest.â

âPop,â said Robbie later, as he climbed
on to his fatherâs knees, by the window,
âsee that pretty pony and little cart
coming down the street. Say, Pop, when
I was so sick did you promise me a pony
and a cart, or did I dream it?â

âI promised,â replied the father, but
now the pony and cart were at the door.

Still later a very tired boy was resting
[189]

comfortably in his kind fatherâs arms.

âPop,â he said, âare we really and
truly rich?â

âIt looks like that,â replied the father,
âbut I was rich before.â

âHow is that?â asked the boy.

âPlease bring me that old scrap-book,
Robbie.â

The boy brought it, and the father read
aloud these lines:â

â
I have thought myself poor since God withheld

From me His lands and gold,

Forgetting that some of his gifts excelled

Mere wealth a thousand fold.

â
For what is the wealth of the teeming fields

Beside thy love, wife mine?

And measured by joy a childâs love yields

What worth is a golden mine?
â

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

INDEX

Abbeville, Treaty of.

A treaty between the English Barons and Louis IX of France, signed in
1259, shortly after the establishment in England of the Council of
Fifteen. By its provisions England retained Bordeaux, Bayonne, and
Gascony, and surrendered all claim to Normandy, Anjou, Poitou, and
Maine. The French king agreed to supply a sum of money sufficient to
maintain for two years five hundred knights, to be employed for the
benefit of England or of the Church.

Abecedarians.

A branch of the Anabaptists, founded in Germany in the sixteenth century
by Stork, a disciple of Luther. They held that all human knowledge was
valueless, and therefore declined to learn even the alphabet.

Abencerrages.

A noble Moorish family of Granada, in the fifteenth century. They were
accused by a rival family, the Zegris, of plotting against Abdallah,
King of Granada, and were lured into the Alhambra, where they were
barbarously massacred. Thirty-six members of the family perished.

Abhorrers.

Another name for the Tories in the reign of Charles II. They were so
called from their use of the word in their addresses to the king,
protesting against the petitions in favour of summoning a Parliament in
1679.

Abingdon Law.

Execution first and trial afterwards. The phrase is derived from the
methods adopted by Major-General Brown, of the Commonwealth Army, at
Abingdon, during the Civil War. It was his habit, it is said, to deal in
this fashion with Malignants who fell into his hands.

Abjuration, Act of (England).

An Act passed in 1702, imposing upon all who took office under the
State, an oath abjuring the House of Stuart, and binding them to support
each successor to the throne named in the Act of Settlement.

Abjuration, Act of (Netherlands).

The declaration of independence made at The Hague in 1581 by the
deputies of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, deposing Philip II.
It did not, however, substitute any other form of government.

Abo, Treaty of.

A treaty between Russia and Sweden, signed in 1743, after the surrender
of the Swedish army at Helsingfors. Russia acquired Finland, as far as
the
{2}
river KiÃ¼mer, and secured the election of Adolphus Frederick of
Holstein as Crown Prince of Sweden, in the place of the Prince Royal of
Denmark.

Abolitionists.

The extreme anti-slavery party in the United States, in 1860. They
demanded the total abolition of slavery, and would agree to no
compromise with the South, even at the cost of civil war.

Absentee Tax.

A tax imposed upon absentee landlords in Ireland, in the reign of
Richard II. An attempt was made to reimpose it in 1773, but
unsuccessfully, mainly owing to the opposition of Edmund Burke.

Academic Legion.

A body of armed students who took an active part in the revolutionary
disturbances in Vienna in 1848.

Acadia.

The original name of Nova Scotia.

Acte Additionel.

A proclamation by Napoleon, on his return from Elba in 1815, in which he
accepted, with some slight modifications, the
Charte
of Louis XVIII.

Adam Kok, Treaty with.

A treaty made with Adam Kok, a Griqua chief, by Sir Peregrine Maitland
in 1845. One of its provisions, which later caused considerable trouble
in the Orange River Sovereignty, prevented the alienation of land by the
Griquas to Europeans over a considerable portion of Kokâs territory. The
treaty was denounced by Great Britain in 1856 after the Convention of
Bloemfontein.

Addled Parliament.

A Parliament summoned by James I, in 1615. An attempt by certain of its
members, who were dubbed the Undertakers, to control it in the interests
of the Court, failed signally, and the king promptly dissolved it.

Adendorff Trek.

A threatened trek of a large number of Transvaal Boers, under a leader
named Adendorff, into Mashonaland, in 1891. Sir Henry Loch raised a
protest, on the ground that the trek would be an infringement of the
Swaziland Convention of 1890, and an act of hostility towards Great
Britain, whereupon President Kruger issued a proclamation forbidding all
Transvaal burghers to take part in the movement.

Adis Ababa, Treaty of.

A treaty signed May 15, 1902, between Great Britain and Ethiopia
(Abyssinia). It provides for the rectification and delimitation of the
frontier between Abyssinia and the Soudan. The Negus undertakes not to
sanction any damming of the Sobat or the Blue Nile without the consent
of Great Britain, grants a lease of a tract of country on the Baro
river, for the formation of a commercial
entrepÃ´t
, and gives Great
Britain the right to connect Uganda and the Soudan by a railway running
through Abyssinia. A further treaty, to which Italy is also a party,
provides for the rectification of the frontiers of Eritrea with
Abyssinia and the Soudan.
{3}

Adjutators.

Delegates elected by each regiment of the Parliamentary Army in 1647, to
act with the officers in placing their demands and grievances before
Parliament prior to disbandment.

1572, demanding the establishment of Presbyterianism, as being a divine
institution.

Admonition, Cardinal Allenâs.

A pamphlet addressed to the âNobility and People of England,â bringing a
series of scandalous charges against Queen Elizabeth, issued by Cardinal
Allen in 1588.

Adonis of Fifty.

A nickname of George IV.

Adrian, Bull of.

A bull issued by Adrian IV, in 1156, granting the sovereignty of Ireland
to Henry II, in return for his undertaking to support the Papal
authority, and to pay Peterâs Pence.

Adrianople, Treaty of.

A treaty between Russia and Turkey, signed in 1829, following the
capture by Russia of the fortresses of Varna, Silistria, and Adrianople.
It gave Russia control over the mouths of the Danube, and the
appointment of protector of the privileges of Moldavia and Wallachia.

Adriatic, Marriage of the.

An ancient ceremony celebrated yearly at Venice on Ascension Day, and
typifying the greatness of Venice as a maritime power. The Doge was
conveyed in his state barge to the sea, and threw into the water a
consecrated ring. The ceremony was established in 1174 by Pope Alexander
III, in memory of the victory of the Venetians over the fleet of
Barbarossa.

Adscriptus GlebÃ¦.

A person who was compelled to remain on his lordâs estate. The condition
of a villein or serf in feudal times.

Adullamites.

A small section of the Liberal party, headed by Mr. Lowe (Lord
Sherbrooke) who opposed Mr. Gladstoneâs Reform Bill of 1866. The name
had its origin in a speech of John Bright, who likened the malcontents
to those who took refuge in the Cave of Adullam. The term âcaveâ is now
applied to any small knot of dissentients within the ranks of one of the
great political parties.

Adventurers of 1642.

The gentlemen and others who had advanced money to the Government during
the Irish Rebellion of 1641, to be repaid by grants of forfeited land.
In 1653 these claims were recognized by grants in various parts of
Leinster and Munster.

Afrancesados.

The partizans of Napoleon in Spain and the Spanish Colonies.

Afrikander Bond.

An organization formed in Cape Colony in 1881, with the avowed object of
securing for the Afrikanders a larger share of political power. Its
moving
{4}
Spirit was Mr. Hofmeyr, a member of the Cape Ministry. It has
taken a leading part in Cape politics, generally in opposition to
British rule, and during the Boer war of 1899-1902 gave strong evidence
of disloyalty.

Agraviados.

The Catalan insurgents, in 1825, called themselves the Agraviados, or
men with a grievance.

Agrarian League.

A league formed in Berlin in 1893, to advocate bimetalism and a return
to protection. In the latter portion of its programme, it has had
considerable success.

Agricultural Alliance Bill.

The name given to a bill passed by the Prussian Parliament in 1896, at
the instigation of the Agricultural Alliance. It prohibited time
bargains in corn, mining shares, etc., and provided for the regulation
of the Berlin Bourse, Corn Exchange, and other Exchanges, by a committee
under a Government official. To escape these vexatious restrictions, the
produce brokers deserted the Exchange and formed a Free Commercial
Union, meeting in another building to carry on their business.

Aids.

Taxes levied on their feudatories by the English kings, prior to Magna
Charta. By that instrument, however, it was provided that they were to
be granted only by the Great Council, except in three specified cases:
the delivery of the king from prison, the knighting of the kingâs eldest
son, or the marriage of his eldest daughter.

Aigun, Convention of.

A treaty between Russia and China, signed in 1858, by which Russia
obtained all the territory eastward of the Ussuri river to the Japan
Sea, and fixed her southern boundary at the frontier of Corea.

Aix-la-Chapelle, Congress of.

A congress held in 1818, and attended by plenipotentiaries from Great
Britain, Prussia, Austria and Russia, to arrange for the evacuation of
France by the army of occupation, and the readmission of France, as one
of the Great Powers, to the Councils of Europe.

Aix-la-Chapelle, Treaty of.

A treaty between the Triple Alliance (England, Holland and Sweden) and
Louis XIV of France, signed in May, 1668. Spain, which acceded to the
Treaty, received Franche ComtÃ© from France, and surrendered certain
frontier towns, including Lille, Courtray, and Tournay. The Triple
Alliance were thus enabled to checkmate Louisâ designs in the Low
Countries.

Aix-la-Chapelle, Treaty of.

A treaty signed by England, France, Austria, Spain, and Holland, in
1748, putting an end to the War of the Austrian Succession.
Territorially, its provisions in the main amounted to a return to the

status quo ante
, but it was provided that the Pretender should be
expelled from France, that Spain should renew the Asiento treaty with
England, and that Austria was to receive the acknowledgment by the
signatories of the Duke
{5}
of Lorraine, husband of Maria Theresa, as
Emperor, in return for the cession of Silesia to Prussia.

Akerman, Treaty of.

A treaty between Russia and Turkey, supplementary to the Treaty of
Bucharest, signed in 1826. It provided that the Hospodars of Moldavia
and Wallachia should rule independently, each with a council of Boyars,
and should not be deposed without the Czarâs consent; that Servia should
elect her own princes, and that Russia should occupy the East coast of
the Black Sea, and should have free access to all Turkish waters.

Alabama.

A privateer fitted out in England during the American Civil War, to prey
upon the commerce of the Northern States. After the war the United
States made an enormous claim for compensation, which was submitted to
arbitration, with the result that England was condemned to pay about
three and a half millions sterling.

Alais, Treaty of.

A treaty between the Catholics and the Huguenots in France, signed in
1629, after the fall of La Rochelle. By this treaty the Huguenots were
finally deprived of their political rights.

Alaric Cottin.

A sobriquet of Frederick the Great of Prussia, given him by Voltaire. It
infers that he was a great soldier but a very poor poet.

Alascans.

The name given to the foreign Protestant refugees in England during the
reign of Edward VI. The name is derived from Laski, the superintendent
of foreign church communities.

Alaska Purchase.

By a treaty between the United States and Russia, in 1867, the latter
Power surrendered all her possessions on the continent of the United
States, together with the Probyloff Islands, in consideration of a
payment of 7,200,000 dols.

Alaska Treaty.

A treaty between Great Britain and the United States, signed in 1903, by
which it was agreed to submit the question of the boundary between
Alaska and Canada to a commission of six jurists, three to be nominated
by each side. This question had been pending since the cession of Alaska
to the United States by Russia in 1867, the doubt as to the true
frontier arising from the very indefinite terms of the Anglo-Russian
Convention of 1825.

Albanian League.

A league founded by the Porte in 1880, to oppose the aspirations of
Montenegro towards an increase of territory. In 1887 the league
presented to the Sultan a petition for autonomy, under an Albanian
governor, and receiving no answer, rose in rebellion. The outbreak,
however, was easily suppressed.

Albany Regency.

A coterie of Democrats who from 1820 to 1854 exercised a controlling
influence over the politics of New York State, and had consequently
considerable power in national politics. Their headquarters were at
Albany.
{6}

Albigenses.

A sect of dissenters from the Romish doctrine, settled in the South of
France, under the protection of Raymond, Count of Toulouse, their name
being derived from the town of Albi. Innocent III organised a crusade
against them in 1215, under the leadership of Simon de Montfort, and at
the siege of BÃ©ziers it is estimated that 15,000 Albigenses were put to
the sword. They nevertheless held out until 1229, when Raymond
capitulated, and the Inquisition was established in Toulouse. The sect,
though dispersed, was not destroyed, and its members carried the seeds
of Protestantism into Bohemia, Germany and England.

Alcantara, Knights of.

A Spanish order of religious chivalry, established in 1177, and directed
against Mohammedanism.

Ale Conner.

An official appointed annually the Court-Leet to test and examine the
ale sold in the borough, and to prosecute dishonest vendors.

Alexander of Bulgaria, Abduction of.

A conspiracy of the pro-Russian party in Bulgaria, in 1886. Prince
Alexander, whose policy was to free his country from Russian influence,
was kidnapped by some Bulgarian officers, and carried off in his yacht
to Russian territory. An attempt was then made to establish a
pro-Russian government under M. Zankoff, but the sympathies of the
Bulgarians were with the Prince, and M. Stambuloff set up a Council of
Regency, and demanded his return. The Prince came back, but with nerves
completely shattered by his experiences, or, as was alleged, by the
administration of certain drugs, and he shortly afterwards abdicated.
There seems little doubt that the Russian Foreign Office was privy to
the plot.

Alexander of the North.

A sobriquet of Charles XII of Sweden (1682-1718).

Alexander, The Albanian.

Iskander Beg (George Castriot, 1404-1467) was so called.

Alexander, The English.

A sobriquet of Henry V.

Alexander Newski, Order of.

A Russian order of knighthood, founded by Peter the Great in 1722.

Alien Act.

An act passed in 1793, to deal with the enormous influx of foreigners
into England, due to the French Revolution. Aliens were required to
state the object of their visit, to register their names, and to obtain
passports for moving to and fro.

Alien and Sedition Laws.

A series of Acts of Congress passed in 1798, to deal with the situation
caused by the residence in the United States of a large number of
naturalized Frenchmen who sympathized with France in the difficulties
then pending between the two countries. They gave the President the
power to banish undesirable aliens. They were very unpopular, and were,
in fact, never enforced with any stringency, but are noticeable
{7}
as
having led to the first declaration of States Rights, Kentucky and
Virginia declaring them unconstitutional.

Aliwal North, First Treaty of.

A treaty, signed in 1858 between the Orange Free State and Moshesh, the
Basuto chief, through the mediation of Sir George Grey. This treaty
rectified the frontier somewhat in favour of the Basutos, and made other
provisions tending to the maintenance of peace.

Aliwal North, Second Treaty of.

A treaty between Great Britain and the Orange Free State, signed in
1869, settling the boundary between the two contracting parties in
Basutoland. After the annexation by Great Britain of the territories of
Moshesh, the Orange Free State claimed the boundary line fixed by the
treaty of Thaba Bosigo, while Great Britain claimed that in existence
before the war of 1865. A compromise was eventually arrived at, and the
frontier thus fixed is that at present existing between the Orange River
Colony and the Cape.

All Red Cable.

A cable route from England to Australia, touching only British soil,
projected by the Ottawa Conference in 1894. The scheme met with the
approval and support of the Imperial Parliament, and the cable was
completed in 1902.

Allgemeines Landrecht.

The Prussian Code of Law, amplified from the Landrecht of Frederick the
Great.

Alliance Society.

A political association formed in Belgium in 1897, with the object of
uniting the different branches of the Liberal Party.

Allodial Lands.

Among the Franks, lands held in absolute proprietorship, as opposed to
lands held as fiefs, and dependent upon a superior. They were subject to
no burden, except the call to arms for national defence, and passed at
death to all the children equally, or, failing issue, to the next of
kin.

Alte Fritz.

Frederick the Great of Prussia is constantly referred to by this
sobriquet.

Althing.

The general assembly of the Norsemen. (
See also
Thing.)

Alumbrados.

A sect of mystics, founded in Spain about 1520, the forerunners of the
better known Illuminati of Germany. They were finally suppressed by the
Inquisition.

Amalfitan Code.

A code of maritime law, drawn up during the First Crusade by the
mercantile community of Amalfi. It is the oldest known maritime code.

Amboise, Conspiracy of.

A plot on the part of CondÃ© and the Bourbons, in 1560, to seize the
Guises, and the King, Francis II, who was a mere puppet in their hands.
The plot was discovered, and several of the leaders were executed.

Amboise, Convention of.

An agreement between Cathe
{8}
rine deâ Medici and the Huguenots in 1563,
after the first civil war, by which the Huguenots were allowed the free
exercise of their religion.

Amboyna, Massacre of.

The murder of ten Englishmen, in the employment of the India Company, at
the Dutch factory of Amboyna in 1623.

America Act.

An Act passed in 1775, consolidating all the previous penal acts
relating to the American Colonies. It declared that all American vessels
were lawful prizes, and that all Americans captured in them, or
elsewhere, could be forced to take service against America.
Commissioners were appointed to receive the submission of the revolted
colonies, but no provisions were made for the redress of grievances.

America, Discovery of.

According to the Norse Sagas, the discovery of America should be placed
to the credit of the Vikings, who made five expeditions to the coast
between 985 and 1011, the first being that of Eric the Red, who settled
in Greenland in 986, and the most famous that of Thorfinn Karlsefne,
about 1007. The rediscovery by Columbus took place in 1492.

American Customs Act.

An Act passed in 1764, levying customs duties on goods imported into the
American Colonies. These duties were to be levied for the benefit of
England, and the proceeds thereof paid into the English Treasury. The
assertion of this right to tax the Colonies for the benefit of the
Mother Country may be considered the cause of the loss of the American
Colonies.

American-Japanese Treaty.

A treaty negotiated between the ShÃ´gun and Commodore Perry on behalf of
the United States in 1854, by which Japan opened the ports of Yokohama,
Kobe, Nagasaki, and HakodatÃ© to foreign commerce. Foreigners had been
excluded from Japan for 216 years before this date, with the exception
of the Dutch, who however were strictly confined to their factory at
Deshima.

American-Spanish Treaty.

A treaty signed in 1898, at the close of the war, by which Spain
surrendered her sovereign rights over Cuba, and ceded Porto Rico and her
other West Indian possessions. The United States undertook to pay twenty
million dollars for the Philippines and Sulu Islands, but did not assume
any responsibility for the Cuban debt.

Ami des Hommes.

A sobriquet of the Marquis de Mirabeau (1715-1789).

Ami du Peuple.

Jean Paul Marat, the French revolutionary leader, was known as the
Friend of the People. It was also the title of the journal which he
edited.

Amiens, Award of.

The award of Louis IX of France, in 1264, in the dispute between Henry
III of England and his Barons, which had been referred to the
arbitration of the French King. He pronounced entirely in favour of the
Crown,
{9}
annulling the Provisions of Oxford, especially with regard to
the Kingâs right to employ aliens as governors of his castles. Also
known as the Mise of Amiens.

Amiens, Peace of.

A treaty signed by France and England, in 1801, after the defeat of the
French army in Egypt. England restored all her conquests from France,
Spain and Holland, excepting Ceylon and Trinidad. Both parties agreed to
the evacuation of Egypt, and the independence of Portugal was
guaranteed. This peace was of very short duration, England and France
being at war again in 1803.

Amistad Case.

The case of a Spanish slaver in 1839, in which the slaves had broken out
and seized the ship. She was afterwards captured by a U.S. cruiser, and
the Supreme Court declared that the seizure of the vessel by the slaves
was not an act of piracy.

Amour, Loi dâ.

The name ironically applied to a severely repressive measure against the
Press, introduced in the French Chamber by Peyronnet in 1827.

Amoureux, Guerre des.

The name given to the war between Henry III and Henry of Navarre in
1580. It arose purely out of a court intrigue, and its only event of
importance was the capture of Cahors by the Huguenots.

Ampoule, La Sainte.

The Holy Vase, containing the consecrated oil with which the French
kings were anointed at their coronation at Reims. It was preserved in
the Church of Saint Remi in that city.

Anabaptists.

A fanatical sect which had its rise in Westphalia, early in the
sixteenth century. In 1535 the Anabaptists seized the city of MÃ¼nster,
and under their leader Boccold, otherwise John of Leyden, who had
arrogated to himself royal prerogatives, they held out for some time
against the forces of the Bishop of MÃ¼nster. They were, however,
eventually overpowered, and their leaders put to death. Among other
extreme doctrines, they advocated communism and polygamy.

Anarchist Riots, Chicago.

Riots arising out of the Labour agitation in Chicago in the spring of
1886. The Anarchists took advantage of the disturbed condition of the
city, and in the course of a meeting which they summoned, a bomb was
thrown at the police, which was followed by shooting. Sixty police were
wounded. Seven of the rioters, mostly Germans, were convicted of murder.

Ancients, Council of.

The second chamber of the French Directory (1794-1799). It was composed
of 250 members.

Ancon, Treaty of.

A treaty of peace between Chile and Peru, putting an end to the War of
the Pacific, signed in 1883. Chile obtained by this treaty and one
concluded shortly afterwards with Bolivia, the coast region of the
latter state, and the district of Tarapaca in
{10}
Peru. She further secured
important concessions with regard to the guano deposits.

Andrassy Note.

A note of remonstrance prepared by Count Andrassy, the Austrian Foreign
Minister, and addressed to the Porte in 1876 by the Powers signatory of
the Treaty of Paris, insisting on Turkey fulfilling her engagements.

Anes, JournÃ©e des.

The name given by the French to the defeat of the Papal Army, under the
Duke of Urbino, near Bologna, on May 22, 1571, by the Bolognese and the
French men-at-arms. The name was given to this battle on account of the
enormous number of baggage animals captured.

Anglo-Chinese Agreement, 1902.

An agreement between Great Britain and China providing for the abolition
of
Likin
, and an increase of duties at the port of entry, to
compensate for the loss of revenue thus incurred. This agreement,
however, can only come into operation if the other nations having
commercial treaties with China agree to the increase of the import
duties.

Anglo-Dutch Treaty, 1872.

A treaty by which Holland surrendered to Great Britain all her
possessions on the Gold Coast.

Anglo-French Agreement, 1896.

An agreement with respect to Siam, by which Great Britain agreed to the
cession to France of Mongain, and a strip of territory, twenty-five
kilometres wide, on the right bank of the Mekong. Both parties agreed
not to invade the territory left to Siam by this arrangement, and it was
further stipulated that any commercial privileges in Yunnan and
Sze-Chuan accorded by China to either nation should be common to both.

Anglo-German Agreement, 1890.

An agreement, fixing the limits of the spheres of influence of the two
Powers in East, West, and South-West Africa, with the exception of the
southern limit of Walfisch Bay, left open for further inquiry. The
agreement further provided for the cession of Heligoland to Germany, and
the recognition by the latter of Great Britainâs protectorate over
Zanzibar.

Anglo-German Agreement, 1900.

An agreement, also known as the Yang-tse Agreement, signed May 16, 1900,
defining the policy of the two Powers in China. It was agreed to support
the policy of the âOpen Door,â and to permit free access for all nations
to the ports, rivers and littorals where the signatories have influence;
to refrain from seeking special territorial advantages, and to oppose
the grant of such to other Powers, the right being reserved to concert
measures in the event of such advantages being sought. Germany has since
declared that she does not consider this agreement to have any bearing
on the Russian occupation of Manchuria.

if the belligerent be attacked by a second Power, the other signatory
shall join her ally, and that the war shall thenceforward be conducted
in common, and peace made only by mutual agreement. It is further
stipulated that neither party shall enter into a separate agreement with
another Power, to the prejudice of the joint interests of the allies,
these interests being defined as the maintenance of the territorial
integrity of China and Korea, and the securing therein equal
opportunities for the commerce of all nations.

all nations, while Portugal agreed to facilitate communication by these
and other river and land routes.

Anglo-Russian Convention, 1825.

A convention by which it was agreed that both Powers should enjoy equal
fishing rights in the Pacific Ocean. A line of demarcation was also

of dissension between England and the United States, probably to be
ended by the Alaska Treaty of 1903.

An anti-Jewish crusade which broke out in Eastern Europe in the latter
part of the nineteenth century. It was especially virulent in Russia and
Austria, while in Germany an Anti-Semitic League was formed in Berlin in
1880, to âprevent the Judification of Germany.â The Judenhetze, as it
was called, was carried to such lengths as to call for the interference

persecution, thousands of Jews have emigrated from the Continent to
England and to the United States.

Apprenticeship (Transvaal).

This question was much debated in England in the early seventies, some
people alleging that the apprenticeship of black children was a covert
form of slavery, especially as indentures were transferable before a
landdrost. On the annexation of the country in 1877, however, it was
found that the charge was quite groundless.

Arabiâs Rebellion.

This revolt arose originally from a quarrel between the Circassian and
the Arab officers of the Egyptian Army in 1881. Three Arab colonels, one
of them Arabi, headed a successful mutiny, demanding a change at the
Ministry of War, which was controlled entirely by the Circassians. Later
in the year further trouble arose, and Arabi, supported by the whole
army, obtained the appointment of Under Secretary, and subsequently that
of War Minister. By June, 1882, he was practically a military dictator,
and commenced fortifying Alexandria. An ultimatum from the British
Government was without effect, and Alexandria was bombarded by the
British fleet. The defeat of Arabi at Tel-el-Kebir put an end to the
rebellion.

prisons and murdered all the prisoners. In this affair, which is known

contraband of war, and that a blockade must be effective to be
respected.

Armenian Massacres.

In 1895 and 1896 terrible massacres of the Armenians took place in
Anatolia, at the hands of the Kurds, who were probably aided, and
certainly not hindered, by the regular Turkish garrison. In 1896, on the
ground that a dangerous conspiracy was on foot, the authorities connived
at a massacre of Armenians in Constantinople, in which over two thousand

blance of order
in the disturbed districts.

seventeenth century, who dissented from the strict Calvinism of the

England, the two countries most immediately concerned, proved
irreconcilable, and no solution was arrived at.

Arras, Treaty of.

During the Congress of Arras, in 1435, France succeeded in detaching
Burgundy from the English alliance, and a treaty was signed by which the
Duke of Burgundy acknowledged the sovereignty of Charles VII, but
stipulated that he himself should be freed from personal homage during
his own and Charlesâ lifetime. In return his claim was admitted to the

innocence, and began an agitation which by degrees attracted the
attention of many eminent Frenchmen, among others Emile Zola, who took
up his cause with great warmth. Eventually the Government were forced to
submit the case to the Cour de Cassation, which quashed the conviction
and ordered a new trial. Dreyfus was brought back to France in 1899, and
tried by court-martial at Rennes. Though his innocence was generally
believed in outside France, he was again found guilty, but was almost
immediately pardoned by the President. The Case was the occasion of a
wild outburst of anti-semitism in France. In February, 1903, it was

East India Company.

The first charter to the Indian merchants was granted in 1600, and made
perpetual in 1609, a company being constituted under the title of the
India Company, with the monopoly of the Eastern trade. During the
Revolution a rival company was formed whose competition threatened to
extinguish the older Company, but eventually the two were amalgamated in
1708. As the field of operations in India was extended, political
questions became increasingly important, and such was the
maladministration of the Company, that the Government was constantly
forced to interfere. In 1773 a Regulating Act was passed, by which a new
council was appointed and other administrative reforms introduced, but
the consequent improvement was not marked, and in 1784 Pittâs India Bill
withdrew all political power from the hands of the Company, while
leaving their trading rights intact, and established a Board of Control,
to be appointed by the British Government. In 1813 the trading monopoly
of the Company was broken, so far as India was concerned, by the
admission of independent traders to the Companyâs territories, but they
still retained the China trade. In 1834, however, the restrictions on
trade still afforded by the Companyâs charter were felt to be out of
harmony with modern commercial ideas, and the whole of the Companyâs
trading rights were swept away, in return for an annuity, payable for
forty years, of Â£630,000, redeemable at the end of that period, at the
Governmentâs option, for a sum of Â£12,000,000. Before that period was
ended, however, the Indian Mutiny broke out, and on its suppression, in
1858, the Company was finally dissolved, and India passed under the
direct rule of the United Kingdom.

An Act passed in 1851 in response to the agitation caused by the action
of the Pope in appointing Cardinal Wiseman to the Roman Catholic
Archbishopric of Westminster. The Act declared the assumption of such
titles to be illegal, but provided no penalties for a breach of the law,
and hence was never enforced. It was repealed in 1871.

Economists.

A philosophical school, or sect, founded in France about 1761 by a
physician of Mantes, named Quesnay. He maintained that there was a
natural order of human institutions, divinely ordained, and that, if

agriculture was the only true source of wealth. These doctrines largely
influenced Turgot, the finance minister of Louis XVI.

found means to evade this law.

Employersâ Liability Bill, 1893.

A bill rendering employers liable for compensation to their workmen for
injuries received while at work. The bill was not passed, being wrecked
by the question of âcontracting out.â Many large employers of labour had
arrangements with their men, by which the latter contributed to an
assurance fund, maintained in the main by the employer, for the purpose
of providing compensation for injury, the men being bound, under these
conditions, not to take legal action for compensation. The House of
Commons passed a clause rendering such contracts illegal, but the Lords
inserted an amendment rendering them legal under certain safeguards as
to the amount of the employersâ contribution to the fund, etc. Neither
party would give way, and the bill was withdrawn.

Employersâ Liability Act, 1897.

An Act providing compensation for death or injury, to workmen or their

is bound to make up the amount.

most important enactment,
{90}
however, is that of 1878, which deals with

workshops. Regulations are made limiting the hours of employment of
women, young persons, and children, forbidding the carrying on of
certain trades by women, and providing for systematic inspection by
Government officials.

there and at certain points on the Sobat river. Sir Herbert Kitchener,
who had just captured Khartoum, invited Marchand to withdraw, and
hoisted the English and Egyptian flags. Marchand refusing, the matter
was referred to London and Paris. The French were at first inclined to
hold that, the Anglo-Egyptian occupation of the Soudan having been
suspended by the Mahdist domination, it was open to them to make a
settlement on the Nile. It was clearly proved, however, that they had
been warned on several occasions that this would not be permitted, and
after some hesitation, due probably to the doubt as to whether they
would have the support of Russia if they stood firm, they yielded, and
the Marchand expedition was withdrawn.

attempted a raid into Canada, which was entirely unsuccessful. In 1867 a
general rising in Ireland was planned, which also failed. Two further
unsuccessful attempts upon Canada took place in 1870 and 1871, from

certain portion of the coast for drying stations. France has for many
years sought to give a very wide interpretation to this use of the

long delay in coming to an agreement has caused much irritation in
Newfoundland.

circular was issued.

questions appertaining to church discipline. It was abolished by
Parliament in 1641, but reconstituted by James II in 1686, under the

persecution and extortion. Under pressure of the pending invasion of
William of Orange, James, in the last year of his reign, consented to
its abolition.

Hintchak.

An Armenian secret society, founded at Tiflis in 1887, to carry on a

clearly show that its aims were revolutionary, and it was largely
concerned in fomenting the disturbances which preceded the Armenian
massacres of 1895-6.

Hinterland Doctrine.

A doctrine enunciated by Germany to the effect that in newly-occupied
countries, such as East or West Africa, the possession of the coast line

the way into the interior.
{119}

Hlutdaw.

The old Burmese Council of Ministers. In 1886 five of the Ministers were

country was sufficiently advanced to permit of the board being
abolished.

The title of the Mahratta Maharajahs of Indore.

Holy Alliance.

An alliance formed between Russia, Austria and Prussia in September,
1815, by which the three sovereigns undertook that for the future their
policy should be guided solely by Christian principles. At the same time
there is no doubt that the alliance was intended to stem the tide of
political liberty, set flowing by the French Revolution, and their
threatened interference in the quarrel between Spain and her American
colonies, which was the cause of the enunciation of the Monroe doctrine,
is a sufficiently clear indication of this fact.

Holy Experiment.

The name given to William Pennâs experiment of establishing (in
Pennsylvania) a colony on the basis of absolute self-government, as a
free colony of all mankind.

Holy League.

A league formed by Pope Julius II in 1511, ostensibly for his protection

See
Inquisition.

Holy Roman Empire.

The Empire of the West, which had been destroyed by the barbarian
invasions, was to a great extent restored by Charlemagne, who was
crowned its first Emperor by Leo III in 800. After the extinction of the
Carlovingian line, the Emperors were exclusively German Princes, and
were elected to the throne by the sovereign rulers of certain German
States, though the Popes always claimed, and sometimes exercised, the
right of veto, by refusing to crown.
{120}
In 1272 the first Emperor of the
House of Hapsburg, Rudolf, was elected, and from 1438 the Emperors were
without exception members of this house, until the Empire was finally
broken up by Napoleon in 1806.

The first Home Rule Bill, introduced by Mr. Gladstone, providing for the
creation of a legislative body in Dublin, with control of the
administration, subject to safeguards as to the unity of the Empire, and
the protection of minorities. It was to have control of all taxation,
except of customs and excise, but was forbidden to legislate on any
matter relating to the crown, defence, or foreign relations, or to endow
any religious bodies. The Irish representation at Westminster was to be
abolished. The bill divided the Liberal Party, many of Mr. Gladstoneâs
Cabinet deserting him, including Lord Hartington, Sir Henry James, Mr.
Bright and Mr. Chamberlain, and consequently it failed to pass the
second reading. The general election which followed proved that the
country was strongly opposed to the scheme.

Home Rule Bill, 1893.

The second Home Rule Bill, introduced by Mr. Gladstone in 1893, was to a
great extent on the lines of the first bill, creating a Parliament in
Dublin, with legislative powers subject to certain reservations as to
peace and war, external affairs, etc. In one respect, however, it
differed widely, in that the Irish Parliamentary representation at
Westminster was not abolished, but merely reduced. The bill passed the
Commons after lengthy and acrimonious discussion, especially in
Committee, where Mr. Gladstone introduced the system of âClosure by
Compartments,â but was rejected by the Lords.

Home Rulers.

A party formed in 1873, under the leadership of Isaac Butt, to agitate

foreign ships, a salute to her flag in the narrow seas. The Dutch

English Admiral, and the action which followed led to the declaration of
war in July of the same year. The Dutch afterwards conceded the claim by
the Treaty of 1654.

Defenders,â and was given to the national champions in the early days of
Hungarian history.

their religion was denied them, many thousands of them emigrated to
England, Holland, and other Protestant countries.

A rising of the Hungarian national party under Kossuth, in 1848, owing
to the refusal of the Austrians to give any redress for the outrages of
the Croatian troops under Jellachich in the valleys of the Theiss and
the Danube. Kossuth was appointed Dictator by the Hungarian Diet, and
the rising was at first successful, but in 1849 the Austrians received
the assistance of a large Russian army, and in August of that year, the
Magyars were forced to surrender, and their leaders left the country.
General Hainau made himself notorious by his cruelties after the
collapse of the armed resistance.

The followers of John Huss, a professor of the University of Prague, who
had imbibed the Wycliffite doctrines. Though excommunicated by Pope
Alexander V in 1412, he continued to disseminate these doctrines,
{123}
and
was consequently summoned to the Council of Constance in 1414, where,
though under the Emperorâs safe-conduct, he was thrown into prison, and
subsequently burnt at the stake. His principal disciple, Jerome of
Prague, suffered the same fate in 1416, but his followers, under John
Zisca, rose in revolt against the Church, to the number of 40,000. They
destroyed some five hundred convents, and defeated the Emperor
Sigismund, but were broken up into sections in 1424, following upon
Ziscaâs death. They still, however, remained in insurrection until 1436,
when the revolt was ended by the treaty of Iglau.

Hyde Park Riots.

A riot which broke out in 1866, after the defeat of the Russell Ministry
over the Reform Bill of that year. A meeting had been summoned by the
Reform League, to meet in Hyde Park, but the Government prohibited the
meeting, and closed the park gates, whereupon the mob pulled down the
railings. Little other damage, however, was done, and the riot was
easily quelled.

Illicit Diamond Buying.

Iconoclasts.

This name was first given to the followers of Leo III, Emperor of the
East, who in 726 interdicted the worship of images. The opposition of a
considerable section of his subjects did not deter him from carrying his
principles into effect, and what is known as the Iconoclast War was the
result. The same title is applied to the more militant Huguenots in
France in 1560 and 1561, who, wherever they obtained the upper hand,
ruthlessly destroyed the statues which adorned the churches and
monasteries, and also to a section of the Puritans during the English
Civil War.

Iglau, Treaty of.

A treaty between the Hussites and the Emperor Sigismund, signed in 1436,

community, especially by planters and others living in remote districts.

Illicit Diamond Buying.

An illegal trade in diamonds carried on by certain speculators in
Kimberley, who purchased from the employÃ©s of the Diamond companies
rough diamonds which they had secreted in the process of washing. It was

generally known as I.D.B.

Illuminati.

A famous sect of German mystics, founded at Ingolstadt by Adam

of Bavaria in 1785.

Immigrants Restriction Bill.

A bill passed in 1901 by the Federal Parliament of Australia in response
to the outcry for a âWhite Australia.â It prohibits the immigration of
all coloured labour, including the South Sea Islanders, or Kanakas. This
restriction has caused much concern in Northern Queensland, where the
climate is not suitable for white labour, and its enforcement will
destroy the sugar and other industries and render the country almost
valueless.

Imparani, Treaty of.

A treaty signed in 1866 after the Basuto War of 1865-66 between the
Orange Free State and Molapo, the son of Moshesh. Molapo surrendered to

Thursday from 1627 to 1770. It was a summary of the offences against the

infringement of their rights, and it was in consequence of their
continued protests that Clement XIV ceased to promulgate it.

In Eminenti, Bull.

A Bull of Urban VII, issued in 1642, condemning the âAugustinusâ of

commercial rights under their Charter were not interfered with.

Indian National Congress.

An annual congress of natives of India, with some few Europeans, whose

A measure of toleration granted to the Scottish Presbyterians in 1669,
by which their ministers were permitted to preach in vacant parishes and

did nothing to reconcile the more bigoted members of the Church, who
continued their resistance to all State control. The Indulgence was soon
withdrawn.

{126}

Indulgences.

Forms of absolution granted by Leo X, which were openly sold by his
agents, the proceeds of the sale being devoted to the completion of St.

An association of working men, founded in London in 1864, the original
statutes of the society being drawn up by the German Socialist leader
Marx. It was intended as a centre of combination for all workmenâs

Church was passed by Mr. Gladstoneâs Government in 1869. The Irish
bishops lost their seats in the House of Lords, the Irish Ecclesiastical
Courts were abolished, and the union between the English and Irish
Churches dissolved. The future government of the Irish Church was
entrusted to a synod elected by the clergy and laity. Of the Church

Donum.

Irish Land Act, 1870.

An Act passed by Mr. Gladstoneâs Government giving for the first time a
legal status to the Ulster custom and extending it to all tenancies in

tenantâs, the onus of proof to the contrary being thrown upon the
landlord.

Irish Land Act, 1881.

This Act, passed in 1881, introduced the principle of judicial
interference between landlord and tenant. It permitted the sale of
tenant right and allowed the tenant to apply to the Court to fix a
judicial rent, such rent to hold good for fifteen years. It made certain
alterations, in the tenantâs favour, in the law relating to compensation
for improvements. It further established a Land Commission with power
(1) to advance money to tenants for the purchase of their holdings, and
(2) under certain conditions to purchase whole estates from the
landlords.

Irish Land Act, 1885.

An Act known as Lord Ashbourneâs Act, giving additional facilities for
the purchase by tenants of their holdings. An advance of Â£5,000,000 was
made to the Land Commissioners for this purpose, while the terms to
purchasers were more generous than those of the Bill of 1881. The
purchase money was to be
{129}
advanced at 4 per cent., and be repayable in
forty-nine years, while the surplus of the Disestablished Church funds
was to be used as a guarantee to the State against loss.

Irish Land Act, 1896.

An Act amending and consolidating the previous Land Acts and dealing
specially with the case of âTown Parks.â It introduced no new principle,
and though the Nationalists tried to secure the valuation of these
holdings at prairie value, the Government carried in the main their plan
for an equitable division between landlord and tenant of any increase of
value due to situation.

Irish Land Conference.

A conference held in Dublin in January, 1903, known also as the Dunraven
Conference, between representatives of the Irish Landlords and the
tenants, under the presidency of Lord Dunraven. The conference issued a
unanimous report recommending the abolition of dual ownership by means
of a comprehensive scheme of land purchase. They proposed that the
landlords should be bought out at a price based on their present income
from rent, and that the tenants should purchase at from 15 per cent. to
25 per cent. less, the balance being found by the State, which would
also advance the purchase money, to be repaid by instalments.

A mysterious personage whose face was always covered with an iron mask,
who was confined in the Bastille and other State prisons in France

practically opened the whole of Manchuria to Russian trade. Chang How,

other stipulations of the treaty of 1880 remaining practically
unaltered.

Minister to make at all times representations on behalf of the new
church in Constantinople, such representations to be taken into

{155}
evidence against Myles
Joyce, one of the men who had been hanged, and that he had been ordered

was defined, and the mode of summoning it prescribed in Magna Charta.

Magyars.

The original Turanian invaders of Pannonia, the modern Hungary. The name

the money for the militia.

February 27, 1881, which virtually closed the Boer War of that year. The
surrender of the British Government to the Boer demands is generally
known as the âMajuba Surrender,â and the bitter feeling thereby aroused
caused âRemember Majubaâ to be a sort of war-cry at the outbreak of the
war of 1899-1902. The Paardeberg surrender on the anniversary of Majuba
in 1900 was hailed as in some degree wiping out the disgrace attached to
the word.

In 1578 the Walloon troops of the Netherlands, being irri
{158}
tated by the
promulgation of the Religious Peace, and by their pay being in arrear,
mutinied under the leadership of the Seigneur de Montigny. Attempts to
appease them were fruitless, and eventually, with the support of the
nobles of Hainault and Artois, the mutiny ended in the formation of a
confederacy of the Walloon provinces, pledged to support the
Pacification of Ghent, and owning allegiance to Philip II.

Maletâs Plot.

A plot contrived by General Malet and the AbbÃ© Lafone, in 1812, to
dethrone Napoleon. By means of forged papers Malet persuaded a section

police ministry, where he arrested Savary, the minister, and the prefect

as the Pacte de Famine.

Dutch.

A cavalry charge through a crowded meeting which was being held in St.
Peterâs Field, Manchester, in connexion with the Reform agitation in
1819. Many persons were injured. The accident, for it practically
amounted to no more, was entirely due to the mismanagement of the
magistrates, who attempted to arrest the agitator, Hunt, while on the
platform in the centre of the meeting. This affair is also called,
derisively, âPeterloo.â

Manchester School.

A political and economic school, which was responsible for the formation

used for the gates and roofs of the houses in Manoa.

Manor Court.

active steps to coerce them.

required ransom, which had been provided, had been handed over to the
brigands and the prisoners released.

against the Spanish Viceroy in July, 1647. The revolt was completely
successful, and the Viceroy was compelled to come to terms with

success, as he was guilty of the most extraordinary excesses, and was
murdered by his former followers in the course of the month in which the
rising took place.

Mason and Dixonâs Line.

The line delimiting Delaware and Maryland, drawn by Mason and Dixon in
1764-67. It is often erroneously referred to as the line between the

from Newgate to Tyburn and back, and died under the lash.

the suspected intention of the Holy Alliance to interfere on behalf of
Spain in her struggle with her revolted colonies. Various
interpretations have been given to this doctrine, some, like that of Mr.
Olney, going much further than President Monroeâs words warrant, but it
is now generally held to mean that the United States will consider her
interests involved, if any European Power seeks territorial
aggrandisement in any part of America, or interferes with the internal
affairs of any American State.

cause on the Pacific Slope. It was of course a forgery.

Mormons.

A sect founded by Joseph Smith, the son of a Vermont farmer, in 1830, at
Fayette, New York State. The Mormons moved westward and, after several
yearsâ wanderings, settled on the Great Salt Lake in 1847, under Brigham

Mormons in 1890, and Utah was admitted a State in 1896.

the upper tiers of seats in the Convention.

Mountain Meadow Massacre.

The massacre by Indians, under Mormon leadership, of a party of 140

government was established in 1845.

landing by Hoche was attempted at Bantry Bay. This was unsuccessful, and
a little later Humbert, who landed at Killala, was forced to surrender
to Lord Cornwallis. Horrible outrages were perpetrated by the rebels,
and the consequent reprisals gave a most bloodthirsty character to the
whole affair. The rebels were finally defeated at Vinegar Hill, which
put an end to all organized resistance, though there were a few isolated
risings from time to time. Wolfe Tone was captured and condemned to
death, but escaped the scaffold by suicide. Fitzgerald was killed a few
days before the outbreak, resisting the military who were about to
arrest him.

nothing very serious occurred. At the Nore the mutiny assumed a

interfere on the American Continent, and that, if force was necessary,
British Guiana must rely on her own resources, without calling in aid
from Great Britain. He further maintained that the United States had a
right to insist upon all claims concerning questions of territory being

strictly moderate, that native opinion made no demand for restriction,
that any interference with the growing of opium in the native states
would be unjustifiable, and that the Government of China was perfectly
satisfied with the existing arrangements as to the opium trade. There
was, therefore, in the opinion of the commissioners, absolutely no
ground for legislative interference.

Opium War.

The war with China in 1840 is so called, because it arose out of the
action of the Chinese authorities, who in their efforts to stop opium

Foochow, Ningpo and Shanghai as treaty ports.

territories of the allies, granted the right of reprisals against
Tuscany, Naples, Dalmatia and the Ionian Islands, declared a blockade
against all ports from which the English flag was excluded, and finally

half Savoy, towards the Alps. Mauritius was surrendered to England, who
retained Malta and the Cape of Good Hope. The independence of the German
and Swiss states, and of the Italian states outside the Austrian
dominions was proclaimed. Holland, under the rule of the Prince of
Orange, was to receive an accession of territory, which, by a secret

formed the basis for discussion at the Congress which met immediately
afterwards at Vienna to settle the affairs of Europe.

A commission appointed by Act of Parliament in 1888 to try the charges
brought against Mr. Parnell by the
Times
in their articles âParnellism
and Crime.â The gravamen of these charges was that Parnell and other
Irish leaders were insincere in their condemnation of agrarian crime,
and they were based on a series of letters sold to the
Times
by a
certain Pigott. In one of these letters Mr. Parnell wrote that Mr.
Burke, who was murdered in PhÅnix Park, had only got his deserts. Under
cross-examination Pigott broke down, and confessed that the letters were

the graver charges, but considered their complicity in much of the
lawlessness of the Land League clearly proved.

Bavaria, the least powerful of the three claimants. France was to

persuaded to execute a will leaving the whole of his dominions to the
Bavarian Prince.

Partition Treaty, Second.

The death of the Elector of Bavaria having rendered the First Partition
Treaty of no effect, a second treaty was signed by the same three powers
in 1700. By this instrument Spain, the Netherlands and the Indies were
assigned to the

correspondence would more than compensate for the loss occasioned by the
lowering of the rates.

knowledge of it. Certain information reaching the police, the
conspirators and many who were entirely innocent were arrested. Among
other innocent victims was the young Duc dâEnghien, son of the Prince de

manifesto, known as the Declaration of Pilnitz, declaring that the
position of the King of France was a matter of interest to all
sovereigns, and that if the European rulers united to aid Louis, they
would combine with them for the purpose. The price of Prussiaâs
co-operation in this movement was a secret undertaking on the part of
Austria not to interfere with her proceedings in Poland.

indifference.

and undertook not to interfere in Indian affairs.

Poor Law Acts.

The first Act dealing with this question was passed in the reign of
Elizabeth in 1572, and was followed by other enactments which were
consolidated in the Act of 1601. By this Act rogues and vagabonds were
severely dealt with, but workhouses were provided for the relief of the
deserving poor, and parish officers, known as Overseers, appointed to
superintend the working of the Act. This Act of Elizabeth continued in
force till the Poor Law Act of 1832. By that time numerous abuses had
crept into the administration of the Poor Law, resulting in the complete
pauperisation of many parishes, owing largely to the stringency of the
regulations against vagabondage having been relaxed. By the new Act, the
separation between the two classes was rendered definite, relief was
only to be granted to the able-bodied in return for labour, and children
were separated from adult paupers. The machinery was in the main left
unchanged, but small parishes were formed into Unions, and a central
Board of Control was established.

English clergyman, who had been admitted into the Jesuit order. It is
possible that there may have been some such scheme on foot, but the
so-called revelations of Oates and his fellow-informers were nothing but
a tissue of absurdities. Unfortunately, the murder by some person
unknown of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, before whom Oates made his first
deposition, so inflamed the popular mind that no justice could be
expected, and five Catholic peers denounced by Oates were sent to the
Tower, while many innocent priests and others were condemned and
executed.

Popular Sovereignty.

The political doctrine in the United States that the question of negro
slavery was one for each Territory or State to decide for itself. It was

IV. The Spaniards accepted the situation, without any effort to maintain
their authority.

An Act introduced by Sir Edward Poyning, and passed in 1495, which
declared that no Irish Parliament should be convoked until its programme
of legislation had been sanctioned by the English Privy Council, and
attested by the Great Seal. It was afterwards a source of endless
complications between the Irish and English Governments, as it limited
the absolute power of the Lord Lieutenant, and rendered impossible any
policy of the English colony in Ireland to which the Mother Country was
opposed. This Act was temporarily repealed in 1689, re-enacted in 1691,
and finally rescinded in 1782.

Praemunire, Statute of.

Bishops was to be free of Papal control.

Saxony. The latter, in return, agreed to aid Austria in expelling the
Swedes from Germany, thus scandalously deserting his northern ally.

Prague, Treaty of.

most outrageous extortion, the officials forcing on the natives
commodities they did not need, at exorbitant prices. In 1780 the
misconduct of those officials brought about a rising of Indians, under
Condorcanqui, an Inca Cacique, who, however, was captured by the
Spaniards and put to death. The revolt was continued by his cousin,
Andres, the last of the Incas, who captured Sorate,

two questions. In the mining States of the West the question which is

rather an academical than an acute question.

observe the compact, and before the death of Frederick VII of Denmark,

the succession of Christian IX, Austria and Prussia, finding protests

certain prominent Conservatives and the delegates of the Council of
Skilled Workmen, on the subject of social reform. As the âpointsâ
included a statutory eight hoursâ day, free places of amusement and full

signed it, including Lords Salisbury, Lorne and Carnarvon.

a lower rate of interest than they had been paying to the annuitants.

subsequent collapse thousands were ruined.

marriage would prove unfruitful. At the same time the Queenâs sister,
the Infanta, was to be married to the Duc de Montpensier, with the
object of eventually placing the Crown of Spain on the head of a French
Prince. Palmerston proposed that the second marriage should be postponed
until the Queen had issue, to which the King feigned assent, but
meanwhile he and his minister, Guizot, worked on the Queen Regent to
consent to the marriages taking place at once, and they were duly
solemnized, causing great indignation in England.

Spanish Succession, War of the.

A war arising out of the bequest of the Spanish Crown to Philip, Duke of
Anjou, in 1700, by Charles II of Spain, who had left no direct heir. The
Grand Alliance of England, Holland and the Empire was promptly formed to

campaign in Flanders, and the overrunning of Spain by the Archduke
Charles followed, but in 1713 Philip was recognized by the Allies as
King of Spain, and the war ended.

became notorious. It was abolished by Act of Parliament in 1641.

notorious Erie Ring led to a crusade against the party, headed by the

New York Times
, and an inquiry disclosed wholesale jobbery and

Council held on the day that Mr. Disraeli was to introduce the Bill, it
was found that Ministers were not in agreement, and there were only ten
minutes left to decide what was to be done. It happened that a Bill had
been prepared, proposing a milder measure of reform, and this it was
decided to introduce. It met with little approval from any section, and

some time afterwards told by Sir John Pakington to his constituents, and
the makeshift Bill was promptly christened the Ten Minutes Bill.

Napoleon in 1809.

The will led to protracted litigation, and the resulting accumulation
was consequently much less than had been anticipated.

An assembly of Catholic and Protestant divines, held at Westminster in
1559, to discuss certain points of dogma and ritual. The questions set
for discussion were: the use of prayer in a tongue not understood by the

these meetings led to disorder and obstruction of the traffic, they were
prohibited by Sir Charles Warren, the Chief Commissioner of Police. The
Socialists insisted on their right to hold the meetings, and the
disturbances culminated on Sunday, November 13th, when a number of

end of that month, though it seems evident that the actual moment chosen

thousands unquestionably perished.

Tyrconel,
{264}

Union with Ireland.

The Act of Union with Ireland was finally passed in 1800. Resolutions in
favour of it had been submitted to the Irish Parliament in 1799, and
though supported in the main by the Irish Catholics, they were opposed
by Grattan, Curran and other Irish leaders, and rejected. Pitt was
determined that in the interests of both countries the union must take
place, and, the Irish Parliament having been dissolved, he succeeded by
unlimited bribery in securing a Parliament containing a majority pledged
to vote for the union. This Parliament met in 1800, and the necessary
resolution was passed by a majority of forty-six.

Union with Scotland.

The Parliamentary Union between the two kingdoms was agreed to in 1706,
the terms being settled by commissioners, thirty-one on each side,
appointed for the purpose. The basis of the agreement was that there
should be one kingdom, one Parliament and one Suc
{266}

Kingdom. The confirming Act was passed by the Scots Parliament in 1706,

{267}
passed in 1535,

terms with Charles I in 1645. Negotiations were opened at Uxbridge, the
Parliamentary demands being the abolition of Episcopacy, the
continuation of the war in Ireland, and the control by Parliament of the
Army and Navy and of appointments to the great offices of State. The
King withdrew from the negotiations, owing to the dissensions in
Parliament between the Independents and Presbyterians, which he
anticipated would eventually enable him to obtain better terms.

Vaal, Treaty of the.

A treaty between the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, signed in
1857, after President Pretoriusâ abortive invasion of the Free State.
The two countries mutually acknowledged each otherâs independence, with

of Pretorius in his attempt to interfere with the internal Government of
the Free State, while the Free State undertook to use every endeavour to

accord to burghers of
{268}

born German was eligible as a member, or FreischÃ¶ffe, and many German
Princes were initiated. The powers of the Vehmgerichte were greatly
curtailed by Maximilian, the original purpose of these tribunals having
been overshadowed by their employment as vehicles of private vengeance,
and they gradually lost all influence, till they were finally dissolved
by Jerome Buonaparte in 1811.

Vellore, Mutiny of.

In January 1895 Venezuelan troops crossed the Cuyuni river, part of the
Schomburgk line,
{269}
into British Guiana, and hoisted the Venezuelan flag
in territory which had been occupied by the British colonists for many
years. Obtaining no redress, Lord Salisbury issued an ultimatum,
whereupon Venezuela appealed to the United States to intervene, in
support of the Monroe doctrine. President Cleveland and Mr. Olney took a
high hand, and went the length of appointing an American Commission to
examine into the boundary question. After long negotiation arbitration
was agreed upon, and a treaty settling the details was signed in
February 1897. The award of the arbitrators was issued in 1899, and
practically confirmed the British claim to the Schomburgk line, but gave
Venezuela Barima Point, at the mouth of the Orinoco, and a tract of

out the rest of his scheme. The plot failed, and Venner and other
leaders were arrested, but only after a desperate resistance.

Verdun, Treaty of.

A treaty signed in 843, after a short conflict, by the three sons of

divided. This treaty marks the division of the Frankish nation into
French and Germans.

Vereeniging Conference.

The conference of Boer leaders held at Vereeniging in May 1902, at which

burghers from all judicial proceedings except for acts contrary to the
usages of war, the use of the Dutch language in the schools, if

of the country, and a loan of unstated amount, on easy terms, for the
same purpose.

Vernacular Press Act.

An Act passed in India in
{270}
1878 to control native newspapers publishing

simply confirmed the provisions of the Treaty of Peace of 1782.

Vervins, Treaty of.

A treaty signed in 1598 between Henri IV of France and Philip II of
Spain, after the recovery by Henri of Amiens, which had fallen into the

Victorian Deadlocks.

These were three in number, caused by attempts to tack on to the
Appropriation Bill resolutions of a controversial character. The first
occurred in 1865, when the Legislative Council refused to pass the
Appropriation Bill with certain tariff resolutions of a protective
character appended. The Governor thereupon declined to sign warrants for
payments out of the Treasury, and the business of the country was at a
standstill. The Government, however, got out of the difficulty by having
recourse to the banks. The second or great deadlock arose from the
inclusion in the Appropriation Bill of a grant of Â£20,000 to Sir Charles
Darling, the retiring Governor, in 1867. This was ended by the refusal
of Sir Charles, in July 1868, to accept the grant. The third arose in
1877 over the
{271}
question of payment of members, the council again
refusing to pass the Appropriation Bill with this provision tacked on.
The Government thereupon dismissed a large number of civil servants. A
compromise was, however, arrived at, and the officials reinstated. The
day on which the dismissals took place is known as Black Wednesday.

Vienna Congress.

A congress of the Great Powers, held in 1814-15, at which Great Britain,

additional provisions: one-third of the kingdom of Saxony was
surrendered to Prussia; the Duchy of Posen was retained by Prussia, and
part of Galicia by Austria, while Russia secured the rest of Poland; the
Bourbons were restored in Naples, the Tyrol was given back to Austria,
and certain arrangements made as to the minor German and Italian States.
The Congress further pronounced in favour of the free navigation of
rivers, and of the suppression of the slave trade.

Vienna Conference.

A conference of the four Great Powers, held in 1853, with the object of
mediating between Russia and Turkey. A note was drawn up which was
accepted by Russia, but refused by Turkey, the Sultan declining to admit
that Russiaâs championship alone maintained the Greek Church in his
dominions. During the sitting of the conference Turkey declared war. It
being found impossible to bring the antagonists to terms, the conference
was dissolved.

Vienna, Definitive Peace of.

A treaty signed in 1738 by Austria, France, Spain and Sardinia, after
the War of the Polish Succession. By its provisions Lorraine was ceded

Tuscany. Spain retained Naples and Sicily, and Sardinia obtained Novara
and Tortona, and some other frontier towns.

Vienna, Peace of.

A treaty between France and Austria, signed in 1809 after the defeat of

the Continental Blockade.

Vienna, Treaty of, 1725.

however, a further secret treaty, binding both countries to assist in
the restoration of the Stuarts, while Austria promised aid in compelling
the return of Gibraltar and Minorca, by force if necessary.
{272}

VilÃ¡gos, Surrender of.

The surrender of the Magyars at the end of the Hungarian War of
Independence in 1849. It was negotiated between General GÃ¶rgey and the
Russian General Paskievitch, and it is said on good authority, though
there is no documentary evidence to prove it, that GÃ¶rgey was induced to
consent to the surrender by the promise that no Hungarian officer should
be given up to the Austrians, and that Russia would undertake to secure
independence for the Magyars under a Russian Prince. The promise, if
ever made, was certainly not kept, and the Austrians tried and executed
many of the Magyar leaders.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License.  You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

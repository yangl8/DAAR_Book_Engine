THE GREAT WAR

AS A MEMORY FOR AFTER YEARS

Â
THE ROUGH ROAD

CHAPTER I

This
is the story of Doggie Trevor. It tells of
his doings and of a girl in England and a girl
in France. Chiefly it is concerned with the influences
that enabled him to win through the war. Doggie
Trevor did not get the Victoria Cross. He got no
cross or distinction whatever. He did not even attain
the sorrowful glory of a little white cross above his
grave on the Western Front. Doggie was no hero of
romance, ancient or modern. But he went through
with it and is alive to tell the tale.

The brutal of his acquaintance gave him the name
of âDoggieâ years before the war was ever thought
of, because he had been brought up from babyhood
like a toy Pom. The almost freak offspring of elderly
parents, he had the rough world against him from
birth. His father died before he had cut a tooth.
His mother was old enough to be his grandmother.
She had the intense maternal instinct and the brain,
such as it is, of an earwig. She wrapped Doggieâhis
real name was James Marmadukeâin cotton-wool,
and kept him so until he was almost a grown
man. Doggie had never a chance. She brought him
up like a toy Pom until he was twenty-oneâand then
she died. Doggie being comfortably off, continued
the maternal tradition and kept on bringing himself

Â
up like a toy Pom. He did not know what else to
do. Then, when he was five-and-twenty, he found
himself at the edge of the world gazing in timorous
starkness down into the abyss of the Great War.
Something kicked him over the brink and sent him
sprawling into the thick of it.

That the world knows little of its greatest men
is a commonplace among silly aphorisms. With far
more justice it may be stated that of its least men the
world knows nothing and cares less. Yet the Doggies
of the War, who on the cry of âHavoc!â have been
let loose, much to their own and everybody elseâs
stupefaction, deserve the passing tribute sometimes,
poor fellows, of a sigh, sometimes of a smile, often
of a cheer. Very few of themâvery few, at any
rate, of the English Doggiesâhave tucked their little
tails between their legs and run away. Once a brawny
humorist wrote to Doggie Trevor â
Sursum cauda.
â
Doggie happened to be at the time in a water-logged
front trench in Flanders and the writer basking in the
mild sunshine of Simla with his Territorial regiment.
Doggie, bidden by the Hedonist of circumstance to
up with his tail, felt like a scorpion.

Such feelings, however, will be more adequately
dealt with hereafter. For the moment, it is only
essential to obtain a general view of the type to which
Trevor belonged.

If there is one spot in England where the present
is the past, where the future is still more of the past,
where the past wraps you and enfolds you in the
dreamy mist of Gothic beauty, where the lazy meadows
sloping riverward deny the passage of the centuries,
where the very clouds are secular, it is the cathedral

Â
town of Durdlebury. No factory chimneys defile with
their smoke its calm air, or defy its august and heaven-searching
spires. No rabble of factory hands shocks
its few and sedate streets. Divine Providence, according
to the devout, and the crass stupidity of the local
authorities seventy years ago, according to progressive
minds, turned the main line of railway twenty miles
from the sacred spot. So that to this year of grace it
is the very devil of a business to find out, from Bradshaw,
how to get to Durdlebury, and, having found,
to get there. As for getting away, God help you!
But whoever wanted to get away from Durdlebury,
except the Bishop? In pre-motor days he used to
grumble tremendously and threaten the House of
Lords with Railway Bills and try to blackmail the
Government with dark hints of resignation, and so he
lived and threatened and made his wearisome diocesan
round of visits and died. But now he has his episcopal
motor-car, which has deprived him of his grievances.

In the Close of Durdlebury, greenswarded, silent,
sentinelled by immemorial elms that guard the dignified
Gothic dwellings of the cathedral dignitaries, was
James Marmaduke Trevor born. His father, a man
of private fortune, was Canon of Durdlebury. For
many years he lived in the most commodious canonical
house in the Close with his sisters Sophia and Sarah.
In the course of time a new Dean, Dr. Conover,
was appointed to Durdlebury, and, restless innovator
that he was, underpinned the North Transept and
split up Canon Trevorâs home by marrying Sophia.
Then Sarah, bitten by the madness, committed abrupt
matrimony with the Rev. Vernon Manningtree, Rector
of Durdlebury. Canon Trevor, many years older
than his sisters, remained for some months in bewildered
loneliness, until one day he found himself standing

Â
in front of the cathedral altar with Miss Mathilda
Jessup, while the Bishop pronounced over them words
diabolically strange yet ecclesiastically familiar. Miss
Jessup, thus transformed into Mrs. Trevor, was a
mature and comfortable maiden lady of ample means,
the only and orphan daughter of a late Bishop of Durdlebury.
Never had there been such a marrying and
giving in marriage in the cathedral circle. Children
were born in Decanal, Rectorial and Canonical homes.
First a son to the Manningtrees, whom they named
Oliver. Then a daughter to the Conovers. Then
a son, named James Marmaduke, after the late Bishop
Jessup, was born to the Trevors. The profane say
that Canon Trevor, a profound patristic theologian
and an enthusiastic palÃ¦ontologist, couldnât make head
or tail of it all, and, unable to decide whether James
Marmaduke should be attributed to Tertullian or the
Neolithic period, expired in an agony of dubiety. At
any rate, the poor man died. The widow, of necessity,
moved from the Close, in order to make way for the
new Canon, and betook herself with her babe to
Denby Hall, the comfortable house on the outskirts of
the town in which she had dwelt before her marriage.

The saturated essence of Durdlebury ran in Marmadukeâs
blood: an honourable essence, a proud essence;
an essence of all that is statically beautiful and dignified
in English life; but an essence which, without
admixture of wilder and more fluid elements, is apt
to run thick and clog the arteries. Marmaduke was
coddled from his birth. The Dean, then a breezy,
energetic man, protested. Sarah Manningtree protested.
But when the Deanâs eldest born died of
diphtheria, Mrs. Trevor, in her heart, set down the
death as a judgment on Sophia for criminal carelessness;
and when young Oliver Manningtree grew up

Â
to be an intolerable young Turk and savage, she looked
on Marmaduke and, thanking heaven that he was
not as other boys were, enfolded him more than ever
beneath her motherly wing. When Oliver went to
school in the town and tore his clothes, and rolled in
mud and punched other boysâ heads, Marmaduke
remained at home under the educational charge of a
governess. Oliver, lean and lanky and swift-eyed,
swaggered through the streets unattended from the
first day they sent him to a neighbouring kindergarten.
As the months and years of his childish life
passed, he grew more and more independent and vagabond.
He swore blood brotherhood with a butcher-boy
and, unknown to his pious parents, became the
leader of a ferocious gang of pirates. Marmaduke,
on the other hand, was never allowed to cross the
road without feminine escort. Oliver had the profoundest
contempt for Marmaduke. Being two years
older, he kicked him whenever he had a chance.
Marmaduke loathed him. Marmaduke shrank into
Miss Gunter, the governessâs, skirts whenever he saw
him. Mrs. Trevor therefore regarded Oliver as the
youthful incarnation of Beelzebub, and quarrelled
bitterly with her sister-in-law.

One day, Oliver, with three or four of his piratical
friends, met Marmaduke and Miss Gunter and a little
toy terrier in the High Street. The toy terrier was
attached by a lead to Miss Gunter on the one side,
Marmaduke by a hand on the other. Oliver straddled
rudely across the path.

âHallo! Look at thet two little doggies!â he
cried. He snapped his fingers at the terrier. âCome
along, Tiny!â The terrier yapped. Oliver grinned
and turned to Marmaduke. âCome along, Fido,
dear little doggie.â

Â
âYouâre a nasty, rude, horrid boy, and I shall tell
your mother,â declared Miss Gunter indignantly.

But Oliver and his pirates laughed with the truculence
befitting their vocation, and bowing with ironical
politeness, let their victim depart to the parody of a
popular song: âGood-bye, Doggie, we shall miss
you.â

From that day onwards Marmaduke was known
as âDoggieâ throughout all Durdlebury, save to his
mother and Miss Gunter. The Dean himself grew
to think of him as âDoggie.â People to this day
call him Doggie, without any notion of the origin of
the name.

To preserve him from persecution, Mrs. Trevor
jealously guarded him from association with other boys.
He neither learned nor played any boyish games. In
defiance of the doctor, whom she regarded as a member
of the brutal anti-Marmaduke League, Mrs. Trevor
proclaimed Marmadukeâs delicacy of constitution. He
must not go out into the rain, lest he should get damp,
nor into the hot sunshine, lest he should perspire.
She kept him like a precious plant in a carefully warmed
conservatory. Doggie, used to it from birth, looked
on it as his natural environment. Under feminine
guidance and tuition he embroidered and painted
screens and played the piano and the mandolin, and
read Miss Charlotte Yonge and learned history from
the late Mrs. Markham. Without doubt his life was
a happy one. All that he asked for was sequestration
from Oliver and his associates.

Now and then the cousins were forced to meetâat
occasional childrenâs parties, for instance. A little
daughter, Peggy, had been born in the Deanery, replacing
the lost firstborn, and festivalsâto which came
the extreme youth of Durdleburyâwere given in her

Â
honour. She liked Marmaduke, who was five years
her senior, because he was gentle and clean and wore
such beautiful clothes and brushed his hair so nicely;
whereas she detested Oliver, who, even at an afternoon
party, looked as if he had just come out of a
rabbit-hole. Besides, Marmaduke danced beautifully;
Oliver couldnât and wouldnât, disdaining such effeminate
sports. His great joy was to put out a sly leg
and send Doggie and his partner sprawling. Once the
Dean caught him at it, and called him a horrid little
beast, and threatened him with neck and crop expulsion
if he ever did it again. Doggie, who had picked
himself up and listened to the rebuke, said:

âIâm very glad to hear you talk to him like that,
Uncle. I think his behaviour is perfectly detestable.â

The Deanâs lips twitched and he turned away
abruptly. Oliver glared at Doggie.

âOh, my holy aunt!â he whispered hoarsely.
âJust you wait till I get you alone!â

Oliver got him alone, an hour later, in a passage,
having lain in ambush for him, and after a few busy
moments, contemplated a bruised and bleeding Doggie
blubbering in a corner.

âDo you think my behaviour is detestable now?â

âYes,â whimpered Doggie.

âIâve a good mind to go on licking you until you
say âno,ââ said Oliver.

âYouâre a great big bully,â said Doggie.

Oliver reflected. He did not like to be called a
bully. âLook here,â said he, âIâll stick my right
arm down inside the back of my trousers and fight
you with my left.â

âI donât want to fight. I canât fight,â cried
Doggie.

Oliver put his hands in his pockets.

Â
âWill you come and play Kiss-in-the-Ring, then?â
he asked sarcastically.

âNo,â replied Doggie.

âWell, donât say I havenât made you generous
offers,â said Oliver, and stalked away.

It was all very well for the Rev. Vernon Manningtree,
when discussing this incident with the Dean,
to dismiss Doggie with a contemptuous shrug and
call him a little worm without any spirit. The unfortunate
Doggie remained a human soul with a human
destiny before him. As to his lack of spiritââ

âWhere,â said the Dean, a man of wider sympathies,
âdo you suppose he could get any from? Look at
his parentage. Look at his upbringing by that idiot
woman.â

âIf he belonged to me, Iâd drown him,â said the
Rector.

âIf I had my way with Oliver,â said the Dean,
âIâd skin him alive.â

âIâm afraid heâs a young devil,â said the Rector,
not without paternal pride. âBut he has the makings
of a man.â

âSo has Marmaduke,â replied the Dean.

âBosh!â said Mr. Manningtree.

When Oliver went to Rugby, happier days than
ever dawned for Marmaduke. There were only the
holidays to fear. But as time went on, the haughty
contempt of Oliver, the public-school boy, for the
home-bred Doggie, forbade him to notice the little
creatureâs existence; so that even the holidays lost
their gloomy menace and became like the normal
halcyontide. Meanwhile Doggie grew up. When
he reached the age of fourteen, the Dean, by strenuous
endeavour, rescued him from the unavailing tuition

Â
of Miss Gunter. But school for Marmaduke Mrs.
Trevor would not hear of. It was brutal of Edwardâthe
Deanâto suggest such a thing. Marmadukeâso
sensitive and delicateâschool would kill him.
It would undo all the results of her unceasing care.
It would make him coarse and vulgar, like other horrid
boys. She would sooner see him dead at her feet
than at a public school. It was true that he ought
to have the education of a gentleman. She did not
need Edward to point out her duty. She would
engage a private tutor.

âAll right. Iâll get you one,â said the Dean.

The Master of his old college at Cambridge sent
him an excellent youth, who had just taken his degreeâa
second class in the Classical Triposâan all-round
athlete and a gentleman. The first thing he did
was to take Marmaduke on the lazy river that flowed
through the Durdlebury meadows, thereby endangering
his life, woefully blistering his hands, and making
him ache all over his poor little body. After a quarter
of an hourâs interview with Mrs. Trevor, the indignant
young man threw up his post and departed.

Mrs. Trevor determined to select a tutor herself.
A scholastic agency sent her a dozen candidates. She
went to London and interviewed them all. A woman,
even of the most limited intelligence, invariably knows
what she wants, and invariably gets it. Mrs. Trevor
got Phineas McPhail, M.A. Glasgow, B.A. Cambridge
(Third Class Mathematical Greats), reading for Holy
Orders.

âI was training for the ministry in the Free Kirk
of Scotland,â said he, âwhen I gradually became aware
of the error of my ways, and saw that there could only
be salvation in the episcopal form of Church government.
As the daughter of a bishop, Mrs. Trevor,

Â
you will appreciate my conscientious position. An
open scholarship and the remainder of my little patrimony
enabled me to get my Oxford degree. You
would have no objection to my continuing my theological
studies while I undertake the education of
your son?â

Phineas McPhail pleased Mrs. Trevor. He had
what she called a rugged, honest Scotch face, with a
very big nose in the middle of it, and little grey eyes
overhung by brown and shaggy eyebrows. He spoke
with the mere captivating suggestion of an accent.
The son of decayed, proud, and now extinct gentlefolk,
he presented personal testimonials of an unexceptionable
quality.

Phineas McPhail took to Doggie and Durdlebury
as a duck to water. He read for Holy Orders for
seven years. When the question of his ordination
arose, he would declare impressively that his sacred
duty was the making of Marmaduke into a scholar
and a Christian. That duty accomplished, he would
begin to think of himself. Mrs. Trevor accounted
him the most devoted and selfless friend that woman
ever had. He saw eye to eye with her in every detail
of Marmadukeâs upbringing. He certainly taught the
boy, who was naturally intelligent, a great deal, and
repaired the terrible gaps in Miss Gunterâs system of
education. McPhail had started life with many eager
curiosities, under the impulse of which he had amassed
considerable knowledge of a superficial kind which,
lolling in an arm-chair, with a pipe in his mouth,
he found easy to impart. To the credit side of Mrs.
Trevorâs queer account it may be put that she did not
object to smoking. The late Canon smoked incessantly.
Perhaps the odour of tobacco was the only
keen memory of her honeymoon and brief married life.

Â
During his seven years of soft living, Phineas McPhail
scientifically developed an original taste for whisky.
He seethed himself in it as the ancients seethed a kid
in its motherâs milk. He had the art to do himself
to perfection. Mrs. Trevor beheld in him the mellowest
and blandest of men. Never had she the slightest
suspicion of evil courses. To such a pitch of cunning
in the observance of the proprieties had he arrived,
that the very servants knew not of his doings. It
was only laterâafter Mrs. Trevorâs deathâwhen a
surveyor was called in by Marmaduke to put the old
house in order, that a disused well at the back of the
house was found to be half filled with hundreds of
whisky bottles secretly thrown in by Phineas McPhail.

The Dean and Mr. Manningtree, although ignorant
of McPhailâs habits, agreed in calling him a lazy
hound and a parasite on their fond sister-in-law. And
they were right. But Mrs. Trevor turned a deaf
ear to their slanders. They were unworthy to be
called Christian men, let alone ministers of the Gospel.
Were it not for the sacred associations of her father
and her husband, she would never enter the cathedral
again. Mr. McPhail was exactly the kind of tutor
that Marmaduke needed. Mr. McPhail did not
encourage him to play rough games, or take long
walks, or row on the river, because he appreciated his
constitutional delicacy. He was the only man in the
world during her unhappy widowhood who understood
Marmaduke. He was a treasure beyond price.

When Doggie was sixteen, fate, fortune, chance, or
whatever you like to call it, did him a good turn. It
made his mother ill, and sent him away with her to
foreign health resorts. Doggie and McPhail travelled
luxuriously, lived in luxurious hotels and visited in
luxurious ease various picture galleries and monuments

Â
of historic or Ã¦sthetic interest. The boy, artistically
inclined and guided by the idle yet well-informed
Phineas, profited greatly. Phineas sought profit to
them both in other ways.

âMrs. Trevor,â said he, âdonât you think it a
sinful shame for Marmaduke to waste his time over
Latin and mathematics, and such things as he can
learn at home, instead of taking advantage of his
residence in a foreign country to perfect himself in
the idiomatic and conversational use of the language?â

Mrs. Trevor, as usual, agreed. So thenceforward,
whenever they were abroad, which was for three or
four months of each year, Phineas revelled in sheer
idleness, nicotine, and the skilful consumption of
alcohol, while highly paid professors taught Marmadukeâand,
incidentally, himselfâFrench and Italian.

Of the world, however, and of the facts, grim or
seductive, of life, Doggie learned little. Whether by
force of some streak of honesty, whether through
sheer laziness, whether through canny self-interest,
Phineas McPhail conspired with Mrs. Trevor to keep
Doggie in darkest ignorance. His reading was selected
like that of a young girl in a convent: he was taken
only to the most innocent of plays: foreign theatres,
casinos, and such-like wells of delectable depravity,
existed almost beyond his ken. Until he was twenty
it never occurred to him to sit up after his mother had
gone to bed. Of strange goddesses he knew nothing.
His mother saw to that. He had a mild affection
for his cousin Peggy, which his mother encouraged.
She allowed him to smoke cigarettes, drink fine claret,
the remains of the cellar of her father, the bishop, a
connoisseur, and
crÃ¨me de menthe
. And, until she
died, that was all poor Doggie knew of the lustiness
of life.

Â
Mrs. Trevor died, and Doggie, as soon as he had
recovered from the intensity of his grief, looked out
upon a lonely world. Phineas, like Mrs. Micawber,
swore he would never desert him. In the perils of
Polar exploration or the comforts of Denby Hall, he
would find Phineas McPhail ever by his side. The
first half-dozen or so of these declarations consoled
Doggie tremendously. He dreaded the Church
swallowing up his only protector and leaving him
defenceless. Conscientiously, however, he said:

âI donât want your affection for me to stand in
your way, sir.â

ââSirâ?â cried Phineas, âis it not practicable for
us to do away with the old relations of master and pupil,
and become as brothers? You are now a man, and
independent. Let us be Pylades and Orestes. Let
us share and share alike. Let us be Marmaduke and
Phineas.â

Doggie was touched by such devotion. âBut your
ambitions to take Holy Orders, which you have sacrificed
for my sake?â

âI think it may be argued,â said Phineas, âthat
the really beautiful life is delight in continued sacrifice.
Besides, my dear boy, I am not quite so sure
as I was when I was young, that by confining
oneself within the narrow limits of a sacerdotal
profession, one can retain all oneâs wider sympathies
both with human infirmity and the gladder things of
existence.â

âYouâre a true friend, Phineas,â said Doggie.

âI am,â replied Phineas.

It was just after this that Doggie wrote him a
cheque for a thousand pounds on account of a vaguely
indicated yearâs salary.

If Phineas had maintained the wily caution which

Â
he had exercised for the past seven years, all might
have been well. But there came a time when unneedfully
he declared once more that he would never
desert Marmaduke, and declaring it, hiccoughed so
horribly and stared so glassily, that Doggie feared he
might be ill. He had just lurched into Doggieâs own
peacock-blue and ivory sitting-room when he was
mournfully playing the piano.

âYouâre unwell, Phineas. Let me get you something.â

âYouâre right, laddie,â Phineas agreed, his legs
giving way alarmingly, so that he collapsed on a
brocade-covered couch. âItâs a touch of the sun,
which I would give you to understand,â he continued
with a self-preservatory flash, for it was an overcast
day in June, âis often magnified in power when it
is behind a cloud. A wee drop of whisky is what I
require for a complete recovery.â

Doggie ran into the dining-room and returned with
a decanter of whisky, glass and siphonâan adjunct
to the sideboard since Mrs. Trevorâs death. Phineas
filled half the tumbler with spirit, tossed it off, smiled
fantastically, tried to rise, and rolled upon the carpet.
Doggie, frightened, rang the bell. Peddle, the old
butler, appeared.

âMr. McPhail is ill. I canât think what can be
the matter with him.â

Peddle looked at the happy Phineas with the eyes
of experience.

âIf you will allow me to say so, sir,â said he, âthe
gentleman is dead drunk.â

And that was the beginning of the end of Phineas.
He lost grip of himself. He became the scarlet scandal
of Durdlebury and the terror of Doggieâs life. The
Dean came to the rescue of a grateful nephew. A

Â
swift attack of delirium tremens crowned and ended
Phineas McPhailâs Durdlebury career.

âMy boy,â said the Dean on the day of Phineasâs
expulsion, âI donât want to rub it in unduly, but Iâve
warned your poor mother for years, and you for months,
against this bone-idle, worthless fellow. Neither of
you would listen to me. But you see that I was right.
Perhaps now you may be more inclined to take my
advice.â

âYes, Uncle,â replied Doggie submissively.

The Dean, a comfortable florid man in the early
sixties, took up his parable and expounded it for three-quarters
of an hour. If ever young man heard that
which was earnestly meant for his welfare, Doggie
heard it from his Very Reverend Uncleâs lips.

âAnd now, my dear boy,â said the Dean by way
of peroration, âyou cannot but understand that it is
your bounden duty to apply yourself to some serious
purpose in life.â

âI do,â said Doggie. âIâve been thinking over
it for a long time. Iâm going to gather material for
a history of wall-papers.â

Â

CHAPTER II

Thenceforward
Doggie, like the late Mr.
Matthew Arnoldâs fellow-millions, lived alone.
He did not complain. There was little to complain
about. He owned a pleasant old house set in fifteen
acres of grounds. He had an income of three thousand
pounds a year. Old Peddle, the butler, and his wife,
the housekeeper, saved him from domestic cares.
Rising late and retiring early, like the good King of
Yvetot, he cheated the hours that might have proved
weary. His meals, his toilet, his music, his wall-papers,
his drawing and embroideringâspecimens of the last
he exhibited with great success at various shows held
by Arts and Crafts Guilds, and such-like high and
artistic fellowshipsâhis sweet-peas, his chrysanthemums,
his postage stamps, his dilettante reading and
his mild social engagements, filled most satisfyingly
the hours not claimed by slumber. Now and then
appointments with his tailor summoned him to London.
He stayed at the same mildewed old family hotel in
the neighbourhood of Bond Street at which his mother
and his grandfather, the bishop, had stayed for uncountable
years. There he would lunch and dine
stodgily in musty state. In the evenings he would
go to the plays discussed in the less giddy of Durdlebury
ecclesiastical circles. The play over, it never
occurred to him to do otherwise than drive decorously
back to Sturrocksâs Hotel. Suppers at the Carlton
or the Savoy were outside his sphere of thought or

Â
opportunity. His only acquaintance in London were
vague elderly female friends of his mother, who invited
him to chilly semi-suburban teas and entertained him
with tepid reminiscence and criticism of their divers
places of worship. The days in London thus passed
drearily, and Doggie was always glad to get home
again.

In Durdlebury he began to feel himself appreciated.
The sleepy society of the place accepted him as a young
man of unquestionable birth and irreproachable morals.
He could play the piano, the harp, the viola, the flute,
and the clarinet, and sing a very true mild tenor. As
secretary of the Durdlebury Musical Association, he
filled an important position in the town. Dr. FlintâJoshua
Flint, Mus. Doc.âorganist of the cathedral,
scattered broadcast golden opinions of Doggie. There
was once a concert of old English music, which the
dramatic critics of the great newspapers attendedâand
one of them mentioned DoggieââMr. Marmaduke
Trevor, who played the viol da gamba as to the manner
born.â Doggie cut out the notice, framed it, and
stuck it up in his peacock and ivory sitting-room.

Besides music, Doggie had other social accomplishments.
He could dance. He could escort young
ladies home of nights. Not a dragon in Durdlebury
would not have trusted Doggie with untold daughters.
With women, old and young, he had no shynesses. He
had been bred among them, understood their purely
feminine interests, and instinctively took their point of
view. On his visits to London, he could be entrusted
with commissions. He could choose the exact shade
of silk for a drawing-room sofa cushion, and had an
unerring taste in the selection of wedding presents.
Young men, other than budding ecclesiastical dignitaries,
were rare in Durdlebury, and Doggie had little to

Â
fear from the competition of coarser masculine natures.
In a word, Doggie was popular.

Although of no mean or revengeful nature, he
was human enough to feel a little malicious satisfaction
when it was proved to Durdlebury that Oliver had
gone to the devil. His Aunt Sarah, Mrs. Manningtree,
had died midway in the Phineas McPhail period;
Mr. Manningtree a year or so later had accepted a
living in the North of England, and died when Doggie
was about four-and-twenty. Meanwhile Oliver, who
had been withdrawn young from Rugby, where he
had been a thorn in the side of the authorities, and
had been pinned like a cockchafer to a desk in a family
counting-house in Lothbury, E.C., had broken loose,
quarrelled with his father, gone off with paternal
malediction and a maternal heritage of a thousand
pounds to California, and was lost to the family ken.
When a man does not write to his family, what explanation
can there be save that he is ashamed to do so?
Oliver was ashamed of himself. He had taken to
desperate courses. He was an outlaw. He had gone
to the devil. His name was rarely mentioned in
Durdleburyâto Marmaduke Trevorâs very great and
catlike satisfaction. Only to the Deanâs ripe and
kindly wisdom was his name not utterly anathema.

âMy dear,â said he once to his wife, who was
deploring her nephewâs character and fateââI have
hopes of Oliver even yet. A man must have something
of the devil in him if he wants to drive the devil out.â

Mrs. Conover was shocked. âMy dear Edward!â
she cried.

âMy dear Sophia,â said he, with a twinkle in his
mild blue eyes that had puzzled her from the day
when he first put a decorous arm round her waist.
âMy dear Sophia, if you knew what a ding-dong scrap

Â
of fiends went on inside me before I could bring myself
to vow to be a virtuous milk-and-water parson, your
hair, which is as long and beautiful as ever, would
stand up straight on end.â

Mrs. Conover sighed.

âI give you up.â

âItâs too late,â said the Dean.

The Manningtrees, father and mother and son,
were gone. Doggie bore the triple loss with equanimity.
Then Peggy Conover, hitherto under the
eclipse of boarding-schools, finishing schools and foreign
travel, swam, at the age of twenty, within his orbit.
When first they met, after a yearâs absence, she very
gracefully withered the symptoms of the cousinly kiss,
to which they had been accustomed all their lives,
by stretching out a long, frank, and defensive arm.
Perhaps if she had allowed the salute, there would have
been an end of the matter. But there came the
phenomenon which, unless she was a minx of craft
and subtlety, she did not anticipate; for the first
time in his life he was possessed of a crazy desire to
kiss her. Doggie fell in love. It was not a wild
consuming passion. He slept well, he ate well, and
he played the flute without a sigh causing him to
blow discordantly into the holes of the instrument.
Peggy vowing that she would not marry a parson, he
had no rivals. He knew not even the pinpricks of
jealousy. Peggy liked him. At first she delighted
in him as in a new and animated toy. She could pull
strings and the figure worked amazingly and amusingly.
He proved himself to be a useful toy, too.
He was at her beck all day long. He ran on errands,
he fetched and carried. Peggy realized blissfully that
she owned him. He haunted the Deanery.

Â
One evening after dinner the Dean said:

âI am going to play the heavy father. How are
things between you and Peggy?â

Marmaduke, taken unawares, reddened violently.
He murmured that he didnât know.

âYou ought to,â said the Dean. âWhen a young
man converts himself into a girlâs shadow, even although
he is her cousin and has been brought up with
her from childhood, people begin to gossip. They
gossip even within the august precincts of a stately
cathedral.â

âIâm very sorry,â said Marmaduke. âIâve had
the very best intentions.â

The Dean smiled.

âWhat were they?â

âTo make her like me a little,â replied Marmaduke.
Then, feeling that the Dean was kindly disposed, he
blurted out awkwardly: âI hoped that one day I
might ask her to marry me.â

âThatâs what I wanted to know,â said the Dean.

âYou havenât done it yet?â

âNo,â said Marmaduke.

âWhy donât you?â

âIt seems taking such a liberty,â replied Marmaduke.

The Dean laughed. âWell, Iâm not going to do
it for you. My chief desire is to regularize the present
situation. I canât have you two running about together
all day and every day. If you like to ask
Peggy, you have my permission and her motherâs.â

âThank you, Uncle Edward,â said Marmaduke.

âLet us join the ladies,â said the Dean.

In the drawing-room the Dean exchanged glances
with his wife. She saw that he had done as he had
been bidden. Marmaduke was not an ideal husband

Â
for a brisk, pleasure-loving modern young woman.
But where was another husband to come from?
Peggy had banned the Church. Marmaduke was
wealthy, sound in health and free from vice. It was
obvious to maternal eyes that he was in love with
Peggy. According to the Dean, if he wasnât, he
oughtnât to be for ever at her heels. The young
woman herself seemed to take considerable pleasure
in his company. If she cared nothing for him, she
was acting in a reprehensible manner. So the Dean
had been deputed to sound Marmaduke.

Half an hour later the young people were left alone.
First the Dean went to his study. Then Mrs. Conover
departed to write letters. Marmaduke advancing
across the room from the door which he had opened,
met Peggyâs mocking eyes as she stood on the hearthrug
with her hands behind her back. Doggie felt
very uncomfortable. Never had he said a word to
her in betrayal of his feelings. He had a vague idea
that propriety required a young man to get through
some wooing before asking a girl to marry him. To
ask first and woo afterwards seemed putting the cart
before the horse. But how to woo that remarkably
cool and collected young person standing there, passed
his wit.

âWell,â she said, âthe dear old birds seem very
fussy to-night. Whatâs the matter?â And as he
said nothing, but stood confused with his hands in his
pockets, she went on. âYou, too, seem rather ruffled.
Look at your hair.â

Doggie, turning to a mirror, perceived that an
agitated hand had disturbed the symmetry of his sleek
black hair, brushed without a parting away from the
forehead over his head. Hastily he smoothed down
the cockatoo-like crest.

Â
âIâve been talking to your father, Peggy.â

âHave you really?â she said with a laugh.

Marmaduke summoned his courage.

âHe told me I might ask you to marry me,â he
said.

âDo you want to?â

âOf course I do,â he declared.

âThen why not do it?â

But before he could answer, she clapped her hands
on his shoulders, and shook him, and laughed out loud.

âOh, you dear silly old thing! What a way to
propose to a girl!â

âIâve never done such a thing before,â said Doggie,
as soon as he was released.

She resumed her attitude on the hearthrug.

âIâm in no great hurry to be married. Are you?â

He said: âI donât know. Iâve never thought of
it. Just whenever you like.â

âAll right,â she returned calmly. âLet it be a
year hence. Meanwhile, we can be engaged. Itâll
please the dear old birds. I know all the tabbies in
the town have been mewing about us. Now they
can mew about somebody else.â

âThatâs awfully good of you, Peggy,â said Marmaduke.
âIâll go up to town to-morrow and get you
the jolliest ring you ever saw.â

She sketched him a curtsy. âThatâs one thing,
at any rate, I can trust you inâyour taste in jewellery.â

He moved nearer to her. âI suppose you know,
Peggy dear, Iâve been awfully fond of you for quite a
long time.â

âThe feeling is more or less reciprocated,â she
replied lightly. Then, âYou can kiss me if you
like. I assure you itâs quite usual.â

He kissed her somewhat shyly on the lips.

Â
She whispered: âI do think I care for you, old
thing.â Marmaduke replied sententiously: âYou
have made me a very happy man.â Then they sat
down side by side on the sofa, and for all Peggyâs
mocking audacity, they could find nothing in particular
to say to each other.

âLet us play patience,â she said at last.

And when Mrs. Conover appeared awhile later,
she found them poring over the cards in a state of
unruffled calm. Peggy looked up, smiled, and nodded.

âWeâve fixed it up, Mummy; but weâre not
going to be married for a year.â

Doggie went home that evening in a tepid glow.
It contented him. He thought himself the luckiest
of mortals. A young man with more passion or
imagination might have deplored the lack of romance
in the betrothal. He might have desired on the part
of the maiden either more shyness, delicacy, and elusiveness,
or more resonant emotion. The finer tendrils
of his being might have shivered, ready to shrivel, as
at a touch of frost, in the cool ironical atmosphere
which the girl had created around her. But Doggie
was not such a young man. Such passions as heredity
had endowed him with had been drugged by training.
No tales of immortal love had ever fired his blood.
Once, somewhere abroad, the unprincipled McPhail
found him reading
Manon Lescaut
âhe had bought
a cheap copy haphazardâand taking the delectable
volume out of his hands, asked him what he thought
of it.

âItâs like reading about a lunatic,â replied the
bewildered Doggie. âDo such people as Des Grieux
exist?â

âAy, laddie,â replied McPhail, greatly relieved.
âYour acumen has pierced to the root of the matter.

Â
They do exist, but nowadays we put them into asylums.
We must excuse the author for living in the psychological
obscurity of the eighteenth century. Itâs just
a silly, rotten book.â

âIâm glad youâre of the same opinion as myself,â
said Doggie, and thought no more of the absurd but
deathless pair of lovers. The unprincipled McPhail,
not without pawky humour, immediately gave him

Paul et Virginie
, which Doggie, after reading it,
thought the truest and most beautiful story in the
world. Even in later years, when his intelligence
had ripened and his sphere of reading expanded, he
looked upon the passion of a Romeo or an Othello
as a conventional peg on which the poet hung his
imagery, but having no more relation to real life as
it is lived by human beings than the blood-lust of the
half-man, half-bull Minotaur, or the uncomfortable
riding conversation of the Valkyrie.

So Doggie Trevor went home perfectly contented
with himself, with Peggy Conover, with his Uncle
and Aunt, of whom hitherto he had been just a little
bit afraid, with Fortune, with Fate, with his house,
with his peacock and ivory room, with a great clump
of typescript and a mass of coloured proof-prints,
which represented a third of his projected history of
wall-papers, with his feather-bed, with Goliath, his
almost microscopic Belgian griffon, with a set of
Nile-green silk underwear that had just come from
his outfitters in London, with his new Rolls-Royce
car and his new chauffeur Briggins (parenthetically
it may be remarked that a seven-hour excursion in
this vehicle, youth in the back seat and Briggins at the
helm, all ordained by Peggy, had been the final cause
of the eveningâs explanations), with the starry heavens
above, with the well-ordered earth beneath them,

Â
and with all human beings on the earth, including
Germans, Turks, Infidels, and Hereticksâall save
one: and that, as he learned from a letter delivered
by the last post, was a callous, heartless London manicurist
who, giving no reasons, regretted that she would
be unable to pay her usual weekly visit to Durdlebury
on the morrow. Of all days in the year: just when it
was essential that he should look his best!

âWhat the deuce am I going to do?â he cried,
pitching the letter into the waste-paper basket.

He sat down to the piano in the peacock and ivory
room and tried to play the nasty crumpled rose-leaf
of a manicurist out of his mind.

Suddenly he remembered, with a kind of shock,
that he had pledged himself to go up to London the
next day to buy an engagement-ring. So after all
the manicuristâs defection did not matter. All was
again well with the world.

Then he went to bed and slept the sleep of the just
and perfect man living the just and perfect life in a
just and perfect universe.

And the date of this happening was the fifteenth
day of July in the year of grace one thousand nine
hundred and fourteen.

Â

CHAPTER III

The
shadow cast by the great apse of the cathedral
slanted over the end of the Deanery
garden, leaving the house in the blaze of the afternoon
sun, and divided the old red-brick wall into a vivid
contrast of tones. The peace of centuries brooded
over the place. No outside convulsions could ever
cause a flutter of her calm wings. As it was thirty
years ago, when the Dean first came to Durdlebury,
as it was three hundred, six hundred years ago, so it
was now; and so it would be hundreds of years
hence as long as that majestic pile housing the Spirit
of God should last.

Thus thought, thus, in some such words, proclaimed
the Dean, sitting in the shade, with his hands clasped
behind his head. Tea was over. Mrs. Conover,
thin and faded, still sat by the little table, wondering
whether she might now blow out the lamp beneath
the silver kettle. Sir Archibald Bruce, a neighbouring
landowner, and his wife had come, bringing their
daughter Dorothy to play tennis. The game had
already started on the court some little distance offâthe
players being Dorothy, Peggy and a couple of
athletic, flannel-clad parsons. Marmaduke Trevor
reposed on a chair under the lee of Lady Bruce.
He looked very cool and spick and span in a grey
cashmere suit, grey shirt, socks and tie, and grey

suÃ¨de
shoes. He had a weak, good-looking little
face and a little black moustache turned up at the

Â
ends. He was discoursing to his neighbour on
Palestrina.

The Deanâs proclamation had been elicited by some
remark of Sir Archibald.

âI wonder how you have stuck it for so long,â
said the latter. He had been a soldier in his youth
and an explorer, and had shot big game.

âI havenât your genius, my dear Bruce, for making
myself uncomfortable,â replied the Dean.

âYou were energetic enough when you first came
here,â said Sir Archibald. âWe all thought you a
desperate fellow who was going to rebuild the cathedral,
turn the Close into industrial dwellings, and
generally play the deuce.â

The Dean sighed pleasantly. He had snowy
hair and a genial, florid, clean-shaven face.

âI was appointed very youngâsix-and-thirtyâand
I thought I could fight against the centuries.
As the years went on I found I couldnât. The
grey changelessness of things got hold of me, incorporated
me into them. When I dieâfor I hope
I shanât have to resign through doddering senilityâmy
body will be buried thereââhe jerked his head
slightly towards the cathedralââand my dust will
become part and parcel of the fabricâlike that of many
of my predecessors.â

âThatâs all very well,â said Sir Archibald, âbut
they ought to have caught you before this petrification
set in, and made you a bishop.â

It was somewhat of an old argument, for the two
were intimates. The Dean smiled and shook his head.

âYou know I declinedâââ

âAfter you had become petrified.â

âPerhaps so. It is not a place where ambitions
can attain a riotous growth.â

Â
âI call it a rotten place,â said the elderly worldling.
âI wouldnât live in it myself for twenty thousand a year.â

âLots like you said the same in crusading timesâSir
Guy de Chevenix, for instance, who was the
Lord, perhaps, of your very Manor, and an amazing
fire-eaterâbutâsee the gentle irony of itâthere his
bones lie, at peace for ever, in the rotten place, with
his effigy over them cross-legged and his dog at his
feet, and his wife by his side. I think he must sometimes
look out of Heavenâs gate down on the cathedral
and feel glad, gratefulâperhaps a bit wistfulâif the
attribution of wistfulness, which implies regret, to a
spirit in Paradise doesnât savour of heresyâââ

âIâm going to be cremated,â interrupted Sir
Archibald, twirling his white moustache.

The Dean smiled and did not take up the cue.
The talk died. It was a drowsy day. The Dean
went off into a little reverie. Perhaps his old friendâs
reproach was just. Dean of a great cathedral at
thirty-six, he had the world of dioceses at his feet.
Had he used to the full the brilliant talents with
which he started? He had been a good Dean,
a capable, business-like Dean. There was not a
stone of the cathedral that he did not know and cherish.
Under his care the stability of every part of the precious
fabric had been assured for a hundred years. Its
financial position, desperate on his appointment,
was now sound. He had come into a scene of petty
discords and jealousies; for many years there had
been a no more united chapter in any cathedral close
in England. As an administrator he had been a
success. The devotion of his life to the cathedral
had its roots deep in spiritual things. For the greater
glory of God had the vast edifice been erected, and
for the greater glory of God had he, its guardian,

Â
reverently seen to its preservation and perfect appointment.
Would he have served God better by pursuing
the ambitions of youth? He could have had his
bishopric; but he knew that the choice lay between
him and Chanways, a flaming spirit, eager for power,
who hadnât the sacred charge of a cathedral, and he
declined. And now Chanways was a force in the
Church and the country, and was making things hum.
If he, Conover, after fifteen years of Durdlebury,
had accepted, he would have lost the power to make
things hum. He would have made a very ordinary,
painstaking bishop, and his successor at Durdlebury
might possibly have regarded that time-worn wonder
of spiritual beauty merely as a stepping-stone to higher
sacerdotal things. Such a man, he considered, having
once come under the holy glamour of the cathedral,
would have been guilty of the Unforgivable Sin.
He had therefore saved two unfortunate situations.

âYou are quite an intelligent man, Bruce,â he
said, with a sudden whimsicality, âbut I donât think
you would ever understand.â

The set of tennis being over, Peggy, flushed and
triumphant, rushed into the party in the shade.

âMr. Petherbridge and I have wonâsixâthree,â
she announced. The old gentlemen smiled and
murmured their congratulations. She swung to
the tea-table some paces away, and plucked Marmaduke
by the sleeve, interrupting him in the middle
of an argument. He rose politely.

âCome and play.â

âMy dear,â he said, âIâm such a duffer at games.â

âNever mind; youâll learn in time.â

He drew out a grey silk handkerchief as if ready
to perspire at the first thought of it. âTennis makes
one so dreadfully hot,â said he.

Â
Peggy tapped the point of her foot irritably, but
she laughed as she turned to Lady Bruce.

âWhatâs the good of being engaged to a man if
he canât play tennis with you?â

âThere are other things in life besides tennis,
my dear,â replied Lady Bruce.

The girl flushed, but being aware that a pert answer
turneth away pleasant invitations, said nothing. She
nodded and went off to her game, and informing Mr.
Petherbridge that Lady Bruce was a platitudinous
old tabby, flirted with him up to the nice limits of
his parsonical dignity. But Marmaduke did not mind.

âGames are childish and somewhat barbaric.
Donât you think so, Lady Bruce?â

âMost young people seem fond of them,â replied
the lady. âExercise keeps them in health.â

âIt all depends,â he argued. âOften they get
exceedingly hot, then they sit about and catch their
death of cold.â

âThatâs very true,â said Lady Bruce. âItâs
what Iâm always telling Sir Archibald about golf.
Only last week he caught a severe chill in that very
way. I had to rub his chest with camphorated oil.â

âJust as my poor dear mother used to do to me,â
said Marmaduke.

There followed a conversation on ailments and
their treatment, in which Mrs. Conover joined.
Marmaduke was quite happy. He knew that the
two elderly ladies admired the soundness of his views
and talked to him as to one of themselves.

âIâm sure, my dear Marmaduke, youâre very wise
to take care of yourself,â said Lady Bruce, âespecially
now, when you have the responsibilities of married
life before you.â

Marmaduke curled himself up comfortably in his

Â
chair. If he had been a cat, he would have purred.
The old butler, grown as grey in the service of the
Deanery as the cathedral itselfâhe had been page
and footman to Dr. Conoverâs predecessorâremoved
the tea-things and brought out a tray of glasses and
lemonade with ice clinking refreshingly against the
sides of the jug. When the game was over, the players
came and drank and sat about the lawn. The shadow
of the apse had spread over the garden to the steps
of the porch. Anyone looking over the garden wall
would have beheld a scene typical of the heart of
Englandâa scene of peace, ease and perfectly ordered
comfort. The two well-built young men, one a
minor canon, the other a curate, lounging in their
flannels, clever-faced, honest-eyed, could have been
bred nowhere but in English public schools and at
Oxford or Cambridge. The two elderly ladies were
of the fine flower of provincial England; the two old
men, so different outwardly, one burly, florid, exquisitely
ecclesiastical, the other thin, nervous, soldierly,
each was an expression of high English tradition.
The two young girls, unerringly correct and dainty,
for all their modern abandonment of attitude, pretty,
flushed of cheek, frank of glance, were two of a
hundred thousand flowers of girlhood that could have
been picked that afternoon in lazy English gardens.
And Marmadukeâs impeccable grey costume struck a
harmonizing English note of Bond Street and the
Burlington Arcade. The scent of the roses massed in
delicate splendour against the wall, and breathing now
that the cool shade had fallen on them, crept through
the still air to the flying buttresses and the window
mullions and traceries and the pinnacles of the great
English cathedral. And in the midst of the shaven
lawn gleamed the old cut-glass jug on its silver tray.

Â
Some one did look over the wall and survey the
scene: a man, apparently supporting himself with
tense, straightened arms on the coping; a man with
a lean, bronzed, clean-shaven face, wearing an old
soft felt hat at a swaggering angle; a man with a smile
on his face and a humorous twinkle in his eyes. By
chance he had leisure to survey the scene for some time
unobserved. At last he shouted:

âHello! Have none of you ever moved for the
last ten years?â

At the summons every one was startled. The
young men scrambled to their feet. The Dean rose
and glared at the intruder, who sprang over the wall,
recklessly broke through the rose-bushes and advanced
with outstretched hand to meet him.

âHello, Uncle Edward!â

âGoodness gracious me!â cried the Dean. âItâs
Oliver!â

âRight first time,â said the young man, gripping
him by the hand. âYouâre not looking a day older.
And Aunt Sophiaâââ He strode up to Mrs. Conover
and kissed her. âDo you know,â he went on,
holding her at armâs length and looking round at
the astonished company, âthe last time I saw you
all you were doing just the same! I peeped over the
wall just before I went away, just such a summer
afternoon as this, and you were all sitting round
drinking the same old lemonade out of the same
old jugâand, Lady Bruce, you were here, and you,
Sir Archibaldââhe shook hands with them rapidly.
âYou havenât changed a bit. And youâgood Lord!
Is this Peggy?â He put his hand on the Deanâs
shoulder and pointed at the girl.

âThatâs Peggy,â said the Dean.

âYouâre the only thing thatâs grown. I used to

Â
gallop with you on my shoulders all round the lawn.
I suppose you remember? How do you do?â

And without waiting for an answer he kissed her
soundly. It was all done with whirlwind suddenness.
The tempestuous young man had scattered every oneâs
wits. All stared at him. Releasing Peggyââ

âMy holy aunt!â he cried, âthereâs another of
âem. Itâs Doggie! You were in the old picture,
and Iâm blessed if you werenât wearing the same
beautiful grey suit. How do, Doggie?â

He gripped Doggieâs hand. Doggieâs lips grew
white.

âIâm glad to welcome you back, Oliver,â he said.
âBut I would have you to know that my name is
Marmaduke.â

âSooner be called Doggie myself, old chap,â said
Oliver.

He stepped back, smiling at them allâa handsome
devil-may-care fellow, tall, tough and supple, his hands
in the pockets of a sun-stained double-breasted blue
jacket.

âWeâre indeed glad to see you, my dear boy,â
said the Dean, recovering equanimity; âbut what
have you been doing all this time? And where on
earth have you come from?â

âIâve just come from the South Seas. Arrived in
London last evening. This morning I thought Iâd
come and look you up.â

âBut if you had let us know you were coming,
we should have met you at the station with the car.
Whereâs your luggage?â

He jerked a hand. âIn the road. My manâs
sitting on it. Oh, donât worry about him,â he cried
airily to the protesting Dean. âHeâs well trained.
Heâll go on sitting on it all night.â

Â
âYouâve brought a manâa valet?â asked Peggy.

âIt seems so.â

âThen you must be getting on.â

âI donât think he turns you out very well,â said
Doggie.

âYou must really let one of the servants see about
your things, Oliver,â said Mrs. Conover, moving
towards the porch. âWhat will people say?â

He strode after her, and kissed her. âOh, you
dear old Durdlebury Aunt! Now I know Iâm in
England again. I havenât heard those words for
years!â

Mrs. Conoverâs hospitable intentions were anticipated
by the old butler, who advanced to meet them
with the news that Sir Archibaldâs car had been brought
round. As soon as he recognized Oliver he started
back, mouth agape.

âYes, itâs me all right, Burford,â laughed Oliver.
âHow did I get here? I dropped from the moon.â

He shook hands with Burford, of whose life he
had been the plague during his childhood, proclaimed
him as hardy and unchanging as a gargoyle, and
instructed him where to find man and luggage.

The Bruces and the two clerical tennis players
departed. Marmaduke was for taking his leave too.
All his old loathing of Oliver had suddenly returned.
His cousin stood for everything he detestedâswagger,
arrogance, self-assurance. He hated the shabby
rakishness of his attire, the self-assertive aquiline beak
of a nose which he had inherited from his father, the
Rector. He dreaded his aggressive masculinity. He
had come back with the same insulting speech on his
lips. His finger-nails were dreadful. Marmaduke
desired as little as possible of his odious company.
But his Aunt Sophia cried out:

Â
âYouâll surely dine with us to-night, Marmaduke,
to celebrate Oliverâs return?â

And Oliver chimed in, âDo! And donât worry
about changing,â as Doggie began to murmur excuses,
âI canât. Iâve no evening togs. My old ones
fell to bits when I was trying to put them on, on
board the steamer, and I had to chuck âem overboard.
They turned up a shark, who went for
âem. So donât you worry, Doggie, old chap. You
look as pretty as paint as you are. Doesnât he,
Peggy?â

Peggy, with a slight flush on her cheek, came to the
rescue and linked her arm in Marmadukeâs.

âYou havenât had time to learn everything yet,
Oliver; but I think you ought to know that we are
engaged.â

âHoly Gee! Is that so? My compliments.â
He swept them a low bow. âGod bless you, my
children!â

âOf course heâll stay to dinner,â said Peggy; and
she looked at Oliver as who should say, âTouch him
at your peril: he belongs to me.â

So Doggie had to yield. Mrs. Conover went into
the house to arrange for Oliverâs comfort, and the others
strolled round the garden.

âWell, my boy,â said the Dean, âso youâre back
in the old country?â

âTurned up again like a bad penny.â

The Deanâs kindly face clouded. âI hope youâll
soon be able to find something to do.â

âItâs money I want, not work,â said Oliver.

âAh!â said the Dean, in a tone so thoughtful
as just to suggest a lack of sympathy.

Oliver looked over his shoulderâthe Dean and
himself were preceding Marmaduke and Peggy on the

Â
trim gravel path. âDo you care to lend me a few
thousands, Doggie?â

âCertainly not,â replied Marmaduke.

âThereâs family affection for you, Uncle Edward!
Iâve come half-way round the earth to see him, andâsay,
will you lend me a fiver?â

âIf you need it,â said Marmaduke in a dignified
way, âI shall be very happy to advance you five
pounds.â

Oliver brought the little party to a halt and burst
into laughter.

âI believe you good people think Iâve come back
broke to the world. The black sheep returned like
a wolf to the fold. Only Peggy drew a correct inference
from the valetâwait till you see him! As
Peggy said, Iâve been getting on.â He laid a light
hand on the Deanâs shoulder. âWhile all you
folks in Durdlebury, especially my dear Doggie, for
the last ten years have been durdling, Iâve been doing.
Iâve not come all this way to tap relations for five-pound
notes. Iâm swaggering into the City of London
for Capitalâwith a great big C.â

Marmaduke twirled his little moustache. âYouâve
taken to company promoting,â he remarked acidly.

âI have. And a damnâI beg your pardon, Uncle
Edwardâwe poor Pacific Islanders lisp in damns
for want of deans to hold us upâand a jolly good
company too. Weâthatâs I and another manâthatâs
all the company as yetâtwoâs company, you
knowâown a trading fleet.â

âYou own ships?â cried Peggy.

âRather. Own âem, sail âem, navigate âem,
stoke âem, clean out the boilers, sit on the safety valves
when we want to make speed, do every old thingâââ

âAnd what do you trade in?â asked the Dean.

Â
âCopra, bÃªche-de-mer, mother-of-pearlâââ

âMother-of-pearl! How awfully romantic!â
cried Peggy.

âWeâve got a fishery. At any rate, the concession.
To work it properly we require capital. Thatâs
why Iâm hereâto turn the concern into a limited
company.â

âAnd where is this wonderful place?â asked the
Dean.

âHuaheine.â

âWhat a beautiful word!â

âIsnât it?â said Oliver. âLike the sigh of a
girl in her sleep.â

The old Dean shot a swift glance at his nephew;
then took his arm and walked on, and looked at the
vast mass of the cathedral and at the quiet English
garden in its evening shadow.

âCopra, bÃªche-de-mer, mother-of-pearl, Huaheine,â
he murmured. âAnd these strange foreign
things are the commonplaces of your life!â

Peggy and Marmaduke lagged behind a little. She
pressed his arm.

âIâm so glad youâre staying for dinner. I shouldnât
like to think you were running away from him.â

âI was only afraid of losing my temper and making
a scene,â replied Doggie with dignity.

âHis manners are odious,â said Peggy. âYou
leave him to me.â

Suddenly the Dean, taking a turn that brought him
into view of the porch, stopped short.

âGoodness gracious!â he cried. âWho in the
world is that?â

He pointed to a curious object slouching across the
lawn; a short hirsute man wearing a sailorâs jersey
and smoking a stump of a blackened pipe. His

Â
tousled head was bare; he had very long arms and
great powerful hands protruded at the end of long
sinewy wrists from inadequate sleeves. A pair of bright
eyes shone out of his dark shaggy face, like a Dandy
Dinmontâs. His nose was large and red. He rolled as
he walked. Such a sight had never been seen before
in the Deanery garden.

âThatâs my man. Peggyâs valet,â said Oliver
airily. âHis name is Chipmunk. A beauty, isnât
he?â

âLike master, like man,â murmured Doggie.

Oliverâs quick ears caught the words intended
only for Peggy. He smiled brightly.

âIf you knew what a compliment you were paying
me, Doggie, you wouldnât have said such a thing.â

The man seeing the company stare at him, halted,
took his pipe out of his mouth, and scratched his head.

âButâerâforgive me, my dear Oliver,â said the
Dean. âNo doubt he is an excellent fellowâbut
donât you think he might smoke his pipe somewhere
else?â

âOf course he might,â said Oliver. âAnd he
jolly well shall.â He put his hand to his mouth, sea-fashionâthey
were about thirty yards apartâand
shouted: âHere, you! What the eternal blazes
are you doing here?â

âPlease donât hurt the poor manâs feelings,â said
the kindly Dean.

Oliver turned a blank look on his Uncle. âHis
what? Ainât got any. Not that kind of feelings.â
He proceeded: âNow then, look lively! Clear out!
Skidoo!â

The valet touched his forehead in salute, andââWhere
am I to go to, Capâen?â

âGo toâââ

Â
Oliver checked himself in time, and turned to the
Dean.

âWhere shall I tell him to go?â he asked sweetly.

âThe kitchen garden would be the best place,â
replied the Dean.

âI think Iâd better go and fix him up myself,â
said Oliver. âA little conversation in his own language
might be beneficial.â

âBut isnât he English?â asked Peggy.

âBorn and bred in Wapping,â said Oliver.

He marched off across the lawn; and, could they
have heard it, the friendly talk that he had with Chipmunk
would have made the Saint and the Divines,
and even the Crusader, Sir Guy de Chevenix, who
were buried in the cathedral, turn in their tombs.

Doggie, watching the disappearing Chipmunk,
Oliverâs knuckles in his neck, said:

âI think it monstrous of Oliver to bring such a
disreputable creature down here.â

Said the Dean: âAt any rate, it brings a certain
excitement into our quiet surroundings.â

âThey must be having the time of their lives in
the Servantsâ Hall,â said Peggy.

Â

CHAPTER IV

After
breakfast the next morning Doggie,
attired in a green shot-silk dressing-gown,
entered his own particular room and sat down to think.
In its way it was a very beautiful roomâhigh, spacious,
well-proportioned, facing south-east. The wall-paper,
which he had designed himself, was ivory-white with
veinings of peacock-blue. Into the ivory-silk curtains
were woven peacocks in full pride. The cushions
were ivory and peacock-blue. The chairs, the
writing-table, the couch, the bookcases, were pure
Sheraton and Hepplewhite. Vellum-bound books
filled the casesâDoggie was very particular about his
bindings. Delicate water-colours alone adorned the
walls. On his neatly arranged writing-table lay an
ivory setâinkstand, pen-tray, blotter and calendar.
Bits of old embroidery harmonizing with the peacock
shades were spread here and there. A pretty collection
of eighteenth-century Italian ivory statuettes were
grouped about the room. A spinet, inlaid with ebony
and ivory, formed a centre for the arrangement of
many other musical instrumentsâa viol, mandolins
gay with ribbons, a theorbo, flutes and clarinets.
Through the curtains, draped across an alcove, could
be guessed the modern monstrosity of a grand piano.
One tall closed cabinet was devoted to his collection
of wall-papers. Another, open, to a collection of little
dogs in china, porcelain, faÃ¯ence; thousands of them;
he got them through dealers from all over the world.

Â
He had the finest collection in existence, and maintained
a friendly and learned correspondence with the other
collectorâan elderly, disillusioned Russian prince, who
lived somewhere near Nijni-Novgorod. On the
spinet and on the writing-table were great bowls of
golden
rayon dâor
roses.

Doggie sat down to think. An unwonted frown
creased his brow. Several problems distracted him.
The morning sun streaming into the room disclosed,
beyond doubt, discolorations, stains and streaks on the
wall-paper. It would have to be renewed. Already
he had decided to design something to take its place.
But last night Peggy had declared her intention to
turn this abode of bachelor comfort into the drawing-room,
and to hand over to his personal use some other
apartment, possibly the present drawing-room, which
received all the blaze and glare of the afternoon sun.
What should he do? Live in the sordidness of discoloured
wall-paper for another year, or go through
the anxiety of artistic effort and manufacturersâ stupidity
and delay, to say nothing of the expense, only
to have the whole thing scrapped before the wedding?
Doggie had a foretaste of the dilemmas of matrimony.
He had a gnawing suspicion that the trim and perfect
life was difficult of attainment.

Then, meandering through this wilderness of
dubiety, ran thoughts of Oliver. Every one seemed
to have gone crazy over him. Uncle Edward and
Aunt Sophia had hung on his lips while he lied unblushingly
about his adventures. Even Peggy had listened
open-eyed and open-mouthed when he had told a tale
of shipwreck in the South Seas: how the schooner
had been caught in some beastly wind and the masts
had been torn out and the rudder carried away, and how
it had struck a reef, and how something had hit him

Â
on the head, and he knew no more till he woke up
on a beach and found that the unspeakable Chipmunk
had swum with him for a weekâor whatever the time
wasâuntil they got to land. If hulking, brainless
dolts like Oliver, thought Doggie, like to fool around
in schooners and typhoons, they must take the consequences.
There was nothing to brag about. The
higher man was the intellectual, the Ã¦sthetic, the artistic
being. What did Oliver know of Lydian modes or
Louis Treize decoration or Astec clay dogs? Nothing.
He couldnât even keep his socks from slopping about
over his shoes. And there was Peggy all over the
fellow, although before dinner she had said she couldnât
bear the sight of him. Doggie was perturbed. On
bidding him good night, she had kissed him in the
most perfunctory mannerâmerely the cousinly peck of
a dozen years agoâand had given no thought to the
fact that he was driving home in an open car without
an overcoat. He had felt distinctly chilly on his
arrival, and had taken a dose of ammoniated quinine.
Was Peggyâs indifference a sign that she had ceased
to care for him? That she was attracted by the
buccaneering Oliver?

Now suppose the engagement was broken off, he
would be free to do as he chose with the redecoration
of the room. But suppose, as he sincerely and devoutly
hoped, it wasnât? Dilemma on dilemma. Added
to all this, Goliath, the miniature Belgian griffon,
having probably overeaten himself, had complicated
pains inside, and the callous vet. could or would not
come round till the evening. In the meantime,
Goliath might die.

He was at this point of his reflections, when to his
horror he heard a familiar voice outside the door.

âAll right, Peddle. Donât worry. Iâll show

Â
myself in. Look after that man of mine. Quite
easy. Give him some beer in a bucket and leave him
to it.â

Then the door burst open and Oliver, pipe in
mouth and hat on one side, came into the room.

âHallo, Doggie! Thought Iâd look you up.
Hope Iâm not disturbing you.â

âNot at all,â said Doggie. âDo sit down.â

But Oliver walked about and looked at things.

âI like your water-colours. Did you collect
them yourself?â

âYes.â

âI congratulate you on your taste. This is a
beauty. Who is it by?â

The appreciation brought Doggie at once to his side.
Oliver, the connoisseur, was showing himself in a new
and agreeable light. Doggie took him delightedly
round the pictures, expounding their merits and their
little histories. He found that Oliver, although
unlearned, had a true sense of light and colour and
tone. He was just beginning to like him, when the
tactless fellow, stopping before the collection of little
dogs, spoiled everything.

âMy holy aunt!â he criedâan objurgation which
Doggie had abhorred from boyhoodâand he doubled
with laughter in his horrid schoolboy fashionââMy
dear Doggieâis that your family? How many
litters?â

âItâs the finest collection of the kind in the world,â
replied Doggie stiffly, âand is worth several thousand
pounds.â

Oliver heaved himself into a chairâthat was
Doggieâs impression of his method of sitting downâa
Sheraton chair with delicate arms and legs.

âForgive me,â he said, âbut youâre such a funny

Â
devil.ââDoggie gaped. The conception of himself
as a funny devil was new.ââPictures and music I
can understand. But what the deuce is the point of
these dam little dogs?â

But Doggie was hurt. âIt would be useless to
try to explain,â said he.

Oliver took off his hat and sent it skimming on to
the couch.

âLook here, old chap,â he said, âI seem to have
put my foot into it again. I didnât mean to, really.
Peggy gave me hell this morning for not treating
you as a man and a brother, and I came round to try
to put things right.â

âItâs very considerate of Peggy, Iâm sure,â said
Marmaduke.

âNow look here, old Doggieâââ

âI told you when we first met yesterday that I
vehemently object to being called Doggie.â

âBut why?â asked Oliver. âIâve made inquiries,
and find that all your palsâââ

âI havenât any pals, as you call them.â

âWell, all our male contemporaries in the place
who have the honour of your acquaintanceâthey all
call you Doggie, and you donât seem to mind.â

âI do mind,â replied Marmaduke angrily, âbut
as I avoid their company as much as possible, it doesnât
very much matter.â

Oliver stretched out his legs and put his hands
behind his backâthen wriggled to his feet. âWhat
a beast of a chair! Anyhow,â he went on, puffing
at his pipe, âdonât let us quarrel. Iâll call you Marmaduke,
if you like, when I can rememberâitâs a
beast of a nameâlike the chair. Iâm a rough sort of
chap. Iâve had ten yearsâ pretty rough training. Iâve
slept on boards. Iâve slept in the open without a cent

Â
to hire a board. Iâve gone cold and Iâve gone hungry,
and men have knocked me about and Iâve knocked
men aboutâand Iâve lost the Durdlebury sense of
social values. In the wilds if a man once gets the
name, say, of Duck-Eyed Joe, it sticks to him, and he
accepts it and answers to it, and signs âDuck-Eyed
Joeâ on an IOU and honours the signature.â

âBut Iâm not in the wilds,â said Marmaduke,
âand havenât the slightest intention of ever leading
the unnatural and frightful life you describe. So
what you say doesnât apply to me.â

âQuite so,â replied Oliver. âThat wasnât the
moral of my discourse. The habit of mind engendered
in the wilds applies to me. Just as I could never think
of Duck-Eyed Joe as George Wilkinson, so you,
James Marmaduke Trevor, will live imperishably in
my mind as Doggie. I was making a sort of apology,
old chap, for my habit of mind.â

âIf it is an apologyâââ said Marmaduke.

Oliver, laughing, clapped him boisterously on the
shoulder. âOh, you solemn comic cuss!â He
strode to a rose-bowl and knocked the ashes of his
pipe into the waterâDoggie trembled lest he might
next squirt tobacco juice over the ivory curtains.
âYou donât give a fellow a chance. Look here, tell
me, as man to man, what are you going to do with
your life? I donât mean it in the high-brow sense
of people who live in unsuccessful plays and garden
cities, but in the ordinary common-sense way of the
world. Here you are, young, strong, educated,
intelligentâââ

âIâm not strong,â said Doggie.

âOh, shucks! A monthâs exercise would make
you as strong as a mule. Here you areâwhat the
blazes are you going to do with yourself?â

Â
âI donât admit that you have any right to question
me,â said Doggie, lighting a cigarette.

âPeggy has given it to me. We had a heart to
heart talk this morning, I assure you. She called me
a swaggering, hectoring barbarian. So I told her
what Iâd do. I said Iâd come here and squeak like a
little mouse and eat out of your hand. I also said Iâd
take you out with me to the Islands and give you a
taste for fresh air and salt water and exercise. Iâll
teach you how to sail a schooner and how to go about
barefoot and swab decks. Itâs a life for a man out there,
I tell you. If youâve nothing better to do than living
here snug like a flea on a dogâs back, until you get
married, youâd better come.â

Doggie smiled pityingly, but said politely:

âYour offer is very kind, Oliver; but I donât
think that kind of life would suit me.â

âOh yes it would,â said Oliver. âIt would make
you healthy, wealthyâif you took a fancy to put
some money into the pearl fisheryâand wise. Iâd
show you the world, make a man of you, for Peggyâs
sake, and teach you how men talk to one another in
a gale of wind.â

The door opened and Peddle appeared.

âI beg your pardon, Mr. Oliverâbut your
manâââ

âYes? What about him? Is he misbehaving
himself? Kissing the maids?â

âNo, sir,â said Peddleââbut none of them can
get on with their work. He has drunk two quart
jugs of beer and wants a third.â

âWell, give it to him.â

âI shouldnât like to see the man intoxicated, sir,â
said Peddle.

âYou couldnât. No one has or ever will.â

Â
âHe is also standing on his head, sir, in the middle
of the kitchen table.â

âItâs his great parlour-trick. You just try to do
it, Peddleâespecially after two quarts of beer. Heâs
showing his gratitude, poor chapâjust like the juggler
of Notre-Dame in the story. And Iâm sure everybodyâs
enjoying themselves?â

âThe maids are nearly in hysterics, sir.â

âBut theyâre quite happy?â

âToo happy, sir.â

âLord!â cried Oliver, âwhat a lot of stuffy owls
you are! What do you want me to do? What
would you like me to do, Doggie? Itâs your house.â

âI donât know,â said Doggie. âIâve had nothing
to do with such people. Perhaps you might go and
speak to him.â

âNo, I wonât do that. I tell you what, Peddle,â
said Oliver brightly. âYou lure him out into the
stable yard with a great hunk of pieâhe adores pieâand
tell him to sit there and eat it till I come. Tell
him I said so.â

âIâll see what can be done, sir,â said Peddle.

âI donât mean to be inhospitable,â said Doggie,
after the butler had gone, âbut why do you take
this extraordinary person about with you?â

âI wanted him to see Durdlebury and Durdlebury
to see him. Do it good,â replied Oliver. âNow,
what about my proposition? Out there of course
youâll be my guest. Put yourself in charge of Chipmunk
and me for eight months, and youâll never
regret it. What Chipmunk doesnât know about ships
and drink and hard living isnât knowledge. Weâll
let you down easyâtreat you kindlyâword of
honour.â

Doggie being a man of intelligence realized that

Â
Oliverâs offer arose from a genuine desire to do him
some kind of service. But if a friendly bull out of the
fullness of its affection invited you to accompany
him to the meadow and eat grass, what could you do
but courteously decline the invitation? This is what
Doggie did. After a further attempt at persuasion,
Oliver grew impatient, and picking up his hat stuck it
on the side of his head. He was a simple-natured,
impulsive man. Peggyâs spirited attack had caused him
to realize that he had treated Doggie with unprovoked
rudeness; but then, Doggie was such a little worm.
Suddenly the great scheme for Doggieâs regeneration
had entered his head, and generously he had rushed to
begin to put it into execution. The pair were his
blood relations after all. He saw his way to doing
them a good turn. Peggy, with all her goâexemplified
by the manner in which she had gone for himâwas
worth the trouble he proposed to take with Doggie.
It really was a handsome offer. Most fellows would
have jumped at the prospect of being shown round
the Islands with an old hand who knew the whole
thing backwards, from company promoting to beach-combing.
He had not expected such a point-blank,
bland refusal. It made him angry.

âIâm really most obliged to you, Oliver,â said Doggie
finally. âBut our ideals are so entirely different.
Youâre primitive, you know. You seem to find your
happiness in defying the elements, whereas I find mine
in adopting the resources of civilization to circumvent
them.â

He smiled, pleased with his little epigram.

âWhich means,â said Oliver, âthat youâre afraid
to roughen your hands and spoil your complexion.â

âIf you like to put it that wayâsymbolically.â

âSymbolically be hanged!â cried Oliver, losing

Â
his temper. âYouâre an effeminate little rotter, and
Iâm through with you. Go on and wag your tail and
sit up and beg for biscuitsâââ

âStop!â shouted Doggie, white with sudden
anger which shook him from head to foot. He
marched to the door, his green silk dressing-gown
flapping round his legs, and threw it wide open.
âThis is my house. Iâm sorry to have to ask you
to get out of it.â

Oliver looked intently for a few seconds into the
flaming little dark eyes. Then he said gravely:

âIâm a beast to have said that. I take it all back.
Good-bye!â

âGood day to you,â said Doggie; and when the
door was shut he went and threw himself, shaken,
on the couch, hating Oliver and all his works more
than ever. Go about barefoot and swab decks!
It was Bedlam madness. Besides being dangerous
to health, it would be excruciating discomfort. And
to be insulted for not grasping at such martyrdom. It
was intolerable.

Doggie stayed away from the Deanery all that day.
On the morrow he heard, to his relief, that Oliver
had returned to London with the unedifying Chipmunk.
He took Peggy for a drive in the Rolls-Royce,
and told her of Oliverâs high-handed methods. She
sympathized. She said, however:

âOliverâs a rough diamond.â

âHeâs one of Natureâs non-gentlemen,â said
Doggie.

She laughed and patted his arm. âClever lad!â
she said.

So Doggieâs wounded vanity was healed. He confided
to her some of his difficulties as to the peacock and
ivory room.

Â
âBear with the old paper for my sake,â she said.
âItâs something you can do for me. In the meanwhile,
you and I can put our heads together and design
a topping scheme of decoration. Itâs not too early
to start in right now, for itâll take months and months
to get the house just as we want.â

âYouâre the best girl in the world,â said Doggie;
âand the way you understand me is simply wonderful.â

âDear old thing,â smiled Peggy; âyouâre no
great conundrum.â

Happiness once more settled on Doggie Trevor.
For the next two or three days he and Peggy tackled the
serious problem of the reorganization of Denby Hall.
Peggy had the large ideas of a limited though acute
brain, stimulated by social ambitions. When she became
mistress of Denby Hall, she intended to reverse
the invisible boundary that included it in Durdlebury
and excluded it from the County. It was to be
Countyâof the fine inner Arcanum of Countyâand
only Durdlebury by the grace of Peggy Trevor.
No âdurdling,â as Oliver called it, for her. Denby
Hall was going to be the very latest thing of September,
1915, when she proposed, the honeymoon concluded,
to take smart and startling possession. Lots
of Mrs. Trevorâs rotten old stuffy furniture would
have to go. Marmaduke would have to revolutionize
his habits. As she would have all kinds of jolly
people down to stay, additions must be made to the
house. Within a week after her engagement she had
devised all the improvements. Marmadukeâs room,
with a great bay thrown out, would be the drawing-room.
The present drawing-room, nucleus of a new
wing, would be a dancing-room, with parquet flooring;
when not used for tangos and the fashionable negroid
dances, it would be called the morning-room; beyond

Â
that there would be a billiard-room. Above this first
floor there could easily be built a series of guest chambers.
As for Marmadukeâs library, or study, or den,
any old room would do. There were a couple of
bedrooms overlooking the stable yard which thrown
into one would do beautifully.

With feminine tact she dangled these splendours
before Doggieâs infatuated eyes, instinctively choosing
the opportunity of his gratitude for soothing treatment.
Doggie telegraphed for Sir Owen Julius, R.A., Surveyor
to the Cathedral, the only architect of his acquaintance.
The great man sent his partner, plain John Fox,
who undertook to prepare a design.

Mr. Fox came down to Durdlebury on the 28th
of July. There had been a lot of silly talk in the
newspapers about Austria and Serbia, to which Doggie
had given little heed. There was always trouble in
the Balkan States. Recently they had gone to war.
It had left Doggie quite cold. They were all âMerry
Widow,â irresponsible people. They dressed in
queer uniforms and picturesque costumes, and thought
themselves tremendously important, and were always
squabbling among themselves and would go on doing
it till the day of Doom. Now there was more fuss.
He had read in the
Morning Post
that Sir Edward
Grey had proposed a Conference of the Great Powers.
Only sensible thing to do, thought Doggie. He
dismissed the trivial matter from his mind. On
the morning of the 29th he learned that Austria had
declared war on Serbia. Still, what did it matter?

Doggie had held aloof from politics. He regarded
them as somewhat vulgar. Conservative by caste,
he had once, when the opportunity was almost forced
on him, voted for the Conservative candidate of the
constituency. European politics on the grand scale

Â
did not arouse his interest at all. England, save as
the wise Mentor, had nothing to do with them. Still,
if Russia fought, France would have to join her ally.
It was not till he went to the Deanery that he began
to contemplate the possibility of a general European
war. For the next day or two he read his newspapers
very carefully.

On Saturday, the 1st of August, Oliver suddenly
reappeared, proposing to stay over the Bank Holiday.
He brought news and rumours of war from the great
city. He had found money very tight, Capital with
a big C impossible to obtain. Every one told him to
come back when the present European cloud had
blown over. In the opinion of the judicious, it would
not blow over. There was going to be war, and
England could not stay out of it. The Sunday morning
papers confirmed all he said. Germany had declared
war on Russia. France was involved. Would Great
Britain come in, or for ever lose her honour?

That warm beautiful Sunday afternoon they sat
on the peaceful lawn under the shadow of the great
cathedral. Burford brought out the tea-tray and
Mrs. Conover poured out tea. Sir Archibald and
Lady Bruce and their daughter Dorothy were there.
Doggie, impeccable in dark purple. Nothing clouded
the centuries-old serenity of the place. Yet they asked
the question that was asked on every quiet lawn,
every little scrap of shaded garden throughout the land
that day: Would England go to war?

And if she came in, as come in she must, what
would be the result? All had premonitions of strange
shifting of destinies. As it was yesterday so it was
to-day in that gracious shrine of immutability. But
every one knew in his heart that as it was to-day so
would it not be to-morrow. The very word âwarâ

Â
seemed as out of place as the suggestion of Hell in
Paradise. Yet the throb of the War Drum came
over the broad land of France and over the sea and half
over England, and its echo fell upon the Deanery
garden, flung by the flying buttresses and piers and
towers of the grey cathedral.

On the morning of Wednesday, the 5th of August,
it thundered all over the Close. The ultimatum to
Germany as to Belgium had expired the night before.
We were at war.

âThank God,â said the Dean at breakfast, âwe
neednât cast down our eyes and slink by when we meet
a Frenchman.â

Â

CHAPTER V

The
first thing that brought the seriousness of the
war home to Doggie was a letter from John
Fox. John Fox, a major in a Territorial regiment,
was mobilized. He regretted that he could not give
his personal attention to the proposed alterations at
Denby Hall. Should the plans be proceeded with in
his absence from the office, or would Mr. Trevor
care to wait till the end of the war, which, from the
nature of things, could not last very long? Doggie
trotted off to Peggy. She was greatly annoyed.

âWhat awful rot!â she cried. âFox, a major of
artillery! Iâd just as soon trust you with a gun.
Why doesnât he stick to his architecture?â

âHeâd be shot or something if he refused to go,â
said Doggie. âBut why canât we turn it over to Sir
Owen Julius?â

âThat old archÃ¦ological fossil?â

Peggy, womanlike, forgot that they had approached
him in the first place.

âHeâd never begin to understand what we want.
Fox hinted as much. Now Fox is modern and up to
date and sympathetic. If I canât have Fox, I wonât
have Sir Owen. Why, heâs older than Dad! Heâs
decrepit. Canât we get another architect?â

âDo you think, dear,â said Doggie, âthat, in the
circumstances, it would be a nice thing to do?â

She flashed a glance at him. She had woven no
young girlâs romantic illusions around Marmaduke.

Â
Should necessity have arisen, she could have furnished
you with a merciless analysis of his character. But
in that analysis she would have frankly included a very
fine sense of honour. If he said a thing wasnât quite
niceâwell, it wasnât quite nice.

âI suppose it wouldnât,â she admitted. âWe
shall have to wait. But itâs a rotten nuisance all the
same.â

Hundreds of thousands of not very intelligent,
but at the same time by no means unpatriotic, people,
like Peggy, at the beginning of the war thought trivial
disappointments rotten nuisances. We had all waxed
too fat during the opening years of the twentieth century,
and, not having a spiritual ideal in Godâs universe,
we were in danger of perishing from Fatty Degeneration
of the Soul. As it was, it took a year or more of
war to cure us.

It took Peggy quite a month to appreciate the
meaning of the mobilization of Major Fox, R.F.A.
A brigade of Territorial artillery flowed over Durdlebury,
and the sacred and sleepy meadows became a
mass of guns and horse-lines and men in khaki, and
waggons and dingy canvas tentsâand the old quiet
streets were thick with unaccustomed soldiery. The
Dean called on the Colonel and officers, and soon the
house was full of eager young men holding the Kingâs
commission. Doggie admired their patriotism, but
disliked their whole-hearted embodiment of the
military spirit. They seemed to have no ideas beyond
their new trade. The way they clanked about in
their great boots and spurs got on his nerves. He
dreaded also lest Peggy should be affected by the
meretricious attraction of a uniform. There were
fine hefty fellows among the visitors at the Deanery,
on whom Peggy looked with natural admiration.

Â
Doggie bitterly confided to Goliath that it was the
âglamour of brawn.â It never entered his head
during those early days that all the brawn of all the
manhood of the nation would be needed. We had our
well-organized Army and Navy, composed of peculiarly
constituted men whose duty it was to fight;
just as we had our well-organized National Church,
also composed of peculiarly constituted men whose
duty it was to preach. He regarded himself as remote
from one as from the other.

Oliver, who had made a sort of peace with Doggie
and remained at the Deanery, very quickly grew
restless.

One day, walking with Peggy and Marmaduke
in the garden, he said: âI wish I could get hold of
that confounded fellow, Chipmunk!â

Partly through deference to the good Deanâs delicately
hinted distaste for that upsetter of decorous
households, and partly to allow his follower to attend
to his own domestic affairs, he had left Chipmunk in
London. Fifteen years ago Chipmunk had parted
from a wife somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
East India Docks. Both being illiterate, neither had
since communicated with the other. As he had left
her earning good money in a factory, his fifteen yearsâ
separation had been relieved from anxiety as to her
material welfare. A prudent, although a beer-loving
man, he had amassed considerable savings, and it was
the dual motive of sharing these with his wife and of
protecting his patron from the ever-lurking perils
of London, that had brought him across the seas.
When Oliver had set him free in town, he was going
in quest of his wife. But as he had forgotten the name
of the street near the East India Docks where his
wife lived, and the name of the factory in which she

Â
worked, the successful issue of the quest, in Oliverâs
opinion, seemed problematical. The simple Chipmunk,
however, was quite sanguine. He would run
into her all right. As soon as he had found her he
would let the Captain know. Up to the present he
had not communicated with the Captain. He could
give the Captain no definite address, so the Captain
could not communicate with him. Chipmunk had
disappeared into the unknown.

âIsnât he quite capable of taking care of himself?â
asked Peggy.

âIâm not so sure,â replied Oliver. âBesides,
heâs hanging me up. Iâm kind of responsible for him,
and Iâve got sixty pounds of his money. Itâs all I
could do to persuade him not to stow the lot in his
pocket, so as to divide it with Mrs. Chipmunk as soon
as he saw her. I must find out what has become of
the beggar before I move.â

âI suppose,â said Doggie, âyouâre anxious now
to get back to the South Seas?â

Oliver stared at him. âNo, sonny, not till the
warâs over.â

âWhy, you wouldnât be in any great danger out
there, would you?â

Oliver laughed. âYouâre the funniest duck that
ever was, Doggie. Iâll never get to the end of you.â
And he strolled away.

âWhat does he mean?â asked the bewildered
Doggie.

âI think,â replied Peggy, smiling, âthat he means
heâs going to fight.â

âOh,â said Doggie. Then after a pause he added,
âHeâs just the sort of chap for a soldier, isnât he?â

The next day Oliverâs anxiety as to Chipmunk was
relieved by the appearance of the man himself, incredibly

Â
dirty and dusty and thirsty. Having found no
trace of his wife, and having been robbed of the money
he carried about him, he had tramped to Durdlebury,
where he reported himself to his master as if nothing
out of the way had happened.

âYou silly blighter,â said Oliver. âSuppose I
had let you go with your other sixty pounds, you would
have been pretty well in the soup, wouldnât you?â

âYes, Capâen,â said Chipmunk.

âAnd youâre not going on any blethering idiot wild-goose
chases after wives and such-like truck again, are
you?â

âNo, Capâen,â said Chipmunk.

This was in the stable-yard, after Chipmunk had
shaken some of the dust out of his hair and clothes
and had eaten and drunk voraciously. He was now
sitting on an upturned bucket and smoking his clay
pipe with an air of solid content. Oliver, lean and
supple, his hands in his pockets, looked humorously
down upon him.

âAnd youâve got to stick to me for the future,
like a roseate leech.â

âYes, Capâen.â

âYouâre going to ride a horse.â

âA wot?â roared Chipmunk.

âA thing on four legs, that kicks like hell.â

âWotever for? I ainât never ridden no âosses.â

âYouâre going to learn, you unmilitary-looking,
worm-eaten scab. Youâve got to be a ruddy soldier.â

âGorblime!â said Chipmunk, âthatâs the first I
âeard of it. A âoss soldier? Youâre not kiddinâ,
are you, Capâen?â

âCertainly not.â

âGorblime! Who would haâ thought it?â
Then he spat lustily and sucked at his pipe.

Â
âYouâve nothing to say against it, have you?â

âNo, Capâen.â

âAll right. And look here, when weâre in the
army you must chuck calling me Capâen.â

âWhat shall I have to call yer? Gineral?â
Chipmunk asked simply.

âMate, Bill, Joeâany old name.â

âKer-ist!â said Chipmunk.

âDo you know why weâre going to enlist?â

âCanât say as âow I does, Capâen.â

âYou chuckle-headed swab! Donât you know
weâre at war?â

âI did âear some talk about it in a pub one night,â
Chipmunk admitted. ââOo are we fighting? Dutchmen
or Dagoes?â

âDutchmen.â

Chipmunk spat in his horny hands, rubbed them
together and smiled. As each individual hair on his face
seemed to enter into the smile, the result was sinister.

âDo you remember that Dutchman at Samoa,
Capâen?â

Oliver smiled back. He remembered the hulking,
truculent German merchant whom Chipmunk, having
half strangled, threw into the sea. He also remembered
the amount of accomplished lying he had to
practise in order to save Chipmunk from the clutches
of the law and get away with the schooner.

âWe leave here to-morrow,â said Oliver. âIn
the meanwhile youâll have to shave your ugly face.â

For the first time Chipmunk was really staggered.
He gaped at Oliverâs retiring figure. Even his limited
and time-worn vocabulary failed him. The desperate
meaning of the war has flashed suddenly on millions
of men in millions of different ways. This is the
way in which it flashed on Chipmunk.

Â
He sat on his bucket pondering over the awfulness
of it and sucking his pipe long after it had been smoked
out. The Deanâs car drove into the yard and the
chauffeur, stripping off his coat, prepared to clean it
down.

âSay, guvânor,â said Chipmunk hoarsely, âwhat
do you think of this âere war?â

âSame as most people,â replied the chauffeur tersely.
He shared in the general disapproval of Chipmunk.

âBut see âere. Capâen he tells me I must shave me
face and be a âoss soldier. I never shaved me face in
me life, and I dunno âow to do it, just as I dunno âow
to ride a âoss. Iâm a sailorman, I am, and sailormen
donât shave their faces and ride âosses. Thatâs why I
arsked yer what yer thought of this âere war.â

The chauffeur struggled into his jeans and adjusted
them before replying.

âIf youâre a sailor, the place for you is the navy,â
he remarked in a superior manner. âAs for the
cavalry, the Capâen, as you call him, ought to have
more senseâââ

Chipmunk rose and swung his long arms threateningly.

âLook âere, young feller, do you want to have your
blinkinâ âead knocked orf? Where the Capâen goes,
I goes, and donât you make any mistake about it!â

âI didnât say anything,â the chauffeur expostulated.

âThen donât say it. See? Keep your blinkinâ âead
shut and mind your own business.â

And, scowling fiercely and thrusting his empty
pipe into his trousers pocket, Chipmunk rolled away.

A few hours later Oliver, entering his room to dress
for dinner, found him standing in the light of the
window laboriously fitting studs into a shirt. The
devoted fellow having gone to report to his master,

Â
had found Burford engaged in his accustomed task of
laying out his masterâs evening clothesâOliver during
his stay in London had provided himself with these
necessaries. A jealous snarl had sent Burford flying.
So intent was he on his work, that he did not hear
Oliver enter. Oliver stood and watched him. Chipmunk
was swearing wholesomely under his breath.
Oliver saw him take up the tail of the shirt, spit on it
and begin to rub something.

âKer-ist!â said Chipmunk.

âWhat in the thundering blazes are you doing
there?â cried Oliver.

Chipmunk turned.

âOh, my God!â said Oliver.

Then he sank on a chair and laughed and laughed,
and the more he looked at Chipmunk the more he
laughed. And Chipmunk stood stolid, holding the
shirt of the awful, wet, thumb-marked front. But
it was not at the shirt that Oliver laughed.

âGood God!â he cried, âwere you born like
that?â

For Chipmunk, having gone to the barberâs, was
clean-shaven, and revealed himself as one of the
most comically ugly of the sons of men.

âNever mind,â said Oliver, after a while, âyouâve
made the sacrifice for your country.â

âAnd wot if I get the face-ache?â

âIâd get something that looked like a face before
Iâd talk of it,â grinned Oliver.

At the family dinner-table, Doggie being present,
he announced his intentions. It was the duty of
every able-bodied man to fight for the Empire. Had
not half a million just been called for? We should
want a jolly sight more than that before we got through
with it. Anyway, he was off to-morrow.

Â
âTo-morrow?â echoed the Dean.

Burford, who was handing him potatoes, arched
his eyebrows in alarm. He was fond of Oliver.

âWith Chipmunk.â

Burford uttered an unheard sigh of relief.

âWeâre going to enlist in King Edwardâs Horse.
Theyâre our kind. Overseas men. Lots of âem what
you dear good people would call bad eggs. There you
make the mistake. Perhaps they maynât be fresh
enough raw for a dainty palateâbut for cooking,
good hard cooking, by gosh! nothing can touch
âem.â

âYou talk of enlisting, dear,â said Mrs. Conover.
âDoes that mean as a private soldier?â

âYesâa trooper. Why not?â

âYouâre a gentleman, dear. And gentlemen in
the Army are officers.â

âNot now, my dear Sophia,â said the Dean.
âGentlemen are crowding into the ranks. They are
setting a noble example.â

They argued it out in their gentle old-fashioned way.
The Dean quoted examples of sons of family who had
served as privates in the South African War.

âAnd that to this,â said he, âis but an eddy to a
maelstrom.â

âCome and join us, James Marmaduke,â said
Oliver across the table. âChipmunk and me.
Three âsworn brothers to France.ââ

Doggie smiled easily. âIâm afraid I canât undertake
to swear a fraternal affection for Chipmunk.
He and I would have neither habits nor ideals in
common.â

Oliver turned to Peggy. âI wish,â said he, with
rare restraint, âhe wouldnât talk like a book on
deportment.â

Â
âMarmaduke talks the language of civilization,â
laughed Peggy. âHeâs not a savage like you.â

âDonât you jolly well wish he was!â said Oliver.

Peggy flushed. âNo, I donât!â she declared.

The Dean being called away on business immediately
after dinner, the young men were left alone in
the dining-room when the ladies had departed. Oliver
poured himself out a glass of port and filled his pipeâan
inelegant proceeding of which Doggie disapproved.
A pipe alone was barbaric, a pipe with
old port was criminal. He held his peace however.

âJames Marmaduke,â said Oliver, after a while,
âwhat are you going to do?â Much as Marmaduke
disliked the name of âDoggie,â he winced under the
irony of the new appellation.

âI donât see that Iâm called upon to do anything,â
he replied.

Oliver smoked and sipped his port. âI donât want
to hurt your feelings any more,â said he gravely,
âthough sometimes Iâd like to scrag youâI suppose
because youâre so different from me. It was so when
we were children together. Now Iâve grown very
fond of Peggy. Put on the right track, she might
turn into a very fine woman.â

âI donât think we need discuss Peggy, Oliver,â
said Marmaduke.

âI do. She is sticking to you very loyally.â
Oliver was a bit of an idealist. âThe time may come
when sheâll be up the devilâs own tree. Sheâll develop
a patriotic conscience. If she sticks to you while you
do nothing sheâll be miserable. If she chucks you,
as she probably will, sheâll be no happier. Itâs all up
to you, James Doggie Marmaduke, old son. Youâll
have to gird up your loins and take sword and buckler
and march away like the rest. I donât want Peggy

Â
to be unhappy. I want her to marry a man. Thatâs
why I proposed to take you out with me to Huaheine
and try to make you one. But thatâs over. Now,
hereâs the real chance. Better take it sooner than
later. Youâll have to be a soldier, Doggie.â

His pipe not drawing, he was preparing to dig it
with the point of a dessert-knife, when Doggie interposed
hurriedly.

âFor goodnessâ sake, donât do that! It makes
cold shivers run down my back!â

Oliver looked at him oddly, put the extinct pipe
in his dinner-jacket pocket and rose.

âA flaw in the dainty and divine ordering of things
makes you shiver now, old Doggie. What will you
do when you see a fellow digging out another fellowâs
intestines with the point of a bayonet? A bigger
flaw there somehow!â

âDonât talk like that. You make me sick,â said
Doggie.

Â

CHAPTER VI

During
the next few months there happened
terrible and marvellous things, which are all
set down in the myriad chronicles of the time; which
shook the world and brought the unknown phenomenon
of change into the Close of Durdlebury. Folks
of strange habit and speech walked in it, and, gazing
at the Gothic splendour of the place, saw through the
mist of autumn and the mist of tears not Durdlebury
but Louvain. More than one of those grey houses
flanking the cathedral and sharing with it the continuity
of its venerable life, was a house of mourning; not
for loss in the inevitable and not unkindly way of
human destiny as understood and accepted with long
disciplined resignationâbut for loss sudden, awful,
devastating; for the gallant lad who had left it but
a few weeks before, with a smile on his lips, and a
new and dancing light of manhood in his eyes, now
with those eyes unclosed and glazed staring at the pitiless
Flanders sky. Not one of those houses but was linked
with a battlefield. Beyond the memory of man the
reader of the Litany had droned the accustomed invocation
on behalf of the Sovereign and the Royal
Family, the Bishops, Priests and Deacons, the Lords
of the Council and all prisoners and captives, and the
congregation had lumped them all together in their
responses with an undifferentiating convention of
fervour. What had prisoners and captives, any more
than the Lords of the Council, to do with their lives,

Â
their hearts, their personal emotions? But nowâDurdlebury
men were known to be prisoners in German
hands, and after âall prisoners and captivesâ
there was a long and pregnant silence, in which was
felt the reverberation of war against pier and vaulted
arch and groined roof of the cathedral, which was
broken too, now and then, by the stifled sob of a
woman, before the choir came in with the response
so new and significant in its appealââWe beseech
thee to hear us, O Lord!â

And in every home the knitting-needles of women
clicked, as they did throughout the length and breadth
of the land. And the young men left shop and trade
and counting-house. And young parsons fretted, and
some obtained the Bishopâs permission to become Army
chaplains, and others, snapping their fingers (figuratively)
under the Bishopâs nose, threw their cassocks
to the nettles and put on the full (though in modern
times not very splendiferous) panoply of war. And
in course of time the brigade of artillery rolled away
and new troops took their place; and Marmaduke
Trevor, Esquire, of Denby Hall, was called upon to
billet a couple of officers and twenty men.

Doggie was both patriotic and polite. Having a
fragment of the British Army in his house, he did
his best to make them comfortable. By January he
had no doubt that the Empire was in peril, that it
was every manâs duty to do his bit. He welcomed
the new-comers with open arms, having unconsciously
abandoned his attitude of superiority over mere brawn.
Doggie saw the necessity of brawn. The more the
better. It was every patriotic Englishmanâs duty to
encourage brawn. If the two officers had allowed
him, he would have fed his billeted men every two
hours on prime beefsteaks and burgundy. He threw

Â
himself heart and soul into the reorganization of his
household. Officers and men found themselves in
clover. The officers had champagne every night for
dinner. They thought Doggie a capital fellow.

âMy dear chap,â they would say, âyouâre spoiling
us. I donât say we donât like it and arenât grateful.
We jolly well are. But weâre supposed to rough itâto
lead the simple lifeâwhat? Youâre doing us
too well.â

âImpossible!â Doggie would reply, filling up the
speakerâs glass. âDonât I know what we owe to you
fellows? In what other way can a helpless, delicate
crock like myself show his gratitude and in some sort
of little way serve his country?â

When the sympathetic and wine-filled guest would
ask what was the nature of his malady, he would tap
his chest vaguely and reply:

âConstitutional. Iâve never been able to do things
like other fellows. The least thing bowls me out.â

âDam hard linesâespecially just now.â

âYes, isnât it?â Doggie would answer. And once
he found himself adding, âIâm fed up with doing
nothing.â

Here can be noted a distinct stage in Doggieâs
development. He realized the brutality of fact.
When great German guns were yawning open-mouthed
at you, it was no use saying, âTake the nasty, horrid
things away, I donât like them.â They wouldnât
go unless you took other big guns and fired at them.
And more guns were required than could be manned
by the peculiarly constituted fellows who made up
the artillery of the original British Army. New
fellows not at all warlike, peaceful citizens who had
never killed a cat in anger, were being driven by
patriotism and by conscience to man them. Against

Â
Blood and Iron now supreme, the superior, Ã¦sthetic
and artistic being was of no avail. You might lament
the fall in relative values of collections of wall-papers
and little china dogs, as much as you liked; but you
could not deny the fall; they had gone down with
something of an ignoble âwallop.â Doggie began
to set a high value on guns and rifles and such-like
deadly engines, and to inquire petulantly why the
Government were not providing them at greater
numbers and at greater speed. On his periodic visits
to London he wandered round by Trafalgar Square
and Whitehall, to see for himself how the recruiting
was going on. At the Deanery he joined in ardent
discussions of the campaign in Flanders. On the
walls of his peacock and ivory room were maps stuck
all over with little pins. When he told the young
officer that he was wearied of inaction, he spoke the
truth. He began to feel mightily aggrieved against
Providence for keeping him outside this tremendous
national league of youth. He never questioned his
physical incapacity. It was as real a fact as the
German guns. He went about pitying himself and
seeking pity.

The months passed. The regiment moved away
from Durdlebury, and Doggie was left alone in Denby
Hall.

He felt solitary and restless. News came from
Oliver that he had been offered and had accepted an
infantry commission, and that Chipmunk, having none
of the special qualities of a ââoss soldier,â had, by certain
skilful wire-pullings, been transferred to his regiment,
and had once more become his devoted servant.
âA month of this sort of thing,â he wrote, âwould
make our dear old Doggie sit up.â Doggie sighed.
If only he had been blessed with Oliverâs constitution!

Â
One morning Briggins, his chauffeur, announced
that he could stick it no longer and was going to join
up. Then Doggie remembered a talk he had had
with one of the young officers who had expressed
astonishment at his not being able to drive a car. âI
shouldnât have the nerve,â he had replied. âMy
nerves are all wrongâand I shouldnât have the
strength to change tyres and things.ââ¦ If his
chauffeur went, he would find it very difficult to get
another. Who would drive the Rolls-Royce?

âWhy not learn to drive yourself, sir?â said
Briggins. âNot the Rolls-Royce. I would put it
up or get rid of it, if I were you. If you engage a
second-rate man, as youâll have to, who isnât used to
this make of car, heâll do it in for you pretty quick.
Get a smaller one in its place and drive it yourself.
Iâll undertake to teach you enough before I go.â

So Doggie, following Brigginsâ advice, took lessons
and, to his amazement, found that he did not die of
nervous collapse when a dog crossed the road in front
of the car and that the fitting of detachable wheels
did not require the strength of a Hercules. The first
time he took Peggy out in the two-seater he swelled
with pride.

âIâm so glad to see you can do something!â she
said.

Although she was kind and as mildly affectionate
as ever, he had noticed of late a curious reserve in her
manner. Conversation did not flow easily. There
seemed to be something at the back of her mind.
She had fits of abstraction from which, when rallied,
she roused herself with an effort.

âItâs the war,â she would declare. âItâs affecting
everybody that way.â

Gradually Doggie began to realize that she spoke

Â
truly. Most people of his acquaintance, when he
was by, seemed to be thus afflicted. The lack of
interest they manifested in his delicacy of constitution
was almost impolite. At last he received an anonymous
letter, âFor little Doggie Trevor, from the
girls of Durdlebury,â enclosing a white feather.

The cruelty of it broke Doggie down. He sat in
his peacock and ivory room and nearly wept. Then
he plucked up courage and went to Peggy. She was
rather white about the lips as she listened.

âIâm sorry,â she said, âbut I expected something
of the sort to happen.â

âItâs brutal and unjust.â

âYes, itâs brutal,â she admitted coldly.

âI thought you, at any rate, would sympathize
with me,â he cried.

She turned on him. âAnd what about me? Who
sympathizes with me? Do you ever give a momentâs
thought to what Iâve had to go through the last few
months?â

âI donât quite know what you mean,â he stammered.

âI should have thought it was obvious. You canât
be such an innocent babe as to suppose people donât
talk about you. They donât talk to you because they
donât like to be rude. They send you white feathers
instead. But they talk to me. âWhy isnât Marmaduke
in khaki?â âWhy isnât Doggie fighting?â
âI wonder how you can allow him to slack about like
that!ââIâve had a pretty rough time fighting your
battles, I can tell you, and I deserve some credit. I
want sympathy just as much as you do.â

âMy dear,â said Doggie, feeling very much humiliated,
âI never knew. I never thought. I do see
now the unpleasant position youâve been in. People

Â
are brutes. But,â he added eagerly, âyou told them
the real reason?â

âWhatâs that?â she asked, looking at him with
cold eyes.

Then Doggie knew that the wide world was against
him. âIâm not fit. Iâve no constitution. Iâm an
impossibility.â

âYou thought you had nerves until you learned to
drive the car. Then you discovered that you hadnât.
You fancy youâve a weak heart. Perhaps if you
learned to walk thirty miles a day you would discover
you hadnât that either. And so with the rest of it.â

âThis is very painful,â he said, going to the window
and staring out. âVery painful. You are of the
same opinion as the young women who sent me that
abominable thing.â

She had been on the strain for a long while and
something inside her had snapped. At his woebegone
attitude she relented however, and came up and
touched his shoulder.

âA girl wants to feel some pride in the man sheâs
going to marry. Itâs horrible to have to be always
defending himâespecially when sheâs not sure sheâs
telling the truth in his defence.â

He swung round horrified. âDo you think Iâm
shamming, so as to get out of serving in the Army?â

âNot consciously. Unconsciously, I think you
are. What does your doctor say?â

Doggie was taken aback. He had no doctor. He
had not consulted one for years, having no cause for
medical advice. The old family physician who had
attended his mother in her last illness and had prescribed
Gregory powders for him as a child, had retired
from Durdlebury long ago. There was only one
person living familiar with his constitution, and that

Â
was himself. He made confession of the surprising
fact. Peggy made a little gesture.

âThat proves it. I donât believe you have anything
wrong with you. The nerves business made
me sceptical. This is straight talking. Itâs horrid,
I know. But itâs best to get through with it once
and for all.â

Some men would have taken deep offence and,
consigning Peggy to the devil, have walked out of the
room. But Doggie, a conscientious, even though a
futile human being, was gnawed for the first time by
the suspicion that Peggy might possibly be right. He
desired to act honourably.

âIâll do,â said he, âwhatever you think proper.â

Peggy was swift to smite the malleable iron. To
use the conventional phrase might give an incorrect
impression of red-hot martial ardour on the part of
Doggie.

âGood,â she said, with the first smile of the day.
âIâll hold you to it. But it will be an honourable
bargain. Get Dr. Murdoch to overhaul you thoroughly,
with a view to the Army. If he passes you,
take a commission. Dad says he can easily get you
one through his old friend General Gadsby at the
War Office. If he doesnât, and youâre unfit, Iâll
stick to you through thick and thin, and make the
young women of Durdlebury wish theyâd never been
born.â

She put out her hand. Doggie took it.

âVery well,â said he, âI agree.â

She laughed, and ran to the door.

âWhere are you going?â

âTo the telephoneâto ring up Dr. Murdoch for
an appointment.â

âYouâre flabby,â said Dr. Murdoch the next

Â
morning to an anxious Doggie in pink pyjamas; âbut
thatâs merely a matter of unused muscles. Physical
training will set it right in no time. Otherwise, my
dear Trevor, youâre in splendid health. I was afraid
your family history might be against youâthe child
of elderly parents, and so forth. But nothing of the
sort. Not only are you a first-class life for an insurance
company, but youâre a first-class life for the Armyâand
thatâs saying a good deal. Thereâs not a flaw
in your whole constitution.â

He put away his stethoscope and smiled at Doggie,
who regarded him blankly as the pronouncer of a
doom. He went on to prescribe a course of physical
exercises, so many miles a day walking, such and
such back-breaking and contortional performances in
his bathroom; if possible, a skilfully graduated career
in a gymnasium, but his words fell on the ears of a
Doggie in a dream; and when he had ended, Doggie
said:

âIâm afraid, Doctor, youâll have to write all that
out for me.â

âWith pleasure,â smiled the doctor, and gripped
him by the hand. And seeing Doggie wince, he
said heartily: âAh! Iâll soon set that right for you.
Iâll get you somethingâan india-rubber contrivance
to practise with for half an hour a day, and youâll
develop a hand like a gorillaâs.â

Dr. Murdoch grinned his way, in his little car, to
his next patient. Here was this young slacker, coddled
from birth, absolutely horse-strong and utterly confounded
at being told so. He grinned and chuckled
so much that he nearly killed his most valuable old
lady patient, who was crossing the High Street.

But Doggie crept out of bed and put on a violet
dressing-gown that clashed horribly with his pink

Â
pyjamas, and wandered like a man in a nightmare
to his breakfast. But he could not eat. He swallowed
a cup of coffee and sought refuge in his own room.
He was frightened. Horribly frightened, caught in
a net from which there was no escapeânot the tiniest
break of a mesh. He had given his wordâand in
justice to Doggie, be it said that he held his word
sacredâhe had given his word to join the Army if
he should be passed by Murdoch. He had been
passedâmore than passed. He would have to join.
He would have to fight. He would have to live in
a muddy trench, sleep in mud, eat in mud, plough
through mud, in the midst of falling shells and other
instruments of death. And he would be an officer,
with all kinds of strange and vulgar men under him,
men like Chipmunk, for instance, whom he would
never understand. He was almost physically sick with
apprehension. He realized that he had never commanded
a man in his life. He had been mortally
afraid of Briggins, his late chauffeur. He had heard
that men at the front lived on some solid horror called
bully-beef dug out of tins, and some liquid horror
called cocoa, also drunk out of tins; that men kept
on their clothes, even their boots, for weeks at a time;
that rats ran over them while they tried to sleep;
that lice, hitherto associated in his mind with the most
revolting type of tramp, out there made no distinction
of persons. They were the common lot of the lowest
Tommy and the finest gentleman. And then the
fighting. The noise of the horrid guns. The disgusting
sights of men shattered to bloody bits. The
horrible stench. The terror of having oneâs face shot
half away and being an object of revolt and horror
to all beholders for the rest of life. Death. Feverishly
he ruffled his comely hair. Death. He was surprised

Â
that the contemplation of it did not freeze the
blood in his veins. Yes. He put it clearly before
him. He had given his word to Peggy that he would
go and expose himself to Death. Death. What did
it mean? He had been brought up in orthodox
Church of England Christianity. His flaccid mind
had never questioned the truth of its dogmas. He
believed, in a general sort of way, that good people
went to Heaven and bad people went to Hell. His
conscience was clear. He had never done any harm
to anybody. As far as he knew, he had broken none
of the Ten Commandments. In a technical sense
he was a miserable sinner, and so proclaimed himself
once a week. But though, perhaps, he had done
nothing in his life to merit eternal bliss in Paradise,
yet, on the other hand, he had committed no action
which would justify a kindly and just Creator in
consigning him to the eternal flames of Hell. Somehow
the thought of Death did not worry him. It
faded from his mind, being far less terrible than life
under prospective conditions. Discomfort, hunger,
thirst, cold, fatigue, pain; above all the terror of his
fellowsâthese were the soul-racking anticipations of
this new life into which it was a matter of honour for
him to plunge. And to an essential gentleman like
Doggie a matter of honour was a matter of life. And
so, dressed in his pink pyjamas and violet dressing-gown,
amid the peacock-blue and ivory hangings of
his boudoir room, and stared at by the countless unsympathetic
eyes of his little china dogs, Doggie Trevor
passed through his first Gethsemane.

His decision was greeted with joy at the Deanery.
Peggy threw her arms round his neck and gave him
the very first real kiss he had ever received. It revived

Â
him considerably. His Aunt Sophia also embraced
him. The Dean shook him warmly by the hand,
and talked eloquent patriotism. Doggie already felt
a hero. He left the house in a glow, but the drive
home in the two-seater was cold and the pitch-dark
night presaged other nights of mercilessness in the
future; and when Doggie sat alone by his fire, sipping
the hot milk which Peddle presented him on a silver
tray, the doubts and fears of the morning racked him
again. An ignoble possibility occurred to him.
Murdoch might be wrong. Murdoch might be prejudiced
by local gossip. Would it not be better to
go up to London and obtain the opinion of a first-class
man to whom he was unknown? There was
also another alternative. Flight. He might go to
America, and do nothing. To the South of France,
and help in some sort of way with hospitals for French
wounded. He caught himself up short as these
thoughts passed through his mind, and he shuddered.
He took up the glass of hot milk and put it down
again. Milk? He needed something stronger. A
glance in a mirror showed him his sleek hair tousled
into an upstanding wig. In a kind of horror of himself
he went to the dining-room and for the first time in
his life drank a stiff whisky and soda for the sake of
the stimulant. Reaction came. He felt a man once
more. Rather suicide at once than such damnable
dishonour. According to the directions which the
Dean, a man of affairs, had given him, he sat down
and wrote his application to the War Office for a
commission. Thenâunique adventure!âhe stole
out of the barred and bolted house, without thought
of hat and overcoat (let the traducers of alcohol mark
it well), ran down the drive and posted the letter in
the box some few yards beyond his entrance gates.

Â
The Dean had already posted his letter to his old
friend General Gadsby at the War Office.

So the die was cast. The Rubicon was crossed.
The bridges were burnt. The irrevocable step was
taken. Dr. Murdoch turned up the next morning
with his prescription for physical training. And then
Doggie trained assiduously, monotonously, wearily.
He grew appalled by the senselessness of this apparently
unnecessary exertion. Now and then Peggy accompanied
him on his prescribed walks; but the charm
of her company was discounted by the glaring superiority
of her powers of endurance. While he ached with
fatigue, she pressed along as fresh as Atalanta at the
beginning of her race. When they parted by the
Deanery door, she would stand flushed, radiant in
her youth and health, and say:

âWeâve had a topping walk, old dear. Now isnât
it a glorious thing to feel oneself alive?â

But poor Doggie of the flabby muscles felt half
dead.

The fateful letter burdening Doggie with the Kingâs
commission arrived a few weeks later: a second
lieutenancy in a Fusilier battalion of the New Army.
Dates and instructions were given. The impress of
the Royal Arms at the head of the paper, with its
grotesque perky lion and unicorn, conveyed to Doggie
a sense of the grip of some uncanny power. The typewritten
words scarcely mattered. The impress fascinated
him. There was no getting away from it.
Those two pawing beasts held him in their clutch.
They headed a Death Warrant, from which there
was no appeal.

Doggie put his house in order, dismissed with bounty
those of his servants who would be no longer needed,

Â
and kept the Peddles, husband and wife, to look after
his interests. On his last night at home he went
wistfully through the familiar place, the drawing-room
sacred to his motherâs memory, the dining-room
so solid in its half-century of comfort, his own peacock
and ivory room so intensely himself, so expressive of
his every taste, every mood, every emotion. Those
strange old-world musical instrumentsâhe could play
them all with the touch or breath of a master and a
lover. The old Italian theorbo. He took it up.
How few to-day knew its melodious secret! He
looked around. All these daintinesses and prettinesses
had a meaning. They signified the magical
little beauties of lifeâthings which asserted a range
of spiritual truths, none the less real and consolatory
because vice and crime and ugliness and misery and
war co-existed in ghastly fact on other facets of the
planet Earth. The sweetness here expressed was as
essential to the worldâs spiritual life as the sweet
elements of foodstuffs to its physical life. To the
getting together of all these articles of beauty he had
devoted the years of his youthâ¦. Andâanother
point of viewâwas he not the guardian by inheritanceâin
other words, by Divine Providenceâof this
beautiful English home, the trustee of English comfort,
of the sacred traditions of sweet English life that
had made England the only country, the only country,
he thought, that could call itself a Country and not a
Compromise, in the world?

And he was going to leave it all. All that it meant
in beauty and dignity and ease of life. For what?

For horror and filthiness and ugliness, for everything
against which his beautiful peacock and ivory
room protested. Doggieâs last night at Denby Hall
was a troubled one.

Â
Aunt Sophia and Peggy accompanied him to London
and stayed with him at his stuffy little hotel off Bond
Street, while Doggie got his kit together. They
bought everything in every West End shop that any
salesman assured them was essential for active service.
Swords, revolvers, field-glasses, pocket-knives (for
gigantic pockets), compasses, mess-tins, cooking-batteries,
sleeping-bags, waterproofs, boots innumerable,
toilet accessories, drinking-cups, thermos flasks,
field stationery cases, periscopes, tinted glasses, Gieve
waistcoats, cholera belts, portable medicine cases, earplugs,
tin-openers, corkscrews, notebooks, pencils,
luminous watches, electric torches, pins, housewives,
patent seat walking-sticksâeverything that the man
of commercial instincts had devised for the prosecution
of the war.

The amount of warlike equipment with which
Doggie, with the aid of his Aunt Sophia and Peggy,
encumbered the narrow little passages of Sturrocksâs
Hotel, must have weighed about a ton.

At last Doggieâs uniformsâseveral suitsâcame
home. He had devoted enormous care to their fit.
Attired in one he looked beautiful. Peggy decreed a
dinner at the Carlton. She and Doggie alone. Her
mother could get some stuffy old relation to spend the
evening with her at Sturrocksâs. She wanted Doggie
all to herself, so as to realize the dream of many
disgusting and humiliating months. And as she swept
through the palm court and up the broad stairs and
wound through the crowded tables of the restaurant
with the khaki-clad Doggie by her side, she felt proud
and uplifted. Here was her soldier whom she had
made. Her very own man in khaki.

âDear old thing,â she whispered, pressing his arm
as they trekked to their table. âDonât you feel

Â
glorious? Donât you feel as if you could face the
universe?â

Peggy drank one glass of the quart of champagne.
Doggie drank the rest.

On getting into bed he wondered why this unprecedented
quantity of wine had not affected his
sobriety. Its only effect had been to stifle thought.
He went to bed and slept happily, for Peggyâs parting
kiss had been such as would conduce to any young
manâs felicity.

The next morning Aunt Sophia and Peggy saw
him off to his depot, with his ton of luggage. He
leaned out of the carriage window and exchanged
hand kisses with Peggy until the curve of the line cut
her off. Then he settled down in his corner with the

Morning Post
. But he could not concentrate his
attention on the morning news. This strange costume
in which he was clothed seemed unreal, monstrous;
no longer the natty dress in which he had been proud
to prink the night before, but a nightmare, Nessus-like
investiture, signifying some abominable burning
doom.

The train swept him into a world that was upside
down.

Â

CHAPTER VII

Those
were proud days for Peggy. She went
about Durdlebury with her head in the air,
and her step was as martial as though she herself wore
the Kingâs uniform, and she regarded the other girls
of the town with a defiant eye. If only she could
discover, she thought, the sender of the abominable
feather! In Timpanyâs drapery establishment she
raked the girls at the counter with a searching glance.
At the cathedral services she studied the demure faces
of her contemporaries. Now that Doggie was a
soldier she held the anonymous exploit to be cowardly
and brutal. What did people know of the thousand
and one reasons that kept eligible young men out of
the Army? What had they known of Marmaduke?
As soon as the illusion of his life had been dispelled, he
had marched away with as gallant a tread as anybody;
and though Doggie had kept to himself his shrinkings
and his terrors, she knew that what to the average
hardily bred young man was a gay adventure, was to
him an ordeal of considerable difficulty. She longed for
his first leave, so that she could parade him before the
town, in the event of there being a lurking sceptic who
still refused to believe that he had joined the Army.

Conspicuous in the drawing-room, framed in silver,
stood a large full-length photograph of Doggie in his
new uniform.

She wrote to him daily, chronicling the little doings
of the town, at times reviling it for its dullness. Dad,

Â
on numberless committees, was scarcely ever in the
house, except for hurried meals. Most of the pleasant
young clergy had gone. Many of the girls had gone
too: Dorothy Bruce to be a probationer in a V.A.D.
hospital. If Durdlebury were not such a rotten out-of-the-world
place, the infirmary would be full of
wounded soldiers, and she could do her turn at nursing.
As things were, she could only knit socks for Tommies
and a silk khaki tie for her own boy. But when
everybody was doing their bit, these occupations were
not enough to prevent her feeling a little slacker.
He would have to do the patriotic work for both of
them, tell her all about himself, and let her share
everything with him in imagination. She also expressed
her affection for him in shy and slangy terms.

Doggie wrote regularly. His letters were as shy
and conveyed less information. The work was hard,
the hours long, his accommodation Spartan. They
were in huts on Salisbury Plain. Sometimes he
confessed himself too tired to write more than a few
lines. He had a bad cold in the head. He was
better. They had inoculated him against typhoid and
had allowed him two or three slack days. The first
time he had unaccountably fainted; but he had seen
some of the men do the same, and the doctor had
assured him that it had nothing to do with cowardice.
He had gone for a route march and had returned a
dusty lump of fatigue. But after having shaken the
dust out of his moustacheâDoggie had a playful
turn of phrase now and thenâand drunk a quart
of shandy-gaff, he had felt refreshed. Then it rained
hard, and they were all but washed out of the huts.
It was a very strange lifeâone which he never dreamed
could have existed. âFancy me,â he wrote, âglad
to sleep on a drenched bed!â There was the riding-school.

Â
Why hadnât he learned to ride as a boy?
He had been told that the horse was a noble animal
and the friend of man. He was afraid he would
return to his dear Peggy with many of his young
illusions shattered. The horse was the most ignoble,
malevolent beast that ever walked, except the sergeant-major
in the riding-school. Peggy was filled with
admiration for his philosophic endurance of hardships.
It was real courage. His letters contained simple
statements of fact, but not a word of complaint. On
the other hand, they were not ebullient with joy;
but then, Peggy reflected, there was not much to be
joyous about in a ramshackle hut on Salisbury Plain.
âDear old thing,â she would write, âalthough you
donât grouse, I know you must be having a pretty
thin time. But youâre bucking up splendidly, and
when you get your leave Iâll do a girlâs very dââdest
(donât be shocked; but Iâm sure youâre learning far
worse language in the Army) to make it up to you.â
Her heart was very full of him.

Then there came a time when his letters grew
rarer and shorter. At last they ceased altogether.
After a weekâs waiting she sent an anxious telegram.
The answer came back. âQuite well. Will write
soon.â She waited. He did not write. One evening
an unstamped envelope, addressed to her in a
feminine hand, which she recognized as that of Marmadukeâs
anonymous correspondent, was found in the
Deanery letter-box. The envelope enclosed a copy
of a cutting from the âGazetteâ of the morning
paper, and a sentence was underlined and adorned
with exclamation marks at the sides.

âR. Fusiliers. Tempy. 2nd Lieutenant J.
Trevor resigns his commission.â

Â
The Colonel dealt with him as gently as he could
in that final interview. He put his hand in a fatherly
way on Doggieâs shoulder and bade him not take it
too much to heart. He had done his best; but he
was not cut out for an officer. These were merciless
times. In matters of life and death we could not
afford weak links in the chain. Soldiers in high
command, with great reputations, had already been
scrapped. In Doggieâs case there was no personal
discredit. He had always conducted himself like a
gentleman and a man of honour, but he had not the
qualities necessary for the commanding of men. He
must send in his resignation.

âBut what can I do, sir?â asked Doggie in a
choking voice. âI am disgraced for ever.â

The Colonel reflected for a moment. He knew
that Doggieâs life had been a little hell on earth from
the first day he had joined. He was very sorry for
the poor little toy Pom in his pack of hounds. It
was scarcely the toy Pomâs fault that he had failed.
But the Great Hunt could have no use for toy Poms.
At last he took a sheet of regimental notepaper and
wrote:

âDear Trevor,â

âI am full of admiration for the plucky way in
which you have striven to overcome your physical
disabilities, and I am only too sorry that they should
have compelled the resignation of your commission
and your severance from the regiment.

âYours sincerely,

â
L. G. Caird
,

âLt-Col.â

He handed it to Doggie.

Â
âThatâs all I can do for you, my poor boy,â said he.

âThank you, sir,â said Doggie.

Doggie took a room at the Savoy Hotel, and sat
there most of the day, the pulp of a man. He had
gone to the Savoy, not daring to show his face at the
familiar Sturrocksâs. At the Savoy he was but a
number unknown, unquestioned. He wore civilian
clothes. Such of his uniforms and martial paraphernalia
as he had been allowed to retain in campâfor
one canât house a ton of kit in a hutâhe had given to
his batman. His one desire now was to escape from
the eyes of his fellow-men. He felt that he bore
upon him the stigma of his disgrace, obvious to any
casual glance. He was the man who had been turned
out of the army as a hopeless incompetent. Even
worse than the slackerâfor the slacker might have
latent the qualities that he lacked. Even at the best
and brightest, he could only be mistaken for a slacker,
once more the likely recipient of white feathers from
any damsel patriotically indiscreet. The Colonelâs
letter brought him little consolation. It is true that
he carried it about with him in his pocket-book;
but the gibing eyes of observers had not the X-ray
power to read it there. And he could not pin it on
his hat. Besides, he knew that the kindly Colonel
had stretched a point of veracity. No longer could
he take refuge in his cherished delicacy of constitution.
It would be a lie.

Peggy, in her softest and most pitying mood, never
guessed the nature of Doggieâs ordeal. Those letters
so brave, sometimes so playful, had been written with
shaky hand, misty eyes, throbbing head, despairing
heart. Looking back, it seemed to him one blurred
dream of pain. His brother officers were no worse

Â
than those in any other Kitchener regiment. Indeed,
the Colonel was immensely proud of them and sang
their praises to any fellow-dugout who would listen
to him at the Naval and Military Club. But how
were a crowd of young men, trained in the rough and
tumble of public schools, universities and sport, and
now throbbing under the stress of the new deadly
game, to understand poor Doggie Trevor? They
had no time to take him seriously, save to curse him
when he did wrong, and in their leisure time he became
naturally a butt for their amusement.

âSurely I donât have to sleep in there?â he asked
the subaltern who was taking him round on the day
of his arrival in camp, and showed him his squalid
little cubby-hole of a hut with its dirty boards, its
cheap table and chair, its narrow sleep-dispelling little
bedstead.

âYes, itâs a beastly hole, isnât it? Until last month
we were under canvas.â

âSleeping on the bare ground?â

âWallowing in the mud like pigs. Not one of us
without a cold. Never had a such filthy time in my
life.â

Doggie looked about him helplessly, while the
comforter smiled grimly. Already his disconsolate
attitude towards the dingy hutments of the camp and
the layer of thick mud on his beautiful new boots
had diverted his companion.

âCouldnât I have this furnished at my own
expense? A carpet and a proper bed, and a few
picturesâââ

âI wouldnât try.â

âWhy not?â

âSome of it might get brokenânot quite accidentally.â

Â
âBut surely,â gasped Doggie, âthe soldiers would
not be allowed to come in here and touch my furniture?â

âIt seems,â said the subaltern, after a bewildered
stare, âthat you have quite a lot to learn.â

Doggie had. The subaltern reported a new kind
of animal to the mess. The mess saw to it that Doggie
should be crammed with informationâbut information
wholly incorrect and misleading, which added to
his many difficulties. When his ton of kit arrived
he held an unwilling reception in the hut and found
himself obliged to explain to gravely curious men the
use for which the various articles were designed.

âThis, I suppose, is a new type of gas-mask?â

No. It was a patent cooker. Doggie politely
showed how it worked. He also demonstrated that a
sleeping-bag was not a kit-sack of a size unauthorized
by the regulations, and that a huge steel-pointed walking-stick
had nothing to do with agriculture.

He was very weary of his visitors by the time they
had gone. The next day the Adjutant advised him
to scrap the lot. So sorrowfully he sent back most
of his purchases to London.

Then the Imp of Mischance brought as a visitor
to the mess, a subaltern from another regiment who
belonged to Doggieâs part of the country.

âWhyâIâm blowed if it isnât Doggie Trevor!â
he exclaimed carelessly. âHow dâye do, Doggie?â

So thenceforward he was known in the regiment
by the hated name.

There were rags in which, as he was often the
victim, he was forced to join. His fastidiousness
loathed the coarse personal contact of arms and legs
and bodies. His undeveloped strength could not cope
with the muscle of his young brother barbarians.

Â
Aching with the dayâs fatigue, he would plead, to
no avail, to be left alone. Compared with these feared
and detested scraps, he considered, in after-times,
battles to be agreeable recreations.

Had he been otherwise competent, he might have
won through the teasing and the ragging of the mess.
No one disliked him. He was pleasant-mannered,
good-natured, and appeared to bear no malice. True,
his ignorance not only of the ways of the army but
of the ways of their old hearty world, was colossal,
his mode of expression rather that of a precise old
church dignitary than of a subaltern in a regiment
of Fusiliers, his habits, including a nervous shrinking
from untidiness and dirt, those of a dear old maid;
but the mess thought, honestly, that he could be
knocked into their own social shape, and in the process
of knocking carried out their own traditions. They
might have succeeded if Doggie had discovered any
reserve source of pride from which to draw. But
Doggie was hopeless at his work. The mechanism
of a rifle filled him with dismay. He could not help
shutting his eyes before he pulled the trigger. Inured
all his life to lethargic action, he found the smart crisp
movements of drill almost impossible to attain. The
riding-school was a terror and a torture. Every
second he deemed himself in imminent peril of death.
Said the sergeant-major:

âNow, Mr. Trevor, youâre sitting on a âorse and
not a âolly-bush.â

And Doggie would wish the horse and the sergeant-major
in hell.

Again, what notion could poor Doggie have of
command? He had never raised his mild tenor voice
to damn anybody in his life. At first the tone in
which the officers ordered the men about shocked

Â
him. So rough, so unmannerly, so unkind. He
could not understand the cheery lack of resentment
with which the men obeyed. He could not get into
the way of military directness, could never check the
polite âDo you mindâ that came instinctively to his
lips. Now if you ask a private soldier whether he
minds doing a thing instead of telling him to do it,
his brain begins to get confused. As one defaulter,
whose confusion of brain had led him into trouble,
observed to his mates: âWhat can you do with a
blighter whoâs a cross between a blinking Archbishop
and a ruddy dicky-bird?â What else, save show in
divers and ingenious ways that you mocked at his
authority? Doggie had the nervous dread of the
men that he had anticipated. During his training
on parade, words of command stuck in his throat.
When forced out, they grotesquely mixed themselves
together.

The Adjutant gave advice.

âSpeak out, man. Bawl. Youâre dealing with
soldiers at drill, not saying sweet nothings to old
ladies in a drawing-room.â

And Doggie tried. Doggie tried very hard. He
was mortified by his own stupidity. Little points of
drill and duty that the others of his own standing
seemed to pick up at once, almost by instinct, he could
only grasp after long and tedious toil. No one realized
that his brain was stupefied by the awful and unaccustomed
physical fatigue.

And then came the inevitable end.

So Doggie crept into the Savoy Hotel and hid
himself there, wishing he were dead. It was some
time before he could write the terrible letter to Peggy.
He did so on the day when he saw that his resignation

Â
was gazetted. He wrote after many anguished
attempts:

âDear Peggy,â

âI havenât written before about the dreadful
thing that has happened, because I simply couldnât.
I have resigned my commission. Not of my own free
will, for, believe me, I would have gone through
anything for your sake, to say nothing of the country
and my own self-respect. To put it brutally, I have
been thrown out for sheer incompetence.

âI neither hope nor expect nor want you to continue
your engagement to a disgraced man. I release
you from every obligation your pity and generosity
may think binding. I want you to forget me and
marry a man who can do the work of this new world.

âWhat I shall do I donât know. I have scarcely
yet been able to think. Possibly I shall go abroad.
At any rate I shanât return to Durdlebury. If women
sent me white feathers before I joined, what would
they send me now? It will always be my consolation
to know that you once gave me your love, in spite
of the pain of realizing that I have forfeited it by
my unworthiness.

âPlease tell Uncle Edward that I feel keenly his
position, for he was responsible for getting me the
commission through General Gadsby. Give my love
to my Aunt, if she will have it.

âYours always affectionately,

J. Marmaduke Trevor
.â

By return of post came the answer:

âDearest,â

âWe are all desperately disappointed. Perhaps
we hurried on things too quickly and tried you too

Â
high all at once. I ought to have known. Oh, my
poor dear boy, you must have had a dreadful time.
Why didnât you tell me? The news in the âGazetteâ
came upon me like a thunderbolt. I didnât know
what to think. Iâm afraid I thought the worst, the
very horrid worstâthat you had got tired of it and
resigned of your own accord. How was one to know?
Your letter was almost a relief.

âIn offering to release me from my engagement
you are acting like the honourable gentleman you are.
Of course, I can understand your feelings. But I
should be a little beast to accept right away like that.
If there are any feathers about, I should deserve to
have them stuck on to me with tar. Donât think of
going abroad or doing anything foolish, dear, like that,
till you have seen meâthat is to say, us, for Dad is
bringing Mother and me up to town by the first train
to-morrow. Dad feels sure that everything is not
lost. Heâll dig out General Gadsby and fix up something
for you. In the meantime, get us rooms at the
Savoy, though Mother is worried as to whether itâs
a respectable place for Deans to stay at. But I know
you wouldnât like to meet us at Sturrocksâsâotherwise
you would have been there yourself. Meet our train.
All love from

â
Peggy
.â

Doggie engaged the rooms, but he did not meet the
train. He did not even stay in the hotel to meet his
relations. He could not meet them. He could not
meet the pity in their eyes. He read in Peggyâs note
a desire to pet and soothe him and call him âPoor
little Doggie,â and he writhed. He could not even
take up an heroic attitude, and say to Peggy: âWhen
I have retrieved the past and can bring you an unsullied

Â
reputation, I will return and claim you. Till then
farewell.â There was no retrieving the past. Other
men might fail at first, and then make good; but he
was not like them. His was the fall of Humpty
Dumpty. Finalâirretrievable.

He packed up his things in a fright and, leaving no
address at the Savoy, drove to the Russell Hotel in
Bloomsbury. But he wrote Peggy a letter âto await
arrival.â If time had permitted he would have sent
a telegram, stating that he was off for Tobolsk or
Tierra del Fuego, and thereby prevented their useless
journey; but they had already started when he
received Peggyâs message.

Nothing could be done, he wrote, in effect, to her,
nothing in the way of redemption. He would not
put her father to the risk of any other such humiliation.
He had learned, by the most bitter experience, that
the men who counted now in the worldâs respect and
in womanâs love were men of a type to which, with
all the goodwill in the world, he could not make
himself belongâhe did not say to which he wished
he could belong with all the agony and yearning of
his soul. Peggy must forget him. The only thing
he could do was to act up to her generous estimate
of him as an honourable gentleman. As such it was
his duty to withdraw for ever from her life. His
exact words, however, were: âYou know how I
have always hated slang, how it has jarred upon me,
often to your amusement, when you have used it.
But I have learned in the past months how expressive
it may be. Through slang Iâve learned what I am.
I am a born ârotter.â A girl like you canât possibly
love and marry a rotter. So the rotter, having a
lingering sense of decency, makes his bow and exitsâGod
knows where.â

Â
Peggy, red-eyed, adrift, rudderless on a frightening
sea, called her father into her bedroom at the Savoy
and showed him the letter. He drew out and adjusted
his round tortoise-shell-rimmed reading-glasses and
read it.

âThatâs a miraculously new Doggie,â said he.

Peggy clutched the edges of his coat.

âIâve never heard you call him that before.â

âIt has never been worth while,â said the Dean.

Â

CHAPTER VIII

At
the Savoy, during the first stupefaction of his
misery, Doggie had not noticed particularly
the prevalence of khaki. At the Russell it dwelt
insistent, like the mud on Salisbury Plain. Men that
might have been the twin brethren of his late brother
officers were everywhere, free, careless, efficient. The
sight of them added the gnaw of envy to his heartache.
Even in his bedroom he could hear the jingle of their
spurs and their cheery voices as they clanked along
the corridor. On the third day after his migration
he took a bold step and moved into lodgings in Woburn
Place. Here at least he could find quiet, untroubled
by heart-rending sights and sounds. He spent most
of his time in dull reading and dispirited walking.
For he could walk nowâso much had his training
done for himâand walk for many miles without
fatigue. For all the enjoyment he got out of it, he
might as well have marched round a prison yard.
Indeed there were some who tramped the prison
yards with keener zest. They were buoyed up with
the hope of freedom, they could look forward to the
ever-approaching day when they should be thrown
once more into the glad whirl of life. But the miraculously
new Doggie had no hope. He felt for ever
imprisoned in his shame. His failure preyed on his
mind.

He dallied with thoughts of suicide. Why hadnât
he salved, at any rate, his service revolver? Then he

Â
remembered the ugly habits of the unmanageable thingâhow
it always kicked its muzzle up in the air.
Would he have been able even to shoot himself with
it? And he smiled in self-derision. Drowning was
not so difficult. Any fool could throw himself into
the water. With a view to the inspection of a suitable
spot, Doggie wandered, idly, in the dusk of one evening,
to Waterloo Bridge, and turning his back to the ceaseless
traffic, leaned his elbows on the parapet and stared
in front of him. A few lights already gleamed from
Somerset House and the more dimly seen buildings
of the Temple. The dome of St. Paulâs loomed a
dark shadow through the mist. The river stretched
below very peaceful, very inviting. The parapet
would be easy to climb. He did not know whether
he could dive in the approved mannerâhands joined
over head. He had never learned to swim, let alone
dive. At any rate, he could fall off. In that art
the riding-school had proved him a past master. But
the spot had its disadvantages. It was too public.
Perhaps other bridges might afford more privacy. He
would inspect them all. It would be something to
do. There was no hurry. As he was not wanted in
this world, so he had no assurance of being welcome
in the next. He had a morbid vision of avatar after
avatar being kicked from sphere to sphere.

At this point of his reflections he became aware of
a presence by his side. He turned his head and found
a soldier, an ordinary private, very close to him, also
leaning on the parapet.

âI thought I wasnât mistaken in Mr. Marmaduke
Trevor.â

Doggie started away, on the point of flight, dreading
the possible insolence of one of the men of his late
regiment. But the voice of the speaker rang in his

Â
ears with a strange familiarity, and the great fleshy
nose, the high cheek-bones, and the little grey eyes in
the weather-beaten face suggested vaguely some one
of the long ago. His dawning recognition amused
the soldier.

âYes, laddie. Yeâre right. Itâs your old PhineasâPhineas
McPhail, Esq., M.A., defunct. Now 33702
Private P. McPhail redivivus.â

He warmly wrung the hand of the semi-bewildered
Doggie, who murmured: âVery glad to meet you,
Iâm sure.â

Phineas, gaunt and bony, took his arm.

âWould it not just be possible,â he said, in his old
half-pedantic, half-ironic intonation, âto find a locality
less exposed to the roar of traffic and the rude jostling
of pedestrians and the inclemency of the elements,
in which we can enjoy the amenities of a little refined
conversation?â

It was like a breath from the past. Doggie smiled.

âWhich way are you going?â

âYour way, my dear Marmaduke, was ever mine,
until I was swept, I thought for ever, out of your path
by a torrential spate of whisky.â

He laughed, as though it had been a playful freak
of destiny. Doggie laughed, too. But for the words
he had addressed to hotel and lodging-house folk, he
had spoken to no one for over a fortnight. The
instinctive craving for companionship made Phineas
suddenly welcome.

âYes. Let us have a talk,â said he. âCome to
my rooms, if you have the time. Thereâll be some
dinner.â

âWill I come? Will I have dinner? Will I
re-enter once more the paradise of the affluent?
Laddie, I will.â

Â
In the Strand they hailed a taxi and drove to Bloomsbury.
On the way Phineas asked:

âYou mentioned your rooms. Are you residing
permanently in London?â

âYes,â said Doggie.

âAnd Durdlebury?â

âIâm not going back.â

âLondonâs a place full of temptations for those
without experience,â Phineas observed sagely.

âIâve not noticed any,â Doggie replied. On which
Phineas laughed and slapped him on the knee.

âMan,â said he, âwhen I first saw you I thought
you had changed into a disillusioned misanthropist.
But Iâm wrong. You havenât changed a bit.â

A few minutes later they reached Woburn Place.
Doggie showed him into the sitting-room on the
drawing-room floor. A fire was burning in the grate,
for though it was only early autumn, the evening was
cold. The table was set for Doggieâs dinner. Phineas
looked round him in surprise. The heterogeneous
and tasteless furniture, the dreadful Mid-Victorian
prints on the wallsâone was the âReturn of the
Guards from the Crimea,â representing the landing
from the troop-ship, repellent in its smug unreality,
the coarse glass and well-used plate on the table, the
crumpled napkin in a ring (for Marmaduke who in
his motherâs house had never been taught to dream that
a napkin could possibly be used for two consecutive
meals!), the general air of slipshod Philistinismâall
came as a shock to Phineas, who had expected to find
in Marmadukeâs âroomsâ a replica of the fastidious
prettiness of the peacock and ivory room at Denby
Hall. He scratched his head, covered with a thick
brown thatch.

âLaddie,â said he gravely, âyou must excuse me

Â
if I take a liberty; but I canna fit you into this
environment.â

Doggie looked about him also. âSeems funny,
doesnât it?â

âIt cannot be that youâve come down in the
world?â

âTo bed-rock,â said Doggie.

âNo?â said Phineas, with an air of concern.
âMan, Iâm awful sorry. I know what the coming
down feels like. And I, finding it not abhorrent to
a sophisticated and well-trained conscience, and thinking
you could well afford it, extracted a thousand pounds
from your fortune. My dear lad, if Phineas McPhail
could return the moneyâââ

Doggie broke in with a laugh. âPray donât distress
yourself, Phineas. Itâs not a question of money. Iâve
as much as ever I had. The last thing in the world
Iâve had to think of has been money.â

âThen what in the holy names of Thunder and
Beauty,â cried Phineas, throwing out one hand to an
ancient saddle-bag sofa whose ends were covered by
flimsy rags, and the other to the decayed ormolu clock
on the mantelpiece, âwhat in the name of common
sense are you doing in this awful inelegant lodging-house?â

âI donât know,â replied Doggie. âItâs a fact,â
he continued after a pause. âThe scheme of decoration
is revolting to every Ã¦sthetic sense which Iâve
spent my life in cultivating. Its futile pretentiousness
is the rasping irritation of every hour. Yet here I am.
Quite comfortable. And here I propose to stay.â

Phineas McPhail, M.A., late of Glasgow and Cambridge,
looked at Doggie with his keen little grey eyes
beneath bent and bristling eyebrows. In the language
of 33702 Private McPhail, he asked:

Â
âWhat the blazes is it all about?â

âThatâs a long story,â said Doggie, looking at
his watch. âIn the meantime, I had better give
some orders about dinner. And you would like to
wash.â

He threw open a wing of the folding-doors, once
in Georgian times separating drawing-room from withdrawing-room,
and now separating living-room from
bedroom, and switching on the light, invited McPhail
to follow.

âI think youâll find everything you want,â said he.

Phineas McPhail, left alone to his ablutions, again
looked round, and he had more reason than ever to
ask what it was all about. Marmadukeâs bedroom
at Denby Hall had been a dream of satinwood and
dull blue silk. The furniture and hangings had been
Mrs. Trevorâs present to Marmaduke on his sixteenth
birthday. He remembered how he had been bored
to death by that stupendous ass of an old womanâfor
so he had characterized herâduring the process of
selection and installation. The present room, although
far more luxurious than any that Phineas McPhail
had slept in for years, formed a striking contrast with
that remembered nest of effeminacy.

âIâll have to give it up,â he said to himself. But
just as he had put the finishing touches to his hair an
idea occurred to him. He flung open the door.

âLaddie, Iâve got it. Itâs a woman.â

But Doggie laughed and shook his head, and leaving
McPhail, took his turn in the bedroom. For the
first time since his return to civil life he ceased for a
few moments to brood over his troubles. McPhailâs
mystification amused him. McPhailâs personality and
address, viewed in the light of the past, were full of
interest. Obviously he was a man who lived unashamed

Â
on low levels. Doggie wondered how he
could have regarded him for years with a respect
almost amounting to veneration. In a curious
unformulated way Doggie felt that he had authority
over this man so much older than himself, who had
once been his master. It tickled into some kind of
life his deadened self-esteem. Here at last was a
man with whom he could converse on sure ground.
The khaki uniform caused him no envy.

âThe poet is not altogether incorrect,â said McPhail,
when they sat down to dinner, âin pointing out
the sweet uses of adversity. If it had not been for the
adversity of a wee bit operation, I should not now be
on sick furlough. And if I had not been on furlough
I shouldnât have the pleasure of this agreeable reconciliation.
Hereâs to you, laddie, and to our lasting
friendship.â He sipped his claret. âItâs not like
the Lafitte in the old cellarâ
Eheu fugaces anni et
âwhat
the plague is the Latin for vintages? But
âtwill serve.â He drank again and smacked his
lips. âIt will even serve very satisfactorily. Good
wine at a perfect temperature is not the daily drink
of the British soldier.â

âBy the way,â said Doggie, âyou havenât told
me why you became a soldier.â

âA series of vicissitudes dating from the hour I
left your house,â said Phineas, âvicissitudes the recital
of which would wring your heart, laddie, and make
angels weep if their lachrymal glands were not too
busily engaged by the horrors of war, culminated
four months ago in an attack of fervid and penniless
patriotism. No one seemed to want me except my
country. She clamoured for me on every hoarding
and every omnibus. A recruiting-sergeant in Trafalgar
Square tapped me on the arm, and said: âYoung

Â
man, your country wants you.â Said I with my
Scottish caution, âCan you take your affidavit that
you got the information straight from the War Office?â
âI can,â said he. Then I threw myself on his bosom
and bade him take me to her. Thatâs how I became
33702 Private Phineas McPhail, A Company, 10th
Wessex Rangers, at the remuneration of one shilling
and twopence per diem.â

âDo you like it?â asked Doggie.

Phineas rubbed the side of his thick nose thoughtfully.

âThere you come to the metaphysical conception
of human happiness,â he replied. âIn itself it is a
vile life. To a man of thirty-fiveâââ

âGood lord!â cried Doggie, âI always thought
you were about fifty!â

âYour mother caught me young, laddie. To a
man of thirty-five, a graduate of ancient and honourable
universities and a whilom candidate for holy
orders, it is a life that would seem to have no attraction
whatever. The hours are absurd, the work distasteful,
and the mode of living repulsive. But strange to say,
it fully contents me. The secret of happiness lies in
the supple adaptability to conditions. When I found
that it was necessary to perform ridiculous antics with
my legs and arms, I entered into the comicality of the
idea and performed them with an indulgent zest which
soon won me the precious encomiums of my superiors
in rank. When I found that the language of the
canteen was not that of the pulpit or the drawing-room,
I quickly acquired the new vocabulary and won the
pleasant esteem of my equals. By means of this faculty
of adaptability I can suck enjoyment out of everything.
But, at the same time, mind you, keeping in reserve a
little secret fount of pleasure.â

Â
âWhat do you call a little secret fount of pleasure?â
asked Doggie.

âIâll give you an illustrationâand, if youâre the
man I consider you to be, youâll take a humorous view
of my frankness. At present I adapt myself to a rough
atmosphere of coarseness and lustiness, in which
nothing coarse or lusty I could do would produce
the slightest ripple of a convulsion: but I have my
store of a cultivated mind and cheap editions of the
classics, my little secret fount of Castaly to drink from
whenever I so please. On the other hand, when I
had the honour of being responsible for your education,
I adapted myself to a hot-house atmosphere in which
Respectability and the concomitant virtues of Supineness
and Sloth were cultivated like rare orchids; but
in my bedroom I kept a secret fount which had its
source in some good Scots distillery.â

Whereupon he attacked his plateful of chicken
with vehement gusto.

âYouâre a hedonist, Phineas,â said Doggie, after
a thoughtful pause.

âMan,â said Phineas, laying down his knife and
fork, âyouâve just hit it. I am. Iâm an accomplished
hedonist. An early recognition of the fact
saved me from the Church.â

âAnd the Church from you,â said Doggie quietly.

Phineas shot a swift glance at him beneath his
shaggy brown eyebrows.

âAy,â said he. âThough, mark you, if I had
followed my original vocation, the Bench of Bishops
could not have surpassed me in the unction in which
I would have wallowed. If I had been born a bee in
a desert, laddie, I would have sucked honey out of a
dead camel.â

With easy and picturesque cynicism, and in a Glasgow

Â
accent which had curiously broadened since his
spell of Oriental ease at Denby Hall, he developed his
philosophy, illustrating it by incidents more or less
reputable in his later career. At first, possessor of the
ill-gotten thousand pounds and of considerable savings
from a substantial salary, he had enjoyed the short
wild riot of the Prodigalâs life. Paris saw most of his
moneyâthe Paris which, under his auspices, Doggie
never knew. Plentiful claret set his tongue wagging
in Rabelaisian reminiscence. After Paris came husks.
Not bad husks if you knew how to cook them. Borrowed
salt and pepper and a little stolen butter worked
wonders. But they were irritating to the stomach.
He lay on the floor, said he, and yelled for fatted
calf; but there was no soft-headed parent to supply
it. Phineas McPhail must be a slave again and work
for his living. Then came private coaching, freelance
journalism, hunting for secretaryships: the commonplace
story humorously told of the wastrelâs
decline; then a gorgeous efflorescence in light green
and gold as the man outside a picture palace in Camberwellâand
lastly, the penniless patriot throwing himself
into the arms of his desirous country.

âHave you any whisky in the house, laddie?â
he asked, after the dinner things had been taken away.

âNo,â said Doggie, âbut I could easily get you
some.â

âPray donât,â said McPhail. âIf you had, I
was going to ask you to be kind enough not to let
your excellent landlord, whom I recognize as a butler
of the old school, produce it. Butlers of the old school
are apt, like Peddle, to bring in a maddening tray of
decanters, syphons, and glasses. You may not believe
me, but I havenât touched a drop of whisky since I
joined the army.â

Â
âWhy?â asked Doggie.

McPhail looked at the long carefully preserved
ash of one of Doggieâs excellent cigars.

âItâs all a part of the doctrine of adaptability. In
order to attain happiness in the army, the first step is to
avoid differences of opinion with the civil and military
police and non-commissioned officers, and such-like
sycophantic myrmidons of authority. Being a man of
academic education, it is with difficulty that I agree
with them when Iâm sober. If I were drunk, my
bonnie laddieââhe waved a handââwellâI donât
get drunk. And as I have no use for whisky, as merely
an agreeable beverage, I have struck whisky out of my
hedonistic scheme of existence. But if you have any
more of that pleasant claretâââ

Doggie rang the bell and gave the order. The
landlord brought in bottle and glasses.

âAnd now, my dear Marmaduke,â said Phineas
after an appreciative sip, ânow that I have told you
the story of my life, may I, without impertinent
curiosity, again ask you what you meant when you
said you had come down to bed-rock?â

The sight of the man, smug, cynical, shameless,
sprawling luxuriously on the sofa, with his tunic
unbuttoned, filled him with sudden fury: such fury
as Oliverâs insult had aroused, such as had impelled
him during a vicious rag in the mess to clutch a manâs
hair and almost pull it out by the roots.

âYes, you may; and Iâll tell you,â he cried, starting
to his feet. âIâve reached the bed-rock of myselfâthe
bed-rock of humiliation and disgrace. And itâs
all your fault. Instead of training me to be a man,
you pandered to my poor motherâs weaknesses and
brought me up like a little toy dogâthe infernal name
still sticks to me wherever I go. You made a helpless

Â
fool of me, and let me go out a helpless fool into the
world. And when you came across me I was thinking
whether it wouldnât be best to throw myself over the
parapet. A month ago you would have saluted me
in the street and stood before me at attention when I
spoke to youâââ

âEh? Whatâs that, laddie?â interrupted Phineas,
sitting up. âYouâve held a commission in the
army?â

âYes,â said Doggie fiercely, âand Iâve been
chucked. Iâve been thrown out as a hopeless rotter.
And who is most to blameâyou or I? Itâs you.
Youâve brought me to this infernal place. Iâm here
in hidingâhiding from my family and the decent
folk Iâm ashamed to meet. And itâs all your fault,
and now you have it!â

âLaddie, laddie,â said Phineas reproachfully, âthe
facts of my being a guest beneath your roof and my
humble military rank, render it difficult for me to make
an appropriate reply.â

Doggieâs rage had spent itself. These rare fits were
short-lived and left him somewhat unnerved.

âIâm sorry, Phineas. As you say, youâre my
guest. And as to your uniform, God knows I honour
every man who wears it.â

âThatâs taking things in the right spirit,â Phineas
conceded graciously, helping himself to another glass
of wine. âAnd the right spirit is a great healer of
differences. Iâll not go so far as to deny that there is
an element of justice in your apportionment of blame.
There may, on various occasions, have been some small
dereliction of duty. But youâll have been observing
that in the recent exposition of my philosophy I have
not laboured the point of duty to disproportionate
exaggeration.â

Â
Doggie lit a cigarette. His fingers were still
shaking. âIâm glad you own up. Itâs a sign of
grace.â

âAy,â said Phineas, âno man is altogether bad.
In spite of everything, Iâve always entertained a warm
affection for you, laddie, and when I saw you staring
at bogies round about the dome of St. Paulâs Cathedral
my heart went out to you. You didnât look over-happy.â

Doggie, always responsive to human kindness,
was touched. He felt a note of sincerity in McPhailâs
tone. Perhaps he had judged him harshly, overlooking
the plea in extenuation which Phineas had set
upâthat in every man there must be some saving
remnant of goodness.

âI wasnât happy, Phineas,â he said; âI was as
miserable an outcast as could be found in London,
and when a fellowâs down and out, you must forgive
him for speaking more bitterly than he ought.â

âDonât I know, laddie? Donât I know?â said
Phineas sympathetically. He reached for the cigar-box.
âDo you mind if I take another? Perhaps
twoâone to smoke afterwards, in memory of this
meeting. It is a long time since my lips touched a
thing so gracious as a real Havana.â

âTake a lot,â said Doggie generously, âI donât
really like cigars. I only bought them because I
thought they might be stronger than cigarettes.â

Phineas filled his pockets. âYou can pay no greater
compliment to a manâs honesty of purpose,â said he,
âthan by taking him at his word. And now,â he
continued, when he had carefully lit the cigar he had
first chosen, âlet us review the entire situation. What
about our good friends at Durdlebury? What about
your uncle, the Very Reverend the Dean, against

Â
whom I bear no ill-will, though I do not say that his
ultimate treatment of me was not over-hastyâwhat
about him? If you call upon me to put my almost
fantastically variegated experience of life at your
disposal, and advise you in this crisis, so I must ask you
to let me know the exact conditions in which you find
yourself.â

Doggie smiled once again, finding something diverting
and yet stimulating in the calm assurance of Private
McPhail.

âIâm not aware that Iâve asked you for advice,
Phineas.â

âThe fact that youâre not aware of many things
that you do is no proof that you donât do themâand
do them in a manner perfectly obvious to another
party,â replied Phineas sententiously. âYouâre asking
for advice and consolation from any friendly human
creature to whom youâre not ashamed to speak. Youâve
had an awful sorrowful time, laddie.â

Doggie roamed about the room, with McPhailâs
little grey eyes fixed on him. Yes, Phineas was
right. He would have given most of his possessions
to be able, these later days, to pour out his tortured
soul into sympathetic ears. But shame had kept him,
still kept him, would always keep him, from the ears of
those he loved. Yes, Phineas had said the diabolically
right thing. He could not be ashamed to speak to
Phineas. And there was something good in Phineas
which he had noticed with surprise. How easy for
him, in response to bitter accusation, to cast the blame
on his mother? He himself had given the opening.
How easy for him to point to his predecessorâs short
tenure of office and plead the alternative of carrying
out Mrs. Trevorâs theory of education or of resigning
his position in favour of some sycophant even more

Â
time-serving? But he had kept silentâ¦. Doggie
stopped short and looked at Phineas with eyes dumbly
questioning and quivering lips.

Phineas rose and put his hands on the boyâs shoulders,
and said very gently:

âTell me all about it, laddie.â

Then Doggie broke down, and with a gush of
unminded tears found expression for his stony despair.
His story took a long time in the telling; and Phineas
interjecting an occasional sympathetic âAy, ay,â
and a delicately hinted question, extracted from Doggie
all there was to tell, from the outbreak of war to their
meeting on Waterloo Bridge.

âAnd now,â cried he at last, a dismally tragic
figure, his young face distorted and reddened, his sleek
hair ruffled from the back into unsightly perpendicularities
(an invariable sign of distracted emotion)
and his hands appealingly outstretchedââwhat the
hell am I going to do?â

âLaddie,â said Phineas, standing on the hearthrug,
his hands on his hips, âif you had posed the question
in the polite language of the precincts of Durdlebury
Cathedral, I might have been at a loss to reply. But
the manly invocation of hell shows me that your foot
is already on the upward path. If you had prefaced
it by the adjective that gives colour to all the aspirations
of the British Army, it would have been better. But
Iâm not reproaching you, laddie.
Poco Ã  poco.
It
is enough. It shows me you are not going to run away
to a neutral country and present the unedifying spectacle
of a mangy little British lion at the mercy
of a menagerie of healthy hyenas and such-like
inferior though truculent beasties.â

âMy God!â cried Doggie, âhavenât I thought
of it till Iâm half mad? It would be just as you sayâunendurable.â

Â
He began to pace the room again.
âAnd I canât go to France. It would be just the
same as England. Every one would be looking white
feathers at me. The only thing I can do is to go out
of the world. Iâm not fit for it. Oh, I donât mean
suicide. Iâve not enough pluck. Thatâs off. But
I could go and bury myself in the wilderness somewhere
where no one would ever find me.â

âLaddie,â said McPhail, âI misdoubt that youâre
going to settle down in any wilderness. You havenât
the faculty of adaptability of which I have spoken
to-night at some length. And your heart is young
and not coated with the holy varnish of callousness,
which is a secret preparation known only to those
who have served a long apprenticeship in a severe
school of egotism.â

âThatâs all very well,â cried Doggie, âbut what
theâââ

Phineas waved an interrupting hand. âYouâve
got to go back, laddie. Youâve got to whip all the
moral courage in you and go back to Durdlebury.
The Dean, with his influence, and the letter you
have shown me from your Colonel, can easily get you
some honourable employment in either Service not so
exacting as the one which you have recently found yourself
unable to perform.â

Doggie threw a newly-lighted cigarette into the
fire and turned passionately on McPhail.

âI wonât. Youâre talking drivelling rot. I
canât. Iâd sooner die than go back there with my
tail between my legs. Iâd sooner enlist as a private
soldier.â

âEnlist?â said Phineas, and he drew himself up
straight and gaunt. âWell, why not?â

âEnlist?â echoed Doggie in a dull tone.

Â
âHave you never contemplated such a possibility?â

âGood God, no!â said Doggie.

âI have enlisted. And I am a man of ancient
lineage as honourable, so as not to enter into unproductive
argument, as yours. And I am a Master of Arts
of the two Universities of Glasgow and Cambridge.
Yet I fail to find anything dishonourable in my present
estate as 33702 Private Phineas McPhail in the British
Army.â

Doggie seemed not to hear him. He stared at him
wildly.

âEnlist?â he repeated. âAs a Tommy?â

âEven as a Tommy,â said Phineas. He glanced
at the ormolu clock. âIt is past one. The respectable
widow woman near the Elephant and Castle
who has let me a bedroom will be worn by anxiety
as to my non-return. Marmaduke, my dear, dear
laddie, I must leave you. If you will be lunching
here twelve hours hence, nothing will give me greater
pleasure than to join you. Laddie, do you think you
could manage a fried sole and a sweetbread?â

âEnlist?â said Doggie, following him out to the
front door in a dream.

He opened the door. Phineas shook hands.

âFried sole and a sweetbread at one-thirty?â

âOf course, with pleasure,â said Doggie.

Phineas fumbled in his pockets.

âItâs a long cry at this time of night from Bloomsbury
to the Elephant and Castle. You havenât the
price of a taxi fare about you, laddieâtwo or three
poundsââ?â

Doggie drew from his patent note-case a sheaf of one-pound
and ten-shilling treasury notes and handed them
over to McPhailâs vulture clutch.

âGood night, laddie!â

Â
âGood night!â

Phineas strode away into the blackness. Doggie
shut the front door and put up the chain and went
back into his sitting-room. He wound his fingers
in his hair.

âEnlist? My God!â

He lit a cigarette and after a few puffs flung it into
the grate. He stared at the alternatives.

Flight, which was cravenâa lifetime of self-contempt.
Durdlebury, which was impossible.
Enlistmentââ?

Yet what was a man incapable yet able-bodied,
honourable though disgraced, to do?

His landlord found him at seven oâclock in the
morning asleep in an arm-chair.

Â

CHAPTER IX

After
a bath and a change and breakfast,
Doggie went out for one of his solitary walks.
At Durdlebury such a night as the last would have
kept him in bed in a darkened room for most of the
following day. But he had spent many far, far worse
on Salisbury Plain, and the inexorable reveille had
dragged him out into the raw dreadful morning,
heedless of his headache and yearning for slumber,
until at last the process of hardening had begun.
To-day Doggie was as unfatigued a young man as
walked the streets of London, a fact which his mind
was too confusedly occupied to appreciate. Once
more was he beset less by the perplexities of the future
than by a sense of certain impending doom. For to
Phineas McPhailâs âWhy not?â he had been able
to give no answer. He could give no answer now, as
he marched with swinging step, automatically, down
Oxford Street and the Bayswater Road in the direction
of Kensington Gardens. He could give no
answer as he stood sightlessly staring at the Peter
Pan statue.

A one-armed man in a khaki cap and hospital blue
came and stood by his side and looked in a pleased
yet puzzled way at the exquisite poem in marble.
At last he spokeâin a rich Irish accent.

âI beg your pardon, sir, but could you be telling
me the meaning of it, at all?â

Doggie awoke and smiled.

Â
âDo you like it?â

âI do,â said the soldier.

âIt is about Peter Pan. A kind of Fairy Tale.
You can see the âlittle peopleâ peeping outâI think
you call them so in Ireland.â

âWe do that,â said the soldier.

So Doggie sketched the outline of the immortal
story of the Boy Who Will Never Grow Old, and the
Irishman listened with deep interest.

âIndeed,â said he after a time, âit is good to come
back to the true things after the things out there.â
He waved his one arm in the vague direction of the
war.

âWhy do you call them true things?â Doggie
asked quickly.

They turned away, and Doggie found himself
sitting on a bench by the manâs side.

âItâs not me that can tell you that,â said he, âand
my wife and children in Galway.â

âWere you there at the outbreak of war?â

He was. A reservist called back to the colours
after some years of retirement from the army. He
had served in India and South Africa, a hard-bitten
soldier, proud of the traditions of his old regiment.
There were scarcely any of them leftâand that was
all that was left of him. He smiled cheerily. Doggie
condoled with him on the loss of his arm.

âAh sure,â he replied, âand it might keep me out
of a fight when I go into Ballinasloe.â

âWho would you want to fight?â asked Doggie.

âThe dirty Sinn Feiners that do be always shouting
âFreedom for Ireland and to hell with freedom
for the rest of the world.â If I havenât lost my arm
in a glorious cause, what have I lost it for? Can you
tell me that?â

Â
Doggie agreed that he had fought for the greater
freedom of humanity and gave him a cigarette, and
they went on talking. The Irishman had been in
the retreat from Mons, the first battle of Ypres, and
he had lost his arm in no battle at all; just a stray
shell over the road as they were marching back to
billets. They discussed the war, the ethics of it.
Doggie still wanted to know why the realities of
blood and mud and destruction were not the true
things. Gradually he found that the Irishman meant
that the true things were the spiritual, undying things;
that the grim realities would pass away; that from
these dead realities would arise the noble ideals of
the future, which would be symbolized in song and
marble; that all he had endured and sacrificed was
but a part of the Great Sacrifice we were making
for the Freedom of the World. Being a man roughly
educated on a Galway farm and in an infantry regiment,
he had great difficulty in co-ordinating his ideas;
but he had a curious power of vision that enabled him
to pierce to the heart of things, which he interpreted
according to his untrained sense of beauty.

They parted with expressions of mutual esteem.
Doggie struck across the Gardens with a view to
returning home by Knightsbridge, Piccadilly and
Shaftesbury Avenue. He strode along, his thoughts
filled with the Irish soldier. Here was a man,
maimed for life and quite content that it should be so,
who had reckoned all the horrors through which he
had passed as externals unworthy of the consideration
of his unconquerable soul; a man simple, unassuming,
expansive only through his Celtic temperament,
which allowed him to talk easily to a stranger
before whom his English or Scotch comrade would
have been dumb and gaping as an oyster; obviously

Â
brave, sincere and loyal. Perhaps something even
higher. Perhaps, in essence, the very highest. The
Poet-Warrior. The term struck Doggieâs brain with
a thud, like the explosive fusion of two elements.

During his walk to Kensington Gardens a poisonous
current had run at the back of his mind. Drifting
on it, might he not escape? Was he not of too fine
a porcelain to mingle with the coarse and common
pottery of the ranks? Was it necessary to go into the
thick of the coarse clay vessels, just to be shattered?
It was easy for Phineas to proclaim that he found no
derogation to his dignity as a man of birth and a
university graduate in identifying himself with his
fellow privates. Phineas had systematically brutalized
himself into fitness for the position. He had armed
himself in brassâ
Ã¦s triplex
. He smiled at his own
wit. But he, James Marmaduke Trevor, who had
lived his life as a clean gentleman, was in a category
apart.

Now, he found that his talk with the Irishman had
been an antidote to the poison. He felt ashamed.
Did he dare set himself up to be finer clay than that
common soldier? Spiritually, was he even of clay as
fine? In a Great Judgment of Souls which of the
twain would be among the Elect? The ultra-refined
Mr. Marmaduke Trevor of Denby Hall, or the ignorant
poet-warrior of Ballinasloe? âNot Doggie
Trevor,â he said between his teeth. And he went
home in a chastened spirit.

Phineas McPhail appeared punctually at half-past
one, and feasted succulently on fried sole and sweetbread.

âLaddie,â said he, âthe man that can provide
such viands is a Thing of Beauty which, as the poet
says, is a Joy for Ever. The light in his window is

Â
a beacon to the hungry Tommy dragging himself
through the viscous wilderness of regulation stew.â

âIâm afraid it wonât be a beacon for very long,â
said Doggie.

âEh?â queried Phineas sharply. âYouâd surely
not be thinking of refusing an old friend a stray meal?â

Doggie coloured at the coarseness of the misunderstanding.

âHow could I be such a brute? There wonât
be a light in the window because I shanât be there.
Iâm going to enlist.â

Phineas put his elbows on the table and regarded
him earnestly.

âI would not take too seriously words spoken in
the heat of midnight revelry, even though the revel
was conducted on the genteelest principles. Have
you thought of the matter in the cool and sober hours
of the morning?â

âYes.â

âItâs an uncoâ hard life, laddie.â

âThe one Iâm leading is a harder,â said Doggie.
âIâve made up my mind.â

âThen Iâve one piece of advice to give you,â said
McPhail. âSink the name of Marmaduke, which
would only stimulate the ignorant ribaldry of the canteen,
and adopt the name of James, which your godfathers
and godmothers, with miraculous foresight,
considering their limitations in the matter of common
sense, have given you.â

âThatâs a good idea,â said Doggie.

âAlso it would tend to the obliteration of class
prejudices if you gave up smoking Turkish cigarettes
at ten shillings a hundred and arrived in your platoon
as an amateur of âfags.ââ

âI canât stand âfags,ââ said Doggie.

Â
âYou can. The human organism is so constituted
that it can stand the sweepings of the elephantsâ house
in the Zoological Gardens. Try. This time itâs only
âfags.ââ

Doggie took one from the crumpled paper packet
which was handed to him, and lit it. He made a
wry face, never before having smoked American
tobacco.

âHow do you like the flavour?â asked Phineas.

âI think Iâd prefer the elephantsâ house,â said
Doggie, eyeing the thing with disgust.

âYouâll find it the flavour of the whole British
Army,â said McPhail.

A few days later the Dean received a letter bearing
the pencilled address of a camp on the south coast, and
written by 35792 Pvte. James M. Trevor, A Company,
2-10th Wessex Rangers. It ran:

âI hope you wonât think me heartless for having
left you so long without news of me; but until lately
I had the same reasons for remaining in seclusion as
when I last wrote. Even now Iâm not asking for
sympathy or reconsideration of my failure or desire
in any way to take advantage of the generosity of you
all.

âI have enlisted in the 10th Wessex. Phineas
McPhail, whom I met in London and whose character
for good or evil I can better gauge now than formerly,
is a private in the same battalion. I donât pretend
to enjoy the life any more than I could enjoy living in
a kraal of savages in Central Africa. But that is a
matter of no account. I donât propose to return to
Durdlebury till the end of the war. I left it as an
officer and Iâm not coming back as a private soldier. I

Â
enclose a cheque for Â£500. Perhaps Aunt Sophia
will be so kind as to use the moneyâit ought to last
some timeâfor the general upkeep, wages, etc., of
Denby Hall. I feel sure she will not refuse me this
favour. Give Peggy my love and tell her I hope
she will accept the two-seater as a parting gift. It
will make me happier to know that she is driving it.

âI am keeping on as a
pied Ã  terre
in London the
Bloomsbury rooms in which I have been living,
and Iâve written to Peddle to see about making them
more comfortable. Please ask anybody who might
care to write to address me as âJames M.â and not
as âMarmaduke.ââ

The Dean read the letterâthe family were at
breakfast; then he took off his tortoise-shell spectacles
and wiped them.

âItâs from Marmaduke at last,â said he. âHe has
carried out my prophecy and enlisted.â

Peggy caught at her breath and shot out her hand
for the letter, which she read eagerly and then passed
over to her mother. Mrs. Conover began to cry.

âOh, the poor boy! It will be worse than ever
for him.â

âIt will,â said Peggy. âBut I think it splendid
of him to try. How did he bring himself to do it?â

âBreed tells,â said the Dean. âThatâs what
every one seems to have forgotten. Heâs a thoroughbred
Doggie. Thereâs the old French proverb:

Bon chien chasse de race.
â

Peggy looked at him gratefully. âYouâre very
comforting,â she said.

âWe must knit him some socks,â observed Mrs.
Conover. âI hear those supplied to the army are
very rough and ready.â

Â
âMy dear,â smiled the Dean, âMarmadukeâs
considerable income does not cease because his pay in
the army is one and twopence a day; and I should
think he would have the sense to provide himself
with adequate underclothing. Also, judging from the
account of your shopping orgy in London, he has
already laid in a stock that would last out several
Antarctic winters.â

The Dean tapped his egg gently.

âThen what can we do for the poor boy?â asked
his wife.

The Dean scooped the top of his egg off with a
vicious thrust.

âWe can cut out slanderous tongues,â said he.

There had been much calumniating cackle in the
little town; nay, more: cackle is of geese; there
had been venom of the snakiest kind. The Deanery,
father and mother and daughter, each in their several
ways, had suffered greatly. It is hard to stand up against
poisoned ridicule.

âMy dear,â continued the Dean, âit will be our
business to smite the Philistines, hip and thigh. The
reasons which guided Marmaduke in the resignation
of his commission are the concern of nobody. The
fact remains that Mr. Marmaduke Trevor resigned
his commission in order toâââ

Peggy interrupted with a smile. ââIn order toââisnât
that a bit Jesuitical, daddy?â

âI have a great respect for the Jesuits, my dear,â
said the Dean, holding out an impressive egg-spoon.
âThe fact remains, in the eyes of the world, as I
remarked, that Mr. Marmaduke Trevor of Denby
Hall, a man of fortune and high position in the county,
resigned his commission in order, for reasons best
known to himself, to serve his country more effectively

Â
in the humbler ranks of the army, andâmy dear,
this egg is far too full for war timeââwith a hazardous
plunge of his spoon he had made a yellow yelky
horror of the egg-shellââand Iâm going to proclaim
the fact far and wide, andâindeedârub it in.â

âThatâll be jolly decent of you, daddy,â said his
daughter. âIt will help a lot.â

In the failure of Marmaduke to retain his commission
the family honour had not been concerned.
The boy had done his best. They blamed not him
but the disastrous training that had unfitted him for
the command of men. They reproached themselves
for their haste in throwing him headlong into the
fiercest element of the national struggle towards
efficiency. They could have found an easier school,
in which he could have learned to do his share creditably
in the national work. Many young men of their
acquaintance, far more capable than Marmaduke,
were wearing the uniform of a less strenuous branch
of the service. It had been a blunder, a failure, but
without loss of honour. But when slanderous tongues
attacked poor Doggie for running away with a yelp
from a little hardship; when a story or two of Doggieâs
career in the regiment arrived in Durdlebury, highly
flavoured in transit and more and more poisoned as
it went from mouth to mouth; when a legend was
spread abroad that he had bolted from Salisbury
Plain and was run to earth in a Turkish Bath in
London, and was only saved from court-martial
by family influence, then the family honour of the
Conovers was wounded to its proud English depths.
And they could say nothing. They had only Doggieâs
word to go upon; they accepted it unquestioningly,
but they knew no details. Doggie had disappeared.
Naturally, they contradicted these evil rumours.

Â
The good folks of Durdlebury expected them to do
so, and listened with well-bred incredulity. To the
question, âWhere is he now and what is he going
to do?â they could only answer, âWe donât know.â
They were helpless.

Peggy had a bitter quarrel with one of her intimates,
Nancy Murdoch, daughter of the doctor who had
proclaimed the soundness of Marmadukeâs constitution.

âHe may have told you so, dear,â said Nancy,
âbut how do you know?â

âBecause whatever else he may be, heâs not a
liar,â retorted Peggy.

Nancy gave the most delicate suspicion of a shrug
to her pretty shoulders.

That was the beginning of it. Peggy, naturally
combative, armed for the fight and defended Marmaduke.

âYou talk as though you were still engaged to
him,â said Nancy.

âSo I am,â declared Peggy rashly.

âThen whereâs your engagement ring?â

âWhere I choose to keep it.â

The retort lacked originality and conviction.

âYou canât send it back to him, because you donât
know where he is. And what did Mrs. Conover
mean by telling mother that Mr. Trevor had broken
off the engagement?â

âShe never told her any such thing,â cried Peggy
mendaciously. For Mrs. Conover had committed
the indiscretion under assurance of silence.

âPardon me,â said Nancy, much on her dignity.
âOf course I understand your denying it. It isnât
pleasant to be thrown over by any manâbut by a
man like Doggie Trevorâââ

âYouâre a spiteful beast, Nancy, and Iâll never

Â
speak to you again. Youâve neither womanly decency
nor Christian feeling.â And Peggy marched out
of the doctorâs house.

As a result of the quarrel, however, she resumed
the wearing of the ring, which she flaunted defiantly
with left hand deliberately ungloved. Hitherto she
had not been certain of the continuance of the engagement.
Marmadukeâs repudiation was definite enough;
but it had been dictated by his sensitive honour.
It lay with her to agree or decline. She had passed
through wearisome days of doubt. A physically
sound fighting man sent about his business as being
unfit for war does not appear a romantic figure in a
girlâs eyes. She was bitterly disappointed with Doggie
for the sudden withering of her hopes. Had he
fulfilled them she could have loved him wholeheartedly,
after the simple way of women; for her
sex, exhilarated by the barbaric convulsion of the
land, clamoured for something heroic, something
at least intensely masculine, in which she could find
feminine exultation. She also felt resentment at his
flight from the Savoy, his silence and practical disappearance.
Although not blaming him unjustly,
she failed to realize the spiritual piteousness of his
plight. If the war has done anything in this country,
it has saved the young women of the gentler classes,
at any rate, from the abyss of sordid and cynical
materialism. Hesitating to announce the rupture
of the engagement, she allowed it to remain in a state
of suspended animation, and as a symbolic act, ceased
to wear the ring. Nancyâs taunts had goaded her to
a more heroic attitude. The first person to whom
she showed the newly-ringed hand was her mother.

âThe engagement isnât off until I declare itâs off.
Iâm going to play the game.â

Â
âYou know best, dear,â said the gentle Mrs.
Conover. âBut itâs all very upsetting.â

Then Doggieâs letter brought comfort and gladness
to the Deanery. It reassured them as to his fate.
It healed the wounded family honour. It justified
Peggy in playing the game.

She took the letter round to Dr. Murdochâs and
thrust it into the hand of an astonished Nancy, with
whom since the quarrel she had not been on speaking
terms.

âThis is in Marmadukeâs handwriting. You
recognize it. Just read the top line when Iâve folded
it. âI have enlisted in the 10th Wessex.â See?â
She withdrew the letter. âNow, what could a man,
let alone an honourable gentleman, do more? Say
youâre sorry for having said beastly things about him.â

Nancy, who had regretted the loss of a lifelong
friendship, professed her sorrow.

âThe least you can do then, is to go round and
spread the news, and say youâve seen the letter with
your own eyes.â

To several others, on a triumphant round of visits,
did she show the vindicating sentence. Any soft
young fool, she asserted, with the directness and not
unattractive truculence of her generation, can get a
commission and muddle through, but it took a man to
enlist as a private soldier.

âEverybody recognizes now, darling,â said the
reconciled Nancy a few days later, âthat Doggie
is a top-hole, splendid chap. But I think I ought
to tell you that youâre boring Durdlebury stiff.â

Peggy laughed. It was good to be engaged to a
man no longer under a cloud.

âIt will all come right, dear old thing,â she wrote
to Doggie. âItâs a cinch, as the Americans say.

Â
Youâll soon get used to itâespecially if you can
realize what it means to me. âSaving faceâ has been
an awful business. Now itâs all over. Of course,
Iâll accept the two-seater. Iâve had lessons in driving
since you went awayâI had thoughts of going out
to France to drive Y.M.C.A. cars, but thatâs off for
the present. Iâll love the two-seater. Swank wonât
be the word. But âa parting giftâ is all rot. The
engagement stands and all Durdlebury knows itâ¦â
and so on, and so on. She set herself out, honestly,
loyally, to be the kindest girl in the world to Doggie.
Mrs. Conover happened to come into the drawing-room
just as she was licking the stamp. She thumped
it on the envelope with her palm and, looking round
from the writing-desk against the wall, showed her
mother a flushed and smiling face.

âIf anybody says Iâm not goodâthe goodest
thing the cathedral has turned out for half a dozen
centuriesâIâll tear her horrid eyes out from their
sockets!â

âMy dear!â cried her horrified mother.

Doggie kept the letter unopened in his tunic pocket
until he could find solitude in which to read it. After
morning parade he wandered to the deserted trench
at the end of the camp, where the stuffed sacks, representing
German defenders, were hung for bayonet
practice. It was a noon of grey mist through which
the alignments of huts and tents were barely visible.
Instinctively avoiding the wet earth of the parados,
he went round, and, tired after the recent spell of
physical drill, sat down on the equally wet sandbags
of the model parapet, a pathetic, lonely little khaki
figure isolated for the moment by the kindly mist from
an uncomprehending world.

Â
He read Peggyâs letter several times. He recognized
her goodness, her loyalty. The grateful tears
even came to his eyes and he brushed them away hurriedly
with a swift look round. But his heart beat
none the faster. A long-faded memory of childhood
came back to him in regained colour. Some quarrel
with Peggy. What it was all about he had entirely
forgotten; but he remembered her little flushed face
and her angry words: âWell, Iâm a sport and you
ainât!â He remembered also rebuking her priggishly
for unintelligible language and mincing away.
He read the letter again in the light of this flash of
memory. The only difference between it and the
childish speech lay in the fact that instead of a declaration
of contrasts, she now uttered a declaration of
similitudes. They were both âsports.â There she
was wrong. Doggie shook his head. In her sense
of the word he was not a âsport.â A sport takes
chances, plays the game with a smile on his lips.
There was no smile on his. He loathed the game with
a sickening, shivering loathing. He was engaged in
it because a conglomeration of irresistible forces had
driven him into the
mÃªlÃ©e
. It never occurred to
Doggie that he was under orders of his own soul.
This simple yet stupendous fact never occurred to
Peggy.

He sat on the wet sandbags and thought and thought.
Though he reproached himself for base ingratitude,
the letter did not satisfy him. It left his heart cold.
What he sought in it he did not know. It was something
he could not find, something that was not
there. The sea-mist thickened around him. Peggy
seemed very far awayâ¦. He was still engaged
to herâfor it would be monstrous to persist in his
withdrawal. He must accept the situation which

Â
she decreed. He owed that to her loyalty. But
how to continue the correspondence? It was hard
enough to write from Salisbury Plain; from here it
was well-nigh impossible.

Thus was Doggie brought up against a New Problem.
He struggled desperately to defer its solution.

Â

CHAPTER X

The
regiments of the new armies have gathered
into their rank and file a mixed crowd transcending
the dreams of Democracy. At one end of
the social scale are men of refined minds and gentle
nurture, at the other creatures from the slums, with
slum minds and morals, and between them the whole
social gamut is run. Experience seems to show that
neither of the extreme elements tend, in the one case
to elevate, or in the other to debase the battalion.
Leading the common life, sharing the common hardships,
striving towards common ideals, they inevitably,
irresistibly tend to merge themselves in the average.
The highest in the scale sink, the lowest rise. The
process, as far as the change of soul state is concerned,
is infinitely more to the amelioration of the lowest
than to the degradation of the highest. The one, also,
is more real, the other more apparent. In the one
case, it is merely the shuffling-off of manners, of habits,
of prejudices, and the assuming of others horribly distasteful
or humorously accepted, according to temperament;
in the other case, it is an enforced education.
And all the congeries of human atoms that make up
the battalion, learn new and precious lessons and
acquire new virtuesâpatience, obedience, courage,
enduranceâ¦. But from the point of view of a
decorous tea-party in a cathedral town, the toneâor
the standard of manners, or whatever you would like
by way of definition of that vague and comforting

Â
wordâthe tone of the average is deplorably low. The
hooligan may be kicked for excessive foulness; but
the rider of the high horse is brutally dragged down
into the mire. The curious part of it all is that, the
gutter element being eliminated altogether, the corporate
standard of the remaining majority is lower
than the standard of each individual.

By developing a philosophical disquisition on some
such lines did Phineas McPhail seek to initiate Doggie
into the weird mysteries of the new social life. Doggie
heard with his ears, but thought in terms of Durdlebury
tea-parties. Nowhere in the mass could he find
the spiritual outlook of his Irish poet-warrior. The
individuals that may have had it kept it preciously to
themselves. The outlook, as conveyed in speech, was
grossly materialistic. From the language of the canteen
he recoiled in disgust. He could not reconcile it
with the nobler attributes of the users. It was in vain
for Phineas to plead that he must accept the
lingua
franca
of the British Army like all other things appertaining
thereto. Doggieâs stomach revolted against
most of the other things. The disregard (from his
point of view) of personal cleanliness universal in the
ranks, filled him with dismay. Even on Salisbury
Plain he had managed to get a little hot water for his
morning tub. Here, save in the officersâ quartersâcuriously
remote, inaccessible paradise!âthere was not
such a thing as a tub in the place, let alone hot water
to fill it. The men never dreamed of such a thing
as a tub. As a matter of fact, they were scrupulously
clean according to the lights of the British Tommy;
but the lights were not those of Marmaduke Trevor.
He had learned the supreme wisdom of keeping lips
closed on such matters and did not complain, but all
his fastidiousness rebelled. He hated the sluice of head

Â
and shoulders with water from a bucket in the raw
open air. His hands swelled, blistered and cracked;
and his nails, once so beautifully manicured, grew
rich black rims, and all the icy water in the buckets
would not remove the grime.

Now and then he went into the town and had a hot
bath; but very few of the others ever seemed to think
of such a thing. The habit of the British Army of
going to bed in its day-shirt was peculiarly repellent.
Yet Doggie knew that to vary from the sacred ways
of his fellow-men was to bring disaster on his head.

Some of the men slept under canvas still. But
Doggie, fortunately as he reckoned (for he had begun
to appreciate fine shades in misery), was put with a
dozen others in a ramshackle hut of which the woodwork
had warped and let in the breezes above, below,
and all round the sides. Doggie, though dismally cold,
welcomed the air for obvious reasons. They were
fortunate, too, in having straw palliassesârecently provided
when it was discovered that sleeping on badly
boarded floors with fierce draughts blowing upwards
along human spines was strangely fatal to human
bodiesâbut Doggie found his bed very hard lying.
And it smelt sour and sickly. For nights, in spite
of fatigue, he could not sleep. His mates sang and
talked and bandied jests and sarcasms of esoteric meaning.
Some of the recruits from factories or farms
satirized their officers for peculiarities common to
their social caste and gave grotesque imitations of their
mode of speech. Doggie wondered, but held his peace.
The deadly stupidity and weariness of it all! And
when the talk stopped and they settled to sleep, the
snorings and mutterings and coughings began and kept
poor Doggie awake most of the night. The irremediable,
intimate propinquity with coarse humanity

Â
oppressed him. He would have given worlds to go
out, even into the pouring rain, and walk about the
camp or sleep under a hedge, so long as he could be
alone. And he would think longingly of his satinwood
bedroom, with its luxurious bed and lavender-scented
sheets, and of his beloved peacock and ivory
room and its pictures and exquisite furniture and
the great fire roaring up the chimney, and devise
intricate tortures for the Kaiser who had dragged
him down to this squalor.

The mealsâthe rough cooking, the primitive
serviceâthe table manners of his companions, offended
his delicate senses. He missed napkins. Never could
he bring himself to wipe his mouth with the back of
his hand and the back of his hand on the seat of his
trousers. Nor could he watch with equanimity an
honest soul pick his teeth with his little finger. But
Doggie knew that acquiescence was the way of happiness
and protest the way of woe.

At first he made few acquaintances beyond those
with whom he was intimately associated. It seemed
more politic to obey his instincts and remain unobtrusive
in company and drift away inoffensively when
the chance occurred. One of the men with whom
he talked occasionally was a red-headed little cockney
by the name of Shendish. For some reason or the
otherâperhaps because his name conveyed a perfectly
wrong suggestion of the Hebraicâhe was always
called âMoâ Shendish.

âDonât yer wish yer was back, mate?â he asked
one day, having waited to speak till Doggie had
addressed and stamped a letter which he was writing
at the end of the canteen table.

âWhere?â said Doggie.

ââOme, sweet âome. In the family castle, where

Â
gilded footmen âands sausage and mash about on trays
and quarts of beer all day long. I do.â

âYouâre a lucky chap to have a castle,â said Doggie.

Mo Shendish grinned. He showed little yellow
teeth beneath a little red moustache.

âI ainât âalf got one,â said he. âItâs in Mare
Street, Hackney. I wish I was there now.â

He sighed, and in an abstracted way he took a half-smoked
cigarette from behind his ear and relit it.

âWhat were yer before yer joined? Yer look like a
clerk.â He pronounced it as if it were spelt with a âu.â

âSomething of the sort,â replied Doggie cautiously.

âOne can always tell you eddicated blokes. Making
your five quid a week easy, I suppose?â

âAbout that,â said Doggie. âWhat were you?â

âI was making my thirty bob a week regular. I
was in the fish business, I was. And now Iâm
serving my ruddy country at one and twopence a day.
Funny life, ainât it?â

âI canât say itâs very enjoyable,â said Doggie.

âNot the same as sitting in a snug orfis all day with
a pen in your lily-white âand, and going âome to your
âigh tea in a top âat. What made you join up?â

âThe force of circumstances,â said Doggie.

âSame âere,â said Mo; âonly I couldnât put it
into such fancy language. First my pals went out
one after the other. Then the gels began to look
saucy at me, and at last one particular bit of skirt
what Iâd been walking out with took to promenading
with a blighter in khaki. Itâd have been silly of me
to go and knock his âead off, so I enlisted. And itâs
all right now.â

âJust the same sort of thing in my case,â replied
Doggie. âIâm glad things are right with the young
lady.â

Â
âFirst class. Sheâs straight, she is, and no mistake
abaht it. Sheâs aâââ

He paused for a word to express the inexpressive
she.

ââA paragonâa peach?ââDoggie corrected
himself. Then, as the sudden frown of perplexed
suspicion was swiftly replaced by a grin of content,
he was struck by a bright idea.

âWhatâs her name?â

âAggie. Whatâs yours?â

âGladys,â replied Doggie with miraculous readiness
of invention.

âIâve got her photograph,â Shendish confided in
a whisper, and laid his hand on his tunic pocket.
Then he looked round at the half-filled canteen to
see that he was unobserved. âYou wonât give me
away if I show it yer, will yer?â

Doggie swore secrecy. The photograph of Aggie,
an angular, square-browed damsel, who looked as
though she could guide the most recalcitrant of fishmongers
into the paths of duty, was produced and
thrust into Doggieâs hand. He inspected it with
polite appreciation, while his red-headed friend regarded
him with fatuous anxiety.

âCharming! charming!â said Doggie in his
pleasantest way. âWhatâs her colouring?â

âFair hair and blue eyes,â said Shendish.

The kindly question, half idle yet unconsciously
tactful, was one of those human things which cost
so little but are worth so much. It gave Doggie a
devoted friend.

âMo,â said he, a day or two later, âyouâre such
a decent chap. Why do you use such abominable
language?â

âGawd knows,â smiled Mo, unabashed. âI

Â
suppose itâs friendly like.â He wrinkled his brow in
thought for an instant. âThatâs where I think
youâre making a mistake, old pal, if you donât mind
my mentioning it. I know what yer are, but the
others donât. Youâre not friendly enough. See
what I mean? Supposinâ you say as you would in
a city restoorang when youâre âaving yer lunch, âWill
yer kindly pass me the salt?ââwell, thatâs standoffishâthey
say âCome off it! âBut if you look about
and say, âWhereâs the bâây salt?â thatâs friendly.
They understand. They chuck it at you.â

Said Doggie, âItâs veryâI mean bââyâdifficult.â

So he tried to be friendly; and if he met with no
great positive success, he at least escaped animosity.
In his spare time he mooned about by himself, shy,
disgusted, and miserable. Once, when a group of
men were kicking a football about, the ball rolled his
way. Instead of kicking it back to the expectant
players, he picked it up and advanced to the nearest
and handed it to him politely.

âThanks, mate,â said the astonished man, âbut
why didnât you kick it?â

He turned away without waiting for a reply.
Doggie had not kicked it because he had never kicked
a football in his life and shrank from an exhibition of
incompetence.

At drill things were easier than on Salisbury Plain,
his actions being veiled in the obscurity of squad or
platoon or company. Many others besides himself
were cursed by sergeants and rated by subalterns and
drastically entreated by captains. He had the consolation
of community in suffering. As a trembling
officer he had been the only one, the only one marked
and labelled as a freak apart, the only one stuck in the

Â
eternal pillory. Here were fools and incapables even
more dull and ineffective than he. A plough-boy
fellow-recruit from Dorsetshire, Pugsley by name,
did not know right from left, and having mastered the
art of forming fours, could not get into his brain the
reverse process of forming front. He wept under the
lash of the corporalâs tongue; and to Doggie these
tears were healing dews of Heavenâs distillation.
By degrees he learned the many arts of war as taught
to the private soldier in England. He could refrain
from shutting his eyes when he pressed the trigger
of his rifle, but to the end of his career his shooting
was erratic. He could perform with the weapon
the other tricks of precision. Unencumbered he
could march with the best. The torture of the
heavy pack nearly killed him; but in time, as his
muscles developed, he was able to slog along under the
burden. He even learned to dig. That was the
worst and most back-breaking art of all.

Now and then Phineas McPhail and himself would
get together and walk into the little seaside town. It
was out of the season and there was little to look
at save the deserted shops and the squall-fretted pier
and the maidens of the place who usually were in
company with lads in khaki. Sometimes a girl alone
would give Doggie a glance of shy invitation, for Doggie
in his short slight way was not a bad-looking
fellow, carrying himself well and wearing his uniform
with instinctive grace. But the damsel ogled in vain.

On one such occasion Phineas burst into a guffaw.

âWhy donât you talk to the poor body? Sheâs a
respectable girl enough. Whereâs the harm?â

âGo âsquare-pushingâ?â said Doggie contemptuously,
using the soldiersâ slang for walking about with
a young woman. âNo, thank you.â

Â
âAnd why not? Iâm not counselling you, laddie,
to plunge into a course of sensual debauchery. But
a wee bit gossip with a pretty innocent girlâââ

âMy dear good chap,â Doggie interrupted, âwhat
on earth should I have in common with her?â

âYouth.â

âI feel as old as hell,â said Doggie bitterly.

âYouâll be feeling older soon,â replied Phineas,
âand able to look down on hell with feelings of
superiority.â

Doggie walked on in silence for a few paces. Then
he said:

âA thing I canât understand is this mania for
picking up girlsâjust to walk about the streets with
them. Itâs so inane. Itâs a disease.â

âDid you ever consider,â said Phineas, âhow in
a station less exalted than that which you used to
adorn, the young of opposite sexes manage to meet,
select and marry? Man, the British Armyâs going
to be a grand education for you in sociology.â

âWell, at any rate, you donât suppose Iâm going
to select and marry out of the street?â

âYou might do worse,â said Phineas. Then,
after a slight pause, he asked: âHave you any news
lately from Durdlebury?â

âConfound Durdlebury!â said Doggie.

Phineas checked him with one hand and waved
the other towards a hostelry on the other side of the
street. âIf you will give me the money in advance,
so as to evade the ungenerous spirit of the no-treating
law, you can stand me a quart of ale at the Crown and
Sceptre and join me in drinking to its confusion.â

So they entered the saloon bar of the public-house.
Doggie drank a glass of beer while Phineas swallowed
a couple of pints. Two or three other soldiers were

Â
there, in whose artless talk McPhail joined lustily.
Doggie, unobtrusive at the end of the bar, maintained
a desultory and uncomfortable conversation with the
barmaid, who was of the florid and hearty type, about
the weather.

Some days later, McPhail again made allusion to
Durdlebury. Doggie again confounded it.

âI donât want to hear of it or think of it,â he
exclaimed, in his nervous way, âuntil this filthy
horror is over. They want me to get leave and go
down and stay. Theyâre making my life miserable
with kindness. I wish theyâd let me alone. They
donât understand a little bit. I want to get through
this thing alone, all by myself.â

âIâm sorry I persuaded you to join a regiment in
which you were inflicted with the disadvantage of my
society,â said Phineas.

Doggie threw out an impatient arm. âOh, you
donât count,â said he.

A few minutes afterwards, repenting his brusqueness,
he tried to explain to Phineas why he did not
count. The others knew nothing about him. Phineas
knew everything.

âAnd you know everything about Phineas,â said
McPhail grimly. âAy, ay, laddie,â he sighed,
âI ken it all. When youâre in Tophet, a sympathetic
Tophetuan with a wee drop of the milk of human
kindness is more comfort than a radiant angel who
showers down upon you, from the celestial Fortnum
and Masonâs, potted shrimps and caviare.â

The sombreness cleared for a moment from Doggieâs
young brow.

âI never can make up my mind, Phineas,â said he,
âwhether youâre a very wise man or an awful fraud.â

âGive me the benefit of the doubt, laddie,â replied

Â
McPhail. âItâs the grand theological principle of
Christianity.â

Time went on. The regiment was moved to the East
Coast. On the journey a Zeppelin raid paralysed
the railway service. Doggie spent the night under the
lee of the bookstall at Waterloo Station. Men huddled
up near him, their heads on their kit-bags, slept and
snored. Doggie almost wept with pain and cold and
hatred of the Kaiser. On the East Coast much the
same life as on the South, save that the wind, as if
Hun-sent, found its way more savagely to the skin.

Then suddenly came the news of a large draft for
France, which included both McPhail and Shendish.
They went away on leave. The gladness with which
he welcomed their return showed Doggie how great
a part they played in his new life. In a day or two
they would depart God knew whither, and he would
be left in dreadful loneliness. Through him the two
men, the sentimental Cockney fishmonger and the
wastrel Cambridge graduate, had become friends.
He spent with them all his leisure time.

Then one of the silly tragi-comedies of life occurred.
McPhail got drunk in the crowded bar of a little
public-house in the village. It was the last possible
drink together of the draft and their pals. The draft
was to entrain before daybreak on the morrow. It
was a foolish, singing, shouting khaki throng. McPhail,
who had borrowed ten pounds from Doggie,
in order to see him through the hardships of the Front,
established himself close by the bar and was drinking
whisky. He was also distributing surreptitious sixpences
and shillings into eager hands, which would
convert them into alcohol for eager throats. Doggie,
anxious, stood by his side. The spirit from which
McPhail had for so long abstained, mounted to his

Â
unaccustomed brain. He began to hector, and, master
of picturesque speech, he compelled an admiring
audience. Doggie did not realize the extent of his
drunkenness until, vaunting himself as a Scot and
therefore the salt of the army, he picked a quarrel
with a stolid Hampshire giant, who professed to have
no use for Phineasâs fellow-countrymen. The men
closed. Suddenly some one shouted from the doorway:

âBe quiet, you fools! The A.P.M.âs coming
down the road.â

Now the Assistant Provost Marshal, if he heard
hellâs delight going on in a tavern, would naturally
make an inquisitorial appearance. The combatants
were separated. McPhail threw a shilling on the
bar counter and demanded another whisky. He was
about to lift the glass to his lips when Doggie, terrified
as to what might happen, knocked the glass out of his
hand.

âDonât be an ass,â he cried.

Phineas was very drunk. He gazed at his old
pupil, took off his cap, and, stretching over the bar,
hung it on the handle of a beer-pull. Then, staggering
back, he pointed an accusing finger.

âHe has the audacity to call me an ass. Little
blinking Marmaduke Doggie Trevor. Little Doggie
Trevor, whom I trained up from infancy in the way
he shouldnât goâââ

âWhy Doggie Trevor?â some one shouted in
inquiry.

âNever mind,â replied Phineas with drunken
impressiveness. âMy old friend Marmaduke has
spilled my whisky and called me an ass. I call him
Doggie, little Doggie Trevor. You all bear witness
he knocked the drink out of my mouth. Iâll never
forgive him. He doesnât like being called Doggieâand

Â
Iâve noâno predâlexân to be called an ass. Iâll
be thinking Iâm going just to strangle him.â

He struck out his bony claws towards the shrinking
Doggie; but stout arms closed round him and
a horny hand was clamped over his mouth, and they
got him through the bar and the back parlour into
the yard, where they pumped water on his head.
And when the A.P.M. and his satellites passed by,
the quiet of The Whip in Hand was the holy peace
of a nunnery.

Doggie and Mo Shendish and a few other staunch
souls got McPhail back to quarters without much
trouble. On parting, the delinquent, semi-sobered,
shook Doggie by the hand and smiled with an air of
great affection.

âIâve been verra drunk, laddie. And Iâve been
angry with you for the first time in my life. But
when you knocked the glass out of my hand I thought
you were in danger of losing your good manners in
the army. Weâll have many a pow-wow together
when you join me out there.â

The matter would have drifted out of Doggieâs
mind as one of no importance had not the detested
appellation by which Phineas hailed him struck the
imagination of his comrades. It filled a long-felt
want, no nickname for Private J. M. Trevor having
yet been invented. Doggie Trevor he was and Doggie
Trevor he remained for the rest of his period of service.
He resigned himself to the inevitable. The sting had
gone out of the name through his comradesâ ignorance
of its origin. But he loathed it as much as ever; it
sounded in his ears an everlasting reproach.

In spite of the ill turn done in drunkenness, Doggie
missed McPhail. He missed Mo Shendish, his more
constant companion, even more. Their place was in

Â
some degree taken, or rather usurped, for it was without
Doggieâs volition, by âTaffyâ Jones, once clerk to
a firm of outside bookmakers. As Doggie had never
seen a racecourse, had never made a bet, and was
entirely ignorant of the names even of famous Derby
winners, Taffy regarded him as an astonishing freak
worth the attention of a student of human nature.
He began to cultivate Doggieâs virgin mind by aid of
reminiscence, and of such racing news as was to
be found in the
Sportsman
. He was a garrulous
person and Doggie a good listener. To please him
Doggie backed horses, through the old firm, for small
sums. The fact of his being a man of large independent
means both he and Phineas (to his credit) had kept
a close secret, his clerkly origin divined and promulgated
by Mo Shendish being unquestioningly accepted, so
the bets proposed by Taffy were of a modest nature.
Once he brought off a forty to one chance. Taffy
rushed to him with the news, dancing with excitement.
Doggieâs stoical indifference to the winning of twenty
pounds, a yearâs army pay, gave him cause for great
wonder. As Doggie showed similar equanimity when
he lost, Taffy put him down as a born sportsman.
He began to admire him tremendously.

This friendship with Taffy is worth special record,
for it was indirectly the cause of a little revolution in
Doggieâs regimental life. Taffy was an earnest though
indifferent performer on the penny whistle. It was
his constant companion, the solace of his leisure moments
and one of the minor tortures of Doggieâs
existence. His version of the
Marseillaise
was
peculiarly excruciating.

One day, when Taffy was playing it with dreadful
variations of his own to an admiring group in the
Y.M.C.A. hut, Doggie, his nerves rasped to the raw

Â
by the false notes and maddening intervals, snatched
it out of his hand and began to play himself. Hitherto,
shrinking morbidly from any form of notoriety, he
had shown no sign of musical accomplishment. But
to-day the musicianâs impulse was irresistible. He
played the
Marseillaise
as no one there had heard it
on penny whistle before. The hut recognized a
masterâs touch, for Doggie was a fine executant
musician. When he stopped there was a roar: âGo
on!â Doggie went on. They kept him whistling
till the hut was crowded.

Thenceforward he was penny-whistler, by excellence,
to the battalion. He whistled himself into
quite a useful popularity.

Â

CHAPTER XI

âWeâre
all very proud of you, Marmaduke,â
said the Dean.

âI think youâre just splendid,â said Peggy.

They were sitting in Doggieâs rooms in Woburn
Place, Doggie having been given his three daysâ leave
before going to France. Once again Durdlebury had
come to Doggie and not Doggie to Durdlebury.
Aunt Sophia, however, somewhat ailing, had stayed
at home.

Doggie stood awkwardly before them, conscious of
swollen hands and broken nails, shapeless ammunition
boots and ill-fitting slacks; morbidly conscious, too,
of his original failure.

âYouâre about ten inches more round the chest
than you were,â said the Dean admiringly.

âAnd the picture of health,â cried Peggy.

âFor anyone who has a sound constitution,â
answered Doggie, âit is quite a healthy life.â

âNow that youâve got into the way, Iâm sure you
must really love it,â said Peggy with an encouraging
smile.

âIt isnât so bad,â he replied.

âWhat none of us can quite understand, my dear
fellow,â said the Dean, âis your shying at Durdlebury.
As we have written you, everybodyâs singing your
praises. Not a soul but would have given you a
hearty welcome.â

âBesides,â Peggy chimed in, âyou neednât have

Â
made an exhibition of yourself in the town if you didnât
want to. The poor Peddles are woefully disappointed.â

âThereâs a war going on. They must bear upâlike
lots of other people,â replied Doggie.

âHeâs becoming quite cynical,â Peggy laughed.
âBut, apart from the Peddles, thereâs your own
beautiful house waiting for you. It seems so funny
not to go to it, instead of moping in these fusty lodgings.â

âPerhaps,â said Doggie quietly, âif I went there
I should never want to come back.â

âThereâs something to be said from that point of
view,â the Dean admitted. âA solution of continuity
is never quite without its dangers. Even Oliver
confessed as much.â

âOliver?â

âYes, didnât Peggy tell you?â

âI didnât think Marmaduke would be interested,â
said Peggy quickly. âHe and Oliver have never
been what you might call bosom friends.â

âI shouldnât have minded about hearing of him,â
said Doggie. âWhy should I? Whatâs he doing?â

The Dean gave information. Oliver, now a captain,
had come home on leave a month ago, and had
spent some of it at the Deanery. He had seen a good
deal of fighting, and had one or two narrow escapes.

âWas he keen to get back?â asked Doggie.

The Dean smiled. âI instanced his case in my
remark as to the dangers of the solution of
continuity.â

âOh, rubbish, daddy,â cried his daughter, with a
flush, âOliver is as keen as mustard.â The Dean
made a little gesture of submission. She continued.
âHe doesnât like the beastliness out there for its own
sake, any more than Marmaduke will. But he simply

Â
loves his job. He has improved tremendously. Once
he thought he was the only man in the country who
had seen Life stark naked, and he put on frills accordingly
Now that heâs just one of a million who have
been up against Life stripped to its skeleton, heâs a bit
subdued.â

âIâm glad of that,â said Doggie.

The Dean, urbanely indulgent, joined his fingertips
together and smiled. âPeggy is right,â said he,
âalthough I donât wholly approve of her modern
lack of reticence in metaphor. Oliver is coming out
true gold from the fire. Heâs a capital fellow. And
he spoke of you, my dear Marmaduke, in the kindest
way in the world. He has a tremendous admiration
for your pluck.â

âThatâs very good of him, Iâm sure,â said Doggie.

Presently the Deanâgood, tactful manâdiscovered
that he must go out and have a prescription made up
at a chemistâs. That arch-Hun enemy, the gout,
against which he must never be unprepared. He
would be back in time for dinner. The engaged
couple were left alone.

âWell?â said Peggy.

âWell, dear?â said Doggie.

Her lips invited. He responded. She drew him
to the saddle-bag sofa, and they sat down side by side.

âI quite understand, dear old thing,â she said. âI
know the resignation and the rest of it hurt you
awfully. It hurt me. But itâs no use grousing over
spilt milk. Youâve already mopped it all up. Itâs
no disgrace to be a private. Itâs an honour. There
are thousands of gentlemen in the ranks. Besidesâyouâll
work your way up and theyâll offer you another
commission in no time.â

âYouâre very good and sweet, dear,â said Doggie,

Â
âto have such faith in me. But Iâve had a yearâââ

âA year!â cried Peggy. âGood lord! so it is.â
She counted on her fingers. âNot quite. But eleven
months. Itâs eleven months since Iâve seen you. Do
you realize that? The war has put a stop to time.
It is just one endless day.â

âOne awful, endless day,â Doggie acquiesced with
a smile. âBut I was sayingâIâve had a year, or an
endless day of eleven months, in which to learn myself.
And what I donât know about myself isnât knowledge.â

Peggy interrupted with a laugh. âYou must be
a wonder. Dadâs always preaching about self-knowledge.
Tell me all about it.â

Doggie shook his head, at the same time passing
his hand over it in a familiar gesture.

Then Peggy cried:

âI knew there was something wrong with you.
Why didnât you tell me? Youâve had your hair cutâcut
quite differently.â

It was McPhail, careful godfather, who had taken
him as a recruit to the regimental barber and prescribed
a transformation from the sleek long hair brushed
back over the head to a conventional military crop
with a rudiment of a side parting. On the crown a
few bristles stood up as if uncertain which way to go.

âItâs advisable,â Doggie replied, âfor a Tommyâs
hair to be cut as short as possible. The Germans are
sheared like convicts.â

Peggy regarded him open-eyed and puzzle-browed.
He enlightened her no further, but pursued the main
proposition.

âI wouldnât take a commission,â said he, âif the
War Office went mad and sank on its knees and beat
its head in the dust before me.â

âIn Heavenâs name, why not?â

Â
âIâve learned my place in the world,â said Doggie.

Peggy shook him by the shoulder and turned on
him her young eager face.

âYour place in the world is that of a cultivated
gentleman of old family, Marmaduke Trevor of Denby
Hall.â

âThat was the funny old world,â said he, âthat
stood on its legsâlegs wide apart with its hands beneath
the tails of its dress-coat, in front of the drawing-room
fire. The present worldâs standing on its head.
Everythingâs upside-down. It has no sort of use for
Marmaduke Trevor of Denby Hall. No more use
than for Goliath. By the way, how is the poor
little beast getting on?â

Peggy laughed. âOh, Goliath is perfectly assured
of his position. He has got it rammed into his mind
that he drives the two-seater.â She returned to the
attack. âDo you intend always to remain a private?â

âI do,â said he. âNot even a corporal. You
see, Iâve learned to be a private of sorts, and that
satisfies my ambition.â

âWell, I give it up,â said Peggy. âThough why
you wouldnât let dad get you a nice cushy job is
a thing I canât understand. For the life of me I
canât.â

âIâve made my bed, and I must lie on it,â he said
quietly.

âI donât believe youâve got such a thing as a bed.â

Doggie smiled. âOh yes, a bed of a sort.â Then
noting her puzzled face, he said consolingly: âItâll
all come right when the warâs over.â

âBut when will that be? And who knows, my
dear man, what may happen to you?â

âIf Iâm knocked out, Iâm knocked out, and thereâs
an end of it,â replied Doggie philosophically.

Â
She put her hand on his. âBut whatâs to become
of me?â

âWe neednât cry over my corpse yet,â said Doggie.

The Dean, after awhile, returned with his bottle
of medicine, which he displayed with conscientious
ostentation. They dined. Peggy again went over
the ground of the possible commission.

âIâm afraid she has set her heart on it, my boy,â
said the Dean.

Peggy cried a little on parting. This time Doggie
was going, not to the fringe, but to the heart of the
Great Adventure. Into the thick of the carnage. A
year ago, she said, through her tears, she would have
thought herself much more fitted for it than Marmaduke.

âPerhaps you are still, dear,â said Doggie, with
his patient smile.

He saw them to the taxi which was to take them
to the familiar Sturrocksâs. Before getting in, Peggy
embraced him.

âKeep out of the way of shells and bullets as much
as you can.â

The Dean blew his nose, God-blessed him, and
murmured something incoherent about fighting for the
glory of old England.

âGood luck,â cried Peggy from the window.

She blew him a kiss. The taxi drove off, and Doggie
went back into the house with leaden feet. The
meeting, which he had morbidly dreaded, had brought
him no comfort. It had not removed the invisible
barrier between Peggy and himself. But Peggy
seemed so unconscious of it that he began to wonder
whether it only existed in his diseased imagination.
Though by his silences and reserves he had given her
cause for resentment and reproach, her attitude was

Â
nothing less than angelic. He sat down moodily in
an arm-chair, his hands deep in his trousers pockets and
his legs stretched out. The fault lay in himself, he
argued. What was the matter with him? He seemed
to have lost all human feeling, like the man with the
stone heart in the old legend. Otherwise, why had
he felt no prick of jealousy at Peggyâs admiring comprehension
of Oliver? Of course he loved her. Of
course he wanted to marry her when this nightmare
was over. That went without saying. But why
couldnât he look to the glowing future? A poet had
called a loverâs mistress âthe lode-star of his one
desire.â That to him Peggy ought to be. Lode-star.
One desire. The words confused him. He
had no lode-star. His one desire was to be left alone.
Without doubt he was suffering from some process
of moral petrifaction.

Doggie was no psychologist. He had never acquired
the habit of turning himself inside-out and gloating
over the horrid spectacle. All his life he had been
a simple soul with simple motives and a simple though
possibly selfish standard to measure them. But now
his soul was knocked into a chaotic state of complexity,
and his poor little standards were no manner of use.
He saw himself as in a glass darkly, mystified by
unknown change.

He rose, sighed, shook himself.

âI give it up,â said he, and went to bed.

Doggie went to France; a France hitherto undreamed
of, either by him or by any young Englishman;
a France clean swept and garnished for war;
a France, save for the ubiquitous English soldiery, of
silent towns and empty villages and deserted roads;
a France of smiling fields and sorrowful faces of

Â
women and drawn patient faces of old menâand even
then the women and old men were rarely met by
day, for they were at work on the land, solitary figures
on the landscape, with vast spaces between them. In
the quiet townships, English street signs and placards
conflicted with the sense of being in friendly provincial
France, and gave the impression of foreign domination.
For beyond that long grim line of eternal thunder,
away over there in the distance, which was called
the Front, street signs and placards in yet another alien
tongue also outraged the serene genius of French urban
life. Yet our signs were a symbol of a mighty Empireâs
brotherhood, and the dimmed eyes that beheld the

Place de la Fontaine
transformed into âHolborn
Circus,â and the
Grande Rue
into âPiccadilly,â smiled,
and the owners, with eager courtesy, directed the
stray Tommy to âRegent Street,â which they had
known all their life as the
Rue Feuillemaisnil
âa word
which Tommy could not pronounce, still less remember.
It was as much as Tommy could do to
get hold of an approximation to the name of the town.
And besides these renamings, other inscriptions flamed
about the streets; alphabetical hieroglyphs, in which
the mystic letters H.Q. most often appeared; âThis
way to the Y.M.C.A. hutâ; in many humble
windows the startling announcement, âWashing done
here.â British motor-lorries and ambulances crowding
the little
place
and aligned along the avenues.
British faces, British voices, everywhere. The blue
uniform and blue helmet of a French soldier seemed
as incongruous though as welcome as in London.

And the straight endless roads, so French with
their infinite border of poplars, their patient little
stones marking every hundred metres until the tenth
rose into the proud kilometre stone proclaiming the

Â
distance to the next stately town, rang too with the
sound of British voices, and the tramp of British feet,
and the clatter of British transport, and the screech
and whir of cars, revealing as they passed the flash of
red and gold of the British staff. Yet the finely
cultivated land remained to show that it was France;
and the little whitewashed villages; the curÃ©, in
shovel-hat and rusty cassock; the children in blue or
black blouses, who stared as the British troops went
by; the patient, elderly French Territorials in their
old pre-war uniforms, guarding unthreatened culverts
or repairing the roads; the helpful signs set up in
happier days by the Touring Club of France.

Into this strange anomaly of a land came Doggie
with his draft, still half stupefied by the remorselessness
of the stupendous machine in which he had been
caught, in spite of his many months of training in
England. He had loathed the East Coast camp.
When he landed at Boulogne in the dark and the pouring
rain and hunched his pack with the others who
went off singing to the rest camp, he regretted East
Anglia.

âGive us a turn on the whistle, Doggie,â said a
corporal.

âI was sea-sick into it and threw it overboard,â
he growled, stumbling over the rails of the quay.

âOh, you holy young liar!â said the man next
him.

But Doggie did not trouble to reply, his neighbour
being only a private like himself.

Then the draft joined its unit. In his youth Doggie
had often wondered at the meaning of the familiar
inscription on every goods van in France: â40
Hommes. 8 Chevaux.â Now he ceased to wonder.
He was one of the forty menâ¦. At the rail-head

Â
he began to march, and at last joined the remnant
of his battalion. They had been through hard fighting,
and were now in billets. Until he joined them
he had not realized the drain there had been on the
reserves at home. Very many familiar faces of officers
were missing. New men had taken their place. And
very many of his old comrades had gone, some to
Blighty, some West of that Island of Desire; and
those who remained had the eyes of children who
had passed through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

McPhail and Mo Shendish had passed through
unscathed. In the reconstruction of the regiment
chance willed that the three of them found themselves
in the same platoon of A Company. Doggie almost
embraced them when they met.

âLaddie,â said McPhail to him, as he was drinking
a mahogany-coloured liquid that was known by
the name of tea, out of a tin mug, and eating a hunk
of bread and jam, âI donât know whether or not
Iâm pleased to see you. You were safer in England.
Once I misspent many months of my life in shielding
you from the dangers of France. But France
is a much more dangerous place nowadays, and I
canât help you. Youâve come right into the thick
of it. Just listen to the hellâs delight thatâs going
on over yonder.â

The easterly wind brought them the roar streaked
with stridence of the artillery duel in progress on
the nearest sector of the Front.

They were sitting in the cellar entrance to a house
in a little town which had already been somewhat
mauled. Just opposite was a shuttered house on the
ground floor of which had been a hatter and hosierâs
shop, and there still swung bravely on an iron rod
the red brim of what once had been a monstrous red

Â
hat. Next door, the faÃ§ade of the upper stories had
been shelled away and the naked interiors gave the
impression of a pathetic dollâs house. Womenâs
garments still hung on pegs. A cottage piano lurched
forward drunkenly on three legs, with the keyboard
ripped open, the treble notes on the ground, the bass
incongruously in the air. In the attic, ironically
secure, hung a cheap German print of blowsy children
feeding a pig. The wide flagstoned street smelt sour.
At various cavern doors sat groups of the billeted
soldiers. Now and then squads marched up and down,
monotonously clad in khaki and dun-coloured helmets.
Officers, some only recognizable by the Sam Browne
belt, others spruce and point-device, passed by. Here
and there a shop was open, and the elderly proprietor
and his wife stood by the doorway to get the afternoon
air. Women and children straggled rarely through
the streets. The Boche had left the little town alone
for some time; they had other things to do with their
heavy guns; and all the French population, save those
whose homes were reduced to nothingness, had remained.
They took no notice of the distant bombardment.
It had grown to be a phenomenon of
nature like the wind and the rain.

But to Doggie it was newâjust as the sight of the
wrecked house opposite, with its sturdy crownless
hat-brim of a sign, was new. He listened, as McPhail
had bidden him, to the artillery duel with an odd little
spasm of his heart.

âWhat do you think of that, now?â asked McPhail
grandly, as if it was The Greatest Show on Earth
run by him, the Proprietor.

âItâs rather noisy,â said Doggie, with a little
ironical twist of his lips that was growing habitual.
âDo they keep it up at night?â

Â
âThey do.â

âI donât think itâs fair to interfere with oneâs sleep
like that,â said Doggie.

âYouâve got to adapt yourself to it,â said McPhail
sagely. âNo doubt youâll be remembering my theory
of adaptability. Through that Iâve made myself
into a very brave man. When I wanted to run
awayâa very natural desire, considering the scrupulous
attention Iâve always paid to my bodily well-beingâI
reflected on the preposterous obstacles put in the
way of flight by a bowelless military system, and
adapted myself to the static and dynamic conditions
of the trenches.â

âGorblime!â said Mo Shendish, stretched out by
his side, âjust listen to him!â

âI suppose youâll say you sucked honey out of the
shells,â remarked Doggie.

âIâm no great hand at mixing metaphorsâââ

âWhat about drinks?â asked Mo.

âNor drinks either,â replied McPhail. âBoth
are bad for the brain. But as to what you were
saying, laddie, Iâll not deny that Iâve derived considerable
interest and amusement from a bombardment.
Yet it has its sad aspect.â He paused for a moment
or two. âMan,â he continued, âwhat an awful
waste of money!â

âI donât know what old Mac is jawing about,â
said Mo Shendish, âbut you can take it from me heâs
a holy terror with the bayonet. One moment heâs
talking to a Boche through his hat and the next the
Boche is wriggling like a worm on a bent pin.â

Mo winked at Phineas. The temptation to âtell
the taleâ to the new-comer was too strong.

Doggie grew very serious. âYouâve been killing
menâlike that?â

Â
âThousands, laddie,â replied Phineas, the picture
of unboastful veracity. âAnd so has Mo.â

Mo Shendish, helmeted, browned, dried, toughened,
a very different Mo from the pallid ferret whom Aggie
had driven into the ranks of war, hunched himself
up, his hands clasping his knees.

âI donât mind doing it, when youâre so excited you
donât know where you are,â said he, âbut I donât
like thinking of it afterwards.â

As a matter of fact, he had only once got home
with the bayonet and the memory was unpleasant.

âBut youâve just thought of it,â said Phineas.

âIt was you, not me,â said Mo. âThat makes
all the difference.â

âItâs astonishing,â Phineas remarked sententiously,
âhow many people not only refuse to catch pleasure
as it flies, but spurn it when it sits up and begs at them.
Laddie,â he turned to Doggie, âthe more one wallows
in hedonism, the more one realizes its unplumbed
depths.â

A little girl of ten, neatly pigtailed but piteously
shod, came near and cast a childâs envious eye on
Doggieâs bread and jam.

âApproach, my little one,â Phineas cried in French
words but with the accent of Sauchiehall Street. âIf
I gave you a franc, what would you do with it?â

âI should buy nourishment (
de la nourriture
) for

maman
.â

âLend me a franc, laddie,â said McPhail, and
when Doggie had slipped the coin into his palm, he
addressed the child in unintelligible grandiloquence
and sent her on her way mystified but rejoicing.

Ces bons drÃ´les dâAnglais!

âAh, laddie!â cried Phineas, stretching himself
out comfortably by the jamb of the door, âyouâve got

Â
to learn to savour the exquisite pleasure of a genuinely
kindly act.â

âHold on!â cried Mo. âIt was Doggieâs money
you were flinging about.â

McPhail withered him with a glance.

âYouâre an unphilosophical ignoramus,â said he.

Â

CHAPTER XII

Perhaps
one of the greatest influences which
transformed Doggie into a fairly efficient though
undistinguished infantryman was a morbid social
terror of his officers. It saved him from many a
guard-room, and from many a heart-to-heart talk
wherein the zealous lieutenant gets to know his men.
He lived in dread lest military delinquency or civil
accomplishment should be the means of revealing the
disgrace which bit like an acid into his soul. His
undisguisable air of superior breeding could not fail to
attract notice. Often his officers asked him what he
was in civil life. His reply, âA clerk, sir,â had to
satisfy them. He had developed a curious self-protective
faculty of shutting himself up like a hedgehog
at the approach of danger. Once a breezy
subaltern had selected him as his batman; but Doggieâs
agonized, âIt would be awfully good of you, sir,
if you wouldnât mind not thinking of it,â and the
appeal in his eyes, established the freemasonry of
caste and saved him from dreaded intimate relations.

âAll right, if youâd rather not, Trevor,â said the
subaltern. âBut why doesnât a chap like you try
for a commission?â

âIâm much happier as I am, sir,â replied Doggie,
and that was the end of the matter.

But Phineas, when he heard of itâit was on the
East Coastâbegan: âIf you still consider yourself
too fine to clean another manâs bootsâââ

Â
Doggie, in one of his quick fits of anger, interrupted:
âIf you think Iâm just a dirty little snob, if
you donât understand why I begged to be let off,
youâre the thickest-headed fool in creation!â

âIâm nae that, laddie,â replied Phineas, with his
usual ironic submissiveness. âHavenât I kept your
secret all this time?â

Thus it was Doggieâs fixed idea to lose himself in
the locust swarm, to be prominent neither for good
nor evil, even in the little clot of fifty, outwardly,
almost identical locusts that formed his platoon. It
braced him to the performance of hideous tasks; it
restrained him from display of superior intellectual
power or artistic capability. The world upheaval had
thrown him from his peacock and ivory room, with
its finest collection on earth of little china dogs, into
a horrible fetid hole in the ground in Northern France.
It had thrown not the average young Englishman of
comfortable position, who had toyed with Ã¦sthetic
superficialities as an amusement, but a poor little
by-product of cloistered life who had been brought
up from babyhood to regard these things as the nervous
texture of his very existence. He was wrapped from
head to heel in fine net, to every tiny mesh of which
he was acutely sensitive.

A hole in the ground in Northern France. The
regiment, after its rest, moved on and took its turn
in the trenches. Four days on; four days off.
Four days on of misery inconceivable. Four days
on, during which the officers watched the men with
the unwavering vigilance of kindly cats:

âHow are you getting along, Trevor?â

âNicely, thank you, sir.â

âFeet all right?â

âYes, thank you, sir.â

Â
âSure? If you want to grouse, grouse away.
Thatâs what Iâm talking to you for.â

âIâm perfectly happy, sir.â

âDarn sight more than I am!â laughed the
subaltern, and with a cheery nod in acknowledgment
of Doggieâs salute, splashed down the muddy trench.

But Doggie was chilled to the bone, and he had
no feeling in his feet, which were under six inches of
water, and his woollen gloves being wet through were
useless, and prevented his numbed hands from feeling
the sandbags with which he and the rest of the platoon
were repairing the parapet; for the Germans had
just consecrated an hourâs general hate to the vicinity
of the trench, and its exquisite symmetry, the pride of
the platoon commander, had been disturbed. There
had also been a few ghastly casualties. A shell had
fallen and burst in the traverse at the far end of the
trench. Something that looked like half a manâs
head and a bit of shoulder had dropped just in front
of the dug-out where Doggie and his section was
sheltering. Doggie staring at it was violently sick.
In a stupefied way he found himself mingling with
others who were engaged in clearing up the horror.
A murmur reached him that it was Taffy Jones who
had thus been dismemberedâ¦. The bombardment
over, he had taken his place with the rest in
the reparation of the parapet; and as he happened
to be at an end of the line, the officer had spoken to him.
If he had been suffering tortures unknown to Attila,
and unimagined by his successors, he would have
answered just the same.

But he lamented Taffyâs death to Phineas, who
listened sympathetically. Such a cheery comrade,
such a smart soldier, such a kindly soul.

Â
âNot a black spot in him,â said Doggie.

âA year ago, laddie,â said McPhail, âwhat
would have been your opinion of a bookmakerâs
clerk?â

âI know,â replied Doggie. âBut this isnât a
year ago. Just look round.â

He laughed somewhat hysterically, for the fate of
Taffy had unstrung him for the time. Phineas contemplated
the length of deep narrow ditch, with its
planks half swimming on filthy liquid, its wire revetment
holding up the oozing sides, the dingy parapet
above which it was death to put oneâs head, the grey
free sky, the only thing free along that awful row of
parallel ditches that stretched from the Belgian coast
to Switzerland, the clay-covered, shapeless figures of
men, their fellows, almost undistinguishable even by
features from themselves.

âIt has been borne upon me lately,â said Phineas,
âthat patriotism is an amazing virtue.â

Doggie drew a foot out of the mud so as to find a
less precarious purchase higher up the slope.

âAnd Iâve been thinking, Phineas, whether itâs
really patriotism that has brought you and me into
thisâwhat can we call it? Danteâs Inferno is childâs
play to it.â

âDante had no more imagination,â said Phineas,
âthan a Free Kirk precentor in Kirkcudbright.â

âBut is it patriotism?â Doggie persisted. âIf I
thought it was, I should be happier. If we had orders
to go over the top and attack and I could shout âEngland
for ever!â and lose myself just in the thick of
itâââ

âThereâs a brass hat coming down the trench,â
said Phineas, âand brass hats have no use for rhapsodical
privates.â

Â
They stood to attention as the staff officer passed
by. Then Doggie broke in impatiently:

âI wish to goodness you could understand what
Iâm trying to get at.â

A smile illuminated the gaunt, unshaven, mud-caked
face of Phineas McPhail.

âLaddie,â said he, âlet England, as an abstraction,
fend for itself. But youâve a bonny English soul
within you, and for that you are fighting. And so
had poor Taffy Jones. And I have a bonny Scottish
thirst, the poignancy of which both of you have been
happily spared. I will leave you, laddie, to seek in
slumber a surcease from martyrdom.â

Doggie had been out a long time. He had seen
many places, much fighting and endured manifold
miseries. After one of the spells in the trenches,
the worst he had experienced, A Company was
marched into new billets some miles behind the lines,
in the once prosperous village of FrÃ©lus. They had
slouched along dead tired, drooping under their packs,
sodden with mud and sleeplessness, silent, with not
a note of a song among themâbut at the entrance to
the village, quickened by a word or two of exhortation
from officers and sergeants, they pulled themselves
together and marched in, heads up, forward, in faultless
step. The C.O. was jealous of the honour of
his men. He assumed that his predecessors in the
village had been a ârotten lot,â and was determined
to show the inhabitants of FrÃ©lus what a crack English
regiment was really like. FrÃ©lus was an unimportant,
unheard-of village; but the opinion of a thousand
FrÃ©luses made up Franceâs opinion of the British
Army. Doggie, although half stupefied with fatigue,
responded to the sentiment, like the rest. He was

Â
conscious of making part of a gallant show. It was
only when they halted and stood easy that he lost
count of things. The wide main street of the village
swam characterless before his eyes. He followed, not
directions, but directed men, with a sheep-like instinct,
and found himself stumbling through an archway down
a narrow path. He had a dim consciousness of lurching
sideways and confusedly apologizing to a woman
who supported him back to equilibrium. Then the
next thing he saw was a barn full of fresh straw, and
when somebody pointed to a vacant strip, he fell down,
with many others, and went to sleep.

The rÃ©veillÃ© sounded a minute afterwards, though
a whole night had passed; and there was the blessed
clean water to wash inâhe had long since ceased to
be fastidious in his ablutionsâand there was breakfast,
sizzling bacon and bread and jam. And there
in front of the kitchen, aiding with the hot water
for the tea, moved a slim girl, with dark, and as Doggie
thought, tragic eyes.

Kit inspection, feet inspection, all the duties of the
day and dinner were over. Most of the men returned
to their billets to sleep. Some, including Doggie,
wandered about the village, taking the air, and
visiting the little modest cafÃ©s and talking with indifferent
success, so far as the interchange of articulate
ideas was concerned, with shy children. McPhail
and Mo Shendish being among the sleepers, Doggie
mooned about by himself in his usual self-effacing
way. There was little to interest him in the long
straggling village. He had passed through a hundred
such. Low whitewashed houses, interspersed with
perky balconied buildings given over to little shops
on the ground floor, with here and there a discreet

Â
iron gate shutting off the doctorâs or the attorneyâs
villa, and bearing the oval plate indicating the name
and pursuit of the tenant; here and there, too, long
whitewashed walls enclosing a dairy or a timber-yard
stretched on each side of the great high road,
and the village gradually dwindled away at each end
into the gently undulating country. There were just
a by-lane or two, one leading up to the little grey
church and presbytery and another to the little cemetery
with its trim paths and black and white wooden
crosses and wirework pious offerings. At open doors
the British soldiers lounged at ease, and in the dim
interiors behind them the forms of the women of
the house, blue-aproned, moved to and fro. The
early afternoon was warm, a westerly breeze deadened
the sound of the distant bombardment to an unheeded
drone, and a holy peace settled over the place.

Doggie, clean, refreshed, comfortably drowsy,
having explored the village, returned to his billet,
and looking at it from the opposite side of the way,
for the first time realized its nature. The lane,
into which he had stumbled the night before, ran
under an archway supporting some kind of overhead
chamber, and separated the dwelling-house from a
warehouse wall on which vast letters proclaimed the
fact that Veuve Morin et Fils carried on therein the
business of hay and corn dealers. Hence, Doggie
reflected, the fresh, deep straw on which he and his
fortunate comrades had wallowed. The double gate
under the archway was held back by iron stanchions.
The two-storied house looked fairly large and comfortable.
The front door stood wide open, giving
the view of a neat, stiff little hall or living-room.
An article of furniture caught his idle eye. He
crossed the road in order to have a nearer view. It

Â
was a huge polished mahogany cask standing about
three feet high and bound with shining brass bands,
such as he remembered having seen once in Brittany.
He advanced still closer, and suddenly the slim, dark
girl appeared and stood in the doorway, and looked
frankly and somewhat rebukingly into his inquisitive
eyes. Doggie flushed as one caught in an unmannerly
act. A crying fault of the British Army is that it
prescribes for the rank and file no form of polite
recognition of the existence of civilians. It is contrary
to Army Orders to salute or to take off their caps.
They can only jerk their heads and grin, an inelegant
proceeding, which places them at a disadvantage with
the fair sex. Doggie, therefore, sketched a vague
salutation half-way between a salute and a bow, and
began a profuse apology. Mademoiselle must pardon
his curiosity, but as a lover of old things he had been
struck by the beautiful
tonneau
.

An amused light came into her sombre eyes and
a smile flickered round her lips. Doggie noted instantly
how pale she was, and how tiny, faint little lines
persisted at the corners of those lips in spite of the smile.

âThere is no reason for excuses, monsieur,â she
said. âThe door was open to the view of everybody.â

â
Pourtant
,â said Doggie, â
câÃ©tait un peu mal Ã©levÃ©
.â

She laughed. âPardon. But itâs droll. First to
find an English soldier apologizing for looking into
a house, and then to find him talking French like a

poilu
.â

Doggie said, with a little touch of national jealousy
and a reversion to Durdlebury punctilio: âI hope,
mademoiselle, you have always found the English
soldier conduct himself like a gentleman.â

â
Mais oui, mais oui!
â she cried, âthey are all
charming.
Ils sont doux comme des moutons.
But

Â
this is a question of delicacyâsomewhat exaggerated.â

âItâs good of you, mademoiselle, to forgive me,â
said Doggie.

By all the rules of polite intercourse, either Doggie
should have made his bow and exit, or the maiden,
exercising her prerogative, should have given him
the opportunity of a graceful withdrawal. But they
remained where they were, the girl framed by the
doorway, the lithe little figure in khaki and lichen-coloured
helmet looking up at her from the foot of
the two front steps.

At last he said in some embarrassment: âThatâs
a very beautiful cask of yours.â

She wavered for a few seconds. Then she said:

âYou can enter, monsieur, and examine it, if you
like.â

Mademoiselle was very amiable, said Doggie.
Mademoiselle moved aside and Doggie entered, taking
off his helmet and holding it under his arm like
an opera-hat. There was nothing much to see in
the little vestibule-parlour: a stiff tasselled chair or
two, a great old linen-press taking up most of one side
of a wall, a cheap table covered with a chenille tablecloth,
and the resplendent old cask, about which he
lingered. He mentioned Brittany. Her tragic face
lighted up again. Monsieur was right. Her aunt,
Madame Morin, was Breton, and had brought the cask
with her as part of her dowry, together with the press
and other furniture. Doggie alluded to the vastly
lettered inscription, âVeuve Morin et Fils.â Madame
Morin was, in a sense, his hostess. And the sons?

âOne is in Madagascar, and the otherâalas,
monsieur!â

And Doggie knew what that âalas!â meant.

âThe Argonne,â she said.

Â
âAnd madame your aunt?â

She shrugged her thin though shapely shoulders.
âIt nearly killed her. She is old and an invalid.
She has been in bed for the last three weeks.â

âThen what becomes of the business?â

âIt is I, monsieur, who am the business. And I
know nothing about it.â She sighed. Then with
her blue apronâotherwise she was dressed in unrelieved
blackâshe rubbed an imaginary speck from
the brass banding of the cask. âThis, I suppose
you know, was for the best brandy, monsieur.â

âAnd now?â he asked.

âA memory. A sentiment. A thing of beauty.â

In a feminine way, which he understood, she
herded him to the door, by way of dismissal. Durdlebury
helped him. A tiny French village has as many
slanderous tongues as an English cathedral city. He
was preparing to take polite leave, when she looked
swiftly at him and made the faintest gesture of a
detaining hand.

âNow I remember. It was you who nearly fell
into me last night, when you were entering through
the gate.â

The dim recollection came backâthe firm womanâs
arm round him for the few tottering seconds.

âIt seems I am always bound to be impolite, for
I donât think I thanked you,â smiled Doggie.

âYou were at the end of your tether.â Then
very gently, â
Pauvre garÃ§on!
â

âThe
sales Boches
had kept us awake for four
nights,â said Doggie. âThat was why.â

âAnd you are rested now?â

He laughed. âAlmost.â

They were at the door. He looked out and drew
back. A knot of men were gathered by the gate

Â
of the yard. Apparently she had seen them too, for
a flush rose to her pale cheeks.

âMademoiselle,â said Doggie, âI should like to
creep back to the barn and sleep. If I pass my comrades
theyâll want to detain me.â

âThat would be a pity,â she said demurely.
âCome this way, monsieur.â

She led him through a room and a passage to the
kitchen. They shared a pleasurable sense of adventure
and secrecy. At the kitchen door she paused and
spoke to an old woman chopping up vegetables.

âToinette, let monsieur pass.â To Doggie she
said: âAu revoir, monsieur!â and disappeared.

The old woman looked at him at first with disfavour.
She did not hold with Tommies needlessly
tramping over the clean flags of her kitchen. But
Doggieâs polite apology for disturbing her and a youthful
grace of mannerâhe still held his tin hat under
his armâcaused her features to relax.

âYou are English?â

With a smile, he indicated his uniform. âWhy,
yes, madame.â

âHow comes it, then, that you speak French?â

âBecause I have always loved your beautiful
France, madame.â

âFranceâ
ah! la pauvre France
!â She sighed,
drew a wisp of what had been a cornet of snuff from
her pocket, opened it, dipped in a tentative finger
and thumb and, finding it empty, gazed at it with
disappointment, sighed again and, with the methodical
hopelessness of age, folded it up into the neatest of
little squares and thrust it back in her pocket. Then
she went on with her vegetables.

Doggie took his leave and emerged into the yard.

He dozed pleasantly on the straw of the barn, but

Â
it was not the dead sleep of the night. Bits of his
recent little adventure fitted into the semi-conscious
intervals. He heard the girlâs voice saying so gently:
â
Pauvre garÃ§on!
â and it was very comforting.

He was finally aroused by Phineas and Mo Shendish,
who, having slept like tired dogs some distance off
down the barn, now desired his company for a stroll
round the village. Doggie good-naturedly assented.
As they passed the house door he cast a quick glance.
It was open, but the slim figure in black with the blue
apron was not visible within. The shining cask, however,
seemed to smile a friendly greeting.

âIf you believed the London papers,â said Phineas,
âyouâd think that the war-worn soldier coming from
the trenches is met behind the lines with luxurious
Turkish baths, comfortable warm canteens, picture
palaces and theatrical entertainments. Can you perceive
here any of those amenities of modern warfare?â

They looked around them, and admitted they
could not.

âApparently,â said Phineas, âthe Colonel, good but
limited man, has missed all the proper places and dumps
us in localities unrecognized by the London Press.â

âPut me on the pier at Brighton,â sang Mo
Shendish. âBut Iâd sooner have Margit or Yarmouth
any day. Brightonâs too toffish for whelks.
My! and cockles! I wonder whether we shall ever
eat âem again.â A far-away, dreamy look crept into
his eyes.

âDoes your young lady like cockles?â Doggie
asked sympathetically.

âAggie? Funny thing, I was just thinking of
her. She fair dotes on âem. We had a day at Southend
just before the warâââ

He launched into anecdote. His companions

Â
listened, Phineas ironically carrying out his theory of
adaptability, Doggie with finer instinct. It appeared
there had been an altercation over right of choice
with an itinerant vendor in which, to Aggieâs admiration,
Mo had come off triumphant.

âYou see,â he explained, âbeing in the fish trade
myself, I could spot the winners.â

James Marmaduke Trevor, of Denby Hall, laughed
and slapped him on the back, and said indulgently:
âGood old Mo!â

At the little school-house they stopped to gossip
with some of their friends who were billeted there,
and they sang the praises of the Veuve Morinâs barn.

âI wonder you donât have the house full of orficers,
if itâs so wonderful,â said some one.

An omniscient corporal in the confidence of the
quartermaster explained that the landlady being ill in
bed, and the place run by a young girl, the house
had been purposely missed. Doggie drew a breath of
relief at the news and attributed Madame Morinâs
malady to the intervention of a kindly providence.
Somehow he did not fancy officers having the run of
the house.

They strolled on and came to a forlorn little
DÃ©bit
de Tabac
, showing in its small window some clay
pipes and a few fly-blown picture post-cards. Now
Doggie, in spite of his training in adversity, had never
resigned himself to âWoodbines,â and other such
brands supplied to the British Army, and Egyptian
and Turkish being beyond his social pale, he had taken
to smoking French RÃ©gie tobacco, of which he laid
in a stock whenever he had the chance. So now he
entered the shop, leaving Phineas and Mo outside.
As they looked on French cigarettes with sturdy
British contempt, they were not interested in Doggieâs

Â
purchases. A wan girl of thirteen rose from behind
the counter.

â
Vous dÃ©sirez, monsieur?
â

Doggie stated his desire. The girl was calculating
the price of the packets before wrapping them up,
when his eyes fell upon a neat little pile of cornets
in a pigeon-hole at the back. They directly suggested
to him one of the great luminous ideas of his life.
It was only afterwards that he realized its effulgence.
For the moment he was merely concerned with the
needs of a poor old woman who had sighed lamentably
over an empty paper of comfort.

âDo you sell snuff?â

âBut yes, monsieur.â

âGive me some of the best quality.â

âHow much does monsieur desire?â

âA lot,â said Doggie.

And he bought a great package, enough to set the
whole village sneezing to the end of the war, and peering
round the tiny shop and espying in the recesses
of a glass case a little olive-wood box ornamented
on the top with pansies and forget-me-nots, purchased
that also. He had just paid when his companions put
their heads in the doorway. Mo, pointing waggishly
to Doggie, warned the little girl against his depravity.

âMauvy, mauvy!â said he.

â
Quâest-ce quâil dit?
â asked the child.

âHeâs the idiot of the regiment, whom I have to
look after and feed with pap,â said Doggie, âand,
being hungry, he is begging you not to detain me.â

â
Mon Dieu!
â cried the child.

Doggie, always courteous, went out with a â
Bon
soir, mademoiselle
,â and joined his friends.

âWhat were you jabbering to her about?â Mo
asked suspiciously.

Â
Doggie gave him the literal translation of his speech.
Phineas burst into loud laughter.

âLaddie,â said he, âIâve never heard you make
a joke before. The idiot of the regiment, and youâre
his keeper! Man, thatâs fine. What has come over
you to-day?â

âIf heâd said a thing like that in Mare Street,
Hackney, Iâd have knocked his blinking âead orf,â
declared Mo Shendish.

Doggie stopped and put his parcel-filled hands
behind his back.

âHave a try now, Mo.â

But Mo bade him fry his ugly face, and thus established
harmony.

It was late that evening before Doggie could find
an opportunity of slipping, unobserved, through the
open door into the house kitchen dimly illuminated
by an oil lamp.

âMadame,â said he to Toinette, âI observed to-day
that you had come to the end of your snuff. Will
you permit a little English soldier to give you some?
Also a little box to keep it in.â

The old woman, spare, myriad-wrinkled beneath
her peasantâs
coiffe
, yet looking as if carved out of
weather-beaten oak, glanced from the gift to the
donor and from the donor to the gift.

âBut, monsieurâmonsieurâwhy?â she began
quaveringly.

âYou surely have some oneâ
lÃ Â bas
âover yonder?â
said Doggie with a sweep of his hand.

â
Mais oui?
How did you know? My grandson.

Mon petiot
âââ

âIt is he, my comrade, who sends the snuff to
the
grandâmÃ©re
.â And Doggie bolted.

Â

CHAPTER XIII

At
breakfast next morning Doggie searched the
courtyard in vain for the slim figure of the
girl. Yesterday she had stood just outside the kitchen
door. To-day her office was usurped by a hefty
cook with the sleeves of his grey shirt rolled up and
his collar open and vast and tight-hitched braces
unromantically strapped all over him. Doggie
felt a pang of disappointment and abused the tea.
Mo Shendish stared, and asked what was wrong
with it.

âRotten,â said Doggie.

âYou canât expect yer slap-up City A.B.C. shops
in France,â said Mo.

Doggie, who was beginning to acquire a sense of
rueful humour, smiled and was appeased.

It was only in the afternoon that he saw the girl
again. She was standing in the doorway of the house,
with her hand on her bosom, as though she had just
come out to breathe fresh air, when Doggie and his
two friends emerged from the yard. As their eyes
met, she greeted him with her sad little smile. Emboldened,
he stepped forward.

â
Bon jour, mademoiselle.
â

â
Bon jour, monsieur.
â

âI hope madame your aunt is better to-day.â

She seemed to derive some dry amusement from
his solicitude.

âAlas, no, monsieur.â

Â
âWas that why I had not the pleasure of seeing
you this morning?â

âWhere?â

âYesterday you filled our tea-kettles.â

âBut, monsieur,â she replied primly, âI am not
the
vivandiÃ¨re
of the regiment.â

âThatâs a pity,â laughed Doggie.

Then he became aware of the adjacent forms and
staring eyes of Phineas and Mo, who for the first
time in their military career beheld him on easy terms
with a strange and prepossessing young woman. After
a secondâs thought he came to a diplomatic decision.

âMademoiselle,â said he, in his best Durdlebury
manner, âmay I dare to present my two comrades,
my best friends in the battalion, Monsieur McPhail,
Monsieur Shendish?â

She made them each a little formal bow, and then,
somewhat maliciously, addressing McPhail, as the
bigger and the elder of the two:

âI donât yet know the name of your friend.â

Phineas put his great hand on Doggieâs shoulder.

âJames Marmaduke Trevor.â

âOtherwise called Doggie, miss,â said Mo.

She made a little graceful gesture of non-comprehension.

â
Non compree?
â asked Mo.

âNo, monsieur.â

Phineas explained, in his rasping and consciously
translated French:

âIt is a nickname of the regiment. Doggie.â

The flushed and embarrassed subject of the discussion
saw her lips move silently to the word.

âBut his name is Trevor. Monsieur Trevor,â
said Phineas.

She smiled again. And the strange thing about

Â
her smile was that it was a matter of her lips and rarely
of her eyes, which always maintained the haunting
sadness of their tragic depths.

âMonsieur Trevor,â she repeated imitatively.
âAnd yours, monsieur?â

âMcPhail.â

âMac-FÃªle;
câest assez difficile
. And yours?â

Mo guessed. âShendish,â said he.

She repeated that also, whereat Mo grinned fatuously,
showing his little yellow teeth beneath his scrubby
red moustache.

âMy friends call me Mo,â said he.

She grasped his meaning. âMo,â she said; and
she said it so funnily and softly, and with ever so
little a touch of quizzicality, that the sentimental
warrior roared with delight.

âYouâve got it right fust time, miss.â

From her two stepsâ height of vantage, she looked
down on the three upturned British facesâand her
eyes went calmly from one to the other.

She turned to Doggie. âOne would say, monsieur,
that you were the Three Musketeers.â

âPossibly, mademoiselle,â laughed Doggie. He
had not felt so light-hearted for many months. âBut
we lack a dâArtagnan.â

âWhen you find him, bring him to me,â said the
girl.

âMademoiselle,â said Phineas gallantly, âwe
would not be such imbeciles.â

At that moment the voice of Toinette came from
within.

âMaâamselle Jeanne!  Maâamselle Jeanne!â

â
Oui, oui, jây viens
,â she cried. â
Bon soir, messieurs
,â
and she was gone.

Doggie looked into the empty vestibule and smiled

Â
at the friendly brandy cask. Provided it is pronounced
correctly, so as to rhyme with the English âAnne,â
it is a very pretty name. Doggie thought she
looked like Jeanneâa Jeanne dâArc of this modern
war.

âYonâs a very fascinating lassie,â Phineas remarked
soberly, as they started on their stroll. âDid you
happen to observe that all the time she was talking so
prettily she was looking at ghosts behind us?â

âDo you think so?â asked Doggie, startled.

âMan, I know it,â replied Phineas.

âGhosts be blowed!â cried Mo Shendish. âSheâs
a bit of orl right, she is. What I call class. Doesnât
chuck âerself at yer âead, like some of âem, and, on
the other âand, has none of yer blooming stand-orfishness.
See what I mean?â He clutched them
each by an armâhe was between them. âLook
âere. How do you think I could pick up this blinking
lingoâquick?â

âMake violent love to Toinette and ask her to
teach you. Thereâs nothing like it,â said Doggie.

âWhoâs Toinette?â

âThe nice old lady in the kitchen.â

Mo flung his arm away. âOh, go and boil
yourself!â said he.

But the making of love to the old woman in the
kitchen led to possibilities of which Mo Shendish
never dreamed. They never dawned on Doggie
until he found himself at it that evening.

It was dusk. The men were lounging and smoking
about the courtyard. Doggie, who had long since
exchanged poor Taffy Jonesâs imperfect penny whistle
for a scientific musical instrument ordered from
Bond Street, was playing, with his sensitive skill, the

Â
airs they loved. He had just finished âAnnie LaurieâââMan,â
Phineas used to declare, âwhen Doggie
Trevor plays âAnnie Laurie,â he has the power to
take your heart by the strings and drag it out through
your eyesââhe had just come to the end of this
popular and gizzard-piercing tune and received his
meed of applause, when Toinette came out of the
kitchen, two great zinc crocks in her hands, and
crossed to the pump in the corner of the yard. Three
or four would-be pumpers, among them Doggie, went
to her aid.

âAll right, mother, weâll see to it,â said one of
them.

So they pumped and filled the crocks, and one
man got hold of one and Doggie got hold of another,
and they carried them to the kitchen steps.

â
Merci, monsieur
,â said Toinette to the first; and
he went away with a friendly nod. But to Doggie
she said, â
Entrez, monsieur
.â And monsieur carried
the two crocks over the threshold and Toinette shut
the door behind him. And there, sitting over some
needlework in a corner of the kitchen by a lamp, sat
Jeanne.

She looked up rather startled, frowned for the
brief part of a second, and regarded him inquiringly.

âI brought in monsieur to show him the photograph
of
mon petiot
, the comrade who sent me the snuff,â
explained Toinette, rummaging in a cupboard.

âMay I stay and look at it?â asked Doggie,
buttoning up his tunic.

â
Mais parfaitement, monsieur
,â said Jeanne. âIt
is Toinetteâs kitchen.â

â
Bien sÃ»r
,â said the old woman, turning with the
photograph, that of a solid young infantryman. Doggie
made polite remarks. Toinette put on a pair of

Â
silver-rimmed spectacles and scanned the picture.
Then she handed it to Jeanne.

âDonât you think there is a great deal of resemblance?â

Jeanne directed a comparing glance at Doggie
and smiled.

âLike two little soldiers in a pod,â she said.

Toinette talked of her
petiot
who was at St. Mihiel.
It was far away, very far. She sighed as though he
were fighting remote in the Caucasus.

Presently came the sharp ring of a bell. Jeanne
put aside her work and rose.

âIt is my aunt who has awakened.â

But Toinette was already at the door. âI will go
up, Maâamselle Jeanne. Do not derange yourself.â

She bustled away. Once more the pair found
themselves alone together.

âIf you donât continue your sewing, mademoiselle,â
said Doggie, âI shall think that I am disturbing you,
and must bid you good night.â

Jeanne sat down and resumed her work. A
sensation, more like laughter than anything else,
fluttered round Doggieâs heart.

â
Voulez-vous vous asseoir, MonsieurâTrevor?
â

â
Vous Ãªtes bien aimable, Mademoiselle Jeanne
,â
said Doggie, sitting down on a straight-backed chair
by the oilcloth-covered kitchen table which was
between them.

âMay I move the lamp slightly?â he asked,
for it hid her from his view.

He moved it somewhat to her left. It threw
shadows over her features, accentuating their appealing
sadness. He watched her, and thought of McPhailâs
words about the ghosts. He noted too, as the needle
went in and out of the fabric, that her hands, though

Â
roughened by coarse work, were finely made, with
long fingers and delicate wrists. He broke a silence
that grew embarrassing.

âYou seem to have suffered greatly, Mademoiselle
Jeanne,â he said softly.

Her lips quivered. â
Mais oui, monsieur.
â

âMonsieur Trevor,â he said.

She put her hands and needlework in her lap and
looked at him full.

âAnd you too have suffered?â

âI? Oh no.â

âBut, yes. I have seen too much of it not to know.
I see in the eyes. Your two comrades to-dayâthey
are good fellowsâbut they have not suffered.
You are different.â

âNot a bit,â he declared. âWeâre just little
indistinguishable bits of the conglomerate Tommy.â

âAnd I, monsieur, have the honour to say that you
are different.â

This was very flattering. Moreâit was sweet
unction, grateful to many a bruise.

âHow?â said he.

âYou do not belong to their world. Your Tommies
are wonderful in their kindness and chivalryâuntil
I met them I had never seen an Englishman in
my lifeâI had imbecile ideasâI thought they would
be without mannersâ
un peu insultants
. I found I
could walk among them, without fear, as if I were a
princess. It is true.â

âIt is because you have the air of a princess,â
said Doggie; âa sad little disguised princess of a
fairy-tale, who is recognized by all the wild boars
and rabbits in the wood.â

She glanced aside. âThere isnât a woman in
FrÃ©lus who is differently treated. I am only an

Â
ignorant girl, half bourgeoise, half peasant, monsieur,
but I have my womanâs knowledgeâand I know
there is a difference between you and the others.
You are a son of good family. It is evident. You
have a delicacy of mind and of feeling. You were
not born to be a soldier.â

âMademoiselle Jeanne,â cried Doggie, âdo I
appear as bad as that? Do you take me for an

embusquÃ© manquÃ©
?â

Now an
embusquÃ©
is a slacker who lies in the safe
ambush of a soft job. And an
embusquÃ© manquÃ©
is a
slacker who fortuitously has failed to win the fungus
wreath of slackerdom.

She flushed deep red.

â
Je ne suis pas malhonnÃªte, monsieur.
â

Doggie spread himself elbow-wise over the table.
The girlâs visible register of moods was fascinating.

âPardon, Mademoiselle Jeanne. You are quite
right. But itâs not a question of what I was born
to beâbut what I was trained to be. I wasnât
trained to be a soldier. But I do my best.â

She looked at him waveringly.

âForgive me, mademoiselle.â

âBut you flash out on the point of honour.â

Doggie laughed. âWhich shows that I have the
essential of the soldier.â

Doggieâs manner was not without charm. She
relented.

âYou know very well what I mean,â she said
rebukingly. âAnd you donât deserve that I should
tell it to you. It was my intention to say that you
have sacrificed many things to make yourself a simple
soldier.â

âOnly a few idle habits,â said Doggie.

âYou joined, like the rest, as a volunteer.â

Â
âOf course.â

âYou abandoned everything to fight for your
country?â

Under the spell of her dark eyes Doggie spoke
according to Phineas after the going West of Taffy
Jones, âI think, Mademoiselle Jeanne, it was rather
to fight for my soul.â

She resumed her sewing. âThatâs what I meant
long ago,â she remarked with the first draw of the
needle. âNo one could fight for his soul without
passing through suffering.â She went on sewing.
Doggie, shrinking from a reply that might have sounded
fatuous, remained silent; but he realized a wonderful
faculty of comprehension in Jeanne.

After awhile he said: âWhere did you learn all
your wisdom, Mademoiselle Jeanne?â

âAt the convent, I suppose. My father gave me
a good education.â

âAn English poet has said, âKnowledge comes,
but Wisdom lingersâââDoggie had rather a fight to
express the meaning exactly in FrenchââYou donât
gather wisdom in convents.â

âIt is true. Since then I have seen many things.â

She stared across the room, not at Doggie, and he
thought again of the ghosts.

âTell me some of them, Mademoiselle Jeanne,â
he said in a low voice.

She shot a swift glance at him and met his honest
brown eyes.

âI saw my father murdered in front of me,â she said
in a harsh voice.

âMy God!â said Doggie.

âIt was on the Retreat. We lived in Cambrai,
my father and mother and I. He was a lawyer.
When we heard the Germans were coming, my

Â
father, somewhat of an invalid, decided to fly. He
had heard of what they had already done in Belgium.
We tried to go by train.
Pas moyen.
We took to
the road, with many others. We could not get a
horseâwe had postponed our flight till too late.
Only a handcart, with a few necessaries and precious
things. And we walked until we nearly died of
heat and dust and grief. For our hearts were very
heavy, monsieur. The roads, too, were full of the
English in retreat. I shall not tell you what I saw
of the wounded by the roadside. I sometimes see
them now in my dreams. And we were helpless.
We thought we would leave the main roads, and at
last we got lost and found ourselves in a little wood.
We sat down to rest and to eat. It was cool and
pleasant, and I laughed, to cheer my parents, for they
knew how I loved to eat under the freshness of the
trees.â She shivered. âI hope I shall never have to
eat a meal in a wood again. We had scarcely begun
when a body of cavalry, with strange pointed helmets,
rode along the path and, seeing us, halted. My
mother, half dead with terror, cried out, â
Mon Dieu,
ce sont des Uhlans!
â The leader, I suppose an officer,
called out something in German. My father replied.
I do not understand German, so I did not know and
shall never know what they said. But my father
protested in anger and stood in front of the horse
making gestures. And then the officer took out his
revolver and shot him through the heart, and he fell
dead. And the murderer turned his horseâs head
round and he laughed. He laughed, monsieur.â

âDamn him!â said Doggie, in English. âDamn
him!â

He gazed deep into Jeanneâs dark tearless eyes.
She continued in the same even voice:

Â
âMy mother became mad. She was a peasant, a
Bretonne, where the blood is fierce, and she screamed
and clung to the bridle of the horse. And he rode
her down and the horse trampled on her. Then he
pointed at me, who was supporting the body of my
father, and three men dismounted. But suddenly
he heard something, gave an order, and the men
mounted again, and they all rode away laughing and
jeering, and the last man, in bad French, shouted at
me a foul insult. And I was there, Monsieur Trevor,
with my father dead and my mother stunned and
bruised and bleeding.â

Doggie, sensitive, quivered to the girlâs tragedy:
he said, with tense face:

âGod give me strength to kill every German I
see!â

She nodded slowly. âNo German is a human
being. If I were God, I would exterminate the
accursed race like wolves.â

âYou are right,â said Doggie. A short silence
fell. He asked: âWhat happened then?â

â
Mon Dieu
, I almost forget. I was overwhelmed
with grief and horror. Some hours afterwards a
small body of English infantry cameâmany of them
had bloodstained bandages. An officer who spoke
a little French questioned me. I told him what had
happened. He spoke with another officer, and
because I recognized the word âUhlans,â I knew they
were anxious about the patrol. They asked me the
way to some placeâI forget where. But I was
lost. They looked at a map. Meanwhile my
mother had recovered consciousness. I gave her a
little wine from the bottle we had opened for our
repast. I happened to look at the officer and saw
him pass his tongue over his cracked lips. All the

Â
men had thrown themselves down by the side of the
road. I handed him the bottle and the little tin
cup. To my surprise, he did not drink. He said:
âMademoiselle, this is war, and we are all in very
great peril. My men are dying of thirst, and if you
have any more of the wine, give it to them and they
will do their utmost to conduct your mother and yourself
to a place of safety.â Alas! there were only
three bottles in our little basket of provisions. Naturally
I gave it allâtogether with the food. He called
a sergeant, who took the provisions and distributed
them, while I was tending my mother. But I noticed
that the two officers took neither bite nor sup. It was
only afterwards, Monsieur Trevor, that I realized I
had seen your great English gentlemenâ¦. Then
they dug a little grave, for my fatherâ¦. It was
soon finished â¦ the danger was grave â¦ and
some soldiers took a rope and pulled the handcart,
with my mother lying on top of our little possessions,
and I walked with them, until the whole of my life
was blotted out with fatigue. We got on to the
Route Nationale again and mingled again with the
Retreat. And in the night, as we were still marching,
there was a halt. I went to my mother. She was
cold, monsieur, cold and stiff. She was dead.â

She paused tragically. After a few moments she
continued:

âI fainted. I do not know what happened till
I recovered consciousness at dawn. I found myself
wrapped in one of our blankets, lying under the
handcart. It was the market-square of a little town.
And there were manyâold men and women and
children, refugees like me. I rose and found a paperâa
leaf torn from a notebookâfixed to the handcart.
It was from the officer, bidding me farewell. Military

Â
necessity forced him to go on with his menâbut
he had kept his word, and brought me to a place of
safetyâ¦. That is how I first met the English,
Monsieur Trevor. They had carried me, I suppose,
on the handcart, all night, they who were broken
with weariness. I owe them my life and my reason.â

âAnd your mother?â

âHow should I know?
Elle est restÃ©e lÃ -bas
,â
she replied simply.

She went on with her sewing. Doggie wondered
how her hand could be so steady. There was a
long silence. What words, save vain imprecations
on the accursed race, were adequate? Presently her
glance rested for a second or two on his sensitive face.

âWhy do you not smoke, Monsieur Trevor?â

âMay I?â

âOf course. It calms the nerves. I ought not
to have saddened you with my griefs.â

Doggie took out his pink packet and lit a cigarette.

âYou are very understanding, Mademoiselle
Jeanne. But it does a selfish man like me good to
be saddened by a story like yours. I have not had
much opportunity in my life of feeling for anotherâs
suffering. And since the warâI am
abruti
.â

âYou? Do you think if I had not found you
just the reverse, I should have told you all this?â

âYou have paid me a great compliment, Mademoiselle
Jeanne.â Then, after awhile, he asked,
âFrom the market-square of the little town you found
means to come here?â

âAlas, no!â she said, putting her work in her
lap again. âI made my way, with my handcartâit
was easyâto our original destination, a little farm
belonging to the eldest brother of my father. The
Farm of La Folette. He lived there alone, a widower,

Â
with his farm-servants. He had no children. We
thought we were safe. Alas! news came that the
Germans were always advancing. We had time to
fly. All the farm-hands fled, except PÃ¨re Grigou,
who loved him. But my uncle was obstinate. To
a Frenchman, the soil he possesses is his flesh and his
blood. He would die rather than leave it. And my
uncle had the murder of my father and mother on his
brain. He told PÃ¨re Grigou to take me away, but
I stayed with him. It was PÃ¨re Grigou who forced
us to hide. That lasted two days. There was a
well in the farm, and one night PÃ¨re Grigou tied up
my money and my motherâs jewellery and my fatherâs
papers,
enfin
, all the precious things we had, in a packet
of waterproof and sank it with a long string down the
well, so that the Germans could not find it. It was
foolish, but he insisted. One day my uncle and
PÃ¨re Grigou went out of the little copse where we
had been hiding, in order to reconnoitre, for he thought
the Germans might be going away; and my uncle,
who would not listen to me, took his gun. Presently
I heard a shotâand then another. You can guess
what it meant. And soon PÃ¨re Grigou came, white
and shaking with terror. â
Il en a tuÃ© un, et on lâa
tuÃ©!
ââ

âMy God!â said Doggie again.

âIt was terrible,â she said. âBut they were in
their right.â

âAnd then?â

âWe lay hidden until it was darkâhow they did
not find us I donât knowâand then we escaped across
country. I thought of coming here to my Aunt
Morin, which is not far from La Folette, but I reflected
that soon the Boches would be here also. And we
went on. We got to a high roadâand once more

Â
I was among troops and refugees. I met some kind
folks in a carriage, a Monsieur and Madame Tarride,
and they took me in. And so I got to Paris, where I
had the hospitality of a friend of the Convent who was
married.â

âAnd PÃ¨re Grigou?â

âHe insisted on going back to bury my uncle.
Nothing could move him. He had not parted from
him all his life. They were foster-brothers. Where
he is now, who knows?â She paused, looked again
at her ghosts, and continued: âThat is all, Monsieur
Trevor. The Germans passed through here and
repassed on their retreat, and, as soon as it was safe, I
came to help my aunt, who was
souffrante
, and had lost
her son. Also because I could not live on charity
on my friend, for,
voyez-vous
, I was without a souâall
my money having been hidden in the well by
PÃ¨re Grigou.â

Doggie leant his elbows on the table.

âAnd you have come through all that, Mademoiselle
Jeanne, just as you areââ?â

âHow, just as I am?â

âSo gentle and kind and comprehending?â

Her cheek flushed. âI am not the only Frenchwoman
who has passed through such things and kept
herself proud. But the struggle has been very hard.â

Doggie rose and clenched his fists and rubbed his
head from front to back in his old indecisive way, and
began to swear incoherently in English. She smiled
sadly.

â
Ah, mon pauvre ami!
â

He wheeled round: âWhy do you call me â
mon
pauvre ami
â?â

âBecause I see that you would like to help me and
you canât.â

Â
âJeanne,â cried Doggie, bending half over the
table which was between them.

She rose too, startled, on quick defensive. He said,
in reply to her glance:

âWhy shouldnât I call you Jeanne?â

âYou havenât the right.â

âWhat if I gain it?â

âHow?â

âI donât know,â said Doggie.

The door burst suddenly open and the anxious face
of Mo Shendish appeared.

ââEre, you silly cuckoo, donât yer know youâre
on guard to-night? Youâve just got about thirty
seconds.â

âGood lord!â cried Doggie, âI forgot.
Bon
soir, mademoiselle. Service militaire
,â and he rushed
out.

Mo lingered, with a grin, and jerked a backward
thumb.

âIf it werenât for old Mo, miss, I donât know
what would happen to our friend Doggie. I got to
look after him like a baby, I âave. Heâs on to relieve
guard, and if old Macâthatâs McPhailââshe nodded
recognition of the nameââand I hadnât remembered,
miss, heâd âave been in what yer might call a âole.
Compree?â

â
Oui.
Yes,â she said. â
Garde. Sentinelle.
â

âSentinel. Sentry. Right.â

âHeâwasâlate,â she said, picking out her few
English words from memory.

âYuss,â grinned Mo.

âHeâguardâhouse?â

âBless you, miss, you talk English as well as I
do,â cried the admiring Mo. âYuss. When his
turn comes, up and down in the street, by the

Â
gate.â He saw her puzzled look. âRoo. Port,â
said he.

â
Ah! oui, je comprends
,â smiled Jeanne. â
Merci,
monsieur, et bon soir.
â

âGood night, miss,â said Mo.

Some time later he disturbed Phineas, by whose side
he slept, from his initial preparation for slumber.

âMac! Is there any book I could learn this
blinking lingo from?â

âTry OvidââArt of Love,ââ replied Phineas
sleepily.

Â

CHAPTER XIV

The
spell of night sentry duty had always been
Doggieâs black hour. To most of the other
military routine he had grown hardened or deadened.
In the depths of his heart he hated the life as much as
ever. He had schooled himself to go through it
with the dull fatalism of a convict. It was no use
railing at inexorable laws, irremediable conditions.
The only alternative to the acceptance of his position
was military punishment, which was far worseâto
say nothing of the outrage to his pride. It was pride
that kept the little ironical smile on his lips while his
nerves were almost breaking with strain. The first
time he came under fire he was physically sickânot
from fear, for he stood it better than most, keeping an
eye on his captain, whose function it was to show an
unconcerned faceâbut from sheer nervous reaction
against the hideous noise, the stench, the ghastly upheaval
of the earth, the sight of mangled men. When
the bombardment was over, if he had been alone, he
would have sat down and cried. Never had he grown
accustomed to the foulness of the trenches. The
sounder his physical condition, the more did his
delicately trained senses revolt. It was only when
fierce animal cravings dulled these senses that he could
throw himself down anywhere and sleep, that he could
swallow anything in the way of food or drink. The
rats nearly drove him crazyâ¦. Yet, what had
once been to him a torture, the indecent, nerve-rasping

Â
publicity of the soldierâs life, had now become a
compensation. It was not so much in companionship,
like his friendly intercourse with Phineas and Mo,
that he found an anodyne, but in the consciousness of
being magnetically affected by the crowd of his fellows.
They offered him protection against himself. Whatever
pangs of self-pity he felt, whatever wan little
pleadings for the bit of fine porcelain compelled to a
rough usage which vessels of coarser clay could disregard
came lingeringly into his mind, he dared not
express them to a living soul around. On the contrary,
he set himself assiduously to cultivate the earthenware
habit of spirit; not to feel, not to think, only
to endure. To a humorously incredulous Jeanne he
proclaimed himself
abruti
. Finally, the ceaseless grind
of the military machine left him little time to think.

But in the solitary sleepless hours of sentry duty
there was nothing to do but think; nothing wherewith
to while away the time but an orgy of introspection.
First came the almost paralysing sense of responsibility.
He must keep, not only awake, but alert to the slightest
sound, the slightest movement. Lives of men depended
on his vigilance. A man canât screw himself up to
this beautifully emotional pitch for very long and be
an efficient sentry. If he did, he would challenge
mice and shoot at cloud-shadows and bring the deuce
of a commotion about his ears. And this Doggie,
who did not lack ordinary intelligence, realized. So
he strove to think of other things. And the other
things all focussed down upon his Doggie self. And
he never knew what to make of his Doggie self at all.
For he would curse the things that he once loved as
being the cause of his inexpiable shame, and at the same
time yearn for them with an agony of longing.

And he would force himself to think of Peggy and

Â
her unswerving loyalty. Of her weekly parcel of
dainty food, which had arrived that morning. Of
the joy of Phineas and the disappointment of the
unsophisticated Mo over the
pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras
. But
his mind wandered back to his Doggie self and its
humiliations and its needs and its yearnings. He
welcomed enemy flares and star-shells and excursions
and alarms. They kept him from thinking, enabled
him to pass the time. But in the dead, lonely, silent
dark, the hours were like centuries. He dreaded them.

To-night they fled like minutes. It was a pitch-black
night, spitting fine rain. It was one of Doggieâs
private grievances that it invariably rained when he
was on sentry duty. One of Heavenâs little ways of
strafing him for Doggieism. But to-night he did not
heed it. Often the passage of transport had been a
distraction for which he had longed and which, when
it came, was warmly welcome. But to-night, during
his spell, the roadway of the village was as still as death,
and he loved the stillness and the blackness. Once he
had welcomed familiar approaching steps. Now he
resented them.

âWho goes there?â

âRounds.â

And the officer, recognized, flashing an electric
torch, passed on. The diminuendo of his footsteps
was agreeable to Doggieâs ear. The rain dripped
monotonously off his helmet on to his sodden shoulders,
but Doggie did not mind. Now and then he strained
an eye upwards to that part of the living-house that was
above the gateway. Little streaks of light came downwards
through the shutter slats. Now it required
no great intellectual effort to surmise that the light
proceeded, not from the bedroom of the invalid

Â
Madame Morin, who would naturally have the best
bedroom situated in the comfortable main block of
the house, but from that of somebody else. Madame
Morin was therefore ruled out. So was Toinetteâridiculous
to think of her keeping all night vigil.
There remained only Jeanne.

It was supremely silly of him to march with super-martiality
of tread up the pavement; but then, it is often
the way of young men to do supremely silly things.

The next day was fuss and bustle, from the private
soldierâs point of view. They were marching back to the
trenches that night, and a crack company must take
over with flawless equipment and in flawless bodily
health. In the afternoon Doggie had a breathing spell
of leisure. He walked boldly into the kitchen.

âMadame,â said he to Toinette, âI suppose you
know that we are leaving to-night?â

The old woman sighed. âIt is always like that.
They come, they make friends, they go, and they
never return.â

âYou mustnât make the little soldier weep,
grandâmÃ¨re
,â
said Doggie.

âNo. It is the
grandâmÃ¨res
who weep,â replied
Toinette.

âIâll come back all right,â said he. âWhere is
Mademoiselle Jeanne?â

âShe is upstairs, monsieur.â

âIf she had gone out, I should have been disappointed,â
smiled Doggie.

âYou desire to see her, monsieur?â

âTo thank her before I go for her kindness to me.â

The old face wrinkled into a smile.

âIt was not then for the
beaux yeux
of the
grandâmÃ¨re

that you entered?â

Â
â
Si, si!
Of course it was,â he protested. âBut
one, nevertheless, must be polite to mademoiselle.â

â
AÃ¯e! aÃ¯e!
â said the old woman, bustling out:
âIâll call her.â

Presently Jeanne came in alone, calm, cool, and in
her plain black dress, looking like a sweet Fate. From
the top of her dark brown hair to her trim, stout shoes,
she gave the impression of being exquisitely ordered,
bodily and spiritually.

âIt was good of you to come,â he cried, and they
shook hands instinctively, scarcely realizing it was
for the first time. But he was sensitive to the frank
grip of her long and slender fingers.

âToinette said you wished to see me.â

âWe are going to-night. I had to come and bid
you
au revoir
!â

âIs the company returning?â

âSo I hear the quartermaster says. Are you glad?â

âYes, I am glad. One doesnât like to lose friends.â

âYou regard me as a friend, Jeanne?â

â
Pour sÃ»r
,â she replied simply.

âThen you donât mind my calling you Jeanne?â
said he.

âWhat does it matter? There are graver questions
at stake in the world.â

She crossed the kitchen and opened the yard door
which Doggie had closed behind him. Meeting a
query in his glance, she said:

âI like the fresh air, and I donât like secrecy.â

She leaned against the edge of the table and Doggie,
emboldened, seated himself on the corner by her
side, and they looked out into the little flagged courtyard
in which the men, some in grey shirt-sleeves, some
in tunics, were lounging about among the little piles of
accoutrements and packs. Here and there a man was

Â
shaving by the aid of a bit of mirror supported on a
handcart. Jests and laughter were flung in the quiet
afternoon air. A little group were feeding pigeons
which, at the sight of crumbs, had swarmed iridescent
from the tall
colombier
in the far corner near the
gabled barn. As Jeanne did not speak, at last Doggie
bent forward and, looking into her eyes, found them
moist with tears.

âWhat is the matter, Jeanne?â he asked in a low
voice.

âThe war,
mon ami
,â she replied, turning her face
towards him, âthe haunting tragedy of the war.
I donât know how to express what I mean. If all
those brave fellows there went about with serious
faces, I should not be affected.
Mais, voyez-vous,
leur gaietÃ© fait peur.
â

Their laughter frightened her.
Doggie, with his
quick responsiveness, understood. She had put into
a phrase the haunting tragedy of the war. The
eternal laughter of youth quenched in a gurgle of the
throat.

He said admiringly: âYou are a wonderful woman,
Jeanne.â

Her delicate shoulders moved, ever so little. âA
woman? I suppose I am. The day before we fled
from Cambrai it was my
jour de fÃªte
. I was eighteen.â

Doggie drew in his breath with a little gasp. He
had thought she was older than he.

âI am twenty-seven,â he said.

She looked at him calmly and critically. âYes.
Now I see. Until now I should have given you more.
But the war ages people. Isnât it true?â

âI suppose so,â said Doggie. Then he had a
brilliant idea. âBut when the war is over, weâll
remain the same age for ever and ever.â

Â
âDo you think so?â

âIâm sure of it. Weâll still both be in our twenties.
Let us suppose the war puts ten years of experience and
suffering, and what not, on to our lives. Weâll only
then be in our thirtiesâand nothing possibly can
happen to make us grow any older. At seventy we
shall still be thirty.â

âYou are consoling,â she admitted. âBut what
if the war had added thirty years to oneâs life? What
if I felt now an old woman of fifty? But yes, it is
quite true. I have the feelings and the disregard
of convention of a woman of fifty. If there had been
no war, do you think I could have gone among
an English armyâ
sans gÃªne
âlike an old matron?
Do you think a
jeune fille franÃ§aise bien Ã©levÃ©e
could
have talked to you alone as I have done the past two
days? Absurd. The explanation is the war.â

Doggie laughed. â
Vive la guerre!
â said he.

â
Mais non!
Be serious. We must come to an
understanding.â

In her preoccupation she forgot the rules laid down
for the guidance of
jeunes filles bien Ã©levÃ©es
, and unthinkingly
perched herself full on the kitchen table on the
corner of which Doggie sat in a one-legged way.
Doggie gasped again. All her assumed age fell from
her like a garment. Youth proclaimed itself in her
attitude and the supple lines of her figure. She was
but a girl after all, a girl with a steadfast soul that had
been tried in unutterable fires; but a girl appealing,
desirable. He felt mighty protective.

âAn understanding? All right,â said he.

âI donât want you to go away and think ill of meâthat
I am one of those womenâ
les affranchies
I think
they call themâwho think themselves above social
laws. I am not. I am
bourgeoise
to my finger-tips,

Â
and I reverence all the old maxims and prejudices in
which I was born. But conditions are different.
It is just like the priests who have been called into the
ranks. To look at them from the outside, you would
never dream they were priestsâbut their hearts and
their souls are untouched.â

She was so earnest, in her pathetic youthfulness, to
put herself right with him, so unlike the English girls of
his acquaintance, who would have taken this chance
companionship as a matter of course, that his face lost
the smile and became grave, and he met her sad eyes.

âThat was very bravely said, Jeanne. To me
you will be always the most wonderful woman I have
ever known.â

âWhat caused you to speak to me the first day?â
she asked, after a pause.

âI explained to youâto apologize for staring
rudely into your house.â

âIt was not because you said to yourself, âHere
is a pretty girl looking at me. Iâll go and talk to
herâ?â

Doggie threw his leg over the corner of the table
and stood on indignant feet.

âJeanne! How could youââ?â he cried.

She leaned back, her open palms on the table. The
rare light came into her eyes.

âThatâs what I wanted to know. Now we understand
each other, Monsieur Trevor.â

âI wish you wouldnât call me Monsieur Trevor,â
said he.

âWhat else can I call you? I know no other
name.â

Now he had in his pocket a letter from Peggy,
received that morning, beginning âMy dearest
Marmaduke.â Peggy seemed far away, and the name

Â
still farther. He was deliberating whether he should
say â
Appelez-moi James
â or â
Appelez-moi Jacques
,â
and inclining to the latter as being more picturesque
and intimate, when she went on:

â
Tenez
, what is it your comrades call you? âDoggieâ?â

âSay that again.â

âDog-gie.â

He had never dreamed that the hated appellation
could sound so adorable. Wellâno one except his
officers called him by any other name, and it came
with a visible charm from her lips. It brought about
the most fascinating flash of the tips of her white
teeth. He laughed.

â
A la guerre comme Ã  la guerre.
If you call me
that, you belong to the regiment. And I promise you,
it is a fine regiment.â

â
Eh bien
, Monsieur Dog-gieâââ

âThereâs no monsieur about it,â he declared,
very happily. âTommies are not
messieurs
.â

âI know one who is,â said Jeanne.

So they talked in a young and foolish way, and
Jeanne for a while forgot the tragedies that had gone
and the tragedies that might come; and Doggie
forgot both the peacock and ivory room and the fetid
hole into which he would have to creep when the nightâs
march was over. They talked of simple things.
Of Toinette, who had been with Aunt Morin ever
since she could remember.

âYou have won her heart with your snuff.â

âShe has won mine with her discretion.â

âOh-h!â said Jeanne, shocked.

And so on and so forth, as they sat side by side on
the kitchen table, swinging their feet. After a while
they drifted to graver questions.

Â
âWhat will happen to you, Jeanne, if your aunt
dies?â

â
Mon Dieu!
â said Jeanneââ

âBut you will inherit the property, and the business?â

By no means. Aunt Morin had still a son, who was
already very old. He must be forty-six. He had
expatriated himself many years ago and was in Madagascar.
The son who was killed was her Benjamin,
the child of her old age. But all her little fortune
would go to the colonial Gaspard, whom Jeanne had
never seen.

But the Farm of La Folette?

âIt has been taken and retaken by Germans and
French and English,
mon pauvre ami
, until there is no
farm left. You ought to understand that.â

It was a thing that Doggie most perfectly understood:
a patch of hideous wilderness, of poisoned,
shell-scarred, ditch-defiled, barren, loathsome earth.

And her other relations? Only an uncle, her
fatherâs youngest brother, a curÃ© in Douai in enemy
occupation. She had not heard of him since the
flight from Cambrai.

âBut what is going to become of you?â

âSo long as one keeps a brave heart what, does
it matter? I am strong. I have a good enough
education. I can earn my living. Oh, donât make
any mistake. I have no pity for myself. Those who
waste efforts in pitying themselves are not of the stuff
to make France victorious.â

âI am afraid I have done a lot of self-pitying, Jeanne.â

âDonât do it any more,â she said gently.

âI wonât,â said he.

âIf you keep to the soul you have gained, you
canât,â said Jeanne.

Â
â
Toujours la sagesse.
â

âYou are laughing at me.â

âGod forbid,â said Doggie.

Phineas and Mo came strolling towards the kitchen
door.

âMy two friends, to pay their visit of adieu,â said
he.

Jeanne slid from the table and welcomed the newcomers
in her calm, dignified way. Once more
Doggie found himself regarding her as his senior in
age and wisdom and conduct of life. The pathetic
girlishness which she had revealed to him had gone.
The age-investing ghosts had returned.

Mo grinned, interjected a British Army French
word now and then, and manifested delight when
Jeanne understood. Phineas talked laboriously, endeavouring
to expound his responsibility for Doggieâs
welfare. He had been his tutor. He used the word
â
tuteur
.â

âThatâs a guardian, you silly ass,â cried Doggie.
âHe means â
instituteur
.â Go on. Or, rather, donât
go on. The lady isnât interested.â

â
Mais si
,â said Jeanne, catching at the last English
word. âIt interests me greatly.â

â
Merci, mademoiselle
,â said Phineas grandly. âI
only wish to explain to you that while I live you
need have no fear for Doggie. I will protect him
with my body from shells and promise to bring him
safe back to you. And so will Monsieur Shendish.â

âWhatâs that?â asked Mo.

Phineas translated.

â
Oui, oui, oui!
â said Mo, nodding vigorously.

A spot of colour burned on Jeanneâs pale cheek,
and Doggie grew red under his tanned skin. He
cursed Phineas below his breath, and exchanged a

Â
significant glance with Mo. Jeanne said, in her even
voice:

âI hope all the Three Musketeers will come back
safe.â

Mo extended a grimy hand. âWell, good-bye,
miss! McPhail here and I must be going.â

She shook hands with both, wishing them
bonne
chance
, and they strolled away. Doggie lingered.

âYou mustnât mind what McPhail says. Heâs
only an old imbecile.â

âYou have two comrades who love you. That
is the principal thing.â

âI think they do, each in his way. As for
Moâââ

âMo?â She laughed. âHe is delicious.â

âWellâââ said he reluctantly, after a pause,
âgood-bye, Jeanne.â

â
Au revoir
âDog-gie.â

âIf I shouldnât come backâI mean if we were
billeted somewhere elseâI should like to write to
you.â

âWellâMademoiselle BossiÃ¨re, chez Madame
Morin, FrÃ©lus. That is the address.â

âAnd will you write too?â

Without waiting for a reply, he scribbled what was
necessary on a sheet torn from a notebook and gave
it to her. Their hands met.

â
Au revoir
, Jeanne.â

â
Au revoir
, Dog-gie. But I shall see you again
to-night.â

âWhere?â

âIt is my secret.
Bonne chance.
â

She smiled and turned to leave the kitchen. Doggie
clattered into the yard.

âBeen doinâ a fine bit oâ coartinâ, Doggie,â said

Â
Private Appleyard from Taunton, who was sitting on a
box near by and writing a letter on his knees.

âNot so much of your courting, Spud,â replied
Doggie cheerfully. âWho are you writing to?
Your best girl?â

âI be writinâ to my own lawful mizzus,â replied
Spud Appleyard.

âThen give her my love. Doggie Trevorâs love,â
said Doggie, and marched away through the groups of
men.

At the entrance to the barn he fell in with Phineas
and Mo.

âLaddie,â said the former, âalthough I meant
it at the time as a testimony of my affection, Iâve
been thinking that what I said to the young leddy
may not have been over-tactful.â

âIt was taking it too much for granted,â explained
Mo, âthat you and her were sort of keeping company.â

âYouâre a pair of idiots,â said Doggie, sitting
down between them, and taking out his pink packet
of Caporal. âHave a cigarette?â

âNot if I wos dying ofââLook âere,â said Mo,
with the light on his face of the earnest seeker after
Truth. âIf a chap ainât got no food, heâs dying
of âunger. If he ainât got no drink, heâs dying of
thirst. What the âell is he dying of if he ainât got no
tobakker?â

âArmy Service Corps,â said Phineas, pulling out
his pipe.

It was dark when A Company marched away.
Doggie had seen nothing more of Jeanne. He was
just a little disappointed; for she had promised. He
could not associate her with light words. Yet perhaps

Â
she had kept her promise. She had said â
Je vous
verrai.
â She had not undertaken to exhibit herself
to him. He derived comfort from the thought.
There was, indeed, something delicate and subtle and
enchanting in the notion. As on the previous day, the
fine weather had changed with the night and a fine rain
was falling. Doggie, an indistinguishable pack-laden
ant in the middle of the four-abreast ribbon of similar
pack-laden ants, tramped on in silence, thinking his
own thoughts. A regiment going back to the trenches
in the night is, from the point of view of the pomp
and circumstance of glorious war, a very lugubrious
procession. The sight of it would have hurt an old-time
poet. An experienced regiment has no lovely
illusions. It knows what it is going to, and the knowledge
makes it serious. It would much rather be
in bed or on snug straw than plodding through the
rain to four days and nights of eternal mud and stinking
high-explosive shell. It sets its teeth and is a very
stern, silent, ugly conglomeration of men.

âââ (
the adjective
) night,â growled Doggieâs
right-hand neighbour.

âââ (
the adjective
)â Doggie responded mechanically.

But to Doggie it was less ââââ (
adjective as
before
) than usual. Jeanneâs denunciation of self-pity
had struck deep. Compared with her calamities,
half of which would have been the stock-in-trade of
a Greek dramatist wherewith to wring tears from
mankind for a couple of thousand years, what were his
own piffling grievances? As for the ââââ night,
instead of a drizzle he would have welcomed a waterspout.
Something that really matteredâ¦. Let
the heavens or the Hun rain molten lead. Something
that would put him on an equality with Jeanneâ¦.

Â
Jeanne, with her dark haunting eyes and mobile lips,
and her slim young figure and her splendid courage.
A girl apart from the girls he had known, apart from
the women he had known, the women whom he had
imaginedâand he had not imagined manyâhis training
had atrophied such imaginings of youth. Jeanne.
Again her name conjured up visions of the Great Jeanne
of DomrÃ©my. If only he could have seen her once
again!

At the north end of the village the road took a sharp
twist, skirting a bit of rising ground. There was just
a glimmer of a warning light which streamed athwart
the turning ribbon of laden ants. And as Doggie
wheeled through the dim ray he heard a voice that rang
out clear:

â
Bonne chance!
â

He looked up swiftly. Caught the shadow of a
shadow. But it was enough. It was Jeanne. She
had kept her promise. The men responded incoherently,
waving their hands, and Doggieâs shout of
â
Merci!
â was lost. But though he knew, with a
wonderful throbbing knowledge, that Jeanneâs cry
was meant for him alone, he was thrilled by his
comradesâ instant response to Jeanneâs voice. Not a
man but he knew that it was Jeanne. But no matter.
The company paid homage to Jeanne. Jeanne who
had come out in the rain and the wind and the dark,
and had waited, waited, to redeem her promise.
â
Câest mon secret.
â

He ploughed on. Left, right! Thud, thud!
Left, right! Jeanne, Jeanne!

Â

CHAPTER XV

In
the village of FrÃ©lus life went on as before.
The same men, though a different regiment,
filled its streets and its houses; for by what signs could
the inhabitants distinguish one horde of English infantrymen
from another? Once a Highland battalion
had been billeted on them, and for the first day or so
they derived some excitement from the novelty of the
costume; the historic Franco-Scottish tradition still
lingered, and they welcomed the old allies of France
with especial kindliness; but they found that the habits
and customs of the men in kilts were identical, in their
French eyes, with those of the men in trousers. It
is true the Scotch had bagpipes. The village turned
out to listen to them in whole-eyed and whole-eared
wonder. And the memory of the skirling music
remained indelible. Otherwise there was little difference.
And when a Midland regiment succeeded a
South Coast regiment, where was the difference at all?
They might be the same men.

Jeanne, standing by the kitchen door, watching
the familiar scene in the courtyard, could scarcely
believe there had been a change. Now and again she
caught herself wondering why she could not pick
out any one of her Three Musketeers. There were
two or three soldiers, as usual, helping Toinette with
her crocks at the well. There she was, herself,
moving among them, as courteously treated as though
she were a princess. Perhaps these men, whom she

Â
heard had come from manufacturing centres, were a
trifle rougher in their manners than her late guests;
but the intention of civility and rude chivalry was no
less sincere. They came and asked for odds and
ends very politely. To all intents and purposes they
were the same set of men. Why was not Doggie
among them? It seemed very strange.

After a while she made some sort of an acquaintance
with a sergeant who had a few words of French
and appeared anxious to improve his knowledge of
the language. He explained that he had been a
teacher in what corresponded to the French
Ecoles
Normales
. He came from Birmingham, which he
gave her to understand was a glorified Lille. She
found him very earnest, very self-centred in his worship
of efficiency. As he had striven for his class of boys,
so now was he striving for his platoon of men. In a
dogmatic way he expounded to her ideals severely
practical. In their few casual conversations he
interested her. The English, from the first terrible
day of their association with her, had commanded
her deep admiration. But until latelyâin the most
recent pastâher sex, her national aloofness and her
ignorance of English, had restrained her from familiar
talk with the British Army. But now she keenly desired
to understand this strange, imperturbable, kindly race.
She put many questions to the sergeantâalways at
the kitchen door, in full view of the courtyard, for she
never thought of admitting him into the houseâand
his answers, even when he managed to make himself
intelligible, puzzled her exceedingly. One of his
remarks led her to ask for what he was fighting,
beyond his apparently fixed idea of the efficiency of
the men under his control. What was the spiritual
idea at the back of him?

Â
âThe democratization of the world and the universal
brotherhood of mankind.â

âWhen the British Lion shall lie down with the
German Lamb?â

He flashed a suspicious glance. Strenuous schoolmasters
in primary schools have little time for the
cultivation of a sense of humour.

âSomething of the sort must be the ultimate result
of the war.â

âBut in the meantime you have got to change the
German wolf into the
petit mouton
. How are you
going to do it?â

âBy British efficiency. By proving to him that
we are superior to him in every way. Weâll teach
him that it doesnât pay to be a wolf.â

âAnd do you think he will like being transformed
into a lamb, while you remain a lion?â

âI donât suppose so, but weâll give him his chance
to try to become a lion too.â

Jeanne shook her head. âNo, monsieur, wolf he
is and wolf he will remain. A wolf with venomous
teeth. The civilized world must see that the teeth
are always drawn.â

âIâm speaking of fifty years hence,â said the sergeant.

âAnd I of three hundred years hence.â

âYouâre mistaken, mademoiselle.â

Jeanne shook her head. âNo. Iâm not mistaken.
Tell me. Why do you want to become brother to
the Boche?â

âIâm not going to be his brother till the warâs
over,â said the sergeant stolidly. âAt present I am
devoting all my faculties to killing as many of him
as I can.â

She smiled. âSufficient for the day is the good
thereof. Go on killing them, monsieur. The more

Â
you kill the fewer there will be for your children and
your grandchildren to lie down with.â

She left him and tried to puzzle out his philosophy.
For the ordinary French philosophy of the war is very
simple. They have no high-falutin, altruistic ideas
of improving the Boche. They donât care a tinkerâs
curse what happens to the unholy brood beyond the
Rhine, so long as they are beaten, humiliated, subjected:
so long as there is no chance of their ever deflowering
again with their brutality the sacred soil of France.
The French mind cannot conceive the idea of this
beautiful brotherhood; but, on the contrary, rejects
it as something loathsome, something bordering on
spiritual defilementâ¦.

No; Jeanne could not accept the theory that we
were waging war for the ultimate chastening and
beatification of Germany. She preferred Doggieâs
reason for fighting. For his soul. There was something
which she could grip. And having gripped
it, it was something around which her imagination
could weave a web of noble fancy. After all, when she
came to think of it, every one of the Allies must be
fighting for his soul. For his soulâs sake had not her
father died? Although she knew no word of German,
it was obvious that the Uhlan officer had murdered
him because he had refused to betray his country.
And her uncle. To fight for his soul, had he not gone
out with his heroic but futile sporting gun? And this
pragmatical sergeant? What else had led him from
his schoolroom to the battlefield? Why couldnât he be
honest about it, like Doggie?

She missed Doggie. He ought to be there, as she
had often seen him unobserved, talking with his
friends or going about his military duties, or playing
the flageolet with the magical touch of the musician.

Â
She knew far more of Doggie than he was aware
of â¦ And at night she prayed for the little English
soldier who was facing Death.

She had much time to think of him during the
hours when she sat by the bedside of Aunt Morin,
who talked incessantly of FranÃ§ois-Marie who was
killed on the Argonne, and Gaspard who, as a
territorial
,
was no doubt defending Madagascar from invasion.
And it was pleasant to think of him, because he was a
new distraction from tragical memories. He seemed
to lay the ghosts â¦ He was different from all the
Englishmen she had met. The young officers who
had helped her in her flight, had very much the same
charm of breeding, very much the same intonation
of voice; instinctively she knew him to be of the
same social caste; but they, and the officers whom
she saw about the street and in the courtyard, when
duty called them there, had the military air of command.
And this her little English soldier had not.
Of course, he was only a private, and privates are
trained to obedience. She knew that perfectly well.
But why was he not commanding instead of obeying?
There was a reason for it. She had seen it in his eyes.
She wished she had made him talk more about himself.
Perhaps she had been unsympathetic and selfish. He
assumed, she reflected, a certain
crÃ¢nerie
with his
fellowsâand
crÃ¢nerie
is âswaggerâ bereft of vulgarityâwe
have no word to connote its conception
in a French mindâand she admired it; but her swift
intuition pierced the assumption. She divined a
world of hesitancies behind the Musketeer swing of
the shoulders. He was so gentle, so sensitive, so
quick to understand. And yet so proud. And yet
again so unconfessedly dependent. Her womanâs
protective instinct responded to a mute appeal.

Â
âBut, Maâamselle Jeanne, you are wet through,
you are perished with cold. What folly have you
been committing?â Toinette scolded, when she
returned after wishing Doggie the last â
bonne chance
.â

âThe folly of putting my Frenchwomanâs heart
(
mon cÅur de FranÃ§aise
) into the hands of a brave little
soldier to fight with him in the trenches.â

â
Mon Dieu, maâamselle
, you had better go straight
to bed, and I will bring you a
bon tilleul
, which will calm
your nerves and produce a good perspiration.â

So Toinette put Jeanne to bed and administered
the infallible infusion of lime leaves, and Jeanne was
never the worse for her adventure. But the next day
she wondered a little why she had undertaken it. She
had a vague idea that it paid a little debt of sympathy.

An evening or two afterwards Jeanne was sewing in
the kitchen when Toinette, sitting in the arm-chair
by the extinct fire, fished out of her pocket the little
olive-wood box with the pansies and forget-me-nots
on the lid, and took a long pinch of snuff. She did
it with somewhat of an air which caused Jeanne to
smile.

â
Dites donc
, Toinette, you are insupportable with
your snuff-box. One would say a marquise of the
old school.â

âAh, Maâamselle Jeanne,â said the old woman,
âyou must not laugh at me. I was just thinking
that, if anything happened to the
petit monsieur
, I
couldnât have the heart to go on putting his snuff
up my old nose.â

âNothing will happen to him,â said Jeanne.

The old woman sighed and re-engulfed the snuff-box.
âWho knows? From one minute to another
who knows whether the little ones who are dear to
us are alive or dead?â

Â
âAnd this
petit monsieur
is dear to you, Toinette?â
Jeanne asked, in her even voice, without looking
up from her sewing.

âSince he resembles my
petiot
.â

âHe will come back,â said Jeanne.

âI hope so,â said the old woman mournfully.

In spite of manifold duties, Jeanne found the days
curiously long. She slept badly. The tramp of the
sentry below her window over the archway brought her
no sense of comfort, as it had done for months before
the coming of Doggie. All the less did it produce the
queer little thrill of happiness which was hers when,
looking down through the shutter slats she had identified
in the darkness, on a change of guard, the little
English soldier to whom she had spoken so intimately.
And when he had challenged the rounds, she had
recognized his voiceâ¦. If she had obeyed an
imbecile and unmaidenly impulse, she would have
drawn open the shutter and revealed herself. But
apart from maidenly shrinkings, familiarity with war
had made her realize the sacred duties of a sentry,
and she had remained in discreet seclusion, awake
until his spell was over. But now the rhythmical
beat of the heavy boots kept her from sleeping and
would have irritated her nerves intolerably had not
her sound common sense told her that the stout fellow
who wore them was protecting her from the Hun,
together with a million or so of his fellow-countrymen.

She found herself counting the days to Doggieâs
return.

âAt last, it is to-morrow!â she said to Toinette.

âWhat is it to-morrow?â asked the old woman.

âThe return of our regiment,â replied Jeanne.

âThat is good. We have a regiment now,â said
Toinette ironically.

Â
The Midland company marched awayâas so many
had marched away before; but Jeanne did not go
to the little embankment at the turn of the road to
wish anyone good luck. She stood at the house
door, as she had always done, to watch them pass
in the darkness; for there is always something in the
sight of men going into battle which gives you a lump
in the throat. For Jeanne it had almost grown into
a religious practice.

The sergeant had told her that the new-comers
would arrive at dawn. She slept a little; awoke with
a start as day began to break; dressed swiftly, and
went downstairs to wait. And then her ear caught the
rumble and the tramp of the approaching battalion.
Presently transport rolled by, and squads of men,
haggard in the grey light, bending double under their
packs, staggered along to their billets. And then
came a rusty crew, among whom she recognized
McPhailâs tall gaunt figure. She stood by the gateway,
bareheaded, in her black dress and blue apron,
defying the sharp morning air, and watched them pass
through. She saw Mo Shendish, his eyes on the heels
of the man in front. She recognized nearly all.
But the man she looked for was not there.

He could not have passed without her seeing him;
but as soon as the gateway was clear, she ran into the
courtyard and fled across it to cut off the men. There
was no Doggie. Blank disappointment was succeeded
by sudden terror.

Phineas saw her coming. He stumbled up to her,
dropped his pack at her feet, and spread out both his
hands. She lost sight of the horde of weary clay-covered
men around her. She cried:

âWhere is he?â

âI donât know.â

Â
âHe is dead?â

âNo one knows.â

âBut you must know, you!â cried Jeanne, with a
new fear in her eyes which Phineas could not bear
to meet. âYou promised to bring him back.â

âIt was not my fault,â said Phineas. âHe was
out last nightâno, the night before, this is morningârepairing
barbed wire. I was not with him.â

â
Mais, mon Dieu
, why not?â

âBecause the duties of soldiers are arranged for
them by their officers, mademoiselle.â

âIt is true. Pardon. But continue.â

âA party went out to repair wire. It was quite
dark. Suddenly a German rifle-shot gave the alarm.
The enemy threw up star-shells and the front trenches
on each side opened fire. The wiring party, of course,
lay flat on the ground. One of them was wounded.
When it was all overâit didnât last longâour men
got back, bringing the wounded man.â

âHe is severely wounded? Speak,â cried Jeanne.

âThe wounded man was not Doggie. Doggie
went out with the party, but he did not come back.
Thatâs why I said no one knows where he is.â

She stiffened. âHe is lying out there. He is dead.â

âShendish and I and Corporal Wilson over there,
who was with the party, got permission to go out and
search. We searched all round where the repair
had been going on. But we could not find him.â

â
Merci!
I ought not to have reproached you,â
she said steadily. â
Câest un grand malheur.
â

âYou are right. Life for me is no longer of much
value.â

She looked at him in her penetrating way.

âI believe you,â she said. âFor the moment,

au revoir
. You must be worn out with fatigue.â

Â
She left him and walked through the straggling men,
who made respectful way for her. All knew of her
friendship with Doggie Trevor and all realized the
nature of this interview. They liked Doggie because
he was good-natured and plucky, and never complained
and would play the whistle on march as long as breath
enough remained in his body. As his uncle, the
Dean, had said, breed told. In a curious, half-grudging
way they recognized the fact. They laughed at his
singular inefficiency in the multitudinous arts of the
handy-man, proficiency in which is expected from the
modern private, but they knew that he would go on
till he dropped. And knowing that, they saved him
from many a reprimand which his absurd efforts in
the arts aforesaid would have brought upon him.
And now that Doggie was gone, they deplored his
loss. But so many had gone. So many had been
deplored. Human nature is only capable of a certain
amount of deploring while retaining its sanity. The
men let the pale French girl, who was Doggie Trevorâs
friend, pass by in respectful silenceâand that, for
them, was their final tribute to Doggie Trevor.

Jeanne passed into the kitchen. Toinette drew a
sharp breath at the sight of her face.

â
Quoi? Il nâest pas lÃ ?
â

âNo,â said Jeanne. âHe is wounded.â It was
impossible to explain to Toinette.

âBadly?â

âThey donât know.â

â
Oh, lÃ , lÃ !
â sighed Toinette. âThat always
happens. That is what I told you.â

âWe have no time to think of such things,â said
Jeanne.

The regimental cooks came up for the hot water,
and soon the hungry, weary, nerve-racked men were

Â
served with the morning meal. And Jeanne stood in the
courtyard in front of the kitchen door and helped with
the filling of the tea-kettles, as though no little English
soldier called âDog-gieâ had ever existed in the
regiment.

The first pale shaft of sunlight fell upon the kitchen
side of the courtyard, and in it Jeanne stood illuminated.
It touched the shades of gold in her dark brown hair,
and lit up her pale face and great unsmiling eyes.
But her lips smiled valiantly.

âWhat do yer think, Mac,â said Mo Shendish,
squatting on the flagstones, âdo you think she was
really sweet on him?â

âMan,â replied Phineas, similarly engaged, âall I
know is that she has added him to her collection of
ghosts. Itâs not an over-braw company for a lassie
to live with.â

And then, soon afterwards, the trench-broken men
stumbled into the barn to sleep, and all was quiet
again, and Jeanne went about her daily tasks with
the familiar hand of death once more closing icily
around her heart.

Â

CHAPTER XVI

The
sick-room was very hot, and Aunt Morin
very querulous. Jeanne opened a window,
but Aunt Morin complained of currents of air. Did
Jeanne want to kill her? So Jeanne closed the window.
The internal malady from which Aunt Morin suffered,
and from which it was unlikely that she would recover,
caused her considerable pain from time to
time; and on these occasions she grew fractious and
hard to bear with. The retired septuagenarian village
doctor who had taken the modest practice of his son,
now far away with the Army, advised an operation.
But Aunt Morin, with her peasantâs prejudice, declined
flatly. She knew what happened in those hospitals
where they cut people up just for the pleasure of
looking at their insides. She was not going to let a
lot of butchers amuse themselves with her old carcass.

Oh non!
When it pleased the
bon Dieu
to take her,
she was ready: the
bon Dieu
required no assistance
from
ces messieurs
. And even if she had consented,
how to take her to Paris, and once there, how to get
the operation performed, with all the hospitals full and
all the surgeons at the Front? The old doctor shrugged
his shoulders and kept life in her as best he might.

To-day, in the close room, she told a long story of
the doctorâs neglect. The medicine he gave her was
water and nothing elseâwater with nothing in it.
And to ask people to pay for that! She would not
pay. What would Jeanne advise?

Â
â
Oui, ma tante
,â said Jeanne.

â
Oui, ma tante?
But you are not listening to
what I say. At the least one can be polite.â

âI am listening,
ma tante
.â

âYou should be grateful to those who lodge and
nourish you.â

âI am grateful,
ma tante
,â said Jeanne patiently.

Aunt Morin complained of being robbed on all
sides. The doctor, Toinette, Jeanne, the English
soldiersâthe last the worst of all. Besides not paying
sufficiently for what they had, they were so wasteful
in the things they took for nothing. If they begged
for a few faggots to make a fire, they walked away
with the whole woodstack. She knew them. But
all soldiers were the same. They thought that in
time of war civilians had no rights. One of these
days she would get up and come downstairs and see
for herself the robbery that was going on.

The windows were tightly sealed. The sunlight
hurting Aunt Morinâs eyes, the outside shutters were
half closed. The room felt like a stuffy, overheated,
overcrowded sepulchre. An enormous oak press, part
of her Breton dowry, took up most of the side of one
wall. This, and a great handsome chest, a couple
of tables, a stiff arm-chair, were all too big for the
moderately sized apartment. Coloured prints of sacred
subjects, tilted at violent angles, seemed eager to occupy
as much air-space as possible. And in the middle of
the floor sprawled the vast oaken bed, with its heavy
green brocade curtains falling tentwise from a great
tarnished gilt crown in the ceiling.

Jeanne said nothing. What was the good? She
shifted the invalidâs hot pillow and gave her a drink
of tisane, moving about the over-furnished, airless
room in her calm and efficient way. Her face showed

Â
no sign of trouble, but an iron band clamped her
forehead above her burning eyes. She could perform
her nurseâs duties, but it was beyond her power to
concentrate her mind on the sick womanâs unending
litany of grievances. Far away beyond that darkened
room, beyond that fretful voice, she saw vividly a
hot waste, hideous with holes and rusted wire and
shapes of horror; and in the middle of it lay huddled
up a little khaki-clad figure with the sun blazing fiercely
in his unblinking eyes. And his very body was
beyond the reach of man, even of the most lion-hearted.

â
Mais quâas-tu, ma fille?
â asked Aunt Morin.
âYou do not speak. When people are ill they need
to be amused.â

âI am sorry,
ma tante
, but I am not feeling very
well to-day. It will pass.â

âI hope so. Young people have no business not
to feel well. Otherwise what is the good of youth?â

âIt is true,â Jeanne assented.

But what, she thought, was indeed the good of
youth, in these terrible days of war? Her own was
but a panorama of deathâ¦. And now one more
figure, this time one of youth too, had joined it.

Toinette came in.

âMaâamselle Jeanne, there are two English officers
downstairs who wish to speak to you.â

âWhat do they want?â Jeanne asked wearily.

âThey do not say. They just ask for Maâamselle
BossiÃ¨re.â

âThey never leave one in peace,
ces gens-lÃ
,â
grumbled Aunt Morin. âIf they want more concessions
in price, do not let them frighten you. Go
to Monsieur le Maire to have it arranged with justice.
These people would eat the skin off your back. Remember,
Jeanne.â

Â
â
Bien, ma tante
,â said Jeanne.

She went downstairs, conscious of gripping herself
in order to discuss with the officers whatever business
of billeting was in hand. For she had dealt with all
such matters since her arrival in FrÃ©lus. She reached
the front door and saw a dusty car with a military
chauffeur at the wheel and two officers, standing on
the pavement at the foot of the steps. One she recognized
as the commander of the company to which
her billeted men belonged. The other was a stranger,
a lieutenant, with a different badge on his cap. They
were talking and laughing together, like old friends
newly met, which by one of the myriad coincidences
of the war was really the case. On the appearance
of Jeanne they drew themselves up and saluted politely.

âMademoiselle BossiÃ¨re?â

â
Oui, monsieur.
â Then, âWill you enter, messieurs?â

They entered the vestibule where the great cask
gleamed in its polished mahogany and brass. She
bade them be seated.

âMademoiselle, Captain Willoughby tells me that
you had billeted here last week a soldier by the name
of Trevor,â said the stranger, in excellent French,
taking out notebook and pencil.

Jeanneâs lips grew white. She had not suspected
their errand.

â
Oui, monsieur.
â

âDid you have much talk with him?â

âMuch, monsieur.â

âPardon my indiscretion, mademoiselleâit is
military service, and I am an Intelligence officerâbut
did you tell him about your private affairs?â

âVery intimately,â said Jeanne.

The Intelligence officer made a note or two and

Â
smiled pleasantlyâbut Jeanne could have struck him
for daring to smile. âYou had every reason for
thinking him a man of honour?â

âWhatâs the good of asking her that, Smithers?â
Captain Willoughby interrupted in English.
âHavenât I given you my word? The manâs a
mysterious little devil, but any fool can see that heâs
a gentleman.â

âWhat do you say?â Jeanne asked tensely.

â
Je parle franÃ§ais trÃ¨s peu
,â replied Captain
Willoughby with an air of regret.

Smithers explained. âMonsieur le Capitaine says
that he guarantees the honesty of the soldier, Trevor.â

Jeanne flashed, rigid. âWho could doubt it,
monsieur? He was a gentleman, a
fils de famille
,
of the English aristocracy.â

âExcuse me for a moment,â said Smithers.

He went out. Jeanne, uncomprehending, sat silent.
Captain Willoughby, cursing an idiot education, composed
in his head a polite French sentence concerning
the weather, but before he had finished Smithers
reappeared with a strange twisted packet in his hand.
He held it out to Jeanne.

âMademoiselle, do you recognize this?â

She looked at it dully for a moment; then suddenly
sprang to her feet and clenched her hands and stared
open-mouthed. She nodded. She could not speak.
Her brain swam. They had come to her about
Doggie, who was dead, and they showed her PÃ¨re
Grigouâs packet. What was the connection between
the two?

Willoughby rose impulsively. âFor Godâs sake,
Smithers, let her down easy. Sheâll be fainting all
over the place in a minute.â

âIf this is your property, mademoiselle,â said

Â
Smithers, laying the packet on the chenille-covered
table, âyou have to thank your friend Trevor for
restoring it to you.â

She put up both hands to her reeling head.

âBut he is dead, monsieur!â

âNot a bit of it. Heâs just as much alive as you
or I.â

Jeanne swayed, tried to laugh, threw herself half
on a chair, half over the great cask, and broke down
in a passion of tears.

The two men looked at each other uncomfortably.

âFor exquisite tact,â said Willoughby, âcommend
me to an Intelligence officer.â

âBut how the deuce was I to know?â Smithers
muttered with an injured air. âMy instructions were
to find out the truth of a cock-and-bull storyâfor
thatâs what it seemed to come to. And a girl in
billetsâwellâhow was I to know what she was
like?â

âAnyhow, here weâve got hysterics,â said Willoughby.

âBut who told her the fellow was dead?â

âWhy, his pals. I thought so myself. When a
manâs missing whereâs one to suppose him to beâhaving
supper at the Savoy?â

âWell, I give women up,â said Smithers. âI
thought sheâd be glad.â

âI believe youâre a married man?â

âYes, of course.â

âWell, I ainât,â said Willoughby, and in a couple
of strides he stood close to Jeanne. He laid a gentle
hand on her heaving shoulders.

â
Pas tuÃ©! Soolmong blessÃ©
,â he shouted.

She sprang, as it were, to attention, like a frightened
recruit.

Â
âHe is wounded?â

âNot very seriously, mademoiselle.â Smithers,
casting an indignant glance at his superior officerâs
complacent smile, reassumed mastery of the situation.
âA Boche sniper got him in the leg. It will put
him out of service for a month or two. But there
is no danger.â

â
GrÃ¢ce Ã Â  Dieu!
â said Jeanne.

She leaned for a while against the cask, her hands
behind her, looking away from the two men. And
the two young men stood, somewhat embarrassed,
looking away from her and from each other. At last
she said, with an obvious striving for the even note
in her voice:

âI ask your pardon, messieurs, but sometimes sudden
happiness is more overwhelming than misfortune. I
am now quite at your service.â

âMy God! sheâs a wonder,â murmured Willoughby,
who was fair, unmarried, and impressionable.
âGo on with your dirty work.â

Smithers, conscious of linguistic superiorityâin civil
life he had been concerned with the wine trade in
Bordeauxâproceeded to carry out his instructions.
He turned over a leaf in his notebook and poised a
ready pencil.

âI must ask you, mademoiselle, some formal
questions.â

âPerfectly, monsieur,â said Jeanne.

âWhere was this packet when last you saw it?â

She made her statement, calmly.

âCan you tell me its contents?â

âNot all, monsieur. I, as a young girl, was not
in the full confidence of my parents. But I remember
my uncle saying there were about twenty thousand
francs in notes, some goldâI know not how muchâsome

Â
jewellery of my motherâsâoh, a big handful!âringsâone
a hoop of emeralds and diamondsâa
brooch with a black pearl belonging to my great-grandmotherâââ

âIt is enough, mademoiselle,â said Smithers, jotting
down notes. âAnything else besides money and
jewellery?â

âThere were papers of my father, share certificates,
bondsâ
que sais-je, moi
?â

Smithers opened the packet, which had already
been examined.

âYouâre a witness, sir, to the identification of the
property.â

âNo,â said Willoughby, âIâm just a baby captain
of infantry, and wonder why the brainy Intelligence
department doesnât hand the girl her belongings and
decently clear out.â

âIâve got to make my report, sir,â said Smithers
stiffly.

So the schedule was produced and the notes were
solemnly counted, twenty-one thousand five hundred
francs, and the gold four hundred francs, and the
jewels were identified, and the bonds, of which Jeanne
knew nothing, were checked by a list in her fatherâs
handwriting, and Jeanne signed a paper with Smithersâs
fountain-pen, and Willoughby witnessed her signature,
and thus she entered into possession of her heritage.

The officers were about to depart, but Jeanne
detained them.

âMessieurs, you must pardon me, but I am quite
bewildered. As far as I can understand, Monsieur
Trevor rescued the packet from the well at my uncleâs
farm of La Folette, and got wounded in doing so.â

âThat is quite so,â said Smithers.

âBut, monsieur, they tell me he was with a party in

Â
front of his trench mending wire. How did he reach
the well of La Folette? I donât comprehend at all.â

Smithers turned to Willoughby.

âYes. How the dickens did he know the exact
spot to go for?â

âWe had taken over a new sector, and I was
getting the topography right with a map. Trevor
was near by doing nothing, and as heâs a man of
education, I asked him to help me. There was the
site of the farm marked by name, and the ruined
well away over to the left in No Manâs Land. I
remember the beggar calling out âLa Folette!â in a
startled voice, and when I asked him what was the
matter, he said âNothing, sir!ââ

Smithers translated, and continued: âYou see,
mademoiselle, this is what happened, as far as I am
concerned. I belong to the Lancashire Fusiliers.
Our battalion is in the trenches farther up the line
than our friends. Well, just before dawn yesterday
morning a man rolled over the parapet into our trench,
and promptly fainted. He had been wounded in the
leg, and was half dead from loss of blood. Under
his tunic was this package. We identified him and
his regiment, and fixed him up and took him to the
dressing-station. But things looked very suspicious.
Here was a man who didnât belong to us with a little
fortune in loot on his person. As soon as he was fit
to be interrogated, the C.O. took him in hand. He
told the C.O. about you and your story. He regarded
the nearness of the well as something to do with
Destiny, and resolved to get you back your propertyâif
it was still there. The opportunity occurred
when the wiring party was alarmed. He crept out
to the ruins by the well, fished out the packet, and a
sniper got him. He managed to get back to our

Â
lines, having lost his way a bit, and tumbled into our
trench.â

âBut he was in danger of death all the time,â
said Jeanne, losing the steadiness of her voice.

âHe was. Every second. It was one of the most
dare-devil, scatter-brained things Iâve ever heard of.
And Iâve heard of many, mademoiselle. The only
pity is that instead of being rewarded, he will be
punished.â

âPunished?â cried Jeanne.

âNot very severely,â laughed Smithers. âCaptain
Willoughby will see to that. But reflect, mademoiselle.
His military duty was to remain with his
comrades, not to go and risk his life to get your property.
Anyhow, it is clear that he was not out for lootâ¦.
Of course, they sent me here as Intelligence officer,
to get corroboration of his story.â He paused for a
moment. Then he added: âMademoiselle, I must
congratulate you on the restoration of your fortune
and the possession of a very brave friend.â

For the first time the red spots burned on Jeanneâs
pale face.

â
Je vous remercie infiniment, monsieur.
â

â
Il sera
all right,â said Willoughby.

The officers saluted and went their ways. Jeanne
took up her packet and mounted to her little room
in a dream. Then she sat down on her bed, the
unopened packet by her side, and strove to realize it
all. But the only articulate thought came to her in
the words which she repeated over and over again:

â
Il a fait cela pour moi! Il a fait cela pour moi!
â

He had done that for her. It was incredible,
fantastic, thrillingly true, like the fairy-tales of her
childhood. The little sensitive English soldier, whom
his comrades protected, whom she herself in a feminine

Â
way longed to protect, had done this for her. In a
shy, almost reverent way, she opened out the waterproof
covering, as though to reassure herself of the
reality of things. For the first time since she left
Cambrai a smile came into her eyes, together with
grateful tears.

â
Il a fait cela pour moi! Il a fait cela pour moi!
â

A while later she relieved Toinetteâs guard in the
sick-room.

â
Eh bien?
And the two officers?â queried Aunt
Morin, after Toinette had gone. âThey have stayed
a long time. What did they want?â

Jeanne was young. She had eaten the bread of
dependence, which Aunt Morin, by reason of racial
instinct and the stress of sorrow and infirmity, had
contrived to render very bitter. She could not repress
an exultant note in her voice. Doggie, too, accounted
for something; for much.

âThey came to bring good news,
ma tante
. The
English have found all the money and the jewels and
the share certificates that PÃ¨re Grigou hid in the
well of La Folette.â

â
Mon Dieu!
It is true?â

â
Oui, ma tante.
â

âAnd they have restored them to you?â

âYes.â

âIt is extraordinary. It is truly extraordinary.
At last these English seem to be good for something.
And they found that and gave it to you without
taking anything?â

âWithout taking anything,â said Jeanne.

Aunt Morin reflected for a few moments, then
she stretched out a thin hand.

â
Ma petite Jeanne chÃ©rie
, you are rich now.â

Â
âI donât know exactly,â replied Jeanne, with a
mingling of truth and caution. âI have enough for
the present.â

âHow did it all happen?â

âIt was part of a military operation,â said Jeanne.

Perhaps later she might tell Aunt Morin about
Doggie. But now the thing was too sacred. Aunt
Morin would question, question maddeningly, until
the rainbow of her fairy-tale was unwoven. The
salient fact of the recovery of her fortune should be
enough for Aunt Morin. It was. The old woman
of the pain-pinched features looked at her wistfully
from sunken grey eyes.

âAnd now that you are rich, my little Jeanne,
you will not leave your poor old aunt, who loves you
so much, to die alone?â

â
Ah, mais non! mais non! mais non!
â cried
Jeanne indignantly. âWhat do you think I am made
of?â

âAh!â breathed Aunt Morin, comforted.

âAlso,â said Jeanne, in the matter-of-fact French
way, â
Si tu veux
, I will henceforward pay for my
lodging and nourishment.â

âYou are very good, my little Jeanne,â said Aunt
Morin. âThat will be a great help, for,
vois-tu
,
we are very poor.â

â
Oui, ma tante.
It is the war.â

âAh, the war, the war; this awful war! One
has nothing left.â

Jeanne smiled. Aunt Morin had a very comfortably
invested fortune left, for the late Monsieur Morin,
corn, hay and seed merchant, had been a very astute
person. It would make little difference to the comfort
of Aunt Morin, or to the prospects of Cousin Gaspard
in Madagascar, whether the present business of Veuve

Â
Morin et Fils went on or not. Of this Aunt Morin,
in lighter moods, had boasted many times.

âEvery one must do what they can,â said Jeanne.

âPerfectly,â said Aunt Morin. âYou are a young
girl who well understands things. And nowâit is
not good for young people to stay in a sick-roomâone
needs the fresh air.
Va te distraire, ma petite.

I am quite comfortable.â

So Jeanne went out to distract a self already distraught
with great wonder, great pride and great fear.

He had done that for her. The wonder of it
bewildered her, the pride of it thrilled her. But he
was wounded. Fear smothered her joy. They had
said there was no danger. But soldiers always made
light of wounds. It was their way in this horrible
war, in the intimate midst of which she had her being.
If a man was not dead, he was alive, and thereby
accounted lucky. In their gay optimism they had
given him a month or two of absence from the regiment.
But even in a month or twoâwhere would
the regiment be? Far, far away from FrÃ©lus.
Would she ever see Doggie again?

To distract herself she went down the village street,
bareheaded, and up the lane that led to the little
church. The church was empty, cool, and smelt of
the hill-side. Before the tinsel-crowned, mild-faced
image of the Virgin were spread the poor votive
offerings of the village. And Jeanne sank on her
knees, and bowed her head, and, without special
prayer or formula of devotion, gave herself into the
hands of the Mother of Sorrows.

She walked back comforted, vaguely conscious of
a strengthening of soul. In the vast cataclysm of
things her own hopes and fears and destiny mattered
very little. If she never saw Doggie again, if Doggie

Â
recovered and returned to the war and was killed,
her own grief mattered very little. She was but a
stray straw, and mattered very little. But what
mattered infinitely, what shone with an immortal
flame, though it were never so tiny, was the Wonderful
Spiritual Something that had guided Doggie through
the jaws of death.

That evening she had a long talk in the kitchen
with Phineas. The news of Doggieâs safety had
been given out by Willoughby, without any details.
Mo Shendish had leaped about her like a fox-terrier,
and she had laughed, with difficulty restraining her
tears. But to Phineas alone she told her whole story.
He listened in bewilderment. And the greater the
bewilderment, the worse his crude translations of English
into French. She wound up a long, eager speech
by saying:

âHe has done this for me. Why?â

âLove,â replied Phineas bluntly.

âIt is more than love,â said Jeanne, thinking of
the Wonderful Spiritual Something.

âIf you could understand English,â said Phineas,
âI would enter into the metaphysics of the subject
with pleasure, but in French it is beyond me.â

Jeanne smiled, and turned to the matter-of-fact.

âHe will go to England now that he is wounded?â

âHeâs on the way now,â said Phineas.

âHas he many friends there? I ask, because he
talks so little of himself. He is so modest.â

âOh, many friends. You see, mademoiselle,â said
Phineas, with a view to setting her mind at rest,
âDoggieâs an important person in his part of the
country. He was brought up in luxury. I know,
because I lived with him as his tutor for seven years.

Â
His father and mother are dead, and he could go on
living in luxury now, if he liked.â

âHe is then, richâDoggie?â

âHe has a fine house of his own in the country,
with many servants and automobiles, andâwaitââhe
made a swift arithmetical calculationââand an
income of eighty thousand francs a year.â

â
Comment?
â cried Jeanne sharply, with a little
frown.

Phineas McPhail was enjoying himself, basking in
the sunshine of Doggieâs wealth. Also, when conversation
in French resolved itself into the statement of
simple facts, he could get along famously. So the
temptation of the glib phrase outran his discretion.

âDoggie has a fortune of about two million francs.â

â
Il doit faire un beau mariage
,â said Jeanne, with
stony calm.

Phineas suddenly became aware of pitfalls and
summoned his craft and astuteness and knowledge
of affairs. He smiled, as he thought, encouragingly.

âThe only fine marriage is with the person one
loves.â

âNot always, monsieur,â said Jeanne, who had
watched the gathering of the sagacities with her deep
eyes. âIn any caseââshe rose and held out her handââour
friend will be well looked after in England.â

âLike a prince,â said Phineas.

He strode away greatly pleased with himself, and
went and found Mo Shendish.

âMan,â said he, âhave you ever reflected that the
dispensing of happiness is the cheapest form of human
diversion?â

âWhatâve you been doinâ now?â asked Mo.

âIâve just left a lassie tottering over with blissful
dreams.â

Â
âGorblime!â said Mo, âand to think that if I
could sling the lingo, I mightâve done the same!â

But Phineas had knocked all the dreams out of
Jeanne. The British happy-go-lucky ways of marriage
are not those of the French
bourgeoisie
, and Jeanne
had no notion of British happy-go-lucky ways.
Phineas had knocked the dream out of Jeanne by
kicking Doggie out of her sphere. And there was
a girl in England in Doggieâs sphere whom he was
to marry. She knew it. A man does not gather
his sagacities in order to answer crookedly a direct
challenge, unless there is some necessity.

Well. She would never see Doggie again. He
would pass out of her life. His destiny called him, if
he survived the slaughter of the war, to the shadowy
girl in England. Yet he had done
that
for her.
For no other woman could he ever in this life do

that
again. It was past love. Her brain boggled
at an elusive spiritual idea. She was very young,
flung cleanly trained from the convent into the warâs
terrific tragedy, wherein maiden romantic fancies
were scorched in the tender bud. Only her honest
traditions of marriage remained. Of love she knew
nothing. She leaped beyond it, seeking, seeking.
She would never see him again. There she met the
Absolute. But he had done
that
for herâthat which,
she knew not why, but she knewâhe would do for
no other woman. The Splendour of it would be her
everlasting possession.

She undressed that night, proud, dry-eyed, heroical,
and went to bed, and listened to the rhythmic tramp
of the sentry across the gateway below her window,
and suddenly a lump rose in her throat and she fell
to crying miserably.

Â

CHAPTER XVII

âHow
are you feeling, Trevor?â

âNicely, thank you, Sister.â

âGlad to be in Blighty again?â

Doggie smiled.

âGood old Blighty!â

âLeg hurting you?â

âA bit, Sister,â he replied with a little grimace.

âItâs bound to be stiff after the long journey, but
weâll soon fix it up for you.â

âIâm sure you will,â he said politely.

The nurse moved on. Doggie drew the cool clean
sheet around his shoulders and gave himself up to
the luxury of bedâreal bed. The morning sunlight
poured through the open windows, attended by a
delicious odour which after a while he recognized as
the scent of the sea. Where he was he had no notion.
He had absorbed so much of Tommyâs philosophy
as not to care. He had arrived with a convoy the
night before, after much travel in ambulances by land
and sea. If he had been a walking case, he might
have taken more interest in things; but the sniperâs
bullet in his thigh had touched the bone, and in spite
of being carried most tenderly about like a baby, he
had suffered great pain and longed for nothing and
thought of nothing but a permanent resting-place.
Now, apparently, he had found one, and looking about
him he felt peculiarly content. He seemed to have
seen no cleaner, whiter, brighter place in the world

Â
than this airy ward, swept by the sea-breeze. He
counted seven beds besides his own. On a table
running down the ward stood a vase of sweet-peas
and a bowl of roses. He thought there was never
in the world so clean and cool a figure as the grey-clad
nurse in her spotless white apron, cuffs and cap.

When she passed near him again, he summoned
her. She came to his bedside.

âWhat do you call this particular region of fairyland?â

She stared at him for a moment, adjusting things
in her mind; for his name and style were 35792
Private Trevor, J. M., but his voice and phrase were
those of her own social class. Then she smiled, and
told him. The corner of fairyland was a private
auxiliary hospital in a Lancashire seaside town.

âLancashire,â said Doggie, knitting his brow in a
puzzled way, âbut why have they sent me to Lancashire?
I belong to a West Country regiment, and
all my friends are in the South.â

âWhatâs he grousing about, Sister?â suddenly asked
the occupant of the next bed. âHeâs the sort of
chap that doesnât know when heâs in luck and when
he isnât. Iâm in the Duke of Cornwallâs Light
Infantry, I am, and when I was hit before, they sent
me to a military hospital in Inverness. Thatâd teach
you, my lad. This for me every time. You ought
to have something to grouse at.â

âIâm not grousing, you idiot!â said Doggie.

ââEreâwhoâs he calling an idjit?â cried the Duke
of Cornwallâs Light Infantryman, raising himself on
his elbow.

The nurse intervened; explained that no one
could be said to grumble at a hospital when he called
it fairyland. Trevorâs question was that of one in

Â
search of information. He did not realize that in
assigning men to the various hospitals in the United
Kingdom, the authorities could not possibly take into
account an individual manâs local association.

âOh well, if itâs only his blooming ignoranceâââ

âThatâs just it, mate,â smiled Doggie, âmy
blooming ignorance.â

âThatâs all right,â said the nurse. âNow youâre
friends.â

âHe had no right to call me an idjit,â said the
Duke of Cornwallâs Light Infantryman. He was an
aggressive, red-visaged man with bristly black hair
and stubbly black moustache.

âIf youâll agree that he wasnât grousing, Penworthy,
Iâm sure Trevor will apologize for calling
you an idiot.â

And into the nurseâs eyes crept the queer smile of
the woman learned in the ways of children.

âDidnât I say he wasnât grousing? It was only
his ignorance?â

Doggie responded. âI meant no offence, mate,
in what I said.â

The other growled an acceptance, whereupon the
nurse smiled an ironic benediction and moved away.

âWhere did you get it?â asked Penworthy.

Doggie gave the information and, in his turn, made
the polite counter-inquiry.

Penworthyâs bit of shrapnel, which had broken a
rib or two, had been acquired just north of Albert.
When he left, he said, we were putting it over in
great quantities.

âThatâs where the great push is going to be in a
few days.â

âArenât you sorry youâre out of it?â

âMe?â The Duke of Cornwallâs Light Infantryman

Â
shook his head. âI take things as I finds
âem, and I finds this quite good enough.â

So they chatted and, in the soldierâs way, became
friends. Later, the surgeon arrived and probed
Doggieâs wound and hurt him exquisitely, so that the
perspiration stood out on his forehead, and his jaws
ached afterwards from his clenching of them. While
his leg was being dressed he reflected that, a couple
of years ago, if anyone had inflicted a twentieth part
of such torture on him he would have yelled the house
down. He remembered, with an inward grin, the
anguished precautions on which he had insisted whenever
he sat down in the chair of his expensive London
dentist.

âIt must have hurt like fun,â said the nurse, busily
engaged with the gauze dressing.

âItâs all in the dayâs work,â replied Doggie.

The nurse pinned the bandage and settled him
comfortably in bed.

âNo one will worry you till dinner-time. Youâd
better try to have a sleep.â

So Doggie nodded and smiled and curled up as
best he could and slept the heavy sleep of the tired
young animal. It was only when he awoke, physically
rested and comparatively free from pain, that his
mind, hitherto confused, began to work clearly, to
straighten out the three daysâ tangle. Yes, just three
days. A fact almost impossible to realize. Till now
it had seemed an eternity.

He lay with his arms crossed under his head and
stared at the blue skyâa soft, comforting English
sky. The ward was silent. Only two beds were
occupied, one by a man asleep, the other by a man
reading a novel. His other room-mates, including
his neighbour Penworthy, were so far convalescent

Â
as to be up and away, presumably by the life-giving
sea, whose rhythmic murmur he could hear. For
the first time since he awoke to find himself bandaged
up in a strange dug-out, and surrounded by strange
faces, did the chaos of his ideas resolve itself into
anything like definite memories. Yet many of them
were still vague.

He had been out there, with the wiring party, in
the dark. He had been glad, he remembered, to
escape from the prison of the trench into the open
air. He was having some difficulty with a recalcitrant
bit of wire that refused to come straight and jabbed
him diabolically in unexpected places, when a shot
rang out and German flares went up and everybody
lay flat on the ground, while bullets spat about them.
As he lay on his stomach, a flare lit up the ruined
well of the farm of La Folette. And the well and
his nose and his heels were in a bee-line. The
realization of the fact was the inception of a fascinating
idea. He remembered that quite clearly. Of course
his discovery, two days before, of the spot where
Jeanneâs fortune lay hidden, when Captain Willoughby,
with map and periscope, had called him into consultation,
had set his heart beating and his imagination
working. But not till that moment of stark opportunity
had he dreamed of the mad adventure which
he undertook. There in front of him, at the very
farthest three hundred yards away, in bee-line with
nose and heelsâthat was the peculiar and particular
arresting factâlay Jeanneâs fortune. In thinking of
it he lost count of shots and star-shells, and heard no
orders and saw no dim forms creeping back to the
safety of the trench. And then all was darkness and
silence.

Doggie lay on his back and stared at the English

Â
sky and wondered how he did it. His attitude was
that of a man who cannot reconcile his sober self
with the idiot hero of a drunken freak. And yet, at
the time, the journey to the ruined well seemed the
simplest thing in the world. The thought of Jeanneâs
delight shone uppermost in his mindâ¦. Oh! he
was forgetting the star, which hung low beneath a
canopy of cloud, the extreme point of the famous
feet, nose and well bee-line. He made for it, now
and then walking low, now and then crawling. He
did not mind his clothes and hands being torn by the
unseen refuse of No Manâs Land. His chief sensation
was one of utter loneliness, mingled with exultance
at freedom. He did not remember feeling afraid:
which was odd, because when the star-shells had gone
up and the German trenches had opened fire on the
wiring party, his blood had turned to water and his
heart had sunk into his boots and he had been deucedly
frightened.

Heaven must have guided him straight to the well.
He had known all along that he merely would have
to stick his hand down to find the rope â¦ and he
felt no surprise when the rope actually came in contact
with his groping fingers; no surprise when he
pulled and pulled and fished up the packet. It had
all been preordained. That was the funny part of
the business which Doggie now could not understand.
But he remembered that when he had buttoned his
tunic over the precious packet, he had been possessed
of an insane desire to sing and dance. He repressed
his desire to sing, but he leaped about and started to
run. Then the star in which he trusted must have
betrayed him. It must have shed upon him a ray
just strong enough to make him a visible object;
for, suddenly,
ping!
something hit him violently on

Â
the leg and bowled him over like a rabbit into a providential
shell-hole. And there he lay quaking for a
long time, while the lunacy of his adventure coarsely
and unsentimentally revealed itself.

As to the rest, he was in a state of befogged memory.
Only one incident in that endless, cruel crawl home
remained as a landmark in his mind. He had paused
to take breath, almost ready to give up the impossible
flightâit seemed as though he were dragging behind
him a ton of red-hot ironâwhen he became conscious
of a stench violent in his nostrils. He put out a
hand. It encountered a horrible, once human face,
and his fingers touched a round recognizable cap.
Horror drove him away from the dead German and
inspired him with the strength of despairâ¦. Then
all was fog and dark again until he recovered consciousness
in the strange dug-out.

There the doctor had said to him: âYou must
have a cast-iron constitution, my lad.â

The memory caused a flicker round his lips. It
wasnât everybody who could crawl on his belly for
nearly a quarter of a mile with a bullet through his
leg, and come up smiling at the end of it. A cast-iron
constitution! If he had only known it fifteen, even
ten years ago, what a different life he might have led.
The great disgrace would never have come upon him.

And Jeanne? What of Jeanne? After he had
told his story, they had given him to understand that
an officer would be sent to FrÃ©lus to corroborate it,
and, if he found it true, that Jeanne would enter
into possession of her packet. And that was all he
knew, for they had bundled him out of the front
trenches as quickly as possible; and once out he had
become a case, a stretcher case, and although he had
been treated, as a case, with almost superhuman tenderness,

Â
not a soul regarded him as a human being with
a personality or a historyânot even with a military
history. And this same military history had vaguely
worried him all the time, and now that he could
think clearly, worried him with a very definite worry.
In leaving his firing-party he had been guilty of a
crime. Every misdemeanour in the Army is termed
a crimeâfrom murder to appearing buttonless on
parade. Was it desertion? If so, he might be shot.
He had not thought of that when he started on his quest.
It had seemed so simple to account for half an hourâs
absence by saying that he had lost his way in the dark.
But now, that plausible excuse was invalidâ¦.

Doggie thought terribly hard that quiet, sea-scented
morning. After all, it did not very much matter
what they did to him. Sticking him up against a
wall and shooting him was a remote possibility; he
was in the British and not the German Army. Field
punishments of unpleasant kinds were only inflicted
on people convicted of unpleasant delinquencies. If
he were a sergeant or a corporal, he doubtless would
be broken. But such is the fortunate position of a
private, that he cannot be degraded to an inferior
rank. At the worst they might give him cells when
he recovered. Well, he could stick it. It didnât
matter. What really mattered was Jeanne. Was
she in undisputed possession of her packet? When
it was a question of practical warfare, Doggie had
blind faith in his officersâa faith perhaps even more
childlike than that of his fellow-privates, for officers
were the men who had come through the ordeal in
which he had so lamentably failed; but when it
came to administrative affairs, he was more critical.
He had suffered during his military career from more
than one subaltern on whose arid consciousness the

Â
brain-wave never beat. He had never met even a
field officer before whom, in the realm of intellect,
he had stood in awe. If any one of those dimly
envisaged and still more dimly remembered officers
of the Lancashire Fusiliers had ordered him to stand
on his head on top of the parapet, he would have
obeyed in cheerful confidence; but he was not at
all certain that, in the effort to deliver the packet to
Jeanne, they would not make an unholy mess of
things. He saw stacks of dirty yellowish bits of
paper, with A.F. No. something or the other, floating
between FrÃ©lus and the Lancashire Battalion H.Q.
and the Brigade H.Q. and the Divisional H.Q., and
so on through the majesty of G.H.Q. to the awful
War Office itself. In pessimistic mood he thought
that if Jeanne recovered her property within a year,
she would be lucky.

What a wonderful creature was Jeanne! He shut
his eyes to the blue sky and pictured her as she stood in
the light, on the ragged escarpment, with her garments
beaten by wind and rain. And he remembered the
weary thud, thud of railway and steamer, which had
resolved itself, like the rhythmic tramp of feet that
night, into the ceaseless refrain: âJeanne! Jeanne!â

He opened his eyes again and frowned at the blue
English sky. It had no business to proclaim simple
serenity when his mind was in such a state of complex
tangle. It was all very well to think of JeanneâJeanne,
whom it was unlikely that Fate would ever
allow him to see again, even supposing the war ended
during his lifetime; but there was PeggyâPeggy, his
future wife, who had stuck to him loyally through good
and evil repute. Yes, there was Peggyânot the
faintest shadow of doubt about it. Doggie kept on
frowning at the blue sky. Blighty was a very desirable

Â
country, but in it you were compelled to think. And
enforced thought was an infernal nuisance. The
beastly trenches had their good points after all. There
you were not called upon to think of anything; the
less you thought, the better for your job; you just
ate your bully-beef and drank your tea and cursed
whizz-bangs and killed a rat or two, and thanked
God you were alive.

Now that he came to look at it in proper perspective,
it wasnât at all a bad life. When had he been worried
to death, as he was now? And there were his friends:
the humorous, genial, deboshed, yet ever-kindly
Phineas; dear old Mo Shendish, whose material feet
were hankering after the vulgar pavement of Mare
Street, Hackney, but whose spiritual tread rang on
golden floors dimly imagined by the Seer of Patmos;
Barrett, the D. C. M., the miniature Hercules, who,
according to legend, though, modestly, he would never
own to it, seized two Boches by the neck and knocked
their heads together till they died, and who, musically
inclined, would sit at his, Doggieâs, feet while he played
on his penny whistle all the sentimental tunes he had
ever heard of; Sergeant Ballinghall, a tower of a
man, a champion amateur heavy-weight boxer, with
a voice compared with which a megaphone sounded
like a maidenâs prayer, and a Bardolphian nose and
an eagle eye and the heart of a broody hen, who had
not only given him boxing lessons, but had pulled
him through difficult places innumerable â¦ and
scores of others. He wondered what they were doing.
He also was foolish enough to wonder whether they
missed him, forgetting for the moment that if a regiment
took seriously to missing their comrades sent
to Kingdom Come or Blighty, they would be more
like weeping willows than destroyers of Huns.

Â
All the same, he knew that he would always live
in the hearts of two or three of them, and the knowledge
brought him considerable comfort. It was
strange to realize how the tentacles of his being
stretched out gropingly towards these (from the old
Durdlebury point of view) impossible friends. They
had grafted themselves on to his life. Or was that
a correct way of putting it? Had they not, rather,
all grafted themselves on to a common stock of life,
so that the one common sap ran through all their
veins?

It took him a long time to get this idea formulated,
fixed and accepted. But Doggie was not one to
boggle at the truth, as he saw it. And this was the
truth. He, James Marmaduke Trevor of Denby
Hall, was a Tommy of the Tommies. He had lived
the Tommy life intensely. He was living it now.
And the extraordinary part of it was that he didnât
want to be anything else but a Tommy. From the
social or gregarious point of view his life for the past
year had been one of unclouded happiness. The
realization of it, now that he was clearly sizing up
the ramshackle thing which he called his existence,
hit him like the butt-end of a rifle. Hardship, cold,
hunger, fatigue, stench, rats, the dread of inefficiencyâall
these had been factors of misery which he could
never eliminate from his soldierâs equation; but such
free, joyous, intimate companionship with real human
beings he had never enjoyed since he was born. He
longed to be back among them, doing the same old
weary, dreary, things, eating the same old Robinson
Crusoe kind of food, crouching with them in the same
old beastly hole in the ground, while the Boche let
loose hell on the trench. Mo Shendishâs grin and
his ââEre, get in aht of the rain,â and his grip on his

Â
shoulder, dragging him a few inches farther into
shelter, were a spiritual compensation transcending
physical discomfitures and perils.

âItâs all dam funny,â he said half aloud.

But this was England, and although he was hedged
about, protected and restricted by War Office Regulation
Red Tape twisted round to the strength of steel
cables, yet he was in command of telegraphs, of telephones,
and, in a secondary degree, of the railway
system of the United Kingdom.

He found himself deprecating the compulsory facilities
of communication in the civilized world. The
Deanery must be informed of his home-coming.

As soon as he could secure the services of a nurse
he wrote out three telegrams: one addressed âConover,
The Deanery, Durdleburyâ; one to Peddle
at Denby Hall, and one to Jeanne. The one to
Jeanne was the longest, and was âReply paid.â

âThis is going to cost a small fortune, young man,â
said the nurse.

Doggie smiled as he drew out a Â£1 treasury note
from his soldierâs pocket-book, the pathetic object
containing a form of Will on the right-hand flap and
on the left the directions for the making of the Will,
concluding with the world-famous typical signature
of Thomas Atkins.

âItâs a bust, Sister,â said he. âIâve been saving
up for it for months.â

Then, duty accomplished, he reconciled himself
to the corner of fairyland in which he had awoke
that morning. Things must take their course, and
while they were taking it, why worry? So long as
they didnât commit the outrage of giving him bully-beef
for dinner, the present coolness and comfort
sufficed for his happiness.

Â

CHAPTER XVIII

The
replies to the telegrams were satisfactory.
Peggy, adjuring him to write a full account
of himself, announced her intention of coming up to
see him as soon as he could guarantee his fitness to
receive visitors. Jeanne wired: â
Paquet reÃ§u. Mille
remerciements.
â The news cheered him exceedingly.
It was worth a hole in the leg. Henceforward Jeanne
would be independent of Aunt Morin, of whose
generous affection, in spite of Jeanneâs loyal reticence,
he had formed but a poor opinion. Now the old
lady could die whenever she liked, and so much the
better for Jeanne. Jeanne would then be freed from
the unhealthy sick-room, from dreary little FrÃ©lus,
and from enforced consorting with the riff-raff (namely,
all other regiments except his own) of the British
Army. Even as it was, he did not enjoy thinking
of her as hail-fellow-well-met with his own fellow-privatesâperhaps
with the exception of Phineas and
Mo, who were in a different position, having been
formally admitted into a peculiar intimacy. Of course,
if Doggie had possessed a more analytical mind, he
would have been greatly surprised to discover that
these feelings arose from a healthy, barbaric sense of
ownership of Jeanne; that Mo and Phineas were
in a special position because they humbly recognized
this fact of ownership and adopted a respectful attitude
towards his property, and that of all other predatory
men in uniform he was distrustful and jealous. But

Â
Doggie was a simple soul and went through a great
many elementary emotions, just as Monsieur Jourdain
spoke prose,
sans le savoir
. Without knowing it, he
would have gone to the ends of the earth for Jeanne,
have clubbed over the head any fellow-savage who
should seek to rob him of Jeanne. It did not occur
to him that savage instinct had already sent him into
the jaws of death, solely in order to establish his
primitive manâs ownership of Jeanne. When he came
to reflect, in his Doggie-ish way, on the motives of
his exploit, he was somewhat baffled. Jeanne, with
her tragic face, and her tragic history, and her steadfast
soul shining out of her eyes, was the most wonderful
woman he had ever met. She personified the heroic
womanhood of France. The foul invader had robbed
her of her family and her patrimony. The dead
were dead, and could not be restored; but the material
wealth, Godâwho else?âhad given him this miraculous
chance to recover; and he had recovered it.
National pride helped to confuse issues. He, an
Englishman, had saved this heroic daughter of France
from povertyâ¦.

If only he could have won back to his own trench,
and, later, when the company returned to FrÃ©lus,
he could have handed her the packet and seen the
light come into those wonderful eyes!

Anyhow, she had received it. She sent him a
thousand thanks. How did she look, what did she
say when she cut the string and undid the seals and
found her little fortune?

Translate Jeanne into a princess, the dirty waterproof
package into a golden casket, himself into a
knight disguised as a squire of low degree, and what
more could you want for a first-class fairy-tale? The

Â
idea struck Doggie at the moment of âlights out,â
and he laughed aloud.

âIt doesnât take much to amuse some people,â
growled his neighbour, Penworthy.

âSign of a happy disposition,â said Doggie.

âWhatâve you got to be happy about?â

âI was thinking how alive we are, and how dead
you and I might be,â said Doggie.

âWell, I donât think it funny thinking how one
might be dead,â replied Penworthy. âIt gives me
the creeps. Itâs all very well for you. Youâll stump
around for the rest of your life like a gentleman on
a wooden leg. Chaps like you have all the luck;
but as soon as I get out of this, Iâll be passed fit for
active service â¦ and not so much of your larfing
at not being dead. See?â

âAll right, mate,â said Doggie. âGood night.â

Penworthy made no immediate reply; but presently
he broke out:

âWhat dâyou mean by talking like that? Iâd
hate being dead.â

A voice from the far end of the room luridly requested
that the conversation should cease. Silence
reigned.

A letter from Jeanne. The envelope bore a French
stamp with the FrÃ©lus postmark, and the address was
in a bold feminine hand. From whom could it be
but Jeanne? His heart gave a ridiculous leap and
he tore the envelope open as he had never torn open
envelope of Peggyâs. But at the first two words the
leap seemed to be one in mid-air, and his heart went
down, down, down like an aeroplane done in, and
arrived with a hideous bump upon rocks.

â
Cher Monsieur
â

Â
Cher Monsieur
from JeanneâJeanne who had
called him âDog-gieâ in accents that had rendered
adorable the once execrated syllables.
Cher Monsieur!

And the following, in formal Frenchâit might
have been a convent exercise in compositionâis what
she said:

âThe military authorities have remitted into my
possession the package which you so heroically rescued
from the well of the farm of La Folette. It contains
all that my father was able to save of his fortune, and
on consultation with MaÃ®tre PÃ©pineau here, it appears
that I have sufficient to live modestly for the rest of
my life. For the marvellous devotion of you, monsieur,
an English gentleman, to the poor interests of
an obscure young French girl, I can never be sufficiently
grateful. There will never be a prayer of
mine, until I die, in which you will not be mentioned.
To me it will be always a symbolic act of your chivalrous
England in the aid of my beloved France. That
you have been wounded in this noble and selfless
enterprise, is to me a subject both of pride and terrifying
dismay. I am moved to the depths of my being.
But I have been assured, and your telegram confirms
the assurance, that your wound is not dangerous.
If you had been killed while rendering me this wonderful
service, or incapacitated so that you could no
longer strike a blow for your country and mine, I
should never have forgiven myself. I should have
felt that I had robbed France of a heroic defender.
I pray God that you may soon recover, and in fighting
once more against our common enemy, you may
win the glory that no English soldier can deserve
more than you. Forgive me if I express badly the
emotions which overwhelm me. It is impossible

Â
that we shall meet again. One of the few English
novels I have tried to read,
Ã  coups de dictionnaire
,
was
Ships that Pass in the Night
. In spite
of the great thing that you have done for me, it is
inevitable that we should be such passing vessels. It
is life. If, as I shall ceaselessly pray, you survive
this terrible war, you will follow your destiny as an
Englishman of high position, and I that which God
marks out for me.

âI ask you to accept again the expression of my
imperishable gratitude. Adieu.

â
Jeanne BossiÃ¨re.
â

The more often Doggie read this perfectly phrased
epistle, the greater waxed his puzzledom. The
gratitude was all there; more than enough. It was
gratitude and nothing else. He had longed for a
human story telling just how the thing had happened,
just how Jeanne had felt. He had wanted her to
say: âGet well soon and come back, and Iâll tell
you all about it.â But instead of that she dwelt on
the difference of their social status, loftily announced
that they would never meet again and that they would
follow different destinies, and bade him the
adieu

which in French is the final leave-taking. All of
which to Doggie, the unsophisticated, would have
seemed ridiculous, had it not been so tragic. He
couldnât reconcile the beautiful letter, written in
faultless handwriting and impeccable French, with the
rain-swept girl on the escarpment. What did she
mean? What had come over her?

But the ways of Jeannes are not the ways of Doggies.
How was he to know of the boastings of Phineas
McPhail, and the hopelessness with which they filled
Jeanneâs heart? How was he to know that she had

Â
sat up most of the night in her little room over the
gateway, drafting and redrafting this precious composition,
until, having reduced it to soul-devastating
correctitude, and, with aching eyes and head, made a
fair and faultless copy, she had once more cried herself
into miserable slumber?

At once Doggie called for pad and pencil, and
began to write:

âMy dear Jeanne,â

âI donât understand. What fly has stung you?
(
Quelle mouche vous a piquÃ©e?
) Of course we shall
meet again. Do you suppose I am going to let you
go out of my life?â

(He sucked his pencil. Jeanne must be spoken to
severely.)

âWhat rubbish are you talking about my social
position? My father was an English parson (
pasteur
anglais
) and yours a French lawyer. If I have a
little money of my own, so have you. And we are
not ships and we have not passed in the night. And
that we should not meet again is not Life. It is
absurdity. We are going to meet as soon as wounds
and war will let me, and I am not your â
Cher Monsieur
,â
but your â
Cher Dog-gie
,â andâââ

âHere is a letter for you, brought by hand,â said
the nurse, bustling to his bedside.

It was from Peggy.

âOh, lord!â said Doggie.

Peggy was there. She had arrived from Durdlebury
all alone, the night before, and was putting up
at an hotel. The venerable idiot, with red crosses
and bits of tin all over her, who seemed to run the
hospital, wouldnât let her in to see him till the regulation

Â
visiting hour of three oâclock. That she, Peggy,
was a Deanâs daughter, who had travelled hundreds
of miles to see the man she was engaged to, did not
seem to impress the venerable idiot in the least. Till
three oâclock then. With love from Peggy.

âThe lady, I believe, is waiting for an answer,â
said the nurse.

âOh, my hat!â said Doggie below his breath.

To write the answer, he had to strip from the pad
the page on which he had begun the letter to Jeanne.
He wrote: âDearest Peggy.â Then the pencil-pointâs
impress through the thin paper stared at him.
Almost every word was decipherable. Recklessly he
tore the pad in half and on a virgin page scribbled his
message to Peggy. The nurse departed with it. He
took up the flimsy sheet containing his interrupted
letter to Jeanne and glanced at it in dismay. For
the first time it struck him that such words, to a
girl even of the lowest intelligence, could only have
one interpretation. Doggie said, âOh, lord!â and
âOh, my hat!â and Oh all sorts of unprintable
things that he had learned in the army. And he
put to himself the essential question: What the Hades
was he playing at?

Obviously, the first thing to do was to destroy the
letter to Jeanne and the tell-tale impress. This he
forthwith did. He tore the sheets into the tiniest
fragments, stretched out his arm to put the handful
on the table by the bed, missed his aim and dropped it
on the floor. Whereby he incurred the just wrath
of the hard-worked nurse.

Again he took up Jeanneâs letter. After all, what
was wrong with it? He must look at things from
her point of view. What had really happened? Let
him set out the facts judicially. They had struck up

Â
a day or twoâs friendship. She had told him, as she
might have told any decent soul, her sad and romantic
story. The English during the great retreat had
rendered her unforgettable services. She was a girl
of a generously responsive nature. She would pay
her debt of gratitude to the English soldier. Her
fine
vale
on the memorable night of rain was part
payment of her debt to England. Yes. Let him get
things in the right perspectiveâ¦. She had made
friends with him because he was one of the few private
soldiers who could speak her language. It was but
natural that she should tell him of the sunken packet.
It was one of the most vital facts of her life. But
just an outside fact: nothing to do with any shy
mysterious workings of her womanâs soul. She might
have told the story to any man in the company without
derogation from her womanly dignity. And any
man Jack of them, having Jeanneâs confidence, having
the knowledge of the situation of the ruined well,
having the God-sent opportunity of recovering the
treasure, would, of absolute certainty, have done
exactly what he, Doggie, had done. Supposing Mo
Shendish had been the privileged person, instead of
himself. What, by way of thanks, could Jeanne have
written?  A letter practically identical.

Practically. A very comfortable sort of word; but
Doggieâs cultivated mind disliked it. It was a slovenly
word, a makeshift for the hard broom of clean thought.
This infernal âpracticallyâ begged the whole question.
Jeanne would not have sentimentalized to Mo
Shendish about ships passing in the night. No, she
wouldnât, in spite of all his efforts to persuade himself
that she would. Well, perhaps dear old Mo was a
rough, uneducated sort of chap. He could not have
established with Jeanne such delicate relations of

Â
friendship as exist between social equals. Obviously
the finer shades of her letter would have varied according
to the personality of the recipient. Jeanne and
himself, owing to the abnormal conditions of war,
had suddenly become very intimate friends. The
war, as she imagined, must part them for ever. She
bade him a touching and dignified farewell, and that
was the end of the matter. It had all been an idyllic
episode; beginning, middle, and end; neatly rounded
off; a thing done, and done withâexcept as a strange
romantic memory. It was all over. As long as he
remained in the army, a condition for which, as a
private soldier, he was not responsible, how could he
see Jeanne again? By the time he rejoined, the
regiment would be many miles away from FrÃ©lus.
This, in her clear, steady way, she realized. Her
letter must be final.

It had to be final. Was not Peggy coming at
three oâclock?

Again Doggie thought, somewhat wistfully, of the
old care-free, full physical life, and again he murmured:

âItâs all dam funny!â

Peggy stood for a moment at the door scanning
the ward; then perceiving him, she marched down
with a defiant glance at nurses and blue-uniformed
comrades and men in bed and other strangers, swung
a chair and established herself by his bedside.

âYou dear old thing, I couldnât bear to think of
you lying here alone,â she said, with the hurry that
seeks to cover shyness. âI had to come. Motherâs
gone
fut
and canât travel, and Dadâs running all the
parsonsâ shows in the district. Otherwise one of
them would have come too.â

âItâs awfully good of you, Peggy,â he said, with

Â
a smile, for fair and flushed she was pleasant to look
upon. âBut it must have been a fiendish journey.â

âRotten!â said Peggy. âBut thatâs a trifle.
Youâre the all-important thing. Tell me straight.
Youâre not badly hurt, are you?â

âLord, no,â he replied cheerfully. âJust the
fleshy part of the legâa clean bullet-wound. Bone
touched; but they say Iâll be fit quite soon.â

âSure? Theyâre not going to cut off your leg
or do anything horrid?â

He laughed. âSure,â said he.

âThatâs all right.â

There was a pause. Now that they had met they
seemed to have little to say. She looked around.
Presently she remarked:

âEverything looks quite fresh and clean.â

âItâs perfect.â

âRather public, though,â said Peggy.

âPublicity is the paradoxical condition of the
privateâs life,â laughed Doggie.

Another pause.

âWell, how are you feeling?â

âFirst-rate,â said Doggie. âItâs nothing to fuss
over. I hope to be out again in a month or two.â

âOut where?â

âIn Franceâwith the regiment.â

Peggy drew a little breath of astonishment and sat
up on her chair. His surprising statement seemed to
have broken up the atmosphere of restraint.

âDo you mean to say you
want
to go back to the
trenches?â

Conscientious Doggie knitted his brows. A fervent
âYesâ would proclaim him a modern Paladin, eager
to slay Huns. Now, as a patriotic Englishman he
loved Huns to be slain, but as the survivor of James

Â
Marmaduke Trevor, dilettante expert on the theorbo
and the viol da gamba and owner of the peacock and
ivory room in Denby Hall, to say nothing of the
collector of little china dogs, he could not honestly
declare that he enjoyed the various processes of slaying
them.

âI canât explain,â he replied, after a while.
âWhen I was out, I thought I hated every minute
of it. Now I look back, I find Iâve had quite a good
time. Iâve not once really been sick or sorry. For
instance, Iâve often thought myself beastly miserable
with wet and mud and east windâbut Iâve never
had even a cold in the head. I never knew how good
it was to feel fit. And there are other things. When
I left Durdlebury, I hadnât a man friend in the world.
Now I have a lot of wonderful pals who would go
through hell for one anotherâand for me.â

âTommies?â

âOf courseâTommies.â

âYou mean gentlemen in the ranks?â

âNot a bit of it. Or yes. All are gentlemen in
the ranks. All sorts and conditions of men. The
man whom I honour and love more than anyone else,
comes from a fish-shop in Hackney. Thatâs the
fascinating part of it. Do understand me, Peggy,â
he continued, after a short silence, during which she
regarded him almost uncomprehendingly. âI donât
say Iâm yearning to sleep in a filthy dug out or to
wallow in the ground under shell-fire, or anything of
that sort. Thatâs beastly. Thereâs only one other
word for it, which begins with the same letter, and
the superior kind of private doesnât use it in ladiesâ
societyâ¦. But while Iâm lying here I wonder
what all the other fellows are doingâtheyâre such
good chapsâreal, true, clean menâout there you

Â
seem to get to essentialsâall the rest is leather and
prunellaâand I want to be back among them again.
Why should I be in clover while theyâre in choking
dustâa lot of it composed of desiccated Boches?â

âHow horrid!â cried Peggy, with a little shiver.

âOf course itâs horrid. But theyâve got to stick
it, havenât they? And then thereâs another thing.
Out there one hasnât any worries.â

Peggy pricked up her ears. âWorries? What
kind of worries?â

Doggie became conscious of indiscretion. He
temporized.

âOh, all kinds. Every man with a sort of trained
intellect must have them. You remember John
Stuart Millâs problem: âWhich would you sooner
beâa contented hog, or a discontented philosopher?â
At the Front you have all the joys of the contented
hog.â

Instinctively he stretched out his hand for a cigarette.
She bent forward, gripped a matchbox, and lit the
cigarette for him.

Doggie thanked her politely; but in a dim way
he felt conscious of something lacking in her little
act of helpfulness. It had been performed with the
unsmiling perfunctoriness of the nurse; an act of
duty, not of tenderness. As she blew out the match,
which she did with an odd air of deliberation, her face
wore the same expression of hardness it had done
on that memorable day when she had refused him her
sympathy over the white feather incident.

âI canât understand your wanting to go back at
all. Surely youâve done your bit,â she said.

âNo one has done his bit whoâs alive and able to
carry on,â replied Doggie.

Peggy reflected. Yes. There was some truth in

Â
that. But she thought it rather hard lines on the
wounded to be sent back as soon as they were patched
up. Most of them hated the prospect. That was
why she couldnât understand Doggieâs desire.

âAnyhow, itâs jolly noble of you, dear old thing,â
she declared with rather a spasmodic change of manner,
âand Iâm very proud of you.â

âFor Godâs sake, donât go imagining me a hero,â
cried Doggie in alarm, âfor Iâm not. I hate the
fighting like poison. The only reason I donât run
away is because I canât. It would be far more
dangerous than standing still. It would mean an
officerâs bullet through my head at once.â

âAny man who is wounded in the defence of his
country is a hero,â said Peggy defiantly.

âRot!â said Doggie.

âAnd all this time you havenât told me how you
got it. How did you?â

Doggie squirmed. The inevitable and dreaded
question had come at last.

âI just got sniped when I was out, at night, with
a wiring party,â he said hurriedly.

âBut thatâs no description at all,â she objected.

âIâm afraid itâs all I can give,â Doggie replied.
Then, by way of salve to a sensitive conscience, he
added: âThere was nothing brave or heroic about
it, at allâjust a silly accident. It was as safe as tying
up hollyhocks in a garden. Only an idiot Boche let
off his gun on spec and got me. Donât let us talk
about it.â

But Peggy was insistent. âIâm not such a fool
as not to know what mending barbed wire at night
means. And whatever you may say, you got wounded
in the service of your country.â

It was on Doggieâs agitated lips to shout a true

Â
âI didnât!â For that was the devil of it. Had
he been so wounded, he could have purred contentedly
while accepting the genuine heroâs meed of homage
and consolation. But he had left his countryâs service
to enter that of Jeanne. In her service he had been
shot through the leg. He had no business to be
wounded at all. Jeanne saw that very clearly. To
have exposed himself to the risk of his exploit was
contrary to all his countryâs interests. His wound
had robbed her of a fighting man, not a particularly
valuable warrior, but a soldier in the firing line all
the same. If every man went off like that on private
missions of his own and got properly potted, there
would be the end of the Army. It was horrible to
be an interesting hero under false pretences.

Of course he might have been George Washingtonian
enough to shout: âI cannot tell a lie. I
didnât.â But that would have meant relating the
whole story of Jeanne. And would Peggy have understood
the story of Jeanne? Could Peggy, in her
plain-sailing, breezy British way, have appreciated all
the subtleties of his relations with Jeanne? She would
ask pointed, probably barbed, questions about Jeanne.
She would tear the whole romance to shreds. Jeanne
stood too exquisite a symbol for him to permit the
sacrilege of Peggyâs ruthless vivisection. For vivisect
she would, without shadow of doubt. His long and
innocent familiarity with womankind in Durdlebury
had led him instinctively to the conclusion formulated
by one of the worldâs greatest cynics in his advice
to a young man: âIf you care for happiness, never
speak to a woman about another woman.â

Doggie felt uncomfortable as he looked into Peggyâs
clear blue eyes; not conscience-stricken at the realization
of himself as a scoundrelly Don Juanâthat never

Â
entered his ingenuous mind; but he hated his enforced
departure from veracity. The one virtue that had
dragged the toy Pom successfully along the Rough
Road of the soldierâs life was his uncompromising
attitude to Truth. It cost him a sharp struggle with
his soul to reply to Peggy:

âAll right. Have it so if it pleases you, my dear.
But it was an idiot fluke all the same.â

âI wonder if you know how youâve changed,â
she said, after a while.

âFor better or worse?â

âThe obvious thing to say would be âfor the
better.â But I wonder. Do you mind if Iâm
frank?â

âNot a bit.â

âThereâs something hard about you, Marmaduke.â

Doggie wrinkled lips and brow in a curious smile.
âIâll be frank too. You see, Iâve been living among
men, instead of a pack of old women.â

âI suppose thatâs it,â Peggy said thoughtfully.

âItâs a dud sort of place, Durdlebury,â said he.

âDud?â

He laughed. âIt never goes off.â

âYou used to say, in your letters, that you longed
for it.â

âPerhaps I do nowâin a way. I donât know.â

âI bet youâll settle down there after the war,
just as though nothing had happened.â

âI wonder,â said Doggie.

âOf course you will. Do you remember our
plans for the reconstruction of Denby Hall, which
were knocked on the head? All thatâll have to be
gone into again.â

âThat doesnât mean that we need curl ourselves
up there for ever like caterpillars in a cabbage.â

Â
She arched her eyebrows. âWhat would you like
to do?â

âI think Iâll want to go round and round the world
till Iâm dizzy.â

At this amazing pronouncement from Marmaduke
Trevor, Peggy gasped. It also astonished Doggie
himself. He had not progressed so far on the road
to self-emancipation as to dream of a rupture of his
engagement. His marriage was as much a decree of
destiny as had been his enlistment when he walked
to Peter Panâs statue in Kensington Gardens. But
the war had made the prospect a distant one. In
the vague future he would marry and settle down.
But now Peggy brought it into alarming nearness,
thereby causing him considerable agitation. To go
back to vegetation in Durdlebury, even with so desirable
a companion cabbage as Peggy, just when he was
beginning to conjecture what there might be of joy
and thrill in lifeâthe thought dismayed him; and
the sudden dismay found expression in his rhetorical
outburst.

âOh, if you want to travel for a year or two, Iâm
all for it,â cried Peggy. âI canât say Iâve seen much
of the world. But weâll soon get sick of it, and
yearn for home. Thereâll be lots of things to do.
Weâll take up our position as county peopleâno
more of the stuffy old women youâre so down onâand
youâll get into Parliament and sit on committees,
and so on, and altogether weâll have a topping time.â

Doggie had an odd sensation that a stranger spoke
through Peggyâs familiar lips. Well, perhaps, not a
stranger, but a half-forgotten dead and gone acquaintance.

âDonât you think the war will change thingsâif
it hasnât changed them already?â

Â
âNot a bit,â Peggy replied. âDadâs always talking
learnedly about social reconstruction, whatever
that means. But if people have got money and position
and all that sort of thing, whoâs going to take it away
from them? You donât suppose weâre all going to
turn socialists and pool the wealth of the country, and
everybodyâs going to live in a garden-city and wear
sandals and eat nuts?â

âOf course not,â said Doggie.

âWell, how are people like ourselves going to
feel any difference in what you call social conditions?â

Doggie lit another cigarette, chiefly in order to
gain time for thought; but an odd instinct made
him secure the matchbox before he picked out the
cigarette. Superficially, Peggyâs proposition was incontrovertible.
Unless there happened some social
cataclysm, involving a newly democratized world in
ghastly chaos, which after all was a remote possibility,
the externals of gentle life would undergo very slight
modification. Yet there was something fundamentally
wrong in Peggyâs conception of post-war existence.
Something wrong in essentials. Now, a critical attitude
towards Peggy, whose presence was a proof of
her splendid loyalty, seemed hateful. But there was
something wrong all the same. Something wrong in
Peggy herself that put her into opposition. In one
aspect, she was the pre-war Peggy, with her cut-and-dried
little social ambitions and her definite projects
of attainment; but in another she was not. The
pre-war Peggy had swiftly turned into the patriotic
English girl who had hounded him into the army.
He found himself face to face with an amorphous,
characterless sort of Peggy whom he did not know.
It was perplexing, baffling. Before he could formulate
an idea, she went on:

Â
âYou silly old thing, what change is there likely
to be? What change is there now, after all?
Thereâs a scarcity of men. Naturally. Theyâre out
fighting. But when they come home on leave, life
goes on just the same as beforeâtennis parties, little
dances, dinners. Of course, lots of people are hard
hit. Did I tell you that Jack Paunceby was killedâthe
only son? The warâs awful and dreadful, I
knowâbut if we donât go through with it cheerfully,
whatâs the good of us?â

âI think Iâm pretty cheerful,â said Doggie.

âOh, youâre not grousing and youâre making the
best of it. Youâre perfectly splendid. But youâre
philosophizing such a lot over it. The only thing
before us is to do in Germany, Prussian militarism,
and so on, and then thereâll be peace, and weâll all
be happy again.â

âHave you met many men who say that?â he
asked.

âHeaps. Oliver was only talking about it the
other day.â

âOliver?â

At his quick challenge he could not help noticing
a little cloud, as of vexation, pass over her face.

âYes, Oliver,â she replied, with an unnecessary
air of defiance. âHe has been over here on short
leave. Went back a fortnight ago. Heâs as cheerful
as cheerful can be. Jollier than ever he was. I took
him out in the dear old two-seater and he insisted on
driving to show how they drove at the Frontâand
itâs only because the Almighty must have kept a special
eye on a Deanâs daughter that Iâm here to tell the
tale.â

âYou saw a lot of him, I suppose?â said Doggie.

A flush rose on Peggyâs cheek. âOf course. He

Â
was staying at the Deanery most of his time. I wrote
to you about it. Iâve made a point of telling you
everything. I even told you about the two-seater.â

âSo you did,â said Doggie. âI remember.â He
smiled. âYour description made me laugh. Oliverâs
a major now, isnât he?â

âYes. And just before he got his majority they
gave him the Military Cross.â

âHe must be an awful swell,â said Doggie.

She replied with some heat. âHe hasnât changed
the least little bit in the world.â

Doggie shook his head. âNo one can go through
it, really go through it, and come back the same.â

âYou donât insinuate that Oliver hasnât really gone
through it?â

âOf course not, Peggy dear. They donât throw
M.C.âs about like Iron Crosses. In order to get it
Oliver must have looked into the jaws of hell. They
all do. But no man is the same afterwards. Oliver
has what the French call
panache
âââ

âWhatâs
panache
?â

âThe real heroic swaggerâsomething spiritual
about it. Oliverâs not going to let you notice the
change in him.â

âWe went to the Alhambra, and he laughed as
if such a thing as war had never been heard of.â

âNaturally,â said Doggie. âAll thatâs part of
the
panache
.â

âYouâre talking through your hat, Marmaduke,â
she exclaimed with some irritation. âOliverâs a
straight, clean, English soldier.â

âIâve been doing my best to tell you so,â said
Doggie.

âBut you seem to be criticizing him because heâs
concealing something behind what you call his
panache
.â

Â
âNot criticizing, dear. Only stating. I think Iâm
more Oliverian than you.â

âIâm not Oliverian,â cried Peggy, with burning
cheeks. âAnd I donât see why we should discuss
him like this. All I said was that Oliver, who has
made himself a distinguished man and will be even
more distinguished, and, at any rate, knows what
heâs talking about, doesnât worry his head with social
reconstruction and all that sort of rot. Iâve come
here to talk about you, not about Oliver. Let us
leave him out of the question.â

âWillingly,â said Doggie. âI never had any
reason to love Oliver; but I must do him justice.
I only wanted to show you that he must be a bigger
man than you imagine.â

âIâm glad to hear you say so,â cried Peggy, with
a flash of the eyes. âI hope itâs true.â

âThe warâs such a whacking big thing, you see,â
he said with a conciliatory smile. âNo one can
prophesy exactly whatâs going to come out of it.
But the whole of human society â¦ the world, the
whole of civilization, is being stirred up like a Christmas
pudding. The warâs bound to change the trend of
all human thought. There must be an entire rearrangement
of social values.â

âIâm sorry; but I donât see it,â said Peggy.

Doggie again wrinkled his brow and looked at her,
and she returned his glance stonily.

âYou think Iâm mulish.â

She had interpreted Doggieâs thought, but he raised
a hand in protest.

âNo, no.â

âYes, yes. Every man looks at a woman like
that when he thinks her a mule or an idiot. We
get to learn it in our cradles. But in spite of your

Â
superior wisdom, I know Iâm right. After the war
there wonât be a bit of change, really. A duke will
be a duke, and a costermonger a costermonger.â

âThese are extreme cases. The duke may remain
a duke, but he wonât be such a little tin god on wheels.
Heâll find himself in the position of a democratic
country gentleman. And the costermonger will rise
to the political position of an important tradesman.
But between the two thereâll be any old sort of
flux.â

âDid you learn all this horrible, rank socialism
in France?â

âPerhaps, but it seems so obvious.â

âItâs only because youâve been living among
Tommies, whoâve got these stupid ideas into their
heads. If you had been living among your social
equalsâââ

âIn Durdlebury?â

She flashed rebellion. âYes. In Durdlebury.
Why not?â

âIâm afraid, Peggy dear,â he said, with his patient,
pleasant smile, âyou are rather sheltered from the
war in Durdlebury.â

She cried out indignantly.

âIndeed weâre not. The newspapers come to
Durdlebury, donât they? And everybodyâs doing
something. We have the war all around us. Weâve
even succeeded in getting wounded soldiers in the
Cottage Hospital. Nancy Murdoch is a V.A.D. and
scrubs floors. Cissy James is driving a Y.M.C.A.
motor-car in Calais. Jane Brown-Gore is nursing
in Salonika. We read all their letters. Personally,
I canât do much, because mother has crocked up and
Iâve got to run the Deanery. But Iâm slaving from
morning to night. Only last week I got up a concert

Â
for the wounded. Alone I did itâand it takes some
doing in Durdlebury, now that youâre away and the
Musical Association has perished of inanition. Old
Dr. Flintâs no earthly good, since Tom, the eldest
sonâyou rememberâwas killed in Mesopotamia. So
I did it all, and it was a great success. We netted
four hundred and seventy pounds. And whenever I
can get a chance, I go round the hospital and talk
and read to the men and write their letters, and hear
of everything. I donât think youâve any right to
say weâre out of touch with the war. In a sort of
way, I know as much about it as you do.â

Doggie in some perplexity scratched his head, a
thing which he would never have done at Durdlebury.
With humorous intent he asked:

âDo you know as much as Oliver?â

âOliverâs a field officer,â she replied tartly, and
Doggie felt snubbed. âBut Iâm sure he agrees with
everything I say.â She paused and, in a different
tone, went on: âDonât you think itâs rather rotten
to have this piffling argument when Iâve come all
this long way to see you?â

âForgive me, Peggy,â he said penitently; âI
appreciate your coming more than I can say.â

She was not appeased. âAnd yet you donât give
me credit for playing the game.â

âWhat game?â he asked with a smile.

âSurely you ought to know.â

He reached out his hand and took hers. âAm I
worth it, Peggy?â

Her lips twitched and tears stood in her eyes.

âI donât know what you mean?â

âNeither do I quite,â he replied simply. âBut
it seems that Iâm a Tommy through and through,
and that Iâll never get Tommy out of my soul.â

Â
âThatâs nothing to be ashamed of,â she declared
stoutly.

âOf course not. But it makes one see all sorts
of things in a different light.â

âOh, donât worry your head about that,â she said,
with pathetic misunderstanding. âWeâll put you all
right as soon as we get you back to Durdlebury. I
suppose you wonât refuse to come this time.â

âYes, Iâll come this time,â said Doggie.

So he promised, and the talk drifted on to casual
lines. She gave him the mild chronicle of the sleepy
town, described plays which she had seen on her
rare visits to London, sketched out a programme for
his all too short visit to the Deanery.

âAnd in the meanwhile,â she remarked, âtry to
get these morbid ideas out of your silly old head.â

Time came for parting. She rose and shook hands.

âDonât think Iâve said anything in depreciation of
Tommies. I understand them thoroughly. Theyâre
wonderful fellows. Good-bye, old boy. Get well
soon.â

She kissed her hand to him at the door, and was
gone.

It was now that Doggie began to hate himself.
For all the time that Peggy had been running on,
eager to convince him that his imputation of aloofness
from the war was undeserved, the voice of one who,
knowing its splendours and its terrors, had pierced to
the heart of its mysteries, ran in his ears.

â
Leur gaietÃ© fait peur.
â

Â

CHAPTER XIX

The
X-rays showed the tiniest splinter of bone
in Doggieâs thigh. The surgeon fished it up
and the clean wound healed rapidly. The gloomy
Penworthyâs prognostication had not come true.
Doggie would not stump about at ease on a wooden
leg; but in all probability would soon find himself
back in the firing lineâa prospect which brought
great cheer to Penworthy. Also to Doggie. For,
in spite of the charm of the pretty hospital, the health-giving
sea air, the long rest for body and nerves, life
seemed flat and unprofitable.

He had written a gay, irreproachable letter to
Jeanne, to which Jeanne, doubtless thinking it the
last word of the episode, had not replied. Loyalty
to Peggy forbade further thought of Jeanne. He
must henceforward think of Peggy and her sturdy
faithfulness as hard as he could. But the more he
thought, the more remote did Peggy seem. Of course
the publicity of the interview had invested it with a
certain constraint, knocked out of it any approach
to sentimentality or romance. They had not even
kissed. They had spent most of the time arguing
from different points of view. They had been near
to quarrelling. It was outrageous of him to criticize
her; yet how could he help it? The mere fact of
striving to exalt her was a criticism.

Indeed they were far apart. Into the sensitive
soul of Doggie the war in all its meaning had paused.

Â
The soul of Peggy had remained untouched. To her,
in her sheltered corner of England, it was a ghastly
accident, like a railway collision blocking the traffic
on her favourite line. For the men of her own class
who took part in it, it was a brave adventure; for
the common soldier a sad but patriotic necessity. If
circumstances had allowed her to go forth into the
war-world as nurse or canteen helper at a London
terminus, or motor driver in France, her horizon would
have broadened. But the contact with realities into
which her dilettante little war activities brought her
was too slight to make the deep impression. In her
heart, as far as she revealed herself to Doggie, she
resented the war because it interfered with her own
definitely marked out scheme of existence. The war
over, she would regard it politely as a thing that had
never been, and would forthwith set to work upon
her aforesaid interrupted plan. And towards a comprehension
of this apparent serenity the perplexed
mind of Doggie groped with ill-success. All his old
values had been kicked into higgledy-piggledy confusion.
All hers remained steadfast.

So Doggie reflected with some grimness that there
are rougher roads than those which lead to the trenches.

A letter from Phineas did not restore equanimity.
It ran:

âMy dear Laddie,â

âOur unsophisticated friend, Mo, and myself
are writing this letter together and he bids me begin
it by saying that he hopes it finds you as it leaves us
at present, in a muck of dust and perspiration. Where
we are now I must not tell, for (in the opinion of the
Censor) you would reveal it to the very Reverend
the Dean of Durdlebury, who would naturally telegraph

Â
the information to the Kaiser. But the Division
is far, far from the idyllic land of your dreams, and
there is bloody fighting ahead of us. And though
the hearts of Mo and me go out to you, laddie, and
though we miss you sore, yet Mo says heâs blistering
glad youâre out of it and safe in your perishing bed
with a Blighty one. And such, in more academic
phraseology, are the sentiments of your old friend
Phineas.

âAh, laddie! it was a bad day when we marched
from the old billets; for the word had gone round
that we werenât going back. I had taken the liberty
of telling the lassie ye ken of something about your
private position and your worldly affairs, of which it
seems you had left her entirely ignorant. Of course,
with my native Scottish caution, and my knowledge
of human nature gained in the academies of prosperity
and the ragged schools of adversity, I did not touch
on certain matters of a delicate nature. That is no
business of mine. If there is discretion in this world
in which you can trust blindly, it is that of Phineas
McPhail. I just told her of Denby Hall and your
fortune, which I fairly accurately computed at a
couple of million francs. For I thought it was right
she should know that you werenât just a scallywag
private soldier like the rest of us. And I am bound
to say that the lassie was considerably impressed. In
further conversation I told her something of your
early life, and, though not over desirous of blackening
my character in her bonnie eyes, I let her know what
kind of an injudicious upbringing you had been compelled
to undergo. â
Il a Ã©tÃ© Ã©levÃ©
,â said I, â
dans
âââ
What the blazes was the French for cotton-wool?
The war has a pernicious effect on oneâs memoryâI
sometimes even forget the elementary sensations of

Â
inebriety. â
Dans la ouate
,â she said. And I remembered
the word. â
Oui, dans la ouate
,â said I.
And she looked at me, laddie, or, rather, through me,
out of her great dark eyesâyou mind the way she
treats your substance as a shadow and looks through
it at the shadows that to her are substancesâand
she said below her breathâI donât think she meant
me to hear itââ
Et câest lui qui a fait cela pour
moi
.â

âMo, in his materialistic way, is clamorous that
I should tell you about the chicken; the which,
being symbolical, I proceed to do. It was our last
day. She invited us to lunch in the kitchen and shut
the door so that none of the hungry varlets of the
company should stick in their unmannerly noses and
whine for scraps. And there, laddie, was an omelette
and cutlets and a chicken and a
fromage Ã Â la crÃªme

such as in the days of my vanity I have never eaten,
cooked by the old body whose soul you won with a
pinch of snuff. The poor lassie could scarcely eat;
but Mo saw that there was nothing left. The bones
on his plate looked as if a dog had been at them for
a week. And there was vintage Haut Sauterne which
ran down oneâs throat like scented gold. âMan,â
said I to Mo, âif you lap it up like that youâll be as
drunk as Noah.â So he cast a frightened glance at
mademoiselle and sipped like a young lady at a christening
party. Then she brings out cherries and plums
and peaches and opens a half-bottle of champagne
and fills all our glasses, and Toinette had a glass; and
she rises in the pale, dignified, Greek tragedy way she
has, and she makes a wee bit speech. â
Messieurs
,â
she said, âperhaps you may wonder why I have invited
you. But I think you understand. It is the only
way I had of sharing with Doggieâs friends the fortune

Â
that he had so heroically brought me. It is but a little
tribute of my gratitude to Doggie. You are his friends
and I wish well that you would be mineâ
trÃ¨s franchement,
trÃ¨s loyalement
.â She put out her hand and we
shook it. And old Mo said, âMiss, Iâd go to hell
for you!â Whereupon the little red spot you may
have seen for yourself, came into her pale cheek,
and a soft look like a flitting moonbeam crept into
her eyes. Laddie, if Iâm waxing too poetical, just
consider that Mademoiselle Jeanne BossiÃ¨re is not the
ordinary woman the British private soldier is in the
habit of consorting with. Then she took up her
glass. â
Je vais porter un toastâVive lâAngleterre!
â
And although a Scotsman, I drank it as if it applied
to me. And then she cried, â
Vive la France!
â And
old Toinette cried, â
Vive la France!
â

âAnd they looked transfigured, and I fairly itched
to sing the Marseillaise, though I knew I couldnât.
Then she chinked glasses with us.

ââ
Bonne chance, mes amis!
â

âAnd then she made a sign to the auld wife, who
added the few remaining drops to our glasses. âTo
Doggie!â said mademoiselle. We drank the toast,
laddie. Old Mo began in his cracked voice, âFor
heâs a jolly good fellow.â I kicked him and told him
to shut up. But mademoiselle said:

ââIâve heard of that. It is a ceremony. I like
it. Continue.â

âSo Mo and I held up our glasses and, in indifferent
song, proclaimed you what the Army, developing
certain rudimentary germs, has made you, and mademoiselle
too held up her glass and threw back her head
and joined us in the hip, hip, hoorays. It would
have done your heart good, laddie, to have been there
to see. But we did you proud.

Â
âWhen we emerged from the festival, the prettiest
which, in the course of a variegated career, I have
ever attended, Mo says:

ââIf I hadnât a gel at homeâââ

ââIf you hadnât got a girl at home,â said I, âyouâd
be the next damnedest fool in the army to Phineas
McPhail!â

âWe marched out just before dusk, and there she
was by the front door; and though she stood proud
and upright, and smiled with her lips and blew us
kisses with both hands, to which the boys all responded
with a cheer, there were tears streaming down her
cheeksâand the tears, laddie, were not for Mo, or
me, or any one of us ugly beggars that passed her by.

âI also have good news for you, in that I hear
from the thunderous, though excellent, Sergeant
Ballinghall, there is a probability that when you rejoin,
the C.O. will be afflicted with a grievous lapse of
memory and that he will be persuaded that you
received your wound during the attack on the wiring
party.

âAs I said before, laddie, weâre all like the Scots
whaâ hae wiâ Wallace bled and are going to our gory
bed or to victory. Possibly both. But I will remain
steadfast to my philosophy, and if I am condemned to
the said sanguinolent couch, I will do my best to derive
from it the utmost enjoyment possible. All kinds of
poets and such-like lusty loons have shed their last
drop of ink in the effort to describe the pleasures of
lifeâbut it will be reserved for the disembodied spirit
of Phineas McPhail to write the great Philosophic
poem of the worldâs history, which will be entitled
âThe Pleasures of Death.â While youâre doing
nothing, laddie, you might bestir yourself and find
an enlightened publisher who would be willing to

Â
give me an ante-mortem advance, in respect of royalties
accruing to my ghost.

âMo, to whom I have read the last paragraph, says
he always knew that eddication affected the brain.
With which incontrovertible proposition and our joint
love, I now conclude this epistle.

âYours,
Phineas
.â

âOf all the blazing imbeciles!â Doggie cried
aloud. Why the unprintable unprintableness couldnât
Phineas mind his own business? Why had he given
his silly accident of fortune away in this childish
manner? Why had he told Jeanne of his cotton-wool
upbringing? His feet, even that of his wounded
leg, tingled to kick Phineas. Of course Jeanne,
knowing him now to be such a gilded ass, would have
nothing more to do with him. It explained her letter.
He damned Phineas to all eternity, in terms compared
with which the curse of Saint Ernulphus enunciated
by the late Mr. Shandy was a fantastic benediction.
âIf I had a dog,â quoth my Uncle Toby, âI would
not curse him so.â But if Uncle Toby had heard
Doggie of the Twentieth Century Armies who also
swore terribly in Flanders, for dog he would have
substituted rattlesnake or German officer.

Yet such is the quiddity of the English Tommy,
that through this devastating anathema ran a streak
of love which at the end turned the whole thing into
forlorn derision. And as soon as he could laugh, he
saw things in a clear light. Both of his two friends
were, in their respective ways, in love with his wonderful
Jeanne. Both of them were steel-true to him.
It was just part of their loyalty to foment this impossible
romance between Jeanne and himself. If the three
of them were now at FrÃ©lus, the two idiots would

Â
be playing gooseberry with the smirking conscientiousness
of a pair of schoolgirls. So Doggie forgave the
indiscretion. After all, what did it matter?

It mattered, however, to this extent, that he read
the letter over and over again until he knew it by
heart and could picture to himself every phase of the
banquet and every fleeting look on Jeanneâs face.

âAll this,â he declared at last, âis utterly ridiculous.â
And he tore up Phineasâs letter and, during
his convalescence, devoted himself to the study of
European politics, a subject which he had scandalously
neglected during his elegantly leisured youth.

The day of his discharge came in due course. A
suit of khaki took the place of the hospital blue. He
received his papers, the seven daysâ sick furlough and
his railway warrant, shook hands with nurses and
comrades and sped to Durdlebury in the third-class
carriage of the Tommy.

Peggy, in the two-seater, was waiting for him in
the station yard. He exchanged greetings from afar,
grinned, waved a hand and jumped in beside her.

âHow jolly of you to meet me!â

âWhereâs your luggage?â

âLuggage?â

It seemed to be a new word. He had not heard it
for many months. He laughed.

âHavenât got any, thank God! If you knew
what it was to hunch a horrible canvas sausage of
kit about, youâd appreciate feeling free.â

âItâs a mercy youâve got Peddle,â said Peggy.
âHe has been at the Deanery fixing things up for
you for the last two days.â

âI wonder if I shall be able to live up to Peddle,â
said Doggie.

Â
âWhoâs going to start the car?â she asked.

âOh, lord!â he cried, and bolted out and turned
the crank. âIâm awfully sorry,â he added, when,
the engine running, he resumed his place. âI had
forgotten all about these pretty things. Out there a
car is a sacred chariot set apart for gods in brass hats,
and the ordinary Tommy looks on them with awe
and reverence.â

âCanât you forget youâre a Tommy for a few
days?â she said, as soon as the car had cleared the
station gates and was safely under way.

He noted a touch of irritation. âAll right, Peggy
dear,â said he. âIâll do what I can.â

âOliverâs here, with his man Chipmunk,â she
remarked, her eyes on the road.

âOliver? On leave again? How has he managed
it?â

âYouâd better ask him,â she replied tartly. âAll
I know is that he turned up yesterday, and heâs staying
with us. Thatâs why I donât want you to ram
the fact of your being a Tommy down everybodyâs
throat.â

He laughed at the queer little social problem that
seemed to be worrying her. âI think youâll find
blood is thicker than military etiquette. After all,
Oliverâs my first cousin. If he canât get on with
me, he can get out.â To change the conversation,
he added after a pause: âThe little carâs running
splendidly.â

They swept through the familiar old-world streets,
which, now that the early frenzy of mobilizing Territorials
and training of new armies was over, had
resumed more or less their pre-war appearance. The
sleepy meadows by the river, once ground into black
slush by guns and ammunition waggons and horses,

Â
were now green again and idle, and the troops once
billeted on the citizens had marched heaven knows
whitherâmany to heaven itselfâor whatever Paradise
is reserved for the great-hearted English fighting man
who has given his life for England. Only here and
there a stray soldier on leave, or one of the convalescents
from the cottage hospital, struck an incongruous note
of war. They drew up at the door of the Deanery
under the shadow of the great cathedral.

âThank God that is out of reach of the Boche,â
said Doggie, regarding it with a new sense of its
beauty and spiritual significance. âTo think of it
like Rheims or ArrasâIâve seen Arrasâseen a shell
burst among the still standing ruins. Oh, Peggyââhe
gripped her armââyou dear people havenât the
remotest conception of what it all isâwhat France
has suffered. Imagine this mass of wonder all one
horrible stone pie, without a trace of what it once
had been.â

âI suppose weâre jolly lucky,â she replied.

The door was opened by the old butler, who had
been on the alert for the arrival.

âYou run in,â said Peggy, âIâll take the car round
to the yard.â

So Doggie, with a smile and a word of greeting,
entered the Deanery. His uncle appeared in the hall,
florid, white-haired, benevolent, and extended both
hands to the home-come warrior.

âMy dear boy, how glad I am to see you. Welcome
back. And howâs the wound? Weâve thought
night and day of you. If I could have spared the
time, I should have run up north, but Iâve not a
minute to call my own. Weâre doing our share of
war work here, my boy. Come into the drawing-room.â

Â
He put his hand affectionately on Doggieâs arm and,
opening the drawing-room door, pushed him in and
stood, in his kind, courtly way, until the young man
had passed the threshold. Mrs. Conover, feeble from
illness, rose and kissed him, and gave him much the
same greeting as her husband. Then a tall, lean
figure in uniform, who had remained in the background
by the fireplace, advanced with outstretched hand.

âHello, old chap!â

Doggie took the hand in an honest grip.

âHello, Oliver!â

âHow goes it?â

âSplendid,â said Doggie. âYou all right?â

âTop-hole,â said Oliver. He clapped his cousin
on the shoulder. âMy hat! you do look fit.â He
turned to the Dean. âUncle Edward, isnât he a
hundred times the man he was?â

âI told you, my boy, you would see a difference,â
said the Dean.

Peggy ran in, having delivered the two-seater to
the care of myrmidons.

âNow that the affecting meeting is over, let us
have tea. Oliver, ring the bell.â

The tea came. It appeared to Doggie, handing
round the three-tiered silver cake-stand, that he had
returned to some forgotten former incarnation. The
delicate china cup in his hand seemed too frail for the
material usages of life and he feared lest he should
break it with rough handling. Old habit, however,
prevailed, and no one noticed his sense of awkwardness.
The talk lay chiefly between Oliver and himself.
They exchanged experiences as to dates and localities.
They bandied about the names of places which will
be inscribed in letters of blood in history for all time,
as though they were popular golf-courses. Both had

Â
known Ypres and Plug Street, and the famous wall
at Arras, where the British and German trenches
were but five yards apart. Oliverâs division had gone
down to the Somme in July for the great push.

âI ought to be there now,â said Oliver. âI feel
a hulking slacker and fraud, being home on sick leave.
But the M.O. said I had just escaped shell-shock by
the skin of my nerves, and they packed me home for
a fortnight to rest upâwhile the regiment, what thereâs
left of it, went into reserve.â

âDid you get badly cut up?â asked Doggie.

âRather. We broke through all right. Then
machine guns which we had overlooked got us in
the back.â

âMy lotâs down there now,â said Doggie.

âYouâre well out of it, old chap,â laughed Oliver.

For the first time in his life Doggie began really to
like Oliver. The old-time swashbuckling swagger
had goneâthe swagger of one who would say: âI
am the only live man in this comatose crowd. I
am the dare-devil buccaneer who defies the thunder
and sleeps on boards while the rest of you are lying
soft in feather-beds.â His direct, cavalier way he
still retained; but the army, with the omnipotent
might of its inherited traditions, had moulded him
to its pattern; even as it had moulded Doggie. And
Doggie, who had learned many of the lessons in human
psychology which the army teaches, knew that Oliverâs
genial, familiar talk was not all due to his appreciation
of their social equality in the bosom of their own
family, but that he would have treated much the
same any Tommy into whose companionship he had
been casually thrown. The Tommy would have
said âsirâ very scrupulously, which on Doggieâs part
would have been an idiotic thing to do; but they

Â
would have got on famously together, bound by the
freemasonry of fighting men who had cursed the same
foe for the same reasons. So Oliver stood out before
Doggieâs eyes in a new light, that of the typical officer
trusted and beloved by his men, and his heart went
out to him.

âIâve brought Chipmunk over,â said Oliver.
âYou remember the freak? The poor devil hasnât
had a dayâs leave for a couple of years. Didnât want
it. Why should he go and waste money in a country
where he didnât know a human being? But this
time Iâve fixed it up for him and his leave is coterminous
with mine. He has been my servant all
through. If they took him away from me, heâd be
quite capable of strangling the C.O. Heâs a funny
beggar.â

âAnd what kind of a soldier?â the Dean asked
politely.

âThereâs not a finer one in all the armies of the
earth,â said Oliver.

After much further talk the dressing-gong boomed
softly through the house.

âYouâve got the green room, Marmaduke,â said
Peggy. âThe one with the Chippendale stuff you
used to covet so much.â

âI havenât got much to change into,â laughed
Doggie.

âYouâll find Peddle up there waiting for you,â
she replied.

And when Doggie entered the green room there
he found Peddle, who welcomed him with tears of
joy and a display of all the finikin luxuries of the toilet
and adornment which he had left behind at Denby
Hall. There were pots of pomade and face-cream,
and nail-polish; bottles of hair-wash and tooth-wash;

Â
little boxes and brushes for the moustache, half a dozen
gleaming razors, an array of brushes and combs and
manicure-set in tortoise-shell with his crest in silver,
bottles of scent with spray attachments; the onyx
bowl of bath salts beside the hip-bath ready to be filled
from the ewers of hot and cold waterâthe Deanery,
old-fashioned house, had but one family bath-room;
the deep purple silk dressing-gown over the foot-rail
of the bed, the silk pyjamas in a lighter shade spread
out over the pillow, the silk underwear and soft-fronted
shirt fitted with his ruby and diamond sleeve-links,
hung up before the fire to air; the dinner jacket suit
laid out on the glass-topped Chippendale table, with
black tie and delicate handkerchief; the silk socks
carefully tucked inside out, the glossy pumps with
the silver shoe-horn laid across them.

âMy God! Peddle,â cried Doggie, scratching his
closely cropped head. âWhat the devilâs all this?â

Peddle, grey, bent, uncomprehending, regarded him
blankly.

âAll what, sir?â

âI only want to wash my hands,â said Doggie.

âBut arenât you going to dress for dinner, sir?â

âA private soldierâs not allowed to wear mufti,
Peddle. Theyâd dock me of a weekâs pay if they
found out.â

âWhoâs to find out, sir?â

âThereâs Mr. Oliverâheâs a Major.â

âLord, Mr. Marmaduke, I donât think heâd mind.
Miss Peggy gave me my orders, sir, and I think you
can leave things to her.â

âAll right, Peddle,â he laughed. âIf itâs Miss
Peggyâs decree, Iâll change. Iâve got all I want.â

âAre you sure you can manage, sir?â Peddle
asked anxiously, for time was when Doggie couldnât

Â
stick his legs into his trousers unless Peddle held them
out for him.

âQuite,â said Doggie.

âIt seems rather roughing it here, Mr. Marmaduke,
after what youâve been accustomed to at the Hall.â

âThatâs so,â said Doggie. âAnd itâs martyrdom
compared with what it is in the trenches. There we
always have a major-general to lace up our boots, and
a field-marshalâs always hovering round to light our
cigarettes.â

Peddle, who had never known him to jest, or his
father before him, went out in a muddled frame of
mind, leaving Doggie to struggle into his dress trousers
as best he might.

Â

CHAPTER XX

When
Doggie, in dinner suit, went downstairs,
he found Peggy alone in the drawing-room.
She gave him the kiss of one accustomed to
kiss him from childhood, and sat down again on the
fender-stool.

âNow you look more like a Christian gentleman,â
she laughed. âConfess. Itâs much more comfortable
than your wretched privateâs uniform.â

âIâm not quite so sure,â he said, somewhat ruefully,
indicating his dinner jacket tightly constricted beneath
the arms. âAlready Iâve had to slit my waistcoat
down the back. Poor old Peddle will have an apoplectic
fit when he sees it. Iâve grown a bit since
these elegant rags were made for me.â

â
Il faut souffrir pour Ãªtre beau
,â said Peggy.

âIf my being
beau
pleases you, Peggy, Iâll suffer
gladly. Iâve been in tighter places.â He threw
himself down in the corner of the sofa and joggled
up and down like a child. âAfter all,â he said,
âitâs jolly to sit on something squashy again, and to
see a pretty girl in a pretty frock.â

âIâm glad you like this frock.â

âNew?â

She nodded. âDad said it was too much of a
Vanity Fair of a vanity for war-time. You donât
think so, do you?â

âItâs charming,â said Doggie. âA treat for tired
eyes.â

Â
âThatâs just what I told dad. Whatâs the good
of women dressing in sacks tied round the middle with
a bit of string? When men come home from the
Front they want to see their womenfolk looking pretty
and dainty. Thatâs what theyâve come over for.
Itâs part of the cure. Itâs the first time youâve been
a real dear, Marmaduke. âA treat for tired eyes.â
Iâll rub it into dad hard.â

Oliver came inâin khaki. Doggie jumped up
and pointed to him.

âLook here, Peggy. Itâs the guard-room for me.â

Oliver laughed. âWhere the dinner kit I bought
when I came home is now, God only can tell.â He
turned to Peggy. âI did change, you know.â

âThatâs the pull of being a beastly Major,â said
Doggie. âThey have heaps of suits. On the march,
there are motor-lorries full of them. Itâs the scandal
of the army. The wretched Tommy has but one
suit to his name. Thatâs why, sir, Iâve taken the
liberty of appearing before you in outgrown mufti.â

âAll right, my man,â said Oliver. âWeâll hush
it up and say no more about it.â

Then the Dean and Mrs. Conover entered and
soon they went in to dinner. It was for Doggie the
most pleasant of meals. He had the superbly
healthy manâs whole-hearted or whole-stomached
appreciation of unaccustomed good food and drink:
so much so, that when the Dean, after agonies of
thwarted mastication, said gently to his wife: âMy
dear, donât you think you might speak a word in
season to PeckââPeck being the butcherââand
forbid him, under the Defence of the Realm Act, if
you like, to deliver to us in the evening as lamb that
which was in the morning a lusty sheep?â he stared
at the good old man as though he were Vitellius in

Â
person. Tough? It was like milk-fatted baby. He
was already devouring, like Oliver, his second helping.
Then the Dean, pledging him and Oliver in
champagne, apologized: âIâm sorry, my dear boys,
the 1904 has run out and thereâs no more to be got.
But the 1906, though not having the quality, is
quite drinkable.â

Drinkable! It was laughing, dancing joy that
went down his throat.

So much for gross delights. There were othersâfiner.
The charm to the eye of the table with its
exquisite napery and china and glass and silver and
flowers. The almost intoxicating atmosphere of peace
and gentle living. The full, loving welcome shining
from the eyes of the kind old Dean, his uncle by
marriage, and of the faded, delicate lady, his own flesh
and blood, his motherâs sister. And Peggy, pretty,
flushed, bright-eyed, radiant in her new dress. And
there was Oliverâ¦.

Most of all he appreciated Oliverâs comrade-like
attitude. It was a recognition of him as a man and
a soldier. In the course of dinner talk Oliver said:

âJ.M.T. and I have looked Death in the face many
a timeâand really heâs a poor raw-head and bloody-bones
sort of Bogey; donât you think so, old chap?â

âIt all depends on whether youâve got a funk-hole
handy,â he replied.

But that was mere lightness of speech. Oliverâs
inclusion of him in his remark shook him to the depths
of his sensitive nature. The man who despises the
petty feelings and frailties of mankind is doomed to
remain in awful ignorance of that which there is of
beauty and pathos in the lives of his fellow-creatures.
After all, what did it matter what Oliver thought of
him? Who was Oliver? His cousinâaccident of

Â
birthâthe black sheep of the family; now a major
in a different regiment and a different division. What
was Oliver to him or he to Oliver? He had âmade
goodâ in the eyes of one whose judgment had been
forged keen and absolute by heroic sorrows. What
did anyone else matter? But to Doggie the supreme
joy of the evening was the knowledge that he had
made good in the eyes of Oliver. Oliver wore on
his tunic the white mauve and white ribbon of the
Military Cross. Honour where honour was due.
But he, Doggie, had been wounded (no matter how)
and Oliver frankly put them both on the same plane
of achievement, thus wiping away, with generous hand,
all hated memories of the past.

When the ladies had left the room, history repeated
itself, in that the Dean was called away on business
and the cousins were left alone together over their
wine. Said Doggie:

âDo you remember the last time we sat at this
table?â

âPerfectly,â replied Oliver, holding up a glass of
the old Deanery port to the light. âYou were
horrified at my attempting to clean out my pipe with
a dessert knife.â

Doggie laughed. âAfter all, it was a filthy thing
to do.â

âI quite agree with you. Since then Iâve learned
manners.â

âYou also made me squirm at the idea of scooping
out Bochesâ insides with bayonets.â

âAnd youâve learned not to squirm, so weâre quits.â

âYou thought me a rotten ass in those days, didnât
you?â

Oliver looked at him squarely.

âI donât think it would hurt you now if I said

Â
that I did.â He laughed, stretched himself on his
chair, thrusting both hands into his trouser pockets.
âIn many ways, itâs a jolly good old war, you knowâfor
those that pull through. It has taught us both
a lot, Marmaduke.â

Doggie wrinkled his forehead in his half-humorous
way.

âI wish it would teach people not to call me by
that silly name.â

âI have always abominated it, as you may have
observed,â said Oliver. âBut in our present polite
relations, old chap, what else is there?â

âYou ought to knowâââ

Oliver stared at him. âYou donât meanââ?â

âYes, I do.â

âBut you used to loathe it and I went on calling
you âDoggieâ because I knew you loathed it. I
never dreamed of using it now.â

âI canât help it,â replied Doggie. âThe name
got into the army and has stuck to me right through,
and now those I love and trust most in the world,
and who love and trust me, call me âDoggie,â and I
donât seem to be able to answer to any other name.
So, although Iâm only a Tommy and youâre a devil
of a swell of a second-in-command, yet if you want to
be friendlyâwellâââ

Oliver leaned forward quickly. âOf course I
want to be friends, Doggie, old chap. As for major
and privateâwhen you pass me in the street youâve
dam well got to salute me, and thatâs all there is to
itâbut otherwise itâs all rot. And now weâve got
to the heart-to-heart stage, donât you think youâre a
bit of a fool?â

âI know it,â said Doggie cheerfully. âThe army
has drummed that into me, at any rate.â

Â
âI mean in staying in the ranks. Why donât
you apply for the Cadet Corps and so get through to
a commission again?â

Doggieâs brow grew dark. âI had all that out
with Peggy long agoâwhen things were perhaps
somewhat different with me. I was sore all over.
I dare say you can understand. But now there are
other reasons, much stronger reasons. The only
real happiness Iâve had in my life has been as a Tommy.
Iâm not talking through my hat. The only real
friends Iâve ever made in my life are Tommies. Iâve
found real things as a Tommy and Iâm not going to
start all over again to find them in another capacity.â

âYou wouldnât have to start all over again,â
Oliver objected.

âOh yes, I should. Donât run away with the idea
that Iâve been turned by a miracle into a brawny
hero. Iâm not anything of the sort. To have to
lead men into action would be a holy terror. The old
dread of seeking new paths still acts, you see. Iâm
the same Doggie that wouldnât go out to Huaheine
with you. Only now Iâm a private and Iâm used to
it. I love it and Iâm not going to change to the end
of the whole gory business. Of course Peggy doesnât
like it,â he added after a sip of wine. âBut I canât
help that. Itâs a matter of temperament and conscienceâin
a way, a matter of honour.â

âWhat has honour got to do with it?â asked Oliver.

âIâll try to explain. Itâs somehow this way.
When I came to my senses after being chucked for
incompetenceâthat was the worst hell I ever went
through in my lifeâand I enlisted, I swore that I
would stick it as a Tommy without anybodyâs sympathy,
least of all that of the folks here. And then
I swore Iâd make good to myself as a Tommy. I

Â
was just beginning to feel happier when that infernal
Boche sniper knocked me out for a time. So, Peggy
or no Peggy, Iâm going through with it. I suppose
Iâm telling you all this because I should like you to
know.â

He passed his hand, in the familiar gesture, from back
to front of his short-cropped hair. Oliver smiled
at the reminiscence of the old disturbed Doggie;
but he said very gravely:

âIâm glad youâve told me, old man. I appreciate
it very much. Iâve been through the ranks myself
and know what it isâthe bad and the good. Many a
man has found his soul that wayâââ

âGood God!â cried Doggie, starting to his feet.
âDo you say that too?â

âWho else said it?â

The quick question caused the blood to rush to
Doggieâs face. Oliverâs keen, half-mocking gaze
held him. He cursed himself for an impulsive idiot.
The true answer to the question would be a confession
of Jeanne. The scene in the kitchen of FrÃ©lus swam
before his eyes. He dropped into his chair again
with a laugh.

âOh, some one out thereâin another heart-to-heart
talk. As a matter of fact, I think I said it
myself. Itâs odd you should have used the same words.
Anyhow, youâre the only other person who has hit on
the truth as far as Iâm concerned. Finding oneâs soul
is a bit high-falutinâbut thatâs about the size of it.â

âPeggy hasnât hit on the truth, then?â Oliver
asked, with curious earnestness, the shade of mockery
gone.

âThe war has scarcely touched her yet, you see,â
said Doggie. He rose, shrinking from discussion.
âShall we go in?â

Â
In the drawing-room they played bridge till the
ladiesâ bedtime. The Dean coming in, played the
last rubber.

âI hope youâll be able to sleep in a common or
garden bed, Marmaduke,â said Peggy, and kissed him
a perfunctory good night.

âI have heard,â remarked the Dean, âthat it takes
quite a time to grow accustomed to the little amenities
of civilization.â

âThatâs quite true, Uncle Edward,â laughed
Doggie. âIâm terrified at the thought of the silk
pyjamas Peddle has prescribed for me.â

âWhy?â Peggy asked bluntly.

Oliver interposed laughing, his hand on Doggieâs
shoulder.

âTommyâs accustomed to go to bed in his day-shirt.â

âHow perfectly disgusting!â cried Peggy, and
swept from the room.

Oliver dropped his hand and looked somewhat
abashed.

âIâm afraid Iâve been and gone and done it. Iâm
sorry. Iâm still a barbarian South Sea Islander.â

âI wish I were a young man,â said the Dean,
moving from the door and inviting them to sit, âand
could take part in these strange hardships. This
question of night attire, for instance, has never struck
me before. The whole thing is of amazing interest.
Ah! what it is to be old! If I were young, I should
be with you, cloth or no cloth, in the trenches. I
hope both of you know that I vehemently dissent from
those bishops who prohibit the younger clergy from
taking their place in the fighting line. If Godâs
archangels and angels themselves took up the sword
against the Powers of Darkness, surely a stalwart

Â
young curate of the Church of England would find
his vocation in warring with rifle and bayonet against
the proclaimed enemies of God and mankind?â

âThe influence of the twenty thousand or so of
priests fighting in the French Army is said to be
enormous,â Oliver remarked.

The Dean sighed. âIâm afraid weâre losing a
big chance.â

âWhy donât you take up the Fiery Cross, Uncle
Edward, and run a new Crusade?â

The Dean sighed. Five-and-thirty years ago,
when he had set all Durdlebury by the ears, he might
have preached glorious heresy and heroic schism;
but now the immutability of the great grey fabric
had become part of his being.

âIâve done my best, my boy,â he replied, âwith the
result that I am held in high disfavour.â

âBut that doesnât matter a little bit.â

âNot a little bit,â said the Dean. âA man can
only do his duty according to the dictates of his conscience.
I have publicly deplored the attitude of the
Church of England. I have written to
The Times
.
I have published a pamphletâI sent you each a copyâwhich
has brought a hornetsâ nest about my ears.
I have warned those in high places that what they are
doing is not in the best interests of the Church. But
they wonât listen.â

Oliver lit a pipe. âIâm afraid, Uncle Edward,â
he said, âthat though I come of a clerical family, I
know no more of religion than a Hun bishop; but
it has always struck me that the Churchâs job is to
look after the people, whereas, as far as I can make
out, the Church is now squealing because the people
wonât look after the Church.â

The Dean rose. âI wonât go as far as that,â said

Â
he with a smile. âBut there is, I fear, some justification
for such a criticism from the laity. As soon
as the war began the Church should have gathered the
people together and said, âOnward, Christian soldiers.
Go and fight likeâerââââ

âLike hell,â suggested Oliver, greatly daring.

âOr words to that effect,â smiled the old Dean.
He looked at his watch. âDear, dear! past eleven.
I wish I could sit up talking to you boys. But I
start my dayâs work at eight oâclock. If you want
anything, youâve only got to ring. Good night.
It is one of the proudest days of my life to have you
both here together.â

His courtly charm seemed to linger in the room
after he had left.

âHeâs a dear old chap,â said Oliver.

âOne of the best,â said Doggie.

âItâs rather pathetic,â said Oliver. âIn his heart
he would like to play the devil with the bishops and
kick every able-bodied parson into the trenchesâand
there are thousands of them that donât need any
kicking and, on the contrary, have been kicked back;
but he has become half-petrified in the atmosphere of
this place. Itâs lovely to come to as a sort of funk-hole
of peaceâbut my holy aunt!âWhat the blazes
are you laughing at?â

âIâm only thinking of a beast of a boy here who
used to say that,â replied Doggie.

âOh!â said Oliver, and he grinned. âAnyway,
I was only going to remark that if I thought I was
going to spend the rest of my life here, Iâd paint
the town vermilion for a week and then cut my
throat.â

âI quite agree with you,â said Doggie.

âWhat are you going to do when the warâs over?â

Â
âWho knows what heâs going to do? What are
you going to do? Fly back to your little Robinson
Crusoe Durdlebury of a Pacific Island? I donât
think so.â

Oliver stuck his pipe on the mantelpiece and his
hands on his hips and made a stride towards Doggie.

âDamn you, Doggie! Damn you to little bits!
How the Hades did you guess what Iâve scarcely
told myself, much less another human being?â

âYou yourself said it was a good old war and it has
taught us a lot of things.â

âIt has,â said Oliver. âBut I never expected to
hear Huaheine called Durdlebury by you, Doggie.
Oh, Lord! I must have another drink. Whereâs
your glass? Say when?â

They parted for the night the best of friends.

Doggie, in spite of the silk pyjamas and the soft bed
and the blazing fire in his roomâhe stripped back the
light-excluding curtains forgetful of Defence of the
Realm Acts, and opened all the windows wide, to the
horror of Peddle in the morningâslept like an unperturbed
dormouse. When Peddle woke him, he lay
drowsily while the old butler filled his bath and fiddled
about with drawers. At last aroused, he cried out:

âWhat the dickens are you doing?â

Peddle turned with an injured air. âI am matching
your ties and socks for your bottle-green suit, sir.â

Doggie leaped out of bed. âYou dear old idiot, I
canât go about the streets in bottle-green suits. Iâve
got to wear my uniform.â He looked around the
room. âWhere the devil is it?â

Peddleâs injured air deepened almost into resentment.

âWhere the devilââ!â Never had Mr. Marmaduke,
or his father, the Canon, used such language.
He drew himself up.

Â
âI have given orders, sir, for the uniform suit you
wore yesterday to be sent to the cleaners.â

âOh, hell!â said Doggie. And Peddle, unaccustomed
to the vernacular of the British Army,
paled with horror. âOh, hell!â said Doggie.
âLook here, Peddle, just you get on a bicycle, or a
motor-car, or an express train at once and retrieve
that uniform. Donât you understand? Iâm a private
soldier. Iâve got to wear uniform all the time, and
Iâll have to stay in this beastly bed until you get it
for me.â

Peddle fled. The picture that he left on Doggieâs
mind was that of the faithful steward with dismayed,
uplifted hands, retiring from the room in one of the
great scenes of Hogarthâs âRakeâs Progress.â The
similitude made him laughâfor Doggie always had
a saving sense of humourâbut he was very angry
with Peddle, while he stamped around the room in his
silk pyjamas. What the deuce was he going to do?
Even if he committed the military crime (and there
was a far more serious crime already against him)
of appearing in public in mufti, did that old ass think
he was going to swagger about Durdlebury in bottle-green
suits, as though he were ashamed of the Kingâs
uniform? He dipped his shaving-brush into the
hot water. Then he threw it, anyhow, across the
room. Instead of shaving, he would be gloating
over the idea of cutting that old fool, Peddleâs, throat,
and therefore would slash his own face to bits.

Things, however, were not done at lightning speed
in the Deanery of Durdlebury. The first steps had
not even been taken to send the uniform to the cleaners,
and soon Peddle reappeared carrying it over his arm
and the heavy pair of munition boots in his hand.

âThese too, sir?â he asked, exhibiting the latter

Â
resignedly and casting a sad glance at the neat pair
of brown shoes exquisitely polished and beautifully
treed which he had put out for his masterâs wear.

âThese too,â said Doggie. âAnd whereâs my
grey flannel shirt?â

This time Peddle triumphed. âIâve given that
away, sir, to the gardenerâs boy.â

âWell, you can just go and buy me half a dozen
more like it,â said Doggie.

He dismissed the old man, dressed and went downstairs.
The Dean had breakfasted at seven. Peggy
and Oliver were not yet down for the nine oâclock
meal. Doggie strolled about the garden and sauntered
round to the stable-yard. There he encountered
Chipmunk in his shirt-sleeves, sitting on a packing
case and polishing Oliverâs leggings. He raised an
ugly, clean-shaven mug and scowled beneath his
bushy eyebrows at the new-comer.

âMorning, mate!â said Doggie pleasantly.

âMorning,â said Chipmunk, resuming his work.

Doggie turned over a stable bucket and sat down on
it and lit a cigarette.

âGlad to be back?â

Chipmunk poised the cloth on which he had poured
some brown dressing. âNot if I has to be worried
with private soljers,â he replied. âI came âere to
get away from âem.â

âWhatâs wrong with private soldiers? Theyâre
good enough for you, arenât they?â asked Doggie
with a laugh.

âNaow,â snarled Chipmunk. âEspecially when
they ought to be orficers. Go to âell!â

Doggie, who had suffered much in the army, but
had never before been taunted with being a dilettante
gentleman private, still less been consigned to hell on

Â
that account, leapt to his feet shaken by one of his
rare sudden gusts of anger.

âIf you donât say Iâm as good a private soldier as
any in your rotten, mangy regiment, Iâll knock your
blinking head off!â

An insult to a soldierâs regiment can only be wiped
out in blood. Chipmunk threw cloth and legging to
the winds and, springing from his seat like a monkey,
went for Doggie.

âYou just try.â

Doggie tried, and had not Chipmunkâs head been
very firmly secured to his shoulders, he would have
succeeded. Chipmunk went down as if he had been
bombed. It was his unguarded and unscientific rush
that did it. Doggie regarded his prostrate figure in
gratified surprise.

âWhatâs all this about?â cried a sharp, imperious
voice.

Doggie instinctively stood at attention and saluted,
and Chipmunk, picking himself up in a dazed sort of
way, did likewise.

âYou two men shake hands and make friends at
once,â Oliver commanded.

âYes, sir,â said Doggie. He extended his hand,
and Chipmunk, with the nautical shamble, which in
moments of stress defied a couple of yearsâ military
discipline, advanced and shook it. Oliver strode
hurriedly away.

âIâm sorry I said that about the regiment, mate.
I didnât mean it,â said Doggie.

Chipmunk looked uncertainly into Doggieâs eyes
for what Doggie felt to be a very long time. Chipmunkâs
dull brain was slowly realizing the situation.
The man opposite to him was his masterâs cousin.
When he had last seen him, he had no title to be called

Â
a man at all. His vocabulary volcanically rich, but
otherwise limited, had not been able to express him
in adequate terms of contempt and derision. Now
behold him masquerading as a private. Wounded.
But any fool could get wounded. Behold him further
coming down from the social heights whereon his
master dwelt, to take a rise out of him, Chipmunk.
In self-defence he had taken the obvious course. He
had told him to go to hell. Then the important things
had happened. Not the effeminate gentleman but
some one very much like the common Tommy of his
acquaintance had responded. And he had further
responded with the familiar vigour but unwonted
science of the rank and file. He had also stood at
attention and saluted and obeyed like any common
Tommy, when the Major appeared. The last fact
appealed to him, perhaps, as much as the one more
invested in violence.

ââEre,â said he at last, jerking his head and rubbing
his jaw, âhow the âell did you do it?â

âWeâll get some gloves and Iâll show you,â said
Doggie.

So peace and firm friendship were made. Doggie
went into the house and in the dining-room found
Oliver in convulsive laughter.

âOh, my holy aunt! Youâll be the death of me,
Doggie. âYes, sir!ââ He mimicked him. âThe
perfect Tommy. After doing in old Chipmunk.
Chipmunk with the strength of a gorilla and the
courage of a lion. I just happened round to see
him go down. How the blazes did you manage it,
Doggie?â

âThatâs what Chipmunkâs just asked me,â Doggie
replied. âI belong to a regiment where boxing is
taught. Really a good regiment,â he grinned.

Â
âThereâs a sergeant-instructor, a chap called Ballinghallâââ

âNot Joe Ballinghall, the well-known amateur
heavy-weight?â

âThatâs him right enough,â said Doggie.

âMy dear old chap,â said Oliver, âthis is the funniest
war that ever was.â

Peggy sailed in full of apologies and began to pour
out coffee.

âDo help yourselves. Iâm so sorry to have kept
you poor hungry things waiting.â

âWeâve filled up the time amazingly,â cried Oliver,
waving a silver dish-cover. âWhat do you think?
Doggieâs had a fight with Chipmunk and knocked
him out.â

Peggy splashed the milk over the brim of Doggieâs
cup and into the saucer. There came a sudden
flush on her cheek and a sudden hard look into her
eyes.

âFighting? Do you mean to say youâve been
fighting with a common man like Chipmunk?â

âWeâre the best of friends now,â said Doggie.
âWe understand each other.â

âI canât quite see the necessity,â said Peggy.

âIâm afraid itâs rather hard to explain,â he replied
with a rueful knitting of the brows, for he realized
her disgust at the vulgar brawl.

âI think the less said the better,â she remarked
acidly.

The meal proceeded in ominous gloom, and as soon
as Peggy had finished she left the room.

âIt seems, old chap, that I can never do right,â
said Oliver. âLong ago, when I used to crab you,
she gave it to me in the neck; and now when I try
to boost you, you seem to get it.â

Â
âIâm afraid Iâve got on Peggyâs nerves,â said
Doggie. âYou see, weâve only met once before
during the last two years, and I suppose Iâve changed.â

âThereâs no doubt about that, old son,â said Oliver.
âBut all the same, Peggy has stood by you like a brick,
hasnât she?â

âThatâs the devil of it,â replied Doggie, rubbing
up his hair.

âWhy the devil of it?â Oliver asked quickly.

âOh, I donât know,â replied Doggie. âAs you
have once or twice observed, itâs a funny old war.â

He rose, went to the door.

âWhere are you off to?â asked Oliver.

âIâm going to Denby Hall to take a look round.â

âLike me to come with you? We can borrow
the two-seater.â

Doggie advanced a pace. âYouâre an awfully
good sort, Oliver,â he said, touched, âbut would you
mindâI feel rather a beastâââ

âAll right, you silly old ass,â cried Oliver cheerily.
âYou want, of course, to root about there by yourself.
Go ahead.â

âIf youâll take a spin with me this afternoon, or
to-morrowâââ said Doggie in his sensitive way.

âOh, clear out!â laughed Oliver.

And Doggie cleared.

Â

CHAPTER XXI

âAll
right, Peddle, I can find my way about,â
said Doggie, dismissing the old butler and
his wife after a little colloquy in the hall.

âEverythingâs in perfect order, sir, just as it was
when you left; and there are the keys,â said Mrs.
Peddle.

The Peddles retired. Doggie eyed the heavy
bunch of keys with an air of distaste. For two years
he had not seen a key. What on earth could be the
good of all this locking and unlocking? He stuffed
the bunch in his tunic pocket and looked around
him. It seemed difficult to realize that everything
he saw was his own. Those trees visible from the
hall windows were his own, and the land on which
they grew. This spacious, beautiful house was his
own. He had only to wave a hand, as it were, and
it would be filled with serving men and serving maids
ready to do his bidding. His foot was on his native
heath, and his name was James Marmaduke Trevor.

Did he ever actually live here, have his being
here? Was he ever part and parcel of it allâthe
Oriental rugs, the soft stair-carpet on the noble oak
staircase leading to the gallery, the oil paintings, the
impressive statuary, the solid, historical, oak hall
furniture? Were it not so acutely remembered, he
would have felt like a man accustomed all his life
to barns and tents and hedgerows and fetid holes in
the ground, who had wandered into some ill-guarded

Â
palace. He entered the drawing-room. The faithful
Peddles, with pathetic zeal to give him a true
home-coming, had set it out fresh and clean and
polished; the windows were like crystal, and flowers
welcomed him from every available vase. And so
in the dining-room. The Chippendale dining-table
gleamed like a sombre translucent pool. On the
sideboard, amid the array of shining silver, the very
best old Waterford decanters filled with whisky and
brandy, and old cut-glass goblets invited him to refreshment.
The precious mezzotint portraits, mostly of
his own collecting, regarded him urbanely from the
walls.
The Times
and the
Morning Post
were laid out
on the little table by his accustomed chair near the
massive marble mantelpiece.

âThe dear old idiots,â said Doggie, and he sat down
for a moment and unfolded the newspapers and
strewed them around, to give the impression that he
had read and enjoyed them.

And then he went into his own private and particular
den, the peacock and ivory room, which had been
the supreme expression of himself and for which he
had ached during many nights of misery. He looked
round and his heart sank. He seemed to come
face to face with the ineffectual, effeminate creature
who had brought upon him the disgrace of his manâs
life. But for the creator and sybarite enjoyer of this
sickening boudoir, he would now be in honoured
command of men. He conceived a sudden violent
hatred of the room. The only thing in the place
worth a manâs consideration, save a few water-colours,
was the honest grand piano, which, because it did not
Ã¦sthetically harmonize with his squeaky, pot-bellied
theorbos and tinkling spinet, he had hidden in an
alcove behind a curtain. He turned an eye of disgust

Â
on the vellum backs of his books in the closed Chippendale
cases, on the drawers containing his collection
of wall-papers, on the footling peacocks, on the
curtains and cushions, on the veined ivory paper which,
beginning to fade two years ago, now looked mean and
meaningless. It was an abominable room. It ought
to be smelling of musk or pastilles or joss-sticks. It
might have done so, for once he had tried something
of the sort, and did not renew the experiment only
because the smell happened to make him sick.

There was one feature of the room at which for
a long time he avoided looking: but wherever he
turned, it impressed itself on his consciousness as the
miserable genius of the despicable place. And that
was his collection of little china dogs.

At last he planted himself in front of the great
glass cabinet, whence thousands of little dogs looked
at him out of little black dots of eyes. There were
dogs of all nationalities, all breeds, all twisted enormities
of human invention. There were monstrous
dogs of China and Japan; Aztec dogs; dogs in SÃ¨vres
and Dresden and Chelsea; sixpenny dogs from Austria
and Switzerland; everything in the way of a
little dog that man had made. He stood in front
of it with almost a doggish snarl on his lips. He had
spent hundreds and hundreds of pounds over these
futile dogs. Yet never a flesh and blood, real, lusty

canis futilis
had he possessed. He used to dislike
real dogs. The shivering rat, Goliath, could scarcely
be called a dog. He had wasted his heart over these
contemptible counterfeits. To add to his collection,
catalogue it, describe it, correspond about it with the
semi-imbecile Russian prince, his only rival collector,
had once ranked with his history of wall-papers as
the serious and absorbing pursuit of his life.

Â
Then suddenly Doggieâs hatred reached the crisis
of ferocity. He saw red. He seized the first instrument
of destruction that came to his hand, a little gilt
Louis XV music stool, and bashed the cabinet full
in front. The glass flew into a thousand splinters.
He bashed again. The woodwork of the cabinet,
stoutly resisting, worked hideous damage on the gilt
stool. But Doggie went on bashing till the cabinet
sank in ruins and the little dogs, headless, tailless,
rent in twain, strewed the floor. Then Doggie
stamped on them with his heavy munition boots
until dogs and glass were reduced to powder and the
Aubusson carpet was cut to pieces.

âDamn the whole infernal place!â cried Doggie,
and he heaved a mandolin tied up with disgusting
peacock-blue ribbons at the bookcase, and fled from
the room.

He stood for a while in the hall, shaken with his
anger; then mounted the staircase and went into his
own bedroom with the satinwood furniture and nattier
blue hangings. God! what a bedchamber for a
man! He would have liked to throw bombs into the
nest of effeminacy. But his mother had arranged
it, so in a way it was immune from his iconoclastic
rage. He went down to the dining-room, helped
himself to a whisky and soda from the sideboard, and
sat down in the arm-chair amidst the scattered newspapers
and held his head in his hands and thought.

The house was hateful; all its associations were
hateful. If he lived there until he was ninety, the
abhorred ghost of the pre-war little Doggie Trevor
would always haunt every nook and cranny of the
place, mouthing the quarter of a centuryâs shame that
had culminated in the Great Disgrace. At last he
brought his hand down with a bang on the arm of his

Â
chair. He would never live in this House of Dishonour
again. Never. He would sell it.

âBy God!â he cried, starting to his feet, as the
inspiration came.

He would sell it, as it stood, lock, stock and barrel,
with everything in it. He would wipe out at one
stroke the whole of his unedifying history. Denby
Hall gone, what could tie him to Durdlebury? He
would be freed, for ever, from the petrification of the
grey, cramping little city. If Peggy didnât like it,
that was Peggyâs affair. In material things he was
master of his destiny. Peggy would have to follow
him in his career, whatever it was, not he Peggy.
He saw clearly that which had been mapped out for
him, the silly little social ambitions, the useless existence,
little Doggie Trevor for ever trailing obediently
behind the lady of Denby Hall. Doggie threw himself
back in his chair and laughed. No one had ever
heard him laugh like that. After a while he was
even surprised at himself.

He was perfectly ready to marry Peggy. It was
almost a preordained thing. A rupture of the
engagement was unthinkable. Her undeviating
loyalty bound him by every fibre of gratitude and
honour. But it was essential that Peggy should
know whom and what she was marrying. The
Doggie trailing in her wake no longer existed. If
she were prepared to follow the new Doggie, well
and good. If not, there would be conflict. For that
he was prepared.

He strode, this time contemptuously, into his
wrecked peacock and ivory room, where his telephone
(blatant and hideous thing) was ingeniously concealed
behind a screen, and rang up Spooner and Smithson,
the leading firm of auctioneers and estate agents in

Â
the town. At the mention of his name, Mr. Spooner,
the senior partner, came to the telephone.

âYes, Iâm back, Mr. Spooner, and Iâm quite
well,â said Doggie. âI want to see you on very
important business. When can you fix it up? Any
time? Can you come along now to Denby Hall?â

Mr. Spooner would be pleased to wait upon Mr.
Trevor immediately. He would start at once. Doggie
went out and sat on the front doorstep and smoked
cigarettes till he came.

âMr. Spooner,â said he, as soon as the elderly
auctioneer descended from his little car, âIâm
going to sell the whole of the Denby Hall estate, and,
with the exception of a few odds and ends, family
relics and so forth, which Iâll pick out, all the contents
of the houseâfurniture, pictures, sheets, towels and
kitchen clutter. Iâve only got six daysâ leave, and I
want all the worries, as far as I am concerned, settled
and done with before I go. So youâll have to buck
up, Mr. Spooner. If you say you canât do it, Iâll
put the business by telephone into the hands of a
London agent.â

It took Mr. Spooner nearly a quarter of an hour
to recover his breath, gain a grasp of the situation and
assemble his business wits.

âOf course Iâll carry out your instructions, Mr.
Trevor,â he said at last. âYou can safely leave the
matter in our hands. But, although it is against my
business interests, pray let me beg you to reconsider
your decision. It is such a beautiful home, your
grandfather, the Bishopâs, before you.â

âHe bought it pretty cheap, didnât he, somewhere
in the âseventies?â

âI forget the price he paid for it, but I could look
it up. Of course we were the agents.â

Â
âAnd then it was let to some dismal people until
my father died and my mother took it over. Iâm
sorry I canât get sentimental about it, as if it were an
ancestral hall, Mr. Spooner. I want to get rid of
the place, because I hate the sight of it.â

âIt would be presumptuous of me to say anything
more,â answered the old-fashioned country auctioneer.

âSay what you like, Mr. Spooner,â laughed Doggie
in his disarming way. âWeâre old friends. But
send in your people this afternoon to start on inventories
and measuring up, or whatever they do, and Iâll
look round to-morrow and select the bits I may want
to keep. Youâll see after the storing of them, wonât
you?â

âOf course, Mr. Trevor.â

Mr. Spooner drove away in his little car, a much
dazed man.

Like the rest of Durdlebury and the circumjacent
county, he had assumed that when the war was over
Mr. James Marmaduke Trevor would lead his bride
from the Deanery into Denby Hall, where the latter,
in her own words, would proceed to make things
hum.

âMy dear,â said he to his wife at luncheon, âyou
could have knocked me over with a feather. What
heâs doing it for, goodness knows. I can only assume
that he has grown so accustomed to the destruction
of property in France, that he has got bitten by the
fever.â

âPerhaps Peggy Conover has turned him down,â
suggested his wife, who, much younger than he,
employed more modern turns of speech. âAnd I
shouldnât wonder if she has. Since the war girls
arenât on the look out for pretty monkeys.â

âIf Miss Conover thinks she has got hold of a

Â
pretty monkey in that young man, she is very much
mistaken,â replied Mr. Spooner.

Meanwhile Doggie summoned Peddle to the hall.
He knew that his announcement would be a blow to
the old man; but this was a world of blows; and
after all, one could not organize oneâs life to suit the
sentiments of old family idiots of retainers, served they
never so faithfully.

âPeddle,â said he, âIâm sorry to say Iâm going
to sell Denby Hall. Messrs. Spooner and Smithsonâs
people are coming in this afternoon. So give them
every facility. Also tea, or beer, or whisky, or whatever
they want. About whatâs going to happen to
you and Mrs. Peddle, donât worry a bit. Iâll look
after that. Youâve been jolly good friends of mine
all my life, and Iâll see that everythingâs as right as
rain.â

He turned, before the amazed old butler could
reply, and marched away. Peddle gaped at his
retreating figure. If those were the ways which
Mr. Marmaduke had learned in the army, the lower
sank the army in Peddleâs estimation. To sell
Denby Hall over his head! Why, the place and all
about it was
his
! So deeply are squattersâ rights
implanted in the human instinct.

Doggie marched along the familiar high road,
strangely exhilarated. What was to be his future
he neither knew nor cared. At any rate, it would
not lie in Durdlebury. He had cut out Durdlebury
for ever from his scheme of existence. If he got
through the war, he and Peggy would go out somewhere
into the great world where there was manâs
work to do. Parliament! Peggy had suggested it
as a sort of country gentlemanâs hobby that would
keep him amused during the London seasonsâso

Â
might prospective bride have talked to prospective
husband fifty years ago. Parliament! God help
him and God help Peggy if ever he got into Parliament.
He would speak the most unpopular truths
about the race of politicians if ever he got into Parliament.
Peggy would wish that neither of them had
ever been born. He held the trenchesâ views on
politicians. No fear. No muddy politics as an
elegant amusement for him. He laughed as he had
laughed in the dining-room at Denby Hall.

He would have a bad quarter of an hour with
Peggy. Naturally. She would say, and with every
right: âWhat about me? Am I not to be considered?â
Yes, of course she would be considered.
The position his fortune assured him would always be
hers. He had no notion of asking her to share a
log cabin in the wilds of Canada, or to bury herself
in Oliverâs dud island of Huaheine. The great
world would be before them. âBut give me some
sort of an idea of what you propose to do,â she would
with perfect propriety demand. And there Doggie
was stuck. He had not the ghost of a programme.
All he had was faith in the war, faith in the British
spirit and genius that would bring it to a perfect end,
in which there would be unimagined opportunities
for a man to fling himself into a new life, and new
conditions, and begin the new work of a new civilization.

âIf sheâll only understand,â said he, âthat I
canât go back to those blasted little dogs, all will be
well.â

Not quite all. Although his future was as nebulous
as the planetary system in the Milky Way, at the back
of his mind was a vague conviction that it would be
connected somehow with the welfare of those men

Â
whom he had learned to know and love: the men to
whom reading was little pleasure, writing a school-childâs
laborious task, the glories of the earth as interpreted
through art a sealed book; the men whose
daily speech was foul metaphor; the men, hemi-demi-semi-educated,
whose crude socialistic opinions
the open lessons of history and the eternal facts of
human nature derisively refuted; the men who had
sweated and slaved in factory and in field to no other
purpose than to obey the biological laws of the perpetuation
of the species; yet the men with the sweet minds
of children, the gushing tenderness of women, the hearts
of lions; the men compared to whom the rotten
squealing heroes of Homer were a horde of cowardly
savages. They were
men
, these comrades of his,
swift with all that there can be of divine glory in
men.

And when they came home and the high gods
sounded the false trumpet of peace?

There would be menâs work in England for all
the Doggies in England to do.

Again, if Peggy could understand this, all would
be well. If she missed the point altogether, and
tauntingly advised him to go and join his friends the
Socialists at onceâthenâhe shoved his cap to the
back of his head and wrinkled his foreheadâthenââ

âEverything will be in the soup,â said he.

These reflections brought him to the Deanery.
The nearest way of entrance was the stable-yard gate,
which was always open. He strode in, waved a hand
to Chipmunk who was sitting on the ground with his
back against the garage, smoking a pipe, and entered
the house by the French window of the dining-room.
Where should he find Peggy? His whole mind
was set on the immediate interview. Obviously

Â
the drawing-room was the first place of search. He
opened the drawing-room door, the hinges and lock
oily, noiseless, perfectly ordained, like everything
in the perfectly ordained English Deanery, and strode
in.

His entrance was so swift, so protected from sound,
that the pair had no time to start apart before he was
there, with his amazed eyes full upon them. Peggyâs
hands were on Oliverâs shoulders, tears were streaming
down her face, as her head was thrown back from him,
and Oliverâs arm was around her. Her back was
to the door. Oliver withdrew his arm and retired a
pace or two.

âLord Almighty,â he whispered, âhereâs Doggie!â

Then Peggy, realizing what had happened, wheeled
round and stared tragically at Doggie, who, preoccupied
with the search for her, had not removed his cap.
He drew himself up.

âI beg your pardon,â he said with imperturbable
irony, and turned.

Oliver rushed across the room.

âStop, you silly fool!â

He slammed the open door, caught Doggie by the
arm and dragged him away from the threshold. His
blue eyes blazed and the lips beneath the short-cropped
moustache quivered.

âItâs all my fault, Doggie. Iâm a beast and a
cad and anything you like to call me. But for things
you said last nightâwellâno, hang it all, thereâs
no excuse. Everythingâs on me. Peggyâs as true
as gold.â

Peggy, red-eyed, pale-cheeked, stood a little way
back, silent, on the defensive. Doggie, looking from
one to the other, said quietly:

Â
âA triangular explanation is scarcely decent.
Perhaps you might let me have a word or two with
Peggy.â

âYes. It would be best,â she whispered.

âIâll be in the dining-room if you want me,â
said Oliver, and went out.

Doggie took her hand and, very gently, led her
to a chair.

âLet us sit down. There,â said he, ânow we
can talk more comfortably. First, before we touch
on this situation, let me say something to you. It may
ease things.â

Peggy, humiliated, did not look at him. She
nodded.

âAll right.â

âI made up my mind this morning to sell Denby
Hall and its contents. Iâve given old Spooner instructions.â

She glanced at him involuntarily. âSell Denby
Hall?â

âYes, dear. You see, I have made up my mind
definitely, if Iâm spared, not to live in Durdlebury
after the war.â

âWhat were you thinking of doing?â she asked,
in a low voice.

âThat would depend on after-war circumstances.
Anyhow, I was coming to you, when I entered the
room, with my decision. I knew, of course, that it
wouldnât please youâthat you would have something
to say to itâperhaps something very serious.â

âWhat do you mean by something very serious?â

âOur little contract, dear,â said Doggie, âwas
based on the understanding that you would not be
uprooted from the place in which are all your lifeâs
associations. If I broke that understanding it would

Â
leave you a free agent to determine the contract, as
the lawyers say. So perhaps, Peggy dear, we might
dismissâwellâother considerations, and just discuss
this.â

Peggy twisted a rag of handkerchief and wavered
for a moment. Then she broke out, with fresh tears
on her cheek.

âYouâre a dear of dears to put it that way. Only
you could do it. Iâve been a brute, old boy; but I
couldnât help it. I
did
try to play the game.â

âYou did, Peggy dear. Youâve been wonderful.â

âAnd although it didnât look like it, I was trying
to play the game when you came in. I really was.
And so was he.â She rose and threw the handkerchief
away from her. âIâm not going to step out
of the engagement by the side door youâve left open
for me, you dear old simple thing. It stands if you
like. Weâre all honourable people, and Oliverââshe
drew a sharp little breathââOliver will go out
of our lives.â

Doggie smiledâhe had risenâand taking her
hands, kissed them.

âIâve never known what a splendid Peggy it is,
until I lose her. Look here, dear, hereâs the whole
thing in a nutshell. While Iâve been morbidly occupied
with myself and my grievances and my disgrace
and my efforts to pull through, and have gradually
developed into a sort of half-breed between a Tommy
and a gentleman with every mortal thing in me warped
and changed, youâve stuck to the original rotten ass
you lashed into the semblance of a man, in this very
room, goodness knows how many months, or years,
or centuries ago. In my infernal selfishness, Iâve
treated you awfully badly.â

âNo, you havenât,â she decided stoutly.

Â
âYes, I have. The ordinary girl would have
told a living experiment like me to go hang long
before this. But you didnât. And now you see a
totally different sort of Doggie and youâre making
yourself miserable because heâs a queer, unsympathetic,
unfamiliar stranger.â

âAll that may be so,â she said, meeting his eyes
bravely. âBut if the unfamiliar Doggie still cares
for me, it doesnât matter.â

Here was a delicate situation. Two very tender-skinned
vanities opposed to each other. The smart
of seeing oneâs affianced bride in the arms of another
man hurts grievously sore. Itâs a primitive sex affair,
independent of love in its modern sense. If the savageâs
abandoned squaw runs off with another fellow,
he pursues him with clubs and tomahawks until he
has avenged the insult. Having known ME, to
decline to Spotted Crocodile! So the finest flower
of civilization cannot surrender the lady who once was
his to the more favoured male without a primitive
pang. On the other hand, Doggie knew very well
that he did not love Peggy, that he had never loved
Peggy. But how in common decency could a man
tell a girl, who had wasted a couple of years of her
life over him, that he had never loved her? Instead
of replying to her questions, he walked about the
room in a worried way.

âI take it,â said Peggy incisively, after a while,
âthat you donât care for me any longer.â

He turned and halted at the challenge. He snapped
his fingers. What was the good of all this beating
of the bush?

âLook here, Peggy, letâs face it out. If youâll
confess that you and Oliver are in love with each other,
Iâll confess to a girl in France.â

Â
âOh?â said Peggy, with a swift change to coolness.
âThereâs a girl in France, is there? How
long has this been going on?â

âThe last four days in billets before I got wounded,â
said Doggie.

âWhat is she like?â

Then Doggie suddenly laughed out loud and took
her by the shoulders in a grasp rougher than she had
ever dreamed to lie in the strength or nature of Marmaduke
Trevor, and kissed her the heartiest, honestest
kiss she had ever had from man, and rushed out of the
room.

Presently he returned, dragging with him the
disconsolate Major.

âHere,â said he, âfix it up between you. Iâve
told Peggy about a girl in France and she wants to
know what sheâs like.â

Peggy, shaken by the rude grip and the kiss, flashed
and cried rebelliously:

âIâm not quite so sure that I want to fix it up with
Oliver.â

âOh yes, you do,â cried Oliver.

He snatched up Doggieâs cap and jammed it on
Doggieâs head and cried:

âDoggie, youâre the best and truest and finest of
dear old chaps in the whole wide world.â

Doggie settled his cap, grinned, and moved to the
door.

âAnything else, sir?â

Oliver roared, delighted: âNo, Private Trevor,
you can go.â

âVery good, sir.â

Doggie saluted smartly and went out. He passed
through the French window of the dining-room into
the mellow autumn sunshine. Found himself standing

Â
in front of Chipmunk, who still smoked the pipe
of elegant leisure by the door of the garage.

âThis is a dam good old world all the same. Isnât
it?â said he.

âIf it was always like this, it would have its points,â
replied the unworried Chipmunk.

Doggie had an inspiration. He looked at his
watch. It was nearly one oâclock.

âHungry?â

âAlways âungry. Specially about dinner-time.â

âCome along of me to the Downshire Arms and
have a bite of dinner.â

Chipmunk rose slowly to his feet, and put his pipe
into his tunic pocket, and jerked a slow thumb backwards.

âAinât yer having yer meals âere?â

âOnly now and then, as sort of treats,â said Doggie.
âCome along.â

âKer-ist!â said Chipmunk. âCan yer wait a bit
until Iâve cleaned me buttons?â

âOh, bust your old buttons!â laughed Doggie.
âIâm hungry.â

So the pair of privates marched through the old
city to the Downshire Arms, the select, old-world
hotel of Durdlebury, where Doggie was known
since babyhood; and there, sitting at a window table
with Chipmunk, he gave Durdlebury the great
sensation of its life. If the Dean himself, clad in
tights and spangles, had juggled for pence by the west
door of the cathedral, tongues could scarcely have
wagged faster. But Doggie worried his head about
gossip not one jot. He was in joyous mood and ordered
a gargantuan feast for Chipmunk and bottles of the
strongest old Burgundy, such as he thought would
get a grip on Chipmunkâs whiskyfied throat; and

Â
under the genial influence of food and drink, Chipmunk
told him tales of far lands and strange adventures;
and when they emerged much later into the quiet
streets, it was the great good fortune of Chipmunkâs
life that there was not the ghost of an Assistant Provost-Marshal
in Durdlebury.

âDoggie, old man,â said Oliver afterwards, âmy
wonder and reverence for you increases hour by
hour. You are the only man in the whole world
who has ever made Chipmunk drunk.â

âYou see,â said Doggie modestly, âI donât think
he ever really loved anyone who fed him before.â

Â

CHAPTER XXII

Doggie,
the lightest-hearted private in the
British Army, danced, in a metaphorical
sense, back to London, where he stayed for the rest
of his leave at his rooms in Woburn Place; took his
wholesome fill of theatres and music-halls, going to
those parts of the house where Tommies congregate;
and bought an old Crown Derby dinner service as a
wedding present for Peggy and Oliver, a tortoise-shell-fitted
dressing-case for Peggy, and for Oliver
a magnificent gold watch that was an encyclopÃ¦dia
of current information. He had never felt so happy
in his life, so enchanted with the grimly smiling old
world. Were it not for the Boche, it could hold its
own as a brave place with any planet going. He
blessed Oliver, who, in turn, had blessed him as though
he had displayed heroic magnanimity. He blessed
Peggy, who, flushed with love and happiness and
gratitude, had shown him, for the first time, what a
really adorable young woman she could be. He
thanked Heaven for making three people happy,
instead of three people miserable.

He marched along the wet pavements with a new
light in his eyes, with a new exhilarating breath in
his nostrils. He was free. The war over, he could
do exactly what he liked. An untrammelled future
lay before him. During the war he could hop about
trenches and shell-holes with the freedom of a birdâ¦.

Those awful duty letters to Peggy! Only now

Â
he fully realized their never-ending strain. Now
he could write to her spontaneously, whenever the
mood suited, write to her from his heart: âDear
old Peggy, Iâm so glad youâre happy. Oliverâs a
splendid chap. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.â He
had lost a dreaded bride; but he had found a dear
and devoted friend. Nay, more: he had found
two devoted friends. When he drew up his account
with humanity, he found himself passing rich in love.

His furlough expired, he reported at his depot, and
was put on light duty. He went about it the cheeriest
soul alive, and laughed at the memory of his former
miseries as a recruit. This camp life in England,
after the mud and blood of Franceâlike the African
gentleman in Mr. Addisonâs âCato,â he blessed his
stars and thought it luxury. He was not sorry that
the exigencies of service prevented him from being
present at the wedding of Oliver and Peggy. For it
was the most sudden of phenomena, like the fight of
two rams, as Shakespeare hath it. In war-time people
marry in haste; and often, dear God, they have not
the leisure to repent. Since the beginning of the war
there are many, many women twice widowedâ¦.
But that is by the way. Doggie was grateful to an
ungrateful military system. If he had attendedâin
the capacity of best man, so please youâso violent
and unreasoning had Oliverâs affection become,
Durdlebury would have gaped and whispered behind
its hand and made things uncomfortable for everybody.
Doggie from the security of his regiment wished
them joy by letter and telegram, and sent them the
wedding presents aforesaid.

Then for a season there were three happy people,
at least, in this war-wilderness of suffering. The
newly wedded pair went off for a honeymoon, whose

Â
promise of indefinite length was eventually cut short
by an unromantic War Office. Oliver returned to
his regiment in France and Peggy to the Deanery,
where she sat among her wedding presents and her
hopes for the future.

âI never realized, my dear,â said the Dean to his
wife, âwhat a remarkably pretty girl Peggy has
grown into.â

âItâs because she has got the man she loves,â said
Mrs. Conover.

âDo you think thatâs the reason?â

âIâve known the plainest of women become quite
good-looking. In the early days of our married
lifeââshe smiledââeven I was not quite unattractive.â

The old Dean bent downâshe was sitting and he
standingâand lifted her chin with his forefinger.

âYou, my dear, have always been by far the most
beautiful woman of my acquaintance.â

âWeâre talking of Peggy,â smiled Mrs. Conover.

âAh!â said the Dean. âSo we were. I was
saying that the childâs happiness was reflected in her
faceâââ

âI rather thought I said it, dear,â replied Mrs.
Conover.

âIt doesnât matter,â said her husband, who was
first a man and then a dean. He waved a hand in
benign dismissal of the argument. âItâs a great
mercy,â said he, âthat she has married the man she
loves instead ofâwell â¦ Marmaduke has turned
out a capital fellow, and a credit to the familyâbut
I never was quite easy in my mind over the engagementâ¦.
And yet,â he continued, after a turn or
two about the room, âIâm rather conscience-stricken
about Marmaduke, poor chap. He has taken it like

Â
a brick. Yes, my dear, like a brick. Like a gentleman.
But all the same, no man likes to see another
fellow walk off with his sweetheart.â

âI donât think Marmaduke was ever so bucked
in his life,â said Mrs. Conover placidly.

âSoââ?â

The Dean gasped. His wifeâs smile playing
ironically among her wrinkles was rather beautiful.

âPeggyâs word, Edward, not mine. The modern
vocabulary. It meansâââ

âOh, I know what the hideous word means. It
was your using it that caused a shiver down my spine.
But why bucked?â

âIt appears thereâs a girl in France.â

âOho!â said the Dean. âWho is she?â

âThatâs what Peggy, even now, would give a
good deal to find out.â

For Doggie had told Peggy nothing more about
the girl in France. Jeanne was his own precious
secret. That it was shared by Phineas and Mo
didnât matter. To discuss her with Peggy, besides
being irrelevant, in the circumstances, was quite
another affair. Indeed, when he had avowed the girl
in France, it was not so much a confession as a gallant
desire to help Peggy out of her predicament. For,
after all, what was Jeanne but a beloved war-wraith
that had passed through his life and disappeared?

âThe development of Marmaduke,â said the
Dean, âis not the least extraordinary phenomenon
of the war.â

Now that Doggie had gained his freedom, Jeanne
ceased to be a wraith. She became once again a
wonderful thing of flesh and blood towards whom
all his young, fresh instinct yearned tremendously.

Â
One day it struck his ingenuous mind that, if Jeanne
were willing, there could be no possible reason why
he should not marry her. Who was to say him nay?
Convention? He had put all the conventions of his
life under the auctioneerâs hammer. The family?
He pictured a meeting between Jeanne and the kind
and courteous old Dean. It could not be other than
an episode of beauty. All he had to do was to seek
out Jeanne and begin his wooing in earnest. The
simplest adventure in the world for a well-to-do and
unattached young manâif only that young man had
not been a private soldier on active service.

That was the rub. Doggie passed his hand over
his hair ruefully. How on earth could he get to
FrÃ©lus again? Not till the end of the war, at any
rate, which might be years hence. There was nothing
for it but a resumption of intimacy by letter. So he
wrote to Jeanne the letter which loyalty to Peggy
had made him destroy weeks ago. But no answer
came. Then he wrote another, telling her of Peggy
and his freedom, and his love and his hopes, and to
that there came no reply.

A prepaid telegram produced no result.

Doggie began to despair. What had happened to
Jeanne? Why did she persist in ruling him out of
her existence? Was it because, in spite of her gratitude,
she wanted none of his love? He sat on the
railing on the sea front of the south coast town where
he was quartered, and looked across the Channel in
dismayed apprehension. He was a fool. What could
there possibly be in little Doggie Trevor to inspire
a romantic passion in any womanâs heart? Take
Peggyâs case. As soon as a real, genuine fellow like
Oliver came along, Peggyâs heart flew out to him like
needle to magnet. Even had he been of Oliverâs

Â
Paladin mould, what right had he to expect Jeanne
to give him all the wonder of herself after a four daysâ
acquaintance? Being what he was, just little Doggie
Trevor, the assumption was an impertinence. She
had sheltered herself from it behind a barrier of
silence.

A girl, a thing of low-cut blouse, truncated skirts
and cheap silk stockings, who had been leaning unnoticed
for some time on the rails by his side, spoke.

âYou seem to be pretty lonely.â

Doggie swerved round. âYes, I am, darned
lonely.â

âCome for a walk, or take me to the pictures.â

âAnd then?â asked Doggie, swinging to his feet.

âIf we get on all right, we can fix up something
for to-morrow.â

She was pretty, with a fair, frizzy, insolent prettiness.
She might have been any age from fourteen to four-and-twenty.

Doggie smiled, tempted to while away a dark hour.
But he said, honestly:

âIâm afraid I should be a dull companion.â

âWhatâs the matter?â she laughed. âLost
your best girl?â

âSomething like it.â He waved a hand across the
sea. âOver there.â

âFrench? Oh!â She drew herself up.
âArenât English girls good enough for you?â

âWhen theyâre sympathetic, theyâre delightful,â
said he.

âOh, you make me tired! Good-bye,â she
snapped, and stalked away.

After a few yards she glanced over her shoulder to
see whether he was following. But Doggie remained
by the railings.

Â
Presently he shrugged his shoulders and went off
to a picture palace by himself and thought wistfully
of Jeanne.

And Jeanne? Well, Jeanne was no longer at
FrÃ©lus; for there came a morning when Aunt Morin
was found dead in her bed. The old doctor came and
spread out his thin hands and said â
Eh bien
â and
â
Que voulez-vous?
â and âIt was bound to happen
sooner or later,â and murmured learned words. The
old curÃ© came and a neighbour or two, and candles
were put round the coffin and the
pompes funÃ¨bres

draped the front steps and entrance and vestibule in
heavy black. And as soon as was possible Aunt Morin
was laid to rest in the little cemetery adjoining the
church, and Jeanne went back to the house with
Toinette, alone in the wide world. And because
there had been a death in the place the billeted soldiers
went about the courtyard very quietly.

Since Phineas and Mo and Doggieâs regiment had
gone away, she had devoted, with a new passionate
zeal, all the time she could spare from the sick woman
to the comforts of the men. No longer restrained by
the tightly drawn purse-strings of Aunt Morin, but
with money of her own to spendâand money restored
to her by these menâs dear and heroic comradeâshe
could give them unexpected treats of rich coffee and
milk, fresh eggs, fruitâ¦. She mended and darned
for them and suborned old women to help her. She
conspired with the Town Major to render the granary
more habitable; and the Town Major, who had not
to issue a return for a centimeâs expense, received all
her suggestions with courteous enthusiasm. Toinette
taking good care to impress upon every British soldier
who could understand her, the fact that to mademoiselle

Â
personally and individually he was indebted for all
these luxuries, the fame of Jeanne began to spread
through that sector of the front behind which lay
FrÃ©lus. Concurrently spread the story of Doggie
Trevorâs exploit. Jeanne became a legendary figure,
save to those thrice fortunate who were billeted on

Veuve Morin et Fils, Marchands des Foins en Gros et
DÃ©tail
, and these, according to their several stolid
British ways, bowed down and worshipped before
the slim French girl with the tragic eyes, and when
they departed, confirmed the legend and made things
nasty for the sceptically superior private.

So, on the day of the funeral of Aunt Morin, the
whole of the billet sent in a wreath to the house, and
the whole of the billet attended the service in the little
church, and they marched back and drew up by the
front doorâa guard of honour extending a little distance
down the road. The other men billeted in
the village hung around, together with the remnant
of the inhabitants, old men, women and children,
but kept quite clear of the guarded path through
which Jeanne was to pass. One or two officers looked
on curiously. But they stood in the background. It
was none of their business. If the men, in their
free time, chose to put themselves on parade, without
arms, of course, so much the better for the army.

Then Jeanne and the old curÃ©, in his time-scarred
shovel-hat and his rusty soutane, followed by Toinette,
turned round the corner of the lane and emerged
into the main street. A sergeant gave a word of
command. The guard stood at attention. Jeanne
and her companions proceeded up the street, unaware of
the unusual, until they entered between the first two
files. Then for the first time the tears welled into
Jeanneâs eyes. She could only stretch out her hands

Â
and cry somewhat wildly to the bronzed statues on
each side of her, â
Merci, mes amis, merci, merci
,â
and flee into the house.

The next day MaÃ®tre PÃ©pineau, the notary, summoned
her to his
cabinet
. MaÃ®tre PÃ©pineau was very
old. His partner had gone off to the war. âOne
of the necessities of the present situation,â he would
say, âis that I should go on living in spite of myself;
for if I died, the whole of the affairs of FrÃ©lus would
be in the soup.â Now, a fortnight back, MaÃ®tre
PÃ©pineau and four neighboursâthe four witnesses
required by French law when there is only one notary
to draw up the
instrument public
âhad visited Aunt
Morin; so Jeanne knew that she had made a fresh will.

â
Mon enfant
,â said the old man, unfolding the
document, âin a previous will your aunt had left you
a little heritage out of the half of her fortune which
she was free to dispose of by the code. You having
come into possession of your own money, she has
revoked that will and left everything to her only
surviving son, Gaspard Morin, in Madagascar.â

âIt is only just and right,â said Jeanne.

âThe unfortunate part of the matter,â said MaÃ®tre
PÃ©pineau, âis that Madame Morin has appointed
official trustees to carry on the estate until Monsieur
Gaspard Morin can make his own arrangements. The
result is that you have no
locus standi
as a resident in
the house. I pointed this out to her. But you know,
in spite of her good qualities, she was obstinateâ¦.
It pains me greatly, my dear child, to have to state
your position.â

âI am then,â said Jeanne, â
sans-asile
âhomeless?â

âAs far as the house of Monsieur Gaspard Morin
is concernedâyes.â

Â
âAnd my English soldiers?â asked Jeanne.

âAlas, my child,â replied the old man, âyou will
find them everywhere.â

Which was cold consolation. For however much
inspired by patriotic gratitude a French girl may be,
she cannot settle down in a strange place where British
troops are billeted and proceed straightway to minister
to their comfort. Misunderstandings are apt to arise
even in the best regulated British regiments. In the
house of Aunt Morin, in FrÃ©lus, her position was
unassailable. Anywhere else â¦

âSo, my good Toinette,â said Jeanne, after having
explained the situation to the indignant old woman,
âI can only go back to my friend in Paris and reconstitute
my life. If you will accompany meââ?â

But no. Toinette had the peasantâs awful dread
of Paris. She had heard about Paris: there were
thieves, ruffians that they called
apaches
, who murdered
you if you went outside your door.

âThe
apaches
,â laughed Jeanne, âwere swept away
into the army on the outbreak of war, and theyâve
nearly all been killed, fighting like heroes.â

âThere are the old ones left, who are worse than
the young,â retorted Toinette.

No. Mademoiselle could teach her nothing about
Paris. You could not even cross a street without
risk of life, so many were the omnibuses and automobiles.
In every shop you were a stranger to be
robbed. There was no air in Paris. You could not
sleep for the noise. And thenâto live in a city of
a hundred million people and not know a living soul!
It was a mad-house matter. Again no. It grieved
her to part from mademoiselle, but she had made her
little economiesâa difficult achievement, considering
how regardful of her pence Madame had beenâand

Â
she would return to her Breton town, which forty
years ago she had left to enter the service of Madame
Morin.

âBut after forty years, Toinette, who in Paimpol
will remember you?â

âIt is I who remember Paimpol,â said Toinette.
She remained for a few moments in thought. Then
she said: â
Câest drÃ´le, tout de mÃªme.
I havenât seen
the sea for forty years, and now I canât sleep of nights
thinking of it. The first man I loved was a fisherman
of Paimpol. We were to be married after he returned
from an Iceland voyage, with a
gros bÃ©nÃ©fice
. When
the time came for his return, I would stand on the
shore and watch and watch the sea. But he never
came. The sea swallowed him up. And thenâyou
can understand quite wellâthe child was born
dead. And I thought I would never want to look
at the sea again. So I came here to your Aunt
Morin, the daughter of Doctor Kersadec, your grandfather,
and I married Jules Dagnant, the foreman of
the carters of the hay â¦ and he died a long time
ago â¦ and now I have forgotten him and I want
to go and look at the sea where my man was drowned.â

âBut your grandson, who is fighting in the
Argonne?â

âWhat difference can it make to him whether I
am in FrÃ©lus or Paimpol?â

âThatâs true,â said Jeanne.

Toinette bustled about the kitchen. Folks had to
eat, whatever happened. But she went on talking,
Madame Morin. One must not speak evil of the
dead. They have their work cut out to extricate
themselves from Purgatory. But all the sameâafter
forty yearsâ faithful serviceâand not to mention in
the willâ
mÃªme pour une Bretonne, câÃ©tait raide
.

Â
Jeanne agreed. She had no reason to love her Aunt
Morin. Her fatherâs people came from Agen on the
confines of Gascony; he had been a man of great
gestures and vehement speech; her mother, gentle,
reserved,
un pen dÃ©vote
. Jeanne drew her character
from both sources; but her sympathies were rather
southern than northern. For some reason or the
other, perhaps for his expansive waysâwho knows?âAunt
Morin had held the late Monsieur BossiÃ¨re in
detestation. She had no love for Jeanne, and Jeanne,
who before her good fortune had expected nothing
from Aunt Morin, regarded the will with feelings of
indifference. Except as far as it concerned Toinette.
Forty yearsâ faithful service deserved recognition. But
what was the use of talking about it?

âSo we must separate, Toinette?â

âAlas, yes, mademoiselleâunless mademoiselle
would come with me to Paimpol.â

Jeanne laughed. What should she do in Paimpol?
There wasnât even a fisherman left there to fall in
love with.

âMademoiselle,â said Toinette later, âdo you
think you will meet the little English soldier, Monsieur
Trevor, in Paris?â

â
Dans la guerre on ne se revoit jamais
,â said Jeanne.

But there was more of personal decision than of
fatalism in her tone.

So Jeanne waited for a day or two until the regiment
marched away, and then, with heavy heart, set
out for Paris. She wrote, indeed, to Phineas, and
weeks afterwards Phineas, who was in the thick of
the Somme fighting, wrote to Doggie telling him of
her departure from FrÃ©lus; but regretted that as he
had lost her letter he could not give him her Paris
address.

Â
And in the meantime the house of Gaspard Morin
was shuttered and locked and sealed; and the bureaucratically
minded old Postmaster of FrÃ©lus, who had
received no instructions from Jeanne to forward her
correspondence, handed Doggieâs letters and telegrams
to the aged postman, a superannuated herdsman, who
stuck them into the letter-box of the deserted house
and went away conscious of duty perfectly accomplished.

Then, at last, Doggie, fit again for active service,
went out with a draft to France, and joined Phineas
and Mo, almost the only survivors of the cheery,
familiar crowd that he had loved, and the grimness
of battles such as he had never conceived possible took
him in its inexorable grip, and he lost sense of everything
save that he was the least important thing on
Godâs earth struggling desperately for animal existence.

Yet there were rare times of relief from stress,
when he could gropingly string together the facts of
a pre-Somme existence. And then he would curse
Phineas lustily for losing the precious letter.

âMan,â Phineas once replied, âdonât you see that
youâre breaking a heart which, in spite of its apparent
rugosity and callosity, is as tender as a new-made
motherâs? Tell me to do it, and Iâll desert and make
my way to Paris andâââ

âAnd the military police will see that you make
your way to hell via a stone wall. And serve you
right. Donât be a blithering fool,â said Doggie.

âThen I donât know what I can do for you,
laddie, except die of remorse at your feet.â

âWeâre all going to die of rheumatic fever,â said
Doggie, shivering in his sodden uniform. âBlast this
rain!â

Phineas thrust his hand beneath his clothing and

Â
produced a long, amorphous and repulsive substance,
like a painted tallow candle overcome by intense heat,
from which he gravely bit an inch or two.

âWhatâs that?â asked Doggie.

âItâs a stick of peppermint,â said Phineas. âIâve
still an aunt in Galashiels who remembers my
existence.â

Doggie stuck out his hand like a monkey in the
Zoo.

âYou selfish beast!â he said.

Â

CHAPTER XXIII

The
fighting went on and, to Doggie, the inhabitants
of the outside world became almost
as phantasmagorical as Phineasâs providential aunt in
Galashiels. Immediate existence held him. In an
historic battle Mo Shendish fell with a machine bullet
through his heart. Doggie, staggering with the rest
of the company to the attack over the muddy, shell-torn
ground, saw him go down a few yards away. It
was not till later that he knew he had gone West
with many other great souls. Doggie and Phineas
mourned for him as a brother. Without him France
was a muddier and a bloodier place and the outside
world more unreal than ever.

Then to Doggie came a heart-broken letter from the
Dean. Oliver had gone the same road as Mo. Peggy
was frantic with grief. Vividly Doggie saw the peaceful
deanery on which all the calamity of all the war had
crashed with sudden violence.

âWhy I should thank God we parted as friends,
I donât quite know,â said Doggie, âbut I do.â

âI suppose, laddie,â said Phineas, âitâs good to feel
that smiling eyes and hearty hands will greet us when
we too pass over the Border. My God, man,â he added
reflectively, after a pause, âhave you ever considered
what a goodly company it will be?  When you come to
look at it that way, it makes Death quite a trivial affair.â

âI suppose it does to us while weâre here,â said Doggie.
âWeâve seen such a lot of it. But to those who

Â
havenâtâmy poor Peggyâitâs the end of her universe.â

Yes, it was all very well to take death philosophically,
or fatalistically, or callously, or whatever you liked to
call it, out there, where such an attitude was the only
stand against raving madness; but at home, beneath
the grey mass of the cathedral, folks met Death as a
strange and cruel horror. The new glory of life that
Peggy had found, he had blackened out in an instant.
Doggie looked again at the old manâs letterâhis handwriting
was growing shakyâand forgot for a while
the familiar things around him, and lived with Peggy
in her sorrow.

Then, as far as Doggieâs sorely tried division was
affected, came the end of the great autumn fighting.
He found himself well behind the lines in reserve,
and so continued during the cold dreary winter months.
And the more the weeks that crept by and the more
remote seemed Jeanne, the more Doggie hungered
for the sight of her. But all this period of his life
was but a dun-coloured monotony, with but few
happenings to distinguish week from week. Most
of the company that had marched with him into
FrÃ©lus were dead or wounded. Nearly all the officers
had gone. Captain Willoughby, who had interrogated
Jeanne with regard to the restored packet, and, on
Doggieâs return, had informed him with a friendly
smile that they were a damned sight too busy then to
worry about defaulters of the likes of him, but that
he was going to be court-martialled and shot as soon
as peace was declared, when they would have time
to think of serious mattersâCaptain Willoughby had
gone to Blighty with a leg so mauled that never would
he command again a company in the field. Sergeant
Ballinghall, who had taught Doggie to use his fists,

Â
had retired, minus a hand, into civil life. A scientific
and sporting helper at Roehampton, he informed
Doggie by letter, was busily engaged on the invention
of a boxing-glove which would enable him to carry
on his pugilistic career. âSo, in future times,â said
he, âif any of your friends among the nobility and
gentry want lessons in the noble art, donât forget
your old friend Ballinghall.â WhereatâincidentallyâDoggie
wondered. Never, for a fraction of a second,
during their common military association, had Ballinghall
given him to understand that he regarded him
otherwise than as a mere Tommy without any pretensions
to gentility. There had been times when
Ballinghall had cursed himâperhaps justifiably and
perhaps lovinglyâas though he had been the scum of
the earth. Doggie would no more have dared address
him in terms of familiarity than he would have dared
slap the Brigadier-General on the back. And now
the honest warrior sought Doggieâs patronage. Of
the original crowd in England who had transformed
Doggieâs military existence by making him penny-whistler
to the company, only Phineas and himself
were left. There were others, of course, good and
gallant fellows, with whom he became bound in the
rough intimacy of the army; but the first friends,
those under whose protecting kindliness his manhood
had developed, were the dearest. And their ghosts
remained dear.

At last the division was moved up and there was
more fighting.

One day, after a successful raid, Doggie tumbled
back with the rest of the men into the trench and,
looking about, missed Phineas. Presently the word
went round that âMacâ had been hit, and later the
rumour was confirmed by the passage down the trench

Â
of Phineas on a stretcher, his weather-battered face
a ghastly ivory.

âIâm alive all right, laddie,â he gasped, contorting
his lips into a smile. âIâve got it clean through the
chest like a gentleman. But it gars me greet I canna
look after you any longer.â

He made an attempt at waving a hand, and the
stretcher-bearers carried him away out of the army for
ever.

Thereafter Doggie felt the loneliest thing on earth,
like Wordsworthâs cloud, or the Last Man in
Tom Hoodâs grim poem. For was he not the last
man of the original company, as he had joined it,
hundreds of years ago, in England? It was only
then that he realized fully the merits of the wastrel
Phineas McPhail. Not once or twice, but a thousand
times had the manâs vigilant affection, veiled under
cynical humour, saved him from despair. Not once
but a thousand times had the gaunt, tireless Scotchman
saved him from physical exhaustion. At every turn
of his career, since his enlistment, Phineas had been
there, watchful, helpful, devoted. There he had
been, always ready and willing to be cursed. To
curse him had been the great comfort of Doggieâs
life. Whom could he curse now? Not a soulâno
one, at any rate, against whom he could launch
an anathema with any real heart in it. Than curse
vainly and superficially, far better not to curse at all.
He missed Phineas beyond all his conception of the
blankness of bereavement. Like himself, Phineas had
found salvation in the army. Doggie realized how
he had striven in his own queer way to redeem the
villainy of his tutorship. No woman could have been
more gentle, more unselfish.

âWhat the devil am I going to do?â said Doggie.

Â
Meanwhile Phineas, lying in a London hospital
with a bullet through his body, thought much and
earnestly of his friend, and one morning Peggy got a
letter.

âDear Madam,â

âTime was when I could not have addressed
you without incurring your not unjustifiable disapproval.
But I take the liberty of doing so now,
trusting to your generous acquiescence in the proposition
that the war has purged many offences. If this
has not happened, to some extent, in my case, I do
not see how it has been possible for me to have regained
and retained the trust and friendship of so sensitive
and honourable a gentleman as Mr. Marmaduke
Trevor.

âIf I ask you to come and see me here, where I
am lying severely wounded, it is not with an intention
to solicit a favour for myself personallyâalthough Iâll
not deny that the sight of a kind and familiar face
would be a boon to a lonely and friendless manâbut
with a deep desire to advance Mr. Trevorâs happiness.
Lest you may imagine I am committing an unpardonable
impertinence and thereby totally misunderstand
me, I may say that this happiness can only be achieved
by the aid of powerful friends both in London and
Paris.

âIt is only because the lad is the one thing dear
to me left in the world, that I venture to intrude on
your privacy at such a time.

âI am, dear Madam,

âYours very faithfully,

â
Phineas McPhail.
â

Peggy came down to breakfast, and having dutifully

Â
kissed her parents, announced her intention of going
to London by the eleven oâclock train.

âWhy, how can you, my dear?â asked Mrs.
Conover.

âIâve nothing particular to do here for the next
few days.â

âBut your father and I have. Neither of us can
start off to London at a momentâs notice.â

Peggy replied with a wan smile: âBut, dearest
mother, you forget. Iâm an old, old married woman.â

âBesides, my dear,â said the Dean, âPeggy has
often gone away by herself.â

âBut never to London,â said Mrs. Conover.

âAnyhow, Iâve got to go.â Peggy turned to the
old butler. âRing up Sturrocksâs and tell them Iâm
coming.â

âYes, miss,â said Burford.

âHeâs as bad as you are, mother,â said Peggy.

So she went up to London and stayed the night
at Sturrocksâs alone, for the first time in her life.
She half ate a lonely, execrable war dinner in the stuffy,
old-fashioned dining-room, served ceremoniously by
the ancient head waiter, the friend of her childhood,
who, in view of her recent widowhood, addressed her
in the muffled tones of the sympathetic undertaker.
Peggy nearly cried. She wished she had chosen another
hotel. But where else could she have gone?
She had stayed at few hotels in London: once at
the Savoy; once at Claridgeâs; every other time at
Sturrocksâs. The Savoy? Its vastness had frightened
her. And Claridgeâs? No; that was sanctified
for ever. Oliver in his lordly way had snapped his
fingers at Sturrocksâs. Only the best was good enough
for Peggy. Now only Sturrocksâs remained.

She sought her room immediately after the dreary

Â
meal and sat before the fireâit was a damp, chill
February nightâand thought miserable and aching
thoughts. It happened to be the same room which
she had occupied, ohâthousands of years agoâon
the night when Doggie, point-device in new Savile
Row uniform, had taken her to dinner at the Carlton.
And she had sat, in the same imitation Charles the
Second brocaded chair, looking into the same generous,
old-fashioned fire, thinkingâthinking. And she remembered
clenching her fist and apostrophizing the
fire and crying out aloud: âOh, my God! if only
he makes good!â

Oceans of years lay between then and now. Doggie
had made good; every man who came home wounded
must have made good. Poor old Doggie. But how
in the name of all that was meant by the word Love
she could ever have contemplatedâas she had contemplated,
with an obstinate, virginal loyaltyâmarriage
with Doggie, she could not understand.

She undressed, brought the straight-backed chair
close to the fire, and, in her dainty nightgown, part
of her trousseau, sat elbow on knee, face in thin,
clutching hands, slippered feet on fender, thinking,
thinking once again. Thinking now of the gates of
Paradise that had opened to her for a few brief weeks.
Of the man who never had to make good, being the
wonder of wonders of men, the delicious companion,
the incomparable lover, the all-compelling revealer,
the great, gay, scarcely, to her womanâs limited power
of vision, comprehended heroic soldier. Of the terrifying
meaninglessness of life, now that her God of
Very God, in human form, had been swept, in an
instant, off the earth into the Unknown.

Yet was life meaningless after all? There must be
some significance, some inner truth veiled in mystery,

Â
behind even the casually accepted and never probed
religion to which she had been born and in which
she had found poor refuge. For, like many of her
thoughtless, unquestioning class, she had looked at
Christ through stained-glass windows, and now the
windows were darkenedâ¦. For the first time in
her life, her soul groped intensely towards eternal
verities. The fire burned low and she shivered. She
became again the bit of human flotsam cruelly buffeted
by the waves, forgotten of God. Yet, after she had
risen and crept into bed and while she was staring
into the darkness, her heart became filled with a vast
pity for the thousands and thousands of women, her
sisters, who at that moment were staring, hopeless,
like her, into the unrelenting night.

She did not fall asleep till early morning. She
rose late. About half-past eleven as she was preparing
to walk abroad on a dreary shopping excursionâthe
hospital visiting hour was in the afternoonâa telegram
arrived from the Dean.

âJust heard that Marmaduke is severely wounded.â

She scarcely recognized the young private tutor
of Denby Hall in the elderly man with the deeply
furrowed face, who smiled as she approached his bed.
She had brought him flowers, cigarettes of the exquisite
kind that Doggie used to smoke, chocolatesâ¦.

She sat down by his bedside.

âAll this is more than gracious, Mrs. Manningtree,â
said Phineas. âTo a
vieux routier
like me,
it is a wee bit overwhelming.â

âItâs very little to do for Doggieâs best friend.â

Phineasâs eyes twinkled. âIf you call him Doggie,
like that, maybe it wonât be so difficult for me to
talk to you.â

Â
âWhy should it be difficult at all?â she asked.
âWe both love him.â

âAy,â said Phineas. âHeâs a lovable lad, and it is
because others besides you and me find him lovable,
that I took the liberty of writing to you.â

âThe girl in France?â

âEh?â He put out a bony hand, and regarded
her in some disappointment. âHas he told you?
Perhaps you know all about it.â

âI know nothing except thatââa girl in France,â
was all he told me. Butâfirst about yourself. How
badly are you woundedâand what can we do for
you?â

She dragged from a reluctant Phineas the history
of his wound and obtained confirmation of his statement
from a nurse who happened to pass up the gangway
of the pleasant ward and lingered by the bedside.
McPhail was doing splendidly. Of course, a man
with a hole through his body must be expected to go
back to the regime of babyhood. So long as he behaved
himself like a well-conducted baby all would
be well. Peggy drew the nurse a few yards away.

âIâve just heard that his dearest friend out there,
a boy whom he loves dearly and has been through
the whole thing with him in the same companyâitâs
odd, but he was his private tutor years agoâboth
gentlemen, you knowâin fact, Iâm here just to talk
about the boyâââ Peggy grew somewhat incoherent.
âWellâIâve just heard that the boy has
been seriously wounded. Shall I tell him?â

âI think it would be better to wait for a few days.
Any shock like that sends up their temperatures.
We hate temperatures, and weâre getting his down
so nicely.â

âAll right,â said Peggy, and she went back smiling

Â
to Phineas. âShe says youâre getting on amazingly,
Mr. McPhail.â

Said Phineas: âIâm grateful to you, Mrs. Manningtree,
for concerning yourself about my entirely
unimportant carcass. Now, as Virgil says, â
paullo
majora canemus
.ââ

âYou have me there, Mr. McPhail,â said Peggy.

âLet us sing of somewhat greater things. That
is the bald translation. Let us talk of Doggieâif
so be it is agreeable to you.â

âCarry on,â said Peggy.

âWell,â said Phineas, âto begin at the beginning,
we marched into a place called FrÃ©lusâââ

In his pedantic way he began to tell her the story
of Jeanne, so far as he knew it. He told her of the
girl standing in the night wind and rain on the bluff
by the turning of the road. He told her of Doggieâs
insane adventure across No Manâs Land to the farm
of La Folette. Tears rolled down Peggyâs cheeks.
She cried, incredulous:

âDoggie did that? Doggie?â

âIt was childâs play to what he had to do at Guedecourt.â

But Peggy waved away the vague heroism of Guedecourt.

âDoggie did that? For a woman?â

The whole elaborate structure of her conception of
Doggie tumbled down like a house of cards.

âAy,â said Phineas.

âHe did thatââPhineas had given an imaginative
and picturesque account of the episodeââfor
this girl Jeanne?â

âIt is a strange coincidence, Mrs. Manningtree,â
replied Phineas, with a flicker of his lips elusively
suggestive of unctuousness, âthat almost those identical

Â
words were used by Mademoiselle BossiÃ¨re in my
presence. â
Il a fait cela pour moi!
â Butâyou will
pardon me for saying itâwith a difference of intonation,
which, as a woman, no doubt you will be able
to divine and appreciate.â

âI know,â said Peggy. She bent forward and
picked with finger and thumb at the fluff of the
blanket. Then she said, intent on the fluff: âIf a
man had done a thing like that for me, I should have
crawled after him to the ends of the earth.â Presently
she looked up with a flash of the eyes. âWhy isnât
this girl doing it?â

âYou must listen to the end of the story,â said
Phineas. âI may tell you that I always regarded
myself, with my Scots caution, as a model of tact and
discretion; but after many conversations with Doggie,
Iâm beginning to have my doubts. I also imagined
that I was very careful of my personal belongings;
but facts have convicted me of criminal laxity.â

Peggy smiled. âThat sounds like a confession,
Mr. McPhail.â

âMaybe itâs in the nature of one,â he assented.
âBut by your leave, Mrs. Manningtree, Iâll resume
my narrative.â

He continued the story of Jeanne: how she had
learned through him of Doggieâs wealth and position
and early upbringing; of the memorable dinner-party
with poor Mo; of Doggieâs sensitive interpretation
of her French
bourgeoise
attitude; and finally the loss
of the letter containing her address in Paris.

After he had finished, Peggy sat for a long while
thinking. This romance in Doggieâs life had moved
her as she thought she could never be moved since
the death of Oliver. Her thoughts winged themselves
back to an afternoon, remote almost as her socked

Â
and sashed childhood, when Doggie, immaculately
attired in grey and pearl harmonies, had declared,
with his little effeminate drawl, that tennis made one
so terribly hot. The scene in the Deanery garden
flashed before her. It was succeeded by a scene in
the Deanery drawing-room when, to herself indignant,
he had pleaded his delicacy of constitution. And the
same Doggie, besides braving death a thousand times
in the ordinary execution of his soldierâs duties, had
performed this queer deed of heroism for a girl. Then
his return to Durdleburyââ

âIâm afraid,â she said suddenly, âI was dreadfully
unkind to him when he came home the last time. I
didnât understand. Did he tell you?â

Phineas stretched out a hand and with the tips of
his fingers touched her sleeve.

âMrs. Manningtree,â he said softly, âdonât you
know that Doggieâs a very wonderful gentleman?â

Again her eyes grew moist. âYes. I know. Of
course he never would have mentioned itâ¦. I
thought, Mr. McPhail, he had deterioratedâGod
forgive me! I thought he had coarsened and got into
the ways of an ordinary Tommyâand I was snobbish
and uncomprehending and horrible. It seems as if
I am making a confession now.â

âAy. Why not? If it were not for the soulâs
health, the ancient Church wouldnât have instituted
the practice.â

She regarded him shrewdly for a second. âYouâve
changed too.â

âMaybe,â said Phineas. âItâs an ill war that
blows nobody good. And Iâm not complaining of
this one. But you were talking of your miscomprehension
of Doggie.â

âI behaved very badly to him,â she said, picking

Â
again at the blanket. âI misjudged him altogetherâbecause
I was ignorant of everythingâeverything
that matters in life. But Iâve learned better since then.â

âAy,â remarked Phineas gravely.

âMr. McPhail,â she said, after a pause, âit wasnât
those rotten ideas that prevented me from marrying
himâââ

âI know, my dear little lady,â said Phineas, grasping
the plucking hand. âYou just loved the other man
as you never could have loved Doggie, and thereâs
an end toât. Love just happens. Itâs the holiest
thing in the world.â

She turned her hand, so as to meet his in a mutual
clasp, and withdrew it.

âYouâre very kindâand sympatheticâand understandingâââ
Her voice broke. âI seem to have
been going about misjudging everybody and everything.
Iâm beginning to see a little bitâa little bit fartherâI
canât express myselfâââ

âNever mind, Mrs. Manningtree,â said Phineas
soothingly, âif you cannot express yourself in
words. Leave that to the politicians and the philosophers
and the theologians, and other such windy
expositors of the useless. But you can express yourself
in deeds.â

âHow?â

âFind Jeanne for Doggie.â

Peggy bent forward with a queer light in her eyes.

âDoes she love himâreally love him as he deserves
to be loved?â

âIt is not often, Mrs. Manningtree, that I commit
myself to a definite statement. But, to my certain
knowledge, these two are breaking their hearts for
each other. Couldnât you find her, before the poor
laddie is killed?â

Â
âHeâs not killed yet, thank God!â said Peggy,
with an odd thrill in her voice.

He was alive. Only severely wounded. He would
be coming home soon, carried, according to convoy,
to any unfriendly hospital dumping-ground in the
United Kingdom. If only she could bring this French
girl to him! She yearned to make reparation for
the past, to act according to the new knowledge that
love and sorrow had brought her.

âBut how can I find herâjust a girlâan unknown
Mademoiselle BossiÃ¨reâamong the millions
of Paris?â

âIâve been racking my brains all the morning,â
replied Phineas, âto recall the address, and out of
the darkness there emerges just two words,
Port Royal
.
If you know Paris, does that help you at all?â

âI donât know Paris,â replied Peggy humbly. âI
donât know anything. Iâm utterly ignorant.â

âI beg entirely to differ from you, Mrs. Manningtree,â
said Phineas. âYou have come through much
heavy travail to a correct appreciation of the meaning
of human love between man and woman, and so
you have in you the wisdom of all the ages.â

âYes, yes,â said Peggy, becoming practical. âBut

Port Royal
?â

âThe clue to the labyrinth,â replied Phineas.

Â

CHAPTER XXIV

The
Dean of an English cathedral is a personage.

He has power. He can stand with folded
arms at its door and forbid entrance to anyone, save,
perhaps, the King in person. He can tell not only
the Bishop of the Diocese, but the very Archbishop
of the Province, to run away and play. Having power
and using it benignly and graciously, he can exert its
subtler form known as influence. In the course of
his distinguished career he is bound to make many
queer friends in high places.

âMy dear Field-Marshal, could you do me a little
favourâ¦?â

âMy dear Ambassador, my daughter, etc., etcâ¦.â

Deans, discreet, dignified gentlemen, who would
not demand the impossible, can generally get what
they ask for.

When Peggy returned to Durdlebury and put
Doggieâs case before her father, and with unusual
fervour roused him from his first stupefaction at the
idea of her mad project, he said mildly:

âLet me understand clearly what you want to do.
You want to go to Paris by yourself, discover a girl
called Jeanne BossiÃ¨re, concerning whose address you
know nothing but two wordsâPort Royalâof course
there is a Boulevard Port Royal somewhere south of
the Luxembourg Gardensâââ

âThen weâve found her,â cried Peggy. âWe
only want the number.â

Â
âPlease donât interrupt,â said the Dean. âYou
confuse me, my dear. You want to find this girl
and re-establish communication between her and
Marmaduke, andâerâgenerally play Fairy Godmother.â

âIf you like to put it that way,â said Peggy.

âAre you quite certain you would be acting wisely?
From Marmadukeâs point of viewâââ

âDonât call him Marmadukeââshe bent forward
and touched his knee caressinglyââMarmaduke could
never have risked his life for a woman. It was Doggie
who did it. She thinks of him as Doggie. Every one
thinks of him now and loves him as Doggie. It was
Oliverâs name for him, donât you see? And he has
stuck it out and made it a sort of title of honour and
affectionâand it was as Doggie that Oliver learned
to love him, and in his last letter to Oliver he signed
himself âYour devoted Doggie.ââ

âMy dear,â smiled the Dean, and quoted:
ââWhatâs in a name? A roseââââ

âWould be unendurable if it were called a bug-squash.
The poetry would be knocked out of it.â

The Dean said indulgently: âSo the name Doggie
connotes something poetic and romantic?â

âYou ask the girl Jeanne.â

The Dean tapped the back of his daughterâs hand
that rested on his knee.

âThereâs no fool like an old fool, my dear. Do you
know why?â

She shook her head.

âBecause the old fool has learned to understand
the young fool, whereas the young fool doesnât understand
anybody.â

She laughed and threw herself on her knees by
his side.

Â
âDaddy, youâre immense!â

He took the tribute complacently. âWhat was I
saying before you interrupted me? Oh yes. About
the wisdom of your proposed action. Are you sure
they want each other?â

âAs sure as Iâm sitting here,â said Peggy.

âThen, my dear,â said he, âIâll do what I can.â

Whether he wrote to Field-Marshals and Ambassadors
or to lesser luminaries, Peggy did not know.
The Dean observed an old-world punctilio about such
matters. At the first reply or two to his letters he
frowned; at the second or two he smiled in the way
any elderly gentleman may smile when he finds himself
recognized by high-and-mightiness as a person of
importance.

âI think, my dear,â said he at last, âIâve arranged
everything for you.â

So it came to pass that while Doggie, with a shattered
shoulder and a touched left lung, was being transported
from a base hospital in France to a hospital in England,
Peggy, armed with all kinds of passports and recommendations,
and a very fixed, personal sanctified idea,
was crossing the Channel on her way to Paris and
Jeanne.

And, after all, it was no wild-goose chase, but a
very simple matter. An urbane, elderly person at the
British Embassy performed certain telephonic gymnastics.
At the end:

â
Merci, merci. Adieu!
â

He turned to her.

âA representative from the Prefecture of Police
will wait on you at your hotel at ten oâclock to-morrow
morning.â

Â
The official called, took notes, and confidently
assured her that he would obtain the address of Mademoiselle
Jeanne BossiÃ¨re within twelve hours.

âBut how, monsieur, are you going to do it?â
asked Peggy.

âMadame,â said he, âin spite of the war, the telegraphic,
telephonic, and municipal systems of France
work in perfect orderâto say nothing of that of the
police. FrÃ©lus, I think, is the name of the place she
started from?â

At eight oâclock in the evening, after her lonely
dinner in the great hotel, the polite official called again.
She met him in the lounge.

âMadame,â said he, âI have the pleasure to inform
you that Mademoiselle Jeanne BossiÃ¨re, late of FrÃ©lus,
is living in Paris at 743
bis
Boulevard Port Royal, and
spends all her days at the succursale of the French
Red Cross in the Rue Vaugirard.â

âHave you seen her and told her?â

âNo, madame, that did not come within my
instructions.â

âI am infinitely grateful to you,â said Peggy.

â
Il nây a pas de quoi
, madame. I perform the tasks
assigned to me and am only too happy, in this case,
to have been successful.â

âBut, monsieur,â said Peggy, feeling desperately
lonely in Paris, and pathetically eager to talk to a
human being, even in her rusty VÃ©vey school French,
âhavenât you wondered why Iâve been so anxious to
find this young lady?â

âIf we began to wonder,â he replied with a
laugh, âat the things which happen during the war,
we should be so bewildered that we shouldnât be
able to carry on our work. Madame,â said he,
handing her his card, âif you should have further

Â
need of me in the matter, I am always at your
service.â

He bowed profoundly and left her.

Peggy stayed at the Ritz because, long ago, when
her parents had fetched her from VÃ©vey and had given
her the one wonderful fortnight in Paris she had ever
known, they had chosen this dignified and not inexpensive
hostelry. To her girlish mind it had
breathed the last word of splendour, movement, gaietyâall
that was connoted by the magical name of the
City of Light. But now the glamour had departed.
She wondered whether it had ever been. Oliver had
laughed at her experiences. Sandwiched between dear
old Uncle Edward and Aunt Sophia, what in the
sacred name of France could she have seen of Paris?
Wait till they could turn round. He would take her
to Paris. She would have the unimagined time of
her life. They dreamed dreams of the Rue de la
Paixâhe had five hundred pounds laid by, which he
had ear-marked for an orgy of shopping in that Temptation
Avenue of a thoroughfare; of Montmartre, the
citadel of delectable wickedness and laughter; of
funny little restaurants in dark streets where you are
delighted to pay twenty francs for a mussel, so exquisitely
is it cooked; of dainty and crazy theatres;
of long drives, folded in each otherâs arms, when
moonlight touches dawn, through the wonders of the
enchanted city.

Her brief dreams had eclipsed her girlish memories.
Now the dreams had become blurred. She strove to
bring them back till her soul ached, till she broke down
into miserable weeping. She was alone in a strange,
unedifying town; in a strange, vast, commonplace
hotel. The cold, moonlit Place de la VendÃ´me, with
its memorable column, just opposite her bedroom

Â
window, meant nothing to her. She had the desolating
sense that nothing in the world would ever matter to
her againânothing as far as she, Peggy Manningtree,
was concerned. Her life was over. Altruism alone
gave sanction to continued existence. Hence her
present adventure. Paris might have been Burslem
for all the interest it afforded.

Jeanne worked from morning to night in the succursale
of the Croix Rouge in the Rue Vaugirard.
She had tried, after the establishment of her affairs,
to enter, in no matter what capacity, a British base
hospital. It would be a consolation for her surrender
of Doggie to work for his wounded comrades. Besides,
twice in her life she owed everything to the
English, and the repayment of the debt was a matter
of conscience. But she found that the gates of English
hospitals were thronged with English girls; and she
could not even speak the language. So, guided by
the Paris friend with whom she lodged, she made her
way to the Rue Vaugirard, where, in the packing-room,
she had found hard unemotional employment.
Yet the work had to be done: and it was done for
France, which, after all, was dearer to her than England;
and among her fellow-workers, women of all
classes, she had pleasant companionship.

When, one day, the old concierge, bemedalled from
the war of 1870, appeared to her in the packing-room,
with the announcement that a
dame anglaise
desired
to speak to her, she was at first bewildered. She
knew no English ladiesâhad never met one in her
life. It took a second or two for the thought to flash
that the visit might concern Doggie. Then came
conviction. In blue overall and cap, she followed the
concierge to the ante-room, her heart beating. At

Â
the sight of the young Englishwoman in black, with
a crape hat and little white band beneath the veil, it
nearly stopped altogether.

Peggy advanced with outstretched hand.

âYou are Mademoiselle Jeanne BossiÃ¨re?â

âYes, madame.â

âI am a cousin of Monsieur Trevorâââ

âAh, madameââJeanne pointed to the mourningââyou
do not come to tell me he is dead?â

Peggy smiled. âNo. I hope not.â

âAh!â Jeanne sighed in relief, âI thoughtâââ

âThis is for my husband,â said Peggy quietly.

â
Ah, madame! je demande bien pardon. Jâai dÃ»
vous faire de la peine. Je nây pensais pas
âââ

Jeanne was in great distress. Peggy smiled again.
âWidows dress differently in England and France.â
She looked around and her eyes fell upon a bench by
the wall. âCould we sit down and have a little
talk?â

â
Pardon, madame, câest que je suis un peu Ã©mue
â¦â
said Jeanne.

She led the way to the bench. They sat down
together, and for a feminine second or two took stock
of each other. Jeanneâs first rebellious instinct said:
âI was right.â In her furs and her perfect millinery
and perfect shoes and perfect black silk stockings that
appeared below the short skirt, Peggy, blue-eyed, fine-featured,
the fine product of many generations of
scholarly English gentlefolk, seemed to incarnate her
vague conjectures of the social atmosphere in which
Doggie had his being. Her peasant blood impelled
her to suspicion, to a half-grudging admiration, to self-protective
jealousy. The Englishwomanâs ease of
manner, in spite of her helter-skelter French, oppressed
her with an angry sense of inferiority. She was also

Â
conscious of the blue overall and close-fitting cap.
Yet the Englishwomanâs smile was kind and she had
lost her husbandâ¦. And Peggy, looking at this
girl with the dark, tragic eyes and refined, pale face
and graceful gestures, in the funny instinctive British
way tried to place her socially. Was she a lady?
It made such a difference. This was the girl for whom
Doggie had performed his deed of knight-errantry;
the girl whom she proposed to take back to Doggie.
For the moment, discounting the uniform which might
have hidden a midinette or a duchess, she had nothing
but the face and the gestures and the beautifully
modulated voice to go upon, and between the accent
of the midinette and the duchessâboth being equally
charming to her English earâPeggy could not discriminate.
She had, however, beautiful, capable hands,
and took care of her finger-nails.

Jeanne broke the tiny spell of embarrassed silence.

âI am at your disposal, madame.â

Peggy plunged at once into facts.

âIt may seem strange, my coming to you; but
the fact is that my cousin, Monsieur Trevor, is severely
woundedâ¦.â

â
Mon Dieu!
â said Jeanne.

âAnd his friend, Mr. McPhail, who is also
wounded, thinks that if youâwellâââ

Her French failed herâto carry off a very delicate
situation one must have command of languageâshe
could only blurt outââ
Il faut comprendre, mademoiselle.
Il a fait beaucoup pour vous.
â

She met Jeanneâs dark eyes. Jeanne said:

â
Oui, madame, vous avez raison. Il a beaucoup fait
pour moi.
â

Peggy flushed at the unconscious correctionââ
beaucoup
fait
â for â
fait beaucoup
.â

Â
âHe has done not only much, but everything for
me, madame,â Jeanne continued. âAnd you who
have come from England expressly to tell me that he
is wounded, what do you wish me to do?â

âAccompany me back to London. I had a telegram
this morning to say that he had arrived at a
hospital there.â

âThen you have not seen him?â

âNot yet.â

âThen how, madame, do you know that he desires
my presence?â

Peggy glanced at the girlâs hands clasped on her
lap, and saw that the knuckles were white.

âI am sure of it.â

âHe would have written, madame. I only received
one letter from him, and that was while I still lived
at FrÃ©lus.â

âHe wrote many letters and telegraphed to FrÃ©lus,
and received no answers.â

âMadame,â cried Jeanne, âI implore you to
believe what I say: but not one of those letters have
ever reached me.â

âNot one?â

At first Peggy was incredulous. Phineas McPhail
had told her of Doggieâs despair at the lack of response
from FrÃ©lus; and, after all, FrÃ©lus had a properly
constituted post office in working order, which might
be expected to forward letters. She had therefore
come prepared to reproach the girl. But â¦

â
Je le jure
, madame,â said Jeanne.

And Peggy believed her.

âBut I wrote to Monsieur McPhail, giving him
my address in Paris.â

âHe lost the letter before he saw Doggie againââthe
name slipped outââand forgot the address.â

Â
âBut how did you find me?â

âI had a lot of difficulty. The British Embassyâthe
Prefecture of Policeâââ

â
Mon Dieu!
â cried Jeanne again. âDid you do
all that for me?â

âFor my cousin.â

âYou called him Doggie. That is how I know
him and think of him.â

âAll right,â smiled Peggy. âFor Doggie then.â

Jeanneâs brain for a moment or two was in a whirlâEmbassies
and Prefectures of Police!

âMadame, to do this, you must love him very
much.â

âI loved him so muchâI hope you will understand
meâmy French I know is terribleâbut I loved him
so much that until he came home wounded we were

fiancÃ©s
.â

Jeanne drew a short breath. âI felt it, madame.
An English gentleman of great estate would naturally
marry an English lady of his own social class. That
is why, madame, I acted as I have done.â

Then something of what Jeanne really was became
obvious to Peggy. Lady or no lady, in the conventional
British sense, Jeanne appealed to her, in her
quiet dignity and restraint, as a type of Frenchwoman
whom she had never met before. She suddenly
conceived an enormous respect for Jeanne. Also for
Phineas McPhail, whose eulogistic character sketch
she had accepted with feminine reservations subconsciously
derisive.

âMy dear,â she said. â
Vous Ãªtes digne de toute
dame anglaise!
ââwhich wasnât an elegant way of
putting it in the French tongueâ-but Jeanne, with
her odd smile of the lips, showed that she understood
her meaning; she had served her apprenticeship in

Â
the interpretation of Anglo-Gallic. âBut I want to
tell you. Doggie and I were engaged. A family
matter. Then, when he came home woundedâyou
know howâI found that I loved some oneâ
aimais
dâamour
, as you sayâand he found the same. I
loved the man whom I married. He loved you. He
confessed it. We parted more affectionate friends
than we had ever been. I married. He searched
for you. My husband has been killed. Doggie,
although wounded, is alive. That is why I am here.â

They were sitting in a corner of the ante-room,
and before them passed a continuous stream of the
busy life of the war, civilians, officers, badged workers,
elderly orderlies in pathetic bits of uniform that might
have dated from 1870, wheeling packages in and
out, groups talking of the business of the organization,
here and there a blue-vested young lieutenant
and a blue-overalled packer, talkingâit did not need
God to know of what. But neither of the two women
heeded this multitude.

Jeanne said: âMadame, I am profoundly moved
by what you have told me. If I show little emotion,
it is because I have suffered greatly from the war.
One learns self-restraint, madame, or one goes mad.
But as you have spoken to me in your noble English
franknessâI have only to confess that I love Doggie
with all my heart, with all my soulâââ With her two
clenched hands she smote her breastâand Peggy noted
it was the first gesture that she had made. âI feel
the infinite need, madameâyou will understand meâto
care for him, to protect himâââ

Peggy raised a beautifully gloved hand.

âProtect him?â she interrupted. âWhy, hasnât
he shown himself to be a hero?â

Jeanne leant forward and grasped the protesting

Â
hand by the wrist; and there was a wonderful light
behind her eyes and a curious vibration in her voice.

âIt is only
les petits hÃ©ros tout faits
âthe little
ready-made heroesâready made by the
bon Dieu
âwho
have no need of a womanâs protection. But it is a
different thing with the great heroes who have made
themselves without the aid of a
bon Dieu
, from little
dogs of no account (
des petits chiens de rien du tout
)
to what Doggie is at the moment. The woman then
takes her place. She fixes things for ever. She alone
can understand.â

Peggy gasped as at a new Revelation. The terms
in which this French girl expressed herself were far
beyond the bounds of her philosophy. The varying
aspects in which Doggie had presented himself to her,
in the past few months, had been bewildering. Now
she saw him, in a fresh light, though as in a glass
darkly, as reflected by Jeanne. Still, she protested
again, in order to see more clearly.

âBut what would you protect him from?â

âFrom want of faith in himself; from want of
faith in his destiny, madame. Once he told me he
had come to France to fight for his soul. It is necessary
that he should be victorious. It is necessary
that the woman who loves him should make him
victorious.â

Peggy put out her hand and touched Jeanneâs wrist.

âIâm glad I didnât marry Doggie, mademoiselle,â
she said simply. âI couldnât have done that.â She
paused. âWell?â she resumed. âWill you now
come with me to London?â

A faint smile crept into Jeanneâs eyes.

â
Mais oui, madame.
â

Doggie lay in the long, pleasant ward of the great

Â
London hospital, the upper left side of his body a mass of
bandaged pain. Neck and shoulder, front and back
and arm, had been shattered and torn by high explosive
shell. The top of his lung had been grazed. Only
the remorseless pressure at the base hospital had justified
the sending of him, after a week, to England. Youth
and the splendid constitution which Dr. Murdoch
had proclaimed in the far-off days of the warâs beginning,
and the toughening training of the war itself,
carried him through. No more fighting for Doggie
this side of the grave. But the grave was as far distant
as it is from any young man in his twenties who
avoids abnormal peril.

Till to-day he had not been allowed to see visitors,
or to receive letters. They told him that the Dean
of Durdlebury had called; had brought flowers and
fruit and had left a card âFrom your Aunt, Peggy
and myself.â But to-day he felt wonderfully strong,
in spite of the unrelenting pain, and the nurse had
said: âI shouldnât wonder if you had some visitors
this afternoon.â Peggy, of course. He followed
the hands of his wrist-watch until they marked the
visiting hour. And sure enough, a minute afterwards,
amid the stream of men and womenâchiefly womenâof
all grades and kinds, he caught sight of Peggyâs
face smiling beneath her widowâs hat. She had a
great bunch of violets in her bodice.

âMy dear old Doggie!â She bent down and
kissed him. âThose rotten people wouldnât let me
come before.â

âI know,â said Doggie. He pointed to his shoulder.
âIâm afraid Iâm in a hell of a mess. Itâs lovely to see
you.â

She unpinned the violets and thrust them towards
his face.

Â
âFrom home. Iâve brought âem for you.â

âMy God!â said Doggie, burying his nose in the
huge bunch. âI never knew violets could smell like
this.â He laid them down with a sigh. âHowâs
everybody?â

âQuite fit.â

There was a span of silence. Then he stretched
out his hand and she gave him hers and he gripped it
tight.

âPoor old Peggy dear!â

âOh, thatâs all right,â she said bravely. âI know
you care, dear Doggie. Thatâs enough. Iâve just got
to stick it like the rest.â She withdrew her hand after
a little squeeze. âBless you. Donât worry about
me. Iâm contemptibly healthy. But youââ?â

âGetting on splendidly. I say, Peggy, what kind
of people are the Pullingers who have taken Denby
Hall?â

âTheyâre all right, I believe. Heâs something in
the GovernmentâController of Feeding-bottlesâI
donât know. But, oh, Doggie, what an ass you were
to sell the place up!â

âI wasnât.â

âYou were.â

Doggie laughed. âIf youâve come here to argue
with me, I shall cry, and then youâll be turned out
neck and crop.â

Peggy looked at him shrewdly. âYou seem to
be going pretty strong.â

âNever stronger in my life,â lied Doggie.

âWould you like to see somebody you are very
fond of?â

âSomebody Iâm fond of? Uncle Edward?â

âNo, no.â She waved the Very Reverend the
Dean to the empyrean.

Â
âDear old Phineas? Has he come through? Iâve
not had time to ask whether youâve heard anything
about him.â

âYes, heâs flourishing. He wrote to me. Iâve
seen him.â

âPraise the Lord!â cried Doggie. âMy dear,
thereâs no one on earth, save you, whom I should
so much love to see as Phineas. If heâs there, fetch
him along.â

Peggy nodded and smiled mysteriously and went
away down the ward. And Doggie thought:
âThank God, Peggy has the strength to face the
worldâand thank God Phineas has come through.â
He closed his eyes, feeling rather tired, thinking of
Phineas. Of his last words as he passed him stretcher-borne
in the trench. Of the devotion of the man.
Of his future. Well, never mind his future. In all
his vague post-war schemes for reorganization of the
social system, Phineas had his place. No further need
for dear old Phineas to stand in light green and gold
outside a picture palace. He had thought it out long
ago, although he had never said a word to Phineas.
Now he could set the poor chapâs mind at rest for
ever.

He looked round contentedly, and saw Peggy and
a companion coming down the ward, together. But
it was not Phineas. It was a girl in black.

He raised himself, forgetful of exquisite pain, on
his right elbow, and stared in a thrill of amazement.

And Jeanne came to him, and there were no longer
ghosts behind her eyes, for they shone like stars.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

(Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

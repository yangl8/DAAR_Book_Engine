PREFACE.

Maternity, the relation that leads to it, and the
responsibilities, anxieties, and agonies generally connected
with it,âthe right of Woman to decide for
herself when she shall assume the responsibilities,
and be subjected to the sufferings, of Maternity,
and to the relation in which it originates,âMan,
without regard to the wishes and conditions of his
wife, heedless of the physical and spiritual welfare
of his offspring, and solely for his own gratification,
imposing on his wife Maternity, with all its attendant
anguish of body and soul,âthe crime of earth,âthe
greatest outrage one human being can perpetrate
on another,âante-natal murder,âthe ante-natal
history of a human being, and its bearing on
his post-natal character and destiny, in the body
and out of it,âsuch are the topics which are presented
and discussed in the following pages.

6
The author has aimed so to present these subjects
that no intelligent and pure-minded man or woman
need to misunderstand or misconstrue his meaning,
or be offended by his words and modes of expression.
These subjects belong to the holy of holies
of human existence. With them is associated all
that is nearest and dearest to the heart of man and
woman. In the inmost sanctuary of Home, these
should be the topics of freest and most anxious conversation.
All that is pure, lovely, beautiful, and
ennobling, in the relations of Husband and Wife,
and Parent and Child, is directly connected with
these subjects, and the views entertained of them
by men and women in and out of legal marriage.
But that which transpires during the period between
conception and birth, as the foundation of character
in the future man or woman, as an index to their
thoughts, feelings, plans, motives, actions, to their
virtues and vices, to successes and failures in lifeâs
conflict, has been entirely overlooked by biographers
and historians, by poets and novelists, in their
efforts to delineate human life as manifested in individuals,
or in civil and ecclesiastical combinations.

7
Yet all admit that physical, intellectual, and social
tendencies and conditions are organized into the
body and soul of every child, during that period,
that must give tone and direction to the man or
woman in all their future life. In their relations as
husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and
daughters, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors,
in all their commercial, social, civil, and ecclesiastical
relations, their feelings, and their treatment
of all with whom they may be associated, must depend
greatly on these ante-natal influences and
tendencies.

The life of every good man and the life of every
bad man, the life of a teetotaller and the life of a
drunkard, a life of love and a life of hatred, a life
of forgiveness and a life of revenge, a life of truth,
justice, and purity, and a life of falsehood, injustice,
and impurity, the life of Jesus and the life of Napoleon,âwho
can determine to what extent all these
have been, are, or will be, controlled by birthright
tendencies, and by influences that, before they were
born, bore upon those who live these lives? Certain
it is that, to a great extent, the diseases, sufferings,

8
and premature deaths, and many of the individual,
social, governmental, and ecclesiastical thefts,
robberies, and murders, committed in the post-natal
state of our being, are but the natural, if not the
necessary results of these ante-natal organic and
constitutional conditions and tendencies.

To all Husbands and Wives, to all Fathers and
Mothers, and to all who hope to enter into these
most ennobling and most potent of all human relations,
are the following pages earnestly commended,
by

THE AUTHOR.

INTRODUCTORY LETTER.

A Husband to Henry C. Wright.

Boston
, January 10, 1857.

My dear Friend
:

It is twenty years since I first heard you discourse on the
Mission and Relation of the Sexes. You stated then, in substance,
that the sexes had power, each over the other, to save or
to destroy; that all rational hope of the elevation and perfection
of human nature must rest upon a knowledge of, and obedience
to, the laws of Nature, designed to govern those relations; that
man must look to
generation
, rather than to
re
generation, to
bring the race into perfect union and harmony with the Divine;
that no power could save either man or woman, in isolation
from, or in false relations with, each other; and that if either
sinks or rises, the other must follow.

I was but a boy when I first heard you utter such sentiments.
I did not then understand their full import. They had not
entered into the experience of my inner or outer life. Yet I took
the impression, that woman would be to man just what he chose
and had power to make her; and that it depended on man to
say whether woman should be to him a purifying and ennobling
influence, or a source of degradation and ruin.

10
From that time I had a desire, so far as woman is concerned,
to place myself in such relations to her, that her influence on my
life might be pure and ennobling. I have studied to get clear and
definite views of my nature and needs as a man, and how woman
can most perfectly accomplish her mission of love and salvation
to me.

I am now a husband; made so, not by any enactment, ceremony
or license of Church or State (though my marriage is
placed upon record, as an historical fact); nor by the consent of
any third party; nor by any formal contract or bargain between
me and the woman to whom I hold this relation; but by a law
or necessity of my being; by a power, unseen, but ever present,
and ever potent to guide, like that which binds the needle to the
pole, or the soul to God.

All that qualifies me to be a husband and a father, I have consecrated
to the development and happiness of my wife, and of the
children who may result from our union. I have done this, not
because she demands it as her right, but solely because I find in
myself a necessity for so doing. She make no demands on me
as a right; she asks of me only what I feel the necessity of giving.
My love for her gives me no rights over her property,
her person, or her affections. It makes no demands on her, as a
right, but it makes great demands on my own manhood. True
conjugal love never creates rights over the loved one, but necessities
in the one who loves. This necessity is laid upon me, not
by any arbitrary decree of Church or State, but solely by the
concentrated, exclusive love, which, as a husband, I bear to my
wife. The purity and dignity of my nature are involved in my
yielding to this necessity.

I would consecrate my manhood to the perfection and happiness
of my wife, and of the children who may be born of our
union, in the home which, by our united efforts, we hope to

11
create. Your conversation with me, as a boy and a youth, and
your counsel, have been invaluable in the regulation of my life
in my relations with women. I have read your work, entitled
â
Marriage and Parentage
; or, the Reproductive Element in
Man as a Means of his Elevation and Happiness.â To us, in the
home of our love, your teachings will ever be as divine oracles,
to regulate our relations as husband and wife. We would embody
in our lives your â
Ernest
â and â
Nina
,â especially in
regard to parentage, and the relation that leads to it; believing
that those who do actualize that ideal husband and wife, cannot
fail to receive a divine reward, in an ever-growing and an ever-ennobling
love and trust. To that husband who shall embody
your Ernest, the love, the respect and trust of his wife, will be
as the sun and dew of heaven to the opening buds of spring;
they will expand and beautify his manly soul, and cause his
manhood to give out all its beauty and fragrance, and shed a
bright and steady light on the pathway of his wife, and bring
enduring rest to her heart in the home of her wedded love. We
would live in and for each other, and in and for our offspring.
We would be represented in the great human family by those
whom we shall be proud to call our children, and whom all of
human kind shall feel honored to recognize as brothers and sisters.
We would not see our nature degraded, nor our glory
tarnished, in ourselves or our posterity, but we would see that
glory made brighter, and that nature more noble.

I know that on the government of my passional relations with
my wife depends her health and life of body and soul, the health
of our children, and the beauty and happiness of our home. I
know, if she ever is made to fear my passion, and to shrink from
the personal intimacies of her husband, home, from that hour,
becomes desolate and repulsive, no matter what may be the
natural or artistic elegance of our material surroundings. I

12
know that in proportion as she cherishes a loving and trusting
respect for all that constitutes me a man, will she lovingly and
calmly rest in the bosom of her husband; and that the most
sacred sanctuary of our home, instead of being an altar of cruel
and merciless sacrifice of her health and life, will be a fountain
of eternal life and peace to us both,âa temple consecrated to
all true manifestations of an unselfish conjugal and parental love.

I feel the responsibility that rests upon me. I would have my
wife associate my manhood with her own purity, and not with
my selfish gratification. I would have her assured that my
nature, as a man, is under the control of conscience and reason,
and held in subjection to her perfect development, and that of
our children. I would be an unselfish, noble husband, and a
true and happy father; a husband and father who can stand in
the pride and dignity of conscious nobility before his wife and
children. I would be a
Man
; one whose soul, vitalized and
ennobled by the presence and power of conjugal and paternal
love, shall never cower before its own consciousness, nor in the
presence of its God.

If you can give me your thoughts and feelings in regard to
parentage, and the relation that leads to it, you will confer a
favor on one whose love and respect for you will never end.

Yours,

A HUSBAND.

THE

CRIME OF AN UNDESIRED MATERNITY

Letters to a Husband.

LETTER I.

THE MOTHERâS POWER OVER HER CHILD.

My Friend
:

I have read your letter with deep interest. Your
inquiries respecting the mission of the sexes, and the
government of your passional relations with your wife,
seem right and proper, and what every man, who would
secure and perpetuate the love and respect of his wife,
and the purity and happiness of his home, will make,
and on which, above all other subjects, he will seek for
light. They shall receive frank and candid answers, so
far as I can give them. I thank you for proposing them,
as, in answering, I shall take occasion to give my views
on a subject which, of all others, most directly concerns
the organization and development, the character and
destiny of the men and women of the future, and which

14
involves the purity and peace of home, and the growth
and prosperity of society.

Here let me say, that on no subject should a man and
woman, as they are being attracted into conjugal relations,
be more open and truthful with each other than
on this. No woman, who would save herself and the
man she loves from a desecrated and wretched home,
should enter into the physical relations of marriage with
a man until she understands what he expects of her as
to the function of maternity, and the relation that leads
to it. If a woman is made aware that the man who
would win her as a wife regards her and the marriage
relation only as the means of a legalized gratification of
his passions, and she sees fit to live with him as a wife,
with such a prospect before her, she must take the consequences
of a course so degrading and so shameless. If
she sees fit to make an offering of her body and soul on
the altar of her husbandâs sensuality, she must do it;
but she has a right to know to what base uses her womanhood
is to be put; and it is due to her, as well as to
himself, that he should tell her beforehand precisely what
he wants and expects of her.

Too frequently man shrinks from all allusion, during
courtship, to his expectations in regard to future passional
relations. He fears to speak of them, lest he should
shock and repel the woman he would win as a wife.
Being conscious, it may be, of an intention to use the
power he may acquire over her person for his own gratification,
he shuns all interchange of views with her,
lest she should divine the hidden sensualism of his soul,
and his intention to victimize her person to it, the moment

15
he shall get the license. A woman had better die
at once than enter into or continue in marriage with a
man whose highest conception of the relation is, that it
is a means of licensed animal indulgence. In such a
relation, body and soul are sacrificed. âLet there be
lightâ as to what constitutes a natural, divine parentage!

I shall not, in answering your queries, attempt to
point out minutely what I think to be the fixed laws of
human nature for the government of human parentage.
I have some things to say to you, and to all who are,
or hope to be, husbands, respecting the
crime of an
undesigned and an undesired Maternity
. From what
I shall say on this subject, it may be that you will get
some hints as to the regulation of your passional relations
with your wife.

You are a husband; you hope to be a father, and to
make for yourself, your wife and children, a pure and
happy home, where perfect freedom, perfect love and
trust shall dwell, and where your entire nature shall
expand and be perfected in all purity and nobleness.
You would elevate and perfect the nature you bear in
yourself and in your children. This you hope to do,
not through your relations to Church or State, but
through your relations as a husband and father, and by
obedience to those laws of Nature which are designed to
control your life in those relations. As compared with
the question of
the right use of the reproductive element
,âits
bearing on the growth, elevation and happiness
of your entire being, in this and in all states of
your present and future existence,âall questions of

16
wealth, of reputation, of religion, and government, sink
into insignificance. Your treatment of your wife in
regard to Maternity, and to the relation from which it
results, must shape your destiny and hers, at home and
abroad. How can you respect yourself, knowing that
your disregard of her rights, in reference to this most
sacred function, has destroyed all respect for you in the
heart of your wife?

Maternity
is the subject under consideration. Ought
it ever to exist except at the desire of the woman, and
when her nature calls for it? Can it be right for man
to impose on her this most sublime and overwhelming of
all human responsibilities, when her nature recoils from
the burden? She is not prepared to take charge of the
germ of a new life, and to meet the suffering and the
responsibility of developing and giving birth to a child,
if her body and soul shrink from it. Under such circumstances,
can it be right for man to urge on her a suffering
and responsibility so much dreaded, or subject her
to the possibility of a maternity against which her soul
so earnestly protests?

It may be asked,âWhy confine the discussion to

Maternity
? Why not look at the broad question of

Parentage
, and include the responsibility of the father,
as well as of the mother? For the reason, that Maternity
holds a far more intimate relation to the organization
and character than Paternity. The mother has a
more direct control over human destiny than the father.
Woman is far more liable than man to suffer deep and
enduring wrong in the office of perpetuating the race.
Man, as will be shown, is generally the wrong-doer,

17
when wrong exists; to woman belong the suffering and
anguish. Woman is the victim; on man rests the responsibility.
Womanâs appeal is to man to spare her
this suffering and anguish, except when her nature calls,
and then will she, for his sake and her own, joyfully
meet and bear the cross. It is meet that womanâs appeal
should be sustained. I wish to sustain it; and in
so doing, while my remarks will bear mainly on Maternity,
Paternity will necessarily come under review.
Maternity, when a crime, suggests the questions, Who
is the criminal? To what extent is he responsible for
the consequences? So, in fact, the whole subject of
Parentage is open, as involving the conduct and responsibility
of both parents.

But, before proceeding to consider this wrong and
outrage upon woman, and its influence on her, I wish
to allude to two facts bearing directly on the subject.

1.
That which forms the body and soul of the
child must come to it, previous to birth, through the
maternal organism.

Pause, my friend, and contemplate this fact, in its
bearing on the birthright tendencies, the character and
destiny, of your child. You and your wife wish to have
a child. She prepares herself cheerfully and bravely to
bear the sufferings and responsibilities of Maternity.
The germ, so small when she takes charge of it, in a
brief space assumes the form of a human being, and is
increased in size and in weight hundreds of thousands of
times.

How did the substance reach it which constituted its
growth? Every particle of matter that reaches it to

18
form its brain, its nerves, its heart, its lungs, its blood,
its bones and sinews, was prepared in the maternal
organism, and was carried to it through the medium of
her blood. Whatever is received into her system, in
the shape of food, drink, air, and various gases, and
which goes to nourish her brain, heart, nerves, and other
organs, and keep them in healthful activity, must go
to form the corresponding portions of the childâs body.
The material that nourishes the brain of the mother
forms, from the beginning, the brain of the child; that
which nourishes the lungs and nerves of the mother
forms also the lungs and nerves of the child. So of
every organ and portion of the body. From whatever
the mother takes into her system must come the body
and soul of her child.

2.
This substance, as it passes through the maternal
system, must receive the impress of her mental
and physical conditions.

Ponder this fact, see its bearing on the character and
destiny of your child, of all children, and of the race,
and see if its importance can be over-estimated. That
it is a fact, in the science of Embryology and FÅtal
Development, is not denied. Whatever
temporarily

affects the maternal blood, must
permanently
affect the
organic conditions and constitutional tendencies, and of
course the post-natal character and destiny, of the child.
This is much insisted on by writers on the laws and
function of reproduction. Thus Carpenter, in his
âPrinciples of Human Physiology,â says: âThat
many of the organic functions are directly influenced
by the nervous system, is a matter which does not admit

19
of dispute,âsometimes in exciting, sometimes in checking,
and sometimes in otherwise modifying them.ââ(Sec. 946.)

Whatever, then, affects the nervous system, affects the
organic functions. That the nervous system is deeply
affected by the kind and quality of our food and drink,
and by mental impressions, cannot be doubted. Witness
the influence of tea, alcohol, opium, tobacco, and various
kinds of food, on the nerves, and also of anger, grief,
revenge, fear, love, hate, &c. As Carpenter says, âThe
influence of particular conditions of the mind in exciting
various secretions is a matter of daily experience.â He
instances the increased secretion and flow of saliva by
the idea of food, the secretion and flow of tears by joy,
tenderness, or grief, and the influence of the love of
offspring on the mammary secretions.

âThe sexual secretions,â he says, âare strongly influenced
by the conditions of the mind;â instancing the
effects of a âfitful temper,â âfits of anger,â âgrief,â
âanxiety of mind,â âfear,â âterror,â on the mammary
secretions, and showing that these emotions often so
poison the motherâs milk as permanently to affect the
health, and sometimes destroy the life of the nursing
child.â(Sec. 948.)

Weigh well the following sentiments of Carpenter:
âThat the mental state of the mother can produce
important alterations in her own blood, seems demonstrated
by the considerations previously adduced in
regard to its effects upon the process of nutrition and
secretion, and that such alterations are
sufficient to
determine modifications in the developmental processes

20
of the embryo
,
TO WHICH HER BLOOD FURNISHES
THE MATERIAL
, can scarcely admit a question,
when we recollect what influence the presence or absence
of particular substances has in modifying the
growth of parts of the adult.â In regard to cases
where children are marked before birth, he says: âThe
effect must be produced upon the maternal blood, and

transmitted through it to the fÅtus
, since there is no
nervous communication between the parent and offspring.â

On every hand, life is full of facts illustrative of the
influence of the mental and physical conditions of the
mother on the organic structure and constitutional tendencies
of the body and soul of her unborn child. As
the maternal blood is healthfully or otherwise affected
by what she eats and drinks, and by her mental conditions,
so will the organization of her child be healthful
or diseased. If the mass of blood from which the fÅtus
is nourished and receives its material for growth is filled
with disease, from any cause, the child must be similarly
affected.

This is a fearful fact, when viewed in its bearing on
the post-natal health and happiness of the child, and on
the character and destiny of the human family. One
can scarcely avoid the query, Is it just to place the destiny
of one human being so entirely in the power of
another? The power of the mother over her child,
previous to birth, is absolute. Through what she eats
and drinks, during gestation, she can fix the organic
and constitutional tendencies of her child to health or
disease, to good or evil, to happiness or misery, and thus

21
control its character and destiny after it is born, during
its infancy, childhood, youth and manhood. Not only
through the character of what she eats and drinks, but
through her
mental
emotions and conditions, through
her amusements, her anxieties, her joys, her sorrows,
her loves and hates, her exaltation and depression, her
hopes and fears, can she affect the birthright physical
and spiritual tendencies of her child, and thus control
its destiny. She may doom her child to drunkenness, to
lying, to revenge, and make him or her a thief, a liar, a
drunkard, a glutton, a miser, a warrior, a slaveholder, a
robber, a murderer, a pirate, or an assassin, before its
birth, and while it is all unconscious of the doom which
the mother is preparing for it, and totally incapable of
resisting the fatal influence that is shaping its destiny.

The mother has a fearful power. It is absolute for
good or evil. Terrible is the doom of that child whose
organization and development, before birth, were controlled
by the motherâs ignorance, folly, or hatred.
Emphatically, as she is true to herself, she is true to
her unborn child. It seems a mystery that the character
and destiny of a human being should so materially
depend on the food, drink, thoughts, feelings and passions
of the mother during that brief period; but such
is the fact, and we can only bow in silence to the fiat of
God, being assured that whatever power the mother has
for evil, she has the same for good; and that the question
whether she shall use that power for good or evil
over her child is one which may be settled mainly, if not
solely, by the father, as will hereafter be shown. I will
only say here, that the answer to the question, Will the

22
mother use her power over her child for good or for evil?
depends on the answer to a previous questionâIs her
maternity a willing or unwilling one? This question it
is generally in the power of the husband and father to
answer.

Now, my friend, contemplate the bearing of these two
facts on the post-natal character and destiny of your
child. The germ is placed in the maternal system, there
to be nourished and to be developed through the substances
conveyed to it by the maternal blood. Whatever
the mother eats and drinks directly affects the nutrition
and organization of her child. Whatever thoughts, feelings
and passions agitate her mind, leave their traces on
that which goes to form its body and soul. How important,
then, to the health, character and happiness, of
the future man or woman, that the mother, during gestation,
should receive into her system only the purest
and most healthful food and drink, and into her mind
only bright, cheerful, happy, peaceful thoughts and feelings!
To her husband, woman looks for sympathy and
support to enable her truly and bravely to meet this
great demand upon her nature. She should be encircled
by a tender, consecrating love. To the father of her
child she looks for this. Shall she look in vain, or be
left to bear the cross alone?

Thine,

HENRY C. WRIGHT.

LETTER II.

THE CRIME AGAINST THE MOTHER.âHOW IT AFFECTS HER TOWARDS THE FATHER OF HER CHILD.

My Friend
:

Before considering the wrong done to the mother, I
would state two points which I shall take for granted:

1. That parents, alone, are responsible for the
existence

of their children.

2. That woman, alone, has a right to say when, and
under what circumstances, she shall assume the office of
maternity, or subject herself to the
liability
of becoming
a mother.

These two positions seem to me so self-evident, that no
arguments can make them more clear and certain. Who
is responsible for the
existence
of children, God or the
parents? Who shall say how many children a woman
shall have, and under what circumstances she shall have
them, the wife or the husband? Who shall say how
often, for what purposes, and under what conditions, the
wife shall subject her person to a relation which renders
her
liable
to become a mother, and to the suffering and
anguish of developing and giving birth to a child? To
ask these questions is to answer them. Nature makes
but one reply, and that will be found in the consciousness

24
of every true husband and wife, and father and
mother.

What is the influence of an undesired maternity on
the mother, in regard to the father of her child? is my
first inquiry. What is it? It is felt, but seldom
spoken. It cannot be expressed in words, as it is felt
in the heart.

A woman comes into the relation of a legal wife. At
once, it may be, the husband reveals himself to her in a
way she did not anticipate, and she is made to know what
he expects of her, and for what he married her. She
yields her person to his passion, not in obedience to a
call in her own nature, but because she thinks that such
is the right conferred by law and custom on the husband
over the wife. She has, it may be, been duly taught
that the only way to secure and strengthen his love is to
yield to his passion, whenever it demands indulgence. So
she yields, and before she is aware, and before her mind
is prepared to meet them, the responsibilities, anxieties
and sufferings of maternity are upon her. Grief, anguish,
and a dread of some unknown, but terrible suffering, overwhelm
her. Consternation seizes the heart, so recently
buoyant with the hopes and joys of a loving and trusting
bride.

How will this new and dreaded experience affect her
mind towards her husband and the father of her child?
As a lover, he had been so gentle, so delicate, and so
considerate of her slightest wish, so thoughtful of her
happiness, and so unwilling to say or do anything to
grieve her spirit; as a bridegroom, he had promised to
love and cherish her as his own soul; and she fondly

25
trusted that no wrong or suffering would ever reach her
through him; when, behold! in the very beginning of
their united life, and before, physically or mentally, she
was prepared to meet the great demand, he has imposed
on her the necessity of yielding up her body and soul to
the keenest suffering to which she can be subjected; and
that without consulting her wishes, and contrary, it may
be, to her earnest prayer. As she ponders on her situation,
and the experience through which she must pass,
and from which death to herself, or her child, or to both,
is the only door of escape, how must she feel towards him
who has placed her in this fearful condition? He has
subjected her to the necessity, for weary months, of
drinking the bitterest cup of life, and of passing through
the valley and shadow of death, heart-sick, desponding
and shrinking from the final result; and all this, not
because she wished to be a mother, or he a father, nor
that they might blend their bodies and souls in a new
and beautiful life, to be an honor to themselves and the
world,âno such motive prompted the relation in which
conception originated; but solely his momentary gratification.
She feels that his indulgence was had at her
expense. No conscious pride and sense of matronly dignity,
no high and noble aspirations, sustain her, as she
reflects on her condition. Can she continue to love and
respect him? He has done her the greatest wrong. He
heeded not her prayers that he would control his passion,
and spare her until she was ready joyfully to enter upon
an office so grand in its nature, and so sublime in its
bearing on the destiny of an immortal soul. To meet
the responsibilities of such an office, and the physical and

26
mental pain and anguish necessarily pertaining to it, what
woman but needs a preparation? Who is sufficient for
these things? Yet the dread liabilities are upon her,
without a momentâs warning, and without, it may be,
any interchange of thoughts and feelings with her husband
and the father of her child. She knows not even
that he wants a child, nor whether he will receive it with
a blessing or a curse. She knows not what heart-support
she will receive from him in the moment of her trial and
her anguish. He has had no conversation with her on
these subjects, and given her no assurance as to the natural
results to her of his passional relations with her;
expressed no anxiety, no expectations, no hopes, as to
her liability to become a mother. He has had no further
wish or anxiety, except for his own selfish gratification.
He has, it may be, avoided, as indelicate and improper,
all allusion to questions so vital to the life and happiness
of his newly-wedded wife. All she has to rest upon is
the indefinite assurance, given before God and man, that
he will cherish, protect and care for her.
Why
he
promised to protect and care for her, whether as a mere
means of sensual gratification, or for holier and more
exalted purposes, she has no assurance. Not one word,
it may be, has he ever spoken to her respecting the
motives that have prompted him to seek her as a wife.
O, woman! woman! how dare you enter into such a
relation with a man, without knowing what he expects
of you?

The wife, in such a situation, cannot cherish loving
and tender thoughts of her husband when absent, nor
receive his caresses with rapture when present. She

27
bears in herself the result of the wrong he has inflicted
on her. It is ever present to her thoughts and emotions.
She cannot escape from it but by an outrage on herself
and child; and as, in her moments of solitary suffering
and anguish, she reflects on her condition, and why she
must endure them, how can she regard the author of
them with loving respect? The sense of the wrong done
her is ever present,âcan she tenderly cherish the wrong-doer,
especially when he continues to demand of her a
constant renewal of the relation in which her present
afflictions and forebodings of future sorrows originated?
She cannot; for he, by inflicting on her a maternity
which her own soul cannot sanction, and from which,
perhaps, she shrinks with horror, has rendered himself
unworthy of her love and respect.

It is in vain to urge a woman thus situated to love and
honor her husband. At no command of God or man can
she, as a wife, love and cherish him. Indeed, no wife
can love her husband at the word of command. If she
loves him at all, it is because she must, not because she
is ordered to do it. Her love will flow out to him as a
necessity of her being, not by the command of a third
party. If he has no power to call it out and concentrate
it on himself, it will not go out to him. Nothing can
force it out. She is not to blame if she does not love
him. She gives him all he has power to awaken and
call out,âall the love he has power to take; more he
has no right to ask, more she cannot give. Her love for
him will correspond to his lovableness in her eyes; he
will seek to render himself lovable to her, just in proportion
to the value he sets on her love. Expect no love

28
from a woman because she is your legal wife. The legal
bond can impose on her no obligation to love you; and
if it did, she cannot love you, if your person and your
passion become disgusting to her.

Would you, my friend, increase and perpetuate the
love and respect of your wife? Then beware how you
demean yourself towards her in regard to maternity, and
the relation that may, at any time, result in it. To a
true woman and a loving wife, maternity, and the passional
expressions of her husband, must ever be ennobling,
or degrading. It is for him to say which they
shall be. It is for you to say whether, as the father of
her child, you shall seem to your wife altogether pure,
noble and attractive, or selfish, ignoble and repulsive.
You must determine whether the mother of your child
shall see in you a generous, tender, kingly husband, all-worthy
to be the father of her child, and to rule over the
empire of her heart, or a mean, merciless tyrant, having
no purer or higher aim, in your relations with her, than
that of animal indulgence, and whom it is impossible to
respect. It is for you to say to what extent, and how
long, she shall love and respect you. She must love and
honor you, if you seem to her to be worthy; she cannot,
if you seem otherwise. How can you thus seem, when
she is made to feel that for your gratification, and against
her earnest appeal to you, as a man and husband, you
have imposed on her a burden which she feels unable and
unwilling to bear?

Maternity, when it exists at the call of the wife, and
is gratefully received, but binds her heart more tenderly
and devotedly to her husband. As the father of her

29
child, he stands before her invested with new beauty and
dignity. In receiving from him the germ of a new life,
she receives that which she feels is to add new beauty and
glory to her as a woman,ânew grace and attraction to
her as a wife. She loves and honors him, because he has
crowned her with the glory of a mother. Maternity, to
her, instead of being repulsive, is a diadem of beauty, a
crown of rejoicing, and deep, tender, and self-forgetting
are her love and reverence for him who has placed it on
her brow. How noble, how august, how beautiful, is
Maternity, when thus bestowed and received!

But, in proportion as it is holy and ennobling when
designedly conferred and joyfully received, is it unholy
and debasing, when undesigned and undesired. In proportion
as a motherâs heart overflows with tender gratitude
and loving reverence towards the father of her child,
when that child comes in answer to the call of her womanly
and wifely nature, will it be filled with aversion to
the father of a child which she did not want, and which
she is conscious is the result of a relation sought only for
a sensual purpose.

Many wives become indifferent to, or positively and
forever alienated from, their husbands, from this cause.
Nothing will so surely and so irrevocably destroy the
love of a wife for a husband, as a disregard, on his part,
of her feelings and wishes in regard to Maternity, and to
the relation from which it comes. In nothing are husbands
(through ignorance, I would fain think) so unmindful
of the entreaties and wants of their wives, as in these
respects. They often demand the surrender of their persons
without any inquiry into their feelings and conditions;

30
consequently, before they are aware, the very life
of God in their hearts,âthat is, their love and respect
for their husbands,âis crushed out of them. No wonder,
when we consider what liabilities, what a sense of
self-degradation, and what a shrinking of soul, are involved,
to a true woman, in a surrender of her person to
mere sensual passion, and to a maternity so dreaded. On
the contrary, how certainly and how permanently a husband
will secure the love and respect of his wife, and her
perfect trust, when he so treats her as to make her feel
secure that she is never to become a mother till her own
nature calls for it; and when, knowing his own nature,
he can assure her that he shall never subject her to the
possibility of that suffering till she is able and willing to
bear it!

When a woman once feels that the power of her husband
is controlled by a tender love and reverence for her,
and a desire to subject it to her growth and happiness,
rather than to promote his own selfish ends, she rests in
his bosom knowing no fear, assured that this very passion
will but intensify the holy love that encircles her. When
all fear of his passion is gone, her love and trust are perfected.
But let the fear of that once settle on her heart,
and her love is gone. Love and respect for the husband
cannot exist in the heart of the wife simultaneously with
a dread of his passion.

Would you, then, secure the love and trust of your
wife, and become an object of her ever-growing tenderness
and reverence, never impose on her a maternity
which her nature does not sanction; neither subject her
to the
possibility
of enduring the suffering incident to

31
such a situation. Assure her, by all your manifestations,
and your perfect respect for the functions of her nature,
that your passion shall be in subjection to her wishes,
and that she will never be made to endure the trials of
maternity, except at the call of her own soul. How tenderly
and reverently would she, under such an assurance,
regard your physical, as well as your mental and spiritual
manhood!

It is not enough that you have secured, in the heart of
your wife, respect for your spiritual and intellectual manhood.
To maintain your self-respect in your relations
with her, to perfect your growth and happiness as a husband,
you must cause your
physical
nature to be tenderly
cherished and reverenced by her in all the sacred intimacies
of home. No matter how much she reverences
your intellectual, or your social power, if she shrinks
with disgust from all contact with your person, if by reason
of your uncalled-for passional manifestations, you
have made your physical manhood disagreeable, and all
personal contact painful, how can you, in her presence,
preserve a sense of manly pride and dignity as a husband?
You cannot, if you respect yourself.

One distinctive characteristic of a true and noble husband
is a feeling of manly pride in the physical elements
of his manhood. His physical manhood, as well as his
soul, is dear to the heart of his wife, because through
this he can give the fullest expression to his manly
power. But if such manifestations are made when the
wife is not prepared to receive them, and when she repels
them and dreads the consequences, his physical nature
becomes associated, not with the pure joy of a longed-for

32
maternity, but with a deep sense of shame and degradation,
with an outrage on her nature, and with the protracted
suffering and anguish of an abhorred maternity.
How can she respect the person of her husband? How
can she cherish, and proudly care for, the purity, health
and comfort of his physical nature? He has made it
disgusting to her. She regards it as the deadliest enemy
of her purity and peace as a wife, and as the bane of her
home. She cannot look upon his person but as the source
of her degradation and ruin. In its presence, she feels as
in the presence of some hated reptile, from which her soul
and senses shrink. How can she lovingly cherish and
care for it? How can the husband respect himself, when
by his own abuse of his wife and of himself, he has made
his physical manhood thus contemptible to her?

How can you, my friend, avoid this? How can you
secure for your person the loving care and respect of
your wife? There is but one way; so manifest yourself
to her, in the hours of your most endearing intimacies,
that all your manly power shall be associated only
with all that is generous, just and noble in you, and
with purity, freedom and happiness in her. Make her
feel that all which constitutes you a man, and qualifies
you to be her husband and the father of her children,
belongs to her, and is sacredly consecrated to the perfection
and happiness of her nature. Do this, and the happiness
of your home is made complete in righteousness.
Your
body
will be lovingly and reverently cared for,
because the wife of your bosom feels that it is the sacred
symbol through which a noble, manly love is ever speaking
to her, to cheer and sustain her.

33
Woman is ever proud, and justly so, of the manly
passion of her husband, when she knows it is controlled
by a love for her, whose manifestations have regard
only to her elevation and happiness. The very power
which, when bent only on selfish indulgence, becomes a
source of more shame, degradation, disease and wretchedness,
to women and to children, than all other things
put together, does but ennoble her, add grace and glory
to her being, and concentrate and vitalize the love that
encircles her as a wife, when it is controlled by wisdom,
and consecrated to her highest growth and happiness,
and that of her children. It lends enchantment to
her person, and gives a fascination to her smiles, her
words and her caresses, which ever breathe of purity
and of heaven, and make her all lovely as a wife and
mother to her husband and the father of her child.
Manly passion is to the conjugal love of the wife like
the sun to the rosebud, that opens its petals, and
causes them to give out their sweetest fragrance, and
to display their most delicate tints; or like the frost,
which chills and kills it ere it blossoms in its richness
and beauty.

Beware, then, how you perpetrate this wrong against
your wife, as you would secure her love and respect.
Trifle not with the function of Maternity in her; for as
this comes to her as the crowning joy and glory of her
earthly existence, or otherwise, will be her estimate of
you as her husband and the father of her children. See
to it that she is never subjected to the possibility of
becoming a mother unless she calls for it, and is ready
with joy to assume the responsibilities of maternity.

34
But I will let woman tell her own story. She can
speak on such a theme, and tell her own needs and
wrongs, as no man can. The following extracts from a
private letter will give you an insight into the wants
and feelings of a wife and mother in regard to this subject.
When woman speaks of her feelings while suffering
an undesired maternity, let man reverently give
heed to her words:

âMy maternal experience has been varied. I have never been
the recipient of a
designed
maternity, but I have that within me
which gives me an idea of what its joy and blessedness might be.
I have never been forced, with
entire
repugnance on my part,
into the relation which resulted in conception; and yet I have
suffered the keenest agonies in view of such a result.

âIn the first years of my married life, I had no thought but
to submit to the passion of my husband, without regard to the
consequences to myself. As every true woman does, living in
conjugal relations, I desired to be caressed by my husband, and
to be pressed to his manly bosom. I did not suppose it was
incumbent on him to control himself.

âIn an unwelcome maternity, I have
sometimes
felt a deep
repugnance to the passion of my husband,âa sense of deep suffering
and anguish through it; but I have usually been so encircled
by love as to make me forget this, or rather, shun such
thoughts as sinful. But since my husband and I have come to
a truer knowledge of parentage, I have come to âlove, honor and
cherishâ those functions which I had before only feared and
obeyed. I think this is not the feeling that married women
usually have towards the physical manhood of their husbands.
I never heard a woman admit that her thoughts rested on the
physical nature of her husband with loving respect and womanly
pride: but I have heard, not unfrequently, expressions of disgust
instead.

âI have known many instances in which the fathers of children,
unintentionally and unwillingly conceived, became so

35
repulsive to the mother, during gestation, that they would be
made seriously ill by coming in contact with them, in any way;
though ordinarily they would be agreeable and congenial.

âI have heard many women say they would gladly strangle
their children, born of undesired maternity, at birth, could they
do so with safety to themselves. I believe, judging from a long
and intimate acquaintance with many mothers, and from much
conversation with them on this subject, that there are many children
whose existence is undesigned by their fathers and undesired
by their mothers. Yet among those heterogeneous and unnatural
combinations called marriages, there is enough love to produce
some tolerable specimens of humanity; and when there is any
thing remarkable in development, there will be found physiological
and psychological conditions sufficient to produce it.

âNo words can express the helplessness, the sense of personal
desecration, the despair, which sinks into the heart of woman
when forced to submit to maternity under adverse circumstances,
and when her own soul rejects it. It is no matter of wonder
that abortions are purposely procured; it is to me a matter of
wonder that a single child, undesignedly begotten and reluctantly
conceived, is ever suffered to mature in the organism of the
mother. Her whole nature repels it. How can she regard its
ante-natal development but with sorrow and shrinking?

âSensitive as woman ever is at such periods, she rarely meets
with any special consideration; indeed, that very situation is
too often made the occasion for increased passional indulgence
on the part of the husband, or of neglect and contempt. Woman
must have had, doubtless has, a very large amount of what you
call the God-element in her nature, to enable her to do as well
as she does in the function of Maternity, under such debasing
and depressing influences.

âThe strength and energy of body and mind which were required
properly to develop and give birth to
one
child, have been
often taxed to conceive and develop six or eight, or perhaps ten
or twelve. Would it not be well to study economy in the function
of Parentage, as well as in some other departments of domestic
life?

36
âThere are few, very few, wives and mothers who could not
reveal a sad, dark picture in their own experience, in their relations
to their husbands and their children. Maternity, and the
relation in which it originates, are thrust upon them by their
husbands, often without regard to their spiritual or physical
conditions, and often in contempt of their earnest and urgent
entreaties. No joy comes to their hearts at the conception and
birth of their children, except that which arises from the consciousness
that they have survived the sufferings wantonly and
selfishly inflicted on them.

âThere are facts enough illustrating the dire effects of an
undesigned and an undesired maternity to move the whole earth
to sorrow and repentance, if woman, as a wife and mother,
dared give utterance to the wrongs inflicted upon her and her
children. The living illustrations of womanâs wrongs, inflicted
on her in the holy of holies of her home, by those who had
promised to âlove, cherish and protectâ her, do now fill the earth.
To the influences bearing on the unborn babe, in consequence
of the disregard, by the husband, of the conditions and wishes of
the wife in reference to maternity, and the intercourse that
leads to it, must we go to learn the causes of much of the wrong
and suffering of this world.â

When womanâs rights in regard to Maternity, and to
the relation that leads to it, are truly understood and
appreciated by man, then, and not before, can marriage
become what it was designed to be,âa diadem of
beauty, a crown of glory, to the husband and wife, and
âthe power of God and the wisdom of Godâ unto salvation
to the generations of the future. Husbands! if
you would secure the loving respect of your wives, you
must reverently regard their protest against an undesired
Maternity.

LETTER III.

THE CRIME AGAINST THE CHILD.

Dear Friend:

In my last, I showed, at some length, the crime of
an undesired maternity against the
mother
; how it
affects her mind towards the father of her child; how
it tends to destroy all love and respect for him, instead
of increasing them; how it destroys her self-respect,
strips her of the conscious pride and dignity of a loved
and loving wife, and reduces her to the feeling and condition
of a degraded, self-condemned victim of legalized
sensualism. She feels polluted, degraded, outraged;
and that, too, through the very function of her nature,
which should have filled and thrilled her soul with conscious
pride and happiness.

The Crime against the Child.
âAllow me now
to direct your attention to this. Let the child of an
undesigned and unwilling maternity arise before your
mind. Ponder what life is, and how it is affected by
birthright tendencies,âphysical, intellectual and spiritual;
see what a struggle it is, at best, and how difficult
it is for those of the soundest bodies and healthiest souls,
happily and successfully to meet the conflict. Call to
mind the two great facts alluded to in a former letter,
viz.: (1) That whatever comes to the child
before

birth, must come to it through the blood and organism

38
of the mother. (2) That, as this substance passes
through her system, it must receive the impress of her
physical and mental conditions. Whatever
temporarily

affects her conditions, must
permanently
affect the character
and destiny of her child.

You may grievously wrong your child, and subject it
to physical and mental tendencies that may deeply affect
its character and happiness, during its earthly existence,
by subjecting it to the liability of inheriting the unhealthy
and imbecile conditions in which you and the
mother may be, at the time the relation was held in
which it originated. Mere sensual gratification was the
sole and single motive that prompted to the relation;
and even in that, your wife had no part. Her heart, it
may be, not only prayed against conception, as a calamity
more to be dreaded than death, but this very horror
of the consequences disqualified her to participate in the
relation, when it was entirely mutual, and truly and
rightly prompted. Her very soul shrank from it; and
she submitted to it merely to gratify you, or because she
had been taught to believe it a duty incumbent on all
women who enter the married relation,âa duty to
which she
must
submit, or be accounted a faithless wife,âregardless
of the wishes of her husband, and false to
her obligations as a wife.

Duty! Talk of
duty
in such a relation! A
duty

for a woman to submit to such a relation, when her own
soul not only does not sanction, but loathes it! A

duty
in a woman thus to lay her health, her self-respect,
and her very womanhood, on the altar of legalized sensualism!
A
duty
to become a prostitute,âa mere tool

39
of her husbandâs gratification! It is a horrid mockery!
As well talk to her of her
duty
to cut her throat! No
man, but a sensualist, could ever accept the surrender of
a womanâs person in such relation, when he knows it is
made without any call in her own nature, and merely to
satisfy his passion.

Your only object, it may be, in this relation, is
mere
sensual indulgence
. Not one thought or care for the
welfare of the child that may ensue enters your mind.
Consequently, you are utterly indifferent to your physical
or mental conditions, at the time. Your passion
being excited, your only aim is, its gratification. Your
wife may be in a state of utter prostration, physically
and mentally,âsevere toil, deep anxiety, sad disappointment,
or some torturing care, may have exhausted
her energies, and reduced her to a state of imbecility,
for the time being. Despite all this, she is liable to
conception. You heed not her conditions nor her wishes,
but demand indulgence, regardless of her happiness or
that of the child which may result therefrom. She submits,
rather than contend. Maternity ensues. The
mother imparts no vitality to the child in its conception.
It is conceived in weakness, is developed in joyless, lifeless
imbecility, or intense anguish. It is born an idiot,
or without sufficient vital force to develop it into life with
the ordinary energies and faculties of a man or woman.

On all hands, society is full of the victims of such a
relation,âof a maternity forced on woman when, from
various causes, body and soul are prostrated, and too destitute
of vital energy even for the ordinary demands of
daily life; how much more destitute of that fulness and

40
vigor of life, so necessary to the sublime and responsible
act of true and healthy conception! If ever the current
of life should flow with deep, concentrated, joyous energy
in woman, it should be in the moment of conception,
when she takes charge of the germ of a new and immortal
life, and enters upon the sublime and overwhelming
responsibilities of maternity. Then, indeed, she needs
that all the energies of her womanhood should be in most
perfect and healthful activity; then, if ever, she should
be filled âwith all the fulness of God.â

But not only are the vital forces of your wife exhausted
by other labors and anxieties, but your own energies
are, from various causes, prostrated. Yet, excited by
some artificial stimulant, and when the vital forces of
your manhood are powerless, you demand this relation
with your wife. Maternity is the result. What have
you done for your child? Imparted to it, not the true
life and vigor of your manhood, but its momentary imbecility.
Your child, it may be, is rendered imbecile in
body and idiotic in mind, solely through your fault.
You exhausted your life, and then gave that exhausted,
soulless life to your child. You exercised no wise and
manly forethought for your child. Its well-being entered
not into your designs; only your own gratification.
Hence, for your childâs sake, you used no exertions, by
abstinence from exhausting toil or enfeebling amusements
and indulgences, to exalt and perfect your physical
and mental energies; but by debilitating pleasures, by
sleepless nights, spent in pursuit of amusement, by dissipating
games, and by exhausting indulgences in the use
of narcotic and alcoholic drugs, drinks and food, you are

41
rendered imbecile to think, to feel, or to act. And these
conditions you entail on your child as its birthright, lifelong,
fearful legacy, from the effects of which no power
can rescue it. Can you do a greater wrong to your
child? Can you commit against it a greater crime? A
living death is its doom.

When should man be a
living
soul, if not in that
relation in which he originates a new immortal? In
that moment, so replete with human destiny, if ever,
every nerve of his being should be filled and thrilled
with that creative energy, that concentrated, vitalizing
power which said, âLet there be light, and there was
light;â and which says of creation, âHe spake, and it
was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.â So man,
in that moment of sublime consecration of his manhood
to its purest and most august function, should have a
great, energetic, living soul, in a living body. He performs
an act of deeper significance than that which gave
existence and glory to the sun and starsâan act, from
which is to arise a living soul, deathless as God in its
being, and capable of reaching unimaginable heights of
wisdom and love.

Your child has claims which you cannot, without injustice,
ignore,âclaims that reach beyond its birth, and
even its conception. Its first claim is, to a
designed
existence,
if it is to exist at all. Only in such an existence
can it hope for a true and noble nature. Only in a relation,
designed to give existence to a well-organized child,
can you exercise a true, rational, and tender forethought
for your offspring. The offspring of a relation held
merely for the gratification of one or both parents, of a

42
mere chance maternity, how can it but reflect with sorrow
and bitterness on the wrong of its parents? The
child, as it comes to years of reflection, feels degraded
in its origin. No lofty aspirations, no tender love, no
animating hopes, no earnest prayer, no deep, holy longings,
no vitalizing joy, no conscious pride and dignity, no
God, presided over the relation in which it originated;
but shrinking disgust in one parent, and brutal sensuality,
and indifference to its welfare, in the other. No

Gloria in Excelsis
was sung by angels or men over its
conception or birth; but sensualism, shame, anguish,
and, it may be, curses deep and bitter, attended its
entrance into life. What must a child, as it grows to
maturity, think of an existence thus begun, and of those
who could trifle with the deepest and most potent memories
of the past in their offspring? Would you thus
live in the hearts of your children? If not, then do
them not this foul wrong. On your part, let the existence
of your child be a
designed
and a
longed-for

existence. What proportion of cases of maternity result
from a relation held with a view to the development of a
child? Few, very few, compared to the number born.
The relation was held without any wish or design to
have a child; but solely with a view to sensual gratification.
Consequently, the child must inherit, to some
extent, the conditions the parents happen to be in at the
moment. The child is robbed of a pure, true, thoughtful
birthright, and is the offspring of reckless, selfish
passion, rather than of a tender, anxious, thoughtful and
far-seeing love. Never subject your wife to the possibility
of a maternity which, on your part, is undesigned,

43
and, on her part, undesired. Your reward will be great
and sure, in the ever-growing love and respect of your
wife, in the healthful and harmonious organization and
upward tendencies of your children, and in the consciousness
of an ever-growing tenderness and nobleness of
manhood in yourself.

The power of the mother over the child, after birth,
is conceded to be great; what, then, must it be before?
Who can estimate it? Reasoning from the facts I have
stated, we should conclude it to be absolute, and without
limit. For good or for evil, it must be great. The
organic and constitutional tendencies of body and soul to
health or disease, to good or evil, are settled previous to
birth. The character and destiny of the future man or
woman depend, essentially, on those ante-natal tendencies.
These depend on the influences that are brought
to bear on the child during that period. Whatever
agencies bear, injuriously or otherwise, on the mother,
must control the unborn child with greater and more
permanent effect. What influence has an abhorred maternity
on the conditions of the mother? It must be
great; but great as it is, it is still greater and more
abiding on the child. Its
post-natal
life will be more
affected by those ante-natal influences, than by all that
are brought to bear on it after its birth. The crime
against the mother is great, but the crime against the
child is greater, and more enduring and terrible in its
consequences.

When maternity is imposed on your wife without her
consent, and contrary to her appeal, how will her mind
necessarily be affected towards her child? It was conceived

44
in dread, and in bitterness of spirit. Every stage
of its fÅtal development is watched with a feeling of
settled repugnance. In every step of its ante-natal
progress, the child meets only with grief and indignation
in the mother. She would crush out its life, if she
could. She loathed its conception; she loathed it in
every stage of its ante-natal development. She cannot
love and cherish it, for nought, it may be, is associated
with its existence, from the beginning, but pain and
sorrow. Tender, cherishing, vitalizing love does not
preside over its conception and development, but grief
and anguish. Instead of fixing her mind on devising
ways and means for the healthful and happy organization
and development of her child, before it is born, and for
its post-natal comfort and support, her soul is intent on
its destruction, and her thoughts devise plans to kill it.

In this, how often is she aided by others! There
are those, and they are called men and women, whose
profession is to devise ways to kill children before they
are born. Those who do this would not hesitate to kill
them after they are born; for the state of mind that
would justify and instigate
ante-natal
child-murder,
would justify and instigate
post-natal
child-murder.
Yet, public sentiment consigns the murderer of post-natal
children to the dungeon or the gallows; while the
murderers of ante-natal children are often allowed to
pass in society as honest and honorable men and women.

The unwelcome child is ever before the mother. She
regards it as a sacrilegious intruder into the domain of
her life; an invader of the holy of holies of her being.
She had never called for it; it was thrust upon her, as

45
it were, by fraud and violence. Besides, it is the child
of one whom this very outrage has caused her to dread
or despise. The child is ever present to her, not as a
pledge of love, an answer to the earnest prayer of her
wifely soul, as a source of living joy and ennobling
hopes; but as a witness of her shame and degradation,
and of the great wrong done her by its father, and by
one whom she had loved and trusted, but to be betrayed.
She meets her innocent, unconscious babe, at every step
of its ante-natal development, with a frown, and beats it
back with threats and weapons of death.

What makes that mother feel so towards her unborn
babe? It is to her an
unwelcome
child. Maternity is
thrust upon her before she is prepared for it. Her body
shrinks from the suffering it brings to her; her soul
sanctions not, but abhors, its existence. God, speaking
through the body and soul of that mother, frowns on its
conception, its development, and its birth. Its mother,
and the God of its mother, are conspiring against the
health, the happiness, the character and destiny, of the
child, and of the future man or woman. How can that
child, as it comes to manâs or womanâs estate, possibly be
in harmony with God or man? Elements of strife were
incorporated, by its fatherâs agency, into its body and
soul, as its birthright inheritance.

It is vain to talk to her about cheerfully and joyfully
submitting to her condition, and, for her childâs sake, to
give it a loving, joyous welcome. She cannot, by an
effort of will, nor by any course of discipline, nor from
considerations of duty, compel her nature to acquiesce in
such a wrong to herself and her child, and willingly and

46
joyfully accept a maternity thrust upon her in contempt
of her dearest and most sacred rights, and in opposition
to her heartâs appeals for mercy. She finds no call in
her nature for a child; she cannot create it by an effort
of will. She is not yet prepared, mentally or physically,
to meet the sufferings and responsibilities of such a relation.
She can no more force herself into giving a loving
reception to that unwelcome child, and to that undesired
maternity, than she can force herself into a true love and
respect for the father of such a child, and the doer of this
wrong.

Just so far as she was accessory to its conception, and
a willing partner in the relation in which it originated,
she is responsible, and worthy of condemnation; but she
is not to blame for not joyfully accepting a maternity
thrust upon her without her consent. As well blame a
woman for not loving and respecting a husband thrust
upon her by parental, ecclesiastical, or civil authority,
and from whom, by the instincts of her nature, she is
strongly repelled. As well blame the flower for shrinking
from the mildew that blights it, or the dove for
shrinking from the vulture that would rend it.

War is declared between that mother and her child
before it is born; a war that must be lasting as life,âa
deadly conflict, to which the happiness, and, it may be,
the life of the child must be victimized. No efforts of the
mother of your child, after it is born, can make peace
between her and her child, and obliterate from its mind
all traces of the wrong done to it before it was born.
And this internal, organic discord, this war, must extend
to you, the father, as well as to the mother. The mother

47
cannot feel toward your child, thus originated, as she
would had her soul rejoiced in its conception, its development
and birth, with a pure, concentrated joy, which
such a maternity alone can bring. After the child of an
undesired maternity is born, pity for the helpless babe,
rather than a rapturous welcome to a longed-for treasure,
prompts her to care for it,âthough facts demonstrate
that a deadly hate in the motherâs heart can pursue the
offspring of such a maternity after it is born. Yet before
it is born, but one feeling fills her soul,âa feeling of
deep, settled hostility against its existence,âa feeling
that it has no right to be. Its existence is unsanctioned
and unconsecrated by its mother. The child struggles
into life against the spirit of murder in her heart. Talk
of a motherâs joy over such a birth! It is blasphemy
against Maternity.

Pause, my friend, and let your thoughts dwell on this
subject. You would exalt and perfect human nature.
You live but to people this earth with nobler types of
men and women. It is the only true and great end of
life. If you would labor for this sublime object, pause
and consider this crime, in its bearing on the mother
towards your child, and through her, on the character
and destiny of that child. Enter into and comprehend,
if you can, the feelings which an undesired maternity
must excite in the mind of your wife towards your child.
Measure, if you can, the wrong done your child by giving
it being under such circumstances. See its helplessness,
its innocence, and the crime you perpetrate against
it. Can that child love and respect you? Can it ever
forgive you? Can it ever be reconciled to you? In

48
vain you talk to such a child about filial gratitude and
obedience. It will answer by pointing you to
paternal

wrong, inflicted on its helplessness. Disobedience, ingratitude
and defiance are constitutional,âbred in its
bones, organized into every fibre of its being.

Consider well the power your wife holds over your
child, and over its destiny as a man or woman, and askâShall
that power be for good or evil? Shall it be
exerted to give your child a beautiful, healthy, vigorous
body, or a body corrupted and deformed by a painful and
loathsome disease? Shall it be used to secure to your
childâs soul tenderness, truth, justice, generosity and
nobleness, or wrath, revenge, meanness and falsehood?âto
impress on its moral nature the stamp of Divinity,
or the stamp of a thief, a slaveholder, a pirate, a murderer,
or an assassin?

It is for you, the husband and father, to answer these
questions.
Mainly
, if not entirely, you are to decide
whether this great power shall be a blessing or a curse
to your child. How?
Never impose on your wife a
maternity, except at the call of her own nature.
When
she is ready to take charge of the germ of a new life, and
can joyfully welcome the responsibilities and trials of its
development and birth, then, and
never till then
, impart
it to her. Then will a tenderness ineffable, a love that
is all-hoping, all-enduring and all-pervading, and a joy
unspeakable and full of glory, preside, like a wise and
loving Providence, over the conception, ante-natal growth
and education, and the birth of your child. A heart,
tender, loving and vigilant as the heart of God, will watch
over it for good. The perfection and happiness of your

49
child will be the one controlling motive of her life, and
whether she eat or drink, labor or rest, or whatever she
does, she will do all to the glory of that priceless and
most welcome charge you have committed to her care.

How ennobling, how imposing is Maternity, when thus
bestowed and thus accepted! How sublime its responsibilities,
how pure its joys! How heroic its sufferings,
how august its martyrdom, when thus joyfully and calmly
endured! There is no heroism of earth so imposing, so
sublime, and so full of glory, as that of Maternity, when
joyfully accepted, and lovingly and calmly endured! No
human act can be so potent and so lasting in its results.
But no agony is so appalling as that of a Maternity from
which the soul of woman shrinks with disgust and horror.

The character of individual and social man, and the
destiny of the race, are wrapped up in Maternity. Shall
a function so replete with suffering and responsibility be
imposed on woman, against her prayers and her tears,
merely for the momentary gratification of man? Manhood
as well as womanhood, cries out against the outrage.
All that is true and noble in man says, âForbear!â
Only that which is sensual, brutal, devilish, can perpetrate
this wrong against the mother and child, or approve
of it.

Woman would find rest and fulness of joy in man. She
rushes to him as to her tower of strength, to shelter and
be sheltered to love and be loved, to bless and be blessed.
A love that knows no fear, a trust that fears no danger,
lay her in his bosom, and prompt to and consecrate the
entire surrender of her soul and body to his manly keeping.
Will you call that man true, noble or honorable,

50
who can take advantage of a love so pure and a trust so
boundless, to impose on her a suffering and anguish, and
a responsibility, for which she is not prepared, and from
which her soul shrinks; thus placing her in an unnatural
position in regard to her child, and thus outraging his
own offspring, by giving it an existence loathed even by
the mother who give it birth? What shall be said of
the man who will commit a deed so atrocious? A husband
he is not; he ignores the first principles of a true
and noble manhood. He is but a selfish, disgusting sensualist.
A father he is not, deserving tender and loving
reverence from his wife, but an
ANIMAL
, whose brutal
gratification is the first law of life, and one whom neither
mother nor child can respect.

But I will reserve further remarks on this subject
until my next letter.

Thine,      H. C. W.

LETTER IV.

THE CRIME AGAINST THE CHILD, AS AFFECTING ITS ANTE-NATAL EDUCATION.

Dear Friend
:

In the preceding letter, I have shown how, and to
what extent, a maternity, undesigned by the father and
undesired by the mother, affects the organization, character
and destiny, of the child. I wish to pursue the
question still further.

Life is before you,âa long and happy one, I trust.
May it increase in goodness and usefulness as it does in
years! Your power is great, and will be greater. Already
the minds of thousands are deeply and permanently
influenced by you. I know that
Man
, and not institutions
or dogmas, is the object of your devotion; that the
all-controlling, ever present sentiment of your life is,
the
supremacy of man over his incidents
. I know that
you reverence man, not his incidents. You feel, and in
your life seek to embody the truth, that
man is eternal
,
his institutions transient and ever-changing. Man is the
great
fact
; his religious, social, governmental, ecclesiastical,
literary, monetary and commercial surroundings
are merely passing incidents of his existence, to be
changed or cast away as suits his growth and convenience.
Man is the substance, all else the shadow. The
appendages will be laid aside, but man will live, deathless

52
as God. You would never sacrifice man to his
incidents; the head to the hat, or the body to the coat,âthe
enduring substance to the passing shadow.

You see and worship God in man, not in his incidents.
In those relations which bear most directly and powerfully
on the development, purity and nobility of your
manhood, and on your character and destiny, you recognize
the most perfect manifestation of the Divine presence
and power. In them, the great thinking intellect
and pulsating heart of the universe,âthe God-element
of Nature,âspeak to you as in nothing else.

Of all your relations, which is most potent to develop
your manhood, to unfold to yourself, and to all, the hidden
wealth and depths of your being; to vitalize and
call into manly activity all the powers of your physical
and intellectual nature? Your soul promptly answers,
âThat of the
HUSBAND
and the
FATHER
.â No man
who has lived in those relations can doubt the truth of
your answer. God speaks to you through your wife and
child, as through no other being of the past or present.
Through those loved ones, He, as it were, renders himself
visible, audible, tangible to you, and you meet him
and talk with him face to face. They are his natural
prophets and messiahs to youâthe media through
which the God-element of the universe flows into you,
quickening and vitalizing, and arousing to energetic
activity, all the powers of your manhood. Through
them, an influence is thrown upon and around you,
which silently, but surely, defines and shapes your plans
of life, and quickens, expands, and ennobles your affections.
In them, a
Presence
is ever before you, whose

53
beauty and brightness illuminate your pathway, and
which is ever beckoning you onward and upward, and
breathing into your soul a desire and a daring to reach
the sublimest height of purity and nobleness. In
truth, you may say, in your wife and child are the
hidings of Godâs power, to form your character and shape
your destiny.

What, then, so important to you, as a true knowledge
and just appreciation of your relations as a husband
and father? As a husband and father, you can do more
to elevate and perfect the human type, and to save
yourself, than you can in any other relation: political,
ecclesiastical, commercial and social relations are insignificant,
in comparison. I know you live but to glorify
the nature you bear, and to enjoy that glorified nature
forever. Such being with you the chief end of existence,
I ask you to weigh, with candor and earnestness,
the following observations on
the Ante-Natal Education
and History of Man
. I have long been
accustomed to consider human beings in connection
with three states, and to think, speak and write on the
comparative influence of these states on their character
and destiny:

1. The state preceding birth, which I am accustomed
to call the
Ante-Natal
state.

2. The state between birth and death, or the embodied
state.

3. The state after death, or the disembodied state.
The two last, the
Post-Natal
spheres or states.

Religion, government, education, commerce, agriculture,
mechanics, literature, the press, the convention,âthese

54
hitherto, have confined attention, almost exclusively,
to human life in its post-natal spheres, embodied
or disembodied. They take up human beings,
after

they are born, and seek to do for them what they may
to promote their welfare; and much of the doing consists
in trying to undo what had been done for them in
the ante-natal state. To a great extent, in promoting
the education of children, this state has been ignored, as
having no connection with the character and destiny in
the post-natal spheres.

Come, my friend, go with me back to that which
Church and State have overlooked, and view human
beings between conception and birth. The period is
brief; but is it not important? Is it powerless? Are
no influences exerted and no events transpiring there,
of sufficient moment to render them worthy attention,
in considering the history and estimating the character
of the individual man or woman, or of states and
nations?

Many years since, the conviction was settled in my
mind, that that period, though so brief, and hidden from
observation in the very holy of holies of the temple of
life, has more to do in giving tone to our feelings, intensity,
activity and character to our passions and appetites,
direction to our thoughts and plans, and in moulding our
character and shaping our destiny, in the post-natal
spheres of our being, than all that is brought to bear on
us after we are born.
Our ante-natal history is
the key to our post-natal life.
There is not a
man or woman who is not a living witness to the truth
of this assertion.

55
I think it cannot be doubted, that much of the physical
disease and suffering, and much of the idiocy, insanity,
and mental and moral obliquity of our post-natal,
embodied state, is the result of our ante-natal organization.
Much, indeed, is done for us before the germs of
our being leave the
paternal
organism. They must, to
a greater or less extent, receive the impress of the
fatherâs conditions of body and soul; and he will do a
service to the world who shall show to fathers their
responsibilities in this matter. But
Maternity
is the
subject under consideration; and in discussing this, my
concern with the germ is after the mother takes charge
of it.
The period between conception and birth
is
that to which I would call your attention.

From a long and critical observation of facts, and a
persevering effort to trace the physical, intellectual,
social and spiritual conditions and phenomena of the individual
and social lives of children and adults, in the
many thousands of families in which, for a longer or
shorter time, I have been an inmate, I long ago came
to the conclusion, that to their
Ante-Natal Education
,
men and women are more beholden for their healthful or
diseased physical conditions, sufferings or enjoyments,
and for their mental and spiritual tendencies, their
peculiarities of temper and disposition, their aptitudes to
truth or falsehood, to justice or injustice, to love or hate,
to peace or war, to temperance or drunkenness, to forgiveness
or revenge, to sexual purity or impurity, to
happiness or misery, than to all the influences that are
brought to bear on them, after they are born, to whatever
age they may attain. These tendencies, whether

56
of body or soul, are mainly, if not entirely, organized as
fixed facts of existence in the individual man or woman,
in their ante-natal state. There is not a human being,
there never was one, and never will be, whose whole
life is not essentially, constantly, and in its minutest details
instigated and directed, more or less, by gestational
influences.

If this be so, where are we to look for the forming
and controlling causes of human character and destiny,
and of physical, mental, and spiritual idiosyncrasies?
Where shall we go to find the true foundations of biography
and history, and the controlling elements of all
religions and governments? Where go to find the mainsprings
of war, slavery, drunkenness, polygamy, licentiousness,
and of all the sufferings, anguish and woes of
marriage and domestic life, that arise from the abuse of
the sexual element? Where go to find the cause of a
repulsive and loathed maternity, and of the horrors
to which it leads? Where, indeed, but to the germs of
diseases, and the aptitudes to good or evil, that were
organized into the bodies and souls of men and women,
as fixed facts and elements of life, by influences that
were brought to bear upon them, through the maternal
organism, between the periods of conception and
birth?

This ante-natal education makes the man and woman,
the Religion and Government, the Church and State,
the social, educational, and commercial customs and institutions;
and whoever attempts to write the biography
of an individual, or the history of a Church or State,
without reference to that education, and its controlling

57
power over human character and destiny, fails to present
the whole truth. He fails to trace effects to their causes,
and must necessarily give a partial or perverted view of
the phenomena of life.

â
Maxima debetur pueris reverentia.
â [The greatest
reverence is due to childhood.] Thus sang the
Roman poet Juvenal, two thousand years ago. Reverence
childhood! If this be so important after the child
is born, how much more reverence is due to
ante-natal

childhood? Be thy hands clean, thy robes spotless, thy
looks, thy tones, thy mien, tender, sweet, loving, reverential,
and thy heart filled and thrilled with pure worship,
as thou enterest the temple of manâs ante-natal
life! With these feelings, enter with me the very
holy of holies of that temple, over which God spreads
his wings of tenderest love and highest wisdom, as protecting
cherubims and seraphims. Behold, there, the
unconscious future man or woman, in a process of gestational
organization and development, subjected to influences
over which he or she has no control, and receiving
a physical, intellectual, social and spiritual education
that is to decide the character, for good or evil, for happiness
or misery, in the great future that is opening
before them.

See what a future is wrapped up in that unconscious
embryo man or woman! It may be that the fates of
states and empires are being inscribed, by some unseen
power, on that body and soul. Already that unformed
child may hold in its grasp the destinies of millions and
of ages. But who is the educator? Who guides the
pen that is inscribing peace or war, liberty or slavery,

58
life or death, to those millions and those ages, and the
scroll of destiny to states and kingdoms, to religions and
governments on the soul of that unborn babe?
The
mother.
Through her must come every element essential
to constitute the body and soul of that child; and,
as it passes through her system, it must receive the
stamp of her physical, social and spiritual conditions.

Keep in mind the great fact, that the mental states
of the mother, during gestation, must necessarily and
permanently affect every particle of that substance which
goes to make the organization and growth of her child,
for good or evil. Whatever injuriously affects her
thoughts and feelings, must permanently affect the
physical, social, intellectual and moral aptitudes of her
child.

Suppose that you have, undesignedly and without her
consent, imposed maternity on your wife. On discovering
the fact, it becomes most repulsive to her nature.
She is not prepared to bear the cross and endure the
crucifixion. Instantly, her soul is filled with murderous
intent. She resolves to nip and crush the opening bud
of life,âto procure abortion,âthat is, to commit the
deed of ante-natal child-murder. She does not feel that
it is
her
child. She may regard it as
yours
, but she
cannot acknowledge it as her own; and though it must
receive its gestational development in her organism, she
cannot tenderly and lovingly cherish and guard it, as
bone of her bone, flesh of her flesh, and soul of her soul.
It is so
in fact
, but not in her
feelings
. She asked not
for it; her soul repels it as an intruder, thrust upon her
without her consent, and in contempt, it may be, of her

59
earnest remonstrance,âfor thus it often is. The child,
she feels, has no right to an existence at her expense,
and who shall say it has? An uninvited and hated
intruder is exhausting her vital energies, and robbing
her of that which no earthly treasures can ever restore
or recompense. Through her physical suffering and
mental anguish, an unbidden and loathed guest is feeding
and thriving on her heartâs blood. Desperation, and
the bitterness of death, are in her heart.
Murder
fills
her soul towards your unconscious and innocent babe.

Who is responsible? On whom rests the guilt? It
is your work. You forced that heavy burden upon her,
and compelled her to bear it. You thrust your child, as
an intruder, into the sacred domain of her life, to derive
existence through her organism and at her expense,
knowing that she was not prepared to welcome it, and to
bend the forces of her nature to its growth and support;
and contrary, it may be, to her earnest entreaties that
she might be spared this pain and anguish till she was
ready joyfully to welcome them. But you heeded not
her prayer; you assumed the right to decide for her when
she was prepared to endure these trials, and under what
circumstances she should be a mother. You must have
your stated gratification; you have abused your manhood
and your wife, till this indulgence, as you think,
has become as essential a want of your life as your daily
food,âas the drunkard feels that alcohol is as essential
as air to his existence and happiness; and so you impose
on her a maternity which her soul abhors. You horribly
tax her vital energies, â
without her consent
.â
Murder is in her heart towards the uninvited and hated

60
intruder you have introduced into the sanctuary of her
life.

That mother, whose heart is thus filled with murder
towards your child, is its educator! Into her hands you
committed its destiny; and in the very act of so doing,
you aroused in her heart the spirit of murder against the
unconscious, innocent being whom she is to nourish into
life. In the very act of committing the germ of the
new immortal to her, you destroyed in her the power to
be its loving, nursing mother. You knew that she
would not and could not love and reverence it, and do
justice to it; that she would hate it, and kill it if she
could. All this you knew, yet you forced the charge
upon her!

Suppose your child were born; would you commit its
education and destiny to one, who, as you knew, would
cherish murder in her heart towards it, who would âget
rid of itâ (as the phrase is), i.e., kill it, if she could
without injury to herself,âyes, and kill it although at
the risk of death to herself, such being her dread and
her loathing of the charge? You would, yourself, be
the murderer, if you did. Should you commit the
post-natal

education and happiness of your child to such a
woman, knowing her utter repugnance to the charge,
and her determination to âget rid of itâ if she could,âwould
you not be responsible for the consequences,
whether she killed it, or whether she preserved it alive,
only to infuse into it a deadly wrath and revenge towards
you, and towards all of human kind? You would.
You knew she loathed its existence when you thrust it
upon her, and that she would destroy the young life if

61
she could; and that, if it lived to grow up under the
training of such a spirit, it must be at war, in heart and
life, with all its surroundings, must be unloved and
unloving, hated and hating, and an object of anxiety and
dread to all with whom it might chance to be associated.

What else do you do, when you impose on your wife a
maternity unasked and abhorred? You commit the
development and education of your child, during the
most important and susceptible period of its existence,
to one who assures you she is not prepared for the
charge, who entreats you to spare her, and who loathes
the very thought of its existence. Every element of her
womanly nature, for the time being, recoils from its
presence in her system. She pleads that you would
spare her this burden, at this time, and until her nature
calls for it, and is prepared joyfully to meet the martyrdom
maternity must bring to her. Heedless of her
prayers, and, it may be, of threats of death to your
child, you demand the surrender of her person to your
passion. Maternity ensues. Murder enters her heart
towards your child at the same time. She tries to
âget rid of it,ââto murder it. She succeeds. The
young life you had committed to her care is nipped in
the bud, as you were assured it would be before you
resigned it to her keeping. Where rests the responsibility?
On you, primarily and mainly. You murdered
your own child, not, indeed, with your own hands,âyou
drove another to do the desperate deed, and that
other, your wife, who came to you with a loving and
trusting heart, to save and to be saved; and you, to
gratify your selfish passion, drove her to the commission

62
of the crime of ante-natal child-murder,âa crime that
must forever weigh upon her soul like a mountain of
guilt and shame; a deed, after the doing of which, no
true woman can ever, in this life, stand proud and stainless,
in conscious innocence and dignity, before the tribunal
of her womanhood. She has done a deed for
which great Nature can find no excuse but ignorance;
but which, even when done in ignorance, she regards as
a violation of her just laws, and punishes as such, with
appropriate penalties,âthe loss of self-respect, and the
consciousness of degradation.

Yet all this suffering, anguish, crime and conscious
degradation, you, the husband, have forced upon her,
solely for the momentary, and, under the circumstances,
most unnatural, gratification of your sensual passion,âa
passion which, when controlled by manly love and
wisdom, and held in abeyance to the health, purity, and
happiness of your wife and children, would bring only
honor to their hearts and to your home, but which, when
thus indulged without regard to the wishes and conditions
of your wife, and merely for your personal pleasure,
spreads crime, pollution, misery and death, all
around.

How dare you, how dare any husband, commit the
destiny of his child into the hands of one, who, as he
knows, thus loathes the thought of its existence? How
can you subject your child to the possibility of such a
gestational organization and development; such an ante-natal
education; or force upon your wife the suffering
and anguish of a loathed and hated maternity, or the
necessity of doing a deed from which the soul of every

63
noble woman must shrink with sickening horror? You
could not do this wrong to your wife and child, till your
manhood was sunk in the mire of disgusting sensualism.

A loathed and hated maternity! A woman, a mother,
shrinking with disgust and horror from the thought of
giving existence to her child! A motherâs heart throbbing
with murder toward the child over whose development
and education it is presiding! Do you say this is
strong language?âtoo strong? That it cannot be?
Do you say a mother does not, cannot, hate and loathe
her unborn babe? Why, then, does she kill it? Her
spirit is known by its fruit. Is not her whole soul bent
on its destruction, even at the risk of her own health
and life?

âAbortion!â âGet rid of it!â Gentle terms,
these; respectable, no doubt, as some count gentle and
respectable; but used to cover a most foul, unnatural
deed.
Ante-natal child-murder
alone can truly express
the nature of the act. If no murderous hate is in the
motherâs heart, why does she kill the child? If you
saw a mother seeking to kill her child after it was born,
knowing that she did it because its existence was hateful
to her, and because she did not wish to bear the burden
of its nursing and training, would you not conclude that
her heart was filled with murder towards it? So when
a woman is willing to imperil her own life, to outrage
every womanly element of her being, and forfeit the
conscious innocence and respect of her own soul, to inflict
death upon her unborn child, you may be sure that a
deep and terrible loathing and hatred are in her heart

64
towards the new and expanding life which the husband
for mere sensual gratification, has thrust upon her.

What means the wide-spreading disposition among
men and women to procure and to palliate the murder
of children before they are born? One thing is surely
indicated by it, namely, the
increasing
sensualism of
men, and their determination to gratify it without regard
to consequences to their wives and children. It is a swift
witness against their purity and nobleness, and shows an
utter recklessness in the pursuit of sensual pleasure. It
also opens the frightful depths to which woman can fall
and has fallen. How many women of New England
have on their souls, at this hour, the ineffaceable stain
of ante-natal child-murder? How many bear in their
physical organism the incurable results of this crime?
How many families are now suffering from it? Go ask
the men and women doctors, who, for gold, perpetrate
this crime, and who shamelessly advertise their infamy.
Tens of thousands of wives and mothers are to be seen,
all over the country, at once the perpetrators and victims
of this cruel and disgusting act; all, all to administer to
the sensualism of men, who are called
husbands
! Husbands!
the guilt is mainly yours; and the damnation is
just. Beneath your foul wrong to their nature, your
wives sink, and you must go down with them.

Ponder the following extract from a private letter,
containing the experience of a wife and mother, in regard
to enforced and hated maternity and ante-natal
child-murder. The letter is of recent date; the writer
and her family are known to me personally:

65
âBefore we married, I informed him [the husband] of my
dread of having children. I told him I was not yet prepared to
meet the sufferings and responsibilities of maternity. He
entered into an arrangement to prevent it, for a specified time.
This agreement was disregarded. After the legal form was
over, and he felt that he could now indulge his passion without
loss of reputation, and under legal and religious sanctions, he
insisted on the surrender of my person to his will. He violated
his promise at the beginning of our united life. That fatal
bridal night! it has left a cloud on my soul and on my home,
that can never pass away on earth. I can never forget it. It
sealed the doom of our union, as it does of thousands.

âHe was in feeble health; so was I; and both of us mentally
depressed. But the sickly germ was implanted, and conception
took place. We were poor and destitute, having made no preparations
for a home for ourselves and child. I was a stricken
woman. In September, 1838, we came to ââ, and settled
in a new country. In the March following, my child, developed
under a heart throbbing with dread and anguish at the thought
of its existence, was born. After three monthsâ struggle, I became
reconciled to my, at first, unwelcome child. But the impress
of my impatience and hostility to its existence, previous to
its birth, was on my child, never to be effaced; and to this hour,
that child is the victim of an undesired maternity.

âIn one year, I found I was again about to be a mother. I
was in a state of frightful despair. My first-born was sickly and
very troublesome (how could it be otherwise?), needing constant
care and nursing. My husband chopped wood for our support.
Of the injustice of bringing children into the world to such
poverty and misery, I was then as sensible as now. I was in
despair. I felt that death would be preferable to maternity
under such circumstances. A desire and determination to get
rid of my child entered into my heart. I consulted a lady
friend, and by her persuasion and assistance, killed it. Within
less than a year, maternity was again imposed upon me, with no
better prospect for doing justice to my child. It was a most
painful conviction to me; I felt that I could not have another

66
child at that time. All seemed dark as death. I had begged
and prayed to be spared this trial again, till I was prepared to
accept it joyfully; but my husband insisted on his gratification,
without regard to my wishes and conditions.

âI consulted a physician, and told him of my unhappy state
of mind, and my aversion to having another child, for the present.
He was ready with his logic, his medicines and instruments,
and told me how to destroy it. After experimenting on
myself three months, I was successful. I killed my child about
five months after conception.

âA few months after this, maternity was again forced upon
me, to my grief and anguish. I determined, again, on the
childâs destruction; but my courage failed as I came to the
practical deed. My health and life were in jeopardy; for my
living childâs sake, I wished to live. I made up my mind to do
the best I could for my unborn babe, whose existence seemed so
unnatural and repulsive. I knew its young life would be deeply
and lastingly affected by my mental and physical conditions. I
became, in a measure, reconciled to my dark fate, and was as
resigned and happy as I could be under the circumstances. I
had just such a child as I had every reason to expect. I could
do no justice to it. How could I?

âSoon after the birth of my child, my husband insisted on his
accustomed indulgence. Without any wish of my own, maternity
was again forced upon me. I dared not attempt to get
rid of the child, abortion seemed so cruel, so inhuman, unnatural,
and repulsive. I resolved again, for my childâs sake, to do
the best I could for it. Though I could not joyfully welcome, I
resolved quietly to endure, its existence.

âAfter the birth of this child, I felt that I could have no
more to share our poverty and to suffer the wrongs and trials of
an unwelcome existence. I felt that I had rather die at once,
and thus end my life and my power to be a mother together.
My husband cast the entire care of the family on me. I had
scarcely one hour to devote to my children. My husband still
insisted on his gratification. I was the veriest slave alive. Life

67
had lost its charms. The grave seemed my only refuge, and
Death my only friend.

âIn this state, known as it was to my husband, he thrust
maternity upon me twice. I employed a doctor to kill my
child, and in the destruction of it, in what should have been the
vigor of my life, ended my power to be a mother. I was shorn
of the brightest jewel of my Womanhood. I suffered, as woman
alone can suffer, not only in body, but in bitter remorse and
anguish of soul.

âAll this I passed through, under the terrible, withering consciousness,
that it was all done and suffered solely that the passion
of my husband might have a momentary indulgence. Yet
such had been my false religious and social education, that, in
submitting my person to his passion, I did it with the honest
conviction that, in marriage, my body became the property of
my husband. He said so; all women to whom I applied for
counsel, said it was my duty to submit, that husbands expected
it, had a right to it, and must have this indulgence, whenever
they were excited, or suffer; and that in this way alone could
wives retain the love of their husbands. I had no alternative but
silent, suffering submission to his passion, and then procure
abortion, or leave him, and thus resign my children to the tender
mercies of one with whom I could not live myself. Abortion
was most repulsive to every feeling of my nature. It seemed
degrading, and, at times, rendered me an object of loathing to
myself.

âWhen my first-born was three months old, I had a desperate
struggle for my personal liberty. My husband insisted on his
right to subject my person to his passion, before my babe was
two months old. I saw his conduct then in all its degrading and
loathsome injustice. I pleaded, with tears and anguish, for my
own and my childâs sake, to be spared; and had it not been for
my helpless child, I should then have ended the struggle by bolting
my legal bonds. For its sake, I submitted to that outrage,
and to my own conscious degradation. For its sake, I concluded
to take my chance in the world with other wives and
mothers, who, as they assured me, and as I then knew, were

68
all around me, subjected to like outrages, and driven to the degrading
practice of abortion.

âBut, even then, I saw and argued the justice of my personal
rights in regard to Maternity, and the relation that leads to it,
as strongly as you do now. I saw it all as clearly as you do.
I was then, amid all the degrading influence that crushed me,
true and just in my womanly intuitions. I insisted on my right
to say when and under what circumstances I would accept of
him the office of Maternity, and become the mother of his child.
I insisted that it was for me to say when and how often I should
subject myself to the liability of becoming a mother. But he
became angry with me; claimed ownership over me; insisted
that I, as a wife, was to submit to my husband, â
in all things
;â
threatened to leave me and my children, and declared I was not
fit to be a wife. Fearing some fatal consequence to my child or
to myself, being alone, destitute, and far from helpful friends,
in the far West, and fearing that my little one would be left to
want, I stifled all expressions of my honest convictions, and
ever after kept my aversion and painful struggles in my own
bosom.

âIn every respect, so far as passional relations between myself
and husband are concerned, I have ever felt myself to be a miserable
and abject woman. I now see and feel it most deeply
and painfully. If I was with a child in my arms, I was in constant
dread of all personal contact with my husband, lest I
should have a new maternity thrust upon me, and be obliged to
wean one child before its time, to give place to another. In my
misery, I have often cried out, âO God! is there no way out of
this loathsome bondage?â

âIt was not want of kindly feelings towards my husband that
induced this state of mind, for I could and did endure every privation
and want without an unkind feeling or word, and even
cheerfully, for his sake. But every feeling of my soul did then,
does now, and ever must, protest against the cruel and loathsome
injustice of husbands towards their wives, manifested in imposing
on them a maternity uncalled for by their own nature and

69
most repulsive to it, and whose sufferings and responsibilities
they are unprepared and unwilling to meet.

âYours,

âââ ââ.â

âStrong language!âââToo strong and sweeping
epithets!â Can you, as a man, a husband and a father,
read the above extract, and feel or say that my language
is too strong? The above is the experience of a living
wife and mother, nearly
verbatim
as written by herself.
It is a simple, unvarnished, affecting story, but bearing
on its face the stamp of truth, and the evidence of a sense
of conscious injustice inflicted by the husband, and of a
degradation self-inflicted, solely to escape what seemed to
her a greater evil. Can such âloathsome injustice,â on
the part of husbands and fathers, towards their wives and
unborn children, be reprobated in too strong terms?

Husbands! it is your licentiousness that drives your
wives to a deed so abhorrent to their every wifely,
womanly and maternal instinct; a deed which ruins the
health of their bodies, prostitutes their souls, and makes
marriage, maternity, and womanhood itself, degrading
and loathsome. No terms can sufficiently characterize
the cruelty, meanness, and disgusting selfishness and
injustice of your conduct, when you impose on them a
maternity so detested as to drive them to the desperation
of killing their unborn children, and often themselves.

Is it a wonder that wives seek to justify themselves in
resorting to ante-natal child-murder? I do not wonder
at it. The wonder is, that a woman should live one
hour, as a wife, with one who imposes on her a repulsive
maternity, thus doing to her, and her child, the greatest

70
possible wrong; or who can, for one moment, subject
her to the liability of becoming a mother, when her own
nature repels the office. One such maternity, imposed
after the husband knows that his wife shrinks from it,
should lead every woman to âbolt the legal bondâ that
binds her to such a man. If she does not, but submits
to the injustice, she wrongs her child, her husband, and
her own soul. The same plea may be offered in extenuation
of ante-natal child-murder, under circumstances
of enforced, repulsive maternity, that is offered in justification
of Margaret Garner, the fugitive-slave mother,
who cut the throat of one child and threw another into
the river, to save them from the savage clutch of licensed
kidnappers.

Ante-natal child-murder,âa mother killing her
unborn babe to save it from a worse doom!
It is
a fearful alternative; one whose results to the soul of
the mother are no less deadly than to the forming body
of her child. It prostitutes, crucifies, murders, whatever
is pure, lovely, wifely, motherly and womanly in
her soul; and, for the time being, as it were, blots from
it the superscription and image of God. She murders
her unborn babe, and often herself, to save herself and
child from what she considers a more loathsome and
repulsive doom. Who can harshly and coarsely condemn
her? She feels that death to herself and babe, at her
own hands, is far preferable, and less criminal, than a
loathed maternity, and the birth of an unwelcome and
hated child. To save herself and child from slavery, the
slave mother cuts its throat, and then her own. The
wife, to save herself and child from what she regards as

71
a no less horrible doom, imposed by the husband, destroys
her unborn child, and brings death to her own soul, if
not to her body.

O man! where is thy manhood, that thou canst inflict
this wrong on the woman, who, with an all-trusting love,
lays herself in thy bosom, reposing fearless confidence in
thy manly love and power to shelter her from harm?
Husband! where is thy love, thy justice, thy tenderness,
thy manliness, thy conscience, thy God, that thou
canst impose these sufferings and responsibilities on thy
wife, despite her tears and entreaties to be spared till
she is ready joyfully to welcome them for thy sake and
her own? Fathers! where is your reverence for your
offspring, your tender regard for the claims of your
unborn children, and your respect for all that qualifies
you to be fathers and your wives mothers, that you beget
children to ante-natal murder, or to the, if possible, more
terrible doom of an existence undesired, and abhorrent to
the mothers that bore them?

Husbands! listen to the voice of God, speaking to
you through your wives, and, in the name of those most
dear to your hearts, and, most essential to the happiness
and glory of your life and your homes, give heed to
their protests against an undesigned and repulsive
maternity!

LETTER V.

THE WIFEâS APPEALâTHE HUSBANDâS RESPONSE.

Dear Friend
:

In the three preceding letters, I have endeavored to
present to you the crime of an undesigned and undesired
Maternity, especially in its bearing on the mother and
the child. I have shown how it wrongs the mother by
crushing out of her heart her love and respect for her
husband, and converting them into a settled feeling of
bitterness and contempt: and also by filling her with
feelings of murderous hostility towards her child, and
driving her to deeds which her soul abhors,âthus
destroying her self-respect, and making her to seem like
a loathsome and degraded object in her own estimation.
I have shown, also, how it wrongs the child, by depriving
it of a motherâs loving sympathy, by forcing it into
an existence that is detested by father and mother, by
stamping on it, before birth, disease and crime, and tendencies
to all that is evil, and thus subjecting it to the
detestation of its fellow-beings, in its future manhood or
womanhood. The father perpetrates the deepest crime
against the child, by committing its ante-natal education
to the hands of one to whom its very existence is her
abhorrence and loathing. What greater crime could a
husband and father commit against his wife and child?
None; no,
none
!

73
In this letter, I will give you the experience of a
husband and wife, as given by themselves, and by a
mutual friend, who is also a wife and a mother. I
extract from their letters with few omissions. See, in
the experience of this wife and mother, the deep, unutterable
anguish, and the deeper woe of conscious degradation,
to which woman, in her mistaken notions of conjugal
duty, her fear of losing a husbandâs love and
confidence, and her horror of an undesired maternity,
will subject herself. Read over her experience, as
detailed by her friend and herself, and then say if
any crime man can commit, can surpass that which
husbands and fathers often do to their wives and children,
merely for the momentary gratification of their
sensual passions:

âSome fifteen years ago, a man of culture, and engaged in
public life, was united in marriage with an intimate friend of
mine. With pride and confidence, he selected her from a large
and admiring circle of friends, as one embodying his ideal of
womanly excellence. My friend was thought a fortunate girl
(only seventeen), and many thought him quite as fortunate.
They were much in society, and she began to enjoy life intensely.

âShe was too much a woman not to desire offspring some
time, but she felt unprepared to have maternity forced upon
her youth and inexperience. It came at a time when her husbandâs
calling led him much from home, to mix in the society
she so much enjoyed, and which she felt was contributing to
make her what she so much desired to be,âher husbandâs
fitting and equal companion. It was not without a severe
struggle she resigned these advantages and checked her aspirations.
However, she submitted, though she keenly felt the
sacrifice.

74
âThough overwhelmed with the greatness of her responsibilities,
and an undefined dread of physical suffering, she was determined
not to appear weak, but bravely to meet and bear the
burden imposed upon her. Her husband was absent when the
trial hour came; but when he returned, he took his babe and
wife to his bosom with pride and joy, though its gestational
development had, apparently, scarcely given him an anxious
thought.

âMy friendâs future looked bright. She did not see or understand
the fact, that she was to continue to develop the germs of
human beings into life, with little sustaining help from the
father, whose caresses generally ended in exhausting her vital
powers by passional indulgence. She did not complain, but
rather rejoiced, as she saw her other powers of attraction to her
husband depart one by one, that she was so organized as to be
able to meet what she knew he considered an essential want of
his nature.

âEleven years passed, at which time she gave birth to her
sixth child. She was a devoted mother, of a joyous spirit, and
possessed of wonderful elasticity. But woman cannot be entirely
happy in maternity alone, without the presence and sustaining
power of her husband. If she is a true wife, she
desires to be more to her husband than merely the mother of his
children.

âHer husband made for her a beautiful material home, and
seemed happy when with her; but he was much away; he sought
other pleasures, social and intellectual, in which she could not
participate;âshe must stay at home, alone, with her children.
Little did he know the trials of patience and strength in his wife,
in being compelled to bear the responsibility of the health and
training of her little ones alone. The world called her a happy
wife, and she felt that she ought to be so; but a dark cloud was
coming over her once joyous spirit. She began to realize the
fact, so fatal to a wifeâs happiness, that her husband did not feel
her to be his equal, and a fitting companion to meet his social
and intellectual necessities. When he brought home a friend,
she listened to conversations and discussions in which she could

75
not participate. She felt keenly the growing distance between
them, and she knew too well how it had come about.

âShe quietly made up her mind to have no more children.
How did she propose to bring it about? Not by asking her husband
to deny himself his accustomed indulgence; no, that, she
thought, would be to cut herself off from her strongest hold on
his affection and confidence, and to sever the last link of the
chain that bound them together. She did not expect that any
precaution would enable her to escape conception. She brought
herself to do what was most repugnant to her nature, and which,
as she felt, would destroy her self-respect, and make her, in her
own estimation, a degraded woman, namely,
TO PROCURE ABORTION
.

âThe first shock given to her constitution by this abuse of her
nature was comparatively light. But once did not suffice. As a
longer interval passed without a new-born babe than ever before,
she had begun to take her place by her husbandâs side in society,
earnestly praying that she might be spared maternity evermore.
Her husband delighted to have her with him. He felt that he
had a right, by law and the customs of society, to his gratification;
he persevered in demanding it, and she continued to yield.
Several times in four years did she nip the young flower of fÅtal
life in the bud, and each time told more and more terribly on her
constitution, until the power of conception was nearly destroyed,
at little more than thirty-five years of age. She was shorn of
her Womanhood, and became a sickly, broken-down wife and
mother, in the very spring-time, as it were, of her life, being
driven frequently to perpetrate a degrading outrage upon herself,
or endure a maternity abhorrent to her soul;âand all to
gratify the sensual passion of her husband, thinking thereby to
secure his affection and respect. How fatally mistaken! By
yielding, she strengthened his
passion
, but not his love.

âReflecting on her sad experience, in the light of your book
on âMarriage and Parentage,â which I had placed in her hands,
she saw clearly where the wrong had been, but for a long time
felt powerless to destroy what she regarded as her last hold on
her husband. He was absent, and I prevailed on her to write

76
and lay the matter frankly and plainly before him, and send him
your book. She was then prostrated in body and soul by the
last outrage upon her womanly and maternal nature. She
wrote, and, hoping that you may do good with these letters, the
husband and wife have granted me the privilege of copying
portions of them for you. Here is a part of hers to him:

ââ
My dear Husband
:

ââI feel like lying down and weeping that I have become
unworthy, intellectually and spiritually, of mating with you;
but
love
is the foundation of true marriage, is it not? and I feel
strong in my love-nature. It is high, and deep, and rich, and
who shall say, if rightly cultivated, what flowers of intellect
and spirituality might not blossom out from its soil?

ââMy husband! forgive me if I say, that I deeply and sadly
feel that my Womanhood has been robbed of its most precious
charm, for
your
sake, through a weak indulgence and subjection
to that in you which is lower than the spiritual. My body has
been painfully desecrated, perhaps not more by your act than
mine. You suffer the loss of that refining and ennobling influence
which only an
undefiled
woman can impart to man.

ââIn view of our past, words cannot express my remorse and
self-condemnation; but believe me, the bitterest suffering is
caused to me by the knowledge that through this sin and misery,
I am rendered incapable of becoming to you a tithe of what I
desire to be. How can you do otherwise than shrink from the
wreck I am fast becoming? And though I may feel, in my moments
of anguish and remorse, that
you
are as much the cause
of my mental and physical wreck and imbecility as I am, God
grant I may not unjustly murmur or accuse you!

ââIt is said, âMen never love complaining women.â Alas!
if they treated their wives with half the respect and tender consideration
they do other women, there would be less ground for
complaint. I am convinced,
that in proportion as woman yields
to the demands of animal passion in her husband, in that same ratio
he loses his love and respect for her
. By bitter and humiliating
experience, this conviction is forced upon me.

77
ââMy husband! I love you. The power lies in you to bless
and save me; the power lies in me to bless and save you; but
have we not cursed each other instead? I cry unto you for life,âwill
you give me death? I would make my Womanhood a crown
of glory to your life, your Manhood to mine. Shall we allow
the very life-essence of our being to be exhausted in sensual indulgence,
till we lose the power to feel and appreciate a pure spiritual
love? My heart is reaching out to you for life, at the same
time that my body is suffering untold agonies from the outrages
perpetrated on my nature to escape the anguish and horror of an
unwelcome maternity; outrages which have polluted and humbled
my soul, and nearly destroyed my bodyâall for your sake;
that I might retain your love and respect.

ââI would rather lay down my life now, than live without
your love. Can we not love purely and nobly, without prostituting
that love in mere sensual indulgence? My soul would
arise and go to you as an inspiration from God; but I am suffering,
and a realization of my present condition, my physical diseases,
and mental anguish, and the knowledge that it was all
caused by having maternity put upon me when I was not prepared
joyfully to meet its trials and responsibilities, and the
consciousness of the terrible outrage that I have been driven to
perpetrate on myself and your unborn children, harden my soul,
and lower me in my own opinion, so that I do now feel, and shall
yet more deeply feel, if this function is still to be imposed upon
me, that I am unworthy to appear in society. But for the consciousness
that your passion has been, unconsciously and ignorantly,
it may be, the primary cause of my misery and conscious
degradation, I should scarcely dare to claim the right any more
to rest in your bosom as your wife. We have both erred.

ââYou love my person; you worship the
animal
in me. If
you love not my mind, my heart and soul more, and feel not more
reverence and worship for the God in me than for the animal, if
I am unworthy and unable to meet the wants of your intellectual
and spiritual nature,
PERISH ALL OUTWARD BONDS
! Tell me, have
I no power to hold you by any bonds but the sensualistic? Has
my soul no power over you? If this be so, let me no longer seek

78
to hold you at all. It crushes me, and overwhelms me with conscious
degradation, to feel that I have no power over your intellectual
and moral nature; that you come to me, caress me, and
call me
WIFE
, only that I may administer to your sensual pleasure,
and that you have no fond regard and loving adoration for
me, except for my mere outward, physical womanhood. I cannot
live so, feeling that your presence and caresses are ever to
be but a prelude to the surrender of my person to your animal
passion.

ââI know I have powers of soul, which, if suffered to be
developed, without this horrible crucifixion, might bless you. I
will not yet believe you will turn a deaf ear to this appeal of
your wife, who, as you know, has had, and can have, no life
apart from you. I pray, with tears, that you will spare me
from a maternity which my soul repudiates, and whose sufferings
I cannot endure. You will not deny me this privilege, which,
more than anything else, I ask of you.

ââThough much guilt is on my soul, through repeated efforts
to get rid of the results of your passional relations with me, and
save myself from the pain and anguish of a maternity I have felt
unable to bear, and of giving birth to children that I do not
want, yet I will not despair of salvation reaching me through
your love. To live as pure as my aspirations are, and have my
life the natural outgrowth of the deep love which I feel and must
express or die, would bring us both nearer heaven.

ââI cannot consent to have the woman,
the real soul-and-spirit
woman
in me, obliterated. I cannot believe it is my destiny to
have the
woman
expunged from my nature. I want to be a
strong, pure woman. I want to be lovely to you. Yet, heretofore,
the strongest manifestations of love to you have, usually,
had little other effect than to arouse your animal nature, and
thus have been so turned as to render me unlovely; for a wife
must become unlovely and repulsive to her husband, the moment
he ceases to reverence her soul, and feels that she is to him but
the means of mere sensual gratification.

ââYou will acknowledge that there is terrible wrong somewhere.
May God show us a Moses to lead us out of this wilderness,

79
this Egypt! You have often chided me for feeling unworthy
of your love; reminding me how strange it was, since other
and worthy men regarded me highly, and that I did not feel
myself unworthy
their
regard. Were there no abuse of our
sexual nature, your tender and noble love would so elevate and
consecrate the functions of my Womanhood, that I should no
more be tormented with that want of self-respect, which, alone,
ever causes me to doubt your love, and feel unworthy of it. I
feel, at times, that love would not, could not, thus crush my
Womanhood; that it would, by intuition, guide you in your
passional relations with me, so as never to do a wrong or outrage
to my nature, even unwittingly. The feeling which other menâs
regard awakens in me is not brought down and thus prostituted
to sensual gratification, but is awakened only to vitalize and
bless soul and body. Help me and save me, by your manly
strength, even from myself!

ââI appeal to you, in behalf of myself, of my husband, and my
children. Deep and enduring consciousness of guilt and shame
must rest on my soul, in view of the outrages I have perpetrated
on myself and my unborn children, whom I was reduced to the
necessity (as it then seemed to me) of killing before they were
born, or of cursing with an existence loathed and detested even
by the mother that bore them.

ââMy husband! you will, for
my
sake, for
your own sake
, for

our childrenâs
sake, reflect on these things, and send me your
reflections. You will respond to this appeal from

ââ
Your Loving Wife
.â

THE HUSBANDâS RESPONSE.

ââ
My Suffering Wife
:

ââI have a word to say to you now, such as I never said
before. Your letter has revealed you to me as I have never
before seen you. It shows me to what utter misery I have
brought you;âhow, for my gratification, you have descended
into the lowest hell.

ââYou intimate that I treat other women, personally, more

80
tenderly and reverently than I do you. That is true: to my
shame and regret I say it. And yet, why should I do so? Why
should I crush and desecrate you, while I have too much respect
for other women ever to think of doing the same to them? There
is no reason for it. You are my dearest love. I should treat

you
more tenderly than any others; be more careful of your
health, and beauty of body and soul. Of all women, the husband
should most anxiously watch over the health of his wife,
and most shrink from the abuse and desecration of her physical
as well as spiritual womanhood.

ââBut I have not been wholly blind to your deep misery. I
have seen it, and, at times, feared that I might be the cause. I
did not dare ask the cause. Feeling not myself that degradation
and misery of which you speak, I did not know how much
you suffered; but I should have known, had I not been blinded
by passion, and by the false idea that man had a right to the
indulgence of his passional nature whenever he wished it, and
that, too, without regard to the feelings of his wife, or the
welfare of the child that might ensue.

ââTrue, I, at times, heard your words of remonstrance and
entreaty, but they did not touch my heart; my passion made me
deaf or indifferent to your appeals to my manhood to spare you
from a maternity which you could not joyfully welcome. I was
lost in my own hell, and tormented. I was blind; but now and
then, glimpses came to me, from your own keen anguish, of the
real truth. But the blur of selfish, craving passion, would come
over my sight, and I would go on my old way, cheating myself
always, and sometimes you, into the feeling that it was all right;
that man had a right to that indulgence, whatever might be the
conditions of the wife, and whatever her feelings in regard to
Maternity. At least, I persuaded myself and you
that I could not
help it
, and that my health would suffer unless I frequently held
that relation with you.

ââNow that blind dominion of passion is at an end. Your
appeal to my manhood has reached its deepest depths. The gratification
of animal passion shall no more guide me in my relations
to you. That it ever has is my shame, as well as your degradation.

81
I wish you could see my soul as it now is; you would
see a revolution in it. The deep wail of your spirit has
reached my heart, and I am ready to go up with you out
of the perdition into which my uncontrolled sensualism has
cast us.

ââYou have descended into hell, for my gratification. You
have consented to terrible anguish of body and soul, for no higher
object than my momentary pleasure. You have sacrificed your
body and soul, your self-respect, your unborn children, on the
altar of my ungovernable passion. From this hour, I will seek
to repair the wrong I have done you. I have forced on you, in
contempt of your entreaties, a maternity which could not be
otherwise than most hateful to you. I have compelled you to
pass through sufferings of body and anguish of mind which you
were not ready to meet, and which were all the more severe,
because they were imposed by one whom you loved, and who
should have known better. I have imparted to you the elements
of a new life, when your very soul spurned and loathed them.
I have filled your heart with deadly hatred towards the young
life, my own child, that was being developed beneath it. I have
compelled you to a deed of all others the most loathsome and
hateful to a pure, refined and noble woman,âto the
murder

(it should have no other name) of your children, to the murder
of
my
children, ere they were born, to save them from the
more fearful and horrible doom of an unwelcome and hated
existence.

ââTalk not to me of
your
guilt, of your unworthiness to stand
by my side, and to tread with me the path of life as a true, noble
and loving wife. If you are guilty, what am I? If you feel
degraded by the loss of self-respect, what ought I to feel? The
fault is all my own. I should have known better, and had a
higher appreciation of the passional relation. Had I consulted
your wishes as to maternity, had I counselled with you as to
when you could, with safety and exultation, take charge of the
germ of my child, and naturally develop it into life, had I never
imposed on you a repulsive and abhorred maternity, would the
stain of abortion now darken your soul? Yes, I see it all:

82
the deep damnation of the deed is my own, and would to God
that the penalty might descend on me; that I could save you,
my long-suffering, too lenient and forgiving wife, the pain and
anguish!

ââGod help me! I am very sick at heart. The bitterness of
death enters my soul, as I reflect on the unseen and unexpressed
pain of body and desperation and anguish of soul to which my
ungoverned passion has brought you. Can you forgive me?
Can you again restore me to your loving confidence? Can you
ever again respect my manhood, which has brought upon you
all this woe? I will, henceforth, comply with the teachings
of the book you sent me, and hold my entire nature in abeyance
to your wishes and happiness, and in all my passional relations
with you, my object shall be your health and happiness, rather
than my own gratification. I will be to you an
Ernest
, God
helping me.

ââDearest! believe me and trust me now, for I mean what I
say, and it shall be done. I have written it here, and this shall
be my pledge; and if ever I urge on you a relation that will subject
you to the liability of maternity, when you do not call for it,
lay this pledge before me and it shall be respected.

ââWe shall yet rejoice together on earth as we never did
before. This world may not bring to you entire restoration to
health of body, nor peace of mind, nor yet self-abandoned trust
in your husband; but the effort to effect this, on my part, shall
not be wanting. Believe me, and trust to the love, the faith
and energy which your letter, and that experience of Ernest and
Nina, have awakened in me. We will together seek the aid of
the angel helpers, who never condemn save to restore and bless,
and who are even now lifting up and vitalizing the desponding
and heart-stricken.

ââDear wife! look up, and trustâ
trust
â
TRUST!
and with
strong nerve, and in conscious pride and innocence, you shall
yet stand by my side, and tread with me the pathway of the
future, a proud, loving, trusting, joyous wife. Your soul shall
yet shine with deeper lustre on my manhood, to elevate and
save your conscience-stricken, but not despairing husband.

83
You shall yet be, in deed and in truth, my Saviour, and I
will be yours.

ââThese are not idle words, but come from the heart of your
loving, penitent, yet hopeful and confident

ââ
Husband
.â

âIt will do your heart good to know that that husband has,
thus far, been true to his pledge; that that wife is now blooming
again in comparative health. Hope and triumph are shining
in her face, love quickens the intellect, and vitalizes the whole
woman. And woman is intuitional, to understand and appreciate
a true and noble manhood. You will not wonder, then, that she
feels nearer to him, in mind and spirit, than ever before, for now
she understands him, and he her. Could they have talked over
the subject of passional relations, and understood each other before
they entered upon their marriage life, it had saved her years
of anguish. May their history be a beacon light to warn others
to shun the rocks and shoals that lie, unseen, in the inner depths
of wedded life!

âIt may encourage you to know that they owe their salvation
to
you
, though they allow that I have had a hand in it.
True, it was through me that the experience of Ernest and
Nina came to their knowledge, but I am quite willing that
the author of â
Marriage and Parentage
â should bear the
responsibility and have the glory of their redemption. Their
names are sacredly private. They would meet you without
feeling that you know them. I shall not reveal them further
than I have done.

âGod speed you in your efforts to vindicate the most sacred
and important of all human rights,â
the right of woman to say
when and under what circumstances she shall assume the office of
Maternity, and the right of her child to a joyous welcome into
life
.

âThe crime of an enforced and abhorred maternity! Well
and truly do you call it, â
THE CRIME OF EARTH
.â In whatever
light it is viewed, whether in its bearing on the mother, on the

84
child, on the husband, on home, on society, or on humanity, it
is, indeed,
THE CRIME OF CRIMES
.

âWith fervent prayers for the triumph of truth on this
subject, I am

Your friend,

ââ.â

My friend, how many wives would thus appeal to
their husbands, if they dared? âSever the last link
of the bond that binds her to her husband!â Mere
sensualism âthe last linkâ in such a union! I do not
like to talk of
chains
,
links
, and
bonds
, in connection
with such a relation. Talk of these in connection with
slaveholders and slaves, but let them not sully a relation
like this. â
The last link
,â indeed! Yet it is true;
it is, often, the first, and last, and only link in the chain
that binds the husband to the wife, in what is called
marriage. Man seeks woman as a legal wife, that he
may legally and respectably give indulgence, without
restraint, to his passion. If the wife seeks to preserve
her soul and body from desecration, he threatens to
leave her, and seek his gratification where he can find
it. She submits, to keep him with her; both of them,
unmindful and regardless of the results to the mother
and the child. âPerish all outward bondsâ of marriage
at once, rather than that the relation should continue
in this way!

Wives! be frank and true to your husbands, on the
subject of maternity, and the relation that leads to it.
Interchange thoughts and feelings with them, as to what
nature allows or demands, in regard to these. Can
maternity be natural, when it is undesigned by the

85
father, or undesired by the mother? Can a maternity
be natural, healthful, ennobling to the mother, to
the child, to the father, and to home, when no loving,
tender, anxious forethought presides over the relation in
which it originated?âwhen the motherâs nature loathed
and repelled it, and the fatherâs only thought was his
own selfish gratification; the feelings and conditions of
the mother, and the health, character and destiny of the
child that may result being ignored by him? Wives!
let there be a perfect and loving understanding between
you and your husbands, on these matters, and great will
be your reward.

Maidens! a word to you. Never enter into the physical
relations of marriage with a man, until you have
conversed with him freely and fully on maternity, and
the relation that leads to it. Learn distinctly his views
and feelings, and his expectations, in regard to that
purest and most ennobling of all the functions of your
nature, and the most sacred of all the intimacies of conjugal
life. Your self-respect, your beauty, your glory,
your heaven, as a wife, will be more directly involved
in his feelings and views and practices, in regard to
that relation, than in all other things. As you would
not become a weak, a miserable, imbecile, unlovable and
degraded wife and mother, in the very prime of your
life, come to a perfect understanding with your chosen
one, ere you commit your person to his keeping in the
sacred intimacies of home. Beware of that man, who,
under pretence of delicacy, modesty, and propriety,
shuns conversation with you on this relation, and on
the hallowed function of maternity. Concealment and

86
mystery, in him, towards you, on all other subjects pertaining
to conjugal union, might be overlooked; but if
he conceals his views here, rest assured it bodes no good
to your purity and happiness as a wife and a mother.
You can have no more certain assurance that you are
to be victimized, your soul and body offered up,
slain
,
on the altar of his sensualism, than his unwillingness
to converse with you on subjects so vital to your happiness.
In the relation he seeks with you will he,

practically
, hold his manhood in abeyance to the calls
of your nature and to your conditions, and consecrate
its passions and its powers to the elevation and happiness
of his wife and children? If not, your maiden soul
had better return to God unadorned with the diadem
of conjugal and maternal love, than that you should
become the wife of such a man and the mother of his
children.

How much of womanâs suffering and degradation,
under the horrors of an unnatural maternity, are owing
to herself, I will not say. My appeal is to husbands,
and I would show them the extent of their responsibility
in this crime. Doubtless, woman might save herself
much anguish and suffering, if she would approach man
frankly, in womanly love, tenderness, and dignity, and
open to him the depths of her soul in regard to Maternity,
and the relation in which it originates. Men are
not all below the brutes, in their nature. If woman
were true to
purity
, to justice, to her own nature, and
would be just and true to her husband and her children,
and freely and lovingly converse with man on these relations
and functions, he would, often, with manly pride

87
and affection, respond to her. On no subject would a
true and noble man respond to the words of a pure and
trusting woman with more manly pride and dignity, and
a more conscious self-respect, than on Maternity, and
the relation that leads to it. Let wives, then, be true
to themselves, if they would have their husbands true
to them!

LETTER VI.

WORDS FITLY SPOKEN, BY ONE WHO SPEAKS WITH AUTHORITY.

Dear Friend
:

Would you secure for yourself, your wife and your
children, a pure and happy home? Of one thing, then,
you must never lose sight. You now regard your wife
as fitted to be your companion, intellectually and socially,
as well as affectionally. Be sure that no effort is wanting,
on your part, to keep her so. If her intellect
becomes stunted, and she be deprived of the means and
opportunities for improvement, while you enjoy every
opportunity to cultivate and enlarge your intellectual
powers, how can she possibly feel herself fitted to be
your equal companion?

Let me ask you carefully to read over the âAppeal of
the Wife to the Husband,â in the last letter. Mark
well what she says on this subject; how she feels, as she
finds herself losing all power to sympathize in the intellectual
aspirations and pursuits of her husband. She,
intellectually, was sinking, while he was rising; was
growing poorer, while he was growing richer; and he
took little pains to impart to her his increasing intellectual
wealth. All opportunities for intellectual growth
were precluded by the anxieties of maternity, which he,

89
without a thought for her intellectual welfare, was constantly
imposing upon her. Never impose this function
upon your wife, at the expense of her intellectual growth.
No wife can ever be made intellectually poorer by maternity,
and the cares of a mother, when that relation is
joyfully welcomed, and those cares are shared by the
husband. But how can a wifeâs intellect ever be expanded
with new and noble thoughts, when the physical
sufferings and mental anguish of a frequent and an undesired
maternity are ever present?

Stay at home with the mother of your children, except
when necessary avocations call you away. Share with
her the cares, the anxieties and joys, of the nursery.
There cultivate your intellectual powers together by
reading, and by conversation,âespecially, on all subjects
pertaining to parentage and the ante-natal, as well
as the post-natal, development, education and life of
your children. How anxious will every true and loving
husband and father be, to unite with his wife and the
mother of his children, in the nursery, to impart and to
receive all possible light in regard to these matters!

Neither should you ever impose maternity on your
wife at the expense of her
social
nature. Never go
abroad to enjoy and develop your own social nature, and
leave her at home alone in the nursery, preparing to give
birth and a worthy reception to your child, or to spend
her weary hours in solitude, in anxious watchings over
your children, and in longings for your presence and
your sympathy. Stay with her, and share with her all
the joys and all the sorrows, all the sweet rest and all
the weary labors, of a maternity imposed by you, and of

90
developing into noble men or women the offspring of
your mutual love.

But how crushed, intellectually and socially, must
that wife become, on whom an ignorant, a thoughtless,
or a brutal husband, is ever imposing a maternity from
which her soul recoils! Her intellect becomes dwarfed
and her social nature dead. How can it be otherwise,
especially when driven to the deed of ante-natal murder,
to escape the horror of giving birth to children accursed
by the mother that bore them? Hope becomes extinct,
and the light of her soul goes out in utter darkness!

The following letter must speak for itself. It is nearly
a
verbatim
extract from a letter, the original of which is
now before me. No man, especially no husband, can
read it, and not feel quickened in all that is truly
manly, noble and God-like. Of this woman, as to her
style and her sentiments, every true man will feel that
to be true which the people said of the teachings of
Jesusââ
He speaks as one having authority
.â
May her words of power find a response in the heart of
every husband and wife, and of every man and woman!

âThe subject of an undesigned and undesired maternity,âhow
it affects the mother towards the child, towards the function
of Maternity itself,âthese are matters, on which, as a wife and
a mother, and a friend of Human Progress, my mind has been
deeply exercised since they were first presented to me. The delicate
and hallowed beauty with which you invest maternity, and
the relation that leads to it, renders it easy for me to impart to
you my views on these subjects, while I feel instinctively repelled
from any approach to them with most other persons, both men
and women.

âThe thoughts I have do not flow from my own experience.

91
I have never given birth to a child not earnestly desired. Yet,
being a woman and a mother, it seems to me no difficult matter
to judge correctly as to what must necessarily be the emotions
and effects produced by such a maternity.

âBut I must express my earnest conviction, that any woman,
any wife, who permits herself to be made the instrument of
bringing into life a new existence, unwelcome to her own soul,
must, in some degree, be wanting in that self-respect which is an
inseparable accompaniment of, nay, an essential element in, true
nobility of character. That woman must feel degraded before
her own soul, who, for any cause, in or out of
legal
marriage,
suffers herself to be made the means of such an outrage upon her
innocent and helpless babe. Better, a thousand times, that she
leave her legal husband at once and forever, than allow soul and
body to be thus prostituted, and herself to be made accessory to
a deed so unnatural and unjust as that of giving birth to a child
whose existence is repudiated and loathed by her own heart.

âPublic opinion, based on his superior physical strength and
(hitherto) superior intellectual development, has accorded to man
the dignity of lordship. Looking over the face of the earth, he
says, âSee all things for my use, even woman.â And as the
Bible, in many of its teachings, as these are explained, sanctions
this arrogance, declaring that the âman was not made for the
woman, but the woman for the man,â she herself, the just
authority of Nature being educated out of her, and the arbitrary
authority of man educated into her, believes it her duty to yield
implicit obedience to all the demands of the man to whom she
has declared allegiance at the altar;âthe
altar
, truly; for
there she is frequently offered a propitiation to satisfy the demands
of manâs unholy passion; and from henceforth this being,
created with reason, conscience and intuitions of her own, and
for her own guidance, believes it her highest duty to sacrifice all
these to the authority and the licensed sensualism of the husband,
for whose pleasure she was created, and to âobey even as
Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord.â

âThis much may be said to account for the fact that so many
women, otherwise excellent and amiable, lend themselves to the

92
commission of this great crime; a crime against themselves,
against their children, against their husbands, against our great
humanity. And while thus prostituting their persons according
to law (made for this very end, and solely by those who prostitute
them), they deceive themselves into the stupid belief that
they are leading pure and virtuous lives, and look with scorn
and contempt upon the poor sister who commits the same unnatural
and revolting deed in an unlawful and less reputable
manner.

âHuman decrees and enactments can never alter or reverse
human obligations. What is wrong without a license or commission
from human government, is wrong with such a license.
If an undesigned and undesired maternity be a dark and damning
sin against the child, the mother, and humanity, against
God, without the sanction of the Church, the State, and public
opinion, it is a sin of an equally dark and damning character
with such sanction. In every case where the act that leads to
maternity would be a sin, a foul and monstrous crime, and the
shame and infamy of one or both parents, without the sanction
of human laws, it would be the same with such sanction, and in
a legalized union. Those women, therefore, who for any cause,
allow an undesired maternity to be imposed on them by men
holding the legal relation of husbands, and permit themselves to
be made the means of giving existence to children whom they do
not want, in legal marriage, ought to be, and one day will be,
regarded in the same light as those are who become mothers outside
of wedlock. If it be wrong for a woman to become a
mother, without the consent of Church and State and society, it
is wrong for her to become a mother with such consent. If right
with such consent, it is right without it. Whatever it is right
to do with a civil, ecclesiastical or social license, it is right to do
without it.

âIf womanâs life be made a curse by the constant endurance
of suffering, consequent upon a too-frequent maternity, the religious
woman often endeavors to stifle the outcries and accusations
of reason and intuition by the absurd plea that she âmust
have all the children whom it is Godâs will to send.â Occasionally,

93
one is found weak enough, and wickedly fond enough, to
say, as Miss Bremer, with contemptible silliness, makes one of
her amiable characters in âThe Homeâ say, âthat though she
had such a large and rapidly increasing family, and her husbandâs
means of providing for it were somewhat limited, yet he

never grumbled
, and was always ready to welcome each new child
as it came!â Grumble, indeed! A husband âgrumblingâ that
his wife has conceived! A father âgrumblingâ at the birth of a
child! âAlways ready to welcome each new child as it came!ââand
this said by a wife of her husband, as the strongest testimony
to his manliness and justice as a husband and father, and
as the highest reason why she should love and honor him! What
man so base, so ignoble, so fallen, and so deserving a dungeon
or the gallows, as he who imparts the germ of a new life to his
wife, to gratify his passion, and then âgrumblesâ because a
child is born, and thrusts it from him? Man can give no
greater proof of the utter degradation and ruin of his moral
nature. Yet not to grumble at a maternity of his own imposing,
and not to repel and cast off the babe for whose undesired
existence he is responsible, is Miss Bremerâs highest conception
of manhood!

âBut a false religious education is not the only reason why
woman weakly and unrighteously yields herself to the base and
brutal passion of her husband; for a passion, though all pure
and ennobling when its demands are just and naturally answered,
becomes most base and brutalizing to men and women,
when indulged at the expense of the child, and contrary to the
wishes of the wife and mother. As society is now constituted,
she is his dependant. The laws make her subservient to his will,
while she continues a wife, and all-pervading custom has, in
great measure, deprived her of the dignity which an independent
ability to engage in business for herself, outside the domestic
circle, would confer.

ââ
Can do
is easily carried about,â is a pithy old Scottish
proverb; and this same âCan doâ is a good and sturdy staff of
self-support, when a woman finds that the man on whom she
fondly leaned would become to her, not a tower of strength and

94
a refuge from the storm, but the oppressor to crush both soul
and body, and make of her very Womanhood an unworthy thing.
Let woman respect herself. She will gain nothing by submitting
to wrong and outrage. No wife ever gained or perpetuated the
love and respect of a husband, deserving the name, by yielding
to his passion, merely to please him.

âIt is the popular, but foolish and unthinking belief, that
children owe great obligations to their parents for bringing
them into life; but is not the contrary the fact, that parents
are under the strongest possible obligations to their children to
render that being good, wise, and happy, which they themselves
have forced upon their child? Assuming this as self-evident,
then is it clear that such existence should not be the
result of blind, unthinking passion, but of careful, wise and
loving design.

âThe act in which the child originates is performed, often,
solely for the momentary gratification of one or both parents.
No thought for the welfare, the physical, mental and spiritual
organization and tendencies of the child that may ensue, is
entertained. No careful and anxious forethought for the character
and destiny of the child is exercised, but the gratification
of mere animal passion is the sole object sought. The child
comes into being undesigned by the father and undesired by the
mother,âthe offspring of reckless, selfish, sensual lust, and not
of tender, self-forgetting, noble love. How grievous the wrong
done by the father to the mother, and by the mother to herself,
and by both to the child who is thus thrust into the world by
violence! What hope can exist for such a child? The felonâs
doom was written on his soul before he was born. His parents
consigned him to the dungeon or the gallows ere he drew the
breath of life.

âThe woman who, in youth, is flattered and caressed for the
charms of her person, the sweetness of her temper, and the
goodness of her heart, when married to a man who thus regards
her as but the instrument of his pleasure, soon loses the charms
for which she was caressed, and, while the husband is in his
prime, she enters upon a premature old age; her physical

95
strength exhausted by the almost constant suffering and agony
attendant upon giving existence to those poor, unwelcome ones,âher
beauty faded, her temper soured, her whole soul embittered
by a consciousness of her hard lot, and her mental nature
stunted in its growth,âfor what leisure has she to attend to
the wants of her own spirit, while her energies are taxed to the
utmost with the care of her living children, who are solely dependent
on her, and she preparing to add another to the number?
How can she fill the treasure-house of her own soul with
âthings new and old,â under all these adverse circumstances,
and while the present physical wants of her little ones are constantly
clamoring, âGive! give!â Does not reason, does not
justice, demand for woman that she have full opportunity for
the development of her own Womanhood, soul, body, and
spirit? Has not she, as an individual child of God and member
of the human family, a
right
to this? Does not the well-being
of such children as she may righteously bring into existence
loudly call for a full and
practical
recognition, on the part
of every husband and every man, of her right to decide for herself
when, how often, and under what circumstances, she shall
assume the office of Maternity, or be subjected to the relation
that may issue in maternity? Does not the happiness, the best
interest of the husband, require it? Does not Humanity itself
demand it?

âAnd how must that woman, in whose soul the theory of
passive obedience has not wholly eradicated nature, regard the
husband who causes her thus to curse âthe day wherein she was
bornâ a woman? In her inmost soul, she must look upon him
as the half-enlightened slave looks upon his master, and bitterly
reproach him for victimizing her to his own base passion, and for
his own short-lived gratification, irrespective of the woful consequences
to her whom he has sworn to cherish, honor and protect.
And justly does she thus regard him. No wife can love and honor
such a husband. He is to her what the executioner is to the
victim, or the slaveholder to his crushed and outraged slaves.
She cannot but loathe him.

âCan love do any injury to its object? Must not the wife

96
become alienated from the husband, who, instead of cherishing
her health and beauty, and seeking her happiness, subjects
her to the loss of all these, and instead of honoring, basely
enslaves her to his own infamous passion?âwho, instead of
protecting from evil, exposes her to sickness, sorrow and death,
not in accordance with her own free will, her own glad choice,
in pursuit of an object worthy and great enough to inspire
hope, courage and strength to meet the coming suffering, and
the attainment of which shall amply compensate, and cause
her âto remember no more the anguish, for joyâ that a new
life is given unto her, but simply and solely that his own mean,
selfish, animal nature may find present satisfaction? Deserves
such a man the blessings of a home of love and harmony, the
devotion of wife and little ones? Alas! no; he has planted
only curses, and âwhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
reap.â

âMust not such a wife, too, regard the creative function in
both herself and husband with loathing and abhorrence? And
did not the power of refusing this unwelcome maternity reside
within herself, who could blame her for reproaching even the
great Creator for so endowing her with a capacity for unremunerative
suffering? And what must be the atmosphere of that
house (I will not dignify it by the sacred name of
home
), where
the wife and mother regards her own nature as degraded,âher
husband the tyrant who degrades, and her children the fruits of
this degradation? Is that house a fit nursery for the germs of a
noble Humanity? Do not plants there take root which cumber
the earth, and, in their turn, fill it anew with those briers and
thorns of human kind, which render its habitations places of
cursing and bitterness?

âAlas for the poor child of such a parentage! Receiving his
very being by a base act of the father, nourished until birth underneath
the heart of the mother, whose whole nature protests
against its existence, feeding upon her bitterness, hatred, and
sense of humiliation, the gall and wormwood of her soul infused
into its young being, coming at last into the world destitute of
the inheritance of love,âthe inheritance justly his own,âwhere

97
shall be the resting-place of that childâs soul? Around
what can it lovingly cling? Even its own mother regards it
as an unwelcome intruder; in whose loving bosom shall it be
tenderly nurtured?

âPerhaps the mother who bore him used her best endeavor
to cut short his earthly existence ere he saw the light; and,
failing in this, when ushered into the world, grudges him the
care and sustenance necessary to sustain that existence. Or if,
as is more frequently the fact, with the actual presence of the
helpless innocent in her bosom, somewhat of the motherâs heart
awakens into life, it is not that rich, overflowing life of love
which pours the wealth and fulness of her own being into his.
She cares for him as the animal cares for its young in its utter
helplessness; and then the weary woman, with many other
children about her, and preparing for a new maternity, thrusts
him from her as soon as possible, and the little yearling must
âtak the stirkâs staâ (the stall of the yearling calf). What can
the poor, unwelcome child become? How small are his chances
for a virtuous life! If he thinks God has so created him, well
may he plead with poor Burnsâ

âThou knowest thou hast formed me

With passions wild and strong.â

âCan a bitter fountain send forth sweet water?â âWhere shall
I get them?â was the reply of a criminal to Jonathan Edwards,
who told him he must have better thoughts.

âAlas for poor Humanity! âLet there be light,â that man
may know that the relation that leads to maternity can only be
ennobled when its object is the creation of a new and glorious
life; that his passional nature can only derive dignity and
beauty from the control of love and reason; that otherwise, it
is of the earth, earthy, and debases him below the level of the
brute. âLet there be light,â that woman, in whose soul resides
the power, may say to this overwhelming flood of evil, âHere
shall thy proud waves be stayed!â The errors of a false religious
education, bad laws, and bad customs, have, hitherto,
formed some extenuation for this weak subserviency; but this

98
ignorance has been tolerated full long, and now the great cry
of God and Humanity goes forth calling for repentance,âthat
âa new heavens and a new earth may be created, wherein shall
dwell righteousness.ââ

Man has a heart, and that heart can be reached by
the loving and earnest appeal of a true woman. Words,
such as those contained in the above extract, will never
be uttered in vain. They are the true oracles of Natureâs
God, as revealed in the soul of the wife and the
mother. Let the father hearken to the mother as she
pleads, in behalf of her children, that they may not be
cursed with an unwelcome existence. Let the husband
listen to the prayer of his wife, that she may be spared
a maternity whose responsibilities she is not prepared
joyfully to assume. Humanity utters her indignant
protest against man, when, to gratify his sensual passion,
he perpetrates the greatest possible outrage against
woman, as a wife and mother, and as a woman, by subjecting
her to the necessity of cursing her child with
an abhorred existence, or of killing it before it is born.
Protestations of love and devotion must ever seem insulting
and disgusting to a true woman, from a man who
would thus recklessly inflict upon herself and her child
this foul wrong. In vain does such a man prate of his
regard for the purity and honor of woman, of his reverence
for marriage and parentage, and of his desire for
the elevation of our common humanity; his life, in the
sacred privacy of home, is an insult to his wife, an outrage
upon the mother of his children, an act of living
injustice and cruelty to his offspring, and a crime of

99
deepest infamy against all that is true, pure and noble
in human nature.

Man will not always be thus heedless of the health
and happiness of his wife; he will not always be thus
unjust and inhuman to his innocent and unconscious
children, by making them objects of dread, of loathing
and cursing, to the very heart under whose pulsations
they receive their ante-natal development. He will subject
his manhood to the health and happiness of his wife
and children; and in doing so, will receive the richest
reward earth can bestow,âthe perfect trust of a devoted
wife, and the loving respect of a healthy, happy and
joyous offspring.

LETTER VII.

THE DREAD ALTERNATIVEâANTE-NATAL MURDER, OR AN UNWELCOME CHILD.

Dear Friend
:

The following experience of a woman, given in her
own words, will make its appeal to all that is pure,
manly and noble in manhood. It is the cry of anguish
from womanâs riven heart to man, to save her from the
agony and blighting curse of a maternity whose sufferings
she is not prepared joyfully to meet, and from which
her entire nature shrinks with dread and loathing; to
save her from the revolting alternative of killing her
child before it is born, or of giving life to one whose very
existence is loathed by her. Several times, the crime of
an undesired maternity had been perpetrated upon her
by her husband, and each time the child had been killed
by herself or by a doctor, before its birth. She was
asked how she felt under these outrages, and what was
the result on her physical, social and spiritual nature.
The following is her answer:

âHow did I feel? I felt that I was committing a damning
sin. My soul shrank from the deed with intense horror and
loathing. The remonstrances of a guilty conscience I could not
silence. I had submitted to the relation in which maternity
originates, thinking it my duty, as a wife, to do so whenever
my husband demanded. I told him that my very soul shrank

101
from maternity; that I was not yet prepared for its responsibilities
and agonies, and begged of him not to impose that burden
upon me till I could joyfully welcome it, which I felt that I
should, in due time. But he heeded not my prayer. He insisted
on the relation. Conception and maternity ensued.

âMy soul died within me. An ever present loathing of the
new life that was being developed within mine was in my heart.
My own soul, and the God whose voice was heard within, repudiated
its existence. I could not help the feeling. The spirit
of murder, towards the unconscious child in embryo, was ever
present to me; yet my soul shrank with horror from the deed.
Shall I kill my child before its birth, or give existence to one
whose birthright inheritance is
a motherâs curse
? was the question
I found myself debating continually;âfor my curse was on
its very life.

âI consulted a woman, a friend in whom I trusted. I found
that she had perpetrated that outrage on herself and on others.
She told me it was not murder to kill a child any time before its
birth. Of this she labored to convince me, and railed in the aid
of her âfamily physician,â to give force to her arguments. He
argued that it was right and just for wives thus to protect themselves
against the results of their husbandâs sensualism,âtold
me that God and human laws would approve of killing children
before they were born, rather than curse them with an undesired
existence. My only trouble was, with Godâs view of the case.
I could not get rid of the feeling that it was an outrage on my
body and soul, and on my unconscious babe. He argued that
my child, at five months (which was the time), had no life, and
where there was no life, no life could be taken. Though I determined
to do the deed, or get the âfamily physicianâ to do it,
my womanly instincts, my reason, my conscience, my self-respect,
my entire nature, revolted against my decision. My Womanhood
rose up in withering condemnation. And, after the deed
was done, I felt that I could never respect myself again; that I
could never again appear in society; that if I did, all that was
pure and true in manhood and womanhood would shrink from
me as a polluted, disgusting object.

102
âI tried to cast the blame on my husband, who had imposed
the necessity upon me. I tried to feel that the outrage and the
guilt were all his own; that, had he heeded my prayer, and
dealt justly by me, I should never have been driven to the dread
alternative of ante-natal murder, or of giving birth to a child I
did not want. But I saw and felt, that however great the wrong
he had done to me, the fact still remained,âmy nature was outraged,
if not by my consent, yet by my sufferance. I knew I
could have saved myself from maternity, had I been resolute to
do so; and that, having submitted to the relation in which it
originated, I had no right to add to the outrage by killing my
child. I felt myself to be a crushed, prostituted, abandoned
woman. Can any apology be offered for a woman who commits
the crime of ante-natal murder, after she has voluntarily yielded
to the relation that leads to maternity?

âMaternity, with its prospective agonies and its abhorred
responsibilities (for I did not yet call for a child), was again
thrust upon me in a few months; but I shrunk from destroying
my child again. I gave birth to two living children. Then my
soul rebelled against having more; but my husband was deaf to
my prayers and my tears, though he himself was opposed to my
having any more children, and insisted it was my fault if I did,
though he persisted in his right to his sensual indulgence. How
could I avoid having more children, when he was continually
demanding of me the relation which naturally leads to offspring?
âKill them,â was his reply, âbefore they are born, or do something
to prevent conception!â

âHis injustice and heartless selfishness cut me to the quick,âstung
my very soul. âThis is the man,â I said to myself, âwho
has promised to love, cherish, and
protect
me; who expects me to
love him tenderly and evermore; whom I have promised to love
till death separates us; and yet, this is the man who, without
regard to my wishes and conditions, insists on his right to gratify
his passion, though at the expense of my body and soul!â My
soul rose in rebellion against him. It became evident to me,
that the gratification of his passion was his only object in seeking
me as a wife; that this was the only claim he had upon me,

103
or wished to have, and that he had no higher idea of marriage
than as a means of licensed, reputable indulgence.

âI became desperate. I could not leave my children. I knew
if I left him, I could give no reason for the step, except my aversion
to having maternity thrust upon me in defiance of the demands
of my own nature, and I knew that all would condemn
me, if I left him to escape from such an outrage, as this was not
considered a wrong to me, but his right. Every feeling of my
soul revolted against his taking possession of my person, without
my consent, to blight and curse my body and soul to gratify his
animal nature.

âI came to the conclusion to stand by my own rights, and
defend my person against his sensualism. I told him, candidly,
how I felt, and that I must protect myself, in this respect, for
he would not. I told him I was living daily in deadly fear of
his passion, and of maternity; that the relation in which it
resulted had become repulsive to me, and that he had brought
me to view myself as a loathed, abject and prostituted woman.
His wrath was roused; and finally, from fear of breaking up
my family and having my helpless living children taken from me,
I submitted to a hell which had no mitigation, until separation
gave it to me.

âIn my intercourse with men, I have found few who did not
view marriage and a wife as my husband did, as a mere means
of sensual gratification. Companionship, intellectual, social, and
spiritual growth, and elevation, they think little of, in connection
with a wife. They see no soul, no God, in the wife; only
the mere animal, to administer to the brute in them.â

In the presence of a just and pure God, and before the
laws of Nature that are designed to govern all conjugal
relations, does marriage give to the husband any right
over the person of the wife, or to the wife any rights
over the person of the husband, which neither had before?
Has a husband any more right to
demand
of his
wife the surrender of her person to his passion, than he

104
has to demand that surrender of any other woman?
True marriage creates necessities in each, and gives vitality
and intensity to wants in each, which the presence,
the love and companionship of the other can supply; but
a pure conjugal love creates no rights, and never thinks
or talks of rights over the property, the body, or the soul
of the loved one. Indeed, a true man, whose soul is
filled with a holy conjugal love for a woman, would scorn
and loathe any personal caresses or surrender from her,
when he knew she gave them merely from a sense of
duty, and only because she believed he had a right to
them. A man must be shorn of all true manliness, and
become utterly debased and prostituted, before he can, in
or out of legal marriage, accept the personal surrender
of a woman to his passion, when he knows the surrender
is made solely to please him, or from some false idea of
duty. However tenderly, truly and devotedly a man
may love a woman, she is not, therefore, under obligations
to receive any expressions from him, except such as
her own necessities demand. Whatever manifestations
of yourself you would make to your wife, before offering
them, create in her the necessity of demanding and of
receiving them. If your nature prompts you to reveal
yourself to her in the relation that leads to maternity
control yourself, and be sternly true to yourself, to your
wife, and your child that may ensue, until, by all
other loving and endearing manifestations, you have created
in her nature an earnest call for maternity. Then
would she joyfully accept of you the germ of a new life,
and, for the sake of her husband and her child, consecrate
all the energies of her soul to its true development.

105
Read the following. The extract is from a letter written
by one who has proudly and nobly filled the stations
of a wife and a mother, and whose children and grandchildren
surround her and crown her life with tenderest
love and respect. She has seen many of the companions
of her girlhood victimized, and literally offered up on the
altar of sensualism, in legal marriage. Their husbands
demanded passional gratification as their
right
, irrespective
of consequences to wife or children, and they submitted
as a
duty
. Their career was short, in many cases,
and in others, they live but wrecks of their former selves.
A relation that should have ennobled and saved them,
has crushed them to death:

âIt has often been a matter of wonder to me that men should,
so heedlessly, and so injuriously to themselves, their wives, and
children, and their homes, demand at once, as soon as they get
legal possession of their wives, the gratification of a passion,
which, when indulged merely for the sake of the gratification of
the moment, must end in the destruction of all that is beautiful,
noble, and divine, in man or woman. I have often felt that I
would give the world for a friendship with man that should show
no impurity in its bearing, and for a conjugal relation that would,
at all times, heartily and practically recognize the right of the
wife to decide for herself when, how often, and under what
auspices, she should be a mother, or enter into the relation that
leads to maternity.

âIt is often said in my hearing, by women, that a woman
who is not willing to submit her person to the passion of her
husband, whenever he shall demand, is not fit to be a wife; and
if she becomes so, and her husband forsakes her for other women,
and neglects his children, he is to be pitied, and the wife condemned
and held responsible for all the results. The law gives
the husband cause for divorce if the wife persists in withholding
her person from his embrace, which, when thus thrust upon her

106
against her wishes, becomes loathsome and damnable. The community
of women generally endorse this state of things, and are
educated to believe that God gave man such fierce passions that
he cannot control them; that they must be gratified whenever
excited, though at the expense of womanâs health and happiness
and the happiness of her children.

âWill man ever be pure, noble and strong enough to protect
woman, in or out of legal marriage, against his own passion?
Must woman always put herself on the defensive, to protect herself
against man? Will man never see the fact as it is, that all
that is manly, true, great and noble in his nature, must be preserved
and perpetuated only by the protection of woman against
being victimized to his sensual gratification? O man! thou art
all noble and God-like, to the loving and trusting heart of
woman! She longs to come to thee, to save thee, and to be
saved by thee. But thou mayest be assured that thy heaven, in
time and eternity, can be secured only by saving woman from
prostitution. While she is regarded by thee as the means of sensual
gratification, rather than as the vitalizing, redeeming power
of thy manhood, she will bring desolation and death to thy
soul, and thou to hers. To man, woman looks for strength.
How she longs to rest in him,âhow she longs to give herself to
him in a self-abandoning trust,âand how she longs that he
may ever be worthy such a trust, the heart of the true woman
and wife alone can ever know. But when woman trusts and
man proves weak, and betrays her longing and trusting heart,
no words can express her sickening, crushing disappointment
and anguish. Often do women prefer to die a lingering and
loathsome death, rather than confess themselves mistaken and
disappointed in those whom they have trusted.â

The following extract from a private letter speaks the
thought and feeling of every true woman. Weigh well
what the writer says of womanâs right to protect herself
against the reckless passion of man. Also, what she
says of womanâs  power over man, and of manâs readiness

107
to yield to that power, when woman has the courage to
appeal to his love:

âI cannot conceive of a woman, who has willingly and joyfully
received into her own being the germ of a new existence,
with the noble design of rendering that existence happy, ever
committing this foul deed [abortion]. The cause of it must
always be, the previous submission to an unwelcome maternity.
If this can be justified, if the laws of man and of God oblige
woman thus to degrade and violate the sacredness of her own
person, it follows that she, being thus outlawed, placed outside
the protection of all law, human and divine, has a right to protect
herself from further evil, and even avenge herself for the past,
as she best can; and that whether by taking the life of her husband
or of his child. Can this be denied as a necessary consequence?
and does not the bare statement of it disprove the monstrous
assertion that God, either by Nature or Revelation, has
thus placed her at the disposal of manâs will? No living creature
is created without some means of self-protection; and in
woman, that weapon is
Self-Respect
.

âIt makes my soul sick, even to a loathing of Humanity, to
think of this unnatural deed, and its foul cause. Alas! men
and women do not worship their own natures. âLet us eat and
drink,â they cry, âfor to-morrow we die!âââLet us sacrifice
the
human
to appease the
brute
.â

âDoes not the crime of murder consist mainly in the fact, that
every soul born on this planet has an inherent right to all the
development it can receive in this, its birthplace, and when deprived
of corporeal existence, is robbed of this right? If this be
true then ante-natal murder of the same nature and character
as post-natal murder. Yet for the one crime the criminal is
accounted, by our judges, and by the sentiment of the public, to
be worthy of death; whereas, these same judges, and this same
public, incite to the commission of the other, by subjecting
woman to an abhorred maternity.

âWhere is the wrong? In the
man
, first of all. He it is
who subjects the woman to this abhorred maternity, and for his

108
own sensual gratification. For him there is no apology, save the
miserable one that passion overcome love and reason, the animal
triumphs over the man, the sensual over the spiritual.

âIn the mind of the woman who allows herself to become thus
basely subservient to her husbandâs will, how loathsome is the
memory of those progenitors who bequeath to the man a
nature so mean, selfish, tyrannical and animal, and to the
woman a nature so tamely, so ignobly subservient and unresisting!
Where is the remedy? In the awakening of woman to
this great evil. Woman must assert and maintain her rights
in regard to maternity, ere any rational hope can be entertained
for the future. I cannot believe that man would become the
fierce, selfish tyrant he now is, if properly appealed to before his
heart becomes hardened by indulgence,âthat he who, in the
general transactions of life, is just and honorable, would become
the selfish despot at home, if the woman who is his wife fully
respected her nature as woman, and her individual sacredness.

âLet woman, then, be appealed to. Let her âarise from the
dust, and put on her beautiful garments,â for then, and not till
then, shall her light break forth as the morning, and Humanity
become all glorious. But while woman, by law, custom, and
religion, is made subservient to manâs sensual gratification, without
regard to her feelings and wishes, while law, custom and
religion bestow on man the right to inflict on woman a maternity
whose suffering and responsibilities she is not prepared joyfully
to welcome, and while woman, to gratify manâs sensualism,
is subjected to the atrocious alternative of ante-natal
murder, or of giving existence to children whom her inmost soul
repels, there can be no hope of the regeneration and redemption,
the elevation and happiness of the race, and of peopling the
earth with nobler and more beautiful types of manhood and
womanhood.â

How many husbands are unwilling to have their
wives get knowledge as to their right to decide when
they shall become mothers, or be subjected to the relation

109
that leads to it! Let woman get light on this, if on
no other subject, if she would be happy in her home.
Slaveholders count him most guilty who attempts
to teach their slaves their right to be free. So many
husbands curse bitterly the man who would enlighten
their wives in regard to Maternity, and the relation
that leads to it. But true and earnest souls are
pledged to spread light on this subject. Read the
following:

âMarried women are often as ignorant, and about as degraded,
as to their rights and duties, respecting the function of
Maternity and the relation that leads to it, as are the slaves of
the South in regard to their rights. Many husbands are as unwilling
that their wives should get light on these subjects, as are
slaveholders that their slaves should be enlightened in regard to
their condition. They must not be allowed to know that they
are not morally bound to submit. They must have no will of
their own; and by their weak subserviency, they even say to
their husbands, âGod thy law,âthou mine,â as to Maternity
and the relation that leads to it. How can they know that
there is any other and nobler way, than to have children and
complain, and complain and have children, and submit themselves
to their husbandsâ sensualism with entire servility and
silence?

âNever has any man spoken a truer and more needed word
than you have spoken, or held out a more helpful hand to
woman, to enlighten her ignorance and to raise her from degradation,
than you have done, in your work on âMarriage and
Parentage.â To me and my husband, that book has been as a
message direct from God, to guide us in our most sacred relations
in the sanctuary of our home. We wait anxiously for
your work on âThe Crime of an Undesigned and Undesired Maternity.â
We can ensure for it a wide circulation in this region;
for the
ante-natal
history and education of human beings, in

110
its bearing on their
post-natal
character and destiny, is becoming
a subject of paramount interest in many true and earnest
souls.â

The following testimony to the wide-spread practice
of ante-natal murder is from one who has carefully
noted the progress of this crime, and its dire effects on
the physical and moral conditions of those who perpetrate
it, and on their husbands and their homes:

âA friend of mine told me that she should have killed two of
her children, ere they were born, had she known how. She
tried, but could not succeed. The children whom she tried to
murder were born alive, and are now living; but they are
stamped with the spirit of revenge and murder. They struggled
into life against the spirit of murder, and the maternal curse
must remain upon their souls till eternity shall cast it out. This
friend and myself made an estimate of the number of our near
neighbors who, to our knowledge, had killed one or more of
their children before they were born. Six, out of nine, had
done the deed, or had procured the services of a âfamily physicianâ
to do it for them. They all justified the practice of ante-natal
murder. A doctor in a neighboring village, who ever
frowns upon this unnatural deed, assured me, recently, that he
had been applied to by six different women in this little village,
in one week, to murder their children before birth. Some of
these women were the most fashionable, wealthy and respected
women of the town, and two of them were church-members.
They all insisted it was less criminal to kill children before they
were born, than to curse them with an unwelcome existence.

âMy husband and I have done what we could to circulate
your work on âMarriage and Parentageâ in this region, and,
already, it has brought comfort to many homes where happiness
had been well-nigh wrecked by the unnatural demands of husbands,
and by their imposing maternity on their wives when
they were unprepared to meet the consequent suffering.â

111
The following shows how common, in cities, is the
practice of ante-natal murder. What a testimony against
husbands who impose on their wives maternity, without
design, and contrary to their own wishes, and the wishes
of their wives!

âA physician in a neighboring city told me that it was very
common, among the more fashionable and wealthy among whom
he practised, for husbands, who wished to have their wives
always ready for society, to bring them to him and offer large
sums of money to induce him to procure abortion, and to prevent
conception. Invariably, those who practise this outrage
on themselves lose their health, become low-spirited, feel
humbled and prostituted, and are made irritable, complaining,
nervous invalids for life, and wholly incapacitated for the enjoyments
of society. I know many who practise this foul crime.
Those who do it generally lose their self-respect, become ashamed
of their womanhood, and shrink away from society, conscious
that they deserve to be shunned or pitied, by all that is pure
and noble. O! why, why do husbands impose on their wives
an alternative so horrible? Why do women ever submit to a
relation that subjects them to the possibility of a maternity,
whose sufferings they are not prepared to meet? They had
better starve, better die!

âYet, in my ignorance, to please my husband, and to escape
the agonies of an undesired maternity, have I allowed this most
unnatural outrage to be perpetrated upon myself and my unborn
children. I know the agony of soul, and the conscious shame
and degradation woman feels, when, having allowed her husband
to impose on her a maternity which her soul abhorred, she
resorts to ante-natal murder to avoid giving birth to a child she
does not want. I know no woman can practise this outrage on
herself, or allow another to practise it upon her, without injury
to body and soul. No woman, after doing this deed, can stand
before her own soul, or before her fellow-beings, as she did
before.

112
âThe unwelcome child!âmaternity, abhorred by the mother
and without design by the father!âyou call this â
THE CRIME OF
EARTH!
â It is. Lay it open to the eyes of all, in its bearing
on the purity and happiness of home, and on the character and
destiny of the race. â
Let there be light!
â In the name of God
and humanity, and by all that is pure and lovely in man or woman,
and by all that is sacred and dear in the relation of mother
and child, â
Let there be light!
ââ

The following extract is from a wife and mother, who,
with her husband, is laboring earnestly and efficiently to
elevate the human type. They are ever active to surround
themselves and their children with knowledge, with
just, pure and ennobling views and principles in regard
to marriage and parentage. They think this the
only

way to save their sons and daughters from the deep
wretchedness and degradation of inharmonious conjugal
relations, from polluted homes, and from the crime of
giving existence to children they do not want. Mark!
the woman, whose modesty is shocked at every effort,
however truthful, earnest and delicate it may be, to
enlighten husbands and wives in regard to the natural
laws designed to govern Maternity, and the relation that
leads to it, does not feel at all shocked by
ante-natal

murder. She can even justify herself in doing this most
foul and monstrous deed:â

âWhen you lectured in this place, on âThe Unwelcome
Child,â one lady went out of the house, affecting to be greatly
shocked by what you said. Yet, that same woman who went
out muttering curses on you, for warning husbands against
imposing an undesired maternity on their wives, has, to my
knowledge, had such a loathed and wretched burden thrust
upon her twice, in two years, and each time has killed her child

113
before it was born. Another lady, my near neighbor, who
thinks such subjects should never be agitated, publicly, has
three times, within so many years, committed the crime of ante-natal
murder. The first child was seven months old when she
killed it. She told me this herself. She is now but twenty-four
years old. She has one living child, and this must suffer for life,
from the outrages perpetrated upon it by the mother, ere its
birth. She says she cannot, and will not, have any more
children yet. She says her husband insists on his gratification,
and she cannot prevent conception, and has no alternative
but to kill the children before they are born, or give existence
to those whom her soul repels, and thus entail on them
a motherâs curse. She justifies herself by saying, it is no
greater sin against the child, against herself, against society,
and against humanity, for a mother to kill her child before it
is born, than to give birth to it when her own heart loathes
its existence.

âShe is one of a large class, who are
thus
trying to reconcile
themselves to
ante-natal
murder. Still, she feels degraded, as all
must who do this deed. They
are
degraded. A deed so unnatural
and so cruel can never be perpetrated without deep injury to
the moral nature of all concerned. The spirit that would kill a
child before birth, would kill it after; the spirit that would
commit
ante-natal
murder, would commit
post-natal
murder.
But what shall be said of the husband who subjects his wife
to this fearful alternative? Can man do a deed meaner, more
selfish, more satanic?â

The organic and constitutional tendencies of those who
are born are fixed. It may take a mighty effort to correct
their birthright tendencies to disease and to crime.
Thousands say, as the writer of the following extract
says,ââWe were lamentably ignorant of the natural
laws of Parentage when we married. Would that light
had come to us sooner. But we will not allow the happiness

114
of our children, and our childrenâs children, to be
wrecked for want of knowledge.â The following is the
testimony of a true and earnest woman, and loving and
happy wife and mother:â

âBefore your visit to this place to lecture on âThe Ante-Natal
History of the Human Being, and its influence on his Post-Natal
Character and Destiny, in the body and out of it,â my husband
and myself had talked over the subject of Marriage and Parentage
a great deal; but we never had had it presented to our
minds in so strong and clear a light before.

âWhen I was married, I was most lamentably ignorant of
the laws of my nature, especially of those designed to govern
Maternity. But my husband, in regard to maternity, and the
relation that leads to it, is a most kind and considerate man,
and I love and honor him all the more for it. I wish your book
on âMarriage and Parentageâ had fallen into our hands before
our children were born; we might have given them more loving
hearts, and nobler natures, in body and soul, by understanding
better how surrounding influences affect us before birth. But
I am thankful for my sake, and for my childrenâs sake, and for
the sake of the mothers that are to come after us, that your
views are being so widely made known through your writings
and your lectures. If mothers better understand the laws of
Nature designed to govern maternity, and the relation in which
it originates, they will be more careful of themselves, for
sake of their children.

âI have heard many mothers express their thankfulness for
your visit and your conversations and lectures here. You have
given hope and gladness to many anxious and despairing hearts.
The mother of six little ones, and who is about to add another to
the number, said to me, âSuch instruction is exactly what men
and women need.â I felt sorry for her; yet not so sorry for her
as for the unborn babe; for I know its existence is most unwelcome
to the mother.

âWhen I think of the great and good work in which you are

115
engaged, my heart blesses you, and bids you God-speed, for it is
a subject of the deepest interest to me as a wife and mother.
Before this question of Maternity, and the relation that leads to
it, so far as the character and destiny of the race are concerned,
in this and in the future state, all others sink into insignificance.
It is most painful to hear woman, in her vanity, her
shallowness, and intellectual, social and moral debasement,
array herself against the only movement that ever can raise
her to a true estimate of herself as the mother of the race.
Till the right is conceded to her to determine for herself when,
how often, and under what conditions she shall be a mother,
or be subject to the relation that leads to maternity, woman
can never become the true and proud mother of a healthy,
beautiful and noble offspring. While she is a mother from
necessity rather than from choice, she must feel herself an
abject, degraded being, and her children must partake of her
degradation. My husband and myself bid you God-speed!
Our hearts are with you.â

The following fact was communicated by a wife and
mother, as having occurred under her own observation,
and in reference to her own daughter. Let every
father and mother read this, and see to what extremities
their daughters are often driven, to save themselves
from a maternity whose sufferings they are not
prepared to endure:â

âMy only daughter was married to a warm-hearted, impulsive
young man of twenty, when she was but sixteen. I
besought him not to marry her to gratify his passions, and
endeavored to set before him and her the certain consequences
of a union formed for mere sensual purposes. She was, and
is, an innocent, artless, and frail creature. She was in poor
health, and I knew that absence from him preyed upon the life
of her body and soul. They married, and he took her to a
distant western State.

116
âIn about four months, she came home to me, by his consent,
a haggard, emaciated wreck of a woman. The first moment she
saw me alone, she said to me, âMother, they say I am about to
become a mother, and my husband wished me to come to you, to
see if you could not prevent it.â I told her it was impossible;
she was so feeble, that the effort to kill the child would kill
her. She wept, and prayed me to save her from the suffering
and anguish of child-birth. âI have,â said she, âthe most
loathsome and horrible feelings about it. I think it would be
a greater sin to give birth to a child, with the feelings I now
have towards it, than to kill it before it is born. The very
thought of giving birth to a child fills my soul with deadly
enmity. My constant prayer is, that the child may be destroyed.
I would rather die with it, than to give it birth under
such circumstances. What will the child be, after it is born,
if I give birth to it with the feelings I now have, and which I
cannot help?â

âI earnestly tried to dissuade her from destroying it for several
days; but she became so desperate, that I feared she would
kill herself, and knew that if the child was developed and born,
under such a state of mind in the mother, it must inevitably be
a desperado, or a fugitive and vagabond on the earth. She had
not one feeling of natural desire for her child, but only sought
its death. I took her to a doctor, noted for his ante-natal murders,
and he advised that the child should be killed,âand he
killed it. Her husband came after her, and was thankful the
deed had been done.

âBut the husband had no thought of restraining his passion,
and insisted on its gratification, though maternity should ensue.
In a few months, maternity was again imposed upon her. She
has no power of endurance. He and she again wished the child
to be destroyed, and it was, by the same doctor. With all this
dreadful suffering and anguish of his wife, he insisted on his
gratification. He had no higher conception of marriage, than
as a means of mere sensual indulgence. To own her body, and
use it for his gratification, he deemed his right as a husband.
She regards maternity with repulsion, and the relation that

117
leads to it; still, like most women, she thinks it a great misfortune
that husbands cannot gratify their sensualism without
imposing on their wives the necessity of abortion, or of giving
birth to children they do not want, and she lives in constant
fear of losing the affection of her husband, if she does not quietly
yield to his passion.

âAs to her husband, she really thought he could not control
himself without great injury. He had convinced her that the
laws of God and man gave him the right to that indulgence
with his legal wife as often as he desired, and if conception
ensued, it was no fault of his; that he was blameless, as to
any wrong done. I could not but feel disgusted and horrified,
to see all that was lovely and good in my child thus sacrificed
to a manâs low sensualism. When a husband thus deliberately
treats his wife as a mere means of sensual gratification, it
blunts all that is refined and noble in her, and makes him an
object of disgust to her. And she, in her nature,
must exercise the love-principle or starve, and she wastes it on
others more congenial, who will respect her womanly nature.
Often this is the cause of her throwing herself into temptation,
and becoming a victim of the base passions of those who
are ever on the watch for such. Thus she is driven, step by
step, to utter prostitution,âall from being made the slave
to the sensual passion of the husband. Had she had a spiritually-minded
and noble husband, or the courage to assert her
rights, her home would have been her heaven, and her progress
and improvement, not her degradation and ruin, the law
of his life.â

Read the following. It must be an inhuman and monstrous
religion which can countenance a crime so unnatural
as enforced maternity, or ante-natal murder:â

âThose among us who are members of our churches, and are
counted most exemplary patterns of purity and piety, to my
certain knowledge, practise ante-natal murder, and they justify

118
themselves by saying, âIt would be a greater sin against children
to entail on them the curse of an abhorred existence, than to
kill them before they are born!â These pious women affected
to be greatly shocked, when, in your lectures here, you appealed
to their husbands to control their passions, and spoke of the
crime of enforcing on women a maternity whose responsibilities
and sufferings they were not prepared joyfully to welcome. But
Nature is ever true to herself. No matter who they are that
perpetrate this outrage, whether rich or poor, high or low,
pious or impious, whether in the church or out of it, they
become weakly, and incurably diseased; their constitutions soon
break down under this abuse, and they pass away by consumption,
or some nameless, wasting disease, and their death is, by
most people, attributed to a âwise and good Providence.â The
husbands, the real murderers, are pitied, and soon comforted by
taking other wives, only to kill them in the same way. How
can a woman feel proud of the nature God has given her, after
thus abusing it? She cannot. She must feel in her soul that
she is degraded, and her very existence becomes a loathing to
herself. Who drives her to this inhuman deed?âwho, indeed,
but the very husband to whom she so fondly looked for protection
from all harm?â

Dear Friend
,âThe following positions seem to me
to be clearly sustained:

1. That it is a crime of the deepest dye, for a husband
to impose on his wife, without design, a maternity whose
responsibilities and sufferings she cannot joyfully endure.

2. That it is a sin for a husband to urge his wife to
submit to a relation which may result in an undesigned
and undesired maternity.

3. That no wife can stand proud and stainless before
her own soul, who allows herself to come into a relation
with her husband which may entail on her the curse of
an unwelcome maternity, and reduce her to the revolting

119
alternative of ante-natal murder, or of giving birth to a
child whose existence is abhorrent to her soul.

May not every child, in justice, demand of its parents,
as a birthright inheritance, (1) a healthy body, free from
all tendency to disease; (2) a healthy soul, free from all
tendencies to idiocy, and insanity of intellect or of heart;
(3) a designed existence, the result of a wise and tender
forethought, and not of blind, impetuous, selfish, sensual
passion; (4) a love origin, rather than a mere sensual,
animal origin; and (5) a joyous welcome into life? As
you cast your little ones afloat on the ocean of eternal
being, be careful to secure to them this outfit; then may
you hope to see them bravely and successfully outride
the storms of life, and enter into a true and endless rest.
But what hope is there for these poor, diseased, suffering
little ones, the offspring of a loathed and hated maternity,
whose very existence, ere they were born, was made
accursed by the mothers that bore them, and by the
fathers, whose only thought or aim in the act in which
they originated was mere sensual gratification? God
pity these poor, unwelcome ones! No earthly parents
welcome them into life with loving smiles. In whose
warm, loving bosom can they be tenderly cherished?
To whom can they look for love and sympathy? Again
I say,
God pity these poor, unwelcome children!

That your home may never be cursed by an undesigned
and undesired maternity, or by an unwelcome
child, is the anxious wish of

Your friend,

H. C. W.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

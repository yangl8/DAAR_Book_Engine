CHAPTER I

FATHER AND DAUGHTER

The
old man lay back in his chair asleep. The
morning sun beat against the drawn window
shades, filling the room with a dim, almost
cathedral light. An oil lamp, which had performed
its duty faithfully through the night, now seemed to
resent its neglect, and spluttered angrily. There was
the usual sound of the busy cityâs street outside the
window, for the morning was advancing, but here in
the room it was very quiet. A quaint little Dutch
clock ticked away regularly, and the tired manâs soft
breathing came and went, peacefully, for his sleep
was untroubled, his heart was full of happiness.

Presently the door opened, and a young girl came
into the room, and seeing him, there in the chair, she
stopped, afraid for a moment, then stepped forward
and bent over him. She smiled as she straightened
up, and turning called out softly:

Â
âMiss Lola! Miss Lola!â

âComing, Maria,â the answer came in a clear, fresh
young voice; for a moment the sleeper hesitated, about
to awake, then thought better of it, and dreamed a
dream of the triumph that was to be his.

âHush!â Maria spoke softly as Lola came into the
room, and Lola, following the girlâs pointed finger,
smiled lovingly as she crossed and stood beside her
fatherâs chair.

There was a strong contrast between these two girls
as they stood there for a moment, side by side, young
and good-looking as both undoubtedly were.

Lola was the sleeperâs daughter. Maria, their
servant. Maria was strong and rugged; Lola delicate
and blond. Mariaâs splendid young body had been developed
by hard work, while her mind had been stunted
by a miserable childhood of neglect and abuse. Lola,
since her motherâs death, had been her fatherâs constant
companion, and had seemed to catch from him
something of his grave and scholarly outlook upon
life, lightened, however, by the impulses of a naturally
sweet and sunny disposition, and the brave happiness
of youth.

Â
âHe hasnât been to bed at all!â exclaimed Maria,
as Lola stooped and put her hand lightly on the sleeperâs
arm.

âFather!â she called softly. âFather! It is morning!â

He awoke, startled, for a moment rather bewildered,
then added his smile to theirs, and said brightly, âI
am very happy, Lola.â

âIâm sure you havenât any right to be, and, of
course, you know that you ought to be scolded?â

âPerhaps so,â he returned, looking with pride at a
complicated electric apparatus on the table beside him,
âbut I have worked it all out! I am sure of it this
time!â

âPut that dreadful lamp out, and open the window!â
called out Lola to Maria, as she started to
pick up from the floor bits of broken glass and pieces
of wire.

âI do wish you would use the electric lights, father.
That lamp isnât enough, even if you could be trusted
to refill it, which you canât!â

âYou canât teach an old dog new tricks, my dear,â
smiled the Doctor, as he rose, rather stiffly. âThe big

Â
thoughts wonât come by electric light, at least not to
an old fellow who learned to do his thinking under
an old-fashioned studentâs lamp.â

âOh, I donât mind, not really,â answered Lola.
âAnd, besides, the lamp saves money.â

She was turning away when the Doctorâs low
chuckle of amusement stopped her. âAre you laughing
at me, father?â she questioned, with pretended
sternness.

âJust a little perhaps, my dear, because after this
you need not think of little savings. You shall give
up your school-teaching; you shall have new dresses
every day of your life, and hatsââ La! Never
mind, you shall see.â

âYou really think so, father?â

âI know it! After last night I shall never doubt it
again. I did not dare to stop until my work was done,
and then I sat there, dreaming, until I fell asleep.â

He looked again at his apparatus with such pride
and confidence that even Lola, who knew nothing of
the details of his experimental work, was thrilled with
the hope of his success, and rested her hand tenderly
upon his arm as she stood beside him.

Â
They were much alike, these two, as they stood
there together, the tall, rather delicate old man, and
the fragile, sensitive girl. Dreamers both, one had
but to look at them to see that, and they started apart,
almost guiltily, as the little clock on the mantel struck
eight.

âEight oâclock! Oh, Maria! Eight oâclock! We
must hurry!â Lola called out to Maria, who was busily
arranging the breakfast table in the adjoining room.

âCome, father!â she continued. âRun and get
yourself ready for breakfast, and the very minute we
get through I am going to put you to bed.â

âNot to-day, my dear,â he answered gaily; âthis is
to be my busy day!â

As he left the room, smiling and happy, Maria
looked after him anxiously.

âHeâll be sick if you donât look out, Miss Lola. He
donât know no more about takinâ care of himself than
one of my sisterâs babies.â

Lola laughed cheerfully as she looked with approval
over the neatly arranged breakfast table.

âI think he is perfectly well, Maria, and quite delighted
with himself this morning. He feels sure that

Â
he has made a wonderful discovery, something he has
been working on for years. I know that he thinks it
is going to be a fine thing for all the world and for
us, Maria; he says it is going to make us rich.â

âI hope so, Iâm sure. Thereâs lots of little things
weâre needing in the kitchen,â said Maria practically.
âAnyway, heâs the best doctor in the world, and he
ought to have the most money!â

âDonât get his egg too hard.â

âNo, Miss, it will be just like he wants it.â

When the Doctor returned he found everything
ready for his breakfast, and he stopped to greet Maria
kindly, as he always did, for aside from his habit of
rather old-fashioned courtesy she was a great favorite
of his.

âWould you like a pan-cake, Doctor?â she inquired
anxiously, as she stood beside the table. âThereâs a
Dutch lady boarding with my brotherâs wife. She
showed me how to make real German ones.â

âI canât have you spoiling father,â reproved Lola
gently. âBesides German pan-cakes are not supposed
to be eaten for breakfast.â

âShe knows no more about German food,â said the

Â
Doctor, âthan an Irishmanâs pig! You shall make me
one of your pan-cakes to-night.â

Maria smiled gratefully at him, and leaving the
apartment ran down stairs to the letter-box in the hall,
returning a moment later with the morning mail,
which she put beside Lolaâs plate.

âFour letters,â said Lola, glancing over them. âOne
for me, a bill! Two for you, father.â She pushed
them across the cloth. âAnd, Maria! Oh, Maria!
This is for you. Oh, Maria! Youâre blushing. Who
do you suppose itâs from,â she teased, as Maria stepped
forward eagerly and took the letter.

âI guess, Miss,â said Maria in confusion, âI guess
itâs from a friend of mine.â

Lola looked after her, as she hurried out of the
room, the precious letter clutched tightly in her hand.

âPoor girl! That is from her sweetheart, the one
she calls Mr. Barnes, and she canât read it.â

âI thought you were to teach her,â remarked her
father, as he helped himself to a second piece of toast.

âI am trying my best,â answered Lola, âbut she
never had a chance before, thatâs what makes it so
hard for her now.â

Â
âShe has done wonders since you found her, my
dear girl. She has caught the spirit of this great New York,
and she is growing very fast.â

âHello!â he exclaimed, as he opened the first of his
letters. âFrom Paul Crossett.â

Lola looked up, surprised and pleased, as her father
hastily read the brief note, and continued.

âHe is here, at last! Here in New York! And he
is coming up this morning.â

âThatâs fine!â exclaimed Lola, her face reflecting
her fatherâs pleasure. âI have heard so much about
him all my life, and now I am really going to see him.â

âI, myself,â said the Doctor, âhave only seen him
once in ten years, only twice in twenty. He is a great
man now, rich and famous, but he was a scamp when
I first knew him.â He laughed softly as his mind
travelled back to the time when he and this successful
French physician were boys together at the University.

âHow was it?â inquired Lola, âthat a Frenchman
was your chum at Heidelberg?â

âHe was,â her father replied, âeven as a boy, a
cynic, a philosopher, and he amused me. He had a
big mind, and a big heart, and I loved him.â

Â
As he spoke he opened the second letter, and after
a momentâs reading looked up at Lola, his face reflecting
an almost comic dismay. âListen, Lola! âMy
dear Doctor,ââ he read slowly, his voice betraying his
surprise and growing distress, ââI am going to call
upon you to-morrow, and ask you to do me a great
honor. I love your daughterââââ he stopped helplessly,
almost like a child, afraid to continue.

Lola rose from the table, blushing furiously, but
with a happy light underlying the guilty look in her
eyes.

âFather!â

He looked at her for a moment, and gradually his
look softened and the surprise gave way to a humorous
tenderness.

âLetâs tear it up,â he suggested, holding the unwelcome
paper out before him. âI think that would be
the best way out of this.â

âOh, no, father!â exclaimed Lola, catching his hand
anxiously; âdo go on, itâs very interesting.â

âOh,â said the Doctor drily, âthen we will proceed.
âI love your daughter, and I want to ask you to let her
become my wife.ââ

Â
âAnd to think,â said Lola, as he paused, âand to
think that I didnât know his handwriting.â

âSo! So you know who had the impudence to write
this,â assumed her father.

âWell,â replied Lola rather timidly, âI have my suspicions.â

âOh, this love business,â groaned the Doctor in
great disgust; âjust as I have everything fixed, this
must come! It is Mr. Fenway, I suppose?â

âFather!â cried Lola, indignantly. âMr. Fenway!
The idea!â

The Doctor turned the page quickly and read the
signature, then exclaimed to her in wonder, âJohn
Dorris! And I thought he only came here to talk to
me! Did you know anything of this?â

âAnything?â replied Lola. âWell, IâI told him to
write to you.â

For just a moment he hesitated; they were alone
together in the world, these two, and the bond between
them had been very close, and now all was to
be changed; this stranger, a man, whom a few months
before they had never seen, had stepped into their lives,
and never again would this manâs child be to him quite

Â
what she had been for so many peaceful, happy years.

JAMES YOUNG AS DICK FENWAY.

Something of the bitterness of this thought must
have become visible in his face, for Lola stepped to
him anxiously, and he, generous and afraid of hurting
any living creature as he always was, smiled at her
tenderly and put his arm about her as he spoke
gravely: âGod bless you Lola, and if he is the right
man, God bless you both.â

She nestled against him, reassured by his tone, and
he continued, âJohn Dorris, a fine fellow, but I thought
for a moment that it must be Dick Fenway.â

âFather,â she protested, âit isnât at all like you to be
so silly! Dick Fenway is nothing butâbut a millionaire!â

âAm I supposed to sympathize with him for that?â
inquired the Doctor gravely. âBut, my dear,â he
added, as he saw that she was mutely appealing for
his sympathy, âI like your young man best, although
he is like the rest of us; he isnât half good enough for
the woman he loves.â

He led her tenderly into the front room, and seating
himself in his favorite old chair, drew her down
upon one of its sturdy arms, and began to question

Â
her about John Dorris. At first she was conscious
and embarrassed, but little by little, reassured by his
sympathy, she opened her heart to him, and let him
see that this new love that had come into her life was
not a passing fancy, but a feeling so pure and tender
that he sat awed before it, as all good men are awed
when for a moment it is permitted them to read the
secrets of a womanâs heart. He helped her greatly in
that half hour, and as she clung to him, timid, half
afraid even of her own happiness, he spoke to her of
her mother and of what her love had been to him.

In all the world I think there is no stronger tie, no
closer sympathy, than there is between a father and
a daughter, and these two felt that then, and gloried
in it, never dreaming of that awful thing that was so
soon to come between them.

At last he left her, and went to change his clothes,
and when Maria entered the room ten minutes later,
she still sat there, her loverâs letter in her hand, her
mind filled with strange, new thoughts, half happiness,
half fear.

Maria went to her, and seeing the look on her face,

Â
and the open letter in her hand, said timidly, âThatâs
a letter from him?â

âYes,â smiled Lola happily, âfrom him!â

âSo is mine, Miss,â volunteered poor Maria, âbut
I canât read it.â Lola turned quickly to her.

âShall I read it for you?â

âThank you, Miss, I knew you would, but Iâd be
ashamed to have him know it. He ainât like most of
the young fellars hanging around. Heâs smart! Heâs
a sailor, on the
Vermont
, and heâs just fine!â

âThis is from Boston,â said Lola, as she glanced
at the open letter Maria handed to her. âI am glad to
read it for you, of course, but before long I am going
to have you so that you will be able to read his letters
for yourself.â

âI hope so, Miss Lola, but Iâm awful slow. I donât
know what Iâd do if it wasnât for you,â she continued
gratefully; âthere ainât anybody else in the world I
could bear to see reading his letters. Iâd rather just
keep them, without ever knowing what he said. Itâs
a lot just to know that a person wants to write to you.â

ââBoston, June Third,â began Lola. âRespected
Friend: I write you these lines to say that I am well,

Â
and I hope you are the same. Boston is a fine City,
with lots of people and many buildings. There is water
here with ships and things in it, just like New
York. I often think of you, and no girl seems like
you to me, so no more from,

ââYours respectfully,

ââWm. Barnes.ââ

âAinât that a fine letter?â said Maria, with great
admiration. âGetting letters like that makes me more
ashamed than ever. Iâm afraid Iâm too ignorant to
appreciate all he tells about the countries he visits.â

âIt is a very fine letter, I am sure, Maria, and he
must be a fine fellow, and very fond of you?â

âOh, yes, Iâm sure he is,â replied Maria happily.
âAt first I wouldnât have nothing to do with him, but
he kept on coming around,âand now Iâm glad he
did. After what I saw at home I about made up my
mind not to let any man come near me, butâbut somehow
heâs different. He wouldnât act like father, or
like my sisterâs husband, I know; heâs the kind that
seems to think a girl ought to be taken care of; thatâs
nice, when you never had anybody that thought that in
all your life, isnât it?â

Â
âItâs very nice, Maria,â replied Lola, quite touched
by the tone of real affection in Mariaâs voice. âI am
sure that it is the nicest thing in the world.â As she
spoke a ring of the bell interrupted them, and Maria,
hastily putting the precious letter in her apron pocket,
went to the door and admitted a shabby little woman
and a delicate child.

âGood morning, Mrs. Mooney,â said Lola, as she
caught sight of them. âGood morning, Nellie! Come
right in. Tell father, Maria!â she continued, and as
Maria left the room she bent over little Nellie and
kissed her tenderly, then turned to the anxious mother
and did her best to put her at her ease.

âIâm afraid weâre too early, Miss,â began Mrs.
Mooney, in that tired, colorless voice that tells its own
story of hardship and hopelessness, âbut Nellie couldnât
rest at all last night. We donât want to be bothering
your father, though; heâs been kind enough already.â

âHe is quite ready for you, Iâm sure,â replied Lola,
âbut I will go to him; he might need me to help him
with his things.â As she left the room Nellie looked
after her wistfully.

âThereâs nobody I ever see like her,â she said, in

Â
that tone one often hears in childrenâs voices when
they speak of those whom they have selected for that
strange form of hero worship so common to the young.
âWhen he hurts me, and I have to cry, Iâll see her with
the tears in her eyes.â

âI know,â replied her mother gratefully; âit was she
that first brought the Doctor to see you, and heâll cure
you yet, and if they do thatâââ She stopped for a
moment and clutched at her breast, as though to tear
away the dread and anguish that was there. âItâs all
right, Nellieâitâs all right, Iâm telling you! Youâre
going to be as good as any of âem yet!â

LOLA VISITS THE MOONEY FAMILY.

CHAPTER II

A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

Doctor Martin Barnhelm
had for
over twenty years practised medicine in New
York. Aside from the fact that he was thoroughly
qualified for his profession, he had a gentle,
kindly manner that made him popular with all his patients.
His might have been an unusual success, but
of late years he had devoted more and more of his
time to research work. He had a growing reputation
in the medical world, as an expert in the development
of electro-medical apparatus, and unknown to anyone
he was devoting all his energies to the realization of a
theory, which to his mind at least promised to be the
most important medical discovery since the introduction
of antiseptic surgery. In the front room of his
apartment he carried on his experiments, and so complete
was his devotion to the object of his ambition
that he scarcely allowed himself time to earn, by his
profession, even the modest sum necessary for the

Â
household expenses. Lola saw that his heart was
wholly set upon this one idea, and without in the least
understanding its purpose, aided him by rigid economy,
and had even, against his rather faint protest,
begun to add to the family income by teaching in a
settlement school.

Although the Doctor had so jealously guarded his
time that he had lost most of his wealthy patients, he
had never been able to deny his professional aid to
those unfortunates from whom no other fee than gratitude
could be expected. Nellie Mooney was one of
these. She had inherited from a vicious father the
tainted blood and the weakened constitution, which,
helped on by the bad air and insufficient nourishment
of the poor of the crowded tenement district, had resulted
in a tubercular disease of the bone of her right
arm.

Mrs. Mooney brought the child twice a week for
treatment, but of late the disease had been gaining
headway, and in spite of the Doctorâs best efforts, she
was in constant agony. He was treating her now in
the little alcove he used as his office, and outside, with

Â
the curtains drawn, Lola was doing her best to soothe
the almost frantic mother.

The treatment, in spite of all the Doctorâs gentleness,
was painful in the extreme, and Lola was anxious
to spare the poor woman the sight of her daughterâs
suffering, but at the sound of a stifled cry from
behind the curtains, Mrs. Mooney was unable to restrain
herself, and rushed toward the next room with
a cry of agony.

âPlease,â said Lola, as she gently stopped her.
âThey are better without you.â

âIâm going to her,â exclaimed the mother, quite unable
to withstand the thought of her child suffering
alone. âYou donât know what it is, Miss Lola; Iâve
got to go.â

As she spoke she drew the curtain aside, and entered
the alcove, and Lola would have followed had
not a ring of the bell made her pause and go to the
door. It was still early in the forenoon, and as Lola
opened the door she fully expected to be greeted by
another of the Doctorâs patients, but in place of that
a young man stood smiling on the threshold.

âJohn!â she exclaimed happily, then stopped shyly

Â
as he stepped eagerly forward and put his arm around
her. It was only the night before that he had told her
of his love, and she was still afraid of him, but he,
manlike, refused to give up an advantage already won,
and drew her to him, holding her closely until she, of
her own accord, raised her lips to his.

âDid he read my letter?â he asked eagerly and
rather nervously.

Now she had him at an advantage, for however
great his fear was of her father, she had none at all.

âOh, yes,â she replied, smiling, âand he is perfectly
furious.â

As she saw his face fall she would have reassured
him, but just then a moan of anguish from the alcove
made him turn his head inquiringly.

âIt is the little Mooney girl,â she answered, in reply
to his unspoken question. âIt is some dreadful disease
of the bone, but father hopes to be able to help her.â

âPoor little girl,â said John, as he offered her a
cluster of gorgeous roses that he had brought with
him.

Lola took the flowers with a word of thanks, as the

Â
Doctor threw open the curtains and entered with his
arm about Nellie, and followed by Mrs. Mooney.

âThere,â he exclaimed, âit is over now. You are
a brave girl, Nellie. You must bring her again on
Saturday, Mrs. Mooney.â

âYou are not faint, are you, Nellie?â said Lola,
alarmed at the childâs paleness.

âOh, no, Miss,â replied Nellie bravely, her eyes
fastened with wondering admiration on the beautiful
roses.

âTake them,â said Lola impulsively, holding them
out to her, but she shrank back, afraid.

âOh, no! Why, you just got them yourself.â

âHe doesnât mind, do you?â Lola demanded of
John, and he answered so pleasantly and cordially that
the child was persuaded to accept them, and was taken
home by her mother in such a glow of gratitude that
for the moment, at least, her pain was forgotten.

American Beauty roses, at a dollar each, on the window-sill
of a wretched tenement! An extravagance,
no doubt, and yet I wonder if they would have better
fulfilled their destiny had they met the usual fate of

Â
their fellows and been trampled under foot upon the
floor of some crowded ball room.

As Lola closed the door after Nellie and Mrs.
Mooney, she turned to see John and her father eyeing
one another, with the consciousness of the necessary
interview showing in their faces. She laughed happily
and, crossing to the Doctor, pointed to John, who
stood rather stiffly beside the table.

âThere is John, father.â

âHumph,â said he, coldly, determined at least that
the young manâs path should not be made too easy,
âso I see.â

âIâI,â began John, rather lamely, âIâerâââ

Lola laughed merrily, and catching one by each
hand drew them together, looking up at them, her
face so radiant that in a moment their stiffness was
forgotten, and they joined in her laugh.

âNo use trying to be formal, John, while she is
laughing at us.â

âNo, sir,â replied John heartily, as he accepted the
otherâs proffered hand; âall that I am going to say is
that I shall do my best to make her happy.â

âYou wonât have any great trouble there, my boy.

Â
She has always been happy, and always will be ifâif
you will always love her.â

âI think I may safely promise that,â said John,
smiling confidently. âIt doesnât seem to be difficult.â

âYou are very happy, you two,â continued the Doctor,
glancing from one to the other, âand will you believe
an old man when he tells you that it is the only
happiness that is real? A happiness so great that even
if death comes, the memory is still the dearest feeling
in your hearts. I have no sermon for you. God bless
you, and help you, so long as you shall live.â

âWe are having a little trouble already, Doctor, and
I want your help,â said John boldly. âI want you to
tell her that she must marry me at once.â

âJohn,â cried Lola, indignantly, âI havenât any idea
at all of being married for months!â

âAh!â smiled the Doctor hopefully. âPerhaps, if
you quarrel with him about it, we may get rid of him
yet. That would be good news for me, yes, and for
poor Dick Fenway!â

âDonât tease,â protested Lola, âand, anyway, Mr.
Fenway isnât poor; he is a millionaire.â

âI suppose,â said John, âthat it is rather an obvious

Â
thing for me to say, but I donât like that man. It isnât
that I am jealous. I was once, I will admit, but after
last night I am not afraid of him. But he isnât on the
level. I have the right to tell you now, Lola,â he continued,
turning to her. âI knew him in Cleveland two
years ago. He comes here to your house, and takes
you to theatres and concerts.â

Lola looked at him, surprised. âSurely I am not
going to make the sudden discovery that I have bound
myself to a jealous old Ogre, am I?â she inquired.

âFenway,â said John bluntly, âhas a wife in Cleveland.â

The Doctorâs face grew stern, and Lola looked both
shocked and distressed.

âJohn!â she exclaimed in dismay, for she liked
young Fenway, and more than either of the others
knew that, if this thing were true, he had done his
best to deceive her.

âHe married a telephone girl in one of the big hotels,â
went on John, anxious to get the unpleasant
story over, for he had a manâs feeling of loyalty to his
sex, and hated to be placed in the position of a tale
bearer.

Â
âHe has been trying ever since to get a divorce, but
she wonât let him. It isnât a thing a fellow likes to
talk about, but itâs true.â

âThank you,â said the Doctor gravely; âmy home
is not large enough to hold that sort of man. I shall
tell him so if he calls again.â

âI am sorry, very sorry,â said Lola. âThere was
something about him I always liked, and it hurts me
to think that he tried to deceive me as he did.â

âBah!â protested the Doctor. âThe world is full
of men like that, but once you know them, they are
harmless. Donât look sad, my dear; it is so easy to
forget all about him.â

It was not so easy, however, for Lola to forget Dick
Fenwayâs deceit as her father fancied. Only a few
weeks before he had told her that he loved her, and
when she had gently refused him he had shown such
bitter disappointment that she had been quite touched,
and had ever since done her best to be kind to him.
Now the thought that at the time he had spoken of his
love for her he had had a wife filled her with amazement.
Lola knew little of the evil of the world, but
she felt that here there was something wrong, and it

Â
disturbed her. Long after John had gone to his business,
and her father had left to meet his old friend,
Doctor Crossett, she sat thinking it over, and the more
she thought the more distressed she became.

Dick Fenway had been brought to the house by a
friend of Johnâs, and from the first she had been attracted
by his gayety and recklessness. He was a
great contrast to the men she had known. Careless,
rich and happy, and there was something about the
young man that had made a strong appeal to the maternal
feeling that is in every woman, however young
or unworldly she may be. Fenwayâs habit of depending
upon her for advice, his very confession of careless
helplessness, had put him somewhat in the position
of a child whom she felt it her duty to help with
advice and counsel.

At first, when a little later Maria told her that he
was waiting for her in the front room, she decided
not to go to him, but, on second thought, she changed
her mind, and thinking it best to have the whole matter
definitely settled, she entered the room gravely, perhaps
a little sadly.

KIND HEARTED DOCTOR BARNHELM ATTENDS THE SICK CHILD OF MRS. MOONEY.

âGood morning, Miss Barnhelm,â said Fenway, as

Â
he rose to meet her. âI know itâs too early for a call,
but I wanted you to come for a ride in my new car.
Itâs downstairs.â

âNo, thank you, Mr. Fenway.â

âOh, but youâve got to try it. Sheâs a corker. Why,
I was thinking of you when I bought it.â

âWere you?â said Lola coldly.

âYes, honestly. Why, you know, Lola, thatâââ

âHow long is it since you have heard from your
wife in Cleveland?â interrupted Lola.

For a moment his surprise silenced him; then he
turned upon her angrily.

âWhoâs been telling you my business?â he demanded,
almost roughly.

âDo you think,â asked Lola gently, âthat she would
share in your desire for me to try your new car?â

âI didnât want you to know about her,â he answered,
a queer expression of mingled shame and determination
on his face. âIt happened a long time ago. I
was a fool, more even of a fool than usual, when I
married her. I havenât seen her in almost two years,
andâand Iâm never going to see her again.â

âFather was angry when he heard that you were

Â
married,â said Lola, looking at him calmly, and with
no expression of anger in her face. âHe thought that
you had not been quite honest about it.â

âWhat did you think?â questioned Fenway.

âI was very much surprised and a little hurt. Father
is going to ask you not to come here again. That
is why I was glad to speak to you before he did.â

âThen you wonât let it quite queer me with you?â
exclaimed the young man eagerly. âSheâs bound to
give me a chance to divorce her, sooner or later. Iâm
having her watched, every breath she draws. Even
if your father wonât let me come here youâll see me
sometimes, wonât you?â

âNo, Mr. Fenway, I shanât see you again. Father
is right about that, but I am glad you came here to-day.
Surely we have been good friends enough for
me to ask you, for your own sake, to be worthy of the
better side that I know is in you. This girl is your
wife; you yourself say that she has not done anything
wrong. Wouldnât it be better toâââ

âDonât talk about her,â said Dick, savagely.

âIâm afraid that we canât talk at all, unless we talk
about her. A man with as kind a heart as yours

Â
couldnât have meant to wrong her, or me, or any other
girl. I hoped that I was enough your friend to be
able to ask you to go back to her, if you can, and if
you canât, to tell you that you ought to be honest with
the persons who trust you! There! Iâve said it!â And
she stood looking at him for a moment. Then, softening,
she extended her hand.

âGood-bye!â

He stood looking at her, then stepped forward
boldly and took her hand.

âLola,â and as he spoke there was a tone of passion
in his voice that frightened her, âI love you!â

She looked him in the face and answered gently, âI
am going to marry John Dorris.â

âNotânot because of thisâthis damned story you
heard about me?â

âNo,â replied Lola quietly. âBecause I love him.â

He stepped back, dropping her hand, and for the
first time since she had known him a look of real sadness
came into his face.

âIâI guess thereâs nothing for me to do but go. I
have usually had most everything I wanted in this

Â
world, but now if Iâm going to lose you Iâm getting
the worst of things, after all.â

âI am sorry,â began Lola, but he shook his head
impatiently and crossed to the door. âI havenât any
use for your sympathy. You say you are going to
marry John Dorris, but you havenât done it yet. You
say that you are not going to see me again. I donât
believe that, Lola. You donât love me. I know, but
you donât love him either. You donât know what love
is, and when you learn it wonât be from John Dorris.â

He closed the door behind him, and she heard him
running down the stairs as she stood there with a
strange dread in her heart.

Â

CHAPTER III

DR. PAUL CROSSETT

From
her window, a few hours later, Lola could
see her father as he turned in from Eighth
Avenue and walked briskly toward the house.
With him was a rather short, extremely animated, and
perfectly groomed gentleman, whom she at once knew
to be Doctor Paul Crossett. Even from that distance
she could plainly see that, although she knew him to
be a man of her fatherâs age, he had the look of one
much younger.

It would be a bold man who would dare to state
that married life and the atmosphere of a home do
more to bring about grey hairs and wrinkles than the
emptiness of a bachelorâs existence, but in this case, at
least, the contrast was startling.

Paul Crossett, quite fifty, had, and looked to have,
all the enthusiasms of youth. He was a Frenchman,
and to a close observer he was perhaps rather freer
in gesticulations than our somewhat stiff New Yorkers,

Â
but he was far from being the Frenchman of the comic
supplement. Indeed, Paul Crossett was a real citizen
of the world, quite as much at home in New York,
London or Berlin as he was in Paris. He was one
of the best known authorities on nervous disorders in
the medical world, besides being a surgeon of international
reputation. As he entered the room with her
father a moment later, Lola advanced to meet him
with a smile, but, to her surprise, at the sight of her
he stopped, and a look of deep sorrow, almost of fear,
came into his face.

âThis is Lola, Paul,â said the Doctor proudly.

In a moment the look on Dr. Crossettâs face changed
to one of eager welcome, and he stepped forward and
took both of her extended hands in his.

âYou are as your mother was,â he said gently, then
as he stooped to kiss her saying softly, âMy age permits,â
she saw a tear on his smooth, almost boyish
cheek, and with a womanâs quick intuition she understood
and loved him for the love he had had for her
mother, whom he had not seen since his early manhood,
but whom he had never forgotten, and never
could forget.

E. M. KIMBALL AS DOCTOR CROSSET.

Â
In that moment grew up between those two an affection
and an understanding that under happier circumstances
would have lasted all their lives. In the
awful time, now so rapidly approaching, he was to
be her truest friend. His love and sympathy was to
outlast that of lover and father. He gave to her the
place in his heart that her mother had always had,
the same blind love and devotion, and it was hers until
the end.

âI am glad to know you, Doctor Crossett,â said
Lola, a little timidly, as he stepped away from her, now
smiling merrily.

âSo,â he replied heartily, as he looked around the
room curiously. âSo! this is one of your famous New
York apartments?â

âNo, Paul,â said Dr. Barnhelm, rather ruefully,
âthis is a flat.â

âBut what is the difference?â

âAbout a hundred dollars a month.â

âBut surely you are not poor, Martin, you, with
your mind?â

âMy dear Paul, it takes twenty-four hours a day

Â
to make a good living here in New York, and I could
not spare the time.â

âI see,â exclaimed Dr. Crossett, as his keen eyes
fell upon the complicated electrical apparatus on the
table. âYou had a better use for it.â He crossed
and bent over the affair with deep professional interest.

âSo? A high frequency, a most peculiar and most
powerful interrupter. Not for the X-ray? No, then
for what?â

âI am going to tell you all about it. There is no
man in America, and only one other in Europe, who
could judge of it as you could judge. It is ten yearsâ
work, Paul; it has meant poverty to both of us, but
it is a big thing.â

âTell me,â said Dr. Crossett eagerly.

âTell him, father,â interrupted Lola, âwhile I run
to the store. I will only be a few moments, and you
wonât miss me. When I come back, Doctor Crossett,â
she smiled at him frankly, âI am going to make you
explain to me all about it. Father never would.â

She left them, in spite of Dr. Crossettâs offers to
accompany her, and as the door closed behind her he

Â
stood for a moment looking after her, and from her
to a framed picture of her mother that hung on the
wall.

âNine years, Martin,â he laid his slender, powerful
hand gently on his old friendâs shoulder; ânine years
since you wrote me that her motherâââ

They stood together for a moment in silence before
the Doctor answered: âYes, Paul, nine years.â

âI was with you in my heart,â the Frenchman continued,
âbut, tutâtutâ! Come, you have discoveredâwhat?â

As he turned away the bell rang, and with a word
of excuse Dr. Barnhelm stepped to the door and admitted
John Dorris.

âLola told me to wait for her here,â said the young
man cheerfully. âShe wouldnât let me go with her,
to tell the truth; I am taking a little holiday, and I
donât quite know what to do with myself.â

The Doctor turned to his friend, smiling.

âEach of us, Doctor Crossett, as we grow older
accumulate troubles. Will you let me present my
worst, Mr. John Dorris?â

Â
âI am pleased,â said the Frenchman, bowing, âbut
shall I confess that I do not understand?â

âI am going to marry Lola,â said John frankly, as
he stepped forward and offered his hand.

âAh! Now I do understand,â responded Dr. Crossett.
âThen Dr. Barnhelm has my sympathy, and you
my approval. You have at least, good taste.â

âThank you, Doctorâam I in the way?â inquired
John, turning to Dr. Barnhelm.

âNot at all. I was about to explain my pet hobby;
as you will often have to hear about it, it might be a
good thing if you were to listen now. I will spare you
the technical description, John; you would not understand,
and you, Paul, are of course familiar with this
apparatus. This, then, is an instrument by which, if
I am right, and I am convinced that there is no doubt
of that, I can restore life to a person who has been
dead for many hours.â

âDoctor!â cried John, horrified and anxious; and he
turned to Dr. Crossett, expecting him to share in
his belief that long hours of brooding over his experiments
had turned the old manâs brain, but, to his intense
surprise, he read nothing but eager interest in

Â
the Frenchmanâs face, as the latter bent over the instrument
and inquired earnestly: âMany hours, Martin?â

âFive,â replied Dr. Barnhelm; âperhaps six, possibly
seven!â

âThat has not been claimed before?â

âI can do it.â

âYou can restore the dead to life?â demanded John
with such disbelief and distress in his voice that Dr.
Crossett turned to him with a kindly smile and said
gently, âYou need not look at your future father-in-law
in horror, my dear young friend. He is not mad.
I have studied these things, as perhaps you know. In
Paris I have seen the experiment tried. I have seen
the heart action cease and later be resumed. I have
seen muscular activity stimulated and the patient,
whom I myself had pronounced dead, rise and walk
unaided from the operating room. Butââhe stopped
and for a moment eyed his old friend keenlyââbut
only has this been done in my peculiar case, and never
more than five minutes after the last flutter of the
pulse!â

âMy theory is right,â replied Dr. Barnhelm with

Â
deep conviction. âMy instrument is right! As yet I
have been unable to demonstrate it upon a human being
for want of a subject, but I have succeeded always
with the lower animals.â

âYou claim what, Martin?â continued Dr. Crossett.
âThat you can restore the heart action to those
who die, of what?â

The Doctor smiled slightly as he replied:

âDeath is what? When the heart ceases to beat!
Life is what? When it beats on, untroubled. I can
take the body of a man whose pulse has not fluttered
in hours, and I can bring the beating of his heart back!
I can bring him back to life!â

He looked almost in triumph into the earnest, sympathetic
face of his friend, then turned to John, but
his smile left him at what he saw in the young manâs
eyes.

âDonât say that, Doctor,â begged John, earnestly.
âI canât believe that it is true, and if it is, it is horrible!â

âI do not claim to
give
life,â explained the older
man gently, âonly to restore it. For how long depends
upon the nature of the disease of which the

Â
patient dies. Old age must always have its victims.
I cannot check decay, nor cancer, nor tuberculosis.
There are many cases where, if I were to bring my
patient back to life, it would be but to die again, but
there are many, many times when I can, and will,
restore life to those who die by accident, by drowning,
by heart failure, by shock!â

âIt is sacrilege!â cried John in horror. âSuppose
that a man dies, and his body is brought to you. Do
you claim that you will give him back his life?â

âI do,â answered the Doctor firmly.

âWhat of his soul?â

âJohn,â exclaimed the doctor, startled and offended
by the question.

âWhen a man dies,â continued John earnestly,
âmore than the throbbing of his pulse leaves him. The
thing we call a soul, whatever it may be, wherever it
may be, goes out with his life, out of his body to a life
everlasting. In Godâs name, how dare you talk of
bringing that empty shell back into the living world?â

âI have lived for over twenty years in the dissecting
room,â remarked Dr. Crossett, with rather a contemptuous
smile. âI know the human body. They

Â
differ very little, each organ has its place, all is completeâI
have not found a soul.â

âWe do not think alike there, Paul,â said Dr. Barnhelm
gravely. âThere is something, a soul, an intelligence,
call it what you will, but it is not tangible, and
it is divine! I mean no sacrilege. Why, this theory
of mine, the truth of which I am prepared to prove,
has been my prayer, and now it has been granted. It
is for the good of humanity.â

âI donât like it,â replied John nervously. âYou
know best, I suppose, and I am going to try to take
your word for it, but I donât like it. If you donât
mind, Iâll go and meet Lola. It may be all right, I
suppose it is, if you say so, but it gives me the fidgets.â

He left the room as he spoke, and as he closed the
door and started down the stairs he heard them laughing
together.

âHe is not a physician,â said Dr. Crossett as soon as
John was out of hearing.

âNo,â replied Dr. Barnhelm. âHe is a bank clerk.â

âBank clerk! La! Then why try to make him understand?
Come, tell me all about this,â and he
looked critically at the apparatus before him.

Â
âIt is the theory,â began the Doctor, âof a tremendously
interrupted electrical current applied to the
heart. The high frequency in itself is not new.â

âNo,â agreed Dr. Crossett. âRomanoff, Thailer,
Woodstock, eh?â

âYes, but the application is new, and also I have
here a Mercury Turbine Interrupter of my own invention.
I can get over thirty thousand more interruptions
a second than were ever before obtained. With
it I have never once failed. It was the great high
frequency by which I won my battle. It is ready now
to show to the world.â

âAh! Your theoryâit is pretty.â

âIt is true.â

âThen,â exclaimed Dr. Crossett, âthere need be
no more of this.â He looked contemptuously around
the shabby room and out through the window at the
noisy, squalid neighborhood.

âTo live as New York lives! It is not civilization.
It is like the cave man, to live in a hole in a cliff. Bah!
To sit on an ugly chair, and to look at nothing, out of
dirty windows!â

âNew York,â laughed Dr. Barnhelm, âis the great

Â
market place of the world. You can buy anything
here, even beautiful surroundings.â

âThen you, Martin, shall buy them. This,â he
touched the electrical apparatus almost tenderly, âwill
bring fame and wealth. Happiness you had before.â

âIt has been selfish of me in a way, Paul,â began
the Doctor, as though trying to find excuses to satisfy
his own conscience, âbut Lola has not minded. She
is as Helen was. If she is surrounded by love and
tenderness, she is content. She does not ask fortune
for many of her favors.â

âShe does not need them, Martin.â

As Dr. Crossett spoke, from below, through the open
window, came the harsh clang of an ambulance bell,
and these two surgeons both stopped and listened, their
professional instinct unconsciously aroused.

âThere is a sound, Martin,â he continued, âthat is
understood in every country in the world.â

âThe ambulance stopped here at this house,â said
Dr. Barnhelm, with a trace of nervousness, and he
stepped to the window and looked out. âThere is a
crowd collecting. I wonderâââ

DOCTOR BARNHELM PERFECTS HIS MACHINE FOR RESTORING ANIMATION.

The door burst open, and John Dorris entered the

Â
room; as they saw his face, they knew at once that
the news he brought was bad news, and both being
brave men, they turned calmly and steadily to meet it.

âDoctor,â he panted hoarsely, âLolaâLola!â

âWell, John?â

It was the father who spoke, and his cool, even tone
did much to steady the boy.

âShe,â he continued brokenly, âsheâtheyâthey are
bringing her! There was an accident, sheâsheâââ
He stopped as Dick Fenway entered, so pale and wild,
that Dr. Crossett, to whom he was a stranger,
stepped forward, as though to offer to support him,
but stopped suddenly as Fenway cried out: âI did it!
It was my fault! As she crossed the Avenue I turned
my car, thinking she would stop, but she hated me,
and she wouldnât stop, andâandâI killed her.â

There was silence for a moment in the room, broken
only by Fenwayâs sobs and by a low moan of anguish
from the father. Then came a sound of stumbling
footsteps, slowly, very slowly advancing up the stairs.
The sound of men carrying a heavy burden.

âMy friend! Be brave!â and Paul Crossett put his
arm about his old friendâs shoulders. âWe will fight

Â
for her life, you and I together, as life is not often
fought for.â

The footsteps had grown nearer, in the room there
was silence as the four men waited, in the court-yard
below a street organ began to play, and the foolish,
empty tune burned itself forever into their memories
as they stood there.

The footsteps hesitated for a moment on the landing
below, then began again, nearer, louder now, and
suddenly a big, red-faced policeman stood in the
doorway.

âHere?â he inquired, in that queer, impersonal voice
that speaks of long acquaintance with the tragedies of
life.

âYes,â replied John, hoarsely, âhere.â

An ambulance surgeon entered in response to the
officerâs nod, and following him came another policeman
and a white-coated driver; between them on a
stretcher they bore a covered form, very quiet, so quiet
that not even a movement stirred the blanket that covered
it.

As they put their burden down gently on the worn

Â
old couch the young surgeon turned to Dr. Barnhelm,
who stepped forward.

âIt is no use, sir. You canât do anything. It was
the heart, I think. She was not crushed, but she died
instantly. Can any of you give me the facts for my
report?â

Maria had entered the adjoining room, attracted by
the unusual sounds, and heard what he said, and as
she heard she cried out pitifully. The sound seemed
to add the finishing touch to the strain they were under,
and they turned sharply.

âGo, Maria!â said the Doctor, coldly. âAnswer
any questions this gentleman asks of you. Compose
yourself, please, and go.â

The girl turned without a word, and followed by
the surgeon went out into the hall, the driver and one
of the policemen joining them, while the other crossed
and touched Dick Fenway on the arm.

âYouâll have to come with me, sir,â he said quietly.

Fenway for a moment looked at him bewildered,
then stooped and picking up the hat he had dropped
on the floor, slowly walked to the door. At the door
he stopped and looked back at the covered figure on

Â
the couch, shuddered and went out, the officer following.

John closed the door softly behind them and turned
back to where the two men stood, Paul Crossettâs
hand on the fatherâs shoulder.

âCanâtâcanât you do anything,â he questioned,
âanything at all?â

âWait!â The word came like a command, sharply,
from Dr. Barnhelmâs lips. âPaul! You know what
I am going to do?â

Dr. Crossett nodded slightly. The meaning of it
came suddenly to John, and he cried out in protest,
âDoctor!â

âYou see her there! Dead!â The father spoke
slowly, calmly. âWell, I can bring her back! She
is my daughter.â He turned quietly to John, but with
a look in his eyes that few men would have dared
oppose.

âShall I let her die? Iâwho can save her?â

âNo,â the young man spoke humbly, âno. IâI love
her too.â

âGoâwait outside. Goânow!â and John went
with just one look at the still form on the couch.

Â
âI am ready, Martin,â said Dr. Crossett, when they
were alone, and he threw off his coat and stepping to
the table starting to connect the batteries and adjust
his instrument with the practical hand of an expert.
For just one moment the father faltered.

âIt is only a theory, Paul. It may fail.â

âWe are here,â replied his friend steadily, âto make
that theory fact. You must direct me. Call the interruptions
as you want them.â

The doctor crossed to the couch, and drawing aside
the blanket stood looking down at Lola. In that moment
all that this child of his meant to him came into
his mind, and the thought gave him strength. The
fear and grief died, and in their place came firmness,
confidence. He knelt and deftly unfastened her dress
and bared her girlish breast, then crossing to the table
took in each hand a glass electrode connected by long
wires to the powerful machine, and slowly returned
to where his daughter lay.

âNow, Paul!â

A touch of Dr. Crossettâs practised hand and the
great machine came to life. Back and forth in the coil
violet sparks jumped, flashing, sparkling. From the

Â
electrodes in his strong hands a million tiny specks of
light sprang angrily, and when for a moment he held
them close together these specks became a solid bar of
violet light, almost a flame. The noise was deafening,
the solid crash of the leaping current, as Dr. Crossett
gradually moved his index up to its full strength,
rang through the little room and echoed back from the
walls, the vibrations so close that to any but a practiced
ear they sounded like one steady roar.

Once again he paused beside the couch, and an electrode
in each hand, the violet light dancing all about
him, he raised his eyes in a short prayer. âGod help
me,â he said, his voice half buried in the riot of sound.
âDonât hold my pride against me. I ask it, not as the
inventor, but as the father.â

He did not speak again, nor did the friend who
stood watchfully beside the spluttering, crashing machine.
Three times he held the electrodes to her body,
one over her heart, one against her back, but there was
no movement, no sign of life. The leaping sparks
seemed to pass through her tender frame, but she lay
there still, with that awful stillness of the dead. The
man, working over her, the father no longer, but the

Â
physician, the inventor, did not hesitate. Again and
again she was enfolded in the bright beams of violet
light. Again and again he held the leaping current
to her heart, and at last, when, for what seemed to be
the hundredth time he drew back and looked at her,
his whole body suddenly stiffened, a hoarse cry burst
from him, and he fell crashing to the floor.

Dr. Crossett shut off the current and sprang to him.
He had fainted, and turning from him to Lola, Paul
Crossett saw what the father had seen. A soft color
slowly stealing back into that white face and a slow,
steady rising and falling of her breast as her heart began
again to beat.

Â

CHAPTER IV

BROUGHT TO LIFE

On
the following day the papers devoted a few
lines to the accidental injury of a young girl,
âLola Barnhelm, daughter of Dr. Martin
Barnhelm, a physician in good standing in the neighborhood.â
The fact that âthe automobile by which
the young lady was injured belonged to Richard Fenway,
the well-known Wall Street broker, son of old
Dick Fenway of Cleveland, and a well-known figure
in the life of the âBroadway crowd,ââ seemed to be of
more general interest than the account of her injury,
but two of the papers noted the fact that âshe was at
first pronounced dead and later found to be merely
suffering from shock.â

What Dr. Barnhelm and Dr. Crossett said to one
another no one besides themselves ever knew. To
John, after the moment when Dr. Crossett went to
him, white-faced, and awed, and told him that Lola
was alive, they said nothing.

Â
John was content. He loved her, and she had come
back to him! Had she for those few moments been
really dead, or had the young ambulance surgeon been
mistaken? What did it matter? Late that night they
had allowed him to creep softly to her chamber door,
and looking in he had seen her sleeping quietly, and
they assured him that, aside from a probable nervous
shock, she was quite unharmed.

In the days that followed the nervous shock turned
out to be more serious than was at first supposed.
Physically, Lola seemed to be in good condition, but
for the first time in her life she was unjust, irritable,
and jealous. Dr. Crossett claimed this to be a fine
symptom of returning health.

âTemper,â he remarked cheerfully, âis the copyright
trade-mark of the convalescent,â but to John her
sudden, unreasonable fits of anger and a feeling that
in anyone but Lola he would have described as selfishness
amazed and alarmed him.

Dr. Barnhelm, too, seemed changed, but in his case
the change was for the better. He was closeted all
day, and often almost all night with his machine, and
its low throbbing penetrated the whole building and

Â
brought indignant protests from the other tenants,
protests that were received by the Doctor with a slow
smile of contempt and at once forgotten.

From the moment when he was assured of his
daughterâs safety, he buried himself in his work, calm
and happy, with little thought for anything but this
great discovery of hisâthis wonderful invention that
was to do so much for suffering humanity.

Dr. Crossett left them after the first few days to
keep some important engagement in the West, but before
he left he had insisted upon advancing Dr. Barnhelm
a sum of money sufficient for his needs, enough
to allow him freedom to complete his experiments and
prepare the elaborate models necessary for a demonstration
before the Medical Society.

At first Dr. Barnhelm had refused to accept the
favor, but Lola, greatly to his surprise, had sided
against him, and more to please her than for any
other reason he had taken the money on the understanding
that it was to be repaid out of the first profits
of his invention. At the time there seemed little reason
to doubt his ability to repay his friend. Fame
and success mean much to a physicianâs income, and

Â
after the proof he had so lately had how could he consider
anything but success possible? He gave up his
practice, excepting only a few of his old charity patients,
and turning the borrowed money over to Lola,
who had for a long time been in the habit of controlling
the family purse, he buried himself in his work.

For over two months Dr. Crossett travelled, first
to Chicago, then to Denver, and from there to San
Francisco. Everywhere he was received with the honors
due to a man of his high standing in the medical
world, and allowed full opportunity to compare the
treatment of nervous disorders with the methods of
the best physicians of his own country. He had come
as the representative of the French society, of which
he was president, and it was his object to gather
enough information to aid him in the writing of a book
upon this subject. He heard once from Dr. Barnhelm,
notifying him of a change in their address from
upper Eighth Avenue to an apartment on Riverside
Drive. No explanation for the change was offered,
the rest of the letter being a long account of the progress
of his work and a few words about Lola, that

Â
she had quite recovered her health and seemed to be in
unusually high spirits.

For some weeks after this he had been travelling
almost constantly, but on his return to Chicago he
found a short note waiting for him at his hotel. In
this note Dr. Barnhelm simply stated that he was in
trouble and anxious to see him. That it was nothing
that need cause him to cut short his stay in the West,
but that the matter was a delicate one, and that he was
anxious to see him immediately upon his return.

Dr. Crossett was rather alarmed by the whole tone
of his old friendâs letter. Of Lola there was no mention,
but he could not free himself of a vague suspicion
that she must be the cause of her fatherâs evidently
deeply troubled mind, and he brought his business
affairs to an abrupt end and caught the next fast
train to New York.

It had been Spring when Dr. Crossett landed in
America; it was now Summer, and, as his taxi ran
smoothly up Fifth Avenue to the Park, the boarded-up
fronts of the houses suggested to him a plan for
forcing a brief extension of his vacation and spending
a week or two with Lola and her father at some of the

Â
famous American watering-places of which he had
often heard. His own splendid health and superb
vitality he owed, in part, to his habit of allowing himself
frequent intervals of mental rest and outdoor exercise,
and as he thought of how Lola would be benefited
by a change from the hot, stale air of the city to
some beautiful seashore or mountain resort, he smiled
to himself happily.

The cab stopped, and as he got out and turned to pay
the driver he noticed with surprised approval the unbroken
row of stately apartment houses facing the
green of Riverside Park and the wide expanse of the
Hudson. His old friend was growing wise he thought
to himself; here at least were grass, and trees, and
fresh air.

Maria admitted him, and showing him through a
wide foyer-hall into a pretty and well-furnished parlor,
turned to leave him, but he called her back anxiously.

âMiss Lola! Tell me, Maria?â

There was just a trace of hesitation as she answered.

Â
âVery well, I think, sir. I never saw her looking
better in my life.â

âGood! Good! Ah! The times, they have
changed,â and he looked around the daintily furnished
apartment smilingly. âIt is not as it was two months
ago.â

âNo, sir.â

âYou also,â as he noticed her neat black dress and
white cap and apron; âyou are a very pretty girl,
Maria.â

âThank you, sir.â

âDo not thank me,â he replied with a chuckle. âI
share in the pleasure it causes you. Now, Maria,
donât blush. I am old enough to be your father, and
I like you because you are good to those two who are
so dear to me. I am happy to see all these signs of
prosperity. The Doctorâs practice must have increased?â

âI donât think so, sir,â said Maria. âNo patients
ever come here, leastways none but the poor ones who
donât pay nothinâ.â

âSo? And yet he has not given the news of his
discovery to the world. I do not comprehend.â

Â
Maria hesitated for a moment, then faced him anxiously
as though to say something, but after a momentâs
pause she recovered herself and said respectfully:

âThe Doctor is out, sir. Miss Lola is dressing. She
will be here in a moment.â

âI am in no hurry,â he replied, ânow that you tell
me that all is well here. I am content to share in the
happiness of my friend. His daughter well; a fine
home; one could not hope for this two months ago!
Poverty, death! Pish!â and he snapped his fingers
contemptuously. âThey are gone! It is indeed the
age of miracles.â

âComing back like she did, sir,â retorted Maria,
âafter everyone thought she was dead, ainât a thing
that does a body any good! You couldnât expect her
to be quite so happy and so sweet as she used to be,
could you, Doctor?â

In the girlâs voice was so much of anxious inquiry,
such a tone of real sadness and regret, that he turned
to her alarmed, but at that moment Lola came into
the room. In the few seconds it took her to cross to
him, smiling, both hands extended in greeting, his

Â
practiced eye assured him that never in all his experience
had he seen a young woman in such superb physical
health. She was radiant! The simple little housedress
in which he had first seen her had been exchanged
for an elaborate afternoon costume. Her
skin was clear, he had remembered her as being pale,
even in the short time he had seen her before the accident;
but now she had a high color and an eager,
animated manner that spoke of an abundant reserve
of vitality.

âThere you are, Doctor,â she cried gaily, as he returned
the warm pressure of her hands. âI wonder
if you know how glad I am to see you?â

âNo, my dear,â he answered, ânot unless you are
reflecting my own pleasure in seeing you like this. I
was worrying about you, way off there in the West.
Were you well? Were you happy? Now I have but
to look at you.â

âYou are a flatterer, Doctor.â

As Lola turned from him smiling, her eyes fell on
Maria, who stood watching the Doctorâs face with a
curious look of eager curiosity, her look changed, and
she spoke sharply, almost cruelly.

Â
âWhat are you doing here, Maria?â

Maria flushed and tears came to her eyes as she
stammered, âIâIâââ

âYou may go.â

âYes, Miss.â

Maria left the room and Lola turned to find Dr.
Crossett looking at her in wonder. He knew of the
real affection that there had been between these two,
and his own tender heart told him how Lolaâs tone
must have hurt the girl who had so much reason to
think of her with affection and gratitude. He made
no effort to keep a look of reproof out of his eyes, but
if Lola saw it there she gave no sign of it, but seated
herself on a broad couch and motioned to him airily to
seat himself beside her.

âNow, Dr. Crossett,â she began, âI want to talk
with you before you see father. He is the dearest man
in the world, but he knows nothing at all about business.
He wrote to you?â

âYes, that is why I am here.â

âIt is about money; he is very poor.â

âPoor?â Dr. Crossett glanced about the expensively
furnished room in surprise, but Lola continued

Â
without seeming to notice. âHe did not want to write,
but I made him. You are his friend. You love him.
I am sure that you will be glad to help him.â

âWhat I have is his,â answered Dr. Crossett.
âSurely there is no need to repeat that. If he wanted
more, why did he not ask for it when I gave him my
check before I left New York?â

âOh, that money he borrowed from you he was going
to use for his experiments; to perfect his machines,
and to prepare to demonstrate them, but naturally
I could not allow him to do that. If heâs to be
a famous man he must, at least, live like a gentleman.
I selected this apartment, and insisted upon his moving,
and now he is so worried, and nervous, and cross,
just because he has no more money.â

âHe is my friend,â said the Doctor gravely. âI
will gladly supply all he needs, butâââ

âButââ!â repeated Lola impatiently, and to him
for a moment it sounded almost rudely. âSurely you
are not going to say that I have been extravagant.
Father has hinted it, so has John, and it wouldnât be
fair for you to join them against me. You wonât do
that, will you?â

LOLA SHOCKS HER FATHER AND HIS FRIEND BY HER HEARTLESSNESS.

Â
As she looked up at him shyly, yet confidently, it
seemed to him that the last twenty years had been a
dream, and that he was sitting beside that other young
woman, so like her, and any trace of disappointment
he had felt at her attitude fell away, and there was
nothing but tenderness in his voice as he replied:

âIt was more years ago than I can count that your
mother came to me and looked up as you are looking
now, and begged me not to side against her. She
wanted to marry your father; and all were saying âno.â
I could not refuse her anything any more than I could
you, although it hurt me to help bring about that marriage,
for I loved her myself. So you see how helpless
I am. I must fight your battles. I have no
choice.â

âYouâre a dear,â laughed Lola happily, âand if I
had been motherâbut thereâI must not make you
vain. I was sure that I could depend upon you. Now,
letâs not talk about serious things any more. Come!
Let me show you the view of the river from the
windows. Isnât it glorious here! Why, do you know,
Doctor dear, that after Eighth Avenue this is like another
world? Look!â She had dragged him to the

Â
window and with one hand on his shoulder, and her
pretty, eager face flushed with an almost passionate
enthusiasm, she stood pointing out to where the Drive
curved majestically, flanked on one side by its stately
buildings, on the other by the always beautiful Hudson
and the distant Palisades.

âLook!â she repeated. âI was content once in that
shabby, horrid flat. Perfectly content, and patient,
and happy. Father said that I was content because I
was good, but I know better; it was because I was ignorant;
because the thing that was mine was the only
thing I knew. He talks of going back! Threatens,
because he is afraid, because he never spent money in
his life, and is too old to learn now, to return to that
squalid, shabby, dirty hole. I want you to talk to
him,â and she turned him so that he faced her, and as
he felt the nervous grasp on his arm he marvelled at
her strength. âI want you to tell him what I have
already told him, that, if he goes back there, he will
go alone. I am out of it now, and there isnât power
enough in the world to drag me back.â

âMy dear,â remonstrated the Doctor gravely, âyou
and John are to be married; he is young; surely while

Â
he is making his way in the world you will be willing
to share whatever his fortune may be. Love is as
sweet in poverty, Lola, as it is in a home like this.â

âThat is a platitude, Doctor, a platitude invented by
cowards who werenât strong enough to win the good
things of life, and who, because they couldnât have
them, were fools enough to try to blind themselves
with stupid words. I am a woman! A womanâs only
chance for all the beautiful things of life rests upon
some man. When a man comes to me and says, âI
want the only things you have, your youth, your love,
your beauty,â havenât I the right to say, âWhat will you
give me for them?ââ

The Doctor drew back, deeply shocked. Her words,
the deep earnestness of her voice, and the hard, selfish
look in her eyes, surprised and hurt him. He was a
sentimentalist and to him a womanâs whole existence
should be in her love, and in the home her lover could
provide for her. Modern as he was in his practice
of medicine, advanced as he was in his psychological
studies, at heart he was an old-fashioned man, with all
of the old-fashioned manâs ideas of love and marriage.

Â
For a moment he felt a feeling of repulsion, almost
of horror, and he looked coldly at this young girl,
who seemed to be so greatly changed by a few short
weeks of luxury, but as he looked he thought of the
day, only so lately passed, when she had been brought
to them, white and lifeless, and as he saw her now,
defiant, rebellious, in all the vigor of her splendid
health, he smiled at her tenderly. He knew, as few
men know, the changes that some great nervous shock
so often makes in a personâs character, and he resolved
to devote himself to this girl until her nervous system
fully recovered, to help her with gentle kindness until
her old tranquil serenity was fully restored. It came
into his mind that of all the many cases of hysteria
which he had successfully treated here was one that
would challenge his greatest skill, and he was glad of
the fortune that had sent him to her, for his experienced
eyes saw that she was to need his help, and in
the confidence of a man to whom failure seldom came
he felt secure in his ability to restore her to her old
gentle self. He sat down beside her and talked quietly
of her father and of the fame and fortune that was

Â
so sure to be his, and as he talked he watched her and
saw just a young, happy, innocent girl, serene now,
perfectly gentle, perfectly calm, and they laughed and
talked merrily together until her father entered the
room.

Â

CHAPTER V

A LOVER'S QUARREL

Dr. Crossett
looked at his friend anxiously
and found, as he was prepared to find, that
the Doctor seemed nervous and depressed,
but when, after a few moments, Lola left them together,
he was hardly prepared for the look of shame
and humiliation he saw on his face.

âYou sent for me, Martin,â he said, trying to show
in his voice the deep sympathy and friendship that he
really felt.

âPaul,â the Doctor answered, after a momentâs hesitation,
âthe money I borrowed from you is gone!
Gone! and not for the purpose for which you loaned
it.â

âI made no condition, Martin. The loan was my
own suggestion. I am not a poor man, and all that I
have is at your service. It is not worth the tragedy
in your face. With the fame that your discovery will
bring to you, you can easily repay me. Come!â He

Â
put his arm affectionately over Dr. Barnhelmâs shoulder.
âLetâs say no more about it. Just tell me of
your work. It must be only a few days now before
you demonstrate before the Medical Society.â

âTo-morrow night,â replied the Doctor. âI have
remedied the flaws in the construction of my apparatus,
and Saturday Karn & Co. promised to deliver
the new machine. They sent me a bill for eight
hundred dollars. Iââhe stopped, his face flushed
with shame; then recovered himself with an effortââI
was unable to pay the amount, and theyâthey refused
to give me credit.â

âBut, Martin,â Dr. Crossett spoke gravely, âyour
lifeâs work was depending upon the delivery of your
apparatus in time for demonstration to-morrow.
Surely you should have set aside that sum, no matter
what else you sacrificed.â

âI was selfish enough,â replied the Doctor, âto want
my mind freed of every care. I allowed Lola to persuade
me to place all of the loan in her hands. She
knew that this bill was coming. Saturday IâI asked
her for the money, andâand she told me that it was
gone.â

Â
âShe had spent it?â

âYes.â

âHow?â

The Doctor pointed, with a smile that almost
brought the tears to his friendâs eyes, to the expensive
furniture and rather elaborate window hangings.

âIâI blame myself,â he said quickly, as if to prevent
any critical mention of his daughter. âShe is
young, and she doesnât understand. I had grown used
to trusting her with everything. Why, Paul! In
these past years there have been times when I could
not collect enough to pay our rent, little as it was.
Not once did I even have to tell her of it. She always
seemed to guess it for herself, and she would bring
me what I needed, saved from her pitiful little housekeeping
allowance, or earned by her teaching. All this
selfish greed of pleasure and luxury is new to her. I
do not like it. It is not like my girl!â

âOur fault,â agreed Dr. Crossett. âWe spoke too
much of the great success that was coming to you. It
turned her head. Come, let us forget it.â

âNot yet, Paul; I want you to understand. I could
not speak of her, as I am speaking now, to anyone but

Â
you. When she first insisted upon taking this apartment
I knew that I did wrong not to forbid it, but she
was in a peculiar nervous conditionâshe seemed morbid
and unlike herself. I hardly dared to oppose her.â

âAnd the change?â inquired Dr. Crossett. âHas it
done her good?â

âI hardly know,â the father answered, anxiously.
âHer health seems to be satisfactory. In fact, she
never, even as a child, seemed to be in such perfect
physical condition, and yetâââ

He stopped, seemingly unable to finish.

âIt is the emotion,â exclaimed Dr. Crossett, âthe
love. Young girls before marriage often have serious
nervous disorders. We must be patient. There is no
need to worry. Marriage will restore her old poise.
I speak with authority, Martin, for my practice has
shown me much of the delicate nature of these nervous
disorders; there is nothing here that need alarm you.
Come! Tell me. When is this marriage to take
place?â

âI cannot tell. It was to have been very soon after
her recovery, but she has already postponed it twice.
Young Dorris is almost out of patience.â

Â
âAlmost out of patience!â repeated Dr. Crossett
scornfully. âA bad mood in which to begin a lifelong
companionship with even the best of women. Come.â
He put his hand almost playfully on the Doctorâs
shoulder and shook him gently. âFacts! Always stick
to the facts. We know her. She is a good girl. We
love her. There is no more to say.â

âIf it is money she wants,â exclaimed Dr. Barnhelm
bitterly, âI will make it for her. It isnât that I
think anything money can buy too good for her, but
for her to be selfish.â

âHush,â said Paul very tenderly. âShe has no
mother; we must remember that. We are men, and
we stand helpless before her womanhood, like children
in the dark. Now! We will say no more. We will
go to the bank to-day, while there is time. We will
get that money, and to-morrow night, before the Medical
Society, you shall make your name big, famous.
Eh?â

âIf I do,â exclaimed Dr. Barnhelm gratefully, âI
shall have you to thank for it.â

âShe shall thank me, Martin. You will tell her that
part of the silks, and ribbons, and laces that you buy

Â
for her come from me. Eh? She will love me then.
Come.â

Dr. Crossett allowed Dr. Barnhelm no time for
remonstrance, but insisted so firmly that they should
go at once to the bank that he was obliged to agree,
and leaving a message for Lola that they would soon
return, they descended in the elevator and walked
briskly down the Drive, the Frenchman declaring that
it was nothing short of a crime to ride on such a day,
and he kept up such a flood of cheerful talk and happy
reminiscence that, in spite of his deep humiliation, Dr.
Barnhelm soon found himself laughing merrily.

In the meantime things were not going smoothly in
Lolaâs sitting room in the apartment. John Dorris
had for some hour or more been doing his best to win
Lola into a promise of an early marriage, and in spite
of his best resolution he found himself rapidly growing
impatient.

âIt is no use, John!â Lola spoke almost angrily.

âThe more we talk of it, the less we seem to agree.
I do not care to be married before winter.â

âThis is the third time you have changed the date,â

Â
remonstrated John. âI am beginning to think
thatâââ

âWell?â She interrupted sharply and with so much
of challenge in her manner that John had to curb his
rising indignation as he replied.

âIf I am not careful we will quarrel again, and we
have done more than enough of that lately.â

âI am sure I canât help it, John, if you choose to be
cross and unreasonable.â

âHas it all been my fault?â

âNo, of course not,â cried Lola, with one of the
sudden changes of mood that had so often puzzled
him of late. âI have been perfectly horrid, I know,
and I wonât be any more. Just forgive me, Johnâandâandââshe
looked up at him sweetlyââand kiss
me, if you want to.â

John stooped and kissed her, and asked earnestly,
âAnd we shanât postpone the wedding again, shall
we?â

âOnly a little while, dear.â

He turned angrily away, but she caught his arm.

âNow, John! Canât you trust me? Donât you love

Â
me enough to give me my way in a little thing like
this?â

As he stood rather coldly beside her, she suddenly
threw both her arms about his neck and clung to him.
Much as he loved her there was something in the utter
abandon of her manner that shocked him, and for a
moment he tried to draw away, but her delicate-looking
arms were strong, and she clung all the tighter,
laughing at his half-hearted effort to escape.

âAm I so dreadfully ugly, John, that you canât bear
to have me near you?â

âLola!â he exclaimed passionately, âwhat are you
doing? What is it that has changed you so? If you
love me what reason have you for putting me off with
one foolish excuse after another? What is it that you
want?â

âI know that I ask a great deal, dear,â she replied
tenderly, âbut I want a love great enough for anything.â

âMy love is great enough, Lola,â said John, as he
once more tried gently to remove her arms from about
his neck. âPlease donât try to make it any greater
until you are ready to return it.â

Â
She looked up again into his face and laughed at
the cold expression she saw there, then suddenly drew
him close, her arms straining about him, and kissed
him, not as a young girl timidly kisses the man she
loves, but with the kiss of a passionate woman. He
was a man, like other men, and the man in him took
fire in a moment, and he returned her kiss and would
have drawn her still closer into his arms, but with a
little low laugh she freed herself, and stepping back
of the table shook her finger at him playfully.

âNow, John! You mustnât be silly.â

She laughed lightly, mockingly, as he stood there,
already ashamed of the sudden fierce feeling that had
mastered him, and full of disgust of himself for the
physical passion that had for the first time entered into
any of his thoughts toward her.

âIt is all right, John,â she continued, feeling that
she had him at a disadvantage. âIt is all settled. The
marriage is postponed, but only for a little, little while.
Now run along, and come back late this afternoon to
see Dr. Crossett, and if you will promise to be very
good you may stay to dinner.â

âI will, Lola, thank you,â replied John, âbutâbut I

Â
wish you would tell me what you are going to do this
afternoon?â

âWhy, I am going out.â

âNotâLola! You are not going to that Harlan
womanâs house?â

âWhy, John! You know that you told me you
didnât like to have me go there?â She looked at him
so innocently that he felt himself a brute to continue,
but he forced himself to go on.

âThe woman is hardly respectable, and the crowd
she has hanging around her house are not proper acquaintances
for a girl like you. I havenât got over the
shock of seeing you in that womanâs carriage yesterday.â

âNow, please,â cried Lola impatiently, âplease donât
begin that all over again. You have been scolding
about that all the afternoon.â

âBut, if you have known this woman for months,
why is it that you have never spoken of her? Would
you have spoken of her at all if you had not known
that I saw you with her?â

âIf she is such a terrible person, how is it that you
know her so well?â

Â
âLola! I am a man. Men are different! Surely
you must see that?â

âWhy are they different? I am not a child. I am
a woman! Why shouldnât I have a little fun once in
a while? Why should men have everything?â

âDo you call it fun to live the life that woman lives?
You donât know what she is; if you did you would
rather stay shut up in this room as long as you were
alive than call yourself a friend of hers.â

âJohn! You are absurd.â

âNo! I am not absurd. A girl like you, Lola,
doesnât even know what such women as that Mrs.
Harlan are. It is your very innocence, dear, that
makes you so bold.â

âIâm tired of being a fool.â She spoke with a fierce
impatience that frightened him. âShe is a woman,
isnât she, made of the same flesh and blood, living in
the same world. Why should I avoid her? She is the
only person I know who cares for anything but work,
and worry, and duty! Life isnât all drudgery to her;
she loves laughter, and happiness, and gayety, and
good clothes, and beautiful surroundings! If that is
a sin, then I am a sinner, too, and Iâm glad of it.â

Â
âYou donât understand, Lola.â

âI want to understand! I must understand! I cannot,
will not, go on any longer like an ostrich, my head
hidden, pretending not to see the things that are all
around me. If you love me you will help me, you will
stop this absurd pretence. You will help me to know
what this world I live in really is. I am warning you,
John, just this once. If you do not listen to what I
am saying it will be your own fault; I wonât speak like
this again.â

âMy dear,â said John in much distress, âI want to
help you. Surely you know that. I am going to be
your husband, and all our lives I am going to stand
between you and everything that is evil. I am going
to do all that a man can do to protect you from all the
sorrow, and suffering, and sin of the world.â

Lola looked at him, as he stood before her, gravely,
his fine young face flushed with embarrassment and
earnest with his strong intention to do his best to make
her life all innocent happiness. She looked at him,
and laughed, laughed so heartily, and with such real
merriment, that after a momentâs indignation he was
reassured. âSurely,â he thought, âeverything is all

Â
right now; she is laughing at me because I took her innocent
girlish talk too seriously,â and he resolved in
future to avoid such discussions; but because he was
worried at his discovery of her acquaintance with this
really objectionable woman he felt that he must not
stop until he had secured an earnest promise that she
would avoid her as much as possible, so he continued.
âLola, Mrs. Harlanâs greatest friend, the man who has
helped to give her a reputation that a decent woman
can hardly envy, is Dick Fenway.â

She interrupted him angrily. âSo! That is the
explanation? Now, we are getting the real truth.
That is why I am to stay shut up here. That is why I
am not to go to my friendâs house.â

âHave you seen Dick Fenway there?â He was
angry now himself, hurt by her tone, and jealous of
the thought of this man, whom he knew to be unworthy
of any decent girlâs acquaintance. âHave you
seen him there?â he repeated as he turned away scornfully.

âAre you trying to insult me?â she demanded.

âI want an answer.â

âNo, I havenât seen him there.â

Â
âHave you seen him at all since the day he did his
best to kill you?â

âNo,â she replied coldly. âI have not, and now, if
you think that you have hurt me enough, you may go,
or are you anxious to accuse me of anything more?â

âLola,â John began gravely, âI am sorry, but you
have not been frank with me. I had a right to ask
you that question. I am glad that you could answer it
as you did.â

âI hope, John,â she replied, âthat before our marriage
does take place you will have learned to trust
me.â

âLola,â he cried, remorseful, âI do trust you.â

âNo, John.â She avoided him as he tried to put his
arm about her. âPlease go now. I am not angry, but
you have hurt me. I think that you had better go.
By to-night we will have forgotten it, or at least we
will try to forget.â

âI must be a beast of a fellow,â he said, quite convinced
of his own unreasonable temper. âI am always
hurting you, and yet I never mean to do it. Forgive
me, Lola. I will try to do better after this.â

He tried to kiss her, but she drew herself away, and

Â
he had to leave her, although his heart ached and he
felt that between them each day that passed was
bringing a more complete misunderstanding. He had
done his best; once away from the witchery of her
presence he was sure of that, but the old confidence,
the sweetness of perfect understanding had already
gone. His nature was a generous one, and he tried
to convince himself that the fault must be his, but
how? In what had he failed? He could not answer,
but once more he made up his mind to be patient and
tender. He knew little of women, but if their natures
were more complex, their moods more uncertain, he
could only do his best to try to understand. Of one
thing alone he was sure, as sure as he was of his own
life, her perfect loyalty, her real purity, and, after all,
was not that enough? What right had he to ask for
more?

As the door of the apartment closed behind him,
Lola, without a momentâs hesitation crossed the hall
to the telephone, and with a glance over her shoulder,
to be sure that she was alone, she took down the receiver
and called â2164 Rector.â After a moment she

Â
was answered, and she asked quietly, âIs Mr. Fenway
there? Yes, Mr. Richard Fenway.â

MRS. HARLAN IS A STATELY CHAPERON FOR LOLA.

She stood there smiling to herself until she heard his
voice at the other end of the wire. âHello,â she said
gayly. âThis is Lola. I have changed my mind, Dick,
about that ride. I am very much bored to-day, and I
have decided to go with you, if you are sure you really
want me.â

âYou know how much I want you,â he answered
ardently. âOr, if you donât know, Iâll tell you. I am
all alone here just now, and Iâll never have a better
chance.â

âI wouldnât trouble myself if I were you,â continued
Lola, âand perhaps you may have fully as good a
chance this afternoon; anyway, I am perfectly sure
that Central is laughing at you, and I donât at all blame
her.â

âAll right,â he answered. âIâll call for you in an
hour.â

âOh, no,â she retorted. âYou know you must not
come here. John and father would have a fit. Meet
me at Mrs. Harlanâs at three, just three oâclock exactly,
for I will have to be back by seven.â

Â
He started to tell her how delightful he was at the
prospect of her company, but as he spoke the door bell
rang and she cut him off without warning and turned
away as Maria opened the door from her kitchen and
started down the hall.

Â

CHAPTER VI

IN THE SWIM

Mrs. Harlan
called herself a widow, and if
the definition of a widow is âa woman who
has lost her husband,â she held good claim
to that title. Just how this loss occurred was, however,
a matter that was shrouded in mystery. No one
of her large and rather gay circle of intimate friends
either knew or greatly troubled themselves about the
matter. She had been known to speak of âMr. Harlanâ
and of âmy husband,â but it was quite impossible
to gather from her manner whether she mourned his
loss or gloried in her freedom.

There are in New York many circles of what is politely
called society, and entrance to these circles is
more or less easy of access, depending upon just which
one of these charmed rings one wishes to enter. Mrs.
Harlanâs âsetâ was one of those to which entrance
depended solely upon possession of a decent wardrobe
and the desire to have what is rather vaguely called âa

Â
good time!â âA good timeâ is very like âa good dinner,â
in that oneâs appreciation of it depends largely
upon personal taste; âwhat is one manâs meat may be
anotherâs poison,â and what to some is âa good time,â
to others would hardly be dignified by that title.

Mrs. Harlan and her friends, however, were perfectly
satisfied with existence, and rushed from theatre
to restaurant, and from road house to friendly little
games of chance in one anotherâs apartments with an
energy that never seemed to tire.

Without this class Heaven alone knows what would
become of the theatre, the gay restaurants, the taxicab
owners, and even the automobile manufacturers.
They, at least, make work for others, however little
real work they do themselves, although even among
these persons were a few men who fought hard all day
for the money that kept their endless chain of gayety
running through the better part of the night.

The man who has learned the difference between
gayety and happiness has solved one of the greatest
secrets of life; such men are rare; at least they were
not numbered among Mrs. Harlanâs friends.

The lady herself was a handsome woman of rather

Â
generous proportions, her age, like her husbandâs exact
fate, being one of the very few subjects on which
she preserved a discreet silence. She was by no means
a bad woman, according to her lights, but her lights
burned dim at times, and she had that smoldering
hatred of the orthodox members of respectability that
is never absent from the heart of a clever woman who
knows that she has forever put herself beyond its pale.

Dick Fenway, very soon after his arrival in New
York, became one of the inner circle of Mrs. Harlanâs
intimates, both by virtue of his natural gayety and the
fact that he was what is known as a good spender,
meaning a person who, no matter how great his expenditure
may be, is never by any possible chance
known to do the slightest good with his money.

At first gossip was inclined to connect his name with
that of the fair widow, but if, for a time, there had
been anything but friendship between them, it soon
burned itself out. Whatever her age, she was at least
old enough to have been his mother, and, reckless as
he was, he had far too much natural shrewdness to
allow himself to become so completely entangled that
escape would be impossible.

Â
He made no secret of the fact that he had been unhappily
married; in fact he took pains that the ladies
of this particular circle should know of it, an unhappy
marriage being not only a sure passport to their sympathy,
but acting as a sort of insurance against any
too ambitious hopes that his friendly attentions might
arouse.

From the day, now some months ago, when he met
Lola Barnhelm, until some time after her accident, he
had dropped out of the sight of his friends, and upon
his return he offered no explanation for his absence,
other than that he had been having a stupid time and
was anxious to make up for it.

Lola had been the first well-bred girl he had ever
known, and all that was good in his nature had been
stirred by the first meeting with her. Her reproaches
for his deceit about his wife had really hurt him, and
the shock he had experienced when he believed himself
to have been the cause of her death had been the one
terrible experience of his shallow life. He had been
taken to the police station, and while waiting for his
lawyer to arrange for his release on bail had been informed

Â
that the girl was not seriously hurt and that
there was no charge against him.

His relief from his feeling of horror and remorse
was naturally great, but he made up his mind that it
was quite hopeless to expect Lolaâs forgiveness, and
when he met her one day on Broadway, shortly after
her recovery, he was about to pass her without any
other greeting than a bow, when to his great surprise
she stopped him and, without any reference either to
the accident or to his deceit about his marriage, chatted
with him so gayly and so pleasantly that he took heart
and invited her to drop into a restaurant with him for
a cup of tea.

From her manner, as she entered the great room
filled with laughing, chattering, well-dressed men and
women, he could hardly be blamed for not knowing
that this was the first time in all her life that she had
ever been in such a place.

Neither her father nor John Dorris were rich men;
they knew nothing of the life that is reflected in
such place; to John a few visits with her, to the
theatre, long walks in the Park, or quiet evenings in
the apartment won the natural development of their

Â
intimacy, and Dr. Barnhelm knew as little as he cared,
which was not at all, about the sham glitter and forced
gayety of the great eating places that have done so
much to destroy the home life of the average New
Yorker.

In these surroundings, in an atmosphere of false
luxury, of noise, heat, and confusion, against a background
of painted women and flushed and loud-voiced
men, the real reverence he had always had for her
began rapidly to disappear, and he found himself looking
upon her simply as a charming and beautiful young
girl, who, as a matter of course, was to be pursued as
diligently and as relentlessly as circumstances would
allow. After all, the respect the world has for us is
usually the measure of our own respect for ourselves,
and as Lola made no effort to rebuke his rather daring
advances, they naturally increased in freedom until
in all the great room there was no gayer table than
theirs.

Many heads were turned toward them, many questions
were asked about who this new beauty could be.
Fenway seemed to be known to almost everyone, and
several times men came up to the table and spoke to

Â
him, but if they had hoped to be introduced to his companion
they were disappointed, and they went away
muttering angrily.

Lola would drink nothing but tea; in fact she needed
nothing stronger; the intoxication of the scenes is as
complete sometimes as the intoxication of strong
drink, and to this girl, seeing for the first time a
glimpse of the thing that to her seemed life, came the
birth of a desire that never again left her, the desire to
know everything, to experience everything, to live as
those persons about her seemed to be living, without
thought of anything but the pleasure of the moment,
and had she known the price that all who live that life
must surely pay, she would still have gone on.

This was the first of several meetings, sometimes
alone, sometimes in the company of Mrs. Harlan, to
whom he later introduced her. She had frankly told
him that first day that her father would never consent
to allow him to come to their home, and he had been
well content to meet her in places where less restraint
was necessary.

To his great surprise, however, he found Lola much
better able to protect herself than he had expected.

Â
She was what Mrs. Harlan described, after the first
time she met her, as âa mighty smooth proposition,â
and although he knew himself by this time to be madly
in love with her, he could not flatter himself with the
hope that she was in the very least inclined to allow
him to make a fool of her. Mrs. Harlan in fact did
not hesitate to inform him that he was the one who
was playing the fool. She rather coarsely described
the affair as âa ten to one shot against him.â

âWhy donât you hurry up that divorce and marry
the girl?â she demanded of him on the afternoon on
which Lola had made the appointment to meet him.
âYou are crazy about her, and itâs the only way sheâll
ever listen to you. If you donât look out sheâll marry
that young bank clerk and leave you flat.â

âI doubt it,â replied Dick, sulkily. âJohn Dorris is
one of those nice boys, like you read about, and the
way Lola is coming on lately he wouldnât have speed
enough to keep up with her. She may marry him, I
donât say she wonât, but if she does God help him.â

âThatâs all right, too,â replied his friend, âbut sheâs
too smart to make a fool of herself over a married
man like you. Sheâll let you run her around in your

Â
car and buy her a few nice little presents, but just as
you think sheâs going to fall into your arms, sheâs going
to step back and give you the laugh. I may be a
fool, but thatâs the way it looks to me.â

It was about the way it looked to him also, but he
did not think it necessary to inform her of the fact,
so to change the subject, and to kill time until the three
oâclock appointment, he proposed lunching at Rectorâs,
and she agreeing, they drove there in his car, and he,
contrary to his usual custom, drank far more than
was good for him.

Lola herself found time hanging heavily on her
hands, and wandered aimlessly about the apartment
waiting for her father and Dr. Crossett to return.
Maria came to her at last, holding in her hand several
letters, all but one of which she placed upon the table.

âIs that one for father?â said Lola, seeing her about
to leave the room with one letter in her hand.

âNo, Miss. Itâs for me.â She hesitated for a moment,
then went on shyly. âItâs from Mr. Barnes!â

âOh,â remarked Lola curiously, âI thought he had
stopped writing to you.â

âNo, Miss.â

Â
âCan you read them yourself now?â

âI try to,â replied Maria; âI manage to spell âem out
somehow.â

âWhy donât you ask me to read them for you?â

Maria did not reply for a moment, and turned once,
as if to leave the room, but at last she seemed to make
up her mind, and crossing to the couch on which Lola
had languidly thrown herself, she said quietly, âI
couldnât ask you while you were sick, and once, after
we moved over here, IâI did, and you said you didnât
want to be bothered. After that, some way IâI
couldnât seem to bring myself to ask again. You see,
Iâm growing awful fond of Mr. Barnes, andâand I
guess Iâm sort of sensitive about him.â

The poor girl said nothing of the hours she had
studied, hopelessly confused, to spell out the crude
little letters from the lover who meant so much to
her, nor of the real delicacy that prevented her from
asking anyone but the mistress she loved so deeply to
read what he had written. To her Lola could do no
wrong, and no man could hold any place in her heart
that she would for a moment try to conceal from this

Â
girl who had brought the first glimpse of sunshine into
her life.

âGive me your letter,â said Lola indolently. âI
canât remember being cross about it. Really I donât
mind at all. I am rather interested.â

She took the letter that Maria eagerly passed to her,
and opening it read slowly, for Mr. Barnes was a better
sailor than scholar.

ââAugust 18. Newport, R. I. Respected friendââââ
She looked up, laughing. âI see that he is
still properly respectful.â

âYes, Miss,â replied Maria, simply. âHe loves
me!â

Lola looked at her for a moment, then smiled rather
bitterly, and continued:

ââI take my pen in hand to let you know that I got a
bad fall in the gun turret and broke my left legââââ

Mariaâs little cry of fear and sorrow was drowned
in Lolaâs joyous, hearty laughter. Maria looked at
her, anger and reproach struggling with her love and
respect, and Lola seeing her face, smothered her mirth.

âReally I am sorry,â and she started to continue,
ââbroke my left leg, and I havenât been able to write

Â
with it before.â Thatâs what I was laughing at, Maria;
it does sound funny, doesnât it?â

âGive me that letter.â For the first time in her life
Maria spoke to her rudely, no longer the servant, but
the offended woman. âGive it to me.â

âReally, I beg your pardon, Maria, but it is too
absurd. Wait! I will read you the rest of it.â

Maria stepped forward and took the letter out of
her hand.

âIf you please, Miss,â she said quietly, âI would
rather spell it out myself. You see he didnât write
that thinking that anybody was going to laugh at it.
He wrote it for an ignorant girl that loves him. I
canât read good, but I can understand, and I guess
thatâs all he wants.â

Â

CHAPTER VII

DANCE HALL GLITTER

â218 Murray Hill,â
Lola repeated impatiently
into the telephone. âI have been waiting
quite five minutes. Hello! Hello! Madam
Zelya, please! This is Miss Barnhelm! Hello! Is
that you, Madam? Yes, yes, I have just received your
note, and I do not think you are quite fair in the matter.
Yes, I know that I did promise, but it is quite
impossible. What! My father has nothing to do
with this matter, absolutely nothing. If you will be
patient for two or three days longer the account will
be settled. What is that?â¦ Oh! I am sorry that
you choose to take that tone. If you call upon my
father you will get nothing, either from my father or
from me. I will promise to send a check in a day or
two; until then please do not annoy me.â

With this Lola hung up the receiver, leaving a very
angry Hungarian dress-maker to get what satisfaction
she might from shrill threats and dire prophecies,

Â
and turned away from the telephone in time to meet
her father and Dr. Crossett as they entered from the
outside hall.

âWho has been annoying you, little girl?â inquired
her father, who had heard the end of the conversation.

âOnly that stupid hall-boy,â answered Lola calmly.
âHe is always making mistakes. What a time you
two have been, to be sure. I thought that you had deserted
me for good.â

âNo chance of that, my dear,â said Dr. Crossett.
âIn fact it was to be sure of having a long talk with
you that I hurried your father back.â

âI am afraid we must postpone that talk for a little
while, Doctor. I am going to my room for a few moments.
You will excuse me, wonât you?â She smiled
sweetly at him and held out her hand, and he bowed
over it gallantly as he answered:

âCome back soon. I shall be waiting.â

âOh, I promise you that you shall see quite enough
of me, Doctor,â she replied; âbefore you are here a
day you will be glad to get me out of your sight. I
know I am going to bore you dreadfully, but I have

Â
so many things I want to talk over with you, and so
many questions I want to ask you, about things that
happened long ago before I was here to be a trouble to
you.â

She went gayly down the long hall, stopping at her
door to wave her hand at him as he stood watching
her.

âNo sign there of nervous troubles,â he said as he
joined her father in the sitting room. âHer eyes are
bright and clear, her voice is steady. She looks happy
and well. You, Martin, are the greatest inventor in
the worldâs history.â

âHardly that,â said the Doctor with a laugh.

âAh, yes,â insisted the Frenchman. âMen have
made fortunes, fame, history by the children of their
brain, but what man before, by the power of his mind,
has brought back from the dead his own daughter?â

âA curious study,â said Dr. Barnhelm thoughtfully
as he seated himself in a deep chair by the table and
motioned to his friend to sit opposite to him; âremarkably
curious, these things we call life, and death,
and body, and soul. It is a queer fact, Paul, that no

Â
matter how we strive our knowledge stops short at the
gates of death. What is beyond?â

âFor many years,â answered the Doctor, as he
lighted a cigarette and sank back in his chair with a
sigh of comfort, âthat troubled me, but as I grow
older I find myself thinking less of death and clinging
fast to life. Death! Bah! It does not frighten me.
It may be a vast nothingness, or it may be a step to a
higher existence. What does it matter? Our work is
here; we have our friends to love, our duty to be done;
that is life, and I like it.â

âThe body dies,â went on Dr. Barnhelm, âbut the
soul, can that ever die? I doubt it! Every man of us
who has a soul must doubt it.â

âEvery man of us,â said Paul. âAh! At least we,
all of us, have that in common, I suppose.â

âAll of us? Do you think so?â

âNaturally, to a greater or less degree. Your soul,
my friend, may be big and fine; mine may be mean
and small, but if in the human body there is such a
thing, surely we all of us must have it.â

âDo you know the theory of the âSixth Day Men,â
Paul?â

Â
ââThe Sixth Day Men,ââ repeated Paul, âno. It
has a most effective title, this theory of yours; tell me
of it.â

âIn the beginning, God created the Heaven and the
Earth; for six days he labored, and on the seventh
day he rested.â

âI heard rumors to that effect,â commented Dr.
Crossett lightly.

âDays in that time,â continued Dr. Barnhelm, not
noticing his friendâs interruption, âwere not of twenty-four
hours; they were Alous, cycles of time. During
those periods animal life came, evolution went on, bit
by bit, with thousands of years between each step of
its progress. A man-thing came into the world.â

âBefore the seventh day,â enquired Paul, with interest,
for he dearly loved any discussion of this sort,
and he knew that any theory considered worthy of
attention by his old friend must at least hold points
of interest.

âYes,â said Dr. Barnhelm. âBefore the seventh
day.â

âAh! This is interesting and new to me. Then our
old friend Adam was not the first man?â

Â
âListen, Paul! After the seventh day âGod
breathed the breath of life into Adamâs nostrils.â He,
therefore, was the first âman,â for he had a God-given
soul. In him was more of the divine than we can
claim, for we are told that he could âwalk with God.â
That was before the fall. Eveâs fall, in the Garden of
Eden, by this theory, was her guilty love for one of
these soulless, earth-born âmen things,â and of them
Cain was born. Born without a soul, and, as the Bible
tells us, âCain went away and found himself a wife.â
Where? Where else than from among these Sixth
Day people, soulless, all of them, and their descendants
could have brought into the world small trace of the
divine. Meanwhile sons of Adam were beginning to
people the earth, and later these two races mingled.
There began a struggle between good and evil in the
human heart, a struggle that has never ended. Sometimes
will be born a human being in whom occurs a
curious âthrow backâ of generations to these soulless
Sixth Day ancestors. Sometimes the good in us conquers
the evil, and sometimes the evil conquers, kills
the good, and the God-given soul leaves us and there
is nothing left but an animal, a âman thing,â a straight

Â
descendant of one of those Sixth Day horrors, whose
blood has contaminated us since the fall of Eve.â

âAh!â Dr. Crossett was bending forward now
eagerly. âYour theory has taken me by surprise; it
is new to me.â

âIt is not new to the world, or at least not altogether
new; some of the old German thinkers wrote of it.
Darwin considered it. Each of us is conscious at
times of sudden revolts against virtue, sudden reasonless
impulses for evil. It is the struggle of the divided
soul.â

âBut, Martin, if your theory is sound, one or the
other of these forces must conquer in the end, the good
or the evil.â

âEvil never conquers in the end, Paul. Or our
world would long ago have become chaos. When, in
future generations, the last trace of our Sixth Day
ancestors has been driven out, this theory holds that
the world will once again be as God meant it to be,
and we shall have the real brotherhood of Man.â He
paused.

âWhat have you to say? What do you think?â

Â
âI think,â replied Dr. Crossett, âthat I should like
a very large drink of your whiskey.â

âYou are right, Paul,â returned Dr. Barnhelm, rising.
âA cigar, a drink, and a game of chess, they are
a better prescription for a tired man than a new
philosophy.â

He rang the bell and asked Maria for whiskey and
a syphon, and as she went for it he took from a little
wooden box a shabby, worn old set of chessmen.

âA talk over old times will freshen my mind for
my ordeal to-morrow, for it is to be an ordeal, Paul.
My theory of restoring the muscular activity to the
heart after death has occurred is admitted to be practical,
in fact successful. Laboratory experiments upon
animals are within the experience of most of the big
men whom I am to face to-morrow. They are ready
to admit my theory, but they must be convinced
against their will of my ability to always restore life
under all conditions where death has resulted simply
from the failure of the heart to perform its functions
and where there has been no organic decay. They
laugh at my claim that I can succeed in performing
this experiment after as great a time as five hours

Â
from the moment of the last heart beat, and it seems
to be the general opinion that five minutes would be
a more conservative and a more exact statement.â

âIt is a very pleasant thing,â commented Paul.
âThis laughter of fools. In all ages it has been granted
to some lucky few, this great distinction, to be laughed
at and to be right. You are in good company, Martin.
The same sort of persons once laughed at Watts, at
Columbus, at Darwin, at Dr. Bell, and at Marconi.
Noah was, I believe, the first object of popular ridicule,
but that did not affect the value of the Ark when
the flood came. Come, we will forget all of this until
the time comes, and I will beat you at a game of chess.
Unless my memory plays me tricks, I won the last
game, all of twenty years ago, and I can do it again.â

Maria entered the room with a tray, on which were
a bottle of whiskey, carbonic water and glasses, and
put it down on the table as Dr. Barnhelm took out a
thick pocketbook from his inside pocket and said,
âFirst, I will put this money away until to-morrow.â

He crossed the room to a small safe that was set
into the wall and hidden from sight by a picture. âCan
you open this thing, Maria?â

Â
âI think so, sir,â replied Maria, going to the safe
at once and turning the combination. âMiss Lola
taught me how, if I can remember.â

After a momentâs effort the small door of the safe
opened, and she said, with evident relief, âThere!â

âGood!â exclaimed the Doctor, as he placed the
pocketbook in the safe and closed and locked it.

âThank you, Maria, and, Maria, ask Miss Lola to
come to us when she is ready.â

âYes, Doctor,â and Maria, after a glance to make
sure that all was right with her tray, left them alone
together.

âTo the old days, Paul,â said the Doctor, after filling
his own glass and his friendâs.

âNo,â replied Paul, âto now, to to-morrow. May
the future be as happy as that old past; and may your
daughter, if she lives, be as good a woman as her
mother; and if she dies, may she leave as sweet a
memory behind her.â

They drank in silence, and as they put their glasses
down Lola joined them. She had changed to what,
to the masculine eye, looked like a very elaborate

Â
street costume, and she stood there in the doorway
buttoning her gloves as she called out gayly:

âYou two look comfortable!â

âAh, yes,â replied Dr. Crossett. âAn old friend, a
good drink, a pretty woman, what more could be
asked? Ah, my dear.â He looked at her admiringly.
âHow chic, how fine we look.â

âA new dress, Lola?â inquired her father, looking
up from his chessmen absently.

âOh, dear, no,â said Lola, carelessly. âJust an old
rag.â

âA dainty rag,â commented Dr. Crossett.

âI am sure I never saw it before,â continued Dr.
Barnhelm, looking at her a little anxiously.

âItâs just a little thing I had made up. It cost
scarcely anything. I am glad if it looks even passable,â
remarked Lola.

âPassable!â responded Dr. Crossett. âTwenty
years ago it would never have passed me, not with its
present wearer. Do you know, Lola, what would be
the greatest joy that could come to me? To take you
to Paris, to show you to my friends, to see you there
in the city that of all the worldâs cities best knows

Â
how to value a beautiful woman. There is but one
word for you to-day, Lola. You are radiant.â

He spoke no more than the truth. She had always
been a beautiful girl, but since her recovery she
had gained the things she had always needed, color,
animation, and as she stood there now, laughing at
him, but thrilling at his praise, she made a picture that
few men could have looked at unmoved. The rich costume
set her off to great advantage and her contemptuous
description of it would not have deceived any
womanâs eye for a moment.

âAnd if you are not careful you will make me
frightfully conceited. Now you two be real good,
and donât drink too much of that whiskey before I
come back.â

âAre you going out?â asked her father as he made
the opening move of the game.

âYes, dear, I have a little appointment at three. It
really doesnât matter at all, but I thought that you two
would rather be alone.â

She bent over her fatherâs chair, and kissed him
tenderly, then turned daringly to Dr. Crossett, her
hand on his shoulder and, her face very near to his,

Â
she said teasingly, âIf you were just the very least
little bit older I should kiss you, too.â

âI am,â replied the Doctor promptly, âconsiderably
older than I look.â

âYou are not to be trusted,â she responded gayly.
âI am very sure of that! Good-bye, dears. I am going
now.â

As she turned away, a little hurriedly, for she saw
by the clock on the mantel that it was ten minutes of
three, John Dorris entered the room; at the sight of
him standing there between her and the door for just
a fraction of a second a queer, fierce look flashed
across her face, such a look as one might see in an
angry pantherâs eyes, but before John could see it, it
was gone, and she was smiling at him sweetly.

âHow early you are, John,â she exclaimed. âIt is
awfully sweet of you, but Iâm afraid it will be very
dull unless you are fond of chess.â

âYou are going out?â questioned John in what
seemed to Dr. Crossett as he rose to shake hands with
him rather a curt tone.

âYes,â replied Lola, âI am afraid I must.â

âMy dear boy, I am very glad to see you,â said Dr.

Â
Crossett to John, of whom he had really grown very
fond in those few days following Lolaâs accident.

âThank you, Doctor,â replied John heartily, as he
returned the pressure of the Doctorâs hand. âIt is
very kind of you to say so,â and he turned away, perhaps
a little hastily, and followed Lola up to the door.
âShall I go with you, Lola?â

âOh, dear, no,â replied Lola. âIt would bore you
dreadfully, and besides I really couldnât have you, even
if you care to come. I am in a great hurry. I promised
to be there at three. Sit down and watch the
game.â She took him by the arm and led him back
to the table. âFather will need your help, I am afraid.
See! He is in trouble already. Hereâââ She
stepped to a small table and returned with a box of
cigars. âWhy donât you men smoke? Really, you
must.â She held the box to each of them in turn,
smiling so compellingly that even John was forced to
take one, but in spite of her smile he thought he saw
in her face a trace of anxious impatience, and to him
at least her beautiful new dress was not wholly a pleasure.
Little as he knew of the real cost of such a costume,
he knew that it was far more expensive than

Â
Dr. Barnhelmâs purse could afford, and in some vague
manner it associated itself in his mind with Mrs. Harlan
and her friends.

âWould you mind telling me where you are going,
Lola?â he enquired anxiously.

âOh, dear, no; why should I?â she answered as she
struck a match and held it, first to her fatherâs, then
to Dr. Crossettâs cigar. âI am going to see poor little
Nellie Mooney. She isnât at all well, you know, father,
and I really havenât the heart to disappoint her.
There!â She placed the decanter and glasses on the
table near to him. âDo see that they are comfortable,
John. You may have just as fine a time as you want
to, you selfish male things,â she went on as she crossed
quickly to the door. âBut donât quite forget me while
I am gone.â

She left the room laughing, and as the outside door
closed behind her the little clock on the mantel struck
three.

The chess game went on deliberately, quietly, and
the young man sat there watching it, but at the same
time letting his thoughts wander, and suddenly he
found himself following in his mind Lolaâs progress.

Â
He pictured her walking down the Drive with the
brisk, swinging stride she had assumed of late; then
in his mind he saw her cross Seventy-second Street
and take a crowded car; in all the changes of her long,
complicated trip to the upper East Side he idly kept
pace with her, glancing from time to time at the clock,
until he seemed to see her running lightly up the dizzy
stairs of a shabby tenement house on a side street and
entering a tidy little room on the top floor. He saw
the room plainly in his mind, for he had often been
there with Lola before they had moved to this new
apartment. No, now that he came to think of it, not
since Lolaâs recovery, but before then they had gone
there together almost every day. He liked to think
of her there; on her errand of mercy she would stop
and buy flowers, he thought. Nellie loved flowers.
How her poor, tired little face used to brighten when
she would look up from the sofa where she lay all
day long and saw Lola coming into the room.

He closed his eyes, and leaning back in his chair
saw the picture in his mind. The poor little room, the
white-faced, suffering child, smiling happily now, with

Â
the flowers pressed against her face, and LolaâLola
bending over her, fresh, beautiful, gentle in her face
the look he had seen there once, that wonderful radiance
that is seen sometimes in a young girlâs face, the
foreshadowing of motherhood.

The blare of music, too near and too loud. The
confused babble of rattling dishes, discordant laughter,
high-pitched voices, and the clinking of glasses
that were filled again and again, but emptied as fast
as they were replenished. A great room, the air heavy
with many odors and foul with tobacco smoke.

Here at one table an old man, with jewels on his
fat fingers, with him a young girl, almost a child, a
girl in a shabby dress, with eyes bright with wonder
and with fear.

Here and there, in this brilliant throng, could be
picked out bold-eyed men, who laughed across the
tables at nervous, frightened women, women who
laughed back with terror in their hearts. Comedy,
farce, tragedy, aching hearts, and aching heads.
Empty lives and empty pocketbooks. Bluff and sham.

Â
Age and youth. Love and hate. Fear and lust. One
could feel them all, but one could only hear the ceaseless,
empty laughter rising above the music, above the
noise.

If to laugh is to be happy, here was happiness.

Â

CHAPTER VIII

LOLA TELLS FALSEHOODS

âI thought
I heard the elevator stop!â John exclaimed
nervously as he went to the door and
looked anxiously down the hall.

âShe knew we were to have dinner at seven,â Dr.
Barnhelm said as he stepped to the window and peered
out into the gathering darkness.

They had been waiting now for a long time, patiently
at first, but as the hours passed, and the lights
began to come out along the Drive and in the windows
of the apartment opposite, John and Barnhelm began
to show the anxiety they had at first attempted to conceal.
The chess game had ended long ago, and they
had sat together in the twilight talking, until Maria
had brought in the evening papers and switched on the
light. John, remembering the coldness Lola had shown
to him earlier in the day, was hurt and offended.
âSurely,â he thought, âshe should have forgiven me
before now, but she is staying away purposely to show
me that she is still angry.â

Â
Dr. Barnhelm was anxious because he felt a hostâs
responsibility and knew that Maria and Jane, the cook,
were depending upon Lola for final instructions about
the rather elaborate dinner he had demanded in honor
of his old friendâs arrival. Of the three Dr. Crossett
alone was calm and unruffled and rather inclined to be
amused by the othersâ obvious impatience.

âShe was detained, no doubt,â he remarked easily,
glancing up from his paper. âAre your subways never
blocked? Your cars never stalled? La! a thousand
things!â

âAlmost five hours,â exclaimed John impatiently.
âEven our subway can hardly be accused of that. I
think I had better go there, Doctor. I know where
Mrs. Mooney lives.â

âIt would take you at least an hour,â responded the
Doctor, âand if there had been anything unusually
wrong with Nellie, Lola would have telephoned.â

âWho is this Nellie Mooney?â inquired Dr. Crossett.

âA poor little girl,â explained Dr. Barnhelm, âthe
daughter of a hard-working Irish woman. The child
has suffered for years with a tubercular disease of the

Â
bone of her arm; before we moved I used to see her
almost every day, but I had not been able to do much
for her.â

âSo. She is young?â

âAbout twelve.â

âThese cases are, to me, most interesting. I have
had success in their treatment. If this child is dear to
you I will see her. I do not mean that I can do more
than you have done, but my treatment has often been
successful.â

âIt would make Lola very happy, Paul,â replied
Dr. Barnhelm. âShe met the child in the Park over a
year ago and brought her to me. Of all her protÃ©gÃ©es
Nellie has always been the one she seemed to care the
most about. I have been glad to see that she still
thinks of her.â

âAnd now,â said Dr. Crossett smilingly, âyou two
are both out of patience because Lola is doing the very
thing you wanted her to do.â

âI want her to be charitable,â broke in John. âIt
was her almost divine pity for this very child that
first showed me the sort of girl she was. But she has

Â
spent three whole afternoons there this week. Surely
that is overdoing it.â

âAh! The selfishness of the young,â remarked Dr.
Crossett, turning the pages of his paper and carelessly
looking over the headlines. âBecause she loves you,
she must love no one else? Is that it? Because she is
going to give her whole life to you, she must not take
any little minutes for herself?â

âOh, I know!â John spoke regretfully, uneasily
conscious of the jealousy that for some time had been
creeping into all his thoughts of her. âI am getting
to be a beast. I am sure I donât know why. I was
never jealous before or nervous, never in my life!
There must be something wrong with me.â

âThere is,â replied the Doctor in his best professional
manner. âWill you allow me,â and he took
Johnâs unresisting hand and put his finger to his pulse.
âYou are suffering from an ailment that requires the
most careful nursing. For most ailments we nurse
the patient, but this particular disease, commonly
called love, must itself be nursed or it will die!â

âYou are laughing at me, Doctor, and I donât at all
blame you,â said John as the Doctor dropped his hand

Â
and started to resume his reading of the paper. âI canât
think what can have detained Lola, but it is absurd of
me to be out of patience with her about it.â

âDoctor.â Maria stood in the doorway, and spoke
rather timidly. âJane says that you wonât have any
dinner at all unless you take it now.â

âAh!â exclaimed Dr. Crossett. âNow matters are
growing serious. I find, Martin, that our long walk has
given me an appetite.â

âI could keep something hot for Miss Lola,â suggested
Maria, who had come to the end of her powers
of persuasion with the indignant Jane, and knew that
unless dinner could be served at once there was a
strong probability of her having to serve it alone, without
the help of this haughty stranger who had been
engaged by Lola soon after they had given up their
old simple manner of living. âIt was such a nice dinner,
Doctor, but there wonât be anything fit to eat left;
itâs been ready over an hour.â

âYou are right, Maria, I think,â said Dr. Barnhelm;
âperhaps it wouldâââ As he spoke the bell rang.

âThere she is now!â exclaimed Maria joyfully.
âShe never remembers to take her key.â

Â
She left the room hurriedly and went down the hall
to the door as John sighed with relief and even Dr.
Crossett beamed gratefully as he rose from his chair.

âYou see! You two gloomy ones! Everything is
all right. At least she has left her little Nellie, and at
last we dine.â

As he spoke Maria reÃ«ntered the room looking
startled, perhaps a little frightened.

âMrs. Mooney, Doctor,â she announced. âMrs.
Mooney and Nellie!â

Mrs. Mooney and Nellie had followed Maria, and
as she saw the three gentlemen, all of them now thoroughly
alarmed, Mrs. Mooney hesitated, and put her
arm about Nellie, who drew closer to her, awed by the
magnificence of the brilliantly lighted room, and
vaguely troubled by the unspoken question in the faces
turned to her.

âMiss Lola?â inquired Dr. Barnhelm quietly.

âI made bold to come, sir,â she answered, âbecause
the childâs arm is that bad she canât seem to stand it.â

âWhere is my daughter?â

âYour daughter, Doctor? Miss Lola?â

âWhy did she not come with you?â

Â
âIâI donât understand you, sir.â

âShe was with you this afternoon.â

âNo, sir,â replied Mrs. Mooney in surprise. âI
havenât seen Miss Lola since you folks moved away
from Eighth Avenue.â

It was impossible to doubt the truth of the womanâs
statement, and as impossible to forget that day after
day Lola had left them with the intention of going to
her. John and Dr. Barnhelm had often asked her,
on her return, how Nellie was getting on, and Lola had
answered them, seemingly much grieved over the
childâs condition. Dr. Crossett felt some of their
amazement, and the three stood there, for a moment
unable to speak until another sharp ring at the bell
sent Maria hurrying to the door.

No one spokeâwhat was there to say? They stood
there waiting until they heard the door open, and
heard Lolaâs gay laugh as she brushed past Maria, calling
out to them cheerfully as she hurried down the
hall:

âHere I am at last. Did you think I was never
coming?â

There was something in their manner that made her

Â
hesitate as she stepped into the room and, glancing
about for an explanation, her eyes fell upon Mrs.
Mooney and Nellie. For a moment, as she turned on
Mrs. Mooney, a look of such fierce rage and hatred
flashed over her face, that the poor woman stepped
back in terror, throwing her arms about her child instinctively,
as though to shield her from danger.

What was it? Why did this girl who had done so
much for them, who had been the good angel of their
lives, look at them like that? Mrs. Mooney looked at
her in return, and as she looked she saw Lola smiling
sweetly, lovingly. No trace of anything on her calm,
happy face but tenderness and sympathy, and she was
bitterly ashamed of her folly, and humbly grateful as
Lola came and put her arms about Nellie in eager welcome.

âWhy, Nellie,â she exclaimed, âI am so glad to see
you!â

âYouâyou have not seen her before then?â inquired
her father gravely.

âOh, dear, no,â answered Lola lightly. âHasnât she
told you that?â

John stepped forward impatiently. There must be

Â
some good reason for her deceit of them. Surely she
should give it, and as Lola turned to speak to Dr.
Crossett, he stepped in front of her. âLola, why did
youâââ

âNow, John,â she interrupted him, âplease donât be
silly. I see that there is nothing for me to do but
confess. I had not meant to tell you until after dinner.
I have been very selfish. I have been riding, in an
automobile.â

âWith whom?â

âWith nobody dreadful, I assure you.â She turned
to her father, laughing at Johnâs frowning face.
âWith the wife of one of your old friends, Mrs. Dr.
Rupert.â

âYou see,â Dr. Crossett sighed with perfect relief.
âWhy make mountains out of nothing? Surely we
do not begrudge our girl a ride.â

âOf course you donât. I met her as I went out
of the house. I fully meant to call on you, Nellie dear,
but Mrs. Rupert wanted me very much, and besides,
I knew that she could help me.â

The others were smiling now, quite satisfied, but

Â
Johnâs face had not changed, and as he spoke to her,
his voice was hard, suspicious.

âMrs. Mooney says that you have never been to
her house. Not once of all the times you have left me
to go there.â

âIf you donât stop interrupting me, John, I will
never be able to finish my story. I was just trying to
tell you that I had been deceiving you. But now Mrs.
Rupert has promised to help me, so I donât mind telling
you all about it.â

She looked at them, her face slightly flushed, a little
embarrassed; but calm and earnest. To Dr. Crossett
she seemed like a child, about to confess some little
fault, a fault it knows to be already forgiven.

âI am not quite the heartless, selfish girl you seem
to think me.â There were tears in her eyes now, and
her voice trembled. The last trace of displeasure had
gone from her fatherâs face. John alone was still
standing out against her.

âI know,â she continued, âthat I have been extravagant,
and I am going to make up for it. I have been
trying to get pupils for a private kindergarten. I have
called upon hundreds of wealthy mothers, and, at last,

Â
I think that I have the promise of children enough for
a start. That is why I wanted to postpone our marriage,
John.â She turned to him appealingly: âI could
not marry you, dear, before I had earned back the
money I had spent so foolishly.â

âMy dear.â Her father stepped forward, but John
was before him. âCan you forgive me, Lola?â Shame
and regret made his voice low and husky.

âMy friends!â Dr. Crossettâs cheerful tone broke in
upon them. âThe man who has a jewel, and does not
know its value is an ass. Now that you two can make
no more trouble for yourselves, in mercyâs name give
me my dinner.â

âI am ashamed, Lola,â said her father remorsefully.

âBut you shall not work any more. After to-morrow
night there will be no need for it.â

He put his arm about her lovingly, thinking proudly
of how much his approaching triumph would allow
him to do for her. Dr. Crossett turned from them
delighted at her triumph, but as he turned the look of
suffering on little Nellieâs face sobered him.

âThis child is in pain, Martin!â

Â
He stepped quickly to where she sat, forgotten all
this time, and bravely trying to conceal her suffering.

âMy dear Nellie.â Dr. Barnhelm went to her remorsefully.
âIs it so bad?â

âIt is bad enough, sir.â The childâs lip trembled as
his kind tone did what the pain could not do, and tears
came to her eyes, and she began to sob.

âThem dispensary doctors have made it worse,â
said the mother bitterly. âThey say itâs no use at all.
Theyâthey say her armâs got to go.â

âWhen did they tell you this?â

âThis afternoon, sir; thatâs why I had to come to
you. I canât stand it, Doctor. Iâve stood a lot, but I
canât, canât let âem do that to her. Sheâs all thatâs left,
and it seems like some one must be able to help her.â

âPaul, will you look at this child? You say that
you have worked on these cases. Canât you and I
together help this little girl?â

âYes, Martin,â Dr. Crossett exclaimed with resolution.
âYes! Come! I will examine her!â

âLet her wait until after dinner,â interrupted Lola
impatiently. They all looked at her astounded, the
agony in the motherâs voice had moved them deeply.

Â
Dr. Crossettâs kind eyes were full of tears. Dr. Barnhelm
was more surprised at her tone than indignant
at her heartlessness, but he responded rather sharply:

âLola! The child is suffering.â

âNaturally, I am very sorry for her,â replied Lola,
âbut you canât stop all the suffering in the world, and
Iâm sure Jane will be furious if we keep her waiting
much longer.â

âCome, Nellie,â said Dr. Barnhelm, replying to Lola
only with a look of reproach. âWe will use the library,
Paul. You can be making us a cocktail, John; we
wonât be long.â He turned kindly to Mrs. Mooney.
âIt would be better for you to remain here. This
gentleman is Dr. Crossett, one of the leading surgeons
of Paris. He will do his best to help us.â

âGod bless you, sir,â cried the grateful woman to
Dr. Crossett, impressed, as all whom he met were, by
his air of quiet confidence. âI think you would help
her, if you could.â

âI am going to try, very earnestly, very hopefully.
She is young; that is in our favor. Very shortly now
I shall tell you, quite frankly, just what our chances
are.â

Â
He left the room with Dr. Barnhelm and Nellie.
John had stepped into the dining-room to mix the cocktail.
Mrs. Mooney stood watching Nellie until she
had passed out of sight, then turned and crossed to
where Lola stood looking indolently out of the window.

âYou say you canât stop all the suffering in the
world,â she began, trying hard to control herself.
âNo, you canât! That child of mine was born to it.
Sheâs had it every hour of her life. Donât think I am
forgetting what I owe to your father, and to you. But
I never thought to hear you speak like that!â

âWhy did you come here?â Lola turned on her
with a fierceness that made her own seem tame. âHow
dared you and your sickly child put me in a false position?
Do you think that my father has nothing to do
but devote his skill to you? For what?â She hissed
the question at her, her voice shrill with scorn and
contempt. âYou wonât pay him. You know that!
His time is his wealth, and you rob him of it. Do you
know what they call a person who robs another of his
wealth? A thief!â

Mrs. Mooney drew back, almost cowering before the

Â
flashing brilliancy in Lolaâs eyes, heart-sick at the
bitter insult of her words. But she was proud, with
the decent pride of a woman who has lived a hard
life blamelessly, and there was a trace of Lolaâs own
bitterness in her voice as she answered.

âIâve been an honest woman always, but if it would
bring health to her Iâd be a thief. Maybe itâs just
as hard for me to take your charity as it is for you to
give it. After what youâve said Iâd rather cut my own
arm off than come here, but it ainât my arm thatâs in
danger, itâs Nellieâs, and sheâs got to have her chance.
God knows best whatâs come over you, Miss, but your
heart ainât the same as it used to be.â

She turned and left the room, waiting patiently,
humbly in the hall outside the library door, straining
her ears to catch a sentence here and there from the
murmurs of the doctorsâ voices, and as she waited she
prayed, over and over and over again. âDonât take
her from me, God! Donât! Donât! Donât take her!
Donât take her!â

They found her there when at last the door opened
and the two physicians stepped into the hall with Nellie

Â
between them. At the sound of the opening door she
turned and looked straight into Dr. Crossettâs eyes.
Judges on the bench have seen such a look on the face
of poor, desperate creatures, waiting for the words
that would mean life or death.

From one face to the other her eyes turned, at first
not daring to read, not daring to credit what she
seemed to see.

âYou tell the doctor at the dispensary,â Dr. Crossettâs
voice was husky, but his face beamed with triumph,
âthat he happens to be a jackass. You tell
him that I, Dr. Paul Crossett, will make this childâs
arm as good as new!â

âOh, no! I donât ask that, Doctor. Just help her a
little.â

âI will cure her. I give you my word.â

âIs it true?â She turned to Dr. Barnhelm, not
daring to believe.

âYes. It is true.â

âGentlemen!â She was not without dignity as she
faced them, her arms about her daughter. âYou canât
expect a woman like me to know how to thank you. I

Â
canât ever pay you, not with money, or with words.
All I can ever do isâis to pray for you.â

âThat,â replied Dr. Crossett, with the bow he
usually reserved for the greatest ladies of his own
brilliant world, âthat is not often done. It is enough.â

Â

CHAPTER IX

THE DIAMOND NECKLACE

âWill
they be much longer?â asked John, stepping
into the room with a tray of glasses
in one hand and a silver cocktail shaker in
the other.

âI am sure I donât know,â replied Lola, turning
from where she still stood by the window, and moving
slowly across the room to him. âI am going to try
your cocktail, John.â

âYou? Why, you never drank one in your life.â

âWhat of it? I am curious.â She took one of the
empty glasses from the tray and held it out to him
coaxingly.

âYour father wonât like it,â he warned her.

âHe wonât know it.â

âNow, Lola!â

âDonât be an old woman, John! Come!â

He rather reluctantly poured her out a very small
drink, as he was far from sure whether or not the

Â
Doctor would approve. Lola, up to now, had always
shown the most complete distaste for any sort of
liquor, a distaste which she really felt; which any
healthy young person would feel were it not for the
vague general impression that somewhere in the drops
of liquor is hidden some hint of romance, some glimpse
of mysterious knowledge; the desire of the unknown.

âHow very generous,â remarked Lola, looking at
the few amber drops in the bottom of her glass.

âQuite enough to begin with,â replied John, and he
watched her curiously as she put the glass to her lips,
and laughed heartily as he saw her gasp and the tears
come to her eyes.

âWell?â he questioned.

âI donât like it.â

âOf course you donât.â

âDo you? Does anyone?â

âI think not, Lola. Not at first, anyway. It is the
physical excitement, the stimulation.â

âI think I understand,â she spoke dreamily, thoughtfully,
for she had often wondered lately why so many
people seemed to care so much for a thing that had
never meant anything at all to her, so little that up to

Â
that very moment she had not even been curious. âTo
change, if only for a moment the deadly monotony of
things. To have another emotion, a new sensation.
You will have to make me cocktails when we are married,
John.â

âWell, Iâââ

âYou must! I want to learn everything. I am tired
of being just a girl. Isnât there anything else in life
but to sit here with you and father, and his friends?
Are our hearts always going to beat on, one-two, one-two,
like the ticking of a clock? You say you love
me, but you are as cold as ice!â

She drew close and looked up at him queerly. Her
eyes now were not the eyes he knew so well, calm and
grave, or smiling; they were deeper, he thought;
deeper, more beautiful, butâthey seemed to fascinate
him; he felt himself grow dizzy; the blood leaped in
his veins and pounded in his heart. He put his arms
about her and drew her closeâclose. She smiled now,
with a smile he had never seen on her face before. It
made her look older, wiser. How beautiful she was.
She was a woman, no longer a girl, and all her beauty
was his. His!

Â
âYou say you love me,â she whispered quickly, with
a note in her voice new to him, but strangely thrilling.
âIf you want to keep my love you must make me mad
for you. Are you made of flesh and blood? Come!
Kiss me!â

He kissed her. Kissed her with a depth of passion
such as he had never dreamed of, and for a moment
she returned his kiss, then relaxed and lay half fainting
in his arms, then releasing herself with a low
laugh she stepped away from him.

âThere! Thatâs different. I do love you, John,
more than I thought I did.â

âLola!â He tried to take her in his arms again, but
she laughingly avoided him, going around the table,
her eyes still challenging him to follow.

âYou are a silly boy, John, but I like you very much
to-night.â She bent over the table, tauntingly, alluring.
âYou are not quite as cold as you look, John.
Wouldnât it be funny if I had to be afraid of you?â

He followed her; she laughed again, and started to
run to the door, and as she did so a small, flat leather
box fell out of the fancy shopping bag she still held

Â
in her hand, and which had come unfastened, as she
had drawn herself away from him.

As John stopped and stooped to pick the little box
up, her whole manner changed so suddenly that he
was startled. The love, the mischief, and the deeper
feeling that had done so much to intoxicate him, was
wiped out, and in its place there was a look of fear and
anger, and as she spoke her voice was harsh and cold.

âGive that to me.â

âWhy?â He hesitated, astounded.

âGive it to me.â

âWhy not?â He handed it to her, and as she took
it from him her face changed again, and she looked
relieved and happy.

âWhat is it, Lola? It looks like a jewellerâs box.â

âHush! We are not married yet, Mr. John Dorris.
You must not pry into the mysteries of a ladyâs toilet.â

âOh!â He laughed happily as she returned the
little box to her bag, and made sure that it was
fastened. âIt is hardly fair for you to blame me for
our not having married, Lola, is it? Come, dear;
why should you keep putting me off? I have money

Â
enough to take care of you, and Iâll be making more
right along now. Come, Lola! Canât it be soon?â

âThat is quite enough of such nonsense,â she said
airily, still keeping away from him. But he was serious
now. He had been deeply stirred, and, like most men
who, as a general thing, have their emotions well under
control, it was difficult for him to so suddenly regain
his composure. âIâI love you, Lola!â

The real earnestness in his tone stopped her. It was
as though something deep in her heart answered to the
yearning in his voice, and she turned gently to him,
a look on her face that he had not seen for weeks.
The look of the gentle, timid girl who had learned to
come to him for comfort and protection.

âYou must love me.â She was pleading now. âI
need your love, John. You must keep on loving me,
with all your heart.â

âI love you, Lola, with all my soul.â

There was terror in her face now, an instinctive terror
that she understood as little as he did.

âDonât! You frighten me!â She trembled, pale
and distressed. âIâI donât know why, but I am
afraid.â

Â
âLola, what is it?â

She did not answer, but stood there, a queer,
thoughtful, puzzled expression on her face; and before
he could ask her any more questions they heard Mrs.
Mooney and Nellie as they passed down the hall, and a
moment after Dr. Crossett and Dr. Barnhelm entered,
smiling happily.

âShe is going to be all right, that little Nellie,â announced
Dr. Crossett gleefully as a boy might have
done. âAh! Sometimes it is a very fine thing to be
alive!â

âDoctor,â said Maria, standing in the open door,
âJane says sheâd like to have a chance to wash up
before breakfast.â

âCome!â The Doctor, who had quite forgotten dinner
in his joy over his friendâs confidence in Nellieâs
recovery, looked at Maria remorsefully.

âAll right, Maria, we are quite ready.â

âWe will need more ice in these cocktails,â said
John. âWill you help me, Maria?â

They left the room together and Dr. Crossett went
to Lola and offered her his arm.

âMy arm, Mademoiselle.â

Â
âPlease donât wait for me, Doctor. All I want is a
little drop of coffee. I had tea with Mrs. Rupert. You
run right along. I will be with you in a few moments.â

âI would wait,â he returned politely, âbut, oh, I am
so hungry!â

âYou poor man. Run!â

âI run!â And he left the room, half dragging Dr.
Barnhelm with him.

Lola stood for a moment, until she heard the scraping
of the chairs as they seated themselves about the
table in the next room, then, with a quick, furtive look
over her shoulder, she took the small flat box from
her bag and, opening it, held up under the brilliant
electric lights a flashing, sparkling chain of gorgeous
diamonds. No one saw her, as she stood there, playing
lovingly with them, dropping them over her dress,
holding them about her throat, her eyes blazing with
joy and excitement. Had there been anyone to see,
the thought would have come to him that in her face
there was a passion of greed scarcely human, and
when, for a moment, she thought she heard a step
approaching, a look came to her as she hid the jewels
in her breast like the look that comes to a wild beast

Â
of the jungle, when it is threatened with being robbed
of its prey.

After a moment, standing there, tense and watchful,
she drew them out again, and held them up, her face
all smiles and happiness, her eyes flashing back the
brilliancy of the jewels. At last she tired of them and
dropped them carelessly on the table, and stood there
thinking of where she could conceal them. It would
be nice to have them always with her, to feel them
about her neck, but she was afraid. The possession
of a fortune in diamonds would be a difficult matter to
explain. She thought of the wall safe, and at once
decided to put them there, so she went to it quickly
and worked the combination. As she opened the safe
the first thing she saw was the large roll of bills, left
there by her father. She held them in her hand for a
moment. Dr. Crossett had given her father more
money. She was very glad of that. It was so tiresome
to be always hearing him complain of poverty.
She threw the bills back carelessly, and, taking out a
small jewel box of black japaned wood, unlocked it
with a tiny key from her bag and, putting her necklace
back in its case, locked the box and the safe, turning

Â
away quickly as she heard the bell ring and Maria go
to the door.

A moment later, as Maria returned down the hall
with a card in her hand, Lola met her.

âWhat is it, Maria?â

âA lady to see your father.â

âA patient?â

âShe didnât say.â

âLet me see that card.â Maria gave it to her, and,
after glancing at it, she said quietly, âShow her in
here, Maria.â

âShe asked especially to see your father.â

âDo as I tell you, Maria.â

âYes, Miss.â

Maria went obediently to the hall, returning a moment
later, followed by a dark, middle-aged woman,
showily dressed, and evidently in a very bad temper.
The woman bowed coldly, but Lola made no pretence
of returning her bow.

âYou need not wait, Maria.â

Maria left the room, and Lola stepped to the door
of the dining-room, and looked in, smiling at the three
men who so eagerly rose to greet her.

Â
âDonât get up, please. I am not coming just yet,
only please donât drink all the coffee.â

She closed the door, and, turning suddenly on the
woman, who stood in the center of the room, she demanded
angrily:

âHow dare you come here?â

âI came to see your father,â responded Madam
Zelya curtly, a trace of foreign accent in her speech,
and more than a trace of stubborn anger in her
manner.

âI told you, over the telephone, that I would call, or
send a check, in a day or two.â

âI cannot wait a day or two! The bill is long past
due. My landlord, he vill not vait a day or two. My
girls they vill not vait a day or two for their wages.
Ze money it must be paid to-night.â

âMy dear Madam Zelya! Wonât you be seated?â

âNo! I prefer to stand. I vait here until I ged my
money. Ef I stand perhaps Iâd nod vait so long.â

âNow, Madam, as a favor to meâââ

âI trust you too much,â broke in Madam angrily.
âMeeses Harlan bring you to me. I gif you credit, you
do not pay. Meeses Harlan she half told me that your

Â
fadder he âes a great doctor. Well, ve shall see if he
vill pay.â

âI want you to go,â Lola spoke imperiously. âGo!
At once!â

âSix hundred and sefenty-fife dollars ef you please.â

âWait!â The thought had suddenly flashed into
Lolaâs mind. There was money there in the safe, a
large sum. She had seen several hundred-dollar bills.
This woman would not go without money. Unless she
went at once, before dinner was over, John and her
father would learn about the bill for six hundred and
seventy-five dollars. They would not understand; they
would make a fuss. Surely anything is better than a
fuss.

She did not hesitate once she had made up her mind,
but stepped to the safe and turned the combination,
opened the door and, taking out the roll of bills, calmly
counted out the necessary sum.

âYou have a receipted bill?â

âYes, yes, Miss Barnhelm.â

The woman was all smiles now, bowing respectfully
and humbly.

Â
âTake it.â Lola held the money out with one hand,
as she took the receipted bill with the other.

âThank you, Miss Barnhelm. I hope I haf nod
offended you. I am a poor woman, and I haf many
expenses.â

âI have paid youânow, go.â

âI haf some beautiful new goods, just from Paris.
If you will callâââ

âIn future,â said Lola coldly, âI shall make my purchases
from better established places of business. I am
not used to being annoyed. Maria!â She stepped to
the door and called.

âEf you would led me try once more I would not
trouble you about the bill, Miss Barnhelm. Et es nod
from these people who haf money that we want it, it
es only from dose that haffenât it.â

This piece of worldly philosophy, however, made no
impression upon Lola, who smiled calmly and haughtily,
enjoying the poor womanâs servile repentance,
until Maria came in answer to her call.

âThe door, Maria.â And Madam Zelya, unable to
find any trace of softening in Lolaâs face, was forced
to follow Maria, her mind divided between grief over

Â
the loss of a good customer, and joy over the collection
of a bill, that the instinct of her Hungarian Jew ancestors
had warned her was to be classed as doubtful.

As they left the room, Lola stepped to the safe,
meaning to replace the rest of the money, but as she
saw it in her hand, and thought of other little accounts
that pressed for settlement, she hesitated. âI donât see
what difference it makes,â she thought. âDr. Crossett
can easily give father more, and they would probably
make just as great a row over the loss of the six
hundred and seventy-five, as they will now about the
whole amount.â

So she put it in her bag, locked the safe and stepped
into the dining-room, just as coffee was brought on.
She had grown very fond of coffee of late, strong and
black, with no cream or sugar. It seemed to tone her
up. She was perfectly well, but she had grown to
depend upon the pleasant exhilaration. She drank two
cups with them. Dr. Crossett thought as he watched
her that never in all his experience had he seen a young
woman in such splendid physical condition. Her
father smiled on her proudly, as she met and routed
the Doctorâs affectionate teasing, and as for John, he

Â
was already so completely in love that he was quite
satisfied just to sit and watch her. She had changed
greatly of late, there could be no doubt of that. The
girl was gone, but in her place was this brilliant, fascinating
woman. John thought himself a very lucky
man.

Â

CHAPTER X

MARIA ACCUSED

âThis,â
said Dr. Crossett to Lola, as they sat
together in the window, looking out at the
river and the endless procession of automobiles
below them, âthis is good! It is not Paris, but it
is good!â

âThe only reason you wonât admit itâs better than
Paris,â laughed Lola, âis because you are cross about
having had such a dreadfully bad dinner.â

âOh, no,â he replied politely. âIt was a very good
dinner. It is true that some hours ago it might have
been better, but our appetites would not have been the
same. Any food is good to a hungry man. Your
father and I have often dined on bread and cheese, and
pilsner, and thought it a feast.â

âYou were poor there at the University?â she inquired
curiously. Somehow she found it difficult to
think of him as ever having been poor; he was so
completely marked with the stamp of worldly success.

Â
âVery poor,â he answered gayly, for it had been a
long time ago, and poverty leaves few scars on the
heart of a man who has conquered it. âSo poor,â he
continued, âthat we owned nothing in all the world, not
even a trouble. We lived together four, no, three
years, wasnât it, Martin?â

âThree years, Paul.â

âWhat we had we shared,â he turned again to Lola.
âBooks, clothes, money, tobacco, and happiness. I
made much money later, because I had nothing better
to do. Your father was wiser than I, but now Martin,
when money is coming to you, you can do much for
this little one.â

âYou mean his lecture to-morrow night?â asked
Lola. âIt is very flattering, of course, that the Medical
Society should want to listen to him, but he isnât going
to be paid for it.â

âIt will bring fame, Lola, and fame, especially here
in your country, means money. Have you much to
do before to-morrow night, Martin?â

âMore than I like to think of,â replied the Doctor.
âMy mind should be fresh and clear, and how can it be
if I must spend all to-morrow running errands?â

Â
âCould I help you?â asked John. âI could find an
hour or so in the morning.â

âI think not, and yet I am not sure. Would you be
willing to call at Karn & Companyâs, on Thirty-first
Street, and pay my bill and see that my apparatus is
sent to the Medical Society?â

âGladly,â replied John heartily.

âIt would save me half of the morning. Wait; I
will give you the money now.â

He stepped across the room to the wall safe. Lola,
looking up idly at Dr. Crossett, who was standing
beside her, saw him as he put out his hand and fumbled
helplessly with the combination.

âLola,â he turned to her. âWould you mind opening
this thing for me? I never can remember how to
do it.â

âYou had better ask Maria, father. She is the only
one who really understands it,â answered Lola quietly.

âVery well.â He went to the door and called.
âMaria! Maria!â

âWhat a gorgeous night, Doctor,â said Lola to Dr.
Crossett. âDonât you envy those people out there in
their automobiles?â

Â
âHardly,â he replied, âbut if you are so anxious as
all that for a car, I fancy it wonât be long before your
father can make you happy.â

âYes, Doctor?â Maria stood in the doorway.

âWill you please open this safe for me, Maria?â

âYes, Doctor.â She went at once to the safe and
turned the combination, then stepped back to allow him
to approach it.

Lola and Dr. Crossett were laughing now, laughing
so merrily that John went over to them to join in their
fun.

âWhat is it, Lola? May I hear the Doctorâs story?â

âI was telling her,â began Dr. Crossett, âof a
queerâââ

âLola!â Dr. Barnhelm interrupted nervously. âIt is
very strange, but I canât find the money! You have
not put it anywhere, have you?â

âNo, father. I havenât opened the safe for days.
Go on with your story, Doctor.â She turned to him
expectantly.

âI tell you,â repeated her father, âthat the money is
gone. I have been robbed!â

Â
âImpossible, Martin!â Dr. Crossett crossed the
room to him anxiously.

âYou saw me put it there yourself! Look!â He
pointed to the safe.

âBut, since you put it there,â exclaimed Dr. Crossett,
âwe have not left the room, excepting to our dinner.
It must be there.â

âIt is not!â The Doctor spoke impatiently.

âBut, Martin, who could rob you? Who, besides
ourselves here, knew of the money?â

âWhat money?â inquired Lola. âSurely you do not
mean that you had any large sum there?â

âEight hundred and fifty dollars,â replied her father
bitterly.

âThis lock has not been tampered with,â announced
Dr. Crossett. âThe safe has been opened by someone
who knew the combination. Who knew it?â

He turned, facing them all. âYou, Lola. Who
else?â

Lolaâs eyes met his, quite calmly, then turned and
rested upon Maria, and stopped there. One by one
the others followed her look, until they were all looking
at Maria, who grew uneasy under their gaze.

Â
âI knew it, yes!â Mariaâs voice was trembling. She
had done nothing wrong, she was sure of that, but the
look in their eyes troubled her. âMiss Lola taught it
to me. I didnât want to learn it, but she made me.
What are you all lookinâ at me that way for? You
know I ainât a thief!â

âHas any stranger been here while we were at dinner?â
inquired Dr. Crossett gravely.

âYes,â cried Maria, eagerly. âThere was! A
woman; a Dago or something.â

âI saw the woman,â said Lola quietly. âShe called
to see you, father. She was a collector for some Hospital
fund. I did not leave the room while she was
here.â

âMiss Lola!â Maria turned to her. âDidnât you
go there for something? Didnât you put the money
somewhere to keep it safe? Didnât you take it out,
meaning to put it back, and forget?â

âNo, Maria. I did not.â

âYou are all lookinâ at me,â cried poor Maria, âas
if you thought I was a thief! Why donât you search
me? Why donât you search my things? What do you

Â
all stand there for, doinâ nothinâ, and lookinâ at me
like that?â

âMaria!â Dr. Barnhelm spoke gravely, but very
kindly. âWe, all of us, are very fond of you. From
the first you have been more like a friend to us than
like a servant.â

âOh, donât I know that? Didnât Miss Lola pick me
up out of a tenement, a dirty, ragged, hungry little
kid? Ainât you done for me what my own father and
mother never did? Donât you see thatâs the very reason
I couldnât rob you? I couldnât! I couldnât!â

âI blame myself,â said Dr. Barnhelm huskily, âfor
leaving so large a sum of money where a young girl
could be tempted by it.â

âI have it,â exclaimed Dr. Crossett. âSuppose that
we, all of us, were to leave the room for a few moments,
eh?â He turned from one to another, doing
his very best to look smiling and unconcerned. âMaria,
while we are gone, might hunt about a little, and if she
found this money and put it back, no one would ever
say a word. All would be as it was before.â

âI never took it!â Mariaâs voice was shrill now and
in it there was a note of hopelessness.

Â
âTell them I never took it, Miss Lola! Tell them.â

âI have never known Maria to be dishonest, father.â

âMaria,â Dr. Barnhelm went to her, distressed, appealing.
âThat money was borrowed by me to pay for
the electrical apparatus that is to repay me for all the
work of my whole life. You know, Maria, how, day
and night, for months and years, I have gone on,
changing, adding, destroying, working. I neglected
everything and everybody for it. You know how much
it means to me!â

For a moment she could not answer, although they
all stood there, waiting. At last her voice came slowly
through the sobs that shook her from head to foot:

âYouâre killing me, thatâs what youâre doing, killing
me! Tearing my heart out of me. There ainât a man,
nor a woman, in all the world that I love like I love
you! Iâd rather be dead a million times than do what
you think Iâve done. You are all the good Iâve ever
known, you folks, but I wish to God Iâd never seen
you. I wish to God youâd left me where I was.â

âMon Dieu!â cried Dr. Crossett. âWhat is a man
to think?â

âYou all believe I done it,â went on Maria, âdonât

Â
you? Youâve all said so, all but just you.â She faced
John squarely, but John dropped his head; he could not
meet her eye. âYou think so, too,â she continued.
âYouâve got to think so, because,â she stepped close up
to him, âbecause the awful part of it is that it was just
meâor her!â She raised her hand slowly, pointing at
Lola.

âLola,â John turned to her, a queer, hesitating,
doubtful tone in his voice. âMaria is such a good girl,
IâIâââ

âWell?â

âThereâthere is no chance ofâof a mistake is
thereâyouâyou did notâââ

âNo,â replied Lola calmly, âI didnât.â

âDamn it, Doctor!â John turned to him almost
roughly. âLet me pay the eight hundred and fifty,
and letâs none of us ever think of this again.â

âYou donât think I done it,â Maria cried out, âyou
donât. But you are the only one. Well, Doctor,â she
turned to Dr. Crossett desperately, âIâm done. I canât
say anything more. What are you going to do?â

âUnless you restore that money to me at once,â replied

Â
the Doctor, sternly, âI must telephone for a police
officer.â

âYes, sir.â

âAnd I warn you that, if he comes, he will take you
away with him.â

âYes, sir, but it ainât that Iâm thinking of. It ainât
even that the news of me being called a thief has got
to go to the man I love. I canât even think of that
right now. Itâs that you believe it. IâI wonât try
to run away, Iâll be in my room there, when you want
me.â

She left them, and went blindly down the hall and
threw herself on her bed. No one could see her now;
there was no need to fight back the sobs that were
stifling her. Somewhere out on the ocean was a man
who loved her. What would he think of her now?
Under this same roof were the persons who had
taught her all that she knew of the good things of
life; to them she was a thiefâto themânoânot to all
of them! Lola! Lola! She sat up suddenly, dry-eyed;
her own words came back to her, âIt was just
me, or her,â and again she said, this time to herself,
âThatâs the awfulâawful part of it.â

Â
In the front room Dr. Barnhelm turned to John.

âDoctor,â he said, âthere is what they call a
âplain-clothes manâ that comes every night to the Athletic
Club, as soon as he goes off duty. I could get
him here in ten minutes. He might succeed where we
have failed, and he would keep quiet about it, if I asked
him to.â

âGet him.â

âShall I get him, Lola?â He turned to her with
something like a warning in his voice.

âWhy yes, John. I am very fond of Maria, and I
want you to make everything as easy for her as you
can.â

âI will be back in fifteen minutes.â

He turned and left the room, and the house. He
was stunned. Maria did not take that money! He
was sure of that. He could not have told why, but
he was sure. There could be no doubt. He had seen
the truth in her eyes. If she did not take itâwho did?
To him also came back Mariaâs words, âIt was just
meâor her.â He put that thought out of his mind, or
tried to. He must know. If Maria did not do this
thing she must not be allowed to suffer for it, of that

Â
alone he was sure. They must know! He crossed to
Broadway, almost running, and jumped on a downtown
car. It was only a few blocks, but he must return
as quickly as possible.

âHow are you, Dorris? Hereâs a seat.â

John looked up at the words and recognized Dr.
Rupert.

âGood evening, Doctor. Thank you.â He sat down
beside the Doctor, keeping his eyes fixed on the passing
street signs, anxious that he should not be taken past
his corner.

âIt was very kind of your wife, Doctor,â he began
pleasantly, more to make conversation than for any
other reason, âto do so much to help Miss Barnhelm
this afternoon. I hope that she did not tire herself.â

âYou havenât been taking a drop too much, have
you, John?â exclaimed Dr. Rupert, smiling broadly.

âWhy?â

âMy wife sailed for Europe, Tuesday.â

Â

CHAPTER XI

LOLA TRAPPED

âFifteen
minutes he said.â Dr. Crossett
glanced up at the clock. âHe should be here
very soon now.â

âI cannot see what difference a few minutes can
possibly make, nor can I see what this âplain-clothes
man,â as John calls him, can do when he gets here,â
said Lola impatiently.

âThe whole thing seems absurd to me. What can
one man do more than another?â

âI do not like this affair,â replied Dr. Crossett. âIn
Paris I had much to do with the medical side of
criminal practice. I made a study of convicted felons
for many years; of their minds, and their bodies. This
girl is not of the type. Lola! you have a womanâs
wit. If she did not do it, who did?â

He had been walking restlessly back and forth across
the room, but as he asked her this question he stopped
in front of her.

Â
âCould it have been anyone beside Maria?â

âShe and I were the only ones who knew how to
open the safe,â Lola answered in a perfectly matter-of-fact
voice. âEven I did not know that there was any
money there, and I would not steal your money, for I
know that I would only have to ask you for it, and you
would give it to me.â

âNo one but that poor girl,â the Doctor sighed. âI
liked her. I am sorry, also I am ashamed. I pride
myself upon some knowledge of character, and I have
been a fool. In this servant I thought I had found a
rare type of loyalty, an inborn refinement and delicacy
that sprang from a good heart, making no account of
the promptings of inherited vice, and untouched by
the degrading environment of her youth. Such natures
are met, not often, but I thought that hers was of that
description. WellâI have had many such disappointments.
We will talk no more about it. Come, Martin!â

He went to Dr. Barnhelm, who was seated at the
table in an attitude of utter dejection. âThe detective
may be able to make her confess; if not, we will go
to the bank again to-morrow.â

Â
Dr. Barnhelm looked up wearily.

âThere seems to be some curious fate hanging over
my machine, Paul. I feel to-night that my work has
been a failure.â

âA failure! You are dreaming, Martin. See what
your work has done.â Dr. Crossett pointed to Lola
indignantly. âShe was dead, and you brought her
back to life.â

âWhat do you mean?â Lola sprang to her feet,
facing them, her eyes blazing and her face livid.
âWhat do you mean?â

âLola!â

âHush, Paul! She does not know!â

âWhat is it that I donât know?â There was an awful
terror in her voice and as she faced them, clutching
fiercely at her heart, they saw the blood go from her
lips, and could hear her teeth chattering together convulsively,
so that she could hardly form her words.
âWhat do you mean when you say that I was dead?â
She tottered toward them, her arms outstretched.
âNo! Donât touch me. Why did you say that I was
dead? I was hurt, I was unconscious, but I was not
dead! Why donât you speak? If I was dead how

Â
could I be here? Oh, my God! Why did you say that
I was dead?â

âLola! My dear! You do not understand.â

âI want to understand! I must! I must!â

âQuick, Martin,â Dr. Crossett spoke sharply, his
eyes fastened on her face. âTell her!â

âMy experiments have made it possible for me toâto
artificially stimulate the action of the heart. Toâpractically
restore life, within a certain time. Youâyou
have never asked me for the details. There
seemed to be no need for you to know.â

âThe papers said that I was dead! IâI laughed
when I read themâwas it true?â

âMy child!â Dr. Crossett put his hand gently on
her arm. âYou must control yourself.â

âWas it true, father? Was it true?â

âYes. Help her, Paul. Help her!â

Dr. Crossett caught her in his strong arms and,
looking into her eyes, spoke soothingly.

âWhat of it? It is over. You are well now. You
are not marked, not hurt. You are as other women.â

She threw him off as easily as though he had been
a child.

Â
âAm I! Am I! So, I am not hurt; I am as other
women?â Then she laughed.

He had heard laughter of many sorts, this man
whose work had for years taken him to asylums, to
prisons, to locked rooms in stately palaces, rooms
where the windows were barred with iron bars; but
he had never heard a laugh like this; it had in it all
of mystery of which he had ever known, and something
else, some nameless thing that rang in his ears
for many years, and that seemed for a moment to stop
the beating of his heart.

Her laughter stopped, and she turned wearily to
leave the room, and as she did so they heard the outside
door open, then close with a crash, and John
Dorris stood in the doorway, facing her.

âYouâyou lied to me!â

Dr. Barnhelm stepped forward angrily.

âJohn!â

John did not turn his head but kept his eyes on her.

âYou told me that you spent the afternoon with Dr.
Rupertâs wife.â

âI did.â

âI met Rupert in the car. I told him what you said,

Â
and he laughed at me. His wife is on her way to
Europe.â

âNo!â Dr. Crossett cried out in denial.

âWhy should Rupert tell me so, if it were not true?
That is not all. You did not see his wife, Lola, but
he saw you. You were at Churchillâs restaurant for
two hours, with Dick Fenway!â

âNo, John!â Dr. Barnhelm caught him by the arm.
âWhat are you saying?â

âThe truth! I made him swear to it. He sat only
a few feet away from her. He described her dress;
he spoke of telling his friends who she was, when they
remarked upon the splendid jewels she wore about her
neck.â

âThere! He did lie, or he was mistaken. My
daughter wears no jewelsâyou know that, both of
you. Just a few little trinkets that were her motherâs.
No jewels; not one!â

âThank God!â exclaimed Dr. Crossett. âThank
God!â

âI will kill that man! Youââthe old man glared at
John contemptuouslyââyou, who say you love herâyou
should have killed him. She has no jewelsâsee!â

Â
He put his hand in the safe and drew out Lolaâs
little black jewel box.

âHere is all she has, all that she ever had. The key,
Lola, give me the key.â

âWhy?â

âI want them to see your poor little trinkets. By
God, no man shall doubt my daughter. Give me the
key!â

She looked around for a moment, from one to the
other, from John to her father, to Dr. Crossett, to
Maria, who had entered the room, and stood looking
at her. She was trapped. She knew that there was
just one chance, hardly worth the trying.

âIâthe key is lost, father.â

Dr. Barnhelm did not hesitate. He threw the delicate
wooden box to the floor and dashed his foot down
on it. It splintered to pieces.

âThere! Look! All of you!â

He pointed to a string of amber, a silver pin, andâ

âLook!â John stooped and held up before them the
string of flashing diamonds.

âLola!â There was agony in the Doctorâs voice.
âLola!â

Â
âItâit is not mine.â

âIt is the box you dropped in here, after you came
back from Dick Fenway. You would not let me see
what was in it.â John held up the battered leather
box. âSee how well it fits these diamonds!â

âThen you did open that safe since the Doctor put
the money there!â exclaimed Maria. âI knew you did.
You took that money.â

âWell, what if I did?â She was at bay now, against
them all, and she was glad of it. âI wanted the money.
Could I have asked any of you for it? You are all
so good, and so respectable that if I told you I wanted
a pair of decent gloves youâd say it was a sin.â

She put out her hand and tore the string of diamonds
away from John, and clasped them defiantly
about her neck.

âThis is mine, and the man who gave it to me will
give me as many others as I ask of him.â

âLola!â John cried out in horror, but she turned
on him fiercely, scornfully.

LOLA BEGS DICK FENWAY TO TAKE HER AWAY.

âWhy not? What have you to offer me to compare
with what he can give me? Am I to go on forever, and
ever, and ever, living the same life, thinking the same

Â
thoughtsâalwaysâalwaysâuntil I die? If that was
to be my life, how dared you bring me back from
death, back, with a thousand new feelings, and passions,
and desires? It was you who gave them to me.â

She was leaning forward now, across the table, her
eyes glaring at her father, who sat huddled in his
chair, his face slowly changing from a look of shame
and agony to one of horror. âYou made me what I
am. In your narrow, rusty lives you, none of you,â
she turned again to the others, âknow that outside your
rotten little world there is a life that is all gayety and
sunshine. I am going to it. Iâm done with youâall
of you!â

Before they could stop her, if any there had dared
to stop her, she left them. They heard her going down
the hall, and heard the door close behind her.

Â

CHAPTER XII

LOLA'S FLIGHT

Dick Fenwayâs
apartment was a popular place
for after-theatre parties, or any other description
of informal evening merry-making. It
was well within the âlobster belt,â less than five minutes
taxi-ride from âanywhere.â

It was, or rather was announced as âstrictly a
bachelor apartment,â but to a casual observer its
âstrictnessâ was largely a matter of the imagination.
Mrs. Harlan once remarked that the thing she liked
about a classy bachelor apartment was âthat they were
the only places in New York where they knew how
to treat a lady.â

Dick, who had been making a day of it, was entertaining
a party, of which, as usual, Mrs. Harlan was
the central figure. They had gone in a body to the
opening of a new musical comedy, but after the curtain
fell on the first act, she had announced it as âthe
same old thing, only a bit rottener,â and they had

Â
adjourned to Dickâs rooms to wind up the evening with
a game of roulette, to be followed by a little supper.
Mrs. Harlan had the bank and, being some three hundred
dollars ahead of the game, was in the best of
humor. Dick, as usual, had been losing heavily, but
did not seem to be greatly cast down by his ill-fortune;
as he expressed it, his âold man was too fat, and it did
him good to work.â

Aside from Dick and Mrs. Harlan, the party consisted
of Jim Winnett, a broker; Sam Norton, a popular
comedian, just at present out of an engagement;
Ted Hawley, one of those mysterious gentlemen, of
which this section of New York is so full, who manage
to live in great comfort on an income of nothing a
year, and, by no greater exertion, so far as anyone has
been able to discover, than it takes to array themselves
in well-tailored garments, and cultivate the pleasant art
of hand-shaking. Accompanying these gentlemen were
a carefully selected quartette of young ladies, whose
physical charms made up for any possible lack of
social culture.

Brooks, a man servant of perfect manners and unimpeachable
respectability, moved about quietly, supplying

Â
cigars for the gentlemen, cigarettes for the
ladies, and liquid refreshment for both, with a skill
born of long experience, and if he had any personal
opinion at all of his masterâs guests, it was hidden
behind a face of such absolute lack of expression that
it is to be greatly doubted whether they looked upon
him as a human being, or a bit of rather unusually
perfect mechanism, invented for their express convenience.

In most circles of this sort, a close observer will
notice that there is usually some one man, who seems
to be elected by unanimous vote, to pay all the bills,
and in this case Mrs. Harlan was not at all surprised
to discover that when Dick grew tired of throwing
away his fatherâs money, and retired rather sulkily
to a distant window seat, the game languished, and
after a momentâs puny struggle, died of inanition.

âYouâre a fine bunch of pikers,â the lady observed,
with that nice choice of the vernacular which constituted
one of her chief social charms. âThere isnât
sporting blood enough in the whole crowd of you to
drown a medium-sized flea.â

LOLA ACCEPTS THE CHAPERONAGE OF MRS. HARLAN.

âIâm sick of the game, Madge,â responded Dick

Â
moodily, âand I guess Iâm off my feed to-night. I feel
rotten! You folks start a poker game, if you want to,
Iâm going to sit around for a while.â

âHeâs in love, thatâs the matter with him,â said one
of the girls. âItâs that pretty little blond heâs
been rushing lately. Whatâs the trouble, Dick, did she
pass you up?â

âI donât know what youâre talking about,â Dick
answered, rather a nasty look coming into his eyes.
âYouâre all right, Nellie, but you spend so much of
your time talking that you never seem to say anything.â

âBetter let up on him, folks,â Mrs. Harlan observed
mildly. âDick knows what he is about, and itâs still
pretty good dope to learn to mind your own business.â

Conversations started along these lines have, in society
of this elevated description, been known to break
up the party, occasionally known to have led to the
breaking of more tangible things, but a sharp ring at
the bell interrupted them, and Brooks left the room
quietly to admit the late visitor.

âI wonder who that is?â questioned Mrs. Harlan.
âI hope itâs Bob Nelson. Bobâs not much of a talker,

Â
but heâs a real sport, and if we donât get some one to
throw out a life-line pretty quick, this party is going
to turn out punker than the show was.â

Brooks entered and, crossing to Fenway, announced
in a low voice: âA lady to see you, sir.â

âWho is she?â

âShe wouldnât give her name, sir; said she wanted
to see you, and if you werenât at home sheâd wait.â

âDo you know her?â

âNo, sir, she has never been here before, sir.â

âWell, I donât know who she is, and I donât care. I
canât be bothered going to the door this time of night.
If she wants to see me sheâll have to come in here;
if she donât like that she can go away. Tell her so.â

âYes, sir.â

âThis place of mine is getting to be like the corner
of Broadway and Forty-second Street,â Dick said resentfully,
as Brooks went to deliver his message. âIâm
about the only one in New York who doesnât feel at
home here.â

âWell, you are cranky to-night, I must say. Thatâs
a fine way to talk to a room full of guests,â remonstrated
Mrs. Harlan. âHow do we know thatâââ

Â
âThe lady, sir.â Brooksâ announcement interrupted
Mrs. Harlanâs speech, and they all glanced up as a
young woman stood on the threshold and looked about
her with wondering, excited eyes. Even to them there
was something strangely out of place in this girlâs presence
here; and as they saw Mrs. Harlanâs astonishment,
and heard Dickâs gasp of surprise, and something
very like dismay, they scented something out of
the ordinary, and bent forward in eager curiosity.

âLola!â Dick rose to his feet awkwardly. âLola!â

âYour man told me that to see you I must come in
here, and it was very necessary that I should see you.â

âI beg your pardon, I had no idea. IâIâplease
come into the next room, where we can talk quietly.â

âI say, Dick,â said Sam Norton thickly, âainât you
going to introduce the lady?â He rose rather unsteadily
and started toward Lola.

âYou go to hell, Sam!â Dick pushed him away
roughly. âCome, Miss Barnhelm, I am sure you will
feel more at home in here.â

As he spoke he opened the door of the adjoining
room and as she entered he turned so fiercely on the

Â
others that they lost at once any desire they may have
had to satisfy their curiosity.

âYouâd better keep away, all of you!â was all he
said, but the look on his face warned them that he was
in no mood to be trifled with, and as the door closed
behind him they did not even laugh.

The room into which he had taken her was furnished
as a library, and as Lola looked about her she
noticed with keen pleasure the tasteful and expensive
furnishings and the atmosphere of luxury. In reality,
it was Dickâs favorite room, and reflected, as rooms
sometimes will, the better side of his nature. It is
worthy of remark that of all the noisy party outside,
Mrs. Harlan alone had ever put her foot across this
threshold, and Mrs. Harlan, no matter what her faults,
at least had brains.

As Lola seated herself and looked around curiously,
he stood expectantly in front of her, waiting for an
explanation of her presence.

âWell, Lola,â he said at last, seeing that she made
no effort to begin.

âWell?â She looked at him smilingly.

âItâs awful good of you to come here, of course,

Â
Lola, but IâIâdonât you think you had better tell
me all about it?â

âThere is very little to tell, Dick. They scolded
me for being late; that started it, then John found out
that I had been at the restaurant with you; a little later
they found that silly diamond thing you gave me. One
thing on top of another was a little too much for them.
Things began to be very unpleasant, so I came away.â

âCame away. I am not sure that I quite understand
you. Came away for how long?â

âI am never going back there,â she replied, ânever
in my life.â

âAndâand you came to me?â

âYes.â

âLola! Do you know what that means?â

âIâI thought it would mean that you would be glad
to see me.â

He was far from being a good man. He had done
his best to bring this very thing about, but now that it
had come some little spark of manhood in him made
him hesitate. He did not speak for a moment, and
when he did it was in a voice more serious than any
of his friends would have recognized.

Â
âI am married, Lola; you know that, but my lawyers
are fixing things, and before long I expect to get a
divorce. Will you come to me now, and let me take
you away from all this mess, and marry me just as
soon as things are arranged?â

âAre you sure you want me, Dick?â

The look in his eyes was answer enough as he caught
her in his arms, but if she was afraid of him she
showed no sign of it. She allowed him to kiss her
once on the lips, then she gently freed herself, and
stood looking at him laughingly, and she seemed to
him so young, so like a pretty, inexperienced child,
that he was, for the moment, ashamed to press his
advantage over her.

âYou did want me after all, didnât you, Dick? I
was sure you would, although I was just a little bit
nervous, while your man kept me waiting at the door.
You are a dear boy, and I am going to learn to be very
fond of you, and just as soon as you get that horrid
divorce I will marry you, if you still want me.â

âAnd until then, Lola?â He looked at her with
a growing passion, as he realized how completely she
was putting herself into his power.

Â
âIt may be a month or two. Iâll hurry things all
I can, but until then what are you going to do? Letâs
have this settled right now. I wonât always be in as
decent a mood as I seem to be in to-night. What are
you going to do until then?â

âI am going to stay with you, Dick.â She looked
at him, blushing slightly, but without a sign of nervousness.
âNo, please!â As he stepped toward her to
take her in his arms. âI have thought it all out very
carefully. If I come to you it must be on my own
conditions.â

âIt shall be, Lola; anything you want you shall
have.â

âI want you to take me away, to-night, before any
of them can find me. I donât want to come back to
New York until after we are married. I will go with
you anywhere you want to take me, but not alone. You
must find some woman who will go with us.â

âMrs. Harlan,â he suggested promptly. âSheâs
rather hard up just now, and sheâd be glad of a little
trip. She could get away to-morrow, Iâm sure, if we
made a point of it; not to-night; no woman on earth
could do that.â

Â
âAsk her, and if she will go, ask her if she would
be willing to take me to her house to-night. John
will come here, I am sure of that, but he would not
dare to go there before morning, and if he comes then
we can find a way to avoid him. You can take us
there in a cab; then go to an hotel for the night.â

âDo you think I am afraid of John Dorris?â

âI think you are very foolish if you are not,â she
answered. âJohn is a quiet man, but if he were to
find us here in this room together, he would kill you!â

Dick was no coward, but the bravest of men scarcely
like to hear statements of this sort, and he remembered
the look on Johnâs face when he had passed him in the
doorway, the day Lola had been brought home so seriously
injured, killed, as they all supposed, by his carelessness.
So he lost no time in calling Mrs. Harlan
into the room, and telling her of their plans. She
gladly agreed to go with them on a visit to the various
summer resorts, and cheerfully offered to take care of
Lola until they were ready to start. She said it was
very sensible of them to avoid the chance of any unpleasantness,
and that the sooner they got away from
Dickâs rooms the better. She reminded them that it

Â
would be a very easy matter for John, or Dr. Barnhelm,
to get Dickâs address from the telephone book,
but she had no doubt of being able to keep Lola safely
in her own apartment, until they were ready to leave
the city. She returned to the other room for her wrap,
and John went to telephone for his car and to give instructions
to Brooks to pack up for a long journey.

LOLA CONFESSES HER LOVE FOR DICK FENWAY.

Left alone to wait for their return, Lola moved
curiously about, looking at everything with great interest.
How nice it was all going to be, to always be
surrounded by beautiful objects. Dick was going to be
very good to her, she was sure of that, quite sure of
her power over him. He was a good fellow; he had
never thrilled her as John had done, for a moment,
that very afternoon, but John was a prude; she never
would have been able to endure life with him.

How silly of her to have hesitated. She should
have left home long ago. She had supposed that it
would almost break her heart, but she did not seem to
care at all. She must remember that. Nothing ever
really mattered, after all, if one had the courage to
do as one pleased. Something always happened to
make things all right.

Â
She was glad when she came to think of it that Dick
was not in a position to marry her at once. She might
find that he bored her, or that he was not as kind as
she expected, and if so, why then she wouldnât marry
him at all.

As she had walked down Broadway, from the subway
station, a dozen men had turned and looked after
her, rich, well-dressed men, some of them. After all
there was no reason why a girl should worry, with
the world so full of men, all of them eager to lavish
their money on her. One had to be careful, of course,
and she meant to be careful. She had no fear of Dick,
she could manage him. John was different; if John
had been a bad man she would have been afraid of
him, afraid of herself, but, thank goodness, Dick was
harmless. He was too wise, too experienced; his very
look put her on her guard against him. What a fortunate
thing it was that men were such obvious creatures,
good or bad; how silly to be afraid of either
sort; one only had to be a little prudent, a little clever,
and perhaps a little pretty. She laughed softly to herself.
She was all of these, she knew, and more. She
had no fear of the world; she was not afraid; she was

Â
eager to match her strength against it. She felt perfectly
safe when, a few moments later, they shot out of
the side street, in Dickâs big car, and turned up Broadway.
It was midnight, but the great thoroughfare
was thronged with automobilesâthousands of them.
What a good time people had, to be sure; what a fool
she had been to waste any of her precious youth in the
dull life of her old home. She was only just twenty,
after all, she thought happily, and she had a lot of time
yet in which to be young and gay.

She was seated on the back seat of the car with Dick
and Mrs. Harlan. Dick was between them, and as
they turned into Broadway he took her hand, and
pressed it tenderly. She returned the pressure softly,
and looked up at him. As she did so she saw John
Dorris. He was on the crowded sidewalk, hurrying
down the street as fast as the throng in front of him
would allow. For a moment their eyes met. She saw
his pale, worried look change to fierce anger as he saw
her there with Dick and Mrs. Harlan. He sprang to
the curb and called out to her, but the car shot past.
He followed desperately. A traffic policeman might
stop them at Forty-second Street; that was his only

Â
chance. As he ran along, in the street, keeping close
to the sidewalk, hundreds of heads turned to look after
him. The Broadway crowd is quick to scent trouble,
and as they saw the look on his face they turned laughingly,
and tried to see what he was going to do.

âSome guy is going to get his, if that fellerâs legs
hold out,â remarked a fat man with a wide grin of
delight. âI wish heâd manage to pull it off quick,
âcause Iâm too damned fat to do a Marathon.â

There they were! The long line of cars had stopped
in response to the officerâs raised hand. He would do
it yet! His breath was coming in quick gasps, but he
saw them! He saw the big red car in the line with all
the others. He could see Fenway standing up, and
looking back anxiously. He had good reason to be
anxious!

Lola should not do this thing! This man should
not be allowed to blast her life! It would be better to
get him by the throat, and drag him out of the car,
and, no matter what, kill him if necessary. What came
after did not count. This girl, the girl he loved, should
not give her fresh beauty to this beast, soul and body
to his vicious pleasures. He was in time, thank God

Â
for that! They saw him now, he could read the look
of terror in Dickâs face, the queer expression of fascinated
interest, almost of delight in Lolaâs eyes, and he
put all his strength into one last effort.

As he sprang forward, his eyes on Dick, he heard a
shrill whistle. The long line broke, the car seemed to
leap from under his hands, he heard men cry out, angrily;
he felt rough hands hurl him back to the sidewalk,
and he saw Lola standing up, leaning over the
back of the car, looking back, and laughing at him.

Â

CHAPTER XIII

LOLA GOES TO FENWAY'S

It
seemed to Dr. Crossett, waiting there in the
room, with this silent old man, that John had
been gone a very long time. It was almost
morning now, five hours, time enough surely for much
to have happened. He had insisted, some hours before,
on Mariaâs going to bed, for in spite of her grief she
was so tired by the emotions of the evening, that it was
impossible for her to keep her eyes open, and he had
discovered her, sitting upright in a chair, sound asleep,
with the tears rolling down her cheeks.

He had made many efforts to induce Dr. Barnhelm
to speak of Lola, and of the events leading up to her
sudden desertion of them, but to all his questions, or
remarks, the old man refused any answer, other than
to look up, almost vacantly, and shake his head.

LOLA IN DICK FENWAYâS ROOMS.

âHe is stunned,â thought Dr. Crossett. âAs yet his
brain is too numbed to realize; to-morrow, unless John
brings her home, he will be desperate.â Would she

Â
come home? That was the question. That she had
been extravagant, and, through a desire for beautiful
clothes, had been, little by little, led into a maze of
debts, of which she had been afraid to tell them, and
that the sudden temptation, when she had unexpectedly
come upon that roll of bank notes, had been too much
for her to resist. All this was obvious, and, sad as it
was, was not unforgivable. That she had deceived
John, however, and, day after day, had lied to him, and
gone to the man whom, of all others, she had most reason
to avoid, was a treachery hard to excuse, even to
this man, who was doing his very best to find excuses.

What was the outcome to be? He could not decide.
There had been so much of real hate, and contempt,
in her manner to them, that it was out of the question
to put it all down to excitement, or girlish anger.

He quite realized that she had âburned her bridges
behind her,â that her manner of going had left her
no possibility of coming back, unless she came humbly,
and in repentance.

Try as he might he could not picture that. Humble
she might be, and repentant, but not until her spirit was
broken by suffering.

Â
He knew much of the world, much of human nature,
and he knew that she would have to make her
choice at once between evil and good. That alone
she could not hope to live, as she had said that she
was going to live. The good in her heart might save
her even now. She was like a child. When this man
offered her money and all the beautiful things she
longed for, did she know the price she would be asked
to pay? When she found it out would she shut her
eyes, and go blindly on, or would the innate delicacy
of her nature, the instinctive purity of girlhood, save
her, as it has saved thousands before her? This was
the only hope. He tried to have confidence; after all,
she was her motherâs daughter. He cherished that
thought. Her child could not sink so low! Great
God! She could not do it!

In the stillness of the early morning he heard the
clang of the iron doors of the elevator as they were
thrown open in the hall outside, and a moment later
John came in.

One look at his face was enough to tell him that he
brought no good news, but whatever it was he must
know it.

Â
âWell, John?â He came forward to meet him.
âWhat have you to tell us?â

John looked quickly at Dr. Barnhelm, and Dr. Crossett
understood that what he had to tell would destroy
any remaining hope that the old man might have
cherished.

âThank you, John, for doing what you have done.â

Dr. Barnhelm spoke quietly, but with a great weariness
in his voice. âI know that I am not alone in my
sorrow, but I wish to know nothing of what you have
discovered; nothing now, or ever, of where she has
gone, or of the things that she has done, or will do.
I am going to ask you both not to speak of her in
my hearing. It must be as though she were dead, until
the day she comes back to me.â

He rose as he finished, and walked to the door.

âBut Doctor, will she ever come back?â John said
despondently. âDo you think that we shall ever see
her again?â

âI am quite sure of it,â Dr. Barnhelm answered.
âThere can be no question of that; she will come
back.â

There was no hope or joy in his voice, only absolute

Â
conviction, and something a little like fear, at least
that was the thought that came to them both, as he
quietly left the room.

âHe is wrong, Doctor,â John said as the door closed.
âI have seen her. She is not coming back.â

âShe told you so?â questioned Dr. Crossett eagerly.

âNo. I did not speak to her. I saw her going up
Broadway in Dick Fenwayâs automobile. He was with
her. She had gone to him. Is with him now. I tried
to stop them, but I failed. They were not alone. They
had a Mrs. Harlan with them.â

âA woman! Thank God for that,â exclaimed the
Doctor. âWe may be in time yet, my boy.â

âYou donât know this woman,â John spoke bitterly.
âHer presence wouldnât protect any girl from such a
man as that. She laughs at the things you and I call
decency, or virtue. Between Dick Fenway and such a
woman, Lola hasnât a chance; not a hope! They wonât
stop, either of them, until they have dragged her down
to their own level!â

âI will go to her,â the Doctor spoke eagerly. âShe
would fear me less than she would you, or her father,

Â
because she has wronged me less. I will go there,
as soon as it is daylight.â

LOLA IS HAPPY IN DOCTOR FENWAYâS ROOMS.

âGo where? Do you suppose that if I could have
found out where they have taken her that I would be
here now?â demanded John. âI went to this Mrs.
Harlanâs apartment as fast as a taxicab could get me
there. Her maid said that Mrs. Harlan had not returned,
and was not expected before late in the following
day. The hall boys absolutely denied having seen
her since noon. What was I to do? While I stood
there at the door she may have been standing within
six feet of me, laughing at me, as she did once before
to-night. How was I to know? I left there, and rode
downtown to Fenwayâs rooms, on the chance that he
had left her. They let me go upstairs to his apartment.
At the door a servant tried to stop me, but I
threw him aside, and went in. There was a crowd of
half-drunken men and girls there. I asked for him,
and they told me that they hardly expected him to
return as he had gone away with a regular peach!
Damn them! They wouldnât tell me where I could
hope to find him, and when I grew excited they laughed

Â
at me. By God, Doctor, Iâve been laughed at too often
to-night. Someone is going to pay me for it.â

âMy dear boy,â said the Doctor gently, âsurely we
have enough to bear now; bringing another tragedy
into our lives is not going to do any good.â

âWhatâs the use of talking?â John was quite unnerved
by all the experiences and shocks of the last
few hours. âI came here because it was useless to
search any more until daylight. But I am going to find
that man. He canât hide himself from me forever.
He may take her away. He probably will, but Iâll
go after them. Not to bring her back; I canât do that.
I canât ever, ever think of her again with anything but
pity, but, by God, I can take him out of her life; yes,
and I am going to do it!â

âMy dear boy!â Dr. Crossett would have given
much to be able to comfort him, but as he had said,
âit wasnât any use to talk, suppose we sleep over
this. We canât do anything for several hours yet, and
we are both tired out. Come!â

âSleep! Do you expect me to sleep with the thought
of Lola and that mean being together, driving me
almost insane? Oh, I was a fool to come here. I

Â
should have kept on hunting for them. I must have
known you wouldnât understand. You donât know
what it is to love a girl, and to lose her; to think of
her and some other man living, laughing, loving one
another, without a thought of you.â

For a moment the Doctor seemed about to reply,
but with only a slight hesitation he smiled rather sadly
to himself, and spoke gently but with a trace of irony.

âWe will grant, John, that I do not understand; that
I know nothing of loving a woman whom fate sees fit
to separate me from; but I do know this: Always
there must be one love stronger than another; as it was
with you and Lola, so it always is. One who loves,
and gives, one who is loved, and takes; not always selfishly,
but always it is so. In your life you may love
again, for you are young, but you will never again be
able to give to any woman just what you gave to her.
It is not any manâs to give more than once. If I were
you I should try to be worthy of the love that, on your
part at least, was a very sacred thing. Any scandal
you bring upon her now, any act of selfish revenge
for your very real wrongs, is just going to become the
darkest shadow on your memory of her. If I could

Â
do it, my boy, I should forget the woman, and only
remember the love you had for her, for in all your life
you will never know a finer thing.â

âYou are a good man, Doctor, and I am ashamed
for having spoken as I did,â replied John earnestly.
âI canât make you any promise, because to me there is
only one thing to live for, just nowâto find them.
What will happen then I donât know, but I must speak
to her once more, and to him. I am going home now,
to change my clothes, and to write a note to the bank.
You must try to get some sleep. I will see you during
the day.â

âAm I to depend upon that?â inquired the Doctor.

âYes,â John answered. âNo matter what happens
I will keep you informed.â

He went away, down the elevator, and through the
deserted streets, to his rooms. He saw no beauty in
the dim, misty light of the summer morning, or the
faint glow of the first rays of the rising sun. He saw
nothing but Lolaâs face, as she had stood up in Fenwayâs
car, and looked back, and laughed at him.

When Maria came into the front room to put it
straight before breakfast she found Dr. Crossett still

Â
sitting where John had left him. He looked up and
spoke pleasantly to her as she entered, but she thought
that he had, as she expressed it to herself, âa queer,
far-off look in his eyes, like a person that had been
thinking of things that had happened a long time ago.â

Lola was sleeping very peacefully in a large and
rather ornate brass bed, in one of Mrs. Harlanâs guest
rooms. As she lay there, dressed in one of that ladyâs
absurdly ample night robes, she was smiling to herself
happilyâsome freak of what we choose to call our
sub-conscious mind had flashed across her brainâa
dream. There was no hardness in her face now, no
look of fear, or glitter of excitement in her eyes. She
was dreaming of John, and the day he had brought her
a beautiful bunch of roses; little Nellie, poor little girl,
was there.

âTake them, dear,â she muttered softly. âYou donât
mind, do you, John?â And John smiled back at her,
as they both thrilled at the memory of their first kiss.
How good he was, she thought; how gentle andâdarkness,
absolute darkness, such as the mind cannot
pictureâa fierce pang shooting through her heart, like

Â
a flameâslowlyâlife coming back, life and thoughtâand
memoryâbut the pain was there, and a horror,
a new burning in her blood, like that awful burning in
her heart. What was itâthis thing that frightened
herâthis new, strange nature that forced her to
do its will? She must get away, far away from these
thoughts; she must run, quickâquick, or it would be
too late. She must have help. âFather! Father!
Father!â

The sound of her own voice woke her, and she
found herself sitting up in bed, her hand clutching
at her heart.

âLola! What in the world is it?â Mrs. Harlan
came running into her room. âGood heavens, how
you frightened me.â

âIt was a dream,â said Lola, the terror slowly fading
out of her face. âA bad dream, and such a queer pain,
here.â She laid her hand again over her heart.

âYouâre not used to late suppers, I guess,â responded
the always practical Mrs. Harlan. âGo back to sleep
now, because weâve a million things to do if we expect
to get that afternoon train for Atlantic City. How

Â
much money did Dick give you to do your shopping
with?â

âI think he said it was five hundred dollars,â said
Lola carelessly. âI didnât count it. He said I could
get what else I needed as we went along.â

âHeâs a prince,â exclaimed Mrs. Harlan heartily.
âWe can stop in and leave an order with Madam
Zelya, to be sent after us.â

âWe can not,â replied Lola. âThereâs just one thing
in the world thatâs worrying me this morning; that is
that I was fool enough to pay her all that money.â

Â

CHAPTER XIV

ON THE ROAD

âDick,â
said Mrs. Harlan, with extreme politeness,
âI am perfectly willing that Lola
should have all the best of it. I am used to
that. I am quite prepared to admit that she is younger
than I am, and better looking, although I still think
that she might get along without telling me of it herself.
Itâs none of my business how much money you
give her, nor how much she may bully you in private,
but, my dear boy, I am just naturally damned if Iâll
put up with her tantrums any longer.â

âBut, Madge,â pleaded Dick Fenway, rather
anxiously, âLola isâa little nervous!â

âSheâs all of that,â agreed Mrs. Harlan. âWe
started out to make a jolly party of this and itâs winding
up like an Irish wake. Look at Bob.â

In response to her rather dramatic invitation, Dick
turned his head, and did as he was requested. He
looked at Bob, and in spite of his disturbed mind he

Â
found himself smiling. Bob Nelson, who made up the
fourth in their little party, was a stout young fellow
in the late twenties, whose sole ambition in life seemed
to centre about a desire not to have rows; he sat on
the sand a few paces away from them, and was earnestly
practicing his favorite amusement, which consisted
in fixing his eyes firmly upon nothing whatever,
and allowing his mind to âstand without hitching,â as
he had once described it, a mental gymnastic only possible
of achievement inside of a skull so constituted as
to allow the brain an abundance of room.

âBob,â continued Mrs. Harlan firmly, âis getting
good and tired of the way things are going. We donât
mind a little change now and then, but we do object
to being politely requested to get out of every hotel
between Palm Beach and Quebec. Bob! What is your
opinion of the way Lola is going on?â

Bob, evidently anxious to do the subject full justice,
gave the matter at least a momentâs calm thought before
he replied.

âIâerâyesâââ He then, with considerable satisfaction,
resumed his former amusement, only slightly
troubled by the unusual mental effort.

Â
âThere! You see!â exclaimed Mrs. Harlan.

Although somewhat in doubt as to precisely what
he was supposed to see, Dick was content to assume
that it was not exactly a compliment to Lola.

Lola had been making rows; there was no denying
that. She was difficult to please, and absolutely indifferent
to the rights of others. She was constantly
getting them into disputes with the hotel clerks, the
servants, or with the other guests, and on several occasions
during their trip they had been politely informed
that their rooms were needed for other purposes. All
this had been fully as annoying to Dick as it had to
either of the others, but during the six weeks they
had been together, his love for her had grown into a
great passion that made no account of her faults, although
it could not blind him to them.

âSheâs in a difficult position, Madge,â he explained,
anxious to smooth things over, for he knew that Lola
would not travel about with him alone, and for the
last few days he had seen that Mrs. Harlan was rapidly
growing tired of her rÃ´le of chaperone. âSheâs had to
break off with her people, and sheâs new to this sort
of thing. It will be all right as soon as that confounded

Â
divorce of mine is settled. Once we are
married sheâll settle down and have an easy mind.â

âAll right,â Mrs. Harlan sighed patiently. âIâm
your friend, and Iâll stick as long as I can, but I canât
help saying this, Dick: youâre the bravest man I ever
knew. They make an awful fuss about âDaniel in the
Lionsâ Denâ but he wasnât a marker to you!â

âOh, come now! Lola isnât so bad as all that. Sheâs
the best girl in the world, and the gamest little sport.
Of course, Iâll admit she is a little bit upset right now,
and her temper is a littleâlittle violent.â

âAnd then some,â agreed Mrs. Harlan coarsely.

âCome on; letâs go back and see if sheâs still asleep.
If she is the hotel people will probably allow us to
stay to lunch. Are you ready, Bob?â

Bob was never what could properly be described as
ready, but as it was easier on the whole to move than to
dispute the matter, and as he was vaguely impressed
with the idea that the word lunch had been mentioned,
he rose ponderously to his feet and followed the others
back to the hotel. Several groups of summer visitors,
noticing the deep abstraction of his manner, were quite
impressed. One young lady was heard to remark,

Â
that she âwould like to know what he was thinking
about;â a desire which, had he known of it, he would
have been quite unable to gratify.

They found Lola waiting for them on the broad
veranda, and as she saw them she came to the head of
the steps and stood there smiling down at them. She
was all in white, and looked as fresh and as sweet as
a flower. No one, to see her, would have believed
that only the night before she had left them in a furious
burst of temper, vowing that she never wanted to see
any of them again as long as she lived.

âIâve been waiting for you for the longest time,â
she cried out gayly. âI was afraid that you had all
grown so disgusted with me that you had run away
together, and were going to leave me here all by myself.â

âYou didnât answer when I knocked at your door
this morning, and I was afraid to wake you. I thought
the sleep would do you more good than anything else.â

Dick spoke tenderly, for he was really very fond of
her, and anxious that the scene of the night before
should be forgotten.

âArenât you going to kiss me, Madge?â

Â
As Lola held out her hand pleadingly, and with an
air of sweet repentance, Mrs. Harlan, who was kind-hearted
enough in her way, completely surrendered,
and kissed her warmly, although she had vowed to
herself that she would make no more efforts to live at
peace with her.

âAnd you, Bob?â As she stood with her arm about
Mrs. Harlan, she held out her left hand to him. âWill
you forgive me also? You see that everyone else has;
you donât want to be the hard-hearted one of the
crowd, do you?â

âLola, youâre all right,â said Bob, enormously flattered
by all this unusual attention.

âWeâre going to cut out rows after this, and have
a great time. Letâs go to lunch!â

âRight again, Bob,â cried out Mrs. Harlan. âI always
said you had more brains than any of us.â

âOh, no,â replied Bob modestly, as they started for
the dining-room, âI donât claim to have more than
my share of brains, but Iâm practical.â

They had arrived here, at Narragansett Pier, only
the day before, and Lola, who had been tired out by
the long journey from Bar Harbor, had refused to go

Â
down stairs to dinner, and had, as she always did of
late, taken breakfast in bed; so this was her first sight
of the pretty dining-room.

They were given a table by one of the front windows
looking out over the water, and as she seated
herself and looked around she made up her mind that
she was going to like this new place.

The room was crowded, although the season was
drawing to a close, and she noted with approval that
the guests were of a quieter sort than those to whom
they had been accustomed of late.

âItâs a fine assortment of old dopes weâve fell into
this time,â remarked Mrs. Harlan, looking about her
scornfully. âHadnât you better say grace, Bob, or
start a hymn?â

âGood God, Madge!â exclaimed Bob in horror. âIt
ainât as bad as that, is it?â

âItâs a good thing for all of us,â said Lola. âItâs a
rest to get where you can see decent women and children
again. Iâm tired of those sporty hotels weâve
been living in lately. Iâm going in for the simple life,
and besides, these are smart people; you can tell that
by looking at them. There isnât a thing in the world

Â
the matter with them, outside of their being respectable.â

âThey know enough to get good grub,â Bob asserted
with strong approval. âIf soup like this goes
with being respectable, I believe Iâll get me a pair of
spectacles and start in to raise whiskers.â

âLook!â Lola nodded her head in the direction of
a table near to them. âDid you ever see a finer looking
old man or a prettier child! I wonder if he is her
father? No, heâs too old. He is her grandfather;
that pretty little woman next to him is his daughter
and the little girlâs mother!â

âThank God for this cocktail!â exclaimed Mrs.
Harlan piously, as she raised it to her lips. âItâs all
thatâs keeping me from a bad attack of the âWillies.â
You donât seriously mean that you like this sort of
thing.â

âOf course I do,â replied Lola; âI like it better than
any of the places we have been to yet; donât you,
Dick?â

âI like any place where you are happy, Lola,â he
replied.

âQuick, Bob, send for another cocktail,â Mrs. Harlan

Â
demanded earnestly, âand tell the waiter to hurry
up with it, or Iâll be turning virtuous myself.â

There was, in fact, some reason for her surprise.
Lola was never in the same mood for any great length
of time, but up to now she had been tireless in her
search for pleasure and excitement. She could not
have told herself just why the atmosphere of this
rather aristocratic hotel appealed so strongly to her,
but the fact remained that, for the moment at least,
she was happier than she had been at any time since
their hurried flight from New York.

They had gone first to Atlantic City, where Bob had
joined their party, but on the second day after their
arrival, one of the private detectives whom Dick had
prudently engaged to keep an eye on John Dorris, had
telegraphed that John had just taken a train for Atlantic
City. How he had discovered their whereabouts
they did not know, but long before his train arrived
they were on their way to Cape May.

That was the last they heard of John; whether he
had continued the search, or given up and returned
home, they neither knew nor cared. They travelled
on, from one gay summer resort to another, as frantic

Â
in their search for amusement as the prospectors who
journey up and down the Yukon are in their search for
gold.

At first Lola had great trouble in teaching Dick
that, in spite of her complete surrender of her life to
his care, she had no idea of allowing him any favors
beyond those conventionally granted to an accepted
lover. On rare occasions she let him kiss her, with a
little more warmth than is usually considered quite
correct; he was privileged to hold her hand; once or
twice perhaps to take her in his arms for a moment;
aside from that all that he was expected to do was to
provide her with the most costly dresses, and in every
way to gratify her extravagant whims and caprices.

This attitude of Lolaâs was such a surprise to Mrs.
Harlan that the good lady went about in a sort of fog
of astonished admiration, and confided to Bob, at intervals
of about four hours, that Lola was âabout the
slickest article she had as yet discovered.â

Dick himself, however, seemed perfectly satisfied
after he had been made to clearly understand Lolaâs
attitude. She had read his nature with true feminine
intuition; to him the thing out of his reach was always

Â
the thing to be desired, and he made the life of his
Cleveland attorney a burden with his daily demands of
a speedy settlement of his divorce.

To Lolaâs father, sitting alone in New York, quietly
waiting her return, to John or to Dr. Crossett, now
half way across the Atlantic on his way back to Paris,
the knowledge of her attitude might have brought
some comfort; to them she seemed lost to all feelings
of shame or sense of prudence, and it is possible, had
they known how matters stood, that they would have
kept on in their search for her.

The real facts were that Dick was to Lola the direct
means by which she was to provide herself with
the good things of life. He was a rich man. As his
wife she could be sure of the things that just now
seemed to her to be of all things the most to be desired.
He, himself, was a handsome, good-natured, easily
managed young fellow. To the physical side of her,
which as yet had only been aroused for one moment
when she had thrown herself into Johnâs arms, Dick
made absolutely no appeal, and twenty years of purity
of thought and action had provided her with a defence
against the casual promptings of instinctive desires

Â
too strong to be easily broken down. Of late a
restless, nervous condition of mind and body might
have warned her of a growing longing to solve for
herself some of the depths of the worldâs knowledge.
Her eyes had more than once been held for a moment
by the bold, admiring gaze of some one of the strong,
handsome men whom she had met or when she had
passed casually on the beaches or on the hotel verandas,
but the quick catch of her breath, the sudden leap
of her heart at such times had speedily been forgotten;
she was not given to self-analysis; her whole existence
just now was centered in a daily search for pleasure.

After lunch she and Dick went for a long walk, and
Dick took advantage of her present gentle mood to tell
her of his hope of a quick settlement of his divorce
action and to discuss with her plans for their future.
As they strolled along the shore road, Lola noticed,
idly, a rather striking couple who seemed to keep at
about the same distance ahead of them; father and
daughter she thought they must be; a very pretty
girl of perhaps eighteen and a man in the late fifties,
but so hale and vigorous that at the first glance he
suggested no thought of age; indeed, it was not until

Â
the couple turned and passed them that Lola, glancing
quickly at him, saw on his face that in spite of his
youthful step and almost soldierly bearing, he was a
man of about her own fatherâs time of life. The thought
came to her, as for a moment she met his strong, eager
glance of approval, as he saw her fresh young beauty
and splendid vitality, that here was a man of real force.

âHow queerly he looked to me,â she thought, âthis
old man, with a daughter very little younger than I am
myself. Yet when he saw me his eyes seemed to burn
into mine. He is in mourning, too, for he wore a band
on his arm, and the girl is in black; how queer men
are. Are they always the same, boys and men, always
like that? A girl has only to look at them, and they
can think of nothing but her.â

âFather!â The young lady looked almost angrily
at him, then turning threw a quick look of scorn over
her shoulder toward Lola.

âWhat a bold-looking girl!â

âWas she, my dear?â remarked her father coldly.
âI thought her rather pretty.â

âPretty! She is beautiful. I was looking at her at
lunch. I thought she was sweet, although she was

Â
with impossible persons, but as she looked at you just
nowâââ

âWell, my dear?â

âShe looked likeâlike an animal.â

âA very fine animal, Alice; she is a very beautiful
woman, although I fancy you are right about her not
being quiteâquite the thing. The less notice you take
of such people the better, my dear, unless you know
something about who and what they are.â

âThat old boy,â remarked Dick to Lola, looking
after the couple who had just passed them, âis Howard
Bradley, of Detroit, one of the biggest lumbermen
in the country, said to be worth eight or ten millions.â

âReally?â She looked up with a quick flash of interest.

âYes, thatâs his daughter, Alice Bradley; you must
have often seen her picture in the Sunday papers.
Sheâs a real swell; they are friends of my old manâs,
although Iâve never met âem myself.â

âYou are a foolish boy, Dick. You must go and
introduce yourself at once! Itâs silly not to make
friends of that sort when you can.â

âBut I canât be bothered.â

Â
âNow, Dick, you do as I tell you. Iâd like to meet
a girl like that myself. You could introduce me easily
enough.â

âAll right, Lola,â replied Dick indifferently. âIâm
even ready to butt into society if you think it will
amuse you, but right now letâs go for a swim. Bob
and Madge will be waiting for us.â

The beach was crowded when they entered the water
together a little later, and as Lola was the only one
of the four who ever did any real swimming, she left
the others without ceremony and struck out for the
raft, which, as it was now high tide, was quite a distance
from the shore.

âCareful, Lola!â Dick called out to her anxiously,
but she only turned her head and laughed at him as
she swam easily along with an over-hand stroke that
sent her through the water without the slightest apparent
effort. In a moment she was past the line of
bobbing heads that marked the limit of the average
batherâs courage and in comparatively clear water; another
moment and she was within a few strokes of the
raft on which a half dozen men and one woman were
standing; one of the men she saw was the gentleman

Â
Dick had told her was Howard Bradley; the girl was
his daughter.

LOLAâS THOUGHTS REVERT TO THE HANDSOME STRANGER WHOM SHE MET ON THE ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK.

âShe neednât think she is the only girl that knows
how to swim,â said Lola to herself, as she deliberately
guided herself past the raft and out toward the distant
shore line; she was quite conscious of the fact
that all those on the raft had turned to watch her, and
a feeling of bravado urged her to keep on. She felt
strong to-day, full of youth and life, and she had no
fear of any danger.

âLook, father!â said Alice Bradley, following Lola
anxiously with her eyes. âSurely she is going too
far out.â

âBy Jove,â said Mr. Bradley, âsheâs fine. Look
at the way she goes through the water.â

âBut it isnât safe; you know it isnât,â exclaimed his
daughter. âLook! Look at her now! Father! Look
at her!â

âWait!â She felt her fatherâs fingers crush her
bare arm as he clutched her in his excitement. âSheâs
turned over, swimming on her back. Itâs all right;
I think Iââ No, by God! No! Here! Hello!
Hello, there, guard!â He pointed with one hand to

Â
where Lola floated, and waved the other frantically
to a life guard who sat in a boat nearer to Lola than
he was, but even at that a good fifty yards away. âBehind
you! There! Behind you!â

âHe sees her, father. He is going to her,â cried
Alice, while the others on the raft screamed out directions
and encouragement to the sun-burned young fellow
who was making his heavy surf-boat leap through
the water. âHe will be in time; she is keeping herself
afloat!â

She was keeping herself afloat, but that was all.
Suddenly a pain had shot through her heart, and she
felt herself powerless to move her arms; she sank
over, and when she rose to the surface just managed
to keep herself above water by floating on her back,
and now and then, by the greatest effort, taking a
feeble stroke when the numbness that was so rapidly
spreading over her body allowed her to do so. She
would die unless she managed to keep up until help
should come; she knew that! She was fast losing consciousness
now; she would die unless she forced herself
to live! Unless she drove back, bit by bit, the weakness
that was overpowering her. The pain in her heart

Â
was not so bad now; she could move her arm a little
more; she could move it more if she tried; she must
try; she wouldâthereâagainâagainâwhat did the
pain matter; it was lifeâlifeââ

âAre you all right now?â She was lying in the bottom
of a little surf-boat; a young man was bending
over her, speaking to her. She looked up into his face
and smiled. How big he was, and how strong, and
how naked. Arms, and legs, and breast, and shoulders,
firm, solid, sun-burned flesh.

He had one arm about her, holding her up. She
nestled close up to him, her head dropping back on his
shoulder, her eyes answering the challenge that suddenly
flashed into his.

Â

CHAPTER XV

ANOTHER CONQUEST

âI beg
your pardon, Mr. Bradley, but I am Dick
Fenway.â

Mr. Bradley looked up from his paper and
saw Dick standing on the veranda beside him.

âDick Fenway! My friend Fenwayâs boy.â

âYes, sir.â

âI am glad to know you, very glad!â He shook
hands warmly with the young man and turned to
where his daughter was standing, looking at them with
a smile of interest. âAlice, this is Dick Fenway.â

âIt was good of you to come to us like this,â she
said pleasantly as she gave him her hand. âYour father
has spoken of you so often that we feel quite as
though we had always known you.â

âYou are awfully good, I am sure,â replied Dick. âI
know that father would never forgive me if he heard
that I had been at the same hotel with you, without
making myself known.â

Â
âSit down, my boy, and tell us all about yourself.â
Mr. Bradley seated himself and pointed to a chair.
âHow long are you going to stay, and who is that
stunning girl I saw you with this afternoon?â

âMiss Barnhelm,â replied Dick, a little embarrassed
at the question. âShe is travelling with an old friend
of mine, Mrs. Harlan. I happened to meet them at
Bar Harbor last week, and as it was dead as a doornail
down there, I begged them to allow me to come
on here with them.â

âShe is very pretty and very reckless,â said Alice.
âI thought for a moment this afternoon that she would
be drowned. Has she quite recovered from her experience?â

âI think so,â answered Dick. âNaturally sheâs a
little nervous, or was when I saw her last. She is upstairs
now with Mrs. Harlan, but they sent down word
that they would go for a walk before dinner, so I guess
sheâs all right.â

âA girl that looks like that ought to know enough
to take care of herself,â remarked Mr. Bradley. âDid
she think she could swim across the sound?â

âIt was her heart,â replied Dick. âShe can swim

Â
like a fish, but sheâs had one or two little heart attacks
lately, and she ought to keep quiet. The life-guard
that brought her in said she was all right as soon as
he got her in his boat, but it was a close call, and the
worst of it is that she is very likely to do the same
thing to-morrow.â

âShe is coming down the veranda now,â said Alice,
âand she looks quite as though being half drowned
was an every-day experience.â

The two men looked up as Lola came toward them,
and both rose as she stopped by Dickâs side.

âAre you ready for that walk, Mr. Fenway?â

âQuite. May I introduce Miss Barnhelm, Miss
Bradley, Mr. Bradley.â

Lola greeted them pleasantly, and after a momentâs
coldness Alice found herself quite won by her sweetness.
She spoke of her adventure of a few hours before
in a tone of regret for what she called âmaking
a show of herself,â and her manner was so gentle and
so modest that Alice decided that she must be a girl of
good family and, in spite of the looks of the woman
with whom she was travelling, a very pleasant and desirable
acquaintance. âSurely,â she thought, âMr.

Â
Fenway would not introduce her unless she was all
right in every way.â

Lola, who was seated next to Dick, took advantage
of a moment when Alice turned to answer some remark
of her fatherâs, and whispered to Dick quickly,
âThere come Bob and Mrs. Harlan; keep them away.
Iâll meet you at dinner!â

âBut,â Dick protested, âwhy should Iâââ

âDo as I tell you!â She spoke so sharply that Dick,
who had learned by experience that to oppose her
meant a painful scene, rose unwillingly and went to
head off his long-suffering friends, making rather a
brief excuse for his abrupt departure.

âI thought you had intended to take a walk before
dinner, Miss Barnhelm,â said Alice.

âI had,â replied Lola, âbut I find myself more tired
than I thought I was, and it is so comfortable here.â

âIt is,â sighed Alice, âbut I must dress. I see that
you were wise enough to get ready before you came
down. Are you coming, father?â

âWhy, no, my dear,â replied her father. âI am going
to take advantage of my age, and dine just as I

Â
am to-night. Iâll sit here with Miss Barnhelm, if she
will allow me; meet me here when you come down.â

âVery well, dear; I wonât be long. Good-bye for
the present, Miss Barnhelm.â

She left them together and went up to her room,
a little surprised and troubled at the evident interest
her father had taken in this stranger. Since her
motherâs death she had often felt a fear that he might
some day allow himself to become attached to some
of the many women who, attracted by his wealth, had
done all in their power to fascinate him. He was different
from most men of his age. She knew that. He
was strong and well, and had much of the ardent spirit
of youth still remaining, but so far as she had ever
seen, he had shown no desire to respond to any feminine
advances, had never in fact shown as much interest
in any woman as he had in this girl, not only
since he had talked with her, but before. She had not
forgotten the glance Lola had given him as they had
passed on the shore road, or his admiration for her
prowess in the water. She dismissed any fears she
had, however. Miss Barnhelm was a lady; that was
evident from her manner. She was probably going to

Â
marry Dick Fenway; there had been an air of security
in her attitude toward him that spoke of a complete
understanding. How foolish of her to worry about
such an absurd thought.

âPoor father,â she said to herself; âhow angry he
would be with me if he knew of what I had been
thinking.â

Had she been able to see the growing intimacy between
Lola and the old man of whom she was so fond,
it is probable that her fears would not have been so
easily overcome. They were chatting away already
quite like old friends. Lola was leading him to tell
of some of his adventures in the lumber camps of
Northern Michigan, and incidentally gaining a good
idea of his vast power in that region and of the great
value of his timber lands and pulp mills. She was a
good listener, interrupting him only to encourage his
confidence and quick to see and appreciate any good
points in his somewhat long, drawn-out stories of
personal prowess. He looked at her with great approval.
âHere was a girl who had real brain, who
knew a man when she saw one, and was not either
afraid of or repelled by a few white hairs.â Her fresh

Â
beauty and something in the bold friendliness of her
eyes as she sat looking at him thrilled him as no woman
had had the power to thrill him for years. How
wonderful it would be, he thought, ifâbut no; she
was young. What chance after all would his millions
have with a girl like this? What need she care
for wealth with beauty like hers? Dick Fenway was
probably the lucky man. Damned young loafer. Good
God! How gladly he would give all he had to be that
age again! To be thirty and back in the lumber country
with his axe, and his youth, and his girl! Strong
desires, fought down and smothered out of respect for
a dead wife and a living daughter, blazed up again,
fired by a spark from this young womanâs eye. There
was something in her look that seemed to tell him that
to her he was not old, not rich, not past all chance of
womanâs love or hope of romance. She was looking
into his eyes as women had looked years ago, and she
was finding there what they had found. She was
seated very close to him, bending forward, eagerly listening
to his story, her hand resting on the arm of his
chair touched his; she did not draw it away; how
warm it was, how soft. What was this woman?

Â
This young girl, who in a few moments had gained the
power to stir into life feelings that he thought had
been forever buried with the other things that had
made life so sweet? What was there in her boldness
that charmed without offending him?

The story he was telling ended abruptly in the middle.
They sat there in the gathering darkness silently.
The little warm hand that lay beside his own slowly
turned and closed about his. His heart leaped; he
bent toward her, but she sprang up with a low laugh,
and before he could speak she was gone.

Alice found him there when she came down a little
later.

âHow well you look, father dear,â she exclaimed.
âI am sure that this place is doing you good. You
look almost young.â

âWhy shouldnât I?â he answered gayly. âA man
is as old as he feels, and I donât feel like an old man
to-night.â

As they went in to dinner they met Dick Fenway
waiting in the hall.

âI donât seem to be able to find Miss Barnhelm,â

Â
he announced rather impatiently. âYou didnât happen
to notice what became of her, did you?â

âShe went down the steps, I think,â replied Mr.
Bradley, âalthough it had grown so dark that I
couldnât be sure of it. Come on, Alice; we are late
now.â

They went into the dining-room, leaving Dick alone.
Mrs. Harlan and Bob found him there, quite out of
temper, when they appeared ready dressed for dinner.

âWhere the devil can Lola be?â he growled angrily.
âIt is almost eight oâclock.â

âWell, you may do as you please, my dear boy,â
said Mrs. Harlan firmly, âbut Iâm not going to wait.
How about you, Bob?â

âWell,â replied Bob very earnestly, âI would do
an awful lot for Lola; sheâs behaving splendidly, and
sheâs a big credit to the party to-day, but she couldnât
expect a fellow to take a chance of missing his dinner.â

âYou two go on in. Iâll find her.â Dick turned
and left them, going down the steps to the shore road
and glancing up and down, in the hope of seeing her.
He could make out a couple down by the water, their
figures looming dimly through the darkness; lovers

Â
probably, he thought; they seemed to be walking very
slowly and very near together, but he could see nothing
of the solitary form for which he was looking.
She was not in her room; he had made sure of that,
and as far as he could see in the dim light, this one
couple had the shore to themselves. He was conscious
of a feeling of envy; if only Lola and he could sometimes
do as these two were doing; forget everything
but one another; be together like that, alone. He
would be content if he was sure of her love; he, who
had asked much of women, would be satisfied with so
little, but Lola seemed to have no sentiment. Things
would be all right, of course, after they were married,
but now it was hard. They were coming toward him
slowly, those two, and as he stood there waiting he
watched them idly.

A man and a girl, of course; no two men or two
women ever walked like that. He laughed to himself
as he realized the sentimentality of his mood. The
man was very tall; even in the darkness one could tell
that he was young and strong. The girl was small,
delicate; something in her bearing reminded himââ
âBy God! It is Lola!â He started forward and met

Â
them at the foot of the steps just as they came out of
the shadow into the light thrown out by the bright
illumination of the veranda.

âLola!â He stood facing her angrily, glancing from
her to the young fellow at her side, a sun-burned, wind-tanned
young giant in loose flannels. âWhere have
you been?â

âWhy, I took a little walk, Dick,â she answered
calmly. âI met Mr. Blake, and he was good enough to
offer to stroll back with me. Mr. Blake is the life-guard
who fished me out of the water this afternoon.
This is Mr. Fenway, Mr. Blake.â

âOh!â Dick returned the young manâs bow rather
curtly. âI am glad of the chance of thanking you
again, Blake. I would have looked you up, of course,
in the morning. I was in my bathing suit at the time,
and when I got dressed you had gone off duty. Here.â
He had taken out his pocketbook as he spoke, and
now drew out a bill and held it out.

âI thank you very much, Mr. Fenway,â said the
young man with what seemed to Dick to be surprisingly
good manners for a fellow of his position, âbut
I canât take it. Miss Barnhelm had already rewarded

Â
me most liberally.â He raised his cap politely, and
with a brief good night stepped out of the circle of
light and was swallowed up in the darkness.

âWhat the devil are you laughing at, Lola?â demanded
Dick angrily. âDo you see anything especially
funny?â

âOh, no, dear; not at all,â she answered, âand I
think it would be a good thing if we were to go in to
dinner.â

Once in the dining-room, Lolaâs high spirits seemed
to desert her. She seemed languid and rather moody,
and in spite of Bobâs really eloquent description of
various dishes that he had stamped with the seal of
his approval, she refused to do more than nibble at a
crust of bread and drink a glass or two of champagne,
of which she had grown very fond.

After dinner they went out on the veranda and met
Mr. Bradley and Alice, and by them were introduced
to many of the guests of the hotel. Lola, who in spite
of her present bad temper was looking very well, soon
found herself the centre of a lively group. There was
no doubt at all of her success; she received the two
infallible proofsâadmiration from the men, envy

Â
from the women. She found herself seated next to the
sweet-faced old gentleman whom she had noticed at
the lunch table; he had his little granddaughter seated
on his knee, and a very small and very aristocratic
French poodle perched upon the arm of his chair.

Of all the group these two alone, the child and the
dog, refused to devote themselves to Lola; the child,
after one long look into her eyes, had thrown her arms
about the old manâs neck and hidden her face on his
shoulder; the dog had bared his little teeth in a snarl
at the first touch of her hand.

âQuiet, Tony,â reproved Mr. Miller sharply, as he
changed the dog to the other arm of his chair. âI
canât think why he should act so queerly, Miss Barnhelm,
nor you, either, Molly,â he said as he stroked the
childâs head lovingly. âYou are both tired out, I think,
and you must go to bed.â

âWill you come upstairs and hear me say my prayers
in a little while, grandfather?â asked little Molly in a
low voice. âNurse and mother are there, but I think
God can hear me better when you are with me.â

âI will come, of course, Molly.â He looked up at
Lola with a smile. âThis little girl is worried about

Â
her father, who is on the ocean, but I have told her
that God always considers the prayers of little girls
who pray for those they love.â

LOLA GOES TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT AT THE STEEL PIER.

âYou believe that?â questioned Lola with something
very like a sneer, âor do you think it is the proper
thing to tell a child?â

âI believe it,â said the old man gently, âor naturally
I would not teach it to this little girl. I have told her
that Godâs power is infinite, but that his purpose is not
always easy for us to understand. I know, however,
that such prayers as hers must do great good to her
and to him she prays for. Donât you?â

âNo,â replied Lola coldly, âI do not.â She resented
the look of cool inquiry in this manâs eye; he
was a famous writer, they had told her, an authority
on many subjects of which the very names were new
to her. Well, he could not study her, or if he tried
he would find that she was not the empty-headed
creature his rather amused look seemed to say he
thought her.

âI know nothing of the kind,â she went on calmly,
âand I am surprised that a man like you can believe
such worn-out old superstitions.â

Â
âThat need not surprise you, that we believe, this
child and I,â he said gently. âBelief is so very easy
to us. She is very young, and I am very old, and to
such belief comes naturally. It is, I think, because the
very young are fresh from Godâs presence and because
the very old are drawing nearer to it.â

He rose as he spoke and, taking the childâs hand,
bowed to Lola kindly and went into the hotel, the little
dog following them gravely.

âIâve had enough of this,â declared Lola, rising
angrily. âIâm bored to death! You people do as you
please; Iâm going to bed!â

Â

CHAPTER XVI

A SERIOUS LETTER

âThis
is my idea of the work Iâd like to do for
my living,â said Mrs. Harlan with a yawn,
as she tilted her sun-shade a little forward
and settled herself deeper in the soft sand. âAll I
need now to be perfectly happy is to have one of you
read to me until I fall asleep.â

âLola looks as though she could sleep without that,â
said Bob, glancing at her lazily. âYou went to bed
early enough last night; couldnât you get any rest?â

âI do feel a little tired,â answered Lola. âI slept
some, of course, but not for hours.â

âThatâs queer,â exclaimed Dick. âI knocked on
your door when I went upstairs about eleven, and you
didnât answer. If you were awake you must have
heard me. You didnât leave your room again, did
you?â

âWhy should I?â She sat up rather flushed, and

Â
turned to him angrily. âWhere would I have gone?
What are you talking about? Why do you always say
such absurd things?â

âCome now, Lola,â broke in Mrs. Harlan soothingly.
âDick hasnât said anything dreadful. Donât
be cross, please, and spoil a day like this.â

âNo, donât, for pity sake donât letâs have any rows,â
said Bob earnestly; ânothing in the world so bad for
my digestion.â

âAnyone would think you had something to hide,
by the way you are jumping on me,â complained Dick
resentfully. âI donât see any crime in asking you if
you had stepped out of your room for a minute.â

âI have told you that I did not.â

âYou might have run in to see Madge.â

âNo! No! No!â She spoke almost in a scream.
âHow many times do I have to repeat it? No! No!
No!â

âCome on, Madge; thatâs the three-alarm signal,â
exclaimed Bob, as he got to his feet heavily. âGreat
God, Lola,â he looked down at her, his fat, good-natured
face expressing his deep disgust, âwhy canât
you learn to keep your disposition in the ice chest?

Â
Youâre all right when you are all right, but youâre a
wonder at kicking up a row.â

âI guess Bobâs playing safe,â agreed Mrs. Harlan,
as she took his proffered hand and got to her feet.
âWeâll leave you two alone, as usual, to fight it out.
Come on, Bob; I may not be as great a social light as
Lola is getting lately, but Iâm perfectly willing to sit
in the sand and let you go to sleep.â

Lola made no effort to stop them, and they walked
on up the beach in search of peace and quiet, Mrs.
Harlan angry and disgusted, Bob deeply discouraged.

âThere,â exclaimed Dick. âYouâve driven them
away again!â

âWhat of it?â Lola looked at him coldly. âGo
with them if you want to!â

âI donât, but Bobâs getting tired of this sort of thing,
and heâs too good a fellow to be made uncomfortable
all the time.â

âHeâs a foolâa perfect fool; you know he is, Dick
Fenway. The only thing in the world that would
really please him would be to eat a good dinner in a
deaf and dumb asylum. Iâm tired to death of him and
of your Mrs. Harlan, too. Sheâs coarse, and low, and

Â
vulgar, and if you had any respect for me at all you
wouldnât force me to be with such a person!â

âBut, my dear girl, you know I canât help it!â

âWell, you ought to help it,â she replied cruelly.
âIt puts me in a false position, to be seen with a woman
of that sort. Everyone notices it. Mr. Bradley practically
said as much to me this morning.â

âAnd took time enough saying it, too,â said Dick
resentfully. âI thought the old man had tied himself
to your skirts for the day. You kept me waiting a
good half hour. What are you trying to jolly him
for; we donât want any of his money.â

She made no reply to this, but threw herself back
on the sand and, shading her face with her parasol,
deliberately closed her eyes.

âI say, Lola,â Dick remarked after a momentâs
pause; âif you donât care to make any more of an effort
than this to be sociable, I think Iâll leave you here
while I go back to the hotel; the mail is in by now, and
Iâm almost sure to get some news from Cleveland.â

âA very good idea,â she answered calmly. âIâll wait
right here until you return. You are so cross to-day
that I donât think you would be very good company.â

Â
He made no reply. âWhat was the use of starting
another battle?â he said to himself bitterly; âall that
I can do is to go away and come back when she isnât
so cranky.â

They parted like this, as men and women have
parted since first they came into the world. She, perfectly
serene, as sure of his return as she was of her
own unreasonableness. He, puzzled as to just what his
fault had been and not quite sure whether to be angry
with her or with himself. A man is always very sorry
for the thing he is quite innocent of having done; it
is only when he has really been at fault that he remains
calmly indifferent.

Lola was very comfortable; it was a warm day, but
there was a breeze from the water, and she lay there,
every muscle relaxed, shading her face with her parasol,
which she had dropped on the sand, looking dreamily
out to where a long line of black smoke on the
horizon marked the passing of some great steamer.

Somehow the thought of a ship at sea brought Dr.
Crossett to her mind. She often thought of him,
more often than of her father or of John. The Doctor
had loved her; she knew that; not as a father loves,

Â
through instinct, or as a lover, from desire, but because
he had put her in the place of the one woman who had
represented the idea of love in his life. He was a rich
man, Dr. Crossett; what fun they could have together
in Paris! If anything ever went wrong with her, she
was going to him; she had quite made up her mind to
that, but, after all, what could go wrong? Dick would
always give her what she wanted, and if not Dick,
there were plenty of others. The only trouble was
that if they had money they were either stupid, like
poor Dick or old, like Mr. Bradley; if they were strong
and handsome, like that splendid young life-guard,
they were hopelessly poor. On the whole, however,
she was satisfied with life. She had done well enough
so far, and she very strongly intended to do better.
She was very tired, very sleepy; the little waves breaking
over the smooth sand soothed her; the wind swept
softly over her like a caress; she laughed happily to
herself as she thought of Dickâs anger. How silly he
was. What would he do if he knew where she had
really been, as he stood outside her door, the night
before. How had she dared to do it? She blushed
red at the thoughts that came crowding into her head,

Â
and thrilling, trembling with a new knowledge of life,
she fell asleep.

She stirred uneasily after a time, and sitting up suddenly,
conscious as one sometimes is of being the object
of anotherâs thoughts, she met the eyes of Mr.
Miller, the old gentleman of the night before, fixed
earnestly upon her. âHow long had he stood there,
looking at her?â she thought angrily to herself. âHow
dared he smile at her like that, as though his wise old
eyes could read her mind.â

âI beg your pardon, Miss Barnhelm.â He spoke in
the gentle, kindly voice she had so resented the night
before. âI am afraid that I have disturbed you.â

âWhy were you looking at me?â she demanded
bluntly.

âIt was very rude, very unfair,â he admitted, âbut
you looked so comfortable and, if I may say so, so
absurdly young, that it did not at the time seem a serious
offence.â

âYou were studying me,â she exclaimed hotly, âtrying
to read my mind, as I lay here asleep. Using me
for a subject to dissect for one of your stupid books.
Wellâwhat have you discovered?â

Â
âNothing! You are so frank with me that I will be
honest in my turn. It is my habit to study those about
me. I am sorry; I hope you are fully aware that in
my interest there was nothing that could in any way
offend you.â

âYou mean, I suppose, that you would have looked
just as closely at a toad or a potato-bug! I am quite
aware of that. I am not even angry any more, only
curious. What can you tell me about myself?â

âNothing, my dear young lady, only that you have,
in common with the rest of the world, two natures,
warring against one another, in your heart. I will
confess that in your case I thought I saw a flash of
something deeper, more tragic, than one usually finds
in the face of a young girl, just a bad dream perhaps,
or perhaps a real trouble. If the last, I would gladly
do my best to help you.â

âWhy?â

âBecause I have worked very hard for fifty years,
and sometimes I am discouraged at the little real good
my knowledge has ever done. I have more than my
share of money, and time, and influence; any or all
of these are at your disposal.â

Â
âYou were a Professor, they told me, and a writer
of books?â

âYes. I am, if I am anything, a Psychologist.â

âMy father was that,â remarked Lola a trifle bitterly,
âalthough to me it was never anything but a
name.â

âIt is merely a name for a very simple thing: the
art of keeping oneâs eyes open. Psychology is the
study of mental phenomena; I believe that is as good
a definition as it is possible to give, and it means only
the study of our fellow creatures, in the hope that in
the end the psychologist may do for the mind what
the physician now does for the body.â

âAnd to do this, to learn this new trade of yours,
you hesitate no more about robbing me of my mind
and dissecting it than a country medical student would
hesitate to rob a grave.â

âNot any more certainly,â he replied, evidently still
much amused at her indignation, âbut as I have perceived
nothing but a well-deserved rebuke, perhaps
you will forgive me. I am on duty to-day, as you see;
after many years of careful study I am considered

Â
worthy of a very sacred trust. I am granted the privilege
of playing nurse to a child and a dog.â

He pointed along the beach to where his granddaughter
was playing with her absurd little poodle,
and as his eyes rested upon them his smile lost its
queer, impersonal look and became very commonplace
indeed, just the smile of a good man, whose heart
goes out in thankfulness to God for the joy of seeing a
little child of his own blood safe and well.

âYou are,â said Lola gravely, âthe very queerest
person I have ever met. If you are anxious to study
mental phenomena you might buy yourself a looking-glass.
I must confess that I canât understand you at
all.â

âSince we seem to have met upon a rather unusual
attitude of frankness,â he responded mildly, âI am
going to return the compliment. Our impressions
seem to have been identical.â He turned as if to
leave, but after a slight hesitation he faced her, and
said in a more serious tone, âMy offer of assistance
was sincere; should you be in need of anything that
is in my power to grant you, surely my age should
make it easy for you to come to me.â He bowed

Â
rather stiffly, like a man to whom social conventions
are a habit rather than a pleasure, and left her there,
sitting on the sand, looking after him a little anxiously.
âHe was a queer old man,â she thought;
âthere could be no doubt of that,â and she wondered
just what he had meant when he confessed that he
could not understand her. She watched him as he
joined the child, and until they and the little dog disappeared
together around a rocky point she sat there,
thinking of the strange look of speculation she had
seen on his face.

âMiss Barnhelm!â She looked up quickly at the
sound of the voice and saw the young life-guard
standing beside her.

âWhy did you follow me?â she demanded angrily.
âI might have known I couldnât trust you.â

âI saw that you were alone,â he stammered, very
much upset by her tone. âIâI had to see you.â

âWhy?â

âWhy!â He looked at her amazed. âWhy? Do
you think a man can forgetâjust in a few hoursâforget
you? I never knew that there were women like
you in the world. IâI wouldnât have dared to raise

Â
my eyes to youâbutâbut you came to meâyourself!â

âThe woman tempted me, and I did fall,â she
sneered. âI suppose that is what you mean?â

âI mean, Miss Barnhelm, that I love you! I am
not fool enough to dream that you could care enough
for a man like me to let me make any difference in
your life, but I canât let you go away from me like
this!â

âMy poor boy,â she spoke kindly, and looked at him
with something very like sadness in her eyes, âyou are
making a mistake. We met yesterday in your boat.
We walked together for a moment in the evening;
that is all.â

âAndâand last night?â

âWas a dream.â

âNo!â

âJust a dream, and dreams donât last. You must
go now, quickly, please, because I see Mr. Fenway
coming.â

âGo and leave you to him!â

âYes.â

He did not answer, but he had not the least idea of

Â
going; she saw that in the same glance that showed
her that Dick had seen them together and had quickened
his pace. She must not let these two men meet;
there was danger in that; this young man must be
made to go, and in less than a minute. She looked
up at him, flashing one look straight into his eyes.

âGo now,â she said, almost in a whisper, âand wait
for meâto-night.â

âI will.â As he spoke he turned and walked on up
the beach. She sighed as her eyes followed his free,
powerful movements and noticed his easy, graceful
figure and broad shoulders; then she turned to meet
Dick.

âThat was that Blake, the life-guard,â Dick spluttered,
his sallow face whiter than ever now with anger.
âYou must think Iâm a damned fool to stand for a
thing like this!â

âI think that you are forgetting, Dick, that you are
not speaking to one of your chorus-girl friends.â

âDo you? Well, let me tell you something; even
one of what you are pleased to call my chorus-girl
friends would have the decency to play the game
straight while she played it at all. Thereâs another

Â
name for a woman who takes one manâs money and
when his back is turned lets another fellowâââ

âYou would be wise to stop right there!â She
sprang up and faced him, white with rage, and with
a look that, angry as he was, he dared not face. âI
have taken your money; yes, this is not the first time
you have chosen to remind me of it, but it is the very
last. You wonât have another chance!  I wonât take
another dollar from you until we are married; after
that, if you ever dare to repeat a thing like that, I will
leave you! Now you go, get that divorce you talk so
much about before you let me see your face again, and
get it soon, if you expect me to wait for you!â

âLola, forgive me. IâI was wrong, but I am worried
sick, or I wouldnât have made such a fool of myself!
Donât be hard, Lola; Iâve troubles enough
without that. IâIâm in a devil of a mess.â

âWhat mess?â she questioned quickly. âMore
trouble with your father?â

âYes, another letter. Heâs sore because Iâve been
away from New York so long, neglecting my business,
he says, and spending too much money. He will come

Â
around all right; he always does, but to tell you the
truth he refused to send me the check I asked for.â

âHe never did that before, did he?â

âNo, but itâs sure to be all right. I sent him a âday
letter,â and heâll come around, but it rattled me, and my
lawyers wrote that my confounded wife sticks out for
fifty thousand!â

âWell?â

âI wired them to offer forty cash. I know the old
man will pay that. Heâs tired of having her around
Cleveland, calling herself Mrs. Fenway. Forty thousand
is an awful hold-up, but I canât wait. The whole
thing may be settled to-day.â

âIf your father, who has refused you ten thousand,
agrees to give you fifty, and if this woman, who has
stood out for fifty thousand, agrees to take forty, if
all this happens you will be a free man, but these
things have not happened yet, and if they do you will
have to prove to me that there will be no more of this
talk about the money you have spent on me, and the
obligation I am supposed to be under to you, before
I will agree to tie myself to you. Favors! Look at
me! If I am not worth the few thousand I have cost

Â
you, go back to Broadway; you can buy more for your
money there!â

âDonât, Lola. Donât talk that way! I never thought
a thing like that. I donât deserve to have to hear you
say it. When have I denied you anything, when have
I asked anything in return, but just that you would
care for me? I was wrong to lose my head, of course;
you canât help it if that cad of a life-guard has the
nerve to hang around you. Canât you let it go at
that? Canât you see that I am worried enough, without
your turning against me?â

âI see,â she answered coldly, âthat Bob and Mrs.
Harlan are coming, and it is hardly necessary to take
them into our confidence. Mrs. Harlan has quite
enough knowledge of our affairs; I think it is about
time we saw the last of her. If you had less to do with
women of that class, you might be able to remember
that you canât talk to me as though I were one of
them.â

Mrs. Harlan, as they all walked back to the hotel
together, could not make up her mind as to just how
matters stood. Dick was nervous, that was plain
enough, but Lolaâs mood puzzled her; she was very

Â
quiet, very thoughtful, and from time to time, when
she looked at Dick, she seemed to be trying to make
up her mind.

âI donât like it,â Mrs. Harlan confided to Bob as
they followed the others up the beach. âSheâs up to
something, or I miss my guess. Sheâs dangerous
enough when sheâs in one of her tantrums, but when
sheâs quiet, like she is nowâlook out. What do you
suppose is the matter with her now?â

âI donât know,â replied Bob thoughtfully, âunless
sheâs hungry.â

This could hardly have been the explanation, however,
for she refused to go in to lunch with the others,
and sat at the far end of the veranda, still seemingly
in deep thought, until, hearing some one approaching,
she looked up and saw Mr. Bradley.

Her smile, as she welcomed him, however, had no
trace of anything but girlish pleasure, and shrewd as
he was, he could not but be flattered by the soft blush
on her cheek, and the gladness in her eyes, as she rose
to meet him.

âMiss Barnhelm,â he began quickly, âI am anxious
to speak with you, in confidence, before your

Â
friends or my daughter come from the dining-room.â

âYes, Mr. Bradley.â

âI have a letter here.â As he spoke he drew the letter
from his pocket. âI have decided to let you read
it, although, as you will see, it is a breach of confidence
on my part to do so. It is from Cleveland, from Dick
Fenwayâs father; it may perhaps offend you, but it
may be a big help for you to know just how things
stand. Here it is.â

Lola took the letter calmly enough, and read it
through without a word. It was dated from Cleveland
two days before, and read as follows:

âMy Dear Bradley:

âMy son Dick has wired me to address him at the
Hotel where you and Alice are staying. I am worried
about the boy and want you to do me a favor. He
has always been a great trouble to me, as you know,
but he is all I have, and I am fool enough to love him.
Will you have a talk with him, and tell him for me
that he has come to the end of his rope. He has a wife
whom I am willing to buy off on one condition. He
is to return to New York at once and go to work, and

Â

he is to convince you, as my agent, that from now on
he gives up, absolutely and forever, any connection
or acquaintance with a girl by the name of Lola Barnhelm,
with whom he has been travelling for the last
six weeks. Tell him that my information as to this
young woman is complete. I have had them followed,
and am in receipt of a daily report as to their
movements. The efforts he has been making to secure
a speedy divorce seem to point to an intention on
his part to marry this person. If he does, please make
it plain to him that he will support her himself, without
help from me. Try to make him understand that
I am not quite the fool he thinks me. I donât like
what I have heard about this Barnhelm girl, and I am
serious when I say that if he marries her he will not
support her on the money I have earned by hard work.
You may be able to make him see his real position.
Thank you in advance, old friend, for the help I know
you will not refuse me. Give my love to your daughter.
What a happy man I would be if my boy had
brains enough to love a girl like her, and character
enough to be worthy of her love.

âYours always,

âRichard Fenway.â

Â
Lola finished the letter and, folding it carefully,
handed it back to him.

âWell?â she inquired calmly.

âIâI thought,â he answered, very much embarrassed,
âthat you would want to know how you
stood.â

âYes, I am very much obliged, but I am afraid I
donât. Are you acting now as Mr. Fenwayâs agent,
or as my friend?â

âAs your friend,â he replied earnestly.

âDo you believe the insinuations this man has dared
to make? That I am not a proper wife for his son?â

âWell, IâIâonly want you to know that if you
marry the boy, his father will not give him another
dollar.â

âDo you believe what he believes of me?â

âI think that you are too pretty toâââ

âDo you believe these things?â

âWhat were you doing out of the hotel until three
oâclock this morning?â

âIâIâââ

âI could not sleep, because I was thinking of you!
I was at my window, and I saw you when you returned,

Â
and I saw the young fellow who left you at
the steps.â

âOh!â She looked at him for a moment; then a
slow smile formed itself on her lips. âThen you, I
suppose, do not care to count yourself any longer as
my friend?â

âWhy not?â He looked at her with a new boldness.
âI am a man of the world. Dick canât do anything
more for you, but is there any reason why you and I
should not be good friends?â

âI think you are making a mistake,â she answered
quietly. âDick fully intends to marry me. I am not
the sort of girl you seem to think.â

âAnd last night?â

âWas my own affair.â

âVery well,â he rose reluctantly, âI suppose there
isnât anything more to say. So you will marry Dick?â

âYes.â

âAnd starve with him?â

âPerhaps.â

âI canât figure this out.â He looked at her, doing
his best to read her real intentions in her face. âYou
canât love him, or why this other fellow? I suppose

Â
you count on his fatherâs forgiveness, but that, if it
comes at all, wonât come for years. You canât wait
years; donât you see that? Your youth is your capital;
you would be a fool to squander it, and you donât look
to me like a fool.â

âNo, I am not a fool,â she said quietly. âI have
certain plans, certain intentions, that mean everything
to me. Dick, nor his father, nor you canât come between
me and the life I want. You might help me,
any one of you, but you canât hold me back. I should
like to tell you just what it is I do want, but not here,
not now. Are you afraid to trust yourself alone with
me?â

âAre you laughing at me?â

âPerhaps.â

âWhat is it that you want me to do?â

âMeet me in half an hour on the shore road, just
above the place where we met yesterday; do you remember?â

âYes.â

âGet out of your head, before you meet me, the
thought that I am the sort of woman who can be
bought by any man. Until last night no man, in all

Â
my life, ever had the right to say that he had been
anything to me. Do you believe that?â

âYes. I canât doubt it, when you look at me as you
look now.â

âAnd you will be there, in half an hour?â

âYes. Your friends are coming. I will go now; I
will be waiting for you.â

He passed Dick, and Bob, and Mrs. Harlan, and as
he was about to descend the steps to the road, his
daughterâs voice stopped him.

âFather.â Alice stepped out of the house with a
letter in her hand. âLook! Here is a letter from
Aunt Helen; she is coming on the late train to-night.â

âThatâs fine,â he answered heartily. âI am delighted!
Good-bye, dear; Iâm off for a little walk. I
wonât be long.â

âTake care of yourself,â she called after him gayly,
âand donât be late.â She turned away, joining Mr.
Miller and Molly, and they all walked along the
veranda, followed by the little dog, until they stopped
at the group that now were gathered about Lola. Mr.
Miller noticed, as he took the chair one of the young
men offered him, that Lola was not making more than

Â
a half-hearted effort to join in the general conversation,
and he was watching the unmistakable signs of
repressed emotion on her sensitive face, when she
looked up and saw him. He expected to see a blaze of
anger in her eyes, but for some reason she seemed
anxious to avoid his scrutiny, and bent over, rather
obviously to escape his glance, and patted the little
dog, who was sitting sedately beside his mistress, only
a foot or two away. At the first touch of her hand
the tiny creature gave a snarl and, turning, buried his
little teeth in her wrist. Molly cried out and sprang
forward, but Lola threw her aside and, catching up a
tennis racquet from the arm of one of the chairs,
struck the dog with all her strength. Molly screamed
as she saw the little figure fall back motionless, and
all the others rose quickly and stepped forward with
cries of indignation, but Lola did not hear them;
again and again she struck, although her first blow had
done its work; and as she struck she screamed, like
the snarling scream of an angry wolf; for a moment
no one moved, but at last Bob threw her aside as he
would have thrown a man, and Molly dropped down,
sobbing bitterly by the side of her little friend. No

Â
one spoke; Lola shuddered and, turning her head,
looked about her from one to another. No eyes met
hers; they all stood there, sick with horror. After a
moment of silence, broken only by the sobbing of the
child, she gave a short, contemptuous laugh and, dropping
the blood-stained racquet, walked down the
veranda to the door.

Â

CHAPTER XVII

FENWAY'S DIVORCE GRANTED

âOne
moment, Miss Barnhelm!â Lola turned
as she was about to enter the hotel, and
found herself facing Alice Bradley, who had
left the little group about Molly and had followed her.

âWell? What do you want?â

âYou brute! You beast!â Alice cried out, tears of
pity and anger running down her cheeks. âHow
could you! Youâyou are not a woman; you are an
animal!â

âIf I were you, Miss Bradley, I should be careful
what I said. As, perhaps you saw, I am not in a patient
mood.â Lola spoke quietly, but if Alice had not
been carried away by her indignation she would hardly
have dared to face the look in her eyes. âThat dog
hurt me; look; my wrist is bleeding. It hurt me, I
tell you, and I canât bear pain! I wonât bear it! I
had a right to defend myself.â

âDefend yourself,â exclaimed Alice contemptuously,

Â
âagainst a poor, helpless little creature no larger
than a kitten! You should be driven away from this
hotel; you shall be, if I have anything to say about it!
In fact you must leave here at once, or I shall go myself!
That is what I am going to tell my father as
soon as I see him.â

âAnd when do you expect to see him?â

âAs soon as he returns.â

âReally? Not until then? Do you know that I
feel quite sorry for you, Miss Bradley?â

She entered the hotel and went at once to her room,
and when Dick knocked at her door a few moments
later she refused to open it, telling him to wait for
her on the front veranda.

Dick returned reluctantly to his friends; for once he
agreed with them. Lolaâs brutality was beyond all excuse.
He was a kind-hearted fellow, and the sight of
the little girlâs sorrow over the death of her favorite
had moved him deeply. He found it hard to forgive
Lola; he had made excuses for her times enough, but
there had been something in the horror of this last
scene difficult to forget. He found Bob and Mrs.
Harlan waiting on the veranda, and he knew by the

Â
way they looked at him that they had made up their
minds to some definite action.

âDick,â said Mrs. Harlan, as soon as he was within
hearing, âweâve had enough, Bob and I; weâre
through!â

âNow, Madgeâââ he began soothingly.

âNo, Dick, we like you, but weâve had enough. We
are going to New York to-night. You canât say we
havenât stood for a lot, but this thing has made me
sick. The girl is crazy, or worse, and lifeâs too short
to take a chance on what sheâll do next.â

âYou are going to leave me?â

âYes.â

âHow about it, Bob?â

âWell, Dick, Iâm no quitter, but for me itâs âgoodnight,
nurse.ââ

âItâs no business of mine, I suppose, Dick,â Mrs.
Harlan said, after a moment of awkward silence, âbut
weâve been rather good friends for a long time. I wish
youâd come with us.â

âAnd leave Lola?â

âBeat her to it; sheâll leave you, if you donât.â

âIâI love her, Madge.â

Â
âI knowâwell, good-bye, Dick; Iâm going to pack.â

âGood-bye, Madge; Iâll see you again before you
go.â

Mrs. Harlan left them quickly; she knew that she
was going to cry in another minute. She was quite
aware that no woman of her age could afford to be
seen in tears, and Bob had a particular hatred for anything
of the sort. She went to her room and did her
packing, then decided to go and offer to help Bob with
his things.

As she went down the hall she noticed that the door
of Lolaâs room was open, and as she glanced in quickly
she saw with surprise that Lolaâs trunks were locked
and that the room was empty. She entered quickly
and looked about; Lola had gone; she saw that at a
glance. Her hand-bag was missing, her toilet articles
put away; nothing was in sight but the two locked
trunks. She had bolted. âA good thing, too,â she
thought bitterly to herself, but she knew that she must
hurry and let Dick know.

She found the two men where she had left them
over an hour before; they were seated silently looking

Â
out at the water, and they did not even look up as
she stopped beside them.

âDick,â she spoke gently, resting her hand for a moment
on his shoulder, âdo you know where Lola is?â

âIn her room. She told me to wait for her here.â

âSheâs gone, Dick.â

âWhat!â

âGone! Youâd better ask them at the desk, but her
trunks are locked; thereâs no doubt about it; she has
gone.â

âWhere could she go? What are you talking
about?â

âHush,â she said quickly. âHere is Miss Bradley.
You donât want her to know.â

Alice Bradley stopped before them, an open letter
in one hand, a bank check in the other. She was very
pale and looked frightened.

âMr. Fenway, they tell me at the office that Miss
Barnhelm left the hotel over an hour ago. Do you
know where she has gone?â

âWhy do you ask?â demanded Mrs. Harlan, with
a sudden flash of understanding.

âSee!â Alice held out the check and the letter.

Â
âMy father has left me! This letter was brought by
a messenger. He says he was called away on business,
and for me to remain here with my aunt, who
arrives to-night. That woman has taken him away
from me! My fatherâwho has always been so good
to meâtaken him away from me; do you hear?â

âTelegram for you, Mr. Fenway.â A bell-boy
came up to Dick, holding out a telegram. âJust came,
sir.â

âItâs all right!â Dick sprang up and, seeing the envelope,
tore it open. âShe wouldnât leave me without
a word! I knew she wouldnât. She has gone, yes,
but sheâs wired me where to join her!â He opened
the message and read it at a glance, then without a
word, but with a look on his face that brought the
tears to soft-hearted Mrs. Harlanâs eyes, he handed
her the message and turned and left them. She read
it aloud. It was from his lawyer in Cleveland, and
read, âDivorce arranged. Congratulations.â

Â

CHAPTER XVIII

ONCE MORE IN NEW YORK

Dr. Crossett
was finding it a difficult matter
to keep from falling to sleep. The dinner
had been stupid, even for a formal affair
of this sort, where one scarcely expects to be entertained.
He had worked hard all day at the hospital,
and after making a brief speech introducing the guest
of honor of the evening, he sat with his chair pushed
back from the disordered dinner table and resigned
himself to his fate. A man could hardly be talked to
death in two hours, he thought, and after all there
was hope; perhaps the half hour of informal conversation
that always followed the speech-making
might be less deadly than usual. What a fool he was
to give his time to these riots of platitude; he swore
softly to himself as he looked through the haze of tobacco
smoke at the faces of many of the foremost
medical and psychological authorities of France, and,
as he always did upon occasions of this kind, laid

Â
elaborate plans for immediately resigning from the
society. He had in fact almost finished a mental draft
of his letter of resignation, when the sound of a hundred
voices blending into a confused babel of conversation
warned him that the formal speech-making was
over.

âThank God for that,â he exclaimed in English,
turning to his right-hand neighbor, an American
psychologist named Miller, whom he had met for the
first time that evening.

âYou were not especially entertained?â questioned
that gentleman, with a smile. âAnd yet we have listened
to several rather deep and weighty opinions.â

âWeighty, I grant you,â replied the Doctor.
âHeavy possibly would have been a better word. Why
is it that a man, who in himself is both wise and entertaining,
always becomes both a pedant and a bore
when he makes an after-dinner speech?â

âThe effort to dominate too many, and too varied an
assortment of minds, no doubt, a species of self-hypnotism;
but Professor Carneyâs remarks on the distinction
between insanity and moral depravity were interesting.
I have just arrived from America, and it

Â
is possible that the ideas he advanced, although fresh
to me, may be an old story to you.â

âWe have worked much together, Carney and I,â
replied the Doctor. âHe knows the subject well
enough, although we do not agree in all things. He,
for instance, classes many cases as insanity, which
to me are plainly a lack of moral, not of mental,
strength. He denies the existence of an absolutely
unmoral person whose mind is sound and whose power
of reasoning is normal. To him such a case does not
exist.â

âI wonder what he would have thought of a case I
had an opportunity of observing a few weeks ago,â
remarked Mr. Miller. âThere he could find no trace
of insanity, no lack of logic, or of reason, but an absolute
absence of any moral sense. I think I have
never seen a more perfect example of the thing he denies.
Here was a young woman, beautiful, delicate
of body, refined, of good manners, and moderately
educated, to whom no law of man or of society was
sacred, who denied the power of God as lightly as
she defied the opinion of the world; who knew nothing
of shame, of duty, or of kindness, and whose mind

Â
was as clear as yours or mine, and whose mental
process was absolutely regular.â

âTell me of her,â said Dr. Crossett eagerly. âI
have several times found cases that at first seemed to
be as lacking in moral sense as this one you describe,
but always on close study I have found some promptings
of the softer impulses. I, for instance, have seen
a thief who robbed the poor-box of a church share
his booty to feed a hungry child whom he met casually
upon the street. I have seen a burly brute, who a
few hours before had murdered his wife, weep over
the sufferings of an injured dog. Here there was not
an absolute lack of the thing we perhaps might call
soul, although that examples of total and absolute
depravity exist among the sane is a favorite theory of
mine. Tell me of this woman!â

âShe was a woman, although she looked to be little
more than a child,â began Mr. Miller. âIt was at
Narragansett Pier, a summer resort, not far from
New York. I had noticed her from the first, my attention
being attracted by the curious fact that, in
spite of her gracious and happy manner, both my
grandchild and her little dog seemed to be overcome

Â
by a queer aversion from the moment when they first
came near to her.â

âAh! You believe thenâââ

âOnly that instinct warned them that this woman
was not a friend. I, myself, in spite of my age, felt a
marked attraction, as all men did. The appeal of sex
in this woman was overpowering, although I looked
in vain for the evidences of a passionate nature; physically
she was normal, a slight valvular trouble of the
heart I fancy, from what I heard, but nothing more.
She had left a good home to travel about with a rather
dissipated party, all of whom were of much coarser
fibre than herself. I later had a long conversation
with the young man, who had spent in a few weeks a
small fortune upon her. He loved her in his way.
She traded upon his love, but I am convinced that she
never rewarded it. I happened to come upon her one
day as she lay asleep on the sand; her face was like
a mirror, reflecting the thoughts that were running
through her mind. At first I saw a fierce sexual passion
that frightened me; then as that passed another
nature seemed to claim her, and her look became so
pure, so innocent, that I found myself instinctively

Â
raising my hat and standing bareheaded in the sun.
Wave after wave of feeling passed over her sensitive
features, good following bad, purity following lust,
the innocence of a child following the look seen only
on the face of one to whom all innocence is a thing
to laugh at. Doctor, I saw on that girlâs face what
one might almost call a struggle between good impulses,
inherited perhaps from a pure mother, nurtured
no doubt in an honest home, and the evil of a
nature in which, when she was conscious, there was
no spark of decency or honor left. It was like looking
on at the struggles of a divided soul, and slowly
seeing the defeat of the good, the triumph of the evil.â

âThis is indeed a terrible case,â exclaimed Dr. Crossett.
âWhat was the end?â

âWhat the real end will be one can only guess,â replied
Mr. Miller. âThe end, so far as this episode
of her life is concerned, began by a brutal killing of
my little granddaughterâs dog, quite the most dreadful
scene I ever witnessed, and ended by her leaving the
hotel in the company of a man, who for her sake forgot
the daughter whom he loved with a most unusual
affection and, blinded by the power of this creatureâs

Â
animal sex appeal, made himself a laughing stock to
his acquaintances and a sorrow to his friends. The
father disgraced in his old age, the dupe of this girl
who was but little older than the daughter he left
ashamed and heart-broken. Two men, one a young
life-guard, the other the fellow with whom she left
her home, each of them she left with good cause to remember
her, and left with a poorer opinion of the
world and a bitterness against all women that will
in the end help on the evil she created in their hearts.
To my little grandchild she brought her first knowledge
of the wickedness of the world. To all whom she met
she brought a sorrow; upon all whom she left she left
a trace of her own unworthiness.â

âThis is horrible, Mr. Miller,â exclaimed Dr. Crossett.
âWho was this woman?â

âHer name,â replied Mr. Miller, âwas Lola Barnhelm!
Doctor!â He sprang to his feet as he saw the
look on Dr. Crossettâs face. âDoctor!â

âAll right, sir, IâI beg your pardon.â

Dr. Crossett slowly poured himself a glass of brandy
from the small decanter on the table and raised it to
his lips with a hand that trembled visibly. âIâI am

Â
not quite myself to-night, sir,â he continued; âI am
going to ask you to excuse me. Gentlemen.â He
rose, a little unsteadily, and stood looking about him
at the smiling faces that turned to him. âGentlemen,â
he repeated, âI find that I must leave you. Will you
pardon my lack of formality and allow me to say good
night?â

He left the room, refusing the many anxious offers
of company, for he was a rarely popular man, and
there was something in the gray pallor of his face that
told them that he was suffering, and jumping into a
cab he gave the address of his apartment. During
his long drive across Paris, for he lived at the further
end of the Boulevard St. Germain, he sat motionless,
struck dumb with the horror of the thing he had heard.

âLola! Lola! Her mother.â He could see them
both until the tears blinded his eyes. âThat she should
come to this. Lola, to her child, the child that might
have been his! Great God!â As he unlocked the door
of his private hall his man came out to meet him.

âA letter, Doctor, marked important.â

âVery well, Louis; you need not wait.â

He went slowly into his study, and was about to

Â
drop the letter carelessly on the table as the New York
post-mark caught his eye. He looked again; the envelope
was addressed in what looked like a childâs
unformed handwriting. He opened it.

ââMy dear doctor,ââ he read, ââif you love the
doctor like I think you love him, come; he needs you.
He is sick, and he looks like he wanted to die. There
ainât nobody else. Please come. Excuse spelling and
things and come; we need you.
Maria.ââ

He caught the next steamer from Liverpool.

Â

CHAPTER XIX

WILL POWER

The
old man sat in the same shabby chair, in
the same little Eighth Avenue apartment
where he had lived ten months before. He
was dreaming again, although his eyes were open,
and his dreams were not the old dreams of happy confidence.

He looked to be a broken man as he sat there, his
mind and body both inert, in a half trance, half doze.
On the table beside him still stood his electric apparatus,
and on the mantel the little Dutch clock still
ticked away soberly.

Men are born and die. Hearts are made glad and
hearts are broken, fame comes and disgrace, but time
goes on, unfaltering. Ten thousand years ago men
fought for their brief moment of life, just as they fight
to-day, just as they must ten thousand years from
now; the joys that mean so much to us, the griefs that

Â
seem to fill the universe with sorrow blend in that endless
procession of to-morrows into one little grain of
the worldâs experience.

Through the open window the harsh music of a
street piano penetrated discordantly, and Maria, who
was quietly working about the dining-room, looked up.

âBother the old thing! They always make him
nervous!â She crossed the room and closed the window,
moving so as not to disturb the old man. The
music came fainter now, and the time changed abruptly
to a waltz; the swing of it got into her head, and because
she was young, and full of life and joy, she forgot
for a moment the silent, grief-stricken figure so
near to her, and she waltzed back to the dining-room,
humming to herself. It was a fine thing to be alive,
she thought, and to be of real use to this lonely man;
he had done much for her, but now she felt that she
was paying some of her debt to him of gratitude.
Without her what would become of him? He was as
helpless as a child and without a childâs real desire to
live. She busily arranged some slices of bread and
butter on a plate, and placing it on a tray with a pot of
freshly made tea, she put it down on the dining-room

Â
table, and stepping into the front room, stood by the
Doctorâs chair.

âYour tea is ready, Doctor.â

âOh!â He looked up at her, then made an effort,
and aroused himself to answer. âThank you, Maria,
but I do not care for any lunch to-day.â

âYou didnât eat nothinâ for your breakfast.â

âOh, yes, I did, Maria.â He smiled at her very
gently. âI am much stronger and in better health than
you will believe. I am not living an active life just
now. I do not require the same amount of food as
a young thing like you.â

âYou are sick, Doctor,â she spoke anxiously. âYou
canât live like you have been living for the last six
months, doing nothing and eating less. Youâll be on
your back the first thing I know; then how will I take
care of you?â

âYou are a good girl, Maria, but I am quite equal
to my work. I only wish that I had more to do.â

âYou canât get patients sittinâ here, dreaminâ over
that darned thing!â She pointed angrily at the electrical
machine on the table. âYou could have all the

Â
patients you could take care of if youâd only try to get
âem. There ainât a better doctor in the world.â

âYou are a very loyal little thing, Maria.â

âNo, I ainât. Iâve done somethinâ I hadnât no right
to do. Iâm going to tell yer because Iâm ashamed, but
Iâm mighty glad I did it just the same.â

âWhat have you done?â He spoke quickly, seeing
by her manner that she had something of more than
usual importance on her mind.

âI wrote a letter,â she answered defiantly, âmost
three weeks ago, the very first letter I ever wrote in
my life.â

âTo your sweetheart?â

âNo, I ainât countinâ him. Iâve been writinâ to him
a long time; he says one kind of spelling is just as
good to him as another, but this letter I wrote toâtoâParisâto
Dr. Paul Crossett.â

It was out now, and she was afraid to look at him.
In spite of the dependence he had grown to have upon
her, she was still very much in awe of him, and she
dreaded to hear the reproach that she knew would be
in his voice.

âMaria!â It was there, he was angry. She knew

Â
that he would be, but she also knew that it had been
her duty to do what she had done. âYouâMariaâyou
would not tell himââ?â

âI told him everything!â She burst out, âI told
him you was just killinâ yourself, sittinâ here, anâ
thinkinâ, anâ breakinâ your heart. All day anâ all night.
I told him that the best man I ever knew was just letting
himself fade out and die. And I told him that
if he was the friend I thought he was heâd come here
and do something.â

âMaria!â He spoke sternly now. âYou had no
right.â

âI know it.â

âI am very angry with you. IâI wish that you
had told me of it.â

âYou would have stopped me, wouldnât you?â

âYes.â

âThatâs why I didnât. I wouldnât have told you
now, only I knew youâd find it out. Iâm expecting him
every minute.â

âHe is coming here.â The Doctor rose to his feet
in his excitement.

âYes. I got a cable from him. It came over a

Â
week ago. It most scared me to death when I got it.
Itâs the first one I ever saw.â

âHe is coming?â

âTo-day, the cable said.â

âYou brought one of the busiest men in Europe
away from his work for me. You had no right to
do it.â

âPerhaps not.â She stood there, afraid of him, but
obstinately glad of the thing she had done. âAll I
know is mindinâ my own business, and itâs my business
to take care of you the best I can. Thereâthere ainât
nobody else to do it now. Itâs only what sheâd have
done herself if sheâd been here.â

It was the first time since Lola had left them that
she had spoken her name or made any allusion to her,
and he shrank away from it now pitifully.

âPlease!â He turned away from her, seating himself
heavily in his chair.

âItâs only what Miss Lola would have done,â she
continued firmly.

âI told you not to speak her name.â

âI know that you did, the very day after she left
home. You told me to think of her as if she was dead,

Â
but she ainât dead. Sheâs out there in the world somewhere,
and some day sheâs coming back!â

âNo! No!â

âYes, she is, and when she comes sheâll find everything
ready for her. Sheâll find her room just like
it always was, and sheâll find me just like I always was,
lovinâ her. I canât forget what she used to be to me.
I donât care what sheâs done!â

She had tried a hundred times in the last months
to say this or something like this, but she had never
been able to gather enough courage, and now, no matter
what came of it, she was going to speak. He tried
to stop her, but the great love she had in her heart
was stronger than her fear of him, and she went on.

âSometimes, Doctor, I think, because all day long,
every day, Iâve been thinkinâ, and sometimes it seems
to me that just those last few weeks, before she went
away, that she wasnât well some way, that somehow
she couldnât help doinâ what she did. Maybe there
was something that you and me donât understand,
that was too strong for her to fight. Canât you look
at it like that? Canât you get to think of her like you
would of a child that didnât know no better?â

Â
For a moment the doctor looked up into her flushed,
earnest face, then slowly dropped his head on his
arms, and leaning forward on the table he began to sob
like a child.

âOh, Doctor! Donât! Donât, Doctor!â

She tried to soothe him, as gently as a mother might
have done, and with much the same feeling in her
heart. She was not afraid of him now, but she longed
to comfort him.

âPlease, Doctor! Donât! I wonât say any more.
Only donât do that. Wonât you try not to be so unhappy?â

As she spoke the bell rang, and she straightened up.

âHush! Thereâs someone here. Are you all right,
Doctor? Shall I let âem in?â

âYes, Maria.â He recovered himself quickly, for
he was a proud man, and as Maria went slowly to the
door he wiped his eyes and straightened himself in his
chair.

âCan we be coming in?â

He looked up to see Mrs. Mooney and Nellie in the
doorway, smiling at him. Nellie was a different girl
now. If Dr. Crossett had done nothing else in his

Â
busy life, what he had done for this child would have
been a monument to his skill. Her arm was well, there
was a soft color on her cheeks, and her face was bright
with health and happiness.

âCome in!â He answered heartily, and as he looked
at her he exclaimed gladly, âWhy, Nellie, how well
you are looking. Better every day!â

âShe is that, Doctor. Better and happier,â said
Mrs. Mooney proudly. âSheâs just as good as any of
âem now.â

âPlease, Doctor,â said Nellie timidly, as she held
out to him a bunch of simple flowers, âwill you please
take these? I bought them with my first weekâs pay,
part of it. Iâm working now. Will you take them?â

âThank you, Nellie.â He took them from her with
a smile. âThey are a very satisfactory payment for
anything I ever did for you.â

âShe thought youâd know what she was feeling,
Doctor,â interrupted Mrs. Mooney. âWe canât ever
pay, but we canât either of us ever forget.â

âYou owe far more to Dr. Crossett than you do to
me. It was his treatment that gave us our start.â

A shrill whistle from the old-fashioned speaking

Â
tube broke in upon her before she could express anymore
of her gratitude of which she was so full, and
as Maria went to the tube to answer they all turned
to watch her.

âHello! Oh! Oh! Come up!â

Maria turned to them, greatly excited. âItâs him.
Itâs Dr. Crossett.â

âDr. Crossett!â Mrs. Mooneyâs face beamed with
surprise and pleasure. âWe can thank him, too, Nellie.â

âYou can run along out in the kitchen, both of
you; thatâs what you can do,â replied Maria firmly.
âYou can see him afterwards for a minute, but we
donât want you here now.â

âYou must not go, Mrs. Mooney,â said Dr. Barnhelm
kindly; âthe doctor will be glad to see Nellie.â

âYes, sir. Sheâll be showing him how strong she
is. Why, it will be hard for him to believe it, sir. She
can lift most as much as I can. Heâll be glad to know
that he was right. He said sheâd be as good as any of
âem.â

She followed Nellie to the kitchen, quite the happiest
woman in the world; even there in that room she

Â
seemed to have left some trace of her happiness behind
her, for as Maria looked at the Doctorâs face
she thought she saw a softer, less heart-broken look in
his eyes, and she turned away hopefully to open the
door for Dr. Crossett. Surely, she thought, there
must be a chance of his doing something to help his
friend, or would he, too, feel that she had done wrong
in sending for him? That thought made her pause,
afraid, but the thought went out of her mind at the
first sight of his smiling, kindly face.

âWell, Maria?â He took her hand warmly, but
there was an anxious question in his tone.

âHere he is, Doctor.â She showed him into the
room where Dr. Barnhelm was standing waiting to
greet him.

âMartin!â

The two men clasped hands warmly. Dr. Barnhelm
was greatly affected, but knowing how gladly his
friend had made any sacrifice that had been necessary
to hurry to him, he tried to say as little as possible.

âIt is all wrong, Paul. You should not have left
your work.â

Â
âLa! I needed a change; the sea air has made me
young again. Nowâyou?â

âIâI am well.â

âSo? You do not look it.â He turned gravely to
Maria. âYou have done well. He needed me.â

âYes, sir.â She was content. She knew now how
great a liberty she had taken, but he had told her that
she had done well, and she was happy. She smiled
at him through her tears as she turned to go, but his
voice stopped her.

âMaria!â

âYes, Doctor.â

âThere was a sweetheart, eh?â

âWhyâyes, sir.â

âStill the faithful sailor?â

âMr. Barnes, sir.â

âThis is for a wedding gift.â

She took a small package from him, and opening it,
stood open-mouthed before a pretty little necklace of
French beads.

âOh, Doctor! Oh! I never saw nothing so grand!â

âYou are a good girl, Maria, and this Mr. Barnes is
a lucky man.â

Â
âThank you, sir,â and she went quietly out of the
room, leaving the two men together.

âNow, Martin!â He turned to Dr. Barnhelm
gravely. âLet us have it out.â He seated himself
beside him and looked him squarely in the face. âYou
do not try to live? Eh?â

âAt least I have not tried to die.â

âWhere is she?â

âI do not know.â

âWhen I left you, you had not tried to know. Have
you seen her?â

âNo.â

âHave you made any effort to see her?â

âNo.â

âHave you heard of her?â

âYes.â

âHave you written?â

âOnce.â

âAnd that once? What did you say?â

âI wrote her,â answered Dr. Barnhelm slowly, âthat
I was coming back here to live, and that if she ever
needed a roof to shelter her, that sheâshe could
come.â

Â
âAnd in that letter,â Dr. Crossett went on relentlessly,
âdid you say, âYou are my daughter; I love
youâ?â

âNo.â

âDo you want her to come back?â

âNo.â

âMartin! Think of what that means.â

âWhat else have I done for six months, but think?â

âVery well.â Dr. Crossett gave up in despair.
âWe will say no more about it. You are a sick man,
mind and body; that is all that we must think of now.
Do you practice?â

âYes, not much, just enough to live.â

âAnd that?â Dr. Crossett pointed to the machine
on the table. âWhat have you done with that?â

âNothing!â

âAnd yet you told me once that it was the thing you
prayed for.â

âI was a fool!â Dr. Barnhelm spoke with a bitterness
that until long afterwards his friend could not
understand. âI thought myself something of a
philosopher, and yet I did not know that there is no
curse so bitter as the curse of a granted prayer. It is

Â
always so; a young man prays for fame, and when it
comes he finds that it is an empty word. Another
prays for money, and when his prayer is granted he
finds that his happiness is gone. The woman prays
for love; it comes, and she finds the bitterness of it.
The mother prays for the life of her child, and the
child grows up and breaks her heart.â

âThis will not do, Martin.â Paul Crossett rose and
put his hands kindly but firmly on the otherâs shoulder.
âYou are worn out; you are not yourself; tell me, do
you sleep?â

âNot when I can help it,â answered Dr. Barnhelm,
with a shudder.

âYou will sleep now, and while you sleep I am going
to sit beside you. Come! I will take you to your
room; no, I will listen to no refusal. I have crossed
the ocean just for this, to take care of you; the least
that you can do is to obey my orders. Come!â

âBut there is no need forâââ

âCome!â

Â

CHAPTER XX

MR. BARNES RETURNS

âWill
you have another cup, Mrs. Mooney?â

âNo, thank you; I will not, though better
tea I never tasted. Wellâif you are
that set on it, I suppose I might as well.â

Maria poured out Mrs. Mooneyâs third cup, and
leaving the tea-pot near at hand, left her to sit and sing
the praises of the two doctors to Nellie, who from a
lifelong experience had developed into a really wonderful
listener.

On her way down the hall Maria had to pass the
open door of the Doctorâs bedroom, and as she glanced
in she saw that he was sleeping peacefully, and that
Dr. Crossett still sat quietly beside the bed, looking
down earnestly into the pale, tired face of his old
friend.

âHeâs trying to find out whatâs the matter,â she
thought gratefully, âand heâll do it, too, if anybody
can; âcourse itâs natural that heâs awful unhappy about

Â
Miss Lola, but it looks to me like that ainât all; somehow
he seems to me more like he was afraid of something.â

DOCTOR MORTIMER WARNS LOLA THAT TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT MAY PROVE FATAL TO HER.

As she passed down the hall on her way to the front
door, the bell rang, and she, anxious that the sleeper
should not be disturbed, opened the door quickly.
There in the hall stood a slender young fellow in the
dark-blue uniform of the navy. His face, what little
of it that was not hidden behind quite the widest smile
that mortal countenance ever wore, was tanned to
about the shade of a fashionable summer shoe, and
above it his yellow hair made a symphony in color very
good to look upon. At least this seemed to be Mariaâs
opinion, for at the first sight of him a look of gladness
came into her eyes, the like of which many a man goes
through his whole life without ever once seeing.

âMr. Barnes! Oh, Mr. Barnes!â

âMaria,â he said or rather roared in greeting.

âHush!â She put her finger quickly to her lips.
âHeâs asleep; whisper.â

âMaria,â he repeated obediently, in what passed
with him as a whisper, but the sound of which rushed
whistling down the narrow hall like a deep sea breeze.

Â
âDonât whisper; talk natural,â she suggested hurriedly.
âHere, come into the front room anâ Iâll close
the door. Iâm awful glad to hear your voice, Mr.
Barnes, but I do wish you could keep from lettinâ all
the neighbors hear it.â

Once in the room and the door shut, she lost her
air of severity, however; he was so tall and strong and
had such a way with him that when he opened his
arms and smiled so invitingly, she surrendered completely,
and allowed him to embrace her with an ardor
that completely took her breath away.

âHa, ha, ha!â he roared gleefully; âmaybe this is
bad.â

âMr. Barnes! However did you get here?â

âFive daysâ shore leave. The shipâs anchored off
Ninety-fifth Street. Say, this ainât so bad, is it?â

âItâs, itâs mighty nice!â He was so delighted by
her admission that he roared again, but her alarmed
look sobered him, and lowering his voice as much as
possible, he faced her with a look he meant to be one
of great severity and determination, a look that he
had practiced carefully for the occasion before a little
mirror in the ward room of the battleship.

Â
âAinât you well, Mr. Barnes?â she enquired anxiously.

âWell,â he responded indignantly, âwhy shouldnât
I be well? Iâm here to get to cases. Youâve been
writing me fine letters lately, Maria, easy to read, and
the spelling getting more usual every day.â

âThank you, Mr. Barnes.â

âBut letters ainât no good when folks has really got
anything to say. So Iâm here to ask when it is going
to be?â

âWhat going to be?â

âYou said you was going to marry me, didnât you?â

âWellâIâyesâI did.â

âThen whatâs the use of jiggling?â

âI ainât jiggling,â she spoke, with great indignation.
âI donât know what jiggling is, but I ainât doinâ
it.â

âI get a month off ther first of May. Letâs call it
May the second; will yer, Maria?â

âIâIâd love to do it, Mr. Barnes. Iâd love to do it
awful well, butâbut whoâs to take care of him?â

âI know, but, Maria, donât you think youâd rather
take care of me?â

Â
âBut him!â Maria was very much in earnest and
very anxious for this hero of hers to fully understand.
âYou know all heâs done for me. If it hadnât
been for him and his, Iâd be just nothing at all, instead
of beinâ what I am, anâ goinâ to marry a real high-class
man like you. IâIâm afraid youâll have to wait, Mr.
Barnes,â she added very regretfully. âIâm awfully
sorry, but I couldnât leave him all alone!â

He looked at her for a moment with as close an approach
to a frown as was possible for his face to assume,
and something very like a threat of jealousy in
his voice.

âSometimes, Maria, I believe you love that old Doctor
of yours more than you do me!â

âI donât know. Maybe I do, but it ainât the same.
You see, he needs me, because heâs old and sick, and
all alone, and youâjust look at yourselfâred-faced,
anâ strong, anâ jolly, anâ handsome. You may want
me, Mr. Barnes, but you donât need nobody.â

Mr. Barnes tried to assume an injured look at this,
but only succeeded in grinning cheerfully, so he gave it
up, and decided to make the best of things. His life

Â
in the Navy had taught him the virtue of loyalty, and
in his heart he loved all the better for her devotion.

âWell, Maria, youâre the boss. I ainât kicking, but
itâs tough. Never mind; you get off to-night, and weâll
have a good time, anyhow. Iâll take you to the Hippodrome.â

âOh! Wonât that be fine? I can get away all right,
because Dr. Crossett is here, and they wouldnât want
me around anyway. Weâll have the best time in the
world!â

Whatever disappointment the sailor might have felt
was overshadowed by her happiness, and he started
to describe in advance some of the wonders they were
to see that night, when a ring at the bell interrupted
them.

âDarn the door,â exclaimed Maria rather emphatically.
âYou wait here till I see who it is.â As she
started toward the hall Barnes tried to kiss her, but
she avoided him laughingly, and turned at the door,
looking back at him and shaking her head reproachfully.

âYou ought to be ashamed, Mr. Barnes. You sailors
are awful!â

Â
She left the room, Barnes looking after her, very
much flattered. Like other bashful men, the idea that
he was looked upon as a dangerous ladiesâ man was
enough to make him completely happy; had he been
called a brave fellow he would have taken it quite as
a matter of course.

At the door Maria found John Dorris, and as she
admitted him he stopped to ask anxiously,

âHow is he to-day?â

Since Johnâs return from his unsuccessful journey
he had done his best to keep in touch with the Doctor,
although he had the feeling that his presence was not
always quite welcome, or at least that the sight of him
did more to remind the Doctor of Lola and to disturb
him than it did to bring him any comfort.

âHeâs going to be better,â Maria answered. âDr.
Crossett is here!â

âGood!â John was greatly relieved. He knew that
to no one in the world would Dr. Barnhelm be so
willing to turn for help as to this old friend, and he
felt that with all his skill, and with his great love, Dr.
Crossett might be able to see a way to ease the old

Â
manâs mind and persuade him to give up his growing
habit of moody solitude.

âThis isâis a friend of mine, sir, Mr. Barnes,â said
Maria bashfully, as they entered the front room and
saw Barnes standing there.

âNo! Not
the
Mr. Barnes,â cried John, greatly
pleased.

âYes.â

âI am glad to know you, Mr. Barnes. Very glad!â
John shook hands with him heartily, noting with approval
his frank, open countenance and his honest,
homely manner. âI have heard a lot about you, and
I like all that I have heard.â

âThank you, sir.â

âWe are all of us very fond of Maria,â continued
John. âI wonder if you realize what a lucky fellow
you are. There are not many girls like Maria.â

âThank you, sir,â responded Mr. Barnes heartily.
âOne of âem is enough for me.â

Dr. Crossett, followed by Nellie and Mrs. Mooney,
whom he had found patiently waiting in the kitchen,
came into the room, the Doctor holding Nellie by the
hand and looking at her with pride.

Â
âJohn!â He cried out in surprise and joy, and
took his hand as he listened to Johnâs warm greeting.
âI am so glad to see you, my boy, and look, look at
little Nellie here. Her arm is well. I have never seen
a cure more complete.â His eyes fell upon Barnes,
who was shuffling from one foot to another in an
agony of embarrassment. âAh!â The Doctor knew
him at once. âMaria! A sailor! Not the famous
Mr. Barnes?â

âYes, sir,â answered Maria proudly.

âI am glad to see you.â The Doctor took his hand
as cordially as he would that of an old friend. âYou
know, Mr. Barnes, I had my doubts about there really
being any such person. I feared you were a Mrs.
Harris.â

âNo, sir; Barnes is my right name.â

Maria had been made very happy by the doctors
and Johnâs kindness to her lover, but she had no idea
of allowing him to bore them, and she knew that these
two would have many things to say to one another.

âNow, Mr. Barnes, you go along with Nellie and
Mrs. Mooney. They are friends of mine. You can
come back here for me about half past seven.â

Â
âIâll be here,â he answered. âGood day, good day,
gentlemen.â

âGood day, Doctor. Go on, Nellie!â Mrs. Mooney
took her two charges to the door, then turned for a
final look at Dr. Crossett. âYou see, Doctor,â she
nodded proudly toward Nellie, âyou had it right. Just
as good as any of âem!â

âExcuse me, Doctor.â Maria followed them to the
door. âHe shouldnât have come here at all, but you
know what men are.â

When the door closed, and John found himself
alone with Dr. Crossett, he turned to him inquiringly.

âWell, Doctor, what do you think?â

âOf him?â

âYes.â

âSit down, my boy. I must talk with you.â

After they were seated, the Doctor went on gravely.
âHe is in a bad state. I do not understand. I came
here expecting to find grief. I find instead fearâhorror.â

âI have felt that from the first,â responded John.
âI have tried to be of help to him, but when I am

Â
here he seems to be more nervous than in my absence.
He never mentions her name, never asks for her.â

âTell me of her, John.â

âShe went away with that man, Dick Fenway,â
John began. âHe took her first to Atlantic City with
a party of his friends. I followed them; you know
that. What I would have done if I had found them
I donât knowâkilled him perhaps, but I am not sure.
Later there was a scandal about them at Narragansett
Pier, and she left him.â

âLeft him?â

âFor another manâa man old enough to be her
father and rich enough to grant every wish of her
heart. Oh, itâs a hellish thing to talk about, Doctor.
I met this Dick Fenway about that time, and upon my
word I was almost sorry for the little beast. He loved
her in his way; God knows how much of the fault was
his; I canât pretend to say. The whole miserable business
sickens me, but every detail, every word of scandal,
every report of her growing extravagance and
moral degradation stays in my mind!â

âI know.â The Doctor put his hand gently on
Johnâs arm, and after a moment John continued:

Â
âWherever she goes the papers are full of her exploits.
She has been through scandal after scandal,
and has come out more daring, more reckless than
before. A month ago I saw her. She was crossing
Broadway in a great touring car. She saw me andââJohnâs
voice brokeââandâshe laughed.â

âYou love her, John?â

âYes. I am ashamed to say so, but I do.â

âMy boy, I loved her mother like that long after my
love was hopeless. I knew her well; how this evil ever
fell upon a child of hers I cannot understand.â

They were silent a moment, John thinking of Lola,
Dr. Crossett of the mother, who, thank God, was not
here to feel the shame of this. Her death had been a
hard blow to him, harder even than the marriage that
had taken her away from him forever, but to-day he
was glad that she was dead. John began again, his
sorrow finding the only relief it had known in the
sympathy of this good friend.

âIf I had ever seen a trace of it in her I could bear
it better, but she was so good, so pure, that she used
to frighten me. I never saw a look in her face that
you would not see on the face of a happy, innocent
child, untilâââ

Â
âWell?â

John hesitated; in his mind there was a thought
that he dared not put into words. Even to himself he
had not dared to express it, but this man was wise;
if there could be any truth in the wild idea that had
forced itself into his brain here was a man who would
know.

âShe was always the same, Doctor, always, until
that night, the first time I saw her afterâafter she
wasâhurt, the change began then; from that
hourâââ

âOh!â He looked up, startled by a moan of terror,
of horror, and saw that Maria had entered the room
with a tea-tray in her hands. She was standing now,
white as a dead woman, her eyes fixed upon the door.
He turned to follow her frightened gaze, and as he
did so a nameless dread came over him. He saw the
door open slowly, very slowly, and a womanâs figure
standing quietly on the threshold; he did not need to
raise his eyes; he did not need the frightened cry from
Maria nor the Doctorâs sharp exclamation; he knew,
and knowing he slowly raised his head and looked into
her face.

Â

CHAPTER XXI

CONCLUSION

Lola
stood there, leaning against the partly-opened
door, looking at them, with a smile of
curious amusement on her face. Maria, after
one long look, sank to her knees and hid her face in her
arms. John and the Doctor stood silent, both of them
trying to find in this pale, wonderfully gowned, hollow-eyed
but beautiful woman some trace of the girl
they had loved. It was Lolaâand yetââ

âAh!â She spoke quietly, but with a queer
monotony of tone that struck unpleasantly on the ear.
âAll my old friends. I hardly expected this.â

âYou have come back.â

âYes, John, as you so keenly observe, I have come
back.â

âTo stay?â

âFor the present, yes.â

âI knew that you would come.â

âOh, yes, no doubt. You looked for me to return

Â
in rags and repentance. That naturally would be your
idea of a proper retribution. Well, I am here, but I
came in neither rags nor repentance. I do not even
come in fear. I came to claim what is mine by right.â
She stepped forward very slowly and sat in the same
little chair she had always chosen. John noticed how
languid were all her movements; the Doctor saw more,
and knew now the reason of her return. He would
have spoken, but he heard her fatherâs step in the hall,
and for one of the few times in his life he lost his
head. He tried to call out, to warn him, in some way
to prepare him for the shock, but he could not; he
seemed for a moment to have lost the power of speech,
of movement, and before he could recover himself
Dr. Barnhelm came into the room.

âI could not sleep, Paul,â he began; âI tried,
butâââ Then he saw her. She sat in the chair
looking at him with no trace of softening on her face,
no shame, just a half smile of amusement. Maria
rose from her knees and stepped toward him, her arms
held out as if to offer him protection. The two men
stepped forward, watching his face for the sign of love
and forgiveness they both hoped to see there. It did

Â
not come. He paused for just a moment, then spoke
very quietly, with extreme politeness.

âI had not expected youâquite yet.â

âNo?â She seemed quite as calm, quite as formal
as he was himself.

âYou are to remain with us?â He asked the question
as one might ask it of a perfect stranger.

âYes.â

âYour room is ready, I believe. Maria.â

âYes, sir.â Maria stepped to his side.

âYou will see to everything, Maria.â

âYes, sir.â

âMartin!â Dr. Crossett could contain himself no
longer. âIs this the way you meet, you two?â

âWhy not?â Lola looked up at him coldly. âWe
understand one another quite well, I think.â

âI think so,â replied her father, âbut I must be sure.
I must speak with you alone.â

âCome, John. Come, Maria.â Dr. Crossett went
with them to the door, but the sight of those two,
father and daughter, coldly facing one another, was
more than he could bear, and he returned to Dr. Barnhelm
and, putting both hands on his shoulders, spoke

Â
to him with all his tenderness, all his love for them,
and for the dead mother to whom this sight would
have been so terrible, in his voice.

âMartin, if our old friendship means anything to
you, I beg you to remember that she has come back
to us, not for blame or reproaches, but for comfort,
for love!â

âI must speak to her alone.â Dr. Barnhelmâs voice
was so firm, his manner so full of an iron resolution,
that Dr. Crossett could say no more. He turned to
Lola with a pitiful attempt at his old lightness of manner,
and without again looking back he left the room,
only pausing to shut the door behind him.

She did not speak, but sat there, never for a moment
taking her eyes from his face and waiting; at last he
began.

âWhy are you here?â

âI am here because they tell me that I am going to
die.â

He had not expected this, and for a moment it broke
through the stern repose of his manner.

âWhat?â

âSo they say,â she answered calmly, âthe best of

Â
them. There is something here.â She put her hand
to her side.

âYour heart.â

âDid you think,â she said, her whole face lighting up
with a flash of merriment, âthat it was my soul?â
She laughed then, quite with her old hearty laugh, at
his cry of horror and at his look of mortal agony as
he shrank away from her, his arms thrown up, as if
to ward off some deadly peril. âThey told me,â she
continued, âthat it was not a question of months or
of years, but of hours, and so I came to you.â

âWhy?â

âBecause you are the one man in all the world who
can help me. You can keep me from death, or if I
die you can do the thing you did before!â She made
the first movement she had made since she had sunk
into her chair as she raised her hand and pointed to
the gleaming brass, the bright glass, and the coiled
wires of his apparatus, which stood there on the table.

He had known always that this moment was to
come to him, had known what his answer was to be,
and he shook his head in refusal.

âYou must! That you must swear. I cannot die!

Â
Not now! You know that! You must not let me die!
You owe me that, at least!â

She had lost her composure, her breath came in
fitful, uneven gasps, and as she sat there she pressed
one hand over her heart.

âWait!â He spoke quickly. âYou must answer me
some questions.â

âWell.â

âYou, my daughter, your motherâs daughter, left
my house with a married man?â

âYes.â

âYou robbed me; you were willing that a good,
loyal girl, who worshipped you, should suffer in your
place. You broke the heart of a young man who
loved you?â

âYes. I did those things.â

âDo you feel sorrow for them?â

âNo.â

âDo you feel shame for what you did then or for all
the things you have done since then?â

âNo!â

âYou did them because they suited your mood?

Â
What you wanted you took; the thing you felt that
you wanted to do you did?â

âYes.â

âWithout a regret? Without one single backward
thought of us?â

âWhy should I think of you?â she asked scornfully.
âWhat did you mean in my life, any of you,
after I once put you all behind me? Does one think
again of the food that nourished him yesterday, or of
the sun that kept him warm? I was born into this
world like any other thing that breathes, to live if I
was strong, to die if I was weak. I did not ask for
life, but when it came, why should I not get all of its
brightness if I could? Why should I think of anyoneâs
pleasures or pains but my own? What is the
world to me but the place in which I am to live my
own life, in my own way, and for my own good?â

âYou need not go on,â he said quietly. âYou have
told me all that I wished to know.â

âBut you have not given me the promise I came here
to get.â As she spoke she rose unsteadily from her
chair, clinging for support to the back of it and looking

Â
at him with a fierce questioning in her eyes. âWill
you stay by me until my heart fails?â

âI will.â

âWill you do your best to save me?â

âI will.â

âAnd if you fail?â At her question her voice rose
shrilly, almost to a scream. âIf I die, as they said
that I mustâwhat will you do then? Answer! Answer!
Will you bring my life back to me? Will
you?â

He would not answer; for a moment she looked at
him, her face frozen into lines of awful terror; then
screaming, panting, she staggered to the door, and
opening it she called wildly:

âJohn! Doctor! Come! Come!â

They rushed in, Maria following, and would have
gone to her, but she waved them back and pointed at
her father, her face dreadful with its look of fear
and hatred. âListen! Youâyou must help me. You
must make that man swear what I want him to swear,
and you must see that he keeps his word! He must!
He wonât if he can help it. I know he wonât. Look
at him! Look at his face. What do you read there?

Â
Pity? Love? Sympathy? Sympathy for me? Do
you? No! Fear! He is afraid that I will make him
swear, and I willâI willââ!â

She rushed at him, staggered forward as though
she would tear the promise from him, but as they
cried out and threw themselves between, she stopped
suddenly and, throwing up her arms, screamed once
and fell at their feet. Dr. Crossett knelt beside her
and in a moment looked up gravely.

âNo pulse! Her heart does not beat. Quick, Martin!â
He left her and sprang to the table, seeking
frantically for the electric switch that would start the
machine.

âNo!â The fatherâs voice came quietly, but his
eyes never left the figure that lay motionless on the
floor.

âWhat!â John cried out in amazement.

âYou must!â Paul Crossett put his hand out and
shook the old man almost roughly. âYou must! She
is your daughter!â

âShe is not my daughter. My daughter died ten
months ago. My daughterâs soul is with her motherâs,
as pure and as white as on the day I first held her in

Â
my arms. I owe no duty to this creature here. This
empty shell from which the soul has been driven out.
I am not her father, but if I were, I still would sayâin
Godâs nameâlet her die!â

He had taken a heavy mallet in his hand, and as he
spoke he brought it down with all his strength upon
the delicate mechanism in front of him. He struck
twice, and there was nothing left but a mass of broken
glass and a heap of bent and twisted wires.

THE HARVESTER
.
Illustrated by W. L. Jacobs

âThe Harvester,â David Langston, is
a man of the woods and fields, who draws
his living from the prodigal hand of Mother
Nature herself. If the book had nothing in
it but the splendid figure of this man, with
his sure grip on life, his superb optimism,
and his almost miraculous knowledge of
nature secrets, it would be notable. But
when the Girl comes to his âMedicine
Woods,â and the Harvesterâs whole sound,
healthy, large outdoor being realizes that
this is the highest point of life which has
come to himâthere begins a romance,

MYRTLE REEDâS NOVELS

May be had wherever books are sold.

Ask for Grosset & Dunlapâs list.

LAVENDER AND OLD LACE
.

A charming story of a quaint corner of
New England where bygone romance finds a
modern parallel. The story centers round
the coming of love to the young people on
the staff of a newspaperâand it is one of the
prettiest, sweetest and quaintest of old fashioned
love stories, * * * a rare book, exquisite
in spirit and conception, full of
delicate fancy, of tenderness, of delightful
humor and spontaneity.

A SPINNER IN THE SUN
.

Miss Myrtle Reed may always be depended upon to write a story
in which poetry, charm, tenderness and humor are combined into a
clever and entertaining book. Her characters are delightful and she
always displays a quaint humor of expression and a quiet feeling of
pathos which give a touch of active realism to all her writings. In
âA Spinner in the Sunâ she tells an old-fashioned love story, of a
veiled lady who lives in solitude and whose features her neighbors
have never seen. There is a mystery at the heart of the book that
throws over it the glamour of romance.

THE MASTERâS VIOLIN
.

A love story in a musical atmosphere. A picturesque, old German
virtuoso is the reverent possessor of a genuine âCremona.â He
consents to take for his pupil a handsome youth who proves to have
an aptitude for technique, but not the soul of an artist. The youth
has led the happy, careless life of a modern, well-to-do young American
and he cannot, with his meagre past, express the love, the passion
and the tragedies of life and all its happy phases as can the master
who has lived life in all its fulness. But a girl comes into his lifeâa
beautiful bit of human driftwood that his aunt had taken into her
heart and home, and through his passionate love for her, he learns
the lessons that life has to giveâand his soul awakes.

Founded on a fact that all artists realize.

STORIES OF THE KENTUCKY MOUNTAINS

May be had wherever books are sold.

Ask for Grosset & Dunlapâs list.

THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE
.
Illustrated by F. C. Yohn.

The âlonesome pineâ from which the
story takes its name was a tall tree that
stood in solitary splendor on a mountain
top. The fame of the pine lured a young
engineer though Kentucky to catch the
trail, and when he finally climbed to its
shelter he found not only the pine but the

foot-prints of a girl
. And the girl proved
to be lovely, piquant, and the trail of
these girlish foot-prints led the young
engineer a madder chase than âthe trail
of the lonesome pine.â

THE LITTLE SHEPHERD OF KINGDOM COME
.
Illustrated by F. C. Yohn.

This is a story of Kentucky, in a settlement known as âKingdom
Come.â It is a life rude, semi-barbarous; but natural
and honest from which often springs the flower of civilization.

âChad,â the âlittle shepherdâ did not know who he was nor
whence he cameâhe had just wandered from door to door since
early childhood, seeking shelter with kindly mountaineers who
gladly fathered and mothered this waif about whom there was
such a mysteryâa charming waif, by the way, who could play
the banjo better that anyone else in the mountains.

A KNIGHT OF THE CUMBERLAND
.
Illustrated by F. C. Yohn.

The scenes are laid along the waters of the Cumberland,
the lair of moonshiner and feudsman. The knight is a moonshinerâs
son, and the heroine a beautiful girl perversely christened
âThe Blight.â Two impetuous young Southernersâ fall
under the spell of âThe Blightâsâ charms and she learns what
a large part jealousy and pistols have in the love making of the
mountaineers.

Included in this volume is âHell fer-Sartainâ and other
stories, some of Mr. Foxâs most entertaining Cumberland valley
narratives.

CHIP, OF THE FLYING U

among the cowboys of the West, in search of âlocal colorâ for a

welcome, is that of love.

THE LONESOME TRAIL

city life palls on him. A little branch of sage brush,
pungent with the atmosphere of the prairie, and the recollection of
a pair of large brown eyes soon compel his return. A wholesome
love story.

THE LONG SHADOW

A vigorous Western story, sparkling with the free, outdoor,
life of a mountain ranch. Its scenes shift rapidly and its actors play
the game of life fearlessly and like men. It is a fine love story from
start to finish.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

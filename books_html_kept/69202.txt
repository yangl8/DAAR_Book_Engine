THE COST OF WINGS

SHELDRICK, returning, refreshed and exhilarated,
from a spin with a friend who had brought down a
racing car of forty horse-power and an enthusiasm to
match, found his wife sitting in the same chair, in the
same attitude, as it seemed to him, in which he had left
her, in the bare, dull sitting-room of their quarters at
the Pavilion Hotel, on the edge of Greymouth Links,
from which starting point Sheldrick, in fulfillment of his
recent engagement with the Aero Club of France, had
arranged to take wing for Cherbourg, wind and weather
permitting, on the morrow.

It would be difficult exceedingly to imagine Caruso as
an engineer or a bank manager, or in any capacity other
than that of operatic star. It would be equally difficult
to picture Shackleton as a side-splitting antic and quip-monger,
or PÃ©lissier in the rÃ´le of the dauntless explorer.
Sheldrick, the most recent idol of the flying world, was
the type-ideal of the aviator.

Mathematician, engineer, meteorologist, and athlete,
his tall, lightly built but muscular frame carried the head
of an eagle. The wide forehead, sloping to the temples,
the piercing prominently set eyes, the salient nose, and
the wide, firm, deep-cut mouth characterizing the long-winged
birds of powerful flight, were Sheldrickâs. His,
too, the long, supple neck, the curiously deceptive shoulder
slope that disguises depth of chest while his long
[2]

arms looked as though, were they clothed with feathers,
they might cleave the air; and his feet gripped the
ground through the thin, soft boots he always wore, as
the eagleâs talons grip the rock.

Perhaps he was not unaware of the suggested resemblance.
He had certainly christened his recently completed
monoplane âAquila,â and had piloted her to victory
in two minor events at the Moncaster Spring Flying
Meeting in April of that year, and at the Nismes
Concours des Aviateurs of three weeks before had carried
off the Grand Prix of 25,000 francs for the longest flight
under favorable weather conditions. And at the Club
dinner following the presentation of the prizes, Sheldrick,
flushed with conquest and congratulations, had
given that pledge whereby the soul of the woman who
yet loved him was wrung to torture anew.

âAfter all that I have borne,â Mrs. Sheldrick had said
to herself, sitting in her hideous red moreen-covered
chair by the green Venetian-blinded window of the staring
hotel sitting-roomââafter three years of agony, silently,
patiently enduredâafter all his promises, I am
still upon the rack.â

She looked rather like it as she sat by the window, the
center one of three that gave a view across the gray-green
links, and the gray-brown beach of smooth, sliding
pebbles that gave place to the gray-white, throbbing
water of the English Channel. And the white, drawn
face that masked her frenzy of anguish, and the dark-gray,
haunted eyes through which her suffering spirit
looked, greeted her husband as he burst into the room,
fresh from his banquet of speed and clean, salt, buoyant
air, and sympathetic, enthusiastic companionship, like
an unexpected douche of ice water.

[3]
âHavenât you been out?â

Sheldrick uttered the words recorded, upon a pause
implying the swallowing of others less neutrally amiable.
And his face, which had already clouded, darkened
sullenly as his wife replied: âI have traveled some distance
since you left here with your friend.â

âWhere have you been?â asked Sheldrick unwillingly,
as a man who suspects that the question may open some
unwelcome topic.

Mrs. Sheldrick looked at her husband full; and, though
it had seemed to him that he had read the book of her
beauty from preface to finis, there was something new
to him in her regard as she answered:

âI have gone over in memory every week of the last
three years that we have spent together, Edgar; and the
road has been a rough and stony one, without one green
patch of grass to rest on by the wayside, or one refreshing
spring at which to drink. But I was patient while
I plodded after you, because I saw an end to what I was
enduring. Now it seems that I am mistaken. It is only
my endurance that is at an end.â

âWhy do you talk in allegory, Ella?â Sheldrick broke
out impatiently. He threw down his leather motoring
cap with the talc eye shields upon the sofa, and pitched
his heavy overcoat upon a chair in a corner of the ugly
room, and let his long, lithe body down into a hideous
Early Victorian plush armchair beside the empty fireplace,
where nothing crackled but some fantastically
bordered strips of red and green gelatine paper, shuddering
under the influence of a powerful chimney
draught. âIâm not an imaginative man,â he went on.
âEven if my mind were not occupied with a dozen affairs
of supreme urgency I should still boggle at interpreting
[4]

your cryptic utterances. If you want them understood,
make them to some minor poet at a garden
party or an At Home. Youâve stacks of invitations from
the nicest people to all sorts of functions ever since I
pulled off those two events at Moncaster and the Grand
Prix at Nismes. And now that itâs May, and the season
in full swing, you might be having no end of a capital
time at home in London instead ofâââ She interrupted
him with a passionate gesture.

âI have no home!â

âNo?â said Sheldrick coolly, leaning back his head
against the knobby back of the Early Victorian armchair.

âNo!â said Mrs. Sheldrick, and her passion seemed
to dash itself against and break upon the manâs composure
as a wave beats and breaks upon a rock. âIt was
a home, once, when you were working partner in the
firm of Mallard, Mallard and Sheldrick, Manufacturers
of Automobiles; and the life you led was a normal, ordinary,
everyday life, and the risks you ran were everyday,
ordinary risks, such as a woman who loved youânote
that I say
who loved you
âmight bear without going
mad or dying of terror. But it is a prison now. I
cannot breathe in it. Even when you are there with
meâand when every postmanâs knock, or telegraph
boyâs ring, or telephone message has for the moment
ceased to be fraught with hideous, often-dreamed-of,
never-forgotten possibilities ... when each newsboyâs
voice, yelling in the streets, has temporarily ceased to be
the voice of Fate for meâit is no longer home! It is a
caravanserai, from which Hope and Content and Peace
of Mind may go out before the next dayâs dawning, leaving
[5]

the door open that Death and Despair may the more
freely enter in!â

âElla!â exclaimed Sheldrick, looking at her open-eyed.
She had always been such a quiet, calm, self-possessed
woman, that now, as she rose up out of her chair suddenly,
as though she had been prodded with a bayonet,
she was strange and new, and rather awe-inspiring. As
she stood before him, her passion-breathing face an ivory
cameo between the drooping folds of her rich blue-black
hair, her gray eyes glittering fiercely between the narrowed
lids under the straight black brows, her lips two
bitterly straightened lines of scarlet showing the gleaming
teeth, her firm chin implacable in its set upon the
dainty cravat of muslin and black silk ribbon, her slight
bosom panting fiercely under her bodice folds, her slender
limbs rigid beneath the sheath-fitting gown of silken
chestnut-colored cloth, the man, her husband, looked at
her more attentively than he had looked for years.

âElla, what is the matter? What has upset you like
this? If there is anything I can do to put things right,
why not tell me, andâandâââ

Sheldrickâs voice faltered, and his eyes looked away
from his wifeâs as he saw the reviving hope leap desperately
into her face. It died instantly, leaving her
gray eyes more somber, and the lines of her scarlet,
parted lips more bitter than before.

âAh, yes!â she said. âWhy not tell you what you
know already, and be coaxed and patted into compliance
and meek, patient submission for the hundredth
time! You will kiss me good-bye to-morrow morning, if
the weather permits of your starting, and make this
flight. It is to be the last, the very last, like the others
that have gone before it; it is only so much more daring,
[6]

only so much more risky, only so much more dangerous
than the things that other aviators have dared and
risked and braved. If it blows from the north you will
not dream of making the ventureâthe jagged rocks and
shoals, and the towering, greedy seas of the Channel
Islands threaten things too grim. You will wait, and
I with youâoh, my God!âfor a favorable wind. Your
successes at Brookfields and at Nismes have made the
âAquilaâ patent worth a moderate fortune; they are turning
out replicas of her at your workshops as rapidly as
they can make themâyour manager took on twenty
more skilled hands only last week. You have done what
you set out to do; we are freed from poverty for the
rest of our livesâwe might live happily, peacefully together
somewhere, if this unnatural love of peril had
not bitten you to the bone. âOne more contest,â you will
keep on saying; âone more revenge I am bound to give
this and that or the other man whom I have beaten, or
who has challenged me.ââ Her bosom heaved, and the
ivory paleness of her face was darkened with a rush of
blood. âHonor is involved. You are bound in honor
to keep your word to others, but free to deceive, to defraud,
to cheat and lie toâyour wife!â

âTake care what youâre saying!â

Sheldrick leaped out of his chair, fiery red and glaring
angrily. Mrs. Sheldrick looked at him out of her
glittering, narrowed eyes, and laughed, and her laugh
was ugly to hear.

âYour wife! Did you ever realize what it meant to
me to be your wife? When we were married, and for
eighteen months after that! Heaven upon earth! Have
you ever dreamed what sort of life began for me when
you were first bitten by this craze of flying, three years
[7]

ago? Hellâsheer, unmitigated hell! To the public I
am a woman in an ulster, or in a dust cloak and a silk
motor veil, thick to hide the ghastly terror in my face!âa
woman who kisses you before the start, and keeps pace
with your aeroplane in an automobile through the long-distance
flights, with what the English newspaper men
describe as âunswerving devotion,â and the French
press correspondents term âa tenderness of the most
touching.â They are wrong! I am not conscious of any
special devotion. The springs of tenderness have frozen
in me. I am like every other spectator on the course,
possessed, body and soul, by the secret, poignant, momentary
expectation of seeing a man hurled to a horrible
death. Only the man isâmy husband!
Now
I remember
this, Edgar, but a day will dawnâan hour will
come to meâis coming as surely as there is a God in
heavenâwhen he will be no more than the flying man
who may possibly be killed!â

There was silence in the room, and the hoarse, dry
sound that broke it was not a sob. It came from Sheldrick,
a single utterance, like the sound of something
breaking.

âIâunderstand!â

There was no response, for the woman, having unsealed
and poured out the last drop of her vials of bitterness
and wrath, was dumb. Sheldrick added, after a
long pause:

âWhat do you ask? That I should give up the attempt
to fly to Cherbourg? That I should break the
engagement with the Aero Clubâwithdraw the challenge
given to M. Ledru? Is that what you demand?â

She said with a hopeless gesture:

âI ask nothing! I demand nothing!â

[8]
Sheldrick muttered an oath. But in his soul he was
yielding. âAquila No. 1,â âAquila No. 2,â and âAquila
No. 3â were dear to his soul. But he had awakened to
the fact that his dearest possession was the love of his
wife. And he had been killing it by inches. He met
her eyes nowâthe stern gray eyes that had learned to
see him as he was and look on the bare realities of life,
shorn of its love glamour, and muttered:

âIt is true. I have promised over and over.... And
I owe it to you to take no more risks, even more than if
we had a living child to.... Where are those cable-forms?â

He strode to the ink-splashed writing table between
the windows, and routed the bundle of greenish papers
out of the frowsy blotting book, and dipped the blunt
pen into the thick, dirty ink, and wrote:

â
To Ledru, HÃ´tel National, Cherbourg, France.

âUnavoidably compelled break engagementâââ

He was struck by a sudden idea, ceased writing, and
left the room, going into the adjoining bedroom. His
wife, standing dumb and frozen on the gaudy hearthrug
near the empty grate, heard him rummaging for
something. He came back in a few minutes with a
heavy brow and preoccupied look, and took a leather
strap from the pocket of the heavy overcoat he had
thrown upon the sofa. With this he went back into the
bedroom. The door handle rattled as though something
were being hitched about it, the stout door groaned
and creaked under a violent pull from the other side,
there was a horrible, suggestive crack, and a stifled oath
from Sheldrick. Next moment he was back in the room,
[9]

dipping the blunt pen into the bad ink, and finishing the
cablegram:

âLeft wrist badly sprainedâ
Sheldrick
,
Pavilion Hotel,
Links, Greymouth, England
.â

Having finished writing, he brought the filled form to
his wife. She read, and looked at him in eloquent silence.
And, in answer to the question in her eyes, he
held out his left hand, already swollen and purple, and
with a swelling of the dimensions of a cricket ball, indicating
the dislocated joint. A cry broke from her:

âOh! how could you....â

âIt was the easiest way,â said Sheldrick, flushed and
scowling. âCall me a coward, if you like. I deserve itâas
well as the other names!â He rang the bell, and
fished with the sound hand for silver in a trouser
pocket.

âWeâll send the cable now,â he said.

She bit her lips, that were no longer scarlet, and went
to the blotted blotter, dipped the worn pen into the
blobby ink, and made an alteration in the cablegram.
Then she showed it to him, and the message ran:

â
To Ledru, HÃ´tel National, Cherbourg, France.

âUnavoidably compelled postpone engagement. Left
wrist badly sprained.â
Sheldrick
,
Pavilion Hotel,
Links, Greymouth, England
.â

As Sheldrick looked at Mrs. Sheldrick, in intent
amazement, the bell was answered by a German waiter.
Mrs. Sheldrick took the silver out of Sheldrickâs sound
hand, dismissed the attendant to dispatch the message,
[10]

closed and locked the door of the sitting-room against
intruders, and then went quickly to her husband and fell
upon his breast. He clasped her with his sound arm as
she broke into passionate weeping, and only whispered
when at last she lifted her face to his:

âWhy âpostponedâ?â

âBecause,â whispered Ella Sheldrick, with her cheek
against her husbandâs, âbecause you are not chained to
your rock, my darling, with iron bars between you and
the free fields of space, forged by the wife you love. You
are free to give and take as many challenges as you desire.
When you have finished âAquila No. 4,â that shall
be built with a seat for a passenger beside you, run what
risks you choose, brave as many dangers as seem good
to you; I will not say one word, provided that I share
the risk and brave the danger too.â

This is why the successful aviator Sheldrick never flies
without a passenger. And the story has a moralâof a
kind.

[11]

A FADED ROMANCE

In Two Parts

I

THE ladies of the household at Charny les Bois usually
sat in the library on sunny mornings. At the
southern end of the long room, paneled in black walnut,
and possessing a hooded stone fireplace of the fifteenth
century, there was a bay, with wide glass doors opening
upon a
perron
of wrought iron and copper work,
which led down into the lovely gardenâa piece of land
originally reclaimed from the heart of the ancient beech
forest, whose splendid somberness set off the dazzling
whiteness of the
chÃ¢teau
and made the parterres glow
and sparkle like jewelsârubies, turquoises, emeralds,
sapphiresâpoured out upon the green velvet lap of
princess or courtesan.

The Marquis de Courvaux, lord of the soil and owner
of the historic mansion, was absent. One must picture
him leading the hunt through the forest alleys, attired
in a maroon and yellow uniform of the most exquisite
correctness, three-cocked hat, and immense spurred jack-boots,
and accompanied by a field of fifty or sixty, of
which every individual had turned out in a different costume:
green corduroy knickerbockers with gold braid
accompanying cut-away coats and jockey caps, and
[12]

bowlers of English make, sported in combination with
pink and leathers, adding much to the kaleidoscopic effect.
Half a dozen
cuirassiers
from the neighboring garrison
town were upon their London coach, driving a
scratch four-in-hand and attired in full uniform; various
vehicles, of types ranging from the capacious
char-Ã -banc

to the landaulette, were laden with ardent votaries
of the
chasse
.

The distant fanfare of the horns sounding the
ragot

reached the ears of the ladies sewing in the library at the

chÃ¢teau
. One of these ladies, detained by urgent nursery
reasons from joining in the morningâs sport, was
the young and pretty wife of the Marquis; the other, old
as a high-bred French lady alone knows how to be, and
still beautiful, was his mother. Over the high-arched
cover of the great carved fireplace was her portrait by
Varolan, painted at sixteen, in the full ball costume of
1870. One saw, regarding that portrait, that it was possible
to be beautiful in those days even with a chignon
and waterfall, even with panniers or bustle, and absurd
trimmings of the ham-frill type. Perhaps some such
reflection passed through the calm mind behind the
broad, white, unwrinkled forehead of Madame de Courvaux,
as she removed her gold spectacles and lifted her
eyes, darkly blue and brilliant still, to the exquisite
childish flower face of the portrait. The autumn breeze
coming in little puffs between the open
battants
of the
glass doors, savoring of crushed thyme, late violets, moss,
bruised beech leaves, and other pleasant things, stirred
the thick, waving, gold-gray tresses under the rich lace,
a profusion of which, with the charming coquetry of a
venerable beauty, the grandmamma of the chubby young
gentleman upstairs in the nursery, the thirteen-year-old
[13]

schoolboy on his hunting pony, and the budding belle but
newly emancipated from her convent, was fond of wearingâsometimes
tied under her still lovely chin, sometimes
floating loosely over her shoulders.

âThere again!â The younger Madame de Courvaux
arched her mobile eyebrows and showed her pretty teeth
as she bit off a thread of embroidery cotton. âThe third
time you have looked at that portrait within ten minutes!
Tell me, do you think it is getting stained with
smoke? In north winds this chimney does not always
behave itself, and FrÃ©dÃ©ricâs cigars and pipesâââ The
speaker shrugged her charming shoulders. âBut he is
incorrigible, as thou knowest,
Maman
.â

âI was not thinking of FrÃ©dÃ©ric or the chimney.â The
elder lady smiled, still looking upward at the girlish face
overhead. âIt occurred to me that forty years have
passed since I gave Carlo Varolan the first sitting for
that portrait. His studio in the Rue Vernet was a perfect
museum of lovely things.... I was never tired of
examining them.... My
gouvernante
fell asleep in a
great tapestry chair.... Varolan drew a caricature of
herâso laughable!âwith a dozen strokes of the charcoal
on the canvas, and then rubbed it all out with a grave
expression that made me laugh more. I was only just
sixteen, and going to be married in a fortnight....
And I could laugh like that!â The antique brooch of
black pearls and pigeonsâ blood rubies that fastened the
costly laces upon the bosom of Madame la Marquise
rose and fell at the bidding of a sigh.

âI cried for days and days before my marriage with
FrÃ©dÃ©ric,â the little Marquise remarked complacently.

âAnd I should cry at the bare idea of not being married
at all!â said a fresh young voice, belonging to
[14]

Mademoiselle Lucie, who came up the steps from the
garden with the skirt of her cambric morning frock full
of autumn roses, her cheeks flushed to the hue of the
pinkest La France. She dropped her pretty reverence
to her grandmother, kissed her upon the hand, and her
mother on the forehead, and turned her lapful of flowers
out upon the table, where vases and bowls of SÃ¨vres and
China ware stood to receive them, ready filled with water.
âYou know I would, Grandmamma!â

âIt is a mistake either to laugh or to weep; one should
smile only, or merely sigh,â said Grandmamma, with the
charming air of philosophy that so became her. âOne
should neither take life too much to heart, nor make a
jest of it, my little Lucie.â

âPlease go on with the story. Your
gouvernante
was
asleep in the chair; Monsieur Varolan caricatured her.
You were laughing at the drawing and at his droll face,
as he rubbed it out, and thenâââ

âThen a gentleman arrived, and I did not laugh any
more.â Grandmamma took up her work, a delicate,
spidery web of tatting, and the corners of her delicately
chiseled lips, pink yet as faded azalea blossoms, quivered
a little. âHe was staying at the British Embassy with
his brother-in-law, who was Military AttachÃ©, and
whose name I have forgotten. He came to see his sisterâs
portrait; it stood framed upon the easelâoh! but
most beautiful and stately, with the calm, cold gaze, the
strange poetic glamour of the North. He, too, was fair,
very tall, with aquiline features, and light hazel eyes,
very piercing in their regard, and yet capable of expressing
great tenderness. For Englishmen I have never
cared, but Scotch gentlemen of high breeding have always
appeared to me quite unapproachable in
ton
, much
[15]

like the Bretons of old blood, with whom their type, indeed,
has much in common. But I am prosing quite intolerably,
it seems to me!â said Grandmamma, with a
heightened tint upon her lovely old cheeks and an embarrassed
laugh.

Both Lucie and the little Marquise cried out in protestation.
Lucie, snipping dead leaves from her roses,
wanted to know whether Monsieur Varolan had presented
the strange Scotch gentleman to Grandmamma.

âHe did. At first he seemed to hesitate, glancing toward
Mademoiselle Binet. But she slept soundly, and,
indeed, with cause, having over-eaten herself that day at
the twelve oâclock breakfast upon duck stewed with
olives, pastry, and corn salad. An excellent creature,
poor Binet, but with the failings of
ces gens-lÃ
, and you
may be assured that I did not grudge her her repose
while I conversed with Monsieur Angus Dunbar, who
spoke French almost to perfection. How it was that I,
who had been brought up by my mother with such absolute
strictness, yielded to the entreaties of Monsieur
Varolan, who was quite suddenly inspired with the idea
of what afterward proved to be one of his greatest pictures,
I cannot imagine,â said Grandmamma; âbut it is
certain that we posed together as the Lord of Nann and
the Korrigan standing in the forest by the enchanted
well. It would have been a terrible story to travel home
to the Faubourg St. Germain, I knew, but Mademoiselle
still slept sweetly, and out of girlish recklessness and

gaietÃ© de cÅur
I consented, and down came my long
ropes of yellow hair, which had only been released from
their schoolroom plait, and dressed in grown young-lady
fashion six months before. Monsieur Varolan cried out,
and clasped his hands in his impulsive southern way.
[16]

Monsieur Dunbar said nothingâthen; but by his eyes
one could tell, child as one was, that he was pleased.
But when Varolanâs sketch was dashed in, and the
painter cried to us to descend from the modelâs platform,
Monsieur Dunbar leaned toward me and whispered,
as he offered me his hand, âIf the fairy had been
as beautiful as you, Mademoiselleââfor Varolan had
told him the story, and he had pronounced it to be the
parallel of an antique Highland legendââhad the fairy
been as beautiful as you, the Lord of Nann would have
forgotten the lady in the tower by the sea.â He, as I
have told you, my children, spoke French with great
ease and remarkable purity; and something in the earnestness
of his manner and the expression of his eyesâthose
light hazel, gleaming eyesââGrandmammaâs delicate
dove-colored silks rustled as she shuddered slightlyââcaused
me a thrill, but a thrillâââ

âYoung girls are so absurdly impressionable,â began
the little Marquise, with a glance at Lucie. âI remember
when our dancing master, hideous old M. Mouton,
praised me for executing my steps with elegance, I would
be in the seventh heaven.â

âBut this man was neither hideous, old, nor a dancing
master, my dear,â said Grandmamma, a little annoyed.
She took up her tatting, which had dropped upon her
silver-gray lap, as though the story were ended, and Lucieâs
face fell.

âAnd is that allâabsolutely all?â she cried.

âMademoiselle Binet woke up, and we went home to
the Faubourg St. Germain to five oâclock teaâthen the
latest novelty imported from London; and she overate
herself againâupon hot honey cake buttered to excessâand
[17]

spoiled her appetite for supper,â said Grandmamma
provokingly.

âAnd you never saw Monsieur Varolan or Monsieur
D ...âI cannot pronounce his nameâagain?â

âMonsieur Varolan I saw again, several times in fact,
for the portrait required it; and Monsieur Dunbar, quite
by accident, called at the studio on several of these occasions.â

âAnd Mademoiselle Binet? Did she always fall asleep
in the tapestry chair?â asked the little Marquise, with
arching eyebrows.

Grandmamma laughed, and her laugh was so clear, so
sweet, and so mirthful that the almost living lips of the
exquisite child portrayed upon the canvas bearing the
signature of the dead Varolan seemed to smile in sympathy.

âNo, but she was occupied for all that. Monsieur
Varolan had found out her weakness for confectionery,
and there was always a large dish of chocolate
pralines

and cream puffs for her to nibble at after that first sitting.
Poor, good creature, she conceived an immense
admiration for Varolan; and Monsieur Dunbar treated
her with a grave courtesy which delighted her. She had
always imagined Scotchmen as savages, painted blue and
feeding upon raw rabbits, she explained, until she had
the happiness of meeting him.â

âAnd heâwhat brought him from his bogs and mountains?â
asked the little Marquise. âWas he qualifying
for the diplomatic service, or studying art?â

Grandmamma turned her brilliant eyes calmly upon
the less aristocratic countenance of her daughter-in-law.
âHe was doing neither. He was staying in Paris in attendance
upon his
fiancÃ©e
, who had come over to buy her
[18]

trousseau
. I forget her nameâshe was the only daughter
of a baronet of Leicestershire, and an heiress. The
match had been made by her family. Monsieur Dunbar,
though poor, being the cadet of a great family and heir
to an ancient titleâhis brother, Lord Hailhope, having
in early youth sustained an accident in the gymnasium
which rendered him a cripple for life.â

âSo a wife with a âdotâ was urgently required!â commented
the little Marquise. âLet us hope she was not
without
esprit
and a certain amount of good looks, in the
interests of Monsieur Dunbar.â

âI saw her on the night of my first ball,â said Grandmamma,
laying down her tatting and folding her delicate,
ivory-tinted hands, adorned with a few rings of
price, upon her dove-colored silk lap. âShe had sandy
hair, much drawn back from the forehead, and pale eyes
of china-blue, with the projecting teeth which the caricatures
of âChamâ gave to all Englishwomen. Also, her
waist was rather flat, and her satin boots would have
fitted a
sapeur
; but she had an agreeable expression, and
I afterward heard her married life with Monsieur Dunbar
was fairly happy.â

âAnd Monsieur himselfâwas he as happy with her asâas
he might have been, supposing he had never visited
Parisânever called at the studio of Varolan?â asked the
little Marquise, with a peculiar intonation.

Grandmammaâs rosary was of beautiful pearls. She
let the shining things slide through her fingers meditatively
as she replied:

âMy daughter, I cannot say. We met at that ballâthe
last ball given at the Tuileries before the terrible
events of the fifteenth of July. I presented Monsieur
Dunbar to my mother. We danced together, conversed
[19]

lightly of our prospects; I felt a
serrement de cÅur
, and
he, Monsieur Dunbar, was very pale, with a peculiar expression
about the eyes and mouth which denoted violent
emotion strongly repressed. I had noticed it when
Monsieur de Courvaux came to claim my hand for the
second State quadrille. He wore his uniform as Minister
of Commerce and all his Orders.... His thick nose,
white whiskers, dull eyes, and bent figure contrasted
strangely with the fine features and splendid physique of
Monsieur Dunbar. Ah, Heaven! how I shivered as he
smiled at me with his false teeth, and pressed my hand
within his arm.... He filled me with fear. And yet
at heart I knew him to be good and disinterested and
noble, even while I could have cried out to Angus to save
me.... But I was whirled away. Everyone was very
kind. The Empress, looking tall as a goddess, despotically
magnificent in the plenitude of her charms, noticed me
kindly. I danced with the Prince Imperial, a fresh-faced,
gentle boy. Monsieur de Courvaux was much
felicitated upon his choice, and
Maman
was pleasedâthat
goes without saying. Thus I came back to Monsieur
Dunbar. We were standing together in an alcove
adorned with palms, admiring the porphyry vase, once
the property of Catherine the Great, and given by the
Emperor Alexander to the First Napoleon, when for the
first time he took my hand. If I could paint in words
the emotion that suddenly overwhelmed me!... It
seemed as though the great personages, the distinguished
crowds, the jeweled ladies, the uniformed men, vanished,
and the lustres and girandoles went out, and
Angus and I were standing in pale moonlight on the
shores of a lake encircled by mountains, looking in each
otherâs eyes. It matters little what we said, but the history
[20]

of our first meeting might have prompted the sonnet
of Arvers.... You recall it:

âMon cÅur a son secret, mon Ã¢me a son mystÃ¨re,

Un amour Ã©ternel dans un instant conÃ§u:

Le mal est sans remÃ¨de.â

â
Sans remÃ¨de
for either of us. Honor was engaged on
either side. So we parted,â said Grandmamma. âMy
bouquet of white tea-roses and ferns had lost a few buds
when I put it in water upon reaching home.â

âAndâââ

âIn three days I married Monsieur de Courvaux. As
for Monsieur Dunbarâââ

âLucie,â said the little Marquise, ârun down to the
bottom of the garden and listen for the horns!â

âMonsieur Dunbar I never saw again,â said Grandmamma,
with a smile, âand there is no need for Lucie to
run into the garden. Listen! One can hear the horns
quite plainly; the boar has taken to the openâthey are
sounding the
dÃ©buchÃ©
. What do you want, Lebas?â

The middle-aged, country-faced house-steward was
the medium of a humble entreaty on the part of one
Auguste Pichon, a forest keeper, that Madame the Marquise
would deign to hear him on behalf of the young
woman, his sister, of whom Monsieur le CurÃ© had already
spoken. This time, upon the exchange of a silent
intelligence between the two elder ladies, Mademoiselle
Lucie was really dismissed to the garden, and Pichon
and his sister were shown in by Lebas.

Pichon was a thick-set, blue-bearded, vigorous fellow
of twenty-seven, wearing a leather gun pad strapped
over his blouse, and cloth gaiters. He held his cap in
both hands against his breast as he bowed to his
[21]

masterâs mother and his masterâs wife. His sister, a
pale, sickly, large-eyed little creature, scarcely ventured
to raise her abashed glance from the Turkey carpet as
Pichon plucked at her cotton sleeve.

âWe have heard the story from Monsieur le CurÃ©,â
cried the younger lady, âand both Madame la Marquise
and myself are much shocked and grieved. Is it not so,
Madame?â

Grandmamma surveyed the bending, tempest-beaten
figure before her with a sternness of the most august, yet
with pity and interest too.

âWe did not anticipate when we had the pleasure of
contributing a little sum to your sisterâs dower, upon
her marriage with the under-gardener, Pierre Michaud,
that the union would be attended with anything but
happiness.â

âAlas! Nor did I, Madame.... I picked out
Michaud myself from half a dozen others. âHereâs a
sound, hale man of sixty,â thinks I, âwill make the girl a
good husband, and leave her a warm widow when he
diesâ; for he has a bit put by, as is well known. And she
was willing when he asked her to go before the Maire
and Monsieur le CurÃ© and sign herself Michaud instead
of Pichon. Werenât you, girl?â

No answer from the culprit but a sob.

âSo, as she was willing and Michaud was eager, the
wedding came off. At the dance, for itâs a poor foot that
doesnât hop at a wedding, what happens? Latrace, Monsieur
le Marquisâs new groom, drops in. He dances with
the bride, drops a few sweet speeches in her ear. Crac!
âTis like sowing mustard and cress.... Latrace scrapes
acquaintance with Michaudâmore fool he, with respect
to the ladiesâ presence, for when one has a drop of honey
[22]

one doesnât care to share with the wasp! Latrace takes
to hanging about the cottage. Ninette, the silly thing,
begins to gape at the moon, and when what might be
expected to happen happens, Michaud turns her out of
house and home. Whatâs more, keeps her dowry, to pay
for his honor, says he. âHonor! leave honor to gentlemen;
wipe out scores with a stick!â says I, âand eat oneâs
cabbage soup in peace.â But heâll bolt the door and stick
to the dowry, and Ninette may beg, or worse, for all he
cares. And my wife flies out on the poor thing; and
what to do with her may the good God teach me....
Madame will understand that who provides for her
keeps two! And she so young, Madame, only seventeen!â

The little Marquise uttered a pitying exclamation, and
over the face of the elder lady passed a swift change.
The exquisite faded lips quivered, the brilliant eyes under
the worn eyelids shone through a liquid veil of tears.
Rustling in her rich neutral-tinted silks, Madame rose,
went to the shrinking figure, and stooping from her
stately height, kissed Ninette impulsively upon both
cheeks.

âPoor child! Poor little one!â whispered Grandmamma;
and at the caress and the whisper, the girl
dropped upon her knees with a wild, sobbing cry, and
hid her face in the folds of what seemed to her an angelâs
robe. âLeave Ninette to us, my good Pichon,â said
Grandmamma. âFor the present the Sisters of the Convent
at Charny will take her, all expenses being guaranteed
by me, and when she is stronger we will talk of
what is to be done.â She raised the crying girl, passing
a gentle hand over the bowed head and the convulsed
shoulders. âLife is not all ended because one has made
[23]

one mistake!â said Grandmamma. âTell Madame
Pichon that, from me!â

Pichon, crushing his cap, bowed and stammered gratitude,
and backed out, leading the girl, who turned upon
the threshold to send one passionate glance of gratitude
from her great, melancholy, black eyes at the beautiful
stately figure with the gold-gray hair, clad in shining
silks and costly lace. As the door closed upon the
homely figures, the little Marquise heaved a sigh of relief.

âOuf! Pitiable as it all is, one can hardly expect anything
better. The standard of morality is elevated in
proportion to the standard of rank, the caliber of intellect,
the level of refinement. Do you not agree with
me?â

Grandmamma smiled. âAre we of the upper world so
extremely moral?â

The little Marquise pouted.

â
Noblesse oblige
is an admirable apothegm, but does
it keep members of our order from the Courts of Divorce?
My dear Augustine, reflect, and you will come
to the conclusion that there is really very little difference
in human beings. The texture of the skin, the shape of
the fingernails, cleanliness, correct grammar, and graceful
manners do not argue superior virtue, or greater
probity of mind, or increased power to resist temptation,
but very often the reverse. This poor girl married
an uninteresting, elderly man at the very moment when
her heart awakened at the sight and the voice of one
whom she was destined to love.... Circumstances, environments,
opportunities contributed to her defeat; but
I will answer for it she has known moments of abnegation
as lofty, struggles as desperate, triumphs of conscience
[24]

over instinct as noble, as delicate, and as touching
as those experienced by any Lucretia of the Rue
Tronchet or the Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©. She has been
beaten, that is all, worsted in the conflict; and it is for
us, who are women like herself, to help her to rise. But
I prose,â said Grandmamma; âI sound to myself like a
dull tract or an indifferent sermon. And Lucie must be
getting tired of the garden!â

Grandmamma moved toward the open
battants
of the
glass doors to call Mademoiselle, but arrested her steps
to answer the interrogation which rose in the eyes, but
never reached the lips, of the little Marquise. âI have
said, my dear, that we never met again. Whether Monsieur
Angus Dunbar was nobler and stronger than other
menâwhether I was braver and purer than others of my
sexâthis was a question which never came to the test.
Fate kept us apart, and something in which Monsieur le
CurÃ©, and perhaps ourselves, would recognize the hand of
Heaven!â

Grandmamma went out through the glass doors and
stood upon the
perron
, breathing the delicious air. The
sun was drowning in a sea of molten gold, the sweet
clamor of the horns came from an island in the shallow
river. âGone to the water! Gone to the water!â
they played.... And then the death of the boar was
sounded in the
hallali
. But a nobler passion than that
of the hunter, who follows and slays for the mere momentary
lust of possession, shone in the exquisite old
face that lifted to the sunset the yearning of a deathless
love.

[25]

II

The boar, a
ragot
, had met his end at the point of the
Marquisâs hunting knife, an ancestral
couteau de chasse

with a blade about three feet long. The field had dispersed,
one or two of the
valets de chien
gone after the
missing hounds, leading the decoy dogs on leashes. Afternoon
tea at the
chÃ¢teau
was a very lively affair, the
clatter of tongues, cups, and teaspoons almost deafening.
A
cuirassier
, whose polished boot had suffered abrasion
from the tusk of the wounded animal, recounted his adventure
to a circle of sympathetic ladies. A fire of
beech logs blazed on the wide hearth, the leaping flames
playing a color symphony, from peacock green to
sapphire, from ruby to orange, dying into palest lemon-yellow,
leaping up in lilac, deepening to violet, and so

da capo
.... The silver andirons had sphinx heads
adorned with full-bottomed periwigs of the period of
Louis le Grand.... The exquisite Watteaus and
Bouchers, set in the panelingâpainted white because the
little Marquise had found oak so
triste
âshone with a
subdued splendor. The perfume of fine tobacco, green
tea, and many roses, loaded the atmosphere, producing
a mild intoxication in the brain of the tall, fair, well-dressed
young fellow, unmistakably British, whom a
servant had announced as Monsieur Brown....

âMonsieur Brown?â Monsieur de Courvaux read the
card passed over to him by his wife. âWho under the
sun is Monsieur Brown?â

âFie, FrÃ©dÃ©ric!â rebuked the little Marquise. âIt is
the English tutor!â

Then they rose together and welcomed the newcomer
[26]

with hospitable warmth. Charny les Bois was hideously
difficult of access; the railway from the junction at
which one had to change was a single line, and a perfect
disgrace. Monsieur de Courvaux had long intended to
bring the questionâa burning oneâbefore the proper
authorities. Both Monsieur and Madame were horrified
to realize that Monsieur Brown had walked from the
station, where cabs were conspicuous by their absence.
A conveyance had been ordered to be sent, but at the last
moment it was wanted for the hunt. Monsieur Brown
had hunted in England, of course?

Mr. Brown admitted that he had followed the hounds
in several counties. Looking at the new tutorâs square
shoulders, sinewy frame, long, well-made limbs, and
firmly knit, supple hands, tanned like his face and throat
by outdoor exercise, Monsieur de Courvaux did not doubt
it. Brown came of good race, that was clear at the first
glance. Harrow and Oxford had added the
cachet
of
the high public school and the university. He had recommendations
from the Duke of Atholblair, who mentioned
him as the son of a dear old friend. And Atholblair
was of the old
rÃ©gime
, a great nobleman who chose
his friends with discretion. Clearly Brown would do.
His French was singularly pure; his English was the
English of the upper classes. Absolutely, Brown was the
thing. He was, he said, a Scotchman. The late Queen
of England, to whom the little Marquise had the honor
of being god-daughterâs daughter, had had a valuable attendantâalso
a Scotchmanâof the name of Brown! Did
Monsieur Brown happen to be any relation?

âUnhappily no, Madame!â said Mr. Brown, who
seemed rather tickled by the notion. He took the next
opportunity to laugh, and did it heartily. He was standing
[27]

on the bear-skin before the fireplace, measuring an
equal six feet of height with Monsieur de Courvaux,
when he laughed, and several people, grouped about a
central figureâthat of the elder Madame de Courvaux,
who sat upon a gilt
fauteuil
with her back to the great
windows, beyond which the fires of the sunset were
burning rapidly awayâthe people glanced round.

âWhat a handsome Englishman!â a lady whispered, a
tiny brunette, with eyes of jet and ebony hair, who consequently
adored the hazel-eyed, the tawny-haired, the
tall of the opposite sex. Madame de Courvaux, superb
in her laces and dove-colored silks, sat like a figure of
marble. Under her broad white brow, crowned by its
waves of gray-gold hair, her eyes, blue and brilliant still,
fixed with an intensity of regard almost devouring upon
the face of the new tutor, whom the Marquis, stepping
forward, presented to his mother with due ceremony, and
to whom, offering her white, jeweled hand, she said:

âWelcome once more to France, Monsieur Dunbar!â

âBut, Mamma,â put in Monsieur de Courvaux, as
young Mr. Brown started and crimsoned to the roots of
his tawny hair, âthe name of Monsieur is Brown, and he
has never before visited our country.â

âMonsieur Brown will pardon me!â Madame de
Courvaux rose to her full height and swept the astonished
young fellow a wonderful curtsy. âThe old are
apt to make mistakes. Andâthere sounds the dressing
gong!â

Indeed, the metallic
tintamarre
of the instrument
named began at that instant, and the great room emptied
as the chatterers and tea drinkers scurried away. A
rosy, civil footman in plain black livery showed Mr.
Brown to his room, which was not unreasonably high
[28]

up, and boasted a dressing cabinet and a bath. As
Brown hurriedly removed the smuts of the railway with
oceans of soap and water, and got into his evening
clothesâmuch too new and well cut for a tutorâhe pondered.
As he shook some attar of violetsâmuch too expensive
a perfume for a tutor, who, at the most, should
content himself with Eau de Cologne of the ninepenny
brandâupon his handkerchief, he shook his head.

âIâll be shot if she didnât, and plainly too! It wasnât
the confusion of the beastly all-night train journey from
Paris. It wasnât the clatter of French talk, or the delusion
of a guilty conscienceâdecidedly not! The thing
is as certain as it is inexplicable! I arrive under the
name of Brown at a country house in a country I donât
know, belonging to people I have never met, and the
second lady I am introduced to addresses me as Mr.
Dunbar. Thereâs the second gong! I wonder whether
there is a governess for me to take in, or whether I trot
behind my superiors, who arenât paid a hundred and fifty
pounds a year to teach English?â

And Mr. Brown went down to dinner. Somewhat to
his surprise, he was placed impartially, served without
prejudice, and conversed with as an equal. The De
Courvaux were charming people, their tutor thoughtâequal
to the best-bred Britons he had ever met. His
pupilsâthe freckled boy with hair cropped
Ã  la brosse
,
and the pretty, frank-mannered girl of sixteenâinterested
him. He was uncommonly obliged to the kind old
Duke for his recommendation; the bread of servitude
eaten under this hospitable roof would have no bitter
herbs mingled with it, that was plain. He helped himself
to an
entrÃ©e
of calvesâ tongues stewed with mushrooms,
as he thought this, and noted the violet bouquet
[29]

of the old Bordeaux with which one of the ripe-faced,
black-liveried footmen filled his glass. And perhaps he
thought of another table, at the bottom of which his
place had been always laid, and of the grim, gaunt dining-room
in which it stood, with the targets and breast-pieces,
the chain and plate mail of hisâBrownâsâforebears
winking against the deep lusterless black of the
antique paneling; and, opposite, lost in deep reflection,
the master of the house, moody, haggard, gray-moustached
and gray-haired, but eminently handsome still,
leaning his head upon his hand, and staring at the gold
and ruby reflections of the wine decanters in the polished
surface of the ancient oak, or staring straight before him
at the portrait, so oddly out of keeping with the Lord
Neils and Lord Ronalds in tartans and powdered wigs,
the Lady Agnes and the Lady Jean in hoops and stomachers,
with their hair dressed over cushions, and shepherdsâ
crooks in their narrow, yellowish hands....
That portrait, of an exquisite girlâa lily-faced, gold-haired,
blue-eyed child in the ball costume of 1870âhad
been the object of Mr. Brownâs boyish adoration.
Varolan painted it, Mr. Brownâs uncleâwhose name
was no more Brown than his nephewâsâhad often said.
And on one occasion, years previously, he had expanded
sufficiently to tell his nephew and expectant heir that
the original of the portrait was the daughter of a ducal
family of France, a star moving in the social orbit of
the Faubourg Saint-Germain, married to a Minister of
the Imperial Government a few weeks previous to that
Governmentâs collapse and fall.

âI believe the dear old boy must have been in love
with her before Uncle Ronald died, and he came in for
the family honors,â mused Mr. Brown, and then began
[30]

to wonder whether he had treated the dear old boy badly
or
vice versa
. For between this uncle and nephew, who,
despite a certain chilly stiffness and rigor of mental
bearing, often mutually exhibited by relations, were sincerely
attached to each other, a breach had opened, an
estrangement had occurred. Hot words and bitter reproaches
had suddenly, unexpectedly been exchanged, old
wrongs flaming up at a kindling word, forgotten grudges
coming to light in the blaze of the conflagration....

And so it had come to pass that the son of Lord Hailhopeâs
younger brother, named Angus after his uncle, had
not been thrown, had hurled himself upon his own resources.
And the Duke of Atholblair had found him the
place of English tutor in the family of Madame de Courvaux.

âIt is the only thing that presents itself,â the aged
peer had explained, âand therefore, my dear boy, you
had better take it until something better turns up.â

For the present. But the future? Mr. Brown wondered
whether he and the English grammar and lexiconâthe
phrase book, dictionary, and the other volumes
which constituted his tutorial equipmentâwere doomed
to grow gray and dogâs-eared, drooping and shabby together?

Then he looked up, for some one touched him upon
the arm.

âThe ladies permit us to smoke in the library, which
is the best room for music in the house,â said the pleasant
voice of Monsieur de Courvaux; âso we will take our

cafÃ©
and
chasse
in their company, if you please.â

Mr. Brown reached the door in time to open it, and
to comprehend that the act of gallantry was not expected
of him. And the feminine paroquets and the
[31]

sable-coated male rooks went by, and Mademoiselle Lucie
gave the handsome, well-groomed Englishman a shy
glance of approval from under her black eyelashes, and
Monsieur FrÃ©dÃ©ric, puffy with incipient indigestion,
grinned feebly. Brown put his hand upon the boyâs
shoulder, and followed the rest.

âYou donât want me to do any English to-night, do
you, Monsieur Brown?â young hopeful insinuated, as
they went into the long walnut-paneled room with another
bay at the southern end with blinds undrawn, revealing
a wonderful panorama of moonlit forest and
river and champaign. âI can say âall-a-raight!â âwat-a-rot!â
and âdaddle-doo!â already,â the youth continued.
âThe English groom of papa, I learned the words of him,

voyez
! You shall know Smeet, to-morrow!â

âThanks, old fellow!â said Mr. Brown, with a good-humored
smile.

âGrandmamma is making a sign that you are to go
and speak to her, Monsieur,â said Mademoiselle Lucie,
Brownâs elder pupil-elect. âEverybody in this house
obeys Grandmamma, and so must you. Mamma says it
is because she was so beautiful when she was youngâyoung,
you comprehend, as in that portrait over the fireplaceâthat
everybody fell down and worshiped her.
And she is beautiful now, is she not, sir? Not as the
portrait; butâââ

âThe portrait, Mademoiselle?... Over the fireplace....
Good Lord, what an extraordinary likeness!â
broke from Mr. Brown. For the counterpart of
the exquisite picture of Varolan that had hung in the
dining hall of the gray old northern castle where Mr.
Brownâs boyhood, youth, and earliest manhood had been
[32]

spent, hung above the hooded fifteenth-century fireplace
of the noble library of this French chÃ¢teau.

There she stood, the golden, slender, lily-faced,
sapphire-eyed young aristocrat of the Faubourg Saint-Germain,
with her indefinable air of pride and hauteur
and exclusiveness mingled with girlish merriment and
mischief. And there she satâthe original in the fleshâMadame
la Marquise de Courvaux, the Grandmamma of
these young peopleâregal in sweeping folds of amethyst
velvet and wonderful creamy Spanish point lace.

Obedient to the bidding of her fan, Mr. Brown crossed
the library and took the chair she indicated near her.
And the diamond cross upon her still beautiful bosom
moved quickly, with the beating of Grandmammaâs
heart, as he did this.

âHow like he is!âhow like!â she whispered to herself;
and the electric lights became crystal girandoles,
and the library became a ballroom at the Tuileries. The
Empress, beautiful and cold, passed down the ranks of
curtsying, bare-backed, bejeweled women and bowing,
gold-laced men. Monsieur de Courvaux, with his orders,
his bald forehead, and his white whiskers, released
mademoiselle at the claim of a tall, tawny-haired, hazel-eyed,
fair-faced partner, a Highland gentleman, in plaid
and philabeg, with sporran and claymore, the antique
gold brooch upon his shoulder set with ancient amethysts,
river pearls and cairngorms. And he told her
how he loved her, there in the alcove of palms, and heard
her little confession that, had she not been bound by a
promise of marriage to Monsieur de Courvaux she wouldâoh,
how gladly!âbecome the wife of Monsieur Angus
Dunbar.

âAs you say.... Fate has been cruel to both of us....
[33]

Andâand I am engaged. She lives in Leicestershire.
I met her one hunting season. She is in Paris,
staying at Meuriceâs with her mother now. Theyâre
buying the trousseau.... God help me!â groaned Angus
Dunbar.

But the little lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain
drew back the hand he snatched at, and swept him a
haughty little curtsy, looking straight in his face: âThe
State Quadrille is beginning. Be so good as to take me
to Mamma.... And I wish you all happiness, sir, and
your
fiancÃ©e
also.â Another little curtsy he got, poor
lad, with her âAdieu, and a thousand thanks, Monsieur!â
and thenâhe walked the dusty streets of Paris until
morning; while Mademoiselle lay sleepless on her tear-drenched
lace pillows. Andââ

Grandmamma awakened as though from a dream, to
meet the frank hazel eyes of Mr. Brown, the English
tutor.

âMonsieur will forgive the curiosity of an old woman,â
she said, with her inimitable air of grace and sweetness.
âI wished to ask whether you were not of Northern raceâa
Scot, for example? Yes? Ah, I thought I had
guessed correctly. The type is not to be mistaken, and I
once hadâa dear friend!âwhom Monsieur resembles to
identity. But his name was not Brown.â

âI was within an ace of telling her mine was not,
either,â reflected the English tutor as, an hour or so later,
he got into bed. âHow perfectly beautiful Madameânot
the
agaÃ§ante, espiÃ¨gle
little Madame, but the old oneâmust
have been in the rich prime of her womanhood!
Did she and my uncle ever meet again, I wonder? No,
I should think not. The dear old boy is just the sort of
character to hug a romance all his life, and sheâshe is
[34]

just the woman to be the heroine of one. Are all French
country-house beds in this style, and is one supposed to
draw these rosebudded chintz curtains modestly round
one, or let them alone?â Mr. Brown concluded to let
them alone, and fell very soundly asleep.

At the late breakfast, an elaborate meal, beginning
with soup and fish, and ending with tea and cakes, it
was explained to the tutor that no English lesson was to
be given that day, as a costume ball of the calico type
was to take place that evening, and the childrenâs study,
a homely, comfortable little wainscoted parlor on the
ground floor, looking out upon a grass-grown courtyard
with a bronze fountain in the middle, was to be given up
to hats, coats, and opera cloaks. Monsieur FrÃ©dÃ©ric was
to personate one of his own ancestors, page to the Duke
of Burgundy, killed in a jousting match in 1369, Monsieur
le Marquis and Madame respectively appearing as
the Chevalier de Courvaux and his lady, parents of the
youth referred to, represented in a miniature by Othea.
Mademoiselle Lucie chose to be âUndineâ in gauze and
water-lilies. For Monsieur Brown a character could
surely be found, a costume devised, even at the eleventh
hour. There were jack-boots,
salades
, and coats of mail
innumerable in the great hall, Mr. Brown, who shared
the objection of his British countrymen to being made
to appear ridiculous, shook his head. He preferred not
to dress up; but he had, or thought he had, packed away
in one of his portmanteaux (which were too numerous
for a tutor) something that would do. A Highland costume,
in fact, of the modified kind worn by gentlemen
of Caledonia as dinner dress or upon occasions of festivity.

Thus Mr. Brown unconsciously pledged himself to
[35]

bring about a crisis in the lives of two people, one of
whom was actively engaged at that moment in trying to
find him. For Lord Hailhope was genuinely attached to
his nephew, and the basis of the quarrel between them,
never very secure, had been shaken and shattered, firstly,
by the indifference manifested by the young lady concerned,
a rather plain young heiress, at the news of the
said nephewâs disappearance, and, secondly, by her marriage
with her fatherâs chaplain, a Presbyterian divine
of thunderous eloquence and sweeping predestinary convictions.

âTell him that I was in the wrongâthat I apologizeâthat
everything shall be as it was before, if he will come
back! The money shall be secured to him; I will guarantee
that,â Lord Hailhope wrote to the London solicitor
employed in the search for Young Lochinvar, who had
sprung to the saddle and ridden awayâwithout the lady.
âIf he will not come to me, I will go to him. The insult

was
gross; I admit it, and will atone to the best of my
ability!â

âThe hot-headed old Highlander!â commented the man
of law, as he filed the letter. âHe adopts the boyâhis
dead brotherâs sonâbrings him up in the expectation of
inheriting his private fortune as well as the title, and
then turns him out of doors because he wonât marry a
girl with teeth like tombstones and a fancy for another
man. If Master Angus Dunbar is wise, he will hold out
against going back until that question of the money has
been disposed of irrevocably. Though people never have
senseâlucky for my profession!â

Meanwhile, at Charny les Bois preparations for the
ballâthe materials of which owed much more to the
lordly silkworm than the plebeian cotton podâwent on
[36]

apace. Evening came, the band of the
cuirassiers
, generously
lent by Monsieur the Colonel, drove over from
the barracks in a couple of
chars-Ã -bancs
, the Colonel
and the officers of that gallant regiment, arrayed to kill
in the green and gold costumes of the hunt of the Grand
Monarque, followed upon their English
drague
.
Voitures

of every description disgorged their happy loads. Monsieur,
Madame, the young ladies and the young gentlemen,
hot, happy, smiling, and fearfully and wonderfully
disguised.

âTheir unconsciousness, the entire absence of the conviction
that they are ridiculous, makes them quite lovable,â
thought Mr. Brown. âThat fat, fair papa, with
spectacles and large sandy whiskers, as Pluton, from

OrphÃ©e aux Enfers
, in red satin tunic and black silk
tights spotted with yellow, a satin cloak with a train,
a gilt pasteboard crown and trident pleases me tremendously.
He is, I believe, a magistrate from Charny. His
wife is the even fatter and fairer lady attired as Norma,
and those three little dumpy girls, flower girls of a period
decidedly uncertain.â

âDoes not Monsieur dance?â said Mademoiselle Lucie,
looking, with her filmy green draperies, her fair locks
crowned, and her slim waist girdled with water-lilies and
forget-me-nots, a really exquisite river sprite.

âIf Mademoiselle would accord me the honor of her
hand in a valse,â Mr. Brown began; then he broke off,
remembering that in England the tutor did not usually
dance with the daughters of the houseâif, indeed, that
functionary danced at all. Butââ

âMamma has been telling me that Englishmen dance
badly,â observed Mademoiselle, with a twinkle in her
blue eyes. âGrandmamma will have it, by the way, that
[37]

you are Scotch! Do not look round for her; she was a
little fatigued by so much conversation and fuss, and
will not come down to-night.... Heavens! look at
FrÃ©dÃ©ric,â she added, in a tone of sisterly solicitude, as
the page of the Court of Burgundy moved unsteadily
into sight, clinging to the arm of a bosom friend in a
âceladonâ costume and a condition of similar obfuscation.
âAlas! I comprehend!â she continued. âThose
plums conserved in cognac have a fatal fascination for
my unhappy brother. Quick, Monsieur! make to remove
him from the view of Papa, or the consequences
will be of the most terrible.... FrÃ©dÃ©ric has been already
warned....â

And outwardly grave and sympathetic, albeit splitting
with repressed laughter, Mr. Brown went in chase of the
unseasoned vessels, and conveyed them to the safe harbor
of the small study on the second floor, which had
been allotted to him as a den. Locking them in, he was
about to descend in search of seltzer water, when, in the
act of crossing the gallery, unlighted save for the dazzling
moonlight that poured through the long mullioned
windows, giving a strange semblance of fantastic life to
the dark family portraits on the opposite wall, and lying
in silver pools upon the shining parquet islanded with
threadbare carpets of ancient Oriental woof, he encountered
the elder Madame de Courvaux, who came swiftly
toward him from the opposite end of a long gallery, carrying
a light and a book that looked like a Catholic
breviary. With the glamour of moonlight upon her, in
a loose silken dressing robe trimmed with the priceless
lace she affected, her wealth of golden-gray tresses in
two massive plaits, drawn forward and hanging over her
bosom, almost to her knees, her beauty was marvelous.
[38]

Mr. Brown caught his breath and stopped short; Madame,
on her part, uttered a faint cryâwas it of delight
or of terror?âand would have dropped her candle had
not the tutor caught it and placed it on a
console
that
stood near.

âPardon, Madame!â he was beginning, when....

âOh, Angus Dunbar! Angus, my beloved, my adored!â
broke from Madame de Courvaux. âThere is no need
that either of us should ask for pardon.â Her blue eyes
gleamed like sapphires, her still beautiful bosom heaved
and panted, her lips smiled, though the great tears
brimmed one by one over her underlids and chased down
her pale cheeks. âWe did what was right. The path of
honor was never easy. You married, and I also, and all
these years no news of you has reached me. But I understand
now that you are dead, and bound no longer by
the vows of earth, and that you have come, brave as of
old, beautiful as of old, to tell me that you are free!â

With an impulse never quite to be accounted for, Angus
Dunbar, the younger, stepped forward and enclosed
in his own warm, living grasp Madameâs trembling
hands....

âMy name is Angus Dunbar, Madame,â he said, âbutâbut
I believe you must be speaking of my uncle. He
succeeded to the peerage twenty years ago; he is now
Lord Hailhope, but heâhe never married, though I believe
he loved, very sincerely and devotedly, a lady
whose portrait by Varolan hangs in the dining-room at
Hailhope, just as it hangs in the library here at Charny
les Bois.â

âIâI do not understand.... How comes it thatâââ
Madame hesitated piteously, her hands wringing
each other, her great wistful eyes fixed upon the
[39]

splendid, stalwart figure of the young man. âYou are
so like.... And the costumeâââ

âIt is customary for Highland gentlemen to wear the
kilt at social functions; and when I left Hailhopeâor,
rather, was turned out of doors, for my uncle disowned
me when I refused to marry a girl who did not care for
me, and who has since married to please herselfâGregor
packed it in one of my kit cases. The cat is out of the
bag as well as the kilt.... I came here as English
tutor to your grandchildren, Madame, at the suggestion
of an old friend, the Duke of Atholblair, to whom I told
the story of the quarrel with my uncle.â

Madame began to recover her courtly grace and self-possession.
Her hands ceased to tremble in Dunbarâs
clasp; she drew them away with a smile that was only a
little fluttered.

âAnd I took you for a ghost ... a
revenant
.... I
was a little agitated.... I had been suffering from an
attack of the nerves.... Monsieur will make allowances
for a superstitious old woman. To-morrow, after
breakfast, in the garden Monsieur will explain the whole
story to meâhow it came that Monsieur Dunbar, his
uncle, now Lord Hailhopeâah, yes! there was a crippled
elder brother of that titleâdisowned his nephew for refusing
to give his hand to one he did not love.... I
should have imaginedââ Good-night, Monsieur!â

In the garden, after breakfast, Angus Dunbar, no
longer handicapped by the plebeian name of Brown, told
his story to a sympathetic listener. Madameâs head was
bentâperhaps her hearing was not so good as it had
been when, more than forty years previously, Angus
Dunbar, the elder, had whispered his secret in that delicate
ear. But as footsteps sounded upon the terrace, and
[40]

one of the fresh-faced, black-liveried footmen appeared,
piloting a stranger, a tall, somewhat stern-featured, gray-moustached
gentleman, she started and looked round. In
the same moment the late Mr. Brown jumped up, over-setting
his chair, the pugs barked, andââ

âI owed it to you to make the first move,â said Lord
Hailhope, rather huskily, as the uncle and nephew
grasped hands. âForgive me, Angus, my dear boy!â

âLady Grisel has married the Presbyterian minister,
sir, and weâre all going to be happy for ever after, like
people in a fairy tale,â said Angus Dunbar. Then he
turned to Madame de Courvaux, and bowed with his
best grace. âMadame, permit me to present my uncle,
Lord Hailhope, who I believe has had the honor of meeting
you before!â

And, being possessed of a degree of discretion quite
proper and desirable in a tutor, Mr. Angus Dunbar
moved away in the direction of a rose walk, down which
Mademoiselle Lucieâs white gown had flitted a moment
before, leaving the two old lovers looking in each otherâs
eyes.

[41]

AN INDIAN BABY

WHEN old Lovelace-Legge sank into a stertorous
final coma which his lovely marble tombstone
called by a much prettier name, and the blinds were
drawn up after a decent interval, and a tremendous
heraldic joke, furnished by Heraldsâ College, was dismounted
from over the front door, Mrs. Lovelace-Legge,
after the requisite period of seclusion, took an exquisite
little gem of a house in Sloane Street, furnished it to a
marvel, and began, with discreetness, to enjoy herself.
All her affairs flourished, her pet plans prospered, her
gratifications were many, her disappointments nil; people
began to call her âLucky Lotta Legge.â She took
her good fortune as her due.

âPerhaps she feels she deserves something of Providence
for putting up patiently with old Lovelace-Legge
during those ten awful years,â said Lady Cranberry, her
dearest friend, to another just a shade less dear, as they
walked up Sloane Street one fine morning.

âI suppose he
was
awful?â hazarded the second-best
beloved.

Lady Cranberry crumpled her eyebrows. âHe had a
complexion like New Zealand meat,â she said. âNext
time you walk up the Kingâs Road with Lotta, watch her
as you pass a cheap butcherâs shop. She will wince and
look the other way, and you may guess what she is
thinking of, poor darling!â

[42]
âShe said to me once,â remarked the second-best one,
ââ
I always fretted for children, but perhaps they were
wisely withheld.
ââ

âI should think so,â consented Lady Cranberry.
âWhen there is a chance of an infantâs coming into the
world with three chins and a nose like Punch, to say
nothing of bandy legs and patent shoes like bicycle gear
casesâââ

The second-best reminded Lady Cranberry that children
were not usually born with shoes.

âOf course, I meant feet,â said Lady Cranberry. âFeet
of that size and flatness, too. And if there is the merest
chance of a childâs coming into the world thus handicapped,
it is infinitely better that the child should keep
out of it. Here we are at Lottaâs door. Isnât that cream
enamel with the old Florentine copper-embossed knocker
and bells too divine for anything? Great Heavens!â

She had evidently received a shock, for she was paler
than her powder, and as she clutched her companionâs
arm her eyes were fixed in quite a ghastly stare.

âMercy!â the next best-beloved friend of the owner of
the cream-white door with the Florentine copper work
adjuncts exclaimed, âyou saw somethingâwhat?â

But Lady Cranberry, with more energy than her weak
state seemed to warrant, had ascended Mrs. Lovelace-Leggeâs
brown doorsteps, and was plying the Florentine
knocker. The servant who responded to the summons
thought that Mrs. Lovelace-Legge was at home, but
knew her to be profoundly engaged.

âTake up the names. We will wait,â said Lady Cranberry.
Then, as the respectful servant went upstairs, she
drew her companion into the shelter of a little reposeful
niche, in Liberty draperies and Indian carved wood,
[43]

where palms and things flourished in pots, and an object
of familiar shape, in bamboo work, and newly freed
from swathings of brown paper, stood upon a table. To
this she pointed with a neatly gloved forefinger that
trembled with emotion.

âOh! Why,â cried the other, âit is
A BABYâS CRADLE
!â

âIt was delivered,â said Lady Cranberry, âat this door
as we came up. It cannot be for a doll: it is full-sized.
What on earth can Lotta want with such a thing?â

As she uttered these words the servant returned. His
mistress begged the ladies to come upstairs. He delivered
his message, and then, with well-trained gravity,
lifted the compromising cradle and led the way upstairs.
Mrs. Lovelace-Legge did not purpose to receive her
friends in the drawing-room, it appeared, or even on the
floor above, where her bedroom and boudoir were situated.
The ladies were conducted by their guide to regions
more airy still; indeed, their progress knew no
pause until they reached the highest landing. Here Lady
Cranberry received another shock, for a gaily-painted
wooden gate, newly hung, gave access to a space where
a rocking-horse stood rampant in all the glory of bright
paint and red leather trappings; and beyond, through an
open door, shone a glimpse of an infantile Paradise, all
rosebud dimity, blue ribbons, and brightness, in the midst
of which moved Mrs. Lovelace-Legge radiant in a lawn
apron with Valenciennes insertion, issuing directions to
a head nurse of matronly proportions, an under-nurse of
less discretionary years, and a young person dressed in
blue baize, trimmed with red braid and buttons, whose
functions were less determinable.

âMy dears!â Mrs. Lovelace-Legge fluttered to her
friends and kissed them, and nothing save Lady Cranberryâs
[44]

imperative need of an explanation kept that lady
from swooning on the spot. âYou find me all anyhow,â
said Lotta, with beaming eyes. âBut comeâcome and
look.â She pioneered the way into the room beyond,
with its Lilliputian fittings, its suggestive cosiness, its
scent of violet powder and new flannel. âDo you think
he will be happy here?â she asked, with a tender quasi-maternal
quaver of delightful anticipation.

âWho isâHe?â

Lady Cranberry hardly recognized her own voice, so
transformed was it by the emotions she suppressed; but
Mrs. Lovelace-Legge noticed nothing. âWho?â she
echoed, and then laughed with moist, beaming eyes.
âWho but the baby? Is it possible I havenât told you?
Or Lucy?â The second-best-beloved shook her head.
âNo. You seeâthe news of his coming was broken so
suddenly that I was carried off my feet, and since then
Iâve done nothing but engage nurses and buy baby
things. This is Mrs. Porterââshe turned to the matronly
personââwho will have entire charge of my petâwhen
he arrives; and this is Susan, her assistant. Thisââshe
indicated the anomaly in blue baize and red braidââis
Miss Pilsener, from the Brompton Kindergarten. She
is going to teach me how to open his littleâ
little
mind,
and be everything to him from the very beginning!â

âWonât you open
our
little minds?â implored the second-best
friend. âYou know we are in a state of the
darkest ignorance.â

Mrs. Lovelace-Legge dismissed her attendants, and
made her friends sit down on the nursery sofa, and sank
into a low nursing-chair. She absently tried on an india-rubber
apron as she spoke, and it was plain her heart
was with the invisible infant. âAsk me questions,â she
[45]

said. âI donât seem able to keep my thoughts concentrated
on anything butâbaby!â

âYou must understand, Lotta,â said Lady Cranberry,
âthat to find you in possession ofââshe gulpedââa baby
is a shock in itself to your most intimate friends. And
in the name of your regard for Lucy, supposing myself
to have no claim upon your confidence, I must ask you
to explain how you come to be in possession of such aâsuch
a thing? And toâto whom it belongsâand where
it is coming from?â

âI came into possession of baby through a dear
friend,â explained Mrs. Lovelace-Legge. She added:
âPerhaps you have heard of General CarabyneâLieutenant-General
Ranford Carabyne of the Ordnance Department,
Calcutta?â

Her friends replied simultaneously: âNever!â

âHe is the father of my child,â continued Mrs. Lovelace-Legge,
âand, I am given to understand, a charming
person!â

Lady Cranberryâs lips moved soundlessly. She might
have been breathing a prayer for patience.

âThe General,â went on Lotta, âmarried my old school-fellow,
Julia Daubeny, in the spring of last year. He
had already been marriedâin fact, had been twice a
widowerâwhen Julia met him at a Garrison Gymkhana.
It was a case of love at first sight, and I gave Julia her
trousseau as my wedding present. And now she is sending
me home the Generalâs babyâthe child of his last
wifeâas it cannot stand the climate, and she knows how
I dote on little children.â

âHow old is this child?â queried Lady Cranberry.

Mrs. Lovelace-Legge produced a thin crackling envelope
from her pocket, and unfolded Mrs. Carabyneâs
[46]

letter. âJulia always writes without punctuation, and all
her capitals are in the wrong places,â she said, apologizing
for the hesitation with which she attacked the
scrawled pages. ââ
I forgot to mention
,ââ wrote Julia,
ââ
that the General has one son quite a darling and a
favorite with everybody. He was christened Dampierre.
There is French blood on the motherâs side, but everybody
calls him âDumps.â He has the sweetest nature
and splendid teeth until about six months oldââ
ââ

âIncoherent, isnât she, rather?â hinted Lady Cranberry.

ââ
Six months old when he was thrown out of his bamboo-cart
ââAnglo-Indian
for perambulator, I supposeââ
thrown
out of his bamboo-cart with a woman who had
got hold of him at the time a most dreadful creature
and sustained a severe concussion of the brain. You will
gather by this that the poor dear is inclined to be more
than a little child.
ââ

âIs not the sense of that ratherâinvolved?â

Mrs. Lovelace-Legge held out the letter.

âIt is âchildâ or else âwild,ââ Lady Cranberry said,
dropping her eyeglasses.

âAs if an infant of six months old could be called
âwildâ!â giggled Mrs. Lovelace-Legge. She read on:

ââ
Now the doctors have positively ordered him home,
and we have not the least idea where to send him. In
this dilemma I thought of you. The General shakes his
head, but I have carried my point, and Dumps and his
nurse sail by the âRamjowrahâ next Thursday, and when
arrived in London will come straight to you. I have
every faith in your goodness of heart, and know that poor
dear Dumps could be placed in charge of no kinder
[47]

friend. He is extremely affectionateâfrom pursuits
which ruin many of the most promising young.
ââ

âHumph!â ejaculated the puzzled Lady Cranberry.

âPerhaps Julia means tearing his clothes and sucking
the paint off his toys?â suggested the second-best dearest
friend.

Mrs. Lovelace-Legge read on: ââ
Men in India if you
have read Rudyard Kipling I need not be more definite
we shall look to your gentle influence to wean him.
ââ

âOne thing at least is clear,â remarked Lady Cranberry.
âThe child is not yet weaned. As to your correspondentâs
style, Lottaâââ She said no more, but in
her mind she harbored a most definite conviction that
Julia Carabyne drank. âEau de Cologne or red lavender,â
she thought, âor pure, unadulterated cognac. I pity
the General from my heart!â

A few more confused and comma-less paragraphs, and
the letter wound up.

âYou think I did right?â Mrs. Lovelace-Legge glanced
round at her preparations. âBut, indeed, I had no choice.
How could any woman with a heartâand a nurseryâââ

âBoth unoccupied?â said Lady Cranberry.

âClose her doors against a little sick baby, coming all
the way from India in a nurseâs arms? The bare idea
strikes one as horrible! Besides, the poor darling may
arrive at any moment!â Mrs. Lovelace-Legge dried her
pretty eyes with a fragment of gossamer cambric, and
thenârat-tatter, tatter,
TAT
! went the hall-door knocker.

The three ladies started to their feet. Mrs. Lovelace-Legge
rushed to the window.

âCan it be?â

âThe babyâarrived?â...

âIt has! I see the top of a cab piled with luggage!â
[48]

cried Mrs. Lovelace-Legge, leaning eagerly from the
nursery window. âI can make out the Harries Line label
on the portmanteauxâââ

The second-best friend joined her at the casement.

âOne thing puzzles me,â she said, peering downward.
âWould a child of that age travel with gun-cases and a
bicycle?â

âThey may belong to a passenger friend who promised
to see the dear child delivered safely into my hands. Ah,
here is Simmons!â

Simmons it was, with a salver and a card. He wore a
peculiar, rather wild expression, and his countenance was
flushed and somewhat swollen; perhaps with the effort of
climbing so many stairs. All three ladies hurried to
meet him.

âHeâitâtheâââ

â
They
have arrived?â gasped little Mrs. Lovelace-Legge.

Simmons bowed his head. His mistress could not
speak. She took the card without looking at it, and
turned away.

âShow them up here!â commanded Lady Cranberry,
sympathetically comprehending Lottaâs emotion.

âAnd pay the cabman,â added the second-best friend.

Left together, the three women broke out into anticipatory
ejaculations:

âThe pet!â

âThe wumpsy!â

âWill it be pretty?â

âOh, I hope so! But even if it is not,â cried little Mrs.
Lovelace-Legge, clasping her hands, âI feel that I shall
love it. Ought weââher eyebrows crumpled inquiringlyââought
[49]

we to give it a warm bath at once? Where is
Nurse?â

Nurse and her understrapper appeared on the scene
with the young lady from the Kindergarten. Six eager
feminine heads were projected over the balusters of the
top landing as masculine footsteps creaked upon the
staircase, and a tall young man, dressed in a rough
yachting suit of blue serge, raised his eyesâa handsome
and ingenuous pairâand blushed under the salvo of
optical artillery which greeted his appearance. Behind
him followed a grizzled, middle-aged person, evidently a
soldier-servant in mufti.

âIâI presume ...,â the young gentleman began, âIâI
have the honor....â

âI am Mrs. Lovelace-Legge,â cried the charming
widow, craning forward, âand whereâoh, where is the
baby?â

The young man turned pale. âTheâthe baby?â

âHavenât you brought it?â cried all the ladies.

Tears welled up in Mrs. Lovelace-Leggeâs lovely eyes.

âDonât tell me it is dead!â she gasped. âOh, if that
were true, how could I break the news to Julia and General
Carabyne?â

âMadam,â stammered the young gentleman, âI am
the only son of General CarabyneâDampierre Carabyne.â
He blushed again. âPeople usually call me
âDumps,ââ he said, and broke off as all six women
screamed at once:

â
You! You the baby!
â

And the nurses flung their clean cambric aprons over
their heads, and rushed in titters from the scene, as poor
little Mrs. Lovelace-Legge went into screaming hysterics
in the arms of her second-dearest friend.

[50]
âIt is all a ridiâa ridiculous misunderstanding!â
gasped Lady Cranberry, an hour later, as the recovered
hostess, her friends, and her newly-arrived guest sat together
in the drawing-room. âLet him see Mrs. Carabyneâs
letter, Lotta. Perhaps he will be able toââ No!
Better give it to me.â She mounted her gold eyeglasses
upon her aquiline nose, and conned the Runic
scroll a while. âWe were misled,â she explained to the
young man, âprincipally by a reference to your nurse.â

âMolloy
is
my nurse,â explained Mr. Dampierre Carabyne.
âHe was one of the hospital orderlies at Calcutta,
and looked after me when I was ill. And the Pater
thought it best that he should valet me on the voyage,
being a useful, experienced kind of man.â

âAs to this illness you speak of?â said Lady Cranberry.

âIt happened six months ago....â

âAgo! I see a glimmer,â said Lady Cranberry.

âWhen I was thrown out of a bamboo-cart in which I
was driving a friend of mineâa very great friend.â

Again the young man colored.

â
The woman who had got hold of him
,â murmured
Lady Cranberry to herself. âAnd â
more than a little
child
â means â
more than a little wild
.â I should have
seen
that
in his eye without a hint from Mrs. Carabyne.â

Thus, bit by bit, the determined lady translated Juliaâs
letter, which ran as follows:

âHe was christened Dampierre (there is French blood
on the motherâs side); but everybody calls him âDumps.â
He has the sweetest nature, and splendid health until six
months ago, when he was thrown out of his bamboo-cart
with a woman who had got hold of him at the timeâa

Lady Cranberry took off her

nook by the fireplace, where the pretty widow, entrenched
behind the barricade of her afternoon tea-table, was
making but a feeble show of resistance to the raking fire
of Dumpsâs handsome eyes. In such a mood such a
woman as Lady Cranberry shares a corner of the mantle
of the Prophets. It occurred to her that the infantile
Paradise upstairs might not, if all went merrily as marriage
bells, remain so very long untenanted.

YVONNE

In Two Parts

I

A MILE or so north of the fishy little Breton harbor
town of Paimpol, the hamlet of Pors Lanec is represented
by a scattered cluster of low-pitched, straggling
cottages built of gray granite boulders splashed with yellow
lichen, their thatch of furze and reeds or broom-bush
secured by lashings of rope, and heavy flagstones
from the fierce assaults of the western gales. One in
especial stands on an incline trending toward the beach,
below the level of the Paimpol road. Its rear wall is
formed by a low cliff against which it has been built,
and which, rearing some twenty feet above the level of
its shaggy brown roof, and throwing out a natural buttress
toward the sea, protects the poor dwelling from the
icy northern winds. Three uneven steps, worn by the
feet of generations of fisher-dwellers, lead to the door,
whose inner latch is lifted by a length of rope-yarn,
reeved through a hole. On each side of the door a window
has been hollowed out in the solid masonry of the
wall, and roughly glazed; and beneath the rude slate
ledge of each is a weather-beaten bench of drift-oak,
blackened by age and usage. The door standing open
gives a glimpse of the usual Breton interior, bunches of
[53]

dried herbs, nets, and baskets depending from the blackened
rafters, carved sleeping-bunks set about the walls,
a few quaint pewter and copper flagons hanging on pegs
driven into the chimney, and reflecting the leaping blaze
of the pine and beechwood branches burning on the
hearth.

I do not know who lives in Mademoiselle Yvonneâs
cottage now, but a year ago the western gale was churning
the gray sea into futile anger, and thrashing the
stunted bushes into a more bending shape. The sky was
somber as the sea, with eastward-hurrying drifts of slaty
cirrus, which separated to reveal pale, sun-washed sky-spaces,
and closed again, making the gloom seem deeper
than before.

It was the eighth of December, the Feast of the
Immaculate Conceptionâthe day of the Pardon des Islandaisâand
the morning Angelus was ringing from the
storm-beaten little chapel on the heights above, where
nosegays of artificial flowers and strings of shells adorned
the image of Our Lady of Good Help, and white-capped
women, and rugged-faced, long-haired men knelt, rapt
and serious, on the sandy stone pavement. Others were
hurrying into Paimpol, where the streets were decorated
with white sheets bordered with holly and ivy leaves in
readiness for the procession. And a fine, icy rain was
driving before the wind, and Yvonneâs tables and chairs
stood out of doors while their owner beat and scrubbed
them vigorously with a birch-broom dipped in soap-suds.

âShe works upon the
fÃªte
day, yes; but for all that she
is no heretic, the poor Yvonne,â a passer-by explained to
a companionâa stranger who showed surprise at the
unusual spectacle. âAll days are alike to herâand Our
Lady understands.â

[54]
The speaker, a brown-faced, vigorous woman of fifty,
paused on the pathway, littered with brown trails of
slippery seaweed, and cried:

âHey! So youâre not going with us to Paimpol,
Mademoiselle Yvonne?â

Mademoiselle Yvonne ceased flogging her table, and
turned her face toward the questioner. It was a full,
straight-featured, rather massive face, framed in the
shell-fluted cap worn by unmarried women. The brows
were broad, and from under the straight eyebrows looked
a pair of eyes that were blue and clear and candid as
those of the little boy who clung to the skirts of the
woman who addressed her. As she drew herself up, resting
on her birch-broom, it might be seen that she was
tall and deep-chested and broad-bosomed, and that the
massive plaits of hair coiled upon her temples were gray.

âGoing to Paimpol! Sure, it is impossible,â said
Mademoiselle Yvonne. âThere is so much to do getting
the house ready.â A rich deep color flushed her cheeks,
staining her temples and tinting her full throat to the
edge of her bodice. âWhen one is to be married, Madame
understandsâââ

âSo then! You have heard?â cried the neighbor with
an elaborate pantomime of delight at the good news.
âYou have had a letter from Iceland at last?â

The clear blue eyes looked troubled for a moment.

âNo. Not that,â said Mademoiselle Yvonne. âNot
precisely a letter, but I have made out why the
Marie au
Secours
delays so long. You see, they must have had a
great catch at the cod-fisheries, and, being a man of
brains, my Yann set out to make the most of his good
luck. So the
Marie au Secours
will have merely touched
at Paimpol, and then sailed down to the Gulf of Gascony,
[55]

where fish fetch high prices, or even to the Sandy Isles.â
One of her massive plaits, released by her vigorous
movements from the confining pin, uncoiled and fell
below her waist. âThat is how it will have been, Madame
Pilot!â exclaimed Yvonne, smiling and coiling up the
beautiful hair.

âWithout doubt, that is how it will have been!â
assented the other.

She drove her stout elbow into the ribs of the woman
who had whispered to her. âNot so loud! We people of
the coast have sharper ears than you folks from inland.â

âWhen did he sail?â

âTwenty years ago, when she was eighteen, and all
that gray hair gold.â

âPfui! There was a blast!â

âWe shall have to pick the windâs bones all the way to
Paimpol. So good-day, Mademoiselle.... Gaos, run
and bid Mademoiselle Yvonne good-day.â

Madame Pilot nudged the other woman again, as
much as to say: âWatch her with the child!â

Gaos obediently quitted his motherâs skirts, and
Yvonne knelt down to kiss him. She whispered in the
childâs ear coaxingly, and, as he hesitated, watched the
innocent lips as though her fate in some inexplicable way
hung upon their utterance.

âShe always tries to get him to say it, and he never
will!â said Madame Pilot under her breath.

âWhat?â mouthed the inland woman, with round, interested
eyes.

The child spoke at that moment loudly and clearly.

âHe will come back to-day!â

âLord above! if he hasnât said it!â cried Madame
[56]

Pilot, and crossed herself under her ample cloak as the
boy came running to her.

She caught his hand, and clattered on in her heavy
wooden shoes, fighting her way resolutely against the
wind, followed more slowly by the gaping inlander.

âYou rogue! You little villain!â she cried to the child
she dragged. âWhat made you say it?â

âBe-be-causeâbubâbubâbooâbecause itâs true!â
roared Gaos, through angry sobs.

His mother, with a hasty invocation of her patron
saint, dropped his hand, stopped where the beach-pathway
merged in the Paimpol road, and looked back.
Mademoiselle Yvonne was nowhere to be seen at first,
but presently her figure mounted into view climbing the
pathway to the chapel.

âShe has gone to burn a candle for her good news,â
said Madame Pilot. âNow which have I for a son ...
a liar or a prophet? If one were to mistake and smack
the prophet, itâs enough to bring a judgment down....â
She shook her head mournfully. âBut it is to be
prayed for, all the same, that that great rogue Yann may
never come wheedling back. Drowned, did you suppose?
Dead? Not a bit of it!... Heâs living on the fat of
the land in Ploubazou, where he landed his last cargo of
fish nineteen years ago, married a tavern-keeperâs daughter,
and set up a sailorâs drinking-house himself; âThe
Chinese Cider Cellars,â they call it. May Heaven punish
such vagabonds!â panted Madame Pilot. âAs for us in
Pors Lanec, weâre peace-lovers and law-abiders, but there
are stones and cudgels waiting for Monsieur Yann Tregnier
whenever he shows his nose here.â

Madame Pilot stopped, as a broad-shouldered young
man in a sailorâs cap and pilot-cloth jacket came tramping
[57]

toward her along the puddly Paimpol road, whistling
a cheerful tune. He wore thick town-made brogues instead
of wooden
sabots
, and saluted the women in the
country fashion, though to him personally they were
unknown, and passed by, leaving the mother of the possible
prophet staring; for he was known to her as the
son of the Ploubazou tavern-keeper Yann Tregnier,
christened Jean-Marie after his motherâs father. He was
a well-looking, sturdy young fellow of eighteen, who
had always hankered to join the Icelanders, as the cod-trawlers
are called, and sail with the yearly fleet on the
last day of February for the big, dangerous fisheries in
the icy regions where the summers have no night. But
Yann, his father, would not hear of it, and Jean-Marie
had been apprenticed to a cooper in Paimpol. He had
grumbled, but his fate appeared less hard now that he
was in love with Gaud. Gaud lived with an aunt in the
village of Pors Lanec, a place Jean-Marie knew as yet
only by hearsay, since her parents lived in Paimpol, and
she had met her lover while upon a visit to them. Pors
Lanec lay by the beach a mile or two from Paimpol,
Gaud had told him. The cottage was built against a
great rock, the doorstep was the beach, and the sea the
duck-pond before the door; he could not fail to recognize
the place, Gaud had described it so clearly.

Gaud was a little delicate creature, with hair of burning
gold hidden under her shell cap, and great violet-gray
eyes, full of possible adoration for any likely young
fellow who should come wooing to Pors Lanec, and the
likely young fellow had come along in the person of
Jean-Marie. And he had won her promise, and meant
to marry her and settle down to the cooperâs trade in
earnest. True, the girl was without a dower, and his
[58]

father, with whom he had had a talk at Ploubazou last
Sunday, had pulled a long lip at that piece of information,
and he had said to the old man straight out:
âEither I get Gaud or go to sea!â

âEither I get Gaudâor go to sea!â Jean-Marie repeated
now in the most deep and manly voice he had at
command. For the cottage built against the cliff had
come in sight, a dwelling so weather-worn and lichen-stained
that it might have been an excrescence upon the
side of the rock that sheltered it. âEither I get Gaud....â
Jean-Marie squared his shoulders, and marched
down upon the cottage where Gaud lived. As his firm
footsteps crossed the plateau of sandy rock that lay before
the cottage door he heard a cry from within, and
before he could lift a hand to the rope-yarn of the latch,
the door was pulled violently back, thrown open, and a
woman fell upon his breast with a sobbing shriek of joy.

âYann! Oh, my beloved, at last!â

âMadame!â he stuttered.

âOur Lady sent me word you would return to-day, and
even as I was upon my way to thank her for such grace,
I turned back thinking. âIf he should come and miss
me!ââ

The wind blew shrilly; the sky grew black with storm.
Jean-Marieâs cheek was wet with rain or the womanâs
tears. He was conscious of a dizziness. It was as though
a web of some strange tissue were weaving in the chambers
of his brain, and the pattern grew more and more
familiar. The arms that clasped him were not those of
a stranger; the heart that throbbed upon his own had
rested there before. Even the cottage interior shown
through the low doorway was familiar, and the oaken
[59]

benches to right and left, had he not carved his name
on one of them, his and anotherâs?

But even as these strange questions awakened in the
mind of the young man, he was thrust violently back,
and Yvonne was gazing, with still streaming eyes, at the
face of a stranger, while, partly hidden by the tall figure
of her aunt, appeared the little shrinking figure of
Mademoiselle Gaud!

âWho is it?â asked Yvonne dully, without removing
her eyes from that unknown face of the man whose step
was like Yannâs.

âIâI believeâI thinkââtis Monsieur Jean-Marie,â
panted Gaud. âSweet St. Agnes!â she prayed inwardly
to her patron saint, âmake her not ask me his other
name! If she does I am sure I shall lie and say I do
not know; so, sweetest St. Agnes, preserve me from sinning!â
Next moment she breathed freely, for Yvonne
stepped aside, leaving the threshold free to the stranger.

âAsk of his business, little one!â she said, without
looking at Gaud, âand let him know that he was mistaken
for one who has a right to be welcomed with open
arms.â

She had a black woollen cloak loosely thrown about
her shoulders. She sat down upon the seat to the right
of the door, her elbow on her knee, her chin upon her
hand, the dark folds half concealing the noble outlines of
her form, her eyes fixed upon the most distant turn in
the Paimpol road.

Jean-Marie was at liberty to proceed with his courting;
Yvonne seemed to hear and see him no longer. Only
as the lover grew gayer, and the clear laugh of Gaud
sounded in unison with his, a quiver passed over the
face of Yvonne. At twelve oâclock, when the dinner was
[60]

ready, Gaud came dutifully to tell her. She only shook
her head, and the midday meal of salt fish, potatoes, and
cider was shared by the lovers.

When the dishes were washed, Jean-Marie proposed a
stroll to the chapel on the cliff. Gaud, her pale cheeks
tipped with a little crimson, like the leaves of a daisy,
came to ask Yvonneâs permission.

âMy mother allowed him to visit us in Paimpol,â she
said meekly, flushing deeper as she remembered that she
had introduced him as Monsieur Jean-Marie, the cooperâs
apprentice, and that her mother knew nothing of his relationship
to the man who had used her Aunt Yvonne so
wickedly. Through the crystal of Gaudâs nature ran a
little streak of deceptiveness. Like all weak things, she
could be cunning where her love or her interest was concerned,
and what did it matter what Jean-Marieâs father
had done? she argued. He was not Jean-Marie. So she
and her sweetheart set out upon their walk, keeping a
decorous distance of at least six feet between them, and
swinging unoccupied hands that, when the path grew
narrow, would meet and cling. And Yvonne saw two
figures appear in the distance upon the Paimpol road,
neither of which caused her any emotion. Monsieur
Blandon, the Paimpol doctor, was hirpling out upon his
old white mare, to visit some of his Pors Lanec patients;
half an hour must elapse before he could dismount at
Yvonneâs door, the mare was so old and the road so
stony. She looked away, far out to sea, and watched a
tossing white sail upon the inky horizon, and with the
instinct of one bred by the sea knew that there would
be weather yet more stormy, for the seagulls and kittiwakes
were hurrying inland. Then a heavy pair of
wooden shoes clacked over the stones, and a vinous voice
[61]

gave her âgood-day.â It was one Piggou Moan, once a
smart young fisherman and avowed rival of Yann, now
the smuggler, the loafer, the drunkard of the hamlet.

âA drop oâ cider, Mademoiselle Yvonne, for old friendshipâs
sake and charity,â begged the toper. Yvonne
scarcely looked at him, but made a slight motion of her
hand toward the cottage door. With a slobbered blessing,
red-nosed, ragged Piggou lurched in, lucky in the
absence of Gaud, who would have found enough courage,
at need, to have driven him forth with a broomstick. He
reached a copper flagon from its peg, and went as if by
instinct to the cider-cask that stood by the great, carved
clothes-press. Minutes passed, and Piggou came out,
brighter of eye if redder of nose than when he entered,
wiping his dripping beard on his ragged sleeve.

âItâs long since you and Piggou had a crack together,
Mademoiselle Yvonneâyears it is, and years! Iâm not
as fine a fellow as I used to be, though youâre a comely
figure of a woman still. Excuse the freedom, Mademoiselle!...â

She looked at the drunkard with cold dislike, and
moved toward the farther end of the bench as his
liquored breath and flaming face came near her.

II

Piggou took the movement of Yvonne toward the end
of the bench as an invitation, and sat down, as the
doctor, hidden by a bend in the road, hirpled nearer on
his old white mare.

âI bear no malice,â the toper went on, âthough, I take
the saints to witness, what I am I owe to you, Mademoiselle
[62]

Yvonneâfor being so handsome and so proud, for
giving me the back of your hand, and the whole of your
heart to Monsieur Yann Tregnier, who went away with
it and never came back.â

âHe is coming back!â said Yvonne quietly, her eyes
upon the most distant turn of the Paimpol road.

Piggou chuckled drunkenly.

âSo youâve said, Mademoiselle, for twenty years, since
the
Marie au Secours
sailed for Iceland, Captain Yann
aboard her.â

She repeated: âHe is coming back to-night!â

Piggou leered drunkenly.

âCome, my old gossip, my handsome Yvonne, donât
play the fool with Daddy Piggou. Youâre not so cracked
as you pretend to be, dâye comprehend me? You know
this waiting gameâs a farce. He, your Yann, wonât come
back; not because heâs dead, but because heâs alive.
Alive and married to Louet Kergueven, that he had an
eye on because of her dadâs money; and theyâve as many
children as peas in a podâthe eldest as fine a lad of
eighteen as ever trod in his fatherâs footsteps all the
ways to Pors Lanec. Didnât I see him just now with that
little white cat, Mademoiselle Gaud....â

The rest was strangled in the drunkardâs throat as
upon the whitewashed wall behind him fell the stout
shadow of Dr. Blandon, and the serviceable horn handle
of an old-fashioned hunting-crop wielded by an arm still
muscular hooked itself in Piggouâs cravat and plucked
him from his seat. He sprawled, spluttering oaths.

âBegone, rascal! and if I ever hear of your trying this
again, Iâll poison you next time I catch you in hospital,â
foamed the doctor.

[63]
âWhy shouldnât one tell the truth and shame the
devil!â grunted Piggou.

âWould you like me to tell Messieurs les Douaniers at
the Paimpol Quay House the truth about those fine cod
you were carrying when I met you last month on the
road to Ploubazou? Ten whopping fellows, each with a
box of prime Habanas in his gullet, and every box
wrapped round in Spanish lace?... Be off with you!â
And, assisted by some additional impetus from the toe
of the doctorâs riding-boot, Piggou scrambled to his feet
and clattered away.

Yvonne had not stirred while this little scene was
in action. Her elbow on her knee, her chin upon her
hand, she sat and watched that distant bend in the Paimpol
road as she had watched it, to quote Madame Pilot,
âwhen all that hair was gold.â Now she turned toward
the doctor, who was her good friend.

âThat is done with,â Monsieur Blandon pointed to the
ragged figure of the receding Piggou. âHe knows what
he will get if he troubles you with his rubbish again.
And how is the heart, Mademoiselle? Those drops I left
last time.... You take them?â

âI take them; but,â said Yvonne, her quiet eyes upon
the road, âthey make my heart beat.â

âThatâs what they are for, Mademoiselle.â

âThey make my heart beat,â she said, âuntil night
and day, day and night, the beating seems like the sound
of footsteps coming to me along the road. Nearer and
nearerâlouder and louder. Then they grow hesitating,
irregular, and stop. Stop, and then go back. And as
they become fainter in the distance, I seem to grow more
quiet and more cold.â

Said the doctor, possessing himself of Yvonneâs wrist
[64]

and watching her as he counted the pulse-beats as intently
as she watched the road:

âThey are footsteps of one you know, Mademoiselle?â

She turned on him those startlingly blue and brilliant
eyes.

âSurely.... They are his!â

The doctor had often met a tall man muffled in a great
country cape of frieze walking on the Paimpol road.
They had never exchanged words, scarcely even looks,
but the brass buttons in the back of Blandonâs old riding-coat
were eyes, and he had observed how the walker
turned back before reaching that last bend from which
the cottage could be plainly seen.

âHis evil conscience keeps him restlessâor he loves
her still, though he bartered her love for a tavern and a
scolding wife,â the Doctor thought, noting, without seeming
to do so, the changes time had made in the bold,
handsome face and giant frame of Captain Yann Tregnier,
late of the
Maria au Secours
, now landlord of the
Chinese Cider Cellars at Ploubazou. âBut to set foot in
Pors Lanec he will not dare. The men and women would
rise up and stone him out of the village.â

And Monsieur Blandon bade Yvonne adieu, and turned
up his collar and got upon his shambling old white horse
to ride back to Paimpol.

Yvonne sat where he had left her. The early winter
evening was closing in. The wind had fallen, and the sea
had gone down; only it breathed from time to time like a
sleeping monster of the diluvian age. Through the black
curtains of the sky some pale stars looked forth, and
white spectral clouds, in shapes appalling to the sense,
pursued a flying moon. The lovers had not returned, the
hearth-fire was dying out. Guessing at this, Yvonne
[65]

bestirred herself to go within and feed it with fresh
branches. The fading flame wakened again; she turned
toward the door, and as she did so the step for which
she had waited twenty years crashed over the gravel,
sounded on the stone plateau before the cottage, and the
figure of a manâmassive, almost a giant in height and
breadth, his great proportions increased in bulk by a
heavy cape of the country friezeâfilled up the doorway.

It had comeâthe moment for which she had waited
through the years. She did not scream and fall upon his
neck; he made no movement toward her. Only he pulled
his rough cap from his head with a deference that had
awe in it, and fear, and his heavy black curls, grizzled
now, fell over the brow that was lined and rugged, and
the eyes that were no longer bright with youth and hope,
but bleared with a dull, sordid life and much strong
drink, and the hopeless outlook on a life that was bare
of all joy.

âYann! My love ... Yann! You have come back
to me at last!â

The words were not uttered in a cry, but almost whispered.
As the light of love and joy kindled in her eyes
she became young once more. Her arms swept out to
clasp him and found him not, for he had sunk down upon
his knees; but he clutched her apron and drew her to
him, and broke into hoarse, uncouth weeping, his head
hidden against her, his arms clasping her, her love and
pity overshadowing him like an angelâs wings.

âHe weeps for joy!â she thought, whereas he wept for
shame; but had she known the truth she would still have
comforted him. After a while he grew calmer, and they
went out together into a night suddenly become beautiful
and glorious with starsâor it seemed so to Yvonneâand
[66]

sat together on the bench beneath the window, cheek to
cheek and arms entwined, and she poured out her brimming
heart to him. How she had waited, she told.
Patiently, hoping always, loving him always, never despairing,
sure of his return. Had he been dead she
would have known it. But in the absence of the warning
that never fails to comeâthe midnight wail beneath
the window, the midnight knock upon the door or
window-pane, given by no hand of mortal fleshâshe had
remained quite certain that he was alive. Had she not
been right in guessing that the
Marie au Secours
had
only touched at Paimpol and sailed down into the Gulf
of Gascony, or even to Bayonne, to sell her cargo of salt
cod?

âAy. âTwas as you thought, Yvonne!â he answered.

âAnd you sold well?â

âAy!â he answered again. Truly, he had sold well,
more than his fish. Honor and love, both had gone into
the scales against the dowry of the tavern-keeperâs scolding
wife, a houseful of childrenâa sordid existence
flavored with the fumes of stale drink and stale tobacco,
a few bags of dirty five-franc pieces stowed away in a
safe hiding-place, for the Breton is a hoarder by instinct,
and distrusts the Bank of France: for these rags and
fardels he had bartered Yvonne. He was dully conscious
of such thoughts as these even as he was conscious of
the joy of being near her. Coarse-fibered as he was, this,
the one pure passion of his life, revived in all its old
strength at the clasp of Yvonneâs hands and the meeting
of their eyes. He began to believe that the desire to
be near her once more again had brought him to Pors
Lanec. Perhaps he was right, but the motive, he had
admitted to himself, was mean and sordid. He wished
[67]

to bring about a rupture between Jean-Marie and Gaud.
The girl was penniless; Jean-Marie a love-sick young
fool. Besides, his wife would never consent to a union
of their families; she had never ceased to be jealous of
the sweetheart to whom Yann had played false. âYou
threw her over for my money, rogue that you are!â she
would say to him, when red wine dashed with cider had
made her quarrelsome.

The night drew on. Drifting clouds no longer obscured
the faces of the stars; the December night might,
for mildness, have been May, or so it seemed to Yann
and to Yvonne. There was a fragrance in the air like
hawthorn, and the shrill chirping of a cricket rose from
the glowing hearth in the darkened room behind them.

The lovers found few words to utter, but their silence
was eloquent; the air they breathed in unison seemed the
revivifying essence of joyous life. Yann yielded to the
exquisite intoxication. In the glamour of that meeting he
was young again, clean of heart and soul, looking forward
to their wedding day with the eagerness of a true
lover. He found himself replying in low, eager tones to
Yvonneâs questions.... No, he would not sail for Iceland
in February as a bachelor; they must get married
before the Blessing of the Boats. The official papers
must be filled and signed, the banns put up ... there
would be a honeymoon for Yann and Yvonne before the

Marie au Secours
(poor old vessel, long ago cast up in
driftwood on the shores of Iceland) should set sail.

âAy, indeed, my love, we have waited long enough!â
he said.

Yvonne laughed, a low melodious laugh of happiness,
and owned that the wedding dress, handsomely made and
trimmed with broad bands of velvet, just as he liked bestâhad
[68]

been ready a long time. She took him back to her
pure heart, without a word, without a question....
He had been long in coming, but he had come at last,
and she was utterly content. He drew her into his strong
embrace, and she laid her head on his great shoulder with
the sigh of a child that is weary with too much bliss. His
arm encircled her; both her hands, clasped together,
rested in his large palm. Sleep came to her, and peace;
even the breath that at first had fluttered fitfully beneath
his cheek could be felt no more. And the night
wore on apace, and the glamour fell from him, little by
little, and he was again the landlord of the Chinese
Cider Cellars, with a scolding wife, and an obstinate
whelp of a son, mad to marry a penniless little draggle-tail.
Ay, he could speak now, and he would! He unwound
his arm from the waist of Yvonne and withdrew
the support of his rough palm from her clasped hands,
and as he did so a long faint sigh escaped her and her
head fell back against the whitewashed wall. Ay, he
could speak, and did!

âLord knows what nonsense we have been talking,
you and me.... Something bewitched me.... The
fine night or the sight of the old place. In truth, Yvonne,
you know as well as I do that Iâm a married man; that
cat must haâ got out of the bag long ago. And hearing
that you never would believe Iâd played fast and loose
with ye made me a bit shamefaced, hence we never have
clapped eyes on one another until now, Yvonne. Though
my young cub has been hanging about here after the girl
Gaudâthreatening me with going to sea if sheâs denied
himâand seeing as she hasnât a sou of dowry, I look to
you to stop that foolery. For my good woman at home....
[69]

Iâll own her a bit of a Tartar, and, to tell ye the
truth, Yvonneâââ

âFather!â said Jean-Marie, stepping forward out of
the darkness, the dimly-seen, shrinking figure of Gaud
behind him.

Yann rose up, threatening and formidable, his clenched
fist ready to strike. Gaud cried out in fear; but Yvonne,
the silvery moonlight filling the hollows of her quiet eyes
and resting in the curves of her white cheeks, and kissing
her closed, patient lips into the semblance of a smile,
never stirred. The night wind played with a little lock
of hair escaping from the edge of her shell-fluted cap, and
her bosom neither rose nor fell.

âPretty goings on.... Look here, you cub!â Yann
was beginning, but his sonâs eyes looked past his at the
placid face of the sleeper on the bench, and the fear and
awe in them were not inspired by his father. Yann
looked round then, and a hoarse cry broke from him.

âSpeak to her,â whispered Jean-Marie, and Gaud
tremblingly touched Yvonneâs clasped hands. They were
cold as the smiling lips and the sealed eyes on which
rested the white peace that is the kiss of Death.

The cricket chirped within the cottage, and the deep
slumbrous breathing of the sea came from beyond a curtain
of chill white mist. Yvonneâs long time of waiting
had ended at last.

THE DELUSION OF MRS. DONOHOE

In Two Parts

I

IT was in the spring of 19â that the Dapple Grays
returned from South Africa, covered with wounds,
glory, boils, and khaki, this last presenting many solutions
of continuity. One finds the arrival of H. M.
troopship
Paradise
at Porthampton Dockyard referred
to in the newspapers bearing the date of that occurrence
as an event calculated to awaken emotions of gratitude
and enthusiasm in the bosom of every Briton. An illuminated
address was presented to the Chief by the
Mayor and Corporation of the borough, and the Dapple
Grays were subsequently entertained, the Colonel and
officers to a banquet, and the rank and file to a blowout.

âYou return to us, Captain,â the Mayor is reported to
have said in a complimentary rider addressed to the
commanding officer of the
Paradise
, âwith a freight of
heroes.â

âA freight of devils, sir!â the Captain remarked in
loud-toned confidence to the neighbor on his left. âIf
the Admiralty had any sense of humorâor any sense of
fitness, by George!âthe name of the ship would have
been changed before we sailed. But the
Paradise
has
[71]

seemed almost like one, sir, since we disembarked âem,
and thatâs a fact. Whatâs the next toast on the list, did
you ask? âThe united healths of the two regimental
V. C.âs, Captain the Hon. Gerald Garthside and Private
Dancey Juxon.ââ

âWhat were the special acts of gallantry, do youâah!âhappen
toâah!âremember?â asked the Captainâs left-hand
neighbor (a pompous local magnate), âfor which
the Cross has beenâah!âconferred?â

âUsual thing. Garthsideâthatâs Garthside, on the
Mayorâs left hand, trying to look modest, and succeedinâ
uncommon badlyâGarthside rode from Mealiekloof to
Blitzfontein with despatches for the Brigadier, peppered
by Cronjeâs outposts from overlooking ground nearly the
whole distance. Juxon was cut off while out on scout
with a detachment, and got away from twenty Boers with
his officer on the crupper. Young Bogle, next-of-kin to
Lord Baverstone, died before Juxon got back to the regiment,
chipped in too many places for recovery! Better
off if heâd been left behind, do you say? Probablyâprobably.
But Juxon has the V. C., and theyâre bringinâ
him in to hear his health proposed.... Fine-lookinâ
young Tommy, isnât he? Looks quiet and well-behaved,
you think? Ah, you ought to have been with us on the
voyage from the Cape. The evil genius of the lower
troop-deck, and thatâs facts. Ringleader in every act
of insubordination, up to all sorts of devilment, a black
sheep, sir, a blackâhip, hip, hurray! For heâs a
jollyâââ

âAnd so,â said the Colonel of the Dapple Grays to his
Senior Major, a few weeks later, when the regiment had
shaken down in its old barracks at Studminster; when its
feminine complement had rejoined it; when wives once
[72]

more âupon the strengthâ were washing the tattered
remains of shirts which had seen more service than soap-suds,
and husbands were employing eloquence in the
effort to convince civilian visitors to the canteen that,
despite the solemn warning recently issued from the most
authoritative quarters, to treat the newly-convalescent
enteric patient to beer or ardent spirits is to accelerate
and not to retard his return to perfect healthââ âAnd
so itâs a settled thing, the engagement between your little
girl and Garthside? Affair not jumped up in a hurry?
Began a year before the regiment was ordered to the
Front? Of course. My wife saw the attachment growing
between âem, and helped it on, she tells me. Every
married womanâs a match-maker, you knowâdonât you
knowâwhether sheâs put her own private pot on a bit
of good blood, with temper and stayinâ power and so
forth, or a dee-d confounded showy screw. And your
little girl, not having a level-headed mother of her own
alive to look after her!... Deucedly raw weather, you
know, donât you know!â

Sir Alured broke off, anticipating rather than seeing
the gray change in Major Ruffordâs face, and remembering
that the handsome wife, who had died when
Emmie was a hoyden of thirteen, had signalized the close
of her career upon earth as Major Ruffordâs wife and
the mother of his children by an act of desperate folly.
But the Senior Majorâs wounds had been cicatrized by
the great healer Time, and he looked back quietly enough
as the Colonel cleared his throat with unnecessary violence,
and twisted the great moustache that had been
iron-gray and was now snow-white.

âLady Gassiloe has been very kind, and Emmie doesnât
forget how much she owes her. And thereâs the right
[73]

stuff in Garthside; I can trust him to make my little girl
a good husband. Itâs odd, when one comes to think of
it, that our other Victoria Cross man is going to be married,
and to Emmieâs foster-sister, Peggy Donohoe.â

âThe deuce!â said Sir Alured. âIs that dee-d young
scoundrel, Juxon, going to settle down? Seems too good
to be true. Why, the old
Paradise
was hell when Juxon
wasnât in the cells. Nearest approach to a rhyme I ever
made in my life, by George! But Juxonâs character apart
itâs not a bad match. The young blackguard has plenty
of good looks, and Peggyâs as pretty a girl as you may
see, look high or low. And she thinks Juxon a
proo
shevally
with his V. C.; and so do poor Bogleâs people,
and so do the public, by Jove! You should have heard
him when he reported himself.... â
What did you
mean, you dee-d idiot
,â I asked him, â
by picking up a
man whoâd had the top of his head shot clean off, and
couldnât live five minutes? Dâye call that philanthropy?
In my opinion itâs dee-d foolery!
â âBegginâ your pardon,
Colonel, sir!â says Juxon, âI calls it precaution. When I
âoisted Mr. Bogle up beâind me, I seeâd âeâd âad âis gruel,
anâ the last breath went out of âim before old âAndsome-Isâthatâs
wot I calls that âere spavined gray oâ
mineââad got into âis stride. But the bullets was âumminâ
round me like âornets, anâ pore Mr. Bogle, lyinâ as
âe wos acrost my âams, drawed fire anâ furnished cover.â
Furnished cover! The cool young beggar fortifies his
rear with the next in succession to one of the oldest
peerages in the United Kingdom, gets mentioned in despatches,
and receives his V. C.! Too dee-d funny, you
know, donât you know!â

And Sir Alured mixed a brandy and soda, and chose
an enormous cigar from a case resembling a young Gladstone
[74]

bag. The conversation took place in a curious
ground-glass hutch, sacred to the inner mysteries of Official
business, and labeled âPrivate.â And as the second
in command charged and kindled a meerschaum of incredible
age and foulness, there came a knock at the
door.

âCâmin!â barked the Chief over the rim of the tilted
tumbler, and the regimental Doctor looked round the
door. âOh! itâs you, Assassin!â he said, as he wiped the
froth off the great white moustache. âHow many exenterics
have you kicked out of the convalescent ward
this morning?â

âThree,â said the AssassinââDenver, Moriarty, and
Jarman. Garthsideâs lambs all.â

âAnd dee-d malingerers, in my opinion!â said Sir Alured.

âIâm with you there, sir,â responded the Assassin with
a twinkle. Then he relapsed into professional gravity,
and said as he accepted a cigar and a peg, âThere are one
or two bad cases of relapse, Iâm sorry to sayâas the result
of incautious indulgence in alcoholic beverages.â

âOf course, of course!â growled Sir Alured. âWhen a
man with a granulated stomach uses the organ as a receptacle
for whisky, beer, and gin, contributed in unlimited
quantities by admirinâ friends, he oughtnât to be surprised
when he finds himself drivinâ to the cemetery on
a gun carriage to the tune of the Dead March in
Saul
,
with his boots following as chief mourners. Stands to
reason!â

âI donât anticipate any serious results, except in the
case of Sergeant Donohoe,â the Assassin said, with a
worried look in his usually cheerful countenance.

âDonohoe down again. Poor devil! Iâm sorry to hear
[75]

it!â The Chief tugged at the ends of the great white
moustache and looked grave.

âOnly yesterday,â said the Senior Major, âI thought
him looking about as fit as a man needs to be. He told
me about Juxonâs engagement to his daughter, and went
off as pleased as Punchâââ

âTo drink their healths,â interpolated the Assassin.

âHah! Thatâs about it,â grumbled the Chief. âWell,
I shall go round and look Donohoe up presently. Canât
afford to lose my Senior Color-Sergeant, you know, donât
you know!â Sir Alured frowned savagely, and cleared
his throat with ominous vigor.

âYouâll find him pretty low down,â said the Assassin,
âand I fancy Father Haggarty will be on duty. Theyâd
sent for him before I came away.â

âIs it as bad as that?â said the Senior Major, and
there was a momentâs silence, broken by a clinking step
on the stone flags outside and a respectful knock on the
glass door.

âA âospital horderly, sir,â said the passage orderly to
Major Rufford, âwith Color-Sergeant Donohoeâs respectful
duty, and would you mind the trouble of steppinâ
over and hearinâ somethinâ, sir, wot âe âas to say? Itâs
Ward C., and a case of perforationâand, begginâ your
pardon, sir, there ainât much time to lose.â

âOf course Iâll come! Say, at once!â Major Rufford
lumbered up out of his chair, emptied the office kitten
out of his undress cap, took his cane, which the office
puppy had been chewing, and went.

âDonohoeâs wife was Ruffordâs girlâs foster-mother, you
know, donât you know!â said Sir Alured. âThereâs not
more than a monthâs difference between Peggy Donohoe
and Emmie Rufford in age. When they were babies Iâve
[76]

seen âem sleepinâ in the same cradle; and dee me if I
knew which of âem was which, though I suppose their
mothers did. Not that Ruffordâs poor wife was over and
above devoted to her babies. Odd now if the little beggars
had got mixed up somehow, and Donohoe had sent
for Rufford with the object of easinâ his conscience before
he gave up the number of his mess.â

âOh, thatâs all Gilbert and Sullivan!â said the Assassin,
getting up. âSuch things donât happen in real life,
Colonel, and Iâm going back to the hospital.â

âYou think not? Differ with you there. Walk over
with you, if youâve no objection.â And the Chief and
the Assassin followed in the wake of Major Rufford, who
had only a moment before received point-blank and at
short range from Sergeant Donohoeâs puffy blue lipsâparted
for easier passage of the slow, painful breaths
that were taken with such agonyâthe second overwhelming
surprise of his life.

For Sir Aluredâs stray shot had registered a bullâs-eye.
Donohoe, conscious that the grim messenger who had
beckoned and passed by so many timesâunder the
heights of Jagai, in the clammy Burmese hill jungles,
amid the muddy swamps of West Africa, or the karroo
scrub or grass veldt of the Southâmeant business on
this occasionâhad given up the secret less hidden than
forgotten for many years. Many years since, according
to her own confession, faltered out to the Sergeant upon
her dying bed, the pretty young wife of Private Donohoe,
urged by the promptings of motherly love, or incited,
as Father Haggarty would have said, by the temptation
of the Devil, arrayed her own nursling in the long-tailed
cambric robe with insertion of Valenciennes,
properly appertaining to the foster-babe; enduing the
[77]

said foster-babe, namely Emmeline, infant daughter of
Captain and Mrs. Rufford, not only with the abbreviated
cotton frock which was the birthright of a Donohoe, but
with all the privileges appertaining to a daughter of the
rank and file; including a share in the Christmas tree
and bran-pie diversions annually given under the patronage
of the Colonelâs wife and other ladies of the Regimentâincluding
her own mother.

âDonât say it, Donohoe,â pleaded the bewildered Major,
sitting on the foot of Donohoeâs cot-bed, holding the
rigid hand, and shaken by the throes that were rending
the Sergeantâs soul from the Sergeantâs body. âItâs an
idea youâve got into your headânothing more! Sheâyour
wifeânever changed the babies.... For Godâs
sake, man, say you know she didnât!â

But Father Haggartyâs kindly, pitying look had in it
knowledge, religiously kept sacred, now freed by voluntary
confession from the sacramental seal. He held the
Crucifix to Donohoeâs livid lips, and they moved, and a
living voice came forth as from a sepulchre:

âShe did ut. Sure enough she did ut; but for the right
rayson why, sorr, Iâm yet asthray. For wan thingâherself
was a poor hard-workinâ womanâanâ the choild
would be wan if ut lived. âTwas ten years she carried
the saycretâa mortial weight for a wake crayture, anâ a
Prodesdanâ at that, wid no relief av clargyâand it wore
her to the grave. On her dyinâ bed she confessed ut to
me. I had my thoughts av makinâ a clane breast, and
thenâwurra! âtwas the divil at my elbow biddinâ me
whisht or Iâd lose my Peggy that was the pride av me
eyes anâ the joy av me harrut. Anâ I held off from Father
Haggarty, till I could hould no longer. That was
six Aysthers back; andââTell the truth,â says his Reverence,
[78]

âor youâll get no more of an absolution from me,
me fine man, than Micky-would-you-taste-it?â Anâ at
that I stiffened me upper lips anâ riz from me marra
bones anâ wint me way. But the Hand is on me now,
anâ Iâve made my paice wid Thim above; anâ Iâd be glad
youâd send for my Peggy to be afther biddinâ her ould
dada good-byeâmore by token sheâs your Miss Emmeline
by rights, and not my purty Peggy at all, at all!â

II

Miss Margaret Donohoeâpopularly known in the
regiment as âPeggy,â and, as it will be remembered, betrothed
to Private Dancey Juxon, V. C.âMiss Margaret
Donohoe was not summoned to the bedside of her
hitherto-reputed father in time to hear from his own
lips the secret of her birth. She was trimming an old
hat with new crape for mourning exigencies, the day
after the Sergeant had been consigned with the usual
military honors to the Catholic division of the cemetery,
when heavy footsteps sounded in the flagged passage
of the Married Quarters, and the Colonel and the
Senior Major, both visibly disturbed, walked into Donohoeâs
clean sanded kitchen, and, in as few words as possible,
broke the news.

âItâs a terrible shock to you, my poor girlâas it has
been to me!â said the Major, very white about the gills.
âAnd toâto another I neednât name!â He was thinking
of his Emmie, and how piteously she had sobbed last
night and hung about his neck, with her pretty hair all
coming down over his mess waistcoat, as she begged him
not to send her away from him, because it wasnât her
[79]

fault that she had turned out to be Donohoeâs daughter
and not his own; and how at that moment she was
breaking the news to Garthsideâthat Junior Captain
and Victoria Cross hero to whom, it will be remembered,
she was engaged. Poor Emmie, poor darling Emmie!âor
Peggy, as she ought now to be called! Major Rufford
felt that he never would be able to do it. âButâIâll
try and do my duty to you as your father should,
andâI must look to you toâto do as much by me!â
he concluded lamely.

âOh, Major!â cried PeggyâPeggy with the hard,
bright, black eyes, the red lips, the tip-tilted nose, the
Milesian upper lip, and the coarse but plenteous mane of
dark brown hair liberally âbangedâ in front and arranged
behind in massive rope coils, secured by hairpins
of imitation tortoiseshell as long as the farrierâs pincers.
âOh, Major! can you ax it? Sure Iâll thrate you as dacent
as ever I did him thatâs gone, anâ the Colonel hears
me say it!...â

She checked the inclination to weep for one who was,
all said and done, no relation, and put her crackling six-penny-three-farthings
black-bordered handkerchief back
in her pocket with an air of resolution. A flood of new
ideas inundated her brain. All that she had ever
dreamed of in the way of the unattainable lay hence-forth
within her reach, and everything that had hitherto
appeared most desirable and possible was from this bewildering
hour rendered impossible. Her eyes fell on
Private Dancey Juxon, V. C., who had been sitting on
the kitchen table when the tall shadow of Sir Alured
fell upon the sanded floor, and who had remained, from
that moment until this, petrified in an attitude of military
respect, against the whitewashed wall; and she
[80]

realized that DanceyâDancey, the Adonis of the rank
and file, the hero once desired above all others, wrested
at the expense of the most costly and variegated hats
and the most dazzling toilettes from the clutches of how
many other women!âDancey must now be numbered
among the impossibles. If a cold dash of regret mingled
with the inward exultation of Miss Peggy, it was excusable.

âSure, the dear knows! âTis like a tale out av the

Pinny Romancir
,â she said, âanâ troth itâs no wondher
av my breath was tuk away wid the surprise. To think
of that bould craythur, Donohoeâs wife!âââ

âDo you mean your mother, my girl?â began the Colonel,
but Peggy gave Sir Alured a look that put him in
his place.

âI mane the woman that changed me in me cradle,
bad cess to her for a thrickster!â said Peggy, âanâ put
her own sojerâs brat in the place av meâme that belonged
to the Quality by rights. Not that Iâm not pityinâ
Miss Emmelineânow that sheâs Peggy Donohoe, a poor
craythur sprung from nothinâ.â The Major turned a
groan into a cough, and the Colonel hauled at the ends of
his huge white moustache, but the tide of Peggyâs brogue
was not to be stemmed. âItâll be a change for her, it
will so, afther livinâ on the fat av the landâan orphanâs
pinsion to find her in stirabout, anâ never a chick nor a
child in the woide wurruld but her ould Aunt Biddy Kinsella!â

âWhoâhaw!âis Biddy Kinsella?â broke in the Colonel.

âAvâ sheâs aliveâanâ a bag av dhry bones she must be
av she is,â says Peggyââitâs at Carricknaclee, in Aher,
you may find her. She used to live wid her nieceâmaninâ
[81]

Mrs. Donohoeâanâ she wint back to Ireland
whin me mother diedâmaninâ Mrs. Donohoe aginâa
matter av eight years ago. Anâ âtis natural Donohoeâs
daughter would call her to mind at a time like this.
Maybe the young woman would go to live wid her,â
continued Miss Peggy calmly. âAnâ that brings to me
own mind, MajorâI mane Papaâwhin do ye want me
to come home?â

âHome! Oh, Lord!â said the poor Major, before he
could stop himself.

âDee-d cool!â growled Sir Alured, under the huge
moustache, squeezing the Majorâs arm with his great,
gaunt, brown hand. âBut sheâs got the rightâgot the
right, Rufford, you know, donât you know. Haâhum!â

âYou shall hear from me soonâvery soon, Peggy,â
said the Major brokenly. âGood-bye for now, my girl.â
He took her coarse red hand, so unlike his Emmieâs, and
kissed her equally red cheek; and as he did so the petrified
Juxon recovered the temporarily suspended powers
of speech and motion, stepped forward, and saluted.

âBeg pardon, gentlemen,â he began, âand pre-âaps I
oughtnât to take the freedom; but âavinâ overâeard....â

âSaw you, Juxon! Knew you were there! Thought
you had a right to hear, you know, donât you know!â
said Sir Alured.

But a shrill feminine note of indignation pierced the
Colonelâs bass, as Miss Peggy cried, âRight! Iâd be glad
youâd tell me what right you have, Misther Dancey
Juxon, to be afther pokinâ the nose av you into business
that doesnât consarn you, let alone the privit affairs av
an officerâs daughther. Away wid you, anâ larn your
place! your roomâs more welcome than your company;
anâ if itâs a wife youâre lookinâ afther, maybe when wan
[82]

av thim thatâs av your own station stands up before the
priest wid you, Iâll be making you a little prisint toward
the housekeepinâ, av the young womanâs dacent anâ respictable!â

And the bewildered Juxon found himself outside the
black-painted doorâmarked III. in large white numeralsâin
the character of a lover dismissed.

âWell, Iâm blowed!â he said, and said no more, but
clinked away in search of the Lethean streams of the
canteen.

âRufford,â said Sir Alured solemnly, as the Chief and
the second in command exchanged the atmosphere of
coals and potato peels prevailing in the Married Quarters
for the open air of the barrack square, âIâm confoundedly
afraid sheâs a Tartar! Sharp as a needle, sir,
and knowing as a pet fox, if you ask me!â

And the Major said in reply, âThese things are supposed
to be hereditary. I wonder where she gets it
from!â Then he broke out, âI canât believe it, Colonel!
I couldnât, if fifty dying men had taken an oath to it.
That my poor Claraâs girl! Itâs impossible! If an angel
were to come down from Headquarters Above, with despatches
confirming the report, I couldnât credit it!â

âAnd dee-d if I should blame you,â the Chief responded.
âBreedâs bound to show, somewhere, and
thereâs not a drop of good blood in the girlâs veins, Iâll
swear!â

âThereâs an Irish strain in my family, too,â said poor
Rufford despondently, âand my Emmie has brown hair
and eyes; and her nose, bless it! is a little tilted at the
end.â

â
A nay retroussy.
So it is, by George! But there are
noses and noses, yâknow,â said Sir Alured. âAnd Emmieâs
[83]

a Rufford, from the crown of her head to the ends
of her toes; and weâll prove it, weâll prove it, sir! Donohoe
hasnât a leg to stand onââwhich was trueââand as
to that Mullingar heiferââthus the Chief designated
Peggyââsheâll be sorry one day for throwing Juxon over,
mark my words. Send for that old aunt of Donohoeâs
dead wifeâthe bag of bones Peggy talked ofâand pump
her for all sheâs worth. Turn her inside out!âitâs the
only advice I can give you, for my headâs in as dee-d
a muddle as yours. And remember, whatever happens,
my Lady is staunch to Emmie! Game woman, my
Lady. Doesnât care a dee what society says, as long
asââ God bless me, Rufford! Iâm talkinâ as though
Emmie wasnât your daughter. But the whole thingâs infernally
confusinâ, you know, donât you know!â

An opinion in which the regiment concurred. An excited
beehive would have furnished but a poor comparison
to the barracks upon the morrow, when Peggyâs great
news, imparted in ostentatious secrecy to Mrs. Quartermaster
Casey and a few other non-commissioned officersâ
ladies, had percolated through them. Visitors thronged
the Donohoesâ quarters; Peggy was the heroine of the
hour. Press reporters from the town hung about the
barracks on the chance of seeing either of the heroines
of what was termed in the local paper âAn Extraordinary
Romance in Real Life,â and the officersâ wives
called in a body to condole with Emmie Rufford, who,
as we have heard, had broken off her engagement with
Captain Gerry Garthside.

âI shall not break my heart over things,â she had said,
with an attempt at being everyday and common-sensible
that was plucky, if not convincing, âand I hope you
wonât dwell too much upon the collapse of our house of
[84]

cards. I hopeâI pray youâll build more solidly, withâwith
somebody else. Donât, Gerry! Oh, donât! Itâs not
fair to make my duty harder to do thanâââ

Then Emmie had broken down, wept wildly, been
kissed, consoled, and assured of her loverâs undying love
and eternal fidelity. Part? Never! Lose such a pearl
of a wife! Not for all the Donohoes past, present, or to
come! I believe, in spite of Emmieâs woe and Captain
Gerry Garthsideâs agitation, the young people secretly
enjoyed the scene dramatic; and when Lady Alured
came rustling in, about the time when Gerryâs eloquence
attained its utmost pitch of fervor, and hugged and cried
over the hero and heroine of the little drama, that dear
woman was not the least happy of the three.

And later on, after returning to quarters, Captain
Garthside found a letter on his doormat. The contents
of the soiled envelope, directed in a sprawling hand, ran
as follows:

â
Door No. 3, Ground floor, Block Q.

âMiss E. Rufford presents comps And wold be Glad
to see Cap Garthside & if Yu will call at 2 remane

âYour Oblidged

â
E. Ruffor
â

Of course the Captain knew Peggy Donohoe; had
danced with her at non-commissioned officersâ balls;
given her gloves and chocolates, and sipped the roses of
her cheek in common with many another passing admirer.
âAnd whoâd be the worse of a kiss,â as Peggy
would have said, âfrom a dacent girl?â âDacentâ she
undoubtedly was, if not from pure innate virtue, perhaps
from the consciousness that a depreciation in marketable
value attaches to goods that have been soiled by
[85]

handling. Had it been otherwise, the state of Major
Rufford had been less gracious, thought Captain Gerry
Garthside.

And he looked at Emmieâs photograph standing in a
silver frame upon his mantelshelf, and remembered the
piteous smile with which she had told him that everything
must now be over between them, and mentally renewed
his vows of fealty before he went round to âlook
up Peggy.â

The rooms occupied by the late Sergeant Donohoe
were threeâa kitchen and two bedchambers. One of
these latter, Peggy, with the assistance of Mrs. Quartermaster
Casey, a dozen yards of cheap Liberty muslin, a
gross of Japanese fans, one or two pieces of Oriental
drapery, and a few articles of furniture of the tottery
bamboo kind, had converted for the time being into a
boudoir. Only for the time being, she said to herself,
because when she got her rights she would enjoy all the
splendors now usurped by the real Peggy DonohoeâMiss
Emmie, as she called the usurper when she forgot,
which was not often. She would dress for dinner every
evening, and attend balls and theaters in low-necked,
long-trained frocks, chaperoned by Lady Alured, adorned
with the late Mrs. Ruffordâs diamond stars, and attended
by Captain Gerry Garthside, V. C. For not one, but all
the possessions held and prerogatives hitherto enjoyed by
the false Miss Rufford would naturally devolve to the
real one, once formally recognized and received by her
papa and the regiment; the âould dudsâ and bits of sticks
once pertaining to the supposed Margaret Donohoe being
transferred to the veritable Peggy, together with all
rights in Private Dancey Juxon, V. C. The topsy-turvy,
comic-operatic whimsicality of her own idea did not appeal
[86]

to Peggyâs sense of humor. She was very much in
earnest as she waited for her visitor, seated in state upon
one of her own ornamental chairs, her red handsâhands
which could not be transferred to the real Peggy Donohoe
with the other thingsâfolded in her lap.

âSheâs here, Captain,â Mrs. Quartermaster Caseyâretained
as chaperon until Lady Alured should awaken
to a sense of her dutiesâhad said, opening the door.

âOh, Captain,â said Peggy, rising coyly, âis it yourself?â

And, owning the soft impeachment as he squeezed the
red hand (Gerry Garthsideâs manners to the plainest
woman were fatally caressing), the Captain inquired
how he could serve her.

âSure,â said Peggy, making play with her fine eyes,
âyouâll maybe thinking me forward, Captain, for makinâ
the first sign. But me papaâthe Majorâwill be takinâ
up a great dale of me toime by-anâ-by, and wid Mrs.
Casey sittinâ in the kitchen widin call, weâre givinâ no
handle to the tongue of scandal, as the sayinâ isâââ

âMy dear Miss Peggy!ââ the Captain was beginning,
when Peggy took him up short.

âIâll trouble you,â she said, âto remimber that Iâm not
takinâ any more Peggy from anywan, high or low, anâ
Iâd be glad it was ginerally known. âMiss Emmeline,â
or âEmmieâ for short, youâre free to use, or any pet name
ye may pick.â She cast a languishing glance upon Captain
Gerry. âIâm not likely to quarrel wid itââshe
moved nearerââor wid you. Och, thin! but âtis quare
how things have turned round wid me! Peggy Donohoe
a week ago, anâ walkinâ out wid Dancey Juxonâanâ nowâthe
Majorâs daughter, anâ your promised bride, Captain
jewel! Sure âtis like a dhrame, it is!â

[87]
And Peggy rested her rather large head upon the shoulder
of the astonished Captain, who hastily withdrew the
support.

âLook here, Peggy, my girl!â he said hastily. âWhatâs
this notion youâve got into your noddle? You donât
think....â

âI think that youâre a gintleman, Captain,â said
Peggy, with a tender smile, âand would never go back
on the promise you gev to the Majorâs daughter. Anâ
now that Iâm her, anâ sheâs me, youâll do your duty by
me, as Dancey Juxon will do his to Donohoeâs poor unfortunate
girl. You may thrust him. Weâve had it out
betune us, anâ heâs with her now.â

âWithâherânow?â repeated the bewildered Captain.

âI sent him to the MajorâsâI mane papaâsâquarters
ten minnits ago, wid a flea in his ear!â said Peggy, folding
her red hands about the elbow of her captive, and
rubbing her cheek against his shoulder strap. ââI darâ
you,â sez I, âto hang about here,â sez I, âmakinâ sheepâs
eyes at a daughter av the Quality, whin that poor crayture
you gev your promise to is cryinâ her two eyes out
for the gliff av a glimpse av your red head. Away wid
you,â sez I, âanâ prove yourself a man av your word,
Dancey Juxon, or maybe Peggy Donohoeâll be takinâ the
law av you wan av these fine days!ââ

âMy good girl,â said Gerry Garthside, almost pleadingly,
âyou canât really believe what you say youâve
told Juxonâthat he is obliged to marry Miss Rufford, or
the lady who has borne that name until now, because he
happens to have given a promise of marriage to Peggy
Donohoe, and Miss Rufford and Peggy have changed
places?â

âI mane that!â Peggyâs black eyes snapped out
[88]

sparks of fire; as she tossed her head, a loosened coil of
black hair tumbled upon her shoulder. Her fine bust
heaved, her cheeks burned scarletâshe had never looked
finer in her life. âDo I not mane just that? Think!
Isnât her father mine? Isnât her home my home?âthe
dhress she wears upon her back mine?âthe ring she has
upon the finger av her mine? Ah, musha, anâ the man
that put it there!â Her grasp on Captain Gerryâs arm
tightened, her eyes sought his and held his; her warm,
fragrant breath came and went about his face like a personal
caress. âSure, dear, youâll not regret ut,â said
Peggy, âfor I loved you iver since I clapped my two
eyes on youâI take the Blessed Saints to witness! Anâ
Dancey Juxonâll be dacent to Donohoeâs daughter, anâ
you anâ me will be afther lendinâ the young couple a
hand, lettinâ her have the washinâ maybe, or the waitinâ
at our tableâor by-anâ-byââshe lowered her black
lashesââshe might come as nurse to the children. So,
darlinâ....â

The sentence was never finished, for the alarmed Captain
broke from the toils and fled. The Mess story goes
that he double-locked his outer door, barricaded the inner
one with a chest of drawers and a portable tin
shower bath, and spent the rest of the day in reconnoitering
from behind the window curtains in anticipation
of a descent of the enemy. But in reality he bent
his steps toward the North Quadrangle, where the Majorâs
quarters were, and over the familiar blue crockery
window boxes full of daffodils, he caught a glimpse of
Emmieâs sweet face, not pale or bearing marks of secretly
shed tears as when he last kissed it, but bright-eyed,
flushed, and dimpling with laughter as she nodded
and waved her hand to a departing visitor, who, absorbed
[89]

in the charming vision, glimpsed above the daffodils,
collided with and cannoned off the Captain.

âHullo! You, Juxon?â

âBeg pardon, sir,â said Private Juxon, rigidly at the
salute. âI âope I âavenât âurt you!â He grinned happily.

âHave you come into a fortune, or inherited a title?
You look pretty chirpy!â said the Captain.

âNot a bad âit of âis by âarf,â said Private Juxon critically
to Private Juxon, âabout the cominâ into a title.
âFor,â says she, â
the greatest gentleman in the land
couldnât âave done moreâand though I canât accept your
offer, I shall always look up to you and respect you as
the most chivalrousest and honorablest man I ever
met
!â Wot price me, after that?â

For, as may be guessed, Private Juxon had proposed,
and been rejected. Standing very stiff and red and upright
on the passage door mat, he had confessed his sense
of responsibility and explained his views.

âThe general run of feelinâ in the regiment beinâ the
same, Miss, as her own, that Iâm bound as a man to keep
my promise to Peggy Donohoe, whether sheâs you or you
are âer. Iâve took the freedom of callinâ to say as wot
Iâm ready,â said Juxon. âAnâ the weddinâ was to come
off in June; but youâve only got to name an earlier day,
Miss, anâ Iâll âave the banns put up, you not beinâ a
Catholic, like Peggyâwhich I ought to call âer Miss Rufford
now, as owing to âer station, Miss. But if you think
Iâll ever come short in duty anâ respect to the Majorâs
daughter, because sheâs turned out to be only the Sergeantâs,
youâre wrong, Miss, youâre wrongâupon my
blooââupon my âtarnal soul!â

And then it was that Emmie Rufford conferred upon
Private Juxon the title of nobility, which made him a
[90]

proud manâand unconditionally refused his offer, making
him a happy one.

She is now married to Captain Gerry Garthside, who
yet fulfilled his engagement to the Senior Majorâs daughter
in leading her to the altar. For within a week the
bubble had burst, topsy-turvydom reigned no more, the
barracks ceased to seethe like one of its own mess cauldrons,
and Peggy Donohoe was compelled to relinquish
the privilege of calling Major Rufford âPapa.â For old
Aunt Biddy Kinsella had been discovered in the smokiest
corner of her grandsonâs cottage at Carricknaclee, in
Aher, by a smart young solicitorâs clerk; and her sworn
deposition, duly marked with her cross and attested by
her parish priest, dispersed the clouds of doubt from the
Majorâs horizon, relieved Sir Aluredâs moustache from
an unusual strain, and proved the deceased Mrs. Donohoe
to have been the victim of a delusion.

âFor âtwas at Buttevant Barracks where the regiment
was stationed nineteen years ago, anâ me stayinâ on
a visit wid me niece, that I saw herâMaggie Donohoeârest
her unaisy soul, the misfortnit craythur!âI saw her
change the childrenâs clothes wid the two eyes I have in
my head,â said Aunt Biddy Kinsella, âbarrinâ that only
wan av thim was at the keyhole. âOch, murdher!â sez I,
lettinâ a screech anâ flyinâ in on herâfor I had the use
av me legs in thim daysââwhat have you done, woman,
asthore?â âMade a lady av little Peggy,â says she, wid
the fingers av her hooked like claws ready to fly at me,
âanâ I darâ you to bethray me.â âBethray!â sez I. âItâs
bethrayed her to the divil, you maneâthat sheâll be
brought up a black Prodesdanâ, and not a dacent Catholic,
as a Donohoe should be by rights.â âHoly Virgin,
forgive me! Sure, I never thought av that!â sez herself,
[91]

and all thrimblinâ we undhressed the children anâ
changed the clothes again. Anâ a day or so afther the
Majorâs baby was waned anâ wint back to uts mother.
But Maggie Donohoe was niver the same in her mind
afther that day. Sit anâ brood she would, anâ hour by
hour; anâ creep out av her own bed anâ into mine night
afther night, and wake me wid her cowld hand upon me
mouth anâ the whisper in me ear to know had she given
little Peggyâs sowl to the divil or changed the childhren
back afther all! Anâ as years wint on she kem to a
quieter mind, but on her dyinâ bed the ould fear and
thrimblinâ got hould av her agâin, anâ she tould Donohoeânot
what sheâd done at all, at all!âbut what she
wanst had the intintion av doinâ, but that her heart
failed her; anâ so made a fool av the man that owned
her, as many another woman has done before!â

Thus Aunt Biddy Kinsella, who, having spoken, may
be dismissed to her smoky corner under the turf thatch,
where a greasy parcel reached her in the middle of the
following June, containing, not an olive branch, but a
concrete slab of wedding cake, with the joint compliments
of Mr. and Mrs. Dancey Juxon. For âthe general
run of feelinâ in the regimentâ was in favor of Private
Juxonâs renewing his matrimonial engagements to Peggy
Donohoe, now that she had been proved, past all doubt,
to be herself. And by the last advices received from
headquarters it appears that Mrs. Lance-Corporal Juxon
is acting at this moment as nurse to the Garthside baby.

[92]

PONSONBY AND THE PANTHERESS

I  HAVE called this story âPonsonby and the Pantheress,â
because Ponsonbyâs nocturnal visitor undoubtedly
belonged to the genus
Carnaria
, species
F.
pardus
, the
Pardalis
of the ancients. The whole thing
hinges on Ponsonbyâs getting a ticket of invitation to a
mighty dinner given by one of the great City Livery
Companies. Had he refused the invitation, and stayed
at home with Mrs. Ponsonby, it would have been better
for himâand for her. He would not to-day have been
a silent, atrabilious man, who goes upon his way in lonelinessâthat
mated loneliness which is of all desolate conditions
on this earth the most desolateâwith a vampire
gnawing underneath his waistcoat. She would not have
been a much-wronged, cruelly neglected womanâor the
other type of sufferer, the woman who has been found
out; and for ever robbed of that which women hold dearest
in lifeâthe power to create illusions.

It was a great dinner at that City Hallâa feast both
succulent and juicy, and upon a scale so prodigious as to
put it utterly beyond the power of a single-stomached
man to do justice thereto. Many of the guests had
thoughtfully provided themselves with several of these
necessary organs, but Ponsonbyâwho had recently sold
out of the Army, and invested his commission money in
business, and settled down with Mrs. Ponsonby in a neat
[93]

little house in Sloane Streetâwas still young, and fairly
slim.

The baked meats and confectionery were excellent, and
âthe drinksââas Betsey Prig might have observedââwas
good.â It was revealed to Ponsonby that he had
absorbed a considerable quantity only by the swollen
condition of his latchkey when he tried to fit it into the
door of the little house in Sloane Street. But after a
short struggle the door opened, and Ponsonby paused a
moment on the doorstep to take some observations on the
weather. It was just one oâclock as he looked at his
watch in the moonlight. Ponsonby was reminded of Indian
moons by the lucent brightness of the broad silver
orb that floated so majestically on the calm bosom of the
dark overhead. She was getting near her wane, but only
notifying it by an exaggerated handsomeness, like a professional
Society beauty. Ponsonby thought of that
simileâall by himselfâand was proud of it, as he had
always been a man more celebrated for his moustache
than his intellect. He tied a knot in his mental pocket
handkerchief to remember it by, and, facing round to go
into the house, was a little disconcerted to find the hall
door gaping to receive him.

Then he went in, barred and bolted very carefully,
and set the spring burglar alarumâfor once. Ponsonby
was unusually careful and deliberate in his movements
on this particular night. Then he sat down on the hall
bench and took off his boots. Then he switched off the
electric hall light. Then he pondered whether he should
or should not have just one brandy and soda before going
to bedâbecause he had come home so clear and
calm and cool-headed from that City dinner. Ay or Noâand
the Ayes had it. He went into the dining-room.
[94]

It had been furnished for the Ponsonbys on the best
authority; in oak, with Brummagem-Benares brass pots
and tea trays. The window curtains, and the drapery
which hung before a deepish recess in the wall to the left
of the door as you entered, were plush, of that artistic
shade of olive-green which is so shabby when it is new
that you canât tell when it gets old. The recess had
originally been intended for a book case; but young
married people just starting in life never have any booksâthey
are too much bound up in each otherâand so it
had been covered up. You can put things behind a covering
of this sort which you do not care to expose to the
gaze of the casual guestâa row of old slippers, or a pile
of superannuated Army Lists, or a collection of summonsesâor
the Family Skeleton.

Ponsonby switched on the light, and opened the liquor
case with his watch-chain key, and got a tumbler and
soda siphon from the buffet, and lighted a cigar. Then
he sat down in an armchair, unbuttoned his white waistcoat,
loosened his collar, and prepared to be lonelily convivial.
He thought of his girl-like bride asleep upstairs,
with her cheek upon her hand, and her gold-brown hair
swamping the pillow. It says much for the state of
Ponsonbyâs affections, that while he knew the uses of
the monthly half pint of peroxide which was an unfailing
item on the chemistâs bill, he could still be poetical
about that tinge of gold. But newly married men seldom
look into the roots of anything. He lifted his glass and
drank her health. âTo Mamie!â he said, as the frisky
gas bubbles snapped at his nose. And then he glanced
over the edge of the tumbler at the curtained recess behind
the door. And the short hairs of his head rose up
and began to promenade. And his teeth clicked against
[95]

the glass he held. For a bolt of ice had shot through
either ear orifice straight to his brain. In other wordsâSomething
had laughedâan ugly laughâbehind that
drawn curtain.

In another moment it was put aside. A woman came
out of the recess that had concealed her, and stood before
him.

Not to mince matters, she belonged to the class we are
content to call unfortunate. From her tawdry bonnet to
the mud-befouled hem of her low-necked silk dressâa
preposterous garment, grease-stained and ragged, and
partly hidden by an opera cloak of sullied whitenessâthe
nature of her profession was written on her from
head to foot. She was not without beauty, or the
archÃ¦ological traces of what had been it; but as she
grinned at the astonished man, showing two rows of
strong square teeth, yellowed with liquor and cigarette
smoking, and the gathered muscles of her cheeks pushed
up her underlids, narrowing her fierce, greedy eyes to
mere slits, and the hood of her soiled mantle fell back
from her coarsely dyed hair, she was a thing unlovely.
She seemed to snuff the air with her broad nostrils, as
scenting prey; she worked her fingers in their dirty white
gloves, as though they were armed with talons that
longed to tear and rend; and, as she did so, Ponsonby
was irresistibly reminded of a panther.

Ponsonby had shot panthers in India, and had once
been slightly mauled by a female specimen. It was an
odd coincidence that the old scars on his left shoulder
and thigh should have begun to burn and throb and
shoot unpleasantly as the yellow-white fangs of the intruder
gleamed upon him, framed in by her grinning,
painted lips.

[96]
But Ponsonby recovered himself after a moment, and
asked her, without ceremony, how the devil she came
there? He was not a particularly bright man, but he
knew, even as he asked. She had been crouching in the
shadow under the porticoâsome of the Sloane Street
houses have porticoesâwhen his cab drove up. She had
watched him get out. Then, when he had been standing
with his foolish back to the open door, gaping at the
moon, the Pantheress had skulked in, with the noiseless,
cushioned step that distinguishes her race. And now he
had to get rid of her.

Which was not as easy a task as one might think.

He began by telling her that he was a married man.

âKnew that,â said the Pantheress. âSaw you take off
your boots in the hall. Saw you drink her health.â She
mimicked him. âTo Mamie!â And laughed againâthat
unspeakably jarring laugh.

Ponsonby grew irate. He took his courage in both
hands and went into the hall, where he softly undid the
door fastenings. Then he came back, and offered to
show his visitor out.

She was in the act of pocketing a silver race cup, won
by Ponsonby at a Pony Hurdle Handicap on the Bombay
course in 1890, when Ponsonby came back. He
caught her wrist and bade her drop it. She gave it up
sullenly. Then, with a sudden accession of feminine
meekness, she said she would goâif he would stand her
a drink.

It seemed a cheap bargain. The unwitting Ponsonby
got out another glass from the buffet cupboard, and
mixed her a brandy and soda, not too weak. She drew a
chairâhis wifeâs chairâto the table, and sat down,
throwing her dingy cloak from her whitewashed shoulders.
[97]

She put her hand to her head, and drew thence
a long steel pin with a blue glass head, and took her
gaudy bonnet off and threw it on the table. She did not
hurry over the consumption of the liquid, and Ponsonby
began to grow impatient. When he hinted this, she
asked for a cigar.

He gave her one, and a light. And she drained the
last drop in the tumbler, and stuck the burning weed
between her teeth, with a coarse masquerade of masculinity.
Ponsonby heaved a sigh of relief.

âNow, my girl, come alongâtimeâs up!â He started
for the door.

The Pantheress got up, and leaned against the mantelshelf,
smoking. She intimated that she had changed her
mindâand would remain. Ponsonby lost his temper,
and threatened ejection by main force.

âPut me out? You darenât!â rejoined the Pantheress.
She added some adjectives reflecting upon Ponsonby and
the honor of his familyâbut with those we have nothing
to do.

Ponsonbyâs under jaw came out, and his forehead lowered.
He strode toward the Pantheress; her sex was not
going to plead for that delicate piece of femininity, it
was evident.

âI darenât, eh?â

âYou darenât. Because Iâd tear, and scratch, and
scream, I wouldâtill the police cameâtill your wife
woke up and came downstairs to see what the row was
about. Nice for you, then! Easy for you to explainâwith

two
glasses on the table!â

Ponsonby broke into a cool perspiration. He spake in
his soul and cursed himself for a foolâof all fools the
one most thoroughly impregnated with foolery. For he
[98]

saw that he had been trapped. The Pantheress rocked
upon her hips and laughed, shaking out a coarse aroma
of patchouli from her shabby garments.

âYou had me in and stood me drinks. I can swear to
that. My swell toff, I think youâd better knock under!â

Ponsonby had to arrive at that conclusion, thinking of
his wedded happiness and the golden-brown hair scattered
on the pillow upstairs. He was awed to the pitch
of making overturesâof asking the Pantheress how
much she would take to go?

The Pantheress sprang high. Twenty pounds.

Ponsonby had not as much in the house. With great
difficulty, and much exercise of eloquence, he got her to
bate five. It was necessary that she should be brought
to forego another five, for all the ready cash he could
muster did not amount to much more than ten. How to
attain this desirable end? Ponsonby had a dramatic inspiration.

He had read many novels and seen many plays. In
most of these the main plot turned upon the ultimate
victory of Human Virtue and Truth over Vice and Disintegrity.
In these books or dramas Vice was generally
personified by an adventuressâa brazen, defiant person,
who had made up her mind to ruin somebody or another;
and Virtue, by an innocent girl or pure young
wife, who pleaded until the hardened heart was melted,
the fierce eyes moistened by an unaccustomed tearâuntil,
in short, the naughty woman abandoned her unhallowed
purpose and left the nice one mistress of the field.
The theory is an admirable one in a book or in a play,
but in real life it does not hold good. Ponsonby has
since learned this; but at that time he was youngish and
inexperienced.

[99]
He would weave a net, with those golden-brown tresses
upstairs, in which to catch the Pantheress. He begged
her to listen, and told his story quite prettily. He explained
how, three years before, his regiment having
newly returned from India, he had met at a certain
South Coast resort, separated by a mile or two of arid
common from a great dockyard town, a lovely girl. She
was a friendless orphan, the daughter of a clergyman,
had been a governess, had broken down in health, and,
with the last remnant of her little savings, taken a humble
lodging near the sea, in order to benefit by the ozone.
How she had found, during her innocent strolls on the
beach, not only that health of which she had been in
search, but a husband. And, finally, how every fiber of
her soul, being naturally bound up in that husband, and
her present state of health delicate, the infliction of such
a blow as the Pantheress contemplated striking might
not only strike at the roots of love, but of life.

With which peroration counsel concluded, not wholly
dissatisfied with himself. He wiped his brow, and sent a
hopeful glance at the Pantheress. Her features had not
softened, nor was her eye dimmed. Her lips twitched,
certainly, but the convulsive movement was merely the
herald of a yawn.

âYouâre a good one to jaw!â she said, when he had
finished. âCome, Iâll not be hard on you. How much
have you got?â

He named the amount.

âHand out!â the Pantheress bade him.

He would give her half the sum then and there, Ponsonby
said, with a gleam of strategic cunning, and the
other half when she was fairly outside the hall-doorânot
before.

[100]
The Pantheress nodded, and clutched the first installment
from his hand greedily, and caught her dirty bonnet
from the table and threw it on her head. âNo
larks!â she said warninglyââcome on!â and moved to
the room door, where she paused. âAinât you got manners
enough to open it for a lady?â she remarked in an
aggrieved tone. Ponsonby, hastily restoring the tell-tale
second glass to the sideboard, sprang forward and
grasped the handleâand dropped it as though it had
been red-hot, for he had caught the sound of footstepsâlight,
regular, measured footstepsâdescending the stairs.
He could not utter a word. He turned a white face and
glaring eyes upon the Pantheress. And the steps came
nearer. As the dining-room door opened, he fell back,
helplessly, behind it. The wall seemed to open and
swallow himâthick, suffocating folds fell before his
face; he had backed into the curtained recess whence the
Pantheress had emerged thirty fateful minutes previously.
Through a three-cornered rent in the stuff, just
the height of his eye from the ground, and through which
that beast of prey had probably watched him, he lookedâand
saw his wife!

She wore a loose white wrapping gown; her hairâthe
hairâhung in waves about her shoulders. Barring the
bedroom candle she carried, and losing sight of her prosaic
nineteenth-century surroundings, she resembled one
of Burne Jonesâs angels. But her calm expression
changed, and her voice was tuned to a key of unangelic
indignation, as her glance lighted on the painted, brazen
Defiance, erect and bristling, before her.

âYou ... a woman, what do you want? How did
you?âhow dared you come here?â

The Pantheress was about, in answer, to launch the
[101]

first of an elaborate flight of insults, couched in the easy
vernacular of Leicester Square, when she stopped short.
Her thick lips rolled back from her gleaming fangs in a
triumphant grin. She bent forward, with her hands
upon her thighs, and made a close inspection of the face
of Ponsonbyâs wife.

â
What! Luce?
â...

The other recoiled, with a slight cry. And Ponsonby,
in his retirement, was conscious of a deadly qualmâfor
Mrs. Ponsonbyâs Christian name was Lucy! When he
opened his shut eyes and peeped through the rent again,
it was only to receive a fresh shockâfor Mrs. Ponsonby
and the Pantheress were sitting, one on either side of
the table, chatting like old friends.

âLuck was poor,â the Pantheress was saying, âand me
low down in my spirits. So when I found the door of a
swell house like this open, âIâll pop in,â says I to myself,
âand look about for a snack of something and a drop to
drink, and then make off if I can, clear, or else go to
quodâlike a lady.â And I did pop inâand I did look
aboutâand the first thing that turns up isâyou! On a
smooth lay, ainât you? Always a daring one, you were.
A clergymanâs daughter, and an orphan! Weâve most of
us been clergymenâs daughters and orphans in our time,
but not a girl of us ever looked it more than you. And
youâre married! Ha! ha! With a swell church service,
and singinâ, and a Continental tour to give the orphan
a little change of scenery. Sheâd seen so little in her
time, the poor dear! Lord! I shall die of it!â

The woman rocked with silent laughter. It seemed to
the man behind the curtain that her eyes, across his
wifeâs shoulder, glared full into hisâthat her coarse
jeers were leveled at him. He could not have uttered a
[102]

sound, or stirred a finger, for the dear life. A kind of
catalepsy had possessed him. But he saw them drink
together, and heard them talk ... turning over with
conversational pitchforks the unspeakable horrors of the
dunghill whence his white butterfly had taken wing....
Ponsonby had never been an imaginative man, but that
midnight conference wrought his sensibilities to such a
pitch that, leaning against the wall in the corner of the
curtained recess, he quietly fainted.

He came back to consciousness in darkness through
which struggled no gleam of light. He did not know
where he was until he staggered out from behind the
stifling draperies and switched on the light with shaking
hands. Then he found himself in his own dining-room.
There were no glasses on the tableâthe spring bar of
the liquor stand was in its place, the brandy decanter
was, as he remembered to have left it, half full. He
found his candle on the sideboard and lighted it, and
went into the hall. The hall-door was barred and bolted.

âThank God, I
have
been dreaming!â said Ponsonby,
and went upstairs.

There she layâa breathing picture of reposeful innocenceâfast
asleep. Ponsonby stooped and kissed the
hair that flooded her pillow and invaded his own, and
silently swore by all his deities that he would never go to
another City dinner as long as he lived. Before he crept
into bed he knelt downâa thing he had not done since
he was a boyâand said awkwardly, âO God, Iâm glad it
was a dream! Thank you!â

He slept the sleep of the weary, and rose, not a giant,
it is true, but very much refreshed. He dandered down
to the breakfast table in a leisurely way, humming a
[103]

tune. As he shook out his newspaper, the absurdity and
improbability of his recent vision struck him for the first
time; he laughed until he ached. Then he dropped his
newspaper, and stooped to pick it up. Something bright
that lay upon the carpet under the table attracted his
notice. The man put forth his hand and took it, and his
ruddy morning face underwent a strange and ghastly
alteration. For the thing was a long steel bonnet pin,
with a vulgar blue glass head! Men have died suddenly
of pin pricks before now.

But Ponsonbyâs tortures are lingering. He is alive
still, and she is still Mrs. Ponsonby. He has never
spokenâthe Secret of the Blue Glass Pin is hidden from
the woman who walks Lifeâs path with him. But sometimes
she is haunted by a dreadful Doubt, and at all
times he is bestridden by an overwhelming Certainty.

[104]

A FAT GIRLâS LOVE STORY

In Three Parts

I

THE first thing I remember being told is that I was a
Parksop, and the second that it was worth while
living, if only to have that name. Some years after, it
dawned upon me that we had got very little else.

Father was a landed proprietor upon a reduced scale,
and a parent on a large one. There were twelve of us,
counting Prenderby, who had passed into the Army a
few years previously, and passed out of it later on at the
unanimous request of his superior officers. Father cut
him off with a shillingâwhich he forgot to send himâand
sternly forbade him to bear the name of Parksop
any more. He has done well since, and attributes his rise
in life entirely to that deprivation. Nobody ever writes
to Prenderby except Charlotte.

If an abnormally fat girl could possibly be the heroine
of a romantic love story, CharlotteââPodge,â as she has
been nicknamed ever since I can rememberâwould
stand in that relation to this narrative. But, you know,
such a thing isnât possible. If it had been, Belle, who
comes in between Podge and Prenderby, and is the acknowledged
beauty of the family, having all the hereditary
Parksop points besides several of her own, nobody
would have wondered.

How did the story begin? With Roderick and meâcoming
[105]

home to spend a vacation. It was likely to be
a pretty long one, for the Head of the School had behaved
in a most ungentlemanly way, showing absolutely
crass insensibility, as father said, to the advantage of
having one of the best names in England on his school
list, while it remained written at the bottom of a check
for fifty-nine pounds, odd shillings, and half-pence,
marked by a groveling-spirited bank cashier âNo Assets.â

You may guess Roddy and me didnât grumble muchâthe
Parksops have never been strong in grammar and
orthography, so Iâm not going to apologize for a slip
here and thereâdidnât grumble much at hearing that we
were to stay at home for the present, and be âbrought
onâ by the curate in Euclid and Latin and Greek, and
all the rest of the rot. He wouldnât strike for wages,
father knew, because for one thing he was very modest
and shy, and for another he was spoons on Belle. If he
wasnât, why was he always glaring at our pew in
church? And for the same reason we shouldnât be overworkedâa
thing the most reckless boys acknowledge to
be bad for them. So the morning after our return we
went down to breakfast feeling as jolly as could be.

Father shook hands with us in his lofty way. We
could see that he was deeply indignant with the Head
from the way in which his aquiline nose hooked itself
when we gave him a letter weâd brought with us. We
almost wished we had torn it up, because, having made
up our minds to go fishing that morning, we had meant
to ask him for the key of the old boat house by the pond,
where the punt was kept, which key, with a disregard of
opportunity quite unnatural, as Roddy saidâin a man
with so large a familyâhe always kept hidden away.

[106]
Belle gave us two fingers to shake and her ear to kiss,
and the others, as many as were allowed to breakfast
with the elders, crowded round, and then Podge came
bouncing in and hugged us for everybody. We didnât
care about the hugging, because it was such a smothering
business, like sinking into a sea of eiderdown, Roddy
used to say, who was imaginative for a Parksop. And
here, as itâs usual to describe a heroineâthough I donât
acknowledge her for one, you knowâit would be best to
describe Podge a little.

It describes her kind of temper pretty well to say that
she didnât mind being called Podgeâeven before
strangers. The name describes her exactly. You
couldnât tone it down and call her plump; she was simply
one of the fattest girls you ever saw. Her large
face was rosy, and usually beamed, as people say in
books, with smiles and good temper. Her hair was
black, and done up in the way that took the least time,
and her eyes were black and bright, and would have been
big if her face had been a little less moonlike. She had
little dumpy hands and little dumpy feet, rather prettyâin
fact, the only family landmarks, as Belle said, that
had not been effaced by the rising tide of fat. In a
regular story there is always something about the
heroineâs waist: not that I give in to Podge beingâyou
know! I suppose she had a waist; at least, it was possible
to tell where her frock bodies left off and her skirts
beganâthen. It isnât now! The frocks were always old,
because whenever Podge had a new one she gave it to
Belle, and you couldnât deny that Belle did them more
justice. Then, she had a nice kind of voice, though the
Parksop drawl had been left out of it, and I think thatâs
allâexcept that, considering her beam, she moved about
[107]

lightly, and that she always sat down like a collapsing
feather bed and got up like an expanding balloon.

Breakfast didnât make the school commons look very
foolish. There wasnât much difference, except that the
coffee wasnât so groundy. Father had his little dish of
something specialâkidneys, this timeâand Roddy, sitting
at his right handâwe were treated as guests the first
day at homeâdived in under his elbow when he was
deep in his coffee cup and harpooned half a one. Of
course, he had to bolt it before father came to the surface,
and Podge was dreadfully anxious, seeing him so
purple in the face, lest he should choke.

I did as well as I could with my rasher of bacon and
hers, and I remember her whispering to me, just before
Nuddles came in with the Squireâs card, that the housekeeping
money had been lately more limited than ever.
And as I looked across the table, out at the window, and
over the green, rolling Surrey landscapeâall Parksop
property in our ancestorsâ timesâand remembered that
such a small slice of it was left to be divided between
such a lot of us, it did occur to me that it would have
been better if theyâmeaning the ancestorsâhad been a
little less Parksopian in the way of not being able to
keep what they had got. Then Nuddles, the butler, came
in with Squire Braddleburyâs card, and the curtain drew
upâwe had had a performance of one of the plays of
Terence that very half year, and I had done the part of
a dumb slave to everybodyâs admirationâand the curtain
drew up on what would have been âPodgeâs Romance,â
if Podge had only been thinner.

[108]

II

Father broke up the breakfast party with getting up
and going out. As a rule nobody dared push back his or
her chair until
he
had finished, and when he took it into
his head to read one of the leaders in the
Times
aloud to
us, we had to make up our minds to spend the afternoon.
But as a rule he went to the library as soon as
heâd done, and worked until lunch. He usually worked
leaning back in his armchair, with his feet on a footstool,
and a silk handkerchief thrown over his head. He went
to the library now, to meet the Squire, whose gruff
âGood-morningâ Roddy and I heard as father opened
the door. He didnât quite shut it afterward, and as
Roddy and I stood by the hall table, carefully sewing
up the sleeves of the Squireâs covert coatâfor Podge had
given us each a neat pocket needle-and-thread case, to
teach us to be tidy, she said, and a taste for practical
joking isnât incompatible with lofty lineageâwe couldnât
help hearing some of the conversation.

It was most of it on the Squireâs side, and the words
âtitle deeds,â âunentailed,â and âmortgageâ occurred
over and over again. Then âunpaid,â âdue notice,â
âneglected,â and, finally, âforeclosure.â Perhaps it was
fatherâs giving a hollow groan at this, and being seen by
me through the crack of the library door to tear his hair,
beautifully white, without tearing any of it out, that
made me listen. At any rate, I left Roddy busy with the
coat, andâany other boy, even a Parksop by birth,
would have done as much under the circumstances.

Well, I made out that Squire Braddlebury had got
father on toast. It became quite plain to me, boy as I
[109]

was, that he could, whenever he chose, strip us of the
last remaining hundreds of our old acres, and send us,
generally, packing to Old Gooseberryâwith a word.
Then he asked father why he thought he didnât say the
word then and there? and father said something about
respect for ancient title and hereditary something or
other; and Squire Braddlebury, who had made his vulgar
money in trade, said ancient title and hereditary
something or other might be deeâd. And thenââ

âIâll tell you why, Parksop,â he blustered. âItâs because
of your girl! When you came to me for money to
waste on your gobbling, selfish old self, caring, not you,
not one snap whether your family went bare for the rest
oâ their lives, so long as you got what you wanted for the
rest of yours, I lent you the cash on your title deeds,
signed by Edward Plantagenetâand more fool he to
waste good land on you! I lent you the cash, I say, because
I knew youâd not come up to the mark when pay
day came, and I wanted your girl. Whatâs that you say?
Belle! Not if I know it! Sandy hair and aquiline profiles
donât agree with me. I mean Miss Charlotte.
Sheâs a fine, full figure of a woman; sheâs a good âun, too!
Donât I know how she keeps your house a-going? Donât
I know how she makes and mends, plans and contrives,
teaches the children when your foreign governesses take
French leave, because they canât get their wages out of
you, Parksop, and does the Lord knows what besides! I
shouldnât have spoken so soon, but another fellowâs got
his eye on herâNoel, the parsonâyou know who I mean.
I believe theyâre secretly engaged, or something.â

âGracious Heavens!â cried father.

âIf they are,â growled the Squire, âit donât matter.
Weâll soon put the curate to the right-about, and on the
day I take her to church youâll get your title deeds back.
[110]

Youâre reasonable, I see. Itâs a bargain. So go and
fetch her, Parksop; go and fetch her.â

There was a scroop and shriek of overstrained springs
and tortured leather. The Squire had thrown himself
into fatherâs armchair. I had only time to drag Roddy
behind the green baize door that shuts off the servantsâ
wing from the rest of the house, when father came out
of the library.

III

The whole house was topsy-turvy. The secret of the
mortgage was out, for one thing. Everybody knew that
the Squire had proposed to Podge, that Podge had said
âNoâ to him, in spite of fatherâs dignified commands, and
that the Squire had rushed out of the house, foaming at
the mouth, with his coat half on and half off, stormed
his way round to the stables, where he saddled his horse
himself, and galloped homeward, scattering objurgations,
threats, and imprecations right and left.

âStuck-up paupers! Make Parksop know better!
Sell âem up, stick and stone! Prefer dâd curate to
me, Thomas Braddlebury! Fool! Must be crazy!â

Roddy and I and everybody else agreed with him, except
Podge. She was regularly downright obstinate. She
had given in to all of us all her life, and now, just when
her giving in meant so much, she wouldnât. What was
the good of beginning, we asked, if she didnât intend to
go on? We were very severe with her, because she deserved
it. Falling in love at her sizeâlike a milkmaidâand
with an elderly curateâan old-young man, with
shabby clothes and a stoop! Belle had put up with his
staring at our pew when he read the Litany on Sundays,
but now that she was quite sure he hadnât been doing it
[111]

because of her, she regarded it as an unpardonable insult.
She stirred up father to write to the Rector demanding
Mr. Noelâs instant dismissal, and the Rector
sent back an old, unsettled claim for tithe money, and
referred father to the Bishop of the diocese.

Meanwhile, Podge was the victim of love. It was
really funny. She cried quarts at night, according to
Belle. Her red nose and swollen eyes made her funnier
still. And old Noel stooped more going about his parish
work. He was a gentlemanâthat was one thing to be
said for himâand if two perfectly healthy lives had not
stood between him and the title, heâd have been a baronet,
with a rent roll worth having, the Rectorâs wife said.

They say dropping wears away a stone. We dropped
on Podge from morning till night, and she gave in at last.
She put on her hat and trotted down to the Rectoryâwaddled
would be the best word. She saw Noel, and had
it out
vivÃ¢ voce
. Sheâd tried to do it by letterâBelle
found a torn-up note of dismissal in her room, beginning
âMy lost Darling.â We yelled over the notion of
old Noel being Podgeâs lost darling; almost before weâd
done yelling she was back again, and had smothered the
little ones all round, and gone to the library with a flag
of truceâa wet pocket handkerchiefâto announce the
capitulation to father. She spoke to me afterward,
looked appealing, as if she wanted to be praised for doing
a simple thing like that for her family! I didnât praise
her, and Roddy gave her even less encouragement.

The Squire was sent for by special messenger, and
came without hurrying. He said he was glad sheâd come
to her senses and showed a proper appreciation of the
gifts Providence had placed within her reach. He
brought a diamond engagement ring, which wouldnât go
on the proper finger. We laughed again at that; we were
[112]

always laughing in those days. And he gave father one
of the title deeds back, and stayed to dinner, and had a
little music in the drawing-room afterward, and kissed
Podge when he went away, at which Roddy and I and
Belle nearly went into convulsions, and in a little time
the wedding day was fixed.

As it came near, Podge didnât get any thinner. She
ate her dinner just as usual, and smothered the children
a good deal. She was to have half a dozen or so of them
to live with her; she stipulated for that, and the Squire
grinned and scowled and said, âAll right, for the present!â
He turned out to be quite generous, and tipped
us sovereigns and Belle jewelry and new frocks, and she
said every time she tried them on that she had quite
come to regard him as a relative. Everybody had except
Podge, and I dare say if youâd asked her sheâd have
said she was the person whose opinion mattered most.
You never know how selfish unselfish people can be till
theyâre tried! Itâs true the Squire was awfully ugly and
as rough as a bear, and a little too fond of drinks that
made his temper uncertain and his legs unsteady. But
he had done a great deal for the family, and women canât
expect us men to be angels.

Podge was a little too quiet as the wedding drew near.
You know, thereâs no fun in pinning a cockchafer that
doesnât spin round lively. The presents came in and the
invitations went out, the breakfast was planned, the cake
came from London, with heaps of other things; but she
kept quiet. The night before the wedding it rained.
Somebody wanted her for one of the thousand things
people were always wanting her for, and she couldnât be
found. She stayed out so long that father sent word to
the stablemen and gardeners to take torches and drag
the pond. Of course, he was anxious, for you canât have
[113]

a wedding without a bride. But why the pond? A thin
girl might have tried that without seeming ridiculous,
but not a fat one, and Podge couldnât have sunk if sheâd
tried! She came in at last among us, looking very queer,
and wet to the skin, with only a thin cloak on over her
evening dress. She said sheâd been to the churchyard,
to motherâs grave, praying that we might be forgiven.
She laughed the next moment, catching a glimpse of her
own droll figure in the drawing-room glass.

Next day was the wedding day. Everybody had new
clothes, and the bridesmaidsâ lockets had the initials of
Podge and the Squire, âCâ and âR,â in diamonds.
Roddy and I had pins to matchâHunt and Roskellâs. I
forget how many yards of white satin went into Podgeâs
wedding gown, but it measured thirty-eight inches round
the waistâno larks. She cried all the way going to
church, so that father was nearly washed out of the
brougham.

How did the wedding go off? It never came off at all!
There were the county people in the smart clothes
theyâd taken the shine off in London; there were the
school children, with washed faces and clean pinafores,
and baskets of rose leaves all ready to strew on the path
of the happy pair. There were the decorations, palms
and lilies, as if the occasion had been a kind of martyrâs
festival; and there was the Bishop at the altar rails,
with the Rector, waiting to tie the knot; and the Squire,
in a blue frock-coat, buff waistcoat, and shepherdâs plaid
trousers, with a whole magnolia in his buttonhole, waiting
for Podge.

Father tried to lead her up the aisle, but it was too
narrow, so he walked behind. Just as she put her foot
on the chancel step, out comes old Noel out of the vestry,
to everybodyâs surprise, looking flushed and excited.
[114]

He said something I didnât hear, and then Podge calls
out, âOh, I canât! Have mercy!â or something like that,
and surged down with a flop, like the sound a big wave
makes dashing into a caveâs mouth, on the red and white
tiles. Old Noel ran to lift her up, but couldnât do it.
The Squire called out, âDââ you! Let my wife alone!â
And the Bishop rebuked him for swearing in a sacred
edifice. Then father and the Squire and old Noel hoisted
Podge upâfor two of âem werenât strong enoughâand
tottered with her into the vestry.

What happened? I got in, and so I know all about it.
We sprinkled Podge with water, and set fire to a feather
duster and held it under her nose, and she came to, with
her hair down, and her wreath and veil hanging by one
hairpin. And old Noel bent over her, and said, âDearest
Charlotte, there is no need for the sacrifice now!â And
he pulled a newspaper out of his pocket and handed it
to father, who said, âWhat! what! how dare you, man?â
and then dropped his eye on a paragraph marked in red
ink, and said in the best Parksop manner, âI really beg
your pardon, Sir Clement! Your uncle and his son both
drowned yachting in the Mediterranean? Most deplorable!
but really affords you no excuse forâahâinterrupting
a solemn ceremony in so extraordinary a manner.â
And then he and oldâI mean Sir Clement Noelâhad a
few confidential words in a corner, and I heard oldâI
mean the Baronetâsay, âOn my word and honor, a
sacred pledge!â And father astounded everybody by
turning on the Squire, and telling him in the most gentlemanly
way to go about his business, which he did,
swearing awfully, while Podge was crying for joy, and
Sir Noel comforting her with his arm round her waistâI
mean as far as it would go.

That happened three years ago, and Podge and Sir
[115]

Clement Noel have been married three years all but a
week. We all live with Podge and her husbandâI donât
think theyâve ever been alone together for a day since
their honeymoon. Father is very fond of Charlotte now,
and says the baby is a real Parksop. That always makes
Sir Clement Noel wildâI canât think why.

Iâve often thought since, after seeing what they call a
domestic drama, that what happened to Podge and Noel
might have happened to the hero and heroine of one.
Only, a hero never has gray hair and a stoop, and there
never yet was a heroine who measured as much as thirty-eight
inches round the waist. Itâs impossible!

[116]

IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION

THE balloon ascended from the Chiswick Gasworks at
twelve-thirty, amid the thin cheers of an outer
fringe of Works
employÃ©s
and an inner circle composed
of members of the Imperial Air Club, who had motored
down expressly for the start. It was by courtesy a summer
day, a June gale having blown itself out over night,
a June frost having nipped vegetation over morn. Now
there was not a breath of wind, and the sky vault arching
over London and the suburbs was of purplish-gray,
through which a broad ray of white-hot sunshine pierced
slantingly with weird effect as the order âHands off!â
was given, and the
Beata
, of forty-five thousand cubic
feet, owner Captain the Honorable H. Maudslay-Berrish,
of the I. A. C., soared rapidly upward.

Hitherto Maudslay-Berrish, occupied with the thousand
cares devolving on the aeronaut, had not looked
directly at either of his traveling companions. These
were his wifeâs friend and his wife. We all remember
the sumptuous Miss Fennis, of the Hyperion and other
West End comedy theaters. Many of the masculine
readers of this truthful record have laid offerings of hot-house
flowers, jewelry, sweetmeats, and settlements, at
those high-arched insteps in their pre-nuptial days, and
not all have had cause to mourn the rejection of the
same. But Maudslay-Berrish, son of a philanthropic
Nonconformist peer, to whom the theater is the antechamber
to the Pit, married her, and, as too far south
[117]

is north, the men of his set thenceforth tacked on âPoor
chap!â or âPoor beggar!â to the mention of his name,
when another stage triumph of his gifted wife, who did
not resign her profession, was recorded in the newspapers.

The friend of Mrs. Maudslay-Berrish, whom we may
know as âTeddy,â gasped one or two private gasps as
the
Beata
shot up to an altitude of three thousand feet,
and Chiswick Gasworks fell away underneath her into a
tinted relief map of West London, and then was buried
under a sea of swirling dun-gray vapors. The hoot of a
motor-carâthe needle-sharp screech of a railway locomotiveâwere
the last sounds to reach the ears of the

Beataâs
three passengers. Then the sounds of Earth sank
into the silence of Eternity. And the soul of Mrs.
Maudslay-Berrishâs friend felt very thin and small,
knowing itself adrift upon that tideless sea. The wicker
car seemed also smallâsmall to unsafenessâand the
ropes as frail as the strands of a spider web. Cautiously
Teddy put forth his immaculately gloved hand and
touched one. Madness, to have trusted limb and life
to things like these. Madness, to have left the good
solid ground, where there were clubs and comfort and
other men to keep you from feeling aloneâfor Teddy
realized with vivid clearness that in this particular moment
and at this particular point Mrs. Maudslay-Berrish
counted for nothing. He even forgot to look to see
if she was there. But she was there, and looking at him
across her husbandâs back. For Maudslay-Berrish was
in the middle of the oblong basket, and he was leaning
over, peering down into the swirling gray sea below, his
folded arms upon the wicker car edge, his chin upon
them.

As matter of fact, he did not wish his wife and her
[118]

friend to see how heartily he was laughing. When you
have set a trap for two beings whom you hate with an
intensity beyond all the range of human expression, and
waited patiently for yearsâit had taken him, Maudslay-Berrish,
just three years to qualify as a member of the
Air Clubâto see them fall into it, you laugh when it
happens. And if they chance to see your face while you
are doing it, it makes them feel uncomfortable....
And when they know!... The purple veins swelled
upon his narrow forehead under the leather peak of his
Club cap. His muscles cracked, his shoulders heaved
with that hidden, terrible, convulsive laughter.

âHarwood,â cried his wife, her strong voice ringing
loud in the thin, untainted air, âwhat is the matter? Is
anything wrong?â

âThe balloon is not leaking, the valve is in proper order,
there is plenty of ballast on board, the car is sound,
the ropes are new and have been tested,â said Maudslay-Berrish.
âThere is scarcely a breath of wind to move us,
and yet something
is
wrong. What are you trying to ask
me, Beryl ... whether we are in danger? At the risk
of spoiling your evident enjoyment of your first ascent,
I answer âYes!ââ

Then he straightened his bowed figure and turned so as
to face the wife who had betrayed him so often, and
Teddy, her friend. She, Beryl, looked at him with wild
eyes set in a face suddenly grown sharp and thin. She
clenched her gloved left hand upon a rope of the car,
and the splitting of the glove back revealed her wedding
ring and its keeper of sparkling diamonds. At the sight
of that consecrated symbol another gust of mad laughter
seized Maudslay-Berrish, and the tears poured down
his purple face, and he roared and roared again, until
every fiber of the car vibrated with his ugly merriment.

[119]
âFor Godâs sake, Berrish, donât laugh like that!â
shrieked Teddy, blue-white and gibbering. âAre you
mad, or what?â

âWere you sane, you infernal foolâyou two infernal
foolsâwhen you got into this car with the man whom
you have outraged?â shrieked Maudslay-Berrish.
âHavenât you dragged my good name in the mud, made
me a by-word and a laughing-stock, a mockery even to
myselfâeven to myself, in the last five years! Why,
you dââ âââ (he called Mrs. Maudslay-Berrish an
unlovely name) âmy very servants sneer at me, the people
at the theater grin when I come loafinâ round behind
the scenes. Theyâre quite aware of what Iâve swallowed
without gagginâ. They know Iâve lived on your money
when Iâd got through my own, quite fly as to where most
of it came fromââhe pointed a shaking finger at the
stricken Teddyââand as downy as you pleased. Teddy,
old chap, Iâve
called
that blue-gilled funker there, and
half a dozen like him. Well, Teddy, old chap, say your
prayers quick, for youâre going to die suddenly!â

The woman and her lover knew now what their late
dupe and butt meant to do. He had the ripping cord
half-hitched about his left wristâthe ripping cord, a
sharp tug at which will, when a balloon is dangerously
dragged during a descent, take an entire panel out of the
envelope in two seconds, immediately deflating the bag.
And in his right hand Maudslay-Berrish manipulated a
neat little revolver.

Certainly he played the star part in the drama, and
held the audience breathless. Half of the audience, that
is, for Teddy, old chap, was at his prayers. Down on his
knees at the bottom of the car, his gloved hands rigidly
clasped, his handsome, weak face turned up to the sustaining
ball of gas that hovered in its imprisoning net
[120]

above, between him and the Illimitable Void, he cowered
and slavered. In pleading for Heavenâs mercy upon a
miserable sinner, he set forth that his Eve had tempted
him; he asked for time to make up, another chance, a
year, six months, a week only of sweet life. Hearing
him, Eve herself grew sick with contempt of his infinite
littleness, and even Maudslay-Berrish half turned away
his eyes.

âWhy donât
you
pray?â he said, sneeringly, to his
wife. âWhy donât
you
grovel like that thing you have
kissed?â

Miss Fennis, of the Hyperion, would have held an
audience mute and breathless by the quiet scorn conveyed
in Mrs. Maudslay-Berrishâs look and tone.

âI dare say when you have done what you are going
to do, I shall wake up in Hell,â she said; âand I believe
I shall have earned it!â

Teddy, still spinning out the smeared records of his
Past, was now prostrate and bathed in tears.

âIf I doubted the existence of such a place before, I do
not now. For I have loved that manââshe bit her white
underlip sharplyââand I have seen and heard him.
Henceforth there can be nothing worse to bear, here or
hereafter. Why do you delay? Pull the cord and have
done with it, or I shall say
you
are afraid!â

The
Beata
came sailing gently down upon a delightful
green expanse of turf at Aldershotâthe tennis ground,
in fact, of a dandy Cavalry Regiment. The anchor
dropped and caught in a pollard oak; a dozen delightfully
pink lieutenants in correct flannels assisted the
handsome Miss Fennis, of the West End theaters, to
alight from the basket. Maudslay-Berrish, calm and
imperturbable as usual, followed. In the midst of congratulations
[121]

and offers of luncheon, a lieutenant exclaimed:

âGreat Scott! Why didnât you say youâd another passenger
in the car? Hereâs a man lying in a dead faint
at the bottom of it!â

And they brought out Teddy, very white and limp,
and gave him brandy.

âHeart weak, what?â said the lieutenant who had exclaimed.

âHe has certainly had someâcardiac trouble,â returned
Maudslay-Berrish placidly; âbut I think he will
be less liable to theâahem!âthe weakness after this
little trip of ours together in the Fourth Dimension.â

And he smiled as he lighted a very large cigar.

[122]

THE GEWGAW

THE iron doors of the auction-room were closed
tightly as the valves of an oyster shell; the forward
rush of a smartly attired throng awaited their rolling
back in the polished steel grooves. It was to be a
womanâs field day; the contents of a notable jewel
casket were to be dispersed under the hammer. And the

bonne-mouche
of the occasionâa superb blue diamond
of sixty-five carats, a gem worthy to rank among the historic
stones of the world, fit to be counted among the
treasures of a Sultan or to blaze upon the bosom of an
Empressâwas discussed by watering mouths. Some of
them were old and some of them were young, but all were
tinted with the newest shade in lip bloom, and all wore
the same expression of almost sensual desire. Paradise
plumes fought together as wonderfully hatted heads
bent and swayed and nodded in animated discussion.
The stone had brought a hundred thousand louis and
the Grand Monarqueâs own patent of nobility to the
Portuguese adventurer who had stolen it from a Hindu
temple midway in the seventeenth century. It had
gleamed between the wicked, white breasts of the
Duchesse de Berry, the shameless daughter of the RÃ©gent
dâOrleans, at that final supper on the Terrace of
Meudon. It had been seized by the Revolutionists in
the stormy days of 1792, and had mysteriously vanished
from the Garde Meuble, to reappear in the taloned
clutches of a London money lender and gem dealer, notorious
as a rogue among the spendthrift fine gentlemen
[123]

of Whiteâs and Crockfordâs. And it had been bought by
a big banker, and bid for by a Tsar, and sold to a great
Tory nobleman, and left as an heirloom, and given to an
Italian opera singer, and got back by arbitration and
made a ward in Chancery, and sold in Paris by sanction
of the Court; and now the woman who had bought and
owned and worn itâsometimes as the swinging central
stone of a tiara, at other times as the pendant to a
matchless collar of black pearlsâwas dead, and Briscoeâs
famous auction-room, which is the chief clearing-place
of the world, was about to witness a new record in
progressive bidding.

The live women who had known and envied the dead
owner of the blue diamond clustered thick about the
iron doors, and loaded the atmosphere of the crowded
place with their perfumes, and chattered like the inmates
of the parrot house at the Zoological Gardens.
Not one of them but would have given her soul in exchange
for even a lesser jewel if Satan had appeared at
her elbow and suggested the exchange. He did come to
one of them. She was a pretty woman, still almost
young; she was beautifully dressed in painted silken
muslin, and wore a whole king bird of Paradise in her
Paris hat. The bronze-gold wires of the wonderful tail,
tipped with vivid emerald at the ends, curved and sprang
about the wearerâs well-waved and well-dressed head like
living snakes of incredible slenderness. The rich red
plumage of the dead creatureâs head and throat gleamed
like rubies; the delicate feather tufts that sprang from
beneath the wings quivered with her every movement;
the orange bill held a seed, cunningly placed; the cobalt-blue
legs were perched upon a rose stem. To insure such
beauty in the plumage the skin must be torn from the
living bird. Any woman might be happy in possessing
[124]

such a hat; but this one was miserable.... She wanted
the big blue diamond.... And this urbane, polished
person, elegantly attired, had told her that, if she chose,
it might be hers in exchange for a possession only half
believed inâto wit, the womanâs soulâdisposed of to a
personage held, until that psychological moment, to be
non-existent.

This was not the devil of St. Dunstan, with horns and
a tail, or the cloaked and ribald wine seller of St. Anthony,
or the lubberly fiend of Luther, or the clawed and
scaly tempter of Bunyan. Nor did this personage bear
the least resemblance to the swaggering, scarlet-and-black,
sinister Mephistopheles of Goethe, as represented
by the late Sir Henry Irvingâupon whom be the Peace
of Heaven!âbut the woman entertained no doubt that
it was the very devil himself. In this urbane and polished
gentleman in the light gray, tight-waisted frock-coat
and trousers of Bond Street cut, from beneath
whose snowy, polished double collar flowed a voluminous
cascade of pearl-colored cravat pinned with a small but
perfect pigeonâs-blood ruby; whose lapel bore a mauve
orchid, whose immaculate white spats, perfectly polished
patent boots, slender watch-chain, jade-headed walking
stick, and pale buff gloves, betokened the most studied
refinement and the most elegant taste, the daughter of
Eve recognized the hereditary enemy of the Human
Race.

She did not scream or turn ghastly with mortal
fear; her CrÃªme Magnolia and Rose Ninon were quite
too thick for that. But her heart gave a sickening jolt,
and fear immeasurable paralyzed her faculties, and her
veins ran liquid iceâor was it liquid fire?âand for one
swooning instant, under the regard of those intolerably
mocking, unspeakably hateful eyes, the life in her
[125]

seemed to dwindle to a mere pinâs point of consciousness.
But she revived and rallied, and the terror passed.

âCome!â he said, âyou do not fear meâwe have been
friends too long; and to me, who know the world so well,
and to you, who know it and are of it, there is nothing so
undesirable as to create a scene.â His voice was polished,
gracious. It caressed like the touch of velvet, even
if it crisped the nerves as velvet does. âYou know me....
I know you, and how your heart is set upon this
jewel that is to be sold to-day. Rest easy! Though
you have with you in that gold chain purse-bag notes for
fifteen thousand pounds, ten thousand of it raised by
what rigorous moralists ... those unpleasant persons!
... might call unlawful means....â

âHush!â she cried, trembling, unable to remove her
eyes from that faceâlong, oval, benevolentâwith wide,
arched brows and features exquisitely regular, framed in
long waving hairâdark auburn mingled with grayâwhich
fell nearly to his collar and mingled with a curling
beard of natural growth. She trembled as the thought
shot through her that it caricatured a Face that hung,
pictured with a Crown of Thorns, above the cot in her
child-daughterâs nursery; and her thought was mirrored
in those intolerable eyes, and the sculpturesque lips
smiled in impious mockery.

âAh, yes! It seems to you I bear some likeness toâshall
I say a distantâor an estranged Friend of yours....
But I have many other faces, and you have ...
other friends. Do not be afraid, or waste time in denying,
the money is only borrowed; you are your young
daughterâs mother, as well as trustee and executor under
her fatherâs will.... And, surely, you may borrow the
ten thousand pounds at a pinch for an investment? Besides,
you will put it back before any unpleasant inquiries
[126]

are made by your fellow-guardian and co-trustee.
The manager of the Bank was quite deceived by the
second signature upon the deed of withdrawal, so admirably
counterfeited, so.... No, no, I do not wish to
alarm you! Be quite at ease upon this matter, really so
innocent and easily explained away. But with regard
to your project of buying the Blue Diamondâyou have
no chance of carrying out your plan, not the faintest.
Between those sedate persons already assembled by high
privilege behind these shut iron doors an understanding
has already been arrived at. The Diamond will be put
up to public auction and actively bid for, it is true; but
the Diamond is already bought and sold.â His tone was
of the gentlest sympathy, but the mockery in his glance
and the gibing irony of his dreadful smile were to the
baffled woman like white-hot irons laid upon a bleeding
wound. âMr. Ulysses Wanklyn, whose great duel with
Mr. Cupid Bose at the De Lirecourt sale over that RÃ©gence
commode of marqueterie thrilled all London, will
be the winner of the treasure at ninety-four thousand
guineas. Paragraphs in the afternoon papersâmost excellent
publications I find them, and supremely usefulâwill
refer to the coup as âthe climax of screeching
finance,â and âthe hall-mark on an enhanced standard of
jewel-values.â And Messrs. Moreen and Blant, who will
retire, ostensibly beaten, from the field after a bid of
eighty-eight thousand, will be condoled with by writers
who are quite aware that Wanklyn, Bose, Moreen, Blant,
and half a dozen others constitute the Blue Diamond
Purchasing Syndicate, capital ninety-four thousand
guineas.â

The wearer of the king bird of Paradise caught a sharp
breath, and bit her sensuous, scarlet-dyed underlip
fiercely. Stung to desperate courage by baffled desire
[127]

and the thwarted jewel-lust that had robbed even her
child and made of her a forger, she even dared to question....

âIf that is so,â she said, with angry, dark eyes and a
rebelliously-heaving bosom, âwhy did you whisper to me
just now that I could have the Diamond for my own if I
gave you ... as the people do in the old German
legends ... my Soul in exchange for it?â

He smiled, and caressed the strange, orchidaceous
flower he wore with perfectly-gloved fingers.

âHave you not heard me called the Father of Lies ...
the Arch-Deceiver?â

Rage intolerable possessed and rent her. She said
hoarsely, and in tones unlike her own:

âYou can give me the Blue Diamond, and I will have
itâ
at your price
!â

âYou are really a woman of excellent sense,â he saidâand
she was afraid to look because she knew how he was
smiling. âPresent good for future gain!... Doubtless
you will recall the quotation, but so uncertain a futurity
is well bartered for such a jewel as they have in there.
Thinkâyou will snatch it from the great dealersâfrom
the private connoisseurs. You will hold and display and
flaunt it in the face of society. You will be beautifulâwearing
it! You should be envied, wearing it! You may
be happyâdoubtless you will be so! And now, just as a
mere form, prick your left wrist slightly with this
diamond-pointed pencil and inscribe your name upon a
leaf of these ebony tablets. First, though, be pleased
to remove that ... ahem!... miniature religious
symbol from your golden chain. The Crucifix means
nothing to youâyou do not even remove it when you
draw your wedded lover to your embraceâbut I am an
old-fashioned personage, and my prejudice extends back
[128]

over nineteen hundred yearsâto the reign of Herod Antipas,
and is practically unalterable. So ... thanks!
That will serve me excellently!â

From the womanâs hand something fell with a golden
tinkle to the parqueted floor. A surge of the crowd drove
her forward, her French heel crushed what she had
dropped. The diamond pencil pricked the white wrist
between the buttons of her dainty glove; she withdrew
it, a little scarlet bead glistening on the shining point,
and hesitated, only an instant, looking at the offered
tablets of ebony and gold.

âCome, sign!... It will be over in an instant, and,
believe me, you will feel far more comfortable afterward!â
She remembered that her dentist had employed
the same phrases only a day or two before in persuading
her to consent to the removal of a decayed incisor. That
toothâs successorâa perfect, polished example of human
ivoryâgleamed as her lips drew back in a nervous laugh
provoked by the absurdity of the analogy. She scrawled
her signature, and the promise was fulfilled. She was
calmâat easeâhad no more worrying doubts and silly
scruples. He wore no indiscreet expression of proprietorship;
his lips did not even smile. And if there was
mocking triumph in his eyes, his discreetly dropped lids
concealed it.... He bowed profoundly as he took
the ebony tablets, and then he lifted his gloved left hand
and laid a finger on the iron doors. And they rolled
apart, revealing the great safe with many patent locks,
and the auctioneer at his desk, and the clerk at his; and
the chosen already in their seats, and the elaborate preparations
for the elaborate farce that was to be played,
all ready. A savage rage boiled up in her as she looked
at the smug faces of the secret Syndicate, actors well-versed
in their separate parts. But the pressure of the
[129]

chattering, screaming, perfumed crowd behind her carried
her over the threshold, and her companion too. Packed
tightly as sardines in the confined space about the rostrum,
Society waited the great event. And a bunch of
master-keys was produced by the senior partner of
Briscoeâs, and with much juggling of patent locks the
great safe gave up the big, square jewel-case containing
the famous collection, and a sibilant â
Ssâs!
â of indrawn
breaths greeted the lifting of its lid.

âDo not look at me! Listenâand look at the jewels,â
whispered the smooth, caressing voice in the ear of the
woman who had just signed away her soul in exchange
for the sensation of the day. And as a giant commissionaire
bearing pearl ropes and tiaras, bracelets and
rings and necklaces, nervously paraded up and down the
central aisle left for his convenience, and the chattering
and screaming of the society cockatoos redoubled, in
envious admiration of each swaggering, glittering, covetable
gewgaw, the devil told the woman very plainly how
the thing was to be done.

âThe stone that I shall give you is an exact replica in
a newly-invented paste of the stone that is the price of
what I have bought from you. When the commissionaire
brings round the Blue Diamond, touch the jewel boldlyâtake
it in your hand, as it is permissible to doâand
substitute the paste. Have no fear! I will undertake
that the act is undetected. Thenceforth wear your prize
undismayed; boast of it as you will. The oneâthe onlyâdrawback
to your perfect happiness must be that society
will believe your jewel to be false, while you have
the exquisite joy of knowing it to be genuine. So take

this
, and act as I have counseled. Two hours to wait
before you can dare to escape with it, for the Blue
Diamond will be the last lot of the day. But what are
[130]

two hours, even spent in a vitiated atmosphere, with
such a prize your own, hidden in your glove or in your
hand? A mere nothing! And here comes the commissionaire
with the Diamond.... Only an alumina in
hexagonal arrangement crystallized in the cooling of this
planet you call âthe Worldâ as arrogantly as though there
were no others, and yet how unique, how exquisite! See
how the violet rays leap from the facets, even the noblest
sapphire looks cold and pale beside the glorious gem.
Murder has been committed for its shining sake over
and over again in ages of which your history has no
cognizance. It has purchased the faith of Emperors and
the oaths of Kings. Rivers of blood have flowed because
of it. Peerless women have laid down their honor to gain
it. And it will be yours ... yours! Quick, the commissionaire
is coming. School your hand to steadiness;
no need to hide your lust, for all faces wear the same
look here. Only be quick, and have no fear!â

The eyes of the commissionaire were fastened upon the
womanâs white, ringed, well-manicured hand, as in its
turn it lifted the Blue Diamondâslightly set in platinum
as a pendantâfrom its pale green velvet bed. But yet
she effected the exchange. The substituted paste jewel
was borne onâthe paroquets and cockatoos chattered
and screamed as loudly over the false stone as they had
over the real, which lay snugly hidden in the thiefâs fair
bosom. The syndicate of dealers played out their farce
to its end, and Mr. Ulysses Wanklyn, to the infinite
chagrin of Mr. Cupid Bose, and the gnashing discomfiture
of Messrs. Moreen and Blant, secured the paste
diamond at ninety-four thousand pounds. And amidst
cries and congratulations the day ended. And the
woman, with her price in her bosom, escaped into the
open air, and signaled to the chauffeur waiting with her
[131]

motor-brougham and drove home. Fear and triumph
filled her. When would the theft be discovered? How
soon would voices in the streets begin to clamor of
the stolen gem? How should she who had stolen it ever
dare to wear or to vaunt it, with Scotland Yardâwith
the detective eyes of all the world upon her? She had
been befooled, duped, defrauded; she moaned as she bit
her lace handkerchief through.... She reached her
dainty boudoir just in time to have hysterics behind its
locked and bolted doors. And when she had quieted
herself with ether and red lavender, she drew the Blue
Diamond from its hiding-place, and it gleamed in her
palm with a diabolical splendor, as though the stone
were sentient, and knew what it had cost. Could the
great dealers be deceivedâa probability quite impossibleâshe
would be at liberty to wear this joy, this glory,
to see its myriad splendors reflected in envious eyes. She
kissed it as she had never kissed her child or any of her
loversâwith passion, until its sharp facets cut her lips.
And, as she kissed it, her quick ears were alert to catch
the shoutings of the newsmen in the streets. But there
were none. She dined in her boudoir, and slept, with the
aid of veronal; and in the morningâs newspaper there
was not a wail, not a word! She gave the king bird of
Paradise hat to her maidâshe was so pleased, so thankful!
The afternoon papers, and those of the next day
and the next, were dumb upon the subject of the daring
theft of the big Blue Diamond from Briscoeâs famous
auction-room. She grew more and more secure. And
one never-to-be-forgotten night she put on a Paquin
gown and went to a great reception at a ducal house
with the Blue Diamond as pendant to her pearl-and-brilliant
collar. She counted on the cockatoos screeching,
but they did not screech. The eyes that dwelt on the
[132]

Blue Diamond were astonished, surprised, covertly
amused, contemptuous.

âThat is for luck, I suppose, dear?â cooed one of her
intimate friends. âI mean that large blue crystal you
are wearing.... I bought some last winter at a jewelerâs
in the bazaar at Rangoonâthey find them with
moonstones and olivines and those other things in the

dÃ©bris
at the Ruby Mines, I understood. I must have
mine mounted. By the way, do you know thatâââ
(she mentioned the name of a great financier of cosmopolitan
habits and international fame) âhas bought
the Blue Diamond from Ulysses Wanklyn for a hundred
and ten thousand pounds:
She
ââher voice dropped a
little as she referred to a lady upon whom the great
financier was reputed to have bestowed his plutocratic
affectionsââwill be here to-night. Probably she will
wear it! They say she was absolutely determined on his
getting it for her, and so....
Ã porte basse, passant
courbÃ©
, especially when the circumstances are pretty.

What
do you say? You heard it had been discovered
by the dealers that the Blue Diamond had been found
to be false ... a paste imitation, or a cut crystal like
that thing you are wearing? Oh, my dear, how quite too
frightfully absurd a
canard
! As though Ulysses Wanklyn
and Cupid Bose and Blant, and all the other connoisseurs,
could be deceived! What a very remarkable-looking
man that is who is bowing to you!... The
graceful person with the Apostolic profile and the beautiful
silky beardââand the intimate friend gave a little
shudder. âAnd the extraordinary eyes that give one a
crispation of the nerves?...â

It was heâher Purchaserâmoving suddenly toward
her through the throng of naked backs and bare bosoms.

âI hope,â he said, and bowed and smiled, âthat you
[133]

are satisfied with the result of our ... negotiations the
other day?â Then, as the fashionable crowd parted and
the Great Financier walked through the rooms, his imperious
mistress upon his arm, her husband looking amiable
behind them, he added, indicating the swinging
central pendant of the ladyâs superb diamond tiara, with
a wave of a slender white-gloved hand, âMy substitute
was convincing, you think; you suppose it has deceived
even the experts? Not in the leastâthe substitution of
the paste stone for the Blue Diamond was discovered
as soon as the public had quitted the auction-room. But
Messrs. Wanklyn and Bose and my other very good
friends who lay down the law in jewels as in other things,
to Society, agreed not to lose by the fraud. The paste
has the
cachet
of their approval, and has been sold for a
great sum. âWhat water!â the world is crying. âWhat
luster!â âHow superb a gem!â While you, my poor
friend, who display upon your bosom the real stone, have
merely been credited with a meretricious taste for wearing
Palais Royal jewelry. Pardon! I have not deceived
youâor not in the way you imagine.... I said the
Blue Diamond should be yours.... It is! I said you
should be envied; you should, certainly. It is a thousand
pities you are only sneered at. I said you might be
happy.... It is most regrettable that you do not find
the happiness you looked for.
Au revoir
, dear lady,

au revoir
!â

She felt indisposed, and went home....

THE NIGHT OF POWER

In Two Parts

I

THE Doctor, stepping softly forth from the sick-room,
paused for a brief confidential parley with
the print-gowned, white-capped hospital nurse, who had
followed him. That functionary, gliding from his side,
evanished, with the falling of a curtain-sheet soaked in
disinfectant and the closing of a door, into the Blue-Beard
chamber beyond, leaving the man of medicine
free to pursue his portly way downstairs.

At the bottom of the second flight one of the hotel servants
stopped him with a respectful murmur and a salver
with a card upon it; and the Doctor, reading the name
thereon by the help of a pair of gold-rimmed glasses,
inclined his neatly-shaved, gray-blue chin toward the
mourning diamond discreetly twinkling amid the billows
of black satin that rolled into the bosom of his
capacious waistcoat, saying:

âThe wife of my patient upstairs? Certainly; I will
see the lady at once. Which way?â

His responsible, square-toed, patent-leather boots had
not much farther to carry him. The lady and her maid
were waiting in a sitting-room upon the next landing.
Under the fashionable physicianâs heavy yellow eyelidsâlivery
eyelids, if one might dare to hint soâlay the
[135]

faculty of keen observation. He noticed, in the moment
of recovery from a justly-celebrated bow, that the maid
was in tears, and the mistress was not.

He presupposed that he had the pleasure of addressing
Mrs. Rosval. Mrs. Rosval answered that he had. Then
the maid uttered a sob like the popping of a soda-water
cork, and Mrs. Rosval said:

âMatilda, be quiet!â

She was a woman of supple figure and of medium
height. She appeared to be elegantly dressed, though
no one garment that she wore asserted itself as having
been expensive. The eyes that looked at the Doctor
through her thick black veil struck him as being unnaturally
brilliant. This fact, together with the composure
of her voice and manner, confirmed him in the belief
that the woman was in a highly-strung condition of
emotional excitement. He was mentally evolving a little
prescriptionâwith bromide in it, to be taken every three
hoursâwhen she lifted her hands and unpinned the veil.
Then the Doctor looked in the face of a woman who was
as perfectly calm, cool, and composed as he was himself.
Even more so because the revelation rather surprised
him.

She addressed him in clear, quiet tones:

âA telegraphic message was delivered to me this morningâââ

âAt Mirkwood Park, near Bradford,â the Doctor unconsciously
quoted aloud from the card he still held between
his plump white thumb and forefinger.

âIt purported to come from the proprietor of this
hotel. It said that Mr.âthat my husband was dangerously
illâthat my presence was urgently needed.â Mrs.
Rosvalâs lipsâdelicately chiseled lips, but totally devoid
of colorâshaped themselves into something that might
[136]

have been a smile. And as the maid, who nursed a
dressing-bag in the background, at this juncture emitted
a sniff, the mistress glanced again over her shoulder, and
said, with a slight accent of weariness or contempt, or
both together: âReally, Matilda, there is no need for
that!â

The irrefragable Doctor had gauged the shallow depths
of the womanâs nature by this time. She was merely a
polished and singularly adamantine specimen of the unfeeling
wife. He allowed a tinge of rebuke to color the
tone of his explanation.

âThe proprietor acted upon myâahâadvice. The
condition of my patient may be truthfully described asâerâdangerous.
The illness isâin factâtyphoid fever.
And your husband has it in a bad form. There are complications
whichâââ

The Doctor stopped short. For Mrs. Rosval was not
listening. She was crumpling a piece of pinkish paper
into a ballâprobably the telegram to which she had
alludedâand pondering. Then she leveled those strangely
brilliant, narrow-lidded eyes of hers point-blank at the
Doctor, and asked: âAm I to understand that Mr. Rosval
has nothing to do withâmy being sent for?â

The Doctor conveyed the information that Mr. Rosval
had not prompted the step. Mr. Rosval had beenâsince
the third day following on theâahâdevelopment of the
illnessâringing the changes between delirium andâahâcoma.
Forâas the Doctor had already saidâthere were
complicationsââ

Mrs. Rosval neatly stopped the ball, for the second
time.

âHow did you know, if
he
did not tell you, that there
was a Mrs. Rosval? How did you get at my address?â

The Doctor, swelling with the indignity of being supposed
[137]

to have got at anybodyâs address, explained that
the proprietor of the hotel, having some faint inkling
that Mr. Rosval belonged to the class of landed gentleman,
had looked up the name in
Burke
.

The sharp suspicion faded out of Mrs. Rosvalâs eyes as
she listened. It was a perfectly credible, perfectly simple
explanation. She tossed the crumpled telegram into the
fireâwhich devoured it at a gulpâand began to pull off
her gloves. That was her way of intimating that she
accepted the situation. Then she rang the bell. The
decorous waiter appeared, and she gave the man a quiet
order, handing him some loose silver and a slip of paper,
upon which she had penciled a few words.

âA cab is waiting at the door. Pay the driver and
send him away. A person who isânot quite a gentlemanâis
waiting in the vestibule. Say to him that Mrs.
Rosval is satisfied, and there is no need to wait. Give
him that paper at the same moment, or he will not believe
you!â As the waiter vanished she turned to the
Doctor with the faintest flicker of a smile upon her sensitive
pale lips. âI thought it wisest to keep the cab, in
case I required to leave this place hurriedly,â said Mrs.
Rosval. âThe man waiting downstairs is a detective
from a well-known Agency. I judged it best to enlist
his servicesâhe would have proved useful supposing this
business of the telegram to have been a Trap.â

The Doctor spread his large white hands, danglingly,
like a sealâs flappers.

âA trap?â he repeated, helplessly. âMy dear madam!
You suspected that some designing person or persons unknown
mightâpossibly use your husbandâs name, invent
a story of his illness as a ruse toâentrap you?â

âI suspected,â returned Mrs. Rosval, âno unknown
person. The inventor of the ruse would have been my
[138]

husband. We separated some years ago by mutual consent.
At least, I refused to live with him any longer,
and heâknowing what grounds I had for the refusalâwas
obliged to submit. But he resented my action in the
matter.â Mrs. Rosval raised her delicate dark eyebrows
with weary disdain, and imparted to her shoulders a
mute eloquence of contempt which is not the prerogative
of an English-bred woman. âAnd he has, more than
once, had recourse to what, for want of a better word,
I call Traps. That is all. Matilda,â she addressed the
tearful maid, âdry your eyes and tell the people downstairs
that I engage this suite of rooms. Two bedrooms,
a bathroom, and sitting-room at ten guineas a week, I
think they said? Horribly expensive, but it cannot be
helped. And now, Doctorââshe turned again to the
Doctorââwhen do you wish me to see your patient? At
once? It shall be at once if you say so! I am completely
in your hands!â

The Doctor, a little staggered by the deftness of his
patientâs wife in transferring the onus of the situation
from her shoulders to his own, absolutely prohibited any
suggestion of her entering the sick-room until refreshed
and rested. Mrs. Rosval acquiesced, with a repetition of
that compromising statement about being completely in
his handsâand the Doctor took his leave, promising to
return later that evening. She gave him her cool fingers,
and they parted. He had no sooner reached the door
than she called him back.

âI only wanted to askââ Of course, you have a
library. Does the catalogue of your library include a
file of the
Daily Telegraph
?â It did, the Doctor admitted.
File in question extending some twelve years
back.

âThree will do,â said Mrs. Rosval, warming one slender
[139]

arched foot upon the fender. âNext time you are in
want of a little light reading, look in the Law Intelligence,
Divorce Division, month of February, 1899, where
you will find a case: âFfrench
v.
Ffrench; Rosval cited.â
The details will explain a good deal that may appear
puzzling to you with regard to the strained relations between
Mr. Rosval and myself. Though doctors never
allow themselves to be puzzled, do they?
Au revoir!
â

II

The Doctor had had an unusually busy day of it. But
he curtailed his after-dinner nap in order to glance
through the Law Intelligence records of the month of
February, 1899. There was much in the case to which
Mrs. Rosval had referred that went far toward justifying
the âstrained relationsâ she had hinted at. And it is
the duty of the medical profession to rally at the war-cry
of the outraged Proprieties. But, when alone and unobserved,
doctors have many points in common with
mere men. And as this Doctor stepped into his brougham
he said, âWomen are very hard! In all human probability
the man was innocent.â He said again, âWomen
are hard!â as he creaked up the hotel staircase.

He found her in the sick-room. She had changed her
dress for something that gave out no assertive silken
rustle in answer to her movements, something that draped
the charming contour of her figureâshe had a charming
figureâwith soft, quiet folds, like the wings of a dun
hawkmoth. That fell composure still walled her in as
with ramparts of steel. She held the bed-curtain back
as the Doctor stooped over the livid, discolored face upon
the pillow. She took a linen cloth from the nurse, and
[140]

deftly, lightly wiped away the froth and mucus that had
gathered about the cracked and bleeding lips. But the
hand that rendered these offices was as steady as though
it had been carved out of white marble.

Disturbed from his lethargy by the invasion of candlelight
upon his haggard eyelids and the Doctorâs bass
murmur in his ear, the sick man began to talk a little.
For the most part it was mere gabble, but some sentences
were plain. He moaned piteously for a barber, because
he was unshaven. Rosval had always been foolishly vain
of his personal appearance. And he damned the one
glass of bad water, to the imbibition of which he attributed
his disease, promising, if he got well, never to
drink any more. To do him credit, he had never been
addicted to that particular form of liquid refreshment.
The Doctor inferred as much from his diagnosisâand
from the faint sarcastic quiver of Mrs. Rosvalâs white
lips. Then the tongue of the man ceased waggingâbut
the burning head began to thresh to and fro upon the
pillow, and the claw-like hands to scratch at the bed-clothes
in a fresh access of the maddening enteric irritation.
Alleviating measures proved as effective as alleviating
measures generally do prove; the head went on
rolling, and the crooked talons continued to tear. All
at once they were quiet. Mrs. Rosval had laid her hand
upon the clammy foreheadâabout as tenderly, to all
appearance, as she would have laid it upon the back of
a chair. And the man was still. She placed the other
hand beside the firstâthe drawn lines about the nostrils
relaxed, the clenched teeth parted, the breast rose and
fell with the indrawing and outgoing of a sigh of relief.
And the man slept. So soundly that she moved from
him presently, without disturbing him, and passed into
[141]

the room adjoining, where the Doctor and the nurse were
holding a whispered confabulation.

There would be no need to send in another professional
attendant, the nurse said, now that the patientâs wife
had arrived. She possessed a remarkable ability for
nursing, and extraordinary self-command. She shrank
from nothingânot even the most repugnant duties of
the sick-chamber. The nurse had met in her time with
ladies who took things coolly; but this lady really surprised
her.

The Doctor was in the act of shaking his headânot
from side to side, but up and downâa gesture which expressed
indulgent tolerance of the nurseâs surprise while
it repudiated the notion of his entertaining any on his
own accountâwhen he jumped. For a calm, quiet voice
at his elbow said:

âYou told me that Mr. Rosval was dangerously ill.
Is he dying?â

The nurse had vanished into the carbolic-laden atmosphere
of the Chamber of Horrors.

âMy dear madam, your husband is in the Handsâââ
So the Doctor was beginning, when the obvious inappropriateness
of the stereotyped formula stopped him short.
Then he admitted that the condition of the man in the
other room was very precarious. That he could not,
when not in
articulo mortis
, be said to be dyingâbut
that, toward the small hours of the morning, he might
attain to a pitch of prostration closely allied to that condition.
And that nothing could be done for him but to
give him milk and medicine regularly, andââ The
Doctor would have ended âand trust in Providence,â but
for obvious reasons he thought better of it. Then he
went away, feeling quite certain in his own mind that
[142]

Mrs. Rosval would be a widow before twenty-four hours
were over.

That lady, meanwhile, returning to the sick-room, had
persuaded the fagged nurse to go and lie down. She
understood how to do all that was necessary, she whispered,
and would call the attendant if any change occurred.
Then she sat down at the foot of the bed, and
prepared to keep her vigil with unshaken fortitude. The
sleeping woman in the next room breathed heavily, the
sounds of rolling wheels and jarring voices grew less and
lessâthen all fell quiet. About three hours before the
dawn the sleeper awakened. The hollow eyes no longer
turned on her with the blind, glassy stare of delirium.
There was reason in Rosvalâs look, and memory.

He seemed to beckon, and she came near. She had to
stoop to catch the moaning whisper that asked: âHowâdid
youâcome here?â

She answered steadily, âThey sent for me.â

âTheyâd not haveâif
I
had known!â Rosval gasped.

âIf I annoy you,â said Mrs. Rosval, with icy tolerance,
âI can go!â She turned, meaning to call the nurse;
but a claw-like hand went weakly out and caught at her
skirts. The grasp was no stronger than that of a newborn
child, but, just for that it
was
so feeble, it held her.

âYouâll not go! Three yearsâyouâve treated meâlike
a leper! Never wouldâlisten to what Iâd got to
say. But now ... Iâtell you, sheâsat onâmy knee
andâkissed me! Before I knew itâand thenâthe husband
came in! A plant, by Gad!â

Mrs. Rosval said, âYou must not talk. The Doctor
says you are not to talk,â and busied herself with the
bottles and glasses that occupied a little stand near the
bedside.

Rosval condemned the Doctor. Mrs. Rosval measured
[143]

out his medicine, raised his head with professional skill,
and offered him the glass. He clenched his teeth, and
defied her with gaunt eyes across the brim.

âNo! No milkâno doctorâs stuff. Iâve been going to
the devilâfor three years past,â proclaimed the sinner,
feebly. âWhy not goâat onceâand have done with it?â
Then he fell back heavily on the pillow.

Mrs. Rosval summoned the nurse. The nurse could do
nothing. For the moribund was obdurate, and every
fresh manifestation of obduracy drove not one, but half a
gross of nails into his coffin. That casket was fast progressing
toward completion, when Mrs. Rosval conceived
a desperate idea. The execution of it cost her a severe
struggle. Stooping down, she whispered to the sinking
man:

âJack!â

His faded eyes rolled in their sunken sockets until they
rested on her. He said with difficulty:

âWell?â

âWhat will make you take it?â

Something like a gleam of cunning came into the face.
The answer came:

âKiss me!â

She battled with herself for a moment silently, and
then, bending closer, touched his forehead with her lips.

âThat isnât all! You must say: â
I forgive you!
ââ

âI canât!â

âAllâright, then!â

Silence ensued. The angles of the features were growing
pinched and sharp; a bluish shade was creeping
about the mouth. She cast a glance of scorn at her own
reflection, caught in a mirror that hung against the opposite
wall, and said the words:

âI forgive you! Isnât that enough?â

[144]
âNot quite. â
I love youâandââ
ââ

The voice was getting very faint.

âI love youâdearâandâââ

âAnd â
I take you back!
ââ

âI take you back.â Her iron fortitude was broken.
She said it with a sob, and gathered the weak head to
her bosom, being the kind of woman who does not do
things by halves.

A month later the Doctor received a check. It was a
handsome check, enclosed with the thanks and compliments
of Mr. and Mrs. Rosval, on leaving London.

âCarried him off with her into the country,â said the
Doctor, tapping his teeth with a paper-knife as he closed
the volume of the
Daily Telegraph
which contained the
case âFfrench
v.
Ffrench; Rosval cited.â âIn other
words, taken him back. And in all human probability
the man was guilty. Women are very weak!â

[145]

THE MAN WHO COULD MANAGE
WOMEN

OR thought he could. Which comes to the same
thing. His name was Yethill, and he was a Junior
Captain in the R. A.

Yethill belonged to the New School; he was a specimen
of the latest military development of the age. By
their smoked spectacles shall ye know Yethill and his
peers; by the right foot, which is broadened by the lathe;
by the right thumb, which is yellowed with acids and
sticky with collodion; by the hard-bitten, pragmatical,
theoretical, didactic way of treating all mysteries in
heavenâa locality which is interesting only in virtue of
the opportunities afforded to trick aviatorsâand earth,
in which mines may be dug, and upon which experiments
may be carried on. These men wake themselves
in the morning, and heat their shaving water by means
of electrical machines of their own invention. They
carry kodaks in their bosoms, and are, in the matter of
imparting information, human volcanoes continually in
eruption.

Yethill was not behind his fellows in this respect.
When he had said his little say upon the Theory of Wireless
Photophony, the Detection of Subterranean Mines
by the K Rays, and the irresponsibility of the bedbug
in connection with beri-beri; when he had told the Head
of the Electrical Department how many watts are equivalent
to a horse-power, and explained to the Colonel,
who is sinfully proud of his men, that the employment
[146]

of the uneducated inferior in warfare will cease with the
century, and that the army of the future will consist
entirely of officers, he would drop his voice to a confidential
whisper and control his elbows. He talked heliographically
as a rule, and if a man were left to listen to
himâhe could, as a rule, clear the Mess smoking-room
in ten minutes from the startâhe would dilate at length
upon his best-loved hobby, the art of managing women.

Yethill was no Adonis. He had a knobby, argumentative
head, a harlequin set of features, each separate one
belonging to a different order and period of facial architecture;
and a figure which was not calculated, as his
tailor observed with bitterness, to do justice to a good
cut. But it was wonderful to hear him talk in that conquering,
masterful way of his. He had an appalling
array of statistics to prove that the majority of marriages
were miserable; that life, connubially speaking,
was dust and ashes in the mouths of nineteen Benedicts
out of twenty. But the darkest hour presaged the dawn.
Let the man about to marry, let the already-married,
but adopt the Yethill system of sweetheart-and-wife
breaking, and thenceforth all would be well. And thousands
of voices arising from the uttermost ends of the
civilized earth would hail with one accord Yethill as
their deliverer.

Then came an essay on the New Art of Courtship.

âTo a man,â Yethill would say, jerking his knee and
stammering a little, as his custom was when excited,
âwho is a reasonable being, the woman he loves is a
womanâonly spelt with a big âWâ; the woman he likes
is a woman spelt in the ordinary way; and the woman
he doesnât like is a mere creature of the female sex. To
a woman,â Yethill would continue, âwho is, nineteen
[147]

times out of twenty, a perfectly unreasonable being;âthe
man she loves is a demi-god; the man she doesnât
love is a man;âand the man she dislikes is a gorilla.
She quite overlooks the fact that in every individual
human male these three may be found united. And man
is weak enough to humor her. So that out of so many
marriages that take place, a majorityâa frightful majorityâare
founded upon illusions. And the subsequent
state of conjugality may be called a state of evolution,
in which these primary illusions, after undergoing a
process of disarrangement and disintegration, are finally
reduced to impalpable powder, and the Bed Rock of
Reality is laid bare. We know what happens after that!â

The listening man generally knew enough to grunt an
affirmative. And Yethill would, with many weird facial
jerks and twitches, go on to explain the system.

The great system was, like all other wonderful discoveries,
involved in a very simple plan of procedure. It
consisted only in reversing the accepted order of things.
A man, supposedly desirous of getting married, recognizing
in himself the existence of the trinity above mentioned,
should assert the existence of the third person
from the very outsetâsuppress the demi-god, show the
gorilla. Let the woman you were about to make your
wife see the worst of you before you showed her the
best. Let her pass through the burning fiery furnace
before you admitted her into the Paradise that is the
reward of proved devotion. Let her know what bullying
meant before you took to pettingâblame her weaknesses
before you praised her virtues. Under this
rÃ©gime
there
would be no illusions to commence with; and married
life, instead of being full of disappointments, would be
replete with delightful surprises. Your wife married you,
believing you to be a gorilla.

[148]
âThereâs the weak point,â the listener would interpolate.
âWhat woman, unless a lunatic of sorts,
would

marry a gorilla?â

Yethill would not hear of this objection. He was always
deaf when you came to it. He would pound onâdilate
on the surprise and joy with which she found that
she had married a man, and the rapture with which she
would greet the final discovery that she had got hold of
a demi-god.

âIt sounds splendid,â the other men would say, âbut
it wonât wash. Look here, Iâm going to take Miss So-and-So
up to a Gaiety
matinÃ©e
to-morrow. To follow
up your system I ought to call for her in my worst
clothes, be surly on the way to the station, and neglectful
in the tunnels. I ought to dump her into her stall
like a sack, go out to âsee a manâ between every act, and
take it for granted that she doesnât want cool tea and
warm ices. You know thatâd never do! Sheâd give me
the bag to-morrow. And sheâd be right!â

But Yethill hearkened not. There was excitement at
the Arsenal, and much babbling in barracks, the day on
which it was publicly made known that Yethill contemplated
giving an object-lesson in support of his great
system very shortly.

The object was Miss Sallis.

Miss Sallis was a fluffy little pink-and-white girl, the
daughter of a retired Admiral, who lived near the Dockyard.

Men had dined with Miss Sallis, and played tennis
with Miss Sallis, and flirted with Miss Sallis, during
several seasons past. Some of them had asked for her
handâshe wore fives in glovesâand had not got it.
Thus, Yethillâs announcement was received with a certain
degree of risibility. No bets were made upon the
[149]

chances of Yethillâs getting her, the odds against his acceptance
were too tremendous. Yethill proposed. He
mentioned that his prospects of advancement in the
Service were not very promising; that his scientific pursuits
would have to be relinquished if he were to set up
an establishment on even a moderate scale, and that he
did not intend to relinquish those pursuits; that there
were several hereditary diseases in his family; that,
while bestowing upon the lady he honored with the offer
of his hand a regard which justified his proposal, he
should not have made that proposal had the lady been
poorâwith other statements of equal candor. A more
wonderful proposal was never made.

What was more wonderful still, Miss Sallis accepted
him! He bought her a ring, containing three small fragments
of petrified red-currant jelly, embedded in fifteen-carat
gold; and when she asked him to put it on her
finger said, âOh, rot!â and wouldnât. He spent a certain
amount of time with his betrothed, but invariably carried
a scientific work in his pocket, wherein he might
openly take refuge when the primrose paths of love
proved wearisome. He forbade her to dance with other
men, and did not dance with her himself. He snubbed
her when she asked questions about his camera, his lathe,
his batteries, and tried timidly to be interested in magnets
and inductors, acids and cells, because they interested

him
. He carried out his system thoroughly. If
Miss Sallis
had
any illusions about Yethill he bowled
the poor little thing over, right and left, like ninepins,
long before the wedding day.

With the loss of her illusions went some of her good
looks. She made a pretty-looking little bride. With her
fluffy pale hair, her pink nose, and her pink eyelids, a
not remote resemblance to an Angora kitten was traced
[150]

in her. She was married in a traveling-gown, without
any bridesmaids; and after the wedding-breakfast Captain
and Mrs. Yethill drove home to their lodgings on
the Common. The wedding-trip had been abandonedâfrom
no lack of money, but because Yethill said he had
had enough of traveling, and the custom of carrying a
bride away, as if in triumph, to the accompaniment of
rice and slippers, was âguff.â He certainly played the
gorilla as if to the manner born. The poor little woman
loved him; he loved her. But as his skull was made of
seven-inch armor-plate, he went on knocking it against
his system. He had got used to the gorilla-business, and
couldnât leave it off. Yet, out of his wifeâs sight and
hearing, he was a doting husband. The Duke in the

Story of Patient Griseldis
must have been a man of Yethillâs
stamp.

Mrs. Yethill, as time went on, began to be a walking
manifestation of the effects of the system. She lost her
gaiety and her pink cheeks; her smile became nervous
and her dress dowdy. The little vanities, the little weaknesses,
the little affectations, which had helped to make
Miss Sallis charming, had been bullied out of Mrs. Yethillâs
character until it was as destitute of any blade of
verdure as a skating-rink. She had proved herself the
most patient, loving, tolerant of wives; but Yethill went
on trying her. She stood the trials, and he invented new
testsâexactly as if she had been a Government bayonet
or a regulation sword-blade. A bright man Yethill!

They were called upon, and returned visits, at intervals.
A taste for society was one of the tendencies which
were to be chastened. Female friends were prohibited,
as being likely to sow the seed of incipient rebellion
against the system.

âI donât care, Tom, if I have you!â said Mrs. Yethill,
[151]

patting her gorilla, who, mindful of his own tenets, was
careful not to exhibit any appreciation of her attention.
But he made up for it by boasting that evening in the
smoking-room, until those who hearkened with difficulty
prevented themselves from braining him with legs of
chairs. Their wives would have commended them for
the deed. Yethill had not many admirers about this
period.

But he went on blindly. Can one ever forget how he
crowed over having cured Mrs. Yethill of a tendency
toward jealousy, of the vague and indiscriminating kind?
The prescription consisted in posting to himself letters
highly scented and addressed in a variety of feminine
scrawls. Yethill was good at imitating handwriting!âand
he absented himself from the domestic hearth for
several days together whenever there was a recurrence
of the symptoms. The method wrought a wonderful
cure; but Mrs. Yethill began to grow elderly from about
this period. You could hardly have called her a young
woman, when the baby came, and brought his motherâs
lost youth back to her, clenched in one pudgy hand. The
vanished roses fluttered back and perched upon her thin
cheekbones again. She was heard to laugh. Her husband,
who secretly adored her, and who had continued
to stick to the system more from a desire for
her
glorification
than his own, feared a retrogression. So he
thought out a new torture or two, and put them into
active application. He sneered at the puerilities of
nursery talk. He downcried the beauty and attainments
of the baby when she praised them. He pooh-poohed
her motherly fears, when the ailments inseparable from
the joyous period of infancy overtook his heir. This was
the last straw laid upon Mrs. Yethillâs aching shoulders.
The downfall of the great system followed.

[152]
In this way. His wife came into his workshop one
morning. The workshop was forbidden ground, and Yethill
dropped the negative he was developing, and turned
to stare. He saw that she was very pale, and that her
lips were bitten in. He heard her say that there was
something the matter with baby, and she wanted the
doctor.

Solely in the interests of his wife whom he esteemed
above all living women, Yethill refused to allow the doctor
to be sent for. The child was as right as a trivet.
Women were always worrying. She was to get away
with her nonsense, and leave him in peace. With more
to the same effect. She drooped her head, and went
away obediently, only to return in half an hour, with
another version of the same prayer upon her lips. Would
heâwould he come and look for himself? Yethill was
thoroughly annoyed. Yethill refused. Yethill went on,
stubbornly, dabbling with his negatives, until right from
overheadâbabyâs nursery was above the workshopâYethill
had never heard a woman scream like that before....
Something like an ice-bolt shot down his
spine. He dashed up to the nursery, and looked in. The
sight he saw there sent him tearing across the Common,
a hatless, coatless man, to the Doctorâs house.

When the Doctor came he said he could be of no use;
he ought to have been called in an hour ago. And
Yethill, hearing this fiat, and meeting his wifeâs eyes
across the table, felt the system totter to its foundations.

He found himself wondering at her for taking babyâs
end so quietly; but he had schooled her to endure silently.
There were no tearsâhe had always jeered at
tears. The Doctor took him aside before he left.

âYou must treat your wife with kindnessâand consideration,
[153]

Yethill,â said the Doctor, âor I wonât answer
for the consequences!â

As if Yethill needed to be told to be kind or considerate!
As if Yethill had never lovedâdid not loveâthe
late Miss Sallis! He planned a revelation for her
without delay. He would take her in his arms; kiss her,
and tell her that her time of trial was overpast; give
her her meed of praise for her heroism, her meed of sympathy
for her griefâand his. And he would own that he
had made a mistake in the matter of baby deceased.
And she would forgiveâas she always had forgiven.

As he decided this, she came into the room. She was
quite composed. She carried something behind her. She
spoke to him very quietly in a dull, strange, level voiceâso
strange a voice that, just as he was about to open his
arms and say, âAnnie!â in the voice he had been saving
up for the Day of Revelation, the gesture and the word
wouldnât come.

âTom,â said Mrs. Yethill, âwhat should you say if I
told you that I had made up my mind to kill myself?â

She brought her hand from behind her; it held one of
Yethillâs revolvers. She had been very much afraid of
these lethal instruments in the early days of her marriage,
but under the system had learned to clean them,
and even drew the cartridges. But the thing she held
wasnât loaded, Yethill was quite sure of that. It sealed
up the fountain of his admiring tenderness to have her
treat him to commonplace, vulgar heroics. It put her
out of drawing, and Yethill out of temper.

She asked again:

âWhat would you say if I told you I mean to kill
myself?â

Yethill ran his armor-plated head against the last wall.
He answered brutally:

[154]
âI should tell you, if you were such a fool as to
threaten such a thing, to do it, and have done with it!â

She said, âVery well!ââand did it.

When people came running in, they found somethingâperhaps
it was the systemâscattered on the walls, on the
floor, everywhere. And Yethill was howling, and beating
his seven-inch skull against heavy pieces of furniture,
and calling on Annie to come back. But she had escaped,
and was in no hurry; and he hadnât the pluck to
follow her out of the world and apologize.

âWas she mad?â somebody asked the Doctor; and the
Doctor said:

âNo; but she might have become so if she had lived
much longer with a lunatic!â

âYou meanââ?â

âI mean,â said the Doctor, âthat Yethill has been suffering
from dementia for years. I mean that he will see
the inside of a Lunatic Asylum in six months from date.â

But the Doctor was wrong. He didâin three!

[155]

OBSESSED

ANDREW FENN is known to the world as an art
critic and essayist of unerring instinct and exquisite
refinement, a writer of charming
vers de sociÃ©tÃ©
,
and teller of tales supposedly designed for children, but
in reality more appreciated by children of a larger
growth. He is much sought after, but little to be found,
unless one has the
entrÃ©e
to his pleasant, roomy old
house in Church Street, Chelsea, where he lives in the
midst of his libraryâthe whole house is a libraryâhis
etchings and Japanese curios. He is less of a traveler
than he used to be; getting old, he says, and lazy, content
with old friends, soothed by old pipes, fortified by
old wineâhe has a supreme
goÃ»t
in winesâand nourished
by excellent cookery.

His household staff consists but of an elderly valet and
butler, and a housekeeper-cook. She has been in her
masterâs service twenty years, and is beginning to grow
handsome, Andrew is wont to say. Certainly, if her
master speaks the truth, she must have been, when comparatively
young, extraordinarily unlovely, this most excellent
of women. Even now she infallibly reminds the
casual beholder of an antique ecclesiastical gargoyle
much worn by weather. Her name is Ladds. She has
never been married, but respect for the position of authority
she occupies in Andrewâs household universally
accords her brevet rank. She might have occupied another,
and more important position, ifââ

âYes,â Andrew says, when he is disposed to tell the
[156]

storyâand he often does tell it to intimate friends,
leaning back on the library divan, after a cosy dinner,
holding his gray beard in one big fist, still brown with
tropical sunshineââLadds is an excellent creature. She
might have married me, might Ladds!â

We invariably chorus astonishment. Then some of
Laddsâ famous coffee comes in, and Andrew gets up to
hunt for precious liquors, and, having found them, continues:

âI came
very
near marrying herâonce.â

Somebody growls: âGood job you pulled up in time!â

Andrew rounds on the somebody. â
I
didnât pull up.

She
did. Refused me!â

There is a general howl.

âI am telling you men the truth,â Andrew says, pulling
the gray beard. âFifteen years ago I was infatuated
with that woman. She possessed my every thought; she
dominated me, likeâââ

âLike a nightmare!â

âApposite illustration,â says Andrew, nodding. â
Like

a nightmare. It was just about the time I published my
book,
Studies of the Human Grotesque in Art, Ancient
and Modern
. You remember, some of you, I was keen
on the subjectâhad been for years. And I was a traveler
and collector in those days: Iâd got together a wonderful
show of illustrative subjects. You wonât see many
of âem now. I gave them to the Smoketown Mechanical
Institute afterward.â

He pulls at his long cherrystick, and blows a cloud of
Latakia, and goes on:

âIâd the whole house full. Peruvian idols, Aztec picture
writings, Polynesian and Maori war masks; Chinese
and Japanese, Burmese and Abyssinian, Hindu and
Persian monstrosities of every kind; Egyptian, Carthaginian,
[157]

Babylonian, Druidical, Gothicââ Well, well!
Iâm thoroughgoing, and when I do a thing I do it thoroughly.
Itâs enough to say that every variety of libel
upon the human face and form that human ingenuity or
depravity has ever perpetrated, Iâd carefully collected
and brought together here.â

He waves his hand, with a curious cabalistical ring
upon it that once belonged, it is said, to Eliphas LÃ©vi,
who had it from Albertus Magnus. But this may be
mere report.

âI worked hard, and drank a great deal of coffee,â
says Andrew, âso much that my old housekeeper began
to be afraid something mysterious was the matter with
me. She expostulated at last, and I explained. Then
she got interested in the book; she was an intelligent
woman, poor dear old soul, and she got specially interested
in that section of the work which deals with the
Grotesque in Nature. Everything in humanity that is
purely grotesqueânot deformed, unnatural, outrageous,
but purely quaint and bizarreâI piled into those chapters.
The work is illustrative, you know, as well as
descriptive, and the queer photographs and engravings
that scientific friends had contributed to this particular
portion of it absolutely fascinated the dear old lady.

ââTo be sure, Master Andrewâ (she had known me
from my knickerbocker and peg-top days), âbut them
are queer folk. And, my heart alive!ââshe uttered a
sharp screamââif that picture isnât the exact moral of
Jane Ladds!â

âI glanced over her shoulder. It
was
a portrait of
Jane, certainlyâa rude little wood cut of the sixteenth
century, purporting to be a portrait of a female jester,
attached, in her diverting capacity, to the Court of
Mary Tudor, during the latter part of her reign, and
[158]

mentioned by name in some of the accounts of the Royal
household as âJeanne la Folle.â Unless the long-dead
delineator of her vanished charms has shamefully belied
them, Jeanne must have been one of the most grotesquely
hideous specimens of womanhood that ever existed.
Judge, then, whether the exclamation of my housekeeper
awakened my interest, excited my curiosity, or left me
apathetic and unmoved!â

We are silent. Our interest, our curiosity, are urging
us to hurry on the conclusion of Andrewâs story.

âYou may suppose that I bombarded my housekeeper
with questions. What? Did a living counterpart of the
sixteenth-century joculatrix exist in the nineteenth?
What was her station in life? Where was she to be
found? In reply, I elicited the fact that Jane Ladds
was a countrywoman of my own, the daughter of a
wheelwright living in the village of Wickham, in Dorsetshire,
where I myself had first seen the light. Jane was
some half dozen years my junior, it appeared. My
mother had once taken her into her service as under-scullerymaid,
but in a casual encounter with the last new
baby (my brother Robert, now commanding his battery
of the Royal Horse Artillery at Jelalabad), Janeâs facial
eccentricities had produced such a marked effect
(resulting in convulsions) that the unfortunate
protÃ©gÃ©e

had been hastily dismissed. Since when she had kept
house for her father, and was probably keeping it still;
there not being, said my housekeeper, the slightest human
probability that any potential husband would endeavor
to interfere with the wheelwrightâs domestic arrangements.â
There comes a twinkle into Andrewâs
brown eyes.

ââNo man would be mad enough!â the old lady said.
Judge of her surprise when I turned upon her and ordered
[159]

her to writeâwrite at once to Dorsetshire, ascertain
whether Jane was still alive, still available, willing
to take service, under an old acquaintance, in a bachelorâs
London establishment? Stunned as she was, my
housekeeper obeyed. The wages I instructed her to offer
were good. An answering letter arrived within the space
of a week, announcing Jane Laddsâ willingness to accept
the offered situation. The letter was nicely written. I
read and reread it with morbid excitement. I looked
forward to the day of the writerâs arrival with an excitement
more morbid still. At last the day came, and
the woman....â

We inspire deep breaths, and unanimously cry, âGo
on!â

âMy writing table was piled high with booksâI
couldnât see her until she came round the corner,â says
Andrew, âand stood by my chair. She wore her Sunday
clothesâWickham taste inclines to garments of many
colors. In silence I contemplated one of the finest examples
of the Animated Grotesque it had ever been my
fortune to look upon. Her hair was then redâthe
brightest red. Her nose was not so much a nose as a
pimple. Her mouth was the oddest of buttons. Her
forehead a ponderous coffer of bone, overhanging and
overshadowing the other features. She was lengthy of
arm, short of leg, dumpy of figure. She did not walkâshe
waddled; she did not sitâshe squatted. Her smile
was a gash, her curtsy the bob of an elder-pith puppet.
She was, as she is now, unique. You are all familiar
with her appearance. Search your memories for the moment
when that appearance dawned upon you first, intensify
your surprise, quadruple your sensations of delightâadd
to these, imagine yourself dominated by a
fascination, weird, strangeâinexplicable. In a wordâââ

[160]
Andrewâs pipe is out; he is gesticulating excitedly, and
his eyes have an odd gleam under his shaggy brows.

âShe took possession of me. I had her constantly
about me. She brought me everything I wanted. I was
never tired of gloating over my new-found treasure.
Every accent of her voice, every odd contortion of her
features, every awkward movement of her body was a
fresh revelation to me. All this while I was working at
my book. It was said afterward, in the newspapers, that
the entire work, especially the closing chapters on the
Human Grotesque, had been written in a fever of enthusiasm.
The reviewer never knew how rightly he had
guessed. Some of the theories I propounded and proved
were curious. That Ugliness is in reality the highest
form of Beautyâbeauty in the abstractâwas one of the
mildest. I believed it when I wrote it; for I was madly,
passionately infatuated with the ugliest woman I had
ever seenâmy parlor maid, Jane Ladds!â

We hang upon his words so that our pipes go out, and
our whisky and sodas stand untasted at our elbows.

âYes,â says Andrew, drawing a long, hard breath, âshe
possessed my thoughtsâdominated meâwaking and
sleeping. I had the queerest of dreams, in which, with a
joy that was anguish, a rapture that was horror, I saw
myself attending crowded assemblies with my wife, Jane
Fenn,
nÃ©e
Ladds, upon my arm. She wore my motherâs
diamonds, a
dÃ©colletÃ©e
gown from Worthâs; and as we
moved along together, sibilant whispers sounded in my
ears, and astonished eyes said as plainly, â
What
an ugly
woman!â

âThen would come other visions ... Jane at the
head of my table ... Jane rocking the cradle of our
eldest bornâan infant who strongly resembled his
mother ... Jane here, Jane thereâJane everywhere!...
[161]

My nerves, you will guess, must have been in a
very queer state.

âAll the time Jane Ladds would be deftly moving
about me, dusting my books and curios, or going on with
her sewing, or, to the utter stupefaction of my housekeeper,
I had issued orders that she should sit in the
window, where my glance might dwell upon her whenever
I lifted my head from my work. Late, late into
the small hours, when the sky began to gray toward the
dawning, and the ink in my stand got low, she used to
keep me company. Not the faintest shadow of impropriety
could attach to the association in any sane mind.
My housekeeper thought it queer, but nothing more.

âShe hadâshe hasâvery large, very rough, very red
hands. I used to imagine myself kissing one of those
hands when I should ask her to be my wife, and conjure
up the grotesque smile of shy delight with which she
would accept the unheard-of honor. The temptation to
snatch and kiss that awful hand became so powerful
that it cost me more effort than I can explain to resist
its ceaseless promptings. And I would chuckle as I
looked at it, and at the bizarre countenance that bent
over the stocking that was in process of being darnedâJaneâs
peculiar, shuffling gait seemed to have a peculiarly
wearing effect on stockingsâand wonder,
if she knew
,
how she would look, what she would say? Then she
would thread her needle, or bite the end of her worsted....
That hand! that hand! The struggle between the
masterful impulse to seize and kiss it, and the shuddering
desire not to do anything of the kind, would, upon
these occasions, be perfectly indescribable. Andâone
dayâthe very day that saw the completion of my bookâI
yielded!â

[162]
âYes?â we cry, interrogatively. All our eyes are
rounded, all our mouths wide open.

âShe saw some of my papers flutter to the carpet as I
pushed back my chair,â Andrew continues, âand obligingly
crossed the room, stooped and gathered them up.
A kind of mist came over my eyes, and when it cleared
away, she was thereâby my sideâholding the written
sheets out to me. That hand! I mustâI must! Before
the poor creature could hazard a guess at my intentions,
I seized itâI kissed itâwith a resounding smack. I
cried deliriously, âJane, will you be my wife? I adore
you, Jane!ââ

âAnd what did she do? What did she say?...â

âIâm coming to that! She drew away from me, and
turned very white, and her poor red hands trembled, and
her little button features twitched absurdly with the effort
she made to keep from crying. But, as I seized her
hands, and went on with my wild asseverations and
protestationsâHeaven only knows what I said!âthe
absurdity of the whole thing came on her, and she burst
out laughing wildly. Then I caught the infection, and
followed suit. Once I began, I couldnât stop. I was
shaken like a rag in the windâtorn, possessed by seven
devils of risibility. But I went on raging, all through it,
that she must marry me! At last she tore herself away,
and ran out of the room, breathlessly to burst upon my
housekeeper with the information that âMaster was mad,
and wanted the doctor.â And she was not far wrong, for
by the time he came I was fit for nothing but to be carried
to bed. Twenty-four hours later I was raving in
brain fever. Seven weeks that red-hot torture lasted,
and then I came to myself, and found that through all
the delirium and fever I had been patiently, uncomplainingly,
tenderly nursed by poor Jane....â

[163]
Andrewâs voice grows a little husky as he nears the
finish.

âWell, when I was convalescent, and knew that I owed
my life to her devotion, it seemed to me that only one
reparation was possible for the wrong I had done Jane.
It was a hard thing to doâthe madness being overâthe
morbid impulse that had swayed me being no longer in
the ascendant. But I did it! You may have noticedââhe
clears his husky throatââthat is, those among you
who have spoken to Laddsâ
that she has a singularly
sweet voice
âa voice curiously out of keeping with her
personality. Well, when she thanked me for my âkindnessâ
andârefused me, I might, supposing my eyes had
been shut, have fancied that I was listening to a beautiful
woman. She had been âmarked out by the Lordâ to
lead a lonely life, she said. When she was a young girl
it used to make her cry when the lads went by
her
, âwiâ
their vaices turned away,â and the girls laughed when
she put on a ribbon or a flower. But she got used to it;
and she quite understood that I was trying to make upâlike
a gentleman as I was;â(a mighty poor kind of gentleman,
I felt)ââfor summat as Iâd said when I didnât
know what I was a-saying!â Crazy people had queer
ideas, and the village âsoftyâ had once taken it into his
head that he was in love with Jane.... And she
thanked me for sticking to my word now that I was well,
and sheâd be my faithful servant always and for ever,
Amen! Years have passed since then.... Well, she
has kept her word. I hope, when the end of everything
comes for me, that honest, tender, devoted heart will be
beating by my pillow. I hopeâââ

Andrew breaks off abruptly, and gets up and wishes
us all good night.

[164]

A VANISHED HAND

âWHY,â
Daymond wrote, â
do you imagine that I
shall despise you for this confession? None but
a whole-souled, high-hearted woman could have made it!
You have said you love me, frankly; and I say in return
that had the fountains of my heart not been hopelessly
dried up at their sources, they must have sprung forth
gladly at such words from you. But the passion of love,
dear friend, it is for me no more to know; and I hold you
in too warm regard to offer you, in exchange for shekels
of pure Ophir gold, a defaced and worthless coinage!â

As Daymond penned the closing words of the sentence,
the last rays of the smoky-red London sunset were withdrawn.
Only a little while ago he had replenished the
fire with fresh logs; but they were damp, and charred
slowly, giving forth no pleasant flame. He struck a
match and lighted a taper that stood upon his writing
table. It created a feeble oasis of yellow radiance upon
the darkness of the great studio, and the shadow of Daymondâs
head and shoulders bending above it, was cast
upward in gigantesque caricature upon the skylight, reduced
to frosty white opacity by a burden of March
snow.

Daymond poised the drying pen in white, well-kept
fingers, and read over what he had written. Underlying
all the elegance of well-modeled phrases was the sheer
brutality of rejection, definitely expressed. His finely
[165]

strung mental organization revolted painfully at the imperative
necessity of being cruel.

âShe asks for bread,â he cried aloud, âand I am giving
her a stone!â The lofty walls and domed roof of his
workshop gave back the words to him, and his sensitive
ear noted the theatrical twang of the echo. Yet the
pang of remorse that had moved him to speech was quite
genuine.

â
You have heard my story
,â he wrote on.

A great many people had heard it, and had been bored
by it; but, sensitive as Daymondâs perceptions were, he
was not alive to this fact.

â
Seventeen years ago, while I was still a student
dreaming of fame in a draughty Paris studio, I met the
woman who was destinedâI felt it then as I know it
nowâto be the one love of my life. She was an American,
a little older than myself. She was divinely beautiful
to meâI hardly know whether she was really so or
not. We gave up all, each for each. She left husband,
home, friends, to devote her life to me. I
âââ

He paused, trying to sum up the list of his own sacrifices,
and ultimately left the break, as potent to express
much, and went on:

â
Guilty as I suppose we were, we were happy togetherâhow
happy I dare not even recall. Twenty-four
months our life together lasted, and then came the end.
It was the cholera year in Paris; the year which brought
me my first foretaste of success in Art, robbed me of all
joy in life.... She died. Horribly! suddenly! And
the best of me lies buried in her grave!
â

The muscles of his throat tightened with the rigor that
accompanies emotion; his eyelids smarted. He threw
back his still handsome head, and a tear fell shining on
the delicately scented paper underneath his hand. He
[166]

looked at the drop as it spread and soaked into a damp
little circle, and made no use of the blotting paper to
remove the stain. If any crudely candid observer had
told Daymond that he dandled this desolation of hisâtook
an Ã¦sthetic delight in his devotion to the coffined
handful of dust that had once lived and palpitated at his
touch, he would have been honestly outraged and surprised.
Yet the thing was true. He had made his sorrow
into a hobby-horse during the last fifteen years of
honest regret, of absolute faithfulness to the memory of
his dead mistress. It gratified him to see the well-trained
creature dance and perform the tricks of the

haute Ã©cole
. He was aware that the romance of that
past, which he regretted with such real sincerity, added
something to the glamour of his achieved reputation, his
established fame, in the eyes of the world. The halo
which it cast about him had increased his desirability
in the eyes of the great lady who, after affording him
numberless unutilized opportunities for the declaration
of a sentiment which her large handsome person and her
large handsome property had inspired in many other
men, had written him a frank, womanly letter, placing
these unreservedly at his disposal.... And Daymond,
in his conscious fidelity and unconscious vanity, must
perforce reply wintrily, nipping with the east wind of
non-reciprocity the mature passion tendrils which sought
to twine themselves about him. It was a painful task,
though the obligation of it tickled him agreeablyâanother
proof of the inconsistency of the man, who may be
regarded as a type of humanity; for we are all veritable
Daymonds, in that the medium which gives us back to
our own gloating eyes day by day is never the crystal
mirror of Truth, but such a lying glass as the charlatans
[167]

of centuries agone were wont to make for ancient Kings
and withered Queens to mop and mow in.

Daymond pushed back his chair, and got up, and began
to pace from end to end of the studio. The costly
Moorish carpets muffled the falling of his footsteps,
which intermittently sounded on the polished interspaces
of the parqueted floor, and then were lost again in velvet
silence. In the same way, his tall figure, with its
thoughtfully bending head and hands clasped behind it,
would be swallowed up among the looming shadows of
tall easels or faintly glimmering suggestions of sculptured
figures which here and there thrust portions of limbs, or
angles of faces, out of the duskâto appear again with
the twilit north window for its background, or emerge
once more upon the borders of the little island of tapershine.
So he moved amid the works of his genius restlessly
and wearily to and fro; and the incoherent mutterings
which broke from him showed that his thoughts
were running in the beaten track of years.

âIf I could see her againâif our eyes and lips and
hands and hearts might meet for even the fraction of a
minute, as they used to do, it would be enough. I could
wait then patiently through the slow decay of the cycles
for the turning of the key in the rusty wards, and the
clanking of my broken fetters on the echoing stone, and
the burst of light that shall herald my deliverance from
prison!...â He lifted his arms above his head. âOh,
my dead love, my dear love! if you are near, as I have
sometimes fancied you were, speak to me, touch meâonce,
only once!...â He waited a moment with closed
eyelids and outstretched hands, and then, with a dry sob
of baffled longing, stumbled back to his writing table,
where the little taper was flickering its last, and dropped
into his armchair.

[168]
âAnd other women talk of love to me. What wonder
I am cold as ice to them, remembering her!â

It was a scene he had gone through scores upon scores
of timesâwords and gestures varying according to the
pathetic inspiration of the moment. He knew that he
was pale, and that his eyes were bleared with weeping,
and he had a kind of triumph in the knowledge that the
pain of retrospective longing and of present loneliness
was so poignantly real and keen. Out of the blackness
behind his chair at that moment came a slight stir and
rustleânot the sough of a vagrant draught stirring
among folds of tapestry, but an undeniably human
sound. But half displeased with the suspicion that there
had been a witness to his agony, he turnedâturned and
saw Her, the well-beloved of the old, old time, standing
very near him.

Beyond a vivid sensation of astonishment, he felt
little. He did not tremble with fearâwhat was there
in that perfectly familiar face to fear? He did not fall,
stammering with incoherent rapture, at her feet. And
yet, a few moments ago, he had felt that for one such
sight of her, returned from the Unknowable to comfort
himâdragged back from the mysterious Beyond by his
strong yearningsâhe would have bartered fame, honor,
and wealthâsubmitted his body to unheard-of torturesâshed
his blood to the last heartâs drop. He had prayed
that a miracle might be performedâand the prayer had
been granted. He had longedâdesperately longedâto
look on her once moreâand the longing was satisfied.
And he could only stare wide-eyed, and gape with
dropped jaw, and say stupidly:

â
You?
â

For answer she turned her faceâin hue, and line, and
feature, no one whit alteredâso that the light might
[169]

illumine it fully, and stood so regarding him in silence.
Every pore of her seemed to drink in the sight of him;âher
lips were parted in breathless expectancy. Every
hair of the dark headâdressed in the fashion of fifteen
years ago; every fold of the loose dress she woreâa garment
he knew again; every lift and fall of her bosom
seemed to cry out dumbly to him. There was a half-quenched
spark glimmering in each of her deep eyes,
that might have wanted only one breath from his mouth
to break out into flame. Her hands hung clasped before
her. It seemed as if they were only waiting for the signal
to unclaspâfor the outspread arms to summon him
to her heart again. But the signal did not come. He
caught a breath, and repeated, dully:

âYou! It is you?â

She returned:

âIt is I!â

The well-known tones! Recollection upsprang in his
heart like a gush of icy waters. For a moment he was
thrilled to the center of his being. But the smitten nerve
chords ceased to vibrate in another moment, and he rose
to offer her a chair.

She moved across and took it, as he placed it by the
angle of the wide hearth; and lifted her skirts aside with
a movement that came back to him from a long way off,
like her tone in speakingâand, shading her deep gray
eyes from the dull red heat with her white left hand,
looked at him intently. He, having pushed his own seat
back into the borders of the shadowland beyond the
taperâs gleam and the hearth glow, looked back at her.
That hand of hers bore no ring. When he had broken
the plain gold link that had fettered it in time past, he
had set in its place a ruby that had belonged to his
mother. The ruby was on his finger now. He hid it
[170]

out of sight in the pocket of his velvet painting coat, not
knowing why he did so. And at that moment she broke
the silence with:

âYou see I have come to you at last!â

He replied, with conscious heaviness:

âYesâI see!â

âHas the time seemed long?... We have no time,
you know, where.... Is it many days since?...â

âMany days!â

âMy poor Robert!... Weeks?... Months?... Not
years?...â

âFifteen years....â

âFifteen years! And you have suffered all that time.
Oh, cruel! cruel! If there was more light here, I might
see your face more plainly. Dear face! I shall not love
it less if there are lines and marks of grief upon itâit
will not seem less handsome to me at forty than it did at
twenty-five! Ah, I wish there was more light!â The
old pettishly coaxing tones! âBut yet I do not wish for
it, lest it should show you any change in
me
!â

âYou are not changed in the least.â He drew breath
hard. âIt might be yesterdayââ,â he said, and left the
sentence unfinished.

âI am glad,â said the voice that he had been wont to
recall to memory as wooingly sweet. âThey have been
kinder than I knew.... Oh! it has always been so
painful to recall,â she went on, with the old little half
shrug, half shudder, âthat I died an
ugly
deathâthat I
was not pretty to look at as I lay in my coffin!...â

Daymond recoiled inwardly. That vanity, in a
woman, should not be eradicated by the fact of her having
simply ceased to exist, was an hypothesis never before
administered for his mental digestion.

âHow curiously it all happened,â she said, her full
[171]

tones trembling a little. âIt was autumnâdo you remember?âand
the trees in the Bois and the gardens of
the Luxembourg were getting yellowy brown. There
were well-dressed crowds walking on the Boulevards, and
sitting round the little tables outside the restaurants.
One could smell chloride of lime and carbolic acid crossing
the gutters, and see the braziers burning at the corners
of infected streets, and long strings of hearses going
by; but nothing seemed so unlikely as that either of us
should be taken ill and die. We were too wicked, you
said, and too happy! ... only the good, miserable people
were carried off, because any other world would be more
suitable to them than this.... It was nonsense, of
course, but it served us to laugh at. Then, because you
could not sell your great Salon picture, and we could
not afford the expense, you gave a supper at the
CafÃ©
des Trois Oiseaux
(
Cabinet particulier No. 6
)âand
ValÃ©ry and the others joined us. I was so happy that
night ... my new dress became me ... I wore yellow
rosesâyour favorite MarÃ©chal Nielâs. When I was putting
them in my bosom and my hair you came behind
and kissed me on the shoulder. O,
mon Dieu! mon Dieu!

I can feel it now! We went to the VariÃ©tÃ©s, and then to
supper. I had never felt so gay. People are like that, I
remember having heard, just when they are going to die.
ValÃ©ry gapedâI believe he was half in love with meâand
I teased him because I knew you would be jealous.
In those days you would have been jealous of the studio

Ã©corchÃ©
. Ha! ha! ha!â

Daymond shuddered. The recurrent French phrases
jarred on him; something in her voice and manner scarified
inexpressibly his sensitive perceptions. He wondered,
dumbly, whether she had always been like this?
She went on:

[172]
âAnd then, suddenly, in the midst of the laughter, the
champagne, the good dishesâthe pains of hell!â She
shuddered. âAnd then a blank, and waking up in bed at
the hospital, still in those torturesâand getting worse
and seeing in your white face that I was going to die!
Drip-drip! I could feel your tears falling upon my face,
upon my hand; but I was even impatient of you in my
pain. Once I fancied that I heard myself saying that I
hated you. Did I really?â

âI thinkâI believe you did! But, of courseâââ
Daymond stopped, and shuddered to the marrow as she
leaned across to him caressingly, so near that her draperies
brushed his knee and her breath fanned upon his
face.

âImagine it!â she cried, âthat I
hated
you!
You
to
whom I had given myselfâyou for whom I left myâââ

He interrupted, speaking in an odd, strained voice:
âNever mind that now.â

âI had always wished to die first,â she resumed, âbut
not in that way; not without leaving you a legacy of
kind words and kisses. Ah!â (her voice stole to his ears
most pleadingly), âdo you know that I have been here,
I cannot tell how long, and you have not kissed me once,
darling?â

She rose up in her placeâshe would have come to him,
but he sprang to his feet, and thrust out both hands to
keep her off, crying:

âNo! no!â

She sank back into her seat, looking at him wide-eyed
and wonderingly. âIs he afraid of me?â she whispered
to herself.

âI am not afraid of you,â Daymond returned almost
roughly. âBut you must make allowances for me at
first. Your sudden comingâthe surpriseâââ

[173]
âAh yes! the surpriseâand the joyââ?â

He cleared his throat and looked another way. He
was shamedly conscious that the emotion that stiffened
his tongue and hampered his gestures was something
widely different from joy. He spoke again, confusedly.
âThis seems like old timesâbeforeâââ

âBefore I died,â she said, âwithout bidding good-bye
to you. Dear! if you guessed how I have longed to
know what you said and did when it was all over, you
would not mind telling me.... â
Are they grievingâthose
whom I have left behind?
â is a question that is
often asked in the place I come from. You were sorry?
You cried? Ah! I know you must have cried!â

âI believe,â Daymond returned, moving restlessly in
his chair, âthat I did. And IâI kissed you, though the
doctors told me not to. I wanted to catch the cholera
and die, too, I believe!...â

âYes?â

âAnd when the people came withâthe coffin, Iââhe
bit his lipââI would not let them touch you!...â

âMy poor boy!â

He winced from the tenderness. He felt with indescribable
sensations the light pressure of that well-known
once well-loved touch upon his arm.

âAnd thenâafter the funeral, I believe I had a brain
fever.â He passed his hand through his waving, slightly
grizzled hair, as if to assist his lagging memoryâreally,
as an excuse for shaking off that intolerable burden of
her hand. âAnd when I recovered I found there was no
way to forgetfulnessââhe heard her sigh faintlyââexcept
through work. I worked thenâI am working still.â

âAlways alone?â

âGenerally alone. I have never married.â

âOf course not!â

[174]
A faint dissent began to stir in him at this matter-of-fact
acquiescence in his widowed turtle-like celibacy.
âIt may interest you to know,â he observed, with a touch
of the pompous manner which had grown upon him with
the growth of his reputation, âthat my career has been
successful in the strongest sense of the word. I have become,
I may say, one of the leaders of the world of Art.
Upon the decease or resignation of the President of the ââ,
it is more than probable that I shall be invited to
occupy his vacant place. And an intimation has reached
me, from certain eminent quartersââhe paused weightilyââthat
a baronetcy will be conferred upon me, in
that event!â

âYes?â

The tone betrayed an absolute lack of attention. She
had once been used to take a keen interest in his occupations;
to be cast down by his failures and elated by his
successes. Had that enthusiasm constituted the greater
part of her charm? In its absence Daymond began to
find herâmust it be confessed?âbut indifferent company.

In the embarrassment that momentarily stiffened him,
an old habit came to his rescue. Before he knew it, he
had taken a cigar from a silver box upon the writing
table, and was saying, with the politely apologetic accent
of the would-be smoker:

âMay I? You used not to mind!â

She made a gesture of assent. As the first rings of
bluish vapor mounted into the air, Daymond found her
watching him with those intent, expectant eyes.

Feeling himself bound to make some observation, he
said: âIt is very wonderful to me to see you here! It
was very good of you to come!â

She returned: âThey had to let me come, I think! I
[175]

begged soâI prayed so, that at lastâââ She paused.
Daymond was not listening. He was looking at her
steadfastly and pondering....

It had been his whim, in the first poignancy of bereavement,
to destroy all portraits of her, so that with
the lapse of years no faulty touch should bewray the
memory of her vanished beauty. It struck him now for
the first time that his brush had played the courtier, and
flattered her, for the most part, unblushingly. He found
himself criticizing unfavorably the turn of her throat
and the swell of her bosom, and the dark voluptuous
languishment of her look. The faint perfume of heliotrope
that was shaken forth now, as of old time, from
her hair and her garments no longer intoxicated, but
sickened him. This, then, was the woman he had
mourned for fifteen years! He began to feel that he had
murmured unwisely at the dispensation of Providence.
He began to revolt at this recrudescence of an outworn
passionâto realize that at twenty-five he had taken a
commonplace woman for a divinityâa woman whom, if
she had not died when she did, he would have wearied ofâended
perhaps in hating. He found himself in danger
of hating her now.

âAt last they let me come. They said I should repent
itâas if I could!â Her eyes rested on him lingeringly;
her hand stilled the eager trembling of her lips. âNever!
Of course, you seemed a little strange at first. You are
not quiteânot quite yourself now; it is naturalâafter
fifteen years. And presently, when I tell youââ Oh!
what will you say when I tell you all?â

She left her chair and came toward him, so swiftly
that he had not time to avoid her. She laid her hand
on his shoulder and bent her mouth to his ear. One of
her peculiarities had been that her lips were always cold,
[176]

even when her passion burned most fiercely. The nearness
of those lips, once so maddeningly desirable and
sweet, made Daymondâs flesh creep horribly. He
breathed with difficulty, and the great drops of agony
stood thickly on his foreheadânot with weak, superstitious
terror of the ghost; with unutterable loathing of
the woman.

âListen!â she said. âThey are wise in the place I
came from; they know things that are not known here....
You have heard it said that once in the life of
every human being living upon earth comes a time when
the utterance of a wish will be followed by its fulfilment.
The poor might be made rich, the sick well, the sad
merry, the loveless belovedâin one momentâif they
could only know when that moment comes! But not once
in a million million lifetimes do they hit upon it; and so
they live penniless and in pain, and sorrowful and lonely,
all their lives. I let my chance go by, like many others,
long before I died; but yours is yet to come.â Her voice
thrilled with a note of wild triumph; the clasp of her
arm tightened on his neck. âOh, love!â she cried; âthe
wonderful moment is close at hand! It is midnight nowââshe
pointed to the great north window, through which
the frosty silver face of the moon was staring in relief
against a framed-in square of velvet blackness, studded
with twinkling star-pointsââbut with the first signs of
the dawn that you and I have greeted together, heart of
my heart!âhow many times in the days that may come
again!âwith the graying of the East and the paling of
the stars comes the Opportunity for you. Now,
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND
?â

He understood and quailed before her. But she was
blindly confident in his truth, stupidly reliant on his
constancy.

[177]
âWhen it comes, beloved, you shall take me in your
armsâbreathe your wish upon these lips of mine, in a
kiss. Say, while Godâs ear is open, âFather, give her
back to me, living and loving, as of old!â and I shall be
givenâI shall be given!â

She threw both arms about him and leaned to him, and
sobbed and laughed with the rapture of her revelation
and the anticipation of the joy that was to come.

âRemember, you must not hesitate, or the golden
chance will pass beyond recall, and I shall go back
whence I came, never more to returnânever more to
clasp you, dearest one, until you die too, and come to me
(are you cold, that you shudder so?)âand be with me
for always. Listen, listen!â

As she lifted her hand the greatest of all the great
clock voices of London spoke out the midnight hour. As
other voices answered from far and near Daymond shuddered,
and put his dead love from him, and rose up
trembling and ghastly pale.

They moved together to the window, and stood looking
out. The weather was about to change; the snow
was melting, the thaw drip plashed heavily from roof
gutters and balconies, cornices and window ledges. As
she laid her hand once more upon his shoulder the stars
began to fade out one by one, and in a little while from
then the eastward horizon quivered with the first faint
throes of dawn.

âWish!â she cried. âNow! now! before it is too late!â
She moved as if to throw herself again upon his breast;
but he thrust her from him with resolute hands that
trembled no more.

âI wish,â he said very distinctly, âto be Sir Robert
Daymond, Baronet, and President of the ââ before the
year is out!â

[178]
She fell away from him, and waned, and became unsubstantial
and shadowy like the ghost she was, and unlike
the thing of flesh and blood she had seemed before.
Nothing remained to her of lifelikeness but the scorn
and anger, the anguish and reproach of her great eyes.

âOnly the dead are faithful to Loveâbecause they are
dead,â she said. âThe living live onâand forget! They
may remember sometimes to regret usâbeat their
breasts and call upon our namesâbut they shudder if we
answer back across the distance; and if we should offer
to come back, âReturn!â they say! âgo and lie down in
the comfortable graves we have made you; there is no
room for you in your old places any more!â They told
me I should be sorry for coming; but I would not listen,
I had such confidence. I am wiser now! Good-bye!â

A long sigh fluttered by him in the semi-obscurity, like
a bird with a broken wing. There was a rattling of curtain
rings, the dull sough of falling tapestry, and the
opening and closing of a door. She was gone! And
Daymond, waking from strangely dreamful slumbers to
the cheerlessness of dying embers and burned-out candle,
rang the bell for his servant, and ordered lights. A few
minutes later saw him, perfectly dressed, stepping into
his cab.

âChesterfield Gardens, Mayfair,â he said, giving the
direction to his valet for transference to the groom.

âBeg pardon, sir, but Lady Mary Fraberâs servant is
still waiting!â The man pointed back to the house.

âAh!â said Daymond, who had had a passing glimpse
of alien cord gaiters reposing before his hall-fire. âTell
him I have taken the answer to his mistress myself.â

And as he spoke he scattered a handful of torn-up
squares of paperâthe fragments of a letterâin largesse
to the night and the gusty weather.

[179]

AN ORDEAL BY FIRE

MR. LANTER was bookkeeping clerk in a New
York dry-goods store. For his services he was
remunerated at the rate of fifteen dollars per week. His
bedroom at the boarding house with daily breakfast and
three meals on the Sunday, cost him ten dollars; the remaining
five supplied all other necessitiesâfed him at
cheap restaurants, dressed him from cheap clothing
stores, and allowed him to send a cash bill now and then
to his mother, who lived in a New Hampshire village on
tea, bread and sauce, wore her hair in looped bell-ropes
on either side of her forehead and a rosette behind, and
thought her son the most splendid man in the world. But
despite heroic efforts, Mr. Lanter had not succeeded in
putting by anything against a rainy day. As to marriage,
it was not to be dreamt of, which is probably the
reason why Mr. Lanter dreamed of it so frequently. But
the feminine form that figured in those dreams was not
that of a typist, or a sales-lady, or even a chorus-girl or
variety artist. Mr. Lanter was a young man with a turn
for reading, who regularly spent his Sundays at the
Cooper Institute, and he did not feel that he could undertake
to do his duty as a husband by anything short of a
heroine of romantic classical fiction. He had had imaginary
love passages with several of these, both ancient
and modern.
The FaÃ«ry Queen
had given him Britomart,
and the
Volsunga Saga
had supplied him with Brunhild.
Hypatiaâs erudition made her a little alarming, but the
affair was pleasant while it lasted; and Iseult was too
[180]

dark for Mr. Lanterâs taste, but he changed the color of
her locks as expeditiously as a French hairdresser, and
roamed the forest ways with her more appreciatively
than Prosper. Theaters Mr. Lanter did not frequent,
because Mrs. Lanter regarded such places as pitfalls dug
by the devil for the capture of unwary young America,
and he had promised his mother he would not visit them.
Indeed, had he been inclined to go back on his word, he
could not have afforded to do so. But neither concert-halls,
museums, nor circuses figured on Mrs. Lanterâs
black list, because she had forgotten to specify them;
and one half-holiday Mr. Lanter found himself entering
Kneemanâs Star MusÃ©e with an order.

The Kneeman MusÃ©e is a big, opulent building, with a
central dome of colored glass, a gorgeous faÃ§ade ornamented
with groups of sculptured figures and a gilded
vestibule where are displayed an array of life-sized
photographs and gigantic colored posters illustrating the
wonders to be seen within; promising upon this occasion,
among other exquisite novelties, the unique whistling
entertainment of Madame Smithers, the Kentucky
Mocking Bird; the Celebrated Centaur Family, in
their feats of Equitation; the Balancing Bonellis,
in their electrifying plank-and-ladder interlude; Madame
la Comtesse PÃ¼spÃ¶k Ladany, the Beautiful Hungarian
(heroine of one of the most sensational European
elopements) in her Elegant Effects of Equestrianism
upon the highly-trained Arab Maimoun, assisted by
Rurik the Gitano, who had the honor, upon the sensational
occasion above alluded to, of eloping with Madame
la Comtesse. Then came the Mermaids in a Tank
Act, and three-inch notes of exclamation clamorously
invited attention to the American Girl Giantess,
Mademoiselle Minota, nineteen years of age, nine feet
[181]

in height, weighing four hundred and twenty-six pounds,
able to lift a weight of one hundred and forty pounds
with one hand.... The remainder of the bill was filled
with dwarfs, performing lions, snake-charmers, and ventriloquists.

Mr. Lanter presented nothing remarkable to the ordinary
observation. He was fair, undersized, and short-sighted,
and the necktie he had chosen was of a vivid
salmon-pink, trying to his complexion, which had been
injured by overwork and close confinement in a glass
counting-hutch lighted by electricity, and heated by
steam. He followed his companion, who was a smart,
bustling young salesman with a lady-killing reputation,
and sporting proclivities; and as he went he smiled a
little vaguely, and his mouth was not quite shut, a negligence
which deprives the expression of intellectuality.
They had fauteuil seats so close to the Ring that their
knees rubbed against the low velvet-cushioned barrier
that enclosed the sand-strewn space, which seemed to
Mr. Lanter to be a brown central-patch, in a gorgeous,
multi-colored dream. The dome above, all glass and
gilding, the pretty women in the boxes, the perambulating
vendors of candy and ices, the orchestra tuning up
in a gilded balcony on the left of the stage, the whiffs
of menagerie, gas, and stabling which escaped from the
coulisses, the people who pushed past into their places,
Madame Smithers trilling and piping in emulation of the
feathered songsters of American groves, the Centaur
Family upon their gaily-trapped steeds, the bursts of
applause, the shouts of laughter, were all made of dream-stuff....
But when heavy tableau-curtains rose upon
a scene representing a mediÃ¦val banqueting-hall, and revealed
the American Girl Giantess, throned upon a high
seat, arrayed in gilded chain-mail and flowing purple
[182]

draperies, a sword in her large white right hand, a crimson
cloak upon her shoulders and a dragon-crested helm
upon her large fair head, the start Mr. Lanter gave
would have awakened any ordinary sleeper. But the
dream closed in again, as Miss Minota rose, and, bowing
to the right, to the left, to the middle, descended the
baize-covered staircase which led from the stage to the
Ring.... Other spectators saw a young woman monstrously
overgrown, with tow-colored hairplaits as thick
as coir-cable, and blue eyes as round as silver dollars,
who was well-proportioned in her huge way, and who, if
looked at through the wrong end of an opera-glass, when
divested of her tawdry theatrical trappings, might have
appeared an honest, ordinary young person of
average good looks. But Mr. Lanter saw a golden roof-ridge
and a ring of magic fire roaring up, and the Brunhild
of his visions; and breathed hard, and felt a clammy
sensation about the palms of the hands, while his heart
drummed heavily against the lining of his ready-made
waistcoat. He must have been very pale or very purple
in the face, for his companion nudged him.

âGuess youâre feeling off color!... Like to get out
into the air?... If so, Iâll keep your seat,â he whispered;
but Mr. Lanter shook his head.

The band struck up a march, Miss Minota descended
into the arena, a voluble gentleman in evening dress,
who acted as showman, and, when necessary, as interpreter,
walking in the shadow of her elbow. She seemed,
indeed, an overwhelming example of feminine physical
development as she gravely performed her round, replying
in monosyllables to the remarks that were made to
her by members of the audience, complying with their
expressed desire to shake her enormous hand. Mr. Lanter
was hot and cold by turns as her monumental proportions
[183]

drew nearer; he meant to rise in his place and
boldly engage her in conversation; he got as far as
getting on his legs. It seemed that the large blue eyes
of the giantess dropped upon him inquiringly; he almost
fancied her about to pause. But his tongue refused to
utter the word which would have arrested her progress....
She swept past, and it was as though the mainsail
of a yacht had gone over on the starboard tack, emptying
a whole breeze out of an acre of canvas. Another
moment and she had ascended to the stage, her draperies
of crimson and purple trailing as she went; she had
lifted her weights, respectively guaranteed at one hundred
and one hundred and forty pounds avoirdupois; she
had made her three bows, and the tableau-curtains had
descended and closed. Thenceforward Mr. Lanter took
no interest in the entertainment. With fishy eyes he sat,
retrospective, unobservant; and his companion, the lively
Mr. Goter, found him mighty dull.

âOh, look here!... Say now! whatâs up with you?â
he protested, as they walked home together through the
crowded streets.

The clang of street-car gongs, the intermittent roar
and rattle of the elevated railway, mingled with the blare
of tin horns, and the clamor of voices. It was hot May
weather, and there was a smell upon the languid air that
seemed to combine in itself the flavor of rotten fruit, the
musky odor of African skins, the pungent acridity of
frying oil, and the rankness of coarse tobacco.

âUp with me? Why, Iâm all right,â said Mr. Lanter,
âand Iâve had a real good time, thanks to you, old man!â

âCome, have a drink?â said the pacified Goter, and
they turned in at the swing doors of a beer saloon.
âBully, wasnât she?â he broke out, after ordering two
[184]

iced bocks. âMy style all over! Guess Iâve a good
mind to take her on!â and he winked knowingly.

Mr. Lanter set down his tall glass of untasted MÃ¼nchener.
âLook here, who are you talking about?â He
was salmon-pink to the edge of his black Derby hat, and
his pale blue eyes had angry sparks in them.

âThat girl that did the jugglinâ business on the plank-and-ladder,â
responded Goter. âBlack eyes, black hair,
high color, and spankinâ action. Did you sâpose I meant
that walkinâ grain-elevator in the tin armor? No, sir!â

He had yet another fulminating witticism on hand, and
he discharged it. Before it had done crackling he saw
stars, for the placable Lanter had suddenly smitten him
upon the nose.

âGood thunder! what are you up to, anyway?â spluttered
the astonished Mr. Goter.

âHolâ off there! Go easy!â shouted the barkeeper.
Half a dozen men, their drinks in their hands, their hats
tilted back from interested faces, had gathered round,
and a colored boy was mopping the red-stained marble
table with a wet cloth.

âHeâhe insulted a lady!â gasped Mr. Lanter, âand I
struck him! If he does it againâIâll do it again!...
Mind that!â The tone and the look with which he delivered
the final warning convinced Mr. Goter that he
had better mind.

Thenceforward he ceased to regard Mr. Lanter as a
âWillieâ and Mr. Lanter ceased to regard himself as a
Christian young man. His own violence had shocked
him. There must be a good deal of cold reason, he reflected,
at the bottom of Mrs. Lanterâs inveterate prejudice
against public places of entertainment, and his conscience
pricked him. But she had made him promise
that he would not go to âtheaters,â and he salved his
[185]

conscience by reminding himself that he had kept his
word. But he went again and yet again to Kneemanâs
Star MusÃ©e. And upon the third occasion he mustered
up courage to speak to Miss Minota.

âHow do you do?â he blurted out. Then as an afterthought
he blurted out, âMademoiselle.â He had to tilt
his head quite back to look up into Miss Minotaâs large
fair moon-face. He wondered what she would say if
anybody told her that she was his ideal of womanhood?

âI guess I am very well, thank you,â responded the
giantess. She had a plaintive, mooing voice, and despite
the usage of a public career, she seemed little less bashful
than Mr. Lanter.

âDo you like NâYork?â Mr. Lanter inquired.

âWell,â Miss Minota returned, âI guess I do!â She
sighed as she continued: âBut one place is much the
same as another to youâwhen you donât see anythinâ
more of it than the inside of the hotel where you happen
to be located, and the inside of the hall where you chance
to be exhibitinâ.â

âWhy, now, thatâs a shame!â said Mr. Lanter, growing
red with sympathy. âDonât your friends take you around
some, when you feel youâd like to go?â

âI suppose theyâd be real pleased,â said Miss Minota,
after an instantâs consideration, âif I didnât attract so
much attention. But when youâre too big to go on the
cars, like other folk, or pass along the sidewalk without
blockinâ itâââ She shrugged her enormous shoulders
with a little air of fatigue, and the gentleman in evening
dress, who officiated as showman, gave her the signal to
move. âGood-afternoon!â she said graciously, and
passed on.

But Mr. Lanterâs brain was surging with sympathy.
âMy gracious!â he cried to himself, âis it possible that
[186]

that splendid creature isnât happy?â A vague look of
gentle melancholy was certainly floating on the surface
of those limpid china-blue eyes. He breathed through
his nose and clenched his fists, one of which already bore
a proof impression of Mr. Goterâs projecting front tooth.
And the very next half-holiday found him waiting at the
side-door through which professionals found entrance to
the back scenes of Kneemanâs. One or two sallow,
cropped men in furred overcoats passed in, one of them
in company with a black-eyed, vivacious, middle-aged
woman, who conversed with her fingers, her shoulders,
and every muscle of her faceâand in whom Mr. Lanter
recognized Goterâs houri. Then a vehicle like a hotel-omnibus,
only taller and shinier, drawn by a pair of stout
horses, pulled up by the curb; two men, moustached,
and dressed in a kind of buff uniform faced with red
(Mr. Lanter recognized it as the livery common to the
attendants of the MusÃ©e), got down from the box seat
and opened the omnibus door.... Mr. Lanterâs heart
thumped wildly as a colossal foot and ankle, appareled
in a pink silk stocking and rosetted black satin shoe,
cautiously descended to the ground, and the rest of Miss
Minota followed by gradual instalments until the giantess
stood upright on the pavement, her nine feet of
height handsomely accentuated by an umbrageous hat,
with a plume of nodding feathers which might have
served for the central ornament of a canopy of state.
She inclined this tremendous headgear in gracious recognition
of Mr. Lanter. Mr. Lanter took off his hat with
his best manner, and boldly stepped forward.

A large pink flush invaded the giantessâs immense
cheeks, previously of a pale or dough-colored complexion.
âWonât you walk in a minute?â she said, in a timid,
fluttering way. Then, not without difficulty, she went in
[187]

at the side-door, Mr. Lanter followed, the attendants
mounted to their seats, and the large shiny omnibus
drove away.

The sensation of moving and speaking in a dream bore
heavily upon Mr. Lanter as he followed the tall, stooping
figure of the giantess up a short flight of stairs and
through what seemed to be a labyrinth of winding
passages, each of which seemed more dark and dusky
than the preceding one, and conveyed a stronger olfactory
impression of gas, mice, and turpentine. But the
labyrinth ended in a vast echoing chaos of shaky canvas
scenes and machinery, which Miss Minota introduced
as the stage. The iron curtain that separated the stage
from the auditorium was down, and they stood together
in the midst of a heterogeneous jumble of properties
among which Mr. Lanter recognized the plank-and-ladder
of the equilibrists, the gilded props and rubber-covered
block-tackle used by the tight-rope dancer, the
belled and ribboned saddles employed by the Centaur
Family, and Miss Minotaâs mediÃ¦val throne, flanked by
the gilded weights employed in her exhibition of manual
strength.

âWonât youâââ Involuntarily he pointed to the
gaudy throne-seat.

âWell,â said the giantess, âI donât know but what I
will sit downâjust a minute.â Seated, her large round
face and china-blue, rather foolish eyes were above the
level of Mr. Lanterâs as he stood before her. Certainly,
but for the suet dumpling pallor of her fair complexion
and a prevailing flabbiness, the result of insufficient exercise,
Miss Minota would have been good-looking. âI
guess I ought to thank you for being so polite!â she said,
and her tone and accent were homely as those of the
New England village-folk among whom Mr. Lanter had
[188]

been raised. âI guess you thought I acted like I was
silly just now; but boys do scare me so.... If thereâs
one thing more than another I dasnât face, itâs a boy;
and you bet boys know it, and lay along for meâthe
nasty little things! So thereâs another reason why I canât
go round like other folksâeven if the management
wouldnât object to my givinâ the show away!â She
folded her immense hands upon her knees and looked
placidly at Mr. Lanter.

âBut why should the management object, MissâMademoiselle?â
asked Mr. Lanter, standing, very red
and stiff and embarrassed, at Miss Minotaâs knee, like a
somewhat dull little boy about to say a lesson.

âBecause once folks have seen me for nothinâ, theyâll
leave the pay-place alone,â said Miss Minota. âItâs
human naturâ, take it how you will. Anâ Iâm only
Mademoiselle on the posters. My first professional exhibitinâ
tour was in the State of Minnesota, anâ thatâs
how I got my professional name. My own name seemed
kind of one-horse for a posterâQuiltâMiss Hattie Quilt
of Smartsville, New Hampshire, I was when I lived to-home.â

âIâve been to Smartsville,â said Mr. Lanter eagerly, as
though it were a bond. âItâs only forty miles from
Saunderstown where I was raised. My mother, Mrs.
Lanter, she lives there now. And Quiltâs a name Iâve
heard.... There was old Deacon Quilt that had the
lawsuitâââ

âI guess he was my grandfather!â said Miss Minota
soberly.

Mr. Lanter tilted his head, trying to remember what
the lawsuit had been about.

âIt was a suit about an iron bedstead,â said Miss
Minota. âItâs âmost ten years ago. Grandfather bought
[189]

it for me, because Iâd crowded mother out of hers. We
slepâ together till I was âbout eleven years old. Well,
grandfather measured me himself for that bed, but it
didnât get delivered for a month on end, and Iâd growed
beyond my measure, and didnât fit it, or it didnât fit me.
Mother tried to convince the old man by showinâ him my
frocksâsheâd let âem down eight inches only four weeks
back, anâ they was hardly on speakinâ terms with my
boot-tops by thenâbut he said onây Jonahâs gourd
growed at that rate, anâ the dry-goods man must change
the bedstead or heâd go to law. Anâ the dry-goods man
said rather than have legal trouble heâd change the bed
for a bigger, ân he did; but the new one was six weeks in
gettinâ delivered, and it was the same story over againâit
didnât fit me, nohow! So grandfather went to law, anâ
the case was tried in the Smartsville court-house, anâ
grandfather would âa got damages if the dry-goods manâs
lawyer hadnât asked to have me produced in court. It
was my first public appearance, anâ I was dretful shy.
People used to laugh at me beinâ so shy, but youâve no
idee what a tryinâ thing it is beinâ bigger ân anybody
elseâwhen you first find it out!â The large form of
Miss Minota was convulsed by a shudder. âYouâd hide
yourself in a mousehole, if it was big enough to hold you.
Well, they called Miss Hattie Quilt, anâ I got up anâ
straightened out, for Iâd been settinâ cramped in a kind
of pew, anâ it seemed even to myself as if Iâd never end.
Anâ the judge looked at me through his glasses. My!
didnât he stare! Anâ he asked how old I was, anâ I said
âRisinâ twelveâ; anâ the judge allowed if I kepâ on risinâ
I might get somewheres in time; anâ that a man with a
granddaughter like that growinâ up about him ought to
provide india-rubber bedsteads anâ a sliding roof. Anâ all
the folks laughed anâ grandfather had to pay sixty dollars
[190]

damages anâ costs.â Miss Minotaâs gentle, monotonous,
mooing voice left off talking; she paused to draw
breath.

âAnd thenââ?â said Mr. Lanter, in whose brain
dim and faded hearsays connected with the Quilt law-case
were stirring.

âThen grandfather took a kind of down on me,â Miss
Minota explained, âthough heâd set a deal of store on me
before. Anâ mother used to beg me with tears in her eyes
not to grow at that rate; anâ I tried notâhard; but I kepâ
on. I stinted meals anâ wore an iron pound-weight on
my head under my hatâbut still I kepâ on. Anâ at last
grandfather opinioned to father and mother it was time
to let out the houseâor to let out me. So they hired me
to Dan Slaterâperhaps youâve heard of Slaterâs Traveling
Museum of Marvelsâanââââ

âI should have thought theyâd been ashamed!â burst
out Mr. Lanter, flushing to the temples. âTheir own
flesh and blood!â

âThatâs what other people kepâ saying to grandfather,
âyour own flesh and bloodâ!â returned Miss Minota.
âBut all grandfather ever said was that there was more
flesh and blood than heâd bargained for, and heâd thank
âem to âtend to their own affairs.â

âI donât think he was a nice kind of man,â said little
Mr. Lanter, thrilling with indignation to his toes and
finger-tips, âto send a young girl away from her home and
her motherâout into the worldâamong strangers who
might have treated her badly!â He looked up at his
ideal of womanhood with passionate chivalry.

âOh, but they didnât treat me badly!â said Miss
Minota. âDan Slater was real kind. Anâ when I outgrew
the caravan I traveled in at first, he telescoped two
togetherâanâ as one of âem had been made for the
[191]

giraffe, I got on pretty well. But Iâve never got used to
beinâ made a show of, anâ stared at, and asked questions
by people, whether theyâre ordinary folks or Kings anâ
Queens anâ Serene Highnessesâanâ I guess I never will.
Perhaps you wouldnât believe itâs lonsome to be bigger
ân anybody elseâbut it makes me feel so, times!â

âI wish I could prevent your feeling lonesome!â burst
out Mr. Lanter, before he was aware. âI wish I could
carry you right away from thisââhe waved his hand
comprehensivelyââand take care of you. I wouldnât let
a rough breath blow on you as I could help. Iâd stand
between you and the world, and shelter youâIâd spend
my life in doing itâand spend it gladly!â He forgot
himself in what he was saying, and therefore did not
blush, but his awkward, plain, and homely little figure in
its badly-fitting store clothes was a spectacle to smile at.
âOh! if you knew all Iâd thought and dreamed of since I
saw you first!â he said, with a quiver of passion in his
voice. âIt seems like a dream to be talking to you
here.... If it didnât how could I tell you straight out
as I am telling you now, what I havenât even had the
courage to writeâthat IâIâââ

Miss Minota modestly reared her Alpine height from
the mediÃ¦val throne as a trampling of feet sounded from
the dusty passage beyond. âI guess I have got to go and
dress,â she said modestly.

âOh, please wait one minute!â pleaded Mr. Lanter.
âYou must know it, if you never speak to me or look at
me again. I think you the grandest, most glorious
woman I ever saw! Iâm ready to die for you right now,
if the dying of a common store clerk would be any use!
But it wouldnât,â said Mr. Lanter, âand so I must go on
thinking of you, and worshipping you, and loving you to
[192]

the end of my daysâââ He broke down, blushing and
stammering.

âOh, my!â cried Miss Minota. In her surprise she
sat down again so unguardedly that the mediÃ¦val throne
creaked and tottered. âYou donât mean it? Honest,
you donât?â

âI mean it with all my soul!â asseverated Mr. Lanter.

Miss Minota blushed a dull red all over her immense
face, as she met the young manâs rather ugly, candid
gaze. Then her large china-blue eyes brimmed over; she
pulled from her pocket a cambric handkerchief as large
as the mainsail of a toy yacht, and began to cry like a
thunder-cloud.

âDonât!â begged Mr. Lanter. âPlease donât! If youâre
angry with me I donât know what I should do. I donât,
indeed!â He was dreadfully in earnest, and quite pale,
and large drops stood upon his forehead, for the air in the
MusÃ©e was insufferably hot and close. There was a smell
of charred wood and blistering paint, and the unsettled
dust of the place made the straggling rays of daylight
that bored their way into it seem blue and smoky. A
sudden clamor of voices broke out below, almost under
the stage it seemed, and then came the trampling of
feet, the crash of broken glass, and the smell of some
spilled chemical mingled with the grosser odors of the
place. The scent, the stir, the sounds, seemed vaguely
associated in Mr. Lanterâs mind with something dangerous
and sinister. But he was listening to Miss Minota.

âI ainât a mite angry,â said the giantess, giving her
overflowing eyes a final dab with the handkerchief, now
crumpled into a damp ball. âI should hate to have you
believe it! IâI think youâre real generous, anâ kind, anâ
noble. And I shall be grateful to you all my lifeââshe
mopped her eyes againââfor makinâ me feelâfor onceâlike
[193]

Iâd been an ordinary-sized girl; for IâIâll own I
have fretted considerable. But there, when things canât
be altered, anyhow, itâs no good frettinâ, is it? Anâ, of
course, there could never be nothinâ between usâI
couldnât ever play it so low down on a man thatâs as
generous and kind as you are, as to say there could be.
But Iâm just as obliged. And now Iâll say good-bye, and
if we donât never meet again youâre to remember I was
grateful. My land! I do believe the showâs afire!â

For the crackling, blistering heat that parched the
flooring underfoot, with the sudden volume of smoke that
rolled upward, betrayed the condition of things no less
than the thin tongues of flame that licked upward between
the boards. In the regions under the stage the
conflagration had broken out; they heard the shouts of
the stage-hands, the crash of glass fire-bombs breaking
one after another, and next moment a solitary man,
smoke-blackened and red-faced, burst upward from the
regions below, and, rushing to the fire-hose, coiled like
a brown snake against the bare masonry of the wall,
began to haul it down. As the man tugged and swore
at the hose, other voices shouted and other feet clattered,
and half a dozen other men, singed and blackened like
so many demons, emerged as the first had done, from
those conjectural lower depths.

âItâs no useâno use!â they shouted as they ran, and
the fireman dropped the hose and ran with them. They
did not have to cross the charring, blistering stage, for
they were on the right side for the passage-way. They
fought and struggled, shrieking, in the narrow exit,
blocked by their terrified bodies.

âCome! Didnât you hear?â shouted Mr. Lanter. He
caught Miss Minota by the skirt and tugged at it like a
faithful terrier. âRun!â he shouted again. But a choking
[194]

volume of smoke, a blast of fiercer heat fanned up
from below. The boards of the stage were now in flames.
And the flames were of beautiful, ravishingly-delicate
shades of blue and hyacinth and orange-red. And they
devoured where they licked with a deadly greed and a
purring, crackling kind of satisfaction.... âCome!â
Mr. Lanter shouted again. The giantess had sunk upon
her knees, he shook her violently by the shoulder, and she
lifted her large, terrified face and staring blue eyes, now
for the first time upon a level with his own.

âI dasnât!â she cried. âThe floor wouldnât bear meâI
should never git across! Save yourself while you have
time!â As she sobbed and shuddered, Mr. Lanter put
his arm round her, as though she had been quite an ordinary-sized
girl.

âPluck up!â he shouted, for the fire roared as triumphantly
as though Kneemanâs Star MusÃ©e were the
choicest morsel in the world. âIâll get you out of this or
burn with you, byâthunder!â and he kissed her. The
kiss seemed to revive Miss Minota, for she gasped, and
struggled to her feet, and looked with him upon a wall of
rejoicing flame that soared upward between them and
the passage-way. âThese doors behind usâwhere do
they lead?â Mr. Lanter shouted, and Miss Minota
shouted back, âTo the dressing-rooms!â

There was no way of escape before them; the iron curtain
walled them in. As the slim greedy tongues of fire
began to lick the boards on which they stood, they retreated
to the back of the stage. But the stifling smoke
and the greedy fire followed them, and the end of things
seemed not far off.... It seemed quite natural now
that they should be holding hands. They were blackened
both, and smoke-begrimed, parched and giddy with the
terrific heat, and the incandescent air fanned on their
[195]

smirched faces as though the wings of Azrael had stirred
it; but they were a comfort to each other. To be heard
by each other in that fiendish tumult of insentient things
was impossible; but they pressed close to one another
like children in the smoky dark, and held one anotherâs
hands.

âI donât know as Iâd choose to have things different,â
said a grip of Mr. Lanterâs; and the answering squeeze
of Miss Minotaâs large hand said, âThank you for helping
me to die so like an ordinary-sized girl!â But the
hand she pressed seemed to melt in hers and slip away,
and, groping downward in the dun-colored smother, the
giantess touched the senseless body of Mr. Lanter lying
at her feet. And then she gave a cry of love and grief
and anger mingled, as an ordinary-sized woman might
have doneâand lifted her lover from the blistering floor
as though he had been a baby. The smoke seemed less
dense a few feet beyond where she stood, and, moving
forward with Mr. Lanter held upon one arm, the other
outstretched gropingly, Miss Minota bruised her knuckles
against a wooden door. It was the high, narrow door of
solid, iron-clamped timber (usually situated at the back
of the scene-dock), by which scenery and the more bulky
properties were hoisted up to or removed from the stage
of Kneemanâs MusÃ©e. In the joy of the discovery Miss
Minota cried out. Then she laid down Mr. Lanter very
gently on the floor, and fumbled for the door-bolts. But
the door opened by a winch and lever, and Miss Minota
fumbled in vain. A chill despair seized her. He lay so
helpless and inert at her feet that he might have been
dead! âO Lord!â Miss Minota prayed, âwhereâs the
use in You havinâ made me so much bigger than other
folk if I canât save him? Help me to do it, and Iâll never
go back on You by grumblinâ at my size any more!â

[196]
A dizziness overcame her, she reeled and staggered against
the side wall of the scene-dock, bruising her knee
against something that fell with a dull, reverberating
crash. It was a solid bar of iron used by a professional
athlete in a weight-lifting exhibition, and it might have
weighed a hundred and sixty pounds. The crash of its
fall brought Miss Minota to herself. She stooped, and
found and lifted it, and exultant, for the first time, in the
stature and the strength that marked her out and set her
apart from her ordinary-sized sisters, the giantess attacked
the door. One battering blow from the weapon
wielded by those tremendous arms, and the hinges started
and the stout planks split; a second, and a plank crashed
splintering outward; a third, and a shout went up from
the crowd assembled in the street below, as, amid volumes
of escaping smoke, the begrimed and fire-scorched
figure of Miss Minota appeared, carrying the insensible
body of Mr. Lanter in her arms.

âWell,â said Madame Lanter, the Colossal American
Marvel, some months later, to an interviewer specially
despatched from the office of the
Boston Magpie
, âI
guess you know what happened after that!â She blushed
a little, being yet a bride, and coyly turned her wedding
ring, a golden circlet of the dimensions of a babyâs bracelet,
upon her colossal finger. âWe brought him to, and
then
he
brought it off. Flesh anâ blood is flesh anâ blood,
anâ we all have our weak pâints!âand if I did lay out
never to marry a man as I couldnât look up toâI guess
it would take half a dozen of my size, standing on each
otherâs heads, to equal the loftiness of Mr. Lanterâs
mind!â

The young man thus eulogized presented to the reporterâs
view a spare and rather undersized personality,
[197]

plain of feature, and awkward of manner, drawbacks
afterward transmuted by the magic touch of the stylographic
pen into â
slightness, unpretending elegance, and
unaffected simplicity. The beaming affection discernible
in the glance he turned upon his stately bride justified
the eulogistic terms in which that lady spoke of her husband.
Their brief but thrillingly romantic courtship,
with its strikingly sensational âdÃ©nouement,â created a
âfuroreâ when detailed by the New York press. The disinterested
nature of the attachment of Mr. Lanter (who
is a member of one of our oldest New England families)
to the superb specimen of American womanhood who
bears his aristocratic name may be gathered from the
fact that the marriage ceremony was some weeks old
before Mr. Lanter discovered that Mrs. Lanter had
amassed, during the period of time spent by her in exhibiting
her personal developments in the principal cities
of Europe and the States, a fortune of ninety-five thousand
dollars.
â

And in this final statement the stylographic pen distilled
pure truth.

[198]

HOW THE MISTRESS CAME HOME

THE avenue of lofty elms was veiled in a white fog;
upon the low-lying parklands, cropped meadows,
and sere stubble-fields, the same woolly vapor lay
dankly. But the square windows of the fine old Tudor
manor-house flashed with ruddy light, and the hospitable
hearth-fires of the hall diffused glow and radiance
through open doors. Sir Vivian and Lady Wroth were
coming home after a honeymoon of eight monthsâ duration
spent in scampering over the face of the habitable
globe; and the village was in a state of loyal ferment
over the advent of the lord and lady of the manor. Already
the local band, heavily primed with home-brewed,
was posted at the station in readiness to burst into the
strains of âSee the Conquering Heroâ upon the arrival
of the London express. Eight sturdy laborers, in clean
smock-frocks, waited, rope in hand, for the opportunity
of harnessing themselves to the bridal brougham, while
Venetian masts, upbearing strings of flags and fairy
lanterns, testified to the strength and temperature of
popular goodwill.

âA sweet pretty creature, âm, I hear!â said Mrs. Ansdey,
the white-haired, handsome, black-silk-clad housekeeper
to the Rectorâs wife, who had driven up to the
house to ask for a cup of tea, and leave a parcel addressed
to the new mistress of the manor, containing
three dozen very raspy cambric handkerchiefs, hemmed
and initialed by the Girlsâ Sewing Class at the National
Schools.

[199]
âQuite a picture, Sir Vivianâs valet said!â added the
butler, who was comparatively young, not being over
sixty, and therefore looked down upon by Mrs. Ansdey
from her vantage of fifteen summers.

âBeauty is grass!â said the Rectorâs wife, who was not
overburdened with the commodity. She was a long, thin,
high-nosed woman, with color distributed over her countenance
in little islands. She drank her tea, and toasted
her large, useful feet at the glowing wood-fire, and
praised the Sally Lunns.

Her reverend partner was down at the village reading-rooms,
rehearsing the shrill-voiced school children in the
âGreet Ye To-night, Thrice Happy Pair,â chorus from

Lohengrin
. She knew the quality of the cocoa to be
obtained there, and longed to share with him the hospitable
burden of Mrs. Ansdeyâs silver tray. But as this
amicable division of spoil was manifestly impossible, the
Rectorâs wife consoled herself by making a clean sweep.
And so she ate and drank and chatted to the not displeased
Mrs. Ansdey with unflagging vigor, while the
famous Reynolds portraits of departed ladies of the
manor smiled and simpered from the shining paneled
walls, and the gray-muzzled bloodhounds, last of a
famous race and favorite of the last Baronet, snored
upon the leopard-skin hearthrug.

âYou have had many visitors this season?â queried
the Rectorâs wife, with a calculating glance at the donation
box, the contents of which went to the Cottage Hospital
twice in the year.

âTroops of them,â returned the housekeeper, nodding
her lace lappets. âAnd, as usual, half of âem with American
twangs. Even if they didnât talk through their
noses, I should guess âem from the States, shouldnât you,
Mr. Cradell?â

[200]
âWithout doubt, maâam,â rejoined the butler. âThereâs
a feverish anxiety to get the greatest amount of information
in the shortest possible time, and an equally ardent
determination to finger what isnât meant to be fingered,
price what canât be priced, and buy what isnât for sale,
which, to my mind, is a trademark distinguishing the
bearer, male or female, as hailing from the other side of
the Atlantic.â

âEven if he didnât call me âmarmââif heâs a man and
middle-aged, and put American dollars in the box instead
of English half-crowns if he happens to be a lady,â continued
Mrs. Ansdey. âBut what I will say is, if it was
with my latest breath, that the young ladies are most
elegant and have a real appreciation for old and what
you might call romantic things,â she added somewhat
hastily; and the Rectorâs wife said, as she added sugar to
her fourth cup:

âThe new Lady Wroth is an American, I have always
understood.â

âBorn in Washington, but edicated in Paris,â said Mr.
Cradell, putting a fresh log of apple-wood upon the glowing
fire at the lower end of the hall.

âShe comes of a fine old family, we have always understood,â
said the housekeeper, smoothing her lace apron
with her plump white hands. âRutherfoord her maiden
name was, and with her beauty and her jewelsâfor her
late papa was a Senator, besides being what Iâve heard
called a Railway Kingâshe created a sensation when
she was presented by the Duchess of Balgowrie last May
but one.â

âAs to her style of good looks,â said Mr. Cradell, dusting
lichen from his coat, âSir Vivian was always partial
to dark beauty. âWhat is she like?â says he to me when
I took the liberty of asking, as an old servant may. âA
[201]

black pearl, Cradell, and I hope to wear my jewel in my
bonnet as my ancestor Sir Guy wore Queen Elizabethâs
rubyâuntil the day I die!â Heâd a light in his eyes when
he said it, and what with love and happiness and all, he
looked more like a boy of twenty-three than a man of
forty. And I said to Mrs. Ansdey, âIf ever there was a
love-match,â I says, âSir Vivianâs is one.â And now the
carriage is waiting at the station to bring home both the
master and the mistressâbless them both!â

âShe wrote to me from Mentone,â went on Mrs. Ansdey,
âand I truly call it a pretty thought, and a gracious
one, of me that have been my masterâs nurse, and held
him on my knees when he picked out bounding âBâ and
curly âQâ with an ivory crotchet-hook.â She produced
from a morocco pocketbook, of solid and responsible appearance,
a letter written with violet ink on thin, foreign
paper, in delicate upright characters. ââ
My husband has
told me of all your faithful service and true devotion to
him and his
,â she read; â
and I hope before long to take
your kind hand in mine and thank you for him and for
myself!
â There now!â

âGracious and graceful too,â said old Cradell, who
had beaten noiseless time to the reading of the young
mistressâs letter with one wrinkled finger on a withered
palm. âGood breeding thereâand old bloodâin every
line!â

âAnd she looks forward to seeing her husbandâs dear
old English home,â went on the housekeeper, âand prays
God to give them many days in it togetherâand I trust
He will!â

âLet us hope so, for all concerned!â said the Rectorâs
wife, who resented theological references as trenching
upon her own particular province.

âThough in this family itâs been like a fate, or a doom,
[202]

or whatever you might please to term it,â said Mrs. Ansdey,
âthat the course of true love, the deeper it was and
the truer it was, was always to be brokenânot by change
or faithlessness of one that loved, but by the hand of
death. There was Sir Geoffrey and Lady Euphrasiaâhundreds
of years backâthat were drowned crossing the
ford on the ride home from their babyâs christening and
the baby lived to be Sir Launcelot, whose bride was carried
off by the Black Death before the roses on her wedding
garland were withered.... And then there were
Sir Alan and Sir Guy, who were both killed in battle
within a year of their weddings, and Sir Vivianâs great-grandfather,
old Sir Vivian, found his young wife dead
at her tapestry-frame when heâd crept up quiet to surprise
her with his unexpected return from the Embassy
to Rome. And Sir Vivianâs own dear mother lived but
a very few years after the dear child came to comfort
her for his fatherâs early loss. But time goes by, and the
curseâif it be a curse, as they say it is, brought upon
the founder of the family for some secret deed of evilâthe
curse may have passed over, or worn itself out.
Whatâs that?â

âWhatâs what, maâam?â asked the butler, as Mrs.
Ansdey rose in her rustling silks and made a sign for
silence.

âI fancied I heard a timid kind of tap on the hall
door,â said the housekeeper.

âA robin blew against it, perhaps,â said the butler.
âTheyâre stupid with the frost.â

âThere was a footstep too,â said Mrs. Ansdey, holding
up her hand and making her old-fashioned rings gleam
and twinkle in the firelight. âAt least, if there wasnât,
Mr. Cradell, I admit Iâve been deceived!â

âWeâll see, weâll see!â said Cradell, moving to the
[203]

great oaken door. âIt may be a tramp.â The handle
turned, the massive oak door moved inward. The fog
had thinned, it had grown clearer beyond doors. Within
the frame of the massive lintels appeared the glimmering
stone steps, a segment of the formal garden, with its
black Irish yews, pale marble urns, and cartwheel beds
of late flowers, enclosed within borders of box. Beyond
the trees reared a somber barrier, shutting out the sky,
and the chill wind of winter drove the dead leaves in
swirls and drifts across the melancholy picture. The
Rectorâs wife, thinking of her walk across the park to
the Rectory, sniffed and shivered, and the housekeeper
motioned to the butler to shut the door.

âFor I was mistaken, as you see, and thereâs not a
living soul about, unless itâs skulking in the shadow of
the trees,â she said. âAnother cup of tea, or a drop of
cherry-brandy, maâam, to keep the bitter air out as you
walk home? Though thereâs no reason you should walk
when thereâs the pony-chair.... Or perhaps you would
ratherâââ She started. âCall me nervous, or finical,
or what you like,â she said, peering anxiously through
her gold-rimmed spectacles in the direction of the door.
âBut, if I spoke with my dying breath, there was a tap,
and then a pause, and then another tap, as plain as plain
could be!â

âDear me!â The Rectorâs wife, alarm in her eyes and
crumbs on her chin, rose from her chair, dropping her
imitation sable boa. âI really believe I heard it too!...
Had you not betterââ?â

Cradell shook his old head and clucked softly with his
tongue. âThe ladies must always have their way!â he
said, shuffling on his neatly polished shoes toward the
hall-door. He opened it, and both the housekeeper and
[204]

the Rectorâs wife uttered a simultaneous exclamation of
surprise.

For a woman was standing in the moonlight outside.
She was of slight form, and wore a wide-brimmed feathered
hat, and the heavy shadow of the portico fell
blackly over her, so that she seemed no more than a
silhouette with a pale glimmering background. But a
delicate perfume stole upon the senses of those who, from
within, looked out at her, and when she moved there was
the unmistakable frou-frou of silken linings.

âMaâam!â the butler began.

âI came on before,â a sweet plaintive voice saidâa
voice that was viola-like in its rather thin, but sweet and
vibrating quality. âAnd you must be Cradell.â

â
Maâam?
â the old servant said again, while the Rectorâs
wife and the housekeeper listened with strained
anxiety.

âI am Lady Wroth,â came in the clear, vibrating tones.
âI came on before.... It does not matter why. There
was a slight accident between Greystoke Station and the
Elvand Tunnel. Do not be alarmed. Sir Vivian is safe,
quite safe,â she went on, as agitated exclamations broke
from the three listeners. âIndeed only one person was
killed, though two or three are injured, and heâmy husbandâis
helping the sufferers. He is always like that, so
ready to help, so full of sympathy....â

She was now standing in the firelight, whose ruddy
glow illumined the slight figure, and drew gleams of
crimson and emerald from the jewels at her throat and
shone in the depths of her great dark eyes. Her face was
of delicate, pearly paleness, her hair had the tints of
autumn leaves, and her draperies, too, were of the tints
of autumn. She drew off a glove, and her wedding ring,
with its diamond keeper, showed upon the slight and
[205]

pretty hand, as her traveling mantle of velvet trimmed
with costly sables fell to the floor.

âOh, your ladyship!â cried the housekeeper. âWhat
must you think of usâstanding here and staring? But
as goodness sees usâwhat with your sudden coming, and
the news about the accident, and allâweâve lost our
heads, me and Mr. Cradell!â

âSo very alarming!â said the Rectorâs wife. âI trust
Lady Wroth will excuse what may seem like an intrusionâââ

âThe intrusion is mine,â said the sweet viola-voice. âI
should have given warning of my coming, but it was not
to be. Oh! the dear house!â She looked with wondering,
shining eyes upon the paneled walls, the trophied arms,
the noble pictures, and the quaint antique furniture, and
between her lips, of the faintest rose, her delicate teeth
gleamed like pearls, as her breath came quick and eager.
âVivianâs old home ... Vivianâs home, and mine!â she
whispered to herself, and laid a hand upon her heart, as
though to check its beating.

âI will not intrude,â said the Rectorâs wife. âI will
hope for the pleasure of calling, with the Rector, at a
more fitting time. Good-night, Lady Wroth.â

The Rectorâs wife had held out her large hand in its
cheap glove, but the new mistress of the manor only
smiled upon her with vague wistful sweetness, and did
not touch the massive extremity. Whereupon its owner
set down Lady Wroth as âproud,â and made a mental
note to tell the Rector so, as her large feet carried her
out of the house and out of the story.

The two old servants exchanged a glance as the slight
figure of their mistress moved across the polished floor,
strewn with Oriental rugs and skins of wild beasts.

âWould my lady wish to go to her room, or to have
[206]

some refreshment in the dining-room?â the housekeeper
asked.

My lady declined.

âI have no need of anything. I only wish to rest a
little and see my husbandâs home before starting upon a
journey,â she explained.

âA journey? Dear, gracious me! And your ladyship
just fresh from travel, and shaken by an accident and
all!â cried Mrs. Ansdey, shaking her lace lappets.

âI am so used to travel,â said her ladyship, âthough
this is the longest journey I have ever takenâor ever
shall take!â She smiled upon the two old people, and
settled herself in the seat she had chosen, and resting her
elbow upon the arm of it, and her pretty chin in her delicate
palm, let her sweet shining eyes travel about the
place. âAll as he described it, yes!â she whispered to
herself. âThe mullioned windows with the coats of arms,
the carved and painted ceiling, the hooded Tudor fireplaces,
the arms and the pictures.... That is the great
Gainsborough portrait of Sir Alanâs young wife, the girl
who died of grief when they brought her husbandâs
bÃ¢ton

of Field Marshal to herâwon an hour before he was
killed in battle. There is the painting by Velasquez of
the Wroth who was made Bishop of Toledo. That must
be the Vandyck of Lady Marjorie with the deerhound
by her side, and there is the Watts picture of Vivianâs
young mother playing ball with her boy. Ah! what a
sweet, sweet child!â

The plaintive voice thrilled and trembled. Tears might
not have been far from the shadowy dark eyes, as Lady
Wroth rose and moved to the foot of the great staircase,
attended by the housekeeper.

âShall I show you your rooms, my lady?â Mrs. Ansdey
began. âThe fires are burning beautifully, and everything
[207]

is quite ready, and I feel sure your ladyship must
need rest afterâââ

âI will rest presently. But what I wish now, is to be
shown the house, if you are not too tired. Lady Audreyâs
turret, and the paneled chamber where Sir Roger fought
the duel with the Spanish cavalier, and the bedroom
where Queen Elizabeth slept, and the banqueting-hall
and the chapel where the Templarâs heart is buried under
the altar, and the gallery where Lady Euphrasia danced
with King Henry VIII., in masquing dress, and the
whispering corridor, and the painted roomâââ

âAnd the ghost-chamber, my lady? Oddly enough,
thatâs the first room that American ladies ask to see!...
But maybe your ladyship doesnât believe in ghosts,
or the fact of its being late and getting darkâââ

Lady Wroth laughed quietly and sweetly. âDo you
believe that the spirits of those who have passed on can
only appear in the dark, dear Mrs. Ansdey?â

The housekeeper rustled her stiff silken skirts as she
followed her new mistress up the broad staircase with
its carven balusters and mossy carpets.

âI donât believe in ghosts at all, my lady!â

âNot in ghosts as they are commonly imagined; those
shadowy white things that point and scare and hover,â
came floating back in the thin, sweet tones; âbut in the
spirits of the departedâit may be long-dead, or newly
called from earthâwho borrow for a little while the semblance
in which they lived and loved, and return for one
last look at a beloved home, or come for one dear glimpse
of what might, but for the Infinite Eternal Will, have
been a home. You believe in them, do you not? Or, if
you do not now, you will! Ah, yes! you will, dear Mrs.
Ansdey!â

Looking upward from the hall, the butler saw the
[208]

slight figure of Sir Vivianâs bride traverse the first landing
and pass out of view, followed by the portly figure of
the housekeeper; and in that moment came the grind of
wheels upon the avenue, a loud knock at the hall-door,
and a sharp peal at the bell. Two liveried servants, appearing
in haste, admitted the master of the house, and
at the first glimpse of Sir Vivianâs ghastly face and torn
and disordered garments, Cradell cried out in alarm.

âSir Vivianâsir! Itâs worse than what my lady said!...
Youâve been hurt! Shall I send for the doctor?â

âHe is with us!â came the hoarse reply, and Cradell,
peering out into the chill, gathering darkness, saw a
strange carriage drawn up before the door, whose lamps
threw a yellow reflection on the clouds of steam rising
from the flanks of a pair of jaded horses. They were
busy about the door; something was being lifted out?

What?
asked the old servantâs shaking lips dumbly.

âDrove in from Greystoke ... hospital carriage....
Send the men to help.... Get me some brandy,â came
from Sir Vivian in hoarse shaking tones. âI canât ...
my arm ... dislocated, thatâs all. I wish to Heavenâââ
His face expressed the nature of the wish, and
the old butler cried with spirit, as he brought the brandy
from the dining-room. âYou should be thankful, sir, that
youâve been spared to her!â

âSpared toâher?â

The decanter clinked against the glass. Sir Vivian set
it down upon the tray, and turned a white, seamed face
and haggard eyes upon Cradell.

âSpared to my lady, sir, God bless her!â the old servant
said. âYour hand shakes sadly; let me pour the
brandy out.â

Sir Vivian laughed, or made a grimace of laughter,
showing his teeth and stretching his pale lips.

[209]
âLord, sir! donât look like that!â Cradell begged.
âThink if her ladyship were to see you! Sheâââ

âIf her ladyship were to see me!â repeated Sir Vivian.
He drank off a glass of brandy and laughed again. âCradellâare
you mad, or am I?â

âNeither of us, sir, I hope!â said Cradell. Then a light
broke upon him, and he cried, âGood gracious, Sir Vivian,
is it possible that you donât know ... my lady is here?â

âI know it.â An awful agony was expressed in Sir
Vivianâs face. âI know it too well!â Great drops stood
upon his forehead; he turned aside, clenching his hand,
and fighting for self-command.

âShe came half an hour ago,â began the butler. âMe
and Mrs. Ansdey were quite took aback. Mrs. Ansdey is
upstairs with her ladyship now....â

âManâman!â cried Sir Vivian, âdo you know what
you are saying?â

He turned his streaming face upon the frightened butler
and gripped him by the arm, fiercely.

âLady Wrothâmy wife, she is dead! There was an accidentâshe
was killed instantaneously, with little pain,
thank God! They said so at the Greystoke Hospital....
She is outsideâthere!â He pointed a shaking hand
toward the partly open hall-door, through which a pale
line of moonlight came stealing as the careful, measured
tread of men carrying a precious burden sounded on the
stone. âYet you say to meâshe arrived half an hour
ago! You are ravingâor I am delirious!â

For answer the butler pointed to the velvet mantle
trimmed with costly sables that lay upon the floor.

âItâs heavenâs truth, Sir Vivian! And there lies the
proof! ... and here is Mrs. Ansdey to confirm it.â

Both men looked up as the portly figure in its rustling
black silken robes hurried down the great staircase.

[210]
âSir Vivian! Oh, welcome home, Sir Vivian, a thousand
times!â The housekeeperâs face was very pale, her
hands worked nervously, crumpling her fine lace apron.
âBut something dreadful has happened! itâs written in
your face!â she cried, âand God forgive a sinful woman,
but I am beginning to believe that I have spoken with a
spirit!â

âCradell tells me thatâââ Sir Vivian made an upward
gesture.

âItâs true,â cried Mrs. Ansdey. âHer ladyshipâif
âtwas her ladyshipâexplained that you were delayed.
Someone was killed in the railway accidentâââ

âSomeone
was
killed!â

âAnd you were coming on after you had seen to the
wounded.... Sheâshe would not eat, or drink, or rest;
she wishedâall she wished was to see the house, and I
obeyed, and we went through room after room untilâthere
was a ring at the hall-door bell, and a knocking,
and I turned to speak to my lady as we stood together in
the painted chamberâand she was gone! Oh, Sir Vivian,
what does it all mean?â cried Mrs. Ansdey.

âIt meansâthat!â

As the hall-door opened to admit the bearers with their
precious burden, and as the men laid that cold, lovely,
smiling image of Death reverently on the settle, the
bloodhound wakened from his slumber and rising, uttered
a long plaintive howl.

âWelcome home, my wife!â said Sir Vivian. âNow
please to leave us here together!â

So the servants and the bearers withdrew.

âIt was the same face!â Mrs. Ansdey whispered, as
her faithful old comrade led her away. âWhy did she
come?â

[211]
Cradell said: âBecause sheâd made up her mind toâand
she was a woman! Thereâs two answers in one!â

He stooped mechanically to pick up the sable-trimmed
mantle that had lain upon the floor. No hand had
touched it, but it was no longer there.

[212]

THE MOTOR-BURGLAR

A Development of the Age of Petrol

âA QUITE remarkable case of coincidence, dear fellarsâa
parallel without precedent,â said Hambridge
Ost to a select circle of listeners in the smoking-room
of the Younger Sonsâ Club, âis that the giant plate-burglary
successfully accomplished at Lord Whysdaleâs
shooting-box in Deershire on Tuesday last by a party of
three polite persons traveling in a large, roomy and handsomely-appointed
pale blue âFlygoerâ automobile, was
echoed, so to put itâon Friday by a colossal robbery at
the seat of my cousin, Lord Pomphrey; the defrauding
persons being also, in that case, a trio of civil-spoken
and well-dressed strangers, occupying a light green
âRunhardâ of twenty-eight horse-power with a limousine
body and singularly brilliant nickel fittings. The
most

remarkable point on one side, and one which has given
cause for the noisy derision of the
profanum vulgus
âdo
you foller me?âbeing that Lord PomphreyâI regret
to addâassisted and abetted by the humble individual
now speaking, actually assisted the thieves to get clear
off with his property, includinâ an Elizabethan beaker
with a cover, out of which the Virgin Monarch graciously
quaffed a nightcap of the cordial called âlambswoolâ when
staying at The Towers during a Royal progress in the
year 1566, and a silver tea-kettle and punch-bowl presented
by the tenants on the late Earlâs coming-of-age,
with a cargo of other valuables, out of which I had the
[213]

melancholy privilege of rescuing one Queen Anne Apostle
spoon.

âMy cousin Wosbric, between attacks of his hereditary
gout, is an ardent golfer. Residing at his Club during the
absence of Lady Pomphrey and the family in the Tyrol,
he takes every feasible opportunity of cultivating his skill
and renewing his enthusiasm for the game, the intricacies
of which, dear fellars, I may own I have never been able
to master. To me, when a large, cheerful, whiskered
man, dressed in shaggy greenish clothes, with gaiters, announces,
rubbing his hands, which are invariably encased
in woolen mitts, that he has
taken his driver twice going
to the twelfth hole; did not altogether mishit either shot,
and yet was not up to the green, because the wind bore
down like a Vanguard omnibus
;âto me nothing wildly
incredible or curious has been said. The large man in the
shaggy clothes is talking a shibboleth I do not and never
could understand, dear fellars, if I bent my whole intelligenceâconsidered
by some decent judges not altogether
contemptibleâto the task, until the final collapse of the
present Social System. But, nevertheless, Lord Pomphrey
is partial to the company of this humble individual
upon his golfing days, and to me the Head of my
Houseâdâye foller me?âin mentioning a preference
issues a mandate. Enveloped in a complete golfing costume
of Jaeger material, surmounted by two fur-lined
overcoats, the pockets of the under one containing two
patent âkeep-hotâ bottles of warm and comforting liquidsâcoffee
and soupâwhich aid to maintain the temperature
of the outer man at normal, before being transferred
to the inner individualâI manage to defy the rigors of
the English climate and support the exhaustion consequent
upon indulgence in the national game of North
Britain. My walking-stick is convertible into a camp-stool;
[214]

the soles of my thick boots are protected by
goloshes, a peaked cap with flaps for the ears crowns my
panoply; and, place in the mouth of the individual thus
attired one of Dunhillâs âAsorbalâ cigarettes, each of
which is furnished with a patent hygienic mouthpiece-filter
which absorbs the deleterious oil of nicotine, and
catches the stray particles of tobaccoâdâye foller me,
dear fellars?âwhich otherwise find their way into the
system of the smokerâand the picture is complete.

âThe run by road from the Club doorsteps to Cluckham
Pomphrey, where the Fargey Common Golf-links
equal any that our country can boast, faithful copies of
the eighteen best holes in the world having been carefully
made under the supervision of Lord Pomphreyâthe run
can be made within four hours. We started. I had received
the Fiery Cross from my kinsman, so to put it, in
a laconic note, running: âGolf to-morrow if the weather
keeps up and the gout keeps down.âYours, Pomphrey.â
We started in a mild drizzle, at six-thirty. Our car, a
âRusher,â of twenty-six horse-power, with a detachable
top and glass driving-screen, behaved excellently. Driving
through Cluckham, our county townâit happened to
be market-day!âwe accidentally converted a lamb into
cutlets; but the immolated creature, as it chanced, being
the property of one of my cousinâs farmer-tenants, the
casualty passed over with fewer comments than generally
ensue. Bowing to several well-known yeomen and
county land-holders, my cousin and myself alighted at
the Pink Boar, kept by an old retainer of the family,
took a light but nourishing ante-luncheon or snack of a
couple of raw eggs beaten up with whisky, and proceeded
on our way to the Fargey Common Links.

âA mile from The Towers, whose picturesque battlements
could be descried, dear fellars, embosomed, as it
[215]

were, in surroundinâ trees, we encountered some motorists
upon the road in quite a regrettable plight. Their car, a
large, light green âRunhardâ of twenty-eight horse-power,
was drawn up by the roadside;âquite an arsenal of tools
glittered in the wintry rays of the sun, spread out upon
an india-rubber sheet, and what had occurred was plain
to the meanest automobiling capacity. A tire had exploded
after a long, stiff climb of the steep hill, a notable
feature in our county landscapeâthe descent of which
we were about to negotiate. And the spare tire, after
being attached, had proved to be leaky beyond repair.

âFellar-feeling, dear fellars!âwould have moved any
fellar of you to foller our example. We raised our hats,
the three strangers in the âRunhardâ car politely returning
the salutation; we offered aid, and met with grateful
acceptance. Larger than our own locomotiveâthe âRunhardâ
wheels were of exactly the same diameterâthe
âRunhardâ tires were âFridolines,â like our own. We
offered our spare tire, it fitted to a miracle. We were
overwhelmed with the grateful acknowledgments of its
three polite proprietors.

ââYou will at least permit me to pay for the tire!â
pleaded the gentleman who appeared to take the lead.
As Lord Pomphrey refused, with the courtly wave of the
hand that distinguishes this thirteenth wearer of the
coronet, he continued: âFor you do not knowâyou never
can know!âhow inestimable a service your lordship has
rendered us!â

âWosbric was known, then. He elevated his eyebrows
in polite surprise. Not being able to discern the features
of the strangers behind their cap-masks and goggles, he
could not recall ever having met them before. Then the
second polite stranger, who was even more polite than the
first, explained in a slight American accent the reason of
[216]

his companionâs recognition of Lord Pomphrey. âWe
have, like many other tourists,â he said, ârecently enjoyed
the privilege of going over your lordshipâs antique and
noble family pile. In the hall, the feudal stateliness of
which especially appealed to me as an American citizen,
hangs a portrait of your lordship taken, in company with
a gold-hilted sword and a red velvet curtain, as Lord-Lieutenant
of the County.â

âLord Pomphrey bowed. âAs Lord-Lieutenant of the
County,â I put in. âQuite so. The likeness is agreed to
be a striking one. And as you have viewed the other
treasures of The Towers, I presume you did not miss the
large oak cabinet of Jacobean silver plateâmagnificent
and unique as having belonged to Queen Anne of Denmarkâwhich
stands at the end of the smaller library
behind the large Chinese screen?â

âThe polite strangers looked at me and then at Lord
Pomphrey and then at each other. A cloud passed over
the bright intelligent eyes that shone through their
motor-goggles as they sorrowfully shook their heads.

ââWe missed that cabinet!â said the first polite
stranger, with a sigh.

ââI guess we did!â said the second.

ââJust like wot I calls our beastly, blooming luck!â
sighed the third stranger who was sitting in the car, and
who, though polite, was not in the least a refined sort of
person. As all three of them seemed unfeignedly depressed,
Lord Pomphrey, who is the soul of hospitality,
begged them to return to The Towers, accept refreshment,
and examine under his personal superintendence,
the magnificent contents of the oak cabinet in the second
library.

ââWe thank your lordship profoundly!â said the first
[217]

polite stranger, bowing, âbut we are unable to accept your
invitation!â He bowed again, and got into the car.

ââAnd we shall never cease to regret, I guess,â said the
second, âthat we have missed the most valuable item of
your lordshipâs collection of silver heirlooms. But we
have garnered many precious momentosââit struck me
at that moment that there were a great many waterproof-covered
bundles in the âRunhardâ car, and as he spoke he
patted one of these affectionatelyââof our visit to this
country which must serve to sweeten life for us when we
are far away. And with these we must endeavor to be
content!â

âHe too bowed, dear fellars, and got into the car. The
machinery began to splutter at a touch upon the lever.

ââLet âer rip, Cocky,â advised the third stranger; âwe
ainât got none too much of a start with this yere tire
a-busting. So long!â he said, and like an arrow from a
bow, so to put it, dear fellars, the large, light green âRunhardâ
leapt forward and was out of sight in an instant.
We proceeded in the âRusherâ toward our destination.

âPresently, dear fellars, we met two large, hot, county
constables on bicycles. They did not recognize us, so
great was their haste. Their large boots vigorously trod
the pedals, their bulky, blue-uniformed figures were
crouched over the handle-bars as they pounded up the
hill from Cluckham Pomphrey. We wondered whither
they might be going? We questioned what agricultural
breach of the peace, what local felony, had spurred them
to such an unusual display of energy. We found out.

âFor at the next bend of the road, dear fellars, we
encountered quite a little cavalcade of hot and red-faced,
or pale and panting persons. The steward from Pomphrey
Towers in his T-cart, the head-bailiff from Pomphrey
Towers on his cob, the coachman driving a light
[218]

gig with two armed grooms on the back seat, an excited
mob of stable-helpers and gardeners straggling along behind....
Even before they recognized us, those in the
van of the pursuers shouted to us, asking if we had
passed an automobile upon the roadâa large, light green
âRunhardâ containing three men?

âIn a few gasped sentences, dear fellars, the ghastly
truth stood revealed; the facts were laid bare to us.
Pomphrey Towers had been, to employ the expression of
the bailiff, âcracked and burgled,â only an hour previously,
of a quantity of silver articles and a mass of valuable
plate. Lord Pomphrey and myself had met the
burglars upon the road, had supplied them with the
means of continuing their flight, had entered into conversation
with them, and returned their polite farewells.

âWe joined the pursuit, all thoughts of golf submerged
in the bosom of Lord Pomphrey, beneath the boiling
lava-flood of rage and indignation. To be robbed is bad;
to be placed in the position of confederate to the robbers,
unknowing aider and abettor of their nefarious flight, is
maddening. The three polite individuals in the large,
light green motor-car have not, up to the present, been
traced. One small spoon of the Apostle-headed kind,
found by the roadside where they replaced their own deflated
tire, with that so generously bestowed upon them
by Lord Pomphrey, is the only clue so far.

âA distressinâ experience, dear fellars!âconfoundedly
so in the estimation of this humble individual. Thanks,
I
will
take another of those long Dutch cigars and a
Scotch, with Hebinarisââthe new mineral water, do you
foller me?âwith iridescent bubbles that snap at your
nose. My love to you, dear fellars, and a Happy New
Year!â

[219]

THE LOST ROOM

THEY were going to part at lastâto separate quietly,
but formallyâafter a married life of nearly three
years.

There was no Other Woman, even she was quite sure
of that; there wasnât even the shadow of another man.
He rather wished there were, with a good solid six-foot
personality to project it. He was so confoundedly tired
of conjugal life.

He had an old historic title, a large estate unencumbered
by the prodigalities of ancestors, unhampered by
his own. She had inherited from an American mother a
large fortune and some of the biggest jewels Tiffany had
ever set. Their tastes were similar, their constitutions
robust, their tempers strong and healthy, their temperaments
ardent and enthusiastic, their moral and mental
temperatures since the last decisive meeting between the
trustees of her property and his family lawyers had been
slowly descending to normal. Never, oh, never would
either of them put their heads again, they were determined,
into the noose of marriage! even if a
decree nisi

should ever make it possible. Because naturally, as time
went on, she would meet somebody she liked, he thought....
Because men were so constituted, reflected she, that
if a woman only told one of them often enough that he
was in love with her, he would begin to believe it.

They had used up all their capability for passion, devotion,
and so on, during their romantic wooing, their
[220]

short but divine engagement, and the incandescent eight
weeksâ honeymoon that had followed the wedding. They
wanted to forget the world then, and be alone together;
and they got what they wanted, one April, one May, in
that great old granite-built pepper-box turreted Scotch
mansion on the banks of the silver Tweed.

It was heavenly, or at the very least Paradisaical.
They wanted it to be quite an old-fashioned honeymoon,
so they did not go down by motor, but by the Euston
express. Ten hours of traveling, and then they got out
at a little gray station of a little Scots town with a dreadful
tweed-factory in it whose dye and grease terribly
defiled the silvery river reaches, and does so to this dayâand
drove through lovely woods of larch and birch and
hawthorn, just breaking into green leaf, to Maryhouse,
the cradle of the race from which she sprang, the unhappy
lovely Queenâwhose great wrought gates of
rusted iron, with the Stuart shield of arms in faded gold
and crimson and blue, would never be unlocked again
until a Stuart should reign once more upon the throne of
England.

The great avenue had been turned into park, and you
reached the house by the lesser way. It had a square
courtyard, closed by another pair of great wrought gates,
and bears with ragged staves were on the pillars, and
even held up the antique scraper at the low-browed door,
and the knocker was the tiniest bear of all. There were
no rooms to some of the four hundred casements that
winked out of the lichened walls. You pulled the bear-handle
of the house-bell, and it clanged up high out of
sight somewhere among the twisted chimneys and the
great slants of stone-tiled roof studded with pinky house-leek
and gay with yellow moss.

Then the low, square, iron-studded door had opened,
[221]

and two people had gone in, to commence, among the
tragic relics of vanished, forgotten existences, their own
new life together. Perhaps some sorrowful shadow of
failure and disillusion had fallen upon them from those
old gray walls. A week before they went there a piece
of paneling had fallen from the wall in the great hall,
revealing in a niche behind it a skull, and what else Time
had left of the man who had suffered such a tragic ending.

As I have said, the Deed of Separation had been
formally signed by both parties, their trustees and lawyers.
She was beautifully free. She sang a little song as
her motor-victoria ran her homeward to the house which
he had no right to enter now, and she ordered the touring
limousine to be at the door very early in the morning
before she ran upstairs.

She was as gay as possible. She told her maid, as she
hummed the âDream Waltz,â to have a cabin trunk and
a bag packed. Only these, because she would be back in
a week. She was only going to visit some old great,
quiet people in an old great, quiet house up North, who
had been very fond of society in their time, but now
never even dressed for dinner. She meant the fair murdered
Scotsâ Queen and the Kings who had dwelt at
Maryhouse, of course.

âFancy that, my lady!â said the maid, thanking her
own stars that she was not to accompany her mistress.
Many silken calves and much company above and below
stairs constituted the waiting-womanâs ideal of Life.

Well, the itinerary of the Great North roadâthat
would take too long. Behind the glass screen she sat,
swathed in her sables, while the taciturn, clean-shaven
chauffeur made England spin by. She chose her own
road, the collieries were left behind in their smoke, the
[222]

ruins of St. Oswaldâs Chapel of Ease were passed, standing
gray and battered on their battle-site. Serving-shields,
where under the enchanted hall sleep Arthur and
his Knights, she saw before she lost the vision. She
slept at Carlisle, and went on next morning to Peebles,
where Needpath elevates its single fang above the salmon
pool.

And so to Maryhouse, not even a telegram having been
sent ahead of her. She knew her dear friends, the owners
of the place, were still abroad. But there was always
Mistress Dumphie, the old, old lady-housekeeper, who
had been born and reared and wooed and married, too, at
Maryhouse. Mistress Dumphie would take her in for a
night, and if notâthere was an inn in the ugly little
weaving village. The great limousine rolled through the
gates of the smaller avenue and over the bridge of the
Arbalestiers Tower, and stopped before the great, rusty
crowned gates of the sunny courtyard.

The larks were singing. The Quhair brook ran under
the hazel-banks. Oh! what sweet quiet after the roar of
Paris and London and the dust of the roads.

The rusty chain was pulled, the great bell clanged on
the side of a pepper-box turret ever so high overhead.
Mistress Dumphie, in her mornâs merino and black net
cap, appeared behind the rusty grille.

âGuid preserve âs aâ! Itâs the young lordâs leddy!â she
said.

The âyoung lordâs leddyâ came in. She was to stay.
The chauffeur went back to the hotel.

âI feel as though I should find something here,â said
the âyoung lordâs leddy,â âsomething that I have lost
somehow. It is very odd!â

She wandered about the beautiful old house all the
rest of the day.

[223]
âHere is the great oak window-seat where we used to
sit together. Here is the little stone parlor where we
quarreled and made it up. Here is the vast tapestried
chamber, with the faded Stuart portraits on the walls,
that was my bedroom; and this smaller room, with the
acorn-shaped stone mullions and the ebony and tulip
wood furniture, was
his
!â

What fine days they had spent in those daisied avenues,
under those huge oaks. What wet ones under the
old painted, diapered ceilings. The wettest of all they
had spent in looking for the Lost Room.

The Lost Room was a chamber that everybody knew
of, but nobody ever discovered. Counting from outside,
you could be sure there was an extra window, but go
where you would about the hushed mysterious house, you
never opened a door that led into the Lost Room.

She supped in a little dining-parlor that those dead
Queens had used before her. She went to bed in the
tapestried room. She slept well and woke in the middle
of the night with a great bell clanging in her ears. She
could not sleep after that. Lights flickered before her
shut eyes in the darkness.

âI
did
hear a step on the staircase! I
did
hear the
shutting of a door!â she said to herself, and got out of
the great bed on the daÃ¯s and put warm slippers on her
white little naked feet, and threw on a dressing gown
lined with unborn Persian lambskinâsuch a cruel idea,
you know, but very fashionable. And she took her electric
torch, and unlocked the door noiselessly, and stepped
out boldly into the wide, dusky corridor.

She trod upon something soft, and repressed a scream.
She held the light downward and picked up a manâs dogskin
glove.

âAh, now I know that I am dreaming!â she said quite
[224]

cheerfully. She need not be afraid of mice or rats, because
she knew that she was all the time lying in bed in
the big tapestried room. As for ghosts, she wanted to see
one frightfullyâalways had.

The door of the room that had been his was just opposite.
Something made her go in, on her noiseless
dream-feet, carrying the dream-glove in her hand. The
dream went on quite as dreams usually do. She had gone
back to the sweet old half-forgotten honeymoon time.

âThis is the night on which we had tiffed, and I was the
first to make it up!â She smiled and went in. It was
just as she had expected. There he lay, fast asleep in the
big tapestry-hung bed.

She went up to the side of it, and pulled back the curtain
without waking him, and sat down, shading the
light from the dear, handsome, manly face, and devouring
it with famished eyes. This was what she had come
seeking; some glamour of the old time; some sweet remembrance
unspoiled by anything that had happened
since.

The jars, the disagreements, the quarrels had never
happened.... She was back in the old times, and he
was not yet regretting his lost freedom, but tightening
the bond a little closer every day by words and deeds of
love.

This was the Lost Room, this dream-chamber where
he lay. She was glad to have come down to Maryhouse
for this. Who would not take a journey to find your old
self and your old selfâs self at the end of it, and Love
lying sleeping in the shadow of dear memories, ready to
be wakened with a kiss?

She stooped and gave the kiss. He started and awakened.
He stared at her, and the light of the old joy
leaped into his eyes.

[225]
âAlice! Youâre only a dream, I know, but it is better
than the real Alice, who grew to hate me. Oh! put your
arms round me again! let me have your heart on mine
again; let both of us forget what a ruin we have made
of the life that we set out to make so sweet and fair!â

He caught her hands. The torch fell with a crash, and
went out. The dark was full of light, and warm, throbbing
memories, and they were one again. Just for a
little while, only in a dream....

But day came through the diamond casements, laughing,
and hand in hand with Hope. There were tears and
laughter in her train. Two real people. No dream
after all.

He had wanted to look at Maryhouse again, and had
traveled down in the express from Euston, hours after
she had started. It was he who had rung the bell in the
night.

Mistress Dumphie had let him in and given him
supper, and lighted the old room for him. He had
thought there was a curious twinkle in her eye.

The Deed of Separation, now waste-paper, may be had
on application, by any young, wealthy couple who are
desirous, upon a sensible arrangement, to part.

[226]

FATHER TO THE MAN

Being a Confidential Letter from the Right Hon. Viscount
Tynstone, at the Rev. O. Gotobedâs, Eton
College, to the Lady Mary Cliffe-Bradlay, ooo Wessex
Street, Park Lane, W.

Good Old Poll
,â

It is awfully nice of you to be so fritefully sick about
itâ
i. e.
, my Getting Swished this Half, but fellows
get Hardened to these things at School. Hemming major
says there is something in a rotten poetry-book about a
Divinity that shapes our Ends. I expect the beggar who
wrote it was trying to get round the Head for his own
Reesons. Your simpathy about the Ladiesâ Plate is cumforting,
but the Eton Eight must give other Crews a
chance sumtimse. So everyboddy says, and as far as
stile went our Fellowse boddies were better under controle,
and the whole Appearanse of the Rowing was up
to the best traddishunse of Eton. No. 7, Biggly-Wade,
presenting a beautiful example of rithm and elastissity;
and Henson No. 4, simply being a Tower of strength.
N. B., he is Captain of my Tutorâs and Has licked me
awfully several timse, so I am in a pusition to Judge.

While the Thames Cup was being slogged for I made
up my mind to Sacrifise myself for the good of my Fammaly,
and drop into Lunch with Mr. and Mrs. Le Moser,
those Millionaire Friends of Motherâs, who she said were
such Howling Cads, and so anxhus to know me. They
Had an A.1. Motor-Launch, sedar-built, with plated fittingse
and with salloons 4 and aft, and Green Awnings
[227]

second on the Bucks side 2 Private Lawns billow the
Kingston Rowing Club. There were Moundse of Flowers,
and though lots of other awfully smart launches filled
up the First Section of the Bank before the Houseboats
Began, where you, and Mother, and the Girls were on
Uncle Todmoreâs
Roulette
, the Le Moser craft collared
the bikker for sumshuous splender. Regger minor of my
house, who is quite an awfully Brilliant umorist, made
an eppigram about the general Swellness of boats and
launches billonging to people like the Le Moserâs. He
said: âOn the Berks side there are piles only, and no
Booms. On the Bucks side there are
both
Boomse and
Piles.â

Regger was so awfully Pleased with himself for saying
such a clever Remark that I Had to Kick him to Tone
Him down. He is Fritefully litterary and Artistic, because
his Father Has just Bought a Weakly Illustrated
Journal, and He is to Eddit it when He leaves Oxford;
and the Things he said about the akwatic Fairy Palaces
bineath the Pine treese and the Green-clad Hilly Vista,
kombining to make up a Picture uneek in its English
beauty, and without Paralel in the sivilised World were
like hearing bitts read out of some Rotten Newspaper the
day after the Rigatta.

I had Not Had much Brekker, bicause our Boysâ Maid
is quite awfully spoons on Henson No. 4 of the Eight,
and forgetse where she has Hidden the Knives and
Forkse to kepe Other Fellows from getting at Them. I
Found them in my Cricket Pads after I had Eaten eggs
and Sausages with my Fingers like one of those Prehistorick
Beggers with Stone Hatchets. So the Hospitallity
of the Le Mosers was ixtremely Welcome. Mrs.
Le Moser was Frightfully Civil. She Had Diamond
buttons on a White Reefer Jacket, and Rows and Rows
[228]

of pearls as big as Sparrowsâ eggse. A White Gangway,
railed with gilt chains on posts with gilt Knobs, led to a
Markay on Shore, which was Decorated as a Medievil
Banqueting Hall, and there was a Footman in the Le
Moser livery behind everybodyâs chair. The Dalmatian
Band and the Castillian Minstrels Played, and it was an
awfully ripping lunchon, with everything you could think
of to Eat and Drink and lots more bissides. There were
4,000 Pot plants on Board, and when it Got Dark the
Fairy Litse looked awfully fine.

Mr. Le Moser was a ripping good Host, though his
waistcoat and necktie were frightfully loud, and he wares
his Nails as long as the front ends of a Pair of Swedish
Skates. N. B., Perhaps it is to Rake in the Money with?
He told me that my Distinguished Fatherâs Name was
Down as One of the Directors of His New Company, and
that He Hoped to have Mine in a Few Years. He said
the Risponsibilities of Rank were fritefully tremendous,
and never seemed to Notice how I kept Slogging into the
Champagne. He told me to keep the Cigarretts biside
me, and offered me a Partagga in a glass case, price 8s.
6d., which I expect comes to a frightfully big price for a
box of 100. I acsepted the luxurious Weed, but Did Not
Smoak it. (N. B., I have got it now, and Regger, who
has been swotting Pericles this half for English Classics,
calls it âa glorious casket stored with ill.â I canât think
what makes him.)

After everybody was stodged we went on Board the
launch, and Miss Le MoserâMother is quite rite about
her being a pretty girl, though her Pater and Mater are
such awful form, and her Pater doesnât know how to stop
talking about the money he has Bagged on the Stock
Ixchange, and in other Places, the Diamond Mines in
South Africa particularly. A chap in the Guards who
[229]

was on the launch said it was a well-developed case of
I. D. B., but Forgot to tell me what the Letters ment.
He said, âJosie would carry the pileâ (Josie is Miss Le
Moser), and that if I was a sensible young beggar, and
not a rotten Ass, I would see where my own advantidge
lay even before I left School for Sandhurst. He went on
about an infusion of Radical blood being a good thing
to mingel with the ancient Tory blue, and rather Valuable
than otherwise to oneâs descendents, and said that
to win a young and distinctly decently-looking wife with
a hundred and eighty thousand jimmies in her wedding
nightcap would be getting the Grand Slam in mattrimony.
I checked him a bit and asked him if he had
Praktised what he jolly well preached, and he twisted his
mustash and said: âUnfortunately, no, young âun; as
like a Good many other fellows, I Came under the Married
Womenâs propperty Act before I was eighteen.â

Then he pointed out a weedy, long-legged Beggar with
the ghost of a red mustash and fritefully swagger
clothes, who was making himself tremendously nice to
Josie Le Moser, and said he was the Son of Mr. Joyd
Lorgeâs privite Secretary and an
enfant gÃ¢tÃ y
of the
Liberal Government, with a seat in the Lower House
being kept warm for him until he should come of age,
and a lot more, ending up by asking me if I was driving
an Automobile and saw a Dog trying to Bite through
one of my Tyres, what I should do to the dog? I said I
should Drive over it, of course, which seemed to pleese
him frightfully, for he tipped me a sov, and then winked
towards the Fellow who was showing his teeth at Miss
Le Moser and said, âThen, thereâs the Dog, donât you
know!â and went off to talk to a frightfully swell woman
who called him to come over to her. I should rather
like to be like that Guardsman when I go into the Army.
[230]

His name is Gerald, for I heard the lady call him by it;
he is Lord Dennismore, and he was so jolly Respectful
and attentive to the lady, who wore quite a lot of vales
and had heaps of golden hair, though she was quite old,
and a tremendously red and white Complection, and a
front figure that rinkled and bulged when she stooped
or sat down, that I thought she must be his Mother, until
Mrs. Le Moser told me she was the Duchess of Rinkhorn
and his great friend. What I said about the Duchess
being his mother seemed to amuse Mrs. Le Moser like
mad, for I Heard her tell quite a lot of people, and they
All yelled, as if I had been trying to be funny, which I
was Not.

She told me lots more About Lord Dennismore, which
made me feel beastly proud of his having talked to me,
and given me Advice. He was out with his battalion in
the South African War, and did splendid thingse at the
Front, and got speshally mentioned in Despatches, after
Jaegersfontein and for Rescewing twenty wounded Tommies
who had fallen in the Grass which the liddite from
the shells had set on fireâI think it was liddite. And
he got potted in the Shoulder, and was getting quite fit
again, and would have done a lot more fiting if the
Duchess hadnât come out in a Speshul Hospital ship and
carried him back âto England, Home and Duty,â as a
lady who was listening to Mrs. Le Moser put in. I think
it was jolly mean of the Duchess, donât you? As if a
chap could be properly grateful for being muffed like
that! I forgot to say that Lord Denismore, when a little
chap, was Fatherâs fag at school, and used to field for
him when stump cricket in the passage in wet weather
first came in. And he, Lord Denismore, was picked to
Play in the School Eleven when he was still only a Lower
Boy, and was Captain for a half before he left. And I
[231]

feel awfuly Glad I met him, but I wonder why he said
that about coming under the Married Womenâs Property
Act before he was eighteen? There is a Duke of Rinkhorn,
who goes about in a Bath Chair with a Nurse in a
white cap and apron to feed him and blow his nose when
it wants it, so Perhaps the Duchess is the married woman
he meant after all.

I must say Josie Le Moser seemed to like me talking
to her and explaining things more than she seemed to
when the weedy chap with the ghost of a red mustash
was trying to. After the phinal of the Diamonds, when
the Crowds began to thin, and later when the Twilite
came down and the Nats came out, and the Le Moserâs
launch and their markay were elluminated up with about
twice as many Fairy Lites as anybody else had, and the
Castillian Minstrils played splendidly on their mandalins,
I began to think her an awfully pretty girl. I donât
believe it was the crÃªme de Menth her Pater had made
me have with my coffy after Lunch and the Champagne,
or the Russian rum they sent round in little dekanters,
with the five oâclock tea, because the fellows say my
Head is frightfully strong. But I got her hand and
squeezed it a lot of times, and whenever the sucking
M. P. edged a word in, and he tried to keep in Josieâs
pocket the Most of the time, I wanted to fit him, and I
think He guessed it from my Manner. He let Out He
had been Edducated by Private Tutors at Home because
his constitushion was dellicate as a Boy, and I said âOh!â
and I think Josie began to feel him rather in the way
after that. His name is Wenham-Biggs, and I xpect his
Constitushion is giving him a lot more trouble by now.

The thing happened like this. I had only leeve till
7.30, but Mr. Le Moser asked me to stop and Dine, and I
thought I could work the squash at the Station, and being
[232]

three tranes late for an extra 2 hours so consentid with
thanx, as it is a Poor Heart that Never rejoices, as Regger
says. Josie and Me were up in the Bows where there
is just Room for 2, and Wenham-Biggs was sitting on the
Steersmanâs Box rubbing his chin against the Wheel, to
make his Beard grow I suppose, and Getting more Sickeningly
Sweet and Centimental in the things He was saying
to Josie every Minute. I call it Nerve to go on like that
with another fellow nearly as old as yourself listening to
every Word. At last he Said he was ready to Die for the
Woman he LovedâI like that, donât you?âWhenever
she asked the sacrafice, and I said it would be the Leest
he could Do, if she had an objection to a red mustash.
It must be being so much with Regger makes me bat off
these Things I xpect. Wenham-Biggs was perfeckly
wild, and Josie giggled so mutch that she Forgot she was
Close to the Edge and the Rubber mat slipped or something,
the Launch being polished like a Looking Glass,
and she went plump into the River, and it is pretty Deep
on the Bucks side, and there is a good deal of Streem.

I was Glad of all the Swimmers I had gone in for at
Cuckoo Weir. I was Beestly sorry about my Swagger
Flannelse and my new colors I had sported for the 1st
time; but of corse I had to go in after Josie and thogh
I donât suppose I showed much skill, People made an
awful Row, crowding to the Bullarks, and throwing life-boys
and cork fenders at us like ennything. Mr. Le
Moser kept offering rewards in lbs. and making it ginnies,
and Mrs. Le Moser had histerrics in Lord Dennismoreâs
arms, which shows she was not quite unconshus because
He was the best-bread and best-looking man of the
Launch-party.

What price your Little Brother when Me and Josie
were Hauled up into the Launch all over pslime and
[233]

Duckweed. Everybody Shook Hands with Me and said
things that Made me Tingal all Over, and all the Women
kept kissing Josie who they took away and put to Bed.
Mr. Le Moser lent me a Change of his Thingse. O
crumbs! if you Had seen me in them ispeshally the
Wastecoat and the etsetras with stripes down the Legs.
And he rote me a letter to Take back to my Tutor, and
left it ungummed. And the things He said about my
Pluck and Daring and his Eternal obbligation made me
feel quite Shy when I read them going back in the last
trane. There were two other Lower Boys in the carriage,
and besidse them, a Fellow of my house who is One of the
Swells of the Sixth Form, who was awfully annoyed at
being obbliged to travel with us.

The Butler was sitting up for us at my tutorâs, and
everyone Else in Bed, as it was past 12, when we Got
Back, but beyond a Slite Cold in my Head the Risults
of the Outing were Not Paneful, my Letter putting
Things in an awfully good light, which made the Other
Fellows rather envious thogh they were let off with midling
paenas.

I Forgot to say Mr. Le Moser tipped me Â£100, which
will come in very usefull. Also I am to try and get leave
to go and Spend the Day at their Place at Staines next
week, and they will send me Home in one of their motor-carse.
Xcuse Spelling and mistakes as my Cold is making
me Sneaze pretty Frequently, and with love to
Mother, and all at home.

Bilieve me,

Your loving Brother,

Toby
.

P.S.âYou Never saw a Fellow with plenty of conceat
and Nerve about Him look as small as Wenham-Biggs
when Lord Dennismore asked Him why He did not Dive
[234]

in after Josie too, and he Had to own up He Could not
swim a Stroak. What price private Tutors and being
Edducated at Home?

P.P.S.âI saw Josie before I came away, and Mrs. Le
Moser kissed me, which was horrid, and so did the
Duchess and Several Other Ladies, and then they told
Josie to and she did and gave me a little Diamond Duck
to wear on my watch chane. N.B.âI think I see myself
doing it and getting fitted by my fagmaster for side.

T.

P.P.S.S.âLord Dennismore neerly rung my hand off
when I said Good-bye, and said, âYouâve tumbled in for
a good thing, you lucky little beggar, and Iâm Â½ inclined
to billeve....â And then he left off without saying
What. But he tipped me 3 soverins more, and asked me
to come and lunch with Him when Next he is on Duty,
and you bet I said delighted thanks....

T.

P.P.P.S.S.S.âAs my Fagmaster seemed inclined to be
Nasty about my not getting Up in Time to Fill his Bath
and make his tost and cofy in the morning I gave Him
Mr. Le Moserâs 8s. 6d. Partagga in the glass case. First
he bitt the end of the case off and it neerly choaked Him,
and then He had a lot of trouble in getting it to Lite, and
before it was Â½ through he had a lot more trubble of a
different kind. (N.B.âAsk mother if it would Not be a
good Thing for me
i. e.
marrying Josie Le Moser when I
am of Age? I shall be fritefully poor and she will be
awfully Rich, so her Father and Mother would not matter
much. Also it would be Better than coming under the
Married Womenâs Propperty Act at 18, like poor Dennismore!)

THE FLY AND THE SPIDER

Being a Confidential Letter from the Right Hon. Viscount
Tynstone, on board the Yacht âSpindrift,â
Cowes Roads, to the Lady Mary Cliffe-Bradlay,
Silversands Park, Sussex.

Tuesday
,
August â
.

Good Old Poll
,â

I thought you were Rotting about Lord Dennismore
and the Duchess at the baginning of your Letter,
but your Locking him up in the Peech House was a Stunning
Lark. The Duchess must Have been in a Regular
Wax, and He must have been Fritefully Wild, only you
canât Hit a Girl, they are so Soft and Go down so Easily.

Uncle Todmore Has the Usual Yacht Party for the
Rigatta, and the old
Spindrift
looks A.1. painted white
with a new Copper Rail and a New Sett of Lifeboyse, etc.
I asked Uncle Todmore How Much it had Cost, and He
Heeved a Sigh, and said sufficient to the Day was the evil
Thereof, so I xpect it comes to a Lump, and He and Aunt
Honoria will Have to spend the Winter down at that
Beestly Place of His in Devonshire instead of Going to
the Riviara or Egipt this time.

I said He Had the Usual Party on Board; but there
are Two New Peopleâa Captain Clanarthur, late of the
Malta Artillery, a Man who Parts His Hair Down the
Back, and Wares a Gold Braselet on his Left Wrist, and
his Wife. Mrs. Clanarthur is a simply Fritefully pretty
[236]

woman, with Long Black ilashes that Curl at the endse,
and Eyes you Cant tell the right Colour of, never Being
the Same Twise Running. Aunt Honoria is a Great
Friend of Hers. And she Wares a Silver Belt with her
Ruff weather Serge Gown that was a saint Bernard Dogâs
Collarâso you may immagine How Small her waste is.
She says I am a Mear Boy, and Ought Not to Notice
Such Things; but I shall be Sixteen in September, and
lots of Our Fellows at My Tutors are in love. Greening
Minor, Who is a Regular Shrimp, regularly rites verses
To the Barmade in the Slough Station refreshment room.
First classâI mean the Refreshment Room, not the
Verses. One Poem biginsâ

âHow Nobly Does Thy Fair Form Tower,

Whenare I Gaze On Thee.

I Wish thou Wert a Lilly Flower,

& I a Hunney Bee.â

Which is Not Half Bad for a Lower Boy. And Regger is
Secretly ingaged to his Sisters Jerman Guverness, who is
30 if a Day. She Has Promised to Wate for Regger, who
is a Year Older than Me, and simply awfully Divoted to
Her. She Makes Splendid Gingerbred with Nuts in it,
which will come in Usefull if Reggerâs Pater Cuts Him
Off with a Shilling.

Mrs. Clanarthurâs Christian Name is Ermengarde, but
Her Friends call Her Nini for short. The Divise on Her
Note Paper is a Gold Spider in a silver Web, and she
Wares a little Broach with a Diamond Spider in a Gold
Web. She keeps on Telling me she is Not Young, but
That must be All Rot, because She is so mutch moar
Girlish than the 2 Girls on Board. They are the Pope-Baggotes,
and Lady Jane is Fatter than ever.

[237]

Wednesday.

I canât Immajin Why Mrs. Clanarthur ever married
such a regular Scug as Captain Clanarthur, though she
Says she was a mear Child, and did It to Pleese Her
Family. They have been 10 Yearse married, so if she
was so young at the time she cannot be as old as she says
she is. She says she Had Her Hair Done up and wore
Long Skirts For the first Time on her Wedding Day, and
thought more of the Cake and the Presents than what
was to Come. She cried when she Told me that, after
dinner on Deck, when an Italian Opera Fellow, whose
Name I canât spell, was singing Love songs to the Acompaniment
of the Mandolin, and the Starse were shining
more Brightly than I ever remember to Have Seen
Them. Her Hair has a Scent like Violets, and when Her
Head Comes Near you it makes you Feel Hot and cold
and Swimmyâat leest it does Me. Clanarthur was
Away Racing a Yawl of His at the Royal Portsmouth
Corinthian Yacht Club Rigatta, and I thoght if He
should Get Drowned what a Jolly Good thing it would
Be. He Ought to be Kicked for Making that woman so
frightfully wretchid when She is 10,000 times Too Good
For Him. N.B.âOf course She did Not Tell me what
he has Done, but I bet you Â½ a crown it is sumthing
Beastly caddish.

I think the Men on Board a Not very Well Bred Sett,
as they chaff Me like mad about Mrs. Clanarthur; and
even when she is Within Earshott, which makes Me want
Frightfully to Kick them all Round. I Cannot Sleep at
Night as I used to Do, and my Head Aches in a Beastly
way in the Morning. I have got a handkerchief of Mrs.
Clanarthurâs I Stole when She was Not Looking, and I
Keep it Under My Pillow at Night and Switch the illectric
light On and Look at it every Now and Then. There
[238]

is âNiniâ imbroidered in the Corner, and it Smells of
Violets, like her Hair. If I was married to a Lovely
Woman like that I should not be a Beast like Clanarthur.
She Told Me that she Never has suffered Him to Kiss
her on the Lips Since She Knew Him to be Unworthy of
a Pure Womanâs Love. Sumhow I am glad of that, thogh
it is Rough on Clanarthur.

Saturday.

Last Night Sumthing Happened I am Now Going to
tell you about. They were Throwing Coloured Lites on
the Sea from the Victoria Pier, and all the Big Steam
Yachts Had Fairy lamps Hung Out, and the Music of
the Bands and things Comming Over the Water quite
made it simply ripping. It was after dinner, and I was
Sitting on Deck with Mrs. Clanarthur, and She thought
She would like a Moonlight Pull in the Yachtâs dinghy, as
the Sea was so Beautifully Smooth. So I tipped two of
the
Spindrift
men to get the boat reddy, and not say
ennything to ennybody and We Started. There was a
Fritefully Stiff Tide on. I Rowed Her Round and Down
a Lane made of Torpedo Gun-boats on One Side and 1st
Class Cruisers on the other, All Reddy for the King to
inspect on Saturday. It was Ripping Fun, and Nini was
Delighted. Then we Drifted dreemily along Towards
Ryde, and I Forgot there was such a Fritefully Stiff Tide
Running out to Spithead because I was Holding Niniâs
Handâshe let meâand thinking there were Worse
Things than Coming under the Married Womenâs Property
Act after All.

When We Had got a Good Distance Out I found I
could Not Get Back For Nuts, However Hard I Pulled.

The Perspirashun was Running off me like Water and
my Arms Ached like Mad. Niniâshe had said I might
call her Nini the Evening BeforeâNini Could not See
[239]

ennything was Wrong, but I knew we were being Carried
Out to Sea at About 100 miles an Hour and it Kept Getting
Darker. N.B.âOf course, I did Not Care For myself,
but I Kept Thinking of Nini. She said the Poetry
of the illimittible Oshan made Her Trill like a Smitten
Lute, and I said, âDoes it?â and Kept Slogging Away
against the Tide without making 1 Not in 1,000 Hours,
as the Signals in Coes Roads kept getting Smaller. Then
a Southampton Liner came Rushing out of the Dark. I
Saw Both her Port and Starboard Litse as I Turned my
Head, so she must have been Coming Straight down on
Us. You may Suppose I had Fits, thinking of Mrs. Clanarthur,
and I would have tried to Shout, but I Had Lost
my Wind completely.

âHow pretty,â said NiniâMrs. Clanarthur I meanââthat
must be the
Campania
for New York from
Southampton.â And she went on Gassing about the
Beauty of the Seen without an Idea that we might be cut
in 2 Next Minute. But we got off. The liner swerved
to port and went by us lighted up like a sea Alhambra,
all her deckse crowded with People and her Band Playing
âThe Merry Widow,â and Clanarthur lost his chance of
being a Merry Widower. But she passed so jolly close
to us that a lot of Wash slopped in, and Nini screamed
and called out, âYou silly boy, itâs all your Fault!â which
I like, considering the sittuation. And She Pulled her
White Evening Wrap round her and said, âLetâs get back
to the yacht; itâs shockingly cold and the sea is getting
abominably Rough!â And then I had to own up what a
jolly Hat we were in, and that we had been steddily
Drifting Out to Sea for Some time Past.

What price me? I felt small enough to get into a
cricket-ball case already, but I felt something worse when
Mrs. Clanarthur Boxed my Ears. She said I was a Little
[240]

Idiot, and that she had been culpably Reckless to alow
Me to Take Her on the Water, and what would Freddy
say? Freddy is Captain Clanarthur. So I said I would
stand up to Him with or without Gloves, Fight Him with
Rivolverse across a necktie if he liked, and that He could
Divorse Her afterwardse and then she could marry me,
and everything would be jolly well settled all Round, as
she Had Told me He was aborrent to Her only the night
before when she kissed me under the Aft Awning three
Timesâwhich she Had Done, though she called me an
untruthful little Retch for saying so, and then she had
Histericks, and then what Uncle Podmore calls the Mallady
of the Wave came on, and I had to ship the oars
and Hold Her Up, and she was Awfully Bad. Mother on
the Turbean xing to Boulogne was Nothing To it. I am
not Joking When I Tell You that We Drifted About in
That beestly Dinghy all night at the immanent Risk of
Being Run Down by anything from a Tramp Steamer to
a Government Crooser, and if the Tide Had Not Turned,
which it did at 4 oâclock in the Morning, we should be
as dead now as Two People can be.

O crumbs, when I looked at Nini, who After jawing at
me till she was Tired Had Gone to sleep with Her Head
on my Shoulder! By the Glimmaring Light of Dawn she
Looked as Old as Aunt Honoria, and not Half as Nice.
Her Swagger Evening Gown and Mantal were Ruined
with Seawater, and one Long Tale of her Lovely Hair
was Washing about in the Bilje at the Bottom of the
Dinghy, we had shipped such a lot in the Night. Her
Forhead and one Eye were nearly Hidden by a Top Piece
with curls that had come off, though there was lots of
Hair underneath it, and she was Perfectly Blue with Cold
and Fright.

I thought she must have been Pretty Old when she
[241]

Married Captain Clanarthur after all, and when I Remembered
how mad I had been about Her, and how I
wanted to Snipe Clanarthur and Marry Her, I felt awfully
sick at having been such an unlimited ass.

She woke up and called me some more Names and then
a Pilot cutter came along bound for Portsmouth Pier, and
I Haled the Pilot and He agreed to take us back to Cowes
Road for Â£1. And they Hawled us on Board because we
were too jolly stiff to clime up the cutterâs side and we
Got back to the Yacht in Time for Breakfast.

You may guess if the men of the Party chaffed me Before
how frightfully they chaff Now, I am Roasted about
the Beastly Business from morning till Night. Uncle
Podmore told me they had sent out 2 Boats to Find us
and burned blue Lights. All Captain Clanarthur Said
when He saw Mrs. Clanarthur come up the yachtâs side
like a Ragbag, was, âSo there You are, are you?â But
suppose he is Lying Low to bring an Axion for Divorse,
do you suppose I shall have to marry Mrs. Clanarthur?

I do jolly well Hope Not. She is old enough to be my
mother, and Has a Perfectly awful temper.

Fancy me being as Pleased as a Fox-terrier with 2 tails
when she let me Kiss Her under the Deck Awning after
dinner. Fellows with lots of good sense can be asses at
times.

Of course I tell you All this in Confidence on the Strict
Q.T., because you are Not like other Girls about Keeping
a Secret. There is a Big Review of the Home Fleet and
the Swedish Squadron by the King to-day, and the Fleet
will be elluminated in the Evening after dinner, and there
will be Fireworks from the Victoria Pier. But whether it
is my having been Out all Night with NiniâI mean Mrs.
Clanarthurâin that rotten Dinghy or something else I
donât ixactly know, but I feel jolly miserable.

[242]
I wish Greening minor was here, it would do me Good
to give the little Brute a regular licking. Fancy him
Being in love with a Barmade and writing her verses.
And Regger, who has the nerve to make up to his sisterâs
Jerman Governess. I canât think why Fellows do such
idiotic Things.

I Think rather than Have to marry Mrs. Clanarthur I
would Run away and be a stoker like that Fellow in the
newspapers. She looks quite young again this afternoon
and her Hair is beautifully done, but I keep on seeing
Her as she was at 4 this morning, when that pilot-cutter
Found us.

I am getting rather sorry for Clanarthur tied up to a
Woman who Boxes a Fellowâs ears and calls him Names
for Nothingâthat is, I should feel sorry for him if I was
quite Eesy in my mind about his bringing an Axion for
Divorse.

Ever your affeckshionate Brother,

Tynstone

[243]

FOR VALOR!

THE city of Smutborough was holding a solemn public
function in honor of one of her sons. Formerly
a soldier in the Smutborough Regiment, he had won his
V. C. a long time back in the early days of the last South
African War. At the conclusion of hostilities, having, like
many other men, attained perfect competency and ripe
experience with the expiration of the age-limit, Color-Sergeant
Stoneham was naturally shelved as being of no
further use to the nation, except in an emergency like the
last.

The rear of the Town Hall, Smutborough, formed one
side of an unsavory blind alley: a dingy
cul-de-sac

blocked at the end by the high, sooty, spike-bordered wall
of what was termed, with mordant but unconscious
humor, the Workhouse Recreation Yard. The Workhouse
loomed large upon the opposite side. Though the
great main entrance for misery was in another street, a
solid oaken door, hospitably garnished with large nails
and a double row of bristling prongs, exhibited upon a
mud-splashed fanlight above it the black-lettered legend,
âCasual Ward.â

It was only one oâclock, and the door would not open
before seven, but a queue of deplorable applicants had
already mustered before it. A tall, upright, gaunt man
of about forty, dressed in a weather-stained jacket-suit of
tweed, and wearing a shabby deerstalker low over his
haggard eyes, had been one of the last to attach himself
to Povertyâs kite-tail.

Against the wall of the Workhouse Recreation Yard
was the excuse for a considerable expenditure of public
[244]

funds at a moment felt by the humbler citizens of Smutborough
to be extremely inopportune. The excuse was
let into the sooty brick masonry. It made a queerly-shaped
bulge in the middle of an oppressively new Union
Jack which covered it, and upon each side of this tantalizing
mystery stood a large, pink, shining police-constable,
in the largest size obtainable of brand-new white
woolen gloves.

At the bottom of the blind alley were more constables,
ready in case of the mob of unemployed making a rush
round from the front of the Town Hall. But at present
it surged, a human sea lashed to fury by the whip of
hunger and the voice of Socialism, in the square outside
the long row of first-floor windows where the sumptuous
luncheon was laid for a hundred guests.

âAâaâah! Tâssâs! Yaâ-âaah!â

âClose up here, close up!â A police-sergeant, hurrying
from the bottom of the alley, herded the struggling
queue before the door of the casual ward into a compact
bunch. Then the rearward portals of the Town Hall,
before which a red-and-white striped awning had suddenly
sprouted, were thrown wide. A crush of rosetted
stewards, carrying very shiny hats, preceded the Mace-Bearer;
the Mayor, a plump and rosy personage, in his
furred robes and chain of office, appeared, walking between
a lovely lady in sumptuous sables and an accurately-attired
gentleman, whose intense vacuity of eye,
mechanical bow and smile, and inability to utter anything
without being first prompted by an attendant secretary
from behind, denoted him a Personage of the first
importance.... The Sheriff followed with the Mayoress,
the Aldermen and the guests trooped after. And the
mob at the other side of the Town Hall, making a charge
round the corner, and being repulsed by the police, vented
[245]

its indignation in such an outburst of booâs that the
Mayorâs speech was delivered in dumb show. Everybody
clapped when he had done, though. Upon which
the Personage, prompted by his attendant spirit, delivered
himself in short, House of Commons gasps of the
contents of a Be-ribboned roll of typoscript. The last
sentence was audible: âAnd let this! Be a perpetual!
Reminder to this! And succeeding generations! How
our! Mother country! Rewards her! Heroic sons!â
Everybody clapped and applauded the Personage. The
Personage, then, advancing upon exquisitely-polished
boots to the Union Jack with the mysterious bulge under
it pulled a white cord with a lavender kid glove, and
brought the flag down, revealing a square block of Caen
stone bearing some sculptural figures in low relief set in
the masonry above a neat little drinking fountain. Then
the Personage, the lovely lady in furs, the Mayor and
Mayoress, Sheriff, Aldermen, guests, and stewards
trooped back into the Town Hall to luncheon, and the
crowd surged back again to boo the banqueters. But
after the last of these had, under a cross-fire of gibes and
taunts, taken himself away, the turbulent ocean of humanity
rolled back into its foodless garrets and cellars,
and the Socialist leaders who had urged on the ring-leaders
retired to dine at a hotel. Subsequently the alley
behind the Town Hall became gorged with homeless persons
seeking shelter for the night, and when seven oâclock
struck and the Casual Ward door opened, one rush of
misery packed it instantly from wall to wall, and Stoneham,
V. C., late Color-Sergeant in the Smutborough Regiment,
found himself shut out.

He wondered, as he ruefully felt in his empty pockets,
whether it would end in his having to sell the Cross? He
had never failed to raise money on his reserve-pension
[246]

when the General Brushmakerâs Union had forced him to
come out with the other men, because a non-union

employÃ©
had been taken on at the factory. Since then
he had navvied, stoked, scavenged, done everything and
anything that a capable man might do to get bare bread
and common shelter for himself and his. Now the wife
was in Clogham Infirmary with two of the children, and
another was dead of clemming, and ... and the old
wound from the cross-nicked Mauser bullet pained him
horribly. He was giddy and sick with starvation, and
the world was spinning round....

Just in time he caught at the edge of the new drinking
fountain, and saved himself from falling. The grudging
glimmer from the fanlight over the door of the Casual
Ward showed him something that roused him as a swooning
man may be roused by a splash of icy water in his
face. It was his own name in shining gold letters, boldly
incised upon a handsome tablet under the sculptured
block that jutted from the sooty brick wall.

âLord above, whatâs this?â gasped the man whom
Smutborough had that day toasted. He struck a match,
the last he had, and read, beneath the bas-relief which
represented the cityâs hero in the act of shielding a
wounded officer with his body from a supposititious volley
of Boer bullets:

TO COMMEMORATE THE GALLANT ACTION

BY WHICH COLOUR-SERGEANT H. STONEHAM,

OF THE SMUTBOROUGH REGIMENT,

AND A NATIVE OF THIS CITY,

WON THE VICTORIA CROSS.

In Action, Paardfontein, Transvaal, South Africa, 1901.

âMove on, you!â said the voice of a police-constable
behind him. And Stoneham, V. C., drove his freezing
[247]

hands deep into his ragged pockets, wheeled and obeyed.

âItâs a rum world!â He reeled a little in his gait, and
whispered thickly to himself, as if some of the champagne
and grub that had been consumed that day in his honor
had got into his head by proxy. âDamned queer from
start to finish! But, in the long run, Iâm a bit better off
than the bloke in the Bible. He asked for bread, and
they gave him a stone. And Iâve got a drinking fountain
into the bargain!â

And the wet night swallowed him up.

[248]

MELLICENT

âHAPPY is the corpse, they say, that the rain rains
on,â observed Mr. Popham, âbut knowing his
rheumatic nature, I could have wished him a drier day.
However, we must take what comes, and itâs curious that
what comes is generally what one would have preferred
to be without. Life is very like a switchback railway,â
continued Mr. Popham. âNow youâre up, a-looking down
upon other human beings; and now youâre down a-looking
up at âem. And similarly your fellow-creatures as
regards you. Itâs a curious reflection that I shanât ever
measure out his colchicum again; or soothe the morning
twinges in his knees and elbers with a lithia lollipop in a
glass of warm water; or hear him swear when I tighten
his straps and buckles; or fetch and carry his wigs
between this and the hairdresserâs in Regent Place. Who
do those wigs belong to now? Yesterday his coffin, an
extra-sized, double oak casket, metal-lined, with plated
handles and silver name-plate, stood in there!â He
jerked his head at the double doors leading into the bedroom.
âThis morning we accompanied him to Woking
Cemetery. This afternoon they are a-reading of the
Will in Portland Place, and Odlett gave me his solemn
word that John Henry shouldnât remove his ear from
the library keyhole without finding out whether a little
bit on account of faithful services rendered hadnât been
left to Frederick T. Popham, valet to the above. For
he promised to leave me something all along, and almost
[249]

with his last breath, âI havenât forgotten you, Popham,â
says he. âYouâve been remembered, youâll find, in the
Will.â And ... Lord! Was that you? What a turn
you gave me, Miss Mellicent!â

âWhy, youâre quite nervous, Mr. Popham, sir,â said
Miss Mellicent.

Miss Mellicent had bumped at the door with the end
of a coal-scuttle, and now apologized, bringing it in. Miss
Mellicent was a thin person of some thirty London summers,
dressed in a worn black gown with stray threads
sticking out where crape had been ripped off. Her hair
would have been a nice brown if it had been less dusty,
her gray eyes were timid and kind, and her dingy pale
face had a look of belated girlhoodâwas sometimes quite
transfigured into prettiness when she smiled.

âIâll own I am a little unlike myself,â agreed Mr. Popham.
âPerhaps itâs his luggage all ready in a pile near
the door, as if we were off to a foreign Spa within the
next five minutes, or going down to Helsham to stop in
his usual rooms in the south wing. Perhaps itâs his going
off so sudden in quite a mild attack. Perhaps itâs the
strain of the funeral this morning, perhaps itâs sympathy
for Sir George and the family, perhaps itâs a little anxiety
on my own account! I know what he had, and Iâve my
notions as to how heâs disposed of it! The likeliest way
to bring about a lawsuit and get it into Chancery would
be his way, bless you! The embroilingest way; the way
to bring about the greatest amount of jealousy and bitterness;
the way to cost the most to all concerned and bring
about the smallest return in the way of satisfaction and
profit to âem, would be the way heâd give the preference
to over all. And if he was a-listening to me at this
minute,â said Mr. Popham, with a slight uncomfortable
glance toward the folding doors that led into the bedroomââand
[250]

Iâm sure I hope heâs better employed!âheâd
own Iâve done him no more than justice!â

âThe many years Iâve known General Bastling,â said
Miss Mellicent, âand itâs going on for twenty that heâs
lodged with us four months in each twelvemonthâIâve
never asked or cared to know. Was he a rich gentleman?â

âWhy, I should call him pretty snug at that,â said
Mr. Popham. âTen thousand in Home Rails; a pretty
little nest-egg of five thousand in Government Three per
Cents; a matter of sixteen hundred invested in the Chillianmugger
Anthracite Mining Company; and a nice little
bit of loose cash in the current account at Coxâs. Thatâs
what Iâve my eye on, to tell you the truth; and I donât
think itâs unnatural or greedy.â

âI would never believe you selfish or money-seeking,â
said Miss Mellicent, folding her hard-worked red hands
upon her worn stuff apron, ânot if an Angel was to come
down out of the stained-glass window in churchâI sit
under it on a Sunday evening sometimes, when Iâm not
wanted at homeâand tell me so!â

âI hope Iâm not naturally more of a groveler than
other men in my situationâmy late situationâwould be,â
returned Mr. Popham. âBut forty odd is getting on in
years, and Iâm reluctant at my time of life to go looking
for another middle-aged gentleman to valet. The young
ones are too harum-scarum and given to late hours for a
man like me; and if they werenât, theyâd be unnatural
phenomenons. A nice little inn in a country town, with a
decentish bar custom and a solid bottle-and-jug department,
and a cold lunch in the coffee-room on market-days,
would suit me; with Hunt, Harriers, Freemasons,
and Friendly Societiesâ dinners to cater for; and a private
understanding with a few gamekeepers anxious to promote
[251]

their own interests in a quiet, unassuming wayâthe
guards of the late and early Expressesâand one or two
West End poulterers and greengrocers as I have met in
what I might call the butterfly stage of my existence,
when I wore silk stockings and livery, floured my hair
regular, wore a bookay on LevÃ©e and Drawing-Room
days, and would as soon have eaten cold joint or cleaned
the carriage as taken up coals. And why I havenât relieved
you of the scuttle before this, is a question between
me and my conscience. Let me take it and put it
down. It wonât be the first time, if it is the last, will it?â

âDonât, Mr. Popham, sir!â pleaded Miss Mellicent;
âdonât speak in that downhearted way.â Her red hands
plucked at a corner of her dingy stuff apron, her gray
eyes were already pink about the rims. Tears rose in
them. She coughed and swallowed nervously.

âThe Bastling Arms is the name of that there little
inn,â said Mr. Popham. âThe sign is the same as the
crest on
his
notepaper and his seal-ring and the lock of
that despatch-box.â He pointed to the despatch-box
crowning the pile of solid, well-used, much be-labeled
portmanteaux and imperials that occupied the corner
near the door of the roomâa comfortably furnished,
rather dingy second-floor apartment in a quiet street
above, and running parallel with, Oxford Circus. âThe
landlord died the day before yesterdayâas if to oblige
or aggravate me, I donât know which!âand the widow,
knowing my ambitions, dropped me a postcard to inform.
Three hundred is wanted for the lease, stock, and goodwill,
and fifty for the furniture, stable and yard-effects.
A bargain, Miss Mellicent, if I only had the money!
But as it goes, Iâm a hundred and fifty shortâunless
John Henryâs ear is tingling at this moment with tidings
of comfort and joy. Now, what do you mean by lighting
[252]

a fire as if I wanted coddling, when youâve a dozen people
to look after, if youâve one?â

Miss Mellicent was down on her knees at the old-fashioned
grate, laying a fire. She struck a match and
lighted the kindling, and, though it was mid-June, the
bright blaze was welcome in the dingy sitting-room,
whose window-panes streamed with torrents of rain.

âThe gentlemen are all out but the third-floor front,â
she said, âand when the rain began, and I thought of you
sitting up here in the dim light alone, it seemed as if I
might do this much to make things cheerfuller. For
youâve done so much for me ever since I came hereââher
red and blackened knuckles went up to her pink-rimmed
eyesââyou always done so much for me!â

âFor you, my dear soul!â ejaculated Mr. Popham,
with circular eyes. âYou make too much of things, Miss
Mellicent!â

âThatâs one of âem,â cried grateful Mellicent, turning
upon him a thin, blushing face down which two tears
openly trickled. âYouâve called me âMiss Mellicentâ
from the first. From the time I came here to Mr. and
Mrs. Davis, an orphan, ten years old, in my cheap black
frock, made out of the skirt of poor motherâs mourning
for poor father, youâve always called me âMiss.â It
helped me, somehow; just as your carrying up the heavy
cans of hot water and the coals did.â

âYou was a bright-eyed, grateful little mouse, too,â
said Mr. Popham retrospectively, âand manyâs the time
Iâve had it in my mind to speak to Mr. and Mrs. Davis
about their driving a little thing like you so hard.
Theyâre past driving now, thatâs one comfort! Itâs years
since Iâve set eyes on either of âem, now I come to think
of it!â

[253]
âItâs years!â Mellicent echoed in a slightly bewildered
way. âWhy of course it would be years!â

âShe was a mountain, was the venerable lady, and the
old gentleman was a mere lath,â said Mr. Popham meditatively.
âHe used to answer the letters we wrote year
by year, season in and season out, from the family seat
at Helsham, from the Engadine, Aix, or Ems, Paris, or
the Riviera, to say we were coming on such a day. Ten
years ago the writing of the letters changed to a feminine
handâand since then I havenât seen him.â

âWhyâdonât you knowâhe died?â said Mellicent.

âDid he really?â cried Mr. Popham. âWell, it was
like him to keep it so quiet, and like the old lady, too.
Reminds meâI havenât set eyes on
her
for a matter of
five year and over!â

âOh dear, Mr. Popham! sheâs dead too!â gasped Mellicent
in distress.

âSheâd be pleased to know how little weâve missed
her, I know,â responded Mr. Popham cheerfully. âNow,
quite between ourselves, Miss Mellicent, since for the
first time since Iâve known you weâre indulging in a confidential
conversationâwhoâs carrying on the house?â

âDonât you know? Noâyouâve never asked or
thought to ask in all these years,â returned Mellicent.
âThe person who carries on the house isânot quiteâbut
I suppose she would be called soâa lady!â

âAnd very sensibly she manages,â approved Mr. Popham,
âin keeping out of the way and letting you do it
for her. And a nice income she makes, Iâll be bound!
Why, the house has never been empty since first I come
here. Old gentlemen with ample means on every floor,
toddling out to their clubs when their various complaints
permit, and dining at homeâand dining comfortably,
tooâwhen they donât. Such a polish on the boots, such
[254]

a crispness of the breakfast bacon, such a flavor about
the coffee and the curries, such a tenderness about the
joints, such a dryness about the daily newspaper, and
such an absence of over-statement about the total of the
weekly bill as, with all my experience, Iâve never found
elsewhere. And all owing to You! If your modesty allowed
you to think over yourself for one momentâwhich
I truly believe youâve never done since you were bornâyouâd
admit, Miss Mellicentâthat youâre a wonder!â

âOh! do you truly mean it?â she cried, with her heart
upon her lips.

âI do,â answered Mr. Popham, with warmth. âAnd
if the present proprietor of the lodgings wasnât a ladyâand
knew what was good for himâheâdâââ

âOh no! No, Mr. Popham, sir, no! He wouldnât.
No one could ever think of me in such a way!â Her
red and blackened hands went up to the piteous, quivering
face, and her lean bosom heaved behind the meager
bib of her scorched stuff apron. âNever!â

âTell me now, upon your honor,â Mr. Popham pressed.
âHavenât you never looked at nobody in that way yourself?â

Miss Mellicent fairly writhed and shuddered with
nervousness. But she laughed, looking away from Mr.
Popham and into the old-fashioned but handsome glass
over the mantelshelf, in which, within an Early Victorian
frame of fly-spotted gilding, the reflection of Mr.
Pophamâs alert, well-featured, respectable profile and
her own poor, wistful face appeared together.

âIf you wonât ask me no moreâyes, then! but he
never dreamed oâ me!â

âMore shame for him!â asseverated Mr. Popham
stoutly. âWhy, what a put-upon young woman you are,
Miss Mellicent! Since you were ten years old, I do
[255]

verily believe youâve never had a pleasure, never had a
present, never had a friend, never had an outingâno
more than youâve had a sweetheart.â

âAh, but,â she cried, with a happy laugh, âI have had
a friend! Youâve been my friend, havenât you? And I
have had pleasure in knowing that. And Iâve had an
outingâtwice. Once Uncle Davis took me to the
Worldâs Fairâit was my twelfth birthdayâand once,
two years later, you treated me to the pantomime.â

âDid I? And uncommon generous and considerate it
was of me, I must say, to have done that much for you,
you poor little neglected, lonely creature!â uttered the
remorseful Mr. Popham.

âI never forgot it,â Mellicent cried, with beaming eyes.
âThe glory and the splendor, the living roses and the
talking animals and the shining fairies, and you to explain
it all and be so kind. I never forgot it! Who
could?â

âWhy, Iâm beginning to remember something about it
myself!â said Mr. Popham, clearing. âWe partook of a
dozen oysters and some shandy-gaff at a fish-bar on the
way home. According to present views, we ought to
have shaken carbolic powder over that shellfish instead
of pepper, and washed it down with Condyâs Fluid; but,
being behind the present times, we enjoyed ourselves.â

âDidnât we!â Mellicent clapped her hands. âI have
gone back to that beautiful evening in memory hundreds
and hundreds of times! It has helped me through such
a lot of hard thingsâfor things are hard sometimes.
Sometimes, when you arenât here, and there isnât no one
to speak to on the stairs, and the gentlemen are over-particular
about their boots and changeable about the
hours for their meals, things get the better of me to that
extent that I scream and run!â

[256]
âScream and run, do you?â said the puzzled Mr. Popham.
âAnd how do you do it? Or do you do it without
knowing how, eh?â

âI shriek out loud and hear myself as though my voice
came from a long way off,â said Mellicent, opening her
large eyes, âand then my feet begin to run. I scream,
and I run screaming up to the little top attic I slept in
when I came here as a child, where my old rag doll is
still, and motherâs patchwork counterpane covers the
truckle-bed. And I hide my head in that, and cry
myself quiet and patient again!â

âAnd Lord have mercy on your lonely little soul!â
cried Mr. Popham. âPatient you are, and thatâs the
truth!â He took the knotty red hand and held it in
both of his for an instant, looking at the downcast face.
âBut donât scream and run any more. It isnât good for
you!â

âI havenât screamed and runned for quite a long time
now,â she answered. âButââher poor lips trembledââI
think I shall when you are gone for good.â

âNonsense, nonsense!â Mr. Popham squeezed the red
hand and dropped it gently. âIâll come and see you
from time to time.â

âAnd leave your little country inn?â said Mellicent,
trying to smile. âYou wonât be able!â

âI could leave the landlady in charge,â suggested Mr.
Popham. âStop, though, a landlady is the kind of
article that doesnât go with the furniture and fixtures. I
shall have to look out for her myself.â His face changed.
âUpon my word I shall!â

âI know the kind youâll choose,â sighed Miss Mellicent.
âAnd the best wonât be good enough for you, Mr.
Popham. She must be young and fair and plump and
rosy and blue-eyed, with golden curls like the Fairy
[257]

Queen in that pantomime, or the lovely dolls I see in the
shop windows when Iâm out buying meat and groceries
for the gentlemen. And her hands must be as white and
soft as mine are red and hard. Andâââ

âDonât cry, my dear!â begged Mr. Popham. He
stooped over her as she hid her flaming cheeks in the
hard-worked hands. âYou have pretty hair, Miss Mellicent,â
he said, with a sensation of surprise at the discovery.

âIâve been turning out rooms,â she sobbed, âand itâs
full of dust!â

âAnd youâd have a pretty figure,â said Mr. Popham,
now embarked upon a career of discovery, âif you took
the trouble to pull âem in. And youâre youngâbarely
thirtyâand Iâm ten years older. And youâre a first-class
double extra A.1. housekeeper, cook, and manager. See
here! Give the lady proprietor a monthâs notice, and
come and be landlady of the Bastling Arms at Helsham!â

âYouâyouâre not in earnest?â

She faced him, quivering, transfigured, panting.

âAinât I?â remarked Mr. Popham simply. âSay âYes,â
Miss Mellicent, give me a kiss, and we shall both begin
to believe it. Run and change your dress, and weâll call
a cab and make another evening of it, and if the Alhambra
ballet wonât do as well as the pantomime, under the
present circumstances, I shall be surprised! Thereâs
John Henryâs knock at the hall-door. He brings good
news, or it wouldnât be such a loud one. It takes the
girl ten minutes to get up the kitchen stairs; sheâs a born
crawler, if ever there was one, and Iâve a fancy I should
like you to let the boy inâif youâve no objection?â

âOh, no, no!â she cried gladly, and flashed out of the
room.

[258]
âSheâs wonderfully nimble on her feet,â mused Mr.
Popham; âand though Iâve never seen âem to my knowledge,
I shouldnât mind putting a bit on the chance of
their being pretty ones. Lord! I seem in for discoveries
to-day. Come in, John Henry!â

But it was not John Henry, but the butler from Portland
Place.

âOdlett! Well, this is kind; and you with such an
objection to getting your feet damp!â Mr. Popham
shook the large dough-colored hand of Mr. Odlett until
the butler secured the member from further assault by
putting it into his pocket.

âThe boy was wanted to go upon an errand,â explained
Mr. Odlett, in the voice of the description known
as rich. âAnd as a friend!ââhis smile creased his large
pale cheeks, and caused the temporary disappearance of
his small twinkling eyesââas a friend, no more port
being wanted for the party in the library, I thought Iâd
come and put you out of your misery!â

âThat was uncommon kind of you, Odlett!â breathed
the acutely-anxious Mr. Popham. He wiped his brow,
and fixed an intense gaze on the particular feature from
which intelligence might be expected.

âThe boy did his duty faithful from first to last,â said
Mr. Odlett, selecting a chair and carefully separating his
coat-tails as a preliminary to sitting down; âand when
he laughed, âad the presence of mind to drop his âead to
the level of the library door mat, consequently it was
supposed to be the pug a-sneezing!â

âWell,â gasped Mr. Popham. âWell?â

âThe Will come up to our fondest expectations,â continued
Mr. Odlett. âSir George, who never shoots, âave
the Generalâs old saloon-pistols and sporting Mantons,
and
Bellâs Life
and the
Army Gazette
for twenty year
[259]

back. Mr. Roderick is left the Chinese and Indian
curiosities on condition of his dusting âem hisself regularly.
My Lady âave ten pounds to purchase a mourning-ring,
provided sheâll undertake to wear it; the young
ladies ditto; and the moneyâââ

âThe moneyâââ choked Mr. Popham.

âThe money, with the exception of several smaller
legacies, goes, with the consent of the Mayor and Corporation
of Helsham, to purchase and lay out a Public
Park for the people in memory of the Testator. Thereâs
to be a mausoleum in the middle of it, in which his
crematory urn is to be kepâ, and a bandstand at each
end, because he always loved to see people cheerful
about him. Also, he bequeaths to Miss Mellicent Davis,
at his lodgings in Margaret Place, five guineas and a set
of ivory chessmen; and to his old and valued friend,
William Odlett, which is me, the sum of two hundred
pounds. He adds, he hopes Iâll drink myself to death
on it, inside of a month; but he always was a playful old
gentleman. Noâyouâre not forgotten!â

Mr. Popham wiped his brow with an air of relief.

âYouâre not forgottenâwhich ought to be a consolation
to you!â repeated Mr. Odlett, creasing all over with
a vast, comprehensive smile. âYouâre to âave his walking-sticks,
clothes, wigs, the rugs and plaids, and the
spare set of teeth, hoping youâll always have something
to employ âem on. I came over a-purpose to tell you;
youâre so fond of a joke, Popham.â

âI donât deny it,â said the crushed and disappointed
Mr. Popham; âbut where the humor of this one is, hang
me if I know!â

âYouâll see by-and-by,â said Mr. Odlett consolingly.
âWhen youâve âad time to think it over. Meanwhile Iâll
stand a couple of whiskies hot. A man donât come into
[260]

two hundred, cool, every day, and this windfall is particularly
welcome. You know Madgell, the landlord of
the Bastling Arms at Helsham, is gone over to the
majority?â

Mr. Popham nodded a pale face.

âThe lease, stock, goodwill, and fixtures of that pleasant
little âouse is to be âad for what I call a song. And
Iâm goingâin a week or so, when Iâve laid my hand
secure on this here little legacyâto pop in and settle
down. Plummer, the cook, a plump and capable young
woman, âave expressed her willingness to be the landlady.
I did suppose she had had a bit of an understanding
with you. But sheâs quite come round my way since
the reading of the will, and I thought youâd like to
know it!â

âYouâre uncommon considerate,â said the rasped and
tingling Mr. Popham, âbut Iâve made arrangements elsewhere.â

âPerhaps the Other One will change her mind when
she finds out youâre diddled in your expectations!â said
the comforting Mr. Odlett, shaking hands heartily.
âGood-night. I shanât hear of you coming to the door!â

But Mr. Popham did come, and slammed it behind the
departing form of Mr. Odlett with great heartiness.

âDamn his wigs and walking-sticks!â he said in the
murky passage, âand his spare teeth as well! A nice
Jobâs comforter, Odlett! âPerhaps sheâll change her
mind when she knows youâve been diddled in your expectations.â
Beg pardon, Miss Mellicent, I didnât see
you were there! Youâre not hurt, are you?â

âOnly by your thinking I could change!â said Miss
Mellicent, with a sob.

The ground-floor sitting-room door stood ajar; the
room was unoccupied. Mr. Popham led Miss Mellicent
[261]

in, turned up one of the blackened incandescent gas-jets,
and stood petrified at the sight its hissing white glare
revealed.

âA gray silk gown, trimmed with real lace, and a gold
chain!â cried the bewildered Mr. Popham. âA diamond
brooch, as Iâm a living sinner! and an opera-mantle and
kid gloves and a fan! And your pretty brown hair done
up quite tastefully, and your eyes a-shining over the
roses in your cheeks! Whatâs done it? Whoâs responsible
for it? How did it come about?â

If she had been less shy of him, she would have answered
in two words, âThrough love!â But she only
faltered:

âIâm so glad you think I look a bit nice in them.
Theyâthey belonged to poor Aunt Davis, and Iâve had
âem altered to fit. Sheâshe left them to me when she
died!â

âAnd handed over the lodging-house and furniture to
the present lady proprietor,â observed Mr. Popham,
searching in his trouser pocket for a cab whistle, âwhom
I donât happen to know by sight.â

âOh, yes, you do!â Miss Mellicentâs blush and smile
made quite a pretty little face of hers, and Mr. Popham
boldly kissed it on the spot. âOh yes, you do, for sheâs
me! I should say, I am her! Law bless you, dear Mr.
Popham, I didnât mean to startle you like that! Who
cares about your being left a lot of old clothes and wigs
instead of a sum of moneyâthough you deserved it, true
and faithful as you was to him thatâs gone! Havenât I
plenty for both? And landlord of the Bastling Arms
you shall be to-morrow, if youâve set your heart on it!
and we shall be late for the beautiful sights at the
theater if you donât whistle for a taxicab.â

âLife is certainly a switchback!â said Mr. Popham, as
[262]

he breathed and trilled alternately on the damp doorstep.
âNow youâre down a-lookinâ up at your fellow-mortals,
and now youâre up, a-lookinâ down upon âem!...
Weâll have a bit of supper at that very fish-bar, if
itâs still in existence, on our way home, carefully drawing
the line at oysters as risky and uncertain articles of diet
for two middle-aged people about to enter upon the
duties and privileges of married life!â

[263]

THE COLLAPSE OF THE IDEAL

CANWARDEN did not write sonnets, or he would
have composed many, not only in celebration of
Petronellaâs eyebrows, but of her crystalline blue eyes
and burnished hair, her willowy figure of the latest and
most wonderful shape, and her slim, white hands and
arched insteps. But in all his playsâfor he was a budding
dramatist of exceeding promiseâhe described her
in red-lined type:ââ
Enter So-and-So, a fair and graceful
girl of not more than twenty-five summers, with
sapphire eyes and golden locks, attired in the costume
of the period
â (whatever the period might be). â
She
exhales the joyous freshness of a May morning, and
her gurgling laugh rivals the spring song of the thrush.
â
This pleased the leading ladies hugely, even when their
eyes were not of sapphire; but stage-managers found
Urban Canwardenâs stage directions a trial. If he had
been firmly seated in the motor-car of public approval,
both hands on the driving-wheel as he ripped along the
track of success, they would have smiled even while
they writhed. But Canwarden was not yet famous, and
the stage-managers were free not to disguise their feelings.
However, he went on; getting thinâthin for a
plump manâin the effort to make enough to marry on.
For the beloved of his soul was not of the bread-and-cheese-and-kisses
type of betrothed of whom we read
in novels that have many years ago silted to the bottom-shelves
in public libraries, and are occasionally issued
as new in paper covers at fourpence-halfpenny. Her
full name was Petronella Lesser, and she dwelt with her
[264]

parents in an Early Victorian villa on Haverstock Hill,
a residence which had been slowly settling down on one
side ever since the Tube borings had started. The lease
would be out, old Mr. Lesser calculated, a day or two
before the Corinthian-pillared stucco and brick porch
sat down. He was something in the Italian warehouse
supply-line in the City, and a singular judge of olives,
GruyÃ¨re, and barreled Norwegian sprats. Petronella
never looked a fairer, more poetic thing than when concealing
vast quantities of these zests behind the latest
thing in blouses, day or evening wear, and Urban Canwarden,
as he gazed upon his betrothed, or very nearly
so, swore to himself that she should never know what it
is to go lacking the
hors dâÅuvres
that lend piquancy to
the Banquet of Life.

Petronella was a girl whose white and well-developed
bosom was the home of emotions but little livelier than
those that animate the beautiful person of a Regent-street
wax-doll. Sawdust will burn, it is true, but the
costlier puppets are stuffed with choicer stuffing. She
had not fallen in love with Urban Canwarden; she had
simply frozen on to him. She had liked sitting in the
authorâs box on First Nights, while the author tore his
hair at his Club or in his chambers. She liked his person,
his friends, his prospects. She looked forward to
an elegantly-furnished villa on Campden Hill, with a
cottage at Sonning or Hampton Wick, and mid-winter
runs to the South of France, when a distinguished
dramatist, the husband of a charming and attractive
wife, whose
salon
would be the constant resort of the
fine flower, the top of the basket of London Society,
should require rest and change of air after his exhausting
labors undergone in the composition and rehearsal
of the brilliant play, in four acts and eleven scenes,
[265]

destined to be the opening attraction of Mr. James Toploftyâs
Spring Season at the West End Theater. She
would dream thus paragraphically, whenever she did
dream, which was seldom, for her imaginative region was
small. She was stupid and narrow, cold-hearted and
mercenary.

âSince I have loved you,â Canwarden would say, âI
have been able to write of noble women. You have inspired
me; everything that is best in me comes from
you; everything I have done that is good I owe to
you....â

âYou dear, exaggerating, Romantic Thing!â was invariably
the reply of Petronella. âAnd when we are
married we shall have a 28 h.p. Gohard with nickel
fittings and a changeable body, and a chauffeur in livery.
I used to dream of a dear little private brougham when
we were first engaged, but nobody who wants to be
thought Anybody would have such an old-fashioned
thing now. How the world is changing, isnât it, with
motors and airships and Tubes to travel in?â

The Haverstock Hill villa vibrated as she prattled, and
the porch settled lower by the fraction of an inch. It
was a July evening, and the lovers, arm-in-arm, paced
up and down the damp and puddly graveled avenue
under the liquid-soot-distilling lilacs and acacias. The
reflection of a large fire danced upon the windows of
Mrs. Lesserâs drawing-room, and Petronella, despite the
warmth of Canwardenâs love, felt chilly. She wondered
why Urban had pressed her to put on goloshes and a
warm wrap after dinner and take this clammy evening
stroll arm-in-arm with him. And then she was conscious
that the heart against which her right hand rested
thumped heavily, and she felt his arm tremble, and remembered
[266]

that at dinner her betrothed had shown a
poor appetite in conjunction with a well-developed
thirst. As pigs are said to feel wind coming, as catsâeven
the most sedateâset up their backs and sprint
about the garden at the approach of a storm, Petronella
instinctively felt that bad news was in the air. A more
sentimental and much prettier girl might have anticipated
a shipwreck of the affectionsâexpected to be told
that Canwarden had found his Fate in anotherâs eyes.
Petronellaâs previsions of disaster concerned only his
banking account. It was that to which she was really
referring when she said she felt that something had happened.

âIt is true, dearest,â Canwarden said, with the kind
of hoarse groan that he had not been able to extract
from the leading young man in his last romantic drama
even with the grappling-hooks of continued effort.
âSomething has happened. My great playâfor that it
is great I feel, and always shall, despite the slings and
arrows of that eater of red meat, the Transatlantic critic
... my great play, â
The
...ââ

âI know, â
The Popshop Hearse
â ...â Petronella put
in hurriedly.

âNo, no ... â
The Poisoned Curse
,ââ corrected the
author, with a wince. âMy play, produced a fortnight
ago at Barney and Keedlerâs Classical Theater, New
York, is a failure ... a blank and utter failure! Yes,
yes! the management did cable to me to say it had been
enthusiastically received. I showed the message to you,
and you shared my gladness. But hereâhere is another
cable from my agent, Loris K. Boodler, of Skyscraper
Mansions, 49,000,000 Broadway, that says....â He
drew a crackling, flimsy paper from his waistcoat pocket,
and tried to unfold it with hands that shook. âI canât
[267]

read it because itâs too dark, but I remember every
word. â
YourâplayâtakenâoffâSaturdayâfollowingâproduction.
Variety vaudeville substituted. Writing.
Boodler.
â And I was looking forward to the authorâs
fees toââhe coughed in a choky wayââto furnish our
house and ... and buy that motor-car you were talking
about. It ... it seemed so sure a thing! I had
got such capital percentages; Barney and Keedler had
cabled to say the play was a success....â He choked.
âAnd now!...â

âYou told me all that before, dear,â said Petronella.
âBut you have two other plays coming out, havenât you,
in London theaters?... West End houses.... And
one failure doesnât spell ruin....â

âOne failure can break a dramatist, when it is a
failure of this kind,â said her disconsolate lover. âThose
two other plays are ... were coming out at theaters
held by the same lesseesâBarney and Keedler, of the
Mammoth American Dramatic Trust. And so, donât
you see, all my balloons are deflated at once. Iâve come
down with a crash, and ... it hurts! But you will trust
me, wonât you? You will go on believing in me, though
Iâve had what technical people will call a set-back. And
if our ... our marriage must be delayed....â He
stopped under one of the liquid soot-distilling lilacs, and
caught Petronella in his arms, crushing the draperies
arranged by her Hampstead dressmaker roughly against
his damp evening overcoat. âYou will not mind!...
We will wait and hope, and love each other ... love
each other.... After all, while we are together, nothing
is too hard to bear....â

Thus spoke Canwarden, counting his chickens ere their
emergence from the shell, after the fashion of a young
man too deeply in love to see clearly what manner of
[268]

young woman his heart is set upon. But Petronella
shivered, conscious that the Hampstead garden was
clammy, and that the dazzling halo of coming fame and
approaching prosperity had been banished from Canwardenâs
brow. He stood before her, tall and straight,
and sufficiently good to look at, with his bright brown
eyes, straight, short nose, and sensitive, clean-shaven
lips, though his curly hair, it must be added, was receding
too fast from a brow more bumpy than, according
to the accepted canons of classical proportion, a brow
should be. Upon his shirt-front a lilac had shed an
inky tear, and his voice was husky with love and sorrow,
not of an utterly selfish kind, as he promised Petronella
to work hard, never to cease working until he had regained
the lost ground.

âBut you never may!...â she said, and the doubt
in those shallow blue eyesâhe never had realized before
that they were shallowâpierced him to the soul. âAnd
Nora will be married before me, and she is two years
younger, and everybody in Hampstead will say....â

Canwarden, with heat, devoted Hampstead to the
devil. I am not defending him. Petronella thought him
brutal, coarse, and profane. Women of Petronellaâs kind
always enthusiastically uphold the dignity of the devil.
She told him what she thought, and she wound up in
the red-papered hall of the one-sided Hampstead villa
by saying that he and she had better part. She added,
as women of Petronellaâs type invariably do add, that
the dead past might bury its dead. And she drew off her
engagement ringâan olivine, imposed by a Bond Street
jeweler upon the too-confiding Canwarden as an emerald,
harnessed between two indifferent diamonds of yellowish
hueâand thrust it back upon him, and went
upstairs to her room and locked the door; and as the
[269]

hall-door banged violently and the iron avenue gates
clashed behind the haggard Canwarden, his late betrothed
sat down to pen a little note to Percy Flickerâa
young man without a chin, junior partner of a small
but pushing firm of shipbrokers at No. 35,000 Cornhill.
The porch made up its mind and sat down that night,
and Percy the chinless called upon the following evening,
and was compelled to enter his Loveâs bower by the
back-door.

And Canwarden, seeing volcanic ruins smoking where
his Castle of Hope had stood, wandered the West End
and the Strand like a thing accursed. He went into his
club, and men slapped him on the shoulder and congratulated
him upon the New York success. They would
learn the truth later, he said to himself, and then they
would chuckle and sneer. The rustling of the cablegram
in his waistcoat pocket whispered â
Yes sâsâ!
â Meanwhile
he had no appetite for solid food, and, quenching
the thirst that consumed him with iced brandy and soda,
he, Canwarden, usually the most temperate of
men, realized how easily spanned is the gulf that severs
the sober man from the inebriate. He might, perhaps,
have crossed it for good and all had he not chanced to
pass the invitingly open door of Growâs Transatlantic
Bureau of Exchange. The shipping advertisements
loomed large and gaily-colored in the window; passenger
lists and railway guides hung from hooks upon the walls,
and lay in piles upon the counter, and a civil clerk and
an attractive girl with squirrel-colored hair were busy
over ledgers and things. Prompted by his guardian
angel Canwarden went in and asked for the New York
papers. The mail was just in, and he got them, and,
leaning on the polished shelf-desk where people write out
code telegrams, he turned to the theatrical column. His
[270]

drama,
The Poisoned Curse
, had been withdrawn a fortnight
ago from the stage of Barney and Keedlerâs Theaterâslain
as a thing unfit to liveâand a variety vaudeville
substituted in its stead. Did not the cablegramâLoris
K. Boodlerâs cablegramâsay so? He would see
the hideous announcement for himself, and then go
under, as men went who had broken the golden bowl of
Youth and Hope, and were too weary to go on fighting.

Could it ... could it be a mistake...? Was the
play a success after all? It looked like it. For in flamboyant
type
The Poisoned Curse
: a Romantic Drama in
four acts and eleven scenes, by Urban Canwarden, was
announced by the
New York Trumpeter
as being presented
to-night, and every night, and to-day at 1.30, and
Saturday
matinÃ©es
as announced. The play had been
running when Loris K. Boodler sent the cablegram announcing
its withdrawal; the play was running nowâwould
run. Canwardenâs hands shook so that the flimsy
news-sheet tore. He glanced at the girl with the squirrel-colored
hair and apologized, saying that he would pay
for the paper. She smiled, and he found that he was
able to smile back again. He despatched a short but
expressive cablegram to the office of Mr. Loris K. Boodler,
relieving that smart and go-ahead agent from further
responsibility in connection with the collection of
his percentages, and walked out of Growâs Transatlantic
Bureau of Exchange with his head upâa free man.

Petronella married Percy Flicker. Canwarden is a
flourishing and popular dramatist, with a thumping bank
balance and a permanent predilection for bachelor existence.
All the female villains in his plays are blondes.
The stage directions, underlined in red, run thus: â
Enter
So-and-So, a fair and slightly formed woman of barely
thirty, with icy and repellent blue eyes and hair of a
[271]

pale and sunless straw color. She conveys the impression
of cold insincerity and self-centered absorption, and
her hard and mocking laugh falls gratingly upon the
ear.
â Which goes to prove that Human Nature is and
never will be anything but Human Nature until the
Curtain drops.

[272]

THE HAND THAT FAILED

FOUR men were seated about a round table, with
dessert and wine upon it, in the dining-room of a
luxuriously furnished house in a fashionable street in
the West End of Londonâa street which is the Eldorado
of the struggling professional man, the Tom Tiddlerâs
ground of successful members of the faculties of surgery
and medicine. The aroma of Turkish coffee and choice
Havanas was warm and fragrant upon the air, and the
Bishop consented to a second Benedictine. His left-hand
neighbor was a dry-faced, courteous gentleman, a
Kingâs Counsel, famous by reason of several
causes
cÃ©lÃ¨bres
. The third man at table was merely a hard-working,
small-earning practitioner of medicine and
surgery, settled in a populous suburb of the high-lying
North. Coming to the host, with whom the Highgate
Doctor had walked the hospitals in his student days, one
may describe him as a world-famous Consulting Specialist
and operator; one of the kings of the scalpel, the
bistoury, and the curette; a man of medals, orders, and
scientific titles innumerable. Forty-three years of age,
shortly about to be married (to a widowed niece of the
Bishop), and in excellent spiritsâa thought too excellent,
perhaps....

âWants rest, decidedly. Pupils of the eyes unnaturally
dilated, circulation not what it ought to be. Overdone....
Changed color when the servant dropped a
fork just now.... He had better take care!â said the
[273]

Highgate Doctor to himself. He had to deal with many
cases of nervous breakdown up Highgate way, where
there are so many compositors and clerks and journalists.
But the Bishop and the Kingâs Counsel had never
seen the Distinguished Surgeon look more fit, and so
they told him.

âWhat makes it more remarkable, in my poor opinionââthe
Bishop, employing his favorite phrase, emptied
his liqueur-glass and folded his plump, white handsââbeing
that our distinguished friend hereââhe waved
the fattest and whitest of his thumbs toward his hostââseldom,
if ever, takes a holiday.â

âWhen,â said the Distinguished Surgeon, playing with
a gold fruit-knife belonging to a set which had formed
part of the First Napoleon camp-equipment at Leipsic,
âwhen a professional manâs brain is absolutely clear, his
nerves infallibly steady; when his digestion, sleep, appetite
are unimpaired by any amount of physical and
mental labor; when his hand is the ready, unerring, unflinching
servant of his will at all times and all seasons,
what need has that man of rest and relaxation?â The
strong, supple, finely-modeled hand went on playing
with the historical fruit-knife, as its owner added:
âWork is my play! For change of air, give me change
of experience; for change of scene, new cases, or fresh
developments of familiar ones. The excitement of the
gaming table, or any other form of excitement, would be
a poor exchange for the sensations of the operator, the
skilled, experienced, unerring operator, who calculates to
the fraction of an inch the depth of the incision his
scalpel makes in the body of the anÃ¦sthetized patient
extended on the glass-table before him. Life or Death
are his to give, and the trembling of the balance one
way or the other is to be guided and controlled by his
[274]

unerring eye, his unerring brain, and his skilled, infallible
hand. He holds the balances of Fateâhe guides
and controls Destiny, and knows his power and glories
in it. He is a supreme artistânot in clay or marble,
gold or silver, pigments or enamelsâbut in living flesh
and blood!â

The Bishop shifted in his chair uneasily, and turned a
little pale about the gills. The removal of the episcopal
appendix some months previously had preserved to the
Church of England one of its principal corner-stones;
and the neat, red seam underneath the Bishopâs apron on
the right side, on the spot that would have been covered
by the vest-pocket of an ordinary layman, twitched and
tingled. And the Kingâs Counsel, who had once undergone
a minor operation for throat-trouble, hurriedly
gulped down a mouthful of port. The Highgate Doctor
alone answered, fixing his steel-rimmed pince-nez securely
on his nose, and tilting his chin so as to get the
hostâs face well into focus: âHe is a supreme artist, as
you say, and he delights in his work. But supposing him
to delight too much? Supposing him to have arrived at
such a pass that he cannot live without the excitement
of it!âthat he indulges in the exercise of his beneficent
profession as a cocaine-drinker or hashish-eater, or
morphinomaniac, indulges in the drug that destroys him,
morally and physicallyâhow long will he retain in their
perfection the faculties which have made him what he
is?â

âAs long as he chooses!â said the Distinguished Surgeon,
putting down the gold fruit-knife, and rising with
the easy air of the well-bred host. âHe is no longer a
mere man, but a highly-geared and ingeniously-planned
machine, in all that concerns the peculiar physical functions
brought to bear upon the exercise of his profession.
[275]

To lie idle, for such a machine, means rust and ruin; to
work unceasingly is to increase facility and gain in
power, and, provided it be carefully looked afterâand
I assure you my nuts and bearings receive the necessary
amount of attention!âthe machine of which I speak
may go on practically for ever!â And he ushered his
guests through the folding doors into his luxurious consulting-room.

âUnless there happened,â put in the Kingâs Counsel,
âto be a screw loose?â

âMy dear fellow,â said the Distinguished Surgeon,
with a smile, âmy screws are never neglected, I have
assured you. The machine wonât come to grief that
way!â

âIt might come to grief in another way,â said the
Highgate Doctor in a queer voice. âThe Inventor might
stop it Himself, just to prove to His handiwork that it

was
a machineâand something more!â

At this remark, plopped into the middle of the calm
duck-pond of sociality, the Bishop looked pained, as
might an elderly spinster of severe morals at an allusion
savoring of impropriety. The Kingâs Counsel, feeling
for the Bishop, turned the conversation; but the Distinguished
Surgeon and the Highgate Doctor were at it
again, hammer and tongs, in a minute.

âI do not simply believe I shall not fail, my dear
fellow! I
know
I shall not! As forâââ (the Distinguished
Surgeon, sitting smoking in his Louis Quinze
consulting-chair, mentioned a certain operation in abdominal
surgery, delicate, difficult, and dangerous in the
extreme) âI have performed it hundreds of times, successfully,
within the last twelvemonth, leaving minor
operationsâscores of themââhe waved the scores aside
with a movement of the supple handââentirely out of
[276]

the question! At the Hospital to-dayâ (mentioning the
name of a great public institution) âI operated in seven
cases, bringing up the number to one thousand and one.
The last was the most interesting case I have met with
for some time, presenting complications rendering the
use of the knife both difficult and risky, butâââ

The sharp whirring tingle of the telephone bell punctuated
the Distinguished Surgeonâs sentence: âBut sheâll
pull through; I guarantee it! Weâll have the bandages
off in three weeks. Sheâll be walking about before the
monthâs out like the others!â

âUnder Providence let us hope so!â said the Bishop,
encircled by a halo of fragrant cigar smoke. âThank
you, yes, I will take a whisky-and-soda. Without presumption,
let us hope so, remembering, trusting inâarahâtheâarahâthe
Divine assurance.â

âYou may take the assurance from me, my lord!â
said the Distinguished Surgeon. He got up and went to
the fireplace (carved by Adam), and leaned one elbow
lightly on the mantelshelfâan easy attitude, but instinct
with pride and power. âAs I have said, Case One Thousand
and One is a difficult case. I could name surgeons
of repute who would have hesitated to operate; but,
given the requisite skill and the necessary care, failure,
I hold, is out of the question. I have never failed yetâI
do not intend to fail. Itâs impossible!â

The second shrill, imperative summons of the telephone
bell ended the Distinguished Surgeonâs sentence.

âTch! Theyâre ringing ye up on the telephone from
somewhere,â said the Highgate Doctor.

âFind out what they want, Donald, thereâs a good
fellow,â said the Distinguished Surgeon, buttonholed by
the Bishop, whose urbane benevolence had creased into
[277]

smiles tinctured with roguishness, as he related a clerical
after-dinner story.

And the Highgate Doctor rang back, and unhooked
the receiver and cried: âHalloa?â and listened to the
thin ghost of a voice that droned and tickled at his ear,
and turned toward the Distinguished Surgeon a face
that had suddenly been bleached of all color.

âWell, who is it?â the Distinguished Surgeon asked.

âItâs the House Surgeon at the Hospital. Perhaps
ye would speak to him yourself?â the Highgate Doctor
said thickly; and the Distinguished Surgeon, released
by the chuckling Bishop, strolled over and took the
Highgate Doctorâs place at the receiver.

âHalloa! Yes, itâs Sir Arthur Blank!â he called, and
the ghostly voice came back.... âOne of the abdominal
sections in the Mrs. Solomon Davis Ward ...
Number Seven ... Mrs. Reed ... HÃ¦morrhage....
Imminent danger ... collapse.... Come at once!â

The Distinguished Surgeon glanced round, with eyes
that were sunk in pits quite newly dug. The Bishop, still
in his anecdotage, was buttonholing the Kingâs Counsel.
Plainly they had not overheard. And as the Distinguished
Surgeon took out his handkerchief and wiped the
cold damps from a face that had gone gray and shiny, he
knew relief. He avoided looking point-blank at the
Highgate Doctor as he made his courteous excuses to
his guests. âAn urgent caseâsuddenly called away for
an hour. My dear Lord, my dear Entwhistle, my dear
Donald, entertain yourselves for that space of time, and
donât deprive me of a pleasant end to this delightful
evening!â

But the Bishop, recently wedded for the third time,
took leave, accepting his hostâs offer of dropping him
at his hotel, and the pair got into fur coats and a snug
[278]

ante-brougham and drove away together. Soon after,
somebody from the Chancery Buildings came with
an urgent summons for the Kingâs Counsel, and he
melted away with regrets, and the Highgate Doctor sat
in the luxurious consulting-room, and started at every
stoppage of swift wheels in the streets.

The silent servants came and looked to the fire, the
Pompadour clock upon the mantel chimed eleven! And
then, looking up out of a brown study, the Highgate
Doctor saw his host returned, and started at his worn
and haggard aspect. As the demure servant relieved
him of his coat and hat, and vanished, the Distinguished
Surgeon dropped into an easy-chair and sat shading his
face with the right hand, whose steadiness he had so
vaunted. And that infallible, unerring hand shook as
if with palsy.

The Highgate Doctor could bear no more....

âO man,â he saidâin moments of excitement his accent
savored of from north of the Tweedââdinna sit
glowering and shaking there! I ken weel what has happened!
Your pride has got the killing thrust; she is in
her death-pangs at this minute Iâm talking, and you
stand face to face wiâ One you have denied! Am I richt
or no?â

The Distinguished Surgeon moved the shaking hand
and said, not in the calm level tone the Highgate Doctor
knew, but one jerky and uneven:

âYou are right! You shall know the truth, though it
places my reputation at your mercy....â

âForget your reputation a meenute,â said the Highgate
Doctor. âAs to Case One Thousand and One ...
is the woman dead?â

âNo ...â said the otherââno, I reached the Hospital
[279]

in time ... we called up the chart-nurse and the Matron,
had her taken up to the theater andâââ

âFound that ye had bungledâfor once in your life!â
said the Highgate Doctor. âAnd weel for you, if not for
your patient, that it is so. The ligature had slipped, I
take it, being insecurely tied?â

The Distinguished Surgeon looked him steadily between
the eyes and answered:

âThe ligature was not tied at all! A grosser instance
of neglect I never met with.â He got up and leaned
against the mantelshelf, folding his arms. âI said so
pretty plainly, and I have made a minute on the Hospital
register to that effect. I shall also draw the attention
of the Committee to the matter without delay!â

The Highgate Doctor blew his nose violently. His
eyeglasses were misty.

âYe have censured yourself? Ye will report yourself?
O man! I kenned ye were a great one, but ye have
never been so greatâin my eyesâas ye are this night!â

âThank you!â said the Distinguished Surgeon, as the
two men gripped hands. âAndâDonald, old fellowâI
am going to take a holiday!â

âWhere is the whisky-and-soda?â said the Highgate
Doctor gleefully.

[280]

HIS SILHOUETTE

âHE walked down Upper Bond Street, after leaving
his chambers, half-way up on the left-hand side.
The ground floor is occupied by the only London purveyor
of American chewing-gum, who does a tremendous
business in the imported article, and the shop is crowded
all day by ladies, young and old, whose jaws, even in
moments of repose from conversation, are in perpetual
motion. Englishwomen do not yet chew gum. Let us
hope that our wives, sweethearts, sisters, and cousins
will be slow to acquire what, in my opinion, is an unpleasant
habit, but too suggestive of arboreal tendencies
inherited from anthropoid ancestors.â

The man who was telling the story stretched out his
hand across the coffee-cups to select a toothpick. The
man who opposed him at the table promptly annexed
the glass-and-silver receptacle containing the article required.

âThe original ape,â he said, âprobably employed a
twig. I cannot encourage you in a practice you so
strongly denounce. Waiter, take these things away!
Bonson, my good fellow, let us hear your storyâif it is
worth hearing. If not, keep it to yourself. The man
began by walking down Bond Street. There is nothing
original in that. I myself do it every day without being
the hero of a story.â

âThis man was the hero of a tragedy,â said the man
who was telling the story. âOther people might smile
at it for a farceâit was a tragedy to him.â

[281]
âWhere did the horror of it come in?â asked the other
man.

âUnder Shelmadineâs waistcoat,â said the man who
had been addressed as Bonson. âShelmadine was losing
his figure, which had been his joy and pride and the
delight of the female eye ever since he left Oxford,
without his degree, and, thanks to the influence of his
uncle, Colonel Sir Barberry Bigglesmith, K.C.B., Assistant
Under-Secretary to the Ordnance Office Council,
took up a Second Division Higher-grade Clerkship at
Â£280 per annum, which sufficiently supplemented his
younger sonâs allowance of Â£500 to make it feasible to
get along with some show of decencyâdonât you follow
me?â

âIf I had followed this beggar down Upper Bond
Street,â hinted the other man, knocking an ash off a
long, slim High Dutch cigar, âwhere would he have led
me?â

âInto his tailorâs,â said the man who had been addressed
as Bonson promptly. âHe walked in there regularly
every day on his way to the War Office. Clothes
were his passionâin fact, he simply couldnât live without
clothes!â

âCould we?â answered the other man simply.

âI have heard that Europeans shipwrecked on the
palm-fringed shores of a Pacific Island,â said Bonson,
âhave managed to do very well without them. Under
those circumstances, let me tell you, Shelmadine would
still have managed to be well dressed. He would have
evolved style out of cocoa-fiber and elegance out of
banana-leaves, or he would have died in the attempt. I
am trying to convey to you that he had a genius for
clothes. He evolved ideas which sartorial artists were
only too happy to carry out. He gave bootmakers hints
[282]

which made their reputations. He would run over to
Paris every month or so to look at Le Bargyâs hat and
cravats. He never told anyone where he got his walking
sticks, but they were wonderful. I tell youâââ

âEvery man likes to be well dressed,â said the man
who was listening to the story, âbut this beggar seems
to have had coats and trousers on the brain.â

âRather,â said the narrator. âHe thought of clothes,
dreamed of clothesâlived for clothes alone. Garments
were his fad, his folly, his passion, his mania, his dearest
object in life. Men consulted himâmen who wanted to
be particularly well got-up couldnât do better than put
themselves in Shelmadineâs hands. He permitted no
servile copying of the modes and styles he exhibited on
his person. âForge my name,â he said to a fellow once,
âbut never copy the knot of my necktie!â Chap took the
advice, and did forge his nameâto the tune of Â£60.
Shelmadine would not prosecute. He was planning an
overcoatâa kind of Chesterfield, cut skirtyâwith which
he made a sensation at Doncaster this year, and when a
certain Distinguished Personage condescended to order
one like it, Shelmadine made the three he had got, quite
new, and wickedly expensive, into a parcel, poured on
petrol, and applied a match. Shut himself up for three
days, and appeared on the fourth with a perfectly new
silhouette.â

âA perfectly new what?â said the listener, with circular
eyes.

âShelmadineâs creed was that for a man to look thoroughly
well dressed he must have a perfect silhouette.
Every line about him must be perfect. The sweep of
the shoulders, the spring of the hips, the arch over the
instep, and so forth, must display the cut of scissors
wielded by an artistânot a mere workman. Now, on
[283]

this particular morning, not so very long ago, it had
been brought home to him, as he looked in his full-length,
quadruple-leaved, swing-balance, double lever-action
cheval glass, that the reflection it gave back to
him was not quite satisfactory. His silhouette did not
satisfy him. Then all at once came with a rush the
overwhelming discovery that he wasâââ

âGetting potty,â said the listener. âThose Government
clerkships play the devil with a manâs waist.
Nothing to do but eat, drink, sleep, walk, or drive to
the Office and sit in a chair gumming up envelopes or
drawing heads on the blotting paper when youâre there,
until you fall asleep. Once youâre asleep, you donât
wake till itâs time to go home. Consequently you develop
adipose tissue.â He yawned.

âDo you suppose,â asked the teller of the tale, with
large contempt, âthat Shelmadine lived the life of one
of those human marmotsâShelmadine, a man so sensitively,
keenly alive to the beauty of Shape, Form, Line,
and Proportion? Do you dream that he lightly risked
the inevitable result of indulgence in the pleasures of
the table or the delights of drowsiness? If so, you are
wrong. He rose at 5 a.m., winter and summer, in town
or country, and after a hot bath, followed by a cold
douche, pursued a course of physical exercises until
seven, when he breakfasted on milkless tea, dry toast,
or gluten biscuitsââthe other man shudderedââwith,
perhaps, a little plain boiled fish, its lack of flavor undisguised
by Worcester sauce or any other condiment.â

âHorrible!â said the other man. âI once tried....â

âAfter breakfast, in all weathers, he walked five miles,
within the Radius, returning to dress for the day. Anon
he would saunter down Bond Street, look in at the shops,
where he was adored, and criticize the new models submitted
[284]

to him, as only Shelmadine could, show himself
at his Club, stroll in the Park, and get to the Ordnance
Office about eleven. The floors at Whitehall are solidly
built, consequently his habit of jumping backward and
forward over the office-table when he felt his muscles
dangerously relaxed, met with little, if any, opposition
in the Department. Dumb-bells, of course, were always
ready to hand. At his Club the invariable luncheon
supplied to him was the eye of a grilled cutlet, a glass of
claret and water, eight stewed prunes, and, of course,
more gluten biscuits. He shunned fat-forming foods
more than he would the devil!â

âAnd made his life a hell!â said the other man, with
conviction.

âMy dear fellow,â said the relater, âyou canât understand
what a manâs life is or is not until you have seen
both sides of it. A Second Division Higher-Grade War
Office clerkship allows of a good deal of liberty. Picture
Shelmadine as the
enfant gÃ¢tÃ©
of Society, followed,
stared at, caressed and courted, by the smartest feminine
leaders of fashion, as well as by the swellest men, as
the acknowledged Oracle in Clothes. Thereâs a position
for a young man single-handed to have achieved. To
be the vogueâthe rageâthe
coq de village
âthe
village

being Londonâand at twenty-seven.â

âExhausting,â said the other man, âto keep up, but
sufficiently agreeable. Quite sufficiently agreeable! And
I realize that at the psychological moment, when the
fellow discovered that his figure had begun to run to
seed, he sustained a shockâkind of cold moral and
mental
douche
a professional beauty gets when her toilet
glass shows her the first crowâs-foot. Did your friend
have hysterics and ask his valet for sal-volatile? I
should expect it of him!â

[285]
âShelmadine did not employ a man,â said the teller
of the tale, fixing his eyeglass firmly in its place, âto do
anything but brush his clothes. For all other purposes
connected with the toilet he preferred a Swiss ladyâs-maid.
Do not misunderstand, my friend,â he added
sternly, as the listener exploded in a guffaw of laughter.
â
Honi soit
... the rest of the quotation is familiar to
you. And Mariette DuchÃ¢tel had been strongly recommended
to him by his aunt, Lady Bigglesmith, as a most
desirable person for the post of housekeeper. She was
at least fiftyâretained the archÃ¦ological remains of
good looks, and owned a moustache a buddinâ Guardsman
might be jealous of, by Jingo! But her heart had
remained youthful, or we may so conjecture.â

âI begin to tumble to the situation of the swelling
subject of your story,â said the other man, pouring out
a Benedictine. âWhen your elderly housekeeper happens
to be in love with you, it is bad enough. Things become
complicated when the victim of your charms happens to
be your maid. Continue!â

âA visit to his tailorâs on the day on which my story
begins,â said Bonson, âconvinced Shelmadine thatâin
fact, his outlines were becoming indefinite. âThis will
not do, sir,â said his tailor, a grave and himself a portly
personage, âwith your reputation for silhouette to keep
upâand at your years. We will let out the garment one
inchâa thing I decline to do even for Royal Personages,
as destructive of the designâand as this is now the
Autumn Season I recommend you to obtain leave.
KlÃ¼mpenstein in the Tyrol has a reputation for reducing
weight; its waters have done wonders for several of my
customers, and the Rittenberg affords several thousand
feet of climbing opportunity to tourists who wish to be
quickly rid of superfluous girth. But, first of all, I
[286]

should consult Dr. Quox, of Harley Street. Good-morning.â

âQuox of Harley Street went into Shelmadineâs case,
elicited the fact that his maternal grandfather had
turned the scale at twenty stone, that his mother, Lady
Fanny, hadnât seen her own shoe-buckles for eighteen
years, except when the shoes werenât onâdonât you
twig?âand that he possessed what Quox pleased to call
âa record of family obesity.â So Shelmadine, who, in
spite of rigorous diet and redoubled physical exercises,
kept getting more and more uncertain in his outlines,
rushed frantically off to KlÃ¼mpenstein in the Tyrol, with
what was, for him, quite a limited wardrobe. He drank
the waterâinfernally nasty, tooâand climbed the Rittenberg
religiously, without finding his lost silhouette.
Only on the Dolomittenweg, a pine-shaded promenade
of great promise in the flirtatious line, he did findâa
girl. And, despite his anxiety with regard to his silhouette,
they had an uncommonly pleasant time together.â

âHe had left his ladyâs-maid behind, I presume?â
hinted the listener.

âHe had,â said Bonson. âWhen he got back to London,
though, Mariette met him with a shriek. âHeavens!â
cried she, throwing up her hands, âthe figure of Monsieurâthe
silhouette on which he justly prided himself, whereâwhere
has it gone? HÃ©las! those beautiful clothes
that have arrived from the tailorâs during the absence of
Monsieurâ
jamais de la vie
will he be able to get into
them,
jâen suis baba
in contemplating the extraordinary

embonpoint
of Monsieur.â

ââHang it, Mariette!â said Shelmadine, quite shocked;
âam I so beastly bulged as all that comes to?â Mariette
broke down at that, and went into floods of tears. It
[287]

took the best part of a bottle of Cognac to bring her
round, and then Shelmadine set about overhauling his
wardrobe.â

âNothing would meet, I presume?â hinted the man
who had been listening.

âNot by three finger-breadths,â said the man who was
telling the story. âPlowondllellm Wells in North Wales
has got a kind of reputation for making stout kine lean.
Shelmadine got extension of leave on account of bereavement....â

âWhen a man loses his figure he may be said to be
bereaved!â nodded the listener.

âShelmadine tried the Wells, without success. All he
ate was weighed out in ounces, all he drank measured
out with the most grudging care; nothing was allowed to
enter his system that contained anything conducive to
the accumulation of the hated tissue, but nothing could
keep him from putting it on!â

âPoor brute!â said the hearer.

âHe had gone to the Wells a distinctly roundabout
figure. He came back a potty young man! Despair
preyed upon his vitals without reducing his bulk, however.
He saw âSlimalineâ advertised.â

âI know,â said the listener. âA harmless vegetable
compound which reduces the bulkiest middle-aged human
figure of either sex in the course of a few weeks to
the slender proportions of graceful youth. Three-and-sixpence
a bottle, sent secretly packed, to any address
in the United Kingdom.
Bis!
â

âHe then,â continued the narrator, âwent in for
âFrosherâs Fat-Reducing Soap.â Perhaps you are not
acquainted with that compound, which is rubbed briskly
into theâahâtheâââ

âPersonality,â put in the other man.

[288]
â... Until a strong lather is obtained. The lather
proved ineffectual; Shelmadine took to stays.â

âPhew!â puffed the other man.

The first man continued:

âAs the weary weeks went on he was compelled to return
to his desk at Whitehallâcrouching in a taxicab to
avoid observation. But concealment was useless. From
the Department allotted to the Second Division Higher-Grade
clerks the secret crept out, and Society pounced
upon it and tore it to shreds, shrieking.â

âLike âem,â said the listenerââlike âem!â

âThat night, as Shelmadine sat in his dainty dressing-room
surrounded by mountains of costly and elegant
clothes, which, though only of the previous seasonâs
make, would no longer accommodate his proportions,â
went on Bonsonââlounging clothes, shooting clothes,
walking clothes of all descriptionsâLondon did not contain
a wretcheder man. The exquisitely chosen waist-coats,
the taffetas shirts of the once slim dandy of the
War Officeâa world too narrow for the fat man who
now represented him were in piles about him. Dozens
of lovely gloves in all the newest shadesâsquirrel-gray,
dead-leaf yellow, Havana-brown, chrysanthemum-buffâwere
scattered around by the hands that were now too
stout to wear them. Piles of bootsâafternoon boots,
with uppers of corduroy leather, gray, fawn, or the white
antelope, emblematical of the blameless pattern of virtue;
walking boots, shooting boots, and shoes of all descriptions;
slippers in heliotrope, rose-petal pink, and
lizard-skin green, obscured the furniture. The pedal
extremities that had bulged beyond all reasonable limits
must now be accommodated in large Number Nines.
Even Shelmadineâs dressing gownsâfoulard silk, lined
with cashmereâhad declined to contain him.â

[289]
ââPon my word, you make me sorry for the idiot,â
said the listener; âmere clothes-peg, as he seems to have
been!â

âSuicideâthe thought of suicide had occurred to him.â

âHe ought to have swallowed a set of enamel evening
buttons or a set of five jeweled tie-pins,â suggested the
listener, âand taken leave of the world in an appropriate
manner.â

âI wonât go so far as to say that he would not have
done something desperate,â continued the man who was
telling the story, âhad not Marietteâwho may or may
not have suspected that things were getting to a desperate
pitchâappeared upon the scene. âPoor lamb! thou
art in despairââthus she addressed Shelmadine in the
affectionate idiom with which her native language
aboundsââconfide in Mariette, who alone can restore
the silhouette that seems for ever lost to thee. Seems
only, Monsieur; for at the bidding of me, myself, it will
return. A little condition is attached to the recovery of
thy figure, my childânot to be carried out if I cannot
be as good as my word.
Passe moi la casse, je te passerai
le sÃ©nÃ©.
All I want, Monsieur, is senna for my
rhubarbâyour written promise to marry Mariette
DuchÃ¢tel, daughter of Marius DuchÃ¢tel, druggist of
Geneva, if within three months you recover your beautiful
figure. What do you say? Is it a bargain? Will
you be fat and free, or slim and no longer single?
Speak, then! You agree?
Pour sÃ»r!
I thought you
would!ââ

âAnd did he marry his ladyâs-maid?â asked the listening
man quite eagerly.

âHe did not,â said the teller of the tale, âthough he
was very near it. Fortunately for Shelmadine, the girl
he had met on the Dolomittenweg Promenade stepped
[290]

in. She was an American, original, independent, and
determined. When Shelmadine wroteâon Ordnance
Office paperâto her in Paris, saying that Fate had
stepped in between them, and that she never could be
his, she asked the reason why. Not getting a satisfactory
answer, she ran over to London to see for herself
... bringing her motherâa vast person, who wore a
diamond tiara, mittens, and diamond shoulder-straps in
the evening, and carried them in a hip-bag by dayâwith
her.â

âThe American mother is an appendage,â said the
listener, ârather than a necessity.â

âThe sight of Shelmadine, who had expanded like a
balloon in the filling-shed since the happy days at
KlÃ¼mpenstein, was to Miss Van KyperâMiss Mamie
Van Kyper was her complete name,â went on the man
who had been called Bonsonââan undoubted shock.â

âOf course,â agreed the man who was being told the
story.

âThey met at the Carlton Hotel, where she had engaged
a suite of reception-rooms for the interview.â

âNot being quite certain whether one would hold
Shelmadine?â suggested the other.

âAnd the matter was thrashed out satisfactorily in
five minutes, where an English girl would have taken
five weeks. âI guess thereâs a good deal more of you
than ever either of us expected there would be,â said
Mamie; âbut Iâve got to choose between having too
much of the man I love, or nothing at all. And it seems
mighty unreasonableâwhen I felt plum-sure at KlÃ¼mpenstein
that I could never have enough of youâthat I
should be miserable here in London because there happens
to be a good deal more than there was then.â With
a gush of warm and affectionate devotion she twined
[291]

her arms as far round Shelmadine as they would go,
and he, in accepting the fate that made him the husband
of Miss Mamie Van Kyper, renounced his silhouette
for ever!â

âBut you said he got it back again!â said the second
man.

âHe has,â said the first man.

âWithout the assistance of Mariette DuchÃ¢tel, daughter
of Marius DuchÃ¢tel, herbalist, of Geneva?â queried
the second man.

âMariette,â said the first man, âon finding Shelmadine
indisposed to accept her offer, first attempted to commit
suicide in a cistern; then threw up the sponge and made
a clean breast of everything. A peculiar vegetable preparation,
the secret of which she had had from her father,
the herbalist of Geneva, administered in Shelmadineâs
food, had caused the extraordinary accumulation of adipose
tissue. The antidote, which she had promised to administer
in the intervals of her own designs on my
poor friendâs freedom, she confided to him, with bitter
tears and many entreaties for forgiveness, before she
went out of the Bond Street flat and Shelmadineâs life
for ever.â

âHe married Miss Van Kyper immediately. He has
an Assistant-Principal clerkship at the Ordnance Office;
he has recovered his silhouette, but he no longer cares
for clothes. You could scare rooks with him as he
dresses now. Fact!â

âFacts are confoundedly rummy things!â said the man
who had been told the story.

[292]

A NOCTURNE

âYOU look,â He said nastily, as She raised her disheveled

coiffure
and tear-blurred features from
the center of a large muslin-flounced and covered cushion
that sat at the end of the lounge that opened like a
box, and held frilled petticoatsââyou look like a wilted
prize chrysanthemum.â

She mechanically put up one hand to drive home deserting
hairpins into the mass of hair He had, in the
lyrical days of early passion, celebrated as Corinthian
gold-bronze, in a halting sonnet of which he was now
profoundly ashamed. Stifling the recurrent hiccough
that accompanies a liberal effusion of tears, she stared
at him blankly.

A silver timepiece, a wedding present from His
mother, who had objected to the match, struck the midnight
hour. The thin sound of the last stroke, spun into
tenuity by silence, died, and the clanking, hooting, nerve-shattering
scurry of racing motor-buses went by like a
wild hunt of iron-shackled fiends. A private car passed
with its exhaust wailing like an exiled banshee, a belated
hansom or two bowled along the sloppy asphalt,
the raucous screech of a constable-defying nymph of the
pavement rent the muggy air. He hardly heard it; he
had been agreeing with his mother ever since the clock
had struck. To-morrow he would go and look in at
000, Sloane Street, and tell her that she had always
known best. In imagination he was telling her so, when
the sable-bordered tail of a dove-colored Indian cashmere
[293]

dressing gown he had worshiped during the
honeymoon swept across the feuille-rose carpet in the
direction of the boudoir; Sada Yacco and AbÃ© San,
snub-nosed, blue-and-pink-bowed canine causes of the
conjugal quarrel, joyously yelping in its wake.

âArenât you going to bed?â He demanded.

âYou did not seem inclined to go to your dressing-room,â
She returned with point, âand as I have to write
an important letter, I may as well do it now!â

He knew that the letter would be addressed to Her
mother, who had also objected to the match, and would
contain a daughterâs testimony to the correctness of the
maternal judgment. Sada Yacco and AbÃ© San, sitting
on their haunches, with their pink tongues lolling, looked
as though they knew it too. How he loathed those
Japanese pugs! As he glared at them she gathered them
up, one under each arm, protectingly.

âDonât be afraid!â He said, with the kind of laugh
described by the popular novelist as grating; âI am not
going to murder the little brutes, after paying thirty
pounds for the pair.â This was a touch of practical
economy that made Her lip curl. âWhat I say is, I
decline to have those animals galloping over me in the
middle of the night.â

âIt is the middle of the night now,â She said, concealing
a yawn behind three fingersâhis wedding ring
and keeper upon oneââand they are not galloping over
you. Men are supposed to be more logical than women.
I have often wondered why since last May.â

âWe were married in May,â He said, folding his arms
after a method much in favor with the popular novelist
when heroes are grim.

âIt seems,â She said, rather drearily, âa long time
ago.â

[294]
âIf I had told you last May,â He retorted, âthat I
object to wake in the middle of the night with one
Japanese pug snorting upon myâahâmy chest, and
the other usurping the greater part of my pillow, you
would have sympathized with my feeling, understood
the objection, and relegated Sada Yacco and AbÃ© San
to their comfortable basket in the corner of the kitchenâor
anywhere else,â he added hurriedly, seeing thievish
early errand-boys on the tip of her tongue, âexcept your
bedroom!â

The popular novelist would have described her pose as
âsculpturesque,â her expression as âfateful,â and her
tone as âicy,â as She said:

âThe bedroom being mine, perhaps you will permit me
to remind you that you possess one of your own, and
that it is nearly one oâclock!â

It was, in fact, a quarter-past twelve. But the door
closed behind Him with such a terrific bang that the
thready little utterance of the silver timepiece was completely
unnoticed.

She put her hand to her throat, as a leading actress
invariably does in moments of great mental stress, and
uttered a choking little laugh of sorrow and bitterness.
Men were really like this, then! Fool, oh, fool, to
doubt! Had she not read, had she not seen, had not
other women whispered?... And had her mother not
plainly told her that this manânow her husband!âwas
more like other men than any of the other men resembled
others? She sobbed a few sobs, dried her eyes,
and prepared for bed. But when arrayed in white
samite, mystic and wonderful, with the traces of tears
effaced by perfumed hot water, the pinkness of nose and
eyelids ameliorated by a dab or two of powder, the
gold-brown tresses He had once sonneted, and now
[295]

sneered at, brushed out and beautiful, she took up the
double basket owned by Sada Yacco and AbÃ© San,
placed it in the boudoir, returned for the canine couple,
deposited them inside it, and then, resolutely shutting
the door of communication upon their astonished countenances,
got into bed, cast one indifferent glance at the
twin couch adjoining, shrugged her shoulders, and
switched off the light.

âSânâff!â

That was AbÃ© San snuffing inquiringly at the bottom
of the door. Sada Yacco joined him, and they snuffed
together. It was impossible to sleep, especially when
they began to discuss the situation in whimpers and
short yelps. Then they began to race round the boudoir,
barking in whimpers. Then, just as She had made up
her mind to buy peace by letting them in, there was a
sharp bark from Sada Yacco, a joyous scrape at a distant
door, and a rattling of claws as the couple, emancipated
from vile durance in the boudoir, joyously galloped
down the passage. Then sleep soporifically stole
over the senses of a wronged and brutally injured
woman. It was not chilly, sloppy December: it was
radiant July. She was not in a London flat. She was in
a well-known back-water above Goring-on-Thames,
cosy in a red-curtained punt, with a Japanese umbrella
and two Japanese pugs and a husband, very handsome,
almost quite new, madly devoted, not the quite plain,
absolutely sulky, unspeakably disagreeable He now conjecturally
snoring on the opposite side of the passage.
And so She slept and dreamed.

He was not asleep. Propped up in his own beautiful
little bed in his own cosy dressing-room, he was smoking
a long cigar, and, as a further demonstration of bachelor
independence, a brandy and Apollinaris stood untouched
[296]

beside him. By the electric light dangling over his head,
where sardonically hung suspended a wooden Cupidâha,
ha!âhe was perusing a book. She objected to reading
in bed, that was whyâha, ha! again. The thin-paper
volume, supposed to be an enlightening work on
Oval Billiards, proved, by a tricky freak of Fate, to be
an English translation of
Thus Spake Zarathustra
. This
is what he read:

âCalm is the bottom of my sea:

Who would divine that it hideth droll monsters?

Unmoved is my depth, yet it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and laughters.

An imposing One saw I to-dayâa solemn One, a penitent of the Spirit....

Should he become weary of his imposingness, this imposing one....â

There came a scratch at the bottom of the door, a
snuffling sound, and a sneeze he knew well. What did
AbÃ© San straying about draughty passages by night?
But it was no business of his. Let the beastâs owner
see to it. He read on:

âGracefulness belongeth to the generosity of the magnanimous.â

Sada Yacco had joined her lord. Together they burrowed,
mutually they snuffed. It was not to be borne.
He got up and opened the door. Sada Yacco and AbÃ©
San rushed in, their tongues lolling, their eyes bulging
with curiosity, and, after a brief excursion round the
apartment, which they found small, fawned upon him
with a sickening devotion. He scowled on the small
black-and-white silky handfuls. Then he yielded to the
impulse that plucked at his maxillary muscles and
grinned. The little brutes were so painfully sorry for
[297]

him. They were so clearly under the impression that
he was in disgrace.

He got back into bed, and lay there, grinning still, if
unwillingly. Sada Yacco, with the forwardness of her
sex, scrambled up and sat upon him. AbÃ© San scratched
at the coverlet imploringly, until, hoisted upward by the
scruff, he, too, gained the desired haven. They had
plainly come to stay, so He resigned himself with a
sigh, switched off the electric light, and fell asleep before
AbÃ© San had turned round the regulation number of
times.

Meanwhile She, wakened by the toot of a belated
motor-taxi, began to wonder whither the Japanese couple
had strayed. Urged and wearied by the unbroken silence,
she rose, arrayed herself in her dressing gown,
armed herself with a lighted wax taper in a silver
candlestickâanother wedding presentâand began a tour
of discovery. The pugs had vanished. Had the maids
yielded to their entreaties and taken them in? She
listened at two doors; the steady snoring of the sleepers
within was unmingled with snort or slumbering whimper
of Sada and her mate. Then, returning, she noticed
that His dressing-room door was open.

Taper in hand, She went in. He was sound asleep,
Sada Yacco sweetly slumbering on the surface covered
by daylight with a waistcoat, AbÃ© San curled up, a
floss-silk ball, on the pillow by his ear. If he had seen
her eyes as she bent over him, shading the light, he
would have regained his old opinion of them in the
twinkling of the tear She dropped upon His cheek.

Donât say there are no such things as guardian angels.
His woke him up just as She kissed himâthe kiss was
so light it would not have wakened him by itself.

[298]

THE LAST EXPEDITION

I

SUPPOSE that you see Captain Arthur Magellison,
late of His Majestyâs Royal Navy, with the eyes
of the writerâs remembrance, as a thick-set, fair man of
middle height, neat in appearance and alert in bearing.
His skin was a curious bleached bronze, and his wide-pupilled
pale gray eyes, netted about with close, fine
wrinkles, had looked on the awful desolation of the
Arctic until something of its loneliness and terror had
sunk into them and stamped itself upon the manâs brain,
never to be effaced, or so it seemed to me. For his wife,
once the marble Miss Dycehurst, who had not married
a semi-Celebrity for nothing, took her husband much
with her into London Society, and at gossipy dinner-tables
and in crowded drawing-rooms; on the Lawn at
Ascot and in a box on the Grand Stand at Doncaster,
as on a Henley houseboat, and during a polo tournament
at Ranelagh, I have seen Magellison, to all appearance
perfectly oblivious of the gay and giddy world about
him, sitting, or standing with folded arms and bent
head, and staring out with fixed and watchful eyes, over
Heaven knows what illimitable wastes of snow-covered
land or frozen ocean....

I have described Captain Arthur Magellison as a semi-Celebrity.
Erstwhile Commander of the Third-class Armored
Destroyer
Sidonia
, he became, after his severance
from the Royal Navy, and by reason of the adventures
and hardships by him undergone as leader of the Scottish
Alaskan Coastal Survey Expedition of 1906-1908,
[299]

something of a hero. A series of lectures, delivered at
the Edinburgh Hall of Science, in the course of which
the explorer, by verbal descriptions as well as cinematographic
effects, completely disposed of the theory regarding
the existence of a range of active volcanoes to
the north of Alaska, previously accepted by the illuminati,
made a sensation among scientists, and induced,
in the case of Sir Jedbury Fargoe, F.R.G.S., M.R.I., a
rush of blood to the cerebrum, followed by the breaking
out of a Funeral Hatchment over his front door, a procession
in slow time, with wreaths, palls, and feathers,
and a final exit
per
trolley into the Furnace at Croking
Crematorium.

The Public, never having bothered about the volcanoes,
remained unmoved by the intelligence of their
non-existence, but the Professors and the Press shed
much ink upon the subject. Upon a wave of which sable
fluid Captain Arthur Magellison was borne, if not into
the inner court, at least into the vestibule of the Temple
of Fame. Then the wave, as is the way of waves, receded;
leaving Magellison, by virtue of certain researches
and discoveries in Natural History, Botany and
Physiology, a Member of the Royal Institution, Associate
of the Zoological Society, Fellow of the Institute
of Ethnology, and the husband of the marble Miss Dycehurst.

Never was a more appropriate sobriquet bestowed.
Down in Clayshire, her native county, the statuesque
Geraldine, orphan heiress of a wealthy landholder not
remotely connected with the Brewing interests of his
native isle, dispensed, under the protective auspices of a
maternal aunt of good familyâMiss Dycehurstâs
motherâs deceased papa had wedded a portionless spinster
of noble bloodâdispensed, I say, a lavish but stony
[300]

hospitality. In London she went out a great deal, looking
like a sculptured Minerva of the GrÃ¦co-Latin school,

minus
the helmet but
plus
a tower of astonishing golden
hair, received proposals from Eligibles and Ineligibles,
petrified their makers with a single stare, and proceeded
upon her marmorean way in maiden meditation, fancy
free. Until she attended that series of lectures, delivered
at the Edinburgh Hall of Science by the eminent
Arctic Explorer, Captain Arthur Magellison.

Society in Clayshire and Society in London expressed
ardent curiosity to know how the engagement had been
brought about? All that is known for certain is, that
after the lecture, when the Explorer held a little reception
in a draughty enclosure of green baize screens, Miss
Dycehurst, looking rather like a mythical goddess of the
Polar Regions, her frosty beauty crowned with its diadem
of pale golden hair, and her fine shape revealed in
greenish-blue, icily-gleaming draperies, asked a local
magnate to present the lecturer, and met him at a public
dinner given in his honor upon the following night.
Later on in London, where the lecture was, by invitation
of the learned heads of the nation, repeated, Miss Dycehurst
with a large party occupied the second row of
stalls. Later still, Magellison dined with the heiress at
000, Chesterfield Crescent, her town address, and later
still the couple were Hanover-Squared into one flesh. It
was in May, and the sacred edifice was garlanded with
white Rambler roses and adorned with lilies and smilax
and palms. A Bishop tied the knot, and the choir rendered
the anthem with exquisite effect, as well as âFight
the Good Fightâ and âThe Voice that Breathedââ.â
And the Bride, in dead white, with a swansdown train
and a Malines veil, and ropes of pearls and brilliants,
and a crown of diamond spikes that might have been
[301]

sparkling icicles, gleaming and scintillating on the summit
of her wonderful tower of hair, looked more like the
Lady of the Eternal Snows than ever.

No one knew whether the Magellisonsâ married life
was happy or the other thing. Suffice it, as the popular
three-volume novelist used to say when not compelled to
pad, that, to all outward seeming, the couple agreed.
But I think that when the high tide of Fame receded (as
during 1909, when the thrilling adventures of the dauntless
explorer, Blank, were electrifying the newspaper-reading
world, it certainly did, leaving nothing but a
vague halo of heroism and adventure hanging about the
name of Magellison, and a sedimentary deposit of honorary
letters at the tail of it) the woman who had married
Magellison knew disillusion. As for Magellison, he
had always been a silent, absorbed and solitary man.
And that strange look in those wide-pupilled pale gray
eyes of his, the eyes of one who has lived through the
half-year-long twilight of Arctic nights, and seen the
ringed moon with her mock moons glimmer through the
ghostly frost-fog, and the pale pink curving feathers of
the Aurora Borealis stream across the ice-blue sky, and
the awful crimson of the Polar Day rush up beyond the
floe and strike the icy loneliness into new beauty and
new terrorânever changed. Perhaps, in discovering the
true nature of his Geraldine, the Explorer found himself
traversing a colder and more rugged desert than he had
encountered when he led the Scottish-Northumbrian
Polar Expedition in quest of those volcanic ranges
proved to be non-existentâin Alaska to the North.

I believe he really loved the woman he had married.
I know that, while he acted as the unpaid steward of her
estates, he spent nothing beyond his half-pay, eked out
by articles which he wrote now and then for the kind of
[302]

Scientific Review that rewards the contributor with ten
shillings per page of one thousand words,
plus
the honor
of having contributed. In his own housesâhis wifeâs, I
should sayâhe was a pathetic nonentity. At 000 Chesterfield
Crescent, and at Edengates in Clayshire, the recent
Miss Dycehurstâs country seat, he hugged his own
rooms, about which, arranged in cases and hung upon
the walls, were disposed native weapons, stuffed birds,
geological specimens, dried algÃ¦, water-color sketches,
and such trophies of the Survey Expedition as had not
been presented by Magellison to needy museums. When
his name appeared in newspaper-paragraphs as the
writer of one of the articles referred to, or as the donor
of such a gift, his wife would pluck him from his beloved
solitude, and compel him to tread the social round with
her. But as the slow years crept on, the man himself,
long before the ebbing tide of Fame left a desolate
stretch of seaweedy mud where its waters had heaved
and whispered, was so rarely seen, in his wifeâs company
or out of it, that her all-but-newest friends believed Mrs.
Arthur Magellison to be the wife of an incurable invalid,
and the most recent were convinced that she was a
widow. Proposals of marriage were sometimes made to
the lady, who by the way was handsomer and stonier
than ever, by Eligibles or Ineligibles laboring under this
conviction.

âI am extremely sensible of the honor you have done
me,â said Mrs. Magellison upon one of these occasions,
âbut as a fact, my husband is alive. Which relieves me
of the necessityâdonât you think?âof coming to a decision!â

The man who had proposed, a barely middle-aged,
extremely good-looking, well-made, well-bred Hawting-Holliday
of Hirlmere, sufficiently endowed with ancient,
[303]

if embarrassed, acres, and a sixteenth-century Baronetcy,
to have tempted the marble Geraldine, had her frosty
hand been disengaged, to its bestowal on him, was,
though impecunious enough to be strongly attracted by
the ladyâs wealth, yet honestly enamored of her sculpturesque
person. Consequently as the final syllable of the
foregoing utterance fell from the ladyâs lips, he assumed,
for a fleeting instant or so, the rosy complexion of early
adolescence, and stared upon the conquering Geraldine
with blank and circular eyes. Then he said:

âByâJove! that does let me out, doesnât it? My
dear lady, I entreat you to consider me as prostrate in
humiliation at your feet. Withââhe felt over the surface
of an admirably thought-out waistcoat for his eyeglass,
which was still in his eyeââwith sackcloth and
ashes, and all the appropriate trimmings. Let me retrieve
my character in your eyes by saying, that if itâahem!âgives
you any gratification to have a live husband
at this junctureâI will endeavor to share the sentiment.
But you really have run him as a Dark Horse,
now havenât you?â

He lifted his eyebrows in interrogation, and the eyeglass
leaped into the folds of his well-chosen cravat, the
kind of subdued yet hopeful thing in shades a man of
taste and brains would put on to propose in.

âMy dear Sir Robert,â Mrs. Magellison said, in well-chosen
language and with an icy little smile, âI am not
an adept in the use of sporting phraseology. Captain
Magellison is of studious habits, retiring nature, andâshall
I say?âan indolent disposition. It would not very
well become me if I insisted on his society when he is
not disposed to bestow it upon me, and therefore I generally
go out alone. When, unless I give a formal dinner,
upon which an occasion my husband must necessarily
[304]

take his place at the other end of the boardâwhen
I entertain intimatesâââ

âYou put your people at a round table,â said Hawting-Holliday
of Hirlmere. âAnd a round table is the very
deuceâandâall for obliterating a husband!â He found
his eyeglass and screwed it firmly in.

âI do not altogether blame the table,â said Mrs.
Magellison coldly. âBecause, upon nine occasions out
of ten my husband prefers a cutlet in his rooms. Pray
do not suppose that I find fault with the preference. He
is not by nature sociable, as I have said, and prefers to
follow, at Edengates and in Scotland and in Paris, as
well as here in town, his own peculiar bent. And what
that is you are probably aware?â She turned her head
with a superb movement, and her helmet of pale hair
gleamed in the wintry sunshine that streamed through
the lace blinds of the Chesterfield Crescent drawing-room.

âI had a general idea,â said the man she addressed,
who, hampered in early life by the fact of being born a
Hawting-Holliday of Hirlmere, had not succeeded in
being anything else, âthat the lateâI beg your pardon!âthe
present Captain Magellison wasâI should say
isâa Scientific Bufferâof sorts!â

Mrs. Magellison smiled coldly and rose.

âThe term you employ is slang, of course,â she said,
âbut it is quite appropriate and really descriptive. My
husband was once a famous man, he is now a Scientific
Bufferâand as you sayâof sorts. Would you like to
see him?â

She moved to the drawing-room door and turned her
head with another fine movement, and Hawting-Hollidayâs
eclectic taste was charmed with the sculpturesque
pose. He followed her and they crossed a landing, and
[305]

Mrs. Magellison knocked at the door of one of a suite
of rooms that had been thrown out over what had been
a back-yard. And as nobody said âCome in,â she entered,
followed by the visitor.

II

The room was long, carpeted but uncurtained, and
lighted by that most depressing of all forms of illumination,
a skylight. Dwarf bookcases ran round it, and the
walls were covered with frames and glass cases, primitive
weapons, and a multitude of quaint and curious
things. There was a low couch, covered with seal skins
and feather rugs, and a leather writing-chair was set at
the table, which had on it a fine microscope and many
scientific instruments, of which the uses were unknown
to the head of the Hawting-Hollidays of Hirlmere.
Piles of dusty papers there were, and a couple of battered
shipâs logs, stained and discolored by sea-water
and grease. And in the writing-chair, with his feet on a
magnificent Polar bear-skin and the receiver of a telephone
at his ear, sat the Scientific Buffer of sorts, staring
fixedly before him, apparently over an illimitable waste
of frozen drift-ice covering uncharted Polar seas.

âArthur!â said Mrs. Magellison, with a cold kind of
impatience, rattling the handle of the door as if to attract
his attention. He came back with a start and hung
up the receiver, and rose. He had a simple, courteous
manner that won upon the suitor who had just proposed
to his wife; and oddly enough, the appearance of a servant
with a message that summoned the lady to an interview
with her
modiste
was not greatly regretted by
Hawting-Holliday.

[306]
âI have seen you before, of course,â said his host,
making him free of a rack of Esquimaux pipes and pushing
over a jar of Navy-cut.

âHave you though?â rose to the visitorâs lips, but the
words were not allowed to escape. Looking round he
saw that there were piles of receipted accounts, and orderly
piles of tradesmenâs books upon the table with the
reams of dusty MSS., and as servants came in for orders
and went away instructed, and messages were telephoned
to various purveyors, Hawting-Holliday arrived at the
conclusion that Mrs. Magellisonâs husband was regarded
less in that capacity by Mrs. Magellison and her household
than as major-domo, head-bailiff and house-steward.

The two men chatted a little, and presently one spoke
while the other listened. The capacity for hero-worship
is quick in every generous nature, and the extravagant,
impoverished, high-bred county gentleman and man-about-town
was conscious that this modest, absent-minded
little ex-naval Commander was of the stuff that
went to build great heroes. Franklin and Nansen were
brothers to this man, and that the justly-honored names
of Shackleton and Peary, and the cognomen of Cook
(King of terminological inexactitudinarians), were hot
upon the publicâs mouths just then, mattered nothing to
Hawting-Holliday, as he heard how in the year of Our
Lord Nineteen Hundred and Six, ten men sailed from
San Francisco for Bering Sea on board a sixty-ton
schooner, to settle the question of the existence of Undiscovered
Ranges of Volcanic Origin in Alaska to the
North. And how great storms and awful blizzards hindered
the Coastal Survey Expedition, and sickness crippled
its members, yet they struggled gamely on.

[307]
âGood God!â said Hawting-Holliday, whose pipe had
long since gone out. He heard next how the Expedition
suffered the loss of their ship and all their stores, and
how their leader sent his crew home by a passing whaler
and, for the enlargement of his own experience, chose to
journey back to civilization along the Alaskan coast,
three thousand miles of solitary sledge-traveling, aided
only by the Esquimaux he chanced on in his terrible
journey. And as he went on narrating in his calm and
even voice, enforcing a point by a modest gesture of the
hand that had lost the top-joints of the first and second
fingers, and sometimes looking through and beyond the
face of the listener with those strange, sorrowful, far-away
eyes, what he related the other man saw, andââ

âGood Lord!â said Hawting-Holliday again, âwhat
an Odyssey the whole thing is! And so you got back to
Ithaca after eighteen months of tramping it on your
lonesome along a frozen coast and sleeping in holes dug
in the snow, and living on blubber and seal-meat or
boiled skin-boots when you couldnât get anything else;
and gathering knowledge and experience when there
wasnât even reindeer moss to scrape off the rocks!â He
got up and held out his hand. âAs a perfectly useless
and idle kind of beggar, I donât know that my sincere
admiration and respect are worth having, Captain, but
if they were!âââ

He gulped, and went, quite clumsily, away, but came
back again, and so a friendship grew between the âperfectly
useless and idle kind of beggar,â Hawting-Holliday,
and the hero of the three-thousand-mile tramp back
to Civilization. Perhaps Hawting-Holliday had really
never been seriously attached to the handsome piece of
statuary that bore Magellisonâs name. It is certain that
[308]

her cold neglect and open contempt of her husband
eventually kindled the wrath of Magellisonâs newly-won
champion to boiling-point. Not that the Captain gave
any perceptible sign of suffering under the icy blizzard
of his wifeâs scorn. Endurance was the lesson he had
learned best of all, and he agreed with her in regarding
himself as a Failure.

âA beautiful and gifted woman has a right to be
ambitious for the man she marries,â he said once to
Hawting-Holliday. âAnd if he has no power to keep at
high-level, if he makes no more way than a schooner
frozen in the floe, it is natural that she should feel keenly
disappointed andâand manifest the feeling by aâa certain
change of attitude as regards him.â

âThe schooner may be frozen in the floe, Captain,â
said Hawting-Holliday, lounging in the window-seat of
the Captainâs big, bare room at Edengates, that wasâonly
barring the skylightâexactly like the Captainâs
other big bare room at 000, Chesterfield Crescent. âBut
the floe is traveling all the time. Thatâs a bit of scientific
information that I got from you. And I rather
pride myself on applying it neatly.â

The Captain looked hard at him, and Hawting-Holliday
noticed for the first time that the curly fair hair
that topped the deep-lined pale-bronze face was growing
white. Then Magellison said, with a queer smile:

âYou have found me out, I see! And yet I thought I
had kept the secretâor rather, the arrangement, quite
closely. But on the whole Iâm rather glad you guessed.
For I like you, young manââHawting-Holliday was at
least thirty-fiveââand I shall give you the parting
hand-shake with sincere regretâwith very sincere regret,
when the ice breaks up and the little engine helps
the hoisted sails, and the floe-bound vessel that never
[309]

really stopped, although her journey was only of inches
in the monthâmoves on not North but South, along the
thawed and open sea-lanesâââ

He stopped, for Hawting-Holliday dropped his pipe
and got off the window-seat, and caught the maimed
right hand and wrung it until its owner winced.

âYou gave me credit for too much perspicuity, Captain.
I hadnât seen as much as the catâs tail until you
let her out of the bag. Where are you going, man, and
when do you go?â

Briefly, Magellison told him.

âAll right, Captain,â said Hawting-Holliday. âYouâre
going to take charge of the Steam and Sail Antarctic
Geological Research Expedition, financed by the Swedish
Government, sailing from Plymouth for King Edward
Land in April, so as to get the summer months of December,
January, and February for exploration, botanizing,
deep-sea-dredging, and scientific observations.
You calculate on being away not quite three years.
Very well, but remember this! If you donât turn up in
three yearsâ time and no definite news has reached us as
to your whereabouts, the most useless and idle dog of
my acquaintanceâand thatâs myselfâwill take the liberty
to come and look for you. I swear itâby the Great
Barrier and the Blue Antarctic Ooze!â

They shook hands upon it, laughing at the humorous
idea of the Captainâs not coming back, and a little later
the news of her husbandâs impending departure was imparted,

per
the medium of the Press, to the marmorean
lady to whom the explorer had frozen himself some few
years previously. She was radiant with smiles at the
revival of newspaper interest in Magellison, and postponed
her spring visit to the Riviera for the purpose of
giving a series of Departure Dinners in honor of the
[310]

Captain. All the leading scientific lights of the day
twinkled in turn about the board. And Geraldine wore
all her diamonds, and was exceedingly gracious to her
Distinguished Man. She saw him off from Plymouth,
one balmy April day, and shed a few discreet tears in a
minute and filmy pocket handkerchief as the Swedish
oak-built, schooner-rigged steamship-sailer
Selma
ran up
the Swedish colors and curtsied adieu to English waters
at the outset of the long South Atlantic voyage, and the
petrol steam-launch containing the friends and relatives
of the Expedition rocked in her wake, and the red-eyed
people crowding on the oily-smelling little vesselâs decks
raised a quavering farewell cheer. Two men stood together
at the
Selmaâs
after-rail: a short, square man of
muscular build, with a slight stoop that told of scholarly
habits, and thick, fair hair, streaked with white, and a
deeply-lined, clean-shaven face, with pale, far-seeing
eyes that were set in a network of fine wrinkles. The
other man was Hawting-Holliday, who had announced
his intention, at the last minute, of accompanying the
Expedition as far as Madeira for the sake of the sea-blow.

âTell Geraldine I shall mail home from the Cape and
Melbourne,â the leader of the Expedition said, three
days later, as the boat that was to convey Hawting-Holliday
ashore bobbed under the
Selmaâs
side-ladder in
a clamoring rout of tradesmenâs luggers and Funchal
market-flats. âTell her I shall certainly communicate
from Lyttelton, and after that she must trust to luck
and homeward-bound whalers for news of me.â He
wrung Hawting-Hollidayâs hand, and added, âAnd in
caseâanything should happen to meânot that such a
chance is worth speaking of!âI know that I can rely
upon you to act towards myâmy dear girl as a friend!â
[311]

The Captainâs voice shook a little, and a mist was over
those clear, wide-pupilled, far-away-gazing gray eyes.

âI promise you that, faithfully,â said Hawting-Holliday,
and gripped the maimed right hand of the man he
loved as a brother, and went down over the side of the

Selma
with a sore heart.

That was in April, 1910, and news of the loss of the

Selma
, in the ice of the Antarctic Circle was cabled from
Honolulu at the beginning of last month. An American
Antarctic Expedition, having concluded a mission of exploration
in the summer season of 1910, finding upon the
coast of King Edward Land the few survivors of the
Swedish Steam and Sail Antarctic Research Expedition
making preparations to winter in a wooden hut built out
of the wreckage of their teak-built sailing-steamerârescued
and carried them on their homeward route. The
saved men, later interviewed at San Francisco, were
unable to give news of their leader, save that the Captain,
taking a dog-sledge and a little stock of provisions
and instruments, and a hearty leave of all of them,
turned that lined bronze face of his and those eyes with
the far-away look in their wide pupils, to the dim, mysterious,
uncharted regions lying South, in the lap of the
mysterious Unknown, and with a wave of a fur-gloved
hand, was lost in them.

âHe is dead, Arthur is dead!â moaned Geraldine
Magellison, in the depths of conjugal anguish and a lace-covered
sofa-cushion, when the Press and Hawting-Holliday
broke the news between them. âDead!âand I
loved him soâI loved him so!â

âIt is a pity, under the circumstances,â said Hawting-Holliday,
carrying out his promise of being a friend to
Magellisonâs wife by telling that wife the truth, âthat
[312]

you were so economical in your expressions of affection.
For I do not think that when the Captain left you he
had any remaining illusions as to the nature of your
regard for him.â

âHow cruel you areâhow cruel!â gasped Geraldine,
as her maid bore in a salver piled with the regrets of
Learned Societies and the sympathy of distinguished
Personages and private friends.

âLet me for once use the trite and hackneyed saying
that I am cruel only to be kind!â said Hawting-Holliday,
emphatically, âand that I speak solely in the interests
ofâa friend whom I love.â

Mrs. Magellison flushed to the roots of her superb
golden hair, and consciously drooped her scarcely-reddened
eyelids as she held up a protesting hand.

âNo, no, Sir Robert!â she pleaded. âIf Iâas you
inferâhave gravely erred in lack of warmth toward
poor, poor, dearest Arthur! let me at least be ungrudging
in respect of his great memory. Forget what you have
said, carried away by a feeling which in honor you subdued
after the rude awakening of many months ago, and
do not revert toâthe subject forâfor
at least
a year to
come!â

At that Hawting-Holliday got upon his legs, and
thrusting his hands deep into his trouser-pockets, made
the one and only harangue of his existence.

âMrs. Magellison, when you suggest that in the very
hour when the intelligence of grave disaster to your husbandâs
vessel has reached us, I am capable of addressing
you in what the poetic faculty termâHeaven knows how
idiotically and falsely!âthe language of love,
you

gravely err. The friend in whose interests I spoke just
now, wasâyour husband.
Is
your husbandâfor I do
not accept by any means the theory that because he has
[313]

been lost sight of, he is dead. I believe him to be living.
I shall go on believing this until I see his body, or meet
with some relics of him that supply meâhis friend!âwith
the evidence that you, his wife, are so uncommonly
ready to dispense with.â

His eyes burned her with their contempt. She gasped:

âYouâyou mean that you are going South to try and
find him?â

âYou comprehend my meaning perfectly,â said Hawting-Holliday,
and bowed to Mrs. Magellison with ironical
deference and left her.

He was, though not a wealthy man, far from being a
poor one. He chartered a stout vessel that was lying in
Liverpool Docks, the Iceland Coast Survey Companyâs
steam-and-sail schooner
Snowbird
, and equipped and
provisioned and manned her with a speed and thoroughness
that are seldom found in combination. The
Snowbirdâs

own skipper goes in charge of his ship, but Hawting-Holliday
is the Leader of the Expedition.

And yesterday the
Snowbird
sailed, in search of that
man who has been swallowed up by the great Conjecture.
And of this I am sure, that whether Hawting-Holliday
succeeds or fails, lives or dies, he will grasp the hand of
his friend again Somewhere. Either upon this side of
the Great Gray Veil that hangs in the doorway of the
Smoky House, or upon the other....

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility:
www.gutenberg.org
.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

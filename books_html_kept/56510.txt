SLICKO,

THE JUMPING SQUIRREL

CHAPTER I

SLICKO LEARNS TO JUMP

Half way up the side of a tall tree there
was a round hole in the trunk. The
hole was lined with soft, dried leaves,
and bits of white, fluffy cotton, from the milkweed
plant. And, if you looked very carefully
at the hole, you might see, peering from it, a
little head, like that of a very small kitten, and
a pair of very bright eyes.

But it was not a kitten that looked from the
little hole in the trunk of the tree. Kitties can
climb trees, but they do not like to live in them.
They would rather have a warm place behind
the stove, with a nice saucer of milk.

Now if I tell you that the little creatures who
lived in this hole-nest had big, fluffy tails, and
that they could sit up on their hind legs, and eat
nuts, I am sure you can guess what they were.

Squirrels! Thatâs it! In the nest, half way
[8]

up the big tree in the woods, lived a family of
gray squirrels, and I am going to tell you about
them, or, rather, more particularly, about one
of the little girl squirrels whose name was Slicko.

One morning Mrs. Squirrel, who had gotten
up out of the nest early, to go out and get some
breakfast for her little ones, came back very
quickly, jumping from one tree branch to another,
and fairly scrambling down into the nest
where the little boy and girl squirrels of her
family were still asleep.

âWhy, whatâs the matter, Mother?â asked Mr.
Squirrel, in the queer, chattering language he
and his wife used. âWhy are you in such a
hurry this morning? See, you have dropped a
lot of nuts!â

He looked out over the edge of the nest, down
to the ground, where he saw some of the nuts
Mrs. Squirrel had dropped. She had been
bringing them home for breakfast.

âWhat made you run so?â asked Mr. Squirrel,
who had stayed home with the little ones,
while his wife went after nuts.

âWell, I guess youâd have hurried too,â said
the mamma squirrel, âif you saw what I saw!â

âWhat was it?â asked Mr. Squirrel, and he
pulled his head in from the nest-hole, so that if
any bad animals were down below on the ground
they could not see him.

[9]

âIt was a man, with a dog and a gun,â said
Mrs. Squirrel. âHe was out hunting, and Iâm
almost sure he saw me!â

âMy, that would be too bad!â exclaimed Mr.
Squirrel. âDo you think he followed you to
shoot you?â

âI hope not,â said Mrs. Squirrel. âI ran as
fast as I could when I saw him, and I did not
hear his gun go off, but I did hear the dog bark.â

âHum!â said Mr. Squirrel, in his own language,
and he seemed as worried as your papa
might be if he heard there was a bad animal, or
a runaway horse, coming after you. âSo the
hunter did not shoot his gun, eh?â

âNot that I heard,â answered Mrs. Squirrel.
âBut he may be trying to find this nest.â

âIâll look out and see if he is coming,â said
Mr. Squirrel.

âBe careful he doesnât see you,â said Mrs.
Squirrel.

âI will,â replied her husband. And then he
carefully, carefully peeked out of the hole of
the nest in the hollow trunk of the tree. Squirrels
are smarter than we think. Though they
do not know how to shoot a gun, they know that
a gun can hurt them, and when one is shot off in
the woods, all the squirrels, and the birds and
wild creatures, are very much frightened, and
run to hide.

[10]

So Mr. Squirrel looked out to see if he could
see a man with a gun and a dog. But he saw
nothing, and he was glad of it.

âI guess he didnât see which way you went,
Mamma,â he said to his wife. âNow we will
give the children their breakfast, and then we
must begin teaching them their lessons. For if
hunters, with dogs and guns, are to come to our
woods, it is time our little ones knew how to look
after themselves, and how to hide, and jump to
safe places.â

âI think so, too,â said Mrs. Squirrel. âWake
up, children!â she cried. âCome, Slicko!
Hurry up, Chatter! Come, Fluffy and Nutto!
Breakfast is ready!â

Four little squirrelsâtwo boys and two girlsâawoke
in the tree-nest and sat up on their hind
legs in the soft leaves and cotton. They saw the
nuts their mother had brought, and at once began
eating them. That was all they had to do
to get ready for breakfast.

The squirrel children did not have to dress,
for they wore their fur suits all the year âround,
never taking them off. In winter their fur
grew much thicker than in summer, to keep
them warmer.

The squirrel children did not have to wash
themselves in a basin. All any of them did was
to wet one paw with his little red tongue, and
[11]

wipe it over his face. Then he was washed.
But you wouldnât like to do that, Iâm sure.

âCome, children, eat your breakfasts,â said
Mrs. Squirrel, âand then you are going to have
a new lesson.â

âA new lesson!â chattered Slicko, one of the
girl squirrels, to her mamma, speaking in a language
that you or I could not have understood.
âWhat kind of a lesson is it going to be?â

You see the squirrel children had been taught
how to gnaw open hard nuts, and to take out the
sweet, juicy kernels inside. They had been
taught how to climb trees, and wash their faces.
But there were many other things for them to
learn. Slicko was the largest of the squirrel
children, and she asked the most questions.

âWhat is your lesson going to be, Mother?â
Slicko wanted to know.

âI hope itâs going to be a sleeping lesson,â
said Fluffy, one of the boy squirrels. âIâm
sleepy yet,â and he yawned and stretched himself,
just like a little monkey.

âOh, fie on you!â said his papa. âSquirrels
should be lively, and hop about when they awake
in the morning. Come now, if you have finished
your nuts, your mamma and I will teach
you a new lesson, and one that you must learn
well, or there may be danger for you.â

âPooh, Iâm not afraid! What sort of danger?â
[12]

asked Nutto, the other boy squirrel. He
was called Nutto because he was so fond of eating
chestnuts.

âOh, Iâm afraid,â said Chatter, the littlest girl
squirrel. âDonât say such scary things, Nutto,â
and Chatter looked over the edge of the nest
as though she might see a big hawk-bird swooping
down, for her papa and mamma had told
her to always hide when a big hawk flew
over the woods. But no hawk was in sight,
now.

âYou are going to have some jumping lessons,â
went on Mr. Squirrel. âAfter you learn
to jump, I will tell you why.â

You see the papa squirrel did not want just
then to tell the little ones about their mamma
having seen a hunter-man, with a dog and gun,
for fear, if he did, they might be too frightened
to come out of the nest and learn to jump. But
Mr. Squirrel knew there was no danger near,
just then, at any rate, and he wanted his children
to be as brave as they could be.

Soon, after the breakfast nuts were eaten, the
four little squirrels went out on a straight branch,
that stuck out from the tree trunk near the nest.
Papa and Mamma Squirrel stood there with
them.

âNow this is the idea,â said Mr. Squirrel, in
his chattering language, that you or I could not
[13]

have understood, but which was as plain to the
little squirrels, as a papa dogâs language is to
a puppy, or a mamma catâs mewing to her little
kittens. âYou are all going to learn to jump,â
said Mr. Squirrel.

âWhatâs a jump?â asked Slicko, who, as I
have said, was always asking questions. She
asked more questions than her two brothers and
her sister together. But Slicko wanted to know
about things.

âSee!â exclaimed Mr. Squirrel. âThis is a
jump. Now I am on this limb beside you.
Now watch!â

He gave a little spring, or jump, through the
air, and landed on the branch of another tree,
some distance off.

âThat is a jump,â said Mr. Squirrel. âIt is
getting from one branch to another without running
or walking. It is a quick way of walking,
I suppose you could call it, and when you are
in a hurry, as when some one is chasing you,
and you have no time to run or walk, you must
jump. Now let me see you jump down here,
just as I did. Come on, all of you!â

âYes, go on!â said Mamma Squirrel, who was
still on the tree limb by the nest. âYou little
squirrels must learn to jump. That is the one,
big lesson left for you to learn.â

Slicko looked at Chatter. Fluffy looked at
[14]

Nutto. Then they all looked down at their
papa on the lower limb.

âCome on! Donât be afraid!â called Mr.
Squirrel. âJump! You wonât be hurt!â

âButâbut Iâm afraid,â said Nutto, who, you
remember, had said he was not at all frightened.

âOh, you mustnât be afraid,â said Mr. Squirrel.
âThere is nothing to hurt you. Iâm sure
you can jump if you try. Give a good, hard
spring, and youâll land down here on the limb
beside me. Besides, if you do fall, the ground
is covered with soft leaves, and you wonât be
hurt. Come on. Jump!â

But the little squirrels did not want to.

âYou go first,â said Nutto to Fluffy.

âNo, Iâd rather watch you go first,â spoke
Fluffy.

âMaybe Chatter will go,â suggested Nutto.
âThe girls are not as heavy as we are, and they
wonât be hurt if they fall.â

âOne of you boys ought to go first,â said
Slicko. âYou are always saying youâre not
afraid. You jump first, Nutto, and Chatter and
I will come after you.â

âOh, I donât want to,â said Nutto.

And there the four little squirrels stood on the
limb near the nest, each one afraid to jump.
Their papa stood waiting for them, and he kept
thinking that if the hunter and his dog should
[15]

come along then, the little squirrels would be
in danger of being shot, if they did not know how
to jump out of the way, and hide.

âCome on. You must learn to jump!â called
Mrs. Squirrel.

Slicko took a long breath. After all, though
she did ask a number of questions, Slicko was
rather brave.

âIâm going to jump,â she said.

âThatâs the girl!â cried her father. âCome
on; jump down here beside me!â

Slicko moved over close to the edge of the tree
branch. Then, with another long breath, such
as a boy takes before he dives, when he is in
swimming, Slicko jumped from the tree branch.

She found herself sailing through the air. At
first she was greatly frightened. She spread out
her tail, and then she found that she was floating
through the air almost as gently as a birdâs
feather. Her tail helped her to fall gently, for
it was just like a big, open umbrella, and held
her up, as the parachute holds up the man who
jumps from a balloon.

âThere goes Slicko!â cried her mamma.
âSlicko is learning to jump!â

Down, down, down through the air went
Slicko, the jumping squirrel. Would she land
on the tree branch beside her father? Slicko
certainly hoped so, but still it was her first jump.

[16]

CHAPTER II

SLICKO MEETS SQUINTY

âThatâs the way to do it!â cried Mrs.
Squirrel, as she saw Slicko sailing
down through the air toward the
limb on which was perched Mr. Squirrel.

âDonât be afraid. Youâll get down all right!â
called Mr. Squirrel.

Slicko fluffed out her tail as wide as she could.
She felt that it was her tail which would save
her from landing too hard and hurting her paws.
Nearer and nearer she came to the limb on which
was her papa.

âHere you are!â cried Mr. Squirrel, a moment
later, and with a little shaking up, Slicko found
herself safely beside her dear papa.

âWasnât that nice?â asked Mr. Squirrel, moving
over close beside his little girl.

âOh, indeed it was,â said Slicko, breathing a
little faster than usual, for this was her first
jump, you see.

âNow, Chatter, Fluffy and Nutto! Itâs your
turns!â said Mrs. Squirrel. âSee, Slicko made
[17]

a good jump, and you can each do the same.
Come on.â

âYes, do!â said Mr. Squirrel. âYou really
must learn to jump, and then Iâll tell you why.â

âOh, is it a secret?â asked Chatter, the other
little girl squirrel. She was a sister to Slicko.

âYes, itâs a secret,â answered Mrs. Squirrel.

Now I am not quite sure about it, but I suppose
girl squirrels want to hear a secret just as
much as real girls do, and I have always found
that if you wanted to get a real little girl to do
anything for you, that she would do it ever so
much more quickly, if she thought there was a
secret about it.

Perhaps that is why Chatter made up her mind
to jump as Slicko had done. Mind, I am not
saying for sure, for I donât know. But maybe
it was so.

Anyhow, Chatter moved over close to the edge
of the tree limb. She looked down to where
her papa and Slicko sat up on their hind legs,
watching her.

âHere I come! Catch me!â spoke Chatter.

âAll rightâdonât be afraid,â answered her
papa. âYou wonât fall.â

Chatter gave a jump, and down she went.
Almost before she knew it, she had landed on a
smooth place on the limb, close beside her sister
and papa.

[18]

âThere! I did it!â cried Chatter, in delight.

âOf course you did!â said Slicko. âWasnât it
fine?â

âIt certainly was,â agreed Chatter.

âCome now! The girls have jumped, and you
boys mustnât let them get ahead of you!â called
Mr. Squirrel, to Nutto and Fluffy. âCome on,
jump down here.â

Well, of course the boy squirrels werenât going
to let the girl squirrels beat them, so first Nutto
jumped, and then Fluffy.

âThere, now you have all learned to jump,â
said Mrs. Squirrel. âOf course this is only the
beginning. You must practice every day, just
as you did when you were learning to climb
trees, by sticking your sharp toe-nails in the soft
bark. Every day you do a little jumping.â

âBut why, Mamma?â asked Slicko. âIs that
the secret?â

âThat is the secret,â answered Mr. Squirrel.
âYou must learn to jump because your mamma
saw a hunter-man, with a gun and dog in our
woods this morning, and we must be ready to
run away, and hide, if he should find our nest.

âAnd, as you cannot always run or walk, and
climb trees, you must need to know how to jump,
so you can jump out of danger. That is why we
gave you jumping lessons to-day. Now, when
you are rested, you must jump some more. And
[19]

you must learn to jump up as well as jump down,
though jumping down is easier.â

The squirrel children asked many questions
about the hunter-man, with his dog and gun, and
Papa and Mamma Squirrel told their little ones
all they knew, warning them always to hide when
they saw a man with a gun.

âWell, Iâm going to learn to jump farther and
higher,â said Slicko. âNo hunter is going to
catch me, if I can help it.â

So Slicko began practicing jumping, going
from one tree branch to another, up and down,
and sideways. The papa and mamma squirrel
watched on all sides while their children were
jumping, to make sure the hunter-man did not
come.

Whether it was because Slicko was larger and
stronger than her brothers and sister, or because
she practiced harder, I do not know. But it is
certain that, in a few days, Slicko was the best
jumping squirrel in that part of the woods. She
could jump farther than could Chatter, and even
though Nutto and Fluffy were boy squirrels,
Slicko could beat them.

âYes, Slicko is certainly a fine jumper,â said
Mrs. Squirrel, to her husband one day. âShe
can jump almost as far as we can.â

âWell, I hope she is careful,â spoke Mr.
Squirrel. âI was over near the swamp, to-day,
[20]

looking to see if I could find any sweetflag root
for supper, and I heard a noise like a gun. That
hunter-man is still in the woods.â

âMaybe it was thunder you heard,â said Mrs.
Squirrel.

âNo, Iâm sure it was the gun of the hunter-man,â
went on her husband. âWell, I am glad
the little ones can jump. It will help them to
keep out of his way.â

âIndeed it will,â said Mrs. Squirrel.

For a week or so after this, the little squirrels
practiced jumping every day. As soon as they
had had their breakfast of nuts, or oats or wheat,
which their papa or mamma brought in from
the farmerâs fields, the little squirrels would begin
jumping.

Sometimes they would run up and down the
tree trunks, and again they would pretend to
hide under the leaves, for their parents had told
them that was a good way to keep out of sight
when there was any danger in the forest.

The Squirrel family lived in the woods, a very
nice woods indeed; with many green trees growing
in it. The ground in some places was covered
with brown leaves, that had fallen off the
trees, and in other places there was soft green
moss, like the velvet carpet in the parlor at your
house.

And, not far from the tree where Slicko and
[21]

the other squirrels lived, was a pretty brook that
ran through the wood, making nice music as it
trickled over the stones. The water was cool,
and good to drink, and often Slicko, and her
brothers and sister, would come to the edge of
the brook to bathe, or get a drink.

One day, after she had practiced her jumping
lesson for some time, Slicko said to her sister,
Chatter:

âCome on, letâs take a little walk in the woods.
It is nearly time for chestnuts to be ripe, and we
may find some.â

âOh, I donât want to go,â Chatter said. âI
am tired from having jumped so much. I am
going to lie down on the green moss, and go to
sleep.â

âOh, then will you come, Nutto?â asked
Slicko, of her brother.

âNo, for Fluffy and I are going to hunt hickory
nuts,â said the boy squirrel. âYou had
better come with us. Chestnuts are not ripe yet.
You wonât find any. But, if you come with us,
youâll find some hickory nuts.â

âOh, I think I can find some chestnuts,â spoke
Slicko, and then, as neither her brothers nor her
sister would come with her, the little girl jumping
squirrel started off in the woods by herself.

She ran along on the ground a little way.
Then she climbed up a tree, and running out on
[22]

a branch of that, she leaped from the end of it
to the end of another branch, in a tree a little
farther on. Slicko was a good jumper.

In this way she hurried on until she was quite
a way from her home-nest.

All of a sudden, Slicko heard a noise in the
bushes, as if some big animal were breaking a
way through them.

âMy! I hope that isnât the hunter-man and
his dog!â exclaimed Slicko in a whisper to herself.
âI had better be careful, and take a look
before I go on any farther.â

So the little jumping squirrel cuddled down
under some leaves on the tree branch where she
was sitting, and peered out. At first she could
see nothing, except the bushes below her waving
as something pushed through them. Whatever
it was, it seemed to be coming nearer and nearer
her tree.

Slicko felt sure it was the hunter-man, and she
was getting ready to give a big jump, and hurry
home to the nest, when, all at once, she saw something
sort of pink and white come out of the
bush. As soon as Slicko saw this, she knew it
was not a hunter-man, for it walked on four
feet, whereas a hunter walks on two feet.

âWhy, itâs a little pig!â exclaimed Slicko,
looking down. She knew it was a pig, because,
not far from the woods where she lived, there
[23]

was a farm, and on the farm was a pen of pigs.
Slicko had seen them once.

âYes, thatâs a pig! Iâm not afraid of him,â
said the little squirrel girl. âHello!â she called
down to the pig, who was rooting along in the
ground, looking for something to eat, I suppose.

âHello!â called Slicko. âWhatâs your
name?â

âOh, hello! How you frightened me, calling
that way!â answered the pig. âMy name is
Squinty. Whatâs yours?â

Now if you had been listening to this talk between
the two animalsâthe squirrel and the
pigâall you would have heard would have been
something like this:

âChatter! Chat! Chat! Chit! Chit! Chirp!
Chir-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!â

And then:

âUff! Uff! Wuff! Wuff! Ugh! Ugh!â

One was the squirrel talking, and the other
was the pig answering.

Of course it would not sound like real talk,
such as you use, but it was real enough for Slicko
and Squinty, and they could understand each
other very well. They could also understand
man-talk, your talk, also, as I will tell you a little
later. But neither Slicko nor Squinty could
speak man-language.

âHa! So your name is Squinty, eh?â asked
[24]

Slicko, of the little pig. âWhy are you called
such a funny name?â

âBecause one of my eyes squints a little,â was
the answer. âSee!â Squinty looked up to show
Slicko, and the little pig was such a funny picture,
as he stood there, with one eye partly shut,
and the other wide open, with his head on one
side, and one ear cocked forward and the other
backward, he was so funny, I say, that Slicko
could not help laughing.

âHuh! What are you laughing at?â asked
Squinty, in his funny grunting voice, with his
little flat, rubbery nose wiggling sideways, and
also up and down.

âI am laughing at you,â answered Slicko.
âExcuse me, but I canât help it. You are so
funny, and you have such a funny name.â

âOh, I donât mind being laughed at,â said
Squinty, with a sort of pig-laugh. âI am glad
if you want to laugh, for it is better to laugh
than cry. And I donât mind my funny name,â
he said. I think that was very nice of Squinty
to say, donât you?

âI am glad I met you,â said the little girl
squirrel. âAt first I thought you were a hunter
in the bushes.â

âAnd I thought you were some one chasing
me, when you called that way,â said Squinty.
âBut you havenât told me your name yet.â

[25]

Then Slicko led the little pig to where there were some
acorn nuts, and Squinty ate them.

[26-
27]

âI am Slicko, the jumping squirrel,â was the
answer, âand I am hunting in these woods for
some chestnuts. What are you doing here?â

âI am here because I have run away,â said
Squinty. âI am looking for something to eat.
Are hickory nuts good?â

âVery good,â Slicko answered. âIâll see if
I can find some for each of us.â

The little squirrel found some hickory nuts,
but they were so hard that Squinty, the comical
pig, could not eat them.

âI guess youâd like some acorns, they are
softer,â Slicko said.

âIndeed I would, thank you,â spoke Squinty.

Then Slicko led the little pig to where there
were some acorn nuts, and Squinty ate them.

Very glad he was to get them, too, for he was
quite hungry.

âWhy are you called Slicko?â asked Squinty,
when he did not feel quite so hungry as at first.

âMy mamma called me that,â answered the
little squirrel, âbecause my fur is so slick and
shiny.â

âIt is a good name,â said Squinty. âDonât
you want to travel along with me, through the
woods, and have adventures?â

âThank you, no. I guess not,â replied Slicko.
âHark! Whatâs that?â

They both listened, and heard a sound like:

[28]

âChatter! Chatter! Chat! Chit! Chat!
Chir-r-r-r-r-r!â

âWhat is it?â asked Squinty, in a whisper.

âThat is my mamma calling me,â answered
Slicko. âI must go back to the nest now. Good-bye,
funny little pig.â

âGood-bye,â answered Squinty, and he went
on, looking for adventures. He had many of
them, and I have told you about them in the first
of these books, called âSquinty, the Comical
Pig.â He was bought by a boy, taught to do
many tricks, and finally ran back again to his
home in the pen on the farm.

After Slicko had said good-bye to Squinty, the
comical pig, the little girl squirrel ran and
jumped on through the woods, for her mother
kept calling to her to come to the nest.

âMy, I hope nothing has happened,â said
Slicko, as she hurried on. âAnd I didnât find
any chestnuts,â she said, as she looked at the few
hickory nuts she was bringing home. âFluffy
and Nutto will laugh at me. But I donât care.â

Pretty soon Slicko reached the nest.

âMy! Where have you been?â asked her
mamma.

âLooking for chestnuts,â answered Slicko.

âDid you find any?â asked Nutto, as he and
his brother came climbing up the tree just then.

âNo, but I found some hickory nuts, and some
[29]

acorns, and I gave some acorns to a cute little
pig,â said Slicko, explaining how she had met
Squinty.

âI wish we had gone with you,â said Fluffy.
âIâd like to have seen that pig. Come on, Nutto.
Letâs go out and see if we can find him in the
woods.â

âNo, you must not go away!â chattered Mrs.
Squirrel. âI want you all to stay here. Something
has happened, and we shall have to go
away from our nice nest.â

âGo away from our nest!â cried Slicko, in surprise.

âYes,â answered Mrs. Squirrel. âIt is no
longer safe to stay here. But here comes your
papa. He will tell you all about it. We are
in great danger, and that is why I called you all
back. Now listen to what your papa has to say.â

[30]

CHAPTER III

SLICKO GOES ON A VISIT

Mr. Squirrel came along, hurrying
and jumping through the leafy
branches of the trees as fast as he could
come. When he was still some distance away
from the nest, he took a long jump, and landed
on the limb near the hole in the tree.

âDid you see him?â asked Mrs. Squirrel.

âYes. He is in the woods,â chattered Mr.
Squirrel. âBut he may not be here for some
minutes. We have time to run and hide. And
we had better not keep together. We must all
go different ways, and then he will not find us
so easily.â

âOh, what is it?â cried Slicko. âWhat has
happened?â

âThe hunter-man, and his dog, have found
out where our nest is,â said Mrs. Squirrel. âAt
any minute he may come here to shoot us, or
catch us.â

âOh, how dreadful!â cried Chatter, and even
Nutto, who was supposed to be very brave, for
a squirrel, looked frightened.

[31]

âBut donât worry too much,â said Mr. Squirrel.
âI have seen the hunter in timeâhim and
his dog and gunâand we will get safely away
from him. Come now, we will separate, each
going a different way; then the hunter will not
find us, I hope.â

âBut where shall we go?â asked Slicko. âAnd
what shall we do for something to eat, and a
place to sleep nights, if we go away from our
home-nest?â

âWell, you squirrels are old enough now, to
hunt food for yourselves,â said Mrs. Squirrel.
âI am glad of that, for I shall not worry so
much about you. And you know how to run
and jump.â

âI am glad we learned how to jump in time,â
said Slicko.

âYes, if you had waited, and kept on putting
it off,â said Mr. Squirrel, âyou would not now
be ready to run and hide away from the hunter,
and be able to take care of yourselves. As for
a place to sleep, your mother and I are going
to send you all on visits to our friends, or relations.
You can stay with them for a while,
until it will be safe for us all to come back to our
nest again.â

âOh, then we are going on a visit!â exclaimed
Slicko.

âSomething like that, yes,â answered her
[32]

father. âAnd we must hurry, too, for the hunter
may be here any minute. I passed him in
the woods, and he was coming this way.â

âDid he see you, Papa?â asked Nutto.

âNo, for I kept well behind the leaves, and
hurried on. My! how that dog did bark,
though. He seemed very savage.â

âSquinty, the comical pig, told me of a dog he
knew,â said Slicko, âbut he said that dog was
kind and gentle. His name is Don.â

âThis dogâs name wasnât Don, Iâm sure of
that,â spoke Mr. Squirrel. âBut we must not
stay talking here. Scatter, every one of you!
Nutto and Fluffy, you go over to Grandpa
Beechnutâs nest, and stay with him. I donât believe
the hunter knows where that is.

âChatter, you can stay with Mr. and Mrs.
Acorn, the squirrels who live in the hollow
stump. Your mother and I will go off in the
woods, and make a new nest, so if we can not
come back to our old one, we will still have a
home when winter comes.â

âBut what am I to do?â asked Slicko.
âWhere am I to go?â

âI have not forgotten you,â said Mrs. Squirrel.
âYou can go over and stay with your Aunt
Whitey until it is safe. Your aunt will be glad
to have you, for she lives all alone, and she has
room for only one small squirrel in her nest beside
[33]

herself. You run over there, and tell her
all that has happenedâhow the hunter has found
our nest.â

âAnd go quickly!â suddenly cried Mr. Squirrel.
âHere the hunter-man comes nowâwith
his dog.â

Just then there sounded through the woods:

âBow wow! Bow wow! Bow wow!â

âThatâs the dog,â said Mr. Squirrel. âHurry,
children, and donât forget the lessons we have
taught you.â

âWe wonât!â promised Slicko.

Then came another sound, a dreadful noise,
like thunder.

âBang!â sounded through the woods, making
the leaves on the trees shake.

âThatâs the hunterâs gun!â exclaimed Nutto.
âRun, everybody!â

Off through the woods scampered Slicko, her
father and mother and her brothers and sister.
Slicko climbed up one tree, jumped into another,
and still another.

âI donât believe the hunter and his dog will
get me,â thought Slicko, as she hurried on toward
the nest where her Aunt Whitey lived.

Pretty soon the hunter-man and his dog came
to the foot of the tree where Slicko used to live.

âHa! Thereâs that squirrel nest I saw the
other day,â said the man to himself. âI wonder
[34]

if there are any in it? Iâll wait a while, and
see if I can shoot any of them for my dinner.â

âBow wow! Bow wow!â barked the dog.
Perhaps he, too, wanted some squirrels for his
dinner.

All around the foot of the tree ran the dog,
barking as loudly as he could. Maybe he was
hoping he could scare the squirrels out of the
nest so his master could shoot them with his
gun.

The man waited and waited, looking up at
the hole in the trunk of the tree, where he knew
the squirrels had lived. But he did not know
they had gone. That was the time the squirrels
were smarter than the hunter.

Several hours passed, and still the man waited.
Every now and then he would look up at the
hole, with his gun all ready to shoot, and the
dog, who had been running off in the woods,
looking for more squirrels, would come back,
barking louder than ever.

âWell, I guess those squirrels have gone
away, Carlo,â the man finally said to his dog.
âIt is of no use for us to stay here. Come, we
will go look for other squirrels to shoot.â

âBow wow! Bow wow! That will be fun!â
barked Carlo. Of course being a dog, he did
not know any better.

And so the hunter-man went away from the
[35]

empty nest, where Slicko and the other squirrels
had lived.

All this while Slicko, the jumping squirrel,
was hurrying along through the woods, toward
the nest of her Aunt Whitey. Slickoâs aunt had
that name because there was a white spot on the
end of her tail. Mrs. Whitey and Mrs. Squirrel
were sisters, and of course that made the
squirrel, with the white on the end of her tail,
Slickoâs aunt. And Slicko liked Aunt Whitey
very much. There were always plenty of nuts
in Aunt Whiteyâs nest, and Slicko, as well as
her brothers and sister, liked to come on a visit.
But this time Slicko was all alone.

Pretty soon the little jumping girl squirrel
came to the tall tree where Aunt Whitey lived.

âNow I must be very careful,â thought Slicko.
âI must wait, before running in, to see if any
hunter-men, or dogs, or other enemies are watching
me. For if they are, they would see where
I go in, and they could find the nest, and maybe
catch Aunt Whitey and me.â

Squirrels, like birds and other woodland creatures,
do not like human beings to know where
their nests or homes are. So they take care to
make the front doors in such a way they can not
easily be seen, and when the forest creatures go
in, they always look around first, to see that no
enemy is watching. In that way they keep their
[36]

homes, or nests, secret. They have to, for they
have so many enemies.

Slicko looked all around, and, seeing no dogs,
wild animals or hunter-men on the watch, to spy
on her auntâs nest, the little squirrel scrambled
up the tree, sticking her sharp toe nails in the
soft bark as she had been taught to do.

When Slicko was half way up, she saw a hole
in the tree, just such a hole as at her nest at
home. This was the front door to the home of
her aunt.

Slicko gave two or three taps on the bark with
her front paw.

The little girl squirrel always did this when
she called on Mrs. Whitey, so the squirrel lady
would know it was one of her little friends or
relations, and not a bad owl, or hawk-bird, wanting
to eat her up.

Slicko expected to hear her aunt chatter, as
she always did:

âCome in and have some nuts!â

But there was no answer.

Slicko knocked again with her little paw, and
then, thinking her aunt might be asleep, the little
jumping squirrel gave a little hop down inside
the nest. It was just like the nest at home,
which she and the others had left because of the
danger from the hunter-man.

At first, coming in the dark nest, after having
[37]

been out in the bright sunlight, Slicko could see
nothing. Just as when you come into the house,
after having walked along the snowy road from
school, you have to wait until your eyes get used
to the darker house. It was that way with
Slicko.

Pretty soon, however, she could look about the
nest, and then her heart grew sad. For she saw
that Aunt Whitey did not live there any more.
The nest was deserted, and empty. Most of the
soft leaves, and the cotton from the milkweed
plant had been tossed out. The nest was all
upset. Most of the nuts were gone, and it looked
as though some boy, or man, or animal had been
inside, catching the squirrel lady, and taking the
nuts she had stored away to eat.

âOh, dear!â thought Slicko. âThis is terrible!
Aunt Whitey has either run away, or
been caught. There is no one here to take me!
What shall I do? Can I stay here all alone?
Oh, dear! Isnât it too bad!â

Slicko cowered down in the empty nest and
wondered what she should do, now that she had
no home to go back to.

[38]

CHAPTER IV

SLICKO SEES A CIRCUS

For a few minutes after jumping down into
the empty nest of her Aunt Whitey,
little Slicko did not know what to do.
It had all happened so suddenlyâthe breaking
up of the family, each one going to a different
place to hide, the coming of Slicko to these
woods, and the finding of the empty nestâthat
the little squirrel did not know what to think
of it.

Slicko listened as sharply as she could for any
sounds of danger. She bent her two little ears
forward, just as her mamma had told her to do
when she wanted to listen to any far-off sounds.
But Slicko could hear nothing.

That is, she could hear nothing that sounded
like danger. Of course she could hear the wind
blowing through the trees, the singing of the
grasshoppers, the call of the birds and noises
like that.

And none of these sounds meant any harm to
the little squirrel. She had heard them all her
life.

[39]

âOh, but it is so lonesome!â whispered Slicko
to herself. She did not want to speak aloud in
her queer, little chattering voice, for fear some
oneâlike a bad dog or a snakeâwould hear
her. And yet Slicko wanted to talk to some
one, even if it was only herself.

She lifted up her head, from where she had
nestled it down among the dried leaves in her
auntâs nest, and looked about her. The nest was
rather dark, but Slicko could see better now.
And what she saw made her sure that her aunt
had either been taken away by some enemy, or
had run off in a great hurry.

For the nest was all upset. The leaves were
scattered about, and most of the nuts were gone.

âWell, I guess Iâd better stay here for a while,â
thought Slicko to herself. âThere are a few
nuts here, and I can eat them when I get hungry.
When I want more, I shall have to go out and
get them, but, by that time, it may be safe.
Yes, Iâll stay here to-night, anyhow.â

Slicko peeped out of the opening to the nestâit
was a sort of front door to the squirrel
house. Slicko could see that it was getting dark
in the woods; that night was coming on. And
night, Slicko knew, was no time for a little
girl squirrel to be alone in the forest.

There were big-eyed owls flying about then,
and other enemies that might catch her.

[40]

âSo I shall be better off staying in the nest,
even if Aunt Whitey isnât at home,â thought
Slicko. âPoor Aunt Whitey!â she whispered.
âI wonder where she can be.â

Then Slicko happened to think that perhaps
her squirrel aunt might be hiding outside somewhere,
as wild animals often do hide, near their
nests, or homes, whenever they have been
frightened away.

âIâll call to her,â said Slicko to herself.

Going softly to the opening to the nest, Slicko
put out her head, and called:

âAunty! Aunty Whitey! Where are you?â

She listened, but all she heard in reply was the
singing of a robin, the call of a grasshopper and
the noise of the wind in the trees.

âI guess she has gone far off,â thought Slicko.
âWell, I will stay here until I find some other
place to go. Oh dear! If mamma and papa
only knew I was here all by myself, they would
come to me, or take me with them. But now
I shall have to stay all alone. Oh dear!â

It was the first time little Slicko had ever been
alone at night, but she was going to be brave.
Little animals have to be brave whether they
want to or not, and they have to leave their
homes and find their own things to eat, much
younger than do real children.

So, in a way, animals do not so much mind
[41]

being away from their papas and mammas as
you children would.

At first Slicko was pretty lonesome. She
shivered, and cuddled down in the leaves of her
auntâs nest, and wished she had her brothers
Fluffy and Nutto, and her sister Chatter, to
play with. They had always played little
jumping or running games before going to sleep
nights. But now Slicko was all alone, and had
no one to play with.

But, as I have said, Slicko was going to be
brave.

After the little jumping squirrel got over her
first feeling of fright, she began to be hungry.
There were a few nuts left in the nest, and
Slicko ate some of them, and felt better.

âAnd now I must make a warm place to
sleep,â she thought. Her mother had taught
her how to make herself a bed in the dried
leaves, and now Slicko did this. She smoothed
out a little hole, and pulled up some leaves that
would fall over her, and cover her up like a
blanket, when she went to sleep. For though
it was not yet winter, it was very cool in the
woods at night.

Soon Slicko was fast asleep. Animals go to
sleep very easily when they have eaten, and are
not frightened. They do not have to be sung
to, nor told stories, and they do not have to have
[42]

the light turned down low. They always go
to bed without a light.

Once, in the middle of the night, Slicko was
awakened. She heard a noise at the opening
of the nest, a scratching sort of noise, and it
sounded as though some one were trying to come
in.

âOh, dear! I wonder who it can be?â thought
Slicko. âBut Iâm not going to get up to look,â
she went on. âNo, indeed!â

Instead, she covered herself up deeper in the
leaves, and tried to go to sleep. She could not,
though, for the noise kept up. And then, all
of a sudden, something hooted:

âWho! Who! Who! Tu-whoo!â

âOh, itâs an owl!â thought Slicko. âA big
owl. But he canât get in here to eat me. Iâm
safe. Maybe thatâs the owl that drove Aunt
Whitey out of her nest.â

Once more the owl hooted, and then Slicko
heard the flapping of its wings as it flew away.

âHe didnât get me that time,â thought Slicko.
âBut I must be very careful! Very careful!â

Soon the little girl squirrel was asleep again,
and when next she awakened, the sun was shining
down, through the hole, into the nest.

âOh, good! Itâs morning!â chattered Slicko.
âNow the owl canât get me.â

Slicko knew that owls fly only at night, for
[43]

they have such funny eyes, that sunlight makes
them almost blind, and they cannot see to catch
little squirrels. So Slicko knew she was safe,
for a while, at least.

âNow for breakfast, then to wash my face and
paws, and weâll see what happens,â whispered
Slicko to herself. It did not take long to eat
the nuts for breakfast. Then Slicko felt thirsty.
She knew there was a nice spring of water not
far from her auntâs nest, for, when she had
come visiting other times, she had gone to it to
get a drink.

âAnd I wonder if it would be safe now?â
thought Slicko. âIâll take a look and see.â

She peered from the nest and saw nothing to
frighten her. Some birds were flitting through
the leafy trees, and down on the ground some
little hop-toads were jumping about. Perhaps
they were playing some game, as you play tag,
for you know animals have fun just as children
do, though, to be sure, it is a different kind of
fun.

âYes, Iâm going to get a drink,â said Slicko,
and she slipped out of the nest, and began to
climb down the side of the tree. But she was
very careful how she did it, for she knew danger
might be near, though she could not see it.

She ran quickly half way around the tree and
stayed there a second, with her body held flat
[44]

against the trunk. Slicko was colored gray, and
the tree bark was a sort of gray, so, unless you
had looked very sharply, you might not have
seen her yourself, until Slicko moved.

While she was holding herself there, very
quietly, Slicko was looking about to see if the
owl, or any other bad bird, or animal, were in
sight. But she saw nothing, and then she
scrambled down to the ground, and ran to the
spring.

Taking a good drink of the cool water, Slicko
washed her paws and face in it.
Then she
combed out her tail with her claws, for all squirrels
are very clean and tidy animals.

âWell, I wonder what I shall do now,â
thought Slicko. âI guess Iâll have to stay in
Aunt Whiteyâs nest for a long time, maybe. I
had better look about for more nuts, for when
those in the nest are gone, I shall need more to
eat. Yes, I will look for nuts.â

She started off through the woods, but she had
not gone very far, when, all of a sudden, she
saw something brown moving up in a tree.

In a second Slicko hid herself under some
leaves, and waited. She was in a place where
she could watch the brown creature. At first
Slicko thought it might be a big snake, or maybe
the owl that had tried to get her in the night.

[45]

Taking a drink of the cool water, Slicko washed her
paws and face in it.

[46-
47]

Then, as the brown creature moved closer,
Slicko saw that it had a long tail, and four legs,
and the legs had something like hands on the
ends.

âWhy, it looks just like a brown, hairy boy!â
thought Slicko. âAnd Iâm afraid of boys.
Mamma said they were dangerous. I wonder
what I had better do?â

Slicko hid deeper down in the leaves, and, a
little later, as the brown animal came closer,
the girl squirrel saw that it was not the kind of
a boy she had ever seen before. For, though
boys can climb trees, they can not climb up and
down as fast as the brown animal was doing, nor
can they hang by their tails. In fact, as Slicko
knew, boys have no tails.

And then Slicko heard the brown animal say:

âHa! Here are some of those chestnuts! I
must get some, for, though they are not as good
as cocoanuts, they will keep me from being
hungry. Yes, Iâll get some!â

âHa!â thought Slicko. âThat creature is not
a boy, thatâs sure! And it eats nuts just as we
squirrels do. I donât believe it will do me any
harm. Iâm going out to see.â

Slicko crawled out from under the leaves, and,
as soon as she moved, the brown creature called
out:

âWhat is that? Who is there? Who is it?â

His voice was a sort of chatter and chirp, like
[48]

that of some bird, but Slicko could understand
it pretty well.

âIt is I, if you please,â said Slicko. âI am
a little girl squirrel, and I am staying at my
auntâs nest, but she isnât home. Who are you, if
you please?â

âI am Mappo, the merry monkey,â was the
answer. âBut I canât see you. Where are
you?â

âDown in these leaves,â answered Slicko, and
she waved her tail, so Mappo could see her.

âOh, there you are!â cried the monkey, and
down he scrambled beside her. âWhat are you
doing here?â asked Mappo.

âI am hiding away from a hunter and his
dog,â went on the little squirrel. âAll our family
ran away from our nest, and I came here.
But my aunt is gone too, so I am all alone.â

âNever mind,â said Mappo, kindly, âI am
all alone also, so we will keep each other company.â

âWhere did you come from?â asked Slicko,
who had never before seen a monkey.

âOh, I used to live in a big woods, with my
brothers and sisters,â said Mappo. âBut, of
late, I have been with a circus. I ran away from
my cage in the circus though, and came to these
woods. And Iâve had the most fun! I met a
comical little pig namedââ

[49]

âOh, I know what he was named!â interrupted
Slicko.

âWhat was his name?â asked Mappo.

âSquinty!â cried the little girl squirrel. âAnd
he had the funniest nose, and one of his eyes was
half shut, andââ

âThatâs the one!â exclaimed Mappo. âHow
did you meet him?â

Then Slicko told of having talked to Squinty,
and Mappo also told how he had met the comical
little pig, just as I have told you in the book
about Squinty.

âBut you said you used to be in a circus,â
spoke Slicko, after a while.

âSo I did,â answered Mappo.

âWhatâs a circus?â Slicko wanted to know.

âWhat! Have you never seen a circus?â
asked Mappo. âWell, I must show it to you.
It is not far off. But I am not going back to it
right away. Come along.â

Mappo, the merry monkey, started off through
the forest, with Slicko following. Pretty soon
they saw a road in front of them. And, on the
other side of the road, were some big white
things, that looked like houses people live in.

âThose are the circus tents,â exclaimed
Mappo. âListen and you can hear the music.â

Slicko sat up on her tail and listened. She
heard many strange sounds.

[50]

CHAPTER V

SLICKO AND TUM TUM

âMappo,â asked Slicko, as she sat under
the shade of a tree, near the road,
and looked across at the tents in the
vacant lot, âis that what you call a circus,
Mappo?â

âThat is a circus, little Slicko,â answered the
monkey, kindly.

Slicko saw the white tents, she heard the bands
playing music, she heard men and boys calling
out strange words, such as âice cream cones!â
âpink lemonade!â and âpeanuts!â The last
word was the only one Slicko knew, for she had
heard that before.

Once a squirrel who had lived in a city park
came to visit Slickoâs mamma and papa. And
this city squirrel told how the children used to
go to the park and feed the squirrels peanuts.
So Slicko knew what peanuts were, when she
heard the circus boys and men shouting about
them.

âSo that is a circus, is it?â asked little Slicko,
as she looked at the big, white tents, all gay with
[51]

colored flags, fluttering in the wind, and heard
the nice music.

âYes,â answered Mappo, âthat is a circus.â

âAnd you ran away from itâyou ran away
from a nice place like that?â asked Slicko in
surprise.

âOh, well, I got tired of being in a cage all
the while,â said Mappo, the merry monkey. âI
am going back again soon, I guess, as it is no
fun to have to hunt for things to eat all the while.
In the circus, though I did have to stay in a
cage, I got all I wanted to eat without any trouble.
Yes, I think I shall run back again, soon.â

âI should think, if you had run away, they
would come after you, to find you,â said Slicko.

âThey did come once,â spoke Mappo, with a
laugh. âOnce when I was in the woods, talking
to Squinty, the comical pig, some circus men
came after me to catch me, but I ran away.
They havenât caught me yet,â and he laughed
and chattered, showing his many, white teeth.

For a little while Slicko and Mappo sat in
the woods looking at the circus, and then, all of
a sudden, the little girl squirrel cried out:

âOh, Mappo! What are those funny animals,
as big as houses, with two tails? What are
they?â

âHa! Ha! Ha!â laughed Mappo, the
merry monkey. âTwo tails! Ho! Ho!â

[52]

âWell, they
do
have two tails,â said Slicko.
âWhat are they?â

âThatâs just what Squinty, the comical pig,
wanted to know,â spoke Mappo. âHe thought
they had two tails also. Ha! Ha!â

âWell, havenât they?â asked Slicko, frisking
her big tail.

âNo,â answered Mappo. âThose are elephants,
and they have only one tail. The short
thing is their tail, and the long thing, in front
of them, hanging down, is their nose.â

âTheir nose!â cried Slicko. âWhat a funny
nose!â

âIt is called a trunk,â explained Mappo.
âBut it is really the elephantâs nose. He
breathes through it, but he can also use it like
a hand. He picks up what he wants to eat in
it, and it is hollow, like the hose with which
they fill the circus tubs, so we animals can drink.
Through his hollow trunk, the elephant sucks
up water, squirting it down his throat when he
is thirsty.â

âWhat a funny animal an elephant is!â exclaimed
Slicko. âAnd how big! Especially
that first one, with the two big, white things
sticking out of his mouth. What are those?â

âThose are his teeth, or tusks,â explained
Mappo. âBut you need not be afraid of that
big elephant.â

[53]

âWhy not?â asked Slicko.

âBecause he is the kindest, and most jolly elephant
in the whole circus,â went on Mappo the
monkey. âHis name is Tum Tum, and if you
were to meet him you would like him very
much.â

âDid Squinty, the comical pig, meet Tum
Tum?â asked Slicko.

âNo, Squinty did not have a chance,â said
Mappo, âbut he saw him. If I can, Iâll call
Tum Tum over here to see you. Iâm sure youâd
like him. And heâd give you a ride on his back.â

âOh, Iâd be afraid to let him!â exclaimed
Slicko.

âPooh! He wouldnât hurt a fly!â laughed
Mappo. âLots of the children who come to the
circus ride on Tum Tumâs back. He is very
kind to them, and he would be kind to you.
Only, if you should see him, be sure to tell him
youâre not a rat or a mouse.â

âOf course Iâm not a rat or a mouse,â said
Slicko. âWhy should I tell Tum Tum, the elephant,
that I am not, when he can see for himself,
if he has any eyes?â

âWell, you do look a little like a great rat,â
said Mappo. âNot that itâs any harm, Slicko.
But, you see, Tum Tum and other elephants are
very much afraid of rats and mice. I donât
know why, unless they are afraid the little creatures
[54]

will run up inside their trunks and make
them sneeze. But, anyhow, youâre not a rat or a
mouse. And if you see Tum Tum, be sure to
tell him that, the first thing.â

âI will,â promised Slicko, âbut maybe I wonât
see Tum Tum to speak to.â

âOh, you might,â answered Mappo. âYou
canât tell.â

Just then the merry little monkey gave a jump,
and cried out:

âHa! There come some circus men over this
way. I think they are going to hunt for me
again. I donât want to be caught just yet, and
be put back in my cage, so Iâm going to run off
and hide in the woods again. Good-bye, Slicko.
I am glad I met you.â

âGood-bye, Mappo!â cried the little girl
squirrel. âI am glad I met you, and Iâm sorry
youâre going to run away again. But I wonât
tell them where you are. I guess Iâll go hide,
too.â

So Mappo, the merry monkey, ran off through
the woods one way, and Slicko ran the other, and
they did not see each other again for some time.

I might say that I expect to tell you, in a
book after this one, some of the adventures of
Mappo, the merry monkey, but I have no room
for him in this story.

Slicko ran on through the woods, jumping
[55]

from tree to tree as she had been taught. She
was all alone again, and she was feeling rather
lonesome without Mappo, or for some of her
squirrel friends.

Slicko made her way back to the nest where
her aunt had lived. She rather hoped Mrs.
Whitey might be back there, waiting for her, but
the nest in the tall tree was still empty. There
was no sign of the nice old lady squirrel.

âWell, I guess I had better gather some nuts,
and hide them away,â thought Slicko. âI may
have to stay in this nest a month or more, until
papa and mamma make a new home for me, and
my sister and brothers.â

So Slicko scrambled down to the ground
again, and began to gather nuts and acorns.
These she carried up to the nest, hiding them
away under the leaves. Some she put in a hollow
stump, on the ground not far away from the
tree where the nest was.

When Slicko had done this, she sat down on
her tail, curling it up at her back like a feather,
to take a rest, for she was rather tired.

âMy!â she thought, as she sat there. âWhat
a lot of things have happened to me since I had
to leave my home. An owl got after me, I have
seen a circus, I met a monkey and I have seen
a creature, with two tails, called an elephant.
At least an elephant looks as though it had two
[56]

tails, no matter what Mappo says,â went on
Slicko. âI wonder if I shall ever meet Tum
Tum, and tell him I am not a rat or a mouse?
What a funny thing it would be if I did.â

Slicko sat on the edge of the nest for some
time, and then she began to feel hungry.

âI wish I had some of those peanuts I heard
them talking about in the circus,â said Slicko
in a whisper. âI know they must be good, from
what that city-park squirrel said. And I wonder
what pink lemonade and ice cream cones
are? I donât believe they are good to eat.â

You can see that Slicko had many things to
learnâthings that you know already, such as
that ice cream cones are good to eat. But, if
Slicko did not know that, she knew other things
that you children do not know, such as where to
find nuts, and how to gnaw through the shells,
and get at the meat without using a nut cracker.

All of a sudden, as Slicko was running toward
the spring of water to get a drink, after her dinner,
she heard a crashing in the bushes.

âI wonder if that is Mappo coming back,â
thought Slicko. She looked through the trees,
and saw something almost as large as a house,
and dark in color, pushing through the bushes.

âWhy, itâs an elephantâitâs Tum Tum!â exclaimed
Slicko, as she saw the big creature, with
his trunk on one end, and his tail on the other,
[57]

and two big, long, white teeth sticking out of
his mouth. âYes, that surely is Tum Tum!â

Slicko spoke the last words out loud.

âHa! Who is calling to me?â asked the circus
elephant in his deep, rumbling voice. âWho
is calling me?â

âI spoke your name, Tum Tum,â said Slicko.
âHere I am, by this old stump.â

Tum Tum, the jolly elephant, looked at the
little squirrel, and then he began to shiver and
shake as hard as he could. He shook so hard
that he shook a lot of pine cones down off a pine
tree up against which he was leaning.

âOh my! Oh dear! This is terrible!â cried
Tum Tum in his big, deep, rumbling voice.
âOh dear!â

[58]

CHAPTER VI

SLICKO GOES NUTTING

Slicko was so surprised, at first, by the
cries of Tum Tum, and at the fear which
the big elephant showed, that she did not
know what to think. It really seemed that Tum
Tum was afraid of herâof a little, jumping
squirrel girl!

Then Slicko happened to remember what
Mappo had told her.

âIf ever you see Tum Tum,â the monkey had
said, âtell him at once that you are not a mouse
or a rat.â

âHa! Thatâs what I must do!â thought
Slicko. âTum Tum must be afraid of me. Iâll
speak to him.â

Scrambling half way up the trunk of a tree, to
make herself higher, and nearer to the big ears
of Tum Tum, Slicko cried out in her chattering
voice:

âIâm not a mouse, Tum Tum! Iâm not a rat!â

âHa! Whatâs that?â asked the elephant, flapping
one of his ears sideways, so he could hear
better. âWhat did you say?â

[59]

âIâm only a little girl squirrel, and I wouldnât hurt you
for the world,â went on Slicko.

[60-
61]

âI said I was not a rat or a mouseâ
Iâm only
a little girl squirrel, and I wouldnât hurt you for
the world,â went on Slicko.

âOh, Iâm so glad!â cried the elephant, and he
did not shiver and shake any more, and did not
knock down any pine tree cones.

As first it might seem funny for a squirrel to
say she would not hurt an elephant, because an
elephant is so large. But I have told you that
elephants are sometimes afraid of even such a
little thing as a mouse.

âSo you are not a rat, eh?â asked the elephant
of Slicko.

âNo, Tum Tum, and Iâm not a mouse, either,â
answered the little girl squirrel.

âHa! How do you happen to know my
name?â asked Tum Tum.

âMappo, the merry monkey, told me,â said
the little squirrel girl. âAnd Mappo told me
I was to tell you I was not a mouse or a rat. I
wonât run up your trunk, and scare you.â

âThatâs good,â said Tum Tum. âNow I can
see clearly that you are a little squirrel. I like
you! But what about that little rascal, Mappo?
Where is he? I came out to look for him.
They want him back in his cage to ride around
the circus ring on the back of a pony, and do
other tricks to make the children laugh.â

âOh, he ran away,â said Slicko. âHe thought
[62]

he heard some men coming after him. He said
he did not want to go back to the cage just yet.
He wants to have some fun in the woods.â

âWell, well! He is a funny monkey,â said
Tum Tum. âAnd I came all the way from the
circus grounds to find him. But if he is gone,
I wonât look any farther. Iâll go back to my
tent, for the men may be coming after me.â

âOh, canât you stay here with me a little while?
I am so lonesome!â spoke Slicko.

âWell, I might stay a short time,â Tum Tum
said. âBut what are you doing in the woods all
alone, little Slicko?â

Then the little squirrel girl told how she had
had to run away from her own nest, and how
she had not been able to find her aunt, and how
she was now living all by herself in the woods.

âWell, I wish I could stay with you, and keep
you company, Slicko,â said Tum Tum. âBut
I belong back in the circus, and I guess you
would rather jump through the tree branches,
and skip about in them, than go as slowly as I
have to go, crashing through the bushes. And I
certainly never could climb a tree, and sleep in
a nest, as you do,â went on Tum Tum, with a
jolly laugh.

âNo, I suppose not,â said Slicko. âYou are
too big for a nest. Well, if you see Mappo,
please send him back to me. I am so lonesome.â

[63]

âIf I see him I will,â Tum Tum answered.
And then he walked on back through the woods.

âGood-bye, Slicko!â called the jolly elephant.
âI have to be in the show this afternoon. I have
to make believe play ball, and eat my dinner
at a real table, and then I have to play the hand
organ with my trunk. Those are some of my
tricks.â

âOh, I met a pig who said he could do tricks!â
cried Slicko.

âWas his name Squinty?â inquired the jolly
elephant.

âYes,â said Slicko, âhis name was Squinty.â

âI met him, too,â said Tum Tum. âHe was
a comical little pig. But now I must hurry
back,â and on he went, crashing his way through
the bushes. Some day, in another book, I shall
tell you all the adventures of Tum Tum, the
jolly elephant.

Slicko felt more lonesome than ever when the
elephant had left her. She did not know what
to do, and she wanted, more than ever, to see
her mamma and papa, and sister and brothers
again. Then, all at once, Slicko thought of
something.

âOh, I forgot to ask Tum Tum to give me a
ride on his back!â exclaimed Slicko. âMappo
said he would, as he was such a kind elephant.
Iâm going to call to him.â

[64]

So Slicko called, in her chattering voice:

âTum Tum! Tum Tum!â

âYes, I hear you. What is it?â asked the elephant,
stopping.

âWould you please give me a ride on your
back,â begged Slicko. âMappo, the merry
monkey, said you gave children at the circus
rides, and I am so little you would hardly feel
me.â

âOf course Iâll give you a ride!â cried Tum
Tum. âI thought I was forgetting something,â
he went on, as he crashed back through the
bushes. âI meant to invite you for a little ride
on my back,â went on Tum Tum. âWhy, I
shouldnât feel you any more than I should a
feather, Slicko. Besides, I am very strong; I
could carry ten children on my back, and hardly
know it.â

âOh, indeed you must be very strong!â cried
the little squirrel girl.

Tum Tum, with a jolly noise that sounded as
much like a laugh as any elephant can make,
stood under the branch of the tree on which
Slicko was perched.

âHop down, little squirrel,â invited the big,
jolly elephant. Down hopped Slicko, landing
on the back of Tum Tum, and then what a fine
ride she had!

Tum Tum could step over bushes that would
[65]

have taken Slicko some time to climb, and some
bushes Tum Tum trampled under his big feet
as though they were straw.

Other bushes the elephant pushed his big body
through, as easily as the clown in the circus
jumps off the horseâs back through the paper
hoop.

âDo you like riding on my back?â asked Tum
Tum, swinging along.

âOh, it is just fine!â cried Slicko, as she sat
there, with her tail held over her head like a
sun umbrella. âBut donât go too far with me,
Tum Tum, please.â

âI wonât,â the elephant said. And pretty soon
he turned back with Slicko, and left her on the
same branch from which she had jumpedâright
near her auntâs nest.

âWell, good-bye once more, Slicko,â called
Tum Tum. âI may see you again to-morrow.
And if you meet that Mappo, tell him he is
wanted back in the circus.â

âIâll tell him,â promised Slicko.

Once more the little jumping girl squirrel was
all alone in the big woods. Somewhere in the
forest were her father and mother, and her sister
and brothers were somewhere about. But just
where, Slicko did not know.

âWell,â thought the little creature, in a way
squirrels and other animals have of thinking,
[66]

âwell, I guess I shall have to stay alone to-night
again. And perhaps for many more nights and
days. I wonder what will become of me, and
if I shall ever see my folks again. Oh dear!â

Slicko felt a little sad for a moment, but then
she knew that she would have to be brave, and
do things for herself, since there was no one to
help her.

âI think Iâll put some more leaves, and some
cotton from the milkweed plant, in Aunt
Whiteyâs nest,â thought Slicko. âThat will
make it warmer.â

Fixing up the nest so it would be nicer to stay
in took Slicko until nearly dark. Then, after
she had carried up some nuts to the nest, so she
would have them ready for morning, Slicko
curled up in the soft leaves and went to sleep.

Nothing bothered her this night. No bad old
owl, with big, round, staring eyes, tried to get
the little squirrel. Perhaps the owl, which had
tried it before, was sure the nest was empty, and
that he could not get anything to eat from it.
At any rate the owl did not come, and Slicko was
glad of it.

In the morning, after her breakfast, having
had a drink and washed at the spring, Slicko
said:

âI think I had better go off in the woods nutting,
to-day. I shall need many nuts to eat, if
[67]

I have to stay here all winter, and I had better
begin to gather them now before they are all
gone.â

Slicko knew, as do all squirrels, the best places
in the woods to look for nuts. Soon the little
girl squirrel had found many chestnuts, acorns,
hickory nuts and beech nuts. These she carried,
a few at a time, up to her auntâs nest-house.

âIf Aunt Whitey should come back, there
would be enough for her and me too,â thought
Slicko.

The store-house of the nest was almost full of
nuts, but still Slicko was not satisfied.

âI must get more,â she said to herself, âfor
we may have a long winter, with much snow.â
Well, Slicko knew how hard the winter was for
squirrels, and all animals.

So the next day Slicko went off nutting again.
She had not gone very far through the woods before
she came to a little grassy place, and there,
in the middle of it, Slicko saw a nice pile of nuts,
all gathered up, ready to be taken away.

âOh, thatâs just fine!â thought Slicko to herself.
âThe nuts are all in a nice heap, and I
donât have to pick them up, one by one, and
carry them home. I can take a whole paw full
at once.â

Now Slicko was a wise little squirrel in some
ways. But she had many things yet to learn.
[68]

She did not stop to think that nuts in the woods
never heap themselves up in a pile without some
animal or some person doing it. Slicko thought
the nuts were put there just for her. But it was
all a trick, as you shall soon see.

Of course Slicko did not at once jump down
to get the nuts. She knew enough not to do
that, for she had often been told some animal
might be waiting to grab her. So she looked
all around, and, seeing nothing, down she scrambled.

As Slicko came nearer to the pile of nuts, and
saw how nice they looked, she said to herself:

âOh, there will be enough for all winter.
How lovely!â

But there was something else besides the nuts
there on the ground, though Slicko did not see
it. If she had noticed it, and had kept out of
the way, she might not have had as many adventures
as she did have. But little squirrels
are not always wise and smart, any more than
real children are.

Right up to the pile of nuts scampered Slicko.
She took up some chestnuts in her paws, that
were like little hands, and then, all of a sudden,
something clicked, and snapped, and Slicko felt
herself caught by one leg, and held tightly.

[69]

CHAPTER VII

SLICKO IS CAUGHT

Poor Slicko was so surprised at first, and
her leg pained her so much, from whatever
it was that had grasped it, that the
little squirrel lay quite still for a moment. Her
heart beat very fast, and she thought of the many
dangers, which her father and mother had told
her might happen to little squirrels.

âAnd Iâm sure something dreadful has happened
to me!â thought Slicko, as she looked all
around with her bright eyes. âYes, something
dreadful has happened. I wonder what it is.
Can it be that an owl, or a hawk or a snake has
caught me?â

Slicko tried to think of these different birds
and the snake, for each one has a different way
of catching a squirrel, and Slicko wanted to make
sure which it was that had hold of her.

Then, as she heard no fluttering of wings,
which she would have heard had it been a big
bird which had caught her, and, as she did not
hear the hiss of an angry snake, she felt sure it
was none of those dangers.

[70]

âBut what can it be that has hold of my leg?â
thought Slicko.

She looked down, and there, partly hidden
under the grass and the pile of nuts, where Slicko
had not seen it before, was a steel trap. And
her leg was caught in that trap, between two
pieces of steel, that pressed together as hard as
the rubber rollers of the wringer press on the
clothes on washday.

âOh dear!â though Poor Slicko. âI am
caught in a trap! Papa and mamma told me to
be careful of traps, but I didnât see this one. I
guess I was thinking too much of the nuts.
Oh dear! What shall I do? How can I get
out?â

That is what Slicko thought as she lay there,
her leg in the trap, hurting her very much. All
animals, when they are caught in a trap, at once
begin to think of how they can get out. Some
think one way, and some another, but they all
think, or else how could some of them get out
the way they do? Of course I donât mean to
say that animals think just the way we do, any
more than they talk the way we do. But they
talk and think in a language of their own.

Slicko was not a very old squirrel, and this
was the first time she had ever been in a trap.
If she had been an older squirrel, she would not
have gone near the pile of nuts, for an older
[71]

squirrel would have been sure they were put
there on purpose to fool some animal.

But Slicko did not think. That was why she
was caught in the trap.

âOh, I must get out!â chattered poor Slicko.
âI must get away from here, or some one may
come and catch me!â

Slicko tried to pull her leg out of the trap,
but the strong spring of it held the steel jaws
tightly together. Some animal traps have sharp
teeth on the steel jaws that spring together, and
they hurt very much. But this trap was not that
kind, and Slicko was glad of it. So the only
thing that happened to her leg was that it was
badly pinched, and squeezed tightly.

Still she knew that if she did not pull herself
away, something else dreadful might happen to
her.

âWell,â said Slicko to herself, when she had
tried several times to pull her leg out and could
not, âif I canât get loose from the trap, maybe
I can pull the trap with me, off into the woods,
and I can find some other big man-squirrel to
help me get loose. Thatâs what Iâll do.â

But when Slicko tried to run off, with the trap
still fastened to her leg, she found that she could
not. The trap was chained to a tree, and Slicko
was held fast.

âOh dear!â cried the little squirrel. âIâm
[72]

never going to get loose. I wish my mamma or
papa would come!â

But Papa and Mamma Squirrel were away
off in the woods, and they thought their little
daughter was safe with her Aunt Whitey. They
did not know all that had happened.

Slicko tried and tried again to get out of the
trap, or to pull the trap away with her, but she
could not. Then, as she was pretty tired, and as
her little heart was beating very fast, she lay
down to rest.

Finding some of the nuts close to her nose,
she began to eat one, for she was quite hungry,
even if she was fast in a trap.

After Slicko had eaten a few nuts, she felt
better. She was a little stronger, too, and she
thought perhaps now she could get out of the
trap, but, when she tried, the jaws of it held her
as tightly as ever.

âOh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!â cried poor
Slicko.

All at once she heard, off in the woods, the
sound of bushes being trampled down. Twigs
and branches snapped and broke, and Slicko
knew something was coming.

âI hope it isnât a bear, or any bad animal that
will get me,â thought the little girl squirrel.
With her bright eyes snapping, Slicko watched
and waited.

[73]

All of a sudden, through the bushes, straight
for the place where Slicko lay, near the pile of
nuts, came a boy. Slicko knew it was a boy because
he was just like the hunter-man, only
smaller. But the boy had no gun, and Slicko
was glad of that. However, there was a dog
with him, and for that, Slicko was sorry.

âHere, Rover! Rover!â called the boy to his
dog, for Rover was running all about, sniffing
under stones and bushes. âHere, Rover! Letâs
see if we have anything in our trap,â the boy
called.

âAh! so he is the one who put the trap here
to catch me!â thought Slicko. She could understand
some man or boy-talk, though she could
not speak it herself, just as your dog understands
how to run to you when you say: âCome here!â
But, though he understands you, he cannot make
you understand him.

âBow wow!â barked the dog with the boy.
âBow wow!â

âYes, I hear you. What is it?â the boy asked.

âBow wow! Wow! Wow!â barked the dog,
and Slicko saw him looking straight at her.

I guess the dog was trying to tell the boy there
was something in the trap, but the boy didnât understand
dog-talk very well.

âBow wow!â barked the dog again. And
then, as Slicko tried to hide herself down under
[74]

the leaves, where the dog could not see her, that
dog barked louder than ever.

âBow wow! Wow! Wow! Woppity-wop-wow!â

âWell, youâre making a lot of fuss!â exclaimed
the boy, as he pushed his way through
the bushes. âHave you caught something,
Rover, old boy?â

âBow wow! Yes!â answered the dog.

Then the boy came up to the trap.

âHa! I
have
caught something!â he cried.
âA squirrel, too! I thought I would if I piled
up those nuts there, and hid the trap near them.
Ha! Iâve caught a squirrel.â

âOh, what a mean boy you are!â said Slicko
to herself. âYou set the trap on purpose to
catch me! Oh, how mean!â

Now this boy was not mean exactly, or cruel,
as you shall soon see. He was only thoughtless,
as most boys are. He never really intended to
hurt the little squirrel. Perhaps he thought the
fur on a squirrelâs leg was so thick that the trap,
springing shut, would not hurt. And, really,
Slicko was not hurt such a terrible lot. But she
felt badly enough, let me tell you.

âYes, I have a squirrel!â the boy cried, and
he seemed real glad of it. âNow I can take it
home and tame it.â

Slicko did not know what âtameâ meant, but
[75]

she thought if it meant being caught by your leg
in a trap, that she would not like it at all.

âYes,â went on the boy, âIâll take the squirrel
home and tame it, and teach it tricks.â

âHa! Tricks!â said Slicko to herself.
âWhere have I heard that word before? Oh,
I know! Squinty, the comical pig, could do
tricks, and so could Tum Tum, the jolly elephant.

âWell, maybe if this boy teaches me some
tricks, it will not be so bad. Then I could go
home and surprise Chatter, Fluffy and Nutto.
I donât believe they can do tricks.â

Slicko watched the boy and dog. The dog
was barking and jumping about in the leaves.
He seemed quite excited at seeing the squirrel
in the trap.

âQuiet, Rover! Lie down!â said the boy, and
Rover minded like the good dog he was.

âNow, letâs see how I am going to get this
little squirrel home,â the boy went on. âI ought
to have brought a box.â

âI wonder if he means take me to
his
home or

my
home?â thought Slicko. âI guess he must
mean
his
home, for he doesnât know where mine
isâI donât know myself.â

âI hope the trap didnât break her leg,â the
boy went on. âI donât believe it did, for the
spring wasnât very strong.â

[76]

âOh, Iâm sure my leg is broken,â thought poor
Slicko. âIt hurts very much.â

The boy put out his hand very slowly to take
the little squirrel out of the trap.

âI wonder if youâll bite,â he said.

âHa! Thatâs so. I
can
bite!â said Slicko out
loud, but, to the boy, her talk only sounded like
chattering.

Slicko had sharp teeth, and very strong. They
had to be, for with them she had to gnaw off the
shell of hard hickory nuts. So Slicko knew she
could bite fiercely if she wanted to.

âBut I donât know that I want to,â thought
Slicko. âIf I bite, the boy will be angry at me,
and if he is to teach me tricks, it will be better
if we are friends. No, I wonât bite him, though
I could if I wanted to.â

Slowly and carefully, the boy put out his hand
toward Slicko.

âI wish I had a thick pair of gloves,â he said.
âThen if you bit, it wouldnât hurt. I got bit by
a squirrel once, and I donât want it to happen
again.â

âI wonât bite you,â said Slicko, though of
course the boy could not understand her. Now
his hand was on the soft fur of Slickoâs back, and
he stroked her gently.

âPoor little squirrel,â said the boy. âIâm
sorry you were caught in the trap, and I hope
[77]

youâre not hurt much. IâI guess Iâm never
going to set any more traps.â

The boy felt sorry now, for poor Slicko looked
at him with such a sorrowful look in her bright
eyes, that it really seemed as if she were crying
tears of painâthat is, if squirrels can cry. They
can feel pain, at any rate.

So you see, though it was a sad thing for Slicko
to be caught in a trap, in one way it was a good
thing, for it taught the boy a lesson, and made
him more kind-hearted.

âIâll soon have you loose, little squirrel,â the
boy went on. Then he quickly pressed on the
spring of the trap with one hand, while he held
Slicko with the other. The jaws of the trap
came open, and Slickoâs leg was loose. And
oh! how good it felt not to be squeezed as she
had been.

Then, all of a sudden, Slicko felt herself lifted
up, and put into a soft, dark placeâa place as
dark as the deepest, darkest part of the nest at
homeâthe cellar part where the nuts were
stored away for winter.

[78]

CHAPTER VIII

SLICKOâS NEW HOME

Slicko, the jumping squirrel, found herself
all huddled up in a heap in the soft,
dark place. She did not feel much like
jumping just thenâindeed she could not have
jumped if she had wished, for there was no
room.

Besides, her leg, that had been caught in the
trap, hurt her quite a lot, though not so much as
it had at first.

âIâI wonder where I am,â thought Slicko,
as she tried to look about her. Soon she could
see better than at first, and, as a squirrelâs eyes
are made to see in the dark, much as are the eyes
of the owl-bird, Slicko could soon make out
where she was.

She was down inside a sort of bag, very soft
and cozy, but even though it was so soft, Slicko
could not get out. She tried, but there was no
hole. Even the top, through which she had been
put in, was tightly closed.

Slicko tried her teeth on some of the soft
stuff, but it tickled her little red tongue, so she
stopped.

[79]

âI wonder where I am,â thought Slicko, again.

And, though she did not know it, she was in
the boyâs coat pocket, and he had pinned the flap
down over it, so the little squirrel could not get
out. Later on Slicko took many trips in that
same pocket, and was not afraid, but this time
her little heart beat very fast, for she did not
know what was going to happen to her.

âWell, I donât believe Iâll try to catch any
more squirrels,â said the boy. âIâll take this
trap home with me.â

âAh, thatâs good!â thought Slicko. âIf he
takes the trap away, no more squirrels will be
caught. Thatâs very good!â

âAnd I guess Iâll take some of these nuts home
to feed my new squirrel,â went on the boy, speaking
out loud the way boys do sometimes, especially
if they have their dogs with them.

âBow wow!â barked Rover, the dog. âBow
wow!â That was his way of saying that he,
too, thought it would be a good thing to take
home some of the nuts.

Slicko heard the nuts rattling into the other
pocket of the boy who had caught her, and then
she felt him walking off with her. Through the
woods he went, as Slicko could tell, for she
heard the rattle and crack of the bushes, as the
boy pushed his way through them.

After what seemed to Slicko a long time, she
[80]

fell asleep in the boyâs pocket, and, when she
awoke, she was in such a bright light that it
made her eyes blink very fast. The boy had
opened his pocket, and had taken Slicko out in
his hands.

âOh, what have you got, Bob?â asked a small
girl, one of the boyâs sisters.

âA little squirrel,â he answered.

âWhere did you get it?â asked another girl.

âI caught it in a trap in the woods, Sallie,â
the boy answered.

âOh, how cruel, to catch a poor little squirrel
in a trap!â exclaimed the first little girl.

âOh, I didnât hurt it,â said Bob. âAnd, when
it gets tame Iâm going to teach it some tricks.â

âAre you going to put the squirrel in a cage
with a wheel?â asked the girl whose name was
Mollie.

âYes, as soon as papa gets me that kind of a
cage,â the boy said. âBut, until then, Iâll let
it stay in a box.â

âI hope it doesnât get away like Squinty, your
pig, did,â spoke Sallie.

âOh, no, I wonât let the squirrel get away,â
said the boy.

âHa!â thought Slicko. âSquinty the pig! I
wonder if this is the boy who made a pet of
Squinty. If it is the same one, I am sure he will
be kind to me.â

[81]

âOh, how cruel, to catch a poor little squirrel in a trap!â
exclaimed the first girl.

[82-
83]

âWhere do you suppose Squinty is now?â
asked Sallie.

âBack in the pen with the other pigs,â the
boy replied. âAfter he got away, he grew too
big to keep for a pet. But this squirrel wonât
grow too big.â

âIâm sorry for that,â thought Slicko. âFor
if I grew big enough I, too, might be allowed to
go back to my home. But I will wait and see
what will happen. I will be as good as I can,
and learn all the tricks I can, and the boy and
his sisters will love me.â

âOh, isnât she cute!â cried one of the little
girls, as she put her finger on the soft fur of
Slickoâs back.

âLook out, she might bite!â exclaimed the
other little girl.

âIndeed Iâll not!â chattered Slicko. âI
wouldnât be so impolite as that.â

That is what Slicko said, but of course the
boy and his sisters could not understand. But
they could see that Slicko was very gentle, and,
as she lay there, in the boyâs warm hand, the two
little girls petted her, and loved Slicko.

âNow Iâll put her in a box,â the boy said,
âand give her some nuts to eat and some water
to drink.â

âThat will be fine!â thought Slicko, for she
was very thirsty and hungry.

[84]

A little later she found herself in a small
wooden box. In one corner were some nuts, in
another a dish of water, and in a third corner
some nice soft cotton, almost like the kind that
comes on the inside of the pods of the milkweed
plant.

âWell, this isnât like my home-nest in the
tree, nor like Aunt Whiteyâs nest,â thought
Slicko, âbut as long as I have to stay here, I
might as well make the best of it. I can eat and
drink, anyhow. I shall not be hungry or thirsty.â

Slicko took up a hickory nut in her paws,
that were like little hands, and, sitting up on her
hind legs, with her tail spread out over her like
an umbrella, she began to eat the meat of the
nut.

âOh, look!â cried one of the girls, who was
watching. âCome and see the squirrel eat,
Sallie!â

âHa! It isnât so wonderfulâjust to eat,â
thought Slicko. âI wonder how those girls
would like it, if I came to look on every time

they
ate!â

Slicko could not get away, so she had to eat
with the boyâs sisters looking on. Not that Slicko
minded very much, for she was beginning to like
her new home, and she felt sure that she would
be in no danger from dogs, or other animals.
And if she got enough to eat, water to drink, and
[85]

had a nice, warm place to sleep in, what more
could a squirrel ask?

Slickoâs leg hurt her a little bit, but it was getting
better all the while, and she was feeling happier
and happier every minute. True, she would
have been very glad if her papa and mamma
and her sister and brothers had been with her,
but then she knew she could not have everything
she wanted.

âAnd itâs just wonderful that the same boy
who has me had Squinty, the comical pig, for his
pet,â thought Slicko. âSquinty said the boy was
good and kind, and Iâm sure heâll teach me some
nice tricks. I shall love to learn tricks.â

For two or three days Slicko stayed in the box
where the boy had first put her. Every day
she was given fresh water, and this was what she
needed almost more than she did nuts to eat. All
animals need water, especially in hot weather, so
if ever you have a squirrel, or any other pets,
see to it that they have all the cool, clean water
they wish to drink.

âI wonder when my new cage is to come,
whatever a cage is,â thought Slicko, after she
had been in the box about a week. âI am
anxious to see it, and I wonder what that wheel
is the boy spoke about.â

Slicko was soon to know, however.

One day, when Slicko was eating nuts in her
[86]

box, she looked up at the top, over which had
been fastened a bit of wire so she could not get
out, and, looking down at her, Slicko saw the
boyâs big dog staring in.

âBow wow!â barked the dog.

âChatter-chat! Chit-chat-chatter-r-r-r-r-r-r!â
went Slicko.

That was her way of saying: âHow do you
do?â

She did not feel afraid, for she knew the dog
could not get at her in the box.

âOh, Bob! The dog is after your squirrel!â
suddenly called Mollie.

âYes, come quickly!â shouted Sallie.

âBow wow!â barked the dog. And he seemed
to say:

âDonât worry! I wouldnât hurt that little
squirrel for the world. I just want to look at
her.â

âOh, Rover wonât hurt Slicko,â said the boy,
who had given his new pet the same name as had
the squirrelâs mamma. In fact, Slicko was so
smooth and slick, and so clean, that it would
have been hard to get any other name to fit her
as well as did Slicko.

âSee, the dog and squirrel will be good
friends,â said the boy. With that he reached in
and lifted Slicko out of the box, holding her
close to Rover.

[87]

Rover put out his red tongue and touched
Slicko with it. And Slicko put out her tiny-paw
and touched Rover. That was her way of
shaking hands.

âSee, they are friends!â said the boy. âSoon,
when Slicko gets a little tamer, Iâm going to let
her run out of the cage, and go all over the
house.â

âShe may run away, like Squinty, the comical
pig,â said Mollie.

âOh, I donât believe she will,â answered the
boy.

Just then some one called:

âBob! Bob! Where are you? Come here!
The new cage for your squirrel has come!â

âOh, itâs my new home!â thought Slicko. âI
wonder what it is like.â

[88]

CHAPTER IX

SLICKO DOES SOME TRICKS

Slicko was put back into the wooden
box, and Bob fastened the wire over the
top again.

âHa! The boy didnât need to do that!â
thought the little squirrel. âI wonât run awayâat
least not until I see my new house.â

The boy and his sisters went to where their
mamma had called them, and soon they came
running back again. The boy carried a big
wire cage, something like the one in which
Slicko had once seen a canary bird flying about.
But this new cage for Slicko was much larger,
and, at one end, was a big round wheel of wire,
something like a merry-go-round, only it whirled
the other way, like a hoop, and there were no
wooden animals, or seats, on this squirrel wheel.

âWhat can it be for?â thought Slicko.

Bob, the boy, lifted Slicko up out of her little
wooden box.

âLetâs see how you like your new cage,â he
said.

[89]

âOh, but thereâs nothing for her to eat or drink
in it,â cried one of the girls.

âIâll put in some nuts and water,â Bob said.
âCome, Slicko, go into your new cage.â

Bob opened a little wire door, and thrust
Slicko through it into the cage. The door went
shut with a click and a slam, that reminded
Slicko of the time she had been caught in the
trap. She looked around quickly, wondering if
there were a trap near her now. But she saw
only the clean, new, wire cage, with little dishes
for nuts and water, a little covered-over dark
place, where she could crawl in during the day,
and go to sleep in the dark; and then there was
that great big wire wheel, that spun around very
easily when Bob touched it with his finger.

âOh, Iâm never going in that!â thought Slicko,
somewhat afraid.

She crouched down, and looked carefully all
around her new cage. She wanted to see if there
were any danger near. But all she saw, through
the wires, was the boy, his two sisters and Rover,
the dog she had grown to like very much.

âOh, I guess it will be all right here,â thought
Slicko. âI will not be afraid.â

âDoesnât she look cute in there?â asked Mollie,
laughing.

âShe certainly does,â agreed Sallie.

âYou wait until I teach her some tricks,â
[90]

spoke the boy. âThen sheâll be worth looking
at.â

Slicko made up her mind she would learn the
tricks as soon as she could.

âThen Iâll be like Squinty, the comical pig,â
she said to herself.

Soon Slicko felt quite at home in her new
cage. She went inside the little bedroom, that
was pretty dark, even in the daytime. Squirrels,
and all wild animals, like to be in the dark,
and off by themselves, once in a while.

Inside the little bedroom, which was made of
tin and wire, like the rest of the cage, was some
soft cotton, and in this Slicko could cuddle up
and keep warm, even when winter came. And,
as I have said, there was a dish for nuts and another
for water. These the boy filled, and soon
Slicko was eating her first meal in her new home.

âI wish sheâd go in the wheel, and ride it,â
said Mollie.

âShe will, after a while,â the boy said. âI
know how to make her.â

Slicko wondered how he would do it, but she
could not guess.

For several days the little jumping squirrel
lived in her new cage. The boy and his sisters
would come to watch her, and bring her nice
things to eat, so Slicko soon became real tame.
Often other children would come to look at her.

[91]

Sometimes the boy would take her out, and
put her in his pocket, as he had done on the day
he brought Slicko from the woods, after she had
been caught in the trap. Then Slicko would
stick her head out, just a little bit, and all the
children would exclaim:

âOh, isnât she cute!â

Slicko did not know exactly what âcuteâ
meant, but she tried to be as nice and polite as
she could.

âHave you taught your squirrel any tricks
yet?â asked Mollie of her brother, one day.

âNo, but I am going to try one now. Do you
want to watch?â

âIndeed I do!â said the little girl.

Slicko saw the boy take all the nuts out of the
eating dish.

âI wonder what he is doing that for,â the little
squirrel thought. âIâm hungry, and I want to
eat those nuts.â But the boy took every one.

âWhat are you going to do?â asked his sister.

âYouâll soon see,â he answered with a laugh.
âI am going to teach Slicko her first trick.â

Then the boy placed two or three nice, sweet,
juicy chestnuts inside the wheel of the squirrel
cage. This wheel went around and around, just
as a barrel rolls over the ground, only the wire
wheel of the squirrel cage stayed right in the
[92]

same place, whirling about as does a merry-go-round.

âNow, when Slicko goes in to get the nuts,
sheâll make the wheel go around,â the boy said
to his sisters. âThe faster she runs, the faster
the wheel will go, and sheâll be doing a trick.â

âOh, letâs watch her!â cried Sallie.

âWell, you may watch all you like,â said
Slicko to herself, âbut I am not going in that
wheel. Iâm afraid!â

So she stayed in the other part of the cage,
looking at the chestnuts, and wishing she could
get them, for she was getting more and more
hungry every minute.

âMaybe I can pull one out without going in
the wheel myself,â thought Slicko. She reached
her paw in through the little round hole that
led into the wheel from her cage. She could almost
touch the chestnuts, but not quite.

âThere! Sheâs going in!â cried one of the
girls softly.

But Slicko did not go.

âIf she wasnât afraid, sheâd go in and have a
ride,â the boy said. âCome on, Slicko,â he
called, âit wonât hurt you.â

Slicko did not want to. However, she kept
getting more and more hungry, and those chestnuts
looked so good!

âIâm going to try it!â said the little jumping
[93]

squirrel to herself, finally. âI donât believe that
boy would do me any harm.â

Very slowly and carefully, Slicko stepped into
the moving wheel. It rocked gently to and fro.
As soon as the squirrel was all the way inside, it
moved more. She felt as though she were falling
and then, so that she should not fall, she took
two or three little steps.

The wire wheel seemed to slide out from under
her. It went whirling around, and the faster
Slicko ran, the faster the wheel went. The
little squirrel stayed right in the same place, but
the wire wheel went round and round under her
pattering feet.

âThere she goes!â cried Sallie.

âOh, see how fast she can run!â exclaimed
Mollie.

âYes, she has learned to do the trick,â said the
boy. âI thought she would get so hungry that
she would go in after the chestnuts, and then
sheâd make the wheel whirl.â

And that was just what Slicko had done. She
was so surprised at the fast motion of the wheel
that she did not think to eat the nuts inside.
But now, after whirling about for some time,
Slicko did not run so fast. The wheel went
slower and slower, and finally stopped. The
nuts, which had been rattling around with
Slicko, dropped down beside her, and she began
[94]

to eat them, sitting up on her hind legs, and
holding them in her front paws, while she
gnawed off the shell.

âOh, isnât she just too cute for anything!â cried
Sallie.

âJust lovely,â said her sister, Mollie.

âWell, thatâs one trick,â the boy said. âItâs
the easiest of all. Now that she knows the
wheel wonât hurt her, sheâll often take a whirl
in it.â

âYes,â said Slicko to herself, as she heard Bob
say this, âI think I shall.â

And, from then on, Slicko was no longer
afraid of the whirling wheel of her cage. Bob
did not have to put any more nuts in it to get
her to go in. Slicko liked it, and went in herself,
several times a day. It gave her something
to doâlike playing a game.

The cage where Slicko was kept was too small
to let her run about and jump very much, and
the wheel was just the very thing. On that,
Slicko could pretend she was running a race,
as she used to do with her brothers and sister in
the woods.

âOh, I wonder what has become of Chatter,
and all the rest of them,â thought Slicko many
times, as she thought of her former home. âAnd
I wonder if I shall ever see them again!â

âWhat are you doing, Bob?â asked Mollie,
[95]

one day as she saw her brother pasting some
paper over a little wooden hoop. It was just like
those the men in the circus jump through, only
smaller.

âI am getting ready for another trick for
Slicko,â he said.

âDo you think you can get her to jump
through one of those paper covered hoops?â
asked Sallie.

âI think so,â replied Bob. âIâm going to
try.â

Slicko was quite tame by this time, and often
would be allowed to run about the room, being
let out of her cage. Sometimes Bob would sit
in a chair, and put some nuts in his pocket. Then
Slicko would run along on the floor, crawl up
Bobâs leg, dive down into his pocket, and pull
out the nuts.

âThatâs another trick,â Bob would say with
a laugh. âMy squirrel is getting to be very
smart!â

âBut how are you going to get her to jump
through a paper hoop?â asked Mollie.

âIâll soon show you,â said Bob.

By this time he had two or three hoops all
ready, pasted over with thin red, white and blue
paper, so that they looked very pretty indeed.

âNow, Slicko,â said Bob, as he took the little
squirrel out of her wire cage, âyou are going to
[96]

learn a new trick to-day. And I want you to
pay strict attention, and do as I tell you.â

Bob took a piece of sweet apple, of which
Slicko was very fond, and put it on top of a
little box on the dining-room table. Then he
put Slicko down at the other end of the table,
and stood near her, with one of the paper hoops
in his hand.

âNow, Slicko,â said Bob, as he pointed at
the apple, âthat is for you, if you do as I want
you to do. Go get the apple, Slicko.â

Slicko knew what apple was. She could
smell it, and she thought it must be meant for
her. She scampered toward it, but, when she
had almost reached it she found Bob holding a
paper hoop out in front of her. The hoop was
between Slicko and the apple.

Slicko started to go around to one side, to get
out of the way of the hoop, but Bob moved it,
so that it was still in front of her.

âWell, I can go the other way,â thought
Slicko. But, when she turned the other way,
there was still the paper hoop in front of her.
It was between her and the apple, and she wanted
that apple very much.

âHa!â thought Slicko, âif Bob doesnât take
that paper hoop out of my way, Iâll jump
right through it and get the apple anyhow!â

[97]

CHAPTER X

SLICKO RUNS AWAY

âCome on, get the apple, Slicko!â called
Bob.

âHow can she, when you keep putting
that paper hoop in front of her?â asked
Bobâs sister Mollie.

âSheâll go right through it,â said Sallie.

âThatâs just what I want her to do,â Bob answered,
with a laugh. âIt will be a fine trick.â

Slicko did not understand all of this talk, but
she did want that apple, and when she heard
Bob say âtrick,â she began to understand that,
after all, perhaps the hoop was only put in front
of her for fun.

So the next time she ran toward the piece of
apple on the table, and the boy moved the paper
hoop in front of her,
Slicko gave a sudden little
jump, and, right through the paper she went
,
breaking a hole in it, and landing close to the
piece of apple.

âHurrah!â cried the boy. âThere she goes!â

âOh, wasnât that cute!â exclaimed Mollie.

âJust too sweet for anything,â spoke Sallie.
âI hope she didnât hurt herself!â

[98]

âHurt herself? Of course not!â cried Bob.
âHow could she, when the paper was so soft and
thin? And she has learned another trick now,
havenât you, Slicko?â

Slicko was too busy eating the apple to answer,
even if she could have spoken boy language.
She sat up on her hind legs, with her
tail spread out over her head, and, holding the
bit of apple in her paws, which were like little
hands, she nibbled at the sweet pulp.

âWill she do it again?â asked Mollie.

âI guess so,â answered the boy. âIâll try her
once more. This time Iâll give her a nut.â

When Slicko had finished eating the apple,
Bob took her gently up in his hands, and set her
down at one end of the table. On the other end
he placed some pieces of hickory nut meats, with
the shells off.

âAh, ha!â thought Slicko. âThey look good!
I can eat them without stopping to gnaw off the
hard shell.â

The little jumping squirrel started toward the
pile of nut meats, but, before she could reach
them, Bob put in front of her another hoop, covered
with paper.

Just as she had done at first, Slicko tried to
run to one side, but Bob kept the hoop in front
of her. Slicko had forgotten about jumping
through, even though she had done it only a little
while before.

[99]

Slicko gave a sudden little jump, and, right through the
paper she went.

[100-
101]

Most animals are that way when first they
learn a new trick. They forget very easily, until
they have done it over and over again. It was
this way with Slicko.

But as Bob kept the hoop in front of her, and
as she kept smelling the nice nuts at the other
end of the table, it came into Slickoâs head that
she must jump through the paper of the hoop
to get them, just as she had done to get the piece
of apple.

âHere I go!â thought the little squirrel.

She gave another little jump, and right
through the second paper hoop she went, coming
down on the table close to the nut meats, which
she began to eat; and very good they tasted, indeed.

âHa! She did the trick again!â cried Bob.

âWhat a cunning squirrel!â exclaimed Mollie.

âSheâs just too dear for anything,â said Sallie.

Slicko understood a little of this talk, and she
was glad she had pleased the children. She was
beginning to be very happy in her new home,
and she liked Bob and his sisters very much.

The boy had Slicko jump through the paper
hoops several more times that day, and then he
put her back in the big wire cage, and let her
[102]

rest. Wild animals do not like to be doing
tricks all the while. They get tired just as you
do.

The next day Slicko did the hoop tricks again,
and soon she was so smart that she knew, as
soon as she saw Bob with the paper-covered
things, that she was to do her jumping trick.
She did not have to have a piece of apple placed
at one end of the table to make her jump, now.

But, each time, after she was through doing
her little tricks, she was given something good
to eat. That is always the way to train wild
animals or petsâbe kind to them when they
have done what you want them to do.

Slicko lived in the house with the boy for several
weeks. The weather had gotten colder
now, and winter would soon be here. Slicko
could tell this, for sometimes the windows of
the room, in which her cage stood, were left
open, and she could feel the cold wind. But
her fur coat was growing warm and thick now,
and she would not have minded being outdoors,
no matter how cold it was, if she had plenty to
eat.

But, after all, Slicko was rather glad that she
had a good home for the coming winter. She
remembered how, when she had lived in the
home-nest, she had heard her papa and mamma
talking in their chatter language about how hard
[103]

it was, sometimes, to find things to eat, when the
white snow covered the ground. Squirrels always
store away nuts, but sometimes they can
not get enough, and sometimes the winter is so
long that they eat up all they have in their nest,
before it is time for spring to come and bring
other food.

âBut that canât happen to me here,â thought
Slicko. âNo matter how cold it is outside, or
how much snow there is, I shall be warm in this
house, and Bob and his sisters will give me
enough to eat. After all, maybe it is a good
thing Bob caught me and brought me here.â

Bob taught his pet squirrel other tricks. He
taught Slicko to crawl right up to his pocket,
and go to sleep there. He also taught her to
go into his pockets after lumps of sugar, and
other good things to eat. When she had found
them, she would come out and sit on his shoulder
to eat them. This always made the children
who saw it laugh, and they thought Slicko was
a very cute squirrel indeed.

Bobâs sisters tried to teach Slicko tricks. But
they wanted to make a sort of doll of her, and,
though Slicko was a girl squirrel, she knew nothing
of dolls.

âOh, wouldnât she look cute dressed up in one
of my dollsâ dresses?â asked Mollie of Sallie,
one day.

[104]

âYes, indeed! Letâs try it!â exclaimed Sallie.

They took Slicko out of her cage, and, though
they handled her very gently, the little squirrel
did not like being put inside a dollâs dress.

âOh, isnât she too cute!â cried Mollie.

âYes,â said Sallie. âNow letâs put her in the
doll carriage and wheel her about.â

But this was too much for Slicko. It was
bad enough to be dressed up as a doll, but when
it came to being put in a thing on wheels, and
ridden about the room, that was more than
Slicko would stand. She did not mind her wire
wheel in the cage, but she did not like to be
wheeled in the carriage.

Out she jumped, and with her paws she pulled
off the dollâs dress that had been tied on her.
Then, chattering as loudly as she could, she ran
to her cage, and hid in the little place where
she slept. There Mollie and Sallie could not
get her.

âOh, well, never mind. Letâs play with our
real dolls,â said Mollie. âMaybe Bob wouldnât
like us to dress up his squirrel.â

âAll right,â agreed Sallie. And Slicko was
glad to be left alone.

She did not mind when Bob taught her tricks.

âIf I learn a number of them,â thought Slicko,
âI shall be as smart as Squinty, the comical pig,
or as Mappo, the monkey, or Tum Tum, the
[105]

jolly elephant. I wonder if I shall ever see them
again.â

Slicko felt a little sad when she thought of
her animal friends. Then she began thinking
of her father and mother, of her sister and
brothers, and of Aunt Whitey.

âI wonder where Aunt Whitey could be?â
thought Slicko. âI should like to see her
again.â

At these times Slicko became a little lonesome
and homesick. But, whenever she was beginning
to get too sad, Bob would come, take her
out of the cage, and either give her something
good to eat, or put her through some of her
tricks. Then Slicko would be happy once more.

As the days went on, Slicko became so tame
that the door of her cage was never shut. She
could come and go as she pleased, and she
roamed all about the house. She would come
to the dinner table, and sit up near Bob, who
would feed her from his plate. And then she
would scramble into his pocket, to get a bit of
sugar.

The winter came, with its cold and snow.
Slicko stayed in the warm house. Then the
days began to get warmer. Spring was coming.
One day it was warm enough for the windows
of the room, where Slickoâs cage stood, to be
opened. The little squirrel smelled the fresh
[106]

air of spring. She seemed to smell the cool,
green woods, where the trees were just beginning
to put on their new green dresses of leaves.

Something seemed to be calling to Slicko.
She heard the hum of bees, the song of birds and
the chatter of other squirrels. A strange feeling
came over Slicko. She wanted to run away
to the woods.

She looked all around the room. No one was
there. The door of her cage was open. Softly,
on her pattering feet, Slicko ran to the window.
She climbed to the sill, looked out into the garden,
and off to the woods. Then Slicko jumped
down into the soft, green grass, and ran away.

[107]

CHAPTER XI

SLICKOâS BIG ADVENTURE

Slicko had been a tame squirrel for several
months. Before that, and for a
longer time, she had been just a little wild
squirrel, living in the woods, and doing as all
wild squirrels do.

So, when she jumped out of the window and
ran away, she became, for the time being, just
as wild as she ever had been. For a little while
she forgot all the tricks Bob had taught her,
and she forgot the nice pieces of apples and the
nuts he used to give her. Slicko was just the
same, now, as were her brothers, or her sisterâa
little, wild animal.

She ran over the grass, crouching down low,
and taking big jumps so no one would see her.
Most of all, Slicko wanted to keep out of the
way of Muffins, the big black cat at Bobâs house.

This cat was not a good friend of Slickoâs.
Often, when the little squirrel was not watching,
the cat would come quietly up close to her,
and look at Slicko with very hungry eyes.
Sometimes Bob would see Muffins, and drive
her away.

[108]

âMuffins wouldnât hurt your squirrel,â said
Mollie, who liked the cat very much.

âOf course she wouldnât,â said Sallie.
âRover, your dog, wouldnât hurt Slicko, so why
would our cat?â

âWell, a cat is different from a dog,â Bob
would say. âA cat canât help sneaking up, and
wanting to jump on anything it sees moving.
But a dog only barks, and makes a big fuss.
He doesnât really do any harm. Of course I
donât mean to say Muffins would intend to do
Slicko any harm, but I wonât give Muffins a
chance.â

So Bob never let the big cat come near his
squirrel, and Slicko was glad of it, for Muffins
had very hungry eyes. And now, when Slicko
was running away, and Bob was not there to
look after her, and when there was no strong
wire cage to run and hide in, Slicko was very
careful. She looked on both sides of her, as
she ran along over the grass. Slicko was not
going to be caught, if she could avoid it.

The little squirrel came to a tree, and up it
she scrambled as fast as she could go. It was
the first tree she had climbed since Bob had
caught her in the trap, and Slicko was glad to
find she had not forgotten how. Her leg, that
had been pinched in the trap, was now as strong
as the other ones.

[109]

Sticking her claws in the bark of the tree,
Slicko went up, away to the top.

âThere!â exclaimed the little squirrel, âif
Muffins comes after me, sheâll have trouble in
reaching me.â

Cats can climb trees, too, almost as well as
squirrels can, though not so fast. But a cat does
not very often go way up to the top of a tree, as
Slicko had done.

The little runaway squirrel sat down on a tree
branch and looked about her. The tree was
just putting out its first green leaves, and the
wind was blowing the branches gently to and
fro, like a swing.

âOh, this is lovely!â thought Slicko. âIt is
much nicer than my wheel in the cage. I am
glad I ran away. I am never going back in the
big house again.â

You see, after all, though wild animals may
seem contented to be pets, they always want to
be free as they were at first.

Slicko began to look all over the tree to see
if any nuts grew on it. She was not yet old
enough to know that there would be no nuts
until fall. Nor could she tell that the tree she
was in was a pear tree, and never grew nuts.
There would be no pears, either, until late in the
summer.

Slicko was beginning to feel hungry. True,
[110]

she had eaten her breakfast before running
away, but now she felt hungry again. There
seemed to be nothing to eat in the tree where she
was hiding. It was no fun to be hungry.

âI must see about getting something to eat,â
thought Slicko. âIâll stay up here awhile, and
then Iâll go down and hunt for some nuts or
bits of apple. Oh, Iâll have a fine time, and I
wonât have to jump through paper hoops, or do
any tricks.â

Pretty soon Slicko, who sat on a limb of the
tree where she could look at the window of the
room where she used to live, heard the voice of
Bob, her little master.

âI say!â cried Bob, âhave any of you seen
Slicko?â

âShe was in her cage, a little while ago,â said
Mollie. âIsnât she there now?â

âNo, and her cage is open, and so is the window
of the room,â went on Bob. âIâm afraid
she has run away, or else maybe Muffins has
caught her.â

âOh, you bad boy, to say such a thing!â cried
Sallie. âMuffins wouldnât take Slicko. More
likely itâs Rover!â

âRover wouldnât either,â said Bob. âI wonder
where Slicko can be. Here, Slicko!
Slicko!â he called. âCome and get some nuts!
Come and get some sugar!â

[111]

Slicko, up in the tree, heard Bob, but, though
she was very hungry, she would not go down
and get in his pocket, as she used to do. Slicko
made up her little squirrel mind that as long as
she
had
run away, she would not go back so
soon.

âI want to have a little fun,â she said to herself.

Bob called and called again. He looked all
over for Slicko, even up in the trees, but Slicko
managed to hide behind a leafy branch, and
Bob could not see her. Bob even called Rover,
thinking the dog might be able to help him find
the lost squirrel.

From her perch in the tree, Slicko saw Bob
and Rover running about. The dog barked:

âBow wow! Bow wow! Bow wow!â as if he
were calling Slicko to come down. But the little
squirrel was not yet ready.

âI know what Iâll do,â said Bob. âIâll get
some nuts and put them where Slicko can see
them, close by the open window. Iâll set her
cage there, too, on a chair in the room. Maybe
sheâs lost, and canât find her way home. But
perhaps she can smell the nuts, and when she
comes for them, sheâll see her cage, and be glad
to go back into it.â

âOh, yes, do that,â said Mollie. âOnce when
my canary bird flew away, I hung the cage on
[112]

a tree outside, and left the door open. And,
pretty soon, Dick flew back into it.â

âWell, I hope Slicko comes back to her cage,â
said Bob.

But Slicko had no idea of coming back so
soon.

In a little while Bob had put some nuts on
the ground outside the window, and near them,
on a chair inside the room, he put the squirrelâs
cage.

âNow Iâll hide and watch to see if Slicko
comes back,â said Bob. But Slicko did not
want to be seen, so she stayed up in the tree.
She was more hungry than ever, but she would
not go down and get the nuts. After a while
Bob got tired of hiding and waiting.

âIâll just go off and play ball,â he said to his
sisters. âWhen I come back, maybe Slicko will
be in her cage.â

Slicko waited until Bob had gone. The little
squirrel looked down, and seeing Mollie and
Sallie off on the front porch, playing with their
dolls, she thought it would be safe to go down
and get a few nuts.

Very carefully Slicko climbed down the tree.
Stopping now and then, to make sure there was
no danger, she reached the pile of nuts. She
ate some, and oh! how good they tasted.

Then, all at once, Slicko heard something
[113]

coming softly through the grass behind her. It
was so soft that it sounded only like the wind
blowing, but Slicko knew that it was not the
wind.

Slicko turned quickly, just in time to see Muffins,
the cat, make a spring for her.

âOh my!â cried Slicko, and, turning quickly,
the little squirrel made a mad dash for the pear
tree. She had a nut in her paws, but she
dropped that in running.

âMeaouw! Wow!â snarled Muffins, the big,
black cat. She gave a spring, sticking out her
claws, and trying to catch Slicko, but she was
just too late. Slicko reached the tree, and up it
she went almost to the very tip-top.

Muffins followed, and ran up the tree trunk
a little way, but she did not go as far as Slicko
had gone.

âMy! That was the time she almost caught
me!â thought Slicko, her little heart beating
very fast. âI must be more careful after this.
And oh! those nuts were so good. But I wonât
dare go down after them again until itâs dark,
when Muffins canât see me.â

Slicko stayed in the tree all the rest of that
day. She could see the pile of nuts on the
ground, but, though she was very, very hungry,
she did not dare go down to get any for fear of
Muffins.

[114]

Slicko saw Bob come and look at the nuts.
The boy cried out:

âOh, my squirrel has been here! Some of
the nuts are gone! Slicko is somewhere around
here!â

But, though Bob looked in all the trees around
the house, he could not find Slicko. Slicko
saw Bob, though.

The little squirrel stayed in the tree all that
night. But she did not have a very good time.
It was cold, and it rained, and there was no
hole, and no nest, into which Slicko could crawl
to keep warm. She just had to shiver. And
she was more hungry than ever, too.

âOh dear! Running away isnât as much fun
as I thought it would be!â said Slicko. âTo-morrow,
when Bob puts out the nuts again, and
leaves the cage open, Iâm going to run back into
it. I have had enough of living like this. I
had rather do tricks, such as jumping through
paper hoops, than be cold and hungry.â

But the next day Bob went away, and did not
put out any nuts for his little squirrel. And
those he had put out were carried away by the
rats.

So Slicko got very few of them to eat, and
she was quite hungry. She managed to find a
few old acorns in the woods, but they were not
so good as the nuts, apples and sugar Bob and
[115]

his sisters used to feed her. And, as the window
of the room was not open, and as the cage
was not put out, Slicko could not run back home
again.

âIsnât Bob going to try to catch his squirrel?â
asked Mollie of Sallie, on the second day.

âNo, I heard him say he guessed she was gone
for good,â said Sallie.

âWell, I havenâtâIâm here yet, and Iâm coming
back to my cageâthat is when I see it,â
Slicko said to herself.

That afternoon Slicko, perched in the top of
her tree, saw one of the attic windows of Bobâs
house open.

âHa!â exclaimed the little squirrel. âI can
jump in there from my tree. Iâll do it.â

Slicko scrambled up to the highest branch.
From there she could easily jump in through
the attic window, and this she did.

She looked around, and she was glad when
she saw some butternuts on the floor of the attic.
Slicko soon gnawed a hole in one, and ate out
the sweet meat. Then she felt much better.

It was nice and warm in the attic, and there
was a pile of old clothes there. On these Slicko
lay down and went to sleep.

When Slicko awoke, it was all dark. She
had slept until it was night. She sat up on her
hind legs and listened. She could hear nothing.
[116]

The house was very quiet. Slicko looked
at the window by which she had entered. It
was tightly shut now.

All of a sudden Slicko felt thirsty. She knew
there was no water up in the attic, but there
was plenty down stairs in the kitchen. Bob always
left a pan full there on the floor for his
pet.

âIâll go down stairs and get a drink in the
kitchen,â said Slicko to herself.

Squirrels can see in the dark, almost as well
as can owls, as I told you before. Soon Slicko
was making her way safely down the front stairs.

As she got to the kitchen, she saw a light
burning low. And, by this light Slicko could
see a man, with a piece of black cloth over his
face, taking knives and forks and spoons from
a table, and putting them into his pocket.

Slicko, of course, did not know that the things
were knives and forks and spoons. She only
knew they were the things Bob and his sisters,
and father and mother ate with. And, when
she saw the man putting them into his pocket,
Slicko thought they might be something good
for her to eat.

âThat must be Bobâs papa,â thought Slicko.
âWell, Iâll give him a surprise. Iâll run up
his leg and go into his pocket. Then heâll know
Iâm home again.â

[117]

CHAPTER XII

SLICKO FINDS HER NEST

Scampering softly over the oilcloth of
the kitchen floor, Slicko came close to the
man. Slicko thought it was Bobâs papa,
but it was not. Iâll soon tell you who the man
was.

âI do hope he has some sugar for me,â thought
Slicko, for sometimes Bobâs papa would play
at tricks and games with the little squirrel, and
do just as Bob didâhide things in his pocket.

Slicko was almost at the manâs leg. Her little
claws made a patter-patter-pat sound on the
floor oilcloth. The man heard it, and started.

âA rat!â he cried. âI donât like rats!â

âThe idea of calling me a rat!â thought
Slicko. âIâll soon show you who I am, Mr.
Bobâs papa.â

The next moment Slicko scrambled up the
manâs leg, sticking her claws in the soft cloth of
his trousers.

âGet away from me! Get away from me!â
the man cried, very much excited, and he struck
at Slicko. âGet off me!â and the man was
[118]

fairly screaming now. âGet away! I hate
rats! Iâm afraid of âem!â

âWhy, heâs worse than Tum Tum, the elephant,â
said Slicko to herself. âBut maybe heâs
only fooling. Iâll climb up on his shoulder and
sit there. Then maybe heâll give me something
to eat.â

Quickly Slicko scrambled up to the manâs
shoulder. She put her soft, cold nose on his
neck.

âOh! Oh! Go away! A rat! Itâll bite me!â
cried the man.

He leaped aside and with his hand brushed
Slicko away. She fell on the kitchen table.
And then, all of a sudden the whole house was
filled with light.
Slicko sat up on the table in
time to see the man give a jump through the
window
, while from his pocket fell a shower
of knives and forks and spoons. For the man
was a burglarâa thiefâand he had come in the
night to rob.

Out of the window he jumped. Slicko could
see him very well, for the electric lights were
turned on now. Up stairs Bobâs papa had heard
the burglar cry out, and he had switched on the
lights.

âWhat a funny man,â thought Slicko of the
burglar, âto jump out of the window as I did.
I wonder why he is running away.â

[119]

Slicko sat up on the table in time to see the man give
a jump through the window.

[120-
121]

Slicko saw a pan of water on the floor. She
scrambled down and took a long drink, for
she was quite thirsty. But she was not at all
afraid.

âI wish that man had let me sit on his shoulder,â
she said to herself. âHe might have
given me a nut, or a piece of sugar. And he
called me a ratâI donât like that.â

After getting her drink, Slicko sat up on the
table again, and waited. She heard voices talking,
and people coming down stairs. Bob and
his father came into the kitchen.

âOh, look! Thereâs my squirrel Slicko!â
cried Bob. âSheâs come back!â

âChatter! Chatter! Chat-chat-chatter-r-r-r-r!â
chirped Slicko. âOf course Iâm your little
pet squirrel come back again. Iâm sorry I
ran away.â Only, of course, Bob did not understand
this.

âWhat has happened?â asked the voice of
Bobâs mother.

âSlicko has come back,â said Bob.

âIs that all?â

âNo, something else happened,â said Bobâs
father, âand I guess we have Slicko to thank
that our house was not robbed.â

âOur house robbed! What do you mean?â

âWhy the kitchen window has been broken
open, and here is some of our silver scattered
[122]

about,â said Bobâs father. âI heard a man yell
something about a rat, and I turned on the
lights. He must have been a burglar, but he
got away.â

âWhat frightened him?â asked Bob. By
this time Slicko was sitting on Bobâs shoulder,
eating a lump of sugar he had gotten for her
from the pantry.

âI think Slicko, your squirrel, frightened
him,â said the boyâs father. âThat must have
been it. The burglar came in here to rob us.
In the night Slicko came back, somehow, and
probably she tried to make friends with him,
as she does with you, not knowing who he was.
The man must have thought Slicko was a rat,
and, being afraid, he ran off. Slicko saved us
from being robbed, for see, the man dropped
most of the things he took. Your squirrel is
very smart, Bob. She scared away the thief.â

âShe is a good little squirrel,â said Bob. âI
am glad she came back to me.â

Slicko was put back into her cage for the rest
of the night. She was glad she had come back
to Bob. Everybody went to bed.

The next day Slicko did her tricks again, and
learned some new ones. She had many nuts and
apples to eat.

Still Slicko was not happy. The weather
grew warmer. It was very warm in the house,
[123]

but Slicko was not allowed to be out of her cage.

âI donât want her to run away again,â said
Bob.

Poor Slicko was now very mournful. As the
warm days came, she wanted to be free to run
in the shady woods. She would rather have
sat swinging on the branch of a tree, than whirl
around in the wire wheel of her cage.

âBob,â said the boyâs father to him one day,
âdonât you think your squirrel would be happier
if you let it go out in the woods to live?â

âWhat! Let my pet squirrel go?â asked Bob,
in surprise.

âYes,â answered his father. âSlicko is not
happy in her cage now. She might have been,
in the winter, but now it is summer, and she
ought to be out in the open. I think she wants to
go.â

Oh, how much Slicko hoped she could go!
Her little heart beat very fast, as she looked
through the bars of her cage.

âLet Slicko go!â said Bob softly. âOh, I
canât do that!â

âSlicko did us a very great favor,â said Bobâs
father. âShe frightened away the burglar. I
think, as a reward, you ought to let her go,
Bob.â

Bob said nothing for a long while. Then he
spoke softly.

[124]

âVery well, father,â he said. âIâll let Slicko
go free!â

Bob took the cage, with his pet in it, to the
edge of the woods. He opened the little wire
door.

âYou may go, Slicko,â said Bob. âGo off
to the woods where you belong. Iâll set you
free, but I hope you will come and see me, sometime.â

âChatter-chatter-chatter-r-r-r-r-r!â chirped
Slicko. She sprang out of the cage, and stood
upright for a moment on the ground.
Then,
she scrambled up on Bobâs shoulder and put her
cold, soft nose on his cheek.
That was her way
of kissing him good-bye.

Down scrambled Slicko, and off to the woods
she ran.

âGood-bye, Slicko, my little jumping squirrel!â
called Bob, as he went back to the house
with the empty cage. And yet, after all, he
felt happy that he had let Slicko go.

Slicko ran on and on through the woods. All
that day she wandered about. She found a
spring and got a drink of water, and in a field
she found an early apple tree, and ate an apple.

The next day, as Slicko was jumping through
the woods, she came to a tree that she was sure
she had seen before. Half way up was a big
lump, on which she knew she had often sat. A
[125]

little farther up was a broken limb, and, close
to that limb was a hole.

âWhy, thatâs the nest where I used to live,â
said Slicko. âI wonder if papa and mamma,
and Chatter and Fluffy and Nutto have come
back! Iâm going up to see.â

Up the tree scrambled Slicko. She looked
in her old nest. Something inside it moved.

âHello!â said Slicko.

âWhyâwhyâwhy itâs Slickoâcome back!â
cried Chatter. âPapaâMamma! Nutto, Fluffy!
Come here. Slicko has come back!â

Out of the nest rushed all the Squirrel family.
They sat on their tails and looked at Slicko.

âMy! How she has grown!â cried her
mother, patting Slicko with her paws.

âHow long have you been here?â asked
Slicko. âThat time you sent me to Aunt
Whiteyâs, I couldnât find herâshe wasnât home.â

âNo, Slicko,â said her papa, âyour aunt had
hurriedly moved to another nest. We didnât
know it when we sent you there. And, not long
ago, we all came back here. For it is safe now.
The hunter-man and his dog have gone from
these woods.â

âAnd so we are all together again,â said
Fluffy. âIâm glad.â

âSo am I!â exclaimed Slicko.

âBut where have you beenâand what happened
[126]

to you?â asked the mamma squirrel.

âOh, I have had so many adventures!â cried
Slicko. âI can jump through paper hoops, I
can crawl in Bobâs pocket and get sugar, and I
scared away a burglar!â

âMy, you
did
have some adventures,â said
Mrs. Squirrel. âBut come in now, and have
some dinner.â

And so that was the end of Slickoâs adventures
for a while. She got safely back to her
nest, and she lived there with her father and
mother, and sister and brothers, for many years.

Sometimes she would meet Squinty, the comical
pig, or Mappo, the merry monkey. And
that reminds me. I have some stories to tell
you about him. But I shall have to put them
in another book. It will be named âMappo,
the Merry Monkey,â and in it you may read all
about his many adventures.

âAre you going to run away again, Slicko?â
asked Nutto, one day about a week after his sister
came back.

âNo, I am only going to run up to the top of
this tree, and down again,â said the little squirrel,
and she did.

In all nursery literature animals have played a conspicuous
part; and the reason is obvious for nothing entertains a child
more than the funny antics of an animal. These stories
abound in amusing incidents such as children adore and the
characters are so full of life, so appealing to a childâs imagination
that none will be satisfied until they have met all of their
favoritesâSquinty, Slicko, Mappo, Tum Tum and Don.

Squinty, the Comical Pig

Slicko, the Jumping Squirrel

Mappo, the Merry Monkey

Tum Tum, the Jolly Elephant

Don, A Runaway Dog.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit
www.gutenberg.org/donate
.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
